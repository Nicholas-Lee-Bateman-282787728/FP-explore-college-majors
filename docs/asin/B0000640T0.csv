I liked this version a lot because it combines the best parts of the original story, but sweetens it up enough so its enjoyable. It also has added clever surprises not found in any other version of the story, not to mention neat special effects considdering its low budget and the fact that it was made for television. Kristin Kreuk of the WB's Smallville makes her feature film debut as Snow White, the sixteen year old princess whos father has fallen under the spell of her evil stepmother, played by Miranda Richardson from t.v's Merlin and Alice In Wonderland. The prince is also played by the young man who played Karl in Dinotopia. This movie is not rated, but I would rate it PG. It contains no language or violence, but it does steer towards the darker side of this classic fairy tale and may not be sutible for the younger audience.

697462,A1FALNRP7TPE3V,B0000640T0,A. Lucy,"[1, 1]","A very good movie, I almost gave it four stars instead of five, trying to be more ""critical"" of the film, but that seemed a bit unfair, not to mention untrue to how much I actually enjoyed the film. Would I say I liked it? Yes. Would I say I loved it? Well, I wouldn't say I didn't (I don't lie). So both is true, thus five stars it is! All the more so since the one of the main reasons I was going to knock off a star was because I think it should have been Snow White on the dvd cover's spine instead of the evil queen. Don't get me wrong, the evil queen is great and all, but the movie isn't called ""Queen Elspeth: fairiest of them all"" now is it? So what the heck's up with her being on the side by herself like that? But it seemed a little petty to take off a star JUST for that, when I loved everything else about both the film, the cover, AND the disc menus.This movie really is an exellent way to show the classic fairytale on screen, even more so than I remembered from when I first saw it on TV many years ago. It has all the elements of a perfect dark fairy-tale (evil queens with awesome back-stories, scary wish-granters that pop up out of the ice, dwarfs that can create weather and travel anywhere they want as long as they are all together, they even had a fantastic call-back to a much older version of snow white where it was the princess's MOTHER that was trying to kill her, by having the queen magically transform herself into said mother using her mirror) without getting horror-film gory or adult. Major thumbs up there. To flesh it out a bit, the story borrows from an Andersen fairytale, the snow queen, and has mirror bits flying into peoples' eyes. You wouldn't think so, but it fits wonderfully into this version. It explains why the ""huntsman"" is so willing to kill Snow White for the queen and why he changes his mind at the last minute (a tear of guilt at what he's doing washes out the mirror piece). It also borrows from Snow White and Rose Red (the prince turns into a brown bear). And while this might seem like just another way to have people confuse the two very different fairytales, it goes so well with the film that this doesn't really matter.I've read other reviews saying that the actress that played Snow White did everything from a ""blah"" job, to a terrible one. I didn't find that to be true. I loved the Snow White in this version. She's as afraid of her beauty as the queen is jealous of it, which I think worked better than having her just be a typical ""Tra-la-la"" disney sterotype, singing about when her prince is supposed to show up. In this version, the Prince shows up early on, but up till the last minute before the hunter is supposed to kill her under the queen's orders she more or less just ignores the fact that he likes her (because he doesn't know her) and when she stops ignoring it she tells him that beauty has nothing to do with what's inside. Her relationship with the dwarfs was well-done, too; having one of them be a statue she talked to in the garden, someone who ""saw her life, saw her tears"" was much more emotional than it would have been having her just stumble upon COMPLETE strangers, all the more so since she doesn't stay with them for as long in this version as in some others.The costumes in this movie were awesome. I lost count of how many times I said, ""I love that dress"" while watching it. At LEAST four or five.Over-all, this is the best Snow White movie out there that I've had the pleasure of seeing. It's not really for little kids, but there isn't anything particularly shocking in it aside from a couple of scary parts-including one where a ribbon tightens around Snow White's middle until she can't breathe and passes out, and another where the evil queen's brother, a pretty scary-looking dude, all and all, suddenly pops up out of a patch of ice-and it's fine for anyone over the age of 10 or 11 who likes a darker, less ""heigh-ho"" fare in their fantasy-themed movies.",5,"Perfectly Grimm, with a touch of Andersen.

Kristen Kriek seemed perfect for her role too after seeing her in the WB series Smallville, I could easily see her in this fairy tale role.At first, I was troubled by the seven dwarfs however as 1 of them was not a small person but a normal sized human but as the movie progressed, I began to see that it was not his physical size that was the problem but his mental attitude - which is why he and the other 6 drawfs didn't really see any difference between them or anyone else for that matter.The special effects were great - especially the magic behind the enchanted mirror, the costumes and the sets.

697466,AB34G6VKP28L,B0000640T0,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[15, 18]","Hallmark may not have a monopoly on dark fairy tales, but they certainly film them in style. This may not be the sugar-coated fantasy flick you remember hearing as a child, or even watching in the old Disney cartoon. This fairy tale is told the way that Grimm would tell it... with dark, sinister elements and fascinating plot twists. The seven dwarves (one of which is a girl) control the weather and are named for the days of the week. One of them is six foot tall. The Evil Queen is actually a hideous half-mortal whose brother, a genie, has given her a chance for happiness by giving her great beauty. The mirror plays a large role in the bewitching of Snow White's father, and Prince Alfred will soon face a challenge of his own.There's something about the film that appealed to me... probably the darkness of the script, but also its reasoning and humor. I much enjoyed the psychological aspect of 'Snow White.' It's a magnificent retelling with gorgeous cinematography, a memorable score, and above all a magnificent performance by Miranda Richardson. I thought her enthralling as Queen Mab in Merlin; in 'Snow White' she shows us her full potential. I have doubts in Snow White herself, however... either the actress did not give her any passion, or her role was poorly written. Everyone else is just oozing with unique personality and depth, but this Snow White is a bland, brooding heroine with little to contrive interest in her.What also fascinates me is that they chose to play out the climactic ending with Vera rather than Miranda... but shockingly, it works. She holds up well to the standard set by Richardson in the former scenes, although I did miss our lovely evil stepmother in-between. It's a script that reeks with clever ideas, memorable dialogue, and visual delights. Artisan has gone even beyond its success with The 10th Kingdom in masterful special effects that would put any Hollywood production to shame. The costuming is gorgeous, the sets in keeping with a fairy-tale like Medieval existence, and the cinematography is breathtaking, right from the opening shot to the ending panorama. The writer/director knew what she was doing.But even gorgeously filmed as it is, you aren't going to want to plunk your little sister down in front of this one unaware. The script is very dark and contains sinister plot twists, frightening circumstances, hideous creatures, and some psychological elements.

The unfunny anachronistic dwarves? (And one of them is 6' tall, which is a joke I still don't get) The screechy, mugfest of a performance by the usually astounding Miranda Richardson? The expressionless, bland and inscrutable Snow White?Yes, let's start there. Kristin Kreuk is a pretty girl, but it's evident that's the height of her ""talent"". See her on the cover up there? That's when Kristin is best-- when she's in front of a camera that doesn't record sound or motion. Otherwise we get her lispy monotone, her wide, inexpressively bright eyes, her lack of body language... and in this film, it's all under about ten pounds of cakey looking white makeup. Why hire an ethnic actress for the part of Snow White if all you're going to do is put her in whiteface? What on earth was the point of that?But that's the least of Kreuk's worries. Her acting on Smallville has never been noteworthy, but in this, she's downright offensive. I actually found myself laughing out loud when, during a scene in which the Evil Queen's henchman is poised above her with a dagger raised to kill her, she looks up, face blank, and intones without a hint of inflection, ""Why?""

There are so many touches in this film that just don't even represent what the story is about.  It is not a true enough interpretation to even please little kids, besides the fact that the scenery is beautiful and the music is alright too.  Kristin Kreuk could have been a beautiful Snow White but she is very, very stiff.  One might think that she already took a bite of the poisoned apple (or wished she would have) in the first few moments that we see her onscreen.  Kreuk plays a very depressed Snow White indeed!Miranda Richardson delivers a fair performance as, not exactly a queen but more like an ugly enchantress transformed by her brother(This character doesn't really seem to have a place in the story, a very odd choice)who is given the throne.  I feel that there are some decent parts in this movie.  But nothing screams Snow White.  Like I said, the scenery is beautiful but this is not a movie for everyone.  You'll either be confused or fall asleep if you are not a big fan of fairy tales or have some knowledge of other tales.  It seems as though there were parts from other grimm stories such as The Bear Prince and Snow White and Rose Red incorporated in the plot of this movie but they really do nothing for the story and were a poor choice.

697476,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000640T0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[9, 10]","""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is one of those retellings of a classic fairy tale that is probably going to impress adults more than the kiddies, although you will find some problematic elements in this 2002 television movie.  This version is closer to the original tale told by Jacob Ludwig Carl Grimm and his brother Wilhelm Carl Grimm, but Caroline Thompson and Julie Hickson's teleplay comes up with some inventive elements, most of which work.  But much as I like the veteran character actor Vincent Schiavelli, a six-foot-five-inch dwarf is a bit of a reach for me.Anyhow, once upon a time, John (Tom Irwin) and Josephine (Vera Farmiga) were living happily together in the forest when they had a beautiful baby girl then named Snow White.  However, Josephine dies soon after leaving John alone to fend for his baby.  John buries his wife and starts on a journey to find food; at his darkest moment he is about to give up when he happens to awaken a genie known as the Green Eyed One (Clancy Brown), who will grant three wishes aa a reward for his release.  John's first wish is for milk for Snow White.  His second wish is to have his wife back, but this is beyond the Green Eyed One's power.  Instead, he will provide John with a new queen and a kingdom to go with it.  However, what John does not know is that his new queen, Elpseth (Miranda Richardson) is really his own hag of a sister (the crone is played by Karin Konoval), transformed into a beauty.  Snow White crows up to be played by Kristin Kreuk (a.k.a. Lana Lang on ""Smallville"") and when the spell starts to fade and Elpseth's beauty begins to fade, the story takes a dark turn.""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is a much darker version of the story than the beloved Disney classic, so by no stretch of the imagination is this the first version of Snow White you would want any child to see.  This is a dark version of the tale that takes place in a much more dangerous world, although the entirely reworked dwarf part of the plot (they are now named for the seven days of the week) usually works against the rest of the story.  The sets are beautiful, as are the costumes, and what passes for the magic mirror this time around is pretty spectacular.A lot of people will check out the DVD version because of Kreuk, who is the WB's new Katie Holmes.  I admit I am one of those people, but even I found it rather odd that her cast bio on the DVD features her Neutrogena commercial.  Anyhow, Kreuk has little to do but sit there and look pretty throughout the movie (she shows a lot more emotion and flair in the commercial).  The one who steals the show is Richardson, which is exactly what you would expect when an actress of that caliber gets a choice role like a wicked queen in a fairy tale.  If there was any doubt about whether this version of Snow White is worth checking out, then it is Richardson who tips the scale in that direction.  ""Snow White: The Fairest of Them All"" is certainly worth a look for those who are interested in new takes (or, in this case, extremely old takes) on classic fairy tales.",4,"Check out this Snow White for Kruek, but enjoy Richardson",1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,3093,"['Snow', 'White', 'Fairest', 'Them', 'All', 'one', 'retellings', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'probably', 'going', 'impress', 'adults', 'more', 'kiddies', 'will', 'find', 'problematic', 'elements', '2002', 'television', 'movie', 'version', 'closer', 'original', 'tale', 'told', 'Jacob', 'Ludwig', 'Carl', 'Grimm', 'brother', 'Wilhelm', 'Carl', 'Grimm', 'Caroline', 'Thompson', 'Julie', 'Hickson', 'teleplay', 'up', 'inventive', 'elements', 'most', 'work', 'much', 'like', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Vincent', 'Schiavelli', 'six-foot-five-inch', 'dwarf', 'bit', 'reach', 'me.Anyhow', 'once', 'time', 'John', 'Tom', 'Irwin', 'Josephine', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'were', 'living', 'happily', 'together', 'forest', 'when', 'had', 'beautiful', 'baby', 'girl', 'then', 'named', 'Snow', 'White', 'However', 'Josephine', 'soon', 'leaving', 'John', 'alone', 'fend', 'baby', 'John', 'wife', 'journey', 'find', 'food', 'darkest', 'moment', 'give', 'up', 'when', 'awaken', 'genie', 'known', 'Green', 'Eyed', 'One', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'who', 'will', 'grant', 'three', 'wishes', 'aa', 'reward', 'release', 'John', 'first', 'wish', 'milk', 'Snow', 'White', 'second', 'wish', 'have', 'wife', 'back', 'Green', 'Eyed', 'One', 'power', 'Instead', 'will', 'provide', 'John', 'new', 'queen', 'kingdom', 'go', 'However', 'what', 'John', 'not', 'know', 'new', 'queen', 'Elpseth', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'really', 'own', 'hag', 'sister', 'crone', 'played', 'Karin', 'Konoval', 'transformed', 'beauty', 'Snow', 'White', 'up', 'be', 'played', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'a.k.a', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Smallville', 'when', 'spell', 'fade', 'Elpseth', 'beauty', 'fade', 'story', 'dark', 'turn', 'Snow', 'White', 'Fairest', 'Them', 'All', 'much', 'darker', 'version', 'story', 'beloved', 'Disney', 'classic', 'so', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'first', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'would', 'want', 'child', 'see', 'dark', 'version', 'tale', 'place', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'world', 'entirely', 'reworked', 'dwarf', 'part', 'plot', 'are', 'now', 'named', 'seven', 'days', 'week', 'usually', 'rest', 'story', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'are', 'costumes', 'what', 'magic', 'mirror', 'time', 'around', 'pretty', 'spectacular.A', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'version', 'Kreuk', 'who', 'WB', 'new', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'admit', 'am', 'one', 'people', 'even', 'found', 'rather', 'cast', 'bio', 'DVD', 'Neutrogena', 'commercial', 'Anyhow', 'Kreuk', 'little', 'do', 'sit', 'look', 'pretty', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'emotion', 'flair', 'commercial', 'one', 'who', 'show', 'Richardson', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'when', 'actress', 'caliber', 'choice', 'role', 'wicked', 'queen', 'fairy', 'tale', 'was', 'doubt', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'then', 'Richardson', 'who', 'scale', 'direction', 'Snow', 'White', 'Fairest', 'Them', 'All', 'certainly', 'worth', 'look', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'new', 'case', 'extremely', 'old', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales']",Snow White - The Fairest of Them All

I mean, it stars Smallville's very own Kristen Kreuk!  I've never felt so ripped-off in my entire life.Where to begin with the problems?  First of all, there's some weird genie character who's freed from a frozen lake - yes, a lake - by the tears of Snow White's father.  Don't expect to find out why that genie was put there, just be happy that he's there to move the ""story"" along... and turn the father into a king with a kingdom and a queen.But get this, this queen is really the genie's just-as-ugly sister who is desperate to be beautiful.  She gets her wish as part of the new king's wish to have a queen, but evidently the king doesn't lover her.  So, to make the king love her - and you're gonna LOVE this one - the genie tells his sister to break her mirror.  She does this, and all of a sudden, it starts raining mirror shards in the garden, where the king is seen running for cover.  Before he can escape, a shard of mirror falls into his eye and now he's head-over-heals for the queen.  Oh and wait till you learn just how long that shard stays in his eye. (I need a laughing smiley here.)I won't spoil the rest of this waste of technology for you die-hard fantasy fans.  I'll just leave at these cons:1. The music is lackluster2. The acting is pathetic.

I recall begging my mother to read it to me all the time when I was little, and my cousin and I often acting out the famous sceen where the evil queen gives Snow White the poisoned apple. The exceptionally wonderful retelling of the story provided much food for thought, and was extremely entertaining. All of the actors/actresses do verry well with the characters they portray, Miranda Richardson deserving a deafening round of applause for her portrayal of the evil queen Elspeth. It requires a lot of acting ability to portray a villain or villainness, and Richardson obviously enjoys her role. I feel both sympathy and anger toward her character, who is twisted in to a monster because she allows her envy to take control resulting in her ruination. I especially liked the dwarfs in this film, because they provided humor and were delightful characters. It may be interesting to note that one of the dwarfs is a girl, and that all of them are named after days of the week. Kristin Krook is verry good in her role of Snow White, showing the human side of the beautiful princess, and portraying her gentle inward beauty as well as her outward. She also does well at showing a vulnerable side to Snow White that is usually not portrayed. I do not neccessarily think this movie is particularly dark, as some have claimed, however it does provide a more indepth study of the darker side of human nature.

It is also the one with the most magic, and is one of Hallmark's better movies.  Snow White this time is born of by the prick of a rose on her mother's finger.  Childbirth kills the mother and sends the father out into the cold winter with his daughter.  Their desperation brings one of Satan's servants to life, who grants the father three wishes (what other number could it be).  The first two wishes turn out well, but the third brings forth Elspeth, i.e. the wicked stepmother.  Baby Snow White senses the evil stepmother immediately by crying when they are about to touch.  What ensues is a lifelong rivalry in which Elspeth uses her magic to slowly take over the kingdom.  This includes her mirror, which can fly.  The seven dwarfs are not all short, but instead they now represent the 7 colors of the rainbow, and hence can travel across distances by ""rainbowing"" themselve.  Animals of various sorts get involved, and the battle climaxes with the poisoned apple.  Elspeth's evil is undone by the love of a prince, and Elspeth herself is taken down by her own evil creations.The movie is about two hours long, and moves briskly along from one scene to the next.  There is no singing, instead the music is orchestral in the style of classical Romance.  The cinematography is great and the special effects are quite nice and believable.

697486,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000640T0,Only-A-Child,"[5, 5]","SPOILERS: This is not nearly as bad as it sounds. When you figure that Disney's Snow White is one of the top 50 U.S. films of all time (and the best thing Disney has ever done), you can understand why Hallmark and writer/director Caroline Thompson (who did such a good job on Black Beauty and Edward Scissorhands) would not want to do that version of the fairy tale. And unlike Alice in Wonderland, Snow White is not sacred material; not only has it changed drastically over the past 180+ years, but versions of the basic storyline are present in the folklore of many different countries and languages. The Hallmark version is much closer to the original (and darker) Brothers Grimm story. So the best way to watch this is to put aside any preconceived notions and view it with an open mind.One thing it has going for it is that the production designer did the usual Hallmark fairy tale magic with the look of the thing. Very nice.Casting was a little weak. Kristan Kreuk's performance as the title character is feeble; the director should have been able to get a whole lot more from her, but Miranda Richardson as the Evil Queen was wonderful. Fortunately the story is centered around the Queen, and Richardson is able carry the whole film. I don't know if this was by design or was done in post, they may have trimmed a lot of Kreuk's stuff when they realized it was so awful. But at least they worked hard with the lighting and the digital color correction to lighten Kreuk's complexion-she is still not physically believable as Snow White (not even close to lips as red as blood and skin white as the snow) but the disparity is not as bad as expected. And Kruck is such a sterile non-sensuous beauty that she fits the antiseptic way in which the director apparently wanted to under-portray the character.Vincent Schiavelli who stole the show in ""Ghost"" also steals all the seven dwarf scenes.Vera Farmiga does a great job as Snow White's mother, especially when she plays the Queen impersonating the mother. In fact, the best scene of the film is when she is trying to convince Snow White to eat the apple-some really great shot framing and editing. Interestingly, in the original story it was the mother (not a step-mother) who was trying to kill Snow White,The ending is a bit anti-climatic as it almost instantly goes from everything being totally bleak to everything being right with the kingdom. And this happens not because of any action from the heroes or in any sort of suspenseful way, the Queen just undoes herself by reaching too far. While this supports the 'its what's inside each of us that's important' theme, it cheats the viewer out of an interestingly evolving resolution.If you ignore Kreuk (who became a decent actress-or at least much better than anyone could have guessed from this performance) and prepare yourself for a rather 'nothing' ending, you should enjoy this tale.Then again, what do I know?

697487,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0000640T0,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[34, 38]","I have very mixed feelings about this particular Brothers Grimm adaptation. First, I must consider that in the past Fairy Tales have been far from mediocre tales about sanity. Often they are warnings about our most inner desires bringing us certain destruction. This movie deals with jealousy and innocence, kindness and evil.Caroline Thompson has a great concept at work here, but in places the script falls prey to the clich&eacute;. The acting would have been better if the script had been more mature. They seemed to want to make this for children and I could not help hearing the Barney song in the background of my mind when I saw the rainbow and politically correct admonitions. I was disappointed in her naming the dwarfs after the days of the week. I think the names Disney gave the dwarfs were more interesting and would have given them stronger personalities. The acting would have seemed better if all the characters had been given a much stronger script. Yet, this adaptation seems to be reaching further into the past than Disney ever envisioned.The salvation is in the creativity with which the story is told. It is visually appealing and once you watch the extras on the DVD you will realize this was a low-budget production.The mirror is fascinating. Not only are there a variety of mirrors, the mirror is broken at one point and contains magical properties. This mirror then becomes a transporter, video camera and weapon. It is no longer just a ""mirror, mirror on the wall."" The scenes of ""raining glass"" were wonderfully creative along with the sound effects.The artificiality of some scenes lend themselves to the ""Fairy Tale"" appeal. The very fact that the characters are not completely believable at times gives them a certain freedom to be completely evil or completely good.Snow White (Kristin Kreuk) is incredibly beautiful, but almost solemn in her awakening to the world. She has an almost gothic appeal. As a baby, she is born into a world where apple blossoms fall from the trees into a pond near her home and red rose bushes almost envelope the cottage. Her father John (Tom Irwin) is desperate to save her life after his wife dies after childbirth and tries to make it to a close village. He almost fails and yet his tears awaken a creature frozen beneath the ice. This bewitched creature is able to fulfill wishes like a genie and gives him three wishes. He also unfortunately has a sister who is not quite so kind.Even as a baby, Snow White was able to sense evil intentions and disliked her new mother-in-law Elspeth (Miranda Richardson) who is part of the wish-fulfillment plot.In the original story in German, Snow white is born as a princess. In this adaptation, she inherits her royalty through magical means. When the huntsman is told to kill Snow White the new queen asks for her liver and lungs. In this adaptation parents might not appreciate their young children seeing the queen eating ""what she thinks"" is Snow White's heart.When the queen finds out Snow White is still alive, she poses as her dead mother instead of a witch. Offering an apple to someone has been known to be a declaration of love or deceit. In this movie, it spells certain death. Snow White is buried in ice instead of a glass coffin.The queen is not transformed back into her true self until the end of the movie when she is subject to the violence of the ""garden gnomes"" that come to life to seek revenge. In the real story, she dances to her death in a pair of iron slippers which would not have been enjoyable to watch onscreen. The violence of the gnomes is more ""implied.""This is not a calm, happy movie but does have a happy, yet questionable ending. Would any father let such a young daughter ride away with a prince? I think not. In the real story, Snow White grows into an adult while in the coffin. Her hair is still black as ebony, her lips as red as blood and her skin as white as snow.This movie does contain some violent content I don't think ""very young"" children should be exposed to although I imagine they might miss some of the implied meanings. This should have been rated PG in some instances in my own mind.Otherwise, there are elements in this story I really enjoyed, especially the magical elements incorporated into the mirror, castle, roses, forest and the inclusion of various intriguing elements not seen in a Snow White movie to date.~The Rebecca Review",4,Jealousy Exposed & Happiness Postponed,1041552000,"01 3, 2003",2003,4398,"['have', 'very', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'particular', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'adaptation', 'First', 'must', 'consider', 'past', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'mediocre', 'tales', 'sanity', 'are', 'warnings', 'most', 'inner', 'desires', 'bringing', 'certain', 'destruction', 'movie', 'jealousy', 'innocence', 'kindness', 'evil.Caroline', 'Thompson', 'great', 'concept', 'work', 'here', 'places', 'script', 'clich', 'eacute', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'mature', 'seemed', 'want', 'make', 'children', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'hearing', 'Barney', 'song', 'background', 'mind', 'when', 'saw', 'rainbow', 'politically', 'correct', 'admonitions', 'was', 'disappointed', 'naming', 'dwarfs', 'days', 'week', 'think', 'names', 'Disney', 'gave', 'dwarfs', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'stronger', 'personalities', 'acting', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'better', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'much', 'stronger', 'script', 'adaptation', 'be', 'reaching', 'further', 'past', 'Disney', 'ever', 'salvation', 'creativity', 'story', 'told', 'visually', 'appealing', 'once', 'watch', 'extras', 'DVD', 'will', 'realize', 'was', 'low-budget', 'production.The', 'mirror', 'fascinating', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'there', 'variety', 'mirrors', 'mirror', 'broken', 'one', 'point', 'magical', 'properties', 'mirror', 'then', 'transporter', 'video', 'camera', 'weapon', 'no', 'longer', 'just', 'mirror', 'mirror', 'wall', 'scenes', 'raining', 'glass', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'creative', 'sound', 'effects.The', 'artificiality', 'scenes', 'lend', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'appeal', 'very', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'completely', 'believable', 'times', 'certain', 'freedom', 'be', 'completely', 'evil', 'completely', 'good.Snow', 'White', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'solemn', 'awakening', 'world', 'almost', 'gothic', 'appeal', 'baby', 'born', 'world', 'where', 'apple', 'blossoms', 'fall', 'trees', 'pond', 'home', 'red', 'rose', 'bushes', 'almost', 'envelope', 'cottage', 'father', 'John', 'Tom', 'Irwin', 'desperate', 'save', 'life', 'wife', 'dies', 'childbirth', 'tries', 'make', 'close', 'village', 'almost', 'yet', 'tears', 'awaken', 'creature', 'frozen', 'ice', 'bewitched', 'creature', 'able', 'fulfill', 'wishes', 'genie', 'three', 'wishes', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'kind.Even', 'baby', 'Snow', 'White', 'was', 'able', 'sense', 'evil', 'intentions', 'disliked', 'new', 'mother-in-law', 'Elspeth', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'who', 'part', 'wish-fulfillment', 'plot.In', 'original', 'story', 'German', 'Snow', 'white', 'born', 'princess', 'adaptation', 'royalty', 'magical', 'means', 'When', 'huntsman', 'told', 'kill', 'Snow', 'White', 'new', 'queen', 'asks', 'liver', 'lungs', 'adaptation', 'parents', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'young', 'children', 'seeing', 'queen', 'eating', 'what', 'Snow', 'White', 'heart.When', 'queen', 'out', 'Snow', 'White', 'still', 'alive', 'dead', 'mother', 'instead', 'witch', 'Offering', 'apple', 'someone', 'been', 'known', 'be', 'declaration', 'love', 'deceit', 'movie', 'certain', 'death', 'Snow', 'White', 'buried', 'ice', 'instead', 'glass', 'coffin.The', 'queen', 'not', 'transformed', 'back', 'true', 'self', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'subject', 'violence', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'come', 'life', 'seek', 'revenge', 'real', 'story', 'death', 'pair', 'iron', 'slippers', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'onscreen', 'violence', 'gnomes', 'more', 'implied', 'not', 'calm', 'happy', 'movie', 'have', 'happy', 'yet', 'questionable', 'ending', 'Would', 'father', 'let', 'young', 'daughter', 'ride', 'away', 'prince', 'think', 'not', 'real', 'story', 'Snow', 'White', 'adult', 'coffin', 'hair', 'still', 'black', 'ebony', 'lips', 'as', 'red', 'blood', 'skin', 'as', 'white', 'snow.This', 'movie', 'contain', 'violent', 'content', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'young', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'exposed', 'imagine', 'might', 'miss', 'implied', 'meanings', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'PG', 'instances', 'own', 'mind.Otherwise', 'are', 'elements', 'story', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'magical', 'elements', 'incorporated', 'mirror', 'castle', 'roses', 'forest', 'inclusion', 'various', 'intriguing', 'elements', 'not', 'seen', 'Snow', 'White', 'movie', 'date.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Snow White - The Fairest of Them All

The storyline is as confusing as the six foot dwarf who appears in the movie. Even though the costumes or scenery may be beautyful the rest of the film is poorly layed out. As far as sticking to the original brothers grimm fairy tale the movie leaves out the basic backgroud. Instead it has a lot of new and ridiculous characters who have nothing to do with Snow white. Some may find it interessting but for myself who prefers the brothers grimms tales the way they were intended, this film was a dissapointment. And when the prince was turned into a bear I had to laugh at the poor attempt of the directors,who appeared to try adding a part of the brothers grimms snow white and rose red which is a different tale all together. All in all the acting by Kristen was unsatisfactory. It would have been a better performance had she left out lines like &quot;Why?&quot; or &quot;How? I don't understand&quot; during the most dramatic scenes. If she had used more emotion perhaps her script would have worked but as it was, Snow white's personality was made out to be , not only naive but bubble headed beyond discription. the only redeeming character was miranda richards who as always gave an excellent performance.Children may find amusment in this movie but if you are looking for a decent fairy tale this DVD is a bad choice.",2,A failed attempt of a fairy tale,1064966400,"10 1, 2003",2003,1407,"['got', 'hold', 'DVD', 'library', ""'m"", 'glad', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'storyline', 'as', 'confusing', 'six', 'foot', 'dwarf', 'who', 'movie', 'Even', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'may', 'be', 'beautyful', 'rest', 'film', 'poorly', 'layed', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'sticking', 'original', 'brothers', 'grimm', 'fairy', 'movie', 'out', 'basic', 'backgroud', 'Instead', 'lot', 'new', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'Snow', 'white', 'may', 'find', 'interessting', 'who', 'brothers', 'grimms', 'way', 'were', 'intended', 'film', 'was', 'dissapointment', 'when', 'prince', 'was', 'turned', 'bear', 'had', 'laugh', 'poor', 'attempt', 'directors', 'who', 'appeared', 'try', 'adding', 'part', 'brothers', 'grimms', 'snow', 'white', 'rose', 'red', 'different', 'tale', 'together', 'acting', 'Kristen', 'was', 'unsatisfactory', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'performance', 'had', 'left', 'out', 'lines', 'quot', 'Why', 'quot', 'quot', 'How', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'quot', 'most', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'had', 'used', 'more', 'emotion', 'perhaps', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'was', 'Snow', 'white', 'personality', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'naive', 'bubble', 'headed', 'discription', 'only', 'redeeming', 'character', 'was', 'miranda', 'richards', 'who', 'always', 'gave', 'excellent', 'performance.Children', 'may', 'find', 'amusment', 'movie', 'are', 'looking', 'decent', 'fairy', 'tale', 'DVD', 'bad', 'choice']",Snow White - The Fairest of Them All
697489,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0000640T0,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[15, 15]","Though there are some serious deviations to this new version of the Snow White fairytale, on the whole I enjoyed watching it, especially in terms of its beautiful visual style. As most reviewers have already said, everything in the scenes are bright and colourful, yet ornate and whimsical, giving it a truly fairytale feel. Costumes in particular are lovely whether it be the rainbow outfits of the dwarves or Snow White's own princess-wardrobe.The story harks back more to the Grimm's fairytale, and so is perhaps not for younger viewers (though kids get very little credit these days - if they can watch the Queen's transformation scene in the Disney version of ""Snow White"", I think they could deal with this). The wood-dwelling couple John and Josephine give birth to a baby daughter according to Jo's wishes when she pricked her finger on a rosebush: a child with hair black as ebony, lips red as blood and skin as white as snow.However when the difficult birth takes Jo's life, John is forced to leave their home to fetch milk for his daughter. He stumbles through the snow, unable to find the village and only survives when his tears melt the icy prison of the Green-Eyed Granter of Wishes, who grants John three wishes in gratitude. Hardly able to believe the situation, John wishes for milk, a kingdom and his queen. The first two are easy work for the genie, but for John's 'queen', the genie goes to his sister Elspeth, an ugly wench who lives to spread misery over the forest creatures (she has a garden of 'real' garden gnomes!) Transforming her into a beautiful woman she gleefully forces John to fall in love with her through the use of a magic mirror, leaving her with a husband to manipulate, a kingdom to rule, and a stepdaughter to hate...The movie actually adds quite a lot of components from the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale ""The Snow Queen"", namely the role of the mirror. When Elspeth shatters it, two shards fly into John - one in his eye and one into his heart - the same thing that happens to Kay in Anderson's tale. I suspect many people were confused at the whole mirror sequence if they weren't familiar with this other story, but it is an interesting melding of stories.Miranda Richardson magnificently plays the role of Elspeth, the evil stepmother and in many ways it is she who is the star of the production. She plays her role with great pizzazz from the twisted, bitter hag to the joyful maiden to the jealous and suspecting wife. Tom Irwin is a little hen-pecked as John, but ultimately we feel more sympathy than scorn for him. Unfortunately Kirstin Kreuk plays Snow White rather stiffly - though she is a perfect casting choice in terms of physical appearance. However, in Kreuk's defence it is one the most difficult things in the world to play virtuous, perfect heroines, simply because they appear rather boring on the screen (especially when surrounded by more fascinating villains). The dwarfs are a little silly (their connection with rainbows makes them look like extras on ""Barney the Dinosaur"") but most will be amused to recognise Warwick Davis (""Willow"").In keeping in line with the Grimm's story, the movie does include the sash that squeezes the breath out of Snow White as well as the famous apple, but unfortunately not the poisoned comb. Other interesting directions are taken by the movie-makers: instead of an old hag, Elspeth approaches Snow White as her dead mother, and as well as the colours of the rainbow, the dwarfs are named after the days of the week (and include a normal-sized Wednesday). The Prince is given a bit more of a back-story than simply entering at the end (he even gets a name!), but there are some loose ends not quite wrapped up and Elspeth's ultimate fate is a little silly.Yet overall I enjoyed this movie, if not just for its gorgeous appearance which is made more amazing considering the very small budget for this movie. I watch it just to look at it: the elegant yet simple palace to the quiet, peaceful woodlands; the elaborate costumes, the colourful makeup, the subtle yet beautiful special effects, I could go on...",3,"""Who is the Fairest of them All?""",1112659200,"04 5, 2005",2005,4112,"['are', 'serious', 'deviations', 'new', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'fairytale', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'especially', 'terms', 'beautiful', 'visual', 'style', 'most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'everything', 'scenes', 'are', 'bright', 'colourful', 'yet', 'ornate', 'whimsical', 'giving', 'truly', 'fairytale', 'feel', 'Costumes', 'particular', 'are', 'lovely', 'be', 'rainbow', 'outfits', 'dwarves', 'Snow', 'White', 'own', 'princess-wardrobe.The', 'story', 'harks', 'back', 'more', 'Grimm', 'fairytale', 'so', 'perhaps', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers', 'kids', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'credit', 'days', 'can', 'watch', 'Queen', 'transformation', 'scene', 'Disney', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'think', 'could', 'deal', 'wood-dwelling', 'couple', 'John', 'Josephine', 'give', 'birth', 'baby', 'daughter', 'according', 'Jo', 'wishes', 'when', 'pricked', 'finger', 'rosebush', 'child', 'hair', 'black', 'ebony', 'lips', 'red', 'blood', 'skin', 'as', 'white', 'snow.However', 'when', 'difficult', 'birth', 'Jo', 'life', 'John', 'forced', 'leave', 'home', 'fetch', 'milk', 'daughter', 'snow', 'unable', 'find', 'village', 'only', 'when', 'tears', 'melt', 'icy', 'prison', 'Green-Eyed', 'Granter', 'Wishes', 'who', 'John', 'three', 'wishes', 'gratitude', 'Hardly', 'able', 'believe', 'situation', 'John', 'milk', 'kingdom', 'queen', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'easy', 'work', 'genie', 'John', ""'queen"", 'genie', 'sister', 'Elspeth', 'ugly', 'wench', 'who', 'spread', 'misery', 'forest', 'creatures', 'garden', ""'real"", 'garden', 'gnomes', 'Transforming', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'gleefully', 'John', 'fall', 'love', 'use', 'magic', 'mirror', 'leaving', 'husband', 'manipulate', 'kingdom', 'rule', 'stepdaughter', 'hate', 'movie', 'actually', 'lot', 'components', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'fairytale', 'Snow', 'Queen', 'namely', 'role', 'mirror', 'When', 'Elspeth', 'two', 'shards', 'fly', 'John', 'one', 'eye', 'one', 'heart', 'same', 'thing', 'Kay', 'Anderson', 'tale', 'suspect', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'confused', 'whole', 'mirror', 'sequence', 'were', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'other', 'story', 'interesting', 'melding', 'stories.Miranda', 'Richardson', 'magnificently', 'role', 'Elspeth', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'many', 'ways', 'who', 'star', 'production', 'role', 'great', 'pizzazz', 'twisted', 'bitter', 'hag', 'joyful', 'maiden', 'jealous', 'suspecting', 'wife', 'Tom', 'Irwin', 'little', 'hen-pecked', 'John', 'ultimately', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathy', 'scorn', 'Unfortunately', 'Kirstin', 'Kreuk', 'Snow', 'White', 'rather', 'stiffly', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choice', 'terms', 'physical', 'appearance', 'However', 'Kreuk', 'defence', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'things', 'world', 'play', 'virtuous', 'perfect', 'heroines', 'simply', 'appear', 'rather', 'boring', 'screen', 'especially', 'when', 'surrounded', 'more', 'fascinating', 'villains', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'little', 'silly', 'connection', 'rainbows', 'look', 'extras', 'Barney', 'Dinosaur', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'amused', 'recognise', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'Willow', '.In', 'keeping', 'line', 'Grimm', 'story', 'movie', 'include', 'sash', 'breath', 'Snow', 'White', 'as', 'well', 'famous', 'apple', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'poisoned', 'comb', 'Other', 'interesting', 'directions', 'are', 'taken', 'movie-makers', 'instead', 'old', 'hag', 'Elspeth', 'Snow', 'White', 'dead', 'mother', 'as', 'well', 'colours', 'rainbow', 'dwarfs', 'are', 'named', 'days', 'week', 'include', 'normal-sized', 'Wednesday', 'Prince', 'given', 'bit', 'more', 'back-story', 'simply', 'entering', 'end', 'even', 'name', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'not', 'quite', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Elspeth', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'little', 'silly.Yet', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'appearance', 'made', 'more', 'amazing', 'considering', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'movie', 'watch', 'just', 'look', 'elegant', 'yet', 'simple', 'palace', 'quiet', 'peaceful', 'woodlands', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'colourful', 'makeup', 'subtle', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'go']",Snow White - The Fairest of Them All

Miranda was great as the evil queen, but everyone else was horrible! Not even the guy who played Willow could save the day! Let me tell you why it was so bad. The story line starts out great, we've got some weird guy granting wishes to snow whites dad to save her from dying. Miranda as the witch finally becomes beautiful. And the gnomes in the garden really crack me up. But as Snow White grows up she has no substance. Plus the fact that she cant act worth anything does not help to all of her like 10 lines in the movie. The prince can act better than snow white but it's not much of a save. Their romance is too forced. Eventually he turns into a bear anyway so we can see an animal which does a better job of expressing emotions. The digital effects in this movie aren't bad, I mean the mirror flying around was just a little too much though. I wish there was more character development. And then let me get to the dwarves. Naming them for the days of the week? Okay that's just ridiculous. The movie is just very odd. It had a great point to it, don't get me wrong. I felt spoiled after seeing the version of Snow White with Sigorney Weaver in it ""Snow White, A tale of Terror"" This movie was fantastic! It's also way cheaper than buying this version of Snow White which really sucks so bad. I'm very open to fantasy films when they are done right! SO definetly check out Snow White with Sigorney Weaver and the 10th Kingdom. These are WAY better fairytale movies!",2,Don't waste your time or money on this version...,1125705600,"09 3, 2005",2005,1571,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'sale', 'thought', 'oh', 'wow', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'be', 'good', 'right', 'Wrong', 'Miranda', 'was', 'great', 'evil', 'queen', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'horrible', 'Not', 'even', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Willow', 'could', 'save', 'day', 'Let', 'tell', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'story', 'line', 'out', 'great', ""'ve"", 'got', 'weird', 'guy', 'granting', 'wishes', 'snow', 'whites', 'dad', 'save', 'dying', 'Miranda', 'witch', 'finally', 'beautiful', 'gnomes', 'garden', 'really', 'crack', 'up', 'Snow', 'White', 'up', 'substance', 'fact', 'cant', 'act', 'worth', 'anything', 'not', 'help', '10', 'lines', 'movie', 'prince', 'can', 'act', 'better', 'snow', 'white', 'not', 'much', 'save', 'romance', 'too', 'forced', 'Eventually', 'bear', 'anyway', 'can', 'see', 'animal', 'better', 'job', 'expressing', 'emotions', 'digital', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'mean', 'mirror', 'flying', 'around', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'let', 'get', 'dwarves', 'Naming', 'days', 'week', 'Okay', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'just', 'very', 'odd', 'had', 'great', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'felt', 'spoiled', 'seeing', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'Sigorney', 'Weaver', 'Snow', 'White', 'A', 'tale', 'Terror', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'also', 'way', 'cheaper', 'buying', 'version', 'Snow', 'White', 'really', 'so', 'bad', ""'m"", 'very', 'open', 'fantasy', 'films', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'right', 'SO', 'definetly', 'check', 'out', 'Snow', 'White', 'Sigorney', 'Weaver', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'are', 'WAY', 'better', 'fairytale', 'movies']",Snow White - The Fairest of Them All
