As it commenced, I smiled, one of those quiet smiles that comes so spontaneously when one hears something exceptionally pleasant. I sat down. When it was over I telephoned one of my dearest friends, with an invitation to watch it with me. She came over about a week later and we watched it together. What a joy. Great video. Good job, Brother Gaither! A blessed experience. Ivan Parker is always good, but this solo contribution was outstanding. The GVB had three songs; all three with feeling, for sure. ""My Lord and I - Little is Much when God is in It - Worthy the Lamb.""  Linda sang one of my favorites, and then sang a second song with her little girl accompanying. Dixon and Sheri Easter? Yeah. And Reggie twice, once accompanied by his delightful wife,Ladylove. It was for me, without and with and my friend, a time of worship; it was a time of happiness, and I would not have missed it. One of the best. No doubt about it, -tears and all.",5,Gaither videos,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,982,"['put', 'DVD', 'turned', 'commenced', 'smiled', 'one', 'quiet', 'smiles', 'so', 'spontaneously', 'when', 'one', 'something', 'exceptionally', 'pleasant', 'sat', 'down', 'When', 'was', 'telephoned', 'one', 'dearest', 'friends', 'invitation', 'watch', 'came', 'over', 'week', 'later', 'watched', 'together', 'What', 'joy', 'Great', 'video', 'Good', 'job', 'Brother', 'Gaither', 'blessed', 'experience', 'Ivan', 'Parker', 'always', 'good', 'solo', 'contribution', 'was', 'outstanding', 'GVB', 'had', 'three', 'songs', 'three', 'feeling', 'sure', 'Lord', 'Little', 'Much', 'when', 'God', 'Lamb', 'Linda', 'sang', 'one', 'favorites', 'then', 'sang', 'second', 'song', 'little', 'girl', 'accompanying', 'Dixon', 'Sheri', 'Easter', 'Yeah', 'Reggie', 'twice', 'once', 'accompanied', 'delightful', 'wife', 'Ladylove', 'was', 'friend', 'time', 'worship', 'was', 'time', 'happiness', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'missed', 'One', 'best', 'doubt', '-tears']",N/A
