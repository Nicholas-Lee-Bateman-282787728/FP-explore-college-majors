I used to run home to watch the club  and it's serials like S & M, Annette, Hardy Boys, etc. So I bought this DVD set pre  book.The good news is the 25 episodes of the first year of Spin & Marty are all here in their glory. The black and white masters are CLEAN and like they were watching them as if they were new.The soundtrack is clear as a bell, digital remastering at its finest. A highlight of the DVD extra is the special  Mickey Mouse Club that introduced that show from 1955.Now to the BAD news... The extras are so limited. The Harry Carey interview ssem to be taken from an interview host Leonard Malin used on John Wayne's Island in the Sky. The current interview with Spin and Marty  (Tim Considine and David Stollery) seems an afterthought. Also the episodes used to have a tale (a closer), when a voice would say ""tommorrow episode is..."", Those seem to be cut off from the episodes in this collectionThere are NO advance trailers (other than the MMC espisode intro), Reprint comics, TV ads, Disneyanna from other shows, special audio tracks like the vault Disney collections have had (like an audio story), maybe a copy  The TV remake of Spin and Marty from  a few years ago or any of those extras like audio comments over an episode from someone in the cast.

933320,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000ATQYUQ,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","American kids of circa 1955 had cut their teeth on B-Western TV series like ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Rin Tin Tin"" and matinees of B films dating back to the '30's, and in that year two new ""adult"" examples of the genre, ""Gunsmoke"" and ""Cheyenne,"" joined the lineup.  So it's hardly surprising that every red-blooded American kid, boy or girl, annually begged Santa Claus for a pony, and that the idea of spending even a week on a dude ranch would have been a dream come true for many.  In the very first season of his afternoon kiddie variety show, ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" and in its first (and one of its most beloved) serials, Walt Disney played off this dream with the story of a group of boys who get to spend the entire summer at the Triple-R, a combination dude ranch and summer camp, learning to ride and rope.  Despite its title, there's not really much ""adventure"" to the story, which focuses chiefly on Spin Evans (Tim Considine), the most popular boy on the place, and newcomer Marty Markham (David Stollery).  Marty's mother died when he was a year old, his father in action at sea during the recent war, and he's been raised by a wealthy and overprotective grandmother who, persuaded against her better judgment to send him to Triple-R (owner Logan (Roy Barcroft) was a comrade-in-arms of his father's), salves her conscience by ordering the family butler, Perkins (J. Pat O'Malley), to go along and ""do for him.""  Marty's ""never been to regular school"" and knows very little about getting along with other kids, and the 25 brief chapters of the series are concerned mainly with his development as he learns to make friends, conquer his fear of horses (with the help of Ollie (Leonard P. Geer), the ranch wrangler, and Bill Burnett (Harry Carey, Jr.), the counselor for his bunkhouse, plus Skyrocket, the handsome and clever palomino assigned to him), ignore his own selfish impulses, stick to a project, and eventually even fake injury to give Spin--never his favorite person!--a chance to win a free summer at the ranch in the season-concluding rodeo competition with its great rival, North Fork.  Besides this main thread, there are various subplots turning on the other boys, like Marty's incongruously-nicknamed first friend Ambitious (B. G. Norman), who'd generally rather be napping or reading comic books; Speckle (Tim Hartnagel), an amateur naturalist who collects every living thing he can get his hands on; Freddie (Roger Broaddus), one of the youngest campers, who takes great pride in the fancy cowboy boots his father sends him and whom Marty rescues when his horse is hornet-stung and bolts; Louie, Pinky, Biff, Joe, Al, Gerald, Russell ""the Muscle,"" and others--and on Perkins, who's even more of a tenderfoot than his ""Master Martin"" and ends up helping Sam, the Chinese cook, in the kitchen and being unmercifully teased by Ollie.  The series was so popular that Disney ended up making such continuing stories a regular feature of the ""Mickey Mouse Club,"" and making two sequels over the next two seasons; the second can already be put on your watchlist at IMDB, so there's some hope that it may also be made available on DVD eventually.",4,An exercise in nostalgia,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,3167,"['American', 'kids', 'circa', '1955', 'had', 'cut', 'teeth', 'B-Western', 'TV', 'series', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'Rin', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'matinees', 'B', 'films', 'dating', 'back', ""'30"", 'year', 'two', 'new', 'adult', 'examples', 'genre', 'Gunsmoke', 'Cheyenne', 'joined', 'lineup', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'kid', 'boy', 'girl', 'annually', 'begged', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'pony', 'idea', 'spending', 'even', 'week', 'dude', 'ranch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'many', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'afternoon', 'kiddie', 'variety', 'show', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'first', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'serials', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'played', 'off', 'dream', 'story', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'get', 'spend', 'entire', 'summer', 'Triple-R', 'combination', 'dude', 'ranch', 'summer', 'camp', 'learning', 'ride', 'rope', 'title', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'adventure', 'story', 'chiefly', 'Spin', 'Evans', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'most', 'popular', 'boy', 'place', 'newcomer', 'Marty', 'Markham', 'David', 'Stollery', 'Marty', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'year', 'old', 'father', 'action', 'sea', 'recent', 'war', 'been', 'raised', 'wealthy', 'overprotective', 'grandmother', 'who', 'persuaded', 'better', 'judgment', 'send', 'Triple-R', 'owner', 'Logan', 'Roy', 'Barcroft', 'was', 'comrade-in-arms', 'father', 'conscience', 'ordering', 'family', 'butler', 'Perkins', 'J.', 'Pat', ""O'Malley"", 'go', 'along', 'do', 'Marty', 'never', 'been', 'regular', 'school', 'very', 'little', 'getting', 'along', 'other', 'kids', '25', 'brief', 'chapters', 'series', 'are', 'concerned', 'mainly', 'development', 'make', 'friends', 'conquer', 'fear', 'horses', 'help', 'Ollie', 'Leonard', 'P.', 'Geer', 'ranch', 'wrangler', 'Bill', 'Burnett', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'counselor', 'bunkhouse', 'Skyrocket', 'handsome', 'clever', 'palomino', 'assigned', 'ignore', 'own', 'selfish', 'impulses', 'stick', 'project', 'eventually', 'even', 'fake', 'injury', 'give', 'Spin', 'never', 'favorite', 'person', 'chance', 'win', 'free', 'summer', 'ranch', 'season-concluding', 'rodeo', 'competition', 'great', 'rival', 'North', 'Fork', 'main', 'thread', 'are', 'various', 'subplots', 'turning', 'other', 'boys', 'Marty', 'incongruously-nicknamed', 'first', 'friend', 'Ambitious', 'B.', 'G.', 'Norman', 'who', ""'d"", 'generally', 'rather', 'be', 'napping', 'reading', 'comic', 'books', 'Speckle', 'Tim', 'Hartnagel', 'amateur', 'naturalist', 'who', 'living', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'Freddie', 'Roger', 'Broaddus', 'one', 'youngest', 'campers', 'who', 'great', 'pride', 'fancy', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'father', 'whom', 'Marty', 'rescues', 'when', 'horse', 'hornet-stung', 'bolts', 'Louie', 'Pinky', 'Biff', 'Joe', 'Al', 'Gerald', 'Russell', 'Muscle', 'others', 'Perkins', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'tenderfoot', 'Master', 'Martin', 'up', 'helping', 'Sam', 'Chinese', 'cook', 'kitchen', 'being', 'unmercifully', 'teased', 'Ollie', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'Disney', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'such', 'continuing', 'stories', 'regular', 'feature', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'making', 'two', 'sequels', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'second', 'can', 'already', 'be', 'put', 'watchlist', 'IMDB', 'hope', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'eventually']",N/A

The Spin and Marty episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. All 25 black and white episodes that made up the first season are here and they look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now I find it charming and fun.The first disc includes the first 10 of the episodes from season one and while I wasn't aware of this part of the MMC show, I found these episodes really interesting and fun to watch now. Each episode is approx. 11 minutes long so those of you with ADD can easily get through these without going bonkers! I watched this entire two disc set in one sitting. Along with the episodes on disc one are four extras, the first is a great one, episode #25 of MMC that introduced the Spin and Marty series, a screen test for Tom Considine and two galleries one on merchandise and the other behind the scenes.The second disc hold the remaining 15 episodes from season one which look a good as the episodes on disc one. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release season two and three to complete the series.

It would have been nice if the Disney studio executives had of spliced all these mini-episodes into one feature length movie.  But I guess the fans would have seen just how short these features really are, and would have wondered; why didn't they just release all of the ""Spin & Marty"" shows in one 2 disc edition?  I don't know if these episodes would even make up a full hour of viewing.  I hope Disney releases the remaining Spin & Marty seasons, as well as ""The Hardy Boys,"" which was my second favorite serial.

933325,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000ATQYUQ,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[28, 32]","Just five weeks into TV airtime in 1955, The Mickey Mouse Club unveiled its first serial,""The Adventures of Spin and Marty"". In the very first episode, Spin talks about being at the Triple R Ranch the previous summer, so it seems like the series is already going, and doesn't seem like a first episode. While alluding to the backstory, the episode also sets up the conflict between Spin and Marty Markham, so right out of the box it's exciting.A high point of the Disney Treasures series are the introductions by Leonard Maltin, but he's really excited about this show and delves far deeper than the brief bits on some other Treasures DVDs. In his book, The Disney Films, he says that this was the most popular serial from the Mickey Mouse Club, and calls it ""an excellent story about two boys and their life at a summer ranch."" Tim Considine would also go on to star in the Hardy Boys serial.Besides the additional features listed, this two disc set contains all 25 episodes of the first season which aired daily on ABC on the MM Club from November 7 to December 9, 1955. Although the series aired in black and white, Disney wisely filmed all his shows in color. They weren't seen in color, however, until Disney moved to NBC in 1961, when the show that in the 'fifties was called ""Disneyland"" became known instead as ""The Wonderful World of Color."" That's because NBC was owned by RCA, whose president, General David Sarnoff, had one interest: selling color television sets. The most fascinating example of this is the Ludwig Von Drake program which aired September 24, 1961, and included the outstanding educational short from 1959, ""Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land,"" (hopefully soon on DVD). The first half of the hour long show was called ""An Adventure in Color,"" with Von Drake commiserating with the poor viewers who have to watch the show on a black and white set, contrasting the inferior picture with the new marvel of dazzling color. Since Disney's earlier shows had been filmed in color, they could be rotated into the new lineup and also released theatrically. Which also means we get to watch Spin and Marty in color on this DVD.Some reviewers have complained that the metal Disney Treasures box seems flimsier on this release. If so, it's still quite sturdy. Also, one of the two discs is on a flap inside the case, but many  dual disc DVDs are packaged this way. Although Disney Treasures are only available retail for a limited time, owners can register their Treasures DVDs with Disney, which has a replacement program if discs get damaged. I join the numerous viewers who would like to see the whole run of the Mickey Mouse Club make it to DVD, including the other serials, ""Annette,"" ""The Hardy Boys,"" and ""Corky and White Shadow.""

Marty is a spoiled, pampered kid who comes to the ranch to learn a thing or two about being a man. Of course, the two world collide, in a friendly, caring Disney sort of way. The show rests on the shoulders of the two boys, Tim Considine and David Stollery, who carry their parts extremely effectively. Even better are the ranch adults, who don't fill the stereotypical ""comic"" relief (with the exception of a stereotypical Chinese cook, and the butler Perkins); they truly care about the boys.Watching the simplicity of the show, it really is asking for a remake. Bring back the original two boys as the ranch managers,  and a new set of misfit children (let's make them multicultural). It could be a great summer movie, harkening back to the time when Disney movies were about good stories and feelings, and not just special effects. It would grab the baby boomer set who still remember this series fondly, as well as those of us longing for some good family movies.",5,Back at the Ranch: a Review from the Ultimate Disney Fan,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,1561,"['kid', 'used', 'race', 'home', 'school', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'Reruns', 'actually', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'edited', 'shown', 'order', 'made', 'watching', 'serial', 'Adventures', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'rather', 'impossible', 'Still', 'was', 'Disney', 'nostalgia', 'watching', 'bunch', 'boys', 'summer', 'ranch', 'extremely', 'appealing', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'watching', 'shows', 'order', 'appeal', 'kids', 'generation', 'even', 'still', 'appeals', 'today.Spin', 'hard', 'scrappy', 'youngster', 'who', 'tail', 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'attending', 'ranch', 'summer', 'Marty', 'spoiled', 'pampered', 'kid', 'who', 'ranch', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'being', 'man', 'course', 'two', 'world', 'collide', 'friendly', 'caring', 'Disney', 'sort', 'way', 'show', 'shoulders', 'two', 'boys', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'David', 'Stollery', 'who', 'carry', 'parts', 'extremely', 'effectively', 'Even', 'better', 'are', 'ranch', 'adults', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fill', 'stereotypical', 'comic', 'relief', 'exception', 'stereotypical', 'Chinese', 'cook', 'butler', 'Perkins', 'truly', 'care', 'boys.Watching', 'simplicity', 'show', 'really', 'asking', 'remake', 'Bring', 'back', 'original', 'two', 'boys', 'ranch', 'managers', 'new', 'set', 'misfit', 'children', 'let', 'make', 'multicultural', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'summer', 'movie', 'harkening', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'Disney', 'movies', 'were', 'about', 'good', 'stories', 'feelings', 'not', 'just', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'grab', 'baby', 'boomer', 'set', 'who', 'still', 'remember', 'series', 'fondly', 'as', 'well', 'longing', 'good', 'family', 'movies']",N/A

933329,A2J74AQZCTFD52,B000ATQYUQ,"Jerry Edwards ""jebsdad""","[178, 180]","The Adventures of Spin and Marty was a 25 episode serial shown 1955-1956 during the first season of the Mickey Mouse Club. Spin Evans is the most popular boy at the boys' summer ranch, The Triple R - where boys gain actual experience on a working ranch, including learning to ride horses. Spin returns to camp after attending the previous year. Marty Markham is a rich, spoiled kid who is new to the camp. He doesn't want to be at the camp and doesn't want to play and work with the other boys. He starts off on the wrong foot with the other boys by calling the ranch a ""dirty old farm"". Marty is actually poor in many ways, and is very lonely because he just doesn't know how to act with other kids. Marty eventually learns not to be so spoiled and makes friends with several of the boys before the summer is over.The 25 episodes end up about 4 1/2 hours, with another 1/2 hour for the Mickey Mouse Club show that contains the introduction to the serial.Even though set in the 1950s, the series is timeless due to the setting of the boys' ranch. The shows deal with universal themes of friendship, understanding others, teamwork, and just getting along with others. There are numerous fun scenes throughout the series, with a very satisfactory ending to the series. This serial had two sequels: Further Adventures Of Spin And Marty (1956-1957 season) and The New Adventures Of Spin And Marty (1957-1958 season). Possibly these serials will be released in future Walt Disney Treasures within a few years.Bonus features announced as being on this set are:The complete episode of the Mickey Mouse Club that first introduced the series.Tim Considine's (Spin) original screen test.""Return To The Triple R"" - Tim Considine (Spin) and David Stollery (Marty) give an exclusive interview and tour the location that was the original ""Triple R Ranch"" filming site.""Back In The Saddle With Harry Carey Jr."" where he reminisces with Leonard Maltin. Harry Carey Jr. was Bill Burnett, the foreman of the ranch in the serial.A gallery of still frame images from the series.I have owned this serial since it was shown in the 1980s on the Disney Channel showings of the Mickey Mouse Club. I have enjoyed it for years, either watching the whole series in one sitting or just watching one or two episodes at a time. I think the DVD would work out fine however you choose to watch it.The acting, direction, and overall story are high quality.

The only way that I want to see the serials is within the hour long shows themselves. Actually, the shows ""dress up"" the serials. They put a little make-up on them. The shows take what is fairly good and make them better. If you think about it, the original directors wanted the series to be a part of the show, not seperate from it. If they had intended the series to be a seperate show,they would probably have been made differently. So, actually, those who enjoy Spin and Marty this way are, perhaps, actually enjoying and wanting what the directors and others who put the show together never wanted. So, actually watching Spin and Marty this way is, perhaps, actually not being true to those who put it together, nor, perhaps, to ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" itself. Oh, well, I will CHERISH the first week of the hour long shows that were released last year because I fear that's all that I'll ever get. I've read that ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" that contains the introduction will be included. I'm hoping that it will be the COMPLETE ONE HOUR SHOW from 1955 that introduced the series instead of the shows that were shown during the '58-'59 season that was nothing but older materials in a half hour format and was syndicated from '62-'65, the '70's and on The Disney Channel in the '80's. COME ON,DISNEY.DON'T CHEAP OUT ON US! Again, the directors NEVER intended for this serial to be seperate from the shows and I also feel to do so is to be very disrespectful toward ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" itself. Like I said earlier, we don't even know if they would make them the same way. Give me the Mouseketeers singing and dancing anytime.

Stevenson ""WIAPilot""","[14, 15]","Although I wasn't born when this series was made, like countless other kids, I grew up watching ""Spin and Marty"" on the Mickey Mouse show in the 60's.After watching the entire 25 episodes in this ""Spin and Marty"" collection, I realize now why ""dude ranch camps"" became so popular for kids during the 50's-60's.  Everyone wanted a camp counselor like Bill Burnett (Harry Carey, Jr.) and pals like Spin (Tim Considine) and Marty (David Stolley).  The ranch was beautiful and the horses all performed like ""Trigger!"" (The Triple R Ranch land was purchased by Walt Disney as he was so taken with its lush setting.)In a bonus interview, Tim Considine and David Stolley take a visit back to the Triple R and modestly Tim states that the reason that the series was so popular was because kids could feel as though they were at the ranch themselves...  This is true, but it all goes back to their terrific acting- because their great performances are what made the series work.  (Most of the scenes were done quickly and you never would have known this.) Tim Considine was one of the most terrific young actors of his day!  I think every girl on my block had a crush on this guy although he was actually probably an adult by the time we viewed this series!  His performance makes you feel as though this was just a regular kid having a great summer vacation.  David Stolley's role required more of a stretch in acting and he did a fine job as well.  And Harry Carey, Jr. made me wish fervently that he was an Uncle or relative of mine when I was a kid!  He was absolutely perfectly cast in this role.  I wonder if he ever has realized what a tremendous influence his role had on so many kids?""Spin and Marty"" is a classic that is going to endure forever.

While I suppose I understand the difficulty of dealing with the serialized portions of the shows, this release implies that Disney is either NOT going to release the entire shows, or at best may release the non-serial portions of the shows separately.The part I want to see primarily is the talent sections of the show, which were usually intermixed with the serials.  While one reviewer of the single MMC disk claimed they were boring, I find them by far the most entertaining parts of the show.  And not just the Talent Roundup feature, but also the individual skits and musical numbers of the regular cast.  I fear that this release means that the talent sections that were shown on the same show as the Spin and Marty episodes may end up not making it to release, or perhaps once Disney has milked it by releasing the serials separately will eventually release larger sets of the entire shows including the serials, though I expect that would be a long way off.I'd probably be interested in the Annette serial, but even there I'd like to see it along with the rest of the show-- an option on the disk could be to view the serial all together, or show-by-show as originally aired.

Even so, as a life long Disney fanatic, I have heard lots of things about ""The Adventures of Spin and Marty.""  Naturally, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this set and watch it.  I immediately found the appeal of the serial.Originally airing as part of the Mickey Mouse Club in 1955, this two-disc set contains twenty-five eleven minutes episodes about the adventures of a group of pre-teen boys spending a summer at the Triple R dude ranch.Spin Evans is returning for his second year.  He's got lots of horse knowledge and is quite popular.On the other hand, Marty Markham is new to the ranch this year.  He's a spoiled kid overly sheltered by his grandmother.  In fact, their butler, Perkins, spends the summer at the ranch to keep an eye on him.  Marty has a fascination with horses, yet is terrified of them.  He tries anything he can to get the other boys to like him, causing rifts at the ranch, especially with Spin.  Will he ever learn to get along with guys his own age?Meanwhile, the guys will have lots of adventures, including a snipe hunt, an encounter with a bear, and an overnight camping trip to a haunted mine.  As if that weren't enough, at the end of the summer, the ranch will compete in a rodeo with another ranch.  Will this be the year the Triple R finally wins?Starting this set, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got quickly hooked on the story, however.  While it takes it time developing, it is charming from the start.  You can't help but root for Spin, Marty, and the other guys.  The great writing and acting help.  These may be kids on a low budget show, but they do an impressive job with the material.  The few special effects are poor by today's standards, but they fit with the charm of the show.  The story takes the time to let us get to know the characters so we care about what happens to them at the various points along the way.As previously mentioned, there are 25 episodes in this two-disc set.  These cover the first season.  After the serial proved to be popular, the cast came back twice more over the next two years.  Hopefully those adventures will be released soon.  The episodes are presented in their original black and white.  Somehow, anything else would just feel wrong to me.  While the occasional dust or grain betrays the shows age, the show is remarkably well preserved and very clear.  Extras include introductions from Leonard Maltin on both discs, the complete Mickey Mouse Club episode that first introduced the characters (it spoils much of the series, so I recommend watching it last), Tim Considine's screen test as Marty (he actually played Spin), photo galleries, interviews with stars Tim Considine and David Stollery as they tour the area where the series was filmed, and an interview with Harry Carey, Jr., who played counselor Bill Burnett in the series.This show, with its low-key action and slow story telling, would never make it on TV today.  But this set gives us a chance to enjoy a truly wonderful piece of television history.  Those who grew up watching the show will love the trip down memory lane.  Anyone willing to give this gem a chance will find it just as charming now as it was fifty years ago.",5,"""Way Up There on the Triple R""",1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,3271,"['was', 'born', 'too', 'late', 'watch', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'TV', 'never', 'caught', 'reruns', 'Even', 'so', 'life', 'long', 'Disney', 'fanatic', 'have', 'heard', 'lots', 'things', 'Adventures', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'Naturally', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'set', 'watch', 'immediately', 'found', 'appeal', 'serial.Originally', 'airing', 'part', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', '1955', 'two-disc', 'set', 'twenty-five', 'eleven', 'minutes', 'episodes', 'adventures', 'group', 'pre-teen', 'boys', 'spending', 'summer', 'Triple', 'R', 'dude', 'ranch.Spin', 'Evans', 'returning', 'second', 'year', 'got', 'lots', 'horse', 'knowledge', 'quite', 'popular.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Marty', 'Markham', 'new', 'ranch', 'year', 'spoiled', 'kid', 'overly', 'sheltered', 'grandmother', 'fact', 'butler', 'Perkins', 'summer', 'ranch', 'keep', 'eye', 'Marty', 'fascination', 'horses', 'terrified', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'other', 'boys', 'like', 'causing', 'rifts', 'ranch', 'especially', 'Spin', 'Will', 'ever', 'learn', 'get', 'guys', 'own', 'age', 'Meanwhile', 'guys', 'will', 'have', 'lots', 'adventures', 'including', 'snipe', 'hunt', 'encounter', 'bear', 'overnight', 'camping', 'trip', 'haunted', 'mine', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'end', 'summer', 'ranch', 'will', 'compete', 'rodeo', 'ranch', 'Will', 'be', 'year', 'Triple', 'R', 'finally', 'Starting', 'set', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'got', 'quickly', 'hooked', 'story', 'however', 'time', 'developing', 'charming', 'start', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'other', 'guys', 'great', 'writing', 'acting', 'help', 'may', 'be', 'kids', 'low', 'budget', 'show', 'do', 'impressive', 'job', 'material', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'poor', 'today', 'standards', 'fit', 'charm', 'show', 'story', 'time', 'let', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'care', 'what', 'various', 'points', 'way.As', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'are', '25', 'episodes', 'two-disc', 'set', 'cover', 'first', 'season', 'serial', 'proved', 'be', 'popular', 'cast', 'came', 'back', 'twice', 'more', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'Hopefully', 'adventures', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'soon', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'black', 'white', 'Somehow', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'just', 'feel', 'wrong', 'occasional', 'dust', 'grain', 'shows', 'age', 'show', 'remarkably', 'well', 'preserved', 'very', 'clear', 'Extras', 'include', 'introductions', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'discs', 'complete', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'episode', 'first', 'introduced', 'characters', 'much', 'series', 'recommend', 'watching', 'last', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'screen', 'test', 'Marty', 'actually', 'played', 'Spin', 'photo', 'galleries', 'interviews', 'stars', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'David', 'Stollery', 'tour', 'area', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'interview', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'played', 'counselor', 'Bill', 'Burnett', 'series.This', 'show', 'low-key', 'action', 'slow', 'story', 'telling', 'would', 'never', 'make', 'TV', 'today', 'set', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'television', 'history', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'will', 'love', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'Anyone', 'willing', 'give', 'gem', 'chance', 'will', 'find', 'just', 'charming', 'now', 'was', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago']",N/A

When that series ran out--I just had to get Spin and Marty which was my favorite watching the Micky Mouse Club (original club) when I was a little kid. The kids loved this one just as much and bothered me to no end to show them more--I often would let them see one episode a day!  The storyline is all there from the arrival of the little stuck-up kid &#34;Martin&#34; with his manservant at the Triple-R ranch--and Tim Considine playing Spin Evans. If you saw it as a kid, you know what I'm speaking about--and I still love watching these old shows.  When I bought the Hardy Boys, it only cost me around $20. By the time I wanted to add this one, it was hard to find a set under  $70---if you're thinking of getting one--get it soon because the value on these classics are going up fast (I've seen some already wanting hundreds)... but for me, it's not the money they're worth--it's just sitting down with the kids, watching a great series unfold as we sing around a campfire--&#34;Way up there on the Triple-R--yippee yaa... yippee ohh....&#34;  I am thoroughly enjoying these series.  I only wish Walt Disney would release more of them so the price wouldn't be so high--and include the other Hardy Boys' adventure (I think it was the Ghost Farm)... and they had other series too-- I remember one was set with these two kids in London-- man those were the days.",5,Nostalgia for us  old-timers--but I find that presented properly--kids today love it just as much as I did.,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,1578,"['originally', 'did', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Mystery', 'Applegate', 'Treasure', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'kids', 'loved', 'third', 'fourth', 'episode', 'were', 'singing', 'right', 'along', 'opening', 'tune', 'When', 'series', 'ran', 'out', 'just', 'had', 'get', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'was', 'favorite', 'watching', 'Micky', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'original', 'club', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'kids', 'loved', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'bothered', 'end', 'show', 'more', 'often', 'would', 'let', 'see', 'one', 'episode', 'day', 'storyline', 'there', 'arrival', 'little', 'stuck-up', 'kid', '34', 'Martin', '34', 'manservant', 'Triple-R', 'ranch', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'playing', 'Spin', 'Evans', 'saw', 'kid', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'about', 'still', 'love', 'watching', 'old', 'shows', 'When', 'bought', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'only', 'cost', '20', 'time', 'wanted', 'add', 'one', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'set', '70', '-if', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'getting', 'one', 'get', 'soon', 'value', 'classics', 'are', 'going', 'up', 'fast', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'wanting', 'hundreds', 'not', 'money', ""'re"", 'worth', 'just', 'sitting', 'down', 'kids', 'watching', 'great', 'series', 'unfold', 'sing', 'campfire', '34', 'Way', 'there', 'Triple-R', 'yippee', 'yaa', 'ohh', '34', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'series', 'only', 'wish', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'would', 'release', 'more', 'so', 'price', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'high', 'include', 'other', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'adventure', 'think', 'was', 'Ghost', 'Farm', 'had', 'other', 'series', 'too', 'remember', 'one', 'was', 'set', 'two', 'kids', 'London', 'man', 'were', 'days']",N/A

Marty Markham was the newcomer to a boys' ranch summer camp.  An instant misfit with the rest of the young adolescents, rebellious and rude to authority, and unwilling to join in and make friends, both the staff and the other campers have their work cut out for them in getting Marty to integrate.  It was REFRESHING to see that no one was diagnosing him, kicking him out of camp, conferencing with his grandmother (who was part of the problem), or giving him medication.  Instead, the entire staff knew it was going to be a long haul to turn him around, and they lived with it.  Imagine that!  Moreover, they didn't protect Marty from the other kids, force them to like him, or keep the other kids from acknowledging that he was a pill.  What they DID do is hold firm to their expectations on how to behave, they never gave up on him, gave him enough space to come to grips with himself, acknowledged what he WAS good at, and built up his sense of self by TEACHING HIM HOW TO DO THINGS --- not by telling him how wonderful he was when even HE knew that he was acting bratty.  Parents, and anyone else who works with kids, could really learn something from this show!  A true winner... and any kid who watches it will come away with one important lesson:  people can, and do, change... if you give them a chance.

He calls the tripple R a Dirty old farm. When the the other boys play a joke on Marty by putting a frog in his bunk, Knowing that it was Spin's Idea-Marty wants to knock his block off. There's a boxing match between Spin & Marty. Yep-that's how they do things at the tripple R-whenever two kids wants to fight-a boxing match is formed. Marty puts up a real good fight-the match is declared a draw.Bill Burnett(Harry Carrey, JR)is the ranch counseler in charge of straightening out Marty. His Job won't be easy because Marty is stubborn. Marty gets himself into a jam when he tells the other boys that he plays polo. Before that he tells Burnett that he's never been on a horse before. As Mr Burnett points out ""For someone who's never been on a horse, you sure picked yourself a hobby""Early on Marty makes friends with Ambition & Freddie. Marty also meets skyrocket-a horse. A special bond is formed between skyrocket and Marty. In time Marty becomes friends with more of the boys and becomes easier to get along with. However, when the truth comes out that Marty never played Polo-he tries to run away-but he decides to go back to the ranch.Spread out over 25 10 min episodes, this serial aired as part of the Mickey Mouse club in the mid 50's. It's nice having the entire serial on DVD. The story culimates with the Big rodeo between Tripple R and Northfork. Spin and Marty become freinds. Marty will never be the same again.This is fun to watch. Boys were allowed to be boys. There's some funny moments-besides the frog incident, there a scene where Ambition and Freddie ""Fixed"" Marty's jeans!

The Spin and Marty episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. All 25 black and white episodes that made up the first season are here and they look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now I find it charming and fun.The first disc includes the first 10 of the episodes from season one and while I wasn't aware of this part of the MMC show, I found these episodes really interesting and fun to watch now. Each episode is approx. 11 minutes long so those of you with ADD can easily get through these without going bonkers! I watched this entire two disc set in one sitting. Along with the episodes on disc one are four extras, the first is a great one, episode #25 of MMC  that introduced the Spin and Marty series, a screen test for Tom Considine and two galleries one on merchandise and the other behind the scenes.The second disc hold the remaining 15 episodes from season one which look a good as the episodes on disc one.

I knew that Spin & Marty didn't get along at first, but I had completely forgotten Marty's best friend in Season One was a kid nicknamed Ambitious. The actor who portrayed Russell(The Muscle) looked really familiar to me, but it wasn't until the cast rolled that I knew who it was: Lee Aaker, who played Rusty on one of my other favorite shows, ""Rin Tin Tin"". Pat O'Malley was just great as Perkins- I hadn't been a fan of his for many years(thanks to being trapped for six years on a Greyhound Scenicruiser between Seattle and Portland next to a JPO'M lookalike. It wasn't so much the hacking sounds he made, but more the items he deposited in his sodden handkerchief). But I digress...The re-copy & transfer on the two discs is excellent. A complete episode of Mickey Mouse Club is included(the one from the week before Spin & Marty's first episode, with Marty(David Stollery) previewing what was to come). Also, we get to go ""Back To The Triple-R"", with Stollery & Spin(Tim Considine), and we get a nice visit with Harey Carey, Jr., who played Bill Burnett. In the MMC episode, we also get to see Mouseketeer Johnny (Crawford, aka Mark McCain from 'The Rifleman' practicing fencing as a talent, with his brother Bobby.Saying that, while I was overjoyed to return to the Triple-R(I almost went online to see about visiting the site), I was very disappointed that Moochie and Darlene(yeah, Annette, too) weren't there. They didn't show up until season two, so I'm going to knock one star off of my review for a lack of content. Even for the original list price of $24.99, I'd expect all three seasons, and what is a shame is that Disney has no timetable on releasing the other two seasons. I find that very unfortunate, since those of us who bought all the Davy Crockett, Spin & Marty, and MMC paraphernalia are aging, and some are passing(including two friends I used to watch ""Spin & Marty"" with).After watching this two-disc set(actually before I even finished), I knew I'd probably never watch it again, and I listed it on Amazon, and it sold in a couple of hours.I'll always remember being in England in 1985, sitting in a pub, & when I started talking to the Americans at an adjacent table, I said my name was Marty.

When originally broadcast the total running time of 275 minutes was broken into 25 episodes and shown as part of the first year ""Mickey Mouse Club"".  The show was broadcast Monday-Friday from 5Pm-6PM.  The serials were structured in a mild cliffhanger  format with a teaser at the end enticing viewers to watch the next episode for a resolution. When they were shown a few years ago on ""Vault Disney"" the episodes were paired up to provide a 22-23 minute running time.If you grew up with the original MMC you already know that serials like this were the most anticipated part of the show and that ""Spin and Marty"" was by far the most popular. The reason for their popularity was no mystery,  they were the only kid's shows in those days that featured kids instead of puppets or animation.If you were not around for the ""Spin and Marty"" phenomenon, think of it as a 1950's version of ""The Saddle Club"",  both featured kids getting to spend all their time with horses. But instead of girls hanging out at the Pine Hollow stables, here it's boys living in bunk houses at ""The Triple R"", a dude ranch summer camp. And who wouldn't like spending an entire summer at a ranch, riding horses far away from parental supervision?The first season's story was adapted from the novel ""Marty Markham"" by Lawrence Watkin. The show went rapidly downhill after the first season so it is no great tragedy that only season one is out on DVD. Mostly this was because the writers were never able to duplicate the charm of the first season's premise. But the show also fell victim to the Kevin Corcoran curse. Corcoran was a terminally precocious little actor that Disney tried to make a star by inserting him into this popular show at the start of the second season. Corcoran was an unbearably bad actor and the damage was compounded by Disney's insistence on manipulative showcasing of his terminal cuteness; an especially bad fit for a show whose first season appeal had been its naturalness and the understated performances of the cast.Like ""Saddle Club's"" first season,  it revolves around a new kid who has difficulty fitting in at the ranch. Marty Markham (David Stollery) is an overprotected orphaned rich kid who arrives in his grandmother's chauffeured limousine with his own butler (Perkins-J. Pat O'Malley-who is detailed to help the ranch's cook) and immediately manages to offend all the boys by calling the Triple-R Ranch ""a smelly old farm"".A rivalry soon develops with Spin Evans (Tim Considine), a popular boy who has to work all year to pay the attendance costs. Marty is afraid of horses but lies about being a polo player. Considine and Stollery are both convincing although Stollery has the more difficult part. The supporting cast of boys have appropriate nicknames; the lazy ""Ambitious"", the freckled ""Speckle"" and the chunky ""Russell the Muscle"".Special effects are a bit weak (like the woodchuck chase scene where you have to accept that a ball of fur pulled though the field on a string is a woodchuck) and the campfire scenes are obvious day for night shooting.Harry Carey Jr. and Roy Barcroft provide sympathetic and concerned authority figures but my favorite is insightful horse trainer Ollie (Leonard Geer) who always seemed to have about nine days worth of stubble and repeatedly said: ""Well I'll be a blue-nosed gopher"".Predictably Marty learns to love horses and to get along with the other boys. He breaks his arm but Perkins is able to keep the news from his grandmother so that he is not sent home early. There are all the great summer camp elements from bears to ghost stories.The two-disc DVD set has a photo gallery, interviews, and a little feature called ""The Return to the Triple-R""; which includes the adult Considine and Stollery visiting the ranch where most of the show was filmed.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,The First Season Was Great,1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,4001,"['Adventures', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'title', 'refers', 'first', 'season', '1955-56', 'show', 'second', 'third', 'seasons', 'were', 'given', 'modified', 'title', 'When', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'total', 'running', 'time', '275', 'minutes', 'was', 'broken', '25', 'episodes', 'shown', 'part', 'first', 'year', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Club', 'show', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Monday-Friday', '5Pm-6PM', 'serials', 'were', 'structured', 'mild', 'cliffhanger', 'format', 'teaser', 'end', 'enticing', 'viewers', 'watch', 'next', 'episode', 'resolution', 'When', 'were', 'shown', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Vault', 'Disney', 'episodes', 'were', 'paired', 'up', 'provide', '22-23', 'minute', 'running', 'time.If', 'grew', 'up', 'original', 'MMC', 'already', 'know', 'serials', 'were', 'most', 'anticipated', 'part', 'show', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'was', 'far', 'most', 'popular', 'reason', 'popularity', 'was', 'mystery', 'were', 'only', 'kid', 'shows', 'days', 'featured', 'kids', 'instead', 'puppets', 'animation.If', 'were', 'not', 'Spin', 'Marty', 'phenomenon', 'think', '1950', 'version', 'Saddle', 'Club', 'featured', 'kids', 'getting', 'spend', 'time', 'horses', 'instead', 'girls', 'hanging', 'out', 'Pine', 'Hollow', 'stables', 'here', 'boys', 'living', 'bunk', 'houses', 'Triple', 'R', 'dude', 'ranch', 'summer', 'camp', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'spending', 'entire', 'summer', 'ranch', 'riding', 'horses', 'far', 'away', 'parental', 'supervision', 'first', 'season', 'story', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Marty', 'Markham', 'Lawrence', 'Watkin', 'show', 'went', 'rapidly', 'downhill', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'tragedy', 'only', 'season', 'one', 'out', 'DVD', 'Mostly', 'was', 'writers', 'were', 'never', 'able', 'duplicate', 'charm', 'first', 'season', 'premise', 'show', 'also', 'fell', 'victim', 'Kevin', 'Corcoran', 'curse', 'Corcoran', 'was', 'terminally', 'precocious', 'little', 'actor', 'Disney', 'tried', 'make', 'star', 'inserting', 'popular', 'show', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'Corcoran', 'was', 'unbearably', 'bad', 'actor', 'damage', 'was', 'compounded', 'Disney', 'insistence', 'manipulative', 'showcasing', 'terminal', 'cuteness', 'especially', 'bad', 'fit', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'appeal', 'had', 'been', 'naturalness', 'understated', 'performances', 'cast.Like', 'Saddle', 'Club', 'first', 'season', 'new', 'kid', 'who', 'difficulty', 'fitting', 'ranch', 'Marty', 'Markham', 'David', 'Stollery', 'overprotected', 'orphaned', 'rich', 'kid', 'who', 'grandmother', 'chauffeured', 'limousine', 'own', 'butler', 'Perkins-J', 'Pat', ""O'Malley-who"", 'detailed', 'help', 'ranch', 'cook', 'immediately', 'offend', 'boys', 'calling', 'Triple-R', 'Ranch', 'smelly', 'old', 'farm', '.A', 'rivalry', 'soon', 'Spin', 'Evans', 'Tim', 'Considine', 'popular', 'boy', 'who', 'work', 'year', 'pay', 'attendance', 'costs', 'Marty', 'afraid', 'horses', 'being', 'polo', 'player', 'Considine', 'Stollery', 'are', 'convincing', 'Stollery', 'more', 'difficult', 'part', 'supporting', 'cast', 'boys', 'have', 'appropriate', 'nicknames', 'lazy', 'Ambitious', 'freckled', 'Speckle', 'chunky', 'Russell', 'Muscle', '.Special', 'effects', 'are', 'bit', 'weak', 'woodchuck', 'chase', 'scene', 'where', 'have', 'accept', 'ball', 'fur', 'pulled', 'field', 'string', 'woodchuck', 'campfire', 'scenes', 'are', 'obvious', 'day', 'night', 'shooting.Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Roy', 'Barcroft', 'provide', 'sympathetic', 'concerned', 'authority', 'figures', 'favorite', 'insightful', 'horse', 'trainer', 'Ollie', 'Leonard', 'Geer', 'who', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'about', 'nine', 'days', 'stubble', 'repeatedly', 'said', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'be', 'blue-nosed', 'gopher', '.Predictably', 'Marty', 'love', 'horses', 'get', 'other', 'boys', 'arm', 'Perkins', 'able', 'keep', 'news', 'grandmother', 'so', 'not', 'sent', 'home', 'early', 'are', 'great', 'summer', 'camp', 'elements', 'bears', 'ghost', 'stories.The', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'photo', 'gallery', 'interviews', 'little', 'feature', 'called', 'Return', 'Triple-R', 'adult', 'Considine', 'Stollery', 'visiting', 'ranch', 'where', 'most', 'show', 'was', 'filmed.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

Buyer beware. The ""Treasures"" come in flimsy and easy to dent metal boxes and everything the company has to offer for the price is strictly for the collector or those who trip on their feet during the good old innocent days.
