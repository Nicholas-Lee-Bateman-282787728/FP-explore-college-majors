180158,A4MQ75RMLWTS4,1558908331,A. Bouardi,"[5, 7]","A Thousand Acres was a film that I wasn't exactly looking forward to seeing.  I don't like films which depict women as victims or in tortured roles.  This film didn't.  This film dealt with life - real life - the way it is for many women and not in the exact events and not getting to face the villains...but it will touch so many who can put off their own issues and just watch from the perspective of two little girls turned women.  The film gives us a strong character in Pfeiffer, one who doesn't just cry and take the ugliness.  She gets angry, and the &quot;angrier she gets, the better she feels&quot;...which is a very honest thing.  It taps into frustrations, it taps into anyone who has ever felt like she was intimidated by a man or a father due to power.  It is brilliant.  And for all the morons who like to call such a thing &quot;cliche&quot; or &quot;contrived&quot;...ask all the 1 out of 4 girls molested every year how cliche each of their stories is.  This film actually reminds the American community, as numb as they've gotten to females as human beings and not sex objects, just how disgusting and serious it is to be violating women and young people as a whole.",5,"Poignant, and not in a typical way.",988156800,"04 25, 2001",2001,1185,"['Thousand', 'Acres', 'was', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'depict', 'women', 'victims', 'tortured', 'roles', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'dealt', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'many', 'women', 'not', 'exact', 'events', 'not', 'getting', 'face', 'villains', 'will', 'touch', 'so', 'many', 'who', 'can', 'put', 'off', 'own', 'issues', 'just', 'watch', 'perspective', 'two', 'little', 'girls', 'turned', 'women', 'film', 'strong', 'character', 'Pfeiffer', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'just', 'cry', 'take', 'ugliness', 'angry', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'very', 'honest', 'thing', 'frustrations', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'was', 'intimidated', 'man', 'father', 'due', 'power', 'brilliant', 'morons', 'who', 'like', 'call', 'thing', 'quot', 'cliche', 'quot', 'quot', 'contrived', 'quot', 'ask', '1', '4', 'girls', 'molested', 'year', 'how', 'cliche', 'stories', 'film', 'actually', 'American', 'community', 'as', 'numb', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'females', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'sex', 'objects', 'just', 'how', 'disgusting', 'serious', 'be', 'violating', 'women', 'young', 'people', 'whole']",N/A

180161,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1558908331,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 4]","BEWARE SPOILERS!One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth, how they watched the movie only because of him.  Obviously these were two young women; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally.  The brilliant, and I mean brilliant, performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed, not only by audiences, but by the Academy and by most of the critics.I think I know why.  First, the plot--or actually just the setup--is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare's King Lear with the dying, crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit.  Their names even begin with the same letters, Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia--Rose, Ginny, and Caroline.  And I guess ""Larry"" (Jason Robards) works for ""Lear.""  The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters, and to tell it in a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard.  The problem is, in Smiley and Moorhouse's story, the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities.  His only strength is his ability to make a financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it.The second problem--and this is one I cannot personally attest to, not having read Smiley's novel--is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel.  Still, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transferred to the screen.  The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints don't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist.  Given five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley's novel.A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse's alone.  She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof (1991) starring Russell Crowe.  She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt (1995) which celebrated women, especially women of a certain age.  However it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick.  In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there, showing us not only the point of view of women, but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some.  Larry Cook is clearly a bad, bad daddy. He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them.  He ran the household with an iron fist.  Jess (Colin Firth's character) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear.  And then he goes to Rose, who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership, and hooks up with her, while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident.  The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance, the way they often appear in romance novels.  I think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest, adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story.Having said all this, I think the critics and the public are wrong.  I think the direction was biased against men, but in this story it needed to be.  I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty.  And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational.  They seemed to feed off of one another in a way that I found absolutely authentic and deeply moving.  In particular Pfeiffer was riveting as she projected her bent-up anger and hatred.  The way Moorhouse allowed her character to be revealed to us gradually is a tribute to her ability as a director as well as to Pfeiffer's outstanding performance.  And the skill with which Moorhouse guided the change in Ginny's character as she went from a ""ninny,"" as she called herself, to someone with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent.  The fact that she left her husband was as much out of shame as anything else.  He needed to go get her and forgive her and bring her back.  And Robards in his intensity and madness was also very good.I predict that this film, which bombed in theaters, will be better appreciated in the years to come as people see it on DVD.  My question is, whatever happened to Moorhouse?  Her talent is obvious, but she has yet to director her fourth feature film.  When she does I hope she remembers to go with what she believes but to be fair as well.  I think, actually she was fair to the two lead character in this film, but didn't pay enough attention to the others.  In addition to the unnuanced father, Jennifer Jason Leigh's Caroline was unfinished, leaving us to wonder about why she did some of the things she did.  And the husbands needed to be something more than mannequins.  They needed to be engaged and involved.",5,Underrated family drama with sizzling work by Pfeiffer and Lange,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,5181,"['BEWARE', 'SPOILERS', 'One', 'Message', 'Boards',

Here we have an all-star cast bogged down in a sewer of melodramatic drivel that was so obviously written by a female, and  one who thinks all men are nothing more than demented slime (the book won a  pulitzer???).  Every man depicted was an absolute loser in one way or  another.  The central figure is the father, who was verbally and physically  abusive, even to the point of raping two of his daughters for years when  they were young (although the eldest daughter has absolutely no memory of  this fact--yeah, right).  The eldest daughter's husband (Lange's) was so  weak-willed, he closed his eyes to all the patriarch's abuses just so he  could get his share of the property.  Pfeiffer's husband couldn't live  with the fact that she had a mastectomy, considered her to be sub-human,  degrader her at every opportunity, and drank himself to oblivion (he  accidentally ran his truck off a lonely gravel road while in a drunken  stupor, and into the only creek within a hundred miles--give me a break!).  Meanwhile, Lange soon falls in love with a real slick guy fresh out of  college who comes back to Iowa to start farming, and guess what?  Yeah, you  guessed it.  He was only out for what he could get.  Surprise, surprise.  But wait!  There's more!!  Not to be outdone, the youngest daughter takes  sides (rather vehemently) with the miserable louse of a father, and against  her own sisters for control of the land (she just happens to be a lawyer  who thinks that her father is the best thing since sliced bread).

I now have experienced a lot that happened in this film and only time has revealed to me that what happened in this film happened in my life.Harold Cook (a surly Jason Robards) is the richest and most powerful man with his 1000 acres that has been in his family for three generations.He has been widowed and his three daughters have been there for him,tending to his needs and putting up with his drunkenness,abuse and control.He decides to will the 1000 acres to the three daughters and two of their spouses,setting up a corporation.Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are the two eldest daughters married,and Jennifer Jason-Leigh, the youngest,a lawyer,is not certain that she wants to do this deal.When she expresses doubt,her father cuts her from the deal and decides to divide the farm in half.This sets up a division in the family, and as Cook starts to lose his mind, the girls start remembering long suppressed memories that start to leak out.Daddy sexually abused them and this is the whole crux of this very tense and sad story of family secrets.Lange and Pfeiffer are so equally compelling in their roles as the two eldest sisters.Pfeiffer is the driving force in blowing up the whole charade.Lange, the ever dutiful daughter is the one who has to come to the realization that her father was a monster and embrace the anger and betrayal.Leigh, the youngest daughter sides with the mentally decaying father,not having either experienced the abuse or simply not remembering, and the family is destroyed permanently.The revelations of the characters and the great performances of Lange and Pfeiffer show what magnificent actresses they are.Director Jocelyn Moorhouse has done three other films that have greatly impressed me;PROOF (with Russel Crowe 1991 Australia),HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT,and MURIEL'S WEDDING (also Australia).Ths fact that Laura Jones wrote the screenplay concerned me.Having seen her other book adaptations,OSCAR AND LUCINDA,ANGELA'S ASHES,PORTRAIT OF A LADY and AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE,I was not hopeful as I had not cared for any of these adaptations,BUT,with Moorhouse directing Jones' screenplay this time, the film had a fluidity and great character development,which I had found wonting in the other films.Inheritances,family secrets and a tyrannical parent are a bitch.I know it!If this is your story,you will readily embrace A THOUSAND ACRES and till the land.If not, you will probably bypass this film until this happens to you.The fact that Jane Smiley's novel A THOUSAND ACRES is an update of William Shakespeare's KING LEAR adds much weight as a great piece of source material that seems to be timeless. It is this particular retelling, though, that resonated in my soul.The DVD print is flawless and letterboxed widescreen with no extras.",5,1000 ACRES: KING LEAR in Iowa or a family betrayed,1195171200,"11 16, 2007",2007,3095,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'found', 'wise', 'revisit', 'certain', 'films', 'see', 'have', 'changed', 'picture.Well', 'saw', 'THOUSAND', 'ACRES', '1998', 'theatre', 'left', 'feeling', 'ehh', 'dry', 'not', 'impressed.Now', 'nearly', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'story', 'outstanding', 'performances.Why', 'change', 'now', 'have', 'experienced', 'lot', 'happened', 'film', 'only', 'time', 'revealed', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'happened', 'life.Harold', 'Cook', 'surly', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'richest', 'most', 'powerful', 'man', '1000', 'acres', 'been', 'family', 'three', 'generations.He', 'been', 'widowed', 'three', 'daughters', 'have', 'been', 'tending', 'needs', 'putting', 'up', 'drunkenness', 'abuse', 'control.He', 'decides', 'will', '1000', 'acres', 'three', 'daughters', 'two', 'spouses', 'setting', 'up', 'corporation.Jessica', 'Lange', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'two', 'eldest', 'daughters', 'married', 'Jennifer', 'Jason-Leigh', 'youngest', 'lawyer', 'not', 'certain', 'do', 'deal.When', 'doubt', 'father', 'deal', 'decides', 'divide', 'farm', 'half.This', 'up', 'division', 'family', 'Cook', 'lose', 'mind', 'girls', 'start', 'remembering', 'long', 'suppressed', 'memories', 'start', 'leak', 'out.Daddy', 'sexually', 'abused', 'whole', 'crux', 'very', 'tense', 'sad', 'story', 'family', 'secrets.Lange', 'Pfeiffer', 'are', 'so', 'equally', 'compelling', 'roles', 'two', 'eldest', 'sisters.Pfeiffer', 'driving', 'force', 'blowing', 'up', 'whole', 'charade.Lange', 'ever', 'dutiful', 'daughter', 'one', 'who', 'come', 'realization', 'father', 'was', 'monster', 'embrace', 'anger', 'betrayal.Leigh', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'sides', 'mentally', 'decaying', 'father', 'not', 'having', 'either', 'experienced', 'abuse', 'simply', 'not', 'remembering', 'family', 'destroyed', 'permanently.The', 'revelations', 'characters', 'great', 'performances', 'Lange', 'Pfeiffer', 'show', 'what', 'magnificent', 'are.Director', 'Jocelyn', 'Moorhouse', 'done', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'PROOF', 'Russel', 'Crowe', '1991', 'Australia', 'HOW', 'TO', 'MAKE', 'AN', 'AMERICAN', 'QUILT', 'MURIEL', 'WEDDING', 'also', 'Australia', '.Ths', 'fact', 'Laura', 'Jones', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'concerned', 'me.Having', 'seen', 'other', 'book', 'adaptations', 'OSCAR', 'AND', 'LUCINDA', 'ANGELA', 'ASHES', 'PORTRAIT', 'A', 'LADY', 'AN', 'ANGEL', 'AT', 'MY', 'TABLE', 'was', 'not', 'hopeful', 'had', 'not', 'cared', 'adaptations', 'BUT', 'Moorhouse', 'directing', 'Jones', 'screenplay', 'time', 'film', 'had', 'fluidity', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'had', 'found', 'wonting', 'other', 'films.Inheritances', 'family', 'secrets', 'tyrannical', 'parent', 'are', 'bitch.I', 'know', 'story', 'will', 'readily', 'embrace', 'A', 'THOUSAND', 'ACRES', 'till', 'land.If', 'not', 'will', 'probably', 'bypass', 'film', 'you.The', 'fact', 'Jane', 'Smiley', 'novel', 'A', 'THOUSAND', 'ACRES', 'update', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'KING', 'LEAR', 'much', 'weight', 'great', 'piece', 'source', 'material', 'be', 'timeless', 'particular', 'retelling', 'though', 'resonated', 'soul.The', 'DVD', 'print', 'flawless', 'letterboxed', 'widescreen', 'extras']",N/A

It's slow and talky  with soap opera elements.  However, perhaps it was because I saw this on  video and the intimacy of the small screen was my own private viewing room,  that I really got into it.It was the excellent characterizations  superbly acted by Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfieffer and Jason Robards that  did it for me. The plot unfolded slowly and every scene revealed yet more  about these characters.  And even though it was set on a farm in Iowa with  a very different life style than mine, I was able to get into their heads.  I fell asleep thinking of the characters,  not the actors who portrayed  them, and was still haunted by them the next morning.The movie is sad.

It is reduced to melodrama, with the  complexities of the characters lost for the sake of moving the film along.

180176,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,1558908331,Thayer,"[15, 17]","This is one of movies where the memorable performances of the leads particularly Pfeiffer and Lange was probably now forgotten because of the failure of the movie, at least in the box office and reception by the critics. The movie has some flaws at least from my point of view, like the lack of coherence of the whole movie, some felt rushed and underdeveloped, lacked of style in storytelling, and weakness in the script. But I personally think this movie is still worth seeing, it has a certain quality that made it compelling and very relatable.Michelle Pfeiffer gave a tour de force performance she interpreted Rose with such anger you almost feel why she's angry. She gave so much depth to her interpretation, the way her eyes well up and the intensity of her face in the confrontation scenes. It was heartbreaking and very touching. (""I did not forgive the unforgivable, that's my sole solitary and only accomplishment"") Jessica Lange gave the subtler and more vulnerable attack to the character. She's a little laid back and understated and the result is really moving performance. I think Pfeiffer gave the better performance only because she got to play the more intense, showy, and ultimately tragic character.The late Jason Robards was very good. He created a character that's both disgusting and also compelling. In the scene where he appeared to start exhibiting signs of senility and he just lost in the case regarding the farm, You can just feel what Pfeiffer was feeling when she said to her dad while going out in the court ""Daddy, you lost"" and she said it with such desperation and anger. That's probably one of the worst feelings, not being able to make the person who've done you wrong know what he did.For fans of Pfeiffer and Lange, I recommend this movie. They gave one of the best performances of their careers. For those who are not, but you're a fan of good performances I also recommend this film.Grade: B+ (the performances I give A)",4,Pfeiffer and Lange: Powerhouse Performances,1098748800,"10 26, 2004",2004,1962,"['one', 'movies', 'where', 'memorable', 'performances', 'leads', 'particularly', 'Pfeiffer', 'Lange', 'was', 'probably', 'now', 'failure', 'movie', 'least', 'box', 'office', 'reception', 'critics', 'movie', 'flaws', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'lack', 'coherence', 'whole', 'movie', 'felt', 'rushed', 'underdeveloped', 'lacked', 'style', 'storytelling', 'weakness', 'script', 'personally', 'think', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'certain', 'quality', 'made', 'compelling', 'very', 'relatable.Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'gave', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'interpreted', 'Rose', 'such', 'anger', 'almost', 'feel', 'why', 'angry', 'gave', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'interpretation', 'way', 'eyes', 'well', 'up', 'intensity', 'face', 'confrontation', 'scenes', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'very', 'touching', 'did', 'not', 'forgive', 'unforgivable', 'sole', 'solitary', 'only', 'accomplishment', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'gave', 'subtler', 'more', 'vulnerable', 'attack', 'character', 'little', 'laid', 'back', 'understated', 'result', 'really', 'moving', 'performance', 'think', 'Pfeiffer', 'gave', 'better', 'performance', 'only', 'got', 'play', 'more', 'intense', 'showy', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'character.The', 'late', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'created', 'character', 'disgusting', 'also', 'compelling', 'scene', 'where', 'appeared', 'start', 'exhibiting', 'signs', 'senility', 'just', 'lost', 'case', 'regarding', 'farm', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'what', 'Pfeiffer', 'was', 'feeling', 'when', 'said', 'dad', 'going', 'out', 'court', 'Daddy', 'lost', 'said', 'such', 'desperation', 'anger', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'feelings', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'person', 'who', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wrong', 'know', 'what', 'did.For', 'fans', 'Pfeiffer', 'Lange', 'recommend', 'movie', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'careers', 'who', 'are', 'not', ""'re"", 'fan', 'good', 'performances', 'also', 'recommend', 'film.Grade', 'B+', 'performances', 'give']",N/A
