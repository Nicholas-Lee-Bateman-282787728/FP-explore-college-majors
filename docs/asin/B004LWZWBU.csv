1417325,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004LWZWBU,A kids review,"[13, 41]","You'd think a comedy starring Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black would be pretty funny, if not uproariously hilarious, especially when the film is centered around competitive bird watching. Based on the book by Mark Obmascik, The Big Year actually hopes to accomplish a bit more depth, but it largely falls flat. At various crossroads in their lives, Stu, Brad, and Kenny embark on a cross-country trip in hopes of spotting the most bird species in North America; along the way, they each discover enough about themselves to move on. Directed by David Frankel, The Big Year certainly cares about its characters, but I felt the film had little forward motion, and its surprising lack of humor made it feel all the more stagnant.

Or ""birding"" as they call it.Nothing huge happens.  No continents fall into the ocean.  No aliens land.  No international crime lords captured.  Just a charming film about three men, each of whom hopes to be the one to spot the most bird species during a one-year period.There are subplots, but they aren't really so important.  Each man has a ""real life"" that intrudes a bit.  One has a father who disapproves and a job that must be attended to periodically.  One has a wife who wants to get pregnant, and the husband just isn't around much.  And one is trying to retire from a company that just can't seem to adjust to his being gone.All that said, what the movie is really about is the passion, the absolute love, for birds that birders display.  Really, it is an obsession.I am married to a birder, and, yes, we might get a phone call on vacation that a special bird was spotted only 500 miles from where we are (and 10000 ft in altitude difference) and why don't we dash over and see it.....  It can be trying for the non-birder (me).  But how wonderful that a group of people can have an obsession, a real love, for something so simple, lovely, and harmless.I found the film true to life, and really enjoyable.

But oh were my expectations (which were quite high) blown away, in a good way.The acting and script of this movie, as well as the directing, are all very high quality. Jack Black always makes me laugh, but beyond being funny, I feel that he is a dedicated, convicted, and experienced actor, that always takes his roles seriously, even if it looks like he is just goofing off. That is his role, it makes him fun to watch. I believe he works really hard to achieve and maintain this image, while still remaining kid friendly, this movie falls under that category, by the way.Other than Jack Black, the film boasts an all star cast, filled with actors who have earned big reputations for their previous works. There are several noticeable B-listers in there as well. The supporting cast is perfect, well, support, to a main cast that is, well, perfect.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy films, or just likes a good laugh every once in a while. You don't want to miss it, as good quality films of this ilk are much fewer than the bulk of  ""comedies"" that are really just dramas in disguise.

1417332,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B004LWZWBU,Andy Orrock,"[2, 5]","""The Big Year"" is a pleasant movie, but one that absolutely found no audience at all at the box office.  Let's face it: a movie about competitive bird-watching?  Tough. Sell.  With Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, it had a chance on paper.  But the marketing seemed tepid (I saw one commercial) and the film's generic name - through relevant in the story itself - meant nothing to people scanning movie listings.  I remember staring at the paper: ""Big Year, Big Year...what was that about?""  Our prime time audience featured the three of us...and four other people.As a result, Fox got a $7m gross for its $40m investment...the very definition of a bomb.  Which is a shame, because it's a fairly good movie.  It's not Oscar category fare, nor is pretending to be.  But, it's enjoyable.  Owen Wilson continues to mature as an actor.  His 'Kenny Bostick' is supposed to be unlikable...until we find out - to the surprise of Steve Martin's Stu - that Bostick is a man of honor and, ultimately, likable.  It's the kind of thing that Owen Wilson can pull off.  He has that charm.The loser here is Steve Martin.  That's unfortunate.  I've been a fan for 30+ years (big club), but when you're the big draw in a bomb like this, yourFather of the Bride 1 & 2days are long since past.",4,Tepid marketing and a tough sell make for a very small audience for this enjoyable film,1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,1283,"['Big', 'Year', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'one', 'absolutely', 'found', 'audience', 'box', 'office', 'Let', 'face', 'movie', 'competitive', 'bird-watching', 'Tough', 'Sell', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'had', 'chance', 'paper', 'marketing', 'seemed', 'tepid', 'saw', 'one', 'commercial', 'film', 'generic', 'name', 'relevant', 'story', 'meant', 'nothing', 'people', 'scanning', 'movie', 'listings', 'remember', 'staring', 'paper', 'Big', 'Year', 'Big', 'Year', 'what', 'was', 'prime', 'time', 'audience', 'featured', 'three', 'four', 'other', 'people.As', 'result', 'Fox', 'got', '7m', 'gross', '40m', 'investment', 'very', 'definition', 'bomb', 'Which', 'shame', 'fairly', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'Oscar', 'category', 'fare', 'pretending', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'mature', 'actor', ""'Kenny"", 'Bostick', 'supposed', 'be', 'unlikable', 'find', 'out', 'surprise', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Stu', 'Bostick', 'man', 'honor', 'ultimately', 'likable', 'kind', 'thing', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'charm.The', 'loser', 'here', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'unfortunate', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', '30+', 'years', 'big', 'club', 'when', ""'re"", 'big', 'draw', 'bomb', 'yourFather', 'Bride', '1', '2days', 'are', 'long', 'past']",The Big Year

I won't go more into detail here about it as plenty of other reviewers have done that already, just watch it!I do want to highly recommend the bluray 2-disc set as it includes the extended version narrated slightly differently by John Cleese (on the bluray disc in the extras section), which is as enjoyable if not moreso than the theatrical version narrated by Jack Black. The extended version also has a gag reel and some other fun behind-the-scenes extras about the locations to which the production crew and cast traveled, and there is one more very small character's story woven in to the extended version of the movie...that of a ruby-throated hummingbird. The ruby's story is laced throughout the movie, and I think it adds a little extra bit of birding fun and fullness to the overall feel of the film.

1417343,A2582KMXLK2P06,B004LWZWBU,B. E Jackson,"[1, 9]","The Big Year is atrocious!  Luckily I can keep my thoughts short and sweet since nothing interesting happens so this won't take long.  The first 30 minutes is about Owen Wilson having marital troubles along with the reconstruction of his home.  The problem is that he's never home and is out bird watching instead, which results in constant arguments with his wife (she doesn't want him to go on his bird spotting adventure and given how boring and lifeless his character is, you can hardly blame her).  Jack Black likes to imitate the sounds of several birds and eventually wins the admiration of another bird caller (a female that he likes) on his particular bird spotting trip.  Steve Martin... well at first he cares about flat out boring business meetings, but eventually he tags along with Jack Black as they take to the snowy mountains of Alaska.When the actual bird spotting gets underway about halfway through, it becomes clear that Owen Wilson and Jack Black are competing against each other to see who can take the most photos of birds.  A disastrous decision on the part of the movie writers was to try and implement emotion like snapping bird photos is the most important competition ever.  Viewers won't buy into that sort of thing so adding feeling and concern for Jack and Owen's character was a horrible mistake.  Owen should have listened to his wife and just stayed home.  What a lousy movie, really.  Lousy writing, no humor whatsoever, no enticing storyline, flat film overall.That's right- no comedy at *all* despite being tagged as a comedy.  When you don't even laugh once you know something's wrong, SERIOUSLY wrong.The only worthwhile moment comes at the very end during the credits when we see all 755 photos of the collected birds running in succession.  Everything from cardinals to robins to ducks to mocking birds to... you name it.  It's an amazing sight and clearly the only reason to watch this movie.  I could watch those 3 minutes over and over.  For the amazing display of photos during the credits the Big Year gets a 2-star rating.The most disappointing part is that all those amazing bird varities were never even brought up during the duration of the movie.  What a shame.

1417344,A2DONKOXI3JU6A,B004LWZWBU,Ben Moore,"[0, 0]","Love the movie, don't like the extended version.  I love John Cleese, but having watched both the extended version and the &#34;regular&#34; edition of the movie, I prefer Jack Black's narration.  The biggest difference between the two is the voice over.  There are a few additional cut away scenes of birds, but nothing that has any bearing on the story itself.  If you are on the fence between the two my personal recommendation is the regular ed. but to each their own.The movie itself centers around Black, Martin, and Owens who are all birders and their objective is to see as many birds as possible from January 1 to December 31 to attain the title of the worlds greatest birder.  Owens currently holds the title and is looking to ensure that it holds, or that if competition is serious enough that he beats his own record at any cost to maintain his title.  The story centers around the lives and adventures of these three as they jump back and forth across the country trying to add to their count.  Being the best requires sacrifice and dedication... sometimes winning may not be worth the cost.While the subject matter (birding) is far outside what I consider to be the normal scope of movies that I seek out, the cast, the soundtrack, the story, and the beautiful visuals really do make this a movie that we watch regularly.  It's definitely kid safe which is nice to find.  It can be hard to find movies the entire family can not only tolerate but actually enjoy.

Although the three lead actors are well known to everyone, they did an outstanding job making me feel a real connection with the characters they played.

1417363,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B004LWZWBU,D. Blankenship,"[4, 4]","As you will note, I have given this movie five stars.  I will add that these are an enthusiastic five stars.  The primary reason I have rated this film so high is that I personally have added it to my ""most favored"" list.  I have watched this thing about six times now and was as delighted during the last viewing as I was with the first.Now I realize that not everyone is going to be as enthusiastic about this film as I am.  As a matter of fact, some folks will absolutely hate the thing.  That is okay though - hey there are thousands upon thousands of movies out there and no one can like them all and no one can hate them all.  First let me start though by telling you (as I see it) what this movie is not:Even though the three male stars in this movie; Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin are three of the funniest men in the film industry, this movie is not what you would call hilarious.  The supporting cast which includes Time Blake Nelson, Dianne West, Brian Demehy, Angelica Huston, Rosamund Pike and Rashide Jones are a very talented group of actors yet there is not one hint in the movie of ""acting envy.""  Not once have I detected a hint of professional jealously or competition.  This is not a high action, high drama or intense movie by any stretch of the imagination.  There are no killings, no zombies, vampires or werewolves, no brooding teen stars, nothing gets blown up and there are no hot sexy sex scenes from the beginning to the end.This movie was loosely based on the book with the same title written by Mark Obmascik, 2004.  This, by the way, is a wonderful book; one which I have read twice.  The original book was based upon a real life situation, i.e. tracking three men (the men portrayed in the film) while they were attempting a ""Big Year.""  For those of you that do not know what a big year is read the product description offered above.  The movie is partly true and partly fiction.I suspect that those who are interested in birding or are birders themselves will appreciate this film more than those who are not consumed by this ""hobby.""  I will tell you that the movie very accurately portrays just what fanatical birders are and what they are capable of.  It catches the essence of the competition perfectly and addresses the ""problem"" with complete and absolute obsession.  I know of what I speak here as I am one of those unfortunately obsessed myself so I perfectly understood where these three men where coming from.The acting in this movie was excellent as each actor played the part he or she was assigned perfectly.  Each actor made the part he or she was playing perfectly believable and this is as it should be because, yes folks, there are indeed many, many individuals out there in the birding world just like what is portrayed on the screen.I found this to be a very mellow film and a wonderful break from what we are dished out these days.  The story had a quite, respectful and whimsical dignity about it that for me was captivating.  I was entertained and I could most certainly relate.

It's a form of entertainment which makes fun of the affectations, habits, values and manners of our times through characters familiar to us in our encounters with them like an old person pretending to be young, the career executive, or the playboy. The plot usually revolves around a scandal but in this case, The Big Year deals with a project that gets out of hand. The characters lose sight of the priorities in their lives, struggle to recover them or discover new ones. The plot is less important than the witty dialogue between them. At their best they can satirize the hypocrisy and pretension in society. Unlike the unbeaten Miami Dolphins who can do nothing but wait until every team has suffered a loss before they can toast that their record is safe for another year, Kenny Bostick can actually do something about it. He spent an entire year of his life setting a record number of sightings. Now sane folk know that records are meant to be broken but it means so much to Bostick's self esteem that he can't allow it to be broken by anybody but himself. It's really an exercise in vanity by all three characters except the other two still bear a sense of responsibility to the people around them. In the end one discovers his next wife while the other re-discovers his family when they learn that there are more important things in their life than a big year and birds. The acting is fine. Beautiful photography. The writing is weak and the script loses focus. One guy will throw his life away. It's the job of the other two characters to learn why he's so reckless. Learn why they would never do it themselves but can hardly lecture him themselves when their own behavior leaves much to be desired. It had potential. I liked it. But it lacks punch and misses too many points about our times. Where's the dialogue? There's an extended version with another 40 minutes. Was it cut away for a shorter fast-paced film?

1417371,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004LWZWBU,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","THE BIG YEAR (2011, 101 minutes), based on the nonfiction bookThe Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature, and Fowl Obsessionby Mark Obmascik, is a gentle, good-humored family film that I am super angry about having missed last year. Almost as angry as I was when I missed spotting a certain legendary Illinois woodpecker some years back ....A stingy-brim fedora-wearing chemical corporation tycoon (Steve Martin), an arrogant world-record-holding birdwatcher (Owen Wilson) and a computer engineer/programmer (Jack Black) prepare for their ""Big Year"".What in the world, you ask, is a ""Big Year""? For bird-watchers, it is THE year when they set out to achieve impossible record numbers of sightings. One thing I learned about this curious event is that hearing the mere song of the bird counts as a sighting even if the bird isn't actually seen.Also I watched as the richest - and most hapless - birdwatchers traveled ruthlessly from state to state. Where's the fun in all that? I can watch them all over my home town, my sister's farm or my own backyard.The inspired combination of Martin and Black, with the piquant bastard portrayed by Owens, seems a bit of a yawn. Believe me, it isn't a yawn - whoever made this film executed it with perfection. Much of it runs like a silent movie but you wouldn't know it at the time. It is hilarious at certain moments, beautifully subtle, and it taught me a thing or two about people standing on the shoulders of giants (where the view is always so much better). Oddly, I did not learn about birdwatching but I learned a lot about how much humans are like birds.There is a hilarious little educational riff at the start of the film: a picture-perfect mimicry of David Attenborough, courtesy of John Cleese. Or as Jack Black says, ""this English guy"". At first I thought it was Attenborough - and that may be the only fly in the birdseed.I recommend this fine movie for everyone. Naturally I got a kick out of the bird-spotting moments. As a lazy amateur lifelong birdwatcher, some of the details were fun for me. Keep a lookout for the men's and ladies' outhouses in Alaska, marked only with different birds so that only an expert birdwatcher could distinguish them. There are three spectacular scenes involving two different owls and one with a hummingbird, and I found these very moving since they are ""MY"" birds. Of course, the skill with the CGI here is stunning because for once, you have no idea it is CGI.Also, keep your eyes peeled for the deep parable this movie really is. Aside from some goofs about the locations of certain bird species and very laid-back performances by all involved, this film has a lot to say about obsessions and the way they can bleed life away from us.It isn't clear how much inspiration was taken from Obmascik's book - I haven't read it yet - but this certainly made me want to read it. Both items will be on my next order list. I have a feeling you'll feel the same too, after seeing this delightful, thoughtful and well-paced comedy.",5,Now I know why my mother and I did our best birdwatching from the kitchen,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,3004,"['BIG', 'YEAR', '2011', '101', 'minutes', 'based', 'nonfiction', 'bookThe', 'Big', 'Year', 'Tale', 'Man', 'Nature', 'Fowl', 'Obsessionby', 'Mark', 'Obmascik', 'gentle', 'good-humored', 'family', 'film', 'am', 'super', 'angry', 'having', 'missed', 'last', 'year', 'as', 'angry', 'was', 'when', 'missed', 'spotting', 'certain', 'legendary', 'Illinois', 'woodpecker', 'years', 'back', '.A', 'stingy-brim', 'fedora-wearing', 'chemical', 'corporation', 'tycoon', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'arrogant', 'world-record-holding', 'birdwatcher', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'computer', 'engineer/programmer', 'Jack', 'Black', 'prepare', 'Big', 'Year', 'world', 'ask', 'Big', 'Year', 'bird-watchers', 'THE', 'year', 'when', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'impossible', 'record', 'numbers', 'sightings', 'One', 'thing', 'learned', 'curious', 'event', 'hearing', 'mere', 'song', 'bird', 'sighting', 'even', 'bird', ""n't"", 'actually', 'seen.Also', 'watched', 'richest', 'most', 'hapless', 'birdwatchers', 'traveled', 'ruthlessly', 'state', 'state', 'Where', 'fun', 'can', 'watch', 'home', 'town', 'sister', 'farm', 'own', 'backyard.The', 'inspired', 'combination', 'Martin', 'Black', 'piquant', 'bastard', 'portrayed', 'Owens', 'bit', 'yawn', 'Believe', ""n't"", 'yawn', 'whoever', 'made', 'film', 'executed', 'perfection', 'Much', 'silent', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'hilarious', 'certain', 'moments', 'beautifully', 'subtle', 'taught', 'thing', 'two', 'people', 'standing', 'shoulders', 'giants', 'where', 'view', 'always', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Oddly', 'did', 'not', 'learn', 'birdwatching', 'learned', 'lot', 'how', 'much', 'humans', 'are', 'hilarious', 'little', 'educational', 'riff', 'start', 'film', 'picture-perfect', 'mimicry', 'David', 'Attenborough', 'courtesy', 'John', 'Cleese', 'Jack', 'Black', 'English', 'guy', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'Attenborough', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'fly', 'birdseed.I', 'recommend', 'fine', 'movie', 'everyone', 'Naturally', 'got', 'kick', 'bird-spotting', 'moments', 'lazy', 'amateur', 'birdwatcher', 'details', 'were', 'fun', 'Keep', 'lookout', 'men', 'ladies', 'outhouses', 'Alaska', 'marked', 'only', 'different', 'birds', 'only', 'expert', 'birdwatcher', 'could', 'distinguish', 'are', 'three', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'involving', 'two', 'different', 'owls', 'one', 'hummingbird', 'found', 'very', 'moving', 'are', 'MY', 'birds', 'course', 'skill', 'CGI', 'here', 'stunning', 'once', 'have', 'idea', 'CGI.Also', 'keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'deep', 'parable', 'movie', 'really', 'Aside', 'goofs', 'locations', 'certain', 'bird', 'species', 'very', 'laid-back', 'performances', 'involved', 'film', 'lot', 'say', 'obsessions', 'way', 'can', 'bleed', 'life', 'away', 'us.It', ""n't"", 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'inspiration', 'was', 'taken', 'Obmascik', 'book', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'yet', 'certainly', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'items', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'order', 'list', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same', 'too', 'seeing', 'delightful', 'thoughtful', 'well-paced', 'comedy']",The Big Year

While the synopsis isn't going to set the world on fire - Birding? - this bizarre yet mundane subject turns out to be the perfect subject for a comedy.  The Big Year probably isn't going to win any awards or make millions at the box office (note: it didn't), but it's the kind of well crafted and scripted filmmaking we used to enjoy back in the 1960s or 70s before things got complicated with lame gags and explosions.

That does not deter the facts that this is a beautifully documented birding film with enough outdoor vistas to fill anyone's nest. Great music too, even from a couple of those old Beetles guys. The story (""true story, only the facts were changed"") is birds, and how many can one count in a year, i.e. A Big Year. It turns into an avid confrontational race between Brad (Jack Black) a nuclear power plant techie, Kenny (Owen Wilson) reining champ, & Stu (Steve Martin) corporate head who's trying to retire from success. Brad needs financial help from parents (Dianne Wiest & Brian Dennehy) since this quest is ultra expensive. Brad also, along the trail, gets the hots for peacock gorgeous Ellie (Rashida Jones). So did I.Other family matters become sub-plots and drama in this comic race for the feather count. Kenny's wife Jessica (Rosamund Pike) makes any guy look the fool with her beautiful display as the beautiful birdhouse mate. Kenny dumbly leaves her home alone. Kenny tells her he's the ""Mozart"" of birders.  Stu gets a bit more moral support from wife Edith (Jo Beth Williams) and he does have a consciousness about business and family and occasionally falls from the hunt. There are some slapstick adventures in the rugged areas of North America due to the gung-ho style of the trio on their ""Big Year"" quests. Also enjoy the in-your-face bird tour boat captain, Annie Auklet (Angelica Huston) in a rare performance of a different specie. Plenty of other stars too. Not to mention hundreds of beautiful birds.This is a FOWL film, but not fouled with lots of bad language, nudity, or other lower intellect modes often used to get comedy to work. Expect humor in wholesomeness, and the great outdoors. John Audubon would have loved to serve as an extra in this film. It is society endorsed. Makes one want to eat sunflower seeds with a grin.There is some ending philosophy to the story. What is a win? Win at what cost? Even though 2 men lost, they seem to feel they were the ultimate winners. Biggest winner of The Big Year is birding fans. Raise those binoculars high, like a trophy.At first I considered 4  stars, because the last 2 films I theater viewed was ""The Help"" and ""Courageous"", both being 5 . The Big Year is not as deep in theme as those two, but just as entertaining, thus my 5 stars. Enjoy with a ticket or DVD.

The film is set around a competition to spot as many birds as possible within the US in a single year but acts as a metaphor for the personal problems in each of their years.Martin is a big-shot lawyer whose entire firm can't survive a couple of days without him. Wilson keeps ditching his wife whenever a short-tailed sparrow bat is mentioned. Black can't get his life together, losing a career and a wife to bird watching, which appears to be pretty expensive. Naturally, all three discover how to fix these problems while peering through binoculars at our CGI feathered friends.The Big Year isn't a comedy, nor a romance or drama. It's difficult to connect with the characters and understand their need to win the competition in the face of their own problems. It plods between talking heads scenes as characters criss-cross the country to identity birds. The three main characters were comically neutered and by the time the film was over, it was difficult to recount what had even happened. Overall, it's a missed opportunity given the talent involved.

Guild,"[1, 2]","I wrote a review on the book ""The Big Year"" by Mark Obmasick back on March 26,2004 and gave it 5 *'s.Little did I think at that time that the book would be turned into a movie.I went to the movie the first night it played at my local theatre ,here in Mississauga,Ontario.(Suburb of Toronto).I have been a serious Birder for over 20 years and have a Life List Of 602 for North America and 407 for Ontario,so it's pretty easy to relate to what this book and movie is all about.Although I do not have the fanatical inclination,resources or a marriage that would allow me to entertain the idea of a Big Year for North America.Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher did one in 1953.They were on the road for 100 days,covered 30,000 miles and saw 600 bird species.They wrote about their experiences in a book  ""Wild America"" published in 1955.It remains a Birding Classic.The biggest Year List I embarked on was when I got 301 in a year in Ontario.Jan 1-Dec 31).I enjoyed the movie very much.It followed the book fairly closely.However,there are several places where it is exaggerated,but this is understandable,being a movie to be enjoyed by people who are not Birders.The 3 main characters in the movie are fairly close to the ones in the book,but the names have been changed.I am sure people who are not even Birders at all will enjoy it.I looked around and could not identify any Birders in the audience,but it got a lot of laughs.Let's face it,the movie had to have a lot of comic aspects if it hoped to get wide appeal.After all,that is what is expected from Steve Martin.The movie might be somewhat disappointing to someone who hoped to learn much about birds or birding.However ,birders will see a lot in the film that will remind them of themselves,experiences they have had,and many places they have visited,though over many years.If this movie and/or book has got your interest and you would like to nnpow more about it.I highly recommend ""The Feather Quest"" a book by Pete Dunne .See my review dated October 23,2003.It's excellent!!",5,"An excellent movie for Birders,and even for those who aren't.",1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,2036,"['wrote', 'review', 'book', 'Big', 'Year', 'Mark', 'Obmasick', 'back', 'March', '26,2004', 'gave', '5', ""*'s.Little"", 'did', 'think', 'time', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'turned', 'movie.I', 'went', 'movie', 'first', 'night', 'played', 'local', 'theatre', 'here', 'Mississauga', 'Ontario', 'Suburb', 'Toronto', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'Birder', '20', 'years', 'have', 'Life', 'List', '602', 'North', 'America', '407', 'Ontario', 'pretty', 'easy', 'relate', 'what', 'book', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'fanatical', 'inclination', 'resources', 'marriage', 'would', 'allow', 'entertain', 'idea', 'Big', 'Year', 'North', 'America.Roger', 'Tory', 'Peterson', 'James', 'Fisher', 'did', 'one', '1953.They', 'were', 'road', '100', 'days', 'covered', '30,000', 'miles', 'saw', '600', 'bird', 'species.They', 'wrote', 'experiences', 'book', 'Wild', 'America', 'published', '1955.It', 'remains', 'Birding', 'Classic.The', 'biggest', 'Year', 'List', 'embarked', 'was', 'when', 'got', '301', 'year', 'Ontario.Jan', '1-Dec', '31', '.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'very', 'much.It', 'followed', 'book', 'fairly', 'closely.However', 'are', 'several', 'places', 'where', 'exaggerated', 'understandable', 'being', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'Birders.The', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'fairly', 'close', 'ones', 'book', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed.I', 'am', 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'Birders', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'looked', 'could', 'not', 'identify', 'Birders', 'audience', 'got', 'lot', 'laughs.Let', 'face', 'movie', 'had', 'have', 'lot', 'comic', 'aspects', 'hoped', 'get', 'wide', 'appeal.After', 'what', 'expected', 'Steve', 'Martin.The', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'someone', 'who', 'hoped', 'learn', 'much', 'birds', 'birding.However', 'birders', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'film', 'will', 'remind', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'places', 'have', 'visited', 'many', 'years.If', 'movie', 'and/or', 'book', 'got', 'interest', 'would', 'like', 'nnpow', 'more', 'it.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Feather', 'Quest', 'book', 'Pete', 'Dunne', '.See', 'review', 'dated', 'October', '23,2003.It', 'excellent']",The Big Year

To my great surprise, Big Year has not only a large handful of funny moments, but also some truly intelligent, touching moments.The fine script is what makes this one run, and the direction is playful enough to bring it to life. The takes on marriage and relationships are a little less predictable than usual, and sometimes even insightful. The ending is not the standard happy bs, and all in all Big Year succeeds as both a pleasant comedy, a decent almost-chick-flick, and a very nice introduction to birding. It won't do for birders what Best In Show did for dog folks...but that's probably a generous gesture!I do love its love for birds and nature in general, and that spirit makes this film shine more than any of the performances (Black wins; his timing is equal to Martin's and their friendship is a highlight). The refusal of the movie to really laugh at birders, but rather show their love as based in a wonderful sense of awe at the wonders of our planet, is also a welcome treat. And I'm no birder! But I sure do admire their admiration of birds. Imagine life without birds...ouch.The one real negative here is the exceptionally grainy and pixelated dvd. This is a TERRIBLE transfer. And you know what? I think this is a big scam the studios are starting to pull: they want to sell the blu-rays at a higher price so they make these look crappy by comparison. I've seen many many more bad recent dvd transfers in 2011-2012 than in any of the previous few years. I often think I'm imagining it...then I see a great recent dvd transfer and remember how perfect they CAN look, if the studio wants them to. And time and again the best dvd transfers are the ones without a blu-ray edition! You do the math. Hint: it's a plus for the studios and a minus for the consumers.So: fine film, but avoid the dvd, and you know what? Don't even buy the BD, the studio doesn't deserve your money.

In fact, there's enough humor in watching the antics of the three main characters all of whom are trying to out-smart and out-sleaze each other to capture the title of the greatest birdwatcher of the year. Jack Black, Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson are the perfect choices for their respective roles. Owen Wilson is the current record holder who's obsessed with maintaining his high perch , but his record is being stalked by Steve Martin and Jack Black who are trying to upset the established pecking order, with Martin as the driven company exec who unsuccessfully tries to leave his business, and Jack Black as the ne'er do well son who only seems to have one passion and talent in life, which is that he can identify almost any bird just from hearing a portion of its call.Most of the fun is watching the antics of these three looney birdwatchers as they all chase the Holy Grail of birdwatching, which is being the birder to record the most number of bird species in a single year. Wilson plays sort of the ""bad guy"" incumbent, although he's really too charming and disarming to make much of a real bad guy. Martin's plans keep being sabotaged by a couple of members of his executive staff who aren't quite ready to run the company on their own, and Jack is hampered by modest finances (it takes a lot of money to do this what with all the air travel), and a father who's not very sympathetic about his son's passion (played by veteran actor Brian Denehy).The movie actually qualifies as a pretty amazing travel flick, as the birders must flock to every nook and cranny of the U.S., from the Aleutian Islands to Maine to the Florida keys and almost everywhere in between to see all the birds. It's a truly delightful movie about an unlikely subject which manages to entertain  and make you laugh even if you know zip about birds and birding.

1417414,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZWBU,Mark Turner,"[6, 7]","It's always a pleasure to find a movie that you thought would be terrible and being proven wrong. After the disaster that was GULLIVER'S TRAVELS I was certain that THE BIG YEAR starring Jack Black would be another travesty of film with him mugging for the camera the same way he always does. Instead I found a delightful film that I know I could watch again and enjoy.Black stars as Brad Harris, a birder (bird viewing enthusiast) with an uncanny ability to know a bird by the song it sings. The main even for bird viewers is known as a Big Year, a year long event where they try to see as many species of birds as they can. When this 36 year old gets news his ex-wife is remarrying he decides this is the year to take time off from work to fulfill his lifelong wish to do a Big Year.Stu Preissler (Steve Martin) has decided to retire for the second time from the multinational corporation he is CEO of. While the executives in charge want him to stay on, he too has decided that this is the best opportunity he will have to do his own Big Year. With his wife's blessings, he heads out to start watching.Which leaves our third main character Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson). Kenny holds the record for the highest number of birds seen, over 800. His is the record to beat and one that he holds dear. So much so that he puts his record above everything else in his life including his wife (Rosamund Pike) and her desire to have children.When word gets out the to bird crowd about a major even bringing thousands of species to one location, they all head to begin their counts. Bumping into one another on a boat, Brad and Stu strike up a friendship based on their love of birds neither one admitting to doing a Big Year. As the sightings escalate and they run into one another more often, they get closer and finally Brad admits what he is doing. But Stu holds back.But Kenny recognizes what's happening and tries to play the two friends off of one another slowing them down in their quest at the same time. This enables him to continue on and attempt to set a new world record. But fences are mended and the friends continue to try and beat the already established record.Along the way Brad faces two more challenges. One is his father (Brian Dennehy) a blue collar man who can't understand his son's quest. He considers him to be a failure rather than a man who has a chance to take the crown from Kenny. Brad also finds himself falling in love with another birder, a young woman who can make bird calls better than anyone he meets. Unfortunately he discovers she has a boyfriend. Along with the birding itself, these two stumbling blocks offer plot devices that fit nicely into the whole story going on.Each of these three men comes from various financial backgrounds and families, each has their strengths and weaknesses and each has a goal in mind when it comes to their Big Year. But as the story unfolds we not only have the chance to witness some breath taking scenery but to get a fully flushed out story involving all three characters.My biggest fear as I began this film was the actors. Black, Martin and Wilson have all had films in the past where a director's complete lack of control resulted in an actor taking over and ruining the production, trying to use their usual shtick thinking it was funny when in truth it had become boring. None of that exists here. Both Black and Martin give exceptional performances and flush out their characters to the fullest without resorting to the old standby laugh getters. Instead we have characters that we care about and who we hope will remain friends. Wilson's character is the saddest of the three without his own being aware of it. One hopes he will one day find the joy the other two achieve by the end of the film.Don't let the simple concept of this film fool you. It offers so much more than one would think a movie about watching birds could. It also offers Black a chance at redemption in my book, giving him the chance to actually act rather than play the buffoon. Let's just hope he continues to do so.",5,BIRDS OF A FEATHER,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4064,"['always', 'pleasure', 'find', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'being', 'proven', 'wrong', 'disaster', 'was', 'GULLIVER', 'TRAVELS', 'was', 'certain', 'BIG', 'YEAR', 'starring', 'Jack', 'Black', 'would', 'be', 'travesty', 'film', 'mugging', 'camera', 'same', 'way', 'always', 'Instead', 'found', 'delightful', 'film', 'know', 'could', 'watch', 'again', 'enjoy.Black', 'stars', 'Brad', 'Harris', 'birder', 'bird', 'viewing', 'enthusiast', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'know', 'bird', 'song', 'main', 'even', 'bird', 'viewers', 'known', 'Big', 'Year', 'year', 'long', 'event', 'where', 'try', 'see', 'many', 'species', 'birds', 'can', 'When', '36', 'year', 'old', 'news', 'ex-wife', 'remarrying', 'year', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'fulfill', 'lifelong', 'wish', 'do', 'Big', 'Year.Stu', 'Preissler', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'decided', 'retire', 'second', 'time', 'multinational', 'corporation', 'CEO', 'executives', 'charge', 'want', 'stay', 'too', 'decided', 'best', 'opportunity', 'will', 'have', 'do', 'own', 'Big', 'Year', 'wife', 'blessings', 'out', 'start', 'watching.Which', 'third', 'main', 'character', 'Kenny', 'Bostick', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Kenny', 'record', 'highest', 'number', 'birds', 'seen', '800', 'record', 'beat', 'one', 'dear', 'So', 'much', 'record', 'everything', 'else', 'life', 'including', 'wife', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'desire', 'have', 'children.When', 'word', 'out', 'bird', 'crowd', 'major', 'even', 'bringing', 'thousands', 'species', 'one', 'location', 'head', 'begin', 'counts', 'Bumping', 'one', 'boat', 'Brad', 'Stu', 'strike', 'up', 'friendship', 'based', 'love', 'birds', 'one', 'admitting', 'doing', 'Big', 'Year', 'sightings', 'escalate', 'run', 'one', 'more', 'often', 'get', 'closer', 'finally', 'Brad', 'what', 'doing', 'Stu', 'back.But', 'Kenny', 'what', 'happening', 'tries', 'play', 'two', 'friends', 'one', 'slowing', 'down', 'quest', 'same', 'time', 'continue', 'attempt', 'set', 'new', 'world', 'record', 'fences', 'are', 'mended', 'friends', 'continue', 'try', 'beat', 'already', 'established', 'way', 'Brad', 'two', 'more', 'challenges', 'One', 'father', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'blue', 'collar', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'son', 'quest', 'be', 'failure', 'rather', 'man', 'who', 'chance', 'take', 'crown', 'Kenny', 'Brad', 'also', 'falling', 'love', 'birder', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'bird', 'better', 'anyone', 'Unfortunately', 'boyfriend', 'birding', 'two', 'stumbling', 'blocks', 'offer', 'plot', 'devices', 'fit', 'nicely', 'whole', 'story', 'going', 'on.Each', 'three', 'men', 'various', 'financial', 'backgrounds', 'families', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'goal', 'mind', 'when', 'Big', 'Year', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'chance', 'witness', 'breath', 'taking', 'scenery', 'get', 'fully', 'flushed', 'out', 'story', 'involving', 'three', 'characters.My', 'biggest', 'fear', 'began', 'film', 'was', 'actors', 'Black', 'Martin', 'Wilson', 'have', 'had', 'films', 'past', 'where', 'director', 'complete', 'lack', 'control', 'resulted', 'actor', 'taking', 'ruining', 'production', 'trying', 'use', 'usual', 'shtick', 'thinking', 'was', 'funny', 'when', 'truth', 'had', 'become', 'boring', 'None', 'here', 'Black', 'Martin', 'give', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'flush', 'out', 'characters', 'fullest', 'resorting', 'old', 'standby', 'laugh', 'getters', 'Instead', 'have', 'characters', 'care', 'who', 'hope', 'will', 'remain', 'friends', 'Wilson', 'character', 'saddest', 'three', 'own', 'being', 'aware', 'One', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'find', 'joy', 'other', 'two', 'achieve', 'end', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'simple', 'concept', 'film', 'fool', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'watching', 'birds', 'could', 'also', 'Black', 'chance', 'redemption', 'book', 'giving', 'chance', 'actually', 'act', 'rather', 'play', 'buffoon', 'Let', 'just', 'hope', 'do', 'so']",The Big Year

So how is that when combining all these stars, it fails to be memorable comedy?A big year is explained as being someone who dedicates a whole year of their life hunting, chasing, and photographing birds. The past winner was played by Owen Wilson who saw 728 birds, which is the current record. Steve Martin plays a businessman who is about to retire and wants to have a big year, and Jack Black is someone who hates his job and his passion is achieving a new record. Jack and Steve meet along the way on their Big Year, and Owen Wilson's character is defending his title and trying to stop them from breaking his record. Along the way they discover love, and what really matters more then bird watching.Sound interesting to you? Then watch it. Sound dull? Then don't bother, you aren't missing much. The plot is as boring to explain as what most of this movie was to watch. There is very little comedy. Now and then Steve Martin will make you chuckle, but not enough for me to even say this is a light-hearted comedy. It's more a light-hearted drama with a few tiny humorous spots thrown in here and there.I don't get this movie tho, it was meant to be a comedy, but had none, it's based on a true story, supposedly, but left me thinking, why would anyone bother to do this? And the acting talent I really expected something better from. Either a funnier movie, or something better in the acting department that says ""OK, you did this to showcase your talents"" but no, that's not it either.I find it puzzling how this all came together in the first place, and why?

Owen Wilson is a former ""Big Year"" winner and current record holder.  Steve Martin and Jack Black have been dreaming of the adventure and excitement of this competition for some time and have decided this is their year to go after the win, and to break Owens record.To be a true competitor in this you not only have to seriously know your stuff about the birds to be able to identify them by sight and/or by sound, it also requires you to chase all over North America  (lots of travel time, lots of expense and little luxury).  Flying, driving, boats, helicopters, bicycling, canoeing, hiking, bad weather, mosquitoes, etc. are all part of the chase for collecting those precious bird sightings.Owen is rich and lets nothing get in the way of his quest, and is somewhat crafty/devious in hindering others who might be competition for his record.  Steve is also wealthy and is supposed to be retired, but his corporation is constantly after his time and pulling him away from the quest, and Jack is not wealthy and is trying to compete while also working full time and dealing with a father who doesn't understand him and is very disapproving of Jack.Steve and Jack become friends and later ""team up"" (supporting each other's efforts - as it is a competition among individuals not teams) because as much as they each desperately want the win for themselves, it's most important that Owen lose.

We had already seen the DVD version that she checked out from the library. I have been a birder for 40 years and my wife joined me 24 years ago. This movie has an impressive amount of accurate information in it about birding. We have noticed a couple of flaws (There are no penguins in the Aleutians). We were both thrilled, though, to see such big-name actors playing birders. It is true that people who do a ""Big Year"" are rare individuals as few can afford to spend so much time (and money) during any one calendar year looking for the little feathered dinosaurs. Personally, I find the geographic boundaries quite arbitrary. Birds don't respect political borders. Anyone who beats the record for doing a Big Year certainly does not qualify as the ""best birder in the world"" as the region does not even cover the whole Nearctic region, much less the world. I have given up keeping a North American bird list long ago and have even let my ""world list"" go by the wayside (I am guessing it is somewhere around 2,000). But we have seen the movie four times and plan to watch it again with some birding friends of ours. This movie deserves ten stars!I saw a video review by someone who represented the masses and gave this movie a poor grade. He said that the opportunity for comedy was squandered and that the talent was wasted on this film. I was offended as I believe that the dialogue and humor were very witty and amazingly suitable to the subject matter. The humor and sentiment you see in the movie are exactly the kind you expect to come from real birders. While few people will have the real life experiences represented in this film, it will give genuine insight into what really goes on in real birding experience, for that is the point of this movie; not to deliver the same kind of comedy that is in all of the mass-produced productions written with the same formula. This film should provide a refreshing and unfamiliar adventure for novices in the field of wildlife appreciation though from a competitive perspective. I think that the humor in this movie simply flew over the reviewer's head as did the birds.By the way, my wife and I saw our ""lifer"" Colima Warblers probably hiking the same trail on a stressful hot sunny day at Big Bend. We ran out of water half way through our hike and my wife managed a partially colapsed lung during our ordeal. But it was worth it.

I think they only put this in the comedy section because they have an all star cast of funny people! Otherwise, you get other actors and do the same movie and people would be asking why is this movie in the comedy section?I really like this movie, but they need to really know how to put the movie in the right category. This movie is so much of a Adventure Drama that it wouldn't fit anywhere else. Why is this so? The actors travel in the movie to multiple places in the whole movie and they even show you how and what they use to travel. They talk about travel and where they have gone and everything is about their adventures. Heck, they even show how one of their birds travel to place to place. So, it's definitely an adventure movie.Is this movie a drama movie? There a great deal of relationships problems, emotional problems, job suffering,  and everyone favorite life choices based decisions that makes you feel like hating each character in the movie. If that's not drama to you, you don't know what drama is!!!Now the big question, is this a comedy? Heck no! What in the world did people thought was funny is the real question here? Any one that found this movie really funny tell me what part? Where was the humor?Here's examples, of what people may think could be funny but wasn't really. When Steve Martin ran towards the plane and was about to fly away. Owen Wilson saw Martin running towards the plane, but didn't say anything about it and grin about it. What? Was that supposed to be funny? Made me kind of mad about it. Missing a flight that won't be able to take again until the next week. Oh I would hate if that happened to me. Oh that really made me feel like it was a drama than made me feel like laughing about it. Who really thought that was hilarious. Is one sick person!Was it supposed to be funny when Owen Wilson hops a fence, while Martin was distracted by a old lady. Then, Wilson quickly takes a picture of the bird and then he hops over the fence again out? And, the fact that Martin never knew about Wilson action was supposed to make that funny? Really??? I saw it - I thought about it, and not even a chuckle came out of me. I like to add that the jungle music and narration playing in the background while Wilson was doing his action didn't make me laugh out loud. He didn't look funny doing it. He didn't fall over doing it. He didn't look great doing it. He just did it and it wasn't a funny thing to it.Why in the world did those idiots put this movie in the comedy section? Really?

I have always been a fan of the three leads individually, now seeing them all together is a real treat.Stu (Steve Martin), Kenny (Owen Wilson), and Brad (Jack Black) are in a super competative race to be the best 'bird finder' of sorts.  They are all avid bird watchers and now are definitely going for it all!  Brad has to first find some extra financing, this through his parents.  These two are nicely portrayed by Dianne Wiest (love her) and Brian Dennehy.This one cycles nicely in and out of hilarious and is an interesting viewing experience also.  I learned some new information from this, and J. Audubon would be proud of this movie.  One film of late that just allows you to laugh and take a load off, possibly pick up a few new things too.  All three of these actors are able to go out on a limb (please forgive me that one!) to get a laugh out of you, quite easily.  That is something I can appreciate from a movie again and again, this one is just that.I didn't know much about bird watching before this, except for noticing what is around the Midwest.

Just about every year is a ""Big Year"" for birders as they always keep track of what birds they have seen as well as when and where. Most don't have the time or resources to cross the country several times a year, so they compete within their state.The film shows some aspects of birders such as how life interferes with birding. Or how a birder would rather be in Brownsville, Texas at a dump site than in Paris, France. I have discovered that Birders are also acutely aware of things such as global warming as southern birds move north into new areas. They also know the points of illegal crossings as they visit the southern border at odd hours.The movie has 3 diverse quirky characters competing nation wide to be the best birder.

1417461,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004LWZWBU,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 5]","Jack Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson are in one movie, but despite the three names in the leading roles, ""The Big Year"" was hardly a commercial success, reaching 9th place in the U.S. box office charts in its first week. But is the film so bad? Directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada""), the film has some nice moments, though it seems the director is not really sure what to do with the unique subject matter - the Big Year - as if being afraid of offending anyone.Doing a Big Year is the ultimate dream for every birder - viewing (or hearing) as many different kinds of birds as possible in a specific area, like across North America. This means that three characters thirty-something computer programmer Brad Harris (Black), a big company's CEO Stu Preissler (Martin) and the current record holder Kenny Bostick (Wilson) will be chasing more than 700 bird species, from the Gulf Coast area to Attu Island.This may be a great idea for film on paper (""The Big Year"" is based on Mark Obmascik's book of the same title), but to turn it into a good film you need a good story, which ""The Big Year"" does not have. Many talented players appear - Anjelica Huston, Rashida Jones, Tim Blake Nelson and Dianne Wiest, to name a few, but they are given little to do in the film. Only Brian Dennehy as Brad's father and Rosamund Pike as Kenny's wife are memorable.But the biggest disappointment is the three leads, whose characters and stories remain bland at best. With these talent players, the filmmakers could have made a low-key drama, a romantic comedy, a farce or even a satire. Well-acted and beautifully-shot, ""The Big Year,"" either as a comedy or a drama, simply fails to find its own voice other than the interesting subject matter.
