The divorce rate is still 50%. Statistics are worse for couples living together before marriage.In fact, recently a couple I was preparing to marry split up weeks before the date. She was planning a wedding while he was planning to leave her. So I watched this movie to do a little cheering up. As I did so, I gained a lot of perspective and insight.In this hilarious movie (I do want to emphasize it is for mature audiences), Father Frank works in hilarious ways to wipe the innocence off of the faces of the young couple. While they are seeing hearts and roses, he wants them to see and talk about what is real to them. By creating off the chart stressful situations, he helps them to see past the romance and into the reality.I am actually considering this movie as required viewing for future couples!

655211,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005JPQE,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[11, 16]","As earlier reviewers here have correctly noted, the grandfather of LICENSE TO WED is the 1930s - 1940s type of screwball comedy.  Here, though, instead of a prior betrothal to a Ralph Bellamy-style nobody, an anti-fraternization policy in the workplace, or some other calamity like being drafted into the armed services, the comedic block here is a Roman Catholic priest, played to the hilt by Robin Williams in his patented gonzo style.  It's a witty characterization with witty lines, and I doubt many actors of his generationcould  pull off the trick of seeming charmingly reassuring yet hopelessly rigid so well.  The two aspects of this personality almost came off consistently; and given the general mess that LICENSE TO WED is, he struggled valiantly with his character.  That is not the same as saying that it worked.That's only the beginning of the trouble in this flaccid movie, because Robin Williams as Roman Catholic priest does not clash realistically (or entertainingly) with his comedic antagonists, a hapless upper-middle-class couple whose trouble begins when the bride-to-be insists on being married in her family's traditional church.  (Ironically, the script observes, none of the family members had actually been to a church service there in more than ten years, and they remembered the Robin Williams character warmly, but only vaguely.)It so happens that the comedic couple had actually been living together for some time, and thought that marriage planning would consist simply of arranging the logistics and brushing up on marriage rituals.  But then they run into the immovable priest (Williams), who insists they take his (accelerated) marriage-preparation classes to qualify for a marriage ceremony in ""his"" church.  The two halves of this movie -- the priest versus his initiates -- just don't play off each other; and we the audience are more likely to feel, if we feel anything at all, a little pity for the couple instead of being entertained or enlightened.  Despite our couple's history of sharing an apartment and a bed, the priest orders those poor souls to remain celibate AND chaste for the three weeks until the actual wedding service can take place. (IMHO any couple who loved each other so much without qualm, and had been living together so successfully, would have told the priest that even if THEY went to Hell, they'd probably see him there first!)Things get pretty weird when we get farther into this story and the plotworks are obliged to thicken.  In an attempt to rev things up, the priest shows an absolute delight in raising the barre for marriage qualification higher and higher.  I confess I don't really know whether he intended to frustrate them out of their engagement, or if he's simply on a power trip in which he holds his interpretations (or OPINIONS) of church dogma as superior to the actual well-being and instruction of the nervous couple.Or maybe it was just plain meanness.  The only really fresh plot device in this film is in stunningly bad taste: trying to find humor in the character of an intermediary, an annoyingly supercilious ten-year-old boy enrolled in some kind of weird cleric-of-the-future program and at the priest's beck and call.  ***ONE SPOILER*** One instance of this ""fun"" is when the boy breaks into the couple-to-be's apartment and plants an electronic bug inside the bedroom lampshade, just to eavesdrop on any unwitting pillow talk!*******MINI-RANT***:  Along with the overall muddle and slack, there is one enormous and inexcusable deviation from reality in LICENSE TO WED.  Despite having been vetted by three writers and twice as many production staff, the script uses terms to refer to or about Williams' post that are consistently, and absolutely, wrong.  There is no doubt that his character is anything other than that of a Roman Catholic churchman.  Yet we the audience NEVER hear the terms ""Father,"" ""Priest,"" or even ""Padre.""  Instead, we consistently hear him addressed as ""Reverend"" and his position as ""Minister.""  This simply is not the case. With all the multi-millions Hollywood movies cost these days, could they not, for realism's sake, have engaged for a day or two the services of an actual Catholic priest as technical consultant??  Only Protestant Christians use the terms ""Reverend,"" ""The Reverend,"" or ""Minister,"" and not every single denomination at that. Certainly the Robin Williams character would never have tolerated such misnomers, and more to the point, even a family full of highly lapsed Catholics would recognize that such Protestant terminology is wrong.  This is a core blunder, not a relatively minor semantic scruple like confusing ""Episcopal"" (for things Episcopal) with ""Episcopalian"" (for people, and only people, Episcopal).****IMHO everyone should stay away from this mess.  Please feel free to spend the eight bucks on another movie (at the time of this writing, practically everything else) or a better DVD.  Or give the money to a charity or a church, as is your right as an American.  But please do not subject yourself to the IQ-draining goop that is so much of LICENSE TO WED.  Promising writing, sound casting, and an intermittently witty script did not a movie make.",2,THE WHOLE IS LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,5209,"['earlier', 'reviewers',

655213,A27EH1X1KIK2JA,B00005JPQE,Andres Escobar,"[4, 7]","It was never my intention to go into this movie, I had no interest on it, and didn't think that I would enjoy it and that's just what happened.Throughout the movie we follow Ben (John Krasinski) and Sadie (Mandy Moore). A couple that after about a year of dating is ready to tie the knot. Off course weddings are always exiting but for Ben, and might as well just say, Sadie, this is the road to hell. Sadie, not only wants to get married at the church that her grandfather built, but wants to be married by Revered Frank, both decisions which Ben hardly accepts. Before anything can happen, Reverend Frank tells the couple that they must pass a course that will prove if they are ready to get married or not. Huh? Exactly. All of the tests need to be taken before the wedding, and being a three months course, it gets pretty rushed given that the wedding its in three weeks. I must say that the tasks are pretty ridiculous, and that what wants to be funny is not. There a few scenes that do make you laugh tough, but no joke is memorable. The Family scenes are funny, but each character lacks the laughter.Mandy was cute in ""A Walk to Remember"", and she was cute in this too, but she's just not funny, and John, being the first time I see him in a movie, didn't do a bad job. One thing that really got me was Robbie Williams, he has never been my type of comedian and this movie proofs that the best comedians to some might be the worst to others.Over all the movie doesn't work as a comedy, the storyline is not the best and most situations are not believable, like having the little ""Choir Boy"" played by Josh Flitter, actually breaking into their house, opening the door with a Credit Card in about 3 seconds, placing a microphone in their bedroom as a sort of spying tool, and they not noticing for after 2 weeks; believe me if I was about to get married I would not go to Reverend Frank and neither should you.",2,One Pretty Bad Wedding!,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,1916,"['was', 'never', 'intention', 'go', 'movie', 'had', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'just', 'what', 'happened.Throughout', 'movie', 'follow', 'Ben', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Sadie', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'couple', 'year', 'dating', 'ready', 'tie', 'knot', 'Off', 'course', 'weddings', 'are', 'always', 'exiting', 'Ben', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'say', 'Sadie', 'road', 'hell', 'Sadie', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'married', 'church', 'grandfather', 'built', 'be', 'married', 'Revered', 'Frank', 'decisions', 'Ben', 'hardly', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'couple', 'must', 'pass', 'course', 'will', 'prove', 'are', 'ready', 'get', 'married', 'not', 'Huh', 'Exactly', 'tests', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'wedding', 'being', 'three', 'months', 'course', 'pretty', 'rushed', 'given', 'wedding', 'three', 'weeks', 'must', 'say', 'tasks', 'are', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'be', 'funny', 'not', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', 'make', 'tough', 'joke', 'memorable', 'Family', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'character', 'laughter.Mandy', 'was', 'cute', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'was', 'cute', 'too', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'John', 'being', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'got', 'was', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'never', 'been', 'type', 'comedian', 'movie', 'best', 'comedians', 'might', 'be', 'worst', 'others.Over', 'movie', ""n't"", 'work', 'comedy', 'storyline', 'not', 'best', 'most', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'having', 'little', 'Choir', 'Boy', 'played', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'actually', 'breaking', 'house', 'opening', 'door', 'Credit', 'Card', 'about', '3', 'seconds', 'placing', 'microphone', 'bedroom', 'sort', 'spying', 'tool', 'not', 'noticing', '2', 'weeks', 'believe', 'was', 'about', 'get', 'married', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'should']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)
655214,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPQE,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 9]","There are parts within `License to Wed' that will make you laugh, and even a few scenes that may make you laugh hard, but in the end `License to Wed' cannot be called a good film because quite frankly, it's not.  I really wanted to love this film, and while I did like it to a certain extent there were still times when I felt it was almost a wasted evening.  I love me some Mandy Moore and really hope that she picks up the ball and makes some better role choices in the near future because her recent film choices have been less than desirable.  Now, `License to Wed' is light years beyond the ridiculous and utterly wasted effort that was `Because I Said So' but it is no where near the brilliance that was `Saved' so you see my dilemma.  It's fair to midland at best.The film follows a young and adorable couple Ben and Sadie who are undeniably in love.  At Sadie's parents thirtieth wedding anniversary party Ben decides to purpose and this thus starts our little outing.  Sadie has always dreamed of getting married at the same church her parents were wed but in order for them to do so they need to take a marriage preparation course put on by Reverend Frank.  It becomes quickly apparent to Ben and to the audience that Frank is a psycho but for some strange reason no one else can see that.  Ben quickly grows tired of Frank's rules and mind games and soon starts to wage war with the man in cloth only to drive a wedge further and further between Sadie and himself.Mandy Moore is still adorable here but she falls a little flat due to the poor plot and dialog.  John Krasinski is almost wasted here.  He ends up being the punch line most of the time, leaving everyone around him to bring whatever funny there is at his expense.  In fact, he finds himself upstaged almost every step of the way, even when the only other `actor' on the screen is a mechanical baby (who by the way should have been in EVERY scene).  This brings us to Robin Williams.  Now I have not seen `Man of the Year' but I hear it was not that rewarding either, so it appears to me that Williams is running into a bit of a snag in his career, going the way of De Niro as of late.  This is sad because we all know he has so much more to offer.  He offers nothing in `License to Wed' besides over the top antics that are at times extremely annoying.  In fact, the funniest thing about Reverend Frank is the choir boy that follows him around everywhere he goes.`License to Wed' is not going to be a film you remember, which is kind of a word in its defense.  While there is nothing outstandingly wonderful to remember, there is nothing painstakingly horrible to remember either.  Williams is annoying but forgivable and while the plot is far too overdone it is not like we expected something revolutionary or truly inventive.  `License to Wed' is just a movie to pass the time.  Something to watch and that's really it.  I may never watch it again, but this is the type of film that doesn't warrant repeated viewings.  I laughed a bit, sure, but I'll laugh more watching something else.",2,"Not bad, but not good either; just meh...",1198713600,"12 27, 2007",2007,3062,"['are', 'parts', 'License', 'Wed', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'make', 'laugh', 'hard', 'end', 'License', 'Wed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'good', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'not', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'did', 'like', 'certain', 'extent', 'were', 'still', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'was', 'almost', 'wasted', 'evening', 'love', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'really', 'hope', 'up', 'ball', 'better', 'role', 'choices', 'near', 'future', 'recent', 'film', 'choices', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'desirable', 'Now', 'License', 'Wed', 'light', 'years', 'ridiculous', 'utterly', 'wasted', 'effort', 'was', 'Said', 'So', 'where', 'brilliance', 'was', 'Saved', 'so', 'see', 'dilemma', 'fair', 'midland', 'best.The', 'film', 'young', 'adorable', 'couple', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'who', 'are', 'undeniably', 'love', 'Sadie', 'parents', 'thirtieth', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'party', 'Ben', 'purpose', 'thus', 'little', 'outing', 'Sadie', 'always', 'dreamed', 'getting', 'married', 'same', 'church', 'parents', 'were', 'wed', 'order', 'do', 'so', 'need', 'take', 'marriage', 'preparation', 'course', 'put', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'Ben', 'audience', 'Frank', 'psycho', 'strange', 'reason', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'see', 'Ben', 'quickly', 'tired', 'Frank', 'rules', 'mind', 'games', 'soon', 'starts', 'wage', 'war', 'man', 'cloth', 'only', 'drive', 'wedge', 'further', 'further', 'Sadie', 'himself.Mandy', 'Moore', 'still', 'adorable', 'here', 'little', 'flat', 'due', 'poor', 'plot', 'dialog', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'almost', 'wasted', 'here', 'up', 'being', 'punch', 'line', 'most', 'time', 'leaving', 'everyone', 'around', 'bring', 'funny', 'expense', 'fact', 'upstaged', 'almost', 'step', 'way', 'even', 'when', 'only', 'other', 'actor', 'screen', 'mechanical', 'baby', 'who', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'EVERY', 'scene', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Now', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Man', 'Year', 'hear', 'was', 'not', 'rewarding', 'Williams', 'running', 'bit', 'snag', 'career', 'going', 'way', 'De', 'Niro', 'late', 'sad', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'nothing', 'License', 'Wed', 'besides', 'top', 'antics', 'are', 'times', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'fact', 'funniest', 'thing', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'choir', 'boy', 'around', 'everywhere', 'License', 'Wed', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'film', 'remember', 'kind', 'word', 'defense', 'nothing', 'outstandingly', 'wonderful', 'remember', 'nothing', 'painstakingly', 'horrible', 'remember', 'either', 'Williams', 'annoying', 'forgivable', 'plot', 'far', 'too', 'overdone', 'not', 'expected', 'something', 'revolutionary', 'truly', 'inventive', 'License', 'Wed', 'just', 'movie', 'pass', 'time', 'Something', 'watch', 'really', 'may', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'type', 'film', ""n't"", 'warrant', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'laughed', 'bit', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'more', 'watching', 'something', 'else']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)

You did your best, but even Jesus himself could not have redeemed this one. The one star is for Robin Williams and his best effort.Ben Murphy (John Krasinski) and Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) got engaged at her parents' 30th wedding anniversary party, which is to say right in front of all the family and friends. And right in front of all those people, Sadie tells Ben that it has always been her dream to marry at St. Anthony's, where Father Frank (Robin Williams) is the rather unconventional pastor. He wears a Roman collar, and he's called Father sometimes and Reverend sometimes, and so it is natural for the audience to assume he's Roman Catholic; that is, celebate. This increases the ""humor"" of the widely distributed poster of him in bed between the two of them.Anyway, they go to Father Frank, who has one opening two years from now, or a cancellation in three weeks. Naturally, they accept the three weeks date. Father Frank will not agree to perform the ceremony unless they go through his pre-nuptial training course, which is mostly an opportunity for lots of silly sight jokes and slapstick. Through it all, Sadie is completely controlled by Father Frank and willing to do things just the way he says, while Ben would much rather circumvent the rules, especially the one about no sex until after the wedding, even though they've been living together for some time. Father Frank knows that, does not express the least disapproval, but uses the most underhanded tricks to maintain his control over the prenuptial ""boot camp.""Robin Williams' lines are mostly pretty clever, but the sight jokes (a pair of robot babies to care for) are just stupid. Yes, of course it all works out in the end, but it just was not a good movie.

This film was released right during blockbuster season in the summer of 2007, had poor reviews, and generally didn't find an audience. Robin Williams (who is somewhat low key in this movie) and his over-acting might have been part of the turn off, as well as the ridiculous preview. After watching the movie, I recommend it because I laughed several times in spite of its numerous flaws.Ben (Krasinski) and Sadie (Moore) live together. After Ben proposes, Sadie insists they go through a marriage preparation course given by Pastor Frank (Williams), her childhood pastor. The previews hint at all the ridiculous steps that Frank makes the couple go through. This is where the movie might lose you. The steps are utterly preposterous and unrealistic. And only Ben seems to question Frank's tactics. After Father Frank almost destroys their relationship, no one bothers to think that Frank might be the problem.This movie has several laughs and a lot of stapstick comedy.

For me it was 90 minutes well spent and I might actually purchase this movie and watch it with my friends.The character of the reverend is kind of creepy of how he tries to ruin the couple's marriage, spies on the them through a wiretap planted in their apartment, and nearly kills them when making Sadie drive blindfolded (I definitely don't recommend that at home because that is a one way ticket to the afterlife!). He has some problems and needs counseling but I thought his ultimate motive to lower the divorce rate and make a successful marriage work was good. He was just should have been arrested for nearly killing the couple by having Sadie drive blindfolded!In closing this is a very funny comedy. I recommend that you do not take it too seriously and enjoy whatever the story is trying to tell you. Because in the end it is only a movie and it is meant not to be taken so seriously.

655237,A8TJ9HG21EJMJ,B00005JPQE,"H. Shafer ""smart one""","[8, 13]","Contains SpoilersI'm a huge movie buff and love all sorts of movies, but when I went to go see License to Wed with my friends, I wasn't a very willing participant. I'd heard terrible reviews about the movie and I was convinced I wouldn't like it as well, but  guess my five star rating shows you can never let other people's opinions dictate your own.License to Wed will never be the type to win an Oscar, or to be noteworthy by critics. It was made for the general audience, but when you see past the corny, yet laughable jokes and the fact that it's a chick flick--there are really great messages about love, relationships, and how people communicate in general.The story focuses on two people (Ben and Sadie) who are engaged to marry. Sadie is sort of the dominant figure in the relationship and makes the plans, etc, etc. Ben is the laid back, sort of shy, and goes with whatever Sadie says (whether he disagrees or not.) They are both very young and ignorant of the troubles they will face in later marriage life. When they go to Reverend Frank to get their wedding license, he sees this immaturity and their underlying problems, and sets out to help in his own freaky way.Throughout the movie, Rev. Frank puts Ben and Sadie through a series of tests to see how well they communicate and what roles they play in the relationship. Before when Ben and Sadie never fought, the frequency of their arguments begin to increase. Ben has problems with Sadie turning to other men for feedback on wedding plans, and such, and feels like his word means nothing to her. At the same time, Sadie feels as if Ben is too  immature since the only wedding vows he's written so far is a truck driving though a hoop of fire.At a certain point in the movie, these problems surface and Sadie breaks the engagement off. Later they get back together once they figure out how to make it work, they get married, the end.My favorite scene in the whole movie is after Sadie breaks it off with Ben and Ben is sitting with his best friend in a bar. Ben's friend is in a failing marriage, has kids he chooses to ignore, and throughout the entire movie tries to give Ben advice that makes the situation a whole lot worse than necessary. So, anyway, they're in the bar and Ben's friend tries to console him by telling him ""there are many other fish in the sea"" and ""the woman is the bear and you need to get out there and get as many bears as you can before hunting season is over,"" or something to that nature. Instead of following this advice and going off the deep end,like I expected, Ben actually tells his friend off and that he won't take advice from a guy who can't even keep his marriage life under control.Ben further states that he loves Sadie and respects her as a woman, not a fish or a bear, and he only wants her because he's in love with her. I rejoiced after I heard this speech because, for once, a good, clean, well brought up guy who may not be Adonis and wasn't particularly sexy--actually got the girl. The whole movie to me proved that good guys can finish first.I don't know about anyone else who's seen this movie, but I'm buying this one as soon as it becomes available.",5,Good guys finish first,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,3168,"['Contains', 'SpoilersI', ""'m"", 'huge', 'movie', 'buff', 'love', 'sorts', 'movies', 'when', 'went', 'go', 'see', 'License', 'Wed', 'friends', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'willing', 'participant', ""'d"", 'heard', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'convinced', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'shows', 'can', 'never', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'opinions', 'dictate', 'own.License', 'Wed', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'type', 'win', 'Oscar', 'be', 'noteworthy', 'critics', 'was', 'made', 'general', 'audience', 'when', 'see', 'corny', 'yet', 'laughable', 'jokes', 'fact', 'chick', 'flick', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'messages', 'love', 'relationships', 'how', 'people', 'communicate', 'general.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'two', 'people', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'who', 'are', 'engaged', 'marry', 'Sadie', 'sort', 'dominant', 'figure', 'relationship', 'plans', 'etc', 'etc', 'Ben', 'laid', 'back', 'sort', 'shy', 'Sadie', 'not', 'are', 'very', 'young', 'ignorant', 'troubles', 'will', 'face', 'later', 'marriage', 'life', 'When', 'go', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'get', 'wedding', 'license', 'immaturity', 'underlying', 'problems', 'out', 'help', 'own', 'freaky', 'movie', 'Rev', 'Frank', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'series', 'tests', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'communicate', 'what', 'play', 'relationship', 'when', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'never', 'fought', 'frequency', 'arguments', 'begin', 'increase', 'Ben', 'problems', 'Sadie', 'turning', 'other', 'men', 'feedback', 'wedding', 'plans', 'such', 'feels', 'word', 'nothing', 'same', 'time', 'Sadie', 'Ben', 'too', 'immature', 'only', 'wedding', 'written', 'so', 'far', 'truck', 'driving', 'hoop', 'fire.At', 'certain', 'point', 'movie', 'problems', 'surface', 'Sadie', 'engagement', 'off', 'Later', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'work', 'get', 'married', 'end.My', 'favorite', 'scene', 'whole', 'movie', 'Sadie', 'breaks', 'off', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'sitting', 'best', 'friend', 'bar', 'Ben', 'friend', 'failing', 'marriage', 'kids', 'ignore', 'entire', 'movie', 'tries', 'give', 'Ben', 'advice', 'situation', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'necessary', 'So', 'anyway', ""'re"", 'bar', 'Ben', 'friend', 'console', 'telling', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'fish', 'sea', 'woman', 'bear', 'need', 'get', 'there', 'get', 'many', 'bears', 'can', 'hunting', 'season', 'over', 'something', 'nature', 'Instead', 'following', 'advice', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'expected', 'Ben', 'actually', 'friend', 'off', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'advice', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'marriage', 'life', 'control.Ben', 'further', 'states', 'Sadie', 'woman', 'not', 'fish', 'bear', 'only', 'love', 'rejoiced', 'heard', 'speech', 'once', 'good', 'clean', 'well', 'brought', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Adonis', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'sexy', 'actually', 'got', 'girl', 'whole', 'movie', 'proved', 'good', 'guys', 'can', 'finish', 'first.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'seen', 'movie', ""'m"", 'buying', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'available']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)

For those of you that are currently planning a wedding, you are most likely having to endure one or all of those experiences currently, if you haven't yet, just wait. In the end, all of the work is worth it when you see the smiling face of your spouse by your side as you stand in front of the minister and your friends and family on what should end up being one of the happiest days of your life. But what if throughout the entire wedding planning process you had to deal with an intrusive, obnoxious, borderline insane minister who will put you through a battery of tests to determine whether you and your significant other are destined to be together. Well, most likely you didn't have to deal with this particular obstacle to your upcoming marital bliss, but in the Mandy Moore romantic comedy ""License To Wed"", both she and her fianc&eacute;e weren't so lucky.""License To Wed"" is the story of a young couple, Sadie (Mandy Moore) and Ben (John Krasinski), who are wishing to be married in the church that Sadie grew up in. However, before they are allowed to tie the knot they must pass an extreme battery of tests at the hands of Reverend Frank (Robin Williams). Now what they thought would be an average wedding preparation course turns out to be a gauntlet of classes from better communication, to childbirth, and fighting fairly, all of which will test Sadie and Ben's patience and relationship to the breaking point. But, if they are able to survive Reverend Frank and his course, then they can survive anything life will throw at them.When ""License To Wed"" came to theaters it would be fair to say that most critics hated the film, most felt that it was another run-of-the-mill wedding themed comedy, except with Robin Williams added to spice things up and attempt to elevate the movie from dull to mediocre. Despite the critics blasting of the film, my wife and I still thought the movie looked good, and oftentimes we disagree with the critics anyways on these types of films, so we figured it was probably better than they said it would be. So, we rented the movie shortly after it was released on DVD, and laughed (sometimes hysterically) from start to finish, and when it was over I for one felt either we watched a completely different movie than the critics or else they need to have their sense of humor checked.I will give the critics this; they were right in the fact that the story is fairly basic. At least, the main plot line for the movie is, but once Robin Williams shows up, the torturous tests he subjects this couple to is anything but run-of-the-mill for this type of movie, but the result is still what you expect in the end from a light-hearted romantic comedy, but at least a portion of the journey is original. Plus, as my wife pointed out, when you watch a romantic comedy you have certain expectations about the movie and its outcome and you really don't want those expectations to be let down. And she's right, if certain elements of a romantic comedy weren't included then it just wouldn't be right, such as, a couple who thinks they know all there is about each other, the relationship is put to the test, they fight and forgive and fight again, they break-up, and then in the end one or both see the light and all is made right in the world. So, as predictable as these movies all are, it's that very predictability that makes them so appealing to audiences, and it's what we want to see when we watch a romantic comedy.Each of the actors and actresses were all very good in their individual roles, most are veterans to romantic comedy, or at least comedy, so knowing what it takes to make the audience laugh came easy to this group. Mandy Moore continues to improve her comedic timing with every new movie she makes, not bad for a former teen pop star. Lesser-known actor, John Krasinski was an ideal match up for Mandy's character Sadie. Both actors shared an obvious chemistry that felt genuine and their interaction was perfectly natural and full of laughs. And of course, Robin Williams was doing what he does best, being hilarious and stealing every single scene that he was in. Unlike some comedies that feature scene-stealing stars, ""License To Wed"" didn't seem to hit any lulls in the laughs department, when Williams' character Reverend Frank wasn't on the screen.""License To Wed"" as I said earlier, is a hilarious romantic comedy, and one of the better ones that I've seen. Full of crazy, over-the-top obstacles for the couple to overcome on their way to matrimony, but also packed full of all the classic elements that makes a romantic comedy so appealing to moviegoers.""License To Wed"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexuality.",4,"If They Can Survive Him, They Can Survive Anything...",1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,5037,"['Think', 'back', 'time',

Mandy Moore did an excellent portrayl of a semi-controlling bride to be. In fact, I had never seen Ms Moore in a film and have really warmed up to the idea since watching the movie. Another surprise was John Krasinski, the adorable boy next door. He almost seems like a younger version of Ben Stiller's Gaylord Focker in Meet The Parents. At times it is both hilarious, and difficult to was Krasinski's character Ben go through the tests that Father Frank has in store.

The problem is St. Augustine's only has one wedding slot available in the next two years, and Reverend Frank (Robin Williams) won't bless their union until they pass his patented, foolproof marriage-prep course. That includes no sex, care of robot babies, and plenty more hijinks.""License to Wed"" is a curious little oddity. Before veering into cliched rom-com territory, director Ken Kwapis (who helmed a few episodes of ""The Office"") manages to pull some funny, if not gutbusting, tricks out of his hat. While some scenes could've been eliminated, most of the time I had a ball. I wouldn't call this the funniest comedy of the year (""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Knocked Up"" both hold the torch), but the charisma of its leads make the film moderately watchable.Kwapis hits the jackpot on a couple of scenes, though with the film being a little crooked at times, he sometimes gets off lucky. There's quite a number of co-stars from ""The Office"" to point out, and the one who gets the most laughs comes from Brian Baumgartner (aka Kevin Malone). He's not in his A game, but he manages to make some scenes moderately entertaining, whether it's fighting with Rachael Harris (who deserves alot more screen time than she has) or shaking his funky side with Krasinski.Of course, there are times where the film drops the ball big time. The robot babies might have looked cute on paper, but when the script calls for them to squirt blue goo (don't ask), have a crying meltdown, or lose their head in an accident (for a movie as charming and madcap as it is, this comes off rather disturbing than funny), maybe screenwriters Kim Barker and Vincent Di Meglio (as well as two others) should've pressed for something other than that. There are also some other scenes that I forget that should've been deleted, since they made no sense. And all Kwapis has Josh Fitter (who I heard did a better job in ""Nancy Drew"") do is rehash cliched smarty-pants kid stereotypes that, thankfully, don't hog the screen.Then there's the last act. Kwapis did a moderately decent job, even if he has some questionable material, but then he moves into conventional rom-com territory where Ben and Sadie have to break up. That wouldn't have mattered, however, if the script didn't call for Robin Williams to enter dramatic mode and have his character recall what happened to his wife that sets a dark cloud over a project that's nothing but slapstick hijinks.As I said, the charisma and sweetness of the performers (especially Mandy Moore, who at least makes an effort to act, unlike her pop-star-turned-actress competition that includes Jessica Simpson) make the stuff at least work. John Krasinski is the weakest link, even if he does get a couple of laughs. The problem is that, in this film, whatever comic timing he has is squashed with odd facial gestures (especially involving the robot twins) or attempts to outfunny Robin Williams (who easily gets the upper hand).

Zwick,"[11, 20]","*1/2""License to Wed"" might as well have been called ""Meet the Minister,"" since all the film does is to recycle the nightmare-before-marriage scenario from ""Meet the Parents"" - albeit with one crucial deviation.  Needless to say, lightning rarely strikes twice when it comes to Hollywood happenings and ""License to Wed"" is no ""Meet the Parents.""  Not by a long shot.Ben Murphy and Sadie Jones are a young Chicago couple who agree to undergo an intense pre-marital ""training course"" conducted by an obnoxious local reverend in exchange for being allowed to hold their nuptials at the church Sadie's dearly departed grandfather helped to build.  To pass the course, the couple must agree to be abstinent until the wedding night, take care of two fully operational and anatomically correct mechanical infants, and undergo various forms of trauma that even Sigmund Freud himself would have trouble undoing after years of reparative analysis.As a ""Meet the Parents"" wannabe, ""License to Wed"" stumbles right out of the starting gate in that one can imagine suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous humiliation and abuse in order to win the favor of a prospective spouse's PARENTS, but to go through all that just to placate her MINISTER?  I don't think so.  In no time flat, the laughter turns to frustration as we find ourselves wondering why Ben doesn't just tell the dear old Reverend to go take a hike - or worse - and then seek out some religious establishment with less stringent requirements for walking down the aisle.And let's face it, there's something more than a trifle off-putting and creepy about an unwed man-of-the-cloth running around with a young boy as his personal prot&eacute;g&eacute; and sidekick, planting listening devices in young couple's bedrooms.  Even for an alleged comic fantasy such as this one, that may be just a bridge farther than most people will be willing to go in the queasiness department.John Krasinski and Mandy Moore make an appealing enough couple, and it isn't really their fault that they've been handed a screenplay - written by no fewer than three writers, a sure sign of trouble - filled with cornball humor, heavy-handed slapstick and unappetizing secondary characters.  In the role of Reverend Frank, Robin Williams, all cutesy mannerisms and third-rate mugging, hits a new low in teeth-grinding unctuousness, although one likes to believe that, if director Ken Kwapis could have gotten the actor to dial back his performance even a little, this might have been at least a tolerable movie.

In a perfect world, Sadie would be painted as the unreasonable, unworthy character, not Ben.The writers know no mercy - even the ending is completely atrocious - it feels like an SNL parody of a romantic comedy conclusion.

Usually when one is on I start to well up tears associated with yawning and forcing my eyes to stay open. So when License to Wed came on the screen I started off anticipating that what would likely come next on the screen would aid in my quest to gain a few extra moments of shuteye in my often times busy day. And boy was I right.Directed by Ken Kwapis, License to Wed perhaps had a decent chance to stand apart from so many other wedding movies out there thanks largely in part to the fact that two rather comedic actors, Robin Williams and John Krasinski, were part of the starring cast. Join that to the fact that a decent actress in the lovely Mandy Moore also starred in the film and at least on the surface there was a glimmer of hope.However, what the movie offered was a rather insignificant film that was full of more fluff and filler than comedy and a borderline sappy theme running throughout.Written by Kim Barker and Tim Rasmussen, License to Wed tells the story of two lovers, Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy (John Krasinski) falling in love and deciding that the time had come for them to take their relationship to the next level: marriage. Though already living with one another, they soon come to realize that there is a lot that each of them need to learn about the other and that marriage is indeed something that needs to be worked at.Though Ben had plans for a quite simple wedding on the beaches of a tropical locale, Sadie instead wants to be married in her family's church and was the ceremony officiated by the family pastor, Reverend Frank (Robin Williams). Reverend Frank is not your everyday, old school man of the cloth and instead takes a much more modern approach to his proselytizing. He is part man of God and part Chinese restaurant open mike comedian of the week.Reverend Frank tests the relationship of Ben and Sadie both in open ways and much more discreet and clandestine ways, as well. Though many of us have all gone through one form of a pre-wedding class, Reverend Frank employs an almost CIA approach to ensure that that Sadie and Ben are a good match for one another as they wish to become married.However, Ben, needless to say, is quite put off by all of the antics of Reverend Frank and becomes more frustrated about the prospect of becoming married to the woman of his dreams than he looks forward to it. In turn, Sadie determines that this frustration then is a reflection upon a misconception that Ben does not feel committed to Sadie. This is where the movie becomes really cliche and it almost becomes hard to keep your popcorn down thanks to the gagging likely to take place.It should come as no surprise that License to Wed was a 2007 Nominee for Teen Choice Aware in the Chick Flick category, probably thanks largely due to the fact that Mandy Moore was in any way associated with this movie. It is likely that the only people that might actually like this film would be teenage girls.Though there are at times decent comedic lines in the film, those times are few and far between. The movie, although it might have been portrayed as being a comedy, was in fact far from it. When there is a good line in the film it is usually buried under a lot of bad writing and a poor storyline.The acting in the film was nothing spectacular, especially given the prospect of Robin Williams serving the role of a Reverend quite well. However, it seems as though the comedy that Williams is capable of was weakened again by the writing that simply did not allow him to be his true comedic self.License to Wed really serves no great purpose to movie watchers because it misses placing itself into so many categories. If someone wants to watch a good romance film following a couple into marriage, this is not the film for you. If someone wants to watch a comedy, this is not the film for you. Therefore, what is left is a rather trite attempt at a comedy film wrapped into the events of a wedding.Though certainly most states do not allow for a marriage to take place without a license to wed, unfortunately most states have no restrictions upon someone watching this movie. Therefore, consider this a public service announcement: please stay away from License to Wed.",1,License to Wed Should Be Revoked,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,4284,"['something', 'wedding', 'movies', 'always', 'cry', 'Usually', 'when', 'one', 'start', 'well', 'up', 'tears', 'associated', 'yawning', 'forcing', 'eyes', 'stay', 'open', 'So', 'when', 'License', 'Wed', 'came', 'screen', 'started', 'off', 'anticipating', 'what', 'would', 'likely', 'come', 'next', 'screen', 'would', 'aid', 'quest', 'gain', 'few', 'extra', 'moments', 'shuteye', 'often', 'times', 'busy', 'day', 'boy', 'was', 'right.Directed', 'Ken', 'Kwapis', 'License', 'Wed', 'perhaps', 'had', 'decent', 'chance', 'stand', 'apart', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'wedding', 'movies', 'there', 'thanks', 'largely', 'part', 'fact', 'two', 'rather', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'were', 'part', 'starring', 'cast', 'Join', 'fact', 'decent', 'actress', 'lovely', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'also', 'starred', 'film', 'least', 'surface', 'was', 'glimmer', 'hope.However', 'what', 'movie', 'offered', 'was', 'rather', 'insignificant', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'more', 'fluff', 'filler', 'comedy', 'borderline', 'sappy', 'theme', 'running', 'throughout.Written', 'Kim', 'Barker', 'Tim', 'Rasmussen', 'License', 'Wed', 'story', 'two', 'lovers', 'Sadie', 'Jones', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Ben', 'Murphy', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'falling', 'love', 'deciding', 'time', 'had', 'come', 'take', 'relationship', 'next', 'level', 'marriage', 'already', 'living', 'one', 'soon', 'come', 'realize', 'lot', 'need', 'learn', 'other', 'marriage', 'indeed', 'something', 'be', 'worked', 'Ben', 'had', 'plans', 'quite', 'simple', 'wedding', 'beaches', 'tropical', 'locale', 'Sadie', 'instead', 'be', 'married', 'family', 'church', 'was', 'ceremony', 'officiated', 'family', 'pastor', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'not', 'everyday', 'old', 'school', 'man', 'cloth', 'instead', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'approach', 'proselytizing', 'part', 'man', 'God', 'part', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'open', 'mike', 'comedian', 'week.Reverend', 'Frank', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'open', 'ways', 'much', 'more', 'discreet', 'clandestine', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'have', 'gone', 'one', 'form', 'pre-wedding', 'class', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'almost', 'CIA', 'approach', 'ensure', 'Sadie', 'Ben', 'are', 'good', 'match', 'one', 'wish', 'become', 'married.However', 'Ben', 'needless', 'say', 'quite', 'put', 'off', 'antics', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'more', 'frustrated', 'prospect', 'becoming', 'married', 'woman', 'dreams', 'forward', 'turn', 'Sadie', 'frustration', 'then', 'reflection', 'misconception', 'Ben', 'not', 'feel', 'committed', 'Sadie', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'cliche', 'almost', 'hard', 'keep', 'popcorn', 'down', 'thanks', 'gagging', 'likely', 'take', 'place.It', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'License', 'Wed', 'was', '2007', 'Nominee', 'Teen', 'Choice', 'Aware', 'Chick', 'Flick', 'category', 'probably', 'thanks', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'was', 'way', 'associated', 'movie', 'likely', 'only', 'people', 'might', 'actually', 'like', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'teenage', 'girls.Though', 'are', 'times', 'decent', 'comedic', 'lines', 'film', 'times', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'being', 'comedy', 'was', 'fact', 'far', 'When', 'good', 'line', 'film', 'usually', 'buried', 'lot', 'bad', 'writing', 'poor', 'storyline.The', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'especially', 'given', 'prospect', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'serving', 'role', 'Reverend', 'quite', 'well', 'However', 'comedy', 'Williams', 'capable', 'was', 'weakened', 'again', 'writing', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'true', 'comedic', 'self.License', 'Wed', 'really', 'great', 'purpose', 'movie', 'watchers', 'placing', 'so', 'many', 'categories', 'someone', 'watch', 'good', 'romance', 'film', 'following', 'couple', 'marriage', 'not', 'film', 'someone', 'watch', 'comedy', 'not', 'film', 'Therefore', 'what', 'left', 'rather', 'trite', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'film', 'wrapped', 'events', 'wedding.Though', 'certainly', 'most', 'states', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'marriage', 'take', 'place', 'license', 'wed', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'states', 'have', 'restrictions', 'someone', 'watching', 'movie', 'Therefore', 'consider', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'please', 'stay', 'away', 'License', 'Wed']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)
655265,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPQE,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 3]","Mandy Moore hears wedding bells yet again, and just like her previous, teen-oriented romantic comedies, License to Wed will send you running from the altar. However, unlike her last disastrous headliner Because I Said So, there is one redeeming quality that will make this film moderately enjoyably for audiences and that is the presence of the wonderful Robin Williams.Sadie (Moore) and Ben (John Krasinski) are ready to tie the knot, but the bride-to-be has just one condition - she wants to be married in the same church she attended growing up. Having wanted to be married in a tropical destination, Ben begrudgingly agrees. With little to no availability, the popular, yet highly unorthodox Reverend Frank agrees to squeeze the couple in, but on one condition, they complete his three month marriage preparation course in a hurried three weeks.The course, which is designed to bring out future marital problems in order to test how the couple will deal with the stress before committing their lives to each other, quickly starts to drive Ben up the wall. Reverend Frank and his partner in crime, a rather stumpy youth partaking in a ministers of tomorrow program, seem to be everywhere, giving the couple little to no intimate privacy. Feeling like he is losing touch with his fianc&eacute;, Ben follows the advice of his friend, and rather than concentrating on passing the course, he tries to find a crack in Reverend Frank's armor hoping that it will get him and Sadie out of the course and back on track with their lives.With License to Wed, plausibility completely goes out the window. Rather than saving Reverend Frank's more unorthodox methods for later in the film, the screenplay throws Ben and Sadie into outrageous scenarios right away. A good comedy should simmer to a boil, saving the best and most outrageous jokes for last, but director Ken Kwapis seems to feel that Robin Williams' presence alone should justify throwing this natural form of comedic storytelling out the window, causing the film to only work in slight spurts.For such a poorly constructed screenplay it is a credit to the actors' talents that they can make the film as humorous as it is. While most of the jokes will have you rolling your eyes, there are a few moments when Robin Williams and The Office star John Krasinski will make you genuinely chuckle. Searching for skeletons in Reverend Frank's closet, Ben breaks into the pastor's home while Williams' character is showering. As Ben tiptoes across the living room, audiences gasped in horror as they heard Williams' booming voice shout ""STOP"". When the comedian finished the sentence in a sing-songy voice with ""in the name of love"" it was met with a cathartic belly laugh.Aside from the fact that there are too few of these hearty jokes in the film, Kwapis' complete lack of style makes the film feel rather vanilla. The fact that the director has had a long career in television is not all that shocking. He approached License to Wed like a standard issue traffic cop, making sure the camera and actors are where they should be and little else. License to Wed couldn't have had a blander style, and I am sure it won't come as a surprise to any of you that the film opens with ""Here Comes the Bride"". Yeah, the film is that generic.Being a chick flick, License to Wed falls into the predictable genre formula, but that is the least of the picture's problems. Dodgy laughs sprinkled few and far between just shouldn't go hand in hand with a Robin Williams comedy; the man is just naturally too funny for that, which should be a tell tale sign that something is most certainly not right with this film. Its family friendly nature should make License to Wed at least passable for most general audiences, but more than likely it will leave fans looking for a fun escapist comedy disappointed.-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.net",2,License to Wed Movie Review from MoviePulse.net,1183334400,"07 2, 2007",2007,3860,"['Mandy', 'Moore', 'wedding', 'bells', 'yet', 'again', 'just', 'previous', 'teen-oriented', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'License', 'Wed', 'will', 'send', 'running', 'altar', 'However', 'last', 'disastrous', 'headliner', 'Said', 'So', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'moderately', 'enjoyably', 'audiences', 'presence', 'wonderful', 'Robin', 'Williams.Sadie', 'Moore', 'Ben', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'are', 'ready', 'tie', 'knot', 'bride-to-be', 'just', 'one', 'condition', 'be', 'married', 'same', 'church', 'attended', 'growing', 'up', 'Having', 'wanted', 'be', 'married', 'tropical', 'destination', 'Ben', 'begrudgingly', 'little', 'availability', 'popular', 'yet', 'highly', 'unorthodox', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'squeeze', 'couple', 'one', 'condition', 'complete', 'three', 'month', 'marriage', 'preparation', 'course', 'hurried', 'three', 'weeks.The', 'course', 'designed', 'bring', 'out', 'future', 'marital', 'problems', 'order', 'test', 'how', 'couple', 'will', 'deal', 'stress', 'committing', 'lives', 'other', 'quickly', 'drive', 'Ben', 'up', 'wall', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'partner', 'crime', 'rather', 'stumpy', 'youth', 'partaking', 'ministers', 'tomorrow', 'program', 'seem', 'be', 'everywhere', 'giving', 'couple', 'little', 'intimate', 'privacy', 'Feeling', 'losing', 'touch', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ben', 'advice', 'friend', 'rather', 'concentrating', 'passing', 'course', 'find', 'crack', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'armor', 'hoping', 'will', 'get', 'Sadie', 'course', 'back', 'track', 'lives.With', 'License', 'Wed', 'plausibility', 'completely', 'out', 'window', 'Rather', 'saving', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'more', 'unorthodox', 'methods', 'later', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Ben', 'Sadie', 'outrageous', 'scenarios', 'right', 'away', 'good', 'comedy', 'should', 'simmer', 'boil', 'saving', 'best', 'most', 'outrageous', 'jokes', 'last', 'director', 'Ken', 'Kwapis', 'feel', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'presence', 'alone', 'should', 'justify', 'throwing', 'natural', 'form', 'comedic', 'storytelling', 'out', 'window', 'causing', 'film', 'only', 'work', 'slight', 'spurts.For', 'such', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'screenplay', 'credit', 'actors', 'talents', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'as', 'humorous', 'most', 'jokes', 'will', 'have', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'when', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Office', 'star', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'will', 'make', 'genuinely', 'chuckle', 'Searching', 'skeletons', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'closet', 'Ben', 'pastor', 'home', 'Williams', 'character', 'showering', 'Ben', 'living', 'room', 'audiences', 'gasped', 'horror', 'heard', 'Williams', 'booming', 'voice', 'shout', 'STOP', 'When', 'comedian', 'finished', 'sentence', 'sing-songy', 'voice', 'name', 'love', 'was', 'met', 'cathartic', 'belly', 'laugh.Aside', 'fact', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'hearty', 'jokes', 'film', 'Kwapis', 'complete', 'lack', 'style', 'film', 'feel', 'rather', 'vanilla', 'fact', 'director', 'had', 'long', 'career', 'television', 'not', 'shocking', 'approached', 'License', 'Wed', 'standard', 'issue', 'traffic', 'cop', 'making', 'sure', 'camera', 'actors', 'are', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'else', 'License', 'Wed', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'blander', 'style', 'am', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'surprise', 'film', 'Here', 'Bride', 'Yeah', 'film', 'generic.Being', 'chick', 'flick', 'License', 'Wed', 'predictable', 'genre', 'formula', 'least', 'picture', 'problems', 'Dodgy', 'sprinkled', 'few', 'far', 'just', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedy', 'man', 'just', 'naturally', 'too', 'funny', 'should', 'be', 'tell', 'tale', 'sign', 'something', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'right', 'film', 'family', 'friendly', 'nature', 'should', 'make', 'License', 'Wed', 'least', 'passable', 'most', 'general', 'audiences', 'more', 'likely', 'will', 'leave', 'fans', 'looking', 'fun', 'escapist', 'comedy', 'disappointed.-Joe', 'Russo', 'MoviePulse.net']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)
655266,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPQE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 9]","Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) and Ben Murphy (John Krasinski, TV's ""The Office"") meet cute at a Starbucks and start dating. A vignette of cute scenes shows the progress of their relationship. Then, at her parents (Peter Strauss and Roxanne Hart) 30th Anniversary party, Ben stands up and proposes to Sadie. She immediately agrees and everyone is ecstatic. Ben tells her he was thinking of a ceremony in the Caribbean, but she has always had a dream to get married in St. Augustine's, the family church, in a ceremony presided over by Reverend Frank (Robin Williams). They meet with Reverend Frank and his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Josh Flitter, an 11 year old who has already appeared in a number of films) who reveals the church has an opening in two years. After a little more research, Frank finds they had a cancellation for three weeks from today. Excited, Ben and Sadie agree and Reverend Frank tells them they must complete his marriage preparation course before he will marry them at St. Augustines. Sadie seems completely unaware of some of the strange `tests' Frank puts Ben through, but Ben pushes through like a good little soldier; he is in love with Sadie and will do whatever it takes. Will Ben and Sadie be able to handle the pressures of an upcoming wedding and the madness Reverend Frank subjects them to?""License to Wed"", directed by Ken Kwapis, who has had a troubled film career and more success in television (he most recently directed some episodes of ""The Office""), starts with an interesting, if unoriginal and overly sitcom idea and doesn't really follow through with it.Robin Williams is slightly low-key as Reverend Frank. The rapid fire, stream of consciousness, pop-culture reference filled monologues he has become famous for are not in evidence in this film. That's a good and a bad thing.As the Reverend, he is interested in preserving the sanctity of marriage, so he puts Sadie and her fianc&eacute;, Ben, through his popular Marriage Training program. Basically, he subjects them to a series of challenges (abuses?), some of which are amusing for about a half second, then quickly become tiring. But the main question that isn't answered is: Why? Why does Reverend Frank subject Sadie, and particularly Ben to these challenges (abuses!) which really don't instruct or teach? In fact, Reverend Frank seems to be jealous of Ben. This is more than a little creepy. Frank is both a reverend and about thirty years older than Sadie, both of which make this idea more than a little nauseating.So, if Frank isn't jealous, what is his excuse? In one scene, he decides to have a little game of catch with Ben and they start tossing a ball around in the auditorium of the school. Then, Frank beans Ben in the face, causing his nose to become bloody. I know, I know. Funny stuff.But Williams does manage to make the role a little amusing, more amusing than it has a right to be. William's makes Frank seem like a little devil in disguise. He sits in a surveillance van with his little prot&eacute;g&eacute; and they spy on the new couple. A couple of times, his reactions to their comments are cute and amusing.But without William's trademark riffs, the role seems too low key for Williams and becomes more of a generic role any comedian could handle. But because the role is low-key, it allows Williams the opportunity to play a more realistic character. Too bad the character isn't more interesting. So Williams seems damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.Mandy Moore's Sadie is pretty but boring. Sadie's basic purpose is to go along with Reverend Frank, so Ben has no choice but to submit to his abuse. Really, the movie is about Frank torturing Ben, so Sadie must remain blissfully unaware throughout the film. Yawn.Moore has never been an exciting actress. She is always simply playing a character, reading the lines as memorized. When you watch a good, or great, actor there are other things going on as they try to bring life to the character.I really like John Krasinski on ""The Office"". He plays Jim, the likable prankster on this popular TV show. In ""License"", he is basically a likable guy, but he merely reacts to Frank's shenanigans throughout. The role is more believable because we believe he is in love with Sadie and will do whatever it takes to keep the relationship going.Josh Flitter plays Frank's little prot&eacute;g&eacute;, a 10 or 11-year-old little boy who follows the Reverend around everywhere. Once again, creepy. Why anyone would let their son hang around anyone all the time, let alone a Reverend. He adds zilch to the story except to give Williams someone to react to when they are sitting alone, in a surveillance van. Creepy. Have I said that already? And he isn't funny.""License"" works very hard to set-up a number of situations, quote unquote funny situations, for Ben and Sadie to deal with. They go to a group class, where the rest of Frank's victims, ...er, students, are already deep into their marriage course. Frank, of course, tries to get Ben and Sadie to fight. But this leads to another character knocking down a table of snacks and yelling ""5 second rule"". If this is the type of quote unquote funny thing you like to watch, then ""License"" has more of it in store for you.I mentioned earlier that Frank subjects his victims to a series of group exercises. Actually, we are the victims, the people who spend money to see this film.At the end of the film, they show a series of bloopers, including Williams, Krasinski and the supporting cast breaking up and making each other laugh. I want to see the movie they were making when these bloopers happened. I really doubt they were working on ""License to Wed"" when they occurred.",2,Personal Message to Robin Williams - You Need a Better Agent!,1184198400,"07 12, 2007",2007,5700,"['Sadie', 'Jones',

655268,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPQE,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","OK, I am a big fan of Robin Williams, (or maybe I should say I was), but what happened to him? Let's face it; he is not just unfunny here; he is terribly annoying in ""License to Wed."" Robin Williams is Reverend Frank, who, for the reasons we don't care, ""coaches"" young couples in love before their marriage to make their bond more secure. For most of the viewers, however, his course is just a concoction of misguided jokes that are meant to be funny with Robin's manic mannerisms. Unfortunately, he only makes them worse, even off-putting.Anyway, one couple Ben Murphy (John Krasinski) and Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) join the course. Well, the truth is, Ben doesn't trust the minister, but his love Sadie is so eager to take part in it, so what can Ben do? Even though Reverend Frank's pre-marriage course includes a strange lesson like Sadie driving a car blindfolded (with Ben by her side) on public roads, Sadie trusts the minister. And Sadie doesn't seem to notice that it is totally against the law.But we are supposed to enjoy the ""goofy"" turns of the cast. We are supposed to smile when Reverend Frank sends a choir boy to the young couple's room to bug their conversations. Maybe we would laugh if the film had a more skillful director, but that doesn't happen here. Also, the minister's course involves taking care of creepy fake babies and being humiliated before the family. Actually his course consists of mostly humiliations and embarrassment, making no point whatsoever except that unfunny jokes are painful to see.But the saddest thing is, as in equally terrible ""Because I Said So,"" Mandy Moore is wasted in this dreadful mess. In fact, the couple of John Krasinski and Mandy Moore themselves are very likable, especially Mandy Moore. However, she is playing a character who should have known better than trusting this minister instead of her love. Her character never takes her sweetheart's words seriously until the very last moment while always listening to the third person obediently.After all the film belongs to Robin Williams whose character is very unpleasant and obnoxious. At least the film's final 15 minutes (and end credits) barely make us feel differently, but that's too late.",1,Comedy That Is So Annoying and Painful to See,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2209,"['OK', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'maybe', 'should', 'say', 'was', 'what', 'happened', 'Let', 'face', 'not', 'just', 'unfunny', 'here', 'terribly', 'annoying', 'License', 'Wed.', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'who', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'coaches', 'young', 'couples', 'love', 'marriage', 'make', 'bond', 'more', 'secure', 'most', 'viewers', 'however', 'course', 'just', 'concoction', 'misguided', 'jokes', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'Robin', 'manic', 'mannerisms', 'Unfortunately', 'only', 'worse', 'even', 'off-putting.Anyway', 'one', 'couple', 'Ben', 'Murphy', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Sadie', 'Jones', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'join', 'course', 'Well', 'truth', 'Ben', ""n't"", 'trust', 'minister', 'love', 'Sadie', 'so', 'eager', 'take', 'part', 'what', 'can', 'Ben', 'do', 'Even', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'pre-marriage', 'course', 'strange', 'lesson', 'Sadie', 'driving', 'car', 'blindfolded', 'Ben', 'side', 'public', 'roads', 'Sadie', 'minister', 'Sadie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'totally', 'law.But', 'are', 'supposed', 'enjoy', 'goofy', 'turns', 'cast', 'are', 'supposed', 'smile', 'when', 'Reverend', 'Frank', 'choir', 'boy', 'young', 'couple', 'room', 'bug', 'conversations', 'Maybe', 'would', 'laugh', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'skillful', 'director', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'Also', 'minister', 'course', 'taking', 'care', 'creepy', 'fake', 'babies', 'being', 'humiliated', 'family', 'Actually', 'course', 'mostly', 'humiliations', 'embarrassment', 'making', 'point', 'whatsoever', 'unfunny', 'jokes', 'are', 'painful', 'see.But', 'saddest', 'thing', 'equally', 'terrible', 'Said', 'So', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'wasted', 'dreadful', 'mess', 'fact', 'couple', 'John', 'Krasinski', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'are', 'very', 'likable', 'especially', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'However', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'trusting', 'minister', 'instead', 'love', 'character', 'never', 'sweetheart', 'words', 'seriously', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'always', 'listening', 'third', 'person', 'film', 'belongs', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'obnoxious', 'least', 'film', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'end', 'credits', 'barely', 'make', 'feel', 'differently', 'too', 'late']",License to Wed (DVD) (WS/FS)
