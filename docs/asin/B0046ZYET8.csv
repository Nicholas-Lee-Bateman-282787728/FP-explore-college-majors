BUT let me warn you Looks can be deceiving.. This was more than a disappointment. I was pissed because I spent $2.39 to rent this mess. I wouldn't spend 25cents on this. Please ma'am or sir don't waste your time or money.  You only see Fantasia and Faith two times maybe. The storyline was all over the place. The kittens weren't kittens they were more like bears. They were dressed poorly and some of the women in  this was too big to be dresses like that. I was embrassed. I will give Nicci Gilbert credit she tried but just because you were an actor in a Tyler Perry play doesn't mean you are a playwright. I am so glad that I didn't invest my money into this project and the marketing team should  be ashamed of themselves..

1387966,A2BXTKDXE61DNF,B0046ZYET8,jj evans,"[0, 0]",TOO horrible for words! Nicci Gilbert needs to get Brownstone back together and just keep singing (something she's great at) if this is the best she can do.  The cover is misleading because your lead to believe Fantasia and Faith Evans are the main characters but they featured no more than 6-7 minutes apiece.,1,jj evans,1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2013,310,"['TOO', 'horrible', 'words', 'Nicci', 'Gilbert', 'get', 'Brownstone', 'back', 'together', 'just', 'keep', 'singing', 'something', 'great', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'cover', 'misleading', 'lead', 'believe', 'Fantasia', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'featured', 'more', '6-7', 'minutes', 'apiece']",Soul Kittens Cabaret
1387967,ABIMJR7WQ0XRF,B0046ZYET8,madbull,"[4, 4]",This play has poor acting.  It features Fantasia Barrino (American Idol winner) and Faith Evans (R&B Singer).  The two top stars only have cameo appearances and sing one song each.  The remainder of the movie centers around the Gay club owner whose acting skills are not that great.  The whole play was overdone as far as the acting was concerned and could have been done in alot better taste.  Basically the whole play just drags on until you finally get to end which is horrible also.,1,Not good,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,486,"['play', 'poor', 'acting', 'Fantasia', 'Barrino', 'American', 'Idol', 'winner', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'R', 'B', 'Singer', 'two', 'top', 'stars', 'only', 'have', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'sing', 'one', 'song', 'remainder', 'movie', 'centers', 'Gay', 'club', 'owner', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'whole', 'play', 'was', 'overdone', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'was', 'concerned', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'alot', 'better', 'taste', 'Basically', 'whole', 'play', 'just', 'drags', 'finally', 'get', 'end', 'horrible', 'also']",Soul Kittens Cabaret
