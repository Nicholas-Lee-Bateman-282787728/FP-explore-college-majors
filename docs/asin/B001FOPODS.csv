1191915,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B001FOPODS,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","Peter and the Wolf is one of those stories that I'd always heard about, but never read. I didn't even see the old Disney short based on it! Somehow, the story always seemed to slip by me, while I'd be reading about Little Red Riding Hood and many of the other classics. Tonight I wanted to watch a movie, and while my queue has barely been touched for the last year, I decided to go with something I recently put on there- this version of Peter and the Wolf. Yeah, it's barely over 30 minutes long, and is more of a short film than anything. Still, I started it up, and my daughter decided to join me. She loves stop motion movies too, and even likes it when I show her the special features for movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox where the puppets and their sets are shown being brought to life. So this was a cool bonus for her.Peter is a young boy who lives in the woods with his grandfather. They're well-protected from the outside, having a massive fence built around their home. Peter has a duck that's basically his only friend, and one day they head to town for some chores. Advertisements for the circus are everywhere, with a ballerina bear shown on the posters. Poor Peter bumps into some local ruffians while there, and they throw him in a dumpster and even act like they're going to shoot him with a rifle after he's been dumped. Back home, a crippled bird lands by Peter and the duck. It wants them to go outside. They eventually do, and that's when it starts. Their home is protected for a reason- there's a wolf prowling around outside, and it has its eyes on these easy targets, which also includes a very fat cat that came out to get the crippled bird. Weaponless, what's Peter to do?Because the movie is so short, and it's based on a well-known (aside from in my case I guess) tale, it's hard to not spoil the story. We'll just say that overall, the movie isn't too dark and yet it definitely doesn't sugarcoat anything, featuring a small amount of blood and one death. My daughter is six years old and she wasn't disturbed by any of the imagery or violent scenes. It was a downer for both of us when a certain death happened, but it isn't lingered on. I was really impressed with the puppets used in this movie, and most of the animation is fantastic. There are only a couple of times when something wasn't animated very well (the cat drying its legs after it fell through the frozen pond stood out). It's nothing major, and it easily forgiven, especially considering this isn't a huge feature length film. Details like Peter's facial expressions say more than words ever could.Speaking of words, no one talks in this movie. This may bother some, so it's worth mentioning for those who don't like this for whatever the reason.After the movie was over and I went to rate it, my daughter saw that I was going to give it 4 stars, but insisted that it should get 5. I was surprised! She was into it, and even quit playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf about 5 minutes in. It's always a pleasure to see new stop motion films, and this was certainly a treat.",4,Send that wolf after some sparkly vampires instead of the birds.,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,3062,"['Peter', 'Wolf', 'one', 'stories', ""'d"", 'always', 'heard', 'never', 'read', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'old', 'Disney', 'short', 'based', 'Somehow', 'story', 'always', 'seemed', 'slip', ""'d"", 'be', 'reading', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'many', 'other', 'classics', 'Tonight', 'wanted', 'watch', 'movie', 'queue', 'barely', 'been', 'touched', 'last', 'year', 'decided', 'go', 'something', 'recently', 'put', 'there-', 'version', 'Peter', 'Wolf', 'Yeah', 'barely', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'more', 'short', 'film', 'anything', 'Still', 'started', 'up', 'daughter', 'decided', 'join', 'stop', 'motion', 'movies', 'too', 'even', 'likes', 'when', 'show', 'special', 'features', 'movies', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'where', 'puppets', 'sets', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'brought', 'life', 'was', 'cool', 'bonus', 'her.Peter', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'woods', 'grandfather', ""'re"", 'well-protected', 'outside', 'having', 'massive', 'fence', 'built', 'home', 'Peter', 'duck', 'basically', 'only', 'friend', 'one', 'day', 'head', 'town', 'chores', 'Advertisements', 'circus', 'are', 'everywhere', 'ballerina', 'bear', 'shown', 'posters', 'Poor', 'Peter', 'bumps', 'local', 'ruffians', 'there', 'throw', 'dumpster', 'even', 'act', ""'re"", 'going', 'shoot', 'rifle', 'been', 'dumped', 'Back', 'home', 'crippled', 'bird', 'lands', 'Peter', 'duck', 'go', 'outside', 'eventually', 'do', 'when', 'home', 'protected', 'reason-', 'wolf', 'prowling', 'outside', 'eyes', 'easy', 'targets', 'also', 'very', 'fat', 'cat', 'came', 'out', 'get', 'crippled', 'bird', 'Weaponless', 'what', 'Peter', 'do', 'movie', 'so', 'short', 'based', 'well-known', 'aside', 'case', 'guess', 'tale', 'hard', 'not', 'spoil', 'story', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'overall', 'movie', ""n't"", 'too', 'dark', 'yet', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'sugarcoat', 'anything', 'featuring', 'small', 'amount', 'blood', 'one', 'death', 'daughter', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'was', ""n't"", 'disturbed', 'imagery', 'violent', 'scenes', 'was', 'downer', 'when', 'certain', 'death', 'happened', ""n't"", 'lingered', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'puppets', 'used', 'movie', 'most', 'animation', 'fantastic', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'animated', 'very', 'well', 'cat', 'drying', 'legs', 'fell', 'frozen', 'pond', 'stood', 'out', 'nothing', 'major', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'especially', 'considering', ""n't"", 'huge', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'Details', 'Peter', 'facial', 'expressions', 'say', 'more', 'words', 'ever', 'could.Speaking', 'words', 'one', 'talks', 'movie', 'may', 'bother', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'reason.After', 'movie', 'was', 'went', 'rate', 'daughter', 'saw', 'was', 'going', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'insisted', 'should', 'get', '5', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'even', 'quit', 'playing', 'Animal', 'Crossing', 'New', 'Leaf', '5', 'minutes', 'always', 'pleasure', 'see', 'new', 'stop', 'motion', 'films', 'was', 'certainly', 'treat']",N/A

Technically brilliant, fluidly animated, and lavishly detailed, it is among the finest examples of stop-motion animation. It's great for adults, but parents may want to screen it first before showing their kids, as there are some potentially scary imagery and realistic violence.For example, right at the beginning, Peter goes to town and gets scared by a stuffed wolf in a shop window. He accidentally bumps into a hunter, who bullies him, and throws him in a dumpster. He then points his rifle at Peter. Later in the story, one of Peter's animal friends gets eaten. Lastly, Peter has the unblinking eyes, icy stare, and dour expressionless face of a plastic doll that younger kids may also find disturbing (see DVD cover). The harsh realities of rural Russian life are depicted here. It's certainly different than theDisneyversion that you may remember.There is no dialogue or narration. Everything is told through images, music, and silence, and I thought perhaps the musical backbone of the original story took a back seat to the animation. In various versions I've seen, each character is represented by a strong and distinct musical instrument. Here, the soundtrack did not seem to give each character a unique voice. The music just seems to be part of the background rather than who the characters are.Overall, still very good and definitely worth watching.",4,A wonderful (and dark) retelling of a Russian classic,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,1485,"['Peter', 'Wolf', 'wonderfully', 'dark', 'retelling', 'classic', 'Sergei', 'Prokofiev', 'children', 'story/musical', 'composition', 'Technically', 'brilliant', 'fluidly', 'animated', 'lavishly', 'detailed', 'finest', 'examples', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'great', 'adults', 'parents', 'may', 'want', 'screen', 'first', 'showing', 'kids', 'are', 'potentially', 'scary', 'imagery', 'realistic', 'violence.For', 'example', 'right', 'beginning', 'Peter', 'town', 'scared', 'stuffed', 'wolf', 'shop', 'window', 'accidentally', 'hunter', 'who', 'dumpster', 'then', 'rifle', 'Peter', 'Later', 'story', 'one', 'Peter', 'animal', 'friends', 'eaten', 'Lastly', 'Peter', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'icy', 'stare', 'dour', 'expressionless', 'face', 'plastic', 'doll', 'younger', 'kids', 'may', 'also', 'find', 'disturbing', 'see', 'DVD', 'cover', 'harsh', 'realities', 'rural', 'Russian', 'life', 'are', 'depicted', 'here', 'certainly', 'different', 'theDisneyversion', 'may', 'remember.There', 'dialogue', 'narration', 'Everything', 'told', 'images', 'music', 'silence', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'musical', 'backbone', 'original', 'story', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'animation', 'various', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'character', 'represented', 'strong', 'distinct', 'musical', 'instrument', 'Here', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'give', 'character', 'unique', 'voice', 'music', 'just', 'be', 'part', 'background', 'rather', 'who', 'characters', 'are.Overall', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1191918,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001FOPODS,C. O. DeRiemer,"[28, 28]","For a young boy, unhappiness can be a natural state. Peter and his aged grandfather live in a scrabbly old farmhouse on the edge of a forbidding Russian forest. The grandfather has built a wooden fence around the dirt yard and forbids Peter to go into the forest, where dangerous things lurk, like wolves. Peter hates this. All Peter has for a friend is a scruffy, long-necked duck. When he goes into town two hunters bully him. Still, Peter is a good kid. He helps a bird with an injured wing fly again with the help of a balloon. He sneaks out and plays on the iced pond, skittering and sliding and joined by the duck. He accepts his grandfather's fat, fat cat as a creature perhaps not to like, but not to hurt. Peter even manages to catch the dangerous, hungry and mangy wolf in his net. Peter stops his grandfather from shooting the wolf. When he and his grandfather take it to town, Peter is a hero. But it's not to last. Those hunters show up to taunt and bully the wolf. Peter stops them with his net. Then, Peter...and at this point you need to see this stop-action animation short film.The director, Suzie Templeton, changes some of Sergei Prokofiev's storyline, as well as ditching all the narrative. There's no dialogue, just the music and silence. She gives a conclusion that is unexpected, brave and touching. This is particularly so when we figure out that there are lessons to be learned, especially since there are bullies in this world, and good friends can die. Cats eat birds, wolves eat ducks, bullies hurt any they want who are weaker than they.This new look at Prokofiev's symphony for children runs less than 30 minutes. Over the years, the narrative, in my opinion, had become a boring old aunt who stays too long when she visits. There doesn't seem to have been a celebrity who hasn't wanted to prove his or her love for the kiddies, score some publicity and make a few bucks by doing the narrative. We're talking everyone from Arthur Godfrey to John Gielgud, Boris Karloff to Paul Hogan, Sean Connery to Mia Farrow, George Raft to William Buckley. That's just starters. Without the narrative, and with Templeton's visual style, we wind up concentrating on the story. That means we wind up concentrating on this kid who starts out unhappy and who winds up teaching us all a thing or two.The extras are worth watching, including the discussion of the development of the film by the director and how the stop-action animation stuff was worked. And, of course, you'll learn which musical instruments go with which characters. This Peter and the Wolf won the 2008 Academy Award for Animated Short Film.

The rest is all upside: each of those adjectives also applies to the visual and story-book aspects of this Suzie Templeton version of Peter and the Wolf - and even if the fates of the duck and the wolf come out a little differently I couldn't bring myself to become Upset about it - but just enjoyed the ""alternate ending"". This movie made me laugh, but adults need to step back and try to view a little movie such as this from a child's perspective. Suzie Templeton has created an entertainment and a narrative that is deep and involving for a child. It stimulates their creativity, and involves them emotionally. It sensitively deals with a reality that is hopefully more brutal than what most of our children are experiencing, and shows a child overcoming adversity. Its only a million times better to have your child watch this than ""Power Rangers"" and occasionally children do need to take a few minutes break from videogames. If you think Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Henson's Mirrormask are great (although made with very different techniques), then you will probably also like Peter and the Wolf.

The story was fresh and alive, and also very close to the original given that this one takes place in the modern day.

1191923,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B001FOPODS,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[93, 96]","""Peter And The Wolf"" (2008)Technically stunning, and thematically dark, this amazing adaptation of Sergei Prokoviev's classic children's piece, features marvelous stop-motion animation from director Suzie Templeton.The film places ""Peter"" squarely back into its Russian origins, but rather than an idealized rural-agrarian past, it places the story in a more modern setting, amid glum, drab, rundown shacks and tattered forests, a grim vision of a Soviet-era or post-Soviet Eastern Europe, complete with gun-toting thugs (the hunters of the original story here seem more like cold-hearted militiamen) and the nearby village appears as a rundown, dismal cinderblock outpost. Amid this crushing gloom, Peter finds wonder and joy, unlocking a secret garden where he and his friends the bird and the duck (both crippled and unable to fly) are able to play and forget the bleakness around them.While this may sound a bit miserable, the film itself is a marvel: the amount of work that went into this film is amazing, with Templeton devoting a full five years of her life to completing the piece. Equally engrossing are the added special features, including a making-of video and interview with Templeton and her cohorts that gives a sense of the sheer scope of their project, and the level of detail that went into this production.

With its detailed models and wonderful animation, this is truly an enchanting version of how the young Peter makes a name for himself by capturing a mean and hungry wolf. Prokofiev's classic score is handled in high style here and is a treat for the ear. There are also delightful characters throughout ranging of the balloon-riding bird to the sly cat.  The wolf is especially forbidding and adds a real sense of menace missing in some versions.  Many folks familiar with this classic will be caught off-guard by the surprise ending, which teaches a rather touching lesson.

It was featured on PBS last year, but even if you recorded that presentation, there is much that this DVD has to offer.First, the main feature is presented with an option to begin with the introduction that shows what instrument and theme are assigned to each character.  The feature itself is an extraordinary accomplishment, presenting a darker view of the tale than we are used to.  No Disney clownishness here.  Instead we have a gaunt, forlorn Peter, up against a pretty frightening wolf.The extras include not only the making of documentary that was included with the PBS special, but also another subtitled Polish documentary.  Most fascinating is a rough print version, with some scenes fully completed, and others in various stages of completion.  This version shows a lot of the work that went into this labor-intensive project.As for the reviewer who objected to the story variances, may I suggest that in future you headline such reviews with a ""spoiler alert.""  In any event, I do not find these changes to the classic tale objectionable, and they are certainly not contradicted by the music.For the reviewer who was hoping for a music lesson, what can I say?
