Without spoiling anything for people who've never seen the show, the ending of season 2 creates a big change for the major characters of the show.  Season 3 picks up a few years after that and while it was interesting to see how the show turned out, I can't say I agree with the outcome.  Borgen is a fantastic show throughout, I just wish the magic of the first two seasons was carried over to season 3.  I give a huge amount of respect to the creators of the show for realizing the show had hit it's peak and not carry it on and on like they do here in the states.",4,"Good, but not better than the previous 2.",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,629,"['Season', '3', 'Borgen', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'first', '2', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'ending', 'season', '2', 'big', 'change', 'major', 'characters', 'show', 'Season', '3', 'up', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'show', 'turned', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'agree', 'outcome', 'Borgen', 'fantastic', 'show', 'just', 'wish', 'magic', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'carried', 'season', '3', 'give', 'huge', 'amount', 'respect', 'creators', 'show', 'realizing', 'show', 'had', 'hit', 'peak', 'not', 'carry', 'do', 'here', 'states']",N/A

1678770,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00GM4OUZE,Jon Wynne,"[1, 1]","BORGEN is back! The third and final season of this brilliant Danish political series is one of the most anticipated DVD releases of 2014 for fans of top quality drama.Season Three is set two and a half years after the end of Series Two. Birgitte Nyborg is no longer prime minister and a number of relationships from the previous two seasons have changed dramatically. Most significantly, star journalist Katrine (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) is still working at the TV station and has had a child with Kasper Juul (Pilou Asbaek), with whom she got together at the end of Season Two, although they are soon separated. Her balancing of motherhood with career is one of the main story lines in Season Three. This develops even further when she quits her job to work with Birgitte as Birgitte re-enters the world of politics.Another switch is less focus on Kasper Juul (who is now a secondary character) and more emphasis on Torben Friiss (Soren Malling), the head of the top TV station known for its exemplary coverage of politics. Torben&#8217;s story arc is fascinating to watch as he is forced to deal with a young, trendy new boss who is more interested in ratings than news. Kasper is seen initially clean-shaven and with longer, tousled brown hair, a stark contrast from his buzz cut and stubble beard which helped give him his haunted-by-personal-demons look in the previous two seriesWith Birgitte out of office, the logical question remains: When/if will she get back in? Her return to politics is at the heart of episode one and is what hooks the viewer back into the series.The next two episodes focus on Birgitte&#8217;s failure to be welcomed back to her former party. The solution? Create a new party. This is where Season Three really takes off. The formation of the party gives us more of an understanding of Birgitte&#8217;s personal integrity. For example, she will not accept desperately needed donations to her party if there is the slightest hint of promises to the donor. The founding of the New Democrat party and Birgitte&#8217;s straightening out of its principles take up episodes two and three with the requisite development of the key relationships, as well.The middle episodes see the New Democrats struggling to win public support as they weigh in on some issues of the day while continuing their commitment to political integrity. Issues like the ethical treatment of animals and issues surrounding sex trade workers are hot button contemporary concerns. BORGEN handles them fairly and in such a skilled way that the viewer is drawn into the wheelings, dealings and compromises that are at the heart of modern-day politics.Then, while the New Democrats seem to be making great progress with public opinion, Birgitte is dealt a stunning blow to her health which she insists on handling on her own. Will her stubbornness topple her house of cards? Or does she find her way out of this set-back as well? It isn&#8217;t easy for BIrgitte to admit to any form of weakness. Pride goeth before the fall?The balance of the episodes remind us that relationships and politicking- is what we love about BORGEN. The politics are intriguing, the relationships keep the intrigue personal.Birgitte&#8217;s illness, dramatically speaking, is a brilliant touch, a reminder that nothing is more humbling than our own bodies when they fail us in some way. Even after she finally allows her family in on her secret&#8211;which her doctor strongly recommends for the sake of her recovery&#8211;there are still challenges to be overcome, adding to the dramatic narrative, especially as election day creeps closer. Tensions mount, involving betrayal, desperation and illicit affairs. The deceptions cause more than one breakdown.A more critical eye might find flaws where I&#8217;ve found none. Truth be told, I&#8217;ve been swept up in this magnificent series since the beginning. It is astonishing that BORGEN simply gets better and better.",5,Batting 1000,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,3944,"['BORGEN', 'back', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'brilliant', 'Danish', 'political', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'DVD', 'releases', '2014', 'fans', 'top', 'quality', 'drama.Season', 'Three', 'set', 'two', 'half', 'years', 'end', 'Series', 'Two', 'Birgitte', 'Nyborg', 'no', 'longer', 'prime', 'minister', 'number', 'relationships', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'changed', 'dramatically', 'Most', 'significantly', 'star', 'journalist', 'Katrine', 'Birgitte', 'Hjort', 'Sorensen', 'still', 'working', 'TV', 'station', 'had', 'child', 'Kasper', 'Juul', 'Pilou', 'Asbaek', 'whom', 'got', 'together', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'are', 'soon', 'separated', 'balancing', 'motherhood', 'career', 'one', 'main', 'story', 'lines', 'Season', 'Three', 'even', 'further', 'when', 'job', 'work', 'Birgitte', 'Birgitte', 're-enters', 'world', 'politics.Another', 'switch', 'less', 'focus', 'Kasper', 'Juul', 'who', 'now', 'secondary', 'character', 'more', 'emphasis', 'Torben', 'Friiss', 'Soren', 'Malling', 'head', 'top', 'TV', 'station', 'known', 'exemplary', 'coverage', 'politics', 'Torben', '8217', 'story', 'arc', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'forced', 'deal', 'young', 'trendy', 'new', 'boss', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'ratings', 'news', 'Kasper', 'seen', 'initially', 'clean-shaven', 'longer', 'tousled', 'brown', 'hair', 'stark', 'contrast', 'buzz', 'cut', 'stubble', 'beard', 'helped', 'give', 'haunted-by-personal-demons', 'look', 'previous', 'two', 'seriesWith', 'Birgitte', 'office', 'logical', 'question', 'When/if', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'return', 'politics', 'heart', 'episode', 'one', 'what', 'viewer', 'back', 'series.The', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'focus', 'Birgitte', '8217', 's', 'failure', 'be', 'welcomed', 'back', 'former', 'party', 'solution', 'Create', 'new', 'party', 'where', 'Season', 'Three', 'really', 'off', 'formation', 'party', 'more', 'understanding', 'Birgitte', '8217', 'personal', 'integrity', 'example', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'desperately', 'needed', 'donations', 'party', 'slightest', 'hint', 'promises', 'donor', 'founding', 'New', 'Democrat', 'party', 'Birgitte', '8217', 's', 'straightening', 'principles', 'take', 'up', 'episodes', 'two', 'three', 'requisite', 'development', 'key', 'relationships', 'well.The', 'middle', 'episodes', 'see', 'New', 'Democrats', 'struggling', 'win', 'public', 'support', 'weigh', 'issues', 'day', 'continuing', 'commitment', 'political', 'integrity', 'Issues', 'ethical', 'treatment', 'animals', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'sex', 'trade', 'workers', 'are', 'hot', 'button', 'contemporary', 'concerns', 'BORGEN', 'fairly', 'such', 'skilled', 'way', 'viewer', 'drawn', 'wheelings', 'dealings', 'compromises', 'are', 'heart', 'modern-day', 'politics.Then', 'New', 'Democrats', 'seem', 'be', 'making', 'great', 'progress', 'public', 'opinion', 'Birgitte', 'dealt', 'stunning', 'blow', 'health', 'handling', 'own', 'Will', 'stubbornness', 'topple', 'house', 'cards', 'find', 'way', 'set-back', 'well', '8217', 'easy', 'BIrgitte', 'admit', 'form', 'weakness', 'Pride', 'goeth', 'fall', 'balance', 'episodes', 'remind', 'relationships', 'politicking-', 'what', 'love', 'BORGEN', 'politics', 'are', 'intriguing', 'relationships', 'keep', 'intrigue', 'personal.Birgitte', '8217', 'illness', 'dramatically', 'speaking', 'brilliant', 'touch', 'reminder', 'nothing', 'more', 'humbling', 'own', 'bodies', 'when', 'fail', 'way', 'Even', 'finally', 'family', 'secret', '8211', 'doctor', 'strongly', 'sake', 'recovery', '8211', 'are', 'still', 'challenges', 'be', 'overcome', 'adding', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'especially', 'election', 'day', 'closer', 'Tensions', 'mount', 'involving', 'betrayal', 'desperation', 'illicit', 'affairs', 'deceptions', 'cause', 'more', 'one', 'breakdown.A', 'more', 'critical', 'eye', 'might', 'find', 'flaws', 'where', '8217', 'found', 'none', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', '8217', 'been', 'swept', 'up', 'magnificent', 'series', 'beginning', 'astonishing', 'BORGEN', 'simply', 'better', 'better']",N/A

1678772,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B00GM4OUZE,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister &#8211; after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.Warning: mild, general spoilers for the 3rd season aheadIn the series' 3rd (and last) season, there was, for me, some compromise of what had seemed the show's own moral core. While I applaud the idea -- so lost in the US -- that effective politics is largely about pragmatism and compromise, in the show's 3rd season it starts to feel like Brigitte has become ALL about pragmatism and compromise to get what she wants , and that the show itself isn't seriously challenging her shift. Without some ideological, moral core I found it harder to care who won out. There is a clever last second reprieve that eases the problem to a certain extent. But I spent a lot of the last season feeling increasingly uncomfortable that the series itself DIDN'T seem to be uncomfortable as it's heroine increasingly seemed a woman whose talents were exploiting the political machinery as an end in itself -- without deeply, critically questioning her character, or making us face the intriguing but uncomfortable possibility that perhaps she isn't the truly good hearted, nobly intended politician we all wished for, and that she had always seemed to be.None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",4,"For me, the most problematic season",1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,3349,"['liked', 'Borgen', 'respected', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'LOVE', 'opposed', 'seemingly', 'everyone', 'universe', 'OK', 'found', 'one', 'Luke-warm', 'review', '20', 'major', 'outlet', 'writers', 'rest', 'were', 'flat', 'raves', 'wife', 'loved', 'friends', 'maybe', 'need', 'see', 'again', '30', 'hours', 'big', 'investment', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'blow', 'chair.It', 'Danish', 'politics', 'almost', 'accidental', 'rise', 'one', 'woman', 'Brigitte', 'Nyborg', 'member', 'one', 'Denmark', '8', 'parties', 'role', 'Prime', 'Minister', '8211', 'less-', 'pragmatic', 'better', 'known', 'male', 'rivals', 'self-destruct', 'team', 'press', 'political', 'rivals', 'try', 'stay', 'balanced', 'always', 'choppy', 'morally', 'confusing', 'world', 'politics.There', 'question', 'show', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'characters', 'cover', 'wide', 'range', 'jobs', 'temperaments', 'levels', 'honesty', 'ethics', 'almost', 'remaining', 'human', 'beings', 'do', 'wish', 'leader', 'far', 'right', 'party', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'such', 'cartoon', 'human', 'problems', 'lead', 'character', 'pressure', 'high', 'office', 'tolls', 'family', 'ethics', 'are', 'believable', 'moving', 'loved', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'be', 'flawed', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'still', 'being', 'treated', 'decent', 'people', 'heart.Yet', 'was', 'something', 'bit', 'too', 'neat', 'bit', 'too', 'old-school', 'show', ""'crisis"", 'week', 'approach', 'where', 'almost', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'wildly', 'complex', 'political', 'issues', 'situations', 'manage', 'get', 'resolved', 'personal', 'issues', 'are', 'allowed', 'work', 'more', 'serialized', 'way', 'evolving', 'slowly', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'how', 'show', 'close', 'book', 'brand', 'new', 'political', 'crisis', 'almost', 'episode', 'show', 'need', 'sudden', 'convenient', 'twists', 'can', 'feel', 'melodramatic', 'times', 'sometimes', 'heroine', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'smarter', 'everyone', 'room', 'buy', 'it.Warning', 'mild', 'general', 'spoilers', '3rd', 'season', 'aheadIn', 'series', '3rd', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'compromise', 'what', 'had', 'seemed', 'show', 'own', 'moral', 'core', 'applaud', 'idea', 'so', 'lost', 'US', 'effective', 'politics', 'largely', 'pragmatism', 'compromise', 'show', '3rd', 'season', 'feel', 'Brigitte', 'become', 'pragmatism', 'compromise', 'get', 'what', 'show', ""n't"", 'seriously', 'challenging', 'shift', 'ideological', 'moral', 'core', 'found', 'harder', 'care', 'who', 'won', 'out', 'clever', 'last', 'second', 'reprieve', 'problem', 'certain', 'extent', 'spent', 'lot', 'last', 'season', 'feeling', 'increasingly', 'uncomfortable', 'series', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'seem', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'heroine', 'increasingly', 'seemed', 'woman', 'talents', 'were', 'exploiting', 'political', 'machinery', 'end', 'deeply', 'critically', 'questioning', 'character', 'making', 'face', 'intriguing', 'uncomfortable', 'possibility', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'truly', 'good', 'hearted', 'nobly', 'intended', 'politician', 'wished', 'had', 'always', 'seemed', 'be.None-the-less', 'LOT', 'good', 'show', 'given', 'near', 'universal', 'enthusiastic', 'embrace', 'fact', 'certainly', 'quite', 'liked', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'forced', 'hang', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'one', 'day', 'give', 'go']",N/A

Episode one was exciting as we were introduced to Birgitte Nybirg as a woman on the move, sort of a roving CEO, making lots of money giving speeches, living in luxurious spaces. Then, we got to episode two, and what was Nyborg going to do. We meet all of the characters again, and are introduced to new ones. Husband number one is gone forever as a husband, but they are good friends. What I found that was with the parents who were separated or divorced,the child care was pretty much split. Good for Denmark!We find out at the beginning that two and a half years have lapsed. The children look older, but not the main characters. Katrine Fonsmark, who plays Hjort Sorenson is a TV news anchor, seems to like it, but with her child now becoming a toddler, she may change horses in mid stream.  Nyborg is drawn back into politics, she just can't stand what is happening to her country. However, no party really wants her, so she starts her own. Here is where we meet the rest of the characters, and the ten episodes are well drawn together with exciting and informative situations. The characters who had dropped out of the series because of divorce or ill-health, are welcomed back. Everything is different and yet it seems the same.Nyborg has a boyfriend from the UK, played by Alastair Mackenzie,  and she speaks English only, when she is with him. That was the most noticeable change of all. Excellent English, by the way, with only a trace of an accent. Each episode as I said introduces a new situation, ill health, new elections, lovers come and gone, but always they revolve around politics!This was a great season, it provided everything I needed for a finish.

1678778,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B00GM4OUZE,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[21, 23]","I watched Seasons 2 and 3 on PBS, left a rave review of Season 2.  Some of what I said about Season 2 applies to Season 3 as well, e.g., BORGEN having the perfect balance of the interpersonal and the political, public and private. I can't think of another show that more deftly illustrates the impact of political discourse on people's lives, and vice-versa, and it does so every week in a way that consistently delivers a POWERFUL punch both intellectually and emotionally. The camerawork is phenomenal, so intimate, pulls you right in.I love the subtitles, obviously done by non-Native English speakers, e.g., ""Hey- those are just the perps that come with the job..."" [percs], ""you need the pressure of the right people"" [support], ""so"" substituted for ""but"", compassionate for sympathetic, etc., just slightly off, charming. As with British shows (such as the Irish crime-drama Single-Handed- Season 1Natural Justice, another favorite, available with Prime), Danish TV doesn't censor obscenities, interesting to hear four letter expletives in Danish. It's often obvious what's being said from the inflection, even through they're blanked out in the subtitles for American TV.Another aspect I find intriguing is the depiction of government on a much smaller scale. One soldier killed in Afghanistan produces a national outcry. In one episode the prime minister's kids were upset with her for not cooking dinner. Birgitte washes her own dishes, tries to unstop the kitchen sink, and cleans the house, but also flies to Africa to broker peace talks.I have family in England, and BORGEN well illustrates the close ties and interdependency of EU nations and people, quite foreign (literally) to our insular way of thinking. Similarly, American politics and the media are so polarized, polarizing, it's refreshing in the extreme to see a story that shows conflicting, and yet well-fleshed out, comprehensible points of view. Everyone's human, fallible, sure, but it's not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys. Not to go off on a tangent, but for example, animal-lovers in America often villainize hunters- yet I've read that hunters have done more to safeguard animal habitats and preserve more species than any other group in America (starting with Charles Audubon, an avid hunter). BORGEN takes the time to paint people and issues in relatively fine brushstrokes.I said of Season 2 that I loved the interplay between the personal and the political. Another reviewer thought it too personal, not political enough.  Season 3 focused much more on the political, less on the personal, and I found that equally satisfying, perhaps even more so.  The politics, the nuts and bolts of forming a new political party, and all the machinations and strategizing relating thereto was absolutely fascinating.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  What personal themes there were were handle with great subtlety, e.g., Birgitte's new romance, her health problems, Katrine's new relationship, Torben's personal and professional challenges...they didn't detract a bit from the political intrigue.I've just seen Episode 1 of Season 1 on PBS (they're starting over), I can hardly wait to see the rest of Season 1 [see FINAL UPDATE at end]. Having seen seasons 2 and 3, the most obvious difference is Birgitte's lack of self-confidence.  Other things I want to mention: 1) unisex bathrooms (with stalls) in Denmark, no-one bats an eye;  2) people smoke, even at work;  3) there isn't such an emphasis on thin, young, gorgeous actresses, women look normal, have meat on their bones, are sans make-up at home (Katrine doesn't even wear makeup to work, only when she's going to be on camera), pad around with cellulite showing, and women of all ages, with normal wrinkles, are shown.  Also, women don't look like they were produced by a cookie cutter with the same hair styles, tight clothing, stiletto heels, no cosmetically enhanced breasts in sight, such a nice change from American productions (ditto for the men, they look real), 4) everyone rides bikes to work, even heads of political parties, and finally 5) the Danish use the terms ""welfare"" and ""welfare programs"", with their original meanings, as we used to, meaning for people's betterment, for the improved, enhanced quality of people's lives, no negative connotations.I find BORGEN captivating, fascinating on many levels.  I love the tension and dynamism between the press and politicians.  A favorite character is the news chief of TV1, Torben Friis, phenomenal, another is marvelous Hanne Holm.  Actually, there's not a character on the show who's not richly drawn, superbly acted, I wish I could mention them all (Hesselboe, Kasper, Pia, Bent, Philip, Svend, Ulrik, Laura, Magnus, Jeremy, everybody).  Most of all, I love Birgitte, and her integrity.  Though hardly perfect, she wrestles with what the ethical course is, and for her ends don't justify the means.  Every week there's a famous quote that embodies the theme of that show.  One of them was from Abraham Lincoln, who said (I paraphrase): Most men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him POWER.  That sensibility informs the entire show.  The writing, the acting, the direction is as good as it gets, for me, just wonderful.  I plan to buy the entire series.UPDATE: Having now watched all three seasons, my admiration has grown exponentially, the circle complete (symbolized by Hanne's crooked scarf before her TV1 broadcast from Borgen in Episode 1, and again, straightening it before going on the air live from Borgen in the final episode).I'm now in even GREATER awe of Season 3, culminating in the final episode- for me, the series's crowning achievement, the piece d'resistance.  It means much, much more after seeing how it all began, the complete journey.  Episode 30 is studded with magic moments.  I won't list them all, but among them are Birgitte's final doctor's visit, Jeremy accompanying her to Borgen, Philip and Jeremy's bittersweet meeting, Katrine finally finding her man, Torben finding his voice (and where his heart lies), the suspense surrounding the formation of the new government, and most of all, how Birgitte, when faced with the toughest decisions of her life, shows her mettle by putting her country's interests ahead of her own.  Simply SPLENDID, inspiring, the arc of her growth, as well as that of the series, now complete.
