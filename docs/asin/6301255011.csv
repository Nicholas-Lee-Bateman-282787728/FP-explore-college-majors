Deeper than the romance is a search for meaning. This two-level movie is funny with an undercurrent of a genuine plot stronger than the usual romantic comedy.Part of the ego-driven, superficial but pretentious New York literary scene, Isabelle Grossman brings together writers and other literati for soirees feting the personalities behind the books.Isabelle, or Izzy, herself is not a writer, but feels she is important because of the names and numbers in her Rolodex. She works hard and late, only to go home to an empty apartment. Her only love is accommodating the occasional lonely nights of a friend who fights with his wife. She tolerates his affections in what amounts to be no more than a recurring one-night stand.Although Izzy's emptiness surrounds her, she never notices it, not even when her grandmother has a matchmaker attempt setting her up with Sam, a neighbor bachelor. Unfortunately for Sam, her intentions are set on Anton, a dashing, but caddish author whose books are bestsellers. He only wants her to appease his desires, and has no love for her, but she is blind to his true intentions. She curtly rejects another date with Sam.With a single romantic signal, Pickleman Sam, the man she pushed away in a matchmaking dinner now effectively woos her heart into confusion. He had noticed her years ago and now happily accepted the chance to be introduced by the matchmaker. When he tells her this, a spark is lit. He isn't the suave author she begs for, and his lifestyle is more simple than those whose books are reviewed in the New York Times. She fumbles opportunity after opportunity to connect with Sam, but he is patient.Anton makes advances that are alluring to Izzy as her heart tries to reconcile her fondness for Sam. This conflict causes Izzy to ask the important questions about integrity, meaning and happiness.With the light, but poignant backdrop of her Jewish family and friends, this romance makes statements both serious and comedic. Outside of the periodic stereotyping of Jewish grandmothers, it works.I fully recommend ""Crossing Delancey.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",4,Searching & Finding Meaning in the Middle of Romance,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,2187,"['Crossing', 'Delancey', 'presumed', 'first', 'romance', 'Deeper', 'romance', 'search', 'meaning', 'two-level', 'movie', 'funny', 'undercurrent', 'genuine', 'plot', 'stronger', 'usual', 'romantic', 'comedy.Part', 'ego-driven', 'superficial', 'pretentious', 'New', 'York', 'literary', 'scene', 'Isabelle', 'Grossman', 'together', 'writers', 'other', 'literati', 'soirees', 'feting', 'personalities', 'books.Isabelle', 'Izzy', 'not', 'writer', 'feels', 'important', 'names', 'numbers', 'Rolodex', 'hard', 'late', 'only', 'go', 'home', 'empty', 'apartment', 'only', 'love', 'accommodating', 'occasional', 'lonely', 'nights', 'friend', 'who', 'wife', 'affections', 'what', 'amounts', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'recurring', 'one-night', 'stand.Although', 'Izzy', 'emptiness', 'never', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'grandmother', 'matchmaker', 'attempt', 'setting', 'up', 'Sam', 'neighbor', 'bachelor', 'Unfortunately', 'Sam', 'intentions', 'are', 'set', 'Anton', 'dashing', 'caddish', 'author', 'books', 'are', 'bestsellers', 'only', 'appease', 'desires', 'love', 'blind', 'true', 'intentions', 'curtly', 'date', 'Sam.With', 'single', 'romantic', 'signal', 'Pickleman', 'Sam', 'man', 'pushed', 'away', 'matchmaking', 'dinner', 'now', 'effectively', 'heart', 'confusion', 'had', 'noticed', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'happily', 'accepted', 'chance', 'be', 'introduced', 'matchmaker', 'When', 'spark', 'lit', ""n't"", 'suave', 'author', 'lifestyle', 'more', 'simple', 'books', 'are', 'reviewed', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'opportunity', 'opportunity', 'connect', 'Sam', 'patient.Anton', 'advances', 'are', 'alluring', 'Izzy', 'heart', 'reconcile', 'fondness', 'Sam', 'conflict', 'Izzy', 'ask', 'important', 'questions', 'integrity', 'meaning', 'happiness.With', 'light', 'poignant', 'backdrop', 'Jewish', 'family', 'friends', 'romance', 'statements', 'serious', 'comedic', 'periodic', 'stereotyping', 'Jewish', 'grandmothers', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Crossing', 'Delancey', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

""Crossing Delancey"" was adapted from the stage play of the same name.  It's quite rare that I have seen a film quite so perfectly cast, directed and produced as this one.  It is quietly compelling, achingly poignant, intelligent and warmly humorous.""Delancey"" looks at the plight of the thirty-something career woman who must balance career, personal life, and family obligations.  Amy Irving, as the main character Isabelle, glows with beauty, longing and wistfulness.  Isabelle works at a small bookstore in New York City that hosts several of the authors that have been especially successful for them. One of these authors is Anton Maes, an arrogant, chauvinistic, Belgian womanizer who writes the kind of trashy novels that make women bristle and men cough.  Of course, this is just the sort of man that appeals to the lonely Isabelle at a time in her life where she has no male companionship and lives in a small, one-bedroom Uptown apartment.  In between work, jogging with her girlfriend and hoping to get closer to the self-centered author, she helps care for her ""Bubbie"" or grandmother (the priceless Reizl Bozyk--for whom the casting directors combed the streets of New York to find as the perfect match for this film).  This traditional Jewish woman wants her thirty-three year old granddaughter to settle down and marry a good Jewish guy.  Isabelle is opposed to this traditional view and fights it.  Bubbie goes against her back and hires a marriage broker who then introduces her to the first candidate, Sam (Peter Riegert), the pickle man from down the street.  She spends the rest of the film torn between her budding attraction to a flashy, flamboyant and charismatic author and the pickle man, who has substance, sensitivity and moves her heart with his profound observations about life.  The rest is history...They truly don't make films like this anymore.  ""Crossing Delancey"" really gives you a sense of the modern day Jewish-American experience as we are allowed a glimpse of the Jewish district of New York City, as well as the vibrant and intriguing cross section of people that Isabelle lives around.

Without going overboard on ethnic stereotypes, it focuses on Isabelle ""Izzy"" Grossman, who works in a Manhattan bookstore which has become a magnet for the literary intelligentsia. In typically formulaic fashion, she is a typical urban single who spends her free time with her girlfriends or at home alone when she is not providing shelter for a married friend who is constantly fighting with his wife.What makes this story unique is Izzy's close relationship with her opinionated grandmother, Bubbie, who lives in the working-class Lower East Side. Bubbie is determined to see Izzy get married and hires a mouthy broker to find an appropriate suitor. Enter Sam Posner, who owns the local pickle store and has to dip his fingers in vanilla to rid himself of the smell. A thoroughly grounded mensch, he initially doesn't excite Izzy, who has become smitten with the intellectual pretension of an egocentric Dutch author, Anton Maes. There's a lot of hemming and hawing before the inevitable conclusion with scenes both inspired and predictable along the way. There are several lightly amusing bits like a restaurant roundelay where Izzy tries to pawn Sam off to an anxious girlfriend. Never the most electrifying of actresses, Amy Irving provides a becalming assurance as Izzy and makes us feel for her as she grapples with her small-scale dilemmas. Irving manages to make Izzy rather sympathetic even when she is manipulating Sam's affections.The incessantly low-key Peter Riegert is likable as Sam, and he leavens his relatively bland presence with his character's plaintively romantic overtures toward Izzy. He has a nice moment when he explains to Izzy why he decided to move forward with the arranged meeting. I just wish the two actors had more opportunities to articulate the characters' inner conflicts and a greater sense of romantic chemistry. In her only screen performance, veteran Yiddish theater performer Reizl Bozyk plays Bubbie with infectious energy even if she is confined within her ethnic stereotype. As Anton, Jeroen Krabb&eacute; adds to his gallery of smug European aristocrats, though at least this time with a jaded sense of humor. Sylvia Miles is her over-the-top self in the gratefully brief role of the matchmaker, while folk singer Suzzy Roache does well as Izzy's cynical girlfriend Marilyn. In fact, the Roaches are the ones who provide the background music here.

She hasher eye on a good-looking, suave writer, but the man who wants to know herbetter is a pickle salesman.

248386,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,6301255011,F. Gentile,"[21, 21]","I hate to use the word ""adorable"", but, I must. This film is just adorable. The story of Izzy, the sophisticated, independent,  N.Y. City career girl (wonderfully played by Amy Irving), and ""Sam , The Pickle Man"", (also wonderfully played by Paul Riegert), is a heartwarming, funny, sweet  love story.  Izzys  ""Bubby""  hires a marriage broker, hysterically played by Sylvia Miles,  to ""match-up"" her granddaughter, ""Miss Fancy"",  who she perceives as living a lonely life..""A dog should live alone !"" Izzy is involved in the literary world, and aspires to an intellectual, sophisticated life, only miles away, but a million miles away from the old -world kosher existance of her beloved Bubby. Reizl Bezyk ,who was a popular star in Yiddish theater,  plays Bubby, and she is really the outstanding character in this movie. Her practical, no-nonsense approach to life & love, with a kind of ""you're born, you eat, you love, you die"" mentality, is in direct opposition to granddaughter Isabelles (Izzy). She speaks in ""Bubby-isms"", and she is hysterical, implying  the world in just a look. Izzy immediatley rejects the arranged match-up with Riegerts ""Sam"", the pickle man, simply because she can't get past the pickles. She sees the pretentious Russian author, to whom she is associated in her job at an old book store, as being more complementary to her. He is a cad who woos her with quotes from Confucious, and he can offer her the prestige and entree into the world of intelligensia that she aspires to be in. The ensuing conflict, between the world she hopes for, and the opportunity that's right in front of her... that she won't see, is very touching and funny. This is just a great little love story about sometimes finding what you're looking for in the most un-likely package, and not letting your pre-conceived expectations get in the way. It is beautifully filmed around wonderful Manhattan locations, and the soundtrack by ""The Roches"" perfectly complements the story as it happens.

Bubba can't understand why Isabelle is content with being single and living in a ""cage"" of an apartment.  She enlists the help of a hilariously over the top matchmaker played by Andy Warhol veteran Sylvia Miles, to find ""Izzy's"" ideal mate.From there, Izzy, as bubba calls her, hesitantly accepts a meeting with Pickle stand owner Sam Posner.  Sam is a charmingly likeable and attractive mensch of a guy, played by the wonderful, and rarely seen Peter Reigert (""Animal House"", ""Oscar"" and Seinfeld's last episode).  Over lunch at Bubbas, Isabelle ALMOST accepts the date, you can tell part of her sees that Sam IS special.  However, she just can't get past her snobbish ideals to see past his ""provincial"" lifestyle and career to appreciate a man who is unpretentious and genuine.After being used enough times by a good for nothing married boyfriend, then fixing up a less attractive friend with Sam, and finding herself extremely jealous, she begins to change her mind.  The final shove to reality comes in the form of a phony womanizing french writer in town who Izzy idealizes, and gets used again.  It is then that she finally opens her eyes and sees that Sam is as her bubbe (grandmother) would say, ""good as gold"".This is one of the greatest love stories ever lensed, although it doesn't carry the same cache that many similar love stories such as ""Moonstruck"" do.  Certainly not because it is undeserving of the status, but that's just Hollywood.  The stars are not the big names, so less recognition here.  This film is superior in my opinion though.  It's got a special magic from the ethnicity, the well drawn characters, and the wonderful lower Manhattan setting where we get many wonderful shots of landmarks like the Williamsburg Bridge.  Bubbe has a great view of it from her project apartments terrace.If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel good, or a romantic film to watch with the one you love, cross over to this side of filmaking.  This is an unusually fresh and clean romantic tale,  devoid of sex to tell it's love story.  It's like a throwback to a more innocent time in filmaking like all the Rock Hudson/Doris Day features, and other comedy/romance films of the past.  This film retains that magic while still being updated and modern without losing the old fashioned charm it offers in abundance.

248399,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6301255011,K. Boullosa,"[3, 4]","This charming film began life as a play whose author also wrote the the screenplay.  Director Joan Micklin Silver's affection for her characters is highly evident in the warmth and humor with which she brings their foibles to life. For those who remember living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in the 1980s, just before it became the land of Dual-Income Yuppies With Twins, the movie may also generate some nostalgia.Just turned thirty-something Isabelle ""Izzy"" Grossman (Amy Irving) lives in a dingy ground-floor apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in one of those lumbering pre-War buildings with vast shadowy lobbies that have seen better days.  She has a job she likes at an intellectually chic midtown bookstore (actually the old Gotham on W. 47th Street) that involves coordinating and presenting readings and book discussions by famous and not so famous authors.  Her parents are retired and living in Florida, so her nearest local relative is her ""Bubbi"" (Grandma in Yiddish), widowed and living on a modest income in an apartment in the Grand Street Coops on the Lower East Side (thanks to bookcat1962 for this clarification!).  Loving granddaughter that she is, Izzy visits her Bubbi regularly, and Bubbi dotes on her pretty granddaughter.However, Bubbi (Reizl Bozyk, once a star of the Yiddish Theater in NYC) is terribly concerned that Izzy has crossed over her landmark 30th birthday without showing any signs of finding a nice Jewish boy to settle down with.  Bubbi looks down her nose at Izzy's entire lifestyle - her job, her apartment, and most of all, Izzy's insistence that she is just fine as she is and doesn't need a man to make her feel complete.  Izzy's group of close girlfriends seem to be having similar problems finding men - most are unmarried and one has opted to have a baby without benefit of clergy.  The viewer is treated to dire scenes of unsmiling single women in business clothes picking up dinner from buffets in the Upper West Side's ubiquitous Korean groceries. The film's view that the life of a single woman in Manhattan is one of unrelieved depression, sadness, and lack of fulfillment, is relentlessly underlined.  (At one point, Bubbi quotes an alleged college professor's dictum that, ""If you're alone, you're sick."") It is made clear that, despite Izzy's protestations to Bubbi about her contentment with her self-sufficient life, underneath it all Izzy longs for romance and commitment.Impatient with Izzy's resistance to ""doing something"" about her unfulfilling life, Bubbi takes drastic action and calls in the community's local matchmaker (Sylvia Miles).  When Izzy finds out, she is horrified, but to please her grandmother, she agrees at least to meet Sam, the first man the matchmaker wants to present.  Played by Peter Riegert, Sam turns out to be a pleasant-faced, well-spoken young man who has inherited and is running his father's small pickle store in the neighborhood.  Sam, as one of the neighborhood's eligible bachelors, has often been the matchmaker's target, but he has resisted her blandishments until the day she turned up and pulled out Izzy's photo.  Turns out that Sam spotted Izzy in the neighborhood some time ago as she came downtown to visit her Bubbi, and for Sam, it was close to love at first sight.So, he's nice looking, college-educated, is perhaps a bit old-fashioned (he is more observant about religious practice than Izzy), but easy on the eyes, nicely dressed, obviously crazy about Izzy and in the market for a serious relationship - it would seem that, between them, Bubbi and the matchmaker have hit pay dirt on the first try, no?No.  Izzy cannot get past the fact that Sam makes and sells pickles for a living on the Lower East Side - hence the meaning of the film's title, ""Crossing Delancey"": Delancey Street, for you non-New Yorkers out there, is the northern border of the Lower East Side, and chic Upper West Sider that she is, with pretensions to Being Somebody on Manhattan's arty literary scene, Izzy cannot quite get herself across that divide.  She turns down Sam's suggestion that they go out to dinner to get to know each other, much to everyone's disappointment.Sam, however, is determined not to let Izzy get away, and sensing that her reluctance has more to do with what he does than who he is, he sets about trying to broaden her outlook.  Sam has his work cut out, as Izzy's see-sawing ambivalence toward him is increased by the distraction of a charismatic but self-involved European author (Jeroen Krabbe) who is part of her bookstore's stable of writers, and who suddenly begins to take an interest in Izzy.Izzy, at last, must come to some decision about who she is, what she really wants, and where she belongs.  Her journey, as she learns to navigate the distance between West 79th Street and Delancey Street is funny, wistful, and sweet, if a tad one-sided in perspective.  Some women may object, with justice, to the film's unsubtle viewpoint that a woman alone is a disaster, life without marriage is not worth living, a husband and children are the only path to fulfillment, etc.  If this perspective offends you, the film's very real charm will be lost on you.  Otherwise, this adorable movie will likely touch your heart.The cast is delightful, although Amy Irving had deep circles under her eyes and looked nearly ill - she seemed to be photograhped through linoleum - I believe she was going through her divorce from Steven Spielberg at the time, but don't quote me on that.  Peter Riegert hits just the right note as Sam, although the character as written is somewhat too good to be true (certainly not Riegert's fault, and perhaps the film's only narrative flaw apart from its naked contempt for unattached women).  Suzzy Roche is very appealing as Izzy's best friend, and Reizl Bozyk hams it up as Bubbi, although her hamming pales beside that of Sylvia Miles as the matchmaker.  Jeroen Krabbe is sleazily attractive as the self-dramatizing poet.The film is accompanied by a pretty score referencing an early 1960s love song recorded by former teen-idol Shelley Fabares (remember her?!), and the scenes of life in 1980s Manhattan are authentic and engaging.  It's a one-of-a-kind film that most people will take immediately to their hearts.",4,Wistful & Charming via the Lower East Side,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,6275,"['charming', 'film', 'began',

Gelwasser,"[8, 8]","The other day I went into my local B&N; bookstore to inquire if they had recieved a newly released, DVD of the late 80's film, ""Crossing Delancey"". ""You've got to be kidding,"" the clerk said. A little taken aback, I stammered back, ""well it's a pretty good romantic-comedy"". ""Thats not what I mean"" he answered. He asked me incredulously, ""you mean to say this movie has never been on DVD before?"" The answer to the clerk's question was sadly and unbelievebly affirmative. I've been waiting for years (and wearing out my VHS copy) for one of the best romantic-comedies of the '80s to finally make it to the DVD format. Well it's finally here and time has not diminished what a wonderful movie it is!For those who don't know ""Crossing Delancey"" takes place in two different worlds of NYC. We meet Isabelle ""Izzy"" Grossman (Amy Irving). She's an independent, single, 33-year old woman, who lives and works uptown, running a prestigious book series for an old line, independent bookstore. She also has eyes for Anton Maes (Jerome Krabbe) a charming, self-involved, wolfish, Author. But Izzie's life get's turned around, when her determined, lower Eastside Jewish 'Bubbie' or Grandma (Reizl Bozyk) with the help of a 'Match-Maker'(Sylvia Miles), fixes her up with  nice guy, Sam Posner (Peter Reigert), who makes an living with an 'old neighborhood' pickle business. We watch as the conflicted Izzie must come to terms between her two worlds and finally open herself to finding true love.This is really a wonderful, romantic-comedy, that is written by Susan Sandler with a gentle humor. Both the characters of the uptown 'artsy' world and the lower eastside are equally satirized. They arn't particularly deep or even in some cases likable (particularly Izzie and the way she treats 'the Pickleman'). But all through the film, we are kept interested and hope, that the romantic leads will succeed.The film has a wonderful all around cast. The actors play their roles quite well. Amy Irving is beautiful and does a great job as a young woman, who is conflicted and keeps screwing up. Peter Reigert is fine as the 'nice guy' Pickleman (he gives a nice speech about his life). But the real scene stealer is Reizl Bozyk as Izzie's determined, Bubbie. Sure it's a bit of a hammy character, that involves some scenery chewing. But she gets away with it. Look for the (as usual) outrageous, Sylivia Miles as the 'Match-Maker'. She's gives me a big laugh, no matter what she's in. Also look for a very young, David Hyde Pierce in what just might be a forunner of his persnickity, 'Niles' character from NBC TV's ""Fraiser"".Finally mention should be made of the quite hummable soundtrack, that features the Folk-Rock group, ""The Roches"". Roche sister, Suzzy Roache has a small part in the film as Izzie's best friend, Marilyn. The music is great and it's a shame that the CD soundtract is out of print. If you wish to see a wonderful, romantic film comedy, then I highly recommend ""Crossing Delancey"".

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[1, 1]","The 1988 film ""Crossing Delancey"" is a heartwarming & funny story about a single, thirty-something Jewish woman named Isabelle 'Izzy' Grossman (Amy Irving, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the 1984 film ""Yentl"") living in New York. Her beloved grandmother, Bubbie Kantor (Reizl Bozyk, 1914-1993), decides to enlist the help of a lower east-side Jewish matchmaker, Hannah Mandelbaum (Sylvia Miles), to find Izzy a husband.  Izzy, who works in a prestigious Manhattan book store, is not really interested, but when Hannah sets Izzy up on a date with a local Jewish businessman named Sam Posner (Peter Riegert), Izzy reluctantly goes out with him.  Izzy likes Sam, but with her desire to be modern, Sam's business of selling kosher pickles makes Izzy uncomfortable.  Sam remains interested in Izzy and even gives her a gift of a new hat, but Izzy starts to become attracted to a handsome & popular novelist named Anton Maes (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;).  However, she eventually finds that Anton is a bit egocentric and reconsiders Sam, who, naturally, isn't initially sure whether Izzy is serious about him.With endearing & engaging characters and a good plot, ""Crossing Delancey"" is a delightful film for which Amy Irving received a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical"".  (The award went to Melanie Griffith for her work in the 1988 film ""Working Girl"".)

Izzy's loving but meddling Bubbie (i.e. grandmother), upset that Izzy is still single, sees a matchmaker about finding Izzy a husband. Izzy soon finds her life complicated by the results of Bubbie's actions.""Crossing"" is a sweet, gentle, and marvelously funny film. As Izzy, Amy Irving gives a wonderfully likeable and full-bodied performance. She is fun to watch as Izzy navigates her way through awkward social and professional situations. Irving gets terrific support from the rest of the cast, which includes Peter Riegert as a romantic pickle vendor and Jeroen Krabbe as a writer. Sylvia Miles is hilariously over-the-top as the matchmaker, and Reizl Borzyk nearly steals the film as Bubbie. Borzyk has particularly great chemistry with Irving.The film features great New York scenes, and the visuals are full of wonderful details (such as a priceless storefront ad for Kosher wine). The script makes effective use of the ethnic theme. This is a simple story, but told with warmth and intelligence.

Amy Irving brings an amazing depth, realness and understanding of the struggles of old vs new ways to the character of Izzy, on the one hand, striving to be part of the literary world while taking care of her grandmother, perpetually trying to fix up Izzy old-world style (hiring a matchmaker played with hilarious sizzle by Sarah Miles). Izzy starts to fall for an arrogant self-absorbed author of trashy novels while the one who really can love her fully for who she is is right under her nose at the neighborhood pickle stand.It's hilarious watching how Izzy is slowly convinced of Sam's (Peter Reigert) realness and genuine caring for her, and of course, Izzy waking up to the reality that her author wants nothing more than an administrative assistant he can sleep with. And even in the midst of all the laughs, the film comes across as EXTREMELY believable and lets you into the world of its characters and NEVER lapses into trashiness or crassness.There are unique comic moments aplenty, like Izzy having ""Some Enchanted Evening"" sung to her while at a diner with her best girlfriend, the near-disastrous first encounters with Sam, and a hilariously harrowing taxi-ride (the driver is just learning how to drive while his mother talks him through it) that leads her back to true love.In an era of lame special effects movies and actors that can't act to save their lives, ""Crossing Delancey"" is a breath of fresh air of believable characters that you can actually care about and have depth, excellent writing AND acting and brisk comedic pacing!
