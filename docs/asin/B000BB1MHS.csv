Fortunately, with the high-tech wizardry and Johnny Depp's key performance, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a rich, but darker ride.  Some of the same elements are there, and the development of the story is the same, but this time the atmosphere and the ending are much different.  Both versions have musical numbers, and the story is still basically Dante's 'Inferno' for children (with modern vices and punishments, such as excessive gum chewing or too much TV watching).  The choreography is as dazzling as the first film, but the music is updated enough to feature the Ooompah Loompahs performing rap, techno-pop, and heavy metal to deliver us sermons as well as sweeties.  The children's performances are cardboard caricatures in both movies, but Charlie is younger and maybe even more endearing this time around.  Otherwise, the tone of the factory scenes is much more ominous than the classic made nearly thirty-five years ago.The biggest difference is Johnny Depp.  He is deliberately tentative as the quirky and eccentric Willy Wonka.  His performance is admirable and androgenous, but it purposely leaves out a lot of the charm Gene Wilder provided for the role.  This Wonka seems sheltered and clueless. (Some of the flashback scenes tell more of the story, though.)  Charlie Bucket and family, however, make up for the charm deficit and provide some heart-warming surprises.

While some fans of the first film treatment will undoubtedly and stubbornly resist what Tim Burton has done here or trivialize Johnny Depp's weird and slightly maniacal performance, most others will be absolutely delighted. Burton's take is funnier, livelier, wittier, and all together more consistently entertaining than Mel Stuart's earlier film. The film is awash in color and bold and deleriously twisted set pieces. An enormous budget was spent creating this film and this fact is abundantly clear in every frame of the picture. However, the special effects and elaborate sets are always at the service of this fairy tale nightmare. Willy Wonka is given a history and motivation. Charlie is given more resonance and balance in relation to Willy Wonka and the other kids. The sinister and mischievous Oompas are funnier and are given some of the most over-the-top theatrical moments this side of Broadway. Overall, Burton's film version is truer to the spirit of the book and I do think the first film in Burton's career after his masterpiece 'Ed Wood,' that really stays true to the eccentric and amusingly bizarre character of Tim Burton himself. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is NOT just a kid's film. Parents and other adults who still have imagination will find much to enjoy and see with this one. Certainly, one of Burton's best films.

938781,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B000BB1MHS,alex bushman,"[1, 5]","This film also proves a point about the story: Charlie may be the lead, but Willy steals the show.  I think that is part of the reason the first film was good, but not as honest, or curious.  That film was like a foregone conclusion, it seemed to be a more straight to the screen feel, without the director's creative interpretation, although the title change was a slight one.  One thing that I know a lot of people will harp on is the fact that Johnny Depp was bizarre and Willy Wonka isn't bizarre.  First of all, before I saw the movie I saw the ads and I immediately felt that he was channeling Michael Jackson, well, Roger Ebert seems to agree with me, so we'll just have to find out from Johnny who his stereotype is.  Whatever the case may be, the entrapments are there within the Willy Wonka character.  If you take his character and then compile the things that he has created and what he has done with the whole golden ticket thing, etc, the man is clearly deranged.  Yes, what he created was fantastic and whimisical, but what man would do it?  Could you even dream of telling me that he wasn't a little bit disturbed? The novel hid this little detail from us by capturing the story through the eyes of a humble child who saw the world guilessly and viewed Willy's factory with wonder.  What people are really complaining about is the fact that the film doesn't really take the perspective of a child, the film is more like an overview of aspects of the entire story with another plotline written in to fit a postmodern interpretation of the film.  The film isn't delightful like the book or other movie.  That's not to say the film doesn't have its charms.  I really enjoyed certain aspects of Wonka's character, the fact that he not only had the whimsy of a child, but the temperament as well.  These things fit together for very funny situations.  Augustus was also very funny, and although he was one dimensional, he was a solid character, his gluttony just washed away any room for personality.  It's a shame that he's the first to go.  One thing that I feel Burton gets perfect is the creation of Charlie's family scenes.  They are heartwarming and real, and still funny at times while being viewed through the strange lens of Tim Burton.  I never really cared for the other kids that much, but the girl who was the perfectionist had some really interesting moments with her mother, in some ways her mother could have a movie of her own, she was just so morbid.  Veruca and Mike were both disappointing, in my opinion.  The only thing between the two of them that caught my eye was Stevie's violence against Charlie's wonderland, it was quite scary.  His dad had one of the best performances in this film.  Yes, the oompa loompas were quite annoying towards the end, but at the beginning they were quite refreshing.  One thing about the reason this film isn't a great adaptation is that postmodernism has it's faults as well as weaknesses.  At different times in the film you think back and realize that the film feels like a bunch of afterthoughts instead of a true story that has a clear throughline, and then you really think about it and it's true.  As I said, I found some of them to be funny and entertaining, but it left me cold as well.  Burton must watch his taste for revisionism because he's already made two remakes and neither really standup as stories on film, or as successors, but they do add perspectives. Is it really that interesting to view aspects of a story under a microscope and then creatively guess what the underlying meaning was, writing a script of those ideas, and then make a movie of it.  In my estimation, no, but it does spark conversation and I still hold to the fact Willy Wonka is demented.  Think about it: What would Willy do if all of the kids failed?  Who would he choose then?  It seems as if he's just as irresponsible as a child.  I did enjoy seeing him as a kid with that ridiculously deforming contraption on his head for his teeth and the morbidly tender moment between him and his father.

938782,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000BB1MHS,Alex Udvary,"[3, 6]","I have been reading so much lately from the critics about their praise for ""King Kong"". They say it is a movie that made them remember what it is to be a kid again. That it is a movie of pure visual joy. An escapist movie that's main purpose is to please. I think they are over doing it with the hype of that movie, but, if you were to ask me what movie do I think should be described this way, I would respond with, ""have you seen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""?Here is a movie that is endlessly creative. As I watched the movie I just sat back and relax while this whole new world unfolded before my eyes. I never questioned whether or not what I was seeing was possible or not because it didn't matter. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" creates its own world. A world where anything is possible. Plus that's half the joy in watching a movie like this, or even the ""Harry Potter"" series. We can visit a place such as this. The world of make believe. That is what the movies are all about.I've never been much of a fan of Tim Burton's work. I've always found his movies visually creative but too off beat for my taste. I have enjoyed ""Ed Wood"" and Edward Scissorhands"" but everything else has left me cold. ""Mars Attacks"", ""Beetlejuice"" and the original ""Batman"" all have moments of visual splendor but no heart. But in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" I feel Burton has found the perfect blend. This is a movie where Burton can be as werid and creative as he wants because in this setting he can never really go overboard. Plus the movie has heart. He has found the perfect combination. That is why I think this is his best movie.I've never read the book by Roald Dahl, which this film is based on, so I'm sorry to say I cannot comment on whether or not this movie is faithful or not. But, from what I've read from the critics supposedly this is. I have seen the 1971 film version with Gene Wilder though. I have always thought that movie was a bit creepy. I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but I remember certain scenes actually being scary. At least to a wimp like me. I have heard though people say this movie is creepy. Roger Ebert complained that Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka reminded him of Michael Jackson. I can sense why someone would say that, but I was never bothered by it. To be honest I was too busy being swept away by the film's visual to really care about his performance. But I never really found it creepy because again, in a movie like this you can never look at anything with a normal eye. The world created here cannot be compared to our normal existence.If you honestly don't know what the movie is about it follows a young boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who wins a golden ticket when he buys a bar of wonka chocolate. With the golden ticket he, along with four other children, will be able to go inside Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and discover how Wonka's candy is made.Along the way though strange these start to happen to the children. Each ""accident"" is of course fitting to each child's personality. One child loves to eat chocolate for example, so of course it is the chocolate that gets him in the end. Another child is spoiled and it is because of her ways she meets her own fate. ""She's a bad nut"", Charlie says. In this sense I've always thought the movie was a moral parable warnng children not to behave badly. I could be wrong, but that's how I've always interrupted things.The only thing in the movie I don't like were the songs sung by the Oompa Loompa's (all played by the same person, Deep Roy). To me they weren't as charming or memorable as the ones in the orginal. Though four of the five songs have lyrics written by Dahl.In the end though this is a minor complaint. The real star of the movie is the visual details that make up this world. Anyone looking for an escape from reality should see this movie. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences I've had this year.

938784,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000BB1MHS,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","When popular philosopher Barry White shared these immortal words with America, he might easily have been working from the Roald Dahl playbook.  Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is an oddly moralistic tale about the hazards of excess, not just of sweets, but parental indulgence, competitiveness, and aggression.  The question is, why remake it?  Fortunately, there are many valid reasons.While Gene Wilder has given us many wonderful performances, his rendition was too drenched in saccharine musical theatre numbers to satisfy and now looks dated.  Tim Burton, by contrast, brings not only his reliably astonishing visual imagination to the party, but also a bittersweet sensibility perfectly in keeping with Dahl's perspective.  Lucky for us he also brings frequent co-conspirator Johnny Depp, and musical wiz Danny Elfman.  In addition to being one of our very best actors, Depp is most drawn to roles that offer interesting challenges.  His Willy Wonka, in addition to being a sartorial splendor, is part perpetual child, part mad scientist, part eccentric gazillionaire, and part absent-minded professor.  That he allows justice to work itself out in his presence is more a matter of absent-mindedness than malevolence.  Indeed, the faults of the children involved - and their parents - appear to provide their own lessons and punishments with little help from Willy.From black and gray cityscapes reminiscent of Batman to color so dazzling you might request a pair of Charlie's oversize sunglasses, this film gives your eyes a workout they will never forget - simply spectacular.  Special recognition must be given to Deep Roy who, through the miracle of digital technology, plays all of the innumerable Oompa Loompas.  With almost no lines he manages to improve every scene he's in, and the musical numbers, which draw from Busby Berkeley to Saturday Night Fever and all points in between, are simply fantastic.  (Elfman really came through on these, they have a hip, ironic sensibility thoroughly lacking in the Wilder version.)That Helena Bonham Carter was willing to lend her name to the project when she has little to do but chop cabbage tells you a great deal about the quality level.  Finally, Charlie Bucket, played winningly by Freddie Highmore, is every bit as ingratiating and unassuming as we would like him to be, he deserves his good fortune.  (After seeing the headgear Willy had to wear as a child, you will agree that he deserves a break too.)  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have done it again, a wonderful movie worth owning and watching many times.",5,"""Too Much Of Anything Is Not Good For You, Babe.""

I must admit as well that, while the 70's film did some creative things by way of special effects that were possible at the time, Burton's film is a special-effects marvel.

938793,A3P2R1WF7A03V1,B000BB1MHS,"Amazon Customer ""NJ Review Guy""","[1, 4]","How do you receive a remake of one of the most beloved family movies of the last three decades?  A movie rerun each year on TV as a special event and boasts a fanbase as close in number or at least as fanatically dedicated to that of say The Wizard of OZ or It's A Wonderful Life.  I guess you tread carefully for both the original's and new version's sake.  Afterall, both movies are based on Roald Dahl's children's book and so both are merely filmed interpretations of written material.  However the Gene Wilder one is a cherished classic all over the world, so obviously Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory was in for some definite close scrutiny.How does it stand up?  Fairly well.  The film's fantasy look is beautiful.  Especially well realized is Charlie's family's bleak shack of a house.  When the chocolate contest is announced and Charlie's grandfather comments that only rich fat children will win because their families can afford chocolate daily and considering Charlie's family only can afford to buy him a chocolate bar once a year on his birthday, not only do we pity the boy, but we firmly believe the statement because of the spot on art direction.  Charlie's family is so poor, they can't even afford a proper door to the house - it visually screams poverty at us every time it's opened because it's cut into the wall at a cartoon crazy like angle.  Burton's animator's penchant for the bizarre is still very much alive and always welcome.  And since the story is basically a big fantasy, we buy it and love it.The cast is all more than competent, but none ever approach the sweetness, mischievousness or outright brattiness of say the actress who played the original Veruka Salt.  They serve their roles nicely, but that's all.  Charlie's is a strong performance, but again since the movie is ultimately really not about him, you're left not really caring.  And last but not least there's Johnny Depp.  Sigh... Ok here goes.I like Johnny Depp.  I really do.  I like him in everything he does.  He's one of the most versatile actors around and he never bores me.  He picks fun, intelligent and just great movies to be a part of and Charlie & The Chocolate Factory certainly is well produced and directed.  However, his performance is uneven and ultimately I feel he's been miscast.  There was a quiet authority in Wilder's performance which always made you believe he was in charge - albeit in a wacky way.  Depp feels a pretender to the throne, not only inheriting the role, but in just our belief in him being a candy magnate.  We don't buy it.  He seems more akin to the childlike pop star he's denied mimicking for the role.  The bottom line for me is Depp's performance never takes off, it never soars.  He's always just ok or slightly amusing.  There's little depth to the character as written, so that should be stated as well, however what he is given he does very little with.  Wilder's explosive condemnation of the children's behavior and most specifically Charlie's at the original's finale shocked us and was believably powerful.  Here we have a ho-hum sort of conclusion which then turns into a schmaltzy family reunion.  It nearly reminds one of Scrooge's redemption at the close of A Christmas Carol, but what a dull Scrooge this Wonka is throughout his journey.How about listening pleasure?  The original while not a true musical had several memorable musical numbers and catchy tunes.  Some so popular they hit the pop charts and have become classics themselves - most notably ""The Candy Man Can""  These tunes served to push the story forward and were entertaining.  Danny Elfman's music for Burton's version is alright, however it's restricted only to the oompah loompahs and feels almost out of place here.  I think Burton should have either gone with more music like the original or none at all.  This half hearted attempt never gets your feet stomping or hands clapping and basically falls flat on a sour note.Honestly, I expected much more from Burton's treatment and will definitely only watch one version of Dahl's popular story when I'm in the mood for a Wonka chocolate fix.  I just hope there's room for both versions now.  I'd hate to have this one take the original's place and be the one to watch each year as an event movie.  Of course, those days may indeed be over with so many ways to watch and time-shift films.  And not to get maudlin, but maybe film's way of stoking our imagination is over too.

This is a Tim Burton work full of his own unique way of approaching a subject.  The storyline is ultimately a morality tale of the author Dahl.  Each child personifying a particular vice (or in Charlie's case, virtue).  Like the denizens of Dante's inferno -- each child's bad habit or malicious behavior leads to an exactly appropriate retribution.  This is not lighthearted children's fun, by any means.  The factory as presented by Burton is a weird yet beautiful place -- but very ominous at all times.  Johnny Depp is his usual genius.  How can anyone not admire his excellent work.  Especially good, too, are the children actors.  But my biggest praise has to go the the design and presentation of the oompa loompas.  One actor, Deep Roy, plays them all -- and what a marvelous job he does!  You really have to see this to believe it.

938795,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000BB1MHS,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[19, 26]","Inevitably it's going to be compared to the 1971 musical which while a classic on its own, was indeed very little like the book.I only read the book as a child and I can't remember much except the scritchy little drawings and the fact that Squirrels attacked Veruca Salt instead of Geese (though they didn't attack her, she just fell down the chute).If this movie is close to the book, then I must have read a wrong version of the book, or else the 1971 musical is an improvement on what must have been a kiddie-snuff tale, like Dahl's ""The Twits"" only with innocent people instead of evil spouses.What we have here is yet another film for Tim Burton to delve into his cliche's (or perhaps fetishes) of people so insanely pale, pasty, and white they're either the living dead or a racist caricature of British people.  Absolutely no one looks remotely human save for Christopher Lee and Freddie Highmore.  Everyone else has been made-up, airbrushed, and photoshopped worse than a Vogue or Playboy photoshoot.While some may have hated them, I thought the Oompa Loompa's performances were the best part of the movie.  Although they were apparently supposed to be based on the songs in the book with moral messages, I couldn't hear the lyrics clearly enough so whatever messages contained were wasted, even more so by the insanely escalating displays of CGI frilly-ness and confetti and effects.  All substance was lost behind effects and music.While the story is indeed more about Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, the 1971 musical (again with this) managed to make the other kids and their parents interesting characters in themselves who were memorable enough to become fodder for many spoofs by entertainers over the years.  Here, they're just cannon fodder.Indeed like other reviewers say, the kids aren't taught anything except ""YOU DIE NOW!"" and then put into situations like a cartoonish parody of Jigsaw's traps (""Saw""), be it Violet Beauregard not only inflating with juice, but doing so so that she becomes large as a building, which would/should kill any normal person, and brings back fond (ie, horrifying) memories of the trailers for ""Slither"" featuring a woman being blown up so large, she pops and explodes in a huge wave of blood and gore.  You pretty much know the rest.  None of the kids do anything to warrant these attempted murders beyond doing what kids normally do.  Example: whereas in the 1971 musical (AGAIN), Wonka tells Violet not to chew the gum, first seriously, then groaning and nonchalantly, in this version he doesn't say anything to stop her except to look like a famous pop singer.  Veruca runs off to look at the pretty squirrels, and Wonka intentionally stalls in opening up the gate to let her father out to free her.Then there's Willy Wonka, or as everyone who saw the movie calls him, Michael Jackson: the Parody Spoof.  Burton's fetish for the pasty and pale runs roughshod on Johnny Depp to a point where he is completely white as the background of the text I am writing this review on now.  Add his high-pitched voice and childish (rather than childlike) behavior and his complete and painfully awkward behavior around children and it seems like he's been court-ordered not to get too close to children or else...His reactions/behavior to the children as well is highly childish, rather than like a father-figure as in the 1971 musical (  ).  Example: in the musical, whenever Mike Teevee asks too many questions or annoys Wonka with his talking, Wonka has some clever little thing to say, such as ""I'm a bit deaf in this ear, please speak up next time"" or ""I'm sorry, all questions must be submitted later in writing"".  Here, Wonka only stares at him awkwardly, occasionally tells him he's mumbling (when he's not), and at the pinnacle of it, just freaks out going ""MUMBLIIIIING!!!  MUMBLING!"" like he's a sociopath.An entirely Burton-made subplot involves Wonka having issues with his father, a dentist, which causes not only flashbacks to very painfully executed scenes, but a demonization of his father played to odd and scary perfection by Christopher Lee, to a point where you wonder if perhaps Dr. Wonka abused his child.  These flashbacks bring the movie's momentum to horrendous stops as Wonka suddenly freezes up and goes catatonic to have them, then emerges frozen-stiff and twitching, until someone wakes him up.Then the entire thing comes apart at the end where Charlie wins the factory, and asks the crucial question of Wonka; can his family come with him.In the 1971 musical (HAHA AGAIN), Wonka says of course they can.  Here, Wonka says of course they can....'t.And with that, Wonka goes from odd mentor, confused and befuddled father figure, to an orphan [...] child who sprouted into wealth yet does not know love.In the end, Charlie proves to be the bigger man by rejecting Wonka's proposal because he would rather stay in the loving embraces of his poor family than live a cold, heartless life of decadence with Wonka in his factory.  And Wonka cannot even begin to understand why.And that is where the movie comes off its hinges and dies broke and alone in a gutter, as the pivotal mastermind of the film becomes nothing more than a befuddled, spoiled, loveless little brat who tries to kill off four children just to make a new permanent playmate.At the end, Wonka still learns nothing, but finally cedes to Charlie's request by moving the entire family into his factory, and culminates in a dinner scene so dismally awkward and painfully executed that just one viewing makes me feel like less of a person for having viewed it.  No one learned anything here; Charlie proved to be the true adult here, smart and mature enough to put his family above riches and wealth.And still, Willy Wonka the Michael Jackson Impersonator cannot even begin to understand why.",1,No morals here.

938797,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BB1MHS,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I am a huge fan of the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder, so I was skeptical about this 2005 remake.  While Burton's film doesn't match the brilliance of Stuart's classic it does have its moments and there are many redeeming qualities.  It does differ drastically from the `71 film, which is probably a good thing in that it can't find itself chastised too much for failing to live up, for in the end it views like a completely different movie.  Both films were based on Roald Dahl's book, although it was made clear that Dahl disapproved of the `71 film.The basis or foundation of this film is the same as the previous.  A young poor boy finds a golden ticket that gives him the chance to tour the Chocolate Factory of one Willy Wonka.  He's accompanied by his grandfather as well as four other children and their parents, all of which have some very undesirable personality traits.  Their `flaws' so-to-speak end up costing them a great deal in the long run as they make their way through the wacky and crazy factory.`Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is considerably lighter fare than `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. This has a lot to do with the difference in approach that both Depp and Wilder took to the character of Willy Wonka.  Depp is much more comical and slapstick than Wilder was.  I much prefer Wilder's performance for he added layers of darkness and I think in the end it was his performance that elevated the true morale that this story sets out to embrace.  Depp, looking scarily like Michael Jackson (don't even begin to try and say that he wasn't an inspiration), is hilarious and he proves yet again he is a true chameleon, but I just don't think that his performance is as iconic as Wilder's.What was a nice improvement were the performances given by the child actors here.  All five of them really shine.  We all know that young Freddie Highmore can act; just watch his marvelous performance in `Finding Neverland' (can you say OSCAR SNUB).  Here he is charming and sweet.  AnnaSophia Robb, dubbed the next Dakota Fanning, delivers a very strong performance that sets her apart as `best in show' in my opinion as far as the child actors go.  Julia Winter is also on point and convincing.  Jordan Fry is supremely obnoxious, truly commanding and while Philip Wiegratz isn't really given much to work with, he works well with it.  The parts of the parents are also played well.  Missi Pyle (hilarious), James Fox, Adam Godley and Franziska Troegner are all decent here.  David Kelly is good as Grandpa Joe, although I just loved Jack Albertson's performance.  I wish that Helena Bonham Carter would have had a heftier role, but just looking at her is enough for me sometimes.What can't be denied is the fact that Tim Burton's imagination is boundless.  Visually `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is flawless.  Everything is lush and rich.  That is the biggest draw to this remake; it is a visual masterpiece.  The sets, the costumes, the candy; it is all marvelously created and embellished.  It reminds me in parts of what `Alice in Wonderland' would look like brought to the big screen once again (let's pitch that idea to Tim Burton...with maybe AnnaSophia Robb as Alice...).The biggest drawback to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' though is the horrendous new songs and musical numbers.  What I found so irritating is the fact that you can't understand a single word Deep Roy is uttering.  I loved the original songs.  I was depressed they had changed them.  They were messy and sloppy and horrendous.In the end I think that `Charlie and Chocolate Factory' may delight more children then the original film did.  This is much lighter and more campy that the Stuart masterpiece.

938798,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B000BB1MHS,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[1, 3]","I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night for the first time (I'm behind the times, yes) and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey Tim Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about... It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many - the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes - you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet... So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.What, can I tell you more? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.Thank you, Tim Burton. Thank you very much.",5,yeah...,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,5411,"['saw', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'times', 'yes', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"",

938799,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000BB1MHS,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 4]","I remember the first time that I saw a trailer for this; my friend showed it to me on my computer, and it absolutely freaked me out.  It was colorful, it was trippy, and it had a VERY annoying song in the background.  Yet, I still was drawn to it.  For one thing, Tim Burton was directing it, and I have liked most of the Tim Burton movies that I have seen (let's not go into a Planet of the Apes discussion).  And while Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me, Johnny Depp took the role, made it his own, and did a very good job with it.Seeing as how most people already know the ending, I am going to be a little more open with spoilers than I normally am.  Anyway, the choclateer Willy Wonka owns an amazing chocolate factory that churns out some of the best chocolate in the world.  Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy living with his parents (Noal Taylor, Helena Bonham Carter) and his grandparents (David Kelly, Eileen Essell, David Morris, and Liz Smith), most of whom have personalities in this film.  In the original, only Grandpa Joe was fleshed out as a character, but in this version, the only one without a distinct personality is Grandma Josephine (Essell).  Joe (Kelly) is an ex-worker in the factory, George (Morris) is a bit of a cynic, and Georgina (Smith) is a bit senile.  But they are all a very loving family.After years of shutting himself off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to visit his factory due to past spies, Wonka has decided to allow 5 children to visit his factory.  They will be chosen through the use of Golden Tickets; 5 tickets are randomly placed into Wonka Bars going all over the world.  The first 4 children to find them are rich, fat, or have some special means to get the ticket that most children, especially Charlie, don't have.  Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is an overweight German boy who could (and probably does) eat his weight in chocolate each day.  Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is an over-spoiled girl whose father (James Fox) gives her whatever her heart desires (and the desire is fleeting; the moment she receives the ticket, without even saying ""thank you"", she asks for a new pony).  Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) is an overcompetetive gum-chewing champ who feels that if she doesn't win the ticket, she fails.  It doesn't help that her mother (Missi Pyle) encourages the behavior.  Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) is a video-game playing genius (with anger issues) who devises a mathematical formula to track down the ticket.  He only bought one bar (and didn't even eat it because he dislikes the taste of chocolate, which begs the question why he wanted to win a trip to a chocolate factory).  Charlie finds the ticket based on pure luck.  But soon the five children are off to the factory.Once there, they meet the Oompa Loompas (all of them are played by Deep Roy), see fantastic machines and gizmos (such as a waterfall that exists to mix the chocolate), and meet their demise.  Yes, meet their demise.  Each character is done in by their flaws (gluttany, competitiveness, greed, and pride).  And with each loss of a child, Wonka seems almost elated.This movie is a lot truer to its source material than the original (I mean this neither as a compliment or a jab, I am merely stating a fact).  The fact that Charlie's dad is alive, the Indian palace made of chocolate, and the departing view of the other four children after their mishaps (which I was very happy to see) were all in the book, but not the original film.  Although, the fact that the movie explored Wonka's childhood was both a blessing and a curse.  It was very interesting to see where Wonka came from (and it's always great to see Christopher Lee), but the whole point is that we don't know why Wonka is the way he is.This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone, and I can foresee some Wilder vs. Depp fan arguments on the horizon.

938800,A3C37W8WGMV8UQ,B000BB1MHS,Angela Dalecki,"[6, 8]","If you're anything like me, you grew up on the 1971 movie Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder. And, like me, you may have been more than a little skeptical when you first heard rumors about a remake starring Johnny Depp. But when I heard that Tim Burton-the man responsible for many magical, whimsical films (most recently, Big Fish)-was going to be directing, my negative thoughts blew out the window. I knew I could trust him with this one.And boy, was I right. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is, hands-down, one of the best movies I've seen all year. The original story by Roald Dahl is well-known to children and adults alike: A mysterious candy-maker named Willy Wonka announces that he's re-opening his chocolate factory after being closed for many, many years. But he's not opening the factory to the general public-only to a few select people. These people will be chosen by a contest-five golden tickets are hidden inside Wonka bars and shipped to different parts of the world. The five ""golden ticket"" winners and their guests are allowed into the factory for one day.The first four tickets are found by nasty, greedy, and generally unlikable children. But the fifth ticket is found by a sweet boy from a poor family named Charlie, and it's his story that we follow throughout the movie.I really enjoyed this version, and I actually prefer it to the 1971 version. Tim Burton was undoubtedly the perfect choice for director, and this adaptation turned out to be much truer to the original novel. The ""look"" that Burton gives his locations and characters is so consistent with the book that many of the characters actually look like they just stepped out of the pages of a Roald Dahl novel.Johnny Depp is hilarious as the peculiar candy maker Willy Wonka, and all of the children turn out outstanding performances-especially young Freddie Highmore, who plays Charlie. The plot moves quickly, peppered with high-energy, show-stopping numbers with the Oompa-Loompas. And Danny Elfman's musical score complements the movie brilliantly. There was a tiring subplot involving Willy Wonka's father that I could have done without, but other than that, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory gets two thumbs way, way up.",5,Roald Dahl would be pleased...,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2239,"[""'re"", 'anything', 'grew', 'up', '1971', 'movie', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'little', 'skeptical', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'rumors', 'remake', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'when', 'heard', 'Tim', 'Burton-the', 'man', 'responsible', 'many', 'magical', 'whimsical', 'films', 'most', 'recently', 'Big', 'Fish', 'going', 'be', 'directing', 'negative', 'thoughts', 'blew', 'out', 'window', 'knew', 'could', 'trust', 'one.And', 'boy', 'was', 'right', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'hands-down', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'original', 'story', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'well-known', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'mysterious', 'candy-maker', 'named', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 're-opening', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'being', 'closed', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'not', 'opening', 'factory', 'general', 'public-only', 'few', 'select', 'people', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'chosen', 'contest-five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'are', 'hidden', 'Wonka', 'bars', 'shipped', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'five', 'golden', 'ticket', 'winners', 'guests', 'are', 'allowed', 'factory', 'one', 'day.The', 'first', 'four', 'tickets', 'are', 'found', 'nasty', 'greedy', 'generally', 'unlikable', 'children', 'fifth', 'ticket', 'found', 'sweet', 'boy', 'poor', 'family', 'named', 'Charlie', 'story', 'follow', 'movie.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'actually', 'prefer', '1971', 'version', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'perfect', 'choice', 'director', 'adaptation', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'truer', 'original', 'novel', 'look', 'Burton', 'locations', 'characters', 'so', 'consistent', 'book', 'many', 'characters', 'actually', 'look', 'just', 'stepped', 'pages', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'novel.Johnny', 'Depp', 'hilarious', 'peculiar', 'candy', 'maker', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'children', 'turn', 'out', 'outstanding', 'performances-especially', 'young', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'who', 'Charlie', 'plot', 'moves', 'quickly', 'peppered', 'high-energy', 'show-stopping', 'numbers', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'musical', 'score', 'complements', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'was', 'tiring', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'father', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'two', 'thumbs', 'way', 'way', 'up']",N/A

My family, at least since the time I could remember, has always watched this movie on Easter Day, usually right before dinner, with the newest generation of children. But, unlike my family, I never had any interest in the old Chocolate Factory movie. In fact, I never watched the entire thing the whole way through until about a year ago. I liked it, but I didn't see the magic in it that everyone else saw. It's not a Wizard of Oz, like it's often compared to.When the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remake came out, I was once again uninterested. These movies just aren't my thing. I had no real care to see it. In fact, the only thing I really cared about was the fact that Tim Burton directed it. It wasn't enough for me to want to go to the theaters, though, so I let it pass from my mind.Later, I was given the opportunity to watch Burton's Chocolate Factory on DVD. What the heck, I thought, may as well give it a chance. And from the moment I hit start, I was entranced. Remakes aren't often the best movies, but this movie is excellent, more memorable than the first, I think. Most people know the story of the movies, so I won't go into that. I will say, however, that this movie adds a great deal to the Charlie and the Chocolate factory franchise. Firstly, it's a darker Willie Wonka with a past. We get to see some of his motivation for wanting to start a chocolate factory. We're also given a few fresh songs, sung from a different style of Oompah Loompah. And, it's modernized. I think that's the reason why I didn't like the first Chocolate Factory like others do, because it's just a little beyond my time. Everything in this version was brought up to date.Johnny Depp was an excellent choice for the new Willie Wonka, mainly because the Charlie in this film works so well with him, and is a fine young actor by himself. The young actor (whose name escapes me) previously played J. M. Barrie's inspiration for Peter Pan in the movie Finding Neverland. The other children, whose roles are familiar to the first movie, play their parts just as well as they were played before.This is a new holiday movie, not made to exactly replace the old version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it's definitely a more modern equal to the film classic. I'd recommend this movie to lovers of the first movie as well as those new to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory world, if that's even possible.

And when the story goes along, it talks about why Johnny Depp start losing his creativity of chocolate flavor when he feels horrible inside because of the pain he carried.  This is just like in human lives, when we are struggling some kind of an emotional pain, the factory (the mind), will lose its way to create, to bring joy (chocolate symbolizes joy/happiness) to others.It is one of the greatest movie for adults and kids to watch together, especially during holiday season.Musicals are fantastic and there are lessons kids need to learn behind it from those other kids who went to the factory at the same time too.

I mean the combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is usualy cinematic greatness...  not to mention, this movie came out the day before my brithday AND was said to be the last great box office money-maker this summer.I saw this movie on opening day, with a huge audience!  I was expecting a dark, yet slightly comedic movie - along the lines of LIMINY SNICKET or HARRY POTTER. I was impressed by the creepiness of the grandparents, the honesty of Freddie Highmore's performance, and the hard-working Oompa Loompas (considering that they used one actor to do all the Oompa Loompa moves, I figured he was the hardest working one in the movie).  There is no mystery to Willy Wonka - he reminds me of a cross between Michael Jackson, Mickey Mouse, and The Cat In The hat.  I didn't find Johnny Depp's performance believable. The kids playing Veruka Salt and Mike TV are forgetable. The girl playing Violet & the lady who played her mom seem like Barbie dolls with beauxtox (more perfect than perfect)...but the supposedly ""bad kids"" in the movie gave me the impression that it was just an image they were putting on.I was unmoved by any of the movie's comedic attempts.  The ending, I thought, was an even bigger let-down than everything else in the movie.What I was impressed with, besides the guy acting as all of the Oompa Loompas, was the parents of Mike TV (they seemed as if they'd been ravaged by years of watching TV and that it had worn them down and stripped them of their souls).  I also liked the score, but I felt like the 'kiddie' songs that Danny Elfman wrote, are very forgetable.

The first adaptation, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, lost many themes and ideas from the book. It was meant for simpler viewers. Baisicaly calling all fat people greedy and all people who watch tv dumb. This movie better explains that, showing that the fat character was eliminated for being greedy, not fat, which I'm sure you should know is always parent's fault and causes major self-esteem isues today. The tv-adicted character was eliminated for not having any imagination, not for just watching too much tv. Watching a lot of tv is only bad if the person just does it out of boredom and does not expect to learn (let's not forget that if you're watching this, you're watching it on tv.) In the 70's movie, characters are being eliminated just for the simplest of traits that most good kids have. And Gene Wilder does not resemble the character of Willy Wonka at all as he was in the book, Johnny Depp does. Same goes for the actors who played Charlie, Violet, Violet's Mother, Mike, and Veruca's Father. In the ""original"" movie (which almost killed the book) Charlie was just as horrible as the other kids because he fell into the trap and drank the fizzy lifting drinks, only to be saved by luck.

938811,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B000BB1MHS,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 2]","Tim Burton has done it again! When the film concluded, little children with their chocolate-smudged faces had nothing to do but stand up and cheer. No kidding. They actually cheered. Parents were satisfied that they didn't drop eight bucks on a chocolatey mess and everyone else, fans of the old movie and the book alike, enjoyed it as well. What's not to enjoy? Johnny Depp is amazing as Willy Wonka, with his broad grin and pearly teeth, displaying indifference toward the five children lucky enough to tour his factory and utter joy at his wonderfully delicious candy. Willy Wonka believes that he knows what is important in life-- candy candy candy. But he couldn't be more wrong.Unless you've been living under a rock, you should know the story. Willy Wonka, inventor of dozens of candy concoctions, puts five Golden Tickets into the wrappers of his candy and sends them to different corners of the world. The tickets eventually land in the hands of the fat chocolate addict Augustus Gloop, spoiled brat Veruca Salt, gum chewing maniac Violet Beauregard, the violent video gamer Mike Teevee, and of course, the hero of the story, the sweet, innocent, and ordinary boy Charlie Bucket. You will love Freddie Highmore as Bucket. He's so perfect, so adorable, and little Charlie knows exactly what the most important thing in life is-- family family family.So instead of bogging this review down with more plot points that you should probably already know, I'll just skip to what makes this such a great film. Tim Burton! He set out to make a version that was more like the book. Well he succeeded plus some! This is not at all a re-make of that fluffy 70s movie. The style, the sound, the characters are all wonderfully different. There's more SUBSTANCE, especially with Wonka's character. And the only singing comes from the Oompa Loompas. Thank God. His style, from the design of the candy room to the crookedness of Charlie's house, is more what I had in mind when I read the book. One of the toughest things for me to overcome while watching this movie was the Oompa Loompas. Forget the orange faces and green hair.

Each time as I left the theater, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much. I think it is absoultely fantastic. For me, this movie is like Pirates of the Caribbean; I never get tired of watching it.Although Johnny Depp is probably better-suited in a more serious role, once again his acting is phenomenal. I found myself laughing out loud many times at his quirky comments and girlish giggles. I don't see anything ""creepy"" about him. He is a loony but genius man who was forced to raise himself, and probably with very little human contact. It can only be expected that he be a little, uh...eccentric. He is really just a child at heart, traumatized by his strict, dentist father (a very interesting twist to the story). And when his guests arrive, he is uncertain as to how he should act around them, but he is thrilled showing off his factory. I think Depp's Wonka is just as lovable and charismatic as Wilder's Wonka. Deep Roy (as the Oompa Loompas) is absolutely hilarious. He may be the best part of the entire movie. It was very clever to have one actor play the Oompa Loompas, rather than several. The Oompa Loompa songs were great as well. The lyrics are taken straight from the book, unlike the '71 version. The colors and graphics are so amazing...I could almost smell the chocolate. Not to mention Danny Elfman's music. After I saw this movie for the first time, I immediately bought the soundtrack. It is excellent.As far as comparing this movie to the old one, I think this one is much better. The only thing about the '71 movie is Gene Wilder-I do admit he was good. Other than that, I think the old movie is terribly boring. Burton's movie never has a dull moment. Today's technology has allowed this movie to be the way it should be: a delectable feast for your eyes and ears. It is also much much funnier than the old movie...all the characters make me laugh at one point or another-not just Wonka's character. I especially like Violet Beauregarde's mother. She is very comical.Do be warned, however: one time I saw this movie, a girl about 2 or 3 years old was sitting on her dad's lap, and she was scared to death of this movie...(she covered her eyes when the squirrels attacked Veruca, and she cried when Violet turned into a blueberry)...but I would think any children over the age of 4/5 would approve.Exciting, vibrant, hilarious, goofy, sinister, heartfelt, eccentric and just plain fun...this movie is thoroughly enjoyable!",5,Wow!,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,2542,"['Wow', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', '4', 'times', 'theaters', 'already', '3', '4', 'times', 'ending', 'applause', 'time', 'left', 'theater', 'cheeks', 'hurt', 'smiling', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'absoultely', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'it.Although', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'probably', 'better-suited', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'found', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'times', 'quirky', 'comments', 'girlish', 'giggles', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'creepy', 'loony', 'genius', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'raise', 'probably', 'very', 'little', 'human', 'contact', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'little', 'uh', 'eccentric', 'really', 'just', 'child', 'heart', 'traumatized', 'strict', 'dentist', 'father', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'story', 'when', 'guests', 'arrive', 'uncertain', 'how', 'should', 'act', 'thrilled', 'showing', 'off', 'factory', 'think', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'just', 'lovable', 'charismatic', 'Wilder', 'Wonka', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'have', 'one', 'actor', 'play', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'rather', 'several', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'songs', 'were', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'lyrics', 'are', 'taken', 'straight', 'book', ""'71"", 'version', 'colors', 'graphics', 'are', 'so', 'amazing', 'could', 'almost', 'smell', 'chocolate', 'Not', 'mention', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'music', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'immediately', 'bought', 'soundtrack', 'excellent.As', 'far', 'comparing', 'movie', 'old', 'one', 'think', 'one', 'much', 'better', 'only', 'thing', ""'71"", 'movie', 'Gene', 'Wilder-I', 'do', 'admit', 'was', 'good', 'Other', 'think', 'old', 'movie', 'terribly', 'boring', 'Burton', 'movie', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'Today', 'technology', 'allowed', 'movie', 'be', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'delectable', 'feast', 'eyes', 'ears', 'also', 'much', 'much', 'funnier', 'old', 'movie', 'characters', 'make', 'laugh', 'one', 'point', 'another-not', 'just', 'Wonka', 'character', 'especially', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'mother', 'very', 'comical.Do', 'be', 'warned', 'however', 'one', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'girl', '2', '3', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'sitting', 'dad', 'lap', 'was', 'scared', 'death', 'movie', 'covered', 'eyes', 'when', 'squirrels', 'attacked', 'Veruca', 'cried', 'when', 'Violet', 'turned', 'blueberry', 'would', 'think', 'children', 'age', '4/5', 'would', 'approve.Exciting', 'vibrant', 'hilarious', 'goofy', 'sinister', 'heartfelt', 'eccentric', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'movie', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable']",N/A

Well, to be perfectly honest, they didn't re-make Willy Wonka. They made Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version, but was open to see this one because of who was behind it. Tim Burton and company didn't re-do Gene or anything else. This is more of the story that Roald Dahl wrote. It is no secret that Dahl himself wasn't really happy about the original film. It was different. For those of you out there who have not read the book, this may come as a shock. A shock that this fancy new version that they may deem as an ""insult"" to the original is actually closer to the actual story. This is why this is not so much a re-make, as much as a new try at the actual story that Dahl wrote. The Indian prince, Wonka crash landing at the Bucket residence, both parents being there, and other things, were all in the book. Not in Wilder's version. Burton is a perfect fit for this movie, and he whisks us away into another gorgeous looking world. The film still manages to evoke the fond memories of the original, and it has that Burton feel of whimsical fantasy like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Big Fish"". There is no denying that the movie looks great. The story, as if you didn't already know it and no need to go through it again, puts more emphasis on the Wonka character and his background. The storyline about Wonka's father is new and added on to the movie. It is interesting. How many of you have wondered where this man came from?. Johnny Depp is incredible. He looks funky and speaks in weird tones, but you can't take your eyes off of him. He is quite amazing, and pulls off whatever it is he is trying to do. This is not Wilder's Wonka. This is a whole new conception. The set design and effects are wondrous. No matter how a Burton movie turns out, you know it will look great and be a visionary treat. This one is no exception. Young Freddie Highmore is wonderful as Charlie Bucket. He is a wonderful little young actor, and really brings young Charlie to life. Deep Roy plays all of the Oompa Loompas. That's right. Every single one of them is the same guy. His part is where the only music comes in. This is not a musical in the way the original was. And that's for the best. The other kids are all wonderfully pulled together, and they don't stray too far at all from the original portrayals. One thing I think is missing is the humor. Don't get me wrong, there is hummor here and I chuckled a few times, but it's not the humor like in the original. The original was kind of black, but it's missing here. Bummer. The movie also has a narration, which the original did not. The new narration adds that whimsical fairy tale quality to it. I believe it is Christopher Lee doing the narration. He also pops up in the film as Wonka's never before seen father. ""Charlie"" is not the greatest thing ever made, but it is a feast for the eyes and for the kids in all of us. I doubt it will take over from the original, but it is well done in it's own right. I didn't find it to be scary at all. Others say it was too scary for kids, or that their kids were scared. I don't see it. I had three kids, all under 7, watch it and were totally enraptured. Burton continues to be a genius, and Depp his muse. I look forward to further pairings.

That was something that really added to the storyline.  They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too. I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original wasn't anywhere to be seen in this one, but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it.Oh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them.  A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.  Good call.  I don't know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.  I don't want to reveal what happens at the end, so let's just say that when the factory tour is over, and Charlie leaves, there's still a decent chunk of storyline left.I was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of ""living in a world of chocolate"" element wasn't really there, which is definitely a bad thing.  I mean, come on.  We ALL want a world of chocolate!

So when I sat down with my friend to watch it, we had high hopes.The set design, costumes, music (Danny Elfman rocks!)are great and all have that Burton-esque manic uncomfortableness we have come to love.  And Johnny Depp gives a crazy/creepy aspect to Willy Wonka, which is exactly what I would have wanted, although with the caveat I mention below. So why didn't I like this film?It's hard for me to say exactly.  Part of it is that the script seemed to drag in places.  Part of it was that I didn't care about the characters one way or the other; Charlie himself comes off so saccharine sweet, but in a way that didn't fit with the creepy hyper-cheerfulness of the rest of the flick, that I WANTED something untoward to happen to him.  Willy Wonka, while appropriately creepy, also came off more as a petulent, bitchy little brat, rather than as a mad genius / eternal kid.  And the little oopah-loompa songs, while a tip of the hat to the original movie, were juvenile. These are some of the things that bothered me.  Any one or two would have been OK, but the combo of all these and more doomed the film.  Clearly, this film is not for me.The DVD itself is fine; clear picture, clear sound.

938819,A3QVI57VT1VGRO,B000BB1MHS,"bensmomma ""bensmomma""","[28, 36]","You just need to get the old version of the movie out of your head before you see this, and approach it with an open mind.  It's not really a musical, and it's not exclusively a kid's movie.  But to my mind it's the best movie Tim Burton ever made, and considerably increased my assessment of Johnny Depp, whom you will find weird if you were hoping for Gene Wilder and wonderful if you were hoping for the actual Willy Wonka as written by the original author, Roald Dahl.I had the strange experience of seeing Johnny Depp in ""Finding Neverland"" and two days later in ""Chocolate Factory.""  Johnny's turn as Willy Wonka is the strangest, weirdest, and most engaging performance of any kind I've seen in years.  It's what Jim Carrey in ""Unfortunate Events"" couldn't be: interesting, complex, and subtle.  It makes the new ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" not only the best movie of the summer but one that will be worth owning and rewatching time and again.More importantly, Depp's and director Tim Burton's vision of the Roald Dahl novel seems much closer to Dahl's own way of thinking:  in Dahl novels, adults are incomprehensibly self-involved, ignoring their malevolent influence on the kids in their lives (which is ironic when you come to think of it; as in real life it often feels like the reverse).  It's up to a few right-thinking kids to teach the grownups how to live.  This inside-out dynamic registers on every close-up of Willy Wonka's twitchy face: staring at the wrong moments, scarcely in control of his limbs, you can see the effects of Wonka's own unsympathetic upbringing.Director Tim Burton's incredible visual imagination seems to have melded with his own recent status as a dad here.  The cinematography features acid-trippy colors; the chocolate-factory sets have an overwhelming amount to look at.  There are subtle funny visual references to other Burton films:  when we first see Wonka, he is carrying a HUGE pair of shears (shades of Edward Scissorhands); when a team of bike-riding messengers streams out of the factory to post announcements, they are riding bright-red wacky PeeWee Herman-style bikes.Best of all are the Oompa Loompas (or, I should say, THE Oompa-Loompa), all played by a single actor (Deep Roy), who gamely dances through the Oompa-Loompa song in its various forms, including disco-style, Beatles-style, and a most delicious Queen parody.If you don't quite ""get"" all this, and were hoping for a more straightforward Disneyfied version of the tale (or miss the ""Candy Man"" song, which was certainly not Dahl's), you may not like this.  But my advice is don't press for explanations, just go and enjoy it - as Wonka himself says, ""Candy doesn't have to have a point - that's why it's CANDY.""",5,It hasn't GOT a point - that's why it's CANDY,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2739,"['just', 'need', 'get', 'old', 'version', 'movie', 'head', 'see', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'really', 'musical', 'not', 'exclusively', 'kid', 'movie', 'mind', 'best', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'ever', 'made', 'considerably', 'increased', 'assessment', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'whom', 'will', 'find', 'weird', 'were', 'hoping', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'wonderful', 'were', 'hoping', 'actual', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'written', 'original', 'author', 'Roald', 'Dahl.I', 'had', 'strange', 'experience', 'seeing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'two', 'days', 'later', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Johnny', 'turn', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'strangest', 'weirdest', 'most', 'engaging', 'performance', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'what', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'interesting', 'complex', 'subtle', 'new', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'movie', 'summer', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'worth', 'owning', 'rewatching', 'time', 'again.More', 'importantly', 'Depp', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'vision', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'novel', 'much', 'closer', 'Dahl', 'own', 'way', 'thinking', 'Dahl', 'novels', 'adults', 'are', 'incomprehensibly', 'self-involved', 'ignoring', 'malevolent', 'influence', 'kids', 'lives', 'ironic', 'when', 'come', 'think', 'real', 'life', 'often', 'reverse', 'up', 'few', 'right-thinking', 'kids', 'teach', 'grownups', 'how', 'live', 'inside-out', 'dynamic', 'registers', 'close-up', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'twitchy', 'face', 'staring', 'wrong', 'moments', 'scarcely', 'control', 'limbs', 'can', 'see', 'effects', 'Wonka', 'own', 'unsympathetic', 'upbringing.Director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'incredible', 'visual', 'imagination', 'have', 'melded', 'own', 'recent', 'status', 'dad', 'here', 'cinematography', 'acid-trippy', 'colors', 'chocolate-factory', 'sets', 'have', 'overwhelming', 'amount', 'look', 'are', 'subtle', 'funny', 'visual', 'references', 'other', 'Burton', 'films', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Wonka', 'carrying', 'HUGE', 'pair', 'shears', 'shades', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'when', 'team', 'bike-riding', 'messengers', 'streams', 'factory', 'post', 'announcements', 'are', 'riding', 'bright-red', 'wacky', 'PeeWee', 'Herman-style', 'bikes.Best', 'are', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'should', 'say', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'played', 'single', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'gamely', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'song', 'various', 'forms', 'including', 'disco-style', 'Beatles-style', 'most', 'delicious', 'Queen', 'parody.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'were', 'hoping', 'more', 'straightforward', 'Disneyfied', 'version', 'tale', 'miss', 'Candy', 'Man', 'song', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'Dahl', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'press', 'explanations', 'just', 'go', 'enjoy', 'Wonka', 'Candy', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'point', 'why', 'CANDY']",N/A

The movie opens setting up the story.  Charlie Bucket lives with his parents and four grandparents and they are beyond poor.  Their shack in the middle of town is bent and twisted and full of holes.  But they live in happiness and hope and entertain each other with stories of their past.  When news hits town that Willy Wonka is opening his factory to five children via a Golden Ticket, Charlie is hopeful he will get one.  His birthday candy bar doesn't contain one nor does the bar he buys with his grandpa's money.Meanwhile, the four other tickets are found by amusing charachitures of kids with the worst traits:  they are gluttoness, spoiled, selfish and rotten and none appreciate the fact they have a golden ticket.  Charlie finds some money on the ground and buys a candy bar.  Amazingly, this bar has a ticket in it.The five kids show up with one family member each at the factory.  Up to this point, Wonka is a mysterious character, being a part of the story but never being shown.  He makes his appearance after a ghastly puppet show introduces him at the factory.  Wonka, played by Depp, is a quirky, amusing guy with a childhood that haunts him to this day.  Some have likened his appearance to that of Michael Jackson.  That only comes through in spots. Wonka as played by Depp is an amusing unique character.The fun part of the movie begins when the kids enter the factory.  All the parts of the story are there, with each of the four bad kids meeting a temporary demise by giving into the worst of their character.  The candy looks delicious and the factory is beautiful to see.  I think kids will like the movie although my four year old was concerned when Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe from the Chocolate River.This movie is cute and fun for kids and adults, yet I don't think I laughed outloud once or came close to sharing any sympathy for Charlie or Willy Wonka.",4,"Cute and charming movie, nothing more",1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,2056,"['Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'take', 'classic', 'children', 'tale', 'Rohald', 'Dahl', 'update', 'dated', '1970', 'movie', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'movie', 'setting', 'up', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'parents', 'four', 'grandparents', 'are', 'poor', 'shack', 'middle', 'town', 'bent', 'twisted', 'full', 'holes', 'live', 'happiness', 'hope', 'entertain', 'other', 'stories', 'past', 'When', 'news', 'town', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'opening', 'factory', 'five', 'children', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'Charlie', 'hopeful', 'will', 'get', 'one', 'birthday', 'candy', 'bar', ""n't"", 'contain', 'one', 'bar', 'grandpa', 'money.Meanwhile', 'four', 'other', 'tickets', 'are', 'found', 'amusing', 'charachitures', 'kids', 'worst', 'traits', 'are', 'gluttoness', 'spoiled', 'selfish', 'rotten', 'none', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'have', 'golden', 'ticket', 'Charlie', 'money', 'ground', 'candy', 'bar', 'Amazingly', 'bar', 'ticket', 'it.The', 'five', 'kids', 'show', 'up', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'factory', 'Up', 'point', 'Wonka', 'mysterious', 'character', 'being', 'part', 'story', 'never', 'being', 'shown', 'appearance', 'ghastly', 'puppet', 'show', 'factory', 'Wonka', 'played', 'Depp', 'quirky', 'amusing', 'guy', 'childhood', 'day', 'have', 'likened', 'appearance', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'only', 'spots', 'Wonka', 'played', 'Depp', 'amusing', 'unique', 'character.The', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'kids', 'enter', 'factory', 'parts', 'story', 'are', 'there', 'four', 'bad', 'kids', 'meeting', 'temporary', 'demise', 'giving', 'worst', 'character', 'candy', 'delicious', 'factory', 'beautiful', 'see', 'think', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'concerned', 'when', 'Augustus', 'Gloop', 'got', 'sucked', 'up', 'pipe', 'Chocolate', 'River.This', 'movie', 'cute', 'fun', 'kids', 'adults', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'laughed', 'outloud', 'once', 'came', 'close', 'sharing', 'sympathy', 'Charlie', 'Willy', 'Wonka']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, I didn't think this one was completely horrible, it just left me feeling slightly empty.What I liked about this movie-The color was great, the fact that a slight touch of humor was present, how they showed what happened to the 'bad' children, the part where the plastic dolls were on fire, how the Oompa Loompas made for some entertainment with their song and danceWhat I didn't like-the pacing of the Golden Ticket winners, I thought that part went by too fast compared to the original, the boat scene (Gene Wilder's little speech and where he screams MADE that part), the way Veruca wasn't as horrible as she was in the other movie (her character was really convincing), I didn't get the same feel overall as I did for the characters in the first one, the drab coloring of Willy Wonka (I know why that was done, but it seemed strange to me), the fact that things were left out (the fizzy lifting drinks part), the fact that it was squirrels instead of the Golden Geese and Veruca going down the chute, the endingAs I type this out, I realize it wasn't supposed to be exactly the same, but I was really hoping for more than what I received when I watched this movie.

938830,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B000BB1MHS,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[3, 4]","If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the Gene Wilder (1971) version was a decent 3 star movie. This movie takes a different direction, but in my opinion, it was a change that did not work so well. The first thing you will notice is that the atmosphere is more gothic and spooky. (I didn't mind that.) Like the Gene Wilder version, Willy Wonka hides 5 golden tickets amongst the millions of Wonka Bars. People start buying Wonka bars by the case, and even though Charlie is poor, he manages to find one. (One thing that upset me is that Charlie's grandfather lacks the kindness that Jack Albertson brought to the role.) In this version, Charlie's grandfather is somewhat spooky. Augustus is a bit nastier and less likable than he was in the Gene Wilder version. Varuca and her father don't seem to have the charm they did in the former version. Though Violet (now a martial artist) and her mother have a nice mother daughter relationship. Mike Teevee was actually one of the few elements that improved in the transfer. Rather than just a compulsive television watcher, he is somewhat of a dark genius who calculates odds and makes his parents feel unintelligent. He only had to buy one candy bar. The 5  winners gather to the factory. You'll probably notice that the factory has a more sinister look to it than Gene Wilder's. To be sure, Gene Wilder was not quite a saint, but he did bring a nice side to Willy Wonka, and you'll probably notice that Johnny Depp is quite different. He is an ego maniac. He doesn't even want to know the names of the winners. (To be sure, they try to give Johnny Depp an excuse in that he had a bad relationship with his father, but his character still comes off repulsive.) The 4 accidents that await the 4 supposedly bad kids are quite similar to the Wilder version. But this time, there is some notable hypocrisy. The truth is, in this version, Willy Wonka is no better than the 4 kids who have a nasty accident. In fact, whether we want to admit this or not, Mike Teevee (a supposedly nasty kid)  is quite right when he says: ""Willy Wonka has the best inventions, but all he can think is candy.""  This makes perfect sense when we realize that Wonka (in this version especially) lacks something in the human deceny department. In the Wilder version, Charlie has the deceny to show concern over the other 4 children, but in this version, he and his supposedly nice grandfather take delight in that Charlie is the only one who did not have a mishap. To be sure, they do try to throw in a moral that family is most important. Again, it didn't bother me that this version took a different approach, but it did upset me that the redeeming elements of the Gene Wilder version seemed to be lost in the transfer process.

The new make of this movie is vastly different then the original. I was quite apprehensive about the Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka. I personally felt that there are much better choices (ie Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Michael Jackson). Johnny Depp's portrayal of wacky Willy Wonka does the trick. All of the acting in thsi movie is a little bit over the top but cartoonish as in true Tim Burton form. Willy Wonka's factory takes on a much more sinister place in the 2005 release. Willy Wonkas motives to find a child successor seem much more clear. Expect much more backstory and a lot less singing as well as the sickest cracked out oompa loompas you could imagine. I think you need to look at this movie not as a remake of the original movie but rather as another interpretation of the original book.

Once again he takes on a classic film and tries to give his own spin. And once again I find myself asking why? What is the point? Since I heard that this version of Charlie was to be closer to the book than the original Wilder film, I read the book. Boy this was just like Burton's Apes, so far off the mark it was laughable. Burton has done exeptional work in the past (Batman, A Nightmare Before Christmas) but when it comes to remakes, he's just on drugs.Now I'm not a fan of Johnny Depp. I readily admit that. However, inspite of the stupid hairdo, I was willing to give him a chance at the role of the twisted Wonka. Make no mistake about it. Willy Wonka was cracked. Crazy as a loon. However, he was crazy in a harmless sort of way. Kind of like your looney Aunt Sara who thinks that her cat is the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Mark Antony. Eccentric but not malicious. Wilder captured that perfectly in the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Choclate Factory. However, Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka comes off a sadistic and cruel. Almost creepy in a stalker or child molester sort of way.The original 1971 film had a visual style that was just magical to watch. The chocolate room just took your breath away. The new choclate room is drab and lifeless. There's no magic in it. No charm.The songs are not catchy and you don't find yourself humming them after the film is over. In fact, I couldn't recall any of the lyrics once the film was over.The kids aren't even charming. True, each of them gets what's coming to them, but at least in the original (and the book), they start off as charming and later show themselves to be brats. Well, perhaps not Veruca Salt. This group of kids, I couldn't wait for them to get bumped off (so to speak). They were just annoying.Burton really needs to stick with more original material. It's very, very clear that he doesn't have what it takes to make good remakes. Twice now he's done nothing but butcher beloved classics. Go back to things like Corpse Bride or A Nightmare Before Christmas. Stay away from this travesty of a film and above all, keep the kids away.

This movie stars Johnny Depp in the lead role, joined by a cast that includes some old and new names in Hollywood.What I enjoyed most about this movie was the visual effects. The scene with the squirrels checking the nuts; the scene with the young girl transforming into a blueberry; etc. are creative and fun. In addition to the visuals, there is plenty of music to keep viewers entertained, with a full soundtrack of songs written by Danny Elfman.Depp is great as the eccentric yet friendly Willy Wonka, and he exhibits a certain degree of charm that makes his character intriguing. The kids are also very good, and each one of the five children (the ones who win the right to tour the factory) has his/her own unique personality that is brought to his/her respective roles. The older people in the movie are ok, but not necessarily anything spectacular. Depp and the five children command most of the screen throughout the film, so you don't really notice the older people very much.This film is similar to the plot taken by the novel it is based on, but there are a few changes, like one would expect. One change that I didn't particularly care for was the subplot where Mr. Wonka has flashbacks to his childhood and later tries to patch up his relationship with his dad. I think the film would have been better if this was left out.Most people will think of this as an immature movie, but I liked it more and more as I watched.

938839,A2OTX4X3895YXT,B000BB1MHS,BuyCurious,"[4, 6]","It's been a long long LONG time since I've read the book, so naturally, my comparisons here are between the first movie and this newer version.I think I would give the original movie a B+ and this one a B. Like they say, if something ain't broke, don't fix it. Here's what's broken in the new version:1.) No subplot involving Mr. Slugworth trying to get an everlasting gobstopper out of the kids. This provided an epiphany at the end of the original that is sadly missed here. That subplot was great because it showed us that Charlie was indeed a good person, by the fact that he gave the gobstopper to Mr. Wonka even after being told he ""gets nothing!"".  This subplot wasn't in the book, so it's easy to forgive Burton for deviating here.2.) No fizzy lifting drink tangent for Charlie and his grandfather, which furthered the subplot above (again, this wasn't in the book either).3.) Introduction to Charlie, his family and his search for a golden ticket does seem to go on forever....Next thing we know, Augustus is getting sucked into the chocolate spaceship tube. The whole factory tour seems a bit rushed.4.) First oompa loompa song rocks, and you start to think that this is the point where the movie will start to crackle. However, subsequent oompa loompa songs aren't as good as the first and maybe two out of the four are catchy and/or funny. The casting of Deep Roy (whoever he is) as the oompa loompas, however, is definitely a positive.5.) Varuca's demise: Here it involved squirrels and ""bad nuts"" as opposed to golden geese and varuca being a ""bad egg"". 1971 idea was much funnier (not to mention the original song, ""I want today, I want tomorrow""), but the book apparently had squirrels--I am guessing the 1971 movie couldn't pull this off as far as the F/X department goes).6.) Johnny Depp looks WAY too young to be an aging chocolate factory owner seeking an ""heir"" to his chocolate throne.  He also reminds us WAY too much of a certain King of Pop.7.) Ending is a major let down (spoiler alert!), the way Charlie is unceremoniouly the winner just because he is the last of the four standing.

Hamilton,"[9, 13]","I know nobody likes to compare the two versions of Roald Dahl's book, but I am going to go ahead and do so, simply because when one considers the merits of the original version it seems a waste and a bore to remake it.There is one exception to this, and that is the costume, special effects and style - very Burton-esque, but that aside, it is doubtless superior to the amateurish 70s version. However, with this idea, we are speaking under the rule that dictates most of Hollywood these days, and that is that such matters are the make or break of a film. Being a fan of classic film, I nostalgically appreciate a time when this was not the case.The original version of this film gave us everything that mattered on the inside. The only thing that Burton did better was he made the ""look"" of the film more modern, something I do not consider important on the grand scale of what constitutes a memorable movie.I am aware that Burton stayed closer to the Dahl book, but what makes a good movie is very different from what works in a book, and I do not think we should be judging the two versions on which is a better replicate. Depp's performance was too Michael Jackson-esque for my liking. He was simply too ""weird"". Why does this make a difference? It does absolutely - Depp's Wonka was so preoccupied by details and effects of his own childhood and life that he gave the impression that he didn't care at all about Charlie or any of the other children. In the end, when Charlie takes Wonka into his home, our impressions are confirmed, that Wonka is indeed the main focus of the story. Ironic, since this version bears Charlie's name in the title versus the old one which used the name of Willy Wonka.The bottom line is, the charm and simplicity of the old version was derived from its focus on Charlie and his modesty, humility and hope. In this version the whole Slugworth story was omitted (the crux of the morality of the old version) and replaced by a story about dentistry that attempted to gather sympathy for Willy Wonka.Also, the Oompa Loompa songs were a disgraceful demonstration of the stupid humor of our times, and moments where there had been a song in the old version were treated with a nervous attempt to evoke laughter (eg Grandpa doing a quick dance when he got out of bed)- an impression of a ""how can we fill in the cracks?"" type of approach.Overall, the only merits of the new version are its special effects and modernity, which are not enough to tempt me to say that it ranks anywhere near its predecessor in terms of value. When will we get away from such a superficial approach to moviemaking?

Fortunately, this movie is a vast improvement.  The scenes before the entry into the factory were much better, showing the sad life of Charlie without being so morose.  The new version does a better job showing the nastiness of the four other children, and better tells what fates the four nasty children had.  Also, while I ocassionally amused at points with the 1971 version, I was constantly chuckling throughout this movie.  Also, I liked how they replace the 1971's subplot of ""Slugworth"" and instead replaced it by giving Wonka more depth by showing what led him to become the world's greatest candy maker.  I was afraid about the ending, but what I originally thought was the ending wasn't and instead I got an ending even more satisfying the the 1971's version.

I was going to go see ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events,"" which is another movie and book series that I strongly recommend. Anyway, I was very doubtful. Tim Burton is, and always was, my favorite movie director. I still remember the first of his films I ever saw: ""Edward Scissorhands."" Burton has an imagination all his own that I love so much, and can see in every one of his movies. However, I have seen ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (made by the same film studio: Warner Brothers) starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, and I have loved it for years. It was a ""golden"" movie to me. When I saw the first moments of the preview for this movie for the first time, I thought that Warner Brothers had finally decided to put Roald Dahl's book ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" on the big screen. I was wrong of course. Having seen ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" as many times as I have and loving it so much, I almost did not go to see this, until I learned who was directing it.I saw it, keeping an open-mind. I kept saying to myself: ""Tim Burton directed this"" as the movie began. Let me just say what happened to me. I was Wonka-fied all over again. I saw it (this movie) a total 5 times in theatres (which is a lot considering I cannot drive) and special ordered it, deluxe 2-disc edition, from Amazon.com. By special order, I mean that I payed the $3.99 extra to have it as one-day shipping (I am an Amazon.com prime member as I write this review).It is Wonka. Johnny Depp was great.

Lewis's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe (in which ive been fond of from the animated feature done by the makers of SESAME STREET - The Childrens Family Workshop) from Disney; and a pair coming in from director Tim Burton - CORPSE BRIDE, and this one, his own rendition of Roald Dahl's children's classic CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, since his flaky effort with the remake for PLANET OF THE APES.I've expected that this movie would fly off, but it runs with the feeling that it could've been even more better, kinda like his (Burton's) adaptation of SLEEPY HOLLOW and yet still I'd rather prefer that old fave 1972 rendition WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY which features Peter Ostrum in the role of Charlie, and commedian vet Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka himself- no matter how 'dated' it may seem.In this movie some better feel or emphasis from its characters should've sufficed that it could use some, but indeed it lacked just the right ingredient about that.However, the movie did have some good choreography about, and just as with the effect of the 1970's flick had on me- Ive stacked myself with some chocolate and anything chocolate so's not to  frustrate my appetite for from watching the film= there's a dialogue between Depp as Wonka and Mike Teevee- who said 'they expected that would come' as they are bumming around, that kind of pulled a lot of pun from Burton.Furthermore, I don't want to give a lot away - but there's a certain lotta further thing with Christopher Lee's appearance in this film- surprisingly.With what comes as Burton's cast of regulars as such, this time Danny Elfman as Burton commisioned him again- did a better turn of variation with his musical work for the movie this time, in whose score at times made Elfman provided for its vocals; that at times sounded nearly like my fave band- (hence mainly for the Umpa Loompas) SUPERTRAMP during the time they're still with Roger Hodgson.However none of them songs from the previous movie version appeared here, there's no Cheer Up Charlie, no I've got a golden Ticket, no Candyman- and most of all none of that SOng i NEVER REALLY liked...there is no Pure Imagination.RATE = 7 out 0f 10",3,GANDALF VS.

938852,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B000BB1MHS,Chris,"[7, 8]","Many people are really going to dislike this movie.  Many of them before they ever see the movie.  ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is such a beloved classic and many people never wanted to see the movie re-made.  But theres something that you have to take into account.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  Those two have collaborated four times and the three previous would spectacular, so you would have to believe that this movie would be great.  And staying true to their form, the movie is great.The story is the same as the previous film.  The owner of the greatest chocolate factory in the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), decides to let five children and a guardian of each to take a tour of his factory that has been closed to the public and to everyone for years.  They can take the tour if they find one of five golden tickets inside of the Wonka Bars.  Also one lucky kid will win a special prize.  So obviously, people go nuts trying to find these golden tickets by buying just about every Wonka Bar in sight.  Four of the golden tickets are found by fairly wealthy, spoiled kids and then the last one is found by sweet, very poor Charlie Buckett.  The kids are given a tour of the chocolate factory by Willy Wonka himself.  While in the factory, kids that are greedy, fat, cocky and too smart start disappearing out of the factory due to their behavior.  Kind of like what happens in Se7en.  The last kid left with Willy Wonka is Charlie and he wins the grand prize, The Chocolate Factory.  Did I really need to write all of that?First thing that people will judge is Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka compared to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  The thing that you will have to understand is that they are portraying two different Willy Wonka's.  Wilder's was sweet, charming and caring of the children.  Depp's is very cocky, paranoid and socially inept.  So to judge one character to another is like comparing apples and oranges.  My opinion is that Johnny Depp does a fantastic job with the character.  I like the darker Willy Wonka that he plays and honestly, who could play this character better than Johnny Depp?  Also who could direct this film better than Tim Burton.  One of the songs from the original has a line that says ""in a world of pure imagination.""  Is there any director with a greater imagination than Burton?  The colors, the odd shapes, the acting, along with Danny Elfman's creepy score all screams Tim Burton's classic film style.  The rest of the cast does a good job, but this movie is the Willy Wonka Show.So would I recommend this movie?  Definitely!  Is it better than the original?  I liked this movies darker setting, but it just matters on what your movie taste is.  So I would say that if you don't like Tim Burton movies, then don't see this movie.  If you like Tim Burton's style, then this is the film for you.",5,A Classic Burton Film,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,2850,"['Many', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'dislike', 'movie', 'Many', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'beloved', 'classic', 'many', 'people', 'never', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 're-made', 'something', 'have', 'take', 'account', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'two', 'have', 'collaborated', 'four', 'times', 'three', 'previous', 'would', 'spectacular', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'staying', 'true', 'form', 'movie', 'great.The', 'story', 'same', 'previous', 'film', 'owner', 'greatest', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'world', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'let', 'five', 'children', 'guardian', 'take', 'tour', 'factory', 'been', 'closed', 'public', 'everyone', 'years', 'can', 'take', 'tour', 'find', 'one', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'Wonka', 'Bars', 'Also', 'one', 'lucky', 'kid', 'will', 'win', 'special', 'prize', 'So', 'obviously', 'people', 'go', 'nuts', 'trying', 'find', 'golden', 'tickets', 'buying', 'just', 'about', 'Wonka', 'Bar', 'sight', 'Four', 'golden', 'tickets', 'are', 'found', 'fairly', 'wealthy', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'then', 'last', 'one', 'found', 'sweet', 'very', 'poor', 'Charlie', 'Buckett', 'kids', 'are', 'given', 'tour', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'kids', 'are', 'greedy', 'fat', 'cocky', 'too', 'smart', 'start', 'disappearing', 'factory', 'due', 'behavior', 'Kind', 'what', 'Se7en', 'last', 'kid', 'left', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Charlie', 'grand', 'prize', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Did', 'really', 'need', 'write', 'First', 'thing', 'people', 'will', 'judge', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'compared', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'thing', 'will', 'have', 'understand', 'are', 'portraying', 'two', 'different', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Wilder', 'was', 'sweet', 'charming', 'caring', 'children', 'Depp', 'very', 'cocky', 'paranoid', 'socially', 'inept', 'So', 'judge', 'one', 'character', 'comparing', 'apples', 'oranges', 'opinion', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fantastic', 'job', 'character', 'darker', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'honestly', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'character', 'better', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Also', 'who', 'could', 'direct', 'film', 'better', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'One', 'songs', 'original', 'line', 'world', 'pure', 'imagination', 'director', 'greater', 'imagination', 'Burton', 'colors', 'odd', 'shapes', 'acting', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'creepy', 'score', 'screams', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'classic', 'film', 'style', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Show.So', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'better', 'original', 'liked', 'movies', 'darker', 'setting', 'just', 'matters', 'what', 'movie', 'taste', 'would', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'like', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'style', 'then', 'film']",N/A
938853,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000BB1MHS,Chris Kennison,"[3, 6]","I wanted to give this 2 stars but there were SOME things I liked about it.This movie has received so much praise since it came out and I'm a little curious about it. Why? Is it because the movies that were made this year were mostly bad and mostly remakes and unoriginal. Probably.The truth is, in my opinion, that the movie is basically the same as the original with a few exception. This one is more true to the book... including the scene about where the Oompa Loompa's came from and how they came to be workers at Wonkas factory and showing more of the Wonka and Charlie relationship after the day long adventure in the chocolate factory. We get to meet Wonka's father and find out why he became so obsessed with candy. This is why I liked the movie.I didn't like the movie because it was the same as the original except longer... with the added scenes. Everything played out the same... like a horror movie... one kid down... two kids down... three kids down... etc. etc. etc.The original Willie Wonka was a classic and Gene Wilder played the character with sadness, madness, wildness, sass, sarcasm and mystery. Johnny Depp didn't really do any of this... maybe sadness and then he added creepiness. I think that was the main thing I missed from the original. You loved Gene Wilder's Wonka because he was funny and sarcastic and quick-witted. Johnny Depp's Wonka was like... well... sort of sarcastic, but creepy and spoke pretty much the exact same way that Depp did in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS... with a mousy squeaky voice.I missed Gene Wilder's sarcastic and unenthusiastic, ""oh no. what are we gonna do? How will we ever go on without him?"" as Augustus Gloop tried to swim in his river of chocolate.I also missed the Oompa Loompa song. Wow. That song was such a fixture in my memory. ""Oompa Loompa... oompadeedoo..."" The new songs...??? I couldn't remember them right now if you payed me. Sorry Danny Elfman. You're fantastic... but you can't mess with a classic.Charlie and the Chocolate factory in a lot of ways is better than the original, but the original was so perfect in so many ways... it will always be the better movie to me. Had the original been more fairy tale and included the missing scenes that Charlie and the Chocolate factory included... there would have been no need to remake it......I got another riddle for you... Why do they remake classics like this... when they can remake one of the many potentially good movies that were a boo hiss?",3,I LOVE BURTON...

938856,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B000BB1MHS,Classic Movie watcher,"[3, 4]","By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey.The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the ""sophisticated"" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes.

If I'd never seen the original as a child I'm sure I would think this is 'cool', but should Wonka be 'cool'? Can't he be warm, endearing, mysterious, and not so threatening? That's probably my largest contention with this work. Depp's portrayal is so cold and callous that it seems as though his character hates children. If all Wonka's work is just to spite his father then perhaps he does, and that's an interesting side to the story but it doesn't make me feel closer to the character- it feels more like seeing a dangerous animal in a glass jar. This Wonka reminds me of a Gothic Praying mantis. Do I really want to buy chocolate from this man?It's apparent Burton is a fan of the original (why remake anything unless you love the original?), but he is such a creative guy that I have to ask why he chose to tackle this project? Why not write his own classic? Was this a studio decision? I like many Burton projects but this one just seems an unnecessary one.This version isn't the worst thing ever to come out of Hollywood (I think that credit might go to ""Made of Honor"" with ""27 Dresses"" running a close second), but it's just not my taste.

938859,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BB1MHS,"Cloud ""...""","[4, 5]","One thing you can always count on when you get a Tim Burton film is that it'll look visually great. Art direction and production design is always top-notch(except for Planet of the Apes where only the costumes looked good). However, some of them seem to be lacking. Planet of the Apes was boring half the time and had an incredibly stupid ending. Sleepy Hollow looked great but it had a dumb storyline and dialogue choices. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looked great but halfway through I was wondering if there was a point to the craziness.The most famous chocolate factory in the world is run by reclusive Willy Wonka. One day he announces something surprising: 5 tickets will be inside random chocolate bars. The children who find them gets a tour of the factory. It's been used as a parody for the Slurm Factory in Futurama and the Pawtucket Brewery in Family Guy. This leads them into the factory only each kid ends up receiving a little misfortune until the last one gets something great.One watches the film and is wowed by the sets and the effects used. If you're into this kind of thing, you'll sure find it inventive. My favorite is the Nut Sorting Room where a group of heavily-trained squirrels end up sorting different nuts and putting them in chutes. Another has Oompa-Loompas(a dimnuitive race Willy hired to work the factory) firing fireworks just for the hell of it.One problem I had with the film is how basic everything is. Each kid is your typical one-note persona: the spoiled rich girl, the know-it-all punk, the fat boy and so on. And of course Charlie's soooo good and noble we just know he's going to win the big prize by default. Their fates are actually never dealt with once they come out of the factory. It's like ""okay kid, you're a blue flexible kid, have fun"" without even returning them to normal. And more than once I asked myself if there's even a plot. 5 kids tour a factory and gets a little snafu. That's it.In terms of the look, it's easily one of Tim Burton's most colorful but as a film it's way down there.",3,Looked great but it didn't play that great,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,2052,"['One', 'thing', 'can', 'always', 'count', 'when', 'get', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', ""'ll"", 'look', 'visually', 'great', 'Art', 'direction', 'production', 'design', 'always', 'top-notch', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'where', 'only', 'costumes', 'looked', 'good', 'However', 'seem', 'be', 'lacking', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'boring', 'time', 'had', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'ending', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'looked', 'great', 'had', 'dumb', 'storyline', 'dialogue', 'choices', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'looked', 'great', 'halfway', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'point', 'craziness.The', 'most', 'famous', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'world', 'run', 'reclusive', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'One', 'day', 'something', 'surprising', '5', 'tickets', 'will', 'be', 'inside', 'random', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'tour', 'factory', 'been', 'used', 'parody', 'Slurm', 'Factory', 'Futurama', 'Pawtucket', 'Brewery', 'Family', 'Guy', 'factory', 'only', 'kid', 'up', 'receiving', 'little', 'misfortune', 'last', 'one', 'something', 'great.One', 'film', 'wowed', 'sets', 'effects', 'used', ""'re"", 'kind', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'sure', 'find', 'inventive', 'favorite', 'Nut', 'Sorting', 'Room', 'where', 'group', 'heavily-trained', 'squirrels', 'end', 'up', 'sorting', 'different', 'nuts', 'putting', 'chutes', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'dimnuitive', 'race', 'Willy', 'hired', 'work', 'factory', 'firing', 'fireworks', 'just', 'hell', 'it.One', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'how', 'basic', 'everything', 'kid', 'typical', 'one-note', 'persona', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'girl', 'know-it-all', 'punk', 'fat', 'boy', 'so', 'course', 'Charlie', 'soooo', 'good', 'noble', 'just', 'know', 'going', 'win', 'big', 'prize', 'default', 'fates', 'are', 'actually', 'never', 'dealt', 'once', 'come', 'factory', 'okay', 'kid', ""'re"", 'blue', 'flexible', 'kid', 'have', 'fun', 'even', 'returning', 'normal', 'more', 'once', 'asked', 'even', 'plot', '5', 'kids', 'tour', 'factory', 'little', 'snafu', 'it.In', 'terms', 'look', 'easily', 'one', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'most', 'colorful', 'film', 'way', 'there']",N/A

And though children and adults will like it for different reasons, it's colorful and enduring. Not so with CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Even though I'm a dedicated Depp fan, this movie is only mildly entertaining and the squirrels manage to steal the show. Perhaps most disappointing is the dreadful music and the muted colors. It isn't magical...it's dysfunctional. Gene Wilder, though wary of children in general, is always in charge, and always entertaining. (One reviewer said ""cuddly"".) Depp is simply an Edward Scissorhands in charge of a chocolate factory. Burton does his best to add humor to the film, but in the end one usually only remembers the squirrels and the children, not Depp. Sadly, this film is lacking in the very things it should have been rich in. It's like Jan de Bont and THE HAUNTING (1999). Why pick a director who knows nothing about psychological horror to recreate a thriller where psychological horror is at the very heart and soul of the story? In this case, think of Don Knotts as Achilles in about the same way as Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. The humor doesn't work because the film is, at its core, humorless.The 1971 film is so good in so many ways that it's amazing they thought to remake it.

The morals are less stressed, and more emphasis is on the idea of a good decent ""family"" presence, missing from many modern-day films now.  I really like Tim Burton's idea for the story, from the looks of the city, the Buckets' house, the factory, and even a few local jokes...like the over zealous Majorette!  Ha ha!  as an ex-band director I found that histerical!  PLUS they were from the South!  Depp, did a better job than many think.  You really have to watch his EXPRESSIONS, this is wherein lies the true nature of this version's character for Willy Wonka!  He's a kid at heart, not the like shrewd business man from 1971, and just as mischevious as the Oompa Loompas!It's not a musical, but the oompa-loompa's (who can't speak a word of English) can sing English QUITE well.  Many good underlying jokes, you just have to look beyond the story!  Pink sheep... anyone notice there were NO females in the group by that time of the tour?  The original Mike TV mumbled, but this one does not!  And Wonka made a point to yell at him for mumbling when Mike seemed to know.... TOO MUCH.  Mike TV's ""sin"" in this version wasn't really TV, nor even violence, but too much LOGIC.  That was his flaw in this film.  Not many people recognize that.  Something about this movie from the realism of the Wonka character... the overall look, the music (which I think is the best attribute to the movie), and using the best techonologoy to replicate Deep Roy as the oompa loompas!  (Lucas should have done this for his clones!)  The ending has a pretty cool twist to it.  After watching the full movie a few times, the pacing seems fine with the few flashbacks which helps the audience fill in the gaps for Wonka's character.There are many movies being parodied throughout this whole movie, and even bands, and a few books.  This 2 DVD set's major draw-in is the extras and how the movie was made.  Even if you don't watch this version, at least see how it was made. They used more old ""fashioned effects"" than you realize.  The over-all style is a nice mix of Suess & Burton.  Overall it's already a classic in my book, and goes more by the book than the original movie... and that's a good move in my opinion.  You're not left with any idea that the kids die (because Gene-Wonka was also hard to trust despite his last-minute mention that ""all the kids will be back to their old miserable little selves but maybe a little wiser...""), like the original gave me. The original movie (which I did like) also gave me nightmares as a kid back then.  This one does not (I'm not a kid anymore either), but it somehow it tends to lessen the morals, which my kids try to emulate the ""bad kids"" on occassion rather than Charlie.

938865,AC3CNRJT2Y7FL,B000BB1MHS,"C. Petersen ""nicegirl90247""","[1, 1]","I don't understand how anyone can say this movie was bad.  I read many reviews before going to see this with my six-year old daughter (who loved it and agrees that it is better), and I was prepared to possibly prefer the first one. WRONG! I absoloutely LOVED this movie from beginning to end. Johnny Depp did a fantastic job as the eccentric Willy Wonka, and he had the funniest lines.""Good Morning Starshine. The earth says ""Hello."" Gene Wilder played it more straight and in comparison was BORING! OK, so maybe Depp's was a bit effemanate and odd(Which is the only two reasons I can see that he is being compared to Michael Jackson.) Other than that, the comparison is ridiculous. I have to agree with other reviewers that it was obvious that he didn't like children which everyone knows is not the case with Jackson. It's not like he opened his factory every day for children to play in. Even when he did open it, it was out of a particular need (to find an heir) and he was very specific about what they were allowed to touch. One thing that always bothered me about the original is that it was never explained why Wonka was so odd and hostile towards the children (other than the fact that most of them were brats). So the insights into his childhood and young adulthood adventures through the flashbacks were one of the main things I liked about this version. It also made sense that he had that strange gray pallor to his skin because he was such a recluse and didn't get any sun (another reason for the Jackson thing perhaps?) Not that Jackson doesn't get out, but he is rather pale. (Yes, I know about the skin bleaching). I do wish they hadn't put so much make-up on him. (Depp, I mean.) He didn't talk like Michael Jackson at all. He sounded like Carol Channing a lot, though. I thought this was odd, but perhaps intentional. Maybe he just didn't know how to talk to children, so he put on this false high-pitch voice. It was especially noticable when he was nervous.(That nervous laugh). That was also the reason that he used cue cards. C'mon people, he lived  with tiny orange men for 20 years. I think anyone would be a little odd under those circumstances. And look at his childhood. His father, in particular. I won't say anything more for those that haven't seen it. See it, and you'll know what I mean. No wonder he had trouble with the word ""parent.""I also have to add, because nobody else mentioned it(I don't think.) that there is no Slugworth in this movie. That may dissapoint some people, but he was not neccesary to the plot. The children were rotten and greedy already (except for Charlie of course) and didn't need someone to egg them on to be even more so. In my opinion, this character was used for the original movie so that it was be more acceptable for Charlie and Grandpa Joe to do something naughty (fizzy lifting drinks) and then redeem himself later by being the only one to give up his everlasting gobstopper.Slugworth is mentioned in the book only as one of the candy-maker spies who stole his ideas. Also, I thought that Wonka was much too harsh on Charlie when he shouted at him and Grandpa Joe like he did. Obviously, he was upset that the day was wasted, but children might not realize that and think he was just being mean. And how did he know what Charlie and Grandpa did? He was in the other room showing the kids the geese that laid chocolate eggs. That made him mysterious I guess, but I think too confusing for kids. Slugworth worked for Wonka anyway, which also doesn't make sense. Why did he trust him? He was free to leave the factory. How did he know that he wouldn't try to steal his ideas? Depp's Wonka was a lot more cautious and followed Dahl's wonderful book almost exactly. Even his clothes and body type look like the illustrations. I also have to add, that I didn't miss the corny singing as much as I thought I would after reading it was not a musical. The oompa loompa's and their songs were far better than the first movie. The words for most of the songs were taken from the book(read it, and see) and were a lot funnier and less tedious  than that annoying ""OOMPA LOOMPA DOOPITY DO"". It was just the same tune over and over. While this version, each song was unique and I found myself looking forward to each new song and dance number. They were incredibly entertaining. This movie, with today's technology, really brought Dahl's imagination to life and did the story more justice. If you only know the story from this movie and/or the original version, do yourself and your kids a favor and READ THE BOOK. Then, see both movies and then you'll understand why this new version is the best. You may also want to read ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"". A sequel book that would make a great sequel movie. With Depp and the rest of the cast of course. Great casting, by the way. Oh, one more thing I have to add: Wonka didn't like children with one exception of course:Charlie. In the end Charlie was the only one he trusted and they became best friends. I think Charlie made a real difference in his life and brought him out of his shell. So this movie has a lot to say (if you are paying attention) about kindness and not being too quick to judge others. Charlie was the only one who cared enough about Wonka to ask him about his life and he asked intelligent questions. He is an excellent role model for children. Freddie Highmore should be proud. He really brought the character to life. In short, my family and I were drawn into this movie from the beginning and were never bored. I never saw my daughter sit so still in a theater before. I think that says a lot.",5,The best version by far.

Those expectations were high, at least in the visuals department. I expected a wild, colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed with this DVD.It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing ""Charlie."" I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nice/wholesome as one in ""Willy Wonka"" but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently, as did the ""brat"" kids.A different feature of this version, as opposed to the 1970 original, was that here the Oompa-Loompas were all played by just one person, a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting ""features"" on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.Johnny Depp, meanwhile, ""did"" what he always does - do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them.Since it has 35 years of technology and computer work knowledge that the original wasn't able to have, this re-make is stunning on DVD.

938868,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000BB1MHS,Cubist,"[2, 3]","When Johnny Depp and Tim Burton team up to do a movie the results are usually fantastic: Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and to a lesser degree Sleepy Hollow. However, since Planet of the Apes, Burton's films have been missing that certain personal touch - the fascination with darkness mixed with a touch of wonderment - that used to make them so good. Fans keep hoping that his next movie will be a return to form but it hasn't happened yet. So, anticipation was high for Burton's latest, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Depp as none other than Willy Wonka. If anybody could successfully tap into Dahl's sensibilities it would be Burton, but could he equal Gene Wilder's memorable and much beloved take in 1971?Depp plays Wonka like a funky mix of the optimistic Ed Wood, the arrested development of Andy Kaufman and the flash of a kids show host. It's a typically off-kilter performance by Depp who proves that his recent foray into big budget movies (Pirates of the Caribbean) hasn't ruined his ability to create memorable characters. Depp's Wonka doesn't really like the kids with the exception of Charlie and barely conceals his contempt for them and this comes out in funny asides or amusing facial expressions from the rubber-faced Depp. There are also hints of deep regret and a damaged psyche as the film progresses and Wonka's troubled past is fleshed out (this is the major point where the film deviates from the book) explaining his motivations. As he did in Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp plays it broad creating his own Wonka that isn't better or worse than Wilder's - just different.Burton wisely doesn't try to remake the Wilder film but goes back to Dahl's book. This is the first film since Sleepy Hollow to feel like a truly authentic Tim Burton film as he really connects with the material in a big way. It's almost as if reconnecting with Depp on this film (and Corpse Bride) has helped the filmmaker find his way back to what made his films so interesting in the first place. Let's hope that this is the beginning of a move back to more personal films like Ed Wood and a distancing of director-for-hire projects like Apes and Big Fish.Included is the obligatory theatrical trailer.""Attack of the Squirrels"" shows how an animal wrangler trained the squirrels for a scene in the movie. For most of the squirrels, it took 2,000 repetitions to learn a specific task.""Fantastic Mr. Dahl"" takes a look at author Roald Dahl with vintage archival footage of the man and testimony from his friends, family and collaborators.""Becoming Oompa-Loompa"" examines how they took actor Deep Roy and transformed him into an army of Oompa-Loompas thanks to CGI. Of all the actors, he had to work the hardest playing so many different roles that was then augmented by special effects.""Making the Mix"" is a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, including the origins of the project, the changes they made from the book, the casting process (including the kids), Danny Elfman's score and how he approached such a daunting task, costume and production design and finally the special effects. Thankfully, Burton relied as much on practical sets and miniatures as possible with the CGI done only to compliment the real sets.Also included are several interactive games.""Oompa-Loompa Dance"" takes you through two dances from the movie and then you have to try and keep an Oompa-Loompa dancing by following the corresponding moves.In ""The Bad Nut"" you have to help Wonka's squirrels sort good and bad nuts with only three tries to get it right.""The Inventing Machine"" allows you to make your own candy and test it on an Oompa-Loompa.Finally, there is the ""Search for the Golden Ticket"" which allows you to help the five children find their respective ticket through a series of games.",5,Tim Burton's return to form!,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,3874,"['When', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'team', 'up', 'do', 'movie', 'results', 'are', 'usually', 'fantastic', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'However', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Burton', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'certain', 'personal', 'touch', 'fascination', 'darkness', 'mixed', 'touch', 'wonderment', 'used', 'make', 'so', 'good', 'Fans', 'keep', 'hoping', 'next', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'return', 'form', ""n't"", 'happened', 'yet', 'So', 'anticipation', 'was', 'high', 'Burton', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'classic', 'children', 'novel', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'starring', 'Depp', 'none', 'other', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'anybody', 'could', 'successfully', 'tap', 'Dahl', 'sensibilities', 'would', 'be', 'Burton', 'could', 'equal', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'memorable', 'much', 'beloved', 'take', '1971', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'funky', 'mix', 'optimistic', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'arrested', 'development', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'flash', 'kids', 'show', 'host', 'typically', 'off-kilter', 'performance', 'Depp', 'who', 'recent', 'foray', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', ""n't"", 'ruined', 'ability', 'create', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Depp', 'Wonka', ""n't"", 'really', 'kids', 'exception', 'Charlie', 'barely', 'conceals', 'contempt', 'out', 'funny', 'asides', 'amusing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'rubber-faced', 'Depp', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'deep', 'regret', 'damaged', 'psyche', 'film', 'progresses', 'Wonka', 'troubled', 'past', 'fleshed', 'out', 'major', 'point', 'where', 'film', 'book', 'explaining', 'motivations', 'did', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Depp', 'broad', 'creating', 'own', 'Wonka', ""n't"", 'better', 'worse', 'Wilder', 'just', 'different.Burton', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'try', 'remake', 'Wilder', 'film', 'back', 'Dahl', 'book', 'first', 'film', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'feel', 'truly', 'authentic', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'really', 'material', 'big', 'way', 'almost', 'reconnecting', 'Depp', 'film', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'helped', 'filmmaker', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'what', 'made', 'films', 'so', 'interesting', 'first', 'place', 'Let', 'hope', 'beginning', 'move', 'back', 'more', 'personal', 'films', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'distancing', 'director-for-hire', 'projects', 'Apes', 'Big', 'Fish.Included', 'obligatory', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Attack', 'Squirrels', 'how', 'animal', 'wrangler', 'trained', 'squirrels', 'scene', 'movie', 'most', 'squirrels', 'took', '2,000', 'repetitions', 'learn', 'specific', 'task', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Dahl', 'look', 'author', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'vintage', 'archival', 'footage', 'man', 'testimony', 'friends', 'family', 'collaborators', 'Becoming', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'how', 'took', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'transformed', 'army', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'thanks', 'CGI', 'actors', 'had', 'work', 'hardest', 'playing', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'roles', 'was', 'then', 'augmented', 'special', 'effects', 'Making', 'Mix', 'collection', 'featurettes', 'explore', 'various', 'aspects', 'movie', 'including', 'origins', 'project', 'changes', 'made', 'book', 'casting', 'process', 'including', 'kids', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'how', 'approached', 'daunting', 'task', 'costume', 'production', 'design', 'finally', 'special', 'effects', 'Thankfully', 'Burton', 'relied', 'much', 'practical', 'sets', 'miniatures', 'possible', 'CGI', 'done', 'only', 'compliment', 'real', 'sets.Also', 'included', 'are', 'several', 'interactive', 'games', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'Dance', 'two', 'dances', 'movie', 'then', 'have', 'try', 'keep', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'dancing', 'following', 'corresponding', 'moves.In', 'Bad', 'Nut', 'have', 'help', 'Wonka', 'squirrels', 'sort', 'good', 'bad', 'nuts', 'only', 'three', 'tries', 'get', 'right', 'Inventing', 'Machine', 'make', 'own', 'candy', 'test', 'Oompa-Loompa.Finally', 'Search', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'help', 'five', 'children', 'find', 'respective', 'ticket', 'series', 'games']",N/A

I thought that it was beautifully shot, complettly draws you into each frame, and although I had read numerous reviews that mentioned Depps performance to be 'over the top' and very 'jackson-ish' I thought he was perfect.  He really made the film enjoyable.  He may have been a little creepy and or corny at times, but thats what made it so great.  Johnny Depp is one of those great entertainers, like Crowe, who is never the same.  They completly morph into a charactor and thats what Depp did here.  Another rising star is young Freddie Highmore who played Charlie.  He is the next Haley-Joel Osmand I guerenty it.  Maybe this time the kid won't dissapear after he hits puberty.

938870,A169I83JL8QJGN,B000BB1MHS,Daniel A Moir,"[3, 7]","There's a reason that the 1970s Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has endured for so long as a beloved classic despite being a box office bomb. The fact of the matter is that the film had a script written by the author of the book, and it had a story that had heart, performances that were memorable, fun songs, deep, well-developed characters, and best of all a fantastic performance by Gene Wilder.  Sure there are parts where it strayed from the book, but in all it stayed as true as possible with the technology available at the time.This remake by the usually great Tim Burton, and the usually amazing Johnny Depp did not capture the magic of the original. Rather than spending time developing the characters the film seems like it's the classic tale in fast forward. They rush through the finding of the Golden Tickets; there's lack of consumer frenzy that was well portrayed in the original, and it is simply glanced over here. I thought that it was possible that Tim Burton was just eager to show the world the wonders of the chocolate factory, however, where the original took its time getting people acquainted with Willy Wonka, and the factory, and everyone else, the fast forward momentum of the remake doesn't slow once inside the factory, in fact it gets worse. There's still so much of the story that Burton missed out on in his rush to create a hurried popcorn flick with little to no heart. I left the theater wanting to like this movie, but Depp wasn't Wily Wonka, he was a great character, but he wasn't Wonka. Wilder is still Wonka, true to the book, and true to form. Depp's performance came off more like an interpretation of Michael Jackson meets Captain Kangaroo meets Mr. Rogers. Anyone but Wily Wonka.I also did not appreciate Burton's boasting about how much more like the book this movie would be when only a few things stood out, (though it has been a long time since I read the book) Veruca's disposal at the hands of squirrels rather than Golden Geese, and Charlie's not getting himself into trouble as well. There were other little things too, but all in all, you get the sense that the original wasn't too far off base after all. After all the original was only guilty of the sin of omission, mostly, and what content they added in its place helped make a deeper, more enjoyable story. This one omits things, and adds a very unintuitive back-story for Wonka that is neither necessary, nor does it help the classic tale in any way.Too much time was spent on flash, and not enough on substance. It feels like the film itself has a short attention span, and I walked out of the theater wanting so badly to like this one... I just can't justify it. This was another unnecessary remake, which has done nothing to help the story in any way, or do much else besides create a mildly entertaining visual treat for the audience. It would have been nice to have more depth, and with Burton's track record, it's highly disappointing that it didn't.In truth you cannot out do the original author's vision for a movie. As a writer myself I can attest that the book version of my stories would be very different from the movie. What works in books don't always work in movies, and I think that Burton's challenge to the original film here doesn't need to be met. This remake is too weak to stand the test of time. Nothing about it is anywhere near as memorable or as enduring as the original Wily Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, nor is it as magical, and heart filled as the book.",3,Little more than eye candy (Pardon the pun),1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,3503,"['reason', '1970s', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'endured', 'so', 'long', 'beloved', 'classic', 'being', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'fact', 'matter', 'film', 'had', 'script', 'written', 'author', 'book', 'had', 'story', 'had', 'heart', 'performances', 'were', 'memorable', 'fun', 'songs', 'deep', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'best', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Sure', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'strayed', 'book', 'stayed', 'as', 'true', 'possible', 'technology', 'available', 'time.This', 'remake', 'usually', 'great', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'usually', 'amazing', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'magic', 'original', 'Rather', 'spending', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'film', 'classic', 'tale', 'fast', 'forward', 'rush', 'finding', 'Golden', 'Tickets', 'lack', 'consumer', 'frenzy', 'was', 'well', 'portrayed', 'original', 'simply', 'glanced', 'here', 'thought', 'was', 'possible', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'just', 'eager', 'show', 'world', 'wonders', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'however', 'where', 'original', 'took', 'time', 'getting', 'people', 'acquainted', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'everyone', 'else', 'fast', 'forward', 'momentum', 'remake', ""n't"", 'slow', 'once', 'factory', 'fact', 'worse', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'Burton', 'missed', 'out', 'rush', 'create', 'hurried', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'little', 'heart', 'left', 'theater', 'wanting', 'like', 'movie', 'Depp', 'was', ""n't"", 'Wily', 'Wonka', 'was', 'great', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'Wonka', 'Wilder', 'still', 'Wonka', 'true', 'book', 'true', 'form', 'Depp', 'performance', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'interpretation', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'meets', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'Anyone', 'Wily', 'Wonka.I', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'Burton', 'boasting', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'only', 'few', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'read', 'book', 'Veruca', 'disposal', 'hands', 'squirrels', 'rather', 'Golden', 'Geese', 'Charlie', 'not', 'getting', 'trouble', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'other', 'little', 'things', 'too', 'get', 'sense', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'base', 'original', 'was', 'only', 'guilty', 'sin', 'omission', 'mostly', 'what', 'content', 'added', 'place', 'helped', 'make', 'deeper', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'one', 'things', 'very', 'unintuitive', 'back-story', 'Wonka', 'necessary', 'help', 'classic', 'tale', 'way.Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'flash', 'not', 'enough', 'substance', 'film', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'walked', 'theater', 'wanting', 'so', 'badly', 'like', 'one', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'remake', 'done', 'nothing', 'help', 'story', 'way', 'do', 'much', 'else', 'create', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'visual', 'treat', 'audience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'more', 'depth', 'Burton', 'track', 'record', 'highly', 'disappointing', 'can', 'not', 'out', 'do', 'original', 'author', 'vision', 'movie', 'writer', 'can', 'attest', 'book', 'version', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'What', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'movies', 'think', 'Burton', 'challenge', 'original', 'film', 'here', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'met', 'remake', 'too', 'weak', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'Nothing', 'anywhere', 'near', 'memorable', 'as', 'enduring', 'original', 'Wily', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'magical', 'heart', 'filled', 'book']",N/A

Hamlow,"[3, 5]","Immediately after watching Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, I quickly read the book, found to my amazement a 90% movie/book correlation, and then rewatched the first movie starring Gene Wilder.  The winner is Tim Burton's version, and is it a sweet treat!Those who have either read Roald Dahl's book or seen the Gene Wilder version will know of the mad search for five golden tickets hidden in chocolateer Willy Wonka's Wonka Bars, the prize being a guided tour given to a child and one parent, and other prizes.  Charlie Bucket lives with his poverty-ridden family in a cramped decrepit house in the city with both his parents and both sets of grandparents, his elders sharing the same bed, one couple facing each other.  Besides listening to Grandpa Joe's stories, his sole bright time of the year is getting a Wonka bar for his birthday.He is lucky enough to be one of the five winners and takes his Grandpa Joe with himVariations include added material, such as Willy Wonka's life as a child, which sends him into a bit of a daze whenever he remembers it, most of it due to Charlie's questions.  In flashbacks, one witnesses Willy in an oppressive braces contraption, installed by his severe anti-sweets dentist father (Christopher Lee) that resembles a torture device rather than something to straighten teeth.Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka, down to the costume, dreamy smile, childish imagination-in other words, a lovable eccentric.  Despite the sort of high-pitched voice, pale face, and gloved hands, the comparisons to Michael Jackson are unjustified.  He has some funny lines, when introducing the candy meadow.  ""Everything in there is edible, including me.  But that's called cannibalism and is frowned upon.""Per the book, both of Charlie's parents are alive.  And instead of the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse songs, two of the songs from the book are used;  the ones the Oompa Loompas use after Augustus is sent up the strawberry fudge factory is close to if not identical to the song in the book.  And yes, Veruca's disposal is by a hoard of trained squirrels in charge of cracking walnuts and not for desiring a golden egg.  This leads to the funniest line and double-entendre in the film, shouted by Wonka to Veruca:  ""Don't touch that squirrel's nuts!""  And David Kelly is perfect as Grandpa Joe, as he does appear 96 years old compared to Jack Albertson.  Kelly of course played Michael O'Sullivan in Waking Ned Devine, where he is seen riding a motorcycle in the countryside in his birthday suit.I suppose one can forgive 70's technology, but the river and waterfalls of chocolate in the edible meadow is thicker and more chocolaty compared to the original, which more or less looked like mop water.  And Violet's transformation is more realistic than the original, where it looked like she had blue lights shining on her.As for the four naughty tykes, well, they compare favourably to the earlier incarnations of Augustus, Veruca, Violet, and Mike.  Mike Teavee's favourite pastime is updated to PS2-type violent video games, and his kicking of sweets in the meadow is rather disturbing.  Veruca herself is even more vicious and demanding of her parents.  Indeed, when her father hands her the golden tickets his factory workers have found, she looks as if she expected nothing less and instantly says, ""I want a new pony.""  Uh, is ""thank you very much"" in her vocabulary?  Apparently not!This also reunites Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore once more, as Depp played J.M. Barrie to Freddie's Peter in Finding Neverland.  And it's high time Deep Roy, who plays the hundreds of digitally duplicated Oompa Loompas, got some recognition, as I remember him as the ill-fated midget assassin in The Pink Panther Strikes Again, the homicidal Mr. Sin in Dr. Who-Talons of Weng-Chiang.  This is his third film with Burton after Planet of the Apes and Big Fish (Mr. Soggybottom).  He has lots of fun doing the songs, especially one where there's a nod to Busby Berkeley's bathing beauties diving into the pool and doing the synchronized routine where they form a star, and the 80's heavy metal spoof following Mike's disposal.It pays to be modest and quiet, as opposed to being gluttonous, greedy, ultra-competitive, violent, or addicted to TV to the exclusion of all else.  That's Charlie Bucket for you.  And it also pays to be creative and talented-that's Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for you.",5,More faithful to the book than original,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,4412,"['Immediately', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'quickly', 'read', 'book', 'found', 'amazement', '90', '%', 'movie/book', 'correlation', 'then', 'rewatched', 'first', 'movie', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'winner', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'sweet', 'treat', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'seen', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'version', 'will', 'know', 'mad', 'search', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'hidden', 'chocolateer', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Wonka', 'Bars', 'prize', 'being', 'guided', 'tour', 'given', 'child', 'one', 'parent', 'other', 'prizes', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'poverty-ridden', 'family', 'cramped', 'decrepit', 'house', 'city', 'parents', 'sets', 'grandparents', 'elders', 'sharing', 'same', 'bed', 'one', 'couple', 'facing', 'other', 'listening', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'stories', 'sole', 'bright', 'time', 'year', 'getting', 'Wonka', 'bar', 'birthday.He', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'one', 'five', 'winners', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'himVariations', 'include', 'added', 'material', 'such', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'life', 'child', 'bit', 'daze', 'whenever', 'most', 'due', 'Charlie', 'questions', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'Willy', 'oppressive', 'braces', 'contraption', 'installed', 'severe', 'anti-sweets', 'dentist', 'father', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'torture', 'device', 'rather', 'something', 'straighten', 'teeth.Johnny', 'Depp', 'perfect', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'down', 'costume', 'dreamy', 'smile', 'childish', 'imagination-in', 'other', 'words', 'lovable', 'eccentric', 'sort', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'pale', 'face', 'gloved', 'hands', 'comparisons', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'are', 'unjustified', 'funny', 'lines', 'when', 'introducing', 'candy', 'meadow', 'Everything', 'edible', 'including', 'called', 'cannibalism', 'frowned', 'book', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'are', 'alive', 'instead', 'Anthony', 'Newley/Leslie', 'Bricusse', 'songs', 'two', 'songs', 'book', 'are', 'used', 'ones', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'use', 'Augustus', 'sent', 'up', 'strawberry', 'fudge', 'factory', 'close', 'not', 'identical', 'song', 'book', 'yes', 'Veruca', 'disposal', 'hoard', 'trained', 'squirrels', 'charge', 'cracking', 'walnuts', 'not', 'desiring', 'golden', 'egg', 'funniest', 'line', 'double-entendre', 'film', 'shouted', 'Wonka', 'Veruca', 'Do', ""n't"", 'touch', 'squirrel', 'nuts', 'David', 'Kelly', 'perfect', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'appear', '96', 'years', 'old', 'compared', 'Jack', 'Albertson', 'Kelly', 'course', 'played', 'Michael', ""O'Sullivan"", 'Waking', 'Ned', 'Devine', 'where', 'seen', 'riding', 'motorcycle', 'countryside', 'birthday', 'suit.I', 'suppose', 'one', 'can', 'forgive', '70', 'technology', 'river', 'waterfalls', 'chocolate', 'edible', 'meadow', 'thicker', 'more', 'chocolaty', 'compared', 'original', 'more', 'less', 'looked', 'mop', 'water', 'Violet', 'transformation', 'more', 'realistic', 'original', 'where', 'looked', 'had', 'blue', 'lights', 'shining', 'her.As', 'four', 'naughty', 'tykes', 'well', 'compare', 'favourably', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'Augustus', 'Veruca', 'Violet', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'favourite', 'pastime', 'updated', 'PS2-type', 'violent', 'video', 'games', 'kicking', 'sweets', 'meadow', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'Veruca', 'even', 'more', 'vicious', 'demanding', 'parents', 'Indeed', 'when', 'father', 'golden', 'tickets', 'factory', 'workers', 'have', 'found', 'expected', 'nothing', 'less', 'instantly', 'want', 'new', 'pony', 'Uh', 'very', 'much', 'vocabulary', 'Apparently', 'not', 'also', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'once', 'more', 'Depp', 'played', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Freddie', 'Peter', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'high', 'time', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'hundreds', 'digitally', 'duplicated', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'got', 'recognition', 'remember', 'ill-fated', 'midget', 'assassin', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Strikes', 'Again', 'homicidal', 'Mr', 'Sin', 'Dr.', 'Who-Talons', 'Weng-Chiang', 'third', 'film', 'Burton', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Big', 'Fish', 'Mr.', 'Soggybottom', 'lots', 'fun', 'doing', 'songs', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'nod', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'bathing', 'beauties', 'diving', 'pool', 'doing', 'synchronized', 'routine', 'where', 'form', 'star', '80', 'heavy', 'metal', 'spoof', 'following', 'Mike', 'disposal.It', 'be', 'modest', 'quiet', 'opposed', 'being', 'gluttonous', 'greedy', 'ultra-competitive', 'violent', 'addicted', 'TV', 'exclusion', 'else', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'also', 'be', 'creative', 'talented-that', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp']",N/A

Johnny Depp is superb as the rather odd chocolate inventor, who's childhood was less then perfect and adult life surrounded by an atmosphere children can only dream of.Yes I say childhood, for Burton has given us a look behind the story of Wonka, his father being a dentist who on one halloween threw all of Willy's precious, gathered candy into a fire. Being afraid of the cavities and other trouble sweets bring. Sound dumb? Not at all. Wonka has in consiquence grown up with a twisted idea of how families are, and has a hard time being around parents, even saying the word is torturous for the candy man.Other than that, this remake has run even closer to the book, Veronica being thrown down the garabge shoot by the squarrels instead of trying to get the goose that laid chocolate eggs. Even the Oompa Loompas have undergone changes, and in turn are hipper, wilder and smaller then before.The landscape is very Tim Burtonesque, in the beginning of the movie, its not hard to guess who's the director (If you already didn't know) For the coloring is dark, and the Buckets house has a decided scrunched look, and tilts to the right in a way only Tim Burton could make it tilt without completely falling.I can't quite say though its a movie to take you're children to.

Depp was bizarre in an unlikeable and unrealistic way.  What was he thinking?  What was Tim Burton thinking?2) The original Grandpa Joe was far better.3) Many of the other characters were just unsuccessfully attempted copies of the original movie's actors.  It was like Tim Burton told the casting directors and actors:  ""Study the original movie carefully, and copy the original actors as closely as you can.  That's our only hope!""4) The Oompa-Loompas were boring and fake and had no spirit.5) The songs had no pizzazz and weren't catchy.

The relationships between Charlie and his family are well established, and the spoiled kids are introduced pretty decently.  However, once the movie hits the chocolate factory, all hell breaks loose, for the audience as well as the characters.  Johnny Depp is totally miscast as Wonka, and seems to act as if he's in a bubble.  Not once do we ever believe he is capable of being a chocolate making genius.  He plays the role as if he's a cross between Michael Jackson and a 17th century dandy of the French court.  As for the kids, I couldn't help feeling that the sad state of our times made me look at the spoiled kids' behavior as normative and Charlie's pious behavior as the aberration.  Most of the Oompa Loompa's MTV rock commentaries were incoherent and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood were unnecessary.

In the last Willy Wonka movie, Gene Wilder seems very cheery all the time and just seems to really like his job. He seems to love the children he serves chocolate to. However the new Wonka seems to be embittered and dislikes conversation. He seems not to care for the kids, or maybe he just doesn't understand them.I really enjoyed Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. To me, Willy Wonka is supposed to be this weird recluse who people aren't supposed to like very much. Depp definitely got this image correct. Freddie Highmore also did well; he plays a very good Charlie, who isn't quite as nave as he seemed in the past. Then there is David Kelley who played Grandpa Joe.  He too was very good.

We have the '70s musical version with Gene Wilder on VHS. It was OK but didn't quite capture Dahl's magic.This version was less a traditional musical as all the numbers featured the Oompa-Loompas and were takeoffs on big production numbers from other movie musicals. I guess as much could be expected from Danny Elfman, who has done the music for The Simpsons and other Burton movies (including the amazing ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""). Elfman also does all the Oompa-Loompa singing vocals.Burton brings a back story to the Oompa-Loompas and to Willie Wonka, while Depp bring his own bizarre interpretation to the Wonka role. It's a good followup to his turn pirate Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbea.""The other four kids who find the Golden Tickets are right on the mark--gluttonous Gloop, greedy Veruca, vain Veronica, and smart-a** Mike--and all get their just desserts, so to speak. Special mention also go to Deep Roy (an Indian actor, I assume) who by the magic of digital technology, plays all the Oompa-Loompas, including the one who is Wonka's psychologist, and to the young actor who plays good-hearted Charlie of the title. Squirrels also play an important digitally-enhanced role.Overall, this movie might be a little strange (especially the squirrels) for very small children, but is good family fare with its own style.",4,Depp and Deep Chocolate Treat,1162252800,"10 31, 2006",2006,1508,"['involvement', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'need', 'see', 'treatment', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'classic', 'children', 'book', 'got', 'interested', 'film', 'have', ""'70s"", 'musical', 'version', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'VHS', 'was', 'OK', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'Dahl', 'magic.This', 'version', 'was', 'less', 'traditional', 'musical', 'numbers', 'featured', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'were', 'takeoffs', 'big', 'production', 'numbers', 'other', 'movie', 'musicals', 'guess', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'who', 'done', 'music', 'Simpsons', 'other', 'Burton', 'movies', 'including', 'amazing', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Elfman', 'also', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'singing', 'vocals.Burton', 'back', 'story', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Depp', 'bring', 'own', 'bizarre', 'interpretation', 'Wonka', 'role', 'good', 'followup', 'turn', 'pirate', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'Pirates', 'Caribbea', 'other', 'four', 'kids', 'who', 'find', 'Golden', 'Tickets', 'are', 'right', 'mark', 'gluttonous', 'Gloop', 'greedy', 'Veruca', 'vain', 'Veronica', 'smart-a**', 'Mike', 'get', 'just', 'desserts', 'so', 'speak', 'Special', 'mention', 'also', 'go', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Indian', 'actor', 'assume', 'who', 'magic', 'digital', 'technology', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'Wonka', 'psychologist', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'good-hearted', 'Charlie', 'title', 'Squirrels', 'also', 'play', 'important', 'digitally-enhanced', 'role.Overall', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'strange', 'especially', 'squirrels', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'good', 'family', 'fare', 'own', 'style']",N/A

One thing about him I don't understand is why he doesn't speak with a British accent when he's English and lives in England. Also I don't understand why he doesn't like children when he makes candy and acts like a child himself or maybe he just doesn't like these children because they're rotten.One thing I liked was how they showed Willy Wonka's childhood through flashbacks. However I felt that they made the movie a little longer than it should have been also they make you feel more for Willy than Charlie which is why they schould have been cut.One thing I didn't really care for were the Oompa Lumpa songs because they were preety bland and at times annoying.

Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory (so much for comparisons to Michael Jackson :-), though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the unnamed ""special prize"" Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish, down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid with the false sense of entitlement), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, who is now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the actors, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme; unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family, all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom. It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in C&tCF: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gorey and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy and Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet stylistically reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo (no cover versions of ""The Candy Man,"" sorry! :-) -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to.

The Oompa Loompas' hilarious dances mask the sinister underlining of their songs. The movie is very true to Dahl's book, with the obnoxious children and their equally obnoxious parents being well acted.But this is very definitely Johnny Depp's movie and his portrayal of Willy Wonka is delightful. Forget the comparisons to Michael Jackson; he contiuously reminded me of Carol Channing with his dimples, the slight tilt of his head and the crisp manner of speech- with a slight lisp. Funny?

All the usual themes and visual elements that Tim Burton is known for are present (i.e. separated families, an isolated outsider, and crooked houses). Johnny Depp is perfectly goofy and plays the role of Willy Wonka as an alienated outsider, locked away from the rest of the world (much like in Edward Scissorhands). In fact when you actually see Willy Wonka for the first time he's wearing large, round sunglasses and just looking at him you feel as if he's an alien from another planet who's just dropped in for a friendly visit.Tim Burton shows us the psychological side of Willy Wonka. Where did he come from? What's he's fascination with candy? And why is he all alone? Which helps provide a really nice character for Depp to wildly play out. Depp's Willy Wonka is a real nut-job, he's weird looking, and talks funny, and it's more effective than Gene Wilder's performance, because Willy Wonka should be really weird. The film is visually dazzling, the acting is superb, and the cast is absolutely spot-on-perfect! I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of people out there who'll absolutely hate it, but I loved it! Tim Burton really exceeded my expectations with this film.The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition DVD is somewhat of a let-down. There's a few behind-the-scenes featurettes about the casting, visual effects, set designs, how they created the Oompa-Loompas, how they did the scene involving dozens of squirrels and a featurette on how they created the chocolate river, that will make your mouth water in delight. There's also a documentary on Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. There's also some interactive games for the kiddies, but nothing that interesting. Some of the featurettes are fun and entertaining, but when added all together, is rather short, about an hour long. It would have also been nice to get an audio commentary from director Tim Burton. I've always liked listening to his commentaries on his other films (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish, Batman, Edward Scissorhands).

938902,A2S1JQWKZMGFD2,B000BB1MHS,"Durling Heath ""Durling Heath""","[9, 15]","Comparisons of Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" with the previous film version of Roald Dahl's classic starring Gene Wilder, ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" may be unfair (or not), but the comparisons certainly are inevitable.  The two most obvious contrasts between the two films are that between Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willie Wonka and Wilder's version 35 years earlier, and the general warmth and charm of Willie Wonka and the characters in general.An unquestionably talented actor who has evocatively played some truly breakthrough rolls, like Edward Scissorhands, for example, Johnny Depp either nails a character or does not.  In ""Charlie...,"" unfortunately, Depp misses big.  Depp creates in a new Willie Wonka a spooky, air-headed, heartless and ignorant Willie Wonka.  The audience wonders, ""How could this intellectual and emotional lightweight have ever created the worlds most prolific chocolate empire?""  There were no such concerns with Wilder's Willie Wonka, who, although occasionally abrupt and Darwinistic, the audience knew always had a heart of gold.Like Depp, Tim Burton's films are either a dead-on winner, like the first new ""Batman"" movie starring Michael Keaton, ""Ed Wood,"" and ""Corpse Bride,"" the latter ironically two both also starred Depp, or a miserable loser like the 2001 version of ""The Planet of the Apes"" and ""Mars Attacks.""  There is not much in between.  ""Charlie..."" is a loser.  By creating a world using smart special effects that is dark and oppressive and characters who are the product of that world, Burton gives the movie-goer (and DVD buyer) very little to feel good about.  Even the Oompa Loompas, who were fun, sage, and entertaining in the 1971 film were in fact sort of mean, chiding, and uninteresting.  (I use the word ""were,"" referring to the new Oompa Loompas in the plural.  In fact, Burton ""cheated"" by digitally reproducing the same actor, Deep Roy, hundreds of times to represent the diminutive factory workers.)The only bright spot in ""Charlie..."" was the casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's mother.  Her role is small and mostly insignificant, but Carter has the ability through her extraordinary talent as an actor to make just about every one of her roles amusing.  However, that bright spot does not shine long, as the other actors, from Freddie Highmore's Charlie, to David Kelly's Grampa Joe, to Noah Taylor's Mr. Bucket, to all of the actors who played the children, to Deep Roy who portrayed the Oompa Loompa(s), turn in performances as disappointing as the film itself.  For the most part, it's not the actors who were at fault.While ""Charlie..."" does in many ways parallel Roald Dahl's book more closely than ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" did three and a half decades ago, the new film fails to capture the poignant moral lessons in the same context as the book did.  It also fails to leave the audience with the same warm happy feeling that the original film did.  In short, unless you are a HUGE fan of Tim Burton or Johnny Depp, don't bother with this poorly constructed facsimile.",2,Burton gives the movie-goer (and DVD buyer) very little to feel good about,1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,3102,"['Comparisons', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'previous', 'film', 'version', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'classic', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'not', 'comparisons', 'certainly', 'are', 'inevitable', 'two', 'most', 'obvious', 'contrasts', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'portrayal', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Wilder', 'version', '35', 'years', 'earlier', 'general', 'warmth', 'charm', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'characters', 'general.An', 'unquestionably', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'evocatively', 'played', 'truly', 'breakthrough', 'rolls', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'example', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'not', 'Charlie', 'unfortunately', 'Depp', 'big', 'Depp', 'new', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'spooky', 'air-headed', 'heartless', 'ignorant', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'audience', 'wonders', 'How', 'could', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'lightweight', 'have', 'ever', 'created', 'worlds', 'most', 'prolific', 'chocolate', 'empire', 'were', 'such', 'concerns', 'Wilder', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'who', 'occasionally', 'abrupt', 'Darwinistic', 'audience', 'knew', 'always', 'had', 'heart', 'gold.Like', 'Depp', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'are', 'dead-on', 'winner', 'first', 'new', 'Batman', 'movie', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'latter', 'ironically', 'two', 'also', 'starred', 'Depp', 'miserable', 'loser', '2001', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Mars', 'Attacks', 'not', 'much', 'Charlie', 'loser', 'creating', 'world', 'using', 'smart', 'special', 'effects', 'dark', 'oppressive', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'product', 'world', 'Burton', 'movie-goer', 'DVD', 'buyer', 'very', 'little', 'feel', 'good', 'Even', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'who', 'were', 'fun', 'sage', 'entertaining', '1971', 'film', 'were', 'fact', 'sort', 'mean', 'chiding', 'uninteresting', 'use', 'word', 'were', 'referring', 'new', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'plural', 'fact', 'Burton', 'cheated', 'digitally', 'reproducing', 'same', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'hundreds', 'times', 'represent', 'diminutive', 'factory', 'workers', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Charlie', 'was', 'casting', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Charlie', 'mother', 'role', 'small', 'mostly', 'insignificant', 'Carter', 'ability', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'actor', 'make', 'just', 'one', 'roles', 'amusing', 'However', 'bright', 'spot', 'not', 'shine', 'long', 'other', 'actors', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Kelly', 'Grampa', 'Joe', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'Mr.', 'Bucket', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'children', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 's', 'turn', 'performances', 'as', 'disappointing', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'fault.While', 'Charlie', 'many', 'ways', 'parallel', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'more', 'closely', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'did', 'three', 'half', 'decades', 'ago', 'new', 'film', 'fails', 'capture', 'poignant', 'moral', 'lessons', 'same', 'context', 'book', 'did', 'also', 'leave', 'audience', 'same', 'warm', 'happy', 'feeling', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'short', 'are', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'facsimile']",N/A

It didn't.  This version stuck to the book in just about everyway form and gave a darker feel to what Rohald Dahl may have originally intended.  It surpassed my expectations, but didn't surpass the original film's flawlessness.  Below are some of my personal thoughts and comparisons:Charlie- This Charlie was better that 1971's.Wonka's dad- I love Christopher Lee, but thought the movie could have done without this. (I can't remember if this was in the book either.)Squirrels VS Geese- Yes there were no geese, but Veruca Salt's(the actress not the band) song, ""Gooses, Geeses"" should have been worked in there somehow.Songs- These songs are a ""no go.""  The first movies' songs were so much better.  I'm happy there weren't as many in this one though.Moral ideas- This movie didn't stress the moral issues that the righteous child won the prize at the end.  Ehh who cares?Oompa Loompas- I don't like the fact that they were all played by the same person.  However that person was Deep Roy and he is awesome in everything he does, so hats off to Tim Burton.""Cheer up Charlie""- THANK YOU GOD, for not putting that song in the remake.  I wore out the fast forward button on my remote from this song.70's Lingo- I know it's 2005, but ""jumping crocodiles"" still has a place in this man's heart.The wall of Schnazberries- Where my I ask is it?Charlie's dad- Actually I enjoyed his presence.  I didn't think I would, but it all worked out for the best.Beginning- There was not as much emphasis on the background of Willy Wonka's factory and the golden ticket search, but t did leave more time for the factory, so again, not a problem.All in all I did like the original better, but I think that kids today will enjoy the remake better.

938905,AQLKBEVHUQ0JK,B000BB1MHS,"Eddie Landsberg ""My 10th year as a reviewer !...","[3, 4]","No need to rehash the plot (as other reviewers have done it) - - Here's my opinion - -Don't know what to think of it....  All in all it seemed to me that that there were two elements to the movie that held it together:  First the story... On one hand its written in the tradition of a classic children's fable that teaches that greed is bad, and in the end nothing is more important than family... on the other hand, the story is told with a psychedelic twist, and I assume was meant to be an analogy of the generation gap in the era it was written. - - Of course, even with that era long done and over with why not a film where ""family values"" perserveres in the end... but not prior to an acid like trip to a land of Oz serving as a mind blowing mix of retro-mod graphic design and taking advantage of the latest computer technology to bring a world of fantasy and imagination to life as they've never done before - -  GREAT IDEA ! !  but...Here is where I think the film took a wrong turn:The mix of ""mod"" and ""grunge"" - - The cheery (yet bizarre) ""flowers and incense"" look... yet the DARK ""Batman"" like BGM as well as strange dance numbers that seem either stylistically forced or stylistically out of place and made me take the film less seriously... Some numbers seemed too stupid for an adult film, yet other elements seemed too grotesque or elaborate for a children's film.... - - Yet still, the mix of fantastic ideas, imagery and an amazing journey through a land of oompa-loompas and chocolate make the film work.  However, it seemed to me like the creative team involved in the project weren't all on the same the page... yet Burton managed to string everything together.There was another surprize though (I wonder if I am the only person who feels this...)I felt Willy Wonka was miscast.Johnny Depp is great at playing weird and intense characters, but I felt this Willy Wonka has more make-up than charisma going for him, and I could have just as easily seen someone like Steve Buscemi or Geoffrey Rush playing the role...Whatever, at times I felt that Depp got a kick out of the idea of doing the film, but just didn't have much to work with beyond going along for the ride...In conclusion, I have NO REGRETS watching the film, and recommend it, but I don't think I'd watch it again even though the LOOK of the film was definitely groundbreaking.  Great story, great cast, great feel... yet certain stylistic inconsistencies lost me at times.",3,"Engaging, but don't know what to make of it...",1187913600,"08 24, 2007",2007,2458,"['need', 'rehash', 'plot', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'Here', 'opinion', '-Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'seemed', 'were', 'two', 'elements', 'movie', 'held', 'together', 'First', 'story', 'one', 'hand', 'written', 'tradition', 'classic', 'children', 'fable', 'greed', 'bad', 'end', 'nothing', 'more', 'important', 'family', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'told', 'psychedelic', 'twist', 'assume', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'analogy', 'generation', 'gap', 'era', 'was', 'written', 'course', 'even', 'era', 'long', 'done', 'why', 'not', 'film', 'where', 'family', 'values', 'perserveres', 'end', 'not', 'prior', 'acid', 'trip', 'land', 'Oz', 'serving', 'mind', 'blowing', 'mix', 'retro-mod', 'graphic', 'design', 'taking', 'advantage', 'latest', 'computer', 'technology', 'bring', 'world', 'fantasy', 'imagination', 'life', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'GREAT', 'IDEA', 'Here', 'where', 'think', 'film', 'took', 'wrong', 'turn', 'mix', 'mod', 'grunge', 'cheery', 'yet', 'bizarre', 'flowers', 'incense', 'look', 'yet', 'DARK', 'Batman', 'BGM', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'dance', 'numbers', 'seem', 'stylistically', 'forced', 'stylistically', 'place', 'made', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'numbers', 'seemed', 'too', 'stupid', 'adult', 'film', 'yet', 'other', 'elements', 'seemed', 'too', 'grotesque', 'elaborate', 'children', 'film', 'still', 'mix', 'fantastic', 'ideas', 'imagery', 'amazing', 'journey', 'land', 'oompa-loompas', 'chocolate', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'However', 'seemed', 'creative', 'team', 'involved', 'project', 'were', ""n't"", 'all', 'same', 'page', 'yet', 'Burton', 'managed', 'string', 'everything', 'together.There', 'was', 'surprize', 'wonder', 'am', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'felt', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', 'miscast.Johnny', 'Depp', 'great', 'playing', 'weird', 'intense', 'characters', 'felt', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'more', 'make-up', 'charisma', 'going', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'seen', 'someone', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'playing', 'role', 'Whatever', 'times', 'felt', 'Depp', 'got', 'kick', 'idea', 'doing', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'going', 'along', 'ride', 'conclusion', 'have', 'REGRETS', 'watching', 'film', 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'even', 'LOOK', 'film', 'was', 'definitely', 'groundbreaking', 'Great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'feel', 'yet', 'certain', 'stylistic', 'inconsistencies', 'lost', 'times']",N/A

938907,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000BB1MHS,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 1]","As he proves again and again, Tim Burton is one of the more idiosyncratic filmmakers around, directing movies that alternate between remarkable and exasperating. Even with the shadow imposed by the 1971 version with Gene Wilder, Roald Dahl's classic children's story turns out to be the ideal vehicle for Burton's singular talents. Casting his muse, Johnny Depp, as the reclusive, pixilated Willy Wonka turns out to be a masterstroke as Depp is among the most audacious of screen actors constantly upending our expectations on how he plays his roles. Pitching his character as a rather perturbed cross between Mister Rogers and Pee Wee Herman (though the parallels with Michael Jackson are self-evident from the get-go), Depp is far from endearing as he is deliberately disconnected from any reality so he can focus solely on his own childish delights. At the same time, his hubris is what ironically makes him sympathetic as his insulated upbringing has allowed his innate brilliance to give rise to an elaborate confectionary factory.Skillfully adapted by John August, Dahl's tale focuses on a poor, good-hearted boy named Charlie, who lives with his close-knit family in a squalid cottage in a permanent leaning position. The home is just a stone's throw away from Wonka's factory. Wonka decides one day to hold a worldwide contest in which five children will win a guided tour of his factory hidden from the prying eyes of the public all these years. The children are chosen by way of golden tickets hidden in five Wonka chocolate bars, and of course, after much struggle, Charlie is one of the lucky five. Except for Charlie, each child turns out to be a brat, and their accompanying guardians show the reason why. The terrorizing children are gluttonous Augustus Gloop; spoiled Veruca Salt; ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde; and condescending techno-geek Mike Teavee. Wonka's guided tour is the highlight of the film replete with elaborate sets by Alex McDowell, dazzling cinematography by Philippe Rousselot and what looks to be an army of artists and technicians who have created this wildly imaginative world with a unique sense of panache. Special mention needs to go to Deep Roy, who thanks to digital magic, synchronistically plays all 165 Oompa-Loompas, a herculean effort if ever there was one in film acting.The overdubbed voice of Danny Elfman provides the Oompa-Loompas' vocalizing during the elephantine production numbers, and his genre-spanning music is a total kick. Elfman mimics various pop music styles to define the fates of the selfish children, from the blaring Earth, Wind and Fire-type horns for Violet to the Beach Boys harmonies for Veruca to the Queen overlays for Mike. As skillful as Depp is, Freddie Highmore - reunited with Depp more fruitfully than last year's ""Finding Neverland"" - provides the emotional focal point of the story with quiet conviction. The story takes a bit of a Freudian leap with the introduction of Wonka's father to explain Willy's oddly alienating behavior, but it all works within the context of the eccentric characters. This one is a genuine delight if not what most would expect from a children's film. The DVD is chock-full of extras with eight different featurettes highlighting various aspects of the production from Elfman's music to Roy's laborious transformation into the Oompa-Loompas, though my favorite is ""The Attack of the Squirrels"" which follows an army of squirrels through nut-cracking boot camp.

Wonka looks like Michael Jackson, aside from the pael complexion. And people comparing when he invited JUST Charlie to the factory in the movie to MJ's molestation trial... NOBODY PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WROTE THE SCRIPT SO DROP IT!!!! *deep breath* Okay then...This adaptation is much more faithful to Roald Dahl's characters then the original. Not as many liberties were taken with the plot. *With the exception of some flashback's of Wonka dentist dad/childhood... nice touch I thought :), gives Willy and his behavior a bit more depth* Plus with all the new technology (and a bigger budget didn't hurt), they were able to make things seem a bit more real for Wonka's marvelous world (not to mention no orange faced-green haired oompa loompas).OMG the music!!! Danny Elfman did a spectacular job with the arrangements! These songs stay in your heard long after the movie is over *a good thing* The Oompa Loompas songs about the four brats are exceptionally well-done and they used Dahl's own words (in the original they probly cut some to save time I imagine and to get the point faster)... my favorites of those were the 'Mike Teavee' and 'Violet Beaureguarde (sp?)' tracks.The cast... their acting was so wonderful. Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor did a great job Charlie's Mum and Dad, Freddie Highmore was perfect for the role of Charlie.. nice, quiet, and looked poor unlike the last boy who played him (again no offense to fans of the original cast). Everyone had great chemistry and put so much heart into their roles.They updated a couple things, Mike being obsessed with Video games instead of just TV programs and Violet/Her Mother being very competitive but it fit the story.Only complaint I had at the end was that Augustus wasn't skinny after going up the pipe, still his fat self.. but only a minor nitpick in such an amazing movie.I can't recommend this movie enough (seen it 5 times already :-D)... definitely a must-see, totally worth your time. I betcha this will sell out VERY quickly once it's released on DVD (hopefully before Black Friday). Johnny's take on Willy is so delicious! You wanna hug this poor guy and take him home lol.If they decide to film 'Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator', I hope: Johnny and everyone comes back for it and John August does the screenplay again *MAGNIFICENT JOB* Tim Burton already said he wouldn't direct the sequel so I hope it's put in capable hands. Though, when/if they decide to do this movie, it probly won't be for a few years (as Johnny's got a few other projects lined up lol, didn't check on the rest yet).Well, what are you waiting for?!

938912,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B000BB1MHS,Erica Anderson,"[1, 2]","I finally got around to seeing Tim Burton's remake of Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". As much as I love the 1971 version ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder, I thought this new version was just as good. Johnny Depp as the eccentric, mysterious Willy Wonka was hilarious. I definitely could see the Michael Jackson comparisons in the way Willy Wonka spoke and attitude. ""Finding Neverland"" co-star Freddie Highmore once again co-starred with Johnny Depp as the good-hearted Charlie, and was a delight to watch. Given his recent film roles, Freddie Highmore is going to be around in the film business for a  long time (I hope). He truly embodied the goodness and innocence in his character Charlie. The scenery in the candy factory was pure visual candy. It was stunning especially with the river of chocolate. I loved the oompah loompahs. Their musical numbers were hilarious although they did tend to drag on a bit which was one of the few flaws I found with the film. The flashbacks were interesting but again annoying.

Sometimes you get a ""Psycho"" style remake, a movie so like the original you are suprised someone ever produced it.  Other times, though, things work out.  You get a movie that is just as good or better than the orginal.  With this in mind, I can honestly say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an excellent film.The film approaches the novel from a different direction than the movie.  Its producers claim this movie ""follows the original story"" closer than the first movie.  There are differences.  Willy Wonka is made into a three-dimensional character, we see the circumstances that led to his obsession with candy, how he meant the Oompa Loompas (now played by a single actor, the famous Deep Roy, multiplied a million times over via computer animation).  Charlie may be the same, but he now has a father as well as a mother and his home gives the phrase ""fixer upper"" new meaning.The film progresses much as the original did, but again there are differences.  The Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers are more lively, the feeling of the film more positive, the greatest suprise is a plot twist when Charlie - but I will not tell.All in all, I give this movie a definite thumbs up.

938914,A1AVSW1LXGBO4Y,B000BB1MHS,"Evan Hinton ""Critic for Hire""","[0, 1]","Sometimes movies surprise you.  For some reason, every time Johnny Depp is in a movie, it's one of those surprising ones, at least for me.  I thought ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was going to flop (A movie based on a ride?  C'mon!), but we all know how successful that was.  And I thought ""Secret Window"" would be a tense thriller, but it turned out to be a predictable snoozer.  And once again, Johnny Depp has surprised me:  starring in a not-too-shabby film version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", not to be confused with the 1971 musical film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".  Same story, but an utterly different experience.First of all, this film is directed by Tim Burton, known for darker, edgier films, which is just fine because the original book, written by Roald Dahl (also known for ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""Matilda"") is dark and edgy too, at least for a children's book.Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), a very eccentric candy maker who runs a secretive and mysterious factory, plants five golden tickets in the wrappers of his chocolate bars, and the five lucky children who find them are invited to see his bizarre hideaway.All the children are perfect stereotypes of various kinds of kids:  There's the gluttonous one, the bratty one, the competitive one, the critical one, and, most importantly, the wholesome one, Charlie (Freddie Highmore).  It may seem pretty simplistic to have all of these characters so cut-and-dried, but Dahl's work tends toward stereotypical characters that are easy to identify.  One must remember that no matter how creepy it may seem, this is, at the end of the day, based on a children's book.And at times, it is a bit creepy.  Willy Wonka, with his pale face, strange hair, and high-pitched voice bears a frightening resemblance to Michael Jackson.  But the resemblance isn't so over-powering that you feel uncomfortable with the fact that he's in his ""neverland"" with these kids, and I got the impression that Willy Wonka is the person Michael Jackson tries to emulate, rather than the other way around.Wonka himself is very much like a child, with giddy navet&eacute; and an almost bratty quality to him.  Through the course of the film, as the various bad stereotypes learn their lessons, Willy discovers he has a thing or two to learn as well.I must admit I have not seen the old musical, and know of it only by reputation, so I cannot fairly compare the two films.  However, I will say that this rendition has a fair amount of musical numbers, which start off as quite a surprise but soon become quite predictable.Despite sparkling with Johnny Depp-flavored wit and Roald Dahl's beloved story, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is blemished by Tim Burton's spooky touch, somehow managing to feel eerie even when it should be lighter.",4,"""Charlie"": Insert bad candy pun here",1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,2803,"['Sometimes', 'movies', 'surprise', 'reason', 'time', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'movie', 'one', 'surprising', 'ones', 'least', 'thought', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'was', 'going', 'flop', 'movie', 'based', 'ride', ""C'mon"", 'know', 'how', 'successful', 'was', 'thought', 'Secret', 'Window', 'would', 'be', 'tense', 'thriller', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'predictable', 'snoozer', 'once', 'again', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'surprised', 'starring', 'not-too-shabby', 'film', 'version', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'not', 'be', 'confused', '1971', 'musical', 'film', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Same', 'story', 'utterly', 'different', 'experience.First', 'film', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'known', 'darker', 'edgier', 'films', 'just', 'fine', 'original', 'book', 'written', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'also', 'known', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Matilda', 'dark', 'edgy', 'too', 'least', 'children', 'book.Willy', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'very', 'eccentric', 'candy', 'maker', 'who', 'secretive', 'mysterious', 'factory', 'plants', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'wrappers', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'five', 'lucky', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'are', 'invited', 'see', 'bizarre', 'children', 'are', 'perfect', 'stereotypes', 'various', 'kinds', 'kids', 'gluttonous', 'one', 'bratty', 'one', 'competitive', 'one', 'critical', 'one', 'most', 'importantly', 'wholesome', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'may', 'seem', 'pretty', 'simplistic', 'have', 'characters', 'so', 'cut-and-dried', 'Dahl', 'work', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'are', 'easy', 'identify', 'One', 'must', 'remember', 'matter', 'how', 'may', 'seem', 'end', 'day', 'based', 'children', 'book.And', 'times', 'bit', 'creepy', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'pale', 'face', 'strange', 'hair', 'high-pitched', 'voice', 'frightening', 'resemblance', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'resemblance', ""n't"", 'so', 'over-powering', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'fact', 'neverland', 'kids', 'got', 'impression', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'person', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'emulate', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'very', 'much', 'child', 'giddy', 'navet', 'eacute', 'almost', 'bratty', 'quality', 'course', 'film', 'various', 'bad', 'stereotypes', 'learn', 'lessons', 'Willy', 'thing', 'two', 'learn', 'well.I', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'old', 'musical', 'know', 'only', 'reputation', 'can', 'not', 'fairly', 'compare', 'two', 'films', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'rendition', 'fair', 'amount', 'musical', 'numbers', 'start', 'off', 'quite', 'surprise', 'soon', 'become', 'quite', 'predictable.Despite', 'sparkling', 'Johnny', 'Depp-flavored', 'wit', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'beloved', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'blemished', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'spooky', 'touch', 'somehow', 'managing', 'feel', 'eerie', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'lighter']",N/A
938915,A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,B000BB1MHS,FairiesWearBoots8272,"[2, 3]","Oh, Tim Burton, I never lost my faith in you. After Burton's output significantly slowed down during the late '90s, some wondered if his best years were behind him. Then Burton follows up his excellent 1999 pic Sleepy Hollow with a dreadful remake of the sci-fi classic, Planet of the Apes. Oh dear. Will we never see another Burtonian masterpiece? Will we never be blessed with another imaginative fairytale like Edward Scissorhands? Or an oddball biopic like Ed Wood? Or a dark comic tale like Batman Returns? Well, perhaps the failure of Planet of the Apes shook Burton back to his senses. He returned, as if from a sabbatical in the depths of the Batcave, in 2003 with a fabulous movie called Big Fish. Ah yes, this is the Tim Burton that we love. Now in 2005 we have two new Burton flicks to savor. Corpse Bride, another stop-motion triumph marrying Burton's macabre characters with Edgar Allan Poe sensibilities, and of course, a live action marvel of a movie: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton is back with a vengeance!!Now while I loved Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is without a doubt Burton's best movie in a decade. It's all here - everything that we love about Tim Burton as a storyteller. All of his trademarks, the creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, are all here in abundance. Roald Dahl's classic book was begging for a Burtonization. Why did no one think of this sooner? Johnny Depp takes the role of the mysterious candy maker Willy Wonka, in what is sure to be a controversial performance among fans. I thought he was great. He does not attempt to recapture Gene Wilder's Wonka in any way. Depp recreates the character as his own. Tim Burton also found a perfect Charlie in Freddie Highmore. As the key character in the movie, Highmore's Charlie is always believable and sympathetic. David Kelly is simply a delight as Grandpa Joe. I also loved Deep Roy's performance(s) as the Oompa Loompas. I love that Burton went in a completely different direction and didn't try to copy the Oompa Loompas of the 1971 film. Burton's Oompa Loompas are far more fun and imaginative.You've also got marvelous production design and Tim Burton's visual genius which bring to life Roald Dahl's world in a way that we've never imagined. This movie simply looks splendid. Scrumdiddlyumptious, if you will. The production design and art direction should certainly get Oscar nominations next February. Then we have Danny Elfman's excellent music. Just what would a Tim Burton movie be without a Danny Elfman score? As always, Elfman captures the perfect tone for this wild, fantastic world. One of the best additions to this movie is the subplot featuring the great Christopher Lee as Willy Wonka's father. That's exactly what the story needed, a bit more dramatic depth and some additional characterization for Wonka.Fans of the 1971 Gene Wilder version will certainly have much to debate upon seeing this new movie. I personally feel that this movie far surpasses the 1971 movie. I am a big fan of the old one, yes, but I always felt that Gene Wilder's excellent performance stood head and shoulders above the rest of the movie. Peter Ostrum's Charlie was less compelling than he should have been and none of the other characters were particularly fleshed out enough for me to care about them. I did love the movie's sense of dark humor, but as a whole I felt it was a flawed as a story. However, in comparison, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is practically flawless. I honestly loved everything about this movie. There is not one complaint or quibble I have with it. This is quite simply everything I could have wished for in a Tim Burton take on Roald Dahl's story. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a Tim Burton masterpiece.

What I like about this one is that it's not exactly the same as the original. After watching the other one a million times . . . I was expecting something different. The sets were real, people. No CGI there. The acting was hilarious and all the characters gave something different to the remake. But, however possible, in this one, Wonka slightly takes on a creepier tone. Gene wilder was playful, but in this one, Wonka almost has a glimmer of sadism in his eyes. Watch the Sqirrel scene, you'll see what I'm talking about. Anyhow, the misfortunes of the children were very funny and gave me back the memories from before. The only thing that I really didn't like were two very distinctive things:One, the oompa loompas were totally wrong. All of them looked depressed or just plain angry. Not like the orange-faced goof balls in the last one.Two, the songs were not as pleasing. They say that the songs were taken straight from the book.

And true to form the film is a Burton world of the fantastic, a huge mesmerizing storybook reality taking place in another dimension.  This time you are grateful to leave at the end and put it back on the shelf. Burton has attempted to give Wonka some humanity by inserting a ""back story"" not part of Dahl's original book.  Wonka's present life is intermittently tormented by flashbacks of his childhood of abuse and cruelty at the hands of his father.  Does this make Wonka more sympathetic?

938919,ADOZUQ9QM16IB,B000BB1MHS,Fred Shigelbort,"[0, 0]","I really liked this movie.  I liked the Tim Burton trademark on it.  I loved the look of Johnny Depp.  I'm still not happy when people compare him to Michael Jackson, though. Where did that come from!? Still, I think the original movie is better for one reason.  It has to do with the character of Willy Wonka and I am not talking about the acting ability of Johnny Depp compared with Gene Wilder. Both of them are great actors!  But, the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka was definitely a morally better character than the Johnny Depp version.  The Johnny Depp Willy Wonka had some serious problems himself.  The back story of Willy Wonka in the new movie has nothing to do with the book and I believe there is a good chance that Roald Dahl would likely have objected to it.  (Note that he was on the set of the first movie.) I think it all combines to make the Johnny Depp character appear to be more of a ""psychotic"" Willy Wonka, especially when compared to the ""eccentric"" character of the book and the Wilder movie.  The moral high ground that the Gene Wilder character seems to have, makes it seem more natural that he has the authority and right to teach the kids and parents their lessons.  That being said, the new movie is otherwise a bit truer to the original story.  The advance of special effects allows them do some things that they couldn't do in the older movie. Moreover, the older movie looks dated, especially the scene of his mother working in the laundry.  My suggestion is to watch both movies.  On top of everything, don't forget to read the book.

I was hoping to be laughing at Johnny Depp's comments, but was dumbfounded.The movie begins with Wonka closing the factory and years later reopening the factory to the public. Unfortunately, only 5 lucky children will be allowed to enter. We have kids from different parts of the world winning including Charlie, who is lives in a run down cottage but has his family. The group is given a tour of the factory by the eccentric, but disturbed Wonka. Johnny Depp is a little too weird as oppose to Gene Wilder's sacastic, but lovable Wonka. This new Wonka is too strange and I don't think I'd feel comfortable with him giving me a tour. On the other hand, the factory itself is so imaginative and truly represents Burton's strange mind. The Oompa Loopa's is played by one person and the songs, clearly by Danny Elfman, sounds like he can't change his 80s new wave sound. In addition, it was hard to hear the lyrics, therefore the lesson to be learned was hard to understand.The relationship of family is explored throughout the movie from Charlie's relationship to his family and Wonka's relationship to his father. The movie seems to be Tim Burton's way of teaching children the dangers of overindulgence and love of family. Unfortunately, the movie, although imaginative, was not very entertaining.

938925,A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,B000BB1MHS,"GameraRocks ""captpicardfan""","[7, 9]","I absolutely loved this movie. It has reminded me why the original film was so special. Even though the original will always be a classic, in some ways, I almost think that this movie surpassed the original. For example, it actually showed more than the original film. In the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", it is only mentioned how the Oompa Loompas came to work in the factory. But in ""Charlie"", you actually see Wonka go to their home country and find out why they are even working for him. Another interesting thing about this movie is that we get to see into the life of a young Willy Wonka when he was just a child; he has been emotionally scarred by his strict father who never allowed him to eat chocolate or any other candy because his dad was a dentist.The scenery for this film is amazing. From the snow covered city, to the candy room in the factory, it was very beautiful and set the perfect mood for the story. Tim Burton in a recent interview said that it is real chocolate that you see coming down the waterfall, no fake stuff. All in all, it is very wonderful eye candy.As my brother, who was with me mentioned, it was amazing how well the young actors in this film did. Very talented and eerily resembling the actors who were in the original film. The person who was Charlie in the film did an excellent job, and so did the person who played his grandfather. Johnny Depp is the perfect choice for Wonka. Wonka comes off as a big kid and Depp played it brilliantly. He is just what you see on the TV commercials, a very cool character that made the movie even more interesting.The music was very catchy, with each new person that was eliminated from the contest; the Oompa Loompas changed the music entirely for each one. These songs had me tapping my toes at many parts, it has inspired me to go out and buy the soundtrack, and I did. And the classical scores by Danny Elfman were fantastic as well, he is sure to be the next John Williams. His music help set the mood during the opening credits when the chocolate bars are shown being made.Overall, this film is everything I had hoped it would be. This has become my favorite Burton film. The entire time, I can't remember when a smile wasn't literally on my face; it was just like being a kid again watching the original for the first time, even though in some ways the stories are completely different, this movie being closer to the book than the original. This is probably the funniest time I've had in the theater this summer and it was just as enjoyable on the DVD. On a pure enjoyment factor, this movie is tops. What's not to like? It's a feel good movie that touches the inner child in us and leaves you feeling good by the end. If you miss this movie and don't buy it, you are missing something huge.First, when mentioning the special features, I first have to mention the menu screens. Excellently done, each different menu stared Deep Roy as an Oompa Loompa and each screen he is always doing something different. A lot of time was put into just the menu screen; it's nice to know so much care was put into that alone. It was also nice to see Deep Roy do this for us DVD viewers, he is always entertaining.  Now to the special features:Attack of the Squirrels- This is a short making of that shows that these squirrels weren't the easiest actors to work with. It is amazing how much of what we see on the film, not all, was done by real squirrels. We also get a look at the CGI and mechanical squirrels. It's a very interesting look into all of this.The Fantastic Mr. Dahl- This is a touching look at the life of Mr. Roald Dahl, the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory among other novels. This documentary features Dahl's family and friends as their share stories of their lives living with the legend. It also features the family and friends reading excerpts from his various stories. At times, it is very touching to the point tears begin to form. This was a very loving tribute to the author who loved and understood children.Becoming Oompa Loompa- Deep Roy is probably the most talented actor of this film, and this is really shown when you see how much work he put into his performance as an Oompa Loompa. From learning the choreography to having to do the same moves time after time after time, when it's all finished, you find a new appreciation for Deep Roy as an actor.The Five Making of Featurretes- These small mini-documentaries go into detail about how the factory/music and so on was made. My favorite part being how the music was made since this movie has such a brilliant soundtrack.Challenges- These are mini-games that are lots of fun for any age. Oompa-Loompa Dance Machine being my favorite. In this game, you can watch how Deep Roy does the moves for the songs ""Augustus Gloop"" and ""Violet Beauregarde"" and you can watch and rewatch the steps to learn how to dance like an Oompa Loompa. Then the second part of the game is that when he is dancing, you can use your remote control and follow his dance moves with the remote. If you mess up, the Oompa Loompa will fall and you have to start over. Once you successfully do one dance, more moves are added and the game becomes more difficult. Real fun!Overall this DVD is excellent! A lot of time was put into it and I couldn't be happier.",5,Second Favorite Movie Of The Year!!!!!!,1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,5313,"['absolutely', 'loved', 'movie', 'reminded', 'why', 'original',

I typically do not even like Tim Burton's movies very much, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was definitely an exception. Some of the characters have been modified slightly from the book and original movie, but in a good way. Johnny Depp did an excellent job as Wonka, as did the boy who played Charlie. The score by Danny Elfman was superb.I think what made this movie so great was that it was not really an attempt to remake an old movie, but rather a new adaptation of the book. Now, it's probably been 20 years since I read the book by Roald Dahl, but I thought this movie stayed truer to the book than the original movie did, if memory serves me correctly. Of course, a separate side story about how Willy Wonka became a ""chocolateer"" was added. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember this aspect being in the original book.Overall, this is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.

938927,AG8K92N37MT27,B000BB1MHS,Garnet,"[0, 0]","I adored the first movie and loved how Gene Wilder played Willy Wonka.  I wasn't sure at first about Johnny Depp's performance (even though I think JD is a genius), but it kind of grew on me and, eventually, I felt more sad for him than anything else.  Which made Charlie's redeeming of Willy Wonka all the more special in the end.  Charlie ended up with money/a future, but Willy Wonka ended up with affection/a family.  It all balanced out in the end, aka ""life had never been sweeter.""The special effects are eye-popping and the bright color scheme of the interior of the factory makes the dull colors of the world that Charlie lived in all the more distinctive.  Willy Wonka is decidely odd, a bit spooky, and even a touch cold at times, a much closer representation of the character in the book than the performance by Gene Wilder.  Neither movie comes close to how malicious he can seem in the book as he brings the ""bad"" children to their iconic dooms, though this second movie is nearer to the mark.The background story of Willy Wonka and his father don't add as much to the movie as they should and could possibly have been left out, though there is a sly humor in the idea that the world's greatest chocolatier came from such a strict dentist.  This is not the best of Tim Burton's movies, but I freely admit that my standards where he is concerned are quite high.  The songs were great and the visuals stunning, and the theme of the movie quite family-supportive.Overall, I would recommend owning both movies and showing the orginal to younger children and saving the later one for older children.",4,Oddly Charming But Can Be Disturbing,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,1608,"['adored', 'first', 'movie', 'loved', 'how', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'played', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'even', 'think', 'JD', 'genius', 'kind', 'grew', 'eventually', 'felt', 'more', 'sad', 'anything', 'else', 'Which', 'made', 'Charlie', 'redeeming', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'more', 'special', 'end', 'Charlie', 'ended', 'up', 'money/a', 'future', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'ended', 'up', 'affection/a', 'family', 'balanced', 'out', 'end', 'life', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'sweeter', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'eye-popping', 'bright', 'color', 'scheme', 'interior', 'factory', 'dull', 'colors', 'world', 'Charlie', 'lived', 'more', 'distinctive', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'decidely', 'odd', 'bit', 'spooky', 'even', 'touch', 'cold', 'times', 'much', 'closer', 'representation', 'character', 'book', 'performance', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'movie', 'close', 'how', 'malicious', 'can', 'seem', 'book', 'bad', 'children', 'iconic', 'dooms', 'second', 'movie', 'nearer', 'mark.The', 'background', 'story', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'should', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'sly', 'humor', 'idea', 'world', 'greatest', 'chocolatier', 'came', 'such', 'strict', 'dentist', 'not', 'best', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'freely', 'admit', 'standards', 'where', 'concerned', 'are', 'quite', 'high', 'songs', 'were', 'great', 'visuals', 'stunning', 'theme', 'movie', 'quite', 'family-supportive.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'owning', 'movies', 'showing', 'orginal', 'younger', 'children', 'saving', 'later', 'one', 'older', 'children']",N/A
938928,AY12DBB0U420B,B000BB1MHS,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Charlie and The Chocolate Factory,"" a movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. That says a lot doesn't it? Would you be expecting weird, or what? Remember, these guys have teamed up in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""The Corpse Bride."" Well, you can also add the music of Danny Elfman, former leader of ""Oingo Boingo"" fame. Strange, strange movie. Oh, and by the way, if you've ever had the experience of a ""fixer-upper"" house or have even considered it, viewing the ""fixer-upper"" in this movie is worth the admission or DVD price.In any case, the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory, closed for some time with all the employees fired, has reopened and has offered a ""Golden Ticket"" to the first five people who find it inside five of their Willy Wonka Chocolate Bars sold on a world-wide basis. Their prize is a one-day all-you-can-eat tour of the new factory. The first four tickets were easy to find and, let's-just-say, they went to kids that you or Johnny Depp, the leader of the tour, would probably not care to spend a day with. The fifth kid, Charlie, came from an extended family who lived in the ""fixer-upper"" place and he was accompanied by his grandfather, a former laid-off worker in the old Willy Wonka Factory, who was suspected of giving away trade secrets in the old Willy Wonka days. Anyway, it's a weird tour. All the rivers, waterfalls, lakes and any other forms of water are liquid chocolate and the grass, flowers and anything else on the tour is one or another form of edible candy. Weird place. The elevators go up and down or sideways, depending on which way you want to go. The actors are all real (well, the lilleputian-sized people are an animation trick), but the factory, tour and everything else is one of these computer animation jobs, and it's clever and amusing. It's a fun, frivolous movie. Relax and enjoy.Gary Peterson",4,Fun Frivolous Movie.

938930,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000BB1MHS,General Breadbasket,"[3, 5]","It isn't a new thing to see Johnny Depp surrounded by chocolate (Chocolat), or for him to act for director Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood). Neither it is a new thing to make a film adaption of Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (there's the 1971 version starring Gene Wilder). Still, in the previews it did look like it was going to be a treat. It wasn't as sweet as I'd hoped though.Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is a poor but good hearted child, and he, his parents, and his four grandparents, all live together in a crooked old house. Charlie's a creative child, he uses toothpaste tubes from his father's work to build a model chocolate factory. He wishes he could visit the town's real one, owned by the eccentric Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp).  Charlie's wish comes true when he finds a golden ticket in a chocolate bar, which invites him to the factory. Taking his Grampa Joe (David Kelly) with him, Charlie meets Willy and goes with him, along with four, less good natured children into the wonderous world of the factory. They'll discover a chocolate waterfall, three - course meal chewing gum, the Oompa - Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) and the incredible glass elevator.I like the design of the film, and I love the colour scheme. Its rich like chocolate. I remember seeing the posters a couple of months before the film came out: Augustus' blonde hair, powdery pink face and bright blue eyes, and it was really evocative. In some shots it almost has a colorized feel. I also like the look of the factory, the casting of the children (which I think was perfect) and the fact you get to see them after their comeuppance. I like the look of Depp's Wonka and for the most part, I like Depp's perfomance too. Reminded me a little of his performance as Ed Wood, in terms of enthusiasm, but more child-like and neurotic.However, I didn't like the more selfish side to Depp's character. He doesn't particularly like children or family for most of the film, and is rather impatient at times, and his friendliness is often forced. Gene Wilder's Wonka was a awe-inspiring but friendly, lonely man. Watching the 1971 version as a child, you wanted to go to the factory, not just to eat the amazing candies, but to meet the man. If I was a child now, I wouldn't know what to make of Depp's Wonka's selfish side. He doesn't really want anyone in his factory. He just wants to show it off! This is rather different from the book, which Tim Burton claims to be trying to be faithful to.Another difference from the book is an inclusion of a backstory to Willy Wonka. It turns out his father was ironically a rather intimidating dentist who wouldn't let him eat candy, played by none other than Christopher Lee, a man whose roles have included Dracula, Fu Manchu, Count Dooku, Sauruman and the voice of Discworld's Grim Reaper. Now I love Christopher Lee, I really, really do, but his appearance in this film seems to me to be just for appearance's sake, just because he's experiencing a resurgence of popularity after ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"".Due to the addition of this backstory, there are a series of flashbacks interdispersed throughout the film. The backstory is very Tim Burton. Willy is an outsider as a child, and with his mouth and head full of wires, he's kind of a freak. The flashbacks have a kind of ""Edward Scissorhands"" vibe. Though its not in the book, I can see Dahl making Wonka's father a dentist if he had felt like elaborating in that direction, and I wouldn't have minded this backstory so much if it hadn't been for the consequences it has on the ending, which I found disappointing.The Oompa Loompas annoyed me also. I like Deep Roy, but there was just too much (or should that be ""too many"") of him in this film. The songs, penned, pitch shifted and sung by Danny Elfman (with lyrics from the Roald Dahl poems of the original novel), irritated me for the most part too. Just kind of tacky sounding, I felt. I did like the Beatle-esque song for Veruca Salt's exit though.The DVD is very well put together, capturing the spacious, colourful, odd world of Wonka's chocolate factory within the menus. Special features on the DVD include a selection of featurettes, including one about the squirrels (live, animatronic and otherwise), one about Deep Roy and his role(s) as an Oompa-Loompa, as well as an interesting documentary on Roald Dahl. There are also a few games for the viewer to play, such as making your own candy concoction and getting the poor Oompa - Loompa to try it. You can get some pretty funny results. There is also a game called ""Find the Golden Ticket"" that involves playing each of the children, trying to get their golden ticket. Charlie's game is a point and click style of game where you have to find various odds and ends (like money for a chocolate bar). Veruca's game sees you sorting boxes. You get to feed Augustus in his game. Mike's game is probably the hardest. There is a tangle of highways, and you have to figure out which one the truck will go to. Once you beat all of these children's games, you are rewarded with an animatic (rough computer animated storyboard) of the ""Augustus Gloop"" song with all the Deep Roy Oompas. Some of those games were hard (particulary Mike's level), and I didn't think this animatic was much of a reward! With the first Harry Potter film, you get seven deleted scenes for completing the main menu game, and that game was a fair bit easier than this one!Speaking of games, if you have a DVD ROM drive on your PC, you will be treated to a demo of the ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" video game, which is kind of fun.It's all worth a look, but I definitely prefer 1971 film.",3,Not As Sweet As I'd

J.""","[3, 7]","The original 1971 movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is still the best version, especially since author Roald Dahl wrote the script.  Any deviations he made from his book must be okay because he allowed it to happen.In the original, Gene Wilder, captured the eccentricity of Willy Wonka with a bit of warmth and whimsy.  Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricity in typical cooky Tim Burton fashion.  While Wilder's Wonka was no big fan of the four naughty brats, he was never mean to them, even when they learned their lessons the hard way.  The worthy child left standing would make himself known.  Depp's Wonka seemed as if he designed to elminate the ones he didn't like. That just bugged me. A man wanting to keep his vision alive with the right child shouldn't seem so hasty to produce a winner.Another flaw of the new version are the kids that were cast.  One exception is the role of Charlie.  I actually prefer Freddie Highmore.  The brats in the new movie were weaker versions of their original counterparts.  Varuca Salt is my favorite.  She truly was a loud, impatient and indignant spoiled brat.  The newer Varuca Salt didn't seem that bratty at all.  I mean, a band named themselves after her.  They wouldn't do so if she wasn't so memorable.  Even worse were the parents's reactions to their naughty children's mischeviousness.  In the original, the parents actually freaked out as concerned parents would.  In the newer version, the parents just idly watched, mouth agape, barely uttering a word as if they were just going with the flow.Boat scene in the new version:  LAME!  The original was far more memorable. It's the scene we all think of when we you mention ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".Oompa Loompas in the original and their songs...better.  Enough said.Finally, what was the point of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood?  Completely unncessary.Despite all that, the film exhibited true Tim Burton style and aesthetics.

938935,A17IW44FV0HUTY,B000BB1MHS,Glen Engel Cox,"[0, 0]","The first third of this movie, where you meet poor little Charlie Bucket and his family in their dilipidated home, where they are so poor that his grandparents sleep in one bed by the fire, head to toe, is so nearly perfect and straight from the novel by Roald Dahl that I actually got tense as Charlie would open each candy bar and still not find that golden ticket. The disgusting children around the world finding those tickets were spot-on as well, including the best update whatsover in the movie, where Mike Teavee, who in the book dresses as a cowboy and shoots his toy gun at the TV screen, is translated into an expert videogamer playing a Quake-like game while being interviewed.Of course, perfection when it comes to translating a movie from book to screen is something rarely achieved, and I should be grateful for even that first third. Because as soon as Willy Wonka greets the children, the flaw in this movie becomes all-too-readily apparent: Tim Burton repeats the mistake he made in the first Batman film by putting a famous actor in the lead role who doesn't so much play the role as he plays himself playing the role. In Batman, it was Jack Nicholson who couldn't see the movie because of his own greasepaint; here, it's Johnny Depp, who looks the part, but plays it with more ticks than Big Ben. Sometimes, as in Nicholson's Joker, it's funny--but the problem is that it is distracting from the story, and the story should be king.After his introduction, and we start the actual tour of the factory where the children show their true colors, we get back to the story, but every once and awhile Burton highlights Wonka again, with the addition of flashbacks to Wonka's own childhood that are not from the book and were totally unnecessary to the plot.On the plus side, Burton uses Dahl's lyrics for the songs that the Oompa Loompas sing about the bad children. Unfortunately, the songs are so overproduced in both sound (a typically Danny Elfman-type error with movie music--it was fine when he was in a rock band, but in a movie, you only get once chance to hear the lyrics and having the music overwhelm them defeats the purpose of having lyrics) and visuals (the Oompa Loompas are one man, digitally reproduced, and in the dance numbers this becomes so apparant that instead of enjoying the visuals, you are distracted by noticing the filmmaking).All in all, I liked the movie, for when Burton gets it right, such as when the squirrels decide the Veruca Salt is a very bad nut, it captures the book perfectly. I'm just saddened that Burton (or the studio?) felt that they had to insert differences from the book. Danny deVito's Matilda remains the best adaptation of Dahl from book to screen, and that's because he didn't waver from the book, in large part due to his children threatening him that doing so would make them very, very mad. I guess Burton didn't have that type of editor.",4,Flawed perfection,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2909,"['first', 'third', 'movie', 'where', 'meet', 'poor', 'little', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'family', 'dilipidated', 'home', 'where', 'are', 'so', 'poor', 'grandparents', 'sleep', 'one', 'bed', 'fire', 'head', 'toe', 'so', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'straight', 'novel', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'actually', 'got', 'tense', 'Charlie', 'would', 'open', 'candy', 'bar', 'still', 'not', 'find', 'golden', 'ticket', 'disgusting', 'children', 'world', 'finding', 'tickets', 'were', 'spot-on', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'best', 'update', 'whatsover', 'movie', 'where', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'who', 'book', 'cowboy', 'shoots', 'toy', 'gun', 'TV', 'screen', 'translated', 'expert', 'videogamer', 'playing', 'Quake-like', 'game', 'being', 'interviewed.Of', 'course', 'perfection', 'when', 'translating', 'movie', 'book', 'screen', 'something', 'rarely', 'achieved', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'even', 'first', 'third', 'as', 'soon', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'children', 'flaw', 'movie', 'all-too-readily', 'apparent', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'mistake', 'made', 'first', 'Batman', 'film', 'putting', 'famous', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'who', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'role', 'playing', 'role', 'Batman', 'was', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'own', 'greasepaint', 'here', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'part', 'more', 'ticks', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Sometimes', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'funny', 'problem', 'distracting', 'story', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'king.After', 'introduction', 'start', 'actual', 'tour', 'factory', 'where', 'children', 'show', 'true', 'colors', 'get', 'back', 'story', 'once', 'awhile', 'Burton', 'highlights', 'Wonka', 'again', 'addition', 'flashbacks', 'Wonka', 'own', 'childhood', 'are', 'not', 'book', 'were', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'plot.On', 'plus', 'side', 'Burton', 'Dahl', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'sing', 'bad', 'children', 'Unfortunately', 'songs', 'are', 'so', 'overproduced', 'sound', 'typically', 'Danny', 'Elfman-type', 'error', 'movie', 'music', 'was', 'fine', 'when', 'was', 'rock', 'band', 'movie', 'only', 'get', 'once', 'chance', 'hear', 'lyrics', 'having', 'music', 'purpose', 'having', 'lyrics', 'visuals', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'are', 'one', 'man', 'digitally', 'reproduced', 'dance', 'numbers', 'so', 'apparant', 'instead', 'enjoying', 'visuals', 'are', 'distracted', 'noticing', 'filmmaking', '.All', 'liked', 'movie', 'when', 'Burton', 'right', 'such', 'when', 'squirrels', 'decide', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'very', 'bad', 'nut', 'book', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'just', 'saddened', 'Burton', 'studio', 'felt', 'had', 'insert', 'differences', 'book', 'Danny', 'deVito', 'Matilda', 'best', 'adaptation', 'Dahl', 'book', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'waver', 'book', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'children', 'threatening', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'make', 'very', 'very', 'mad', 'guess', 'Burton', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'type', 'editor']",N/A

Why? Depp's ""performance"" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.

The amount of differences were about the same for each movie.I think Gene Wilder made a more believeable Wonka than Depp did. The whole time I was watching I thought Depp had a mental defect. I swear it seemed like he was on something the way he was acting. Don't get me wrong, I like Johnny Depp in other movies, just not this one.

Everything was much better than the original, which I still like an awful lot, and very wisely he only had the Oompa Loompas' sing in this version, with Danny Elfman's voice no less!I didn't think everything was perfect however. Burton obviously can't help but add scenes like the Automated Puppets bursting into flame and showing oh too loving closeups of the resulting mutilations which, If I were six or seven, would have made me hate the film as a whole.I also think that if you could transplant Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka from the first version into this version, it would make the movie even more enjoyable. Wilder captured that mad quality Wonka had in the book, sly, mischievous, but not too mean or nasty. I do have to applaud Johnny Depp, though.

But this one I was quite satisfied with.This version of the story can stand on its own, because Tim Burton did not attempt to simply ""copy"" the original.  He mostly stuck to the book, with a few changes.  Johnny Depp had me laughing hysterically throughout the movie.  Sure, he may seem to be over-acting at points, but that's part of what makes it funny.  My first reaction to seeing pictures of him was like many others: it's Michael Jackson.  But you forget all about that in the movie.  I could almost picture Paul Rubens (Pee-Wee Herman) playing Willy Wonka; at some parts I was almost expecting Johnny Depp to let out a Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  I really enjoyed how we got sort of a side-story of Mr. Wonka's childhood through a series of flashbacks.  And while I won't give details about the ending, it is slightly different from the way the original film and the book end.  So, while we all mostly know what is going to happen throughout the film, we don't know exactly what the people (mostly Willy Wonka) are going to say, making the movie not-so-predictable.There were a few things that I didn't like, of course.  First, while many of the CGI effects were great, some felt like they were incomplete, or not detailed enough.  But maybe Tim Burton wanted them to seem a bit cartoonish.  Second, some parts of the movie feel sort of rushed.  Like finding the Golden Tickets.  We see Charlie and his family watching the news about Augustus Gloop finding the first ticket, then right away, we see Veruca, so it's like the tickets are all found right away.  This also happens while the people are in the factory; they enter the chocolate room, and before you know it, they're on the boat, then on to the inventing room, and so on.  So the kids keep disappearing so fast that we hardly get to know them.I really didn't mind the Oompa Loompa songs as much as some people.  The first one reminds me just a little bit of ""Lavida-Loca"".  The main thing I didn't like about them is that you can hardly understand what is being said, making them not-so-memorable.The original film with Gene Wilder will always be my favorite, but this one was very enjoyable as well.  I know some people feel that a re-make just wasn't necessary and don't see why it was made, but think, when you were young, didn't you ever watch a movie and imagine making that movie yourself?

I've seen both movies and I can honestly say that, while the screenwriter made some changes (including-SPOILER!!!-expanding the original ending to include an important message about family-SPOILER OVER!!!), they help, rather than hurt the film and do not detract from the novel in any way. In his third family movie, Johnny Depp (""Finding Neverland,"" ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl"") plays the lovable chocolate maker with indelible charm. Freddie Highmore, Depp's co-star in ""Finding Neverland,"" is a joy as Charlie Bucket. The other child actors are supported by an A-list adult cast which includes David Kelly (""October Sky""), Helena Bonham-Carter (Franco Z.'s misguided ""Hamlet,"" Kenneth Branagh's excellent film version of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"" TV's ""Merlin,"" the upcoming ""Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix""), Noah Taylor and horror master Christopher Lee (Sir Laurence Olivier's masterful version of ""Hamlet,"" the 1958 film version of ""Dracula,"" the James Bond adventure ""The Man With The Golden Gun,"" the 1973 version of ""The Three Musketeers"" and its two sequels, ""STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" and ""STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"").

M Pyles,"[8, 10]","The real star of this story is not the quasi-humans who populate its color-saturated Dali-esque landscape, but the candy around whom their lives center.  It becomes the central metaphor around which all the good and bad strains of modern life gather to compete for dominance.Willy Wonka is raised by a dentist-father intent on making his son the embodiment of the father's view of perfection -- a perfect set of teeth.  Driven to physical and emotional humiliation by this quest, Willy develops an obsessive craving for the one thing that would most undermine that goal -- candy.This obsession spawns a genius in Willy for inventing candies like no other -- candies with magical properties of taste, shape, texture, and longevity.  But in Willy's success with his obsession lie the seeds of his undoing.  The world of unimaginative capitalists deploys its spies to steal Willy's secrets and turn the magic of his candy into a commodity available on every block at a cut-rate price.  This leaves Willy with the world's biggest candy factory on his hands and nothing to do with it.With the light of Willy's fame and genius faded to an ember, he looks to find another to rekindle the flame.  The only possibility lies with a child, as only a child can grasp the illogical wonders of candy and proceed, as Willy once did, with inventing things adults know to be unattainable.  The problem is that modern childhood offers a pretty pitiful field for producing such a child.Candy becomes the icon around which this unseemly array of children gather.  One child can see in candy only the means of satisfying his gluttony.  For another Willy's candy represents the insistence on having the best of everything; cost, fairness and consideration of the rights and feelings of others be damned.  Another child finds visiting Willy's factory to be just another highly-publicized stage upon which she and her stage-mom mother can demonstrate her ability to out-compete anyone at anything.  Yet another child sees in candy only an opportunity to apply his scientific acumen and analytic incredulity to debunking the mystique of something too many kids have approached too uncritically.  Only one child -- Charlie -- can still feel the wonder of candy and of Willy's quest.  But Charlie's a good-hearted kid with a family so mired in poverty that he cannot bear the thought of putting his own childlike desires ahead of their needs.But Willy, who is demonically willing to put the lives of these miscreant children at stake right before their parent's confused eyes, is not daunted as he plows on with his quest to find the least unsuitable child to carry on his legacy.  As the title leads one to assume, Charlie emerges the most likely candidate.  But late in the game, Charlie throws Willy a curve ball which leaves Willy with a more difficult task than fobbing off his chocolate factory.  Willy must confront the demons of his childhood and, at long last, grow up.In the end, it all comes to rights . . . except for four now very deformed children who paid quite a price for their visit to Willy's chocolate factory.But Willy wins.  Charlie wins.  Candy wins.  This is one very, very strange movie from a quirky director, using this generation's oddest actor to tell a story penned by a children's author most parents might want to read thoroughly before letting his books fall into the hands of their tykes.But it's great fun . . . in a very colorful, unsettling way.",4,And You Thought Cavities Were Bad . . . .,1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3455,"['real', 'star', 'story', 'not', 'quasi-humans', 'who', 'populate', 'color-saturated', 'Dali-esque', 'landscape', 'candy', 'whom', 'lives', 'center', 'central', 'metaphor', 'good', 'bad', 'strains', 'modern', 'life', 'gather', 'compete', 'dominance.Willy', 'Wonka', 'raised', 'dentist-father', 'intent', 'making', 'son', 'embodiment', 'father', 'view', 'perfection', 'perfect', 'set', 'teeth', 'Driven', 'physical', 'emotional', 'humiliation', 'quest', 'Willy', 'obsessive', 'craving', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'most', 'undermine', 'goal', 'candy.This', 'obsession', 'genius', 'Willy', 'inventing', 'candies', 'other', 'candies', 'magical', 'properties', 'taste', 'shape', 'texture', 'longevity', 'Willy', 'success', 'obsession', 'seeds', 'undoing', 'world', 'unimaginative', 'capitalists', 'spies', 'steal', 'Willy', 'secrets', 'turn', 'magic', 'candy', 'commodity', 'available', 'block', 'cut-rate', 'price', 'Willy', 'world', 'biggest', 'candy', 'factory', 'hands', 'nothing', 'do', 'it.With', 'light', 'Willy', 'fame', 'genius', 'faded', 'ember', 'find', 'rekindle', 'flame', 'only', 'possibility', 'child', 'only', 'child', 'can', 'grasp', 'illogical', 'wonders', 'candy', 'proceed', 'Willy', 'once', 'did', 'inventing', 'things', 'adults', 'know', 'be', 'unattainable', 'problem', 'modern', 'childhood', 'pretty', 'pitiful', 'field', 'producing', 'child.Candy', 'icon', 'unseemly', 'array', 'children', 'gather', 'One', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'candy', 'only', 'means', 'satisfying', 'gluttony', 'Willy', 'candy', 'insistence', 'having', 'best', 'everything', 'cost', 'fairness', 'consideration', 'rights', 'feelings', 'others', 'be', 'damned', 'child', 'visiting', 'Willy', 'factory', 'be', 'just', 'highly-publicized', 'stage', 'stage-mom', 'mother', 'can', 'demonstrate', 'ability', 'out-compete', 'anyone', 'anything', 'child', 'candy', 'only', 'opportunity', 'apply', 'scientific', 'acumen', 'analytic', 'incredulity', 'debunking', 'mystique', 'something', 'too', 'many', 'kids', 'have', 'approached', 'too', 'uncritically', 'Only', 'one', 'child', 'Charlie', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'wonder', 'candy', 'Willy', 'quest', 'Charlie', 'good-hearted', 'kid', 'family', 'so', 'mired', 'poverty', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'thought', 'putting', 'own', 'childlike', 'ahead', 'needs.But', 'Willy', 'who', 'demonically', 'willing', 'put', 'lives', 'miscreant', 'children', 'stake', 'right', 'parent', 'confused', 'eyes', 'not', 'daunted', 'quest', 'find', 'least', 'unsuitable', 'child', 'carry', 'legacy', 'title', 'one', 'assume', 'Charlie', 'most', 'likely', 'candidate', 'late', 'game', 'Charlie', 'Willy', 'curve', 'ball', 'Willy', 'more', 'difficult', 'task', 'fobbing', 'off', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'Willy', 'must', 'confront', 'demons', 'childhood', 'long', 'last', 'grow', 'end', 'rights', 'four', 'now', 'very', 'deformed', 'children', 'who', 'paid', 'quite', 'price', 'visit', 'Willy', 'chocolate', 'factory.But', 'Willy', 'Charlie', 'Candy', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'strange', 'movie', 'quirky', 'director', 'using', 'generation', 'oddest', 'actor', 'tell', 'story', 'penned', 'children', 'author', 'most', 'parents', 'might', 'want', 'read', 'thoroughly', 'letting', 'books', 'fall', 'hands', 'tykes.But', 'great', 'fun', 'very', 'colorful', 'unsettling', 'way']",N/A

It is very loyal to the original story and the scenery is outstanding. If you are a Tim Burton fan, you will love this film and will definitely want to own this deluxe-edition dvd. The special features are kind of neat. My daughter is a fan of the ""Learn to dance like an Oompa-Loompa"" part. :)While the old movie focused mainly on songs and being cute, this new version really went right along with the book. Don't get me wrong, I like the old movie, but this one is just so much better. I've read the book at least four times now and it is THIS movie that is accurate to the book and that's pretty much why I like it best. Well, that and the fact that Johnny Depp is in it. :)In this movie, the children who are cast as the ""rotten kids"" are perfect for their parts and really fit one's mental image of what these kids should look like. The best of these, I'd say, had to be Augustus, who was shoving candy into his face faster than his arms could go. Even my five-year-old was pretty disgusted by him and that's saying a lot, if you've ever seen any of the little boys in her class eat.The only disturbing thing about this movie, however, were the Oompa-Loompas. Yep, there was only one guy playing the part, which was probably the only downfall of the film. The fact that the Oompa-Loompas had a very striking resemblance to my husband's ex-girlfriend was the thing that kinda freaked me out (we both looked at each other when we saw this one in the theater; why was his ex dressed up as an oompa-loompa? It was a strange night).In my opinion, this is Johnny Depp's best performance since ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and that's saying a lot (I LOVED him as a pirate!).

Depp deftly captures Willie Wonka and Burton creates a vivid set of images of the novella, but the movie looked too much like a picture book and failed to create the tension and thrill of the story the way the original version with Gene Wilder did. This movie is amazingly somber and dull, with the characters walking gingerly over the sets, afraid it seems to touch the world Burton has created.  He turns each scene carefully over, like one would do in a pop-out children's book.

938960,A3RO6CB4EU8DRA,B000BB1MHS,James Head,"[4, 5]","There is no doubt that Tim Burton has a penchant for things that are eccentric and sometimes plain creepy.  This isn't a bad thing, however -- as he demonstrates in CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, being different can be fun and quite exciting.For starters, the film has special effects and visuals that anyone would marvel at.  From the opening sequence onward, the viewer is awestruck at the Factory itself, the town below, and the sharp distinction made between these places and Charlie's little house.  The lighting is superb and the music is magnificent, making for a delectable opening sequence.  Grandpa Joe's storytelling then ensues with rich, vibrant colors and amazing scenery.As the action continues and kids begin finding Wonka's Golden Tickets, we are introduced in turn to the winners (plus parents) and each of their peculiar quirks.  By the time the children end up in the Factory, we are formally introduced to Wonka himself -- a wonderfully odd, zany, and weird character in his own right (played beautifully by Depp).The Factory tour consumes much of the rest of the film and accounts for a considerable amount of wackiness.  The verdant Candy Meadow, the River of Chocolate (plus the Waterfall!), and many other gorgeous locales await the viewer.  Each has its own peculiarities, but the adventure never stops as the group treks through the Factory, finding excitement and humor around every corner.At the end of the day, this film radiates with Burton's creative talents.  I agree, however, that it is not for all ages.  Even some adults will be taken aback by the film's eccentricities, so letting really small kids watch it first might be reconsidered.  Keep in mind, however, that the wackiness is the only reason why this might be said -- the film is clean, fresh, and appropriate for children and adults (particularly the young at heart!).My suggestion:  Let your mind go and relax as you take in the wild world of Willy Wonka.  And, if you have the chance, see this film in IMAX -- the true surround sound and size of the screen make it an unbelievable experience.

Or did I eat so much sugar that I went on a trip through the brain of a psychotic eight year old child?Storyline: Jameson ThottamLet's open with the general storyline for the people who haven't happened to read the book or see the original film.Charlie bucket is dirt poor. He and his family live in a small shack on the outskirts of town and the only thing he has to look foreward to each year, is one bar of chocolate on his birthday. It is truly pitiful, poor kid. So when he hears of a contest awarding five children the chance to tour the mysterious chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka himself, Charlie decides he wants to win.After all five golden tickets are discovered in bars of Wonka's chocolate, and through some miracle that only happens in the land of movies, Charlie gets one too, the story takes off.The kids tour the factory alongside Wonka with the promise of a huge reward at the end for only one of them. As we watch the truly loathesome kiddies spit, fight, bicker, gorge, chew their cud and tumble headfirst down garbage chutes, we wonder why Wonka bothered in the first place.Analysis: Jameson Luke ThottamAs predictable as it is, I won't give away who...if anyone...wins the contest. I will however, tell you that Tim Burton tried far too hard to insert a meaningful life lesson into a movie that clearly has no meaning what-so-ever.New Version COre: Jameson ThottamThe new version has the same core as the original movie, and seems to stay truer to the book. However, it adds something a little more. Willy Wonka has regular flashbacks, a la war vet., about his childhood. I believe it is meant to make us understand why he is the way he is, and why he does the things he does. I couldn't follow this at all and just ended up wondering why Wonka thinks that being denied a few sweets here and there makes his childhood traumatic.Ooompa Oopsy: Jameson ThottamThe Oompa Loompas were played by the same man. He was incredibly odd looking and sounded hilarious. I would have liked to have seen the original songs revamped for the new film, instead of the writers just coming up with whole new ones.Shallow but Thanks to Johnny: Jameson L. ThottamIt's a bit shallow overall. Johnny Depp was brilliant as Willy Wonka, though he reeked a little of Michael Jackson, but no harm, no foul. Annasophia Robb, for some reason, really caught my attention as the gum chewing Violet Baureguard. The other three children were forgettable, and Charlie was horribly drippy and cute. I couldn't stand how unbearably sweet he was. I know his character was meant to be considerate, but come on, he's a 10 year old boy!The colours, songs, dances, and strange CG work on the faces of the children, made the movie resemble a cartoon.Final Comments...Jameson ThottamRent the original and watch it first. If you don't enjoy it...don't bother going to see this one. If you do enjoy it, you'll probably enjoy this one far less, but may as well give it a go.Jameson Thottam",3,Jameson Thottam ...

We never really get to know any of the characters in the story in a deep or meaningful way. In fact, the children are presented so matter of factly that the viewer feels indifference toward their impending plight. Johnny Depp does a decent job as a somewhat dark, disturbed version of Willie Wonka. His quips to the children are funny but in most cases he is guilty of overacting. The best parts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are the flashbacks to Charlie's childhood. Here we learn about his father, Wilbur Wonka (played to perfection by Christopher Lee)  who is a dentist with an extreme dislike for any type of candy. The viewer also glimpses how Willie Wonka met and recruited the Oompa Loompa's to come and work in his factory which is an interesting side bar. I don't know, call me nostalgic but this version couldn't hold a candle to the original. Gene Wilder was absolute perfection and although Depp handles the role, this is clearly not one of his shining screen moments.

Finally, I was channel surfin and locked into this movie.Well, I really enjoyed the movie. Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka like Jim Carrey would. Somewhat exaggerated and silly, but very very funny. There were a number of comical scenes which made me giggle and there were enough of them to keep the viewer engaged (notice all the Umpa-loompas are the same guy--even the office lady!). Although, I have to say the scene of eating worms was totally uncalled for, especially for a children movie. One suggestion for improvement is adding closed captions for the lyrics sung by the Umpa-loompas. It was very hard to understand what they were saying.While the old version by Wilder did not have too much psychology involved, this version had plenty of it. For example, we can better understand what motivated Willy Wonka to be the best Chocolatier in the world when he had flashbacks to his unhappy childhood. Also, the bratty children showed mature acting when they really oozed out vicious attitudes towards each other (competing to be selected by Wonka). Funny, a 10-year-old (?) kid displaying such competitive behavior and playing politics of backstabbing just like adults in the office. The movie seems to suggest the evilness of adults already start at the tender age of youth, unless they are well raised and educated to be a good person.",4,"Fun movie to watch, but some scenes too gross for kids.",1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,1456,"['reading', 'number', 'negative', 'reviews', 'web', 'critiques', 'stayed', 'away', 'film', 'years', 'Finally', 'was', 'channel', 'surfin', 'locked', 'movie.Well', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'played', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'would', 'Somewhat', 'exaggerated', 'silly', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'were', 'number', 'comical', 'scenes', 'made', 'giggle', 'were', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'Umpa-loompas', 'are', 'same', 'guy', 'even', 'office', 'lady', 'have', 'say', 'scene', 'eating', 'worms', 'was', 'totally', 'uncalled', 'especially', 'children', 'movie', 'One', 'suggestion', 'improvement', 'adding', 'closed', 'captions', 'lyrics', 'sung', 'Umpa-loompas', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'understand', 'what', 'were', 'saying.While', 'old', 'version', 'Wilder', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'psychology', 'involved', 'version', 'had', 'plenty', 'example', 'can', 'better', 'understand', 'what', 'motivated', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'be', 'best', 'Chocolatier', 'world', 'when', 'had', 'flashbacks', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'Also', 'bratty', 'children', 'showed', 'mature', 'acting', 'when', 'really', 'oozed', 'out', 'vicious', 'attitudes', 'other', 'competing', 'be', 'selected', 'Wonka', 'Funny', '10-year-old', 'kid', 'displaying', 'such', 'competitive', 'behavior', 'playing', 'politics', 'backstabbing', 'just', 'adults', 'office', 'movie', 'suggest', 'evilness', 'adults', 'already', 'start', 'tender', 'age', 'youth', 'are', 'well', 'raised', 'educated', 'be', 'good', 'person']",N/A

938969,A1DK1YCVCXE6Q4,B000BB1MHS,J. Deferbrache,"[0, 1]","This new version of the famous Willy Wonka story is fun and interesting despite its flaws. Fans of Tim Burton will recognize his distinct, gothic style and fantastical soundtrack from the very beginning of the film. His love of special effects is here as well, but unlike some modern day movies (ex. the very sad new Star Wars trilogy), Burton's effects never take center stage to the story. The movie's real strength is in the first forty minutes or so when we meet Charlie Bucket and his poor, but gentle and loving family. It is here that the heart of the movie truly lies and the part which is most accomidating to younger audience members, thus earning the movie's title as ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" rather than the previously named 1971 film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""Once the movie moves toward Willy Wonka and the tour through his enormous factory, the dark undertone that the story has held since its conception is taken up a notch. If the 1971 movie did not creep you out as a child (as it did me) then this one is a sure-fire gaurentee. For one, Johnny Deep's Willy Wonka bare's such and obvious resemblance to Michael Jackson that it is truly difficult to believe Johnny Depp's denial of Jackson's inspiration for the character. From his pale skin and clothing fetishes to his reclusive lifestyle in an enormous playland to childhood issues with an estranged father, Wonka so resembles Jackson that one feels genuinely uneasy and concerned for Charlie Bucket when the two of them form a close (and unsupervised) relationship at the end of the movie. In spite of this, however, fans of Depp who appreciate his accentric and imaginative movie career will be able to appreciate and even laugh along with his bizaare portrayel.The most interesting and surreal aspect of the movie of course is the creation of the Oompa Lumpas, played by Deep Roy multiplied by a hundred in a special effects miracle. The extravegent song and dance numbers of the small and somewhat creepy Oompa Lumpas, combined with Depp's bizaare and over the top peformance, earn this movie the adjective ""trippy,"" all the more enhanced by the goofy, yet frightening fates of the ""naughty children"" (these include getting stuck in a chocolate pipe, turning into a giant blueberry, getting thrown into an incinerator by murderous squirrels, and being shrunk to the size of a candy bar in a freak television transmission accident). Therefore if you are not a child, but still enjoy dooby-enhanced mind trip or generally odd, Alice-in-Wonderland-esque stories, then you will find interest in this movie. The movie of course, is suitable for children, but can also entertain (with both light and dark humor) adults. Still, if you have an especially squeemish or sensative child, you might want to leave him or her at home and check it out yourself.",4,Inspiring to the Imagination and fun for both kids and adults,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2846,"['new', 'version', 'famous', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'story', 'fun', 'interesting', 'flaws', 'Fans', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'will', 'recognize', 'distinct', 'gothic', 'style', 'fantastical', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'love', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'modern', 'day', 'movies', 'ex', 'very', 'sad', 'new', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'Burton', 'effects', 'never', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'story', 'movie', 'real', 'strength', 'first', 'forty', 'minutes', 'so', 'when', 'meet', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'poor', 'gentle', 'loving', 'family', 'here', 'heart', 'movie', 'truly', 'part', 'most', 'accomidating', 'younger', 'audience', 'members', 'thus', 'earning', 'movie', 'title', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'rather', 'previously', 'named', '1971', 'film', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'movie', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'tour', 'enormous', 'factory', 'dark', 'undertone', 'story', 'held', 'conception', 'taken', 'up', 'notch', '1971', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'creep', 'out', 'child', 'did', 'then', 'one', 'sure-fire', 'gaurentee', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Deep', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'bare', 'such', 'obvious', 'resemblance', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'truly', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'denial', 'Jackson', 'inspiration', 'character', 'pale', 'skin', 'clothing', 'fetishes', 'reclusive', 'lifestyle', 'enormous', 'playland', 'childhood', 'issues', 'estranged', 'father', 'Wonka', 'resembles', 'Jackson', 'one', 'feels', 'genuinely', 'uneasy', 'concerned', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'when', 'two', 'form', 'close', 'unsupervised', 'relationship', 'end', 'movie', 'spite', 'however', 'fans', 'Depp', 'who', 'appreciate', 'accentric', 'imaginative', 'movie', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'even', 'bizaare', 'most', 'interesting', 'surreal', 'aspect', 'movie', 'course', 'creation', 'Oompa', 'Lumpas', 'played', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'multiplied', 'hundred', 'special', 'effects', 'miracle', 'extravegent', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'small', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'Oompa', 'Lumpas', 'combined', 'Depp', 'bizaare', 'top', 'peformance', 'earn', 'movie', 'adjective', 'trippy', 'more', 'enhanced', 'goofy', 'yet', 'frightening', 'fates', 'naughty', 'children', 'include', 'getting', 'stuck', 'chocolate', 'pipe', 'turning', 'giant', 'blueberry', 'getting', 'thrown', 'incinerator', 'murderous', 'squirrels', 'being', 'shrunk', 'size', 'candy', 'bar', 'freak', 'television', 'transmission', 'accident', 'Therefore', 'are', 'not', 'child', 'still', 'enjoy', 'dooby-enhanced', 'mind', 'trip', 'generally', 'odd', 'Alice-in-Wonderland-esque', 'stories', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'interest', 'movie', 'movie', 'course', 'suitable', 'children', 'can', 'also', 'entertain', 'light', 'dark', 'humor', 'adults', 'Still', 'have', 'especially', 'squeemish', 'sensative', 'child', 'might', 'want', 'leave', 'home', 'check', 'out']",N/A
938970,A259W5KIP41XFL,B000BB1MHS,Jennifer A. Everhart,"[6, 8]","Hi, everybody. I'm back. And I am going to compare the two film adaptations of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", one of Roald Dahl's novels. The original from 1971 directed by Mel Stuart is known as ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", while the new one from 2005 directed by Tim Burton has the same name as the book. There have been people who compared the new one unfavorably to the original, thinking of it as another half-baked remake, like that of the over-budgeted & over-hyped Planet of the Apes remake that Burton also directed, but there are others like me that beg to differ. After all, it is NOT a remake of a classic movie, but another film adaptation of a classic book. Here is my comparison between the two in my personal opinion.First off, let's compare the depictions of Willy Wonka in both movies. Even though Johnny Depp gave a weird, creepy, and decent performance of Wonka like in the books, no one can beat the delightful, charming, and friendly Gene Wilder. From Depp's portrayal in the new one, Wonka shows disdain for families as a disadvantage on fulfilling your dreams because his dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka (Christopher Lee) deprives Willy of candy due to risks to the teeth. More details later in the review. Does that happen in the original? NO! In the end, Wonka brings in the rest of Charlie's family in the first place. He was also more concerned for the others in the old one as well. I have also seen better Johnny Depp performances from Edward Scizzorhands, Benny and Joon, and the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, for example. No offense.Now for the supporting cast of both films. They vary in terms of advantages and disadvantages. the five Golden Ticket finders, Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee (yeah, I know, a silly pun), and Charlie Bucket were noticeably older in the original, but were younger in the book and new one. Veruca seemed more spoiled and grumpy in the original. In the newer film, Augustus was more of a pig and bites his ticket for comic relief, Violet processes Martial Arts skills, and Mike is smarter when it comes to technology and shows a dislike for chocolate (PPPHHHTTT!). Charlie and his family seem more poor and his father (Noah Taylor) was alive like in the book. In the book, the Golden Ticket winners could bring one or two relatives to look after you. In the films, it was reduced to just one to keep the budgets under control. So, I would give the new one the win overall.Next up is the music department. Let's discuss the songs. The songs of the original were memorable and original, while those of the newer one were catchy and loyal to the book. To be fair, I had a little difficulty remembering the lyrics when I first saw the new film, so I looked them up on the internet and read the book. The only exception is the annoying introduction song before the puppet set catches on fire and the music distorts (now that's funny). Sorry, new Carlie, even though your songs are catchy, I have to give the original the win because of it having more songs with an Oscar nomination. In terms of the score, however, the new one by Danny Elfman was more catchy and suits the film like a glove, and when it comes to Elfman's other scores, let's say I came to expect that. So yeah, the new version wins in the score, but let's face it, in musicals like these, the songs are usually the main focus, so I'll give the original the win to be fair.It seems that one common aspect that remakes improve over the original is the visual effects. In the original, some of the candy pumpkins were obviously balloons, the chocolate river looks like a YooHoo drink, you can barely see the tube connected to Violet's suit when she becomes a humanoid blueberry, and it features the infamous demon tunnel from Hell. The visuals of the newer film were more refined and advanced. The river actually looks like chocolate, everything looks more real, the Great Glass Elevator is made entirely out of glass, and the tunnel is more of a park ride instead of a freak-out (thank god). The new film wins on the effects by a long shot.Last, but not least, let's talk about the plot, the aspect that matters the most. The premise is the same. It is about a poor boy named Charlie Bucket, who is a big fan-boy of Willy Wonka. Wonka decodes to hold a competition to search for five golden tickets hidden in five Wonka bars and the winners would gain access to the factory for a tour and a chance to win a lifetime supply of chocolate. I already discussed the ticket winners in the supporting cast section. The greedy kids would mess up and end up in a horrific fate. Augustus would fall into the Chocolate river and get sucked up by a pipe, Violet would try Wonka's meal gum and become a blueberry, Veruca gets ambushed by squirrels and dropped down the garbage chute like a bad nut (falls down a trap door in the Golden Goose room like a bad egg in the original during her musical number), and Mike tests himself for a television project like the giant candy bar and becomes tiny. All that leaving the room for Charlie to win the factory as Wonka's successor. The plot in the new one is more in depth. It is closer to the source material in terms of main premise and tone, but has its share of minor changes as well. For example, the subplot on Wonka's troubled past is original to explain his origins and keep things fresh. The events of the past when Wonka went downhill thanks to spies stealing his secret recipies were also shown and features a bit with Prince Pondicherry and the chocolate palace that melted into a giant chocolate puddle on a hot day. Like the book, it shows what happened to the other contenders. Augustus seemed a little thinner and covered in chocolate and apparently fused with it. Gee, does that sound familiar at all? Violet became more flexible and still blue. Veruca and her father are covered in garbage and Mike was overstretched by the taffy puller. Also in the new one, continuing from Willy's past, while helping clean the fireplace while his father was busy with a patient, he finds a piece of chocolate that missed the fire, tastes it, and was hooked. He goes on a journey of knowledge about candy. When his father disapproves of this, Willy leaves for Switzerland with his mother to follow his dreams. He sees that his old home disappeared when he went to stay with a neighbor for the night. Willy goes to see his father with Charlie and it was revealed that he showed remorse for his actions since he had a ton of media from Willy's fame. Willy learns the true value of family and still took care of his teeth and Wilbur learned to accept his son for who he is. Another key difference is like in the book, Charlie and Grandpa Joe do not mess up! It's just more straightforward and knows what it wants to be.In conclusion, even though I loved both of these movies, I enjoyed the new one a little more (3-2), mainly because of a more developed plot and was more similar to the book. Congratulations, Tim Burton, on another job well done! I also did a survey at my school one time on both films, and the original received the most votes from adults, and that is understandable because it was probably the one they grew up with. If you are like me, I would check them both out. They are worthy additions to add to your movie collection.

938972,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000BB1MHS,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[8, 12]","I know I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't jumping up and down about this movie. I loved the book as a child and loved the original film with Gene Wilder for its own original contributions...perhaps I'm biased. Still, I have always admired Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's work, and had been looking forward to this new interpretation of Roald Dahl's book.This film was, indeed, more true to the book than the 1971 version...the squirrel room, the jungle scene, the children leaving the factory, perhaps a little ""wiser for the wear."" However, the character development of the 1971 version was MUCH better than here...you were actually given an opportunity to like or dislike each character, including Willy Wonka. I did think that Johnny Depp's portrayal of Wonka was more true to the book than Gene Wilder's...Willy Wonka is supposed to be quite childish and eccentric. However, I thought that this film's preoccupation with being true to the book caused it to overlook what is more important, which is to establish the intentions of each character. At least in the 1971 version, it's pretty clear what each character's intentions are...even if establishing some of these intentions requires a conspiracy involving ""Slugworth."" And though I haven't read the book in a very long time, I do NOT remember any details being given as to Willy Wonka's childhood...I thought these were unnecessary, distracting, and a waste of time. This energy could have been better spent on the children's' character development, in my opinion. This is, after all, supposed to be a story for and about children.The oompa loompas. It's true that they are physically portrayed accurately here more so than in the 1971 version, i.e. very small people and not midgets with orange skin and green hair. However, though the songs they sing here are true to the book, they are less charismatic than those of the 1971 film and sometimes seem over the top. Also, I didn't like that they were all clones of each other...I think that was a poor choice.Finally, I was appalled with the ending...this ties in with my previous comments re: Willy Wonka's childhood. It changed the whole idea behind the story itself, which is supposed to be (from my perspective) that people can overcome their hardships to have a happy and prosperous ending, as long as they're honest, selfless, and generous. This movie changes the whole theme of the story to one that emphasizes the importance of family over any kind of material wealth or prosperity. Both are perfectly good and legitimate themes, but my reading of the book left me with an impression that Roald Dahl was more concerned with the former theme than the latter. Accordingly then, this movie did not do the book justice in the most important and fundamental way, whereas the 1971 film was able to do so despite its shortcomings.

Here is how th intro to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory should have gone:Charlie goes to school. Out in the courtyard are about 20 bullies waiting for him. When Charlie arrives the bullies say ""Hey there he is. Let's get 'em"". A couple of bullies hold his arms back, and spread his legs apart. Then the remainding bullies line up to each give Charlie a swift kick in the jimmie. The camera starts off on the first kicker as his leg goes back, and quickly zooms in and pans up to Charlies face. You don't actually see the kicks, but you hear them, and you see Charlie shake. With each kick Freddie Highmore is making his stupid half-smile, and saying in a soft-British accent ""That's wonderful"".The next scene Charlie comes home from school, walking bow legged through the door. ""How was school?"" ask Charlie's mom. ""It was absolutely marvelous"" says a resilient Charlie as he shoves an icepack down his pants. Well anyway go clean up for your Birthday party.The next scene Charlie is blowing out the candles on his cake, when his mom says ""Oh Charlie, we have a surprise for you."" She pulls back a blanket and reveals a piniatta and about 20 baseball bats. ""We invited some of your friends from school over to play break the piniatta with"". Walking through the door are the same 20 bullies from school. As they walk in the house, the camera pans in on Charlie as he is silent, but has that same stupid half-smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, as if his face is suggesting that he's thinking ""This is great"". ""We'll just leave you boys alone to have some fun"" says Charlie's parents as they leave the room.The bullies now have Charlie held down again, as they are taking turns hitting him in the jimmy with baseball bats. Once again we don't see the hits, as the camera has panned to the outside of the house. But every few seconds we hear a thump sound, followed by a ""That's Scrumdiddlyumtpious"" and "" Hit me in my Wonkar Bar one more time"" from Charlie.",1,Charlie Sure does love his Crappy Life,1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,2141,"['anyone', 'else', 'catching', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'always', 'playing', 'role', 'poor', 'down-on-his-luck', 'kid', 'life', 'bigtime', 'always', 'happy', 'cheerful', 'Here', 'how', 'th', 'intro', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'Charlie', 'school', 'courtyard', 'are', '20', 'bullies', 'waiting', 'When', 'Charlie', 'bullies', 'say', 'Hey', 'Let', 'get', 'couple', 'bullies', 'hold', 'arms', 'back', 'spread', 'legs', 'apart', 'Then', 'remainding', 'bullies', 'line', 'up', 'give', 'Charlie', 'swift', 'kick', 'jimmie', 'camera', 'first', 'kicker', 'leg', 'back', 'quickly', 'zooms', 'pans', 'up', 'Charlies', 'face', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'kicks', 'hear', 'see', 'Charlie', 'shake', 'kick', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'making', 'stupid', 'half-smile', 'saying', 'soft-British', 'accent', 'wonderful', '.The', 'next', 'scene', 'Charlie', 'home', 'school', 'walking', 'bow', 'legged', 'door', 'How', 'was', 'school', 'Charlie', 'mom', 'was', 'absolutely', 'marvelous', 'resilient', 'Charlie', 'icepack', 'down', 'pants', 'Well', 'anyway', 'go', 'clean', 'up', 'Birthday', 'party.The', 'next', 'scene', 'Charlie', 'blowing', 'out', 'candles', 'cake', 'when', 'mom', 'Oh', 'Charlie', 'have', 'surprise', 'back', 'blanket', 'piniatta', '20', 'baseball', 'bats', 'invited', 'friends', 'school', 'play', 'break', 'piniatta', 'Walking', 'door', 'are', 'same', '20', 'bullies', 'school', 'walk', 'house', 'camera', 'Charlie', 'silent', 'same', 'stupid', 'half-smile', 'face', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'face', 'suggesting', 'thinking', 'great', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'boys', 'alone', 'have', 'fun', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'leave', 'room.The', 'bullies', 'now', 'have', 'Charlie', 'held', 'down', 'again', 'are', 'taking', 'turns', 'hitting', 'jimmy', 'baseball', 'bats', 'Once', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hits', 'camera', 'panned', 'outside', 'house', 'few', 'seconds', 'hear', 'thump', 'sound', 'followed', 'Scrumdiddlyumtpious', 'Hit', 'Wonkar', 'Bar', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'Charlie']",N/A

They are very familiar with the original version, as we have watched it many times.  It took me a while to ""get it"" so to speak, but when I did, something really weird happened.  Has Tim Burton figured out a way to send real physical euphoria through a movie screen?  I ask this because I left the theatre and could not stop laughing. I could not believe what I had just seen and that it was affecting me physically.  Mind you, in a very strange (but fun) way.  Let me put it this way, it's true, you can get ""high"" without drugs.  Of course this went completely over the heads of the kids so no worries there.The songs were so much fun that we immediatley went out and got the soundtrack!  Depp was very good.  The only strange thing is that he had this Michael Jackson thing going on.  By the time the euphoria hit, I did not care.  There is a sub-plot that is not in the original movie and a nice little story in itself.About the visuals...(I am laughing just writing this), just phenominal.  There was so much to look at and appreciate in this film.I went to see this knowing that I was going to hate it.  I put it off until the very last day it was at the theatre.

938979,A1Y29KE9G0I350,B000BB1MHS,J. L. Braswell,"[2, 2]","Though having unintentionally missed the film in theatres, I finally got to see Charlie And The Chocolate Factory on it's two disc deluxe edition DVD recently! I never have disliked a Tim Burton film, though I realize that his track record has it's overall ups and down.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film on nearly every level. Being the children's story that it is, I really appreciate the effort to use imagination while not bothering with credible reality at every turn. After all, this is a child's fantasy and doesn`t need to be weighted down with explanations for everything. The entire cast was perfect in every way. Johnny Depp, of course, turned in another very original and unique performance.  Really, what more can be said about this fine actor?Of course, the look of the film wasn't a disappointment. This film was visually reminiscent of Burton`s earlier works and succeeded for that very reason. . While I actually am one of the few to enjoy his version of Planet Of The Apes, that film does lack his overall visual signature that I so enjoy and comes across as the least impressive in Burton`s filmography. I love the fact that so much of what is seen in this film is actually real sets as opposed to CGI. Sadly, when CGI is used, it is kind of obvious to me. The opening credits are one such example of the blatantly awful looking animation, though Danny Elfman's score more than makes up for it.  Thankfully, these overdone CGI moments are few and far between.I have heard many opinions about the Oompa Loompas in the film as portrayed by actor Deep Roy, opinions that range from good to bad, but I honestly cannot understand why anybody would have a problem here. I thought the Oompas were a highlight of the film and I quite enjoyed their hilarity.  Deep Roy did an amazing job of performing all of the dances and singing all of the lyrics over and over multiple times for the complex visual effects required to pull off the ""Oompa effect"". I  also really enjoyed all of the creative songs they performed, put to a wide variety of differing styles  by composer Danny Elfman.  My favorite song was the first one we hear as gluttonous Augustus Gloop gets what's coming to him. Of interest to me was that the lyrics of the songs were straight out of Roald Dahl's book! I think that creating such different songs based on old monologues is amazing in and of itself.Another complaint I have heard about the film most commonly in reviews and such is the flashbacks concerning Willy Wonka's father. While this plotline was indeed created for the film, it didn't bother me in the least.  I do not feel that the inclusion of Willy's father in any way hampers the film. Christopher Lee plays Willy's father, and it is always pleasurable to watch this great actor do what he does best. I loved the surreal way these flashbacks were told as well, right down to how a particular building ""disappears"" completely. What did I say earlier about a child's imagination and not needing to adhere to reality? It was perfect! Anyhow, I thought the new material worked just fine and helped support the additional material at the end of the film. Speaking of the ending, I liked the new tweaks and additions there as well, for I was never a fan of Charlie winning, flying around in a flying elevator, and never really knowing anything else beyond that moment.  It isn't so much an explanation as it is just taking things a step further, to a more satisfying result. I know the original film reflects how Mr. Dahl wrote it, but after watching the documentary about him on the DVD, I cannot help but think he would have approved of this alteration.If I had a complaint about ANYTHING in the film, it would be about the scene in which we see what happened to the other four children after their mishaps in the factory. I very much think their fate was better left to our imagination as opposed to seeing this new addition.  Again, what did I say about the need to explain things?  Well, this scene is delivering in an area that was best left undressed originally, as Willy himself offered enough to let us know that the kids were going to be alright. Of course, this is a merely a small nitpick.The special features are also worthy of one's time, though I am a bit disappointed that the DVD contains no audio commentary featuring Tim Burton.  With that said, the animated menus are fun, and the documentaries and very informative.  In addition to the very interesting documentary on Mr. Dahl that I mentioned earlier, the disc contains a plethora of other insightful glimpses into the making of the film.  Of particular note is the feature dealing with the squirrels used in the film`s nut cracking room, as well as a detailed feature on the extensive work that went into creating the multitudes of various Oompa Loompas seen throughout the film. Sadly the interactive games included on the discs are disappointing, though aimed at very young children.  Interviews with the director, composer, and actors make for an exciting look into the making of this surreal film.  All in all, a very well put together supplemental package.I would recommend this film to any who are fans of either the original film starring Gene Wilder in the starring role, or fans of Mr. Dahl's book in general.  If you like interesting documentaries and other supplements on your DVD, waste no time in obtaining the two-disc deluxe edition!  4.5 stars!",5,A Remake that Is Actually WORTH Your Time,1143244800,"03

Miscast Johnny Depp pales (figuratively and literally) in comparison to Gene Wilder. He plays Wonka like an old Dave Foley character from ""Kids in The Hall,"" but creepier and completely unlikable. Not to be an ""older is always better"" guy, but not one single thing in this high-tech remake is better than the original. The songs just plain stink and the kids, except for Charlie, are less than sweet simulacrums of the original stellar cast. I can't remember the book that well, but I'm pretty damn sure that Roald Dahl did not have the hackneyed story line about Wonka having ""father issues"" that need to be addressed and happily remedied in the last five minutes.

""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" really has to be seen from a kid's eye view to be grasped.  Adult commentaries don't seem appropriate for something like this.Having said that, and also having revealed in this review's title that I don't care much for the story itself, I was much more interested in this version of the film than its predecessor.  I should also mention that I'm generally lukewarm about Tim Burton's body of work as well.Nevertheless, this is the film I believe Tim Burton was destined to create.Burton usually finds the dark side of a story to play in, but here at last he seemed to find the exact balance needed to tell this story properly.  This story is about the grotesque character types of childhood - poverty-stricken Charlie observing children over-indulged and overloaded in what they eat, what they play with, what they're presented with, and what they compete for - and Dahl's ways of showing them up for what it ultimately brings them all.  It's aimed at a child's morality and sense of justice, not an adult's.  Adults who dismiss this story as somehow sick or scary really don't get it.  But I think that perhaps Burton does.Charlie, himself, is wonderfully played by young master Highmore without being too gushy or syrupy.  Johnny Depp's (and I imagine Tim Burton's) version of Willy Wonka loses some of the sinister schizoid clown aspect that Gene Wilder had and replaces it with quirks associated with never quite growing up properly.  And who can ever slight David Kelly's performances in anything?  Much more fitting casting here as Grandpa Joe than Jack Albertson in the earlier version.The special effects are relatively tame in this film, but seem to concentrate more on it really being a factory than a theme park ride as the earlier film version of the story always strikes me (or even a psychedelic nightmare at times).  The look feels right for nowadays, and Danny Elfman's score is equally fitting and witty.To the reviewer who claimed that Depp played two roles, look again.  Mrs. Bucket is definitely NOT Johnny Depp, but Helena Bonham Carter, who will do the voice of the Corpse Bride (in release September, 2005) alongside Depp and under the direction of Tim Burton.I expected little from this film, and couldn't even talk my 17-year-old into seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it.  I have great difficulty getting through the earlier version with Gene Wilder without falling asleep, but this one kept me interested and involved throughout.

I enjoyed it, and one way to enjoy it is just to put aside any thoughts of the original film and go along for the ride.There are a few clinkers; I loved Deep Roy as all the Oompa Loompas, and also as a few single roles (the psychiatrist.) But the computer graphics that replicated him to become ALL the Oompa Loompas was a bit boring, and he was too small--the teensiness of the new Oompa Loompas made them almost insignificant. Likewise, some of Danny Elfman's Oompa songs got a bit dull--though they weren't bad. Just not catchy, like the original.Johnny Depp is a troubled Willy, who has more than a streak of mean in him. He seems somewhat unengaged. The annoying children are fine (I loved Veruca, she was by far the best) and the casting for Charlie Bucket and his grandad were right on. Helen Bonham Carter, however, looked a bit out of place.The factory failed to dazzle me, but I loved the elevator. I just went along for the ride and enjoyed it almost as much as the original.

The two movies about Willie Wonka was the 1971 ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka.  That movie as well is a classic and worth five stars.  This version though directed by Tim Burton is more faithful to Dahl's novel and vision of Willie Wonka.  Numerous reviews have compared this movie to the 1971 version and that isn't fair for the movies and the actors.

938985,A385C064Y38OFK,B000BB1MHS,"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com""","[13, 45]","No matter if you love or loathe chocolate, or admire or despise the 1971 adaptation of `Ronald Dahl's `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', starring Gene Wilder, of which Ronald Dahl wrote the screenplay himself - both bars of confectionary should be eaten and savoured upon separately. However there are many edible gratifications to be found in each ambitious undertaking to bring `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' to the screen for everyone to feast their eyes upon without gaining an ounce of weight. All this and more can be found nestled on a slim versatile video disc called DVD for a lifetime of enjoyment.With twelve notable films under his belt according to Empire magazine, the latest being `Corpse Bride', original Black Knight `Batman' director Tim Burton, with eccentric films and hair to match movie producer Brian Grazer's hairdo, failed to get through to the register with his chocolate bar (perhaps due to the long line of people ahead of him desperate to consume the new sensation sweeping the nation), and so has moulded a classic film for his eleventh directorial effort that is perhaps his finest hour yet. For Graeme Base it was, and for talented children's author Ronald Dahl's sixth novel it has proven to be a sweet worth sharing with the world. Thirty four years after the original film, that was vehemently despised by its author comes a wilder, wickeder, brooding interpretation. So expect a distinctly darker block of chocolate now on the market, that, if Ronald Dahl was alive today might delight in the change or cause him to turn is his grave. So versatile is this story it comes in drinkable liquid form being hot chocolate.From early indications when poster work went into production, it was anyone's guess how the finished product would turn out. It's only in the experimental taste-testing, movie preview screenings that we get to indulge in the delectable new creation from renowned chocolate constructer Willy Wonka. There's something under his hat that might warrant some close examination in a padded cell, by a doctor House, with a cane who could meet a man who shares a similar crooked disposition as Peter Laurie's creation.There has been some tinkering done here, with some sections split into bite sized pieces, but with the most memorable scenes intact. However it only enriches the original story, and only encourages more children to turn the pages of the book with appropriately chocolate covered fingers. You'll either find a treasure trove of treats in a colourful landscape that the poster artwork might suggest could be a rainbow after a rainstorm. Be careful though as you consume this for I feel a vomiting sensation will overcome the eater that will leave you feeling sick to your stomach and abandon you as you are burdened with a severe case of indigestion. If this film spoils your appetite like a `Milky Way' promises not to do, you'll be cursing the day you came across this chocolate bar that will forever leave a despicable taste in your mouth for years to come and cause you to spit at like pips in an orange. The pips are coming if you don't think this film has anything to do with oranges but to me it does. You'll implore to anyone who will listen that this chocolate bar doesn't belong to you.Coming from poor yet humble beginnings, we meet Charlie Bucket, (Freddie Highmore) who live with his ailing grandparents, who are in desperate need of an adventure, having been cooped up in a big bed for years on end, and a life-long staple diet of boring old cabbage, that will surely see the grandparents kick the bucket well before Charlie if something isn't done fast. Yet it is a stroke of pure luck and a yearly birthday for Charlie that holds the promise of turning everyone's life around. Peeling back the wrapper of an enticing chocolate bar, hoping for a golden ticket that will secure Charlie's place in a tour of the infamous recluse Willy Wonka's once opulent factory. That was until the factory closed, and one of the afore mentioned grandparents, who used to work diligently for Mr. Wonka, was laid off and replaced by a more efficient, yet impersonal machine.They say time heals all wounds and after years of closure, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) entertains the idea of five lucky children having a tour of his world-renowned factory.It's then we have the distinct pleasure of meeting four other winning children lacking in social graces and delightfully repugnant, Mike Teavee, (Jordon Fry) Veruca Salt, (Julia Winter) Violet Beauregarde, (Annasophia Robb) and Augustus Gloop, (Philip Wiegrat) who fill this film with so much enthusiasm, and an over abundance of self-worth in their daily pursuits, that their luck must surely change before there is time for the children's rotten exploits to decay the smooth flowing mechanics of this film. They would too if it wasn't for Willy Wonka's adept knowledge of his beloved factory to dispose of each contestant in distinctly different, yet ingeniously characteristic methods. A humongous block of chocolate and score fitting to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is spectacular. The pips I mention before as in the bad children I think of `A Clockwork Orange'. Controversial in its day I can't really comment on it having not seen it, but `Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' also comes to mind even though there is no music from them. Eminem doesn't get a mention either, Michael Jackson and comparisons about him are a little unfair. He made `History' so he must be doing something worthy enough to record.John August who wrote the script for this and Tim Burton's previous film `Big Fish', does a good job, although I'm more inclined to prefer the `Big Fish' script over `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.When thinking of Ronald Dahl's books `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is indeed memorable. There will never be a movie sequel to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', but there is more great glass elevator in this film. To me, I enjoyed `The Witches' and `Matilda'. Miss Honey in Danny DeVito's film is a honey! I just don't own any of the books or films. I think this will have to change! A movie and book series that comes to mind of a similar dark design are `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'.For me it's all about the adorably deplorable children with kudos to all of them they are all destined to be big stars. For me I liked Veruca Salt who had a blatant disregard for anyone who didn't give her what she wanted, was wonderfully self absorbed in herself and particularly adorable to me. I also wonder if the band of the same name headed by Nina Gordon was an inspiration for them from this book. Violet Beauregard who was a constant gum chewing champion I couldn't help but get attached to. The inclusion of musical numbers is almost nonexistent in Hollywood these days, so to see them in the mix is a welcome addition to Willy Wonka's recipe for success. It would be understandable if people don't lap this movie up in droves. Still if it gets you tongues waging and your mouths chewing on gum, chocolate and the like then it must be doing something right. I loved writing this review and I enjoy the hot chocolate and chocolate bar from Nestle. I'd love to give this film five stars but it just didn't feel exactly right to me so four will have to saffice. This DVD is near perfection just didn't quite do it for me. I can just hear Veruca Salt saying ""Daddy, I WANT 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' DVD right now!"" In the end it all comes down to taste and it is indeed an aquired taste at that. Try to restrain yourselves everyone!",4,Warning! Chocolate may contain traces of nuts!

938986,A9TG2NFA614S9,B000BB1MHS,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (2005) is a fantasy world created by director Tim Burton who has done some off-the-wall movie work. It stars Johnny Depp, lipstick and all, as an androgynous Michael Jackson lookalike. He's playing Willie Wonka, the owner of a candy factory that no longer employs any local people.Charlie, the title character, has a grandfather who formerly worked in the plant. Willie offers five prize certificates in his candy bars. That way he sells a lot of candy. The lucky five finders of the coupon will receive a tour of the factory accompanied by one companion, and one of the five will get a special gift.Five kids find the prizes, nice kid Charlie and four awful, nasty, despicable brats, rotten little twirps who each gets his or her comeuppance while touring the factory.The wild colors in the factory with its rivers and waterfalls of chocolate are more vivid and startling when seen on in a high definition television screen with a Blu-Ray machine.Are we in a candy factory or a nut house? One actor, Deep Roy, plays all of the hundreds of the Oompa-Loompa tribe that works in the factory. The Oompa-Loompas perform musical numbers, which are like Busby Berkley gone to cuckooland.At times it's a sweet story of a sweets factory, at times is cloyingly sweet, and at other times Johnny Depp plays a cruelly misanthropic and nasty person. He doesn't like kids. He plays a real weirdo.There are some Dickensian touches: Charlie's four pleasant, kindly grandparents spend their time lying in interlocking beds facing each other in front of the fireplace. Charlie and his wonderful loving family live in their ramshackled tipsy house with holes in the roof. It's based upon a famous Roald Dahl children's story and was a movie previously with Gene Wilder.",5,"Johnny Depp, Tim Burton - A Strange Combo",1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1786,"['Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', '2005', 'fantasy', 'world', 'created', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'who', 'done', 'off-the-wall', 'movie', 'work', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'lipstick', 'androgynous', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'lookalike', 'playing', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'owner', 'candy', 'factory', 'longer', 'local', 'people.Charlie', 'title', 'character', 'grandfather', 'who', 'formerly', 'worked', 'plant', 'Willie', 'five', 'prize', 'certificates', 'candy', 'bars', 'way', 'lot', 'candy', 'lucky', 'five', 'finders', 'coupon', 'will', 'receive', 'tour', 'factory', 'accompanied', 'one', 'companion', 'one', 'five', 'will', 'get', 'special', 'gift.Five', 'kids', 'find', 'prizes', 'nice', 'kid', 'Charlie', 'four', 'awful', 'nasty', 'despicable', 'brats', 'rotten', 'little', 'twirps', 'who', 'comeuppance', 'touring', 'factory.The', 'wild', 'colors', 'factory', 'rivers', 'waterfalls', 'chocolate', 'are', 'more', 'vivid', 'startling', 'when', 'seen', 'high', 'definition', 'television', 'screen', 'Blu-Ray', 'machine.Are', 'candy', 'factory', 'nut', 'house', 'One', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'hundreds', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'tribe', 'factory', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'perform', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'Busby', 'Berkley', 'gone', 'cuckooland.At', 'times', 'sweet', 'story', 'sweets', 'factory', 'times', 'cloyingly', 'sweet', 'other', 'times', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'cruelly', 'misanthropic', 'nasty', 'person', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', 'real', 'are', 'Dickensian', 'touches', 'Charlie', 'four', 'pleasant', 'kindly', 'grandparents', 'spend', 'time', 'lying', 'interlocking', 'beds', 'facing', 'other', 'front', 'fireplace', 'Charlie', 'wonderful', 'loving', 'family', 'live', 'ramshackled', 'tipsy', 'house', 'holes', 'roof', 'based', 'famous', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'children', 'story', 'was', 'movie', 'previously', 'Gene', 'Wilder']",N/A

And boy do I hate that pointless movie almost as much as the author of the book, Roald Dahl, did. Those dreadful songs by that hack Anthony Newley and dumb looking green faced Oompa Loompas are way worse than any song or Oompa Loompa clone in this version by Burton.So forgetting that lame musical version from the 70's [which was a box office flop, BTW] what we have here is an imaginative and quirky film that actually, alas, doesn't live up to its potential. Oh the FX is spectacular and imaginative to be sure, and Depp's performance is unique and has zero to do with Michael Jackson....intentionally at any rate, [these get it the 4 stars] but it all adds up to...what? Yes there are lessons to be learned but it's mainly a excessive film about the dangers of excess. And, hello....not all families are great. Some people need to jettison their families in order to become something and feel good. Still, it's something to see!I believe the backstory about Dr. Wonka, DDS, was originally devised by Dahl himself when he attempted an early screenplay.... so you can complain all you want about that, but let's leave off  the ""it doesn't fit Dahl's intentions at all"" argument.",4,"Oh, grow up!",1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,1273,"['one', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'not', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'version', 'Well', 'duh', 'boy', 'do', 'hate', 'pointless', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'author', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'did', 'dreadful', 'songs', 'hack', 'Anthony', 'Newley', 'dumb', 'looking', 'green', 'faced', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'are', 'way', 'worse', 'song', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'clone', 'version', 'Burton.So', 'forgetting', 'lame', 'musical', 'version', '70', '[', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'BTW', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'imaginative', 'quirky', 'film', 'actually', 'alas', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'potential', 'FX', 'spectacular', 'imaginative', 'be', 'sure', 'Depp', 'performance', 'unique', 'zero', 'do', 'Michael', 'Jackson', '.intentionally', 'rate', 'get', '4', 'stars', ']', 'up', 'what', 'Yes', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'mainly', 'excessive', 'film', 'dangers', 'excess', 'hello', '.not', 'families', 'are', 'great', 'people', 'need', 'jettison', 'families', 'order', 'become', 'something', 'feel', 'good', 'Still', 'something', 'see', 'believe', 'backstory', 'Dr.', 'Wonka', 'DDS', 'was', 'originally', 'devised', 'Dahl', 'when', 'attempted', 'early', 'screenplay', 'can', 'complain', 'want', 'let', 'leave', 'off', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Dahl', 'intentions', 'argument']",N/A
938988,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000BB1MHS,John Kwok,"[3, 5]","Tim Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a much darker film adaptation of the Road Dahl novel than ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Without question, this adaptation is much truer in spirit to the dark, caustic humor of Dahl's prose. I don't exaggerate stating that in Burton, Dahl has found the best artistic kindred spirit capable of rendering his tale into film, while Johnny Depp is a more troubled, emotionally disturbed Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder's exuberant version. And yet, inspite of its often morose, dark spirit, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is deliciously funny, especially in the scenes where Charlie Buckett's (Freddie Highmore) obnoxious young companions get their just desserts (Each time this happens, the film goes into warp speed, offering scenes which are hysterically funny.). As Charlie, Freddie Highmore offers yet another spellbinding performance (He acted alongside Depp in ""Finding Neverland"", portraying the young boy who was the inspiration for Peter Pan.), portraying the young hero of Dahl's novel as a generous, thoughtful kid who is wiser beyond his years. David Kelly's portrayal of Grandpa Joe is also spellbinding, as the dear old friend and confidant to young Charlie Bucket. Composer Danny Elfman contributes an intriguing musical score which runs the gamut from Philip Glass to the Beatles and Kiss in its musical influences; it may be the most consistently exuberant aspect of this film, along with the lavish sets constructed for the Wonka Chocolate Factory. And speaking of exuberance, there's a silly, but appropriate homage to the opening scenes of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" which I think is absolutely brilliant.I greatly enjoyed viewing this film, which I would recommend without reservation to any kid above the age of five (However, there may be some scenes, such as the ""squirrel attack"" which may be disturbing to some younger children.). My only reservation is in Burton's shifting of the tale from Charlie's to Wonka's perspective, adding in a rather gratuitious series of flashbacks with a young Wonka and his dentist father portrayed brilliantly by Christopher Lee. This leads unfortunately to a rather extended ending in which Wonka comes to grips finally with maturity (If I write more, I will be yielding a major spoiler!). Still, despite this caveat, I have no doubt that many will find this film most enjoyable.  I couldn't help but laugh at every funny moment, joined by a chorus of enthusiastic film goers each time I've seen ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".

I sat down, fully expecting to loathe this new venture, especially considering my love for the original film.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.I like Tim Burton films, so I was immediately tickled by the offbeat humor (I am one of the few people who actually enjoyed ""Mars Attacks"").  Danny Elfman's music score is catchy and the songs inventively delightful (each song for each kid is from a different era of popular music -- though you may want to flip on the subtitles so you can understand the lyrics).  Johnny Depp's Wonka is weird but not repulsive, and the flashbacks to his childhood (with a dentist father chillingly essayed by Christopher Lee)give us a solid understanding of his excentricities.Perhaps more amazing is the focus on Charlie Bucket, a delightfully normal kid if there ever was one, as the stablizing force for the story.  Not only is Charlie's family more accessible and real than the 1970's version, but it manages to conclude the film with a surprising yet satisfying pro-family statement.  Those disappointed by the closing line of the original film (""But you know what happened to the boy who suddenly got everything he wanted...he lived happily ever after."") because it seemed to contradict every oompa loompa song that preceded it, will be pleased with the sober ending of this film which is strongly reminiscent of Dahl's own ""James and the Giant Peach"" and even Dr. Seuss' ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""While trying hard not to give things away, it can be said that the Wonka weirdness becomes perfectly acceptable, because Wonka is a character in the process of becoming better, and it is Charlie who manages to be the catalyst for change.While the weirdness is weird enough so that I would not immediately call this a ""family"" film, it is still an impressive piece of work that is worth a look.

938991,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B000BB1MHS,Joker,"[0, 0]","This 2005 movie features Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka. Weird. A very weird portrayal of Wonka. I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors out there, but I really didn't care for how he played the role of Wonka. Those sunglasses, the pale skin, the smile, it all makes him resemble Michael Jackson in a way. His personality seems low-key and quiet.  No spunk.

938992,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B000BB1MHS,Jonathan Cohen,"[5, 9]","If you still love ""Charlie/Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" but didn't think it needed a remake, you've got another think coming. Tim Burton, the man who took the ""Addams Family"" theme (""it's creepy and its kooky"") and made it into an art form in both live and animated classics, has given Roald Dahl's timeless fable a faithful, yet fresh, retelling.Johnny Depp, Burton's favorite leading man and himself the master of eccentric-loner character, won't make you forget Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka. Instead, he brings the candy man into a place called WonkaWorld. Where Wilder gave you a wink and a nod throughout, Depp- in his Marcel Marceau mask, Edwardian derby, and pretty-boy delivery- makes Willy Wonka a weird, ghostly creation that's still a magnet on the screen. In contrast, the kids- played cute and/or broadly the first time- are all down-to-earth yet put over Dahl's traits very well. Freddie Highmore (who worked with Depp in ""Finding Neverland"") gives Charlie a modest, English-schoolboy manner; the best of the kids is Anna Sophia Robb (""Because of Winn-Dixie""), whose Violet Beauregarde is a slightly-tacky little Southern belle with a mouthful of gum. My favorite performance, though, is by David Kelly (""Waking Ned Devine""), the grizzled Irish stage actor whose Grandpa Joe- a lovable old-timer with a delightful Irish lilt and twinkle- is priceless (dare we say Oscar-worthy?)Burton and his crew of designers, animators and costumers have an absolute field day with the movie's look. The cold gray Northern English (Northern Ohio? Northern Germany?) factory town with the Bucket's tilted, off-kilter house suddenly goes ""Wizard of Oz"" on us as Willy Wonka emerges from the gates and leads the group to the gaudy chocolate waterfall room. Look also for the ""Sgt. Pepper""-esque nut house with the (largely real) team of nut-cracking squirrels, the ""2001: Space Odyssey"" (with the bombastic Strauss fanfare) WonkaVision studios, and other touches that really make Depp, in particular, such a marvelously spooky-kooky guy.Did I mention the very talented Danny Elfman, that quirkiest of movie composers and a Burton partner for 20 years? This guy's one of my new heroes. Not only does he back the pre-factory sections with brooding, yet witty, music that has distinct Anglo-Russian overtones, he dips into everything from Bollywood musicals to ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" for the Oompa-Loompa songs (using parts of Dahl's original poems)...and sings them with nifty '60s-style voice tricks. The ""Augustus Gloop"" number alone's worth the price.Burton and writer John August worked very closely with Dahl's widow, and it shows; not only is half of the dialogue taken right from the book but they added a bio for Willy Wonka that's really in Dahl's dark-but-moral spirit. It's told in dream sequences that involve old horror-movie fave Christopher Lee as the senior Wonka, who's...an orthodontist! Take a look at the hideous brace/mask/helmet little Willy must wear, and you'll see why he's obsessed with candy. This doesn't spoil the story, but adds that dark Dr. Demento edge that's so much a part of Burton's work. (It's a wonder the kid wasn't electrocuted at 10!)Wisely, the DVD package doesn't include a feature commentary; this movie doesn't need it. The bonus disc, however, has some great stuff on it. Burton, the cast and crew are all major parts of features that cover the squirrel and Oompa-Loompa sequences; the former were both animated and real, while the latter is Deep Roy, a diminutive Anglo-Indian actor/stuntman, multiplied by dozens of CGI and/or robot duplicates. (Watch Deep wear two dozen costumes, play drums, and do disco-style dance steps!) Danny Elfman, too, has his own well-deserved feature- I mean, the guy does everything and he's very funny to boot. Even the kids' games, especially the one with the squirrels, are clever (and not so easy).""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" may not be for the youngest audiences; the rating was unique (PG/""quirky situations""), and it's quirky, all right. Veruca does get swamped by marauding squirrels and the Wonka puppet show catches on fire...but those are Tim Burton moments, all right. Creepy and kooky indeed.

So can he morph himself into the already made Willy Wanka? Yes and no. His characters works, being a nice comic relief for the movie. But you can't help but feel that he basically ripped his character off of Michael Jackson, which he can swear up and down he didn't do but the audience has eyes and wont be fooled.You are taken to a strange world, which ranges from the chocolate palace, to Charlie's deformed house, to the inside of Wanka's factory. Many will quickly take a liking to Charlie, a polite yet poor boy who miraculously got into the factory. And accompanying him are four other brats adjoined with their own type of sins. Veruca is a snotty spoiled brat, Viola being a competitive twit, Mike is another brat living his life through videogames, and Augustus makes a pig out of himself. Each end up getting what comes to them, which stays loyal to both the book and movie.The acting is done wonderfuly, even so with the questionable Johnny Depp. It also branches out from the original in true Tim Burton style to prevent it from being a clone of the book and previous movie. The visuals are stunning, and the oompa loompas' musical scenes are humorous and left me with some laughs.

938995,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000BB1MHS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 4]","Tim Burton's ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" is a remake as well as an adaptation of both the Roald Dahl novel and screenplay as well as a visual wonder of a film. Comparing it to ""Willy Wonka & the Charlie Factory"" it is a lot more faithful to the book and is a lot better visually. All the actors play their parts well; the visual effects, makeup, and set direction are worthy of Oscar nods. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the androgynous candy maker is spectacular. People compare his performance to Michael Jackson, and there's obviously some Jacko in there, but he also reminded me of an equally controversial singer (Marilyn Manson). The look Depp has in the film brought to mind both Manson and Jackson, the voice Jackson. Whatever it is, Depp is great. The script, adapted by John August, has a lot more depth; Even diving into Wonka's childhood. Burton is still himself, the film has the Burton mood and music (composed by Danny Elfman). Anyway, the film is about Charlie (Freddie Highmore, Finding Neverland) who lives with his father (Noah Taylor), his mother (Helena Bonham Carter) and his bedridden grandparents in their lopsided house. Everyday, Charlie passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. A factory which has been open for a while, but seems to never have anybody going in or out. But then suddenly it is announced that Willy Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in candy bars that are to be shipped around the world. Anyway, same ol' story; Charlie finds the golden ticket and along with four other children go into Wonka's famous factory. Now for the children and their parents. Well, there are some changes. The parents of the children are quite different. The kids are pretty much the same; Augustus Gloop is a fat disgusting child. Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat. Violet Beauregard is a competitive gum chewing over-achieving little girl. And then Mike Teevee is still the kid who sits in front of the TV all day, except this time he plays video games. The Oompa-Loompa's have changed quite a bit as well. Instead of the green haired, orange faced midgets we're used too. We have a single actor (Deep Roy) playing the Oompa-Loompa's who now merely wear orange jumpsuits. Very well done. A-.",5,Better than the Original.

When it starts, you think you're watching Batman - loud elaborate sound track, cold villainous set design. Really, you expect a shot of the Penguin or Riddler to pop in anytime.The storyline is VERY much like the 1971 movie . . . except different. Because you know the plot line so well, much of the movie is very predictable. I guess Burton really tried making it interesting, but it comes across as contrived, dark, and, well, Burtonesque.Burton has a fixation on dark fathers and oppressed sons. There's this odd backstory about Wonka and his overbearing father, making him wear some kind of torture device orthodontics that look like something Scissorhand would wear. Very Hellraiser-like.Wonka. Really bad. Depp is lost here. He mixes bits and pieces of other characters into his roles, and it shows here. You first see him after this bizarre candyland introduction that bursts into flames, and all the cute dolls violently melt before your eyes. (Very disturbing for children to watch. Which is why Burton does it, of course.) He acts like Michael Jackson, and you wonder if that's going to be the essence of his role.Nope. Depp's Wonka can't ever figure out who he is: malicious, misopedic, moody, petulant, weird. And more. He really makes no sense, and this is Burton's fault because Depp does basically whatever Burton wants.Remember Scissorhand's odd father/son complex? Well, its back, only this time with Christopher Lee as the father-God figure, and Depp's Wonka as the harmed child. Burton has some very long-standing, deep-seated emotional issues here, and I guess he doesn't mind because it makes him a lot of money. (And actually, I believe its his personal interpretation of God and His woeful, misbegotten creatures. You see it a lot in his movies.)The oompa loompas are really bad. They cloned this one Indian midget named Deep Roy - only adding to the cold, sterile nature of this movie - so you basically have one guy multiplied into a thousand.Yeah, this is a not good movie.

Each partner in the collaboration walks away a winner, mostly because the movie that was worked on was a success, earning them more respect, bigger star power, and sometimes even critical acclaim. There are currently a few big name collaborations that have been prominent over the last few years, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh (""Ocean's 11-13""), Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan (""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige""), Kevin Smith and the batch of actors that have appeared in almost every one of his films (from ""Mallrats"" to ""Clerks 2""). But there is one collaboration that has existed longer than the others, since the 1990 release of ""Edward Scissorhands"", the collaborators are, of course, Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy) and director Tim Burton (""Batman""). What's impressive about this particular collaboration, sure the length of time is quite a feat by Hollywood standards, but the fact that this collaboration remains so powerful at the box office is astonishing. Almost every one of Johhny Depp's and Tim Burton's movies have turned a profit. In 2007, the duo came together yet again for the movie ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"", but before this film the two worked on the remake of the Roald Dahl children's classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", the novel that had been previously adapted in 1971 with ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is the story of a sweet, good-hearted little boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who lives in a rundown shack with his mother, father, and both sets of grandparents. They have next to nothing to live on, and Charlie's birthday is coming up, and the only thing they can afford is one single candy bar. But not just any candy bar, a Wonka Bar, made at the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory located in the same town. What makes the factory so mysterious is that not a single person has been seen coming or going from that factory in 15 years, that is until an announcement goes out to the whole world that 5 lucky people will be selected to visit the factory and meet the reclusive owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). Most of Charlie's life, good fortune has been rather elusive, but one lucky day changes everything as Charlie finds one of the 5 golden tickets that will give him access to Wonka's factory, and the wonders that Charlie will behold will change his life forever.When I first heard about this movie's release, I wasn't all that excited to see it, in fact I didn't even want to see it at all. For starters, I didn't care a whole lot for the original movie ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" starring Gene Wilder, so I didn't really see what I would find of interest here. Plus, the original film was so well received by critics and audiences, that I didn't understand the point behind making this updated version. However, one day I recorded the movie off of the Showtime network, and figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I mean, it's Johnny Depp and Tim Burton together again, just how bad could this movie be.Truth be told, the movie's not all that bad. It's obvious the reason that Depp and Burton continue collaborating is that there is a chemistry there that allows their work together to be so successful, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was at least a decent addition to their list of collaborations, though not their best by any means.As one could easily tell from the previews, and possibly the DVD cover for that matter, the movie is strange, no doubt about that. There's a lot of weird things that occur in the movie, some that happened in the original, and some new, but the story is actually quite endearing as you watch this young boy's innocence begins to reach this reclusive man, showing him that reaching out and trusting in others will bring a sense of belonging into his life. There were some elements to the film that I didn't care for, primarily the song numbers, they were just flat-out irritating to listen to, and I found myself skipping ahead to the end of the song as they did nothing more than slow the movie down. Some of the characters were extremely annoying, but that's not so much the actors fault as it was simply the way the character was meant to be, but I still didn't care for them and couldn't wait for them to get off the screen.Performance wise, Johnny Depp did an excellent job as the quirky eccentric Willy Wonka, a role I was surprised that Depp was chosen for, but his chameleon-like ways with characters continued to serve him well in this movie. Some critics of the film felt Depp's portrayal was a bit too much like Michael Jackson, leaving them with a creepy feeling when Wonka was on screen. Personally I didn't read that into his Depp's performance, though I can maybe see how some might think that. The other standout performance was Freddie Highmore's, this talented young actor, who previously appeared in ""Finding Neverland"" with Johnny Depp, convincingly conveyed the innocence and naive view of the world that Charlie possessed, and he seemed like the perfect good kid, to the point he was a little unbelievable as a character. Charlie's character, in this film, was just too perfect, he listened and obeyed everything that Wonka requested, yet in the original, if I remember correctly both he and his grandpa snuck away to mess around in some bubble room that caused them to fly for a little bit. To me this change came off a little too much like director Tim Burton was trying too hard to make Charlie seem so good compared to the other kids, so he changed the story to make Charlie seem perfect. Now I will say that I've never read the book, and I've heard that the original film changed numerous elements from the book, so maybe the reason Burton's version didn't have the scene was because the book didn't, so I don't know, maybe Burton got it right in the end, either way I would have preferred a little more complexity to Charlie to make his character a little more believable.The sets for this movie were all intricately detailed, from Charlie's family shack that was designed to be leaning as if it could fall over at any time, further illustrating the family's poor lot in life. To the extravagance of Wonka's factory, where each room was visually amazing, without feeling faked by CGI. Director Tim Burton's eye for the unusual and keen attention to detail was evident in his sets, and his strong imagination and storytelling ability was perfect for a movie such as this.Even with good performances, extravagant set pieces, and imaginative storytelling by director Tim Burton, this movie is still only average in my opinion. The parts I liked were entertaining, and the parts I didn't weren't that major, but as a whole the movie just didn't grab me to the point that I felt like it was a great movie. I thought it was good to see once, but I probably would not choose to watch it again.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is rated PG for mild language.",3,This Factory's Worth a

Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka, but Johnny Depp gave a different look at Willy Wonka a more stranger side then Wilder gave us.  Both were great as Willy Wonka but both gave their own versions of him.  Both have alot of differences and some what similar.  Wilder's version of Willy Wonka was more of adult and less stranger whereas Depp's version of Willy Wonka was stranger then Wilder'sand acted more like a little kid and also kind of sounded like Micheal Jackson and a little like Dr. Evil but still was cool.  Of course Tim Burton gives us a little weirder and darker side to his movies.

939004,A3DL686B8JEM8A,B000BB1MHS,"JWK ""jwk""","[1, 3]","I once made the comment that most of the entertainment today is in very bad shape.  The industries are trying to relive past glories, especially music and movies.  Most of the money being made in the music industry is reissues, HDCD releases of well-known titles, delux reissues, legacy reissues, offical releases of bootlegs, greatest hits, and any and all repackaging of classic albums.  And they all use well known, classic, big name artists, because they know people will buy it.  Because the majority of new CDs, and new artists aren't of any real quality, they have to rely on the old stuff to make money.  The same can be said of the movies.  It's all sequels, prequels, remakes, and remodels.Accordingly, I was not thrilled when I heard a new version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was coming out.  When I learned it was a Tim Burton/Danny Elfman/Johnny Depp production, I was less skeptical.  When I saw a trailer, I was interested.  When I heard Danny Elfman was writing/composing the music AND doing the vocals, I was excited.  The collaboration is great, almost to the point of excusing all their pretensiousness and self-absorbtion...  enough quibbling.  On to the movie!It holds many of Tim Burton's staples; it is dark, stark, eerie, and filled with the regular unnamable props, but he has allowed joy into the equation.  The movie is much better for it.  There is rich color, specifically in the factory, to match the rich imagery and funny comparisons of Willy Wonka.  Depp is cast perfectly in this role, which is not really apparent unless you see the movie.  He is funny, quirky, confused, and innocent; much different than the brilliant, strong character played by Gene Wilder in the original.  The children who find the golden tickets and their parents do a great job too.  Perhaps my favorite part is the wild card, Danny Elfman.  If you don't know WHO Elfman is, you're sure to have heard his music whether in any number of cult classic 80's films (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman 1 & 2), his TV themes (The Simpsons), his musical-esque movies featuring his vocals (Nightmare Before Christmas-- an absolute classic soundtrack), or his 15-plus years of work as the vocalist/writer/guitarist for 80's heavyweight Oingo Boingo.  ""Charlie"" is the 11th time Tim Burton has used Elfman as his composer, and this is arguably their greatest work together (though I prefer ""Nightmare Before Christmas"").The movie itself is quite interesting, moving into parts of the Willy Wonka story the orignal movie didn't, relying more on the Ron Dahl book.  Note: even the lyrics to the four Oompa-Loompa songs are the lyrics from the novel.  We learn that Willy became a chocolateer to spite his father and is forever haunted by this falling out.  An eventual redemtion of their relationship serves as a very positive pro-family element.  Best of all, it's clean.  Nothing negative, offensive, or disturbing is presented, meaning a green light for families and kids; a HUGE plus.  The only problem with this version is the lacking special features,  but the casual viewer can always live without them, making for a less expensive buy.  A great, big, fun movie.Overall:  9 out of 10.",5,"""Are you hip to the jive?""  ****1/2",1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,3208,"['once', 'made', 'comment', 'most', 'entertainment', 'today', 'very', 'bad', 'shape', 'industries', 'are', 'trying', 'relive', 'past', 'glories', 'especially', 'music', 'movies', 'Most', 'money', 'being', 'made', 'music', 'industry', 'reissues', 'HDCD', 'well-known', 'titles', 'delux', 'reissues', 'legacy', 'reissues', 'offical', 'releases', 'bootlegs', 'greatest', 'hits', 'repackaging', 'classic', 'albums', 'use', 'well', 'known', 'classic', 'big', 'name', 'artists', 'know', 'people', 'will', 'buy', 'majority', 'new', 'CDs', 'new', 'artists', 'are', ""n't"", 'real', 'quality', 'have', 'rely', 'old', 'stuff', 'make', 'money', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movies', 'sequels', 'prequels', 'remakes', 'remodels.Accordingly', 'was', 'not', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'new', 'version', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'When', 'learned', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton/Danny', 'Elfman/Johnny', 'Depp', 'production', 'was', 'less', 'skeptical', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'interested', 'When', 'heard', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'was', 'writing/composing', 'music', 'doing', 'vocals', 'was', 'excited', 'collaboration', 'great', 'almost', 'point', 'excusing', 'pretensiousness', 'self-absorbtion', 'enough', 'quibbling', 'movie', 'many', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'staples', 'dark', 'stark', 'eerie', 'filled', 'regular', 'unnamable', 'props', 'allowed', 'joy', 'equation', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'rich', 'color', 'specifically', 'factory', 'match', 'rich', 'imagery', 'funny', 'comparisons', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Depp', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'role', 'not', 'really', 'apparent', 'see', 'movie', 'funny', 'quirky', 'confused', 'innocent', 'much', 'different', 'brilliant', 'strong', 'character', 'played', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'original', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'golden', 'tickets', 'parents', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'part', 'wild', 'card', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHO', 'Elfman', ""'re"", 'sure', 'have', 'heard', 'music', 'number', 'cult', 'classic', '80', 'films', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'Beetlejuice', 'Batman', '1', '2', 'TV', 'themes', 'Simpsons', 'musical-esque', 'movies', 'featuring', 'vocals', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'absolute', 'classic', 'soundtrack', '15-plus', 'years', 'work', 'vocalist/writer/guitarist', '80', 'heavyweight', 'Oingo', 'Boingo', 'Charlie', '11th', 'time', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'used', 'Elfman', 'composer', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'work', 'together', 'prefer', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', '.The', 'movie', 'quite', 'interesting', 'moving', 'parts', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'story', 'orignal', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'relying', 'more', 'Ron', 'Dahl', 'book', 'Note', 'even', 'lyrics', 'four', 'Oompa-Loompa', 'songs', 'are', 'lyrics', 'novel', 'learn', 'Willy', 'became', 'chocolateer', 'spite', 'father', 'forever', 'haunted', 'falling', 'out', 'eventual', 'redemtion', 'relationship', 'very', 'positive', 'pro-family', 'element', 'Best', 'clean', 'Nothing', 'negative', 'offensive', 'disturbing', 'presented', 'meaning', 'green', 'light', 'families', 'kids', 'HUGE', 'plus', 'only', 'problem', 'version', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'casual', 'viewer', 'can', 'always', 'live', 'making', 'less', 'expensive', 'buy', 'great', 'big', 'fun', 'movie.Overall', '9', '10']",N/A

A lot of people compare this vision to the novel, but I like to look at the classic 1971 version of Roald Dahl's novel. The two are very different movies. Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was much more subtle and a tad bit mysterious. When we see Tim Burton's version it is much more whimsical, zany, and very loud. Burton opens the film with Charlie living in his crooked house (all to similar to Big Fish) down the road from the massive factory.  In Burton's version we get much more backstory about the character of Willy Wonka, we understand why he closed off his factory and why he went into seclusion and that turns out to be the downfall of the movie in an artistic sense. The movie is very entertaining, and it is laugh out loud at times, but in the end that's all that it is. We lose the idea that this is a satire on the way children are raised in today's society. The Oompa Loompa songs have now become broadway musicals instead of quirky rhymes with a point to be made. At times you can barely understand the lyrics of the songs, and that is where the film's message lies.  Burton presents Wonka as a man who is still just a child inside, who is struggling with his lost childhood and strict father.  In the orginal film the audience never really figured out the character of Willy Wonka, and that is why I prefer Gene Wilder's brilliant performance over Johnny Depp's extravagent wardrobes and make-up.  Gene Wilder had a presence, he had joy watching all those kids fall one at a time because he despised their attitudes as well as their parents. Johnny Depp may as well be one of the kids, it looks as if he is enjoying all the sparks and whistles more than seeing that these kids are learning the reality of things, which is the whole point that I feel is being missed.  I like how Tim Burton makes London covered in a blanket of snow, all white, and absent of any color except for the browns on the houses. The moment the doors open to Wonka's factory we are ambushed not only with color from Wonka's wacky wardrobe, but with a visual feast for the eyes within the factory itself.  The movie closes back outside the wintry white city and the character of Willy Wonka does go through a change. But is that really the character we are focusing on? I thought the children were supposed to learn something, not Willy Wonka? Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka already knew everything the kids did, and that was the reason he tested them with the everlasting gobstopper. This movie throws that idea out completely. All in all, it was a fun ride to be had but it feels just like another product of Hollywood. It lost the magic and heart that the original had, and I think it missed the point that Roald Dahl was trying to make.ACTING: Johnny Depp is great actor, everyone knows that. He adds a wacky spin to Willy Wonka that will remind you all too much of Michael Jackson. He is the star of the movie, I believe the next star is Deep Roy. The little man who was cast as every Oompa Loompa you see on screen. I guess it was an easy job since all he had to do was learn the dances and do them on a green screen, he didn't even have to sing.  All the vocals to the Oompa Loompa songs were provided by Danny Elfman, who also did the singing voice of Jack in Tim Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas. Then we come to the children who I thought were horribly done, all except for Charlie Bucket played by Freddie Highmore. I thought the parents were jokes as well, we see more of the children than the parents and that's a flaw. The original focused on the parents much more because it was the fault of the parents that caused their children to be spoiled.BOTTOM LINE: It may sound like I hated the movie, but I really enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and entertaining, but I'm just not pleased that movies today are lacking in social commentaries. The original was able to be fun yet still have a very strong commentary. I also liked Gene Wilder's mysterious and menacing Wonka versus Depp's squeaky voiced and pale Wonka. I think A.O Scott of The New York Times hit the nail on the head when he called Tim Burton's Charlie & The Chocolate Factory "". . . wonderous and flawed.""",4,A Wonderous & Different Vision of Roald Dahl's Novel,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,4496,"['MOVIE', 'film', 'montage', 'chocolate', 'being', 'made', 'factory', 'trademark', 'Burton', 'style', 'trademark', 'Elfman', 'music', 'First', 'must', 'establish', 'movie', 'aimed', 'younger', 'crowd', 'think', 'Depp', 'drew', 'older', 'crowd', 'led', 'massive', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'lot', 'people', 'compare', 'vision', 'novel', 'like', 'look', 'classic', '1971', 'version', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'novel', 'two', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'movies', 'Mel', 'Stuart', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'tad', 'bit', 'mysterious', 'When', 'see', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'whimsical', 'zany', 'very', 'loud', 'Burton', 'film', 'Charlie', 'living', 'crooked', 'house', 'similar', 'Big', 'Fish', 'road', 'massive', 'factory', 'Burton', 'version', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'backstory', 'character', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'understand', 'why', 'closed', 'off', 'factory', 'why', 'went', 'seclusion', 'out', 'be', 'downfall', 'movie', 'artistic', 'sense', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'times', 'end', 'lose', 'idea', 'satire', 'way', 'children', 'are', 'raised', 'today', 'society', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'songs', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'broadway', 'musicals', 'instead', 'quirky', 'rhymes', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'times', 'can', 'barely', 'understand', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'where', 'film', 'message', 'Burton', 'Wonka', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'just', 'child', 'inside', 'who', 'struggling', 'lost', 'childhood', 'strict', 'father', 'orginal', 'film', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'figured', 'out', 'character', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'why', 'prefer', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'extravagent', 'wardrobes', 'make-up', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'had', 'presence', 'had', 'joy', 'watching', 'kids', 'fall', 'one', 'time', 'despised', 'attitudes', 'as', 'well', 'parents', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'kids', 'enjoying', 'sparks', 'more', 'seeing', 'kids', 'are', 'learning', 'reality', 'things', 'whole', 'point', 'feel', 'being', 'missed', 'how', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'London', 'covered', 'blanket', 'snow', 'white', 'absent', 'color', 'browns', 'houses', 'moment', 'doors', 'open', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'are', 'ambushed', 'not', 'only', 'color', 'Wonka', 'wacky', 'wardrobe', 'visual', 'feast', 'eyes', 'factory', 'movie', 'back', 'wintry', 'white', 'city', 'character', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'go', 'change', 'really', 'character', 'are', 'focusing', 'thought', 'children', 'were', 'supposed', 'learn', 'something', 'not', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'already', 'knew', 'everything', 'kids', 'did', 'was', 'reason', 'tested', 'everlasting', 'gobstopper', 'movie', 'idea', 'out', 'completely', 'was', 'fun', 'ride', 'be', 'had', 'just', 'product', 'Hollywood', 'lost', 'magic', 'heart', 'original', 'had', 'think', 'missed', 'point', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'was', 'trying', 'make.ACTING', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'great', 'actor', 'everyone', 'wacky', 'spin', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'will', 'remind', 'too', 'much', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'star', 'movie', 'believe', 'next', 'star', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'little', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'see', 'screen', 'guess', 'was', 'easy', 'job', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'learn', 'dances', 'do', 'green', 'screen', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'sing', 'vocals', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'songs', 'were', 'provided', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'singing', 'voice', 'Jack', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Then', 'come', 'children', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'horribly', 'done', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'played', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'thought', 'parents', 'were', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'more', 'children', 'parents', 'flaw', 'original', 'focused', 'parents', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'fault', 'parents', 'caused', 'children', 'be', 'spoiled.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'may', 'sound', 'hated', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'pleased', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'lacking', 'social', 'commentaries', 'original', 'was', 'able', 'be', 'fun', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'commentary', 'also', 'liked', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'mysterious', 'menacing', 'Wonka', 'versus', 'Depp', 'squeaky', 'voiced', 'pale', 'Wonka', 'think', 'A.O', 'Scott', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'when', 'called', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'wonderous', 'flawed']",N/A

The only film of his that I haven't enjoyed was ""Batman Returns,"" because I felt he took a little too much artistic license on that one.  In ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" we have a twisted children's tale that seems to be tailored to Burton's vision.I'll bet that most folks are more familiar with the Gene Wilder ""Wonka"" of years past instead of Roald Dahl's wonderful book.  With that in mind, I'll use the Wilder feature for comparison.  First off, Johnny Depp is pretty good as Wonka.  He's somewhat creepy, with a look and tone almost like Michael Jackson.  He doesn't care for families that much, due to his own sick childhood.  In fact, he's more like a grown-up Peter Pan.  He seems to want to live in a fantasy world where he rules with a sugar-coated smile.The rest of the cast is nice.  The kid who plays Charlie has wonderful appeal.  Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard, and Mike Teavee are also cast very well.  They are brats, and fit this story well.  The only kid I had a problem with was Augustus Gloop.  He almost looked fake.  He had a Wesson-like glow to his skin that made him appear unnatural and disturbing.  The adults were cast pretty good also.The Oompa Loompas were peculiar.  They shared the same face and were much smaller than the ones in the old version of the film.  I did enjoy their musical numbers in this flick more than in the original.The fates of each of the bratty children were well executed, but might scare the little ones.Overall, this is a twisted look at a story that was already twisted.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know how well it will go over with other folks.  For the adults in the audience, it's probably going to be a walk down memory lane.  For children uninitiated, it might be a little bit too different than their modern, politically-correct world where everybody's a winner and nobody's a bad person.Tim Burton is creepy.  I don't think anyone would argue with me on that.  In turn, he makes ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" even creepier.

939016,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BB1MHS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[4, 5]","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second time Tim Burton approaches Roald Dahl's creations, but it is his first time as a director.  Despite being the first time, as a director, there is something strikingly similar between Burton and Dahl if one looks away from the fact that one is a filmmaker and the other an author, and it is their unique way of telling a tale.  Dahl's many stories are mysterious, clever, and have valuable lessons, as do Burton's films.  Both storytellers convey moral lessons for any individual regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity.  This time Burton directs Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the full approval of Felicity, Dahl's widow, and he captures the same puzzling world that Dahl once created through a grand adventure containing sweets and moral lessons.Freddie Highmore plays the main character, Charlie Bucket, a boy from a poverty stricken family where the parents nurture all four bedridden grandparents.  Charlie is polite, honorable, and noble, qualities that he most likely has acquired from his loving parents and guiding grandparents.  Nothing seems to touch the family, as they always see the glass as half full.  The Bucket family recognizes that money, possessions, and power do not grant them happiness.  The only thing that makes them truly happy is the love that they have for each other. It is announced to the world that Willy Wonka, the refined and enigmatic chocolatier, will invite five children that find five golden tickets to his factory.  These golden tickets can be found in his chocolate bars and they will provide entrance to his secretive chocolate factory to which no human has entered for years.  When Charlie hears about this he cannot help but dream of entering the factory up the street, and his birthday is just around the corner, which means that he will get a Wonka chocolate bar.In the meantime, Charlie and the folks in the small and raggedy Bucket residence will learn about who and how others have gained access to Wonka's chocolate factory.  Each of the lucky ticket winners brings up different notions of disrespectfulness, which further seems to stem from the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.  These children are obvious in their character, as they might overtly express two or three of the deadly sins.  However, a younger audience will most likely not recognize the seven deadly sins, but it is nonetheless clear that these ticket winners are rude and have very bad manners.  The film even goes as far as openly suggesting the source, poor parenting.After an extensive introduction of the other characters, which is essential, as the film deals with what is right and wrong in the light of the consequences of being good, or bad, comes the biggest surprise, or maybe not as Charlie discovers the fifth and final ticket.  Together with Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) Charlie gladly leads into the legendary chocolate factory, as the other four children walk ahead of their parents into an adventure that will separate the good from the bad.  It is here, a good chunk into the film, where Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appears for the first time.Willy Wonka displays an overtly bizarre appearance with a large white smile and eccentric mannerisms that continue throughout the film.  Depp does an extraordinary job in bringing out an aloof and awkward character that frequently seems to drift off to some unknown time and place while standing among his newly arrived guests.  Those viewers who have seen Depp in other films will not identify this character from any of his previous performances.  It is also clear that Burton and Depp have a special relationship, as this is their fourth film and soon the public can see their fifth upcoming puppet film, Corpse Bride (2005).  Depp simply elevates the story far beyond mediocrity into the bizarre fantasy world where Burton seems to be most comfortable where the audience can relinquish it's thoughts completely to the filmmakers performances and storytelling.In 1971 Mel Stuart made Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory based on the same book, which for many has gained a status close to immortality in the world of cinema history.  Despite the notion of remaking an already good film, Burton forcefully delivers his version of the story with the help of a tremendous cast and spectacular cinematography that delivers a fantastic tale.  The film succeeds in reaching the level of the previous film from 1971 and with ease passes the former film based on Dahl's story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  This film should certainly gain a nod in the Oscars for the best writing and screenplay based on material previously produced or published.  Burton's film grasps the issues in an easily understandable manner which can be understood by both young and old, which does not leave anyone behind.  Yet, Burton leaves a little extra for the adult audience to ponder while also considering the youth by offering them several thoughtful lessons.

Tim Burton is my favorite director and I think this movie was perfectly done, and I'm probably one out of few people who love both movie versions of the book. Deep Roy plays the oompa-loompas all by himself and performs their songs well in dance and tune, also. They all sound very different from each other, but maybe they're supposed to.

First I must agree with Roger Ebert about Depp looking and sounding like Michael Jackson. I'd been saying that from the first time I saw a preview.Everything in the film seems at odds with everything else. Depp makes your skin crawl(don't take that as a slam against the man's entire career.) The Oompa-Lumbaas are overly obnoxious and their songs are for the most part annoying and unmemorable. Sometimes I had a hard time discerning the lyrics, but from the ones I did hear I gather I didn't miss much.As for Tim Burton-his contributions seemed the most out-of-place. The beginning scenes might as well have had ""Tim Burton"" stamped across them. The setting is dreary but hopeful. Then we enter the factory and I was hoping for a pastel dreamscape, not unlike those in ""Edward Scissor-Hands""  ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Big Fish"".

Depp somehow looks great in Burton's dark blue lighting and macabre shapes.  Edward Scissorshand and Sleepy Hollow are some of their signature collaborations so far.  But, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in dark blue and bebop music???  It may work, thanks in part to a very talented Johnny Depp, who was over-the-top in Pirates of the Carribbean.  The technicolor-crazed bright look of the Wilder film  and a too subtle Willy Wonka gave the film a family, almost toy-like feel.  Burton and Dep may just get older audiences like teens to 25 year olds to become fans of children's book author Dahl, who has created some of the most quirkiest characters in literature.

939027,A29R4FCO6RFX4K,B000BB1MHS,"Kristy M. Ross ""Kristy""","[1, 1]","I was never uncertain of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twisted ness fits right into Burton's M.O (BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW are some of my favorite movies) It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for vast escapism, even though we have seen most of the content previous to in the original. While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very somber, but here things are pretty fast paced.With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly dissimilar from his counterpart. I believe Depp to be one of the most excellent character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, and his performance was excellent. Danny Elfman's fantastic musical score drives the film in a way that makes every musical scene even more magical. Conceivably an even more perfect team than Depp and Burton is Elfman and Burton, bouncing personalities off each other to create a brilliant mix of offbeat charm that never fails to amuse.Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch. Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line, reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was straightforwardly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style.

The many choreographic technical masterpieces are appreciated even more after viewing the detailed behind-the-scenes bonus features on the DVD.

All three are based on the popular book and all three put their own spin on the clever tale.  The new version reunites long-time work pals Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  The previews would make you believe that the 2005 remake is way overdone with computer imagery and overacting.  However, in some cases, the opposite is true.  The new computerized graphics are not overly distracting and feed the chocolate frenzy well.  It's Johnny Depp that, surprisingly, seems low-key for a character that has been presented in a much more bizarre way than when Gene Wilder filled Wonka's hat.  His reactions often don't feel like they are in direct response to the events that are taking place.  Many times, I felt like I was watching the dress rehearsal, as opposed to the final film.  That said, the movie leaves you with primarily the same feeling that you get if you were to just throw the 1971 version into your DVD player.  Both have elements that are amusing, and they both have elements that are odd.  The only real difference is that the 2005 version tries to stick closer to the original book, but then breaks free whenever it becomes too much of a shadow of the previous film.  You won't be disappointed by the new version, but chances are, you won't be overwhelmed either.  If I were to pick one as better than the other, I think I would have to go for Gene Wilder's more carefree presentation over Johnny's cynical approach.",3,Different flavor CHOCOLATE!,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1564,"['last', 'two', 'weeks', 'have', 'seen', 'three', 'different', 'versions', 'CHARLIE', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'one', 'youth', 'play', 'three', 'are', 'based', 'popular', 'book', 'three', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'clever', 'tale', 'new', 'version', 'long-time', 'work', 'pals', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'previews', 'would', 'make', 'believe', '2005', 'remake', 'way', 'overdone', 'computer', 'imagery', 'overacting', 'However', 'cases', 'opposite', 'true', 'new', 'computerized', 'graphics', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'distracting', 'feed', 'chocolate', 'frenzy', 'well', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'surprisingly', 'low-key', 'character', 'been', 'presented', 'much', 'more', 'bizarre', 'way', 'when', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'filled', 'Wonka', 'hat', 'reactions', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'direct', 'response', 'events', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'Many', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'opposed', 'final', 'film', 'said', 'movie', 'primarily', 'same', 'feeling', 'get', 'were', 'just', 'throw', '1971', 'version', 'DVD', 'player', 'have', 'elements', 'are', 'amusing', 'have', 'elements', 'are', 'odd', 'only', 'real', 'difference', '2005', 'version', 'tries', 'stick', 'closer', 'original', 'book', 'then', 'breaks', 'free', 'too', 'much', 'shadow', 'previous', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'new', 'version', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'either', 'were', 'pick', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'more', 'carefree', 'presentation', 'Johnny', 'cynical', 'approach']",N/A

Even though lot of the reviewers gave a bad rating for this movie, I wanted to rent it and see it for myself.  While I was watching the movie, I could not help but keep saying to myself in my head the word ""strange"" over and over again.  I don't know how else to describe this movie.  The original movie took my breath away when the children first walked into the Willy Wonka factory, but in the Charlie movie, I thought the whole thing looked more fake then anything else, especially the grass part.  Some of the reviewers kept saying that Johnny Dep was not Willy Wonka, but it was the little kid Charlie that had grown up.  Then why did all the kids and the local towns people call him Willy?  Why did that little kid who went into the facotory was named Charlie?  Johnny Depp did played the part of Willy Wonka, because as you can see in the movie that this movie explained how Willy became Willy Wonka the candy maker.  This was the only part of the movie that I liked, because it explained little about Willy's child hood and how it all got started.  The part that I thought it was a little extremem was where the kids are walking through the Charlie factory, and you see a cow all strapped up getting whipped with wips over and over again.  Then, Charlie says ""oh, I get it, a whiped milk"".  I thought to myself ""is this a kid's movie?""  I can just see bunch of kids running to a cow and start beating the cow with their dad's belt trying to get whipped milk.  I thought that was a little violent and was not necessary.  Also, this movie showed Willy arguing with little kids, or saying sarcastic remarks alot.  I liked the original Willy Wonka, because the character was belivable and likable.  This one with Johnny Depp, was not likable but just strange and bizzard.  Johnny Depp should stick with making movies like Pirates of Carribean.  I loved the Oompa music in the original one, but just end up hating it in this movie.  The music was not very catchy at all.  Does anyone who has seen the movie even remember one song from this movie?  Also, I thought when the last part where it showed Willy Wonka's elavator taking off the roof was a good idea, because it actually explained where they went when they took off from the eleavator, the original ended after taking off the elavator but did not explaine where they went.Spoiler!But, after seeing where they went, I just rolled my eyes.  The elavator crashed into Charlie's home.  I thought that they would just let the elavator down gently next to Charlie's home, but no they crashed through the roof.  I am supriesed that they didn't end up killing someone.  I thought this movie was not for kids at all, well at least not for really young kids.

I must admit to having not yet read Roald Dahl's original book to include it in the mix as well, and while I am sure that makes a difference to the millions who have, I would not be one of that number (although certainly I am curious as to how this movie will imprint on young children for whom this is their first cinematic trip to the Chocolate Factory).The justification for ""remaking"" the classic Gene Wilder film is established in the title, which indicates that this time the story is more about Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) than it is about Willie Wonka (Johnny Depp).  That things will be different this time is not do so much that despite the above ditty and the Oompa Loompa's singing commentary on the demises of each of the other children this is not a musical, but that Tim Burton is the director.  As soon as you see the sorry state of the Bucket's shack it is clear this is one of his films, and the Teutonic architecture of the Chocolate Factory and the gardens of earthly delights inside is only more evidence for the inevitable conclusion that Burton is the perfect director for Dahl's story.Actually I liked the parts of this 2005 that took place outside the Chocolate Factory more than the trip inside, which is partially because basically the same things happen to the other kids that happened in the other film (and, I believe I can safely presume, in Dahl's book).  Before the journey inside Charlie's grandparents keep trying to steal all of the scenes inside the shack, but there is something endearing about a poor but happy family (think the Cratchits with another generation thrown into the mix, albeit all in one bed).  However, the best part of the film comes at the end when we go beyond the happy ending of the original film, and not just because it is something different.Freddie Highmore provides the same sort of simple, naturalistic performance he did in ""Finding Neverland.""  Consequently he makes Charlie a rather ordinary good kid, so that he comes out ahead on his own and not simply by default because the other children are such brats.  I found Johnny Depp's peculiar way of speaking as Willie Wonka to be pretty effective (clearly he is in his own little world) and commiserate with the focus this time around on Charlie rather than the chocolate maker.  As for the idea that Depp's performance is based on Michael Jackson, I have to say that I do not see it.

This is simply a different ""version"" of the same story, only this one is not as loosely adapted as Willy Wonka.Personally I love both movies equally. Burton's has the hotter quirkier Wonka with father issues & a far less annoying Charlie. The secondary characters were cleverly modernized from the 60s book & made to address certain unhealthy addictions, but the music is horrible & just using one guy for all the Oompa Loompas was lame when many actors of short stature would have loved to have been in it; just as bad as Peter Jackson not using real little people to play Hobbits & Dwarves. WW has the funnier Wonka, though with less background & character development, & fantastic music but with a less interesting ending. It's pretty much impossible for Gene Wilder not to be funny.Imagine how much darker C&TCF; & AiW would have been if not produced by Disney & if Burton had actually written the scripts himself. Author Ronald Dahl, creator of the source material, would have loved that, because he despised the 70s movie for it's divergence & lightheartedness, so much so that he denied the rights to make a movie of Charlie & the Great Glass Elevator, which is a pity because the music would have been great & it would have been one more Gene Wilder movie to enjoy.",4,"This is not a ""remake.""",1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,1639,"['Burton', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'qualify', 'remakes', 'are', 'based', 'books', 'not', 'older', 'movies', 'Frankenweenie', '2012', 'will', 'qualify', 'remake.In', 'order', 'be', 'remake', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'be', 'based', 'common', 'source', 'material', 'have', 'same', 'music', 'not', 'diverge', 'characters', 'story', 'simply', 'different', 'version', 'same', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'loosely', 'adapted', 'Willy', 'Wonka.Personally', 'love', 'movies', 'equally', 'Burton', 'hotter', 'quirkier', 'Wonka', 'father', 'issues', 'far', 'less', 'annoying', 'Charlie', 'secondary', 'characters', 'were', 'cleverly', 'modernized', '60s', 'book', 'made', 'address', 'certain', 'unhealthy', 'addictions', 'music', 'horrible', 'just', 'using', 'one', 'guy', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'was', 'lame', 'when', 'many', 'actors', 'short', 'stature', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'not', 'using', 'real', 'little', 'people', 'play', 'Hobbits', 'Dwarves', 'WW', 'funnier', 'Wonka', 'less', 'background', 'character', 'development', 'fantastic', 'music', 'less', 'interesting', 'ending', 'pretty', 'much', 'impossible', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'not', 'be', 'funny.Imagine', 'how', 'much', 'darker', 'C', 'TCF', 'AiW', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'produced', 'Disney', 'Burton', 'had', 'actually', 'written', 'scripts', 'Author', 'Ronald', 'Dahl', 'creator', 'source', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'despised', '70s', 'movie', 'divergence', 'lightheartedness', 'so', 'much', 'denied', 'rights', 'make', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Great', 'Glass', 'Elevator', 'pity', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'more', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'movie', 'enjoy']",N/A

Gene Wilder's ""Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" was tongue-in-cheek delightful in 1971 and, here, Tim Burton creates another masterful rendition - without LSD!!Young Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket is a refreshingly unpretentious child, with a wide-eyed innocence, a rarity among today's movie youth. I'm so sick of Haley Joel Osment (whose transformation from a child to a teen actor is as squeeky as his voice change) and Dakota Fanning (she's already developed the Hollywood Red Carpet fake-me-out ""Opened Mouth Molar Exposing Smile"" and ""The Left Leg Crossed Over The Right From The Crotch"" pose of her older contemporaries). The fabulous Helena Bonham Carter portrays a down-and-out mother with the same English grace and delicance as she does a noblewoman. But, it's under-rated actor Gordeep ""Deep"" Roy, cloned into a kazillion cavity-creating Oompa-Loompas, who really steals the show. He rocks more latex here than a Trojan factory!It's obvious that Johnny Depp puts a lot of thought into the roles that he chooses and he's not ashamed to just act a fool as evidenced by ""Ed Wood"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". But, in the wake of the Michael Jackson scandals, Johnny Depp's domino-toothed Willie Wonka is a tad disturbing. I mean, holding a contest to lure young children ""to tour your playland"" doesn't really work for me right now.However, in the spirit of the 1964 book by British writer Roald Dahl, I decided not to be too literal in watching this.

939043,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B000BB1MHS,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[3, 6]","Since I was about four years old I remember watching the 1971 version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".  I did not actually read the book until I was about sixteen.  Realizing that there were some major dispensaries between the text and that film adaptation, I began to enjoy it less and less.  I understand that book to movie adaptations are going to have many differences, and that does not bother me.  I suppose it was more that as I grew older, the 1971 version became kind of hokey.  It has its highlights and will remain a favorite of mine, but I was excited to see a new version coming out.The first thing you need to do before you see this movie is read the book.  It is very short, and about 80 pages.  If only to appreciate some of the things that are more accurately portrayed in this movie.  I actually do understand why many changes in the original film adaptation were made.  The squirrels were not at the time a very possible scene to put into film without the capabilities of CGI.  So, I understand the change to the geese, however, it is a delight to see it as it was originally envisioned in Dahl's book.  It is one of the best scenes in the movie.The film, from the beginning starts out quite a bit darker than the 1971 version.  This is after all a Tim Burton film, a man known for his dark yet colorful and flamboyant visuals.  This is Burton in top form, visuals in this really fit the tone of the book much better than did the 1971 version.  By the time we are introduced to Charlie we really understand how broke his family really is.  The house is dilapidated and falling apart, there is a hole in the roof above Charlie's head where he sleeps and every days they eat cabbage soup.  This is starkly contrasted with Wonka's factory and the other four children's decadent life-styles.The added details to the story and background of the character of Willy Wonka add a lot more depth to the character and actually makes sense of why he acts the way he does.  Although the parts with his father (played by Christopher Lee) were not in the book, they are some of the most enjoyable parts in the movie.  Watching Christopher Lee play Wilber Wonka, Willy Wonka's dentist father is absolutely a delight.  With such quotable lines as ""Lollipops, what dentist call cavities on a stick."" The theme of family ties and loyalty are much more clear in this version, and Charlie is a wiser person than the other children because rather than disregard his family and everyone else around them for a lifetime of chocolate, he puts his family and others first.  Something the 1971 film really missed the mark on with the inclusion of a scene where Charlie drinks the fizzy lifting drink.The performance by Johnny Depp is creepy and off-putting on one hand, but touching on the other, as we understand his pain and why he rejects parents because of the own rejection that he faced as a child.  Every character including the grand parents are used to greater effect here than in the 1971 film as well.  Every actor is perfectly cast, especially Freddie Highmore as Charlie, Jordan Fry as Mike Teavee, Anna-Sophia Rob as Violet, and Deep Roy as all of the Oompa Lommpas.This film is not so much a children's movie this go around as it has an abundance of dark humor that will go over children's heads, humor, which will make it  more enjoyable for adults.  At the same time, it is for this very reason that people who enjoyed the original version, do not enjoy this one, this film does not have quite the same feeling of wonderment that the 1971 film has, and for all the faithfulness to the text and intent of the author that this one has, there is one thing the 1971 film has over this one, and it is big; it is that it created a sense of anitcipation and mystery before he entered the factory and a sense of wonder and amazement when Charlie entered the factory.Since both film adaptations of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" are equally enjoyable, but for starkly contrasting reasons, it is easy to see why people are generally divided in to camps with these adaptations.God Bless ~Amy",5,"On the Whole, Much More Faithful to the Book than the 1971 Version.",1214784000,"06 30, 2008",2008,4101,"['was', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'remember', 'watching', '1971', 'version', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'about', 'sixteen', 'Realizing', 'were', 'major', 'dispensaries', 'text', 'film', 'adaptation', 'began', 'enjoy', 'less', 'less', 'understand', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'many', 'differences', 'not', 'bother', 'suppose', 'was', 'more', 'grew', 'older', '1971', 'version', 'became', 'kind', 'hokey', 'highlights', 'will', 'remain', 'favorite', 'mine', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'new', 'version', 'coming', 'out.The', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'do', 'see', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'very', 'short', '80', 'pages', 'only', 'appreciate', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'actually', 'do', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'changes', 'original', 'film', 'adaptation', 'were', 'made', 'squirrels', 'were', 'not', 'time', 'very', 'possible', 'scene', 'put', 'film', 'capabilities', 'CGI', 'So', 'understand', 'change', 'geese', 'however', 'delight', 'see', 'was', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'Dahl', 'book', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie.The', 'film', 'beginning', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'darker', '1971', 'version', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'man', 'known', 'dark', 'yet', 'colorful', 'flamboyant', 'visuals', 'Burton', 'top', 'form', 'visuals', 'really', 'fit', 'tone', 'book', 'much', 'better', 'did', '1971', 'version', 'time', 'are', 'introduced', 'Charlie', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'broke', 'family', 'really', 'house', 'dilapidated', 'falling', 'apart', 'hole', 'roof', 'Charlie', 'head', 'where', 'days', 'eat', 'cabbage', 'soup', 'starkly', 'contrasted', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'other', 'four', 'children', 'decadent', 'life-styles.The', 'added', 'details', 'story', 'background', 'character', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'add', 'lot', 'more', 'depth', 'character', 'actually', 'sense', 'why', 'way', 'parts', 'father', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'were', 'not', 'book', 'are', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'parts', 'movie', 'Watching', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'play', 'Wilber', 'Wonka', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'dentist', 'father', 'absolutely', 'delight', 'such', 'quotable', 'lines', 'Lollipops', 'what', 'dentist', 'call', 'cavities', 'stick', 'theme', 'family', 'ties', 'loyalty', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'clear', 'version', 'Charlie', 'wiser', 'person', 'other', 'children', 'rather', 'disregard', 'family', 'everyone', 'else', 'lifetime', 'chocolate', 'family', 'others', 'first', 'Something', '1971', 'film', 'really', 'missed', 'mark', 'inclusion', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlie', 'fizzy', 'lifting', 'drink.The', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'creepy', 'off-putting', 'one', 'hand', 'touching', 'other', 'understand', 'pain', 'why', 'parents', 'own', 'rejection', 'faced', 'child', 'Every', 'character', 'including', 'grand', 'parents', 'are', 'used', 'greater', 'effect', 'here', '1971', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'actor', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'especially', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'Jordan', 'Fry', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'Anna-Sophia', 'Rob', 'Violet', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Oompa', 'Lommpas.This', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'children', 'movie', 'go', 'around', 'abundance', 'dark', 'humor', 'will', 'go', 'children', 'heads', 'humor', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'reason', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'version', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'feeling', 'wonderment', '1971', 'film', 'faithfulness', 'text', 'intent', 'author', 'one', 'one', 'thing', '1971', 'film', 'over', 'one', 'big', 'created', 'sense', 'anitcipation', 'mystery', 'entered', 'factory', 'sense', 'wonder', 'amazement', 'when', 'Charlie', 'entered', 'factory.Since', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'are', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'starkly', 'contrasting', 'reasons', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'generally', 'divided', 'camps', 'adaptations.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

Who else could EVER be Willy Wonka except for Gene Wilder?  I mean the man's entire career was predicated on that ONE role that he performed so masterfully complete with strange personality and a song or two to boot!But imagine my surprise when I decide to buy the Burton-version of ""Charlie & The Chocolate Factory"" with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  As I watched this film, I couldn't believe that the actor playing Wonka was the same man who played in ""Pirates of the Carribean!""  Depp's wide range of acting skills is amazing!From the high-pitched voice to the nervous words and actions, Depp's portrayal of Wonka reveals a much more psychologically-challenged man who we get to see a glimpse of what made him that way through frequent flashbacks to his childhood.  I rather enjoyed this aspect of the movie because it filled in some blanks that were left unaccounted for in the original.As it turns out, Charlie (played by an adorable young actor with an excellent British accent) helps Wonka resolve the issues he had with his own childhood and bring resolution to years of trying to prove he was right after all.

939047,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000BB1MHS,"Maine Writer ""David""","[12, 22]","I walked out of Tim Burton's remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory amused, but unsatisfied, and certainly not how I'd expect to feel after eating one of Mr. Wonka's scrumptdiliumptious treats. Sure, there were moments of crunchy goodness, but most of the experience involved the fancy wrapping.Mr. Burton's hit or miss storytelling (he can be terrific, as in Big Fish, or horrific, as in Planet of the Apes), mainly misses here. But that isn't the worst of it.  The biggest failure of the film is Willy Wonka himself. He is a character of little or no substance, inexplicable and odd for the sake of being inexplicable and odd.  As if in a last ditch effort to give the guy some depth, this hackneyed backstory about his father (who, irony of ironies, was a dentist) was spliced in through flashbacks that might be interesting if they weren't so one-dimensional.  Instead, they do little more than interrupt the flow of the story and set up an anti-climactic ending in which Willy resolves his issues with his father by visiting him.I must confess that I really like the original film version of the story. And it is in contrast to that gem of a film that the weaknesses of Burton's version stand out.  The Charlie of the first movie isn't a uni-dimensional angel (selfless, unflappable, never tempted), and his character is defined by a remarkable ending that offers him more temptation than even the best child ought to be able to resist.  The new Charlie, well, is perfect, start to finish.  Where's the challenge (and character development) in that?  Burton eschewed the important story features (the Slugworth bribe offers) that made the trip through the chocolate factory a rolling moral conundrum.  Burton offers no replacement story device to preserve this important subplot (instead, we get the Wonka backstory). One point of dissonance, though, is the scene in which Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and, without a second thought, uses it to buy candy. With the set up that Charlie is completely selfless, and that even a thin dime might help his starving, destitute family, his decision to keep and use the money was jarring. What lesson are we to take away from this?  Finders keepers?  (In the original film, Charlie finds a coin in a gutter ... a coin is one thing; a ten dollar bill quite another. Inflation isn't the answer. If Burton had thought about it, he might have had Charlie give the money to the candy store owner to await a claim by the real owner, and perhaps been given a candy bar as a reward.)Wilder's performance was one of depth and substance. Even without a backstory, you come away knowing exactly who Willy Wonka is: an extremely smart, wise, and artistic man who is on a mission to find a truly good kid.  Not a perfect one, mind you (Charlie, after all, stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, another episode that doesn't make it to Burton's film), but one of solid, core decency.  Wilder's character's sly comments, his fluency in multiple languages, and his knowing disdain for the creeps who've found his tickets present the picture of a person who ought to be telling us a story of right and wrong, of good kids and bad.  (Burton doesn't even have the sense to realize that it is better that we not know the fate of Charlie's competitors, leaving us to wonder whether they made it or not, and not really caring.  Instead, he leads them out of the factory like a parade of CGI.  Did we need that?  Of course not.)Depp's Wonka doesn't even come close to Wilder's.  He's an empty, Michael Jacksonesque misanthrope without a clue.  He doesn't seem particularly interested in Charlie, or even to recognize what makes Charlie special. They just seem to end up together because everyone else gets taken away. Even at that point, there is no meaningful interaction between them.There were moments of charm and humor in Willy Wonka; a twisted sense of humor infects some good scenes.  But the story is weak, and Willy himself is weaker.  Add to that genuinely uninspired and forgettable songs and dialogue that attempts to ""explain"" too much, and you have another remake than ought to have stayed unmade.",3,Decent enough.,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,4146,"['walked', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'remake', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'amused', 'unsatisfied', 'certainly', 'not', 'how', ""'d"", 'expect', 'feel', 'eating', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'scrumptdiliumptious', 'treats', 'Sure', 'were', 'moments', 'crunchy', 'goodness', 'most', 'experience', 'involved', 'fancy', 'wrapping.Mr', 'Burton', 'hit', 'miss', 'storytelling', 'can', 'be', 'terrific', 'Big', 'Fish', 'horrific', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'mainly', 'here', ""n't"", 'worst', 'biggest', 'failure', 'film', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'character', 'little', 'substance', 'inexplicable', 'odd', 'sake', 'being', 'inexplicable', 'odd', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'give', 'guy', 'depth', 'hackneyed', 'backstory', 'father', 'who', 'irony', 'ironies', 'was', 'dentist', 'was', 'spliced', 'flashbacks', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'one-dimensional', 'Instead', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'anti-climactic', 'ending', 'Willy', 'issues', 'father', 'visiting', 'him.I', 'must', 'confess', 'really', 'original', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'contrast', 'gem', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'Burton', 'version', 'stand', 'Charlie', 'first', 'movie', ""n't"", 'uni-dimensional', 'angel', 'selfless', 'unflappable', 'never', 'tempted', 'character', 'defined', 'remarkable', 'ending', 'more', 'temptation', 'even', 'best', 'child', 'ought', 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'new', 'Charlie', 'well', 'perfect', 'start', 'finish', 'Where', 'challenge', 'character', 'development', 'Burton', 'eschewed', 'important', 'story', 'features', 'Slugworth', 'bribe', 'offers', 'made', 'trip', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'rolling', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'Burton', 'replacement', 'story', 'device', 'preserve', 'important', 'subplot', 'instead', 'get', 'Wonka', 'backstory', 'One', 'point', 'dissonance', 'scene', 'Charlie', 'ten', 'dollar', 'bill', 'snow', 'second', 'thought', 'buy', 'candy', 'set', 'up', 'Charlie', 'completely', 'selfless', 'even', 'thin', 'dime', 'might', 'help', 'starving', 'destitute', 'family', 'decision', 'keep', 'use', 'money', 'was', 'jarring', 'What', 'lesson', 'are', 'take', 'away', 'Finders', 'keepers', 'original', 'film', 'Charlie', 'coin', 'gutter', 'coin', 'one', 'thing', 'ten', 'dollar', 'bill', 'quite', 'Inflation', ""n't"", 'answer', 'Burton', 'had', 'thought', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Charlie', 'give', 'money', 'candy', 'store', 'owner', 'await', 'claim', 'real', 'owner', 'perhaps', 'been', 'given', 'candy', 'bar', 'reward', 'Wilder', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'depth', 'substance', 'Even', 'backstory', 'come', 'away', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'who', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'extremely', 'smart', 'wise', 'artistic', 'man', 'who', 'mission', 'find', 'truly', 'good', 'kid', 'Not', 'perfect', 'one', 'mind', 'Charlie', 'stole', 'Fizzy', 'Lifting', 'Drinks', 'episode', ""n't"", 'make', 'Burton', 'film', 'one', 'solid', 'core', 'decency', 'Wilder', 'character', 'sly', 'comments', 'fluency', 'multiple', 'languages', 'knowing', 'disdain', 'creeps', 'who', ""'ve"", 'found', 'tickets', 'present', 'picture', 'person', 'who', 'ought', 'be', 'telling', 'story', 'right', 'wrong', 'good', 'kids', 'bad', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'sense', 'realize', 'better', 'not', 'know', 'fate', 'Charlie', 'competitors', 'leaving', 'wonder', 'made', 'not', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'Instead', 'factory', 'parade', 'CGI', 'Did', 'need', 'course', 'not', 'Depp', 'Wonka', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'Wilder', 'empty', 'Michael', 'Jacksonesque', 'misanthrope', 'clue', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'interested', 'Charlie', 'even', 'recognize', 'what', 'Charlie', 'special', 'just', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'everyone', 'else', 'taken', 'away', 'Even', 'point', 'meaningful', 'interaction', 'them.There', 'were', 'moments', 'charm', 'humor', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'infects', 'good', 'scenes', 'story', 'weak', 'Willy', 'weaker', 'Add', 'genuinely', 'uninspired', 'forgettable', 'songs', 'dialogue', 'explain', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'remake', 'ought', 'have', 'stayed', 'unmade']",N/A

I thought the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, along with Johnny Depp could possibly turn things around for me, and it did, in a way... the movie wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.  It's sort of an in-between movie.There were flashes of brilliance, such as the over the top Oompa Loompa songs (especially the one following Augustus Gloop getting sucked up into the vacuum -- brilliant!), and I also like how this movie went more into detail about why Willy Wonka is the way he is, and why he's obsessed with chocolate.  That was something the original movie completely neglected, and I thought Burton did a great job implementing into the movie.There were also some epic fails, such as the Oompa Loompa's themselves.  Every single Oompa Loompa was the same actor, just CGI'd into a hundred different ones.  The original movie had a bunch of ""Little People"" playing the part, which I thought was a much better way of going about it.  I also didn't care for some of the obscure Tim Burton oddities, such as the crooked, Sleepy Hollow looking house Charlie's family lived in, amongst other things.  Johnny Depp delivered a pretty solid performance as Willy Wonka, but he didn't even come close to Gene Wilder's portrayal.  Depp in comparison was like comparing a minor leaguer to an All-Star professional.The characters in the movie were excellent. I thought they did a great job with the casting, and the the kids all did great jobs.  I especially liked the new Charlie.  I liked him even better than the original Charlie.  I didn't care for the new Grandpa Joe, however.  Tim Burton, in his typical fashion, picked just about the ugliest man you'll ever see in your life as Grandpa Joe.

939056,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000BB1MHS,Mark Baker,"[3, 5]","I'm not normally a Tim Burton fan.  Just the previews of his movies usually look weird enough to me that I pass right on by.  But, since this was a new version of one of my favorite books from childhood, I had to give it a chance.To be honest, I've never been a fan of the original movie version, either.  It took too many liberties with the story, changing the entire makeup of Charlie in the process and missing the point of the story.  But that's a rant for a different review.  The reason I bring it up here is because I went into this one hoping to love it and without the baggage of liking the previous one.The story is rather straightforward.  Charlie Bucket comes from a poor family that is barely making ends meet.  It gets even worse after his father looses his job.Charlie loves chocolate, which he gets one day a year - his birthday.  To make matters worse, he lives in the same town as the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, the best candy factory in the world.One day, Willy Wonka announces that he will open his factory to five lucky kids who find the golden tickets in his candy bars.  As the winners come in, they are all selfish, obnoxious children.  Charlie doesn't have a chance of getting to go.  Or does he?  And what wonders await the winners in the factory?The movie is visually stunning.  This is a playground I would love to visit in person.  The colors are vibrant and everything is interesting.  Tim Burton obviously had a wonderful time creating the visuals to match the book.  In addition, much of the humor remains, including great puns and the wonderful scene with the chocolate mansion.Speaking of the book, this movie does a better job of sticking to the story in most areas, but especially in one key area, Charlie.  While he can come across as a goody-two-shoes at times (a problem with the book as well), just about anyone would with the obnoxious brats for comparison.  The original movie tried to fix that problem, but I much prefer him this way.The movie gets so much of the basic plot right, any fan of the book will love it.  With the advance of special effects, the story is brought to visual life in ways that weren't possible 30 years ago when the original came out.  While the characters have been modernized a little, it adds to the story rather then detracts from it.The real problem comes with the added back-story.  Willy Wonka now has a past involving a dentist father who hated candy.  Frankly, it more detracts then adds to the plot since the point of the movie is the wonders of the factory itself.  It also throws in a theme of the importance of family relationships that seems tacked on to the theme we see most of the time about the importance of behavior and manners.Compounding this is Johnny Depp's weird portrayal of Willy Wonka.  I knew from the previews to expect it, but it still was too over the top.  I left the theater wondering why he wanted to open up his factory period.  Granted, the character is supposed to be a crazy eccentric, but he was never this cold and almost creepy.This movie does have many things going for it.  The visuals, characters, and effects are great.  It's less likely to scare kids then the original, too.  Tim Burton's desire to add a back-story ultimately backfired, however, leaving the book as the best way to familiarize yourself with this story.",4,"Better Then the Original, But Still Not the Definitive Take on the Book",1131580800,"11 10, 2005",2005,3345,"[""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fan', 'Just', 'previews', 'movies', 'usually', 'look', 'weird', 'enough', 'pass', 'right', 'was', 'new', 'version', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'childhood', 'had', 'give', 'chance.To', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'original', 'movie', 'version', 'either', 'took', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'story', 'changing', 'entire', 'makeup', 'Charlie', 'process', 'missing', 'point', 'story', 'rant', 'different', 'review', 'reason', 'bring', 'here', 'went', 'one', 'hoping', 'love', 'baggage', 'liking', 'previous', 'one.The', 'story', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'poor', 'family', 'barely', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'even', 'worse', 'father', 'job.Charlie', 'chocolate', 'one', 'day', 'year', 'birthday', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'same', 'town', 'mysterious', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'best', 'candy', 'factory', 'world.One', 'day', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'will', 'open', 'factory', 'five', 'lucky', 'kids', 'who', 'find', 'golden', 'tickets', 'candy', 'bars', 'winners', 'come', 'are', 'selfish', 'obnoxious', 'children', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'getting', 'go', 'what', 'wonders', 'await', 'winners', 'factory', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'playground', 'would', 'love', 'visit', 'person', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'everything', 'interesting', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'obviously', 'had', 'wonderful', 'time', 'creating', 'visuals', 'match', 'book', 'addition', 'much', 'humor', 'including', 'great', 'puns', 'wonderful', 'scene', 'chocolate', 'mansion.Speaking', 'book', 'movie', 'better', 'job', 'sticking', 'story', 'most', 'areas', 'especially', 'one', 'key', 'area', 'Charlie', 'can', 'come', 'goody-two-shoes', 'times', 'problem', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'anyone', 'would', 'obnoxious', 'brats', 'comparison', 'original', 'movie', 'tried', 'fix', 'problem', 'much', 'prefer', 'way.The', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'basic', 'plot', 'right', 'fan', 'book', 'will', 'love', 'advance', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'brought', 'visual', 'life', 'ways', 'were', ""n't"", 'possible', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'original', 'came', 'out', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'modernized', 'little', 'story', 'rather', 'then', 'it.The', 'real', 'problem', 'added', 'back-story', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'now', 'past', 'involving', 'dentist', 'father', 'who', 'hated', 'candy', 'Frankly', 'more', 'detracts', 'then', 'plot', 'point', 'movie', 'wonders', 'factory', 'also', 'theme', 'importance', 'family', 'relationships', 'tacked', 'theme', 'see', 'most', 'time', 'importance', 'behavior', 'manners.Compounding', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'weird', 'portrayal', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'knew', 'previews', 'expect', 'still', 'was', 'too', 'top', 'left', 'theater', 'wondering', 'why', 'wanted', 'open', 'up', 'factory', 'period', 'Granted', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'crazy', 'eccentric', 'was', 'never', 'cold', 'almost', 'creepy.This', 'movie', 'have', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'visuals', 'characters', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'less', 'likely', 'scare', 'kids', 'then', 'original', 'too', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'desire', 'add', 'back-story', 'ultimately', 'backfired', 'however', 'leaving', 'book', 'best', 'way', 'familiarize', 'story']",N/A

I'm well over it now, and he just keeps hitting them out of the park as far as I'm concerned.I was a fan of the Gene Wilder film version of this story, and wasn't quite sure how I'd feel about this newer film.  The flick feels like a Tim Burton adventure from the get-go, from the Danny Elfman music to the dumpy, lopsided house in congested isolation right next to the middle of the action, to the dark-yet-lush, Burtonesque colors.It might have been risky casting Freddie Highmore (Depp's young co-star in Finding Neverland) as Charlie, but the young actor was perfect in the role.  In fact, I can't complain about any of the casting.  Helena Bonham Carter was the grunged up, wonderfully understated mom of Charlie, and the boy's whole extended family all fit nicely.  Christopher Lee took his place dutifully and expertly as Willie Wonka's estranged father.  Everything fit here.  The riskiest move was using Deep Roy, long-time English short-guy, as all of the Oompa Loompas, but I believe he pulled it off.Depp, though, carried the movie for me.  He could have been a silly Willie Wonka, or he could have not given nearly enough.  I think that he did a triple flip and stuck it.

As with most remakes, folks tend to compare the original with the remake.  With this film, there really shouldn't be any of that.  Tim Burton's film based on the story by Mr. Dahl is a unique and fresh take on the story, not a shot for shot remake of the 1971 classic.  Burton's film sets its own course and does a damn fine job of doing so.  The visual look of this film can hardly be put into words but if you had to it would only fit into one: amazing.  The inside of the factory is stunning and breathtakingly beautiful and even the Bucket's modest home holds a certain visual appeal.  The whole visuality of this film has the look of a dream or of another world altogether.  The casting in my humble opinion is the only slight flaw of this film.  The supporting cast was about as good as could be expected but I didn't particularly care for the casting of Grandpa Joe or Charlie.  I loved Johnny Depp as the quirky and wacky Willy Wonka.  His performance flat out makes the film.  His energy and style shine through in every scene he's in.  While watching this film, you almost wanted to be a kid again and be one of those lucky five to walk through the enchanted halls and rooms of the incredible Wonka chocolate factory.

I consider both films classics. Depp's Wonka is much weirder and less benevolent than Gene Wilder's Wonka, but they both bring Dahl's eccentric character to life in different, but legitimate, ways. The visual world is as odd and fantastic as ever in a Tim Burton film, especially Wonka's factory. One thing I was wondering about was exactly how Burton was going to introduce Wonka. In the original, there is this terrific build-up to the ""reveal"" of Willy Wonka, where Gene Wilder comes limping out with a cane and his head down, then suddenly rolls into a back flip. I thought, ""How will Burton do it? Can he beat that?"" Well, he beat it, and the introduction of Wonka to the kids as they approach the factory is perhaps the best moment of the whole film.",5,Burton and Wonka are both weird,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,1256,"['Now', 'quirky', 'weirdness', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'best', 'Wash', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'mind', 'watch', 'think', 'rather', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Big', 'Fish', 'usual', 'film', 'remake', 'film', 'considered', 'classic', 'generated', 'much', 'controversy', 'Why', 'remake', 'classic', 'filmmakers', 'said', 'were', ""n't"", 'remaking', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'were', 'making', 'adaptation', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'children', 'novel', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'consider', 'films', 'classics', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'much', 'weirder', 'less', 'benevolent', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Wonka', 'bring', 'Dahl', 'eccentric', 'character', 'life', 'different', 'legitimate', 'ways', 'visual', 'world', 'odd', 'fantastic', 'ever', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'especially', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'wondering', 'about', 'was', 'exactly', 'how', 'Burton', 'was', 'going', 'introduce', 'Wonka', 'original', 'terrific', 'build-up', 'reveal', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'where', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'limping', 'out', 'cane', 'head', 'down', 'then', 'suddenly', 'back', 'flip', 'thought', 'How', 'will', 'Burton', 'do', 'Can', 'beat', 'Well', 'beat', 'introduction', 'Wonka', 'kids', 'approach', 'factory', 'perhaps', 'best', 'moment', 'whole', 'film']",N/A

But with Burton and Depp you can't really go wrong.And the movie is fun, it's pretty close to the book, with some updates to our time. Depp is brilliant as Willie Wonka. He sometimes sounds like Dr. Evil, Frances McDormand in 'Fargo' and other characters he himself played.the special effects are all in good order as you would expect. Pay special attention to the remarks about other movies. I have spotted Edward Scissorhands, the Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, Space Oddity and Dracula (Christopher Lee is in it, and there is a scene where WW rises up from a table, dracula-style).

Daneker,"[0, 1]","Depp almost holds this film together, but the pointless flashbacks and altered ending nearly kill it.Feeling as forced as constipation, sudden, poorly timed, terribly set-up and useless to the story are Wonka's flashbacks. Now Burton didn't change the title, he left Charlies name at the top, not Wonkas and rightfully so, but he turned the focus away from Charlie and to the depraved childhood of Wonka.The flashbacks are not Rould Dahl material, they don't meld into the movie and they don't help. Now, if Candy doesn't have to have a point, why does Willy Wonka??? Seeing him as a kid in braces and a full head brace that holds his mouth open for the supposed benifit of strait teeth, does nothing but distract from the tale of five children that the book was about. Four brats, how they did themselves in and how Charlie never did.Quickly the story feels broken, like the tour is the unimportant part, the five golden ticket holders are secondary characters and it's Wonka's boring, not in the book, childhood that we are supposed to be following.Finally, we get to the ""great glass elevator"" and realize there is no sequel coming because the thing's way too small. At this point I started loosing hope. I had suffered through three Umpa Loompa songs with music so loud that I couldn't hear the lyrics (lifted, wisely from the book, but set to Seventies-pop grooves for reasons we will never know).Finally the Great Glass Elevator takes off, Charlie learns the factory is his and when we should go get the old folks and parents head into space (and a what-could-have-been sequel) we get a prudish, parent hating Wonka stating that Charlie may not bring his family to the factory. He leaves, alone, then comes back and with Charlie visits his estranged father (and just when I thought the love story in Titanic was forced and fake and a big mistake!) who has been a closet Willy Wonka follower since his son left to make candy (the ultimate sin to Dentist Dad)Now do we blast off? Do we finish the movie with the glorious shot of the elevator ascending into the upper atmosphere? No! We end with all the old folks dressed and out of bed, eating holiday dinner and living in the factory with Charlie and Wonka. Is this ending better? No! It's bland, it's not the story Dahl wrote, it serves no purpose.I am not a book purist, I love the third Harry Potter film more than the more faithful first two, I think LOTR is brilliant and I've read the book 5 times, but with this film the changes where un-called for and distracting, the detracted from the fun of the story.Now, why four stars??? Because if you cut all the Wonka flashbacks you have a near verbatim adaptation of the book, good actors, and lots of entertainment.

I don't ever remember watching the original with Gene Wilder - but then I don't remember ever watching the original Oliver, but I used to have it taped off the TV, so I guess I must have watched it at some point. It's probably the same for the original.Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Christopher Walken, Nicolas Cage, Will Smith, Brad Pitt, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Michael Keaton were all considered for the role of Willy Wonka. Marilyn Manson also badly wanted the part. I could quite imagine Marilyn Manson in the part actually, but there's something not quite right about Johnny Depp in this. I dunno what it was. Maybe it was because he's not in the least bit attractive in this (you'd have to be of a sick mind to find THAT attractive), or maybe it just didn't work. Tim Burton & Johnny Depp made a pretty good team in other movies, but just not in this one. I think they failed.Also, there was way too many special effects. Not something you would normally complain about, but basically, Tim used every effect in the book. And it's just too glossy in the end. The Oompa-Loompas are very weird also, and the songs were slightly nauseating.However, I did like Freddie Highmore in this - hopefully he won't turn out to be a precocious child actor. I also liked the fact we got a brief glimpse into Willy Wonka's childhood, and how he came to be the master of chocolate. It was quite interesting, but the brace was a little freaky - but apparently, that was taken from Tim's childhood.Also, I loved how the grandparents were brought to life, all those years ago when I first read the book. They were exactly how I imagined them, and it was fabulous.I think the glass elevator was incorporated into this, simply so there wouldn't be a sequel. I'm hoping so anyway, but as I say, I can't remember much of the sequel, because I couldn't get into it. Some of the buttons on the glass elevator say: Incompetent Fools; T-Bone Steak Jell-O; Secretarial Poodles; Cocoa Cats; Mechanical Clouds; Stars in their Pies; Nice Plums; Up And Out; Fragile Egos; Black Box of Frogs; Weird Lollipops; Mighty Jam Monitor; Creative Dog Flip; Elastic Forest; Leaky Canes; Dessert Island; People Poo; Pie Cream; Spewed Vegetables; Naffy Taffy; Lickety Split Peas; Honeycombs and Brushes and Old Sneezes and Smells Dept.It was very faithful to the book, although I think, if I can remember correctly (it has been quite a few years), the ending is a little bit different, as that bit was all new to me.I'm still not sure about Johnny's portrayal of Willy Wonka, it's quite disturbing actually.

939070,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B000BB1MHS,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[0, 0]","When I first heard that a re-make of ""Chocolate Factory"" was being planned with Tim Burton at the helm, I couldn't have been more pleased. I have long been a fan of the book but loathed the 70's treacle of Gene Wilder's film; the forced, insane cheeriness was highly unsuitable for the strange and somewhat sadistic rages against the evils of sloth and spoiledness that Dahl's book comprised. And Johnny Depp's collaborations with Burton have usually produced spectacular results, so I was very pleased to know that he would be starring.Unfortunately, the combination is less than inspired this time. The film's performances range from sketchy to perfection. Bizarrely, Johnny Depp's lands squarely in the middle of the spectrum, hardly something I expected from an actor I consider to be one of the finest...ever. His Wonka is just...weird. And not in a pleasant way. With his pasty skin, strange make-up, alarmingly perfect teeth, and honeyed, meretricious voice and mannerisms, he conjures up disturbing images of Michael Jackson, or perhaps the bizarre love-child of Jackson and Carol Channing. He is certainly a unique character - I've never seen Depp quite like this before - and it's a brave and risky performance, but it is just too freakish to quite be acceptable onscreen. Wonka would certainly be a bizarre social recluse, perhaps even a compulsive performer, but he is also here so weird and even sadistic that I found myself very uncomfortable at the prospect of him sharing space with children, even those as unpleasant as the four obnoxious miscreants. I was also slightly perplexed, too, by the fact that Wonka is seemingly more comfortable with the childrens' guardians than the children themselves; he cannot even bring himself to say the word ""parents"" and his own familial relationships are strained, to say the least. Given the fact that Burton has conceived of Wonka's Chocolate Factory as a child-like wonderland of a playground, and that Depp plays him as a boy who refuses to grow up, it doesn't make much sense for him to be so VERY uncomfortable around the children.Freddie Highmore, however, is absolutely amazing. He is not given much to say, and in fact is not center-screen as much as I had expected, but he steals every scene he is in. Not since Christian Bale in ""Empire of the Sun"" has there been such an adorable and absolutely prodigiously gifted young actor. I cannot be over-effusive in my praise. Highmore's performance is easily the most phenomenal and engaging in the film; with his sparkling brown eyes, teacup ears, freckled nose, and boyish grin, he is completely loveable and inspires absolute trust. His Charlie Bucket is ever-so decent, responsible, dependable, and sweet-natured, and yet Highmore conveys all this without ever making him maudlin, obnoxious, or treacly. There is no trace of bathos in his performance, a surprisingly difficult feat which he accomplishes perfectly. We can see why Wonka is willing to entrust his candy empire to Charlie, and why his grandfather would give up what would seem to be his last dollar to buy him another shot at the Golden Ticket.David Kelly as Grandpa Joe is endearing and another of the films fine performances, though sadly he and Charlie are not given much time to interact. Have we not all longed at one time or another for a grandparent like Grandpa Joe? He is old but still retains a rather sharp-edged humour, and his eyes twinkle frequently with delight and kindness. He is a pleasure to watch onscreen, even when he and the other guests are being visually (and otherwise) assaulted by the Factory.The Oompa-Loompas are actually one of the better things about this film, all played by the slightly menacing Indian actor Deep Roy. The musical numbers celebrating (there is no other word for it) the naughty childrens' fates are still here, but their styles range from Bollywood to disco to 80s pop, and are show-stoppers in their own right. They are, happily, not orange, and not particularly pleasant either; one feels slightly uneasy whenever they are around, and it is usually a justified discomfort.The visual design is the best aspect of the film (apart from Highmore). Tim Burton has gone wildly overboard with his fantasy world, but it is here not only justified but absolutely necessary. I particularly loved the Buckets' house: it leans so drunkenly that it could not possibly exist in reality, and bits and pieces of it are artistically missing. Charlie's grandparents all sleep (and apparently live) in the same bedraggled brass bed in the centre of the tiny main room, and Charlie himself sleeps in a nearly-roofless garrett with a view of the great Factory.The candyland of the Chocolate Factory is a child's idea of paradise, with its chocolate river and edible grass and foliage, but it also is appropriately Burtonesque in its suggestion of danger as well as delight: you can eat everything in there, but there is a possibility it could devour you too. Even the peppermint willow trees bend ominously over the riverbanks, stretching their red-and-white-striped branches out like skinny fingers in that peculiar way that only Burton's trees do. The wild ride down the Chocolate River in the flaming-pink candy-Dragon boat (a delight to look at) is inspired and a pleasure to watch, though the suggestion of slave labor (the Oompa-Loompas row the boat to the pounding of a drum strangely reminiscent of Ben-Hur's) adds another appropriately dark touch to Wonka's paradise. The trained squirrels who mete out the spoiled Veruca Salt's punishment were particularly impressive; apparently Burton had some twenty squirrels actually trained for the part and then replicated them with CG, which means these little furry things are unnervingly realistic. As anyone who shares space with squirrels knows, they can be quite menacing creatures, and Burton captures this very well; this sequence is possibly the most disturbing and uncomfortable in its suggestion of violence in the film, but it works. The effects are generally well-used in the film, though always maintaining a certain air of artificiality that becomes the tone of the piece. The opening sequence, an aerial trip through the Chocolate Factory, is thrilling and inspired.Ultimately, there are some very enjoyable moments in this film, particularly the scenes with Charlie and the rest of the Bucket family, but they do not coalesce into a proper whole. One is frequently agape and frequently left staring in slack-jawed wonderment at the Factory and its wonders, as are Wonka's guests, but sometimes it feels like we are not awe-struck but merely dumb-struck. The tone of the film is manic, almost distracted in places (much like Depp's performance) and never lets the audience really become engaged with it.

The film stays pretty close to Roald Dahl's book and the original movie adaptation, although there's this weird thing at the end regarding Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) father and the whole issue of family. Overall, though, I was impressed with this movie. The special effects are excellent, and the children are all hilarious and perfectly cast. (I especially loved watching Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket...that kid is so adorable!) The Oompa-Loompas are spectacular...they were all digitally multiplied and portrayed by the same actor, Deep Roy, who is very funny.Some people have criticized Depp's performance as Wonka, but I think it was brilliant. He really made the role his own by building upon the quirkiness of the character, which resulted in a fresh interpretation of the role that is drastically different from Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka, but not at all bad. I also loved the way that Willy Wonka's skin was the same grayish color of a human cadaver...that's Tim Burton for you! It really added to the overall creepiness of the movie.This is a very good film and is one of the best remakes to come out of Hollywood in some time.",4,A solid remake of a classic story,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1231,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'remaking', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'film', 'pretty', 'close', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'book', 'original', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'weird', 'thing', 'end', 'regarding', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'father', 'whole', 'issue', 'family', 'Overall', 'was', 'impressed', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'excellent', 'children', 'are', 'hilarious', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'especially', 'loved', 'watching', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'kid', 'so', 'adorable', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'are', 'spectacular', 'were', 'digitally', 'multiplied', 'portrayed', 'same', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'very', 'funny.Some', 'people', 'have', 'criticized', 'Depp', 'performance', 'Wonka', 'think', 'was', 'brilliant', 'really', 'made', 'role', 'own', 'building', 'quirkiness', 'character', 'resulted', 'fresh', 'interpretation', 'role', 'drastically', 'different', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'version', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'not', 'bad', 'also', 'loved', 'way', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'skin', 'was', 'same', 'grayish', 'color', 'human', 'cadaver', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'really', 'added', 'overall', 'creepiness', 'movie.This', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'remakes', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'time']",N/A
939072,A9BC9ZVINYMHQ,B000BB1MHS,"Meredith Burton ""Bookworm""","[1, 1]","Roald Dahl is an excellent author for both children and adults, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is by far his best book, although ""The Witches"" is a very close second. This movie adaptation of Dahl's masterpice for children is both humorous and poignant. The Jean Wilder version is superb as well, surpassing this one only because of the excellent songs. However, Burton's version has catchy songs as well which are sung by the Ompa Lompa's, and that are adapted from actual poems within Dahl's book.Everyone should know the famous plot line of this superb story: a poverty-stricken little boy named Charlie Bucket loves chocolate and seeks to find a Golden Ticket hidden within an ordinary looking Wonka candy bar. Willy Wonka is the most famous and extraordinary candy maker in the world, and has decided to allow just five children to tour his famous factory. Four of the children, Agustus Gloop, Violet Bauregarde, Veruca Salt, and Mike Teavee are obnoxious and overly indulged by their equally despicable parents. Only Charlie is virtuous and truly deserving of finding a Golden Ticket. What will happen when each child succumbs to their own greed and disobey Willy Wonka's orders? The story is both fun and moralistic.Burton's adaptation is very true to Dahl's book, and includes scenes which are not in the original movie, but are in the novel. For instance, the stories told by Grandpa Joe to Charlie are included, and the sceen about Veruca Salt has squirrels instead of geese, which are the appropriate animals. Also, Charlie Bucket is from England, which is true in the book as well. Burton  adds an interesting touch by relating sceens from Wonka's childhood about the strained relationship between him and his dentist father who forbids his son to consume candy or to pursue his dream of becoming a chocolateer. These sceens are very poignant, and emphasise the importance of family over riches and success.All of the actors are very good, particularly Johnny Dep, and the man playing the Ompa Lompas. The boy portraying Charlie, who was also in ""Finding Neverland"" is excellent. This movie is very good and well worth watching. As a chocoholic, I recommend having plenty of candy bars on hand. You will get very hungry for sweets after watching this film.

As a child I both read and watched the movie versions although I only had a vague recollection of them going into this film. An excellent group of actors both adult and child wise. The set was colourful and very techno for the time period and the ompaas were hilarious although they might be scary for small children. Depp was an eccentric and somewhat egocentric Wonka but delightful to just look at. Other than Charlie the kids were perfectly deplorable and you can't wait to see what will happen to the next rotten child (no one is killed).

939074,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000BB1MHS,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[7, 9]","When it was first announced that director Tim Burton was filming ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", starring the talented Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, concerns were raised that it may not be as good as the original 1971 film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".  However, when the author of the original book, Roald Dahl (1916-1990), upon which both films were based saw the 1971 film, he was so disgusted that he forced the film's producers to rename it to ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"".  Though we will never know today how Roald Dahl would have reacted to the Tim Burton's 2005 version, chances are that Roald Dahl would have been far more pleased with the result.Unlike the 1971 version, the 2005 version both parents of the young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) are still alive.  His mother Mrs. Bucket (Helena Bonham Carter) and his father Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) struggle to support their son, as well as each of the aging parents: Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who had previously worked at Willy Wonka's factory, Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith, who some viewers may recognize as the character Letitia Cropley from the 1994-1996 British sitcom ""The Vicar of Dibley""), Grandpa George (David Morris) and Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell). Unfortunately, things get worse financially for the Buckets when Mr. Bucket is laid off from the toothpaste factory where he had worked; but the announcement of five golden tickets hidden within five Willy Wonka chocolate bars that will grant the winners to a visit to the mysterious chocolate factory sends the world into a frenzy to find them.  The lucky children that do find them are Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and his mother Mrs. Gloop (Franziska Troegner); Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) and her mother Mrs. Beauregarde (Missi Pyle); Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and her wealthy father Mr. Salt (James Fox); Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry) and his father Mr. Teevee (Adam Godley); and finally, Charlie Bucket, who is accompanied by Grandpa Joe.Another interesting aspect that separates this film from the original is the exploration of Willy Wonka's childhood (Little Willy is played by Blair Dunlop). His father, the eminent dentist Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee), forbids Little Willy from ever eating any candy or chocolate and forces Little Willy into a maniacal headpiece that prevents Little Willy from closing his mouth so that everyone can see the braces on his teeth.  However, Little Willy, after going trick-or-treating, finds a piece of chocolate that his father had not completely destroyed.  Upon eating it, Little Willy is obsessed with candy and chocolate, which eventually leads to Dr. Wonka abandoning Little Willy.  However, Little Willy has big plans and eventually opens his chocolate factory; but when competitors send spies into his factory, he fires all of his workers and eventually replaces them with the oompa-loompas (with the aid of special effects, each oompa-loompa is played by one actor: Deep Roy).With engaging characters, wonderful songs sung by the oompa-loompas, colorful cinematography, great dialog, superb direction and brilliant acting, I rate the 2005 ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.",5,"""...life had never been sweeter.""",1168646400,"01 13, 2007",2007,3262,"['When', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'filming', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'starring', 'talented', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'concerns', 'were', 'raised', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original', '1971', 'film', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'However', 'when', 'author', 'original', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', '1916-1990', 'films', 'were', 'based', 'saw', '1971', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'disgusted', 'forced', 'film', 'producers', 'rename', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'today', 'how', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'Tim', 'Burton', '2005', 'version', 'chances', 'are', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'pleased', 'result.Unlike', '1971', 'version', '2005', 'version', 'parents', 'young', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Bucket', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Bucket', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'struggle', 'support', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'aging', 'parents', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'David', 'Kelly', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'worked', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'Grandma', 'Georgina', 'Liz', 'Smith', 'who', 'viewers', 'may', 'recognize', 'character', 'Letitia', 'Cropley', '1994-1996', 'British', 'sitcom', 'Vicar', 'Dibley', 'Grandpa', 'George', 'David', 'Morris', 'Grandma', 'Josephine', 'Eileen', 'Essell', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'financially', 'Buckets', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Bucket', 'laid', 'off', 'toothpaste', 'factory', 'where', 'had', 'worked', 'announcement', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'hidden', 'five', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'will', 'grant', 'winners', 'visit', 'mysterious', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'world', 'frenzy', 'find', 'lucky', 'children', 'do', 'find', 'are', 'Augustus', 'Gloop', 'Philip', 'Wiegratz', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Gloop', 'Franziska', 'Troegner', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'mother', 'Mrs.', 'Beauregarde', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'Julia', 'Winter', 'wealthy', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Salt', 'James', 'Fox', 'Mike', 'Teevee', 'Jordan', 'Fry', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Teevee', 'Adam', 'Godley', 'finally', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'who', 'accompanied', 'Grandpa', 'Joe.Another', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'original', 'exploration', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'childhood', 'Little', 'Willy', 'played', 'Blair', 'Dunlop', 'father', 'eminent', 'dentist', 'Dr.', 'Wonka', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'forbids', 'Little', 'Willy', 'ever', 'eating', 'candy', 'chocolate', 'forces', 'Little', 'Willy', 'maniacal', 'headpiece', 'Little', 'Willy', 'closing', 'mouth', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'braces', 'teeth', 'However', 'Little', 'Willy', 'going', 'trick-or-treating', 'piece', 'chocolate', 'father', 'had', 'not', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'eating', 'Little', 'Willy', 'obsessed', 'candy', 'chocolate', 'eventually', 'Dr.', 'Wonka', 'abandoning', 'Little', 'Willy', 'However', 'Little', 'Willy', 'big', 'plans', 'eventually', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'when', 'competitors', 'send', 'spies', 'factory', 'workers', 'eventually', 'oompa-loompas', 'aid', 'special', 'effects', 'oompa-loompa', 'played', 'one', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', '.With', 'engaging', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'sung', 'oompa-loompas', 'colorful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'dialog', 'superb', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'rate', '2005', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",N/A
939075,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000BB1MHS,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[2, 3]","Tim Burton's movie world is almost always concerned with the dreamer and the dream: think Frank Bloom (Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney) in ""Big Fish"" and Ed Woods (Johnny Depp) in the film of the same name. But his films are also often about the search for a father, either real or emotionally as in ""Big Fish"" again and ""Edward Scissorhands.""Burton's version of the Willie Wonka story is about both, the dreamer: Willie and Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and the search for a father:  the very strange acting and looking Willie Wonka of Johnny Depp for his estranged father, Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee). Roald Dahl's source material as well as this film share the common theme of men aching from the loss of and searching for the most important relationship in a man's life: the bond between a man and his father.Burton's world is also one of perfection and beauty: think the Technicolor gone bananas neighborhood of ""Edward Scissorhands."" Philippe Roussellot's production here is likewise blindingly gorgeous and eye-poppingly dense with color and artful design.This version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is much closer to that of Dahl's in that it is wittier and likewise naughtily misanthropic than the previous Gene Wilder version. Burton's ""CATCF"" is sly and malicious, particularly in his treatment of the children that Willie tours around his factory. As in Dahl's story, these children represent a good part of the 7 Deadly sins: Gluttony in the guise of the chubby Augustus Gloop, Greed and Anger in the perfectly page-boyed and unctuous Violet Beauregarde, Pride in the obnoxious Mike Teavee (to whom Willie is perpetually saying ""Stop Mumbling, I can't understand you!"" when his speech is perfectly understandable) and Anger and Envy in the spoiled brattiness of Veruca Salt. Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and his family stand alone as the embodiment of goodness, caring and love and they alone benefit from Charlie's visit to the Factory.Burton and Depp have a great time putting these kids and their parents in their ""place"" and though it is a bit cruel, it is fun for us nonetheless: we participate in the action despite our better judgment.

They get to go inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory by trying to find 5 golden tickets in Wonka Bars. They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun. Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother.

939077,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000BB1MHS,Michael Butts,"[0, 5]","I've never really been a big fan of the Willy Wonka story, finding the original nothing more than an overblown musical misfire.  However, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp give so much life and ""weirdness"" to the Roald Dahl classic that I found myself hopelessly involved in this morality tale of greed and excess.  Although Depp is reminiscent of Michael Jackson with his pasty white face and effeminate demeanor, he infuses Willy with a dark side, which the screenwriters explain by showing us his repressed childhood (with a nice turn from Christopher Lee as his dentist father).  Add the gorgeous set pieces, the absurdly entertaining musical numbers by Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas and Depp's delightfully warped performance, and you have one strange and enjoyable movie.  The child actors are wonderful, especially Freddie Highmore as the titular Charlie and WINN DIXIE'S Annasophia Robb as the bubble gum chewing Violet.  David Kelly as grandpa and Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor as Charlie's parents are great too.  The musical score by Burton stalwart Danny Elfman is delightful; Elfman even does the singing for the Oompa Loompa songs with lyrics by the book's author, Dahl.  With no slant on Gene Wilder's original Willy, I found this movie much more enjoyable and visually stunning.",4,THE CANDY MAN CAN,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1294,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'story', 'finding', 'original', 'nothing', 'more', 'overblown', 'musical', 'misfire', 'However', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'weirdness', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'classic', 'found', 'hopelessly', 'involved', 'morality', 'tale', 'greed', 'excess', 'Depp', 'reminiscent', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'pasty', 'white', 'face', 'effeminate', 'demeanor', 'Willy', 'dark', 'side', 'screenwriters', 'explain', 'showing', 'repressed', 'childhood', 'nice', 'turn', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'dentist', 'father', 'Add', 'gorgeous', 'set', 'pieces', 'absurdly', 'entertaining', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'Depp', 'delightfully', 'warped', 'performance', 'have', 'one', 'strange', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'child', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'titular', 'Charlie', 'WINN', 'DIXIE', 'Annasophia', 'Robb', 'bubble', 'gum', 'chewing', 'Violet', 'David', 'Kelly', 'grandpa', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Noah', 'Taylor', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'musical', 'score', 'Burton', 'stalwart', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'delightful', 'Elfman', 'even', 'singing', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'book', 'author', 'Dahl', 'slant', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'original', 'Willy', 'found', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'visually', 'stunning']",N/A
939078,AWOSS0OBKHTJC,B000BB1MHS,"Michael F. Hopkins ""A Deeper Groove""","[5, 11]","The moment it became known that director Tim Burton wasgoing to make a feature film adapting author Roald Dahl'sCHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, one could anticipatetwo things. One, that Burton would present a uniquecinematic experience. With a maverick crew includingscreenwriter John August and composer/longtime creativepartner Danny Elfman, and a phenomenal cast featuringHelena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee, David Kelly asGrandpa Joe, Freddy Highmore superbly portraying centralcharacter Charlie Bucket and the incredible Johnny Deppbringing a whole-new ""wonkiness"" to Willie Wonka, Burtonunleashes all the satiric genius and narrative heart whichcharacterizes his moviemaking artistry.The second point is that Burton's film would inevitablyattract a crowd of naysayers who feel that no one shouldtouch ""their"" memories of the Gene Wilder film made some30 years before, WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.Wilder himself, a gifted master of stage and screen, isreported to have gone on record as denouncing the Burtonfilm as a remake of his film; attesting that Burton andhis associates made their film only to make money.Such comparisons are unfair and unfortunate, since theyare totally off the mark. Burton's film is no remake ofthe Wilder vehicle, which was primarily a showpiece forthe music of Broadway composers Leslie Bricusse and AnthonyNewley. The fact is that the Wilder film paid little to noattention to the ingeniously subversive whimsy of the Dahloriginal. Tight and catchy though it may be, Wilder's filmbears little of the ethical impact that continues to makeDahl's work a hallmark of Children's stories for all ages.Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY takes Dahl'smonumental book into full account at all levels. Elfman'sadapting of Dahl's original lyrics into the outrageously-telling Oompa-Loompa song & dance numbers is a clear signalthat this film is an inspired improvisation upon an untappedoriginal source, playing second fiddle to no one. Only adiversified musicmaker such as Elfman could have pulledoff the genre-crossing orchestrations which enrich thisfilm. For a composer whose roots stretch from the avantgroove of Oingo Boingo to the wry symphonic portraitswhich embody many a film of the past 15 to 20 years,CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY represents a signaturemoment in this amazing career.Depp continues to amaze audiences with his daring abilityto portray the human condition at any level, always withcompelling conviction and a healthy dose of self-depreciatingwit. Depp's Wonka is a study of precocious vulnerabilityand dogged drive. We find out that much of Wonka's creativeimpulses and inner needs stem from his own missing childhood,setting up the soul of this film and a particularly movingclimax. Christopher Lee, whose current resurgence as amaster thespian was sparked by his brief-but-pivotal rolein Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW, is no less pivotal here, and ajoy to experience. Joyous, too, is the highly-energized,gleefully-diversified of Deep Roy as ALL the Oompa-Loompas!Give this man whatever he wants!A special kudos must go to narrator Geoffrey Holder, themulti-talented artist whose cacao-rich voice alone made""Marvelous"" a source of Third World pride and audacityin the 1960s. The twinkle in his tone STILL tells volumes...Top honors for acting, however, has to go to Freddy Highmore,whose first experience with Depp in FINDING NEVERLAND was anunforgettable triumph. Even more telling in the Burton film,Highmore's youthful naivete is tinged with an incredibleemotional range and knowing depth which is the center ofthis film. If Burton's film is vital in restoring theintegrity of Dahl's original work, Highmore's performancesingularly restores Charlie Bucket as the story's centralcharacter; rescuing him from the hapless sidekick role thatthe Wilder film placed the character into. Highmore, inturn, provides Depp's Wonka with the platform fora magnificent, powerful performance.The two-disc Warner Bros. Deluxe Edition is the bestway to fully appreciate all the works that Burton,cast, and crew lovingly put into this film. A primecase for why DVDs are so special, this edition delvesinto all aspects of this production, and includes afine vignette on author Dahl himself (whose familyworked hand-in-hand with Burton here).Everything about this film is wondrous. From its macabreopening amidst the mechanizations of assembly-line procedure,to the first look at the Buckets' crooked home of hard-foughtharmony amidst the cookie-cutter sameness of urbanizedregimentation, you've walked into the off-minor world ofthe surreal and the substantial which is uniquely TimBurton's.Equally vital, this film aptly reflects upon the wild nwooly, warmingly wise world of Roald Dahl. It's nice tosee this great book become a direct source for an equallyinspired film, at long last.",5,An Inspired Presentation,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,4844,"['moment', 'became', 'known',

939079,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B000BB1MHS,Michael Zuffa,"[0, 0]","Willy Wonka (Depp) has been in seclusion for years.  One day, it is announced that Wonka has hidden five golden tickets in the wrappers of five million candy bars to be sold around the world.  Those who find the tickets will get a tour of the Wonka candy factory.  One by one, the tickets are found, and the winners are announced...Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee, and finally, Charlie Bucket.  The first four are gluttonous, spoiled, an overachiever, and a TV addict respectively.  Charlie, on the other hand, is just poor.  When the group arrives at the factory, they are all introduced into the the strange world of Willy Wonka.  Willy also tells the kids that one of them will get a special surprise.Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka with a creepy intensity.  To say that he is odd would be an understatement, and most of the time he is acting unexpectedly.  The movie itself is a treat for the eyes, as most movies by Tim Burton are.  The chocolate factory is filled with wonders, and run by the Oompa Loompas, all played by actor Deep Roy.  They steal all the scenes that they are in, providing songs about the childrens' misguided actions.I have read that Roald Dahl's family is endorsing it, and can't help but think that most people will like it, especially if they liked the original.

939082,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000BB1MHS,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[3, 6]","If you were to take a glance back upon director Tim Burton's rather humble beginnings as an animator for the Walt Disney Company, his work, albeit unaccredited, appearing in such full-length animated feature films as The Fox and the Hound and The Black Cauldron in the 1980s, you would think you were staring at an entirely different individual from the one audiences are quite familiar with today. Following the moderate success of Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, just one of the few projects Burton has taken on which have raised eye-brows given his particular taste for the strange and bizarre, he solidified his ability to direct on the big screen with two back-to-back box office successes, Beetle Juice (1988) and Batman (1989). Starting with Batman Returns, the follow-up to the original Batman film which, though certifiably a box office hit, did not live up to what audiences had come to expect, Burton experienced a bit of a slump which continued with Ed Wood and Mars Attacks. Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, returned Burton back to form, grossing nearly one-hundred million dollars by the end of its domestic run in theaters. Director Tim Burton collaborates with Johnny Depp once more, this being the fourth time together with the fifth being Corpse Bride which opens this fall, for his most eccentric project yet - an adaptation of the classic Ronald Dahl children's novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Be assured that this has not gone without its fair share of controversy from purists, being they few and far between, of the Gene Wilder musical version.The story for Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, albeit certainly a substantial improvement from the ridiculously overwrought musical production from the 1970s starring Gene Wilder, falls into the unsavory formalities which have come to mar the summer family feature, complete with wall-to-wall clich&eacute;s, failing to separate itself from the rest of the pack with the exception of Burton's conventional oddities which are common knowledge amongst movie theater patrons. Applause should be given at the very least to director Tim Burton for remaining so true to the source material on which the film is based, having the family of the late-Ronal Dahl publicly endorsing the film upon it entering production last year. However, those unfamiliar with the classic children's novel, even if only in recent years, may want to read up on it if only not to be caught off guard by the film's gothic and semi-sadistic overtones and atmosphere. And although the inclusion of a background story for a leading characters, set up via a series of flashbacks, seems a logistical decision on the part of the filmmakers and was effective enough in director Ron Howard's live-action adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on the other hand based its material on a full-length children's novel with more then enough material to go on without having to resort to stretching it as they did. Furthermore, background information pertaining to Willy Wonka's childhood and what shaped him into the eccentric candy innovator he is today eliminates the mystery, grandeur and allure the classic children's character has sustained for decades and what has made him the memorable figure he is.Johnny Depp, a regular headliner for director Tim Burton with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory being their fourth collaboration together, is amusing, if not a bit eerie, in the lead role of Willy Wonka. Supposedly, if rumors are to be believed, Johnny Depp beat out fellow competitors such as heteromorphic punk rocker Marilynn Manson for the role. Now imagine how messed up this film would have been had he been given the role. Depp who channeled British rocker Keith Richards for his outlandish performance as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl does essentially the same thing with Willy Wonka, only instead of rock n' roll he instead switches genres and imitates the vagarious behavior of pop-star Michael Jackson. It only makes sense that Depp, playing a whimsical industrial innovator with no distinct memories of his childhood and a defiant animosity to parental authority, would choose to base his performance and appearance off Michael Jackson. Obviously this does nothing in the way of comforting parents wanting to take their children to see this film but credit should be given to Johnny Depp for pushing the envelope in delivering unique, if not a bit odd, performances. Let us hope that the irony of John Depp channeling pop-star and potential pedophile Michael Jackson in a remake of the classic Ronald Dahl novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fresh off his Academy Award-nominated performance in Finding Neverland is not lost on today's audiences.In spite of his charm, Jack Albertson's sportive Grandpa Joe from the 1971 Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is in no way imitated in the performance of Irish actor David Kelly. This in turn makes the following version of Grandpa Joe all the more relatable to our own grandfathers, elderly and decrepit in physical stature and yet filled with enough spark in him at times to be almost childlike in nature, such as when Charlie discovers the last remaining golden ticket. Christopher Lee, much in the same way as Vincent Prince did in Burton's Edward Scissorhands before him, performs magnificently opposite Johnny Depp, giving a slightly bizarre and twisted perspective on the judging and yet loving father figure which shapes the son's future in defiance of his the father's best intentions. Sadly, the character of Dr. Wonka, Willy's father, decreases the imaginative mystery surrounding the classic character of Willy Wonka considerably and leads only to a rather bland and pedestrian finale, albeit a step above the Gene Wilder rendition.The problem with the character of Charlie Bucket lies not within the splendid performance of the young Freddie Highmore who also appeared alongside Johnny Depp in the Oscar nominated Finding Neverland but instead with the character himself. Sure, Charlie's purpose is to serve as the perfect foil to the other four children who are spoiled, rotten little punks who deserve whatever they have coming to them. Sadly, his personal quality is so positive, upbeat, and righteous that he is given an almost saint-like status significantly diminishing his connection with audiences. One of the very few positive aspects which can be said of the Gene Wilder musical adaptation of the Ronald Dahl novel is that it was able to make Charlie the polar opposite of the other bratty children on the chocolate tour but allowed him to remain a bit `mischievous' enough, with the help of his Grandpa Joe, to retain his humanity in the eyes of audiences who could easily relate to him. True, there was the scene in which Charlie discovers money lying in a snow bank and instead of using it to provide for his poverty-stricken family he rushes to the local convenience store to purchase a Wonka bar for himself. But seeing as how he ended up receiving the fifth and last golden ticket within that very candy bar he purchased in the convenience store, it will undoubtedly go unnoticed by audiences.Annasophia Robb is completely contemptuous as the inordinately competitive Miss Violet Beauregarde whose trademark is her ability to chew a single piece of gum for three months solid in spite of its loss of taste. The same however can not be said of her robust blue berry colored counterpart who in the eyes of Charlie's audiences strikes as being glaringly computer-animated. The fat suit, both back then and now, may seem a bit ridiculous, if not a bit laughable in light of the tremendous success of computer animation in Hollywood blockbusters, but it at least felt a bit more believable then a computer animated Annasophia Robb blown up to resemble a gigantic blue-berry. Nothing, not even computers, can exactly duplicate the likeness of a human being, even if they happen to be a fat-suit and dyed blue. And Jordan Fry is easily the least memorable child cast member in the role of Mike Teavee, a golden ticket winner who, surprisingly, lavishes in technology, particularly television, and expresses no interest in the production of chocolate or other `dumb' ideas. The musical number which marks his departure from the tour does not work as effectively as the others. Scenes imitating such memorable moments as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shower scene only add to the quirkiness of the production.Overall, Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not so much a failure, far be it from that to be sure, as it is a disappointment particularly to those who had such high expectations following the director's critically acclaimed Big Fish, this in spite of it's lack of award recognition, that this adaptation of the classic Ronald Dahl novel would be a step in the proper direction. Albeit far from the abomination which was the Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the manipulated title being just the beginning of the project's lengthy laundry list of problems, the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp presentation is honestly nothing beyond mediocre and has its own fair share of issues. For one, no matter how much actor Johnny Depp denies to the entertainment media that he did not base the eccentric behavior of the lead Willy Wonka on pop-star Michael Jackson, there are too many similarities and congruities between the two in this film for it to be merely a coincidence. How nave and stupid does Johnny Depp think we are? It is not an issue of criticism, although at moments it certainly crosses the line in becoming down right creepy particularly with young children in the audience who may or may not understand the parallel mannerisms between the two figures, as it is an annoyance for Depp not to fess up to his portrayal of Willy Wonka. Yet another dispute is that specific special effects shots, which would include among others the blown-up Violet Beauregarde and the diminutive Oompa Loompas, all of which are performed by British actor Deep Roy, come off as being too artificial which presents quite an unnecessary distraction for the audience. Other points of critique would include the haphazard background story of Willy Wonka which diminishes significantly the grandeur and illusion of the character when his outlandish behavior is blamed on `daddy not understanding him', awkward moments such as when the dolls singing the `Willy Wonka Theme Song' suddenly catch on fire or when Willy proclaims `Good morning sunshine, the Earth says hello' that do nothing for the plot and are not the least bit amusing, and finally the finale which wraps things up too neatly and feels a bit anti-climatic to say the least. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a welcome diversion from adult-oriented features flooding the market place, which would include Wedding Crashers and The Island, for the younger set but retains no distinctive value that would make it anything more then that.",3,The Moose Hole - Peter Pan and the Chocolate Factory,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,11081,"['were', 'take', 'glance', 'back',

I loved the oompa-loompa songs in the old movie, but as a whole it wasn't very re-watchable, and thus I didn't buy the video.This one was different: The oompa-loompa songs are kinda... way too pop for my taste (the originals were more whimsical), but as a whole the movie is much more worth owning in DVD, and the reason for that is the sub-plot that finally develops in the ending, which is conclusive and not ambiguous at all.

They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun. Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother.

It's equally stunning that a remake can eviscerate the brilliant script of the original, take away all humor, quirkiness and cleverness and repackage it with ridiculous changes. And then there's the awful performance of Johnny Depp who has no concept of this character. I believe the original choice for the remake was Nicholas Cage who would've gotten the nastiness of Willy Wonka. I loathed the children and acting all around. I loathed the lame songs. I loathed the money that was spent on this. Take a look at some of the making of extras of the original movie and you'll see it was a labor of love.

939087,AUSATFDSU2INS,B000BB1MHS,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[86, 109]","The new version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory represents exactly what the audience should expect from a Tim Burton film: exuberant sets that challenge all possible camera angles and show a kitsch quality; weird supporting characters that prove to be a critic and piercing look at the American suburban world, Danny Elfman's exquisite music and as a cherry top, the presence of Johnny Depp, in his fifth collaboration with Burton.The original 1971 film had a clear anchor in the pop visual look of the times; Burton's film evokes some 60's pictures in his art direction, photography and in the sweet innocence quality that all movies lack in the present. Without a doubt, the production design, art direction, costumes and sets are worthy of an Oscar; as well as Elfman's score, who added music to the verses written by Ronald Dahl, the author of the book.Likewise, we should speak of Johnny Depp's performance for his extraordinary creation of Wonka. Compared to Gene Wilder's character in the 71' film, Depp's Wonka is more repressed, more peculiar and far more apt to this version, because it looks real and nostalgia-free.The casting was terrific, from my point of view, and no one dissapointed in that department. A special mention to the man who played the Oompa Loompas...he was just superb and hilarious, in a freaky way, but terrific!!In conclusion, I think Burton's version is superior, its ending more wholesome and its sensibility definitely more contemporary. This movie has updated all the elements that became somewhat obsolete in the 1971 film.

I was pleasantly surprised to be at least mildly engaged in the story and generally entertained, though I have the same qualms about showing ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" to young children that I did about the 1971 film. The film's sometimes sadistic humor may be genuinely disturbing to children, and the eccentric Willy Wonka is just plain creepy. I actually thought it was a horror film when I was a child.Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is an ""ordinary little boy"" who lives with his impoverished but loving family. One day, the reclusive candy magnate Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) announces that he will allow 5 children to tour his huge and mysterious factory, one of whom will win a grand prize ""beyond your wildest imagination"". Five Golden Tickets have been placed randomly in Wonka chocolate bars, and children all over the world vie to find them. Poor little Charlie has a wealth of luck and comes up with one of the tickets himself. He chooses his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) to accompany him on the tour, and off they go with four other children and their parents to see how Willy Wonka makes all that delicious candy.Johnny Depp can make creepy, antisocial characters interesting, and he brings a sense of innocence to Willy Wonka that helps. But to tell the truth, Willy Wonka is an unsettling guy who doesn't even like children. Worse, the fates that await the youngsters could easily be the stuff of nightmares -so be careful if you know your child is sensitive. The child actors do a great job of expressing their characters' over-the-top personalities. If the writing has any fault, it is that Charlie is a good boy but a bland character, while his more mischievous companions have stronger personalities and do more to entertain. Annasophia Robb is especially fun to watch as ultra-competitive Violet Beauregarde. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is obviously intended for children, hence the lessons on the value of family and consequences of disobedience...and the silly song and dance numbers. But the film is peppered with jokes and allusions aimed at adults. It's admirable that ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" strives to entertain its entire audience, but I wonder if the adults won't be just mildly entertained while the kids are just creeped out.",4,Funny for Adults.

And this movie is full of oddballs, weirdos, nuts as well as several squirrels.As usual, Depp adds an unsettling twist to the character of Wonka that makes him interesting and just a tad obnoxious.  This version of the movie more accurately approaches the character in the book than the Wilder movie did ( but I like that one too.)  The cinematography is breathtaking in scope and detail with special effects that will please the most finicky of viewers.  The acting from the children is flawless, they almost steal the show away from Depp.  Almost.  And last, Elfman's score is one of his best to date; menacing, creepy but playful and intelligent.  Unlike the original movie, you can actually look forward to the next Oompa Loompa song in this rendition.  The only real drawback to me was a decision to overdue the digital makeup on Depp and some of the children in the cast.

Oh, and to clarify now, the film is not actually that dark.The plot itself feels a little awry.  For instance, Charlie is treated almost as a sub-character for much of the film, and we are pressed to pay more and more attention to the factory and Willy Wonka himself.  This is particularly true when Burton shows us the newer personal side of Wonka, filled with flashbacks and more.On top of that the whole feel of the musical has diminished, but admittedly they're just not as popular anymore so no surprise.  Oh yes, the Oompaloompas sing, and in quite a  variety of styles too, but don't expect Depp to crack out a note, or the kids.And speaking of Oompaloompas, in the previous versions where obviously a few characters played them, this version has one actor digitally cloned into all of the Oompaloompas.  Not only that, but he is not the most appealing Oompaloompa, as he actually fits the image of a man who I do not think should be around kids.  Oh yes, I definitely loved the musical numbers, and the shrewd comments based around them particularly by the kid characters, but still, scary man.So did I like it?  Yeah, I did, and although I prefer Gene Wilder's version this one gives us another side, perhaps unnecessary side, to this strange yet classic tale of a poor boy and his fortunate and strange trip to the Wonka Chocolate factory.",4,"Wily Willy, and different too.",1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,1487,"['Willy', 'back', 'course', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'better', 'worse', 'often', 'case', 'Oh', 'clarify', 'now', 'film', 'not', 'actually', 'dark.The', 'plot', 'little', 'awry', 'instance', 'Charlie', 'treated', 'almost', 'sub-character', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'pressed', 'pay', 'more', 'more', 'attention', 'factory', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'particularly', 'true', 'when', 'Burton', 'newer', 'personal', 'side', 'Wonka', 'filled', 'flashbacks', 'more.On', 'top', 'whole', 'feel', 'musical', 'diminished', 'admittedly', ""'re"", 'just', 'not', 'popular', 'anymore', 'surprise', 'Oh', 'yes', 'Oompaloompas', 'sing', 'quite', 'variety', 'styles', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Depp', 'crack', 'out', 'note', 'kids.And', 'speaking', 'Oompaloompas', 'previous', 'versions', 'where', 'obviously', 'few', 'characters', 'played', 'version', 'one', 'actor', 'digitally', 'cloned', 'Oompaloompas', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'most', 'appealing', 'Oompaloompa', 'actually', 'image', 'man', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'kids', 'Oh', 'yes', 'definitely', 'loved', 'musical', 'numbers', 'shrewd', 'comments', 'based', 'particularly', 'kid', 'characters', 'still', 'scary', 'man.So', 'did', 'Yeah', 'did', 'prefer', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'version', 'one', 'side', 'perhaps', 'unnecessary', 'side', 'strange', 'yet', 'classic', 'tale', 'poor', 'boy', 'fortunate', 'strange', 'trip', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'factory']",N/A

Worse, it isn't nearly as colorful or imaginative as it's supposed to be.  I'm not saying there isn't some cool stuff in it, but a lot of it is stuff I saw in the original film.  There's really not much new to it except for the special effects, which are admittedly very good.But it always comes back to the story, and I just didn't care about it.  It doesn't help that I already knew it, knew everything that was going to happen.  It's hard to be awed by things you expect.

Depp's portrayal is rather unnerving in its similarity to Michael Jackson. Wonka is getting old, needs an heir and wants Charlie to divorce his family and come live with  him in the factory without any other adult intervention. Kinda creeps me out. However, up to that point the movie is quite entertaning and a feast for the eyes (up to the ride in the candy Viking ship it's best), after that the sets get a little sterile.What surprised me was that Wonka does not like kids; he especially despises RUDE kids (and isn't society over run with these nowadays!!!) Each little rude punk gets punished, but the punishments are not at all imaginative, in fact each one gets more boring.

But poor Charlie only gets one bar a year, and that bar, sadly, does not contain one of the prized Golden Tickets.  But when Charlie finds a twenty dollar bill in the snow, he buys a Fudge Mallow Delight bar, and to his surprise, finds a Golden Ticket!And with that, Charlie soon finds himself standing by the front of the factory with five other lucky kids, but will they win the one big prize Willy Wonka has promised the best kid?Now, this movie is very funny, very visual and very VERY weird, but non the less, the 2 Disk Special Edition is truly and treat to have and deserves a spot on any movie collectors shelf.",5,A Goofy and Crazy Movie Exploding with Gagworks,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,1630,"['Now', ""'m"", 'probably', 'sounding', 'little', 'lame', 'title', 'review', 'really', 'other', 'way', 'put', 'movie', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Burton', 'work', 'even', 'bigger', 'fan', 'Burton/Depp', 'collaboration', 'believe', 'fourth', 'film', 'collaboration', 'Now', 'movie', 'imperssive', 'imaginative', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'fabulous', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'kid', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'Most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'agree', 'enjoyed', 'lot', 'more', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'for.Most', 'know', 'story', 'here', 'anyway', 'young', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'small', 'run-down', 'house', 'poor', 'family', 'legendary', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'One', 'day', 'grandpa', 'story', 'why', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'closed', 'down', 'factory', 'public', 'workers', 'machines', 'took', 'over', 'job', 'Shortly', 'hearing', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'will', 'be', 'giving', '5', 'kids', 'tour', 'factory', 'hidden', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'five', 'candy', 'bars', 'poor', 'Charlie', 'only', 'one', 'bar', 'year', 'bar', 'sadly', 'not', 'contain', 'one', 'prized', 'Golden', 'Tickets', 'when', 'Charlie', 'twenty', 'dollar', 'bill', 'snow', 'Fudge', 'Mallow', 'Delight', 'bar', 'surprise', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'Charlie', 'soon', 'standing', 'front', 'factory', 'five', 'other', 'lucky', 'kids', 'will', 'win', 'one', 'big', 'prize', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'promised', 'best', 'kid', 'Now', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'visual', 'very', 'VERY', 'weird', 'less', '2', 'Disk', 'Special', 'Edition', 'truly', 'treat', 'have', 'deserves', 'spot', 'movie', 'collectors', 'shelf']",N/A

Closer to the book than the original, there are still certain nuances, certain catch phrases that were not garnered from the book.

Tim Burton's vision is the closest thing Hollywood could possibly ever produce to Roald Dahl's fantastical world of a remarkably clever (albeit eccentricly crazy) very sweet man.Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka. He's actually beyond perfect. Depp is the character actor of all character actors and his portrayal of Wonka is so hilariously crazy that it is just perfect. The thing I find so remarkable about Depp's performance in this film is that it is his fourth starring role in a Tim Burton movie, and yet it is amazingly different from every other performance he has ever done. So many other actor/director combinations get stagnant and appear to repeatedly do the same thing over and over (Tom Hanks/Spielberg, Tom Cruise/Spielberg, Ben Affleck/Kevin Smith, etc...) but Depp and Burton bring a new character, a new scenery, and an entirely new production to everything they work on together. ""Charlie"" is no exception.And speaking of Charlie, his portrayal in this film by Freddie Highmore is awesome. I have to admit to being slightly disappointed by the casting of Highmore as Charlie because I was not overly impressed with his performance in ""Finding Neverland"" but he silenced my criticism by perfectly portraying Charlie Bucket. He was awesome. Depp was awesome. Burton's direction and crazy Burton-esque set design was priceless. This movie was tremenedously crazy fun and I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard at the movies.

""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is taking it's place as the movie Dahl invisioned.I don't need to give a summary of the story, as everyone knows what it is.  What I need to do, first, is dispell some isues.Where is the music?Why, it's there.  The Oompa Loompas sing, only they have much, much better songs.What about Charlie and his Grandfather drinking the bubble stuff?That actually did not happen in the book.What about the whole Everlasting Gobstopper thing, with Charlie giving his back?Again, not in the book.  The book was about the importance of family, not the importance of sharing.  And that is where the original movie went horribly wrong.  This newer version brings out the moral as Dahl wanted it.Depp, as usual, gives an incredible performance, and Burton shows off his as usual incredible directing skills.This Wonka was much more believable around the kids as he hadn't been around people for years.  His antics and his needing the cards made much more sense.  And the fact that he was weird only made it funnier.  His whole backstory was incredible, as well as sad.  The whole issue with his father and the scene where he and his father meet back up is very touching.  Depp did incredible with the character.  His adaption worked given how Wonka was supposed to be, and it made more sense.I though it was very touching that Wonka's father had been following his son's career, even though he claimed to not be there when Wonka came back.  It was very moving, to say the least.I liked this Charlie much better.  He was way more realistic, as was the Grandfather.  I loved the Grandfather.  He was incredible and funny.

(That is why I think Burton's addition of the backstory regarding Wonka and his candy-hating dentist father is very much in the spirit of the original.)  The Dickensian world of Charlie is lovingly recreated by Burton, replete with a leaning shack and twisted doors that suggest the German expressionist techniques evident in the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  The Oompah Loompahs are perfect, and Tim Burton admirably avoids the racism implicit in the original story by making the Oompah Loompahs (all but a few, as far as I can tell, played by the same suave actor) without resorting to the campiness of the prior movie version, by making them much more clever than the rest of the characters in the story.  Their musical numbers had me and my children laughing out loud, especially where in the song for Mike Teavee they become a perfect parody of 70's glam rock (nearly besting even Spinal Tap in this brief number).

939117,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B000BB1MHS,Nathan T.,"[3, 6]","I finally decided ""heck, I have some time why not?""So I sat down and watched this. My friend had a DVD. To be brief and straight to the point the movie was not amusing to watch whatsoever. The following were the issues:1. No charm, especially in terms of Johnny Depp's portrayal of the original movie's Willy Wonka. He was just weird and that's about it. He was not fascinating.2. No magic3. No suspense. This goes hand in hand with number 2. The whole movie opens up straight out and doesn't ever build much suspense and so the magical, mystical feeling the first movie had was not found in this remake. I mean many people have already watched the first one so they already knew what to expect, so a smarter way to approach this is to change the plot much more and combine it with a solid wall of above average acting and ideas. However, this movie didn't do any of it. I watched it feeling very bored.4. Pure Imagination. Man this song is the song that gave this movie a lot magic, at least it did for the original. The new movie didn't have one single catchy song. A good movie, especially one that has singing, has at least a catchy song or two.5. Oompa Loompas are changed in a weird manner. They are no longer fat and short, now they're like little elves, not to mention they all look the same - in other words FUGLY! I liked the old oompa loompas. However, it does seem to make more sense considering their candy commercials feature similar versions.I'm glad the movie is over and I agree with all the negative remarks. This movie does Johnny Depp no real favor because the acting in this movie does not exploit his full potential whatsoever. Johnny Depp is much more than what he portrays in this movie. The original actor for Willy Wonka was significantly more suited to the role.Horrible movie, will never watch again. If someone gave me this movie, I would either try to sell it off or throw it away.

There's no knowing where we're rowing. Or which way the river's flowing. Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is a hurricane a blowing?"" This is the chant that a deranged-looking Gene Wilder uttered as his magic gondola sailed down the chocolate river in 1971's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". It is a film that has delighted and spooked children for more than 30 years. And I had the pleasure of going to see this wonderful retelling of the now-named ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" not too long ago. The direction of Tim Burton (""Batman"", ""Sleepy Hollow"") was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Johnny Depp (""Secret Window"") as Willy Wonka was top-notch and hilarious! Supporting players include Freddie Highmore (""Finding Neverland"") as Charlie Bucket, David Kelly (""Waking Ned Devine""), Helena Bonham Carter (""Fight Club""), Noah Taylor (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""), and Christopher Lee (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy), in which they all gave unforgettable performances!For those who don't know the story, then hop into my gondola, everyone, and I'll tell you a little about a guy named Willy Wonka (Depp). He owns a big candy factory, and nobody's been in it for 15 years. And yet, it's been producing candy all this while. But how, if nobody comes in or out, does the candy get made? Little Charlie Bucket (Highmore) would like to know. He's a poor boy living on the outskirts of the Wonka factory in a strange, dilapidated house where his four ancient grandparents sleep in one large bed (two at the foot and two at the head). One day, after years of silence, Wonka announces to the world that he is putting five ""golden tickets"" into his delicious Wonka Bars, and the children who get them will be treated to a tour of the Wonka factory and vie for a chance to win a special prize at the end of the visit.Needless to say, Charlie gets one of the tickets, as do a quartet of prepubescent horrors: fat and gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled rich kid Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive gum-smacker Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb, ""Because of Winn-Dixie""), and the video-game-obsessed brat Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Wonka doesn't like these kids. He has unique ways of expressing disdain for each. And, in fact, each of the kids leaves the tour early, picked off by their own excesses. (Augustus falls into the chocolate river, Violet becomes a giant blueberry, etc.) We know throughout the movie that Charlie, along with his Grandpa Joe (Kelly), will make it all the way based on his kindness and manners. But what is the special prize?While Charlie is more fleshed out and real than the moppet of the first film, Wonka himself is a bizarre amalgam of Michael Jackson and Oscar Wilde -- only more androgynous than Michael and dandier than Oscar (imagine that!). Whereas Wilder's Willy Wonka was mischievously wise, Depp's is neurotic. He has family issues -- he can't bring himself to say ""parent"" -- from a troubled childhood with an overbearing dentist father (Lee). Wonka is not merely whimsical here. He is weird.Some may consider Depp's creation a miscalculation. But what kind of person could create a factory of such imagination and craziness and not be somehow crazy and imaginary in the process? The factory is a marvel -- very much like the one of the earlier film at first but more expansive and magical as it goes along. There are special effects now that were undreamt in 1971, and they are put to enchanting use. What exactly Roald Dahl's book and this film promotes in terms of childhood virtues is elusive. Is it moderate appreciation of candy? Respect for imagination? This is unclear. Crystal clear, however, is this: Quibble as you may, besides ""Batman Begins"", this is the most imaginative and delightful film so far this summer. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. (The Oompa Loompas, Wonka's trusty and diminutive servants, all played by Deep Roy, engage in dazzling production numbers, each themed around the exit of a bratty child. The horn section really soars.)And the chemistry between the strange Wonka and the responsible Charlie is touching and, at times, heartbreaking. This is Burton's most complete and rewarding film in years, especially since ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", and certainly in a year full of ""Fantastic Four""s and ""Bewitched""s, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" succeeds as the most reverential and enjoyable remake.

Um... hello... DEPP'S WONKA HATED KIDS!  I don't wanna spoil the movie and say why Wonka in this movie chose to allow the brats into his factory, but Depp makes it very clear that Wonka is not socially stable.  He cringes at any physical touch (the scene where Violet hugs him), he picks fights with the children out of the pure inability to understand them (the 'you're all very short' scene), he needs cue cards just to welcome them into his factory... And my final arguement for the day, Wonka has a nose!!!Anyway, that aside:  This movie was awesome.  I recommend it to anyone on the grounds that it is incomparable to the first; Burton did a great job of making sure that this was a retelling of a story and not a remake of a movie.  Of course the original is a classic, but do not let that stop you from seeing this version, because you may be pleasantly surprised.Yes, everything is different.  The oompa loompas are somewhat more... disturbing... mostly in the sense that they're all played by the same man!  The 'bad' kids are nastier than in the original, and the 'bad' parents are even more pathetically clueless or tapped into their childrens' faults.

I remember over a decade ago when I shared that thought with some movie friends and was literally laughed at, now it's an accepted fact. Woo hoo for me.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is just another shiny example of the risks Johnny is willing to take to bring us unique characters and one of the things about this film I like is his total committment to his performance.  Course there was something inconsistent about an arrested developed man seeming to not like children.  Given his history with his father, I could understand him not liking parents, but in the movie, he really seemed to get along with them better.  Still a good Michael Jackson impersonation.  And for that I say Bravo.  The other great things about this the movie are the wonderful sets for Willy Wonka's extraordianry chocolate factory.  They are literally eye candy for the movie audience.  But as a whole, I can't say that I was blown away by this movie.  In fact, there are portions of the movie where I was bored and was entertaining doing a few house chores instead--and I HATE chores.

It is Charlie's birthday that will be soon arriving, and for his present he will get one Wonka Bar. But this year it will be different. Willy Wonka just so happens to be re-opening his factory, and five golden tickets are randomly placed in the most current production line of Wonka Bars. The five lucky children who find these tickets will receive a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory for an entire day. And one extra-lucky child will receive a mystery prize at the end of the tour beyond their wildest imagination. Sure enough, Charlie ends up being one of those lucky children to enter the factory. So, along with four others, he meets Willy Wonka on that anticipated day and enters his palace-like factory, unaware of the absolutely amazing things he is about to see. And once those doors shut behind them, the magic begins. Room after room, we (the viewers) are treated to some truly colorful and imaginative sights. Along the way are the singing Oopma-Loompas, giant waterfalls of chocolate, edible grass and trees, kooky new inventions, and plenty more. Throughout the tour, however, each child's curiosity and spoiled nature brings about problems, and one by one they create their own catastrophes sure to end their visit! By the end of the film, of course, Charlie is the only one left and becomes the winner of the fantastic prize. But when the prize is revealed, the most important things in life are finally seen by Charlie as well as Willy Wonka, ultimately leading to a heart-warming ending that holds an important message for children and adults alike.Johnny Depp certainly makes a delightful Willy Wonka. Through the movie trailers, I thought Charlie And The Chocolate Factory would be a bit weirder and more twisted than it actually was. Regardless, you can be assured that Depp's portrayal of Wonka is no less than absolutely nutty!

I would like to get one like his. The songs however were better. My two favorites were Veruca Salt and Mike Teevee. Veruca Salt's song sounded like a song from 1969. And that Hard Rock band that was playing on Mike Teevee's song reminded me of that band KISS and it also sounded like that song by Queen ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" When I heard this movie came out, I felt as though this was sort of like a historic moment because this is like the sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) since the old movie was made 34 years ago as of last year and that's a pretty long time for a sequel to come out. I don't know why Tim Burton wanted to use just a 100 Deep Roys as Oompa Loompas. He could've used other actors who are Midgets like Warwick Davis or Verne Troyer. The plot is sort of the same where Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) and his family are poor and there are 5 Golden tickets in any 5 Wonka bars. Later on Charlie finds it and he tours the Chocolate factory with 4 other kids Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) who eats so many Candy Bars a day, Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) who gets everything she wants because her father Mr. Salt (James Fox) is rich, Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) who chews gum all day long and also won many trophies for activites, and a nerdish kind of guy Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) who likes watching TV and playing Video Games but hates Chocolate and Mr. Wonka. While in the factory, they don't listen to Mr. Wonka and do what they want to do and don't win the factory. However Charlie won the factory and also shows some new stuff not in the original movie like what the kids looked like after their incidents and Mr. Wonka lands his glass elevator into Charlie's poorhouse and tells his family he won the Chocolate factory but Mr. Wonka says he cannot bring his family with him so Charlie turns down the offer. Things turned out a little better for the Bucket family but not for Willy. Then later on Charlie is Polishing Shoes and Willy Wonka comes to get his shoes Polished and after Charlie talks about Willy, Willy reveals himself and says why he doesn't want Charlie's family to come to the factory because they tell you what to do and what not to do but Charlie tells him that they're just trying to protect you because they love you and later on Charlie takes Mr. Wonka to see his Dad, Dr. Wilbur Wonka who's a Dentist and actually before this part, it mentions about Willy's childhood. Wilbur didn't want Willy to eat one piece of chocolate or candy. But later on Willy likes it and starts eating just that and Wilbur doesn't like it so Willy runs away and that's how he ran the chocolate factory. Because of this, Willy didn't want to see his Dad but Wilbur recognizes Willy and realizes how much he loved Willy so Willy changes his mind and makes the offer to Charlie again about the factory and gives it to him under one condition, he brings his family along.

939134,AEVFN5Y6Q25CX,B000BB1MHS,"Paul M. Varga ""Tauren Guard""","[3, 4]","Tim Burton hires Johnny Depp (gee, there's a first) to portray the slightly off-center chocolatier Willie Wonka in the recent version of 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory'.The only fair way to make any comparisons between this one and the original starring Gene Wilder is by their storylines. The new version gives a lot more detail from the book than the original did. The more noticeable main differences between the two stories are: 1) Mike Teevee and Violet Beauregard are made to look more violent in the new version, 2) You get to see what happened to the children as they're escorted out of the factory, 3) the geese that lay the golden eggs are replaced by squirrels that toss out bad nuts, and 4) you get to see the childhood of Willie Wonka in the newer version.  I would go into other story differences but I don't want to give too much away.There wasn't a bad performance by any actor or actress in this movie, in my opinion. The one that deserves the most credit is Deep Roy who portrays every Oompa Loompa in the movie. Yes, I know, the computer special effects can easily make multiple copies of him; however, you can tell he went through a few dozen costume changes and alternate shots for the movie. AND, he does a better lip sync than Brittney Spears and Ashley Simpson combined.  I know.. that's not saying much.The most interesting thing about the movie I didn't find out until the closing credits. The lyrics of the Oompa Loompa songs come straight from Roald Dahl's book.One of the few downsides of the movie was the sound quality of the first couple of songs.

939136,A3GGD7ZWVWIKOU,B000BB1MHS,"Peter P. Fuchs ""&#34;The Meta-Reviewer&#34;""","[1, 5]","Let's face it: In life there is good-androgynous and bad androgynous. The funniest evocation of the difference is probably that classic skit from Saturday Night Live called ""It's Pat!"". Pat in this case was a character of the most creepy androgyny, in an almost genius direction, and very funny. It highlighted what most feel, and certainly also gay people, that there  are differences in styles of androgyny. I am someone who likes masculinity as a cultural trope and biological ethos, and I see the virtue in it, which is not always recognized in our somewhat feminized culture. But at the same time, I am not bothered nor do I dislike fem guys, and just consider it a variation, and often a witty and charming  and beautiful one. But the  character made of the central Willy Wonka figure in this remake of the original Willy Wonka is just bad-androgynous in every way,  and very creepy to boot. Unlike the original with Gene Wilder character,  who was quite  delightfully oddball in his masculine way.  In fact one of the reasons I think the movie was such a failure is that it was  simply quite impossible to imagine reasonable parents  leaving children with this character. There were some good points in the movie, but since this central weirdness was a bit anxiety- causing, it failed as entertainment. Ironically, one of Johnny Depp's other movies actually proves the point exactly. When he played that pirate in many movies, it would be hard to conjure a simultaneously  more masculine yet swishy character. He swished through every scene, and was very fem in many ways. And yet, whatever that button is, he did not push it for creepiness. By contrast Wonka in this one surely does.This makes me think also how jejune and unprofitable it is  to read too much into these movies. It is just entertainment, and the reason one theme or style is chosen is often very ad hoc, if the actual history of movie making is any guide. Of course they make mistakes sometimes in choosing. By contrast, I remember being in 7th grade in Catholic school, when our homework assignment for Social Studies was to write a kind of analysis of a movie we liked. One of the kids gave a presentation about the original Willy Wonka, and gave it a very Catholic interpretation. He said Willy Wonka was like a Christ-figure and the Oompa-Loopmas were like the Apostles. He even said that when they break open that giant  colorful toadstool and it flows out with liquid chocolate, that such was like almost a Eucharistic sacrament!! Well, obviously the nun who taught the class was pretty annoyed by this analysis. The silliness of it reminds me how taking mere entertainment with all its ad hoc effluvia and factoids as descriptors of some larger meaning precludes our ability to plumb real lines of meaning, and find the actual compass by which to hermeneutically analyze the essential entertainment ethos. That goes for an academic school environment or elsewhere.",1,"Willy Wonka, Androgynous In a Bad Way",1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,2946,"['Let', 'face', 'life', 'good-androgynous', 'bad', 'androgynous', 'funniest', 'evocation', 'difference', 'probably', 'classic', 'skit', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'called', 'Pat', 'Pat', 'case', 'was', 'character', 'most', 'creepy', 'androgyny', 'almost', 'genius', 'direction', 'very', 'funny', 'highlighted', 'what', 'most', 'feel', 'certainly', 'also', 'gay', 'people', 'are', 'differences', 'styles', 'androgyny', 'am', 'someone', 'who', 'masculinity', 'cultural', 'trope', 'biological', 'ethos', 'see', 'virtue', 'not', 'always', 'recognized', 'somewhat', 'feminized', 'culture', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'do', 'dislike', 'fem', 'guys', 'just', 'consider', 'variation', 'often', 'witty', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'one', 'character', 'made', 'central', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'figure', 'remake', 'original', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'just', 'bad-androgynous', 'way', 'very', 'creepy', 'boot', 'original', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'delightfully', 'oddball', 'masculine', 'way', 'fact', 'one', 'reasons', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'such', 'failure', 'was', 'simply', 'quite', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'reasonable', 'parents', 'leaving', 'children', 'character', 'were', 'good', 'points', 'movie', 'central', 'weirdness', 'was', 'bit', 'anxiety-', 'causing', 'failed', 'entertainment', 'Ironically', 'one', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'other', 'movies', 'actually', 'point', 'exactly', 'When', 'played', 'pirate', 'many', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'conjure', 'simultaneously', 'more', 'masculine', 'yet', 'swishy', 'character', 'swished', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'fem', 'many', 'ways', 'yet', 'button', 'did', 'not', 'push', 'creepiness', 'contrast', 'Wonka', 'one', 'surely', 'does.This', 'think', 'also', 'how', 'jejune', 'unprofitable', 'read', 'too', 'much', 'movies', 'just', 'entertainment', 'reason', 'one', 'theme', 'style', 'chosen', 'often', 'very', 'ad', 'hoc', 'actual', 'history', 'movie', 'making', 'guide', 'course', 'make', 'mistakes', 'sometimes', 'choosing', 'contrast', 'remember', 'being', '7th', 'grade', 'Catholic', 'school', 'when', 'homework', 'assignment', 'Social', 'Studies', 'was', 'write', 'kind', 'analysis', 'movie', 'liked', 'One', 'kids', 'gave', 'presentation', 'original', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'gave', 'very', 'Catholic', 'interpretation', 'said', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'was', 'Christ-figure', 'Oompa-Loopmas', 'were', 'Apostles', 'even', 'said', 'when', 'break', 'open', 'giant', 'colorful', 'toadstool', 'out', 'liquid', 'chocolate', 'such', 'was', 'almost', 'Eucharistic', 'sacrament', 'Well', 'obviously', 'nun', 'who', 'taught', 'class', 'was', 'pretty', 'annoyed', 'analysis', 'silliness', 'how', 'taking', 'mere', 'entertainment', 'ad', 'hoc', 'effluvia', 'factoids', 'descriptors', 'larger', 'meaning', 'ability', 'plumb', 'real', 'lines', 'meaning', 'find', 'actual', 'compass', 'hermeneutically', 'analyze', 'essential', 'entertainment', 'ethos', 'academic', 'school', 'environment', 'elsewhere']",N/A

This meaning, of course, that I don't understand why the critics didn't seem to come up with worthy enough words to praise this new masterpiece signed a certain Tim Burton. At least the critics over here in Europe did, and after finally watching it (with a mixed expectation being that very often critics have no idea what they are talking about -funny how they mostly agree amongst themselves, isn't it? If a movie is weird enough it's a bit scary being the one who doesn't ""get it"", am I right?).And yes, this movie is weird enough -but it doesn't seem forced, and is not the problem at all. And I don't give a damn about the similarities between Willie Wonka and Michael Jackson! Ironically at first viewing it was like being served a big and tempting bowl of candy -but it didn't taste anything. The gigantic chocolate-factory stands there in all its' mystery containing all its' secrets, but when we're finally inside every room looks the same. It's been a while since I read the book (but I did recognize myself there from time to time), so my dissapointment has got nothing to do wether it is true to the original story or not -but I simply didn't find it amusing, and after finnishing the bowl I still want candy. Ok, enough with the candy -but how this movie has scored full pot with the critics is beyond me. It's ok at its' best, and I can swallow a child loving it of course -it's colorful, and at times like watching a childrens' show. But at the same time it's a comedy for adults as well, and somehow falls between two chairs.I must admit that my two stars on the other hand goes to Johnny Depp. He certainly ""becomes"" Willie Wonka, or the oposite that is. He was a pleasure to watch -and overall the movie is saved by good acting from the entire cast. It's the story itself I found flat as its' original script -and far, far overrated.

Giving lip service to making a totally faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's fantastic book, Mr. Burton instead took to immediately turning Willy Wonka into an emotional cripple because his daddy was too strict and wouldn't nurture his creative candy ideas. {replace the word `candy' with `movie' and viola' Willy Wonka becomes Tim Burton! How'd that happen?!}It isn't just Wonka whose psyche' has been converted to a dark abyss, no that would be to easy. All the parents who accompany their kids on the tour are totally worthless; they stand around and watch their children getting maimed and hardly raise a fuss or ask a question. They were pretty useless in the book too but at least they made some noise about their kids getting axed. Grandpa Joe is okay because he isn't technically Charlie's `parent' so it's alright for him to be nice in Mr. Burton's world.The ending from the book has also been cast aside so Mr. Burton can spend an extra half hour beating the dead horse of mean, uncaring parents and their emotionally stunted children. And what is the payoff for this extra time stolen from your life? We find out that Old Man Wonka has been secretly proud of his son's accomplishments all these years but he was too proud to say ""I love you."" Dare to dream, Tim.Now let's talk about casting; Johnny Depp has no business in this film whatsoever, even on his best day he would be totally wrong for this part, and this is NOT his best day. His uneven and bizarre performance has an extremely creepy child molester quality that is very hard to watch and is about a million miles away from the character that Roald Dahl created. In fact the entire film is poorly cast with two exceptions; Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Julia Winter as Veruca Salt. Both did very well with what they had to work with.Danny Elfman's score, which is usually the one bright spot in a Tim Burton film, doesn't work at all here. It almost sounds as if Mr. Elfman has run out of ideas for making Burtons films palatable and just phoned it in to get it over with. The Oompa Loompa songs, however, are very catchy and pretty well done. The one complaint about them is that the words are important but they are frequently intelligible because of the music. In the book those lyrics, and Wonka's reaction to them, help set the tone of the story and establish that all is not what it seems.I have avoided mentioning the 1971 version until now because I wanted the majority of this review to deal with Burton's remake and little else, but it is impossible to ignore the other film because Burton made such a point of publicly distancing his version from it. And therein lies the biggest obstacle to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; the original adaptation of Roald Dahl's book nailed the magical yet dangerous feel of the factory so well and, Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka was so spot on with the book that when Burton distanced his film from them he, in effect, prohibited his own movie from capturing the nature of the book or it's lead characters.Avoid this film if you can.

939146,AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,B000BB1MHS,"PolarisDiB ""dibness""","[3, 6]","Danny Elfman's score begins. I hate Danny Elfman, but of course he would be used, he's in every one of Burton's endeavors. A CGI factory makes CGI chocolate in what seems like a mockery of the same imagery used to make cookies in the beginning of Edward Scissorhands... the narrator starts; in Burton's typical fairy-tale style comes images of fairy-tale times with fairy-tale dilapidated old houses, and I'm really beginning to not like it until......it all sucks you in. You watch Charlie's family as they anticipate the finders of the Golden Tickets, and their quite acute comments on the nature of the winners. You watch as Charlie simultaneously tries to hide his hope and maintain it at the same time, along with his family's fluctuating eagerness to get a Golden Ticket. And as Charlie finds a ten dollar bill on the ground, you suddenly realize, ""Geez, this movie's a lot like the book... well, of course it was one dollar and not ten dollars, but who's really counting?"" And a lot like the book it stays, with a few minor deviations which frankly are brilliant. Wonka's flashbacks into his childhood are perfect addendums to Depp's quirky new creation of the beloved character that most could not separate from Wilder, and in the end Wilder's character is still maintained because he is not blaspheme'd. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make a new Willy Wonka that is standalone enough that all thought of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory becomes mere nitpicking by people annoyed by change.In fact, considering the book, Willy Wonka movie, and Charlie movie, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly brilliant. It holds true to the book while still maintaining cinematic appeal by becoming it's own thing. It is not a remake of Willy Wonka, and thank God (or just Burton, as it was his choice anyways, right?) for that, because even though I like the older version, remakes are just incredibly tedious.Special appeal to Burton fans would be the almost demented acting of Johnny Depp... the strange grins when kids get in trouble, the timid voice when he becomes unsure of himself, the reclusive germophobe he makes of a once maudlin and glurgy character. In fact, all the characters are perfectly translated to the screen, even if they do look like porcelain dolls from time to time (I hypothesize this comes from the drawings found in many of Rhoad Dahl's books).Another great aspect of this movie is it's adherence to the musical bits in the book without really being a musical itself. Other than one other song, the Oompa Loompas sing everything, and though their music isn't really that good (I'd like to have it on a CD for laughs, but I don't really care for it otherwise), at least the situations are pretty funny, especially since all of the Oompa Loompas have the same face... and aren't like Munchkins.Another good thing to focus on is the insane amount of allusions.  Did I say ""mockery of Edward Scissorhands""?  It's no mockery, the beginning channels that work for a reason.  Kubrick, Hitchcock, and Burton's own films are easy catches, but can you catch all of the homages in this film?As the movie progresses, it deviates more and more from the book, which is fine because it feels at that point like the trust has been salvaged. If people are still worrying about details so far into this movie, then I don't really see how they enjoy very many movies at all. About the time we reach the television room scene, it begins to feel a little tedious but right then wraps up everything pretty nicely (not to say there isn't more good stuff to come, but I'm not going to give away ALL the details). Eventually the credits roll and I'm suddenly realizing, ""Wow, that was two hours... felt like two minutes.""

939147,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B000BB1MHS,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[4, 6]","Note: While I indeed like the percentage rating, I am refusing to rewrite this review, because I am way too happy with it to just delete it.  Still, I'm giving it a percentage.First off, I love Tim Burton.  Quentin Tarantino is cemented as my favorite director, but if I had to choose other favorites, Tim Burton is easily one of my other favorite directors.  Granted, he's not a genius as much as some of his saviors would like you to believe (you know the kind), and I don't rate all of his movies five stars or even four stars (Pee-Wee's Playhouse and The Nightmare Before Christmas are prime examples).  However, I think he's more than just some goth symbol.  He makes great movies that really have great visual styles, and for the most part, he's an inspired director and someone I can always count on for making something good.Except when he tries to redo other movies.  Granted, he's only had only one other re-make, but Planet of The Apes stunk up something fierce, and this one isn't much better.  I actually don't like the Willy Wonka movie that much either (I actually like the book more), but it's not a bad movie for good reasons, and there are parts in the movie that  seem very heartwarming (god I hate that word).  If felt engaging many times, and while it's also kind of dated, it still retains some form of engagment and emotion.  This movie, on the other hand, left me feeling cold throughout, with nothing to grab onto, with no character development.  Visual style can only take you so far, and while I liked some of it, it didn't do enough to save the film from becoming a total mess.This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch, but there's just not anything to grab onto.  Tim Burton is usually known for his quirkness and strangeness (boy, how dumb does that sound), but I always thought  he did so in a way that was always engaging, really making the world, characters, or situations come to life in some way.  In this one, the weirdness is there because he wants to be weird.  It does nothing to bring the world to life, just makes the world seem like a place that reminds you of a retirement home.  I actually have felt more emotions at a retirement home than this movie, I'm not even joking.  Plus, unlike the book which still had the heart but some of the deranged fun, this one doesn't have much with the sterile characters, and the two main people: Charlie and Wonka, being incredibly annoying on both counts.Ah, the annoying characters.  An example of this one would be the main character himself, Willy Wonka (?).  This Willy Wonka is just plain annoying and totally unengaging.  He has no real motivation in his actions, makes the stupidest and lame jokes, and just seems like the kind of person that tries to be all weird but in any case comes off looking like a person starved for attention.  The lame subplot about his father was also worthless, a backstory that made me feel absolutely nothing and did nothing to make me like this character at all.  Besides, when you don't give two _________ about the character now, why did you think I would care now?  He's annoying, he's weird because he can't offer anything else, and comparing the two characters makes you realize how much more soulless this Wonka is (The Nostalgia Critic did some cool comparisons, although I have no idea where the heck James Bond villian came from).I also liked the way the Nostalgia Critic pointed out how the Charlie character in this one is underdeveloped and annoyingly perfect.  This is a boyscout indeed, a kid that is so perfect and unrealistic that you just want to deck whoever put together this moron kid together.  As he said, the Charlie in the Wonka version (his name is in the title of the BOOK FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!) is kind, but is more like a kid.  He can get greedy, he is tempted at times, but really comes out at the end after conflict (at the end).  He's more like a real kid.  He's crucial to the story, which makes it all the better since he's engaging while the focus of this movie does not involve a character that's in any way interseting.  See above for that reason.However, there are some improvements, although most are on the visual front.  The whole chocolate River is much improved, the original version did very much look like liquid _________.  The river in here was extremely gloppy and looked very much like chocolate.  I also thought the gobstopper was improved, I mean, what were the original gobstoppers supposed to me modeled after.  The factory is kind of interesting to see at times, but not entirely all the time.  It's kind of a person thing, but I think it overall looks pretty cool for the most part, and Tim Burton knows his stuff (too bad it didn't save the movie).There are some plot points cleared up, and the character updates shows they weren't entirely lazy (Gloop is pretty much the same).  The updates of Mike, and ESPECIALLY Violet, are very welcome.  I also like seeing the kids come out after their survival through the factory.  However, Veruca Salt was not improved at all, as the one in the earlier version was so __________ spoiled and bratty that you wanted to beat for being such a bratty son of a __________.  And the opening parts weren't that bad either, although nothing special considering the characters weren't that interesting, so setting up uninteresting characters doesn't really make the movie better.  It would only count if the characters were actually interesting.  And when they do, there's not much screen time anyway.Oh, and one other thing.  The MUSICALS NUMBERS $U(% @$$!!!!!!!  The whole different songs played during each kid's demise are totally annoying.  Why Elfman why?  Oh.  _______ the Willy Wonka song.  Eh, at least it's better than A Whole New World.Sorry Burton, I love ya, but I'm not a patsy.  It's worth a shot if your a Burton fan, but if you are going into the movie expecting to see something akin to the original, you're in for a rude awakening.  I'm actually glad I saw this movie for some Tim Burton greatness scattered about, but there wasn't that much.  It's kind of too bad.  Oh well.  I'm glad Ed Wood was released on DVD in special edition.Directing: 7/10Characters: 3/10Improvements in visual style 4/5musical numbers 0/5plot: 1/10",2,Let's Just Hope He Does A better Job With Alice

The trailers looked intriguing, and since I loved watching Tim Burton's movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Big Fish"", I thought I would go see `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and I wasn't disappointed one bit!The story is about young Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Freddie Highmore), a poor boy with a good heart, who one day wins one of the five golden tickets to see Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory (the biggest factory which closed down a few years ago, and where no one is allowed to go in). Now starts the surreal adventures that take place once Willy Wonka shows the winners around his factory.I am usually speechless after watching most of Tim Burton's films (because they are all so good), and this movie had the same effect on me. I knew Freddie Highmore was talented when I first saw him in `Finding Neverland' and he once again acted his role flawlessly as Charlie. I feel Johnny Depp performed his best in this movie, because apart from the makeup, he played the silly, eccentric Willy Wonka so well that you feel like you are seeing him in a new light. It's not a surprise that Tim Burton would do an amazing job in directing this movie.This is a fun movie that anyone would enjoy watching. It is funny, silly, and emotional at the same time.

Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[6, 16]","As I was watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, it occurred to me that this review would basically conclude that this version of the movie adds absolutely nothing to the old version, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder and Jack Albertson.If you're not familiar with the plot, Willy Wonka runs a Chocolate Factory, but no one has been allowed inside with him for years.  He distributes 5 golden tickets randomly in shipments of chocolate bars.  The children who find the tickets will win a tour of the factory.  Young charlie is one of the lucky kids, from a very poor home, who finds a golden ticket.  The tour commences and the kids - each with one adult family member - see strange and wondrous things inside the candy factory.Johnny Depp is probably the best actor available for the role, almost ideal, some would say - but not better, for this particular role of Willy Wonka, than Wilder.  Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers of movie scores, especially Tim Burton movies, but in this case his music is actually worse than in the old film.  And the dancing rock numbers of the Oompa Loompa's is horrendous.  The old film was in color, had decent art direction and special effects, fine acting, and both films follow essentially the same plot, with minor variations, not much funnier in the new film.  Plus they left out the ""Candy Man"" song, one of my favorite parts of the old version. And so I would have given the film only 3 stars, for it's almost as good as the original, though unnecessary since it's not better, and then one less star because I missed ""The Candy Man.""But then the end came, and then they DID add more in this version, and it's good - morally and emotionally satisfying - and it involves Christopher Lee.  So I'm giving it 4 stars and recommend it for the whole family and everybody.

One cannot deny the dark imagery and the visual effects that make the film a Burton production -- the irony and the dysfunctions of his characters that are played out with each child and their relationship with their parents.  This is the core issue in the film as well as for Wonka's personality; Wonka cannot even say the word p-a-r-e-nt.  The landscape of the film almost depicts a time that has long passed -- the Cold War imagery of espionage, stealing the Wonka candy formula.  The film has traits from past Burton films, such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BIG FISH as well as from other twisted fictitious narratives, LEMONY SNICKET, and forgive me, THE CAT IN THE HAT.  Johnny Depp presents a unique Willy Wonka with his somewhat androgynous appearance that has been suggestive as a cross between the ""King of Pop"" and Carol Channing. Burton follows the same plotline as the original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY film, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and stays true to Roahl Dhal's novel as well as a few extras that explain Wonka's childhood.CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY by all means does not follow the musical giddiness of the original movie with memorable numbers, such as ""The Candyman,"" ""Pure Imagination,"" and ""I've Got a Golden Ticket.""  However, the Oompa loompa numbers somewhat fill the void, and proceeds the same as the WILLY WONKA film where each child is eliminated from the factory tour.  The most delicious scene throughout the film is the Wonka chocolate bar, and the river full of hot chocolate amidst the edible green hilly pastures with its cherry candy trees and puffy whipped cream -- how yummy.Overall, the film will indeed entertain and enchant each viewer.  It is appropriate for children eight years-old and older.  However, children under eight years-old should be accompanied with an adult because of particular situations and references that are mentioned in the film that they may not understand.",4,Oh the Chocolate ...,1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,2029,"['Time', 'Burton', 'again', 'trademark', 'gothic', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'backdrops', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'dark', 'imagery', 'visual', 'effects', 'make', 'film', 'Burton', 'production', 'irony', 'dysfunctions', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'child', 'relationship', 'parents', 'core', 'issue', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Wonka', 'personality', 'Wonka', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'say', 'word', 'p-a-r-e-nt', 'landscape', 'film', 'almost', 'time', 'long', 'passed', 'Cold', 'War', 'imagery', 'espionage', 'stealing', 'Wonka', 'candy', 'formula', 'film', 'traits', 'past', 'Burton', 'films', 'such', 'EDWARD', 'SCISSORHANDS', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'twisted', 'fictitious', 'narratives', 'LEMONY', 'SNICKET', 'forgive', 'CAT', 'IN', 'THE', 'HAT', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'unique', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'somewhat', 'androgynous', 'appearance', 'been', 'suggestive', 'cross', 'King', 'Pop', 'Carol', 'Channing', 'Burton', 'same', 'plotline', 'original', 'CHARLIE', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'film', 'WILLY', 'WONKA', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'true', 'Roahl', 'Dhal', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'extras', 'explain', 'Wonka', 'childhood.CHARLIE', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'means', 'not', 'follow', 'musical', 'giddiness', 'original', 'movie', 'memorable', 'numbers', 'such', 'Candyman', 'Pure', 'Imagination', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'However', 'Oompa', 'loompa', 'numbers', 'fill', 'void', 'same', 'WILLY', 'WONKA', 'film', 'where', 'child', 'eliminated', 'factory', 'tour', 'most', 'delicious', 'scene', 'film', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'river', 'full', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'edible', 'green', 'hilly', 'cherry', 'candy', 'trees', 'puffy', 'whipped', 'cream', 'how', 'yummy.Overall', 'film', 'will', 'indeed', 'entertain', 'enchant', 'viewer', 'appropriate', 'children', 'eight', 'years-old', 'older', 'However', 'children', 'eight', 'years-old', 'should', 'be', 'accompanied', 'adult', 'particular', 'situations', 'references', 'are', 'mentioned', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'understand']",N/A

939156,A387BZH5I9M6JW,B000BB1MHS,RES,"[6, 9]","Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a more faithful, darker rendering of Roald Dahl's 1964 book than the 1971 film. In that, although Gene Wilder was his usual delightful self, the direction, writing, and all other performances were mediocre and date badly. The changes from the book gave it a bland tone and a cheap look. Burton's film is a completely different vision, more like Dahl in its sophisticated whimsy and nightmarish quality, accomplished in Burton's inimitable style. Depp is a dismissive, sardonic Wonka; Wilder was just loopy. Any notion that Depp's subtle, eccentric performance has anything to do with Michael Jackson is way off-base: Depp's Wonka actually despises children, revealing that he was trying to find a child who was ""the least repulsive,"" a far-cry from an adult who wants to recapture his own childhood. The Burton film is not unlike Nicholas Roeg's faithful adaptation of Dahl's THE WITCHES--really close to Dahl's curmudgeonly view of children and the world; but CHARLIE goes farther with an ingenious, stunning visual style. The performances and look are genuinely funny, surreal, or moving. Depp acts rings around Wilder (these days, around anyone: it seems his range and flexibility are limitless). There is an added subplot dealing with Wonka's background, presumably written so that Christopher Lee could be included, about which some have complained. I think it works beautifully, and Lee is always a joy to watch. Recall that Dahl *disowned* the 1971 film and even refused to permit the use of his original title. He had been asked to write a screenplay, which was then radically altered into the bland mash that became WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. The Burton film has no such problems. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend it for all American children, given its morbidity and nihilistic tone. Unlike Americans, the English have never been afraid to show their kids the world without candy-coating it--another reason that the Burton film is far more authentic than its pallid 1971 screen predecessor. I think Dahl would have approved of this one. The DVD presents a crisp, colorful transfer in widescreen (avoid the zoomed/cropped full-screen version).",5,"Brilliant, more faithful",1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,2218,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'CHARLIE', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'more', 'faithful', 'darker', 'rendering', 'Roald', 'Dahl', '1964', 'book', '1971', 'film', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'was', 'usual', 'delightful', 'self', 'direction', 'writing', 'other', 'performances', 'were', 'mediocre', 'date', 'badly', 'changes', 'book', 'gave', 'bland', 'tone', 'cheap', 'look', 'Burton', 'film', 'completely', 'different', 'vision', 'more', 'Dahl', 'sophisticated', 'whimsy', 'nightmarish', 'quality', 'accomplished', 'Burton', 'inimitable', 'style', 'Depp', 'dismissive', 'sardonic', 'Wonka', 'Wilder', 'was', 'just', 'loopy', 'notion', 'Depp', 'subtle', 'eccentric', 'performance', 'anything', 'do', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'way', 'off-base', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'actually', 'children', 'revealing', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'child', 'who', 'was', 'least', 'repulsive', 'far-cry', 'adult', 'who', 'recapture', 'own', 'childhood', 'Burton', 'film', 'not', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'Dahl', 'THE', 'WITCHES', 'really', 'close', 'Dahl', 'curmudgeonly', 'view', 'children', 'world', 'CHARLIE', 'farther', 'ingenious', 'stunning', 'visual', 'style', 'performances', 'look', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'surreal', 'moving', 'Depp', 'rings', 'Wilder', 'days', 'anyone', 'range', 'flexibility', 'are', 'limitless', 'added', 'subplot', 'dealing', 'Wonka', 'background', 'presumably', 'written', 'so', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'could', 'be', 'included', 'have', 'complained', 'think', 'beautifully', 'Lee', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Recall', 'Dahl', '*disowned*', '1971', 'film', 'even', 'refused', 'permit', 'use', 'original', 'title', 'had', 'been', 'asked', 'write', 'screenplay', 'was', 'then', 'radically', 'altered', 'bland', 'mash', 'became', 'WILLIE', 'WONKA', 'THE', 'CHOCOLATE', 'FACTORY', 'Burton', 'film', 'such', 'problems', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'American', 'children', 'given', 'morbidity', 'nihilistic', 'tone', 'Americans', 'English', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'afraid', 'show', 'kids', 'world', 'candy-coating', 'reason', 'Burton', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'authentic', 'pallid', '1971', 'screen', 'predecessor', 'think', 'Dahl', 'would', 'have', 'approved', 'one', 'DVD', 'crisp', 'colorful', 'transfer', 'widescreen', 'zoomed/cropped', 'full-screen', 'version']",N/A

This sub-plot (which has *nothing* to do with the original book) featured some of the worst acting I've *ever* seen from Depp -- which shocked me, as I consider Depp the best actor of his generation. Still, everyone has to have a miss or two. Depp went for creepy, and got it, but far too many of his scenes (including all of these ""dentist flashbacks"") feel like he's forcing it. I was watching a man act, not watching a character.As for the rest of the movie... it was pleasantly dark, but lacked the sense of wonder that the first movie brought to life so well. Gene Wilder may have been too nice and accessible as Wonka for some, but his factory felt like an otherworldly place of mystery and surrealism.

""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" a film written by John August and Burton himself, is the 2005 adaptation of the legendary Roald Dahl's tale.Faithful to the traditional ""bizarro"" aura that has become his film trademark, Burton manages to deliver a moving and beautiful story with a strong ethic & value-oriented message that will be the joy of kids (all ages) and adults (all ages too). A feast for the eyes, and the soul. Exhausted and somewhat bored of his own success, Willie Wonka, the obscure owner of a world-class chocolate factory decides that the time has come for him to find an heir to his creamy empire. In doing so, he decides to temporarily leave his usual secludeness and issue a worldwide contest by way of which five lucky golden tickets, hidden in an equal number of chocolate bars, will in turn allow five lucky kids to tour his mistery factory, and get the chance of winning an all-star prize ""beyond their imagination"". After a series of unthinkable and (at times) very dark situations inside the factory, four pitiful kids fail the test. Each of them consumed by gluttony, greed, arrogance and despise. Only one child, the pristine and humble Charlie Bucket, manages to complete the journey, earning the coveted prize, and ultimately giving Willy Wonka the lesson of his life.I have to say that I loved this film so much that I even forgave Tim Burton for making his Willy Wonka a Wacko-Jacko look-alike....but hey Tim, don't push it!",5,Tim Burton does it again!,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1555,"['ultimate', 'storyteller', 'current', 'postmodern', 'society', 'again', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'again', 'Charlie', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'film', 'written', 'John', 'August', 'Burton', '2005', 'adaptation', 'legendary', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'tale.Faithful', 'traditional', 'bizarro', 'aura', 'become', 'film', 'trademark', 'Burton', 'deliver', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'story', 'strong', 'ethic', 'value-oriented', 'message', 'will', 'be', 'joy', 'kids', 'ages', 'adults', 'ages', 'too', 'feast', 'eyes', 'soul', 'Exhausted', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'own', 'success', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'obscure', 'owner', 'world-class', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'time', 'come', 'find', 'heir', 'creamy', 'empire', 'doing', 'so', 'temporarily', 'leave', 'usual', 'secludeness', 'issue', 'worldwide', 'contest', 'way', 'five', 'lucky', 'golden', 'tickets', 'hidden', 'equal', 'number', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'will', 'turn', 'allow', 'five', 'lucky', 'kids', 'tour', 'mistery', 'factory', 'get', 'chance', 'winning', 'all-star', 'prize', 'imagination', 'series', 'unthinkable', 'times', 'very', 'dark', 'situations', 'factory', 'four', 'pitiful', 'kids', 'fail', 'test', 'consumed', 'gluttony', 'greed', 'arrogance', 'despise', 'Only', 'one', 'child', 'pristine', 'humble', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'complete', 'journey', 'earning', 'coveted', 'prize', 'ultimately', 'giving', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'lesson', 'life.I', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'forgave', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'making', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Wacko-Jacko', 'look-alike', '.but', 'hey', 'Tim', 'do', ""n't"", 'push']",N/A

Roald Dahl didn't like the first version (with Gene Wilder), and it was risky to attempt a new version, but Burton is intelligent enough to do it right. One thing I didn't get was, if the old grandfather worked for Willy Wonka, why didn't Willy age accordingly. As Dahl intended, it's a lesson that rotten little spoiled kids will not always get everything they want. Previous reviewers made references to Michael Jackson, and other nonsense. What I experienced was a fine version of Dahl's difficult story, well presented and very entertaining. What I got out of it, as the book intended, is that greedy kids won't always get what they want; that a poor kid with dreams and hope may get more. The combination of Burton and Depp has never failed to entertain me (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood). Both are among the most talented artists in the film medium, and I enjoy that. ""Charlie"" is another feather in Burton's cap, and Depp, with his intelligent side-glances, removes any doubt that he's the finest actor today, risky and complete.

Seemed like Wonka could invent candy other folks just dreamed of making---like ice cream that never melted even on the hottest day.  So amazing, in fact, that a good many of the employees performed industrial espionage.  Soon, Wonka's competitors were offering no-melt ice cream and gum that didn't lose its flavor.Willy could have no idea that at least one or two of his competitors could steal in no time flat.Sadly, Willy Wonka closed the door on the factory and let all his employees go.  No one's been in there since, but the choclate keeps pouring out.In an unprecedented move, Willy offers five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars.  The children who win these five tickets get to visit the chocolate factory for a day--and one will come away with an unheard of prize:  which Willy will not list!Charlie badly wants to win the prize, both for himself and his grandfather.  But, how does poor Charlie stand a chance if he only gets one bar of chocolate per year---on his birthday.Meanwhile, kids are finding the Golden Tickets.  First, there's a fat German kid who eats chocolate all the time.  Then, there's a spoilt British girl whose industrialist father buys her hundreds of thousands of chocolate bars just so she can get the one.  Then, a kid hacker from Colorado who pegs the system and knows just which bar to buy.  Finally, the world's champion gum chewer and her stage mom win.They're down to one.  Charlie finds a dollar in the snow and gets the last ticket.The next day is the tour of the chocolate factory.  Wonka, the five kids and their respective parents go on an amazing tour where they discover that a tiny race of people--the oompah loompahs--are who now work at the factory creating choclates.  Throughout the tour, each of the children is tested---til only one remains.The effects in this film are pretty amazing.  I will admit I wasn't certain Depp could pull the role off, but he did.

One that Gene Wilder tried to pull off, but wasn't as successful. Depp's Wonka clearly is more insulated the Wilder's and is creeped out by kids and parents alike. Wilder's Wonka was mildly removed.The costumes, hair and the teeth only accentuate the left of center behaviour that Depp portrays.  Anyone thinking his is a throw away performance needs to look closer.The story is no less child-friendly than 'Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory'...though I don't find Elfman's 'Oompa-Loompa songs as enjoyable. The kids are ok - Charlie being the best of them, though I loved Veruca Salt (still not as good as the original Veruca).

They descend from a common ancestor, but have no more in common than you or I do with the Monkey Chain of Trust. (Well, not me.

For about half the film, the kids seem truer to their book roots, as well, though things have been updated a bit (Mike Teevee, for example, is now a videogame devotee instead of a watcher of TV Westerns; either way, he gets his daily quantity of violence). Apart from that, though, this movie diverges as widely from the book as does the first one, but in decidedly odder ways. Not that this should be much of a surprise from Burton.The character of Willy Wonka, played here with far more an air of overt menace than Gene Wilder took in the original film, is the principal oddity. Wilder played things off as a nice fatherly sort of chap, which made it kind of hard to believe when he suddenly turned around and started raging. Depp's Wonka is thoroughly screwed up from the very start, and were I a ten-year-old about to accompany him into a factory, I'd have to check to make sure chocolate hadn't gotten into my britches on a regular basis. Whereas Wilder's Wonka was all about showing off the goodies, and taking as much delight in them as the kids did, Depp's version wanders through the landscape as if he has no idea what he's looking at. Positively creepy. (This makes the cutting of the original film's most infamous scene, the boat ride, all the more inexplicable.) One could make a pretty strong argument for Depp's character mirroring Willem Dafoe's brilliant performance as Count Orlok in Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire rather than anything that came out of the mind of either Dahl or Wilder.It's not a bad comparison, though one has to buy the idea that Depp himself actually took the path that Murnau (John Malkovich) provided as Orlok's cover story in Shadow. Depp looked into the motivations of his character, which are explored in depth here, and came up with a neurotic bag of bones who's so ill-socialized that, even when it comes to the moment he's been dreaming of these past few years, we still can't buy it. I'm relatively sure no one reading this review could possibly have gone their entire lives without seeing either the original film or this one, but I'll still not spoil the ending for you; let's just say that when it happens, it doesn't sit right.This is an immensely interesting film for all the wrong reasons. Johnny Depp's character is endlessly fascinating, but that's a whole different ball of wax than saying Willy Wonka, or the film that surrounds him, is immensely interesting. ** ",3,What? ...What?

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[0, 0]","In this interesting remake of a classic that delivers a very different movie to be enjoyed by a very different audience Tim Burton and Jonny Depp go to extremes in Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Unlike the 1971 original there aren't the musical scores and balance of weirdness and good humor here, this one is all about weirdness.  But coming from Burton who brought us greats like ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" we can only expect a strange take on the film.  Depp of corse adds his own dash of strangeness to the blend making this a film that feels dark quirky and strange.  While the premise of the original and (the book) are roughly the same to this one it is the feelings that have changed and while both movies can be split into two parts, before Wonka and after Wonka, in the Burton's remake the second half is all Wonka where the children only play a supporting role.What this film has going for it is an amazing display of great effects and visually stimulating scenery and some wry and sarcastic lines from Depp.  While Gene Wilder's Wonka was a character that was strange but loveable, Depp's is well just strange.  The oompah loompahs do get more speaking parts and sing actual lyrics from the actual book which coming from Dahl are naturally very cute and funny with just an aspect of the bizarre.  What the film lacks is that emotional charge that made the audience sympathetic to Charlie - of course the title is a misnomer - this film is all about Wonka.While this film is a completely different film from the original it is still worth seeing.  I will say that I like the original better but this is an interesting take on the same story.  Tim Burton and Jonny Depp fans will certainly appreciate the film since the film literally exudes their essence.  Considering the competition of this summer's films I am sure that this film will do well.

They're the only things making money at the box office nowadays.  We should make one.  Any suggestions?Flunky #1:  How about Porky's?Studio Head:  Nah, too raunchy.  R-rated comedies rarely do well.Flunky #2:  What about Bambi?Studio Head:  Too nice and cheery.  A family flick needs to have some bite to it in order to work in these times.  Just look at The Incredibles and Shrek.  Besides, the Mouse owns the rights. (looks at Flunky #3, who is eating a candy bar)  what do you think we should do, Jennings?Flunky #3:  Mmmm... this candy bar sure is tasty!  The milk chocolate is divine!Studio Head:  Wait a second... chocolate... how about we remake Willy Wonka?  It's not too cheery and there are lots of colorful sets.  Audiences will be mesmerized.Flunky #1:  Do you really think a musical would work in this day and age?Studio Head:  Nah, but who cares?  We can eighty-six the musical numbers.Flunky #2:  But wouldn't purists complain?Studio Head:  Okay, okay, we can leave one or two in, but none of that crap from the original.  We'll write some of our own stuff.  (turns to Pickles the Monkey)  Are you up to writing a song or two for the Wonka remake, Pickles?Pickles:  EEEEK!  EEEEEEEK!Flunky #3:  How about the star?  Surely, we can't hire Gene Wilder.  He's too old.Studio Head:  You're right, Jennings.  He's also not young or pleasing to the eye.  Box office death.Flunky #1:  I know of someone perfect!  (pulls out cell phone and dials)  Hello, Tom Green?  We were wondering if you'd like to play Willy Wonka in our new-what?  You think doing a remake is stupid?  (hangs up phone)Studio Head:  We don't need him anyway.  Say, give me that rolodex, Jennings.  It's time we pick our players the old-fashioned way-in a game of rolodex roulette!Flunky #3:  Ah, yes, isn't this how you cast War of the Worlds?  (hands his boss the rolodex)Studio Head:  (opens rolodex, spins it and points blindly)  Okay, Tim Burton.  I guess he can direct the film... and... (repeats his previous auctions) Johnny Depp!  Warthington, get on the phone to Mr. Depp!Flunky #1:  (dials his cell phone)  Hello, Johnny?  It's Warner Bros.  We're wondering if you'd like to star in our new remake of Willy Wonka?  What?  You'd love to!  Excellent!  But what?  You want to make a few changes?Studio Head:  That's fine, that's fine.  He's Johnny Depp, for crying out loud.  (looks up at his 21 Jump Street poster)  I LOVE HIM SO!Flunky #1:  No songs?  Well, we already nixed the songs, John.  No likable characters?  Okay, that's fine, too.  It works for all of Reese Witherspoon's movies.  And you want your Wonka to be creepy, pasty-faced and almost pedophilic, like Michael Jackson?Studio Head:  A ripped from the headlines Wonka, just like the Law & Order franchise on television!

Yet, this story about the mysterious candy maker does indulge in some liberties of its own.In addition to updated special effects, it attempted to explain why Willy Wonka ended up the way he did.Willy Wonka (Depp) was himself an unfortunate child at one point. He grew up with a sinister dentist father and never quite forgot the experience. Even when he became famous and rich, Wonka remembered where he came from. This gives him something to empathize with. The film honestly could have flown without this subplot being tucked in, but because it (again owning to Burton's direction more than anything) did not distract from the overall storyline, the inclusion is tolerable.The Wonka in this film is a gothic metrosexual type. Frankly when I looked at him, I first thought of Marilyn Manson or another shock rocker. While I usually only see remakes of classic films (regardless of how accurate the originals themselves really were) only because there is nothing else to do, the idea of seeing 'Marilyn Manson' give spoiled brats (who, yes, are especially mean in this film) their just deserts was something which I could not miss. Sure enough, it provided me with a tasty summer treat.Ed Wood did a marvelous job with this film, understanding Dahl's original work. Because Dahl's work was never meant to be 'family friendly' these two are the perfect combination for each otherIt's so easy these days for studios to attempt substituting flashy graphics and other special effects for any semblance of plot, but the special effect innovations in this film were used sparingly.

939177,AK1OBVI54SY73,B000BB1MHS,"Rocky ""Raquel""","[1, 5]","I have watched the old Charlie and the Chocolate a few times and I do enjoy it for it is a very imaginative and interesting story. Upon hearing a remake I was intrigued to see how well Depp could fill into the role Gene Wilder seemed to master. Definitely he did. I'm not surprised though because Depp always picks the riskiest of roles. While most actors only take a role or two that is a risk for their career, Depp takes them all the time in bold confidence and that is why he is one awesome actor. He is certainly worth watching in this film from his haircut to his humorous, quirky personality. Honestly though Depp makes you laugh in this film and he makes the Wonka role very believable as the eccentric he is. The others, the parents and the children actually played their roles well so I don't know what other reviewers are talking about- but indeed Willy Wonka was the one you always paid the most attention to.Now if you compare the two films, the older and this new version, there are differences you should know of. Now I don't really want to give away anything but there are differences you're going to point out but honestly they do not affect the story from its true storyline. Matter of fact, this film fills in a few gaps that the older version failed to give out, such as Wonka's past. This story is still very powerful and still very creative as the old one and worth the watch. Depp is someone certainly that needs to be watched- he is a natural when it comes to roles as these.If you want to watch a colorful, creative, and humorous film, this is the one to watch.

Zwick,"[2, 3]","**1/2Tim Burton, normally one of the most innovative and inspired of modern American filmmakers, comes a cropper with ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" a cold and crass adaptation of the beloved children's story by Roald Dahl.  This is actually the second filming of the work, the first being the charming and delightful 1971 film renamed ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to give Gene Wilder the title role.In this remake, Johnny Depp takes on the part of the famed chocolate manufacturer who decides to open up his factory to the first five children who find a gold ticket in one of his bars.  Charlie is the sweet-tempered young boy who is the fifth to do so, and, thus, gets to take the tour along with four other obnoxious brats who have none of the purity of spirit he does.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" fails to make us care about either the situation or the characters.  Depp plays Wonka like a bizarre cross between Michael Jackson and Carol Burnett, and Burton, even with all his attention to detail in the sets and special effects, is unable to distract is from the fact that not a whole lot is really going on in the film.  The early scenes, involving Charlie's eccentric relatives and their attempts to secure the ticket for him, have a warm, familial feel to them, but once the tour itself begins, we become as imprisoned in the claustrophobic setting as the characters themselves.Locked in a tedious monotony, the plot essentially consists of Wonka, the children, and their respective parents moving from room to room where each of the four brats meets up with his or her well-deserved comeuppance in the form of a bizarre factory accident, until only sweet little Charlie is left.  Interspersed throughout are a series of inane song-and-dance sequences a la Busby Berkeley and uninteresting and undramatic flashbacks to Wonka's deprived and unhappy childhood that are somehow supposed to explain why he has become the creepy character we find at the center of the story.The art direction and set decoration are fine but not impressive enough to make us overlook the dullness and unpleasantness of so much of the film.  Mr. Burton may need to go back to making the kind of small, quirky films that he cut his directorial teeth on and leave these empty, bloated big screen extravaganzas to others.",2,"dull, clumsy remake",1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2326,"['**1/2Tim', 'Burton', 'normally', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'inspired', 'modern', 'American', 'filmmakers', 'cropper', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'cold', 'crass', 'adaptation', 'beloved', 'children', 'story', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'actually', 'second', 'filming', 'work', 'first', 'being', 'charming', 'delightful', '1971', 'film', 'renamed', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'give', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'title', 'role.In', 'remake', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'part', 'famed', 'chocolate', 'manufacturer', 'who', 'open', 'up', 'factory', 'first', 'five', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'gold', 'ticket', 'one', 'bars', 'Charlie', 'sweet-tempered', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'fifth', 'do', 'so', 'thus', 'take', 'tour', 'four', 'other', 'obnoxious', 'brats', 'who', 'have', 'none', 'purity', 'spirit', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'make', 'care', 'situation', 'characters', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'bizarre', 'cross', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Burton', 'even', 'attention', 'detail', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'unable', 'distract', 'fact', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'really', 'going', 'film', 'early', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Charlie', 'eccentric', 'relatives', 'attempts', 'secure', 'ticket', 'have', 'warm', 'familial', 'feel', 'once', 'tour', 'become', 'imprisoned', 'claustrophobic', 'setting', 'characters', 'themselves.Locked', 'tedious', 'monotony', 'plot', 'essentially', 'Wonka', 'children', 'respective', 'parents', 'moving', 'room', 'room', 'where', 'four', 'brats', 'up', 'well-deserved', 'comeuppance', 'form', 'bizarre', 'factory', 'accident', 'only', 'sweet', 'little', 'Charlie', 'left', 'Interspersed', 'are', 'series', 'inane', 'song-and-dance', 'sequences', 'la', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'uninteresting', 'undramatic', 'flashbacks', 'Wonka', 'deprived', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'are', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'explain', 'why', 'become', 'creepy', 'character', 'find', 'center', 'story.The', 'art', 'direction', 'set', 'decoration', 'are', 'fine', 'not', 'impressive', 'enough', 'make', 'overlook', 'dullness', 'unpleasantness', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Burton', 'may', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'making', 'kind', 'small', 'quirky', 'films', 'cut', 'directorial', 'teeth', 'leave', 'empty', 'bloated', 'big', 'screen', 'extravaganzas', 'others']",N/A

All the kids reflected the various deadly sins of pride, greed, arrogance and gluttony with great humor.On the negative side, the extreme departures from the book were glaring. You can take license so far and then it becomes another Hollywood hack job.

The original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" has plenty of imagination, but there are moments where it gets overly tedious. For instance, it took way too long to get into the factory itself. Then there were the unnecessary musical interludes (""Cheer Up Charly""? Puh-lease.)In this new iteration, however, you will notice that they get to the factory as soon as possible. There are not even any songs until they finally arrive at the door of the factory. This helps further differentiate the imaginative, fantastical air of the factory from the monotonous drudgery of the ""real world"". When we first watched it in the theater (I went with my brother, his wife and their [then] two daughters) my brother admitted that he was so surprised that they didn't have a long unnecessary song in the scene where Grandpa Joe gets out of bed for the first time in years. The scene played out better for that simple omission.Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy the Gene Wilder version, but this one has a charm and energy that is simply frenetic, while the other one got a bit too caught up in justifying certain aspects of the story-telling.Wonderful movie.

939183,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000BB1MHS,Samuel McKewon,"[9, 12]","""Charlie and Chocolate Factory"" is a  expensive, creepy  film. It's perverse on a level kids may not get but does transmit to adults, who might wonder what director Tim Burton, and star Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, are getting at, exactly. It's dark, episodic and surprisingly unfunny, aiming for that demographic that enjoy watching episodes of ""Maury"" where the bad kids get sent to boot camp to get humiliated and browbeaten.True, the book by Roald Dahl is not exactly a lark: Five children are invited to the reclusive Willy Wonka's massive confection factory after finding golden tickets inside their candy bar wrappers and four of them are ironically punished for their various bad habits.  One impoverished Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is polite and reserved during his visit, and thus rewarded for being the kind of child Dahl preferred: The saint.Played by Highmore as a nice, shy boy, Charlie finds his golden ticket in the third Wonka chocolate bar he buys; he takes his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly in a diminished, useless role) to Wonka's factory just down the road. He's joined by lard German Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), spoiled English aristocrat Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and two competitive American punks, Violet Biodegrade (AnnaSophia Robb) and Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry). Gloop is a glutton, and the rest are grabby and annoying. But none of them know what to make of Willy Wonka, played by Depp as if he were channeling...someone very strange.Is it Michael Jackson? Vogue editor Anna Wintour? Jude Law's character in ""Artificial Intelligence?"" A John Malkovich villain? It's mannered and organic - clearly Depp had to rewrite some of this material toward his characterization - and a rallying point for the bad kids.  These brats don't much like anyone, but they have reason to suspect and loathe Willy.So when Gloop, Mike, Veruca, Violet get theirs in Burton's vision, their calamities are presented straight away while a bemused, detached, fey Depp looks on in his bob haircut. Burton also cloned one actor (Deep Roy) through CGI for all the Oompa Loompas, whose primary function is to perform dance numbers closely parroting 1970s songs most kids wouldn't know, the lyrics of which zoom by with such speed you don't know what the Oompas are singing about anyway.Burton never really brackets these numbers, or many of the scenes in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" The movie just unfurls, unaware of its own rhythm, unwilling to comment on anything except Willy's childhood (one of those classic Burton deals of a father isolating his son) that doesn't begin to explain Depp's behavior. He's Willy Weirdo, not Wonka, and that the movie made a pile of dough is not a tribute to its quality but marketing and a lack of audience taste.",2,Willy Weirdo...,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2765,"['Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'expensive', 'creepy', 'film', 'perverse', 'level', 'kids', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'transmit', 'adults', 'who', 'might', 'wonder', 'what', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'star', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'are', 'getting', 'exactly', 'dark', 'episodic', 'surprisingly', 'unfunny', 'aiming', 'demographic', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'episodes', 'Maury', 'where', 'bad', 'kids', 'get', 'sent', 'boot', 'camp', 'get', 'humiliated', 'browbeaten.True', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'not', 'exactly', 'lark', 'Five', 'children', 'are', 'invited', 'reclusive', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'massive', 'confection', 'factory', 'finding', 'golden', 'tickets', 'candy', 'bar', 'wrappers', 'four', 'are', 'ironically', 'punished', 'various', 'bad', 'habits', 'One', 'impoverished', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'polite', 'reserved', 'visit', 'thus', 'rewarded', 'being', 'kind', 'child', 'Dahl', 'preferred', 'saint.Played', 'Highmore', 'nice', 'shy', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'golden', 'ticket', 'third', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'bar', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'David', 'Kelly', 'diminished', 'useless', 'role', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'just', 'road', 'joined', 'lard', 'German', 'Augustus', 'Gloop', 'Philip', 'Wiegratz', 'spoiled', 'English', 'aristocrat', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'Julia', 'Winter', 'two', 'competitive', 'American', 'punks', 'Violet', 'Biodegrade', 'AnnaSophia', 'Robb', 'Mike', 'Teevee', 'Jordan', 'Fry', 'Gloop', 'glutton', 'rest', 'are', 'grabby', 'annoying', 'none', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'played', 'Depp', 'were', 'channeling', 'someone', 'very', 'strange.Is', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Vogue', 'editor', 'Anna', 'Wintour', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'villain', 'mannered', 'organic', 'clearly', 'Depp', 'had', 'rewrite', 'material', 'characterization', 'rallying', 'point', 'bad', 'kids', 'brats', 'do', ""n't"", 'much', 'anyone', 'have', 'reason', 'suspect', 'loathe', 'Willy.So', 'when', 'Gloop', 'Mike', 'Veruca', 'Violet', 'get', 'theirs', 'Burton', 'vision', 'calamities', 'are', 'presented', 'straight', 'away', 'bemused', 'detached', 'fey', 'Depp', 'bob', 'haircut', 'Burton', 'also', 'cloned', 'one', 'actor', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'CGI', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'primary', 'function', 'perform', 'dance', 'numbers', 'closely', 'parroting', '1970s', 'songs', 'most', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'lyrics', 'zoom', 'such', 'speed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Oompas', 'are', 'singing', 'anyway.Burton', 'never', 'really', 'numbers', 'many', 'scenes', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'movie', 'just', 'unfurls', 'unaware', 'own', 'rhythm', 'unwilling', 'comment', 'anything', 'Willy', 'childhood', 'one', 'classic', 'Burton', 'deals', 'father', 'isolating', 'son', ""n't"", 'begin', 'explain', 'Depp', 'behavior', 'Willy', 'Weirdo', 'not', 'Wonka', 'movie', 'made', 'pile', 'dough', 'not', 'tribute', 'quality', 'marketing', 'lack', 'audience', 'taste']",N/A

I spent the time watching it, and when I think back to remember specific scenes, nothing stood out in my mind.  About 30 minutes into the movie, I thought about turning it off because it just seemed so slow...  Plus, I feel like there were flashes of Tim Burton in the first part, but he didn't put his touch on the movie in the beginning when it really needed it.I thought Johnny Depp was great.  He is a versatile actor, and this really proved it.  His facial movements and curt responses were hilarious, and he had the perfect perky/sinister combination that one would expect of a second generation mad scientist (behind Gene Wilder).  He basically carried this film...I agree with a previous review that the Oompa Loompas really didn't do it for me.  I didn't like that they used the one guy and that they looked so computer generated.  In the first version of the movie, the Oompa Loompas were a little creepy and added to the sinister undertones.

How stupid can one be?!)-It actually shown where the Oompaa Loompas lived at-It shows the toothpaste factory where Charlie's dad worked at.-Two words: Tim Burton.-It showed what Willy Wonka's childhood was like (I would hate having those braces and a psychopathic dentist for a father)-It's actually called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, not Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (it makes it sound like Willy found a golden ticket)-The visuals were amazing.-The songs were right.Cons:-Veruca wasn't bratty enough (to tell you truth, I prefer the 1971 version of Veruca)-Mike Teavee didn't play video games (I guess they wanted to make it more modern)-Stupid people think that Willy Wonka is based off of Michael Jackson.

939192,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000BB1MHS,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 3]","Tim Burton offers the most charmingly off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood.  From his stop-animation work (""The Corpse Bride"") to dark romances (""Edward Scissorhands"") to horror (""Sleepy Hollow""), Burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of tension.Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald Dahl's most famous work, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and remain true to the author's vision.  Most people associate the tamer, goofy ""Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" starring Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him.  So it is perfect that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy.The visuals in ""Charlie"" are astounding.  The chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown water of ""Willie Wonka""), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a classic of mind-blowing set design.  And that is not all - oh, no, that is not all!Possibly the most visually stunning element in ""Charlie"" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.  Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky, nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction.  Depp plays Wonka as tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note. But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps instilled by his dentist father.  This is a great, if much-maligned, performance.The most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen.  In the Wilder film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy ""oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do"" tune.  In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and their dance numbers are even more fantastic.  However, the songs don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs, which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film version, and that is a pretty major quibble.Far from a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions, studied.",4,Amazing visual effects and solid acting make up for second-rate sound,1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,2624,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'most', 'charmingly', 'off-beat', 'yet', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'stop-animation', 'work', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'dark', 'romances', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'horror', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Burton', 'never', 'offer', 'feasts', 'eyes', 'manage', 'make', 'squirm', 'just', 'bit', 'uncomfortably', 'right', 'notes', 'are', 'there', 'are', 'played', 'just', 'off-key', 'enough', 'create', 'thrill', 'tension.Perhaps', 'other', 'director', 'was', 'so', 'suited', 'film', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'remain', 'true', 'author', 'vision', 'Most', 'people', 'associate', 'tamer', 'goofy', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Dahl', 'tale', 'forget', 'Dahl', 'had', 'healthy', 'streak', 'Lemony', 'Snicket', 'sensibility', 'perfect', 'Burton', 'darker', 'more', 'dangerous', 'film', 'enjoy.The', 'visuals', 'Charlie', 'are', 'astounding', 'chocolate', 'waterfall', 'river', 'look', 'actual', 'liquid', 'chocolate', 'not', 'icky', 'brown', 'water', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'squirrel-nut-sorting', 'room', 'classic', 'mind-blowing', 'set', 'design', 'not', 'oh', 'not', 'Possibly', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'element', 'Charlie', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'played', 'Burton', 'favorite', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Depp', 'so', 'deep', 'roles', 'one', 'one', 'wonders', 'inspired', 'Depp', 'quirky', 'nervous', 'mean-spirited', 'selfish', 'concoction', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'as', 'tight', 'Jack', 'Sparrow', 'loose', 'never', 'note', 'whereas', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Willie', 'Wonka', 'was', 'more', 'genial', 'puppetmaster', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'sadistic', 'streak', 'perhaps', 'instilled', 'dentist', 'father', 'great', 'much-maligned', 'most', 'infamous', 'element', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'seemingly-drug-inspired', 'presence', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'Wonka', 'army', 'diminutive', 'henchmen', 'Wilder', 'film', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'were', 'dwarfs', 'given', 'sophomoric', 'dance', 'numbers', 'irritatingly', 'catchy', 'oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do', 'tune', 'version', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'are', 'played', 'same', 'character', 'even', 'are', 'hundreds', 'dance', 'numbers', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'fantastic', 'However', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'same', 'sharp', 'punch', 'original', 'songs', 'pointed', 'out', 'various', 'failings', 'kids', 'parents', 'got', 'eliminated', 'contest', 'Indeed', 'are', 'several', 'lyrics', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'film', 'version', 'pretty', 'major', 'quibble.Far', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'be', 'seen', 'fans', 'artistic', 'visions', 'studied']",N/A

Generally this version stays closer to the original book than the first movie, and Charile just stays an ordinary little boy having an extraordinary adventure.

939198,A1MHXA59Q9O0GV,B000BB1MHS,"Shazzy ""Shazzy""","[4, 6]","Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryWilly Wonka's (Johnny Depp) plan to spruce up his chocolate business is to plant five golden tickets randomly in his Wonka bars inviting the holders to a tour of his factory. For poor Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore, ""Finding Neverland""), chances for a ticket are slim, but luck is on his side; joining spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), competitive Violent Beauregard (Annasophia Robb), perpetually consuming Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), and violent Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry), Charlie meets Wonka, the reclusive, eccentric fellow behind the delights of his factory. As the tour commences, weird things start happening to the selfish, misbehaving children, leaving Charlie alone to deal with Wonka's bizarre behavior, and to try to help him out.If not exactly a classic film, Mel Stuart's 1971 fantasy creation, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" has stood the test of time with its tender realization of childhood sugar fantasies and morbid, goofball humor. With Gene Wilder at the helm of the considerable steerage of oddities, this loose Roald Dahl adaptation has aged as a major 1970s peculiarity, yet, at the same time, remained wonderful. Over 30 years later, noted quirkmeister Tim Burton has taken up the challenge to bring the book (with the true ""Charlie"" title) to the screen again, and he's out to reclaim the cinema version for himself.Immediately, comparing the two productions becomes a fruitless quest. The Stuart film was made in an era of musicals, practical effects, and gee-whiz kid acting. Burton's film exists in a more cynical time, with a more sarcastic filmmaker. Opening with Danny Elfman's familiar scoring backing the creation, by cold steel machines, of the Wonka bars, the tone is clearly set: this is no candy shop, and the candy man can't. Burton has more in store for his audience than simple sweets and soft-shoe.With a rapturous and meticulous production design, a tongue firmly placed in cheek, and the appearance of Christopher Lee as Willy's dentist dad, this is a Burton film through and through. That being established, ""Charlie"" is a chilly affair, more concerned with technical prowess than heart or plot. For the most part, this change in focus is fine, for Burton's take on Willy's chocolate factory is a marvel, packed with infinite candy rooms, singing, dancing, cocoa-bean worshiping Oompa Loompas (all played by movie MVP, Deep Roy, ""The Neverending Story""), and legitimate danger. While a lot of the film is sweetened with CGI, Burton still palms the primal magic of Wonka's wonderland with his extensive visuals, and the depth and life he gives the factory is almost perfect.Almost perfect can also be said of Johnny Depp, who steps out of the mile-long shadow of Gene Wilder to fashion his own twisted take on Willy. Since the aim for ""Charlie"" isn't pointed at the heart, Depp's Wonka is a strange fellow who hates parents, is easily annoyed by children, and appears to be a germaphobe. Not exactly the winking teddy bear Wilder went after in his legendary performance, but Depp's oddball acting fits heavenly with Burton's vision, and the two team up yet again for another rousing, wildly original collaboration.However, with Depp and the computer effects taking the lead, poor little Charlie isn't left with much to do. Freddie Highmore is an inspired choice for the unlikely Golden Ticket winner, and his English puppy dog demeanor does the film a world of good in the emotion department. But Burton keeps Charlie at arm's length for the entire film, along with the other kid actors (who aren't nearly as interesting or natural as Highmore), leaving unfair comparisons to the stellar child acting work in the original incarnation to dance through the head.Tim Burton's ""Charlie"" corrects many mistakes from the Stuart film (the Oompas aren't creepily orange and green anymore, and Burton has mercifully done away with the infamously bizarre, psychedelic boat trip sequence), along with raising the epic visual stakes for the more visionary angles of the story that needed it. Burton has created a genuinely fun movie for the family, blessed with a zippy running time, and those tired of the Wilder warmth for this often ominous tale will rejoice over this new icy stab at detailing Wonka's outrageous tour.",4,No Musical But still good,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,4305,"['Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'FactoryWilly', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'plan', 'spruce', 'up', 'chocolate', 'business', 'plant', 'five', 'golden', 'tickets', 'randomly', 'Wonka', 'bars', 'inviting', 'holders', 'tour', 'factory', 'poor', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'chances', 'ticket', 'are', 'slim', 'luck', 'side', 'joining', 'spoiled', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'Julia', 'Winter', 'competitive', 'Violent', 'Beauregard', 'Annasophia', 'Robb', 'perpetually', 'consuming', 'Augustus', 'Gloop', 'Philip', 'Wiegratz', 'violent', 'Mike', 'Teavee', 'Jordon', 'Fry', 'Charlie', 'Wonka', 'reclusive', 'eccentric', 'fellow', 'delights', 'factory', 'tour', 'commences', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'selfish', 'misbehaving', 'children', 'leaving', 'Charlie', 'alone', 'deal', 'Wonka', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'try', 'help', 'out.If', 'not', 'exactly', 'classic', 'film', 'Mel', 'Stuart', '1971', 'fantasy', 'creation', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'tender', 'realization', 'childhood', 'sugar', 'fantasies', 'morbid', 'goofball', 'humor', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'helm', 'considerable', 'steerage', 'oddities', 'loose', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'adaptation', 'aged', 'major', '1970s', 'peculiarity', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'remained', 'wonderful', '30', 'years', 'later', 'noted', 'quirkmeister', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'taken', 'up', 'challenge', 'bring', 'book', 'true', 'Charlie', 'title', 'screen', 'again', 'out', 'reclaim', 'cinema', 'version', 'himself.Immediately', 'comparing', 'two', 'productions', 'fruitless', 'quest', 'Stuart', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'era', 'musicals', 'practical', 'effects', 'gee-whiz', 'kid', 'acting', 'Burton', 'film', 'more', 'cynical', 'time', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'filmmaker', 'Opening', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'familiar', 'scoring', 'backing', 'creation', 'cold', 'steel', 'machines', 'Wonka', 'bars', 'tone', 'clearly', 'set', 'candy', 'shop', 'candy', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Burton', 'more', 'store', 'audience', 'simple', 'sweets', 'soft-shoe.With', 'rapturous', 'meticulous', 'production', 'design', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'placed', 'cheek', 'appearance', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Willy', 'dentist', 'dad', 'Burton', 'film', 'being', 'established', 'Charlie', 'chilly', 'affair', 'more', 'concerned', 'technical', 'prowess', 'heart', 'plot', 'most', 'part', 'change', 'focus', 'fine', 'Burton', 'take', 'Willy', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'marvel', 'packed', 'infinite', 'candy', 'rooms', 'singing', 'dancing', 'cocoa-bean', 'worshiping', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'played', 'movie', 'MVP', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'legitimate', 'danger', 'lot', 'film', 'sweetened', 'CGI', 'Burton', 'still', 'primal', 'magic', 'Wonka', 'wonderland', 'extensive', 'visuals', 'depth', 'life', 'factory', 'almost', 'perfect.Almost', 'perfect', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'mile-long', 'shadow', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'fashion', 'own', 'twisted', 'take', 'Willy', 'aim', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'pointed', 'heart', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'strange', 'fellow', 'who', 'parents', 'easily', 'annoyed', 'children', 'be', 'germaphobe', 'Not', 'exactly', 'winking', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Wilder', 'went', 'legendary', 'performance', 'Depp', 'oddball', 'acting', 'fits', 'heavenly', 'Burton', 'vision', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'yet', 'again', 'rousing', 'wildly', 'original', 'collaboration.However', 'Depp', 'computer', 'effects', 'taking', 'lead', 'poor', 'little', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'left', 'much', 'do', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'inspired', 'choice', 'unlikely', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'winner', 'English', 'puppy', 'dog', 'demeanor', 'film', 'world', 'good', 'emotion', 'department', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'arm', 'length', 'entire', 'film', 'other', 'kid', 'actors', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'interesting', 'natural', 'Highmore', 'leaving', 'unfair', 'comparisons', 'stellar', 'child', 'acting', 'work', 'original', 'incarnation', 'dance', 'head.Tim', 'Burton', 'Charlie', 'many', 'mistakes', 'Stuart', 'film', 'Oompas', 'are', ""n't"", 'creepily', 'orange', 'green', 'anymore', 'Burton', 'mercifully', 'done', 'away', 'infamously', 'bizarre', 'psychedelic', 'boat', 'trip', 'sequence', 'raising', 'epic', 'visual', 'stakes', 'more', 'visionary', 'angles', 'story', 'needed', 'Burton', 'created', 'genuinely', 'fun', 'movie', 'family', 'blessed', 'zippy', 'running', 'time', 'tired', 'Wilder', 'warmth', 'often', 'ominous', 'tale', 'will', 'rejoice', 'new', 'icy', 'stab', 'detailing', 'Wonka', 'outrageous', 'tour']",N/A

As is the case here.Tim Burton's remake of Ronald Dante's bestselling children's novel is very much a Tim Burton film.  Dark, dramatic and with a lot of hidden meanings for the adults.  And this, I think, is the first problem with this film.  The original version was light and funny.  Silly, sure.  But it never seemed dark, even in its most serious, retrospective moments.  It was a child's fantasy and despite the now-cheesy nature of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the cheese quotient just seemed to work.  Of course we knew those candies were blown up beach balls and the choco-river was brown colored water, but we wanted to believe in the fairy tale and so we did.Mr. Burton's version is definitely much more spectacular with the special effects.  But somehow they just don't translate into a fluffy child's fantasy.The second problem, and a much larger problem, is the casting of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.  I think Johnny Depp is a tremendously talented actor and he was perfect as Edward Scissorhands.  He brought depth and emotion to a troubled and dark character.  But he was terribly miscast as Willy Wonka.  He played Wonka as a flat out oddity, he of deathly pale skin and pageboy hair cut.  His effeminate voice and pure glee in the discomfort and almost destruction of some of the children is disturbing at best, and borders on cruelty.  Whereas Gene Wilder played Willy Wonka as an eccentric but loveable fellow, Depp's Wonka belongs on a therapist's couch.  Whereas you could laugh at Wilder's Wonka or believe that he truly loved making candy, you just have to wonder how Depp's Wonka could have made it successfuly as a business man.Add to the mix the background story of Wonka's childhood and his dentist father, from whom he is alienated . . . well, do we really care?  Isn't the story about Charlie and his wish fulfilled?  Rather, this version seems to be about Tim Burton and his wish to remake a child's classic as far from the original as possible.The children bring bright spots to the otherwise heavy film.  They are splendid little actors and perfectly cast.  As in the original, the parents have little to do, other than stand by while their children are taught lessons.The Oompa Loompas also make a return appearance, although the songs here, rather than being silly little ditties, are geared almost toward music videos.All in all, I would steer clear of this one and pull out the 1971 version.",2,Preferred the Original,1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,2590,"['hate', 'compare', 'remakes', 'originals', 'oftentimes', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'are', 'worlds', 'apart', 'counterparts', 'case', 'Burton', 'remake', 'Ronald', 'Dante', 'bestselling', 'children', 'novel', 'very', 'much', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'Dark', 'dramatic', 'lot', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'adults', 'think', 'first', 'problem', 'film', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'light', 'funny', 'Silly', 'sure', 'never', 'seemed', 'dark', 'even', 'most', 'serious', 'retrospective', 'moments', 'was', 'child', 'fantasy', 'now-cheesy', 'nature', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'cheese', 'quotient', 'just', 'seemed', 'work', 'course', 'knew', 'candies', 'were', 'blown', 'up', 'beach', 'balls', 'choco-river', 'was', 'brown', 'colored', 'water', 'wanted', 'believe', 'fairy', 'tale', 'so', 'did.Mr', 'Burton', 'version', 'definitely', 'much', 'more', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'somehow', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'fluffy', 'child', 'fantasy.The', 'second', 'problem', 'much', 'larger', 'problem', 'casting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'think', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'tremendously', 'talented', 'actor', 'was', 'perfect', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'brought', 'depth', 'emotion', 'troubled', 'dark', 'character', 'was', 'terribly', 'miscast', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'played', 'Wonka', 'flat', 'out', 'oddity', 'deathly', 'pale', 'skin', 'pageboy', 'hair', 'cut', 'effeminate', 'voice', 'pure', 'glee', 'discomfort', 'almost', 'destruction', 'children', 'disturbing', 'best', 'borders', 'cruelty', 'Whereas', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'played', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'eccentric', 'loveable', 'fellow', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'therapist', 'couch', 'could', 'laugh', 'Wilder', 'Wonka', 'believe', 'truly', 'loved', 'making', 'candy', 'just', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'successfuly', 'business', 'man.Add', 'mix', 'background', 'story', 'Wonka', 'childhood', 'dentist', 'father', 'whom', 'alienated', 'well', 'do', 'really', 'care', ""n't"", 'story', 'Charlie', 'wish', 'fulfilled', 'Rather', 'version', 'be', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'wish', 'remake', 'child', 'classic', 'far', 'original', 'possible.The', 'children', 'bring', 'bright', 'spots', 'otherwise', 'heavy', 'film', 'are', 'splendid', 'little', 'actors', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'original', 'parents', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'stand', 'children', 'are', 'taught', 'lessons.The', 'Oompa', 'Loompas', 'also', 'make', 'return', 'appearance', 'songs', 'here', 'rather', 'being', 'silly', 'little', 'ditties', 'are', 'geared', 'almost', 'music', 'videos.All', 'would', 'steer', 'clear', 'one', 'pull', 'out', '1971', 'version']",N/A
939204,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000BB1MHS,Simon,"[0, 1]","I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with high expectations. Comparisons to the Gene Wilder original aside, Burton had promised a darker movie that was truer to Roald Dahl's classic book. With modern special effects, that sounded like something to experience.The good news is that if you've read the novel, this flick does incorporate many of the elements that the 70s version left out. You get your Indian Prince story, a much grander boat ride down the river of chocolate, and the infamous scene in the nut room. Charlie's father is also back in the story now, and has his job in the toothpaste factory.But then the flick takes some odd turns of its own. The Oompa-Loompa songs use the original lyrics from the novel, but take off in a very garish direction that's neither good nor bad, just...bizzare. Johnny Depp, for all the critical acclaim he's had playing eccentric characters, feels rather forced here. He's distinctive and amusing, but I can't help but feel Gene Wilder was closer to what Dahl envisioned. Finally, the movie tacks on a very sappy subplot about Wonka's dentist father and his parental issues. For all that Burton said about making this movie darker, these parts felt as sugary as the happy ending in the original.I like the Burton version, but oddly enough I still find the 70s original to be a truer interpretation of the whimsical and discomforting world Dahl created. The best effort would probably be a mix of both, and it might be worth another remake 20 more years down the road to see that happen. This deluxe version has some okay extras, but not enough to justify the price tag difference if you see the bare-bones one significantly cheaper.

Holla, my peepenheimers - I finally gave into my curiousity and watched the new ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" directed by the highly overrated Tim Burton and the almost equally overrated Johnny Depp.  PUH-LEASE!!Look, I will not disguise my absolute unabashedly love for the original classic masterpieceWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition). Gene Wilder is pure genious as Mr. Wonka, in a performance that simply cannot be repeated, bettered, or even equalled.  Depp was foolishly ill-prepared to try.  Whereas Wilder invested a truly menacing, disturbing side to Wonka, Depp makes him simply 'kinda weird'.  Thumbs (and gobstoppers) down to him.Much is always celebrated about Tim Burton's visual and overall atmosphere created in his movies.  Yeah, he is a capable visual stylist.  But it matters very little when he doesn't do anything else right!  I'm not saying he never has (I lovedFrankenweenie). But more often enough he just comes across like a dork.I liked Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompa's (and he was also the film's narrator).  But I thought the new Charlie was too goody-goody and he embarrassed his grandpa.  After his Grandpa was happy about being able to go to the factory, Charlie was all ""Oh but I should sell the ticket to help the family"" and made his Grandpa look like a big jerk.  There is a limit to how ""helpful"" a child should be.  Talk about a killjoy.  The actor playing the Grandpa is utterly delightful!  Best performance in the film.I didn't like the kids as much as in the original. I don't mean the young actors themselves, heavens no.

939207,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000BB1MHS,S. Rhodes,"[4, 5]","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton's make on the book by Roald Dahl and his remake of the 1971 classic: ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.""Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka, a strange man who lives in a factory that makes lots of candy.  Some of it is strange candy at that (an everlasting Gobstopper and a piece of gum that holds breakfast, lunch and dinner).  Well, Wonka has decided to put Golden Tickets in his bars, five in total.  Five lucky children will be able to tour Wonka's factory.  Charlie, a poor boy who can't really afford any chocolate bars, stumbles onto the Golden Ticket after having a third bar.The other children who got these bars: A husky gentleman named Agustus Gloop, a rich snob named Veruca Salt, a champian named Violette and a boy who loves science named Mike Taevee.The movie isn't bad.  It's fairly good.  Johnny Depp makes a good Willy Wonka, but you can't replace Gene Wilder.  Johnny Depp is only good because he's good at playing strange characters, and Tim Burton often makes strange and dark films (films we love, no doubt).  Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka in my eyes.The look of the film is incredible!  Well, to put it simple, it's an update to the 1970's version.  Some parts look abosolutely stunning.  The special effects are top notch, and the Oompa Loompa's are pretty cool (considering only one person played all of 'em).  The songs the Oompa Loompa's sing are very good and very well choreographed.  They're NOT better than the songs in the original.  The original was more interactive and more riddle like.  This one is just here to be upbeat and ""keep up with the times"".However, the problem with this film is simple: It's virtually the same thing we saw in the 1970's version.  Some words of dialogue are almost exactly the same (Violet's monologue when she finds her golden ticket is word-for-word the same).  Everything that happens to the kids when they're ""bad"" is the same.  The only difference is that we get to see the kids afterwards, unlike the 1971 original.The changes in the story (which weren't a lot, but some were big) can sometimes be pleasant.  I didn't much care for Wonka's past, but they threw it in this film, and it made the ending a bit... stranger.  I was pleased that we saw what happened to the kids as well.  Wonka, is totally different than what he was in the original, and in the book.  Courtesy of Johnny Depp.  In the original he was a lonely guy but was testing to see if the kids would steal his greatest invention, the everlasting Gobstopper.  In this, there's no real test to see who should keep his factory.  It's all based on who the last kid left is (the one Wonka will say is the ""Least rotten"").It's a good film.  The look Tim Burton gives it is nothing short of brilliant.  The children who visit his factory are forgettable, except for maybe Charlie who manages to be BETTER than the original Charlie (although I was disappointed that the song ""I got a golden ticket"" didn't play when he got it).There are funny moments, some you'll die of laughter.  Johnny Depp delivers the character of Wonka very well, but as I stated before: Gene Wilder WAS Willy Wonka.  Filling Wilder's shoes is hard, and not even Johnny Depp (who after Pirates of the Caribbean seems to be the guy to get for your ""strange"" people) could surpass him.Before I close I will say one other thing.  The music is perhaps one of the best musical scores I've ever heard in a movie before.  Most Tim Burton films have excellent music, and this is no exception.  Each track goes along quite well with the situation.  The opening theme is the best one!Will fans of the original like it?  More than not.  Some will abosolutely hate it!  If you loved the original for it's characters and such: you probably won't like this one.  But if you enjoyed it for the story... it's nothing new, virtually it's the exact same as the original with an extended ending and update in it's look to make it more ""modern"".I'd say the original is better, but this one is just as good.  The characters (with the exception of Charlie) aren't really anything to write home about, but overall this is a good film.",4,Fans of the Original will be pleased,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,4166,"['Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'make', 'book', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'remake', '1971', 'classic', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'factory', 'lots', 'candy', 'strange', 'candy', 'everlasting', 'Gobstopper', 'piece', 'gum', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'Well', 'Wonka', 'decided', 'put', 'Golden', 'Tickets', 'bars', 'five', 'total', 'Five', 'lucky', 'children', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'tour', 'Wonka', 'factory', 'Charlie', 'poor', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'afford', 'chocolate', 'bars', 'stumbles', 'Golden', 'Ticket', 'having', 'third', 'bar.The', 'other', 'children', 'who', 'got', 'bars', 'husky', 'gentleman', 'named', 'Agustus', 'Gloop', 'rich', 'snob', 'named', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'champian', 'named', 'Violette', 'boy', 'who', 'science', 'named', 'Mike', 'Taevee.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'fairly', 'good', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'good', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'ca', ""n't"", 'replace', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'only', 'good', 'good', 'playing', 'strange', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'often', 'strange', 'dark', 'films', 'love', 'doubt', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'eyes.The', 'look', 'film', 'incredible', 'Well', 'put', 'simple', 'update', '1970', 'version', 'parts', 'look', 'abosolutely', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'considering', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'played', ""'em"", 'songs', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'sing', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'well', 'choreographed', ""'re"", 'NOT', 'better', 'songs', 'original', 'original', 'was', 'more', 'interactive', 'more', 'riddle', 'one', 'just', 'here', 'be', 'upbeat', 'keep', 'times', '.However', 'problem', 'film', 'simple', 'virtually', 'same', 'thing', 'saw', '1970', 'version', 'words', 'dialogue', 'are', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'Violet', 'monologue', 'when', 'golden', 'ticket', 'word-for-word', 'same', 'Everything', 'kids', 'when', ""'re"", 'bad', 'same', 'only', 'difference', 'get', 'see', 'kids', 'afterwards', '1971', 'original.The', 'changes', 'story', 'were', ""n't"", 'lot', 'were', 'big', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'pleasant', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Wonka', 'past', 'threw', 'film', 'made', 'ending', 'bit', 'stranger', 'was', 'pleased', 'saw', 'what', 'happened', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'Wonka', 'totally', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'original', 'book', 'Courtesy', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'original', 'was', 'lonely', 'guy', 'was', 'testing', 'see', 'kids', 'would', 'steal', 'greatest', 'invention', 'everlasting', 'Gobstopper', 'real', 'test', 'see', 'who', 'should', 'keep', 'factory', 'based', 'who', 'last', 'kid', 'left', 'one', 'Wonka', 'will', 'say', 'Least', 'rotten', '.It', 'good', 'film', 'look', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'children', 'who', 'visit', 'factory', 'are', 'forgettable', 'maybe', 'Charlie', 'who', 'be', 'BETTER', 'original', 'Charlie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'song', 'got', 'golden', 'ticket', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'when', 'got', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'die', 'laughter', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'character', 'Wonka', 'very', 'well', 'stated', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'WAS', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Filling', 'Wilder', 'shoes', 'hard', 'not', 'even', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'be', 'guy', 'get', 'strange', 'people', 'could', 'surpass', 'him.Before', 'close', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'other', 'thing', 'music', 'perhaps', 'one', 'best', 'musical', 'scores', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'Most', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'have', 'excellent', 'music', 'exception', 'track', 'quite', 'well', 'situation', 'opening', 'theme', 'best', 'one', 'Will', 'fans', 'original', 'More', 'not', 'will', 'abosolutely', 'hate', 'loved', 'original', 'characters', 'such', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'virtually', 'exact', 'same', 'original', 'extended', 'ending', 'update', 'look', 'make', 'more', 'modern', '.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'original', 'better', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'characters', 'exception', 'Charlie', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'overall', 'good', 'film']",N/A

And so I was ditched, by my family, but I knew that I had to see it on dvd.The first movie was called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, this one is called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which is more appriotaly titled, since Charlie is the main character. The first 35 minutes I feel were rushed, because by that point they were in line at the factory, in the older version, it was about a hour before that happened, and there were all these musical numbers that took some time. The first movie ran 1 hour and 40 minutes, this movie runs 1 hour and 55 minutes. As the movie begins, we meet the hero of this story Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) who lives with his Mom (Helena Bonham Carter) and Dad (Noah Taylor), and his grandparents Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) , Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith) , Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell) , and Grandpa George (David Morris). Ealry in the movie, we learn that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) decided top open his own Chocolate Factory, after he leaves home, and he hires workers, and then spies, come in dressed as workers, to steal Willy Wonka's secret recpies. And that leads Willy Wonka to annouce that he is closing his Chocolate Factory, and he looks the gate, and all the workers inclduing Grandpa Joe out of a job. But then the Factory starts up again full blast, but the gates stayed locked at the factory, so nobody can steal his secret repies, and the good question is who is helping Mr. Wonka work the factory? But then Mr. Wonka makes a sudden annoucement, he plans to open his factory to 5 children, and take them on a tour himself of the Chocolate Factory.

For, make no mistake, Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic novel, is very ""Burton-esque."" The crazy visuals and wacky characters abound. Depp's performance is kinda rediculous, though there are moments where he's funny. The kids, however, are very good. They are the star of the film, in my opinion. Freddie Highmore gives the best performance of the film as Charlie, and his portrayal of the character is the only thing that is better than ""Willie Wonka,"" as he doesn't whine and complain like Peter Ostrum.The funniest scene in the movie is the TV-Room. If you, like me, are a fan of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" then you'll be dying lauging at this part.Despite Burton's freaky visual style and Depp's ludicrous performance, kids and parents will find much to appreciate in this film.

He should have had more collaborators.The first Willy Wonka is a work of great originality and beauty with music and presentation that is warm and hopeful.  Burton's feels a like a clunky model of a film.  For example, the grandfather lacked warmth.. Depp's Wonka is a bit creepy despite his considerable charm, and the film's tribute to imaginative childhood delight feels muted and unfocused.The film does have Burton's dreamlike aura of fable which is always enjoyable, but it seemed to lack impact and direction.  The weird little Oompa-Loompas were curious, but unlike in 1972 they weren't wise or all-knowing. Here nobody is especially wise - Wonka is an eccentric oddball.. so instead of a delivery of wisdom from Wonka to Charlie it's really the opposite, with Charlie giving direction to a drifting and immature Wonka.Charlie Bucket again shines as someone who makes the humanist choice for his family over a potential sellout for wealth, but it's less clear than the sublot in the older version.Moreover since Charlie was noble at the beginning of the film already, his virtue was never in question, and without Charlie's inner struggle and transformation the movie really had less to say.  Willy Wonka transforms instead.  He loves his father and reconnects to his family..that's nice..  It's a different theme for a different film.  It may be more true to Dahl's book, but I prefer the other version.Oh well. Hopefully the older film will be adapted to make a run on Broadway and Burton will recognize his limitations and let others carry the ball for his next project.It's worth noting: Little Veruca Salt will soon be a child star.",3,Genius in the distance - Not in the foreground.,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,1714,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'may', 'be', 'visionary', 'genius', ""n't"", 'renaissance', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'collaborators.The', 'first', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'work', 'great', 'originality', 'beauty', 'music', 'presentation', 'warm', 'hopeful', 'Burton', 'feels', 'clunky', 'model', 'film', 'example', 'grandfather', 'lacked', 'warmth..', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'bit', 'creepy', 'considerable', 'charm', 'film', 'tribute', 'imaginative', 'childhood', 'delight', 'feels', 'muted', 'unfocused.The', 'film', 'have', 'Burton', 'dreamlike', 'aura', 'fable', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'seemed', 'lack', 'impact', 'direction', 'weird', 'little', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'were', 'curious', '1972', 'were', ""n't"", 'wise', 'all-knowing', 'Here', 'nobody', 'especially', 'wise', 'Wonka', 'eccentric', 'oddball..', 'so', 'instead', 'delivery', 'wisdom', 'Wonka', 'Charlie', 'really', 'opposite', 'Charlie', 'giving', 'direction', 'drifting', 'immature', 'Wonka.Charlie', 'Bucket', 'again', 'someone', 'who', 'humanist', 'choice', 'family', 'potential', 'sellout', 'wealth', 'less', 'clear', 'sublot', 'older', 'version.Moreover', 'Charlie', 'was', 'noble', 'beginning', 'film', 'already', 'virtue', 'was', 'never', 'question', 'Charlie', 'inner', 'struggle', 'transformation', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'less', 'say', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'transforms', 'instead', 'father', 'family..that', 'nice..', 'different', 'theme', 'different', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'true', 'Dahl', 'book', 'prefer', 'other', 'version.Oh', 'well', 'Hopefully', 'older', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'adapted', 'make', 'run', 'Broadway', 'Burton', 'will', 'recognize', 'limitations', 'let', 'others', 'carry', 'ball', 'next', 'project.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'Little', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'child', 'star']",N/A

Michael Jackson! And so, added into the story are all sorts of clumsy flashbacks to Willie's childhood, and allow Willie to reconcile with his father (Christopher Lee, harkening back to Burton's treatment of Edward Scissorhands and another icon from old horror films, Vincent Price - hey, Burton and Depp aren't creative geniuses, they're self-plagiarizers!).

Lacking memorable songs, heartwarming characters, and other candies besides chocolate, this remake falls flat on its face.I preferred Gene Wilder's warm-hearted and child-wise Wonka to Depp's deeply disturbed chocolate prodigy. In the original, there was more respect and affection between Willy and Charlie.  In the new version, the relationship seemed more superficial, needing Charlie to get Willy out of his shell. Why should a child have that responsibility?Also, I am sick of issues of origin in movies. Why is Willy Wonka the way he is? Why not leave it up to the viewer's sweet imagination? We don't need flashbacks of Willy's terrorized childhood victimization by Christopher Lee. Chalk a couple of those scenes up to a bad dream instead.While Tim Burton is a talented, original, and imaginative director, he needs to put more substance behind his stories and characters. They come across as one-dimensional and jokey. He needs to balance his gothic leanings with some true-to-life realism. Why not have a boring, white-bread, average Joe who has a soft side for lizards and turtles? How about a wrong- side-of-the-tracks guy clad in black leather, who, just may be guilty of sacrificing children to his favorite Aztec god?I love outsider and misfit flicks just as much as the next goth, but, once in a while, let's mix it up a bit.

939223,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000BB1MHS,Terry Mesnard,"[2, 3]","As I'm sure you have heard before, this is not a remake.  True, a movie was made in the past with the great Gene Wilder, but this movie hearkens more truthfully to the children's novel.  It pulls a much darker tone and mood from the sugary 1970s version.  And I think Tim Burton did a great job creating a different version that is in no way connected to the ""original movie"" (though I do think that this one is much much better).Burton and Depp are back at it, pulling out incredibly strange and creative visions from the depths of their minds.  For Burton, the landscapes take the best of his movies and stand as genius in terms of presentation.  Once we get to see inside the Chocolate Factory, we are with Charlie at once amazed and excited.  Imagine actually seeing rivers of chocolate.  It brings back childhood memories where our imaginations were huge and not limited by the harsh realities of life.  Burton is incredibly adept at tapping into this inner-child to create images that as adults we might scoff at or think strange.  Most people fall into two camps in relation to Burton:  he's either incredibly weird or incredibly brilliant.  I fall into the latter category and applaud his rich visual style, especially in this movie.Then there's Depp, the actor who has once again created a unique character.  Depp's man-child Wonka will, for good or bad, remind people of yet another man-child in our society.  On the surface, we have Wonka who creates candies for children, allows 5 of them to enter his ""Neverland"" of chocolate, and yet has an apparent sour core.  He has a clear distaste for children and seems to take glee in the various ways they are kicked from his factory.  It's lucky that he allows a parental figure to go with each of the 5 children.  Yet his character who has this apparent disdain for children, also has a huge heart.  And it is through Charlie that Wonka will finally show his heart and face his own fears.The music is also, of course, fantastic.  Danny Elfman proves once again that he is a strong composer of exciting and different music.  He has been getting a name for himself recently, what with his continual work with Tim Burton but also in doing music for Spiderman 1 and 2.  His music, however, always works best in my opinion with Burton's style and here it helps accentuate it.Your eyes will not be bored.  Many splendors are seen in the 2 hour block.  From the great Oompa-Loompas who no longer annoy me(and are played by one actor who is digitally duplicated), to the great Glass Elevator and the aforementioned rivers of chocolate, to even the slight homage to Stanley Kubrick's opus 2001, the movie is a visual delight.  It is also pretty faithful to the novel.  Overall, this story was great when I read it as a child and it's nice to see it pretty faithfully interpreted in a movie.

939229,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B000BB1MHS,The Patriarch,"[0, 1]","Anyone that's read my Wonka review knows I'm a fan of that movie. Unless you have no sense of humor, take any critique literally, and are immediately offended that is. Being a fan of Wonka, I was made physically ill to find that it had been remade. Remakes are a certain trend in Hollywood made possible by the fact that Hollywood is: 1. Concerned only about money, 2. unwilling to take chances, and 3. now lacking in any talent. I approached the Wonka remake with the same disgust that I have for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the Hills have Eyes, and the same way I would approach the remake of Gone with the Wind and Casablanca.We begin this movie with a CG opening because Hollywood is also now obsessed with computer animation. Mainly because it takes out all the work that real animation requires and gives jobs to untalented computer nerds who couldn't draw themselves out of a paper bag.We are then introduced to this film's Charlie Bucket. While the original Charlie was a good looking young chap that was probably pretty cool in real life, this Charlie is a ghastly, mouse-like, gangly, nerd in training, who, in real life, will only know the touch of women who want to ""Make it with that kid from the Wonka movie."" Upon seeing the interior of Charlie's house I get the inclination that this may not just be a remake of the previous Wonka, but downright plagiarism!Just as things are getting started, we're interrupted with some lame story about Wonka building a chocolate Taj Mahal for some Indian prince. Not only is this story long winded and silly, but it quite frankly is racist. It portrays Indians negatively as dullards that don't realize the chocolate will melt. It makes fun of their culture by a drip of chocolate falling on the prince's forehead, as if it were a tika mark. It then shows melting statues of Ganish and Shiva. Thanks for making fun of Hinduism Tim Burton. This story is but one section of a long flashback sequence, unnecessarily narrated by Grandpa. I could bring up the fact that good movies show instead of tell, but what would be the point?The first act drags on as it shows Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Why? Everyone that got a ticket was a white European or American. Maybe next time Wonka should avoid putting all the winning bars in the same box.The first winner, of course, is Augustus Gloop. Unlike the original Gloop, this one cannot act, and neither can his parents. This scene is painful to watch. It shows him eating a chocolate bar for a full minute while he reads off some cue card for the voice over. ""I...am...eating a chocolate bar...and...I taste something...that does not...taste familiar.""The next winner, Veruca Salt, suffers even more so than Gloop. She is gangly, has a horrible put-upon smile, and fails to be the slightest bit intimidating. Her idea of being pushy is yelling, politely, ""Where's my golden ticket? I want my golden ticket,"" certainly a far-cry from the original. (pardon the pun.)Winner #3 is Violet Beauregard, now a violent, bobbed tomboy. She says she gave up gum to find the golden ticket but then immediately claims she's been chewing the same piece of gum for three months. I guess her vice is lying? Winner #4 is Mike Teevee, who's vice, you'd think would be watching too much TV. In this version, it's kid of unclear. I guess he plays too many violent video games.Charlie of course gets the final Golden Ticket, but unlike the original film, Charlie gets the ticket in a candy bar he buys for himself. In the original the ticket was found in the bar he bought for his grandfather, therefore a good deed was rewarded.When the big day comes the kids enter the factory where they are greeted by some stupid singing automatons. Their song is long, uninspired, banal, nasally, and just plain annoying. Then Wonka shows up, unlike Gene Wilder's Wonka, Depp looks like Elton John on a bad day. Wonka's wit, along with the other forced humor in this film is atrociously unfunny, especially when juxtaposed with its original forbearer. Not to mention this newly-lisping Wonka is kind of scary, he's like the Michael Jackson of the candy world if you think of it. I assume they cut the scene where Wonka invites the children to spend the night. He even tells the kids that he's ""eatable."" This is just sick, Burton.The story is once again interrupted by some 5 minute story about how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas. Once again, the story is highly racist. It involves the Loompas being a jungle people that, ""are good workers,"" and worship cocoa beans.The demise of each of these children is much more horrific and realistic than in the original. While you could chuckle at them before, can you laugh at these kids as they moan and scream in agony? I hope not. Likewise, while the people in the original movie had their faults, they were still likable. There's no redeeming factor in any of them this time, they all come across as axxholes that go around criticizing one another.During Veruca's scene when she tries to take one of Wonka's squirrels he exclaims, ""Little girl, don't touch that squirrel's nuts, it'll make him crazy!"" I'm not joking, he really says this, maybe Burton forgot he was making a kids movie, or perhaps he's just a moron that could care less about exposing children to sexual metaphors. Go to HeII, Burton. Soon a pack of rabid squirrels fall upon Veruca and attacks her. They gruesomely bite at her in what looks like a scene from Willard, or one of Richard Gear's fantasies, take your pick.Long story short: I wish; this thing just drags on and on. They tack on like an extra 20 minutes after the movie is supposed to be over! And there is this new, stupid, ridiculous ending that ruins the entire meaning and moral of the original. There is no reason to watch this film, trust me. Why eat imitation chocolate when you can have the real thing?",5,"""This city will be chocolate again!""",1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,5863,"['Anyone', 'read', 'Wonka', 'review', ""'m"", 'fan',

The movie ""Charile and The Chocoalte Factory"" is actually a movie version of the book...with a few things added or altred. In the book there were actually flashbacks to Wonka's childhood just like there are in the movie. Though the book never really talked about his father. There was only one line in the book about his father. Having said this....this movie is excelnt I loved it for two main reasons ...one: Tim Burton directed it...I love Tim Burton. And two...Johnny Depp was in it..Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. I also loved well...everything else about it. If you haven't seen this movie yet I suggest you watch it. You don't have to buy it...but just at least watch it..and then make up your mind about what you think of it. For me it was just a delightful adventure through a chocoalte factory. And another chance to experaince Tim Burton's vision of something I had loved before. Johnny Depp's acting was amazing in this movie..he had me laughing all the way through.

939231,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BB1MHS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[6, 7]","There is something intrinsically magical about Roald Dahl's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". The story of Charlie Bucket, a little boy who lives with his dirt poor family in a shack near the famous Wonka Chocolate Factory, Charlie is lucky enough to win one of five golden tickets offered by Willy Wonka for a one-time visit to tour his amazing factory. Each of the other four children is the very embodiment of a problem common to young people; Augustus Gloop is a greedy kid who eats all the candy and chocolate he can get his hands on, Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat who gets everything she wants, Violet Beauregard is a little know-it-all who simply has to be best and Mike Teavee is obsessed with all things television. And then there is Charlie. Charlie is so poor that he doesn't want anything that he doesn't already have, and all he has is the love of his family. Arriving at the factory, the five children and their parents, meet Willy Wonka, the eccentric, strange chocolatier, and their lives will be changed forever.That we all know from the book, which I will venture to put forth, may be the best children's book of all time.Previously made into a film in 1971, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" stars Gene Wilder as the strange man who lives in a large factory populated by pygmies. The film is well - remembered for its fanciful, day glow renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Wilder's tour de force performance and the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.Tim Burton's new film, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", starring Johnny Depp as Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie (both in ""Finding Neverland"") will also be remembered for it's fanciful, vivid renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Depp's tour de force performance (for both good and bad) and all of the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.They sound similar, don't they? Yes. I wouldn't classify ""Willy Wonka"" as a classic, it's more of a cult classic. And Burton's version is very good, but not great. The major improvement between the two is the improved production design.Depp's performance is good. Wonka is a strange guy and Depp seems to be channeling the spirit of Michael Jackson for the role, which is actually more than a little fitting. Both characters were deprived of a childhood and now spend every moment of their adult lives trying to recapture it. I wonder if Jackson will consider the performance a compliment or an insult. Like Michael Jackson isn't going to see the film?Wonka's bobbed hair, porcelain face which never seems to age and odd clothing give him a slightly effeminate look. Depp uses this as the first step in recreating the role. As Wonka, Depp imbues the character with a childlike sensibility and vocal pattern. As he speaks with his five invited guests, he seems most comfortable when they are acting like children. This also means that he is most comfortable around Charlie, because Charlie hasn't had had the influences the other kids have had. When they aren't acting like kids, he becomes bratty, belligerent and confused.Freddie Highmore is the real standout of the film. He seems to completely get the character of Charlie; despite the odds of finding one of five golden tickets, throughout the world, he still holds out hope. Even as glimmers of hope cross his face, we also see that he realizes the odds are pretty great. All of this is conveyed just through his facial expressions.The other four children are purposely one-dimensional and meant to convey four of the bad traits children can develop if left unchecked. All are portrayed well and serve to make the characters funny and amusing.Charlie's family is the counterpoint to the bad children's parents. Living in a one -room shack that appears it will blow over, the family subsists on a diet of cabbage soup but the important thing is that they have each other's love, which helps them get through. Mom (Helena Bonham Carter, with a dental prosthetic) and Dad (Noah Taylor) care for their parents, all four of which spend every day in one bed. Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) and the other three grandparents provide Charlie with the love and support he needs. All of this helps Charlie become a pretty fantastic kid. He uses the bad toothpaste caps his father brings home from the toothpaste factory to create a replica of Wonka's factory, keeping the dream alive.Once we enter the factory, Burton recreates the journey with vivid colors and designs. The main room they enter, with the chocolate river, is surprisingly similar to the same set in the first film. The addition of more advanced special effects adds another layer to the setting, but really, they are the same.There are a few differences between the two versions. In ""Charlie"", Burton and screenwriter John August (""Big Fish"") have added a back-story for Wonka. This is an interesting and well done touch. Through a series of memories, we see Wonka's childhood with his father (Christopher Lee), a dentist. These moments retain the fable like quality of the book, helping them seem fully integrated, but they also serve to slow down the story. Later, through stories and further memories, we learn about other points in Wonka's life. For instance, how he met the Oompa Loompas (all are played by Deep Roy). These are equally intriguing and well-done. They also seem a little more generic to the story.But are these additions enough to warrant a new film? Not really. ""Charlie"" is well-made, interesting, and the back story adds another element of depth, but nothing new is done with the core story. For a director with such a vivid imagination, it is disappointing that Burton didn't take it further. Ultimately, ""Charlie"" seems like a stop gap for Burton, until the next big idea hits him.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a very good film, and one of the better films out there for you to take the kids to, but it is ultimately an unnecessary film.",4,3 1/2 Stars - Faithful Remake - To The 1971 Film,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,5957,"['something', 'intrinsically', 'magical', 'Roald',

The commercials for it didn't really 'do it' for me, and as much as I love Johnny Depp, I didn't think he'd be a big enough draw for me either. So, I waited until it was on dvd when my sister bought it, and we watched it.I ended up liking the movie more than I thought I would. However, in many respects, I still prefer the old version, maybe because it's what I grew up watching, so it holds a special place for me.This new version parallels the old in many respects, and then of course, it doesn't. It's very obviously a Tim Burton movie. Anyone familiar with his work would notice that right from the onset. This version has oompa loompa songs, but they aren't anything like in the old version, except for the particular kid being sung about. These songs were just ok and aren't songs that would stick in your mind, like the older songs did.Instead of the scene with the golden geese, there are squirrels. I wasn't too keen on that part. It was a little creepy to see a ton of squirrels all over the place, and especially creepy when they carried someone off. I don't mind squirrels as a general rule, but that many all together was strange.Also in this version, you learn more about Willy Wonka as a child, and get a glimpse into how he turned out to be such an odd character. His father was a dentist. Well, what better way to rot children's teeth than to start your own candy empire? So, that's what Wonka did, in antithesis of his father's life's work.There are certainly more differences in this version, but those are the few that stood out for me the most. As far as Wonka's go, Johnny Depp's version didn't annoy me as much as I thought he would, and was in fact kind of funny. But, I still prefer Gene Wilder's interpretation. He was just the right blend of an eccentric, slightly mad, smart aleck who still managed to be loveable in spite of being a nut.",4,"Strike that, reverse it",1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,1954,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'theaters', 'commercials', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', ""'do"", 'as', 'much', 'love', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'draw', 'So', 'waited', 'was', 'dvd', 'when', 'sister', 'bought', 'watched', 'it.I', 'ended', 'up', 'liking', 'movie', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'However', 'many', 'respects', 'still', 'prefer', 'old', 'version', 'maybe', 'what', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'special', 'place', 'me.This', 'new', 'version', 'old', 'many', 'respects', 'then', 'course', ""n't"", 'very', 'obviously', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movie', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'work', 'would', 'notice', 'right', 'onset', 'version', 'oompa', 'loompa', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'old', 'version', 'particular', 'kid', 'being', 'sung', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'ok', 'are', ""n't"", 'songs', 'would', 'stick', 'mind', 'older', 'songs', 'did.Instead', 'scene', 'golden', 'geese', 'are', 'squirrels', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'keen', 'part', 'was', 'little', 'creepy', 'see', 'ton', 'squirrels', 'place', 'especially', 'creepy', 'when', 'carried', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'squirrels', 'general', 'rule', 'many', 'together', 'was', 'strange.Also', 'version', 'learn', 'more', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'child', 'get', 'glimpse', 'how', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'such', 'odd', 'character', 'father', 'was', 'dentist', 'Well', 'what', 'better', 'way', 'rot', 'children', 'teeth', 'start', 'own', 'candy', 'empire', 'So', 'what', 'Wonka', 'did', 'antithesis', 'father', 'life', 'are', 'certainly', 'more', 'differences', 'version', 'are', 'few', 'stood', 'out', 'most', 'As', 'far', 'Wonka', 'go', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'was', 'fact', 'kind', 'funny', 'still', 'prefer', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'interpretation', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'eccentric', 'slightly', 'mad', 'smart', 'aleck', 'who', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'loveable', 'spite', 'being', 'nut']",N/A

Charlie's lopsided little house bespoke his poverty, yet also accurately represented his close-knit, but delightfully off-kilter family.One of the best parts of the movie was the characterization of Charlie and his relationship with his grandfather. Charlie's poor, but caring family contrasts sharply with Willy's childhood with his father.  As mentioned in a previous review, Johnny Depp DOES look like he is channeling Michael Jackson.  It is almost eerie. However, he makes an effective Willy Wonka and the scenes of his early life with his father, the dentist, certainly explain his eccentric behavior.

I had heard a lot of grumblings about the new movie, how people were stunned at how different it was from the original. After seeing it though, I can say this is a much better movie than the original. First, it is much closer to the book (which was the original source material for the first movie) in content and ""feel"". Second, while Gene Wilder was AWESOME in the first one, Johnny Depp plays an amazing and complicated Willy Wonka (Depp has to be one of the greatest actors of our generation, even though I am no fan of his personal opinions). While I have heard people complain that this Willy Wonka is a weirdo, folks, THATS THE WHOLE POINT. He's SUPPOSED to be! It makes perfect sense in the story. BRILLIANT acting by Depp.Lets move on to the Oompa Loompas. I have heard complaints that its all the same guy and the songs suck. I totally disagree. While the original Oompas were cool as hell, these Oompas are just as great, and I think the 'look-alike' aspect of theses Oompas added a lot to the whole movie. The dancing choreography was pretty great too. The songs DO NOT suck, they actually are quite entertaining, its just that people love the originals so much they don't give the new ones a fair shake. I thoroughly enjoyed the song and dance sequences.My final thoughts are on Tim Burton. I never really got why people like him, as most of his movies are REALLY BAD. Edward Scissorhands was good, but most of his others aren't. I can say that this movie is Burton's best of all. He does quite a good job with the direction, and even his signature dark and quirky sets work wonderfully in this one.This movie doesn't replace the original, it actually goes hand-in-hand with it. They are companion pieces, different takes on the same source material.

Yes, I know, this is a Tim Burton film, in which being weird means quirky type of charms, but for all its considerable merits, I was not charmed by the film.You don't need the long summery of the story. In short, good boy Charlie Bucket and other four bad kids are invited to the magical factory of one Willy Wonka. For bad kids only, the factory turns a horrible place, where they must learn a lesson in a fairly terrifying way. Rather cruel edge of the original remains in the film, and that part actually is the point of the film, when the preachy moral is told in a well-rehearsed musical style. You may hate this, but still can find it more tolerable than Depp and his acting, which, unlike `Finding Neverland,' would not bring him another Oscar nomination.Too bad, but it's true. The acting of Johnny Depp, and the unnecessary subplot about Mr. Wonka are the worst part of the film. The unfortunate comparison with Michael Jackson is understandable if you just watch him. Even if the avid fans of Depp can ignore the uncanny resemblance between Jackson and Depp wearing sunglasses, they would certainly admit that his acting here is misguided, always - yes, always - relying on curious mannerism. He is constantly weird, and to make matters much worse, seems not conscious of what he is doing.To remedy the alarming amount of weirdness, Tim Burton added the father-son relation between Wonka and his father, stern dentist played his favorite actor Christopher Lee. That only makes the whole story unnecessarily longer and more sentimental. After so much of Depp's bizarre acting, it is too late for anyone to correct the image of the eccentric factory owner, and make him look more like a human. Better acting would do.Ironically, the film is much better when it doesn't show Wonka in it. The house of the Buckets, slanted in a crazy way, shows what Tim Burton can do with better and level-headed judgment, and the entire household is charmingly described. David Kelly provides a delightful portrait of a wise old man in the family, with a little bit of craziness hidden in his eyes.For all its wonderful designs and good Danny Elfman score, I couldn't help thinking about this. As many have already pointed out about this film, Depp's Wonka repeatedly betrays his dislike of being addressed to by the children while he can talk pretty normally (though drily) with adults. So why should he invite these kids to the factory? Or why should all the kids dream about going to his factory in the first place? I talked about weird things about the film - Michael Jackson theory and so on - but this is the weirdest part of the film, which I am still trying to figure out.",3,Very Weird (Especially Depp's Acting) And Too Weird For Its Own Good,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,2800,"['Weird', 'creepy', 'strange', 'was', 'exactly', 'words', 'came', 'mind', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Yes', 'know', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'being', 'weird', 'means', 'quirky', 'type', 'charms', 'considerable', 'merits', 'was', 'not', 'charmed', 'film.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'long', 'summery', 'story', 'short', 'good', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'other', 'four', 'bad', 'kids', 'are', 'invited', 'magical', 'factory', 'one', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'bad', 'kids', 'only', 'factory', 'horrible', 'place', 'where', 'must', 'learn', 'lesson', 'fairly', 'terrifying', 'way', 'cruel', 'edge', 'original', 'remains', 'film', 'part', 'actually', 'point', 'film', 'when', 'preachy', 'moral', 'told', 'well-rehearsed', 'musical', 'style', 'may', 'hate', 'still', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'tolerable', 'Depp', 'acting', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'would', 'not', 'bring', 'Oscar', 'nomination.Too', 'bad', 'true', 'acting', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'unnecessary', 'subplot', 'Mr.', 'Wonka', 'are', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'comparison', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'understandable', 'just', 'watch', 'Even', 'avid', 'fans', 'Depp', 'can', 'ignore', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Jackson', 'Depp', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'would', 'certainly', 'admit', 'acting', 'here', 'misguided', 'always', 'yes', 'always', 'relying', 'curious', 'mannerism', 'constantly', 'weird', 'make', 'matters', 'much', 'worse', 'not', 'conscious', 'what', 'doing.To', 'remedy', 'alarming', 'amount', 'weirdness', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'added', 'father-son', 'relation', 'Wonka', 'father', 'stern', 'dentist', 'played', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'only', 'whole', 'story', 'unnecessarily', 'longer', 'more', 'sentimental', 'so', 'much', 'Depp', 'bizarre', 'acting', 'too', 'late', 'anyone', 'correct', 'image', 'eccentric', 'factory', 'owner', 'make', 'look', 'more', 'human', 'Better', 'acting', 'would', 'do.Ironically', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'when', ""n't"", 'show', 'Wonka', 'house', 'Buckets', 'slanted', 'crazy', 'way', 'what', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'level-headed', 'judgment', 'entire', 'household', 'charmingly', 'described', 'David', 'Kelly', 'delightful', 'portrait', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'family', 'little', 'bit', 'craziness', 'hidden', 'eyes.For', 'wonderful', 'designs', 'good', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'Depp', 'Wonka', 'repeatedly', 'dislike', 'being', 'addressed', 'children', 'can', 'talk', 'pretty', 'normally', 'drily', 'adults', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'invite', 'kids', 'factory', 'why', 'should', 'all', 'kids', 'dream', 'going', 'factory', 'first', 'place', 'talked', 'weird', 'things', 'film', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'theory', 'so', 'weirdest', 'part', 'film', 'am', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out']",N/A
939241,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000BB1MHS,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 5]","When WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was released in 1971, Ronald Dahl, the author who wrote the original story, was horrified. The filmmakers had taken Dahl's script (based on his own story) and butchered it to pieces under the writing revisions of David Seltzer. In fact, Dahl was so upset that he never allowed the studio to make a planned sequel that was to be loosely based upon CHARLIE AND THE GLASS ELEVATOR.  Fast forward a little over 30 years to a Hollywood that has lost all creative juices and is in a makeover frenzy. Warner Brothers hasn't had very many family hits in awhile and family films are bringing in more moolah than ever before.  So, why not remake CHARLIE? Kids who grew up with the original are full of nostalgia now and will see it with their own children. Put Tim Burton at the helm to direct because he's the only director who's crazy enough to get the okay from the Dahl estate and you've got an instant success on your hands.CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a quite different movie from WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Just look at the title of the two films for starters. Whereas WILLY was drenched in this fairy-tale optimism detached from reality (and from much of Dahl's original story), CHARLIE is full of the dark humor characteristic of everyday life (and of Dahl's original story).The plot of the film is rather familiar.  World-renown, but never-seen candy-maker, Willy Wonka makes it known that he is going to open his factory to 5 lucky children who can find a Golden Ticket. Through some coincidences (or Providence), Charlie Bucket finds one of the tickets. He and his grandpa and the other 4 children and their adult guardians are given a tour of Willy Wonka's wonderful factory. But one by one, the children fall to the vices they are most prey.  Until only Charlie is left. As the last child remaining, Charlie wins a very special prize, but one that comes with a price that Charlie isn't worth paying. But in the end, it all turns out fine.Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka. His portrayal is quite different from Gene Wilder's, but full of the suspect-sinister that Dahl's story version contains.  Freddie Highmore portrays Charlie and this youngster has Oscar written all over him; one shouldn't be surprised if he takes an Award by the time he's 15 (Haley Joel Osmont hasn't got a thing on Highmore).  The other actors do a fine job, though I especially enjoyed Miss Pyle portraying Mrs. Beauregarde--she brings the character to life, making her a woman to die for. Other performance of note is that of Deep Roy. This little Indian portrays all of the Oompa Loompas and despite CGI effects, actually portrayed each one of the 150+ tiny humans (he also received a nice million dollar salary for his work).Musically, this version of the story is quite different than the 1971.  The songs include Dahl's original lyrics and each song is written in a different genre of music, from pop to rock to reggae to country. Instead of the repetition that the 1971's songs, this approach provides a different tone and thus signifying a different lesson for each of the incidents they follow.Overall, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a delightful romp through imagination. The youngest of viewers might be frightened by some of the images (but like the original fairy tales, they should be) and fans of the 1971 movie might be prejudiced by the new take.

But it wasn't the book. After seeing Burton's version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", I realized he actually understands the book. This version is very close to Dahl's. The big change is in how Willy Wonka is presented. Willy Wonka in the book does really strange things (they become stranger in ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"") with seemingly no motivation, but Burton softened him by giving him an unbending father that sort of explains his actions. Johnny Depp captured Wonka's eccentricities perfectly. Freddie Highmore as Charlie was very good.I love how the music incorporated the poems Dahl wrote for each of the ""naughty"" children, and the dark tone of the music itself. The movie opening credits was fantastic. Although the special effects were fantastic, they never overwhelmed the story, but gave it more of that fairytale feel. The Oompa-Loompas were funny and a little scary at times. Burton got it that Dahl's books can be dark and frightening because children are thrown into some truly horrific and surrealistic situations, but in the end the kids always adapt and triumph.The Two-Disc Deluxe Edition is wonderful with really good Special Features. I absolutely loved the featurette on Roald Dahl's life that had footage of him, his books and his family. I also have a great appreciation of Deep Roy who played all of the Oompa-Loompas after seeing what he had to do!Another really good movie adaptation of a Dahl book is Danny DeVito's ""Matilda""Matilda (Special Edition)This is my favorite movie adaptation of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".",5,"Tim Burton Understands Dahl's Book, Great Movie",1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,1710,"['Having', 'seen', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'television', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'sets', 'were', 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'seeing', 'Burton', 'version', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'realized', 'actually', 'book', 'version', 'very', 'close', 'Dahl', 'big', 'change', 'how', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'presented', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'book', 'really', 'strange', 'things', 'become', 'stranger', 'Charlie', 'Great', 'Glass', 'Elevator', 'seemingly', 'motivation', 'Burton', 'softened', 'giving', 'unbending', 'father', 'sort', 'explains', 'actions', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'captured', 'Wonka', 'eccentricities', 'perfectly', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'was', 'very', 'good.I', 'love', 'how', 'music', 'incorporated', 'poems', 'Dahl', 'wrote', 'naughty', 'children', 'dark', 'tone', 'music', 'movie', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'fantastic', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'fantastic', 'never', 'overwhelmed', 'story', 'gave', 'more', 'fairytale', 'feel', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'were', 'funny', 'little', 'scary', 'times', 'Burton', 'got', 'Dahl', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'dark', 'frightening', 'children', 'are', 'thrown', 'truly', 'horrific', 'surrealistic', 'situations', 'end', 'kids', 'always', 'adapt', 'triumph.The', 'Two-Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'wonderful', 'really', 'good', 'Special', 'Features', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'featurette', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'life', 'had', 'footage', 'books', 'family', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'appreciation', 'Deep', 'Roy', 'who', 'played', 'Oompa-Loompas', 'seeing', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Dahl', 'book', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Matilda', 'Matilda', 'Special', 'Edition', 'favorite', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory']",N/A

This version is one that I'm sure Roald Dahl would be proud of. And FORGET all the stupid people who are saying that Johnny Depp is just like Michael Jackson in this film, because it is just NOT TRUE.Depp is an absolutely fabulous actor, with more talent than he can cope with. His portrayal of the wacky Willy Wonka (alliteration rules!) is perfect. And though he is known to look a little strange in this film, it just accentuates how good-looking he is. So no more Jacko comparisons please....Freddy Highmore I would say is not an extremely good Charlie Bucket, as I found his performance a little wooden. However, this is side-lined by the other performances. Depp's is obviously the stand-out one, with every line delivered with perfection, and each line basically a fantastically funny one-liner. But Violet Beauregarde is extremely enjoyable to watch, with her over-competitiveness and hard-core attitude. Veruca Salt is as rude, snobbish and bossy as she is supposed to be, and Agustus Gloop is amusing to watch (who would have known it would be a German boy to play him? ^_^) The movie in itself is extremely funny to watch; I laughed both times that I went to see it!And the Oompa Loompa's are fantastic, accompanied by the wonderous song arrangements by Danny Elfman, one of the best movie soundtrack composers ever to walk this earth (see ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Simpsons"" theme tune fore proof).In conclusion, this is one of the best children's movies you could EVER watch, and should be bought as soon as possible.",5,This movie deserves 100 stars!,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,1632,"['What', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'title', 'review', 'FORGET', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'version', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'FORGET', 'stupid', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'just', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'film', 'just', 'NOT', 'TRUE.Depp', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'actor', 'more', 'talent', 'can', 'cope', 'portrayal', 'wacky', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'alliteration', 'rules', 'perfect', 'known', 'look', 'little', 'strange', 'film', 'just', 'how', 'good-looking', 'So', 'no', 'more', 'Jacko', 'comparisons', 'please', 'Highmore', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'extremely', 'good', 'Charlie', 'Bucket', 'found', 'performance', 'little', 'wooden', 'However', 'side-lined', 'other', 'performances', 'Depp', 'obviously', 'stand-out', 'one', 'line', 'delivered', 'perfection', 'line', 'basically', 'fantastically', 'funny', 'one-liner', 'Violet', 'Beauregarde', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'over-competitiveness', 'hard-core', 'attitude', 'Veruca', 'Salt', 'rude', 'snobbish', 'bossy', 'supposed', 'be', 'Agustus', 'Gloop', 'amusing', 'watch', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'be', 'German', 'boy', 'play', '^_^', 'movie', 'extremely', 'funny', 'watch', 'laughed', 'times', 'went', 'see', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'are', 'fantastic', 'accompanied', 'wonderous', 'song', 'arrangements', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'one', 'best', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'composers', 'ever', 'walk', 'earth', 'see', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Simpsons', 'theme', 'tune', 'fore', 'proof', 'conclusion', 'one', 'best', 'children', 'movies', 'could', 'EVER', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'bought', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A

It was wonderful to see things from the book in the film, like the squirrels, musical numbers, and even little things like having charlie's father actually alive.But to me, the big thing that could make or break the movie was the casting of Wonka, and there are dozens of actors I would have chosen over Depp, and it is painfully obvious that this was just an excuse to cash in on depp's popularity. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ITS LIKE HE'S A STRANGER IN HIS OWN FACTORY! It's like he was visiting there for the first time, and just happened to the be the tourist of the group carrying the map, wandering around aimlessly.Neither Depp nor Wilder hit the character right on, but Wilder had that spring in his step, that twinkle in his eye that showed that he knew what was going on, and was in control at all times. The kids were horrendous compared to the eccentric, wonderfully terrible brats of the original. Charlie wasn't bad, and I'm happy to say he was very well cast, and I enjoyed him.The badly placed backstory and inclusion of Christopher Lee (whom I love) was pointless, and changed the message of the story from ""good things work out for those who are good"" to ""family is most important"". WHICH DONT GET ME WRONG, IS A GOOD MESSAGE, but not what I wanted from a story I loved. It ruined the point of them being in the factory and everything, and only worked to make Depp more pedophile-like. As another reviewer said, Burton wanted to be more faithful to the source material? Well, way to add in an entirely usless subplot that changed the entire message, Tim!Visually, it was stunning, as all Burton films are, and the score was creepy and marvelous, brought to us once again by the peerless Danny Elfman. Depp lost his appeal to me a while ago, and this was just salt on the wound, to watch him try to tackle a role that I loved and cherished.

939250,AUTBHG6070SL4,B000BB1MHS,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[2, 2]","Wow. This movie seems to go in all directions at once.First, there's the nominal kids' movie. Lots of color, no real violence, occasional and amusing bits of song, and a proper moral tone about the value of family, money, and good behavior. Then there's Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp's) bizarre character, ambiguous in his liking for the kids he invites, and gleeful in the self-inflicted weirdness that four of the five children experience. For the grown-up dragged along, there are witty references to bunches of other movies, including Kubrick's 2001, Sweet Haven architecture from Robin Williams' ""Popeye"", Edward Scissorhands, 1930s-style song-and-dance movies, and I don't know what all else. There's a remarkable echo of the new Hitchhiker's Guide movie, in Wonka's glass elevator, but the release dates of the two movies make intentional reference unlikely. Of course, Tim Burton's mad gadgeteering needs an outlet, which appears in a frightening bit of orthodonture.Some bits may be a bit intense for skittish children, but the sense that ""[s]he had it coming"" generally outweighs any sense of threat. The Oompa Loompa's original diet is a high-grade gross-out, perfect for small boys (but maybe not their mothers).This isn't Disneyfied, sugary pap. It's a lot more interesting than that. It seems to address approachable complexity to young viewers, but still give adults material of interest, something I haven't seen in recent kids' flicks.The kids are optional, though. An adult can enjoy it too.//wiredweird",5,"Brilliant, creepy fun",1121472000,"07 16, 2005",2005,1518,"['Wow', 'movie', 'go', 'directions', 'once.First', 'nominal', 'kids', 'movie', 'Lots', 'color', 'real', 'violence', 'occasional', 'amusing', 'bits', 'song', 'proper', 'moral', 'tone', 'value', 'family', 'money', 'good', 'behavior', 'Then', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'bizarre', 'character', 'ambiguous', 'liking', 'kids', 'gleeful', 'self-inflicted', 'weirdness', 'four', 'five', 'children', 'experience', 'grown-up', 'dragged', 'along', 'are', 'witty', 'references', 'bunches', 'other', 'movies', 'including', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Sweet', 'Haven', 'architecture', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Popeye', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', '1930s-style', 'song-and-dance', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'remarkable', 'echo', 'new', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'movie', 'Wonka', 'glass', 'elevator', 'release', 'dates', 'two', 'movies', 'make', 'intentional', 'reference', 'unlikely', 'course', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'mad', 'gadgeteering', 'outlet', 'frightening', 'bit', 'orthodonture.Some', 'bits', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'intense', 'skittish', 'children', 'sense', '[', 's', ']', 'had', 'coming', 'generally', 'sense', 'threat', 'Oompa', 'Loompa', 'original', 'diet', 'high-grade', 'gross-out', 'perfect', 'small', 'boys', 'maybe', 'not', 'mothers', '.This', ""n't"", 'Disneyfied', 'sugary', 'pap', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'address', 'approachable', 'complexity', 'young', 'viewers', 'still', 'give', 'adults', 'material', 'interest', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'recent', 'kids', 'flicks.The', 'kids', 'are', 'optional', 'though', 'adult', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too.//wiredweird']",N/A

Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? He looked really feminine and mime-like. It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makeup on him! Depp's character had a really awkward and uncomfortable feel (done on purpose but not in a funny way) with bizzare, dead sounding dialogue. The musical numbers were not catchy and there was an odd lack of music through the rest of the movie giving it a really inhuman, unnatural ambiance. I also disliked the one guy playing all the oompa loompas, it looked really fake like a clone attack and did nothing to make the movie more watchable. I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a little kid it's way too dark and scary and has 'humor' that is hard for most people young or old, to understand. I found myself asking, ""Was that supposed to be funny?"" on multiple occasions. The children (other than Charlie, who is underdeveloped) are really mean and bratty to the point of being unwatchable(as if we need more bad examples for kids!) Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. All the actors in this movie are very talented and it's a shame to see that something about this movie just didn't 'click'. This movie was not really about kids, or fun or candy, it was about Tim Burton falling in love with his own work and failing to realize how lame it was. Tim needs to stick with his own original stories (Corpse Bride for example, was great) and I think it shows a huge ego when someone tries to remake a classic movie like this! It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script is hollow and lousy. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. It has a very cold, lifeless feeling to it and had none of the warmth and joy of the original, almost like someone made a bad parody of WW. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, I wasn't entertained in the least and I think this fails as a kids movie and as a grownup movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!",2,Euuuwww......Creepy!,1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,2723,"['movie', 'creeped', 'out', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'awesome', 'actor', 'usually', 'find', 'sexy', 'THIS', 'stinker', 'find', 'really', 'creepy', 'gross', 'Maybe', 'Michael', 'Jackson-ish', 'look', 'going', 'black', 'wig', 'white', 'face', 'Could', 'have', 'picked', 'more', 'horrible', 'look', 'WW', 'looked', 'really', 'feminine', 'mime-like', 'looked', 'took', 'costume', 'store', 'put', '10', 'wig', '5', 'clown', 'makeup', 'Depp', 'character', 'had', 'really', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'feel', 'done', 'purpose', 'not', 'funny', 'way', 'bizzare', 'dead', 'sounding', 'dialogue', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'not', 'catchy', 'was', 'odd', 'lack', 'music', 'rest', 'movie', 'giving', 'really', 'inhuman', 'unnatural', 'ambiance', 'also', 'disliked', 'one', 'guy', 'playing', 'oompa', 'loompas', 'looked', 'really', 'fake', 'clone', 'attack', 'did', 'nothing', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'watchable', 'love', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'sucked', 'BIGTIME', 'new', 'perspective', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Willy', 'someone', 'would', 'keep', 'kids', 'AWAY', 'movie', 'childish', ""'re"", 'adult', 'pales', 'compared', 'original', ""'re"", 'little', 'kid', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'scary', ""'humor"", 'hard', 'most', 'people', 'young', 'old', 'understand', 'found', 'asking', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'children', 'other', 'Charlie', 'who', 'underdeveloped', 'are', 'really', 'mean', 'bratty', 'point', 'being', 'unwatchable', 'need', 'more', 'bad', 'examples', 'kids', 'Maybe', 'am', 'biased', 'loved', 'original', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'open', 'seeing', 'remake', 'was', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'was', 'dissapointing', 'actors', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'shame', 'see', 'something', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", ""'click"", 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'kids', 'fun', 'candy', 'was', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'falling', 'love', 'own', 'work', 'failing', 'realize', 'how', 'lame', 'was', 'Tim', 'stick', 'own', 'original', 'stories', 'Corpse', 'Bride', 'example', 'was', 'great', 'think', 'huge', 'ego', 'when', 'someone', 'remake', 'classic', 'movie', 'amazing', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'effort', 'go', 'special', 'effects', 'expensive', 'sets', 'script', 'hollow', 'lousy', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'had', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'almost', 'sadistic', 'undertones', 'very', 'cold', 'lifeless', 'feeling', 'had', 'none', 'warmth', 'joy', 'original', 'almost', 'someone', 'made', 'bad', 'parody', 'WW', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertained', 'least', 'think', 'kids', 'movie', 'grownup', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'love', 'Depp', 'Burton', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'steaming', 'pile', 'poo']",N/A
939253,AE9GUE3HHOX3U,B000BB1MHS,zooni,"[4, 5]","This a borderline disgrace of the original Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory.  It's as if someone zapped the soul out of every character in this film.  Johnny Depp seemed like he was on vicodin or something.  One minute he was up, the next down.  His character went in and out of personalities.  Most of his jokes fell flat after their delivery, leaving the viewer with an uncomfortable CREEPY feeling.  His character of Willy Wonka was a cross between the church lady from Saturday Night Live and Jack from Will and Grace.  Does that tell you anything? Some of the dialogue was almost identical to the original, the only difference is they edited out all the wittiness that made the original so special.  All of the soul, intellect and attitude were missing from all of the characters portrayal's in this film.  There was an all across the board lack of emotion that resonated like a plague throughout the entire film. Some of the special affects were cute but even the sets seemed to lack the magical quality of the original Willy Wonka.  The musical numbers with the oompa loompas were surreal and did give a campy feel to the movie but overall this is a totally different movie than the original.  It's very difficult to compare the 2 of them but I will say the first one is heartfelt and magical.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a sour imitation, a souless, dour, unfunny tragedy.
