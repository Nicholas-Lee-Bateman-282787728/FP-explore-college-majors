1646739,A2DI9XP5ITS3P,B00CFB6OPM,"Allegrobas ""Allegrobas""","[5, 9]","It's difficult to rate this film because it is not only a movie but a realistic analysis of how Wall Street criminals made billions and trillions cheating the average middle class family. Purcell and Karpluk play the role of a married middle class couple who experience insufferable hardship and pain as their modest financial status quickly takes a severe dive due to the manipulations on Wall Street. This first half of the movie can well be classified as pure drama as the plot concentrates on their suffering. The pace here is slow and the acting is mediocre, but salvaged somewhat by the more colorful characters played by Keith David and Edward Furlong. But the second half, as the title aptly states, is more ""I'll Take My Revenge"" type with Purcell finally coming alive in the macho role he excels at. Special mention goes to John Heard who does a great acting job as an unrepentant Wall Street Big. In my opinion the greatest value of this film is the presentation of facts over how Wall Street, the Big Banks, and the elite class in America suck the blood of working-class people, making trillions of dollars in the process. That the US Government used tax-payer money to bail out these worthless elite criminals is enough to make any regular citizen rejoice when Dominic Purcell, as the husband who has lost everything, goes on a rampage to extract revenge against the high-profile Wall Street vampires.

1646741,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B00CFB6OPM,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[8, 14]","For reasons I cannot fathom, Uwe Boll not only continues to turn out films that insult intelligent people everywhere, but he also has a core fanbase that gobbles them right up. Boll supporters will love his latest steaming pile of manure, Assault on Wall Street, for its gratuitous violence and cliche gimmicks. That is, if they can suffer through an hour of mumbo-jumbo ""Bankster"" dialogue that was clearly written by someone who knows nothing about investing or finance.Let me take a brief moment to say that the acting in this film is actually pretty good, and somewhere deep within the awful script there is the hint of a decent drama about a couple that falls on tough times financially. With that out of the way, let us continue to explore Assault on Wall Street's innumerable failures.As I stated previously, the financial talk during the first hour of the film is practically insufferable. The viewer is introduced to terminology and concepts that simply don't exist. Foreclosures do not happen in a matter of days; lawyers do not force you to make split-second decisions regarding your entire financial future, of which you really know nothing to begin with.And that's the major problem with Assault on Wall Street.The viewer is supposed to feel bad for the lead character (Dominic Purcell) because of all his financial woes, and we are constantly assaulted by anti-Wall Street propaganda, both blatant and subtle, so we know exactly where to direct our anger. Except Purcell's character made the first-grade mistake of putting all his eggs in one basket; it is revealed that he invested his life savings in a single ""guaranteed"" money-making opportunity which very predictably fails. ""Boo Wall Street! Thieves! Monsters!"" Puh-lease. Nobody took advantage of the man; he made a bad investment through an untrustworthy firm, and he paid the price. There's nothing immoral about that. The whole rotten mess is made even more ironic when, late in the film, Purcell's character takes a dig at one of Wall Street's big-wigs over ""not having a backup plan."" Uhhh...Add to the hypocrisy a slew of ridiculous scenes that can only be found in Uwe Boll films, including a horribly cliche blackmarket deal for firearms that goes down in an alley out of the side of a van (and where a pair of grenades are also sold for $100), our lead-man engaging in target practice right next to the subway, and our lead-man setting up his ""war room"" in a hotel where the housekeeping crew presumably doesn't clean anything (because otherwise they'd, um, find his hitlist and firearms and stuff), and we've got another sure-fire Boll classic on our hands.Once the shooting finally begins, Purcell's character indescriminately guns down faceless office workers and men in suits that may or may not be affiliated with Wall Street. I assume they are since they're dressed nice and work in a big building, but that's all we really know about them. The only idea that matters is they deserve to die. Because Purcell's character couldn't manage his funds. Excuse me while I yawn. This final 20 minute stretch is nothing more than despicable fantasy violence for crybaby Occupiers who spend all their time hating the rich, begging for government handouts, and contributing absolutely nothing to our society (because capitalism is evil, duh).Though I've tried, I'll be the first to admit that words cannot accurately capture all the inanity rolled up in this film. Uwe Boll writes it, Uwe Boll produces it, Uwe Boll directs it. The end result is exactly what you would expect.",1,Assault on Wall Street falls flat on its ignorant face.,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,3551,"['reasons', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'not', 'only', 'turn', 'out', 'films', 'insult', 'intelligent', 'people', 'everywhere', 'also', 'core', 'fanbase', 'right', 'up', 'Boll', 'supporters', 'will', 'love', 'latest', 'steaming', 'pile', 'manure', 'Assault', 'Wall', 'Street', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'cliche', 'gimmicks', 'can', 'suffer', 'hour', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'Bankster', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clearly', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'nothing', 'investing', 'finance.Let', 'take', 'brief', 'moment', 'say', 'acting', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'somewhere', 'deep', 'awful', 'script', 'hint', 'decent', 'drama', 'couple', 'tough', 'times', 'financially', 'way', 'let', 'continue', 'explore', 'Assault', 'Wall', 'Street', 'innumerable', 'failures.As', 'stated', 'previously', 'financial', 'talk', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'practically', 'insufferable', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'terminology', 'concepts', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'Foreclosures', 'do', 'not', 'happen', 'matter', 'days', 'lawyers', 'do', 'not', 'force', 'make', 'split-second', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'entire', 'financial', 'future', 'really', 'know', 'nothing', 'begin', 'with.And', 'major', 'problem', 'Assault', 'Wall', 'Street.The', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'feel', 'bad', 'lead', 'character', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'financial', 'woes', 'are', 'constantly', 'assaulted', 'anti-Wall', 'Street', 'propaganda', 'blatant', 'subtle', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'direct', 'anger', 'Except', 'Purcell', 'character', 'made', 'first-grade', 'mistake', 'putting', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'revealed', 'invested', 'life', 'savings', 'single', 'guaranteed', 'money-making', 'opportunity', 'very', 'predictably', 'Boo', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Monsters', 'Puh-lease', 'Nobody', 'took', 'advantage', 'man', 'made', 'bad', 'investment', 'untrustworthy', 'firm', 'paid', 'price', 'nothing', 'immoral', 'whole', 'rotten', 'mess', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'ironic', 'when', 'late', 'film', 'Purcell', 'character', 'dig', 'one', 'Wall', 'Street', 'big-wigs', 'not', 'having', 'backup', 'plan', 'Uhhh', 'Add', 'hypocrisy', 'slew', 'ridiculous', 'scenes', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'films', 'including', 'horribly', 'cliche', 'blackmarket', 'deal', 'firearms', 'down', 'alley', 'side', 'van', 'where', 'pair', 'grenades', 'are', 'also', 'sold', '100', 'lead-man', 'engaging', 'target', 'practice', 'right', 'next', 'subway', 'lead-man', 'setting', 'up', 'war', 'room', 'hotel', 'where', 'housekeeping', 'crew', 'presumably', ""n't"", 'clean', 'anything', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'um', 'find', 'hitlist', 'firearms', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sure-fire', 'Boll', 'classic', 'hands.Once', 'shooting', 'finally', 'Purcell', 'character', 'indescriminately', 'down', 'faceless', 'office', 'workers', 'men', 'suits', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'affiliated', 'Wall', 'Street', 'assume', 'are', ""'re"", 'dressed', 'nice', 'work', 'big', 'building', 'really', 'know', 'only', 'idea', 'matters', 'deserve', 'die', 'Purcell', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'manage', 'funds', 'yawn', 'final', '20', 'minute', 'stretch', 'nothing', 'more', 'despicable', 'fantasy', 'violence', 'crybaby', 'Occupiers', 'who', 'spend', 'time', 'hating', 'rich', 'begging', 'government', 'handouts', 'contributing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'society', 'capitalism', 'evil', 'duh', ""'ve"", 'tried', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'accurately', 'capture', 'inanity', 'rolled', 'up', 'film', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'end', 'result', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect']",Assault on Wall Street

1646743,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00CFB6OPM,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[3, 9]","Our society is feeling a high degree of impotence these days, as we see how the people responsible for the economic crisis, mostly the bandits at Wall Street, have gotten away with murder. Many people have learned the meaning of the word suffering because of them. I'm sure that you know one. Although some films have been released explaining the origins and some of the tragic results, none - I believe - will give you well-deserved personal satisfaction and a dose of happiness as in the gripping and electrifying ""Assault on Wall Street.""The movie begins, precisely, in the office of Jeremy Stancroft (John Heard), head of a Wall Street investment firm. Things are not going well, and they are on the verge of loosing everything due to greed. He advises two of his lieutenants to order the staff to commit further malpractices so that he could save his tail. When the assistants complain, he tells them, ""The problem is saving the company, not the clients. Our responsibility begins and ends with our partners and shareholders, and that's it!"" We then meet Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell), a regular guy trying to make ends meet. He works as a security guard in an armored truck, his partner being Sean (Edward Furlong). His regular day includes having lunch with Sean, and police officer buddies Freddy (Keith David) and Frank (Michael Par&eacute;). Most importantly, he is happily married to Rosie (Erin Karpluk), and it is his wish to have children in their future. Sadly, Rosie gets sick and needs expensive treatment, which Jim provides with his insurance. He also counts on some money being handled by the wizards at Wall Street. When his wife's medical bills begin to pile up, and he tries to access his investment money, he is told that the money is gone. These conditions ignite a sad chain of events in Jim's life that affect his happy marriage with damaging results. With nothing to loose, he decides to take action. And, boy, did he take action!""Assault on Wall Street,"" which original name was ""Bailout: The Age of Greed,"" builds up slowly and director Uwe Boll makes sure that you feel every step. You witness how Jim's life begins to slowly disintegrate and how he is pushed against the wall - his pain is yours. And the end is as smart as you can get, incredibly well-thought and opens the possibility for a sequel. The only negative thing, I believe, is the amount of time that Jim is shown thinking his actions when alone. But that, I guess, is part of the build-up that takes us to a satisfying conclusion. And, along the way, we'll learn that ""it's the free trade, my friend. It's capitalism. That's competition in a capitalist society. It's why the cream always rises to the top. That's how the strong survives, and the weak dies off.""

Actually Uwe Boll has a lot of good movies but apparently gets every movie he makes a swarm of instant hate because of some corny video game movies he made a while back. These were also video games that were good but not hardly as popular as the whiny bunch of nerds that seems to bring them up would like you to think. BloodRayne,FarCry,Dungeon siege etc. They were a bunch of PC games for nerds that got console releases that did okay. They weren't mega popular games like Resident Evil or Tomb raider so of course they didn't get Hollywood blockbuster budgets or Michael Bay as a director. Stop complaining already!Uwe Boll has a certain them to his movies where he shoots them from the perspective of the everyday person that puts on their pants one leg at a time. I noticed in the last series of films he released follow the legendary ""RAMPAGE"" (that people are somehow still just finding about) that Uwe Boll really likes to deal with the reality that we all live in. One of his best films that portrays this I'd say is ""Attack on Darfur"" which I'm sure hardly many people have even heard of. That was a heavy film to watch and when I was done I had a new found respect for Uwe Bolls capabilities as a director. I get it that he takes a bigger interests in movies that give him freedom vs. movies that require him to adapt them from someone elses work. I think M.K. Shayamalan is like this also. He is another excellent director that gets flack for making another adaption movie ""Avatar"" and gets hate from folks. M.K. Shayamalan is also another creative mind that like to give you something completely different than what hollywood has been giving you and I see the same things in him as I do in Uwe Boll which is why I enjoy their movies because I can always expect to see something I haven't seen before.As for Assault on Wall Street it's like I said earlier it's a movie about life. Mr. Average Joe that works hard, pays his mortgage, has a wife, wants a family etc. etc. but falls victim to the Capitalism. Greedy companies,Greedy Banks, Greedy Lawyers, Fair weather Insurance Agencies, A job that cares more about it's image than the well being of its employees. It's basically a movie about how companies and those that benefit from them play with peoples lives. This movie is about the Person that those companies only see as a number and not as a human being. It's about how the decisions of these companies to pull themselves from the fire by throwing other people in it effect the people they just sacrificed.I'd say this is a movie probably wont mean much to people under the age of 25 because they can't relate to Jim the main character...yet. For people over the age of 25 that have families,careers, a house, investments, retirement funds etc. etc. it's film you can certainly understand.

But before I go there, let's talk about the movie itself.SLOW and LOW, that is The Tempo. I fell asleep TWICE while watching it. It felt like watching a four hour surveillance video of an empty street. Jeeeeeeezuz! If you are looking for action, keep looking. This crusty ball of horse dung has some shooting, and even a grenade or two exploding, but it is minimal. You'd be better off with OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN.The story takes way to long to get moving. Over an hour is spent just getting to the point that the main player is losing everything. Really? Most Americans have now BEEN THERE DONE THAT so we don't need all the inane details of how it can happen, WE KNOW ALREADY!  Oh, but wait, this was made by Hollywood elites who have never had to deal with these issues, so they are clueless.The plot is poor because after spending an hour building up to the point, it takes another 40 minutes to get to the action which the main player uses to soothe his pain.But does it make any sense. Granted, it is a movie, but keep in mind it is also HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDA. That is why there is so much time spent vilifying bankers and bank employees. Remember when Obama did that in 2009? The speech by the head ""bad guy"" at the end is pure, unmitigated propaganda. Jeeeeeeze, at least try to conceal your rhetoric in some kind of believable dialogue.Sadly, the ""bad guys"" are just ordinary people doing their job. No malice is really ever demonstrated. People who work in businesses are not able to bend the company rules for individuals. That would lead to lawsuits and is bad business.Of course, the left thinks all business is bad. This movie will appeal to OCCUPY WALL STREET types, skateboarders, and Jew-haters. Yes, BANKER is a racist code-word the left uses for Jew. It is part of the new world Antisemitism.Oddly missing from the equation in this movie: LAW MAKERS! What role did Chuck Dodd, Barney Frank, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid play in the mortgage crisis? If you don't know the answer, look it up. Google it. YouTube it.SPOILER ALERT -kinda-  One of my close relatives used to eat fast food three and four times a day. He died at the age of 36, partly because of obesity, partly because of cigarette smoking. What sense would it make for me to go around shooting fry guys and burger flippers, or convenience store clerks to ""get even?""  Right, it wouldn't. So, that the ""hero"" here is some kind of FOR THE PEOPLE marauder of bank tellers and stock brokers is equally UNREASONABLE, LUDICROUS, and STUPID.Hollywood continues to rip off movie goers with high priced, low quality goods.

I think it's one of his best movies to date.",5,Good movie but sad too,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,830,"['Big', 'fan', 'Dominic', 'Purcell', 'movie', 'really', 'acting', 'ability', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'when', 'stock', 'market', 'screwed', 'clients', 'money', 'save', 'businesses', 'middle', 'class', 'guy', 'wife', 'mortgage', 'who', 'was', 'duped', 'investments', 'broker', 'company', 'movie', 'depressing', 'too', 'wife', 'illness', 'used', 'up', 'insurance', 'money', 'So', 'true', 'life', 'When', 'wife', 'dies', 'breaking', 'point', 'when', 'fun', 'crooks', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'liked', 'friendship', 'co-worker', 'cop', 'friends', 'movie', 'feel', 'middle', 'class', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'even', 'big', 'companies', 'who', 'did', 'wrong', 'Dominic', 'emotions', 'are', 'charts', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'date']",Assault on Wall Street

However, there are more plot holes in this movie than you could fill with a ton of joint compound.  This guy is a veteran, OK, and he just happened to take with him after discharge his M4?  He is an armored car driver in New York,obviously subject to a background and criminal record check, but he has an illegal military assault rifle that he took from his military days? (Storage box said US Army or the equivalent on it). Okay, it's possible--not likely.  Let's move on.  He misses a few payments on his mortgage and he's immediately being evicted?  In New York you will be staying between 2-4 years in your home in a foreclosure.  He goes to Eric Roberts the Lawyer, and the lawyer says he has to choose between settlement negotiations and a motion for an injunction in an afternoon? Crap!  In reality you would start the negotiations, and move for injunction later if necessary, you would never have that kind of time pressure. (I have been doing this kind of stuff in NY for 32+ years). On to more interesting stuff.  He shoots up half of New York with both his trusty M4 and handguns, but the cops go after the Wall Street Guy who was pointing a gun at our friendly neighborhood loser, and forget to check said loser?  Let's see, he has a military background--his cop friends know this.  The Wall street guy was only shot holding a pistol in his office.  Do you think maybe some cop might ask, ""Well Gee, who shot all those other people through the building windows?  Where did the hand grenades come from?  Nope, not here.  They merely put a bandage OVER THE SUIT JACKET of our wounded ""hero"" and let him go.  By the way, some people who might have been snipers might opine that shooting a .223 through a heavy glass window might on occasion somewhat deflect the path of the bullet.  Not here.  If you are seeing this at no extra cost on a streaming  video service, okay.
