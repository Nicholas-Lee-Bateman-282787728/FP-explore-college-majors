881197,A33D1LPCYUANWE,B0007IO740,alexander laurence,"[26, 39]","This interesting movie is about the vital history of two bands: The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. Although it pretends to cover seven years in time, it is mostly about when these two bands were signed by major and indie labels in 1996 and 1997. People like myself who were journalists at the time, with Cups Magazine and Free Williamsburg Online have already covered most of the history of these bands. They were in magazines a lot. I interviewed Anton Newcombe back in 2001. That interview and others like it is perhaps all someone has to know about him. The music speaks for itself. I have seen this film twenty times now. I saw an early cut of it with Anton sitting next to me. First off I have to say that I have mixed feelings about it.First off I think it is great cinema and must be seen. Anton Newcombe has been making music his whole life and has been able to revive the sprit and heart of bands like The Velvet Underground and The Jesus and Mary Chain. He was doing this music fifteen years ago. Today almost every garage band is making this similar minded music. Today a lot of bands are safe, polite, and business-like. Anton somehow has embraced the rock and roll myth and has updated it. His music, and not his behavior, is always the most important thing though.Secondly I reject the whole Oprah-esque, pop psychology tone of this film. Director Ondi Timoner has suggested that Anton Newcombe is a product of a broken home and that is the reason why he seems so angry and uncompromising. The Dandy Warhols are portrayed as a bunch of well-adjusted post-hippies who get along with everyone and know how to succeed. Like their good souls and parents somehow relate to outward success. I have known Anton Newcombe for twenty years and have known nothing about his parents and his drugs habits. Anton has always been a person who liked to confront people. He likes to argue. That is his nature. Anton has always been a person who loves music. He is a songwriter above everything else.It seems like The Dandy Warhols do just as much drugs as any other band. So much for their healthy habits. They don't fight with their audiences and fight with each other. They seemed bored most of the movie. They are like some spoiled privileged children who expect attention. Director Ondi Timoner has said, ""There are perfectly functional people that make great art, Like Courtney and the Dandys."" I think it's a little premature to say the Dandys have made ""great art."" They are not the Beatles, Brian Wilson, or Bob Dylan, who are really great artists. Anton himself has made twelve albums. You can't be dysfunctional and write that many songs. Who is Timoner kidding? The Dandys are not even selling as many records as Interpol, The Killers, or Green Day. The Dandys still play small venues in America that new bands with one album play.I guess that Anton made the mistake of getting into a fight every time Timoner had the cameras on. I have seen Anton play twenty times or more and there were no fights. Some of the footage shot with hidden cameras is an evasion of privacy. On the other hand, according to Zia McCabe, Timoner deleted many stupid comments that The Dandys made. She made them look good always if she had the chance. The commentary by Ondi Timoner is a good chance to show off her baby and nothing else. Why that Nina A&R; chick is in the film more than once is beyond me. I heard that she is Ondi's best friend or something. It would have been better to have other bands and fellow musicians talk about BJM and less A&R; people.Timoner is very dishonest about the origins of the film as well. She has said ""This project (was) about bands negotiating the route between art and commerce..."" That is a lame and vague description, and could be made about any film. As I have heard this film was originally about BJM and a few other bands, all of which are no longer together. Newcombe suggested that she should do a film about his band and the Dandys, because the rest of the bands she chose didn't matter. As can be seen in the film, Timoner tells Newcombe that she have never heard of the Dandy Warhols. How could she have thought of a film about these two bands if she hadn't heard of one of them before she started shooting? Now we can only wonder why Newcombe has dismissed the film as an exercise in Jerry Springer technique.Newcombe has other points of the film to contend with. He thinks that not enough of his music is represented. Every song gets cut off after thirty seconds. There are a few live songs by BJM on the bonus DVD but not the great videos they have done. It's unclear to me what happens in Georgia. When BJM gets busted in Georgia, it was really Ondi Timoner herself who was alledgely busted for marijuana. Newcombe was only cited for an expired license. On the commentary all people are very quiet or edited out at this point. Police in Kansas stopped me once in 1996, so I know how it is. This is one of the main points of the film. BJM are so damn unlucky, while the successful and lucky Dandys only get a ticket in France. The other problem with the film is that Timoner just focuses on two years with BJM while she shows eight years of the Dandys. There is footage from a live performance in 2003, but it is only live footage of the Sunset Junction gig. There is not a lot of footage from the past three years. I guess Anton wasn't beating up anyone then, so it was not worthy of the film? People tend to act up when the cameras are running. If BJM had fifty members in its twelve years of existence we only saw about ten members. We only got 20% of the story.Anton Newcombe has done his best work in the past three years. BJM has played hundreds of shows in America, Canada, and the UK. At the end of this film you get a feeling that BJM has broken up and Anton has died. This is not even close to the truth. Anton is not even on the DVD commentary (neither is Peter Hayes). About the DVD he is as silent as he was when listening to ""Junkie."" His band has been the launching pad for about artists such as BRMC, Miranda Lee Richards and The Warlocks. His influence is still enormous and inspiring. I don't really see the same inspiring hotbed of creative activity from the Dandy Warhols. They just seem like a bunch of smug, rich kids, or social climbers, who when they got in the door, using the BJM ladder, they just kicked the ladder away. This movie is just a weathermap. The real art is the music of Brian Jonestown Massacre and Anton Newcombe. That music written by Anton will be the only thing that will ever be considered art connected to this film. Even The Dandys agree with that sentiment in the film. The Dandys are nothing but a pop group. They are just another band.People who see this film can only be more interested in BJM. People who like The Dandys are not going to think more of them having seen this film. It's sad to see Joel Gion on the cover of the DVD. I know that he plays the fool to Anton's tortured genius. But it's like seeing Jack Kerouac and Neil Cassidy on the cover of On The Road. The author is reduced to a supporting role in the book he has written.I suggest getting some of the BJM CDs as well. They are wonderful.",5,BJM are all the better for it,1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,7214,"['interesting', 'movie', 'vital', 'history', 'two', 'bands', 'Brian', 'Jonestown', 'Massacre', 'Dandy',

881198,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0007IO740,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[3, 3]","""Dig!"" is a hilarious, heartbreaking documentary about the dueling indie bands of the '90s--the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The Brian Jonestown Massacre are the Bad Boys--the Rolling Stones compared to the rather staid (in their private lives,at least) Beatles that are the Dandy Warhols. Anton Newcombe (of the BJM) is the mad genius at the documentary's heart. He has an intense love/hate relationship with the Dandy Warhols. He can't stand them for being ""sell-outs"",yet he follows them avidly, even stalking their concerts. Ironically, while he dismisses the DWs as pop--I've never heard them on Top 40 Radio. Joel Gion is the true comic of the BJM, while Matt Hollywood, who looks like John Lennon, gives Newcombe some well-needed critique.""Dig!"" provides insight to the indie rock scene of the Pacific Northwest. After all, they were contemporaries with a little Seattle group called Nirvana. As Newcombe notes, the BJM paved the way for the White Stripes being played on pop radio. The Dandy Warhols have their own special studio in Portland, and recently their frontman, Courtney Taylor-Taylor, played guitar on the title track for Pink Martini'sSplendor in the Grass. Newcombe has gone solo... and in a tragic footnote, due to his history of violence, he's not allowed to see his own son.""Dig!"" is a bittersweet symphony.",5,Live Like a Rock Star,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,1350,"['Dig', 'hilarious', 'heartbreaking', 'documentary', 'dueling', 'indie', 'bands', ""'90s"", 'Dandy', 'Warhols', 'Brian', 'Jonestown', 'Massacre', 'Brian', 'Jonestown', 'Massacre', 'are', 'Bad', 'Boys', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'compared', 'rather', 'staid', 'private', 'lives', 'least', 'are', 'Dandy', 'Warhols', 'Anton', 'Newcombe', 'BJM', 'mad', 'genius', 'documentary', 'heart', 'intense', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Dandy', 'Warhols', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'being', 'sell-outs', 'yet', 'avidly', 'even', 'stalking', 'concerts', 'Ironically', 'DWs', 'pop', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Top', '40', 'Radio', 'Joel', 'Gion', 'true', 'comic', 'BJM', 'Matt', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Newcombe', 'well-needed', 'critique.', 'Dig', 'insight', 'indie', 'rock', 'scene', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'were', 'contemporaries', 'little', 'Seattle', 'group', 'called', 'Nirvana', 'Newcombe', 'notes', 'BJM', 'paved', 'way', 'White', 'Stripes', 'being', 'played', 'pop', 'radio', 'Dandy', 'Warhols', 'have', 'own', 'special', 'studio', 'Portland', 'recently', 'frontman', 'Courtney', 'Taylor-Taylor', 'played', 'guitar', 'title', 'track', 'Pink', ""Martini'sSplendor"", 'Grass', 'Newcombe', 'gone', 'solo', 'tragic', 'footnote', 'due', 'history', 'violence', 'not', 'allowed', 'see', 'own', 'son.', 'Dig', 'bittersweet', 'symphony']",Dig!

881200,AS558SNWF1DXG,B0007IO740,Clare Quilty,"[37, 39]","Sure, ""Metallica: Some Kind of Monster"" got all the love in 2004, but my favorite rock-doc-as-car-crash of last year was this: ""DiG!""Seven-some years in the making, it's director Ondi Timoner's crazy love letter to two men -- Anton Newcombe, leader of The Brian Jonestown Massacre; and Courtney Taylor, head of the Dandy Warhols.  Both groups ignited like Apollo 11's on the launch pad of the 1990s music scene but slowly sputtered back down to the ground just as spectacularly.Newcombe seems like a musical genius who can't resist imploding at the worst possible times and places, while Taylor has the drive and accessibility to succeed without the crucial spark of crazed brilliance.  Their friendship/rivalry takes a lot of turns during the course of this film, which was mostly recorded on handheld cameras as the events unfolded.Everything that's right and wrong with the music industry is here: the inescapable mechanics of the game; the perils of drugs, egomania, overambition, pride and possession of mass quantities of obnoxiousness.  Anybody who thinks they might want to make music for money should see this film first.Plus, there's a lot of great, entertaining footage here: Newcombe's ill-advised handling of a Georgia roadcheck; a run-in with David LaChappelle; and especially the BJM's disastrous, Andy Kaufman-esque meltdown in front of record execs at the Viper Room (you gotta love any fight scene that ends with ""motherf----r broke my sitar, man!"").The movie's only significant weakness the fact that Taylor voices the film narration.  Yes, he was there and can comment on the events unfolding with a distinct air of authority, but his reading also gives the lines an unignorable bias.  It's a regretable slip that tilts the movie to a slightly unfair angle, but it doesn't sink ""DiG!""Plus, this movie had one of my favorite supporting ""performances"" of the year: long-suffering BJM sideman Joel Gion.

I got a bit drunk at the show and started heckling Anton from the back of the club. I think it set the mood for the rest of the night. After every song I yelled ""YOU SUCK!!!!"". After about the 3rd time Anton said (much like he did in a later scene in the film) ""I see you hiding there in the dark, saying s#%t about my band, why don't you come up here near the stage and say that s&%t?"", I said ""F%$k you!!"" Anton then replied ""we just want to entertain"" and I responded ""you aren't entertaining"", he kind went ape$h&t and the mood of the night went drastically downhill after that. It must have been a song or two later where a freind of mine who I worked with at a record store was hasseling Joel. He pulled him off stage and the two of the started rolling around on the floor. I pushed Joel off the guy I knew, then Matt Hollywood smashed the beer bottles together and lunged at me with them. Anton pulled him back. He's right, I would have torn him apart. The mele went on for about 10 minutes. The last thing I remember is watching Anton trying to get paid by the Magic stick, them saying there was no money and him looking depressed as all hell. Detroit spits up musicians like this. And yes, Jack White sucker punched Jason Stolsteimer at the Magic Stick. As far as the DVD goes, I was disappointed that more of the Detroit riot wasn't in it. However, the bonus footage is well worth the price, as it's essentially a sequel. The footage of Joel by itself is the highlight of the set.

They are about as similar as The Beatles and The Spice Girls, but the documentary works as a whole, as it would if nearly anybody, say, Billy Idol, walked in and joined the mix. Anton Newcombe, of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, is a bona fide eccentric, borderline nutcase rock star, and although it may be true, as Dandy Warhol's lead, Courtney Taylor says in the aftermath of the production, that he's really a nice guy, but a very bad drunk, he still looks like a total (any expletive word will do), as he kicks a fan in the head for a mild catcall during a show, lays claim and emotional fervor to a newborn son, kicks back on heroin highs, and chases The Dandys around in a revealing confusion of publicity and emotional longing. He is the single most fascinating aspect of the documentary, a reckless and unhinged true artist, and a very bad drunk, and without him there is a much lesser film. It's hysterical to hear the voice-over of Brian Jonestown Massacre's representative, as she explains the night she gathered top record company executives in a club to hear the band perform, and secure them a major recording contract, based on the positive industry buzz they were receiving.

This documentary focuses on two ""can't-miss"" bands that have somehow managed to miss continuously, either through the incessant professional suicidal tendencies of this generation's leading ""tortured artist"" Anton Newcombe"" of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, or from a major record label's never-ending inability to properly market and/or promote the talent that they shelled out so much hard-earned cash to sign away from other labels in Courtney Taylor Taylor (don't ask) of the Dandy Warhols.The documentary takes place from roughly 1995 through 2003, but the majority of time seems to be spent from 1997-'98, wherein the Warhols are signed to Capitol Records and supposedly find themselves on the inside track to success just as the Massacre suffres one wholly self-engineered debacle after another as Newcombe loses the plot and decides that the Warhols have somehow compromised all levels of their artistic integrity because they have actually gotten some (albeit too few) people to listen to them and actually buy their records.Newcombe is idealized as the greatest musical genius since Bob Dylan and the Warhols are somehow shown as far lesser talents whose success would appear to be wide-reaching, but a review of either artist's career will confirm that this cannot be taken at face value.  Both bands have gifts for writing and arranging hook-driven pop songs that really are too good for today's commercial music scene.  The success of the Dandy Warhols lies more in their ability to market their music to film soundtracks and advertising campaigns (not covered well enough in this film, IMO) than as a result of massive record sales in their home country (although they are huge in Australia and extremely respectable in Britain and Europe).This is a very entertaining and sometimes very painful movie to watch; it's not often you are afforded the chance to watch someone tearing the wires out of their career so publically (and for such an extended period of time), but although this film introduces two very talented bands (and hopefully will tap a heretofore unrealized fan base), I can't recommend it as truly indicative of the careers of both bands.The bonus features included in the DVD make it worth the price of ownership if you happened to see the film in theatres.  Bonus live performances, extended scenes, even some promotional videos (not, sadly, for LaChappelle's work with the Warhols) as well as commentary audio tracks from both bands as well as the filmmakers are sure to offer additional insight (and possibly additional versions of the truth) as to what was filmed.

But when you get through the hype of the narrative, how much of this thesis holds up?  The documentary seems designed to argue a thesis, but viewers can't help wishing for a little bit of the other side of the story.  I think Courtney shows good manners throughout, even consenting to narrate a film that tries to make him look like a jackass at every juncture.That said, the picture grows on you, and lets you into a number of secret places along the way.  Jeff Davies (of BJM) was born to play leading roles in front of the camera; his damaged, wounded face and his large kissable lips are like movie magic, he simply burns up the screen, and you don't even care what he's on half the time.  Miranda Lee Richards, who has a great LP of her own music, makes a fascinating impression as well.  She is enigmatic and naturalistic as Jeanne Moreau in an early Louis Malle movie.  She doesn't say a lot, but her gaze and her stance say plenty.

881215,A289D9XGCKB1O0,B0007IO740,Ouija,"[0, 2]","Shot over seven years, Dig! is a documentary that, at its most basic, chronicles the complicated friendship between two musicians, Courtney Taylor of the Dandy Warhols and Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.The film goes deep beneath the surface to capture the funny, sad and compelling lives of these men and their bands, particularly the mercurial Newcombe. The Taylor-Newcombe friendship is fraught with jealousy, rage, admiration, love, hate and bitterness, especially as Taylor's Dandys achieve some level of commercial success while Newcombe's BJM self-destructs at every turn, mostly by Newcombe's own hand..One important theme here is the concept of giving up or compromising one's vision and art for the almighty dollar. Taylor is  willing to take the risk (and succeeds), Newcombe isn't (and flounders). But that leads to another compelling question, posed by the Dandy's Peter Holstrom: what's the point of making music if no one gets to hear it?Indeed. When BJM is given a second (tenth?) chance at getting signed with a major label, Newcombe again pisses it away as the band brawls on stage. The label rep was apparently not impressed.There's no doubt that Newcombe is the ""star"" of this film. From his flashes of brilliance to his indulgent heroin use, the engaging and fascinating artist wastes his talent and creativity to fill a higher need, which apparently is a strong desire for attention. This becomes clear when we see interviews with his parents - a deadbeat dad who commits suicide on his birthday and an ambivalent mother who has simply given up.Ondi Timoner captures some great moments on film, including all the amusing fights on stage, rants, raves and general madness. And she does a nice job of capturing it all without being a part of it or judging any of the motley cast of characters in the process. I loved this film.

That cleared up, I don't know what it's taken me so long to see this movie, but I finally did, and it frankly blew my mind. This release comes with 2 DVD's.DVD 1 (120 min.) brings the original film (107 min.), tracing the origins of both bands, and their respective band leaders/singer-song-writers, Aton Newcombe for BMJ and Courtney Taylor for the Warholes. The movie was filmed over a 7 year period (1996-2003) and showcases the struggles of both bands to make it 'big'. The main focus of the film is on Anton Newcombe, a brilliant musician, but a very troubled human being (and I'm being kind). Clearly having the talent to make it big, Anton simply self-implodes time and again. Whether this is by choice or not is probably a medical issue, frankly. Watch the LA Viper Room scene, when they all know there are a number of record executives in the room, wanting to sign the band, and the gig ends up incredibly in an all-out fight among the band members on stage. Unbelievable, but real. The movie comes with a number of ""linkouts"" (about 15 min. in total) that lead you to additional scenes (such as when the Dandy Warholes' drummer leaves the band, which then gives a interview with the guy after the facts, reflecting on it).DVD 2 ( 65 min.) brings deleted scenes, videos from the Dandy Warholes, and several live clips from BJM, as well as a jam session between Anton and Courtney. But most interesting for me was the ""Where Are They Now"" sequence, as well as an extended interview with the film's director.I had never seen Brian Jonestown Massacre live until last year at the Monolith Music Festival (at the Red Rocks near Denver) and their 60 min. tension-filled set was fascinating. Anton Newcombe berated both the audience and his own band members, walking out several times, only to return. Unforgettable.
