1382054,A2UITTZE0YDER2,B0041OOW8M,"ServusDei ""udayajmj""","[29, 32]","The problem in this movie St. John Baptist de la Salle:Patron of teachers is trying to condense the life of one of the church's great contributors into a 90 minute movie, and doing an excellent job of it. He did so much for the cause of education that he has earned a niche (i.e. a statue)at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome!So is it possible to summarize his life into this short time interval, without leaving out its important aspects?Let me first focus on the pros of this movie with a brief overview of the life of this genius of a man and saint.Saint Jean Baptiste de la Salle was born into an affluent family of the French aristocracy in the year 1651. He was ordained in 1678 and was well known for his good breeding, education and intelligence. He was made a canon (i.e member of the chapter of a cathedral or of a collegiate church)of Rheims Cathedral when he was just 16. He was well known for his charitable attitude to the less fortunate and was known to be most approachable despite his distinction. He used all his inheritance( which was a considerable sum) for the establishment of schools for the under privileged throughout France, and he revolutionized eduction for the masses, moving from the classical education that was common in those days to a more contemporary education that would be beneficial to his proteges in real life, for example, doing away with instruction in Latin in favor of the vernacular French, incorporating vocational trade, separating the students according to different levels of education, intellect and psychological development, and focusing on the children's special talents and striving to develop them to their full potential, not ignoring kids who are slower and so on..He was, in short, the father of the modern school.This movie was originally made in Spanish in 1964 under the title 'El senor de la Salle', the American release was entitled 'Who are my own'..And like all movies of that era it has beautiful settings (France), a lovely background score and excellent props and costumes. Very much like 'War and Peace'. The movie starts with Fr. de la Salle (FDLS) being made a canon of the cathedral of Rheims. Outside he is besieged by many beggars who while begging, express their scorn at the clergy. Amongst them is a petty thief named Adrian Nyel. Adrian one day steals FDLS's cross, and whose chase leads him to the undesirable areas of Rheims and where he stares at abject poverty in the face. He decides to help in the way he sees best and that is through education. And from this point begins the saga of the ups and downs of forming the congregation, dealing with family, poverty, betrayal, envy and all elements that have tormented the saints from the beginning of Christendom.Now where I take issue with this movie is that FDLS is known as the patron of teachers. And we see very little of his interaction with the students, his revolutionary ideas, the novelties associated with this new teaching methods and the success that bore fruit from it.Here the movie falls short. This was quite disappointing, for it seems the whole essence and point of the movie was left out. The  gist of the story revolves solely (it seems) on the establishment of the order.For had what I had just mentioned been incorporated, it would have been a superb movie considering the production.I must thank Ignatius press, nevertheless, for having brought this movie out of the vaults. It is in cooperation with the De la Salle brothers.Should one buy it? I would say yes, for it is after all,a good Catholic movie and a great production.We must also strive to encourage companies like Ignatius Press, to continue bringing Catholic movies to the masses.This movie IS good (I cannot emphasize it enough). However, I would also advice reading the attached booklet, which gives a short yet deep biographical insight into the life and times of FDLS and his teaching methods which gave birth to the schools of today.So what was left out in the movie is well provided for in the booklet.You may also want to try reading a booklet from CTS publications on the saint as well.The movie in itself deserves 4 stars for the reasons mentioned. However thanks to the booklet(good job Ignatius Press!),I happily rate it 5.A great gift to educators at any level, of any faith. It will help them realize the great contributions made by saintly men and women in the evolution of our modern world, especially since this overtly secularized culture of ours tends to down play, and take for granted the historicity as well as the cultural wealth that has been bequeathed to us by the Church.And to those avid collectors of catholic movies, this is a good addition to your collection.This DVD comes, as mentioned above, with a 15 page booklet which contains the following short essays:1)John Baptist de la Salle: A life in God's presence.2)What made these schools so unusual and desirable?3)John Baptist de la Salle: The educator and visionary.4)John Baptist de la Salle:The Saint.and5)Example from de la Salle's writings.Also note there are no special features on this DVD. Please also remember, dear readers, that this movie is out of the vault after 46 years ( I do not know if it was previously released on VHS, but I do believe that it is safe to deduce so!). Hence it is a little grainy but I rate 8 out of 10 for picture quality.",5,Good movie....but not the whole story,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,5353,"['problem', 'movie', 'St.', 'John', 'Baptist',
