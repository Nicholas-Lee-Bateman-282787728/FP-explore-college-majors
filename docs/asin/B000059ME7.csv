Though not a &quot;master actor&quot;, his charisma fills the screen when he's on camera.With a fine score by Gary Koftinoff, and well-paced direction by Andre van Heerden, who also co-wrote the clever script with Peter and Paul Lalonde, this is a low-buget film that gives us viewing value, with something to think about while we watch.

LAWS ""Linux enthusiast""","[4, 5]","I thought the movie had a good storyline, and the actors did their jobs well (although Mr. T had a stereotypical Mr. T performance).The one thing that really puzzles me is this : The movie claims to be a Christian film, however Mitch (played by Corbin Bernsen) wears a fake mark of the beast on his right hand, and he comes out in the  movie as the ""hero"". The Bible clearly states that anybody who takes the mark of the beast will go to Hell. My belief is that in God's eyes, wearing a fake mark of the beast would be no different than wearing the real thing.Plus, there are some continuity errors in this film as it relates to the whole ""Apocalypse"" series. In the 2nd film (""Revelations"") and 3rd film (""Tribulation""), the mark of the beast is presented as a 666 burnt into people's hands by Franco Macalousso by way of the ""image of the beast"" virtual reality helmet (thankfully the hokey VR helmet concept did not make it to ""Judgement""). In ""Judgement"", the mark is represented as a different design.The film is entertaining, but I find the whole ""hero who has a fake mark of the beast is still a hero at the end"" angle to be rather unsettling.",3,"Good movie, but for a Christian film, it has false teachings",1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1150,"['thought', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'actors', 'did', 'jobs', 'well', 'Mr.', 'T', 'had', 'stereotypical', 'Mr.', 'T', 'performance', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'movie', 'be', 'Christian', 'film', 'however', 'Mitch', 'played', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'fake', 'mark', 'beast', 'right', 'hand', 'out', 'movie', 'hero', 'Bible', 'clearly', 'anybody', 'who', 'mark', 'beast', 'will', 'go', 'Hell', 'belief', 'God', 'eyes', 'wearing', 'fake', 'mark', 'beast', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'wearing', 'real', 'thing.Plus', 'are', 'continuity', 'errors', 'film', 'whole', 'Apocalypse', 'series', '2nd', 'film', 'Revelations', '3rd', 'film', 'Tribulation', 'mark', 'beast', 'presented', '666', 'burnt', 'people', 'hands', 'Franco', 'Macalousso', 'way', 'image', 'beast', 'virtual', 'reality', 'helmet', 'thankfully', 'hokey', 'VR', 'helmet', 'concept', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'Judgement', 'Judgement', 'mark', 'represented', 'different', 'design.The', 'film', 'entertaining', 'find', 'whole', 'hero', 'who', 'fake', 'mark', 'beast', 'still', 'hero', 'end', 'angle', 'be', 'rather', 'unsettling']",N/A

But that slice of life goes much deeper than the antichrist had planned.A great installment to the Apocalypse series. The other three starring great underrated actors like Richard Nester (Apocalypse) Jeff Fahey (Revelation) and Gary Busey (Tribulation) which have all done good enough to continue me on through the series. The best out of these three being Revelation, but they are all good and must sees. Take it from a Christian, these are just as inspiring as God himself for the fact that they were made by Christians helps me to believe they were made for a good purpose.After a mis-execution, Helen Hannah (Gorgeous and a great first time actress, Leigh Lewis) has returned to the Tribulation under the mercy of Antichrist Franco Macalousso. After enduring two years of the tribulation, Macalousso decides he might as well make use of Helens existence, and salavage more of the world than before. After all, Satan won't be satisfied until he has everyone under his wing.As for Helen, still as devoted to God as ever, she is put under a scripted trial with a skeptical lawyer (Corbin Bernsen) who does nothing for her until he realizes she really is innocent. Under O.N.E's power, the prosecuter, a very stubborn and selfish woman (Jessica Steen) will do anything to get Helen Hannah the highest punishment in crime. But little do any of them know that they're all doing the opposite of what was really intended by them in the first place.Great. Nothing else really to describe it except great. You know, besides Helen, my other favorite character in the Apocalypse series who started appearing in Revelation is Selma Davis, Helens loyal friend and devoted Christian played by wonderful Marium Carvell. It's strange, whenever movies like this come out, even though the acting done by the known actors is good too, the best acting always comes from the unknown actors and actresses. A good example is Leigh Lewis and Marium Carvell. They should really get discovered after doing four films yet they haven't.

Councilor Mitch Kendrick (whose father, Seth, was an executed hater he defended) is irritated to find, not only that his ex-lover Vicky will be the prosecutor but, like in his father's trial, the whole thing will be fake. Meanwhile, Helen's band of believers want to rescue her, but J.T. Quincy, husband of Selma Davis' daughter, Sherry, wants to use violence to do it. Meanwhile, Helen soon learns that the mark of the beast on Mitch's hand is a black market forgery.The production value of this movie is the highest of all the four and the courtroom script is good. All of the actors involved in the courtroom do a wonderful job of acting. Bringing their characters to life. And the scenes appeared to be shot in real sets. Looks like they are doubling their budget to make higher quality movies.

573556,A3EJVZ5LCBP61X,B000059ME7,"TOMMY C ELLIS ""Prison Rev.""","[13, 14]","""God vs. Man"" is the basic premise of this story. Set in the near future, humanity has experienced a devestating incident--millions of people suddenly disappeared worldwide. The chaos that follows unites the nations under a global government led by Nick Mancouso.The government line is that those who disappeared were reactionary religionists who served to retard humanity's evolution toward spiritual unity and enlightenment. Anti-government rebels claim that the global leader is the biblical anti-Christ of the New Testament book of Revelation, and that those who disappeared were Christians, whom God had taken up to heaven, just prior to a period of great judgment.Accusations are tossed back and forth, and ultimately Helen Hannah, the leader of the rebels, is captured and put on trial for treason against humanity. However, her defense attorney says Hannah is not to blame--that she is a deluded follower of God--and that it is God who should be on trial.The dialogue and plot are much crisper than previous ones in this series. The attorneys are passionate, yet cool and persuasive. The protaganist is both vulnerable and resolute--a powerfully nuanced combination that is most believable.A subplot, in which those in the rebel camp argue over how much violence they can use for their cause, proved a messier storyline. It might have helped the overall product to drop this element, and enhance the main battle a bit more.Overall, this was an excellent product--the most professional of the set.",4,Best in the series!,1036886400,"11 10, 2002",2002,1504,"['God', 'vs.', 'Man', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'Set', 'near', 'future', 'humanity', 'experienced', 'devestating', 'incident', 'millions', 'people', 'suddenly', 'disappeared', 'worldwide', 'chaos', 'nations', 'global', 'government', 'led', 'Nick', 'Mancouso.The', 'government', 'line', 'who', 'disappeared', 'were', 'reactionary', 'religionists', 'who', 'served', 'retard', 'humanity', 'evolution', 'spiritual', 'unity', 'enlightenment', 'Anti-government', 'rebels', 'claim', 'global', 'leader', 'biblical', 'anti-Christ', 'New', 'Testament', 'book', 'Revelation', 'who', 'disappeared', 'were', 'Christians', 'whom', 'God', 'had', 'taken', 'up', 'heaven', 'just', 'prior', 'period', 'great', 'judgment.Accusations', 'are', 'tossed', 'back', 'forth', 'ultimately', 'Helen', 'Hannah', 'leader', 'rebels', 'captured', 'put', 'trial', 'treason', 'humanity', 'However', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Hannah', 'not', 'blame', 'deluded', 'follower', 'God', 'God', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'trial.The', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'are', 'much', 'crisper', 'previous', 'ones', 'series', 'attorneys', 'are', 'passionate', 'yet', 'cool', 'persuasive', 'protaganist', 'vulnerable', 'resolute', 'powerfully', 'nuanced', 'combination', 'most', 'believable.A', 'subplot', 'rebel', 'camp', 'argue', 'how', 'much', 'violence', 'can', 'use', 'cause', 'proved', 'messier', 'storyline', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'overall', 'product', 'drop', 'element', 'enhance', 'main', 'battle', 'bit', 'more.Overall', 'was', 'excellent', 'product', 'most', 'professional', 'set']",N/A

Jessica Steen made Victoria Thorne a really unlikeable character that you wished you could see her final fate as a lawyer who sold herself to the devil.  (Of course, if you have the DVD, you could see one of the deleted scenes where Franco Maccalusso does send her and the judge, though both of them barely seen, to their final fates -- a scene I wish could have been in the main cut.)  Corben Bernsen's character struggles under both hiding out as a uncommitted person bearing a fake ""mark of the beast"" to avoid death on either side of the battle of the ages, and with the manipulation he seems to be getting from both his former lover and the various One World Nation agents that he comes across throughout the whole thing.  Mr. T's character is basically Mr. T sounding like he's trying to do evangelism in his typical B.A. Barracas style of personality.
