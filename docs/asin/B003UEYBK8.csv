But if you're looking for a movie with a strong chemistry between the characters, character development beyond the superficial, and a few unpredictable moments to keep things moving forward, this is not the film for you.On the positive side, this is a film that you can watch with your pre-teen kids and not worry about the language or sex scenes.  It's all very tasteful and 'PG' to 'G' in my opinion.  It's 'cute' and as my 12 year old daughter put it: ""If I was going to give it a grade, the movie would get a 'C+'.""The downfall of the movie is in the very predictable storyline and the acting that is mediocre, and at times, barely believable.  I like Queen Latifah and have seen most of her films.  This is not her best work, but I think that is in part due to the lack of acting ability of her leading man and a poor script.It's not a long film, which helps.  The story of a NJ Net's basketball star being a really good guy who becomes friends with a physical therapist as she works him back into the game, and eventually falls in love with her, had promise - but it missed its mark.The On Demand quality was excellent, so if you want to see it just wait for it to go on sale and keep your expectations low.",3,"Predictable with mediocre acting, but fine for family viewing",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,1342,"[""'re"", 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'fan', 'simply', 'want', 'movie', ""'easy"", 'listening', 'equivalent', 'music', ""'ll"", 'like', 'movie', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'character', 'development', 'superficial', 'few', 'unpredictable', 'moments', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'forward', 'not', 'film', 'you.On', 'positive', 'side', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'pre-teen', 'kids', 'not', 'worry', 'language', 'sex', 'scenes', 'very', 'tasteful', 'G', 'opinion', '12', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'put', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'grade', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'C+', 'downfall', 'movie', 'very', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'times', 'barely', 'believable', 'like', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'films', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'think', 'part', 'due', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'leading', 'man', 'poor', 'script.It', 'not', 'long', 'film', 'story', 'NJ', 'Net', 'basketball', 'star', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'friends', 'physical', 'therapist', 'back', 'game', 'eventually', 'love', 'had', 'promise', 'missed', 'mark.The', 'Demand', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'so', 'want', 'see', 'just', 'wait', 'go', 'sale', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low']",N/A

1366068,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B003UEYBK8,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","You know me. I'm very critical of romantic comedies. That doesn't always prevent me from enjoying them, however. I enjoyed ""Just Wright"" very much, in large part because of Queen Latifah, whose character, Leslie Wright, is caring, independent, warm, self assured, and genuinely likeable. Her only flaw is not being able to find a man that wants to be more than friends, and even then you can't really blame her because she is trying. Part of the problem is her godsister and best friend, Morgan (Paula Patton), a shallow man hunter who gets what she wants ... even if Leslie had it first. Morgan is classically beautiful and not yet thirty, and loves dressing fancy wherever she goes. Leslie is thirty-five and has curves, and while she certainly can dress nicely, she isn't opposed to casual clothing, either.Movies like this are inherently contrived, so liking them really has nothing to do with believing in them. It has more to do with how they present themselves, if they're pleasant and fun and have good characters. ""Just Wright"" exudes such charm and goodwill that it entertains at a fundamentally emotional level. I also appreciated the fact that, while there's almost nothing plausible about what leads to the obligatory romance, the romance itself is compelling, focusing more on the process of falling in love than the end result. Anyone can capture immature puppy love on camera and call it a movie, but we don't often see older characters allowing something to develop naturally.Here's the story. Leslie, a New Jersey physical therapist and Basketball fan, has a chance encounter with Scott McKnight (Common), a star player for the Nets and a recent free agent. He's decent enough and seems to like her. He even invites her to his birthday party. All prospects of starting a relationship are seemingly shot when Morgan tags along; her goal is to become a trophy wife and live out the rest of her days shopping, dining, and looking good for photographers. Almost as quickly as they met, Scott and Morgan become engaged. But then Scott injures his knee during the NBA All-Star Game, and it's bad enough to put his career in jeopardy. If he's to take part in an upcoming game, he must undergo weeks of physical therapy, and he must turn to someone good. His first choice of therapist is too pretty for Morgan to compete with, which is why she hires Leslie.It turns out to be a very good move. Not only is she well trained, she's also a great motivator, taking a firm and no-nonsense approach. She takes care of Scott, but more to the point, she inspires him. A friendship develops rather quickly, although it takes a bit more time for them to realize that they're falling in love. Or perhaps they do realize it, but they're afraid to act on it for fear of actually finding what they've been looking for. Success, be it professional or personal, can be frightening, no matter how much one claims to want it. But what about Morgan? It shouldn't be too hard to figure out, but you should know that she isn't as shallow as she might seem. Misguided perhaps, although not without her good points. If only they weren't revealed at just such moments when they're the most convenient.But what am I complaining for? That's how movies like this work. What I cared about most was that I liked the characters, and I especially liked Leslie. She has such a wonderful personality - bright and accommodating yet not so desperate for affection that she allows herself to be trampled on. Perhaps she's an extension of the real Queen Latifah, who seems genuinely confident and good natured in all of her public appearances. As for the other cast members, they all hold their own, although some get less screen time than they probably deserved. Case in point: Phylicia Rashad as Scott's kindly mother, who seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to women like Morgan. She also has an affinity for people like Leslie, decent people who are strong, level-headed, and even a little opinionated.There's also Pam Grier and James Pickens, Jr. as Leslie's parents, and while they play their roles as best they can, neither are given all that much to do except be supporting roles. Pickens' character in particular is nothing more than momentary comedy relief, a well intentioned but inept Mr. Fix-It who helps Leslie renovate her home. I can understand the renovation aspect, for it's symbolic of the change occurring slowly but steadily in Leslie's life. The parents, however, did not seem necessary to me. It's a good thing they appeared so infrequently. All we really needed was Leslie, a great character in a story that isn't quite deserving of her. It gets the job done, but still, was there no way to go for something less conventional? Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen - effective, but often times forgettable. ""Just Wright"" entertained me because of its characters and tone, but the plot is just another face in the crowd.",4,"A Likeable Character, a Conventional Plot",1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,4921,"['know', ""'m"", 'very', 'critical', 'romantic', 'comedies', ""n't"", 'always', 'prevent', 'enjoying', 'however', 'enjoyed', 'Just', 'Wright', 'very', 'much', 'large', 'part', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'character', 'Leslie', 'Wright', 'caring', 'independent', 'warm', 'self', 'assured', 'genuinely', 'likeable', 'only', 'flaw', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'man', 'be', 'more', 'friends', 'even', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'trying', 'Part', 'problem', 'godsister', 'best', 'friend', 'Morgan', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'shallow', 'man', 'hunter', 'who', 'what', 'even', 'Leslie', 'had', 'first', 'Morgan', 'classically', 'beautiful', 'not', 'yet', 'thirty', 'dressing', 'fancy', 'wherever', 'Leslie', 'thirty-five', 'curves', 'certainly', 'can', 'dress', 'nicely', ""n't"", 'opposed', 'casual', 'clothing', 'either.Movies', 'are', 'inherently', 'contrived', 'liking', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'believing', 'more', 'do', 'how', 'present', ""'re"", 'pleasant', 'fun', 'have', 'good', 'characters', 'Just', 'Wright', 'exudes', 'such', 'charm', 'goodwill', 'fundamentally', 'emotional', 'level', 'also', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'almost', 'nothing', 'plausible', 'what', 'obligatory', 'romance', 'romance', 'compelling', 'focusing', 'more', 'process', 'falling', 'love', 'end', 'result', 'Anyone', 'can', 'capture', 'immature', 'puppy', 'love', 'camera', 'call', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'older', 'characters', 'allowing', 'something', 'develop', 'story', 'Leslie', 'New', 'Jersey', 'physical', 'therapist', 'Basketball', 'fan', 'chance', 'encounter', 'Scott', 'McKnight', 'Common', 'star', 'player', 'Nets', 'recent', 'free', 'agent', 'decent', 'enough', 'like', 'even', 'birthday', 'party', 'prospects', 'starting', 'relationship', 'are', 'seemingly', 'shot', 'when', 'Morgan', 'along', 'goal', 'become', 'trophy', 'wife', 'live', 'out', 'rest', 'days', 'shopping', 'dining', 'looking', 'good', 'photographers', 'Almost', 'as', 'quickly', 'met', 'Scott', 'Morgan', 'become', 'engaged', 'then', 'Scott', 'knee', 'NBA', 'All-Star', 'Game', 'bad', 'enough', 'put', 'career', 'jeopardy', 'take', 'part', 'upcoming', 'game', 'must', 'undergo', 'weeks', 'physical', 'therapy', 'must', 'turn', 'someone', 'good', 'first', 'choice', 'therapist', 'too', 'pretty', 'Morgan', 'compete', 'why', 'Leslie.It', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'move', 'Not', 'only', 'well', 'trained', 'also', 'great', 'motivator', 'taking', 'firm', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'care', 'Scott', 'more', 'point', 'friendship', 'rather', 'quickly', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'realize', ""'re"", 'falling', 'love', 'perhaps', 'do', 'realize', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'act', 'fear', 'actually', 'finding', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'Success', 'be', 'professional', 'personal', 'can', 'be', 'frightening', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'claims', 'want', 'what', 'Morgan', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'should', 'know', ""n't"", 'as', 'shallow', 'might', 'seem', 'Misguided', 'perhaps', 'not', 'good', 'points', 'only', 'were', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'just', 'such', 'moments', 'when', ""'re"", 'most', 'convenient.But', 'what', 'am', 'complaining', 'how', 'movies', 'work', 'What', 'cared', 'most', 'was', 'liked', 'characters', 'especially', 'liked', 'Leslie', 'wonderful', 'personality', 'bright', 'accommodating', 'yet', 'not', 'so', 'desperate', 'affection', 'be', 'trampled', 'Perhaps', 'extension', 'real', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'genuinely', 'confident', 'good', 'natured', 'public', 'appearances', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'hold', 'own', 'get', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'probably', 'deserved', 'Case', 'point', 'Phylicia', 'Rashad', 'Scott', 'kindly', 'who', 'have', 'sixth', 'sense', 'when', 'women', 'Morgan', 'also', 'affinity', 'people', 'Leslie', 'decent', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'strong', 'level-headed', 'even', 'little', 'opinionated.There', 'also', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'James', 'Pickens', 'Jr.', 'Leslie', 'parents', 'play', 'roles', 'can', 'are', 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'be', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Pickens', 'character', 'particular', 'nothing', 'more', 'momentary', 'comedy', 'relief', 'well', 'intentioned', 'Mr.', 'Fix-It', 'who', 'Leslie', 'renovate', 'home', 'can', 'understand', 'renovation', 'aspect', 'symbolic', 'change', 'occurring', 'slowly', 'steadily', 'Leslie', 'life', 'parents', 'however', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'necessary', 'good', 'thing', 'appeared', 'so', 'infrequently', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'Leslie', 'great', 'character', 'story', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deserving', 'job', 'done', 'still', 'was', 'way', 'go', 'something', 'conventional', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'effective', 'often', 'forgettable', 'Just', 'Wright', 'entertained', 'characters', 'tone', 'plot', 'just', 'face', 'crowd']",N/A

1366070,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B003UEYBK8,Craig Whittle,"[34, 34]","JUST WRIGHTSTARRING: Queen Latifah, Common, Paula Patton, Pam Grier, James Pickens Jr. and Phylicia RashadWRITTEN BY: Michael ElliotDIRECTED BY: Sanaa HamriRated: PGGenre: Romantic ComedyRelease Date: 14 May 2010Review Date: 25 May 2010It's been refreshing seeing so many romantic comedies as of late, that were not only good, but clean as well. Leap Year, Letters to Juliet and now Just Wright, have all been very tasty films and were all rated PG.The adorable Queen Latifah who is one of the few people in Hollywood you can tell has a good soul just by looking at her; stars as Leslie Wright. All of Leslie's life, she has been the `friend' to charming and available guys. No one has ever wanted to be more than that with her in the end, and to add insult to injury, guys tend to fall for her best friend Morgan (Paula Patton).Morgan is indeed beautiful, but then so is Leslie, and only an idiot wouldn't be able to smell Morgan's BS from a mile away. But then again there are a lot of idiots in the world, so this makes it easier for those of us with two or more brain cells watching, to accept this in the film.To call Morgan high maintenance would be the understatement of the century. At least she is honest with Leslie about her intentions however, which was one of two small problems I had with this great film.The first being that I just can't buy that Leslie would after all these years be friends with someone so manipulative and deceitful. Morgan has made it her mission in life, to wed a cash flow. Whereas Leslie you see, is basically every bit as sweet as the real Queen Latifah.After Morgan fills Leslie in on her plan to snag an NBA player as her ATM of a husband, Leslie just so happens to run into such a man at a gas station following a game. His name is Scott McKnight and he plays for the Nets; which coincidentally is the team that Leslie is nuts about.Common plays Scott, and the enthrallment is there from the get-go between both the actors and the characters they portray and lasts all the way till the credits. Taken aback by Leslie's unique charm, Scott invites her to a party.Naturally, Leslie brings Morgan along with her, and Scott finds her intriguing. Morgan plays Scott like a fiddle and soon enough they are dating. Being such a sweetheart, Leslie is happy for Morgan and allows this to go on when Morgan expresses that she is truly developing feelings for Scott.Leslie is a physical therapist and when Scott gets injured on the court, he hires her to move in and take care of him. Based on the description of Morgan's character and the necessary formula of romantic comedies, you can guess where it goes from there.And it does go there, but we really enjoy the ride it takes us on along the way. The film doesn't force the inevitable down our throats, but slowly and innovatively leads us to the romance of Scott and Leslie.I mentioned earlier that there were only two small problems I had with the film. The second one takes place in the third act and involves a ridiculous decision made by Scott. It took my like for the character down a notch or two, but those are tiny notches and both of these problems I had were minuscule to the overall effect the film had.I've had my eye on Paula Patton for quite some time now; ever since I saw her in D&eacute;j&agrave; vu.

1366071,AETMW32J8CZJU,B003UEYBK8,C. Young,"[6, 15]","This has got to be the worst romantic comedy movie of the year, and as a romantic comedy fan, I've seen a few recently.  Leap Year, When in Rome -- these all feature annlying, dits, TSTL heroines and visual and verbal gags that are supposed to be funny but aren't.  ""Just Wright"" has none of these - thank god - but instead, its failure to please comes from a cliched plot, a bad performance by the leading man, and dialogue that sounds like it came from the creative writing project of a 6th grader.Take, for example, the scene where Queen Latifah's Leslie Wright meets Common's NBA superstar Scott McKnight.  This is a man who has probably been chased by every other woman under the sun, and how does she grab his attention?  By proclaiming herself a fan and telling him which side of the car his gas tank is on.  That is refreshing because no woman has ever approached him and proclaimed herself a fan before?  And then, since the screenwriter is so desperate to manufacture a connection between Leslie and Arthur, she tells him that she's a Joanie Mitchell fan?  Really?  In how many movies have we seen Joanie Mitchell used just for such a purpose?  The laziness the screenwriter exhibited here is just insulting to the viewers.And then, when Latifah's Leslie finnally goes to Arthur's party and was on the verge of gaining his interest, her godsister Morgan shows up with her homeless shelter volunteer routine and Arthur is immediately smitten.  Again, he's a hotshot NBA star who has presumably been chased by God knows how many women, and he falls for a stunt like this?  How stupid is he?  Later, he does redeem himself for a portion of the film as we see him get to know Leslie better and fall for her.  But as soon as Morgan comes back with her drivel about how her sad childhood, he falls for it again?  How is a viewer supposed to care about a leading man so clearly lacking in the IQ department?  And the fact that Common can't act his way out of a paperbag does not help either, no matter how endearing Queen Latifah is as Leslie.Cliched plots can sometimes be made to work, if the movie features characters you can root for and dialogue that sounds a tad more professional than something conjured up by a 12 year old.  Unfortunately, this movie features 1 likable character (Latifah's Leslie), an intellectually challenged leading man played by an exceedingly bad actor, and amateurish dialogue that any 8th grade English teacher would have winced upon reading.  The only good thing I can say about the whole experience is that I chose to watch this on DVD instead of in the theaters.",1,Predictible and Boring,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,2601,"['got', 'be', 'worst', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'year', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'recently', 'Leap', 'Year', 'When', 'Rome', 'feature', 'annlying', 'dits', 'TSTL', 'heroines', 'visual', 'verbal', 'gags', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'are', ""n't"", 'Just', 'Wright', 'none', 'thank', 'god', 'instead', 'failure', 'please', 'cliched', 'plot', 'bad', 'performance', 'leading', 'man', 'dialogue', 'came', 'creative', 'writing', 'project', '6th', 'grader.Take', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Leslie', 'Wright', 'Common', 'NBA', 'superstar', 'Scott', 'McKnight', 'man', 'who', 'probably', 'been', 'chased', 'other', 'woman', 'sun', 'how', 'grab', 'attention', 'proclaiming', 'fan', 'telling', 'side', 'car', 'gas', 'tank', 'refreshing', 'woman', 'ever', 'approached', 'proclaimed', 'fan', 'then', 'screenwriter', 'so', 'desperate', 'manufacture', 'connection', 'Leslie', 'Arthur', 'Joanie', 'Mitchell', 'fan', 'Really', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'Joanie', 'Mitchell', 'used', 'just', 'such', 'purpose', 'laziness', 'screenwriter', 'exhibited', 'here', 'just', 'insulting', 'viewers.And', 'then', 'when', 'Latifah', 'Leslie', 'finnally', 'Arthur', 'party', 'was', 'verge', 'gaining', 'interest', 'godsister', 'Morgan', 'up', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'volunteer', 'routine', 'Arthur', 'immediately', 'smitten', 'Again', 'hotshot', 'NBA', 'star', 'who', 'presumably', 'been', 'chased', 'God', 'how', 'many', 'women', 'stunt', 'How', 'stupid', 'Later', 'redeem', 'portion', 'film', 'see', 'get', 'know', 'Leslie', 'better', 'fall', 'as', 'soon', 'Morgan', 'back', 'drivel', 'how', 'sad', 'childhood', 'again', 'How', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'care', 'leading', 'man', 'so', 'clearly', 'lacking', 'IQ', 'department', 'fact', 'Common', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'paperbag', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'matter', 'how', 'endearing', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Leslie.Cliched', 'plots', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'made', 'work', 'movie', 'characters', 'can', 'root', 'dialogue', 'tad', 'more', 'professional', 'something', 'conjured', 'up', '12', 'year', 'old', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', '1', 'likable', 'character', 'Latifah', 'Leslie', 'intellectually', 'challenged', 'leading', 'man', 'played', 'exceedingly', 'bad', 'actor', 'amateurish', 'dialogue', '8th', 'grade', 'English', 'teacher', 'would', 'have', 'winced', 'reading', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'whole', 'experience', 'chose', 'watch', 'DVD', 'instead', 'theaters']",N/A

JUST WRIGHT is a predictable, formulaic, cliche-ridden rom-com; it's ""twist"" is the male romantic love interest happens to be an NBA superstar.  (And Queen Latifah's character just happens to be a very capable physical therapist--can we guess where the plot is going?)  But being an NBA fan, and furthermore being the fact several NBA stars appear in cameos as themselves (Dwight Howard, Dwayne Wade, and Rajon Rondo to name but a few), there is just enough sporting interest to keep me from having to turn in my man card watching this film.Physical therapist Leslie Wright (Queen Latifah) has a heart of gold, and no pretenses when it comes to romance.  And neither does her gorgeous best pal (a stunning Paula Patton), who is forever on the prowl for a bigtime sugar daddy.  She finds one in New Jersey Nets All-Star (which is some sort of oxymoron, isn't it?) Scott McKnight (a very subdued Common), who falls for the manipulative friend at first sight--but who unceremoniously gets dumped by said friend upon suffering a career-threatening injury.  Enter therapist Leslie, and a tender romance begins to bud, only to be challenged when scheming friend enters the triangle again--and we're left to wonder how long Scott will need to realize Leslie is the right woman for him.  Again, it's all predictable, with as many tender and humorous moments as annoying ones, making JUST WRIGHT a rom-com watchable enough to make you want to take in an NBA playoff game.  I'm still chuckling seeing an obvious New York in springtime when the film's setting calls for the NBA All-Star game, which is played in the dead of February.  That global warming is just brutal.--D.

Understandable and acceptable, albeit unlikely, because that's what the target audience wants and demands of this genre.The problems with this movie reside, however, in the same lazy script.  It's not the love story so much as the inclusion of the pro basketball player, a guy who has been a superstar in the league for nearly a decade.  There is no way an A-lister like this, a well-mannered bachelor, a guy who has no ex-wives, criminal past, or posse, is going to A] Fall for Morgan's weak money-grubbing, marry a pro basketball player scheme (He's seen it all before.  She would have been used and dismissed like the whore she is.), or B] Eventually end up with Leslie.  Sorry, I've seen pro athletes' wives, and by comparison Leslie/Latifah doesn't have a leg to stand on.  Speaking of that, are we really supposed to believe that McKnight tore his PCL and it's career threatening?  Really?  I champagne-corked my MCL and ACL in a snowboarding crash and was back running within 6-months.  Of course, an even bigger travesty in this movie is the preposterous nature of McKnight's return to the game.If the Nets made it to the Conference Championships (big if considering the team and management) without their star McKnight, there is no way they insert him into the lineup during game 7.  The guy hasn't played all year, isn't in ""game shape,"" and he'd be winded the first time down the court.  It gets completely laughable when the coaches actively try to retear his knee, and break his ankles, by assigning him to D-up Wade.  Gimme a break.Personally, rather than a sloppily written love triangle I would have much preferred more on the triangle-defense, but I imagine this is perfect for the target audience.Jason Elin",2,MALE P.O.V. - Predictably lazy plot perfect for the target audience...but the basketball aspect is atrocious,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,2758,"['Say', 'what', 'want', 'rom-com', 'include', 'anything', 'athletically', 'related', 'script', 'order', 'suck', 'diverse', 'audience', 'read', 'date', 'movie', 'then', 'expect', 'have', 'aspect', 'movie', 'criticized', 'First', 'paint-by-numbers', 'script', 'Laslie', 'Latifah', 'overlooked', 'physical', 'therapist', 'who', 'NJ', 'Nets', 'When', 'are', 'together', 'gorgeous', 'gold-digging', 'friend', 'Morgan', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'always', 'guys', 'Enter', 'Scott', 'McKnight', 'Common', 'pro', 'basketball', 'player', 'NJ', 'Nets', 'how', 'convenient', 'Party', 'follow', 'Morgan', 'McKnight', 'injured', 'game', 'Guess', 'who', 'there', 'nurse', 'injury', 'psyche', 'regard', 'movie', 'well', 'female', 'audience', 'Going', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'relationship', 'strife', 'pitting', 'catty', 'female', 'viewers', 'Morgan', 'more', 'jealousy', 'actual', 'actions', 'less', 'desirable', 'woman', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'man', 'dreams', 'nothing', 'moreJust', 'Friendswith', 'sexes', 'reversed', 'races', 'changed', 'Understandable', 'acceptable', 'albeit', 'unlikely', 'what', 'target', 'audience', 'demands', 'genre.The', 'problems', 'movie', 'reside', 'however', 'same', 'lazy', 'script', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'inclusion', 'pro', 'basketball', 'player', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'superstar', 'league', 'nearly', 'decade', 'way', 'A-lister', 'well-mannered', 'bachelor', 'guy', 'who', 'ex-wives', 'criminal', 'past', 'posse', 'going', 'A', ']', 'Fall', 'Morgan', 'weak', 'money-grubbing', 'marry', 'pro', 'basketball', 'player', 'scheme', 'seen', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'dismissed', 'whore', 'B', ']', 'Eventually', 'end', 'up', 'Leslie', 'Sorry', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pro', 'athletes', 'wives', 'comparison', 'Leslie/Latifah', ""n't"", 'have', 'leg', 'stand', 'Speaking', 'are', 'really', 'supposed', 'believe', 'McKnight', 'tore', 'PCL', 'career', 'threatening', 'Really', 'champagne-corked', 'MCL', 'ACL', 'snowboarding', 'crash', 'was', 'back', 'running', '6-months', 'course', 'even', 'bigger', 'travesty', 'movie', 'preposterous', 'nature', 'McKnight', 'return', 'game.If', 'Nets', 'made', 'Conference', 'Championships', 'big', 'considering', 'team', 'management', 'star', 'McKnight', 'way', 'insert', 'lineup', 'game', '7', 'guy', ""n't"", 'played', 'year', ""n't"", 'game', 'shape', ""'d"", 'be', 'winded', 'first', 'time', 'down', 'court', 'completely', 'laughable', 'when', 'coaches', 'actively', 'try', 'retear', 'knee', 'break', 'ankles', 'assigning', 'D-up', 'Wade', 'Gim', 'break.Personally', 'rather', 'sloppily', 'written', 'love', 'triangle', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'more', 'triangle-defense', 'imagine', 'perfect', 'target', 'audience.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

Boy chases girl. Boy gets girl. Boy dogs girl. Boy makes it better. The end. While other friends and family around me were just dying for the release date of this film, I wasn't going to see it. However, when I saw Common and Queen Latifah (fake?) flirting it up on ""The Mo'Nique Show,"" I found them entertaining. They sure did look believable, so it made me want to see them in action. I saw the film. I won't lie to you. It is about as predictable as you would guess. Leslie is the girl's guy, the next-door-neighbor style lady who is chummy with all the guys but they don't really get a spark out of her. She's every guy's best friend who's a girl but not girlfriend material.But her roommate Morgan (Paula Patton) knows what to wear and what to do to sink her teeth into a man. Her eyes are set on Scott McKnight (Common), and he of course chases her. She badly wants to be a basketball wife and is thrilled when he proposes. A little bit later, he has an injury on the court. Leslie is a physical therapist. Guess who ends up being his physical therapist? Whatever you believe happens after that is probably true. Now if I based my rating on the plot, it'd be one star, maybe two.But what I did like was the chemistry between Queen Latifah and Common on film. I didn't think Paula Patton was very good at playing a golddigger and manipulator. She just looked too happy and had this glow on her face the entire time, that kind of glow pregnant women have or a woman who has been sexed up really good. I think she was great in ""Precious"" but playing the villain wasn't convincing. But again, it was entertaining watching the two rapper actors prove that they are just as talented at both. The jazz scenes were great for me. I loved those! I could've watched the piano and singing performance all day.Another great part of the film for me was watching Phylicia Rashad (who played Scott's mother) and James Pickens Jr. (who played Leslie's father) on the screen. These two veteran actors were great to watch as usual, and I liked their movie relationship with the two main characters.It was a cute film but if not for these particular characters, it would've been a bust.

What that means is that I need a reason to have to lie around uninterrupted and watch this movie repeatedly! This was such a cute movie that I bought it and I do watch it over and over again when I can. It's cute because it's a love story about a famous basketball player (Common) who falls in love with his physical therapist (Queen Latifah).  Now this physical therapist met him at a gas station first but he's caught up in the eye candy of Latifah's God-sister (Paula Patton) when he sees her with Latifah at his own party. I totally love the storyline with Latifah's character being more homegirl than girlfriend material because that's a very believable character for her. I can only rank it 4 stars out of 5 because---well, Common isn't the best actor. Sorry! I hope he keeps practicing because I did enjoy watching him as a love interest. I disagree with other reviewers that there was no chemistry between Common and Latifah. A 2nd reason for 4 stars, the one thing that really bothered me was Latifah (although I was definitely routing for her) was really getting her God-sister's leftovers.

1366133,A9OQJEMY20JO9,B003UEYBK8,T. Tillson,"[4, 8]","SPOILER ALERT!!!!!We usually like Queen Latifah's movies so we were ready to like this one.  And we did, up until she and Scott slept together.  Unlike another reviewer, we did not think this movie was appropriate for young children, or for anyone whose convictions lead them to believe that sex is for marriage only.  QL's character, Leslie, is a lovely woman - strong, independent, funny, kind, warm and caring.  Same for Common's character, Scott McKnight.  But when they finally realize their strong attraction, based on a good time of getting to know each other and on common interests, they have one date and then they have sex.I know many people have no problem with this part of the storyline but we do.  That one scene, along with the plot line that McKnight's fiance moves in with him (no sex seen but implied as they are living together), makes this movie difficult to recommend to our friends.Aside from that, we did enjoy watching the two leads interact and found their romance to be quite convincing.Please don't leave comments about my being a prude.
