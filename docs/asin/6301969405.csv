280872,A1VQBHHXIKHIGS,6301969405,A Customer,"[2, 8]","This is the most hilarious film I've seen in a long time. However, it's not deliberately funny. It's a ""drama"" set in ""China"" before and after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. White folks pretending to be yellow! Every stereotype about China that I'm aware of, scrunched into a single movie. William Muni, as Wang Long, looked like Frank Sinatra with a queue and pajamas. (I knew the Qing fell when his queue wig vanished.) Luise Rainer won an Oscar and I can't explain why.The Oscar for cinematography was probably deserved. They did a lot of filming in Chinatown, which gives it an authentic look, and they spared no expense in the scene with the plague of locusts. They tried their best to keep out any Chinese actors, but a few slipped through. Some wore Shaoxing felt hats, even though the setting wasn't Shaoxing. I could point out petty stuff like that all day, but why? If you see this one listed in your TV Guide, or you find a copy cheap, buy it. You'll giggle more than William Muni, a.k.a.

280874,A34HEERDCR5UTU,6301969405,Allan Life,"[2, 4]","Viewers with an affinity for Irving Thalberg's blockbusters should enjoy this prolonged sojourn in Thalberg's China.  It boasts masterful cinematography by Karl Freund, the best of Paul Muni's ""big"" roles of the later 30s, and an earnest script that countered the sinophobic productions of the same studio.  It established common, agrarian ground between Americans and East Asians.  All very praiseworthy in the America of 1937, and still commendable today.  However, works of art transcend their date of origin by doing something incomparably well, and in the seven decades since its creation, ""The Good Earth"" has been surpassed on every front.  China has its own cinematic tradition, with Asian actors at least as accomplished as the Caucasians starred in ""The Good Earth.""  Why suffer through Luise Rainer's one-note dirge when you can savor the profound nuance brought by, e.g., Gong Li to similar roles?  Even in the thirties, Shanghai boasted Ruan Lingyu, a film actress every bit as great as Ms. Rainer was fancied by Hollywood to be (for confirmation, you need only view ""The Goddess"" of 1934, now available on an archival DVD).  As for the most durable virtue of ""The Good Earth,"" its splendid photography, this film alone confirms Karl Freund as a master.  Well, so was Kazuo Miyagawa, to name just one of the Asian cinematographers whose careers commenced in the thirties.  Why rest content with a Thomas Hart Benton-style canvas of East Asia when you can penetrate analogous scenes through the genius of a Mizoguchi or a Kurosawa or a Yimou Zhang?  Finally, in comparison to the work of such Asian filmmakers, ""The Good Earth"" is unpersuasive in its moral perspective, which ends up being self-righteously ethical.  The Hollywood of Louis Mayer and Harry Cohn would slobber sympathetically over ""rustics"" (of the West no less than the East) confronting famine and flood, only to cluck piously when the same rubes aspired to cultivate an agribusiness and emulate the hedonism of studio moguls.  Casting Charlie Grapewin, a supposed emblem of rural simplicity, as a Chinese patriarch reinforces this association with Sunset Boulevard agrarianism.",4,"Good, indeed! ... but is this trip necessary?",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,2157,"['Viewers', 'affinity', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'blockbusters', 'should', 'enjoy', 'prolonged', 'sojourn', 'Thalberg', 'China', 'masterful', 'cinematography', 'Karl', 'Freund', 'best', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'big', 'roles', 'later', '30s', 'earnest', 'script', 'countered', 'sinophobic', 'productions', 'same', 'studio', 'established', 'common', 'agrarian', 'ground', 'Americans', 'East', 'Asians', 'very', 'praiseworthy', 'America', '1937', 'still', 'commendable', 'today', 'However', 'works', 'art', 'transcend', 'date', 'origin', 'doing', 'something', 'incomparably', 'well', 'seven', 'decades', 'creation', 'Good', 'Earth', 'been', 'surpassed', 'front', 'China', 'own', 'cinematic', 'tradition', 'Asian', 'actors', 'least', 'as', 'accomplished', 'Caucasians', 'starred', 'Good', 'Earth', 'Why', 'suffer', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'one-note', 'dirge', 'when', 'can', 'savor', 'profound', 'nuance', 'brought', 'e.g.', 'Gong', 'Li', 'similar', 'roles', 'Even', 'thirties', 'Shanghai', 'boasted', 'Ruan', 'Lingyu', 'film', 'actress', 'bit', 'as', 'great', 'Ms.', 'Rainer', 'was', 'fancied', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'confirmation', 'need', 'only', 'view', 'Goddess', '1934', 'now', 'available', 'archival', 'DVD', 'most', 'durable', 'virtue', 'Good', 'Earth', 'splendid', 'photography', 'film', 'alone', 'Karl', 'Freund', 'master', 'Well', 'so', 'was', 'Kazuo', 'Miyagawa', 'name', 'just', 'one', 'Asian', 'cinematographers', 'careers', 'commenced', 'thirties', 'Why', 'rest', 'content', 'Thomas', 'Hart', 'Benton-style', 'canvas', 'East', 'Asia', 'when', 'can', 'penetrate', 'analogous', 'scenes', 'genius', 'Mizoguchi', 'Kurosawa', 'Yimou', 'Zhang', 'Finally', 'comparison', 'work', 'such', 'Asian', 'filmmakers', 'Good', 'Earth', 'unpersuasive', 'moral', 'perspective', 'up', 'being', 'self-righteously', 'ethical', 'Hollywood', 'Louis', 'Mayer', 'Harry', 'Cohn', 'would', 'slobber', 'sympathetically', 'rustics', 'West', 'no', 'less', 'East', 'confronting', 'famine', 'flood', 'only', 'cluck', 'piously', 'when', 'same', 'rubes', 'aspired', 'cultivate', 'agribusiness', 'emulate', 'hedonism', 'studio', 'moguls', 'Casting', 'Charlie', 'Grapewin', 'supposed', 'emblem', 'rural', 'simplicity', 'Chinese', 'patriarch', 'association', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'agrarianism']",N/A

And I will even assume that the movie-makers did the best they could with the material for 1937. But watching Caucasian actors play out what I believe are basically stereotypes, and insulting ones at that, can become very tedious. I could not watch this film with the eyes of a 1937 audience.It has drama, humor, and even tenderness. It has a fat old uncle who is lazy and greedy and deceitful who is no doubt intended to be comic relief.

280890,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,6301969405,David Bower,"[1, 1]","I first read ""The Good Earth"" as a child and was deeply moved by the mental pictures it generated. The memories of this book have remained a part of my life ever since and certain scenes as described in the book still remain. For some reason I had never seen the movie until two nights ago and watched it in two installments.The movie was a monumental undertaking in 1937 and was the last production by the amazing Irving Thalberg whose name appeared in memoriam in the credits as he had died shortly before the completion of the film. There is virtually nothing about the creation of the book or the movie that is not filled with drama.The life of Pearl Buck, the writing of the story in Nanking, China in 1931, her return to the United States in 1935 after the take-over of China by the Communists, the decision by Thalberg to make a movie out of Buck's best selling Pulitzer Prize winning novel (1932); there is nothing but drama and excitement surrounding every aspect of the story and the movie which brings it to the screen.Having lived most of her early life in China, and being a fluent speaker of Chinese, Pearl Buck had experienced personally many of the dramatic events portrayed in the movie. Just a little research on line will convey an amazing story of the amazing people involved in the making of this movie.This movie is a classic treasure which, although dated in some respects, conveys a powerful message of life and living. I recommend it highly. There is an authenticity to the story which, when you understand the author's personal background and experience in China, is completely understandable.I would suggest, if there is any interest in appreciating the movie to its fullest, that some time be invested in researching the life of Pearl Buck, Irving Thalberg, and the movie, ""The Good Earth"" before actually watching it; I believe that will pay great dividends to those who care about such things.",5,A Remarkable Movie Based on a Remarkable Book,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1923,"['first', 'read', 'Good', 'Earth', 'child', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'mental', 'pictures', 'generated', 'memories', 'book', 'have', 'remained', 'part', 'life', 'ever', 'certain', 'scenes', 'described', 'book', 'still', 'remain', 'reason', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'two', 'nights', 'ago', 'watched', 'two', 'installments.The', 'movie', 'was', 'monumental', 'undertaking', '1937', 'was', 'last', 'production', 'amazing', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'name', 'appeared', 'memoriam', 'credits', 'had', 'died', 'shortly', 'completion', 'film', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'creation', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'filled', 'drama.The', 'life', 'Pearl', 'Buck', 'writing', 'story', 'Nanking', 'China', '1931', 'return', 'United', 'States', '1935', 'take-over', 'China', 'Communists', 'decision', 'Thalberg', 'make', 'movie', 'Buck', 'best', 'selling', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', '1932', 'nothing', 'drama', 'excitement', 'surrounding', 'aspect', 'story', 'movie', 'screen.Having', 'lived', 'most', 'early', 'life', 'China', 'being', 'fluent', 'speaker', 'Chinese', 'Pearl', 'Buck', 'had', 'experienced', 'personally', 'many', 'dramatic', 'events', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'Just', 'little', 'research', 'line', 'will', 'convey', 'amazing', 'story', 'amazing', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'classic', 'treasure', 'dated', 'respects', 'conveys', 'powerful', 'message', 'life', 'living', 'recommend', 'highly', 'authenticity', 'story', 'when', 'understand', 'author', 'personal', 'background', 'experience', 'China', 'completely', 'understandable.I', 'would', 'suggest', 'interest', 'appreciating', 'movie', 'fullest', 'time', 'be', 'invested', 'researching', 'life', 'Pearl', 'Buck', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'movie', 'Good', 'Earth', 'actually', 'watching', 'believe', 'will', 'pay', 'great', 'dividends', 'who', 'care', 'such', 'things']",N/A
280891,A1QJC4OTICYGJY,6301969405,D. Parisi,"[8, 9]","The Good Earth is a curio amongst 1930s films. It is a wonderful adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's famous novel about Chinese peasant farmers and their struggle to succeed and prosper. The lead characters are, for the most part, portrayed by white stars. (But the performances are so good that film studies classes that I have shown this film to have not been able to tell.) The story is engrossing, the music is authentic, the cinematography is breathtaking, the script is intelligent, the acting is magnificent, and the result is a triumphant masterpiece.The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung, the farmer. The picture opens on his wedding day, as he awakes, eager and excited about his arranged marriage soon to take place. Later, he meets his wife, O-Lan, and they work hard together, have numerous children, and become successful. But a devastating famine nearly starves their entire community, and the family is forced to migrate. While away, the Revolution occurs, and the characters get caught right in the middle of the sweep and emotion of the times. Thanks to a lucky discovery, the Lung family returns to their home and again amasses great wealth. However, this newfound abundance of riches tears Wang away from the land he once so dearly treasured, as he becomes more interested in material things. Then, a horrible plague of locusts threatens to ruin the town&#65533;s crop a second time, and Wang&#65533;s eldest son helps to organize the farmers in defeating the insects. In one of thirties cinema&#65533;s most spectacular scenes, the devastating locusts swarm into the valley and the townspeople do all in their power to halt their destruction. They use fire to burn them, water to drown them, and eventually must resort to using their hands and shovels to stop them. This event gives Wang a &#65533;wake-up call&#65533; as he realizes all he has neglected. He returns to the good earth and patches up the problems that have risen in his personal life. The picture closes on the eve of his son&#65533;s wedding, as he reminisces with the dyingO-Lan of their own wedding and eternal love. And as O-Lan slips into death, he finally realizes that she is the greatest, most loyal companion he could have ever asked for. &#65533;I&#65533;d sell all my land if I could heal you,&#65533; he tells his wife. Mustering up all her final strength to reply to him, she says &#65533;No. I would not let you, for I must die sometime, but the land will be there after me.&#65533; Wang goes out upon his vast land and stands beside the peach tree O-Lan planted on the night of their wedding, as he surveys the earth which has been so good to him all these years.Sidney Franklin, who directed the film, made many memorable pictures, but he is not a great director. Luise Rainer still swears by him as one of the most understanding directors she has worked with. His ability to pull a performance out of his stars is where he had great talent, but the other aspects of his direction seem to lack originality. Still, every other aspect of The Good Earth more than compensates for this. The special effects, the camera-work, and the performances are first rate. Paul Muni, as Wang, is fantastic, but still it is Luise Rainer who lends to the film its most moving moments. As O-Lan, Rainer communicates countless emotions with her eyes and her gestures than even the greatest orator could never express. It&#65533;s no surprise that the actress won her second Oscar for the remarkable performance. She stole The Great Ziegfeld from William Powell and Myrna Loy (and won an Oscar for it, too), she grabbed Dramatic School from Paulette Goddard and Lana Turner, she purloined The Great Waltz from operatic diva Miliza Korjus, and in 1997, sixty years after she made The Good Earth, she took her ten minutes in The Gambler and overshadowed Michael Gambon and the rest of the cast. If for nothing else, The Good Earth is a great picture simply for her performance&#65533;but there&#65533;s so much more in it too.",5,Another Showcase for LUISE RAINER,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,4007,"['Good', 'Earth', 'curio', 'amongst', '1930s', 'films', 'wonderful', 'adaptation', 'Pearl', 'S.', 'Buck', 'famous', 'novel', 'Chinese', 'peasant', 'farmers', 'struggle', 'succeed', 'prosper', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'portrayed', 'white', 'stars', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'film', 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'engrossing', 'music', 'authentic', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'script', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'magnificent', 'result', 'triumphant', 'masterpiece.The', 'Good', 'Earth', 'story', 'Wang', 'Lung', 'farmer', 'picture', 'wedding', 'day', 'eager', 'excited', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'soon', 'take', 'place', 'Later', 'wife', 'O-Lan', 'work', 'hard', 'together', 'have', 'numerous', 'children', 'become', 'successful', 'devastating', 'famine', 'nearly', 'entire', 'community', 'family', 'forced', 'migrate', 'away', 'Revolution', 'characters', 'get', 'caught', 'right', 'middle', 'sweep', 'emotion', 'times', 'Thanks', 'lucky', 'discovery', 'Lung', 'family', 'returns', 'home', 'again', 'amasses', 'great', 'wealth', 'However', 'newfound', 'abundance', 'riches', 'tears', 'Wang', 'away', 'land', 'once', 'so', 'dearly', 'treasured', 'more', 'interested', 'material', 'things', 'Then', 'horrible', 'plague', 'locusts', 'threatens', 'ruin', 'town', '65533', 's', 'crop', 'second', 'time', 'Wang', '65533', 's', 'eldest', 'son', 'organize', 'farmers', 'defeating', 'insects', 'one', 'thirties', 'cinema', '65533', 'most', 'spectacular', 'scenes', 'devastating', 'locusts', 'swarm', 'valley', 'townspeople', 'do', 'power', 'halt', 'destruction', 'use', 'fire', 'burn', 'water', 'drown', 'eventually', 'must', 'resort', 'using', 'hands', 'shovels', 'stop', 'event', 'Wang', '65533', 'wake-up', 'call', '65533', 'neglected', 'good', 'earth', 'up', 'problems', 'have', 'risen', 'personal', 'life', 'picture', 'eve', 'son', '65533', 's', 'wedding', 'dyingO-Lan', 'own', 'wedding', 'eternal', 'love', 'O-Lan', 'death', 'finally', 'greatest', 'most', 'loyal', 'companion', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'asked', '65533', '65533', 'd', 'sell', 'land', 'could', 'heal', '65533', 'wife', 'Mustering', 'up', 'final', 'strength', 'reply', '65533', 'No', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'must', 'die', 'sometime', 'land', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'me.', '65533', 'Wang', 'out', 'vast', 'land', 'beside', 'peach', 'tree', 'O-Lan', 'planted', 'night', 'wedding', 'earth', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'years.Sidney', 'Franklin', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'made', 'many', 'memorable', 'pictures', 'not', 'great', 'director', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'understanding', 'directors', 'worked', 'ability', 'pull', 'performance', 'stars', 'where', 'had', 'great', 'talent', 'other', 'aspects', 'direction', 'seem', 'lack', 'originality', 'Still', 'other', 'aspect', 'Good', 'Earth', 'more', 'compensates', 'special', 'effects', 'camera-work', 'performances', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Wang', 'fantastic', 'still', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'who', 'film', 'most', 'moving', 'moments', 'O-Lan', 'Rainer', 'countless', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'gestures', 'even', 'greatest', 'orator', 'could', 'never', 'express', '65533', 's', 'surprise', 'actress', 'won', 'second', 'Oscar', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'stole', 'Great', 'Ziegfeld', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'won', 'Oscar', 'too', 'grabbed', 'Dramatic', 'School', 'Paulette', 'Goddard', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'purloined', 'Great', 'Waltz', 'operatic', 'diva', 'Miliza', 'Korjus', '1997', 'sixty', 'years', 'made', 'Good', 'Earth', 'took', 'ten', 'minutes', 'Gambler', 'overshadowed', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'rest', 'cast', 'nothing', 'else', 'Good', 'Earth', 'great', 'picture', 'simply', 'performance', '65533', '65533', 's', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'too']",N/A

280893,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301969405,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE GOOD EARTH (1937, 138 minutes, based on the novelThe Good Earthby Pearl S. Buck, English & Mandarin) is an original and stunning film, not to be confused with much later films of the same title.This last Irving Thalberg production took three years to complete--therefore bear in mind this was started in 1934!--and Thalberg wanted it to be a 100% Chinese cast! The idiotic claim still alive today is that there weren't enough Chinese actors to accomplish the feat.It stands, almost in a frightening way, as one of America's chief racist tributes. But I just cannot judge it in that way; Thalberg's heart and mind were totally in the right place, and this seems to be the only film that carries an actual Thalberg credit as producer. It was to be his last and in a way, it is dedicated to him. It also ought to be dedicated to Pearl S. Buck.As a person who is one-eighth Chinese, I despise and always will despise what is commonly called ""yellowface""--white people portraying Orientals--but I couldn't help being riveted by this weird, fantastic film. Paul Muni (a Ukrainian Jew whose real name was Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund) plays a northern Chinese farmer by the name of Wong Leung (Jimmy Stewart almost landed the role). As a backward country boy, Muni strikes one as creepy and semi-retarded.This was the common view of the Chinese by Americans for many generations.One day young Wong and his old father manage to obtain a kitchen slave (O-lan, played by Luise Rainer who got an Oscar for this role) to help around the farm, and young Wong ends up marrying her. In fact a prominent Chinese woman was dying to land the role of O-lan, but the evil old Hays Code prohibited people of different races to play man and wife.This story, set around the turn of the 20th century, then, revolves around the horrid hardships and eventual stellar success of the small farming family. Wong buys tremendous farming property over the years, ""inch by inch"", and eventually becomes supremely prosperous. His wife bears him two sons and a mentally retarded daughter.Intervening in these events are horrid famine, mass migration to the south of China, a locust plague (they managed to film a real plague!) and the revolution which ousted Mandarin rule. The effects and location (a California farm looking like China) are stunning, far ahead of their time, the acting is quite excellent except for the creepy Muni (I never did like him), and there is some subtle humor that is still fresh. This film, in spite of the Caucasian leads, conveys Chinese culture and even speech very effectively.Thank heavens most of the huge cast is Chinese. It is a tale of one ignorant man's rise to power and the insanity that power visits upon him--that is, until he is reminded what it is to be a real person again, and a real farmer. It is a touching and at times deeply disturbing lesson to watch as it unfolds. It reminded me of the Book of Job.The most powerful and beautiful performances here, however, cannot be overlooked: Wong's two unnamed sons, the elder played by my immortal favorite Keye Luke; the younger, a gorgeous man named Roland Lui (I suspect his real name was Liu). As stunning as Roland was, there is only one other film credit for him and I know nothing about the man.1944'sDragon Seed [VHS] (also originally written by Buck:Dragon Seed) starred Katharine Hepburn as a Chinese farming peasant, and aside from that year's Gregory Peck vehicleThe Keys of the Kingdom(see my review) I can't think of a thing that compares to EARTH. DRAGON SEED is almost a sequel to EARTH--and it is astonishing that Hepburn, who retains the record for most Oscars won by a lady, didn't get so much as a nod for DRAGON SEED.This film also couples nicely with KEYS OF THE KINGDOM, though Buck eventually did a trilogy including EARTH (but not including DRAGON SEED). Pearl S. Buck inspired a great deal and her work did American cinema a great good. In fact, it is hard to escape the feeling that many, many movies were inspired by her work of tremendous genius, and this film in particular.I can hardly think of anything with which to compare this--it almost seems like a Spielberg film only Spielberg himself never made anything this good. Neither did Kurosawa or anyone else. This is a film that I just might consider adding to my collection. It's just that I'm still not so sure I like all those yellowface New York accents overrunning the film.It strikes me that EARTH is one of the earliest and most powerful statements of racism in America that we have from the era. When Thalberg realized he would never be able to make a 'fully Chinese' film thanks to the meddling of Chiang Kai-shek, he knew he'd have to face the same bullying at home.When he cast the role of O-lan, the Hayes Code blocked his desire to have a Chinese actress (hence the stupidly jarring Teutonic accent of Luise Rainer). Even Paul Muni himself was a victim, having to totally shed his real Jewish name and identity, or else never rise to stardom. (Many people don't realize Muni was in the running to be ""the next Lon Chaney, Sr."" He never quite made it.)And all of that history is why you can't miss this excellent, sadly meddled-with movie. Aw, go on--do it for Irving.",5,"Chinese story, yellowface, Spielberg-before-Spielberg, Thalberg's final oeuvre",1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,5226,"['GOOD', 'EARTH', '1937', '138', 'minutes',

280895,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,6301969405,H. Snyder,"[1, 1]","Pearl S. Buck's sweeping novel of China, The Good Earth, was brought to the screen by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1937. Skillfully condensing the novel for the film version, MGM put on a display of nuanced acting by its stars, chaotic crowd scenes including a famine migration and a revolution, and creepy special effects such as the locust plague. The core of the story is the arranged marriage of farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni) and the kitchen slave from the Great House, O-Lan (Luise Rainer). Faithfully following the book, the film chronicles the pair's life from abject poverty to modest success, to the arrival of children; through drought, famine, relapse into poverty, flight to a large city in the south of China, war, and return to the land. Wang Lung's refusal to sell his land during the drought enables him ultimately to become a prosperous farmer-merchant, and to buy the distressed Great House. Here his appetites cannot resist the temptation of ""the woman"", and he begins to think differently of his plain and faithful companion of many years. Complications naturally follow.1936 and 1937 were great years for Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. In 1936, Rainer won the Oscar for Best Actress in The Great Zeigfeld, and Muni won Best Actor in The Story of Louis Pasteur. In 1937 Rainer scored a rare back-to-back win as Best Actress in The Good Earth, co-starring Muni; while another of Muni's films, The Life of Emile Zola, took the Oscar for Best Picture.The Good Earth performance of Walter Connolly as the lazy and conniving uncle of Wang Lung should be noted. He is so unctuous and oily that he is easy to dislike, exactly the effect intended by the script. Connolly was an accomplished character actor of the 1930s, appearing in Frank Capra's Academy Award-nominated Lady for a Day in 1933, as well as Capra's It Happened One Night, which swept all five of the major Academy Awards in 1934. Another notable character actor in The Good Earth is Charlie Grapewin, best know as Dorothy's Uncle Henry in Wizard of Oz (1939) and Grandpa Joad in Grapes of Wrath (1940). In The Good Earth he is Wang Lung's aged father.The DVD presentation is from a print in good condition, with little or no restoration having been done. The film skillfully mixes small-scale live action in interior scenes with epic outdoor crowd scenes. It has many sequences of rear-projection, with the actors in front of a screen showing background activity, but very well done so that it all fits together nicely. The drought and famine sequences rely heavily on stock footage of actual events in China, all integrated believably with the acted scenes. The quality of the black-and-white photography is indicated by the fact that The Good Earth won the 1937 Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The era of color photography in major films began the very next year in 1938 with Robin Hood, and was solidified in 1939 with Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.Considering its age, produced as it was during the first decade of the Hollywood sound era, The Good Earth is a very enjoyable film.

Everything in the film centres on the land, the &quot;good earth&quot;, which gives life and is something a man can call his own.  Rainer doesn't get much in the way of dialogue, but her expressive face makes up for it, and she gives a touching performance as the tired, sensible wife.  Paul Muni, an actor somewhat forgotten these days, has a few good moments, but doesn't make the kind of strong impression he made in so many other films in the 1930's.  He just doesn't seem right for this role.  As the father and uncle, Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly offer good support.

Nothing special there.His marriage to slave O-Lan is the best argument for arranged marriage I ever seen. Luise Rainer was a bit underwhelming. Their life is followed from poverty, sucess, starvation, wealth, moral weakness (his)  & plague with war thrown in. That revolution/civil war was very generic & not well defined. Probably because at the time of this movie Japan was at war with China. They were an ally, but Hollywood certainly didn't have a clue what was happening.

As yet, there is no DVD  but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, ""The Good Earth"" would have 'taken home' that award!The lovely Luise Ranier did  win ""Best Actress"" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck's novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in ""The Good Earth"" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for ""Oprah's Book Club"".  Perhaps women's rights advocates should also give it a boost?The story is about China in the 1900s.  A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is 'given' (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride.  I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier  had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the ""Ziegfield Follies"" -- what a contrast!  Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in ""eternal servitude.""  And her devotion was betrayed.  Partly through the machinations of ""Uncle"".  At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines & wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity.From the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan:  ""When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I'll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I'll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I'll show myself and my son to all of them.""  (Smiles, contented)Wang Lung:  ""Well... Now, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house.""Isn't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising & the production of many scenes quite amazing.  READ  Susan Wong's  wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com.Today's movie-goers don't seem to care about ""true life"" documentation in films,  but animation couldn't convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do!

And it seems ""The Good Earth"" suffers from this as well, unfortunately.One item that does come through the screen is the cinematography. Even though the film has been shot in black and white and is what is described as ""postage stamp"" (a square rather than wide screen), to get caught up in the landscape is easy. It is not difficult to imagine the squalor of the farmhouse that Wang Lung lives in and to compare that to the opulance of the fine house where O-lan has been a slave. When the Lung family is forced to move to the big city to survive, the viewer can truly feel the press of human bodies and the squalid living conditions. The filming of the locust attacking the farmer's fields is amazing. (A bit of trivia here: there actually was an attack during filming for the movie, so what is seen on the screen is truly real!)So, what could possibly detract? Unfortunately, the actors themselves. At least for me. Casting Paul Muni and Luise Ranier into the leading roles just doesn't work for me. However, it did when I first saw this movie, so go figure! Both are capable actors, so it isn't that. But both are so overwhelmingly Western that there is no possible way they can pass for Asian. And Luise Ranier's German/Austrian accent is nowhere near anything that remotely sounds like anything from the Asian continent. Perhaps that is why she says very little in the movie? Even more distracting is the actor playing the role of the grandfather, whose voice is immediately recognizable as the grandfather in ""The Grapes Of Wrath,"" and also as Uncle Henry in the ""Wizard of Oz."" What is distractingly funny is that all the children of the Lung household look very, very Asian. Now, I do understand that Paul Muni and Luise Ranier were established actors at the time. I do recognize that Irving Thalberg did want to cast all Chinese people into the roles, but there were not enough actors for the roles. And I do realize that, due to the Sino-Japanese War, China had stated refusal to allow filming if Japanese actors were used. (If they could do a world-wide search for Scarlett, why not find Asian actors?) But I feel it really does create a barrier in this movie that is otherwise well thought out and painstakingly presented.What would be ideal is if this movie could somehow be re-made, sensitively, more in line with the book (the book is more about Wang Lung, whereas the movie centers on O-lan), and include a cast that is representative of Chinese people - or at least Asian.Still, I do think this movie is a classic and has appeal. This movie also has a number of ""firsts:"" the first time an actress received back to back Oscars for Best Actress and the first (and only) time Irving Thalberg's name appeared onscreen in any movie (he died before this movie was completed). But this classic does have some flaws.",4,A Flawed Classic But Still A Classic,1169078400,"01 18, 2007",2007,3415,"['When', 'was', 'early', 'teens', 'first', 'read', 'novel', 'Pearl', 'S.', 'Buck', 'same', 'time', 'discovered', 'movie', 'TV', 'was', 'captivated', 'Just', 'earlier', 'year', 're-read', 'book', 'found', 'be', 'better', 'had', 'remembered', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'well.I', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'things', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'viewing', 'classic', 'era', 'remember', 'limitations', 'era', ""'m"", 'sure', '70', 'years', 'now', 'movies', 'consider', 'classics', 'will', 'pale', 'comparison', 'what', 'movie', 'viewers', 'consider', 'great', 'movie', 'Good', 'Earth', 'suffers', 'as', 'well', 'unfortunately.One', 'item', 'come', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'Even', 'film', 'been', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'what', 'described', 'postage', 'stamp', 'square', 'rather', 'wide', 'screen', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'landscape', 'easy', 'not', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'squalor', 'farmhouse', 'Wang', 'Lung', 'compare', 'opulance', 'fine', 'house', 'where', 'O-lan', 'been', 'slave', 'When', 'Lung', 'family', 'forced', 'move', 'big', 'city', 'survive', 'viewer', 'can', 'truly', 'feel', 'press', 'human', 'bodies', 'squalid', 'living', 'conditions', 'filming', 'locust', 'attacking', 'farmer', 'fields', 'amazing', 'bit', 'trivia', 'here', 'actually', 'was', 'attack', 'filming', 'movie', 'what', 'seen', 'screen', 'truly', 'real', 'So', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'detract', 'Unfortunately', 'actors', 'least', 'Casting', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Luise', 'Ranier', 'leading', 'roles', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'However', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'so', 'go', 'figure', 'are', 'capable', 'actors', ""n't"", 'that', 'are', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'Western', 'possible', 'way', 'can', 'pass', 'Asian', 'Luise', 'Ranier', 'German/Austrian', 'accent', 'nowhere', 'anything', 'remotely', 'anything', 'Asian', 'continent', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'very', 'little', 'movie', 'Even', 'more', 'distracting', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'grandfather', 'voice', 'immediately', 'recognizable', 'grandfather', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', 'also', 'Uncle', 'Henry', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'What', 'distractingly', 'funny', 'children', 'Lung', 'household', 'look', 'very', 'very', 'Asian', 'Now', 'do', 'understand', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Luise', 'Ranier', 'were', 'established', 'actors', 'time', 'do', 'recognize', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'did', 'want', 'cast', 'Chinese', 'people', 'roles', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'actors', 'roles', 'do', 'realize', 'due', 'Sino-Japanese', 'War', 'China', 'had', 'stated', 'refusal', 'allow', 'filming', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'were', 'used', 'could', 'do', 'world-wide', 'search', 'Scarlett', 'why', 'not', 'find', 'Asian', 'actors', 'feel', 'really', 'create', 'barrier', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'painstakingly', 'presented.What', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'movie', 'could', 'somehow', 'be', 're-made', 'sensitively', 'more', 'line', 'book', 'book', 'more', 'Wang', 'Lung', 'movie', 'centers', 'O-lan', 'include', 'cast', 'representative', 'Chinese', 'people', 'least', 'Asian.Still', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'classic', 'appeal', 'movie', 'also', 'number', 'firsts', 'first', 'time', 'actress', 'received', 'back', 'back', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Actress', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'name', 'appeared', 'onscreen', 'movie', 'died', 'movie', 'was', 'completed', 'classic', 'have', 'flaws']",N/A

After becoming prosperous Muni acquires a young second wife (Tilly Losch), an event which leads to considerable turmoil and scandal for him and his family.Performances by Muni and Rainer were excellent. Both incidentally were born in Austria. Rainer had already won an Oscar in 1936 for THE GREAT ZIEGFELD in only her second Hollywood role. Much has been made about the lack of Chinese actors in the lead roles but the fact that there were still so many Asian actors in the cast was rather unusual for the times. Soo Yong, Keye Luke and Roland Lui filled important supporting roles.Keye Luke plays Muni's elder son. He is best remembered for his numerous appearances in Charlie Chan movies. Luke is also respected for his fine acting in more than one hundred films and thirty television shows during a distinguished career which lasted over forty years.The movie was produced at the height of the Sino-Japanese War. The special effects were outstanding for that period just before the outbreak of World War II.THE GOOD EARTH received Oscars for Best Actress (Luise rainer) and Cinematography.

Nobel prize winner Pearl S. Buck was best known for her novels about Chinese life, especially 1931's THE GOOD EARTH which was awarded a Pulizer Prize. It's 1932 Broadway adaptation starred Claude Rains and Alla Nazimova as the the restless peasant farmer, who moves up from poverty to become a wealthy landowner, and his patient wife. This 1937 production cost just under 3 million dollars! The cinematographer was the legendary Karl Freund who was later lured out of semi-retirement (and paid scale!) by Desi Arnaz to film dozens of I LOVE LUCY episodes. THE GOOD EARTH continues to impress the viewer with its epic power, its fine performances, and the virtuosity of its technical accomplishments. For &quot;the world's largest set&quot;, 500 acres of the San Fernando Valley land were purchased and turned into a replica Chinese farm. Almost two million feet of atmospheric location footage was shot in China, some of which was used in the complex, technically amazing locust-plague sequence - which remains a masterpiece of montage and special-effects artistry. Both Paul Muni and Luise Rainer offered dedicated performances (although some critics noted that Muni sounded more and more like Muni as the film progressed). For Rainer's beautiful acting as O-Lan the academy gave her the AA; she was up against the likes of Garbo (for CAMILLE) and Stanwyck (STELLA DALLAS). Muni, dedicated technician though he was, considered himself miscast in the picture and never approved of his performance as Wang Lung.

280917,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301969405,Simon Davis,"[30, 32]","&quot;The Good Earth&quot; would have to go down in film history as probably one of the supreme efforts in 1930's film making with its attention to detail and special efforts really unrivalled at that time. The legendary Irving J. Thalberg, the force behind so many stunning MGM productions spent years in preparation on the film version of the acclaimed Pearl S. Buck's Pulizer Prize winning novel &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.Thalberg in his drive for absolute quality in movie making  actually had a film unit go to China and film some of the location shots which appear throughout the film to add authenticity. The film was given a staggering budget of over 3 million dollars which was unheard of at the time. The film also provided employment for countless Chinese extras and supporting performers for its long production schedule. Unfortunately after all the effort put into this work Irving Thalberg did not live to see the finished product and died just before its release. &quot;The Good Earth&quot; has the distinction of being the one production where Irving Thalberg's name actually appears on the credits. He normally refused to ever have his work acknowledged letting the film stand on its own merits but in this instance the film is dedicated to him which is a fitting tribute to a brilliant man, one of the most dedicated filmmakers Hollywood has produced.What makes &quot;The Good Earth' so special is first of all the magnificent cast and performers used and secondly the beautiful photography and exceptional special effects employed. Paul Muni and Luise Rainer are both excellent in their roles of peasant farmer Wang Lung and his freed slave wife O -Lan. I wont waste the readers time getting involved in the supposed issue of there being Caucasian actors as Chinese leads . All I can say is so what? Both are superb and if only those actors of particular races performed characters of their own race you would be deprived of some of the greatest acting performances in film history. The attempts at portraying Chinese characters via makeup etc here, as in another film &quot;Dragon Seed&quot; ,are fascinating and really add interest to the overraul production.Luise Rainer won the Academy Award that year for her role and was up against stiff competition from Greta Garbo and Barbara Stanwyck. She is exceptional as the former slave who undergoes years of hardship and deprivation to see her husband grow in prosperity and to produce 3 children and see them grow into adults. She is at times subdued, assertive, proud and determined and makes O-Lan a fully dimensional character. Alot of her performance is done with minimal dialogue which makes her character so much more memorable.Like any MGM production the supporting players play a great role in enhancing the overraul effect. Walter Connolly so often specialising in playing the bumbling father etc here plays Uncle, a character who has a devious streak but is not above using Wang Lung for his own selfish ends. Charley Grapewin is also very effective as Paul Muni's father a character who observes the comings and goings over the years with an observant and at time cynical eye. Jesse Ralph also scores in a very small role of &quot;Cuckoo&quot; the woman in charge of Rainer's character prior to her marriage who sees no good in anyone. Special mention must also be made to two fine young Chinese actors Keye Luke and in particular Roland Lui who play the two sons of Wang Lung. They have important roles in this production and really put paid to other reviewers arguing about no Asian actors being used in prominent roles in this production. Roland Lui has an important part to play when he falls in love with his own fathers mistress. I dont know what ever happened to this fine young actor but in this role he is excellent in his display of guilt and remorse.No review of &quot;The Good Earth&quot; would be complete without mention of the exceptional special effects. The splendid outdoor set spread over many acres in the San Fernando Valley was turned into rural China and is amazing in its realistic look. The Locust plague at the end of the film would have to be without a doubt one of the most stunning pieces of filmaking ever created right up there with the hurricane storm from 1937's &quot;The Hurricane&quot; It is so startlingly vivid in its realism that you feel that you are involved in it yourself and it leaves a strange feeling after having been viewed. The scenes of drought are also honest in their depiction of how it affects all living things whether it be plant, animal or human.The film covers a number of years in the two peoples lives and also covers many important events in China's history and reveals how they affected the ordinary farmers lives. We see the effects of the Chines revolution, years of drought, years of good harvests and prosperity. Indeed the earth itself is never very far from the centre of all the characters lives and determines their fortunes.Viewing &quot;The Good Earth&quot; is a memorable experience. It never fails to affect me by its sheer scale and look but it has the benefit of presenting along the way beautiful characterisations and small pieces of interest whether it be the birth of a child, a special meal, the planting of a fruit tree seed in the earth.The &quot;Earth&quot; as such directs this story and indeed  as the earth will go on enriching future generations so will this film masterpiece, a fitting last work for Irving Thalberg, continue to entertain and move generations of film lovers to come. In this way &quot;The Good Earth&quot; will be preserved for prosterity.",5,Superb MGM effort in every department,1022544000,"05 28, 2002",2002,5626,"['quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'would', 'have',

280919,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6301969405,Susan Fong,"[153, 156]","I am an American born Chinese, and I am very impressed by this exceptionally fine production of &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.  I am also not bothered by the casting of Caucasian actors, Paul Muni and Luise Rainer, in the lead roles.  This was an expensive production for MGM.  They understandably sought well-known stars who could draw audiences into movie theaters.  Muni and Rainer were both Oscar winners with the name recognition and prestige that MGM needed to make this project viable.I give enormous credit to Thalberg and MGM for hiring a mostly Chinese cast and for bringing a story about Chinese peasants to the screen in the first place.  In the 1930's, the world was much more provincial than it is today.  It took courage for MGM to undertake such a project as &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.As it turned out, the studio's foresight paid off because this movie achieved both critical and popular success when originally released.The 1937 version of &quot;The Good Earth&quot; most assuredly stands the test of time. As other reviewers have so eloquently expressed  here, every aspect of this production is superb with emphasis on the skillful direction and special effects.  The special effects in this movie are even more realistic than alot of the effects you see in today's movies.  Mercifully, they used REAL locusts in the 1937 version of &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.  If &quot;The Good Earth&quot; were filmed today, &quot;animatronic&quot; locusts or computer generated images of locusts would be used instead.  Those generally are not as convincing as the real thing.But what really sets this movie apart from other great films are the quality of the two lead performances by Paul Muni and Luise Rainer.  Muni's character, Wang Lung, is a poor, unsophisticated farmer.  Muni could have easily portrayed him as a caricatural &quot;hick from the sticks&quot; or as a bumbling ethnic stereotype.  Instead, he gives the farmer depth and universality as a decent, hardworking man who has not had the advantages of education or travel, but who wants to make life better for his family.  Wang Lung is basically a simple man, yet he is not simple-minded.  Muni is able to convey the keen intelligence and drive beneath the farmer's lack of worldly experience.Luise Rainer is a revelation as the farmer's wife, O-Lan.  O-Lan's quiet strength, selflessness, and dignity are poignantly suggested by the gifted Miss Rainer whose slightest gestures, glances, or whispers can make the audience feel tidal waves of empathy and emotion.I only wish that more people were familiar with this brilliant and ethereally beautiful actress.  Miss Rainer's performance as O-Lan seems to transcend acting and enter the realm of spiritualism.  It's truly one of the great performances by any actor in any medium.For that alone, you must see this movie.",5,You must see this movie,1073865600,"01 12, 2004",2004,2839,"['am', 'American', 'born', 'Chinese', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'exceptionally', 'fine', 'production', 'quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'am', 'also', 'not', 'bothered', 'casting', 'Caucasian', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'lead', 'roles', 'was', 'expensive', 'production', 'MGM', 'understandably', 'sought', 'well-known', 'stars', 'who', 'could', 'draw', 'audiences', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Muni', 'Rainer', 'were', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'name', 'recognition', 'prestige', 'MGM', 'needed', 'make', 'project', 'give', 'enormous', 'credit', 'Thalberg', 'MGM', 'hiring', 'mostly', 'Chinese', 'cast', 'bringing', 'story', 'Chinese', 'peasants', 'screen', 'first', 'place', '1930', 'world', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'provincial', 'today', 'took', 'courage', 'MGM', 'undertake', 'such', 'project', 'quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'turned', 'out', 'studio', 'foresight', 'paid', 'off', 'movie', 'achieved', 'critical', 'popular', 'success', 'when', 'originally', 'released.The', '1937', 'version', 'quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'most', 'assuredly', 'test', 'time', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'so', 'eloquently', 'expressed', 'here', 'aspect', 'production', 'superb', 'emphasis', 'skillful', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'realistic', 'alot', 'effects', 'see', 'today', 'movies', 'Mercifully', 'used', 'REAL', 'locusts', '1937', 'version', 'quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'quot', 'Good', 'Earth', 'quot', 'were', 'filmed', 'today', 'quot', 'animatronic', 'quot', 'locusts', 'computer', 'generated', 'images', 'locusts', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'instead', 'generally', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'convincing', 'real', 'thing.But', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'apart', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'are', 'quality', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'Luise', 'Rainer', 'Muni', 'character', 'Wang', 'Lung', 'poor', 'unsophisticated', 'farmer', 'Muni', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'portrayed', 'caricatural', 'quot', 'hick', 'sticks', 'quot', 'bumbling', 'ethnic', 'stereotype', 'Instead', 'farmer', 'depth', 'universality', 'decent', 'hardworking', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'had', 'advantages', 'education', 'travel', 'who', 'make', 'life', 'better', 'family', 'Wang', 'Lung', 'basically', 'simple', 'man', 'not', 'simple-minded', 'Muni', 'able', 'convey', 'keen', 'intelligence', 'drive', 'beneath', 'farmer', 'lack', 'worldly', 'experience.Luise', 'Rainer', 'revelation', 'farmer', 'wife', 'O-Lan', 'O-Lan', 'quiet', 'strength', 'selflessness', 'dignity', 'are', 'poignantly', 'suggested', 'gifted', 'Miss', 'Rainer', 'slightest', 'gestures', 'glances', 'whispers', 'can', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'tidal', 'waves', 'empathy', 'only', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'were', 'familiar', 'brilliant', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Miss', 'Rainer', 'performance', 'O-Lan', 'transcend', 'acting', 'enter', 'realm', 'spiritualism', 'truly', 'one', 'great', 'performances', 'actor', 'medium.For', 'alone', 'must', 'see', 'movie']",N/A
