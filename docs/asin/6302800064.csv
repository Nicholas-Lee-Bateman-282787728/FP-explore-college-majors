And today, time has not been so kind to it. It's a boring picture with a lot of overacting. The jokes aren't that subtle either. It's hard to take Jeff Daniels seriously as a psychoanalyst when he clearly doesn't know how to talk like one. That thing with Hector Elizondo as the sympathizer of guerilla warfare is way overboard. All in all, There Goes the Neighborhood is more like There Goes the Movie.",2,"Well, It Sucked.",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,520,"['Viewed', '3/13Rate', '33/13', 'saw', 'Neighborhood', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'today', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'kind', 'boring', 'picture', 'lot', 'overacting', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'hard', 'take', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'seriously', 'psychoanalyst', 'when', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'talk', 'one', 'thing', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'sympathizer', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'way', 'overboard', 'Neighborhood', 'more', 'Movie']",N/A

There was a good plot. Makes you wonder what could be buried under your cellar floor. (Not that I would recommend buying a sludge hammer and other tools to use to find out) and yet it offers a good break from reality. (Nah no one would purposely go out and do what these guys did!)Jeff Daniels starred in the movie. Rhae Purlman (from the tv series Cheers) was also in it. Both of them did a wonderful job with their acting.I will admit it was strange watching the movie on my KindleFire rather than on a television set. Still it was a great way to watch a movie that I have not seen in years and enjoy it.",5,There Goes the Neighborhood,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,864,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'tween', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'younger', 'watching', 'again', 'made', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'nudity', 'was', 'limited', 'amount', 'swearing', 'comparision', 'movies', 'are', 'released', 'today', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'buried', 'cellar', 'floor', 'Not', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'sludge', 'hammer', 'other', 'tools', 'use', 'find', 'out', 'yet', 'good', 'break', 'reality', 'Nah', 'one', 'would', 'purposely', 'go', 'out', 'do', 'what', 'guys', 'did', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'starred', 'movie', 'Rhae', 'Purlman', 'tv', 'series', 'Cheers', 'was', 'also', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'acting.I', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'strange', 'watching', 'movie', 'KindleFire', 'rather', 'television', 'set', 'Still', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'years', 'enjoy']",N/A

When people are added that have little or no script necessity there is a problem (Perlman, Coleman). Could've made the fugitives into a three stooges type of ineptness that might've added some degree of levity (with different actors...please!) but this was terrible. Not worth the plastic disk or vhs cassette materials. Daniels and O'Hara as love interest?
