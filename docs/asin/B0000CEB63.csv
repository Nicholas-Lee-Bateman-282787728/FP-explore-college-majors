However, this set is inferior to the first one for three reasons. First, the episode with Greer Garson is indistinguishable from the one in the first collection. Second, the listing of the episodes is different from the way they are presented on the DVDs. Finally, on the third DVD, they didn't have one of the regulars talk about his or her time on the show. This is the reason why I rated this collection so low, as it's always nice to hear the regulars' talking about their time on the show and there are still are a lot of them we haven't heard from.",1,They should have done a better job with this collection.,1086307200,"06 4, 2004",2004,635,"['Once', 'again', 'Rhino', 'put', 'out', 'collection', 'Rowan', 'Martin', 'Laugh-In', 'However', 'set', 'inferior', 'first', 'one', 'three', 'reasons', 'First', 'episode', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'indistinguishable', 'one', 'first', 'collection', 'Second', 'listing', 'episodes', 'different', 'way', 'are', 'presented', 'DVDs', 'Finally', 'third', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'regulars', 'talk', 'time', 'show', 'reason', 'why', 'rated', 'collection', 'so', 'low', 'always', 'nice', 'hear', 'regulars', 'talking', 'time', 'show', 'are', 'still', 'are', 'lot', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard']",N/A

And after awhile they stopped sending them. When i called they said they had not made anymore, and maybe some day they would. But so far, after a year, they never have. Then they put out the best of series. Which i admit, are not apart of the ones they had sent me in the beginning. But again, they leave you with so little and for so very much money!Many libraries offer the Rowan and Martin's Laugh in Best of Sets and i suggest renting them out and watching them instead of purchasing them. I am really disgusted with the company and how they put these things out.They should treat true fans a little better. I didn't watch too many of the original shows when they were on television as i wasn't old enough. But i have watched some when i was a teenager when they were on in reruns and i simply fell in love, 10 years after they were over with. And i still am.

776085,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0000CEB63,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Laugh-In was an incredibly funny show with a great deal of improvisation--in fact, there was probably more ""ad libbing"" than most people realize! The show was a real treat to watch back in the day; I always hoped my parents would let me stay up a little bit later to watch the show on television. Of course, with my being a child there were some jokes I didn't catch then that I easily understand and laugh at now; and that's great because the shows here provide high quality entertainment that hasn't diminished with time. Although the quality of the image is only average the jokes and guest star appearances more than make up for that and the sound quality lacks nothing.Unfortunately, however, this DVD set has a very real disappointment: they should have put more shows on these DVDs; and the ""extensive"" interviews are really only about 20 to 25 minutes each. I can't understand why Rhino never released the full seasons of the show; I think they would have sold nicely given the fact that all the material here is top notch comedy with high energy and a fast pace that would keep just about any professional comedian on their toes and reaching to achieve their full potential.The cast members include superlative performers such as Ruth Buzzi, Arte Johnson, Jo Anne Worley, Alan Sues, Goldie Hawn, Lily Tomlin and more. Danny Kaye, Peter Lawford, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Jack Benny, Greer Garson and Milton Berle are just some of the guest stars.As others have noted, if you just have to enjoy Laugh-In, then get this 3 DVD set and enjoy. Actually, I think you'll enjoy it over and over again especially if you liked Laugh-In then and also if you liked the type of ethnic humor that was permissible at the time. I guess some Laugh-In is better than no Laugh-In; but I really hope Rhino has a change of heart and releases all the full seasons of this hilarious show very soon. It predated and paved the way for shows like Saturday Night Live; Laugh-In deserves better treatment than this!",3,"great--as far as it goes, that is",1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1985,"['Laugh-In', 'was', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'show', 'great', 'deal', 'improvisation', 'fact', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'ad', 'libbing', 'most', 'people', 'realize', 'show', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'back', 'day', 'always', 'hoped', 'parents', 'would', 'let', 'stay', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'later', 'watch', 'show', 'television', 'course', 'being', 'child', 'were', 'jokes', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'then', 'easily', 'understand', 'laugh', 'now', 'great', 'shows', 'here', 'provide', 'high', 'quality', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'diminished', 'time', 'quality', 'image', 'only', 'average', 'jokes', 'guest', 'star', 'appearances', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'sound', 'quality', 'nothing.Unfortunately', 'however', 'DVD', 'set', 'very', 'real', 'disappointment', 'should', 'have', 'put', 'more', 'shows', 'DVDs', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'about', '20', '25', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Rhino', 'never', 'released', 'full', 'seasons', 'show', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'sold', 'nicely', 'given', 'fact', 'material', 'here', 'top', 'notch', 'comedy', 'high', 'energy', 'fast', 'pace', 'would', 'keep', 'just', 'professional', 'comedian', 'toes', 'reaching', 'achieve', 'full', 'potential.The', 'cast', 'members', 'include', 'superlative', 'performers', 'such', 'Ruth', 'Buzzi', 'Arte', 'Johnson', 'Jo', 'Anne', 'Worley', 'Alan', 'Sues', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'more', 'Danny', 'Kaye', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'Zsa', 'Zsa', 'Gabor', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'are', 'just', 'guest', 'stars.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'just', 'have', 'enjoy', 'Laugh-In', 'then', 'get', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'enjoy', 'Actually', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'over', 'again', 'especially', 'liked', 'Laugh-In', 'then', 'also', 'liked', 'type', 'ethnic', 'humor', 'was', 'permissible', 'time', 'guess', 'Laugh-In', 'better', 'Laugh-In', 'really', 'hope', 'Rhino', 'change', 'heart', 'full', 'seasons', 'hilarious', 'show', 'very', 'soon', 'predated', 'paved', 'way', 'shows', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Laugh-In', 'better', 'treatment']",N/A
776086,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0000CEB63,trebe,"[195, 203]","The second collection of episodes of Laugh-In, appears to be packaged in the same manner as Volume 1, which means that once more, the consumer is not receiving maximum value for their dollarA one-hour show, minus the commercials, has 45 to 50 minutes of programming.  A DVD easily holds over 200 minutes of material.  So in most recently released boxed sets for hour-long programs, you will routinely find DVD's containing four episodes.The three DVD Laugh-In set contains just six complete programs, along with some interview footage.  That's two episodes per disc (approximately 100 minutes), plus the bonus material.  Although the Laugh In discs contain much less than the maximum amount of material, the price of the set is relatively high.Rhino Video is certainly aware that the trend is to issue TV programs in boxed sets.  Other studios issue their sets with all kinds of bonus materials.  Rhino did a good job with The Monkees, choosing to issue the DVD sets by seasons, and including lots of extras.  But in the case of Laugh-In, they continue to offer mediocre sets that short change fans.  What are their real plans for this series?  Do they intend to issue all of the episodes?  Taking the ""best of"" approach, seems to indicate that they do not believe that interest in the series is great enough to justify issuing the program in complete season packages.  Perhaps so, but there can be no denying that the ""best of"" sets could easily have much more content.If you like Laugh-In enough to pay the premium per episode cost, by all means please enjoy.  However, realize that purchasing this set only encourages Rhino to continue this minimalist type of packaging.  If they ever do issue the program by complete seasons, you may regret the decision to buy.  If you are not getting a fair value, take a stand and keep saying ""NO"" to inferior product like this.

While other shows are worse, this packaging and contents only make me believe that we fans of this series are being fleeced; taken for a ride.And the only series that had received even worse treatment was the original Star Trek series (at $20 per two-episode disc, Paramount really was taking big chances with its fan-base...  The original Trek made back its money and more before Berman took over with the Next Generation and 3 dreary spinoffs...  but that's another topic!)
