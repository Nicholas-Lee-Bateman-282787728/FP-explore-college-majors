When three hikers (Bill Paxton, his mentally challenged brother Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe) stumble upon an isolated fortune coved by snow, attitudes and first impressions of each character immediately begin to change. Even for the most honest person of the group, the person most doubtfull to keep the money, four million in hard cash drives the three to devise a plan that will ultimately tear themselves and the small town apart. The movie is true to the mindset of each character as certain obstacles come between them and their destiny, and Billy Bob Thornton's talent combines with his underlying motive to make him once again the most believable aspect of the movie. To tell the truth I think the movie should've added something at the end, in other words once you've seen the role of the person who closes the chapter on the money...you, or at least I wondered if it was enough after all he had done.

463348,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305417806,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","""For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.""A lot of my friends have raved this film, and yet it has taken me an awful long time to finally see it.  Actually, it was Stephen King (an author that I don't even really enjoy that much) raving the novel that peaked my interest in finally getting my hands on this film.  This is certainly not what I expected; at all.  In fact, this may be one of the best films I've seen in recent months.It is simply stunning, and emotionally shattering.The film tells the story of two brothers who, along with a dim-witted friend, stumble across a crashed plane containing four-million-four-hundred-thousand dollars.  Hank, the responsible brother (the one with the wife, baby on the way, house, job), decides that they should turn the money in.  Jacob, the not so responsible brother, and his friend Lou feel otherwise.  Who's going to be looking for this money?  Hank tells them that he'll stash the money himself, and once they are certain that no one is going to come after them they will split up the money and go their separate ways.  It sounds like a good idea, until greed sets in and they all start turning on one another.Then people die.The film is beautifully shot and expertly paced to create a real sense of tension and dread, even when nothing startling is taking place.  It reminded me a tad of `Affliction', which was released the very same year.  I had a few issues with the tone of `Affliction'; something that I felt was rushed and not distilled enough to carry the films emotional complexity.  `A Simple Plan' captures that distilled quality I really wanted to see in `Affliction' (a good film, but a BRILLIANT novel).  The hushed sequences of gapping scenery only add to the texture of the film, creating something haunting to the core.  You can feel the emotional weight of the situation crushing down on the people involved, and it is magnified by the soft, billowing atmosphere.  The faux sense of serenity is beautifully manipulated here.At its core, `A Simple Plan' is a morality piece; a film that dissects the very presence of greed and its ability to destroy everything we love.  Just watching how each character becomes a pawn, a slave to the paper resting safely in a duffle bag, is heartbreaking.Billy Bob Thornton broke my heart, and I consider his turn here the definition of tour-de-force.  It hits you subtly, but when it hits you it hits you hard.  It's a sucker-punch to the gut, a brilliantly layered and textured portrayal of conflicted morality and the pain that comes from insufferable guilt.  Jacob is the most human individual in the film, and his loss is unimaginable.  Bill Paxton is also very good here, at times a tad stiff, and certainly no match for Thornton, but he has very commendable scenes.  Bridget Fonda is stunning here.  The way she completely switches her characters morals is outstanding.  Watching her go from a hesitant bystander to an accomplice to the ringleader is just haunting.  Her explosion on her own husband (""WHAT ABOUT ME?"") is so uncomfortably phenomenal.In the end, `A Simple Plan' is far from simple, but it's those layers that make this film a MUST SEE for any and everyone.",5,1 Timothy 6:10,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,3294,"['love', 'money', 'root', 'kinds', 'evil', 'people', 'eager', 'money', 'have', 'wandered', 'faith', 'pierced', 'many', 'griefs', 'lot', 'friends', 'have', 'raved', 'film', 'yet', 'taken', 'awful', 'long', 'time', 'finally', 'see', 'Actually', 'was', 'Stephen', 'King', 'author', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'really', 'enjoy', 'much', 'raving', 'novel', 'peaked', 'interest', 'finally', 'getting', 'hands', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'months.It', 'simply', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'shattering.The', 'film', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'dim-witted', 'friend', 'stumble', 'crashed', 'plane', 'containing', 'four-million-four-hundred-thousand', 'dollars', 'Hank', 'responsible', 'brother', 'one', 'wife', 'baby', 'way', 'house', 'job', 'should', 'turn', 'money', 'Jacob', 'not', 'so', 'responsible', 'brother', 'friend', 'Lou', 'feel', 'otherwise', 'Who', 'going', 'be', 'looking', 'money', 'Hank', ""'ll"", 'stash', 'money', 'once', 'are', 'certain', 'one', 'going', 'come', 'will', 'split', 'up', 'money', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'good', 'idea', 'greed', 'sets', 'start', 'turning', 'one', 'another.Then', 'people', 'die.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'expertly', 'paced', 'create', 'real', 'sense', 'tension', 'dread', 'even', 'when', 'nothing', 'startling', 'taking', 'place', 'reminded', 'tad', 'Affliction', 'was', 'released', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'had', 'few', 'issues', 'tone', 'Affliction', 'something', 'felt', 'was', 'rushed', 'not', 'distilled', 'enough', 'carry', 'films', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'captures', 'distilled', 'quality', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Affliction', 'good', 'film', 'BRILLIANT', 'novel', 'hushed', 'sequences', 'gapping', 'scenery', 'only', 'texture', 'film', 'creating', 'something', 'haunting', 'core', 'can', 'feel', 'emotional', 'weight', 'situation', 'crushing', 'down', 'people', 'involved', 'magnified', 'soft', 'billowing', 'atmosphere', 'faux', 'sense', 'serenity', 'beautifully', 'manipulated', 'here.At', 'core', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'morality', 'piece', 'film', 'very', 'presence', 'greed', 'ability', 'destroy', 'everything', 'love', 'Just', 'watching', 'how', 'character', 'pawn', 'slave', 'paper', 'resting', 'safely', 'duffle', 'bag', 'heartbreaking.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'broke', 'heart', 'consider', 'turn', 'here', 'definition', 'tour-de-force', 'subtly', 'when', 'hard', 'sucker-punch', 'gut', 'brilliantly', 'layered', 'textured', 'portrayal', 'conflicted', 'morality', 'pain', 'insufferable', 'guilt', 'Jacob', 'most', 'human', 'individual', 'film', 'loss', 'unimaginable', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'times', 'tad', 'stiff', 'certainly', 'match', 'Thornton', 'very', 'commendable', 'scenes', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'stunning', 'here', 'way', 'completely', 'characters', 'morals', 'outstanding', 'Watching', 'go', 'hesitant', 'bystander', 'accomplice', 'ringleader', 'just', 'haunting', 'explosion', 'own', 'husband', 'WHAT', 'ME', 'so', 'uncomfortably', 'phenomenal.In', 'end', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'far', 'simple', 'layers', 'make', 'film', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'everyone']",N/A

Both films contain a relatively simple story line, complex, tortured characters, and...simple plans that go wrong.  Here, we have two brothers, played wonderfully by Bill 'game over man!' Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton.  Thornton is the rather dim-witted one.  They stumble across a stash of money in northern Minnesota I believe and that's where the trouble begins.  I have to give kudos to Director Sam Raimi's steady hand, and the Oscar-caliber performances of the leading men.  Thornton in particular, is amazing.  Filmed around the winter bliss of Ashland, Wisconsin, this film is bleak and unremittingly grim.  While I can recommend it as a powerful story, my caveat is that by the end you will probably be feeling disturbed and uneasy.  At the time I watched it with a friend he told me afterwards that it was the most depressing film he had ever seen.  I won't go that far, but it's a definite downer.As far as the DVD goes, it looks and sounds good, so if you are just looking for a good transfer you should be pleased.

463353,A2WDSO1DQZ7J03,6305417806,behet@stud.uni-frankfurt.de,"[3, 5]","&quot;A Simple Plan&quot; was one of the best films of 1998 and by far Sam Raimi's best film to date. At first glance, Raimi wasn't an obvious choice to bring Smith's novel to the screen. His earlier films all displayed  considerable ingeniuity but they weren't subtle by any stretch of the  imagination. In &quot;A Simple Plan&quot;, Sam Raimi is awfully reticent  and relies only on his story and his actors.The film tells the story of  three men who find four million dollars in a crashed plane. This premise,  which more resembles John Huston's &quot;The Treasure Of The Sierra  Madre&quot; than the Coen Brothers' &quot;Fargo&quot;, functions as a setup  for a study of human nature. It shows, without being pretentious, the  impact of money on a person's character. After they find the money, every  person in the film re-evaluates his former live and suddenly comes to the  conclusion that it was rather mserable, something they surely didn't think  before. At the end, two of them are dead and the live of the survivor will  be almost unbearable.The main reasons for the effectiveness of the film  are the sharply drawn chracters and the fine performances (especially by  Billy Bob Thornton). It makes the viewer feel uncomfortable because he  can't reject the actions of the protagonists as something he would not even  dream of doing. Instead we have the uncanny feeling that we would actually  react the same way under these circumstances.&quot;A Simple Plan&quot;  is haunting, poetic and endlessly intruiging film that comes close to the  status of a masterpiece.

463354,A2582KMXLK2P06,6305417806,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Movies as flat out *awesome* as this don't come around very often.  My goodness, I don't even think I can find the right words to describe its awesomeness, seriously.  Perfection!It's about three guys, two of whom are brothers the other just an annoying/obnoxious friend of one of the brothers, stumbling upon a huge wad of cash in a wrecked airplane out in a snowy field one day.  While the pilot is deceased and rotting away, nobody really cares about that.  What matters most is that he's holding a bag with over 4 million bucks in dollar bills in his plane.  The guys think rationally... or rather -in the case of one of the brothers- as rationally as possible despite being dim-witted, on how they're going to hold/spend/hide the money.  The ultimate hope is that they can keep the money without being targeted for stealing it.  Well...It just so happens that these men overthink a little too much.  They take perhaps *too* many precautionary measures.  They want to make sure they cover their OWN tracks just in case one of them were to accidentally spill the beans (or later on, spilling the beans because of guilt).  I guess being in possession of so much money can do that to a person.  At first there's some humor in the way the one brother played by Billy Bob Thornton seems to interact with the cop because he almost spills the beans early on, but luckily the police department doesn't suspect anything... yet.  The cops have no reason to suspect anything until, well -without spoiling anything- things change.If only they were honest from the get go, none of this ever would have happened!  And I mean, just hand the cash to the cops and save themselves all kinds of future aggravations and emotional roller coaster rides.  But then again, who would've ever guessed so many twists and turns would occur?  Of course being honest wouldn't make for very compelling movie writing now would it?  For the sake of a movie, they should have split up the money 3 ways instead of the one guy (the smartest of the bunch, the other brother) holding onto it.  Letting one person hold onto it was a bad, bad idea.Throughout the movie, expect a ton of suspense as characters such as the many lies during the interaction with the main cop, and interesting storyline direction as the one brothers wife argues and come up with her own plans on how to keep the money without getting caught.  Also expect violence when things go wrong.  I won't be spoiling the violent scenes I'm referring to- this movie's WAY too awesome to give too much of it away through a review.  Money definitely changes the way people think and interact with each other, that's for sure.  The characters are so believable in how greedy they've become that you can even visibly see it in their eyes and their behavior, especially the one brothers wife and the look of succumbing to the money in her eyes, and her husband's hands shaking whenever tension rises and he believes he's at risk of being caught, a sign of top-notch acting all around.  Well done there.  Oh and in case I forget, no, you won't see some of the events towards the end coming.  The story's too well-told to be predictable.And how about Billy Bob Thornton?  Man, he was *really* good back in the mid to late 90's.  A Simple Plan shows how good he was.  The kind of characters he was portraying back then were really interesting. This movie's no exception.  The other actors are fantastic too.  Everyone was at the top of their game for A Simple Plan and deserves credit (even award-winning credit).  Bill Paxton delivered strong as well.  He comes off as an uptight, extra concerned, but ultimately rational kind of way and basically the only person preventing things from spiraling out of control.While you may think I'm overrating this movie and giving it too much credit, I'm honestly not.  A Simple Plan left an impression on me in many different ways.  As a movie, everything came together to create the ultimate experience for me.  The storyline is incredible, acting equally incredible, twists and turns through action and emotions that are constantly *breathtaking* (especially the very last twist... I mean WOW!) and the fact it takes place in a small snowy country town makes it even better for me.  I love those settings the most!  Again and again, I assumed I knew the direction the story was going only to be completely fooled.  I loved being wrong!

463359,A1KE3JBO3KQX2O,6305417806,Brian C.,"[0, 0]","This review will probably contain some spoilers. I will try to warn the reader in advance before I give anything away but if you have not seen this movie yet you should proceed with caution.I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. That was fifteen years ago but the film made a lasting impression on me. It was on television this year on Christmas and I caught a portion of it and was reminded of what a great movie it was so I went out and bought it and watched it again from start to finish. The movie is about a group of small towners who find $4 million dollars in a crashed plane and decide to keep it. It seems simple enough: they will hold onto the money until they are sure no one is looking for it. If someone does come looking for it they will burn it. There seems to be little risk but the title is meant to be ironic. Things quickly spin out of control and get very complicated.The plot is fairly simple and straight forward but this movie is much more than the standard crime caper. It is a morality tale about the corrupting influence of money, a meditation on small town despair, family tragedy, and the allure of the American dream. Hank, the primary &#34;protagonist&#34; of the film, seems happy enough when the film opens. He has a steady job, a beautiful wife, and a baby on the way. He is well respected and well liked. However, as the film progresses we learn that Hank's happiness is probably only skin deep. His father went bankrupt putting him through college and committed suicide (though Hank is apparently unaware of this, on a conscious level at least), his brother is a lonely alcoholic, and his job is less than fulfilling.Then he finds $4 million dollars and things spiral out of control. Of course, on one level it is an example of how money can corrupt but, I think, it is also about the way we trick ourselves into believing we are happy. It is like Aesop's fable about the sour grapes. The fox is unable to reach the grapes so he tells himself they are too sour. But what if the fox were to have the grapes presented to him on a silver platter? Would he still say they were too sour? This movie is about a group of people who have grapes handed to them on a silver platter and, all of a sudden, they realize they have been dissatisfied with their lives all along. They really wanted the grapes. They just seemed out of reach.SPOILER ALERT. To me, the defining moment of the movie is when Hank decides he is going to take the money back to the plane. He has already committed crimes that he never thought he would be capable of, and he has gotten himself entangled in a web of lies that is threatening to become ever more complex, but his wife, Sarah, talks him out of returning the money. She asks if he really wants to spend the next thirty years of his life working at the feed store, while their daughter is forced to wear hand me down clothes, and Sarah spends her life with a fake smile checking out library books and cooking the same dinner over and over. Suddenly there is a grinning skull of silent despair that becomes visible behind the veneer of happiness at the beginning of the film.ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT. In my opinion, the ending to the movie is perfect. Hank has been forced to commit four murders (killing his own brother in a scene reminiscent of Of Mice and Men) all in an effort to keep the money, and keep the American dream alive, only to find out that the money was meant to pay a ransom and the F.B.I. wrote down the serial numbers for about 5,000 of the bills. Realizing he will never be able to spend the money he burns it as his wife pleads with him to keep it. The ending, to me, has the force of the ancient Greek tragedies. Everything is destroyed, except Hank and Sarah, as they are forced to live out the rest of their days in quiet despair, like Oedipus whiling away his days after gouging out his own eyes.The acting in the movie is superb. Billy Bob Thornton plays a great lonely alcoholic. Jacob is a sad and fairly sympathetic character. Everyone views him as being kind of stupid, but he has a good heart, and he is wiser in some ways than his brother Hank. He understands their own family history (their dad's bankruptcy and suicide) better than Hank and he comes to understand the corrupting influence of the money sooner than Hanks does. Bill Paxton does a great job playing Hank and I was especially impressed by Bridget Fonda's transformation from a loving and moral housewife to a devious and amoral schemer.There are some people who claim the transformation of Hank and Sarah was not believable. There is some truth to that. I understand, at least, where they are coming from. However, I would like to provide an anecdote from my own life in response. A number of years ago I was watching the movie Hotel Rwanda about the genocide that took place in Rwanda and I was, as usual, resting in my own sense of moral superiority in relation to the people who committed those atrocities, when suddenly I realized &#34;I am a human. They are humans. Anything they are capable of, I would be capable of under the right circumstances. Our brains and nervous systems are built the same.&#34; (Similar, in substance, to one of my favorite quotes of all time, from the Roman comic playwright Terence &#8220;I am human, I consider nothing that is human alien to me.&#8221;)I actually think that is one of the themes of this movie: that even the most ordinary, and moral, people are potentially capable of anything under the right circumstances. Who can say what we might be capable of if we were in the presence of $4 million? We have all probably daydreamed about a scenario similar to the one in this movie at some point. It is not just pieces of paper dangling in front of our imaginations in those fantasies. It is a whole new life (the same dreams that inspired the conquistadores to risk life and limb searching for a city of gold or a fountain of youth). Those kinds of dreams can wreak havoc (as they did in the case of the conquistadores) and, I think, this movie highlights the often destructive effect of the &#34;American dream&#34; in all of its shapes and forms. It is an extremely powerful dream and has historically proven itself more than capable of driving people to near insanity in its pursuit.Whatever your opinion of this movie, I think one thing that we can learn from this movie is: as much as we might daydream about finding $4 million in the woods, we better hope and pray that those dreams never come true.",5,The force of a Greek

463360,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6305417806,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[6, 8]","It is not true that money is the root of all evil.  Money is just a tool.  The Scripture that is truncated to come up with that solipsism actually reads that ""The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.""  Our problem, as imperfect humans, is that it's so easy to fall in love with money...especially when one just bumps into $4.4 mil of it that looks to be as easy as the proverbial pie.This is the problem encountered by overeducated feed mill worker Hank (Bill Paxton), his unemployable brother Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and Jacob's equally pathetic best friend Lou (Brent Briscoe).  While Lou is an amoral loser and Jacob easily talked into anything, Hank has to be convinced, and that's one plot problem that we can accept because Lou knows Hank's buttons and pushes every one of them:  Hank's job in a feed mill is a dead end, he's not getting anywhere in life, and wife Sarah has a bun in the oven.  While Hank initially wants to turn the money in to the authorities, a nest egg is practically irresistible, even if it's Lou the town drunk who has to point it out to him.So the three set a plan in motion:  Hide the money for a year, and if nobody comes looking for it, they'll split it and leave town so nobody becomes suspicious that they're suddenly millionaires.  Boy, does that sound simple.  But, human nature being what it is, it just doesn't work out that way.  In reality, this is just the beginning of a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions.Hank's next mistake is to tell his wife.  He does so hypothetically at first, and she at first says the same thing Hank does:  Turn the money in.  No way should it be kept.  But when he dumps piles of cash bundles on their kitchen table, she is slowly seduced too.  This is one of the film's most effective motifs; the love of money pushes this perfectly nice small-town couple slowly and inexorably toward becoming serial killers.  While some have problems accepting this part of the story, one need only consider that Hank is on the brink, and all he needs is a nudge from the one person he respects above all others:  His pretty, loving, pregnant wife.  As with Eve in the garden, once she goes over the edge, he'll follow her anywhere.The biggest problem I have in accepting the plot twists in this film is that the sheriff seems to have little trouble swallowing anything Hank says.  Of course, Hank is one of the town's most respected men, a local area native and lifelong resident who is universally liked, a real cornerstone of the community.  Still, there's more than one moment when we expect the sheriff to become more than a little suspicious.  Ultimately, however, this is just a small town in the rural northern midwest; the county mountie doesn't have the experience or the resources to be CSI Minnesota.Ultimately, if one can rationalize the plot problems above (and a couple of others I won't go into), then ""A Simple Plan"" is a very satisfying moral tale that even has an appropriate ending.  One is even moved by the thought of what comes after ""The End""--the couple must desperately trudge along through life realizing what they allowed themselves to become, and imagining what might have been.  I really don't understand how anyone (as one reviewer was) could be ""bored"" unless he/she can't survive a film that doesn't have a car crash, explosion, or gratuitous sex scene every 15 minutes or so.  I don't find a false note in any of the performances, the musical score adds perfectly to the mood, and the story is compelling and well told, with the minor misgivings above.  Call it a 4-1/2 star minor masterpiece of suspense.  Well done.",5,"Must swallow improbabilities to buy the story, but.....",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,3623,"['not', 'true', 'money', 'root', 'evil', 'Money', 'just', 'tool', 'Scripture', 'truncated', 'come', 'up', 'solipsism', 'actually', 'love', 'money', 'root', 'kinds', 'evil', 'problem', 'imperfect', 'humans', 'so', 'easy', 'fall', 'love', 'money', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'just', 'bumps', '4.4', 'mil', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'proverbial', 'pie.This', 'problem', 'encountered', 'overeducated', 'feed', 'mill', 'worker', 'Hank', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'unemployable', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Jacob', 'equally', 'pathetic', 'best', 'friend', 'Lou', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'Lou', 'amoral', 'loser', 'Jacob', 'easily', 'talked', 'anything', 'Hank', 'be', 'convinced', 'one', 'plot', 'problem', 'can', 'accept', 'Lou', 'Hank', 'buttons', 'pushes', 'one', 'Hank', 'job', 'feed', 'mill', 'dead', 'end', 'not', 'getting', 'anywhere', 'life', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'bun', 'oven', 'Hank', 'initially', 'turn', 'money', 'authorities', 'nest', 'egg', 'practically', 'irresistible', 'even', 'Lou', 'town', 'drunk', 'who', 'point', 'out', 'him.So', 'three', 'set', 'plan', 'motion', 'Hide', 'money', 'year', 'nobody', 'looking', ""'ll"", 'split', 'leave', 'town', 'so', 'nobody', 'suspicious', ""'re"", 'suddenly', 'millionaires', 'Boy', 'sound', 'simple', 'human', 'nature', 'being', 'what', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'way', 'reality', 'just', 'beginning', 'tragedy', 'Shakespearian', 'proportions.Hank', 'next', 'mistake', 'tell', 'wife', 'so', 'hypothetically', 'first', 'first', 'same', 'thing', 'Hank', 'Turn', 'money', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'when', 'piles', 'cash', 'bundles', 'kitchen', 'table', 'slowly', 'seduced', 'too', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'motifs', 'love', 'money', 'pushes', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'small-town', 'couple', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'becoming', 'serial', 'killers', 'have', 'problems', 'accepting', 'part', 'story', 'one', 'need', 'only', 'consider', 'Hank', 'brink', 'nudge', 'one', 'person', 'others', 'pretty', 'loving', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Eve', 'garden', 'once', 'edge', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'anywhere.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'accepting', 'plot', 'film', 'sheriff', 'have', 'little', 'trouble', 'swallowing', 'anything', 'Hank', 'course', 'Hank', 'one', 'town', 'most', 'respected', 'men', 'local', 'area', 'native', 'lifelong', 'resident', 'who', 'universally', 'liked', 'real', 'cornerstone', 'community', 'Still', 'more', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'expect', 'sheriff', 'become', 'more', 'little', 'suspicious', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'just', 'small', 'town', 'rural', 'northern', 'midwest', 'county', 'mountie', ""n't"", 'have', 'experience', 'resources', 'be', 'CSI', 'Minnesota.Ultimately', 'one', 'can', 'rationalize', 'plot', 'problems', 'couple', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'then', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'very', 'satisfying', 'moral', 'tale', 'even', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'One', 'even', 'moved', 'thought', 'what', 'End', 'couple', 'must', 'desperately', 'trudge', 'life', 'realizing', 'what', 'allowed', 'become', 'imagining', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'anyone', 'one', 'reviewer', 'was', 'could', 'be', 'bored', 'he/she', 'ca', ""n't"", 'survive', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'car', 'crash', 'explosion', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scene', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'false', 'note', 'performances', 'musical', 'score', 'perfectly', 'mood', 'story', 'compelling', 'well', 'told', 'minor', 'misgivings', 'Call', '4-1/2', 'star', 'minor', 'masterpiece', 'suspense', 'Well', 'done']",N/A

Jim Thompson wrote this kind of story far better, making the characters both sympathetic and unlikable.Sam Raimi's film adaptation is far, far superior.  Bill Paxton does an excellent job communicating Hank's arrogance and emptiness, but he also hints at shock when he finds out that others see it in him, and his fatigue at trying to keep the plan simple is equally impressive.  Still Billy Bob Thornton steals the movie with his mentally challenged charactization of Jacob, Hank's simple minded brother.  Bridget Fonda makes for an understated femme fatale.  Danny Elfmann's score is nothing but wonderful and will be a welcome addition to my score library.

This is a story of two brothers and thier friend who find a duffel bag full of money in a crashed plane in a rural area. They must decide if they are going to keep the money or turn it in to the authorities. Bill Paxton is superbly cast as the &quot;conservative&quot; brother and Billy Bob Thorton is &quot;brilliant&quot; as the slow witted Jacob.  A Simple Plan is extremely intense throughout. An example of the &quot;domino effect&quot; when it comes to trusting another person.  The cinematography in A Simple Plan is outstanding. It takes place in a rural northern american town in the dead of winter. A feeling of &quot;cold seclusion&quot; is evident throughout the entire movie. The soundtrack is &quot;creepy&quot; and very fitting to the surroundings.  Any movie directed by Sam Raimi is worth watching. Any movie that has Billy Bob Thornton (one of my personal favorite actors) in it is a must for anyone who loves brilliant acting. Put these two geniouses together with a very smart and intense storyline and you have A Simple Plan.

So let's be fair, A SIMPLE PLAN is quite a winner. With a remarkable performance (once again !) of Billy Bob Thornton -the Al Pacino of the nineties- which will stay in the annals of the Film Noir genre, with a Bill Paxton unable to stop the wave of brutal deaths his deep honesty has produced and with a venomous Bridget Fonda in an angel/devil role, Samuel Raimi has, in my opinion, directed the cast of the year 1998.With FARGO and AFFLICTION, A SIMPLE PLAN is the third snowy movie I've seen during the last months. It seems that cold winters produce an eruption of hidden fantasies among american citizens. But we're not in Sweden, in a Bergman movie, problems are not solved after long philosophical discussions in front of a warm fire. No, here we rather act than talk. So blood is flowing a lot in A SIMPLE PLAN, - the Samuel Raimi touch I suppose -, and solely a brief commentary of Bill Paxton at the beginning of the movie could be considered as a hint of a psychological dimension of the characters involved.But let's not despair, it's the first Samuel Raimi movie that is not made in priority for the drive-ins audience and it contains a lot of promises.

I've always been intrigued by films where several characters do something that ties them together(rob a bank, kill someone, find some stolen loot, etc....) and then proceed to all turn on each other one by one.This film concerns three men who find a downed plane and a sack with 4 million in cash. The 3 decide to split the obviously HOT loot without turning it into the authorities. The after effects of the characters criminal actions become harsher as the film progresses and Raimi and crew do a wonderful job of slowly tightening the knot of suspense.  I think some people may have been turned off by how down-beat the tone of the film is but that's precisely why the film is so great. It's dark but appropriately so.  The film is all of a piece and I think if you give it a chance you won't be disappointed. Btw, Thornton was robbed of an oscar for this film. I think he was nominated and lost to James Coburn. He is amazing. And for once, Bridget Fonda's listless, colorless under-acting is perfectly suited. She works well with Paxton and Thornton and this is probably the best work her & Paxton have done. Although Paxton is also good in the later under-rated ""Frailty"".You don't get anything in the way of extras w/this dvd but it's worth it for the film alone.

All it needs to do this is show the events as they come, as there's nothing more  terrifying than, as the tagline for the film says,  good people doing evil  things. This is one of the only films where the sheer banality of evil has  been portrayed properly, and the acting is superb. Even Paxton who is  normally rather dull manages to create a believable character - just watch  the moment where he suffocates someone with his bare hands, an instance of  very good acting. The photography is excellent, showing that Raimi is a  talented director in any genre. The portents of the awful events to come  are marvellous, like the use of the crows who act as some kind of silent  narrators. The book was much more bloody, but I feel that it is for the  better that this is not carried through to the movie (the original author  wrote the screnplay, so who am I to argue). The picture quality is very  good, picking out single snow flakes, and the trailer is suitably  foreboding.

463368,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6305417806,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 2]","This is a diabolical tale about the wages of greed.  Although it is played straight without intentional humor, the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing.Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the one who begins to feel evil, and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up.  His presumably smarter brother Hank (Bill Paxton) feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another.  Their problems begin when they and Jacob's buddy Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe) stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills.  Lou, who might represent the common man, says, let's keep it.  Hank, who could be rational man, says, whoa, this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble.  We better turn it in.  And Jacob, who is the natural man, sides with his buddy Lou.  Afterall they're country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss.  And anyway, what can go wrong?Well, as Ben Franklin observed a long time ago, ""Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.""  As they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money, the ""simple plan"" begins to unravel with horrific consequences.Thornton and Briscoe play country boys to perfection, and Paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy majorly compromised.  Bridget Fonda plays Hank's pregnant wife, who turns out to be the brains (as it were) of the group.  There are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another.  Inevitably we have a morality tale in which the wages of sin are fully realized.Sam Raimi's direction captures well the atmophere of north country America without any obvious straining for effect.  He gets great mileage out of a few crows (actually some of them are ravens, I think) and a whole lot of snow.  Scott B. Smith's script (from his novel) is clever and morally astute.  The characterizations are excellent and the story psychologically satisfying.

463369,A3QEJ40NQEW36Q,6305417806,"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is...","[7, 10]","(Beware the tides...there be spoilers ahead.)A SIMPLE PLAN is a heart-rending drama about the impact a small fortune can have on ordinary people.Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton play brothers Hank and Jacob Mitchell, who, along with Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) find a downed airplane with a dead pilot and a cache of $1.4 million inside.  Guessing it to be drug money, they decide the loss will likely go unreported.So Hank proposes a simple plan that will allow them keep it:  he will hide it until he feels it's safe to split it up.  In the meantime, the three should go about their business as though the money doesn't exist.  To ensure compliance, Hank threatens to burn the money if suspicion starts to fall on them.Hank is the first one to break the vow of silence:  he tells his pregnant wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), beginning by asking her a hypothetical question about found money.  ""I'd return the money,"" Sarah professes, earnestly.Then Hank shows her the money.Her immediate and dramatic reversal of position foreshadows the film's chilling climax.  It's the first of many examples of the film's most thought-provoking observation:  that all the plans and good intentions in the world are meaningless if we can't back them up when it counts.It doesn't take long before the factions begin to form--Hank and Sarah vs. Lou and his wife, Nancy (Becky Ann Baker)--and poor, simple Jacob, who just wants to buy back his father's land, is caught in the middle, having to choose between his brother (with whom he has little in common and next to whom he feels inferior) and his best friend.  It is a credit to Raimi, Paxton and Thornton that the audience is kept guessing where Jacob's loyalties lie until the last possible moment.Thornton turns in a stunning performance as a simple man forced to choose between family and friend, life and death.  The magnitude of his portrayal is most poignant in a tiny scene where he sits alone in a bar, playing with two shot glasses.  No words necessary--the image speaks volumes of desolation and despair.Not everyone will want to own this movie--it's brilliant, compelling, and features a wealth of stunning performances, but it ain't a fun time.  Watch it when you're looking to wrestle with some philosophical questions--you might come away wondering how well you know yourself.",4,"Raimi responds to FARGO, turns in his finest drama to date.",1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2335,"['Beware', 'tides', 'there', 'be', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'heart-rending', 'drama', 'impact', 'small', 'fortune', 'can', 'have', 'ordinary', 'people.Bill', 'Paxton', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'play', 'brothers', 'Hank', 'Jacob', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'Jacob', 'friend', 'Lou', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'find', 'downed', 'airplane', 'dead', 'pilot', 'cache', '1.4', 'million', 'inside', 'Guessing', 'be', 'drug', 'money', 'decide', 'loss', 'will', 'likely', 'go', 'unreported.So', 'Hank', 'simple', 'plan', 'will', 'allow', 'keep', 'will', 'hide', 'safe', 'split', 'up', 'meantime', 'three', 'should', 'go', 'business', 'money', ""n't"", 'exist', 'ensure', 'compliance', 'Hank', 'burn', 'money', 'suspicion', 'fall', 'them.Hank', 'first', 'one', 'break', 'vow', 'silence', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'beginning', 'asking', 'hypothetical', 'question', 'found', 'money', ""'d"", 'return', 'money', 'Sarah', 'earnestly.Then', 'Hank', 'money.Her', 'immediate', 'dramatic', 'reversal', 'position', 'film', 'chilling', 'climax', 'first', 'many', 'examples', 'film', 'most', 'thought-provoking', 'observation', 'plans', 'good', 'intentions', 'world', 'are', 'meaningless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'back', 'up', 'when', 'counts.It', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'factions', 'begin', 'form', 'Hank', 'Sarah', 'vs.', 'Lou', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'Becky', 'Ann', 'Baker', 'poor', 'simple', 'Jacob', 'who', 'just', 'buy', 'back', 'father', 'land', 'caught', 'middle', 'having', 'choose', 'brother', 'whom', 'little', 'common', 'next', 'whom', 'inferior', 'best', 'friend', 'credit', 'Raimi', 'Paxton', 'Thornton', 'audience', 'kept', 'guessing', 'where', 'Jacob', 'loyalties', 'lie', 'last', 'possible', 'moment.Thornton', 'stunning', 'performance', 'simple', 'man', 'forced', 'choose', 'family', 'friend', 'life', 'death', 'magnitude', 'portrayal', 'most', 'poignant', 'tiny', 'scene', 'where', 'alone', 'bar', 'playing', 'two', 'shot', 'glasses', 'words', 'necessary', 'image', 'volumes', 'desolation', 'despair.Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'compelling', 'wealth', 'stunning', 'performances', 'ai', ""n't"", 'fun', 'time', 'Watch', 'when', ""'re"", 'looking', 'wrestle', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'might', 'come', 'away', 'wondering', 'how', 'well', 'know']",N/A

Litton,"[17, 18]","Proving that thrillers needn't exhaust audiences with bloated special effects and heavy doses of machine gun-fire, ""A Simple Plan"" joyously recalls the days when suspensers were more about suspense than pyrotechnics. Setting the story in the cold wintry woodlands of Minnesota, Scott B. Smith's screenplay dabbles in such engrossing elements as greed, consequence, and desperation, piling on plot twist after plot twist until the intensity almost becomes unbearable.Bill Paxton plays Hank Mitchell, a working-class man who works at a local feed store to support he and his pregnant wife, Sarah, played by Bridget Fonda. He has a brother, Jacob, who is played by Billy Bob Thornton; Jacob, along with his pal Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe), are the town's resident drunks. One snowy day, after a visit to their father's grave, Hank and Jacob, with Lou along for the ride, have an accident that sends Jacob's dog running into the woods. While looking for the dog, they come across a downed charter plane, its pilot dead, with a gym bag of four million dollar in tow.The three waste no time tearing into the bag of ""lost treasure,"" despite Hank's reservations about keeping the money. But Jacob and Lou have other plans, those which do not include alerting the proper authorities as to their recent find. After a heated argument, they agree that they will wait to split the money until they feel certain that no one will come looking for it. Just for safekeeping, Hank takes charge of the money, which soon takes charge of his good-hearted nature.As the plot thickens, things begin to work into a frenzy. Sarah, now overcome with the idea of a wealthy life, urges Hank to keep a close watch on Lou, as well as Jacob, who becomes increasingly unstable as things reach new heights of desperation. The murder of a local farmer at the hands of Hank throws a new piece of leverage into the game, leading him to develop a new plan of making himself look completely innocent. More complications begins to arise, and soon, no one is left untouched.Director Sam Raimi, whose previous work includes the wildly outrageous ""Evil Dead"" series, takes a unique turn in his career, directing Smith's screenplay (adapted from his own novel) with attention to story, action and character traits in equal measure. He is careful not to overburden his audience with too much at one time, clearing up one matter before introducing another so that each new development carries its own importance to the story. He also manages to keep things moving at a brisk pace, so as not to sink the movie into periods of boredom.The script itself is one of the most chilling and satisfying I've seen in some time. It focuses on the effects of greed on mankind, turning the most well-intentioned of all townspeople into desperate, money-hungry slaves, replacing trust and good judgment with suspicion and rationalization. These changes are seen in each of the characters, most notably Hank and Sarah, whom we care for as the film opens, and utterly despise once it ends. Jacob, however, remains as the sole character with a grip on reality, overcome by his fears and his remorse for his actions; in the face of his brother's struggle to keep their twisted operation alive, he merely wants it all to come to an end and return to his life.Fleshing out these characters appears to have been no simple task, but Paxton, Fonda, Thornton and Briscoe live up to the challenge. ""A Simple Plan"" portrays some of their best work, as well as that of Raimi's, who supercharges his otherwise quiet film with a terrific amount of underlying suspense that arises not solely from the grizzly crimes of its characters, but also from their unsettling states of mind once things get out of hand.",5,Brilliant acting and direction for this quiet thriller.,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,3735,"['Proving', 'thrillers', 'need', ""n't"", 'exhaust', 'audiences', 'bloated', 'special', 'effects', 'heavy', 'doses', 'machine', 'gun-fire', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'joyously', 'days', 'when', 'suspensers', 'were', 'more', 'suspense', 'pyrotechnics', 'Setting', 'story', 'cold', 'wintry', 'woodlands', 'Minnesota', 'Scott', 'B.', 'Smith', 'screenplay', 'dabbles', 'such', 'engrossing', 'elements', 'greed', 'consequence', 'desperation', 'piling', 'plot', 'twist', 'plot', 'twist', 'intensity', 'almost', 'unbearable.Bill', 'Paxton', 'Hank', 'Mitchell', 'working-class', 'man', 'who', 'local', 'feed', 'store', 'support', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'who', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Jacob', 'pal', 'Lou', 'Chambers', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'are', 'town', 'resident', 'drunks', 'One', 'snowy', 'day', 'visit', 'father', 'grave', 'Hank', 'Jacob', 'Lou', 'ride', 'have', 'accident', 'Jacob', 'dog', 'running', 'woods', 'looking', 'dog', 'come', 'downed', 'charter', 'plane', 'pilot', 'dead', 'gym', 'bag', 'four', 'million', 'dollar', 'tow.The', 'three', 'waste', 'time', 'tearing', 'bag', 'lost', 'treasure', 'Hank', 'reservations', 'keeping', 'money', 'Jacob', 'Lou', 'have', 'other', 'plans', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'alerting', 'proper', 'authorities', 'recent', 'find', 'heated', 'argument', 'agree', 'will', 'wait', 'split', 'money', 'feel', 'certain', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'looking', 'Just', 'safekeeping', 'Hank', 'charge', 'money', 'soon', 'charge', 'good-hearted', 'nature.As', 'plot', 'thickens', 'things', 'begin', 'work', 'frenzy', 'Sarah', 'now', 'idea', 'wealthy', 'life', 'Hank', 'keep', 'close', 'watch', 'Lou', 'as', 'well', 'Jacob', 'who', 'increasingly', 'unstable', 'things', 'reach', 'new', 'heights', 'desperation', 'murder', 'local', 'farmer', 'hands', 'Hank', 'new', 'piece', 'leverage', 'game', 'leading', 'develop', 'new', 'plan', 'making', 'look', 'completely', 'innocent', 'More', 'complications', 'arise', 'soon', 'one', 'left', 'untouched.Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'previous', 'work', 'wildly', 'outrageous', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'series', 'unique', 'turn', 'career', 'directing', 'Smith', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'own', 'novel', 'attention', 'story', 'action', 'character', 'traits', 'equal', 'measure', 'careful', 'not', 'overburden', 'audience', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'time', 'clearing', 'up', 'one', 'matter', 'introducing', 'so', 'new', 'development', 'own', 'importance', 'story', 'also', 'keep', 'things', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'so', 'not', 'sink', 'movie', 'periods', 'boredom.The', 'script', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', 'satisfying', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'effects', 'greed', 'mankind', 'turning', 'most', 'well-intentioned', 'townspeople', 'desperate', 'money-hungry', 'slaves', 'replacing', 'trust', 'good', 'judgment', 'suspicion', 'rationalization', 'changes', 'are', 'seen', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Hank', 'Sarah', 'whom', 'care', 'film', 'utterly', 'despise', 'Jacob', 'however', 'sole', 'character', 'grip', 'reality', 'overcome', 'fears', 'remorse', 'actions', 'face', 'brother', 'struggle', 'keep', 'twisted', 'operation', 'alive', 'merely', 'come', 'end', 'return', 'life.Fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'task', 'Paxton', 'Fonda', 'Thornton', 'Briscoe', 'live', 'up', 'challenge', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'best', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'Raimi', 'who', 'otherwise', 'quiet', 'film', 'terrific', 'amount', 'underlying', 'suspense', 'not', 'solely', 'grizzly', 'crimes', 'characters', 'also', 'unsettling', 'states', 'mind', 'things', 'get', 'hand']",N/A

463375,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,6305417806,Elisabeth,"[3, 4]","One day Hank Mitchell is living a modest life with a modest income.  The next day he's a millionaire.  They say money can't buy you happiness, but is that really true?  Hank is about to find the answer the hard way.Before he became a millionaire, Hank (Bill Paxton) and his wife (Bridget Fonda) were leading ordinary, but relatively happy lives.  The only thorn in Hank's life was his brother, Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton).  It's clear early on that Jacob highly resents Hank.  Whenever Hank says anything even remotely critical, Jacob becomes hyper sensitive to his criticism and takes it as an attack.Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) shares Hank's resentment, accusing Hank of ""putting on airs"".One day out in the woods, this trio discovers a bag containing millions of dollars.  Jacob and Lou are thrilled by the discovery, calling it ""the American dream"".  Hank, however, says you have to work for the American dream and wants to leave the money behind.Jacob and Lou convince Hank to keep it and Hank assigns himself the leader of the group and the distributor of the money.Jacob and Lou agree to his plan, but given how much they resent Hank already, they don't stick to the plan for too long.  Pretty soon, they start knocking Hank off his pedestal.  Jacob does this by continuously ridiculing Hank and by betraying Hank's confidence.  And Lou does this by ridiculing Hank, too, but also by making threats towards him, too.That's not to say that Hank is a saint.  Hank is a pathological liar.  His main frustration with Jacob is that Jacob can't lie with the same finesse that Hank can...and that's because Jacob can see the ramification of lying towards others, whereas Hank is too self-absorbed to relate to other's feelings.Hank's wife is no better.  When Hank hypothetically asks her what she'd do if she found a mysterious bag of money, she righteously tells him she wouldn't take it.  But when he shows her the money is real (breaking his own rule about not telling anyone), she quickly changes her tune.When the situation was hypothetical, she spoke with integrity...but when her integrity was tested, she proved to be just as calculating and manipulative as Hank.This simple plan turns out not to be so simple after all.  Before he found the money, Hank lived a simple and relaxed life.  But after he finds the money, his life becomes a stressful train wreck.  And given how the movie ends, his plan turns out to be a tragic waste, too.Everyone here tries to prosper by cheating and as result, there's betrayal galore and even a body count.  In the beginning of the film, Hank narrates what the meaning of happiness is.  His father told him happiness was all about the simple things in life...a wife who loves you, a decent job, and friends and neighbors who like and respect you.The message at the end seems to be that Hank had all this, but didn't appreciate what he had until it was too late.  However, given his secretly unhappy wife, his unfulfilling job, and family and friends who disrespected him, it didn't seem like Hank really had the good life I'm supposed to believe he had.Nevertheless, this is still a good morality tale against trying to prosper by cheating.",4,The dangers of trying to prosper by cheating,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,3188,"['One', 'day', 'Hank', 'Mitchell', 'living', 'modest', 'life', 'modest', 'income', 'next', 'day', 'millionaire', 'say', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'really', 'true', 'Hank', 'find', 'answer', 'hard', 'way.Before', 'became', 'millionaire', 'Hank', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'wife', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'were', 'leading', 'ordinary', 'relatively', 'happy', 'lives', 'only', 'thorn', 'Hank', 'life', 'was', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'clear', 'early', 'Jacob', 'highly', 'resents', 'Hank', 'Whenever', 'Hank', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'critical', 'Jacob', 'hyper', 'sensitive', 'criticism', 'attack.Jacob', 'friend', 'Lou', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'shares', 'Hank', 'resentment', 'accusing', 'Hank', 'putting', 'airs', '.One', 'day', 'out', 'woods', 'trio', 'bag', 'containing', 'millions', 'dollars', 'Jacob', 'Lou', 'are', 'thrilled', 'discovery', 'calling', 'American', 'dream', 'Hank', 'however', 'have', 'work', 'American', 'dream', 'leave', 'money', 'behind.Jacob', 'Lou', 'convince', 'Hank', 'keep', 'Hank', 'leader', 'group', 'distributor', 'money.Jacob', 'Lou', 'agree', 'plan', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'resent', 'Hank', 'already', 'do', ""n't"", 'stick', 'plan', 'too', 'long', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'start', 'knocking', 'Hank', 'pedestal', 'Jacob', 'continuously', 'ridiculing', 'Hank', 'betraying', 'Hank', 'confidence', 'Lou', 'ridiculing', 'Hank', 'too', 'also', 'making', 'threats', 'too.That', 'not', 'say', 'Hank', 'saint', 'Hank', 'pathological', 'liar', 'main', 'frustration', 'Jacob', 'Jacob', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'same', 'finesse', 'Hank', 'can', 'Jacob', 'can', 'see', 'ramification', 'lying', 'towards', 'others', 'whereas', 'Hank', 'too', 'self-absorbed', 'relate', 'other', 'feelings.Hank', 'wife', 'better', 'When', 'Hank', 'hypothetically', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'found', 'mysterious', 'bag', 'money', 'righteously', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'when', 'money', 'real', 'breaking', 'own', 'rule', 'not', 'telling', 'anyone', 'quickly', 'tune.When', 'situation', 'was', 'hypothetical', 'spoke', 'integrity', 'when', 'integrity', 'was', 'tested', 'proved', 'be', 'just', 'calculating', 'manipulative', 'Hank.This', 'simple', 'plan', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'simple', 'found', 'money', 'Hank', 'lived', 'simple', 'relaxed', 'life', 'money', 'life', 'stressful', 'train', 'wreck', 'given', 'how', 'movie', 'plan', 'out', 'be', 'tragic', 'waste', 'too.Everyone', 'here', 'prosper', 'cheating', 'result', 'betrayal', 'galore', 'even', 'body', 'count', 'beginning', 'film', 'Hank', 'what', 'meaning', 'happiness', 'father', 'told', 'happiness', 'was', 'simple', 'things', 'life', 'wife', 'who', 'decent', 'job', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'who', 'like', 'respect', 'you.The', 'message', 'end', 'be', 'Hank', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'what', 'had', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'However', 'given', 'secretly', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'unfulfilling', 'job', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'disrespected', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Hank', 'really', 'had', 'good', 'life', ""'m"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'had.Nevertheless', 'still', 'good', 'morality', 'tale', 'trying', 'prosper', 'cheating']",N/A

You may find yourself going along with the film and criticizing the moves by the main conspirators who stumble upon a bag full of money in the snow. On one level, this is a film about trust and deception, as we see the three concoct this plan of keeping the money one year to decide what to do with it, but, on another level, it is about the essence of how events presented to us may change our lives. Although the three immediately discuss and argue about what to do once they find the money, they are still friends, and civil; however, as time progresses, and thoughts creep into their head about motives, greed and suspicions begin to surface.The intriguing part about this suspense is that much of it is subtle, and it relies much on character development to build towards its final conclusion. We have four characters who are affected by the money which is found, and each have their own motivations and plans. Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton) and his wife (Bridgett Fonda) at first seem overwhelmed about the idea of holding onto such a large sum of money, but as the movie progresses, it gets the best of them, and they begin to try to find means to make it their own. Hank's ""slow"" brother, Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), has big dreams of finding some happiness with the money, but as he sees how the money affects both his brother and friend, Lou, he is caught as a middle man between family and friend. It seems every person has good intentions at one point (and there are many moments where the idea of turning the money in presents itself), but there is a sinister consciousness that takes over and pushes back rational though, especially in Hank and his wife, Sarah. Jacob is probably the most innocent of all characters, as he only wants what is best for all, but he does not have the influence over the others to change the course of their actions.Perhaps the only drawback in an otherwise excellently made film is one or two unbelievable events in the plot, namely the part with the alleged FBI agent's badge not being checked. However, I don't think these discredit the power of the film and its message. A Simple Plan is a study in morality, and seems to work as much as a parable as it does a thriller. You will have to decide whether you think each character is given their ""just desserts"" and if karma comes back to haunt those who are the greediest in the tale.Over all, this is a fantastic film, one which you can watch and then come back and watch again a few years later.",4,Absorbing Thriller,1246924800,"07 7, 2009",2009,2694,"['Maybe', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'simple', 'all.A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'premise', 'basis', 'definite', 'discussion', 'kind', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'how', 'may', 'have', 'acted', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'may', 'find', 'going', 'film', 'criticizing', 'moves', 'main', 'conspirators', 'who', 'stumble', 'bag', 'full', 'money', 'snow', 'one', 'level', 'film', 'trust', 'deception', 'see', 'three', 'concoct', 'plan', 'keeping', 'money', 'one', 'year', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'level', 'essence', 'how', 'events', 'presented', 'may', 'change', 'lives', 'three', 'immediately', 'discuss', 'argue', 'what', 'do', 'once', 'find', 'money', 'are', 'still', 'friends', 'civil', 'however', 'time', 'thoughts', 'creep', 'head', 'motives', 'greed', 'suspicions', 'begin', 'surface.The', 'intriguing', 'part', 'suspense', 'much', 'subtle', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'build', 'towards', 'final', 'conclusion', 'have', 'four', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'affected', 'money', 'found', 'have', 'own', 'motivations', 'plans', 'Hank', 'Mitchell', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'wife', 'Bridgett', 'Fonda', 'first', 'seem', 'overwhelmed', 'idea', 'holding', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'movie', 'best', 'begin', 'try', 'find', 'means', 'make', 'own', 'Hank', 'slow', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'big', 'dreams', 'finding', 'happiness', 'money', 'how', 'money', 'brother', 'friend', 'Lou', 'caught', 'middle', 'man', 'family', 'friend', 'person', 'good', 'intentions', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'idea', 'turning', 'money', 'presents', 'sinister', 'consciousness', 'pushes', 'back', 'rational', 'especially', 'Hank', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'probably', 'most', 'innocent', 'characters', 'only', 'what', 'best', 'not', 'have', 'influence', 'others', 'change', 'course', 'actions.Perhaps', 'only', 'drawback', 'otherwise', 'excellently', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'unbelievable', 'events', 'plot', 'namely', 'part', 'alleged', 'FBI', 'agent', 'badge', 'not', 'being', 'checked', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'discredit', 'power', 'film', 'message', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'study', 'morality', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'parable', 'thriller', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'think', 'character', 'given', 'just', 'desserts', 'karma', 'back', 'haunt', 'who', 'are', 'greediest', 'tale.Over', 'fantastic', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'few', 'years', 'later']",N/A

Taking a step away from the special effects that have dominated some of his previous movies he gives us a relatively quiet character driven movie. But don't forget this is Sam Raimi. You know something dark is bound to happen.Bill Paxton has the lead role as a quiet hardworking family man in this snow-covered town out in the Mid-West. He has a simple life. He works at the local feed store and his young wife, played by Bridget Fonda, works in the local Library and is about to give birth. His only other family in the town is his older brother, played by Billy Bob Thorton. Billy Bob is a little slow but is mostly together. He goes through life with his dog and his best friend, the town drunk.One chilly day, the three guys are in a truck heading home when a fox darts across their path. They swerve to avoid it and hit a tree. Billy Bob's dog jumps out of the back of the truck and heads off into the woods chasing the fox. The three men trudge through the snow searching for the dog. They begin to argue, as Paxton's character doesn't get along with the Billy Bob's friend at all. The argument is cut short when they find a plane down in the woods. They crawl into it to see if anyone is alive and find the pilot long dead and a bag with 4 and a  million dollars.Now they have a choice to make. They can turn the money in or they can keep it and hope nobody comes looking. They concoct a plan to keep the money and split it in the Spring.  They vow to keep silent about the money...even to their spouses. That vow lasts about as long as it takes to get home. The allure of the money begins to tear at all of them in different ways the longer they have it. The more they try to keep others from finding about the money the more problems occur.The actors all do a good job in this one. Bill Paxton is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. He goes through all stages from being a truly happy man to one who is haunted by the mistakes of greed. Bridget Fonda is surprising as the ruthless wife. Billy Bob Thorton does his usual good job but this character is only a slight jump up from his Slingblade persona.All this being said...the movie is slow. It takes way too much time going from scene to scene and I began to lose interest after awhile. Also the darkness of it got to be a tad depressing and somewhat predictable.

It's one of those movies that sticks with you for a long time after watching and makes you think. The movie sends a very powerful message and in some ways, is satirical. The message it sends is that striving for stability and happiness in life has very little or nothing to do with money. The movie shows what extrodinary lengths people are willing to go to just for a large amount of money. The movie &quot;Fargo&quot; which came out in 1996, has more or less the same message. Perhaps I would have given &quot;Fargo&quot; 5 stars had I seen it first, but I still think the narration in the beginning and ending make &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; the superior picture.

Our wise hero, played by Bill Paxton, devises a simple plan in which they can lay low with the cash to determine if anyone is looking for it, then move out of town and split the bounty.  If only he could control everything...The bag o' cash is just a starting point for this riveting morality tale.  The bottom line is that one lie always leads to another, and our little trio, plus the wives, get in deeper and deeper.  There are bound to be crossed loyalties in a group of three--the brothers have family ties, and the friend is loyal to only one of the brothers (the Billy Bob Thornton character).  A push-and-pull over the loyalty of Thornton's character ensues.  Each man has different family and work pressures, and not all are as patient as the one who devised the clear-headed simple plan.  It's captivating to watch money change the motives and behaviors of these men.The real star is Billy Bob Thornton, playing the down-and-out loser Jacob.  He's a nobody in town, a generally recognized screw-up, but he is truly the philosopher of the group.  He has very simple desires of resurrecting his dead father's farm, and he can't imagine taking the cash and leaving the only town he's ever known.  In the end, he plays the only man with a conscience.My chief complaint with both the movie and the novel of the same name is the way the Sarah character goes through a complete personality change.  She's two completely different people at different points in the movie, and her change in behavior isn't well-explained.

When he, his out-of-luck brother, Jacob, played by Thornton and his brother's loser of a friend, Lou, stumble onto $4.4 million dollars, his first instinct is to call the police and turn the money in. Who knows where the money is from? But the serpent of Eden is in this story and sinks its fangs into every character, and even a man wit a good heart like Bill Paxton eventually bites from the proverbial apple. He agrees to hold on to the money, just until the thaw, until the plane is found, and then see if anyone comes looking for the money. All swear to secrecy, to not even tell their wives. When Hank arrives home, he asks his wife what she would do if she found a large sum of money. Her response is similar to his - call the police. Regardless of where the money came from, to keep it is tantamount to stealing. But when he dumps the money on the table, showing her that his questioning isn't hypothetical, the moviegoer can see the change in her eyes; can see the proverbial serpent crawling up her leg as clearly as if it actually were. She moves easily and comfortably from a person of strong moral character, like her husband, to a person eventually consumed with avarice.Simple in its presentation, it's really a complex story. We learn that Lou is more of a brother to Jacob than Hank is, and we can certainly see that in the character's physical presentation. Paxton looks too clean cut for this small town - certainly too proper to be working in a feed mill. Jacob, in stark contrast, is right where he belongs. He has greasy hair, no job prospects, no girlfriend, no wife - not even a decent pair of glasses (he could have used a visit from Hermione to mend the broken center). Lou is the town drunk and proud of it, and although he has a wife, it is a relationship with very little substance. Not one of love, but of comfort. In a telling scene of distance, although it is a scene of remarkable and surprising subtlety, Jacob pokes fun at the way his brother drinks his whiskey. It's not the way that other men in this small town would drink their whiskey. In truth, Hank's mannerisms in this respect are somewhat effete.With every moral dilemma presented to them, they all sink deeper and deeper into the serpent's grip. To say more would be to give away one of the more tragic endings since Romeo and Juliet (don't laugh, I'm serious), and not an ending that you see coming from a mile away.",5,Not such a simple plot,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,2625,"['Brilliantly', 'acted', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'particular', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'film', 'greed', 'saddest', 'presentation.The', 'moral', 'center', 'story', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'character', 'Hank', 'Mitchell', 'When', 'out-of-luck', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'played', 'Thornton', 'brother', 'loser', 'friend', 'Lou', 'stumble', '4.4', 'million', 'dollars', 'first', 'instinct', 'call', 'police', 'turn', 'money', 'Who', 'where', 'money', 'serpent', 'Eden', 'story', 'sinks', 'fangs', 'character', 'even', 'man', 'good', 'heart', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'eventually', 'proverbial', 'apple', 'hold', 'money', 'just', 'thaw', 'plane', 'found', 'then', 'see', 'anyone', 'looking', 'money', 'swear', 'secrecy', 'not', 'even', 'tell', 'wives', 'When', 'Hank', 'home', 'wife', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'response', 'similar', 'call', 'police', 'Regardless', 'where', 'money', 'came', 'keep', 'tantamount', 'stealing', 'when', 'money', 'table', 'showing', 'questioning', ""n't"", 'hypothetical', 'moviegoer', 'can', 'see', 'change', 'eyes', 'can', 'see', 'proverbial', 'serpent', 'crawling', 'up', 'leg', 'as', 'clearly', 'actually', 'were', 'easily', 'comfortably', 'person', 'strong', 'moral', 'character', 'husband', 'person', 'eventually', 'consumed', 'avarice.Simple', 'presentation', 'really', 'complex', 'story', 'learn', 'Lou', 'more', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'Hank', 'can', 'certainly', 'see', 'character', 'physical', 'presentation', 'Paxton', 'too', 'clean', 'cut', 'small', 'town', 'certainly', 'too', 'proper', 'be', 'working', 'feed', 'mill', 'Jacob', 'stark', 'contrast', 'right', 'where', 'greasy', 'hair', 'job', 'prospects', 'girlfriend', 'wife', 'not', 'even', 'decent', 'pair', 'glasses', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'visit', 'Hermione', 'mend', 'broken', 'center', 'Lou', 'town', 'drunk', 'proud', 'wife', 'relationship', 'very', 'little', 'substance', 'Not', 'one', 'love', 'comfort', 'telling', 'scene', 'distance', 'scene', 'remarkable', 'surprising', 'subtlety', 'Jacob', 'fun', 'way', 'brother', 'whiskey', 'not', 'way', 'other', 'men', 'small', 'town', 'would', 'drink', 'whiskey', 'truth', 'Hank', 'mannerisms', 'respect', 'are', 'somewhat', 'effete.With', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'presented', 'sink', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'serpent', 'grip', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'give', 'away', 'one', 'more', 'tragic', 'endings', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', ""'m"", 'serious', 'not', 'ending', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away']",N/A

Smith also wrote the screenplay and largely stayed true to the book although the second half of the movie definitely takes some detours.  The story begins with a very simple premise.  Three men find a plane with millions of dollars in cash.  Rather than turn the money over to the police, they agree to hide it for six months and divide it as long as no one comes looking for it.  We see this simple plan begin to unravel almost as soon as it is conceived.  His two partners in this crime, his brother and the brother's only friend, are both drunken losers and impatient to start spending the money.  I won't give away plot details because this is a suspenseful movie and giving away most plot developments would really damage a viewer's enjoyment.None other than Sam Raimi directed the movie before he hit the big time with the Spider-Man franchise.

All play their parts to a tee and Bridget Fonda is chilling as Hank's wife Sarah.I definitely recommend A Simple Plan.

463404,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,6305417806,Kenji Fujishima,"[16, 20]","Before watching A SIMPLE PLAN, I saw THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, John Huston's 1948 classic that also tackled the same subject as this film. Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) allowed greed to get the best of him, and it destroyed him. But Huston wrapped this little tragedy in the adventure genre, and while it was indeed a thrilling adventure, Dobbs' downfall in Huston's film doesn't seem (on a visceral level, at least) quite as tragic as what happens to the major characters in Sam Raimi's film.The major difference that perhaps makes A SIMPLE PLAN more powerful as an examination of greed than SIERRA MADRE is this: Huston's main characters went looking for riches in a land known to be full of 'em, so they didn't have to necessarily worry about being caught stealing anything---Dobbs &amp; Co. only had to worry about other people trying to steal their gold. Hank (Bill Paxton), Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and Lou (Brent Briscoe) accidentally find $4.4 million in unmarked American currency in a downed plane in a quiet, snowy Minnesota town, and the moment they decide to steal the money for themselves (and that is basically what they decide to do, although they certainly try to convince themselves that it's not stealing) is the moment that changes all of their lives forever.In SIERRA MADRE, Walter Huston's character talked early in the film about how he's seen money destroy men's souls. That is exactly what happens to the characters in A SIMPLE PLAN. It leads Hank to coldblooded murder, it leads Hank's wife (Bridget Fonda) to become a modern version of Lady Macbeth, and it drives Jacob to despair. In one key moment, Jacob confesses to Hank that he &quot;feels evil,&quot; and that just about sums up the movie's theme succinctly.While Huston's film also worked as a grand adventure tale, Raimi's film is more in the bleak, film noir style of the Coen Brothers' FARGO, right down to its Minnesota setting and constantly falling snow. It sometimes feels like a suspense-thriller (especially towards the end), but there are no stylish, bombastic action scenes here in the manner of Raimi's earlier films---just a lot of quietly devastating moments and flashes of quick but shocking violence. It's the emotional violence done to these characters, though, that reverberates throughout the whole film.The performances are all powerfully convincing across the board, and while some might take issue with the plausibility of some of the plot twists in the film's later moments (I can't believe that no one actually bothered to ask to see that person's badge just to make sure he was who he said he was), that is hardly enough to detract from the tragic cumulative impact of this film.

463410,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305417806,Lawyeraau,"[14, 19]","This film is an adaptation of what is, without a doubt, an amazing debut novel of the same name that was written by Scott Smith. It is a fairly good adaptation of the book and is a modern day morality tale, which sees people's lives change significantly, when they come upon a veritable treasure trove of money. The change is not necessarily for the better, as the viewer will discover.The plot revolves around two, small town brothers, Hank (Bill Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend, Lou (Brent Briscoe), inadvertently come upon a downed plane that is buried in the snow, deep in the woods of a rural area. In that plane is a dead pilot, along with over four million dollars in cold, hard cash. All three of them could sure use the money. The question is, what are they going to do about it?They come up with what they think is a simple plan. They will take the money and just wait and see, not spending it, until the coast seems clear. From the moment they make this decision, life is never the same for any of them. Hank, taking charge of the money for safekeeping, begins to undergo a change that is seemingly uncharacteristic of one who is outwardly so respectable, rational, and benign of countenance.As the issue of the money begins to divide the three accomplices, greed and betrayal bubble to the surface, to culminate in a series of chilling, cold-blooded murders. Meanwhile, Hank, manipulated by his Ma Barker of a wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), begins a personal downward spiral, succumbing to an evil so profound, that it will leave the viewer open mouthed.What happens to them all makes for an amazingly powerful and riveting drama. Fine performances are given by the entire cast. Pill Paxton is perfect in the role of Hank, the college educated, clean cut, family man with a secret moral ambiguity that makes him susceptible to his wife's Machiavellian behind-the-scenes direction. Hank has no clear moral compass. He really would like to keep the money, but wants reassurances from his wife that it would be okay to do so. His wife, a corn fed, all American miss, has no qualms about what to do, and Hank is too morally weak to resist in the face of his wife's wily machinations.Billy Bob Thornton steals the show in the role of Jacob,  the good ole boy, knuckle dragging, older brother who lost his inheritance, the family farm, so Hank could go to college. Unlike Hank, he has no job, no home, no wife, no children,  and other than Hank, no family. He lives in a squalid apartment with his dog. He, however, has more of a moral compass than Hank has, and is reluctantly locked into a series of actions that make him sort of lose his lease on life.  The viewer can see the personal angst that Jacob is undergoing and cannot help but be moved by Billy Bob Thornton's poignant performance.Brent Briscoe does a fine job in the role of Lou, Jacob's best friend and the unemployed town drunk. He is a guy of limited intelligence who sees the money as a way out of his predicament, and wants his share sooner rather than later. His impatience and poor impulse control set off a series of events that lead to betrayal and his silencing. Bridget Fonda, looking like a blue ribbon winner in a county fair pie baking contest, gives a  fine performance as the coolly collected Sarah, the wife who plots and plans Hank's moves. Of all of them, she is the one who wants the money the most and will stop at nothing to get it.While the film deviates somewhat from the book, and the film's ending lacks the ultimate retribution for Hank and Sarah's sins and their role in the debacle created by  their desire for the  money, it is a still a wonderful and powerful morality tale. The screenplay is well-crafted, the cast is excellent, and the direction is deft. This is an engrossing film that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.",5,"MONEY IS, INDEED,  THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL...",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3884,"['film', 'adaptation', 'what', 'doubt', 'amazing', 'debut', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'written', 'Scott', 'Smith', 'fairly', 'good', 'adaptation', 'book', 'modern', 'day', 'morality', 'tale', 'people', 'lives', 'change', 'significantly', 'when', 'come', 'veritable', 'treasure', 'trove', 'money', 'change', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'viewer', 'will', 'discover.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'two', 'small', 'town', 'brothers', 'Hank', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Jacob', 'Mitchell', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'Jacob', 'friend', 'Lou', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'inadvertently', 'come', 'downed', 'plane', 'buried', 'snow', 'deep', 'woods', 'rural', 'area', 'plane', 'dead', 'pilot', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'cold', 'hard', 'cash', 'three', 'could', 'sure', 'use', 'money', 'question', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'what', 'think', 'simple', 'plan', 'will', 'take', 'money', 'just', 'wait', 'see', 'not', 'spending', 'coast', 'clear', 'moment', 'make', 'decision', 'life', 'never', 'same', 'Hank', 'taking', 'charge', 'money', 'safekeeping', 'undergo', 'change', 'seemingly', 'uncharacteristic', 'one', 'who', 'outwardly', 'so', 'respectable', 'rational', 'benign', 'countenance.As', 'issue', 'money', 'divide', 'three', 'accomplices', 'greed', 'betrayal', 'bubble', 'surface', 'culminate', 'series', 'chilling', 'cold-blooded', 'murders', 'Meanwhile', 'Hank', 'manipulated', 'Ma', 'Barker', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'personal', 'downward', 'spiral', 'succumbing', 'evil', 'so', 'profound', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'open', 'mouthed.What', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'riveting', 'drama', 'Fine', 'performances', 'are', 'given', 'entire', 'cast', 'Pill', 'Paxton', 'perfect', 'role', 'Hank', 'college', 'educated', 'clean', 'cut', 'family', 'man', 'secret', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'susceptible', 'wife', 'Machiavellian', 'behind-the-scenes', 'direction', 'Hank', 'clear', 'moral', 'compass', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'keep', 'money', 'reassurances', 'wife', 'would', 'be', 'okay', 'do', 'so', 'wife', 'corn', 'fed', 'American', 'miss', 'qualms', 'what', 'do', 'Hank', 'too', 'morally', 'weak', 'resist', 'face', 'wife', 'wily', 'machinations.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'show', 'role', 'Jacob', 'good', 'ole', 'boy', 'knuckle', 'dragging', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'lost', 'inheritance', 'family', 'farm', 'Hank', 'could', 'go', 'college', 'Hank', 'job', 'home', 'wife', 'children', 'other', 'Hank', 'family', 'squalid', 'apartment', 'dog', 'however', 'more', 'moral', 'compass', 'Hank', 'reluctantly', 'locked', 'series', 'actions', 'make', 'sort', 'lose', 'lease', 'life', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'personal', 'angst', 'Jacob', 'undergoing', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'poignant', 'performance.Brent', 'Briscoe', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Lou', 'Jacob', 'best', 'friend', 'unemployed', 'town', 'drunk', 'guy', 'limited', 'intelligence', 'who', 'money', 'way', 'predicament', 'share', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'impatience', 'poor', 'impulse', 'control', 'set', 'off', 'series', 'events', 'lead', 'betrayal', 'silencing', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'looking', 'blue', 'ribbon', 'winner', 'county', 'fair', 'pie', 'baking', 'contest', 'fine', 'performance', 'coolly', 'collected', 'Sarah', 'wife', 'who', 'Hank', 'moves', 'one', 'who', 'money', 'most', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'film', 'somewhat', 'book', 'film', 'ending', 'ultimate', 'retribution', 'Hank', 'Sarah', 'sins', 'role', 'debacle', 'created', 'desire', 'money', 'still', 'wonderful', 'powerful', 'morality', 'tale', 'screenplay', 'well-crafted', 'cast', 'excellent', 'direction', 'deft', 'engrossing', 'film', 'worthy', 'being', 'one', 'personal', 'collection']",N/A
463411,A17UL6RVPNK5IS,6305417806,Luke D Jasenosky,"[8, 18]","I was looking forward to &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; as I like Sam Raimi,  and I had heard a number of positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I was very  disappointed. The movie started off well enough - the atmosphere was  strong, Paxton's and Thornton's characters were sympathetic and  interesting, and the plot had potential.  Then, the film fell into the same  trap a number of recent films have fallen into (i.e. &quot;Being John  Malkovich&quot;, &quot;Election&quot;) - it forced a main character that  had been presented to the viewer as sympathetic to something completely  amoral and out of character to move the plot along.  When Paxton's  character gruesomely murdered the old man in the field, the film went  spiralling out of control.  I could not accept that this character, who had  been presented as a moral, intelligent man, would commit this act.  One  might argue that the film is trying to make a point - that anyone can turn  to murder if he or she feels he or she as no other choice.  That argument  doesn't work for this film.  There are a number of reasons why this act was  unnecessary, and to have the most reasonable character in the film forced  to commit it compounds the problems.  With the main character no longer  credible, the film drags on episodically and for far too long.  Fonda's  character also changes unrealistically - she becomes greedy and complicit  in her husband's unbelievable crimes almost instantaneously - she  originally was presented as a sensible, decent person.  I am not arguing  that a sympathetic character in a movie cannot change.  For the movie to  work, however, the change the character goes through MUST be believable.  The director can create this environment by either drawing a more complex  characterization of the character in question so the viewer can accept the  appearance of a &quot;different side&quot; of the character, or by putting  the character in such an unquestionably impossible situation that the  viewer can accept that the character has no other choice. &quot;A Simple  Plan&quot; fails on both counts.The string of killings that follow are  predictable and of little relevance to the story.  The Thornton character  is used as a sentimental ploy for the viewer to latch onto - we are  supposed to sympathize with this slow, victimized man as he and his brother  get further and further into trouble.  He is given earthy monologues about  building a farm and an empathetic camera.  This just doesn't work.  The  whole relationship between his brother and him is too obviously like that  of Lenny and George from &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;.  His final request of  his brother is supposed to be moving, but it rings false.  Unlike &quot;Of  Mice and Men&quot;, his original murderous act was followed by further  murderous acts, and these acts were sanctioned by his brother.  Paxton's  character  suddenly &quot;learns&quot; from his brother at the film's end,  but the lesson he &quot;learns&quot; was already part of his character at  the film's start, and he only &quot;unlearned&quot; it for dramatic effect  and the plot to push on.",1,People don't act this way,960508800,"06 9, 2000",2000,3118,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'quot', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'quot', 'like', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'had', 'heard', 'number', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'strong', 'Paxton', 'Thornton', 'characters', 'were', 'sympathetic', 'interesting', 'plot', 'had', 'potential', 'Then', 'film', 'fell', 'same', 'trap', 'number', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'fallen', 'i.e', 'quot', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'quot', 'quot', 'Election', 'quot', 'forced', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'viewer', 'sympathetic', 'something', 'completely', 'amoral', 'character', 'move', 'plot', 'When', 'Paxton', 'character', 'gruesomely', 'murdered', 'old', 'man', 'field', 'film', 'went', 'spiralling', 'control', 'could', 'not', 'accept', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'presented', 'moral', 'intelligent', 'man', 'would', 'commit', 'act', 'One', 'might', 'argue', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'anyone', 'can', 'turn', 'murder', 'other', 'choice', 'argument', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'are', 'number', 'reasons', 'why', 'act', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'have', 'most', 'reasonable', 'character', 'film', 'forced', 'commit', 'problems', 'main', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'credible', 'film', 'episodically', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Fonda', 'character', 'also', 'unrealistically', 'greedy', 'complicit', 'husband', 'unbelievable', 'crimes', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'originally', 'was', 'presented', 'sensible', 'decent', 'person', 'am', 'not', 'arguing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'movie', 'work', 'however', 'change', 'character', 'MUST', 'be', 'believable', 'director', 'can', 'create', 'environment', 'drawing', 'more', 'complex', 'characterization', 'character', 'question', 'viewer', 'can', 'accept', 'appearance', 'quot', 'different', 'side', 'quot', 'character', 'putting', 'character', 'such', 'unquestionably', 'impossible', 'situation', 'viewer', 'can', 'accept', 'character', 'other', 'choice', 'quot', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'quot', 'counts.The', 'string', 'killings', 'follow', 'are', 'predictable', 'little', 'relevance', 'story', 'Thornton', 'character', 'used', 'sentimental', 'ploy', 'viewer', 'latch', 'are', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'slow', 'victimized', 'man', 'brother', 'get', 'further', 'further', 'trouble', 'given', 'earthy', 'monologues', 'building', 'farm', 'empathetic', 'camera', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'relationship', 'brother', 'too', 'obviously', 'Lenny', 'George', 'quot', 'Mice', 'Men', 'quot', 'final', 'request', 'brother', 'supposed', 'be', 'moving', 'false', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Mice', 'Men', 'quot', 'original', 'murderous', 'act', 'was', 'followed', 'further', 'murderous', 'acts', 'acts', 'were', 'sanctioned', 'brother', 'Paxton', 'character', 'suddenly', 'quot', 'quot', 'brother', 'film', 'end', 'lesson', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'already', 'part', 'character', 'film', 'start', 'only', 'quot', 'unlearned', 'quot', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'plot', 'push']",N/A

463413,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,6305417806,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[8, 9]","This is the story of three men: Hank (Bill Paxton), Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), and Lou (Brent Briscoe).  Hank is Jacob's younger brother; Lou is just a friend.  Hank is married and his wife is expecting; Lou is married also; Jacob is single.  The three men go out hunting in the cold Minnesota woods when they happen upon a wrecked plane.  Inside the plane is a gym bag, and inside the gym bag is the American Dream: 4.4 million dollars in cold hard cash!  The men then devise a simple plan to hide the money; however, as greed overcomes the men, the simple plan becomes an evil plot.  As greed claims Hank's wife (Bridget Fonda) as its next victim, the plot continues to lead to corruption after corruption, murder after murder, sin after sin, and--ultimately--extreme tragedy.Although Siskel and Ebert call this film a &quot;razor-sharp thriller&quot;, and although the back of the film's cover describes it like one, IMHO it is not really a thriller.  I personally think this film is more of a drama, especially since it doesn't really have the gripping suspense or the action the way most thrillers do.  But the true beauty of the film lies not in how exciting it can be, but more how haunting and stirring it is in its depiction of good people turned bad.In fact, this film is very quiet and completely devoid of big explosions, massive gun fights, car chases, or even loud background music.  The musical score and winter scenery are perfect for the mood; cold, bleak, icy, quiet, bitter, and lonely.  It all works really well in conveying its chilling message.  Thornton and Paxton deliver fantastic performances as well.My only major complaint is that you can guess the ending from a million miles away.  Nevertheless, this film has quite a story to tell, and it is definitely worth a view.

This is the question the movie poses.The trio, which is composed of two brothers, Hank and Jacob Miller [Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton], and their friend Lou [Brent Briscoe], hash out a solution. Hank will keep the duffel bag until spring arrives, when they assume the wreck will be discovered. If no one mentions the money, they will then divide it. This is the simple plan, which soon begins to unravel.There are several interesting themes here. One is about money. What happens when people who are stuck in a humdrum life suddenly find a means of escape? Another is greed. Do very high stakes bring out this vice in people, even if they think they don't have it? Then there is the burden of having to keep a very big secret. After all, most people have a hard time keeping little ones.We have come to expect fine performances from Billy Bob Thornton. He dazzled in Primary Colors, The Apostle, and, of course, Sling Blade. He was the only character in Armageddon who thought he was supposed to actually act. A Simple Plan is his best movie to date. His Jacob is simpleminded on the surface, yet by the end, we are left thinking that he may really be the brightest one in the bunch. Bill Paxton, who usually is seen as background to special effects in fare like Titanic, shows here an intelligence and a presence no one knew he had. As Hank's devious, plotting wife, Sarah, Bridget Fonda puts another notch in a fine acting career.Director Sam Raimi has a cult following due to his stylish work in horror movies, such as Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. This is his first foray into a straight thriller, and he does an impeccable job.The photography is above average. The bleakness of the winter landscape mirrors the plight the characters find themselves in. In this aspect, the movie is very much like the Coen brothers remarkable Fargo, which is probably still in most video stores.While some people will be put off by the seriousness of the story, which is both thriller and character study, other will find it both rewarding and engrossing. The ending is not happy, but can any story involving greed end otherwise?",4,Dark thriller enhanced by brilliant acting,1016841600,"03 23, 2002",2002,2758,"['dark', 'reflective', 'thriller', 'sure', 'delight', 'viewers', 'who', 'require', 'more', 'just', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'diets', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'films', 'probably', 'more', 'predictable', 'makers', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'directing', 'easily', 'flaws.In', 'middle', 'Minnesota', 'winter', 'three', 'small', 'town', 'men', 'stumble', 'wreckage', 'small', 'aircraft', 'are', 'survivors', 'looking', 'around', 'guys', 'find', 'duffle', 'bag', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'can', 'sit', 'easy', 'chair', 'think', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'actually', 'happened', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'do', 'question', 'movie', 'poses.The', 'trio', 'composed', 'two', 'brothers', 'Hank', 'Jacob', 'Miller', '[', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', ']', 'friend', 'Lou', '[', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', ']', 'out', 'solution', 'Hank', 'will', 'keep', 'duffel', 'bag', 'spring', 'arrives', 'when', 'assume', 'wreck', 'will', 'be', 'discovered', 'one', 'money', 'will', 'then', 'divide', 'simple', 'plan', 'soon', 'are', 'several', 'interesting', 'themes', 'here', 'One', 'money', 'What', 'when', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'stuck', 'humdrum', 'life', 'suddenly', 'find', 'means', 'escape', 'greed', 'Do', 'very', 'high', 'stakes', 'bring', 'out', 'vice', 'people', 'even', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Then', 'burden', 'having', 'keep', 'very', 'big', 'secret', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'little', 'ones.We', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'fine', 'performances', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'dazzled', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'Apostle', 'course', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'Armageddon', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'actually', 'act', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'best', 'movie', 'date', 'Jacob', 'simpleminded', 'surface', 'yet', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'thinking', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'brightest', 'one', 'bunch', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'who', 'usually', 'seen', 'background', 'special', 'effects', 'fare', 'Titanic', 'here', 'intelligence', 'presence', 'one', 'knew', 'had', 'Hank', 'devious', 'plotting', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'notch', 'fine', 'acting', 'career.Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'cult', 'following', 'due', 'stylish', 'work', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Army', 'Darkness', 'first', 'foray', 'straight', 'thriller', 'impeccable', 'job.The', 'photography', 'above', 'average', 'bleakness', 'winter', 'landscape', 'mirrors', 'plight', 'characters', 'find', 'aspect', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'remarkable', 'Fargo', 'probably', 'still', 'most', 'video', 'stores.While', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'seriousness', 'story', 'thriller', 'character', 'study', 'other', 'will', 'find', 'rewarding', 'engrossing', 'ending', 'not', 'happy', 'can', 'story', 'involving', 'greed', 'end', 'otherwise']",N/A

Smith's &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; is an astounding novel; it's depiction of how  money can change simple, honest people into murdering, greedy criminals is  assembled so meticulously and perfectly, you can't believe you have just  read what you have read!  Mr. Smith then had the task of writing a  screenplay to bring this marvelous book to the screen.  Unfortunately,  cinematic bureaucracy must have dictated some major changes not only in the  plot of the book, but also in the actual personality and motivations of the  characters.  As in most cases, the book far outshines the movie, but  nonetheless, Sam Raimi's film version is still an outstanding and  overlooked film.  The movie got released at the last minute in 1998 to  qualify for Oscars, and undoubtedly, it was worthy of more nominations than  it received.  But after that, the movie got lost and wasn't seen in as many  theaters as it should have been.  What people missed is an outstanding  performance by Billy Bob Thornton (who should have won his Oscar); Bill  Paxton and Bridget Fonda (who should have been nominated); and Scott  Smith's tight script (nominated).  Credit goes to Mr. Smith for managing to  infuse the film with the same sense of hopelessness and despair as in his  book, even if the omissions in plot and characterization are missed by the  book's readers.  So, if you haven't read the book, you are in for a real  treat.  Enjoy.

463423,A2M1N8G4W4END8,6305417806,Michael R Gates,"[1, 3]","On a snowy day in the rural Midwest, three men--two brothers and one of their buddies--stumble across the wreckage of a small airplane and discover that there is over $4,000,000 in cash (and a very dead pilot) on board.  Realizing that the money is probably the ill-gotten spoils of some sort of criminal activity, the trio devises a ""simple"" plan that may allow them to keep the booty: they all agree to sit on the cash for a few months and wait for any possible indication that the law is searching for it.  If it turns out that the money is marked or traceable, they will dispose of it; if it's clean, they'll split it up evenly and go their separate ways.  Unfortunately, the plan doesn't turn out to be as simple as it first seemed, and soon the three men find their lives turned inside out by mistrust, paranoia, betrayal, and ultimately murder.Based on the 1993 debut novel of author Scott Smith (who also wrote this screenplay adaptation), A SIMPLE PLAN is a gripping story that plays both as a psychological thriller and as a horror film of sorts. In the vein of a good psychological thriller, it questions the nature of good and evil in our modern world as it examines the lives of three small-town citizens who become utterly consumed by unfettered greed.  As a modern horror film, it is one of those cautionary tales that warns how even the best of us might be tempted to justify the most egregious acts of immorality if we allow ourselves to succumb to the lust for money.The performances of the major players in A SIMPLE PLAN are jaw-droppingly realistic.  In their portrayals of two brothers who, though separated by differences in education levels and income brackets, still back each other when the chips are down, Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton seem to rip the personas of their characters directly from the pages of Smith's brilliantly written novel, yet they do so with an honesty and warmth that could almost make one believe they are off-screen family. Brent Briscoe's portrayal of the white-trash buddy who completes the story's trio of treasure-finders is also an Oscar-caliber study in gritty realism, and Bridget Fonda delivers what is probably one of her best performances in her role of a bubbly upper-middle-class wife who gets caught up in dangerous circumstances beyond her control.  And in a minor role, actor Gary Cole offers up a deliciously devious turn as one of the film's traditional baddies.Director Sam Raimi, better known for directing the cult horror classic THE EVIL DEAD (1981) and the Tobey Maguire SPIDERMAN films, does a top-notch job in bringing Smith's novel to the big screen.

But as is often the case with Paramount DVDs, there is little offered by way of extras or bonus features.

463426,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6305417806,Mr. Cairene,"[2, 3]","A black crow stands on a tree branch in the bleak winter of a frozen Minnesota forest. Its opaque black color against the bright white snow is  the token startling image of Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan. Under the crow's  gaze two men are ecstatic but one is worried. They have found &quot;the  American dream in a duffle bag&quot; as one of them describes it. As the  drunk Lou(Brent Briscoe) and the slow witted Jacob(Billy Bob Thorton)  convince the upstanding Hank(Bill Paxton) of keeping the four million  dollars they have found in an abandoned plane. Jacob looks up at the crow  and says: &quot;They wait for things to die, so they could eat them. What a  wierd job.&quot; The bird stares back. And waits.The money is  foremost an event that activates a dormant  family bitterness between the  college educated, employed and married Hank and his lonely and jobless  brother Jacob. As the tension mounts Jacob is used like a pawn in battle of  wills between Lou who wants to spend the money and his brother Hank who  wants to sit on it till they're sure it is safe to do that. Caught between  the only friend he has ever had and a brother who has never reached out to  him, Thorton's performance is brilliant in the way he embodies desolate  loneliness and buried hurt. In scene of astonishing emotional impact he  confesses to his brother he has never kissed a girl, that a girl to  appeared to date him in school was infact doing it as a bet, that he  wouldn't mind having a woman be with him &quot;even it was just for the  money&quot;.In thrillers, weather they are about hiests or  fugitives, the magnitude of the events usually makes the characters behave  in an extreme fashion. The adrenaline of the thriller's events blinding its  characters, dissolving the grey unresolved emotions of everyday life. They  become black and white. Heroes and villians. Although A Simple Plan is a  superb thriller, it never forgets that these characters are human beings  before they drove the plot forward. As a result the film also becomes a  deeply absorbing human tragedy.I remember reading Scott B.Smith's  sterling novel of the same name, and I approached the film with skepticism.  Afterall the director Sam Raimi is better knowm for films where severed  limbs have a mind of their own. In adapting his own novel, Smith tightened  it up, omitting a brutal murder towards the end and more significantly  changing a scene where in the novel it was a cold blooded murder, in the  film version it has an element of self defense. I believe this was a wise  choice because in the novel form he had more time to explain how the  characters justified thier actions to themselves. Had he kept those scenes  in the film, he would have lost the sympathy of the audience. Raimi also  shows admirable restraint, putting the characters first and letting  actors(all superb) shine. With the help of an unintrusive but brilliant  Danny Elfman score, he is able to create a chilling atmosphere that never  overwhelms the film.The most significant scene comes towards the  beginning of the film. As Hank comes home to his lovely, soon to be Lady  Macbeth, housewife, he asks her a theoretical question: &quot;Suppose you  found lost money, would you keep it?&quot;. She says that she wouldn't but  has a complete moral u-turn once he spills four million dollars on their  living room table. While watching the scene I asked myself if I would keep  the money. I would. And I would live to regret it.",4,The Dissolving Grey,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,3481,"['black', 'crow', 'tree', 'branch', 'bleak', 'winter', 'frozen', 'Minnesota', 'forest', 'opaque', 'black', 'color', 'bright', 'white', 'snow', 'token', 'startling', 'image', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'crow', 'gaze', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'ecstatic', 'one', 'worried', 'have', 'found', 'quot', 'American', 'dream', 'duffle', 'bag', 'quot', 'one', 'drunk', 'Lou', 'Brent', 'Briscoe', 'slow', 'witted', 'Jacob', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'convince', 'upstanding', 'Hank', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'keeping', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'have', 'found', 'abandoned', 'plane', 'Jacob', 'up', 'crow', 'quot', 'wait', 'things', 'die', 'could', 'eat', 'What', 'wierd', 'job.', 'quot', 'bird', 'back', 'waits.The', 'money', 'foremost', 'event', 'dormant', 'family', 'bitterness', 'college', 'educated', 'employed', 'married', 'Hank', 'lonely', 'jobless', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'tension', 'mounts', 'Jacob', 'used', 'pawn', 'battle', 'wills', 'Lou', 'who', 'spend', 'money', 'brother', 'Hank', 'who', 'sit', ""'re"", 'sure', 'safe', 'do', 'Caught', 'only', 'friend', 'ever', 'had', 'brother', 'who', 'never', 'reached', 'out', 'Thorton', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'way', 'desolate', 'loneliness', 'buried', 'hurt', 'scene', 'astonishing', 'emotional', 'impact', 'brother', 'never', 'kissed', 'girl', 'girl', 'appeared', 'date', 'school', 'was', 'infact', 'doing', 'bet', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'having', 'woman', 'be', 'quot', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'money', 'quot', 'thrillers', 'weather', 'are', 'hiests', 'fugitives', 'magnitude', 'events', 'usually', 'characters', 'behave', 'extreme', 'fashion', 'adrenaline', 'thriller', 'events', 'blinding', 'characters', 'dissolving', 'grey', 'unresolved', 'emotions', 'everyday', 'life', 'become', 'black', 'white', 'Heroes', 'villians', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'superb', 'thriller', 'never', 'characters', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'drove', 'plot', 'forward', 'result', 'film', 'also', 'deeply', 'absorbing', 'human', 'tragedy.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'Scott', 'B.Smith', 'sterling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'approached', 'film', 'skepticism', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'better', 'knowm', 'films', 'where', 'severed', 'limbs', 'have', 'mind', 'own', 'adapting', 'own', 'novel', 'Smith', 'tightened', 'up', 'omitting', 'brutal', 'murder', 'end', 'more', 'significantly', 'changing', 'scene', 'where', 'novel', 'was', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murder', 'film', 'version', 'element', 'self', 'defense', 'believe', 'was', 'wise', 'choice', 'novel', 'form', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'explain', 'how', 'characters', 'justified', 'thier', 'actions', 'Had', 'kept', 'scenes', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'Raimi', 'also', 'admirable', 'restraint', 'putting', 'characters', 'first', 'letting', 'actors', 'superb', 'shine', 'help', 'unintrusive', 'brilliant', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'able', 'create', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'never', 'overwhelms', 'film.The', 'most', 'significant', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'Hank', 'home', 'lovely', 'soon', 'be', 'Lady', 'Macbeth', 'housewife', 'theoretical', 'question', 'quot', 'Suppose', 'found', 'lost', 'money', 'would', 'keep', 'quot', 'would', ""n't"", 'complete', 'moral', 'u-turn', 'once', 'four', 'million', 'dollars', 'living', 'room', 'table', 'watching', 'scene', 'asked', 'would', 'keep', 'money', 'would', 'would', 'live', 'regret']",N/A
463427,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,6305417806,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[6, 27]","A Simple Plan starred one of my favorite, most underrated actors in Bill Paxton.  Unfortunately, I had the poor fate of being forced to watch this terrible film in class.  So allow me to warn all those who intend to buy this: don't purchase this film, it's not as great as you may think and you will not walk away from it satisfied because it is a highly disturbing picture that tried to create moral values by destroying others.I really enjoyed how this film began, three guys, two of whom are brothers, discover a downed plane and inside of it is a suit case full of cash, millions worth.  Paxton's character is the only one out of the three of them who wants to turn the cash into the police, he's a stand up, moral guy who wants to do what's right.  But he caves in to his brother and buddy and they decide to form a simple plan: if nobody puts an ad out to claim it they keep the money for themselves.  That's the ""simple plan.""  Gee, I guess the director thought all of us viewers were morons because I wonder what happens instead?Bridget Fonda's character is a flake: she starts off as this moral wife who attempts to be the conscience of her husband, which is Paxton, but almost instantly becomes this greedy female dog who hordes over the cash.  A complete turn around in character.  What's disturbing is this isn't the only character in this film that completely turns around and abandons all forms of a moral guidance.  It's almost as if nobody in this film has any back bone, any moral fiber, that they are instead controlled by money.As much as greed is a serious flaw in people, making people who start out as moral good guys/girls and instantly transforming them into Scrooges is rather cliche for this movie and I think unreal.  Fonda's sudden turn doesn't nearly bother me as the drastic, disturbing turn of Bill Paxton's character.As the movie progresses, Paxton's character is practically responsible for two deaths.  The first death is the worst, where he MURDERS an old man.  How can we possibly sympathize with a guy who committs cold blooded murder?  I understand the objective of this film, but even films that play off the dark side of mankind need a character we can trust, enjoy, and sympathize because we know he's at least TRYING to do the right thing.  Paxton starts out as trying to do the right thing, then he shifts to trying to do the wrong thing.  This isn't character development, despite what most of you may think.  This is called stepping out of character because Paxton's character just switches, it doesn't develop.  There's a difference.  In fact Paxton's character, the initial character dies in my mind because he isn't even a shade of the character Paxton finishes the film with.I also thought the violence in this film was totally unnecessary.  It was totally out of control and very yahoo like.  I mean, Paxton's best friend tries to kill him with a sawed off shot-gun?  Then his buddy's wife reaches into a cookie jar and pulls out a revolver and also tries to kill Paxton?  But Paxton blows her guts out in defense? Then Paxton's character, mercilessly, blows the brains out of the bad guy in the end?  And the kicker, the absolute worst part of the film is when Paxton's brother gets all depressed in the end and he wants to die so he asks Paxton to shoot him.  And he does!  He shoots his own brother!  What is this film?!  What is up with Paxton's character?  He goes around blowing people away, he began as a character with a moral back bone and yet he commits more murders and is responsible for more deaths than Ted Bundy!  And people think his character is sympathetic?This is an awful film.  I understand the moral point about greed, but while trying to teach us that point the film makes the characters totally unbelievable by making them switch into these dark, evil people who go around shooting their own family members!  I mean this is insane, I can't believe people actually think this is a good movie.  I give it two stars because at least it goes through with its lesson, unfortunately it costed itself three stars by giving us characters we can't possibly relate to or sympathize with because most of us wouldn't turn 180 degrees because we found some loot.  We may horde over it, but would we be willing to kill and murder for it?  Think about it, because according to this film you would.",2,A simple plan is simply terrible,1062201600,"08 30, 2003",2003,4356,"['Simple', 'Plan', 'starred', 'one', 'favorite', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'poor', 'fate', 'being', 'forced', 'watch', 'terrible', 'film', 'class', 'So', 'allow', 'warn', 'who', 'intend', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'great', 'may', 'think', 'will', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'satisfied', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'tried', 'create', 'moral', 'values', 'destroying', 'others.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'film', 'began', 'three', 'guys', 'two', 'whom', 'are', 'brothers', 'discover', 'downed', 'plane', 'inside', 'suit', 'case', 'full', 'cash', 'millions', 'worth', 'Paxton', 'character', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'who', 'turn', 'cash', 'police', 'stand', 'up', 'moral', 'guy', 'who', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'brother', 'buddy', 'decide', 'form', 'simple', 'plan', 'nobody', 'ad', 'claim', 'keep', 'money', 'simple', 'plan', 'Gee', 'guess', 'director', 'thought', 'viewers', 'were', 'morons', 'wonder', 'what', 'instead', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'character', 'flake', 'off', 'moral', 'wife', 'who', 'be', 'conscience', 'husband', 'Paxton', 'almost', 'instantly', 'greedy', 'female', 'dog', 'who', 'cash', 'complete', 'turn', 'around', 'character', 'What', 'disturbing', ""n't"", 'only', 'character', 'film', 'completely', 'around', 'abandons', 'forms', 'moral', 'guidance', 'almost', 'nobody', 'film', 'back', 'bone', 'moral', 'fiber', 'are', 'instead', 'controlled', 'money.As', 'much', 'greed', 'serious', 'flaw', 'people', 'making', 'people', 'who', 'start', 'out', 'moral', 'good', 'guys/girls', 'instantly', 'transforming', 'Scrooges', 'rather', 'cliche', 'movie', 'think', 'unreal', 'Fonda', 'sudden', 'turn', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'bother', 'drastic', 'disturbing', 'turn', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'character.As', 'movie', 'Paxton', 'character', 'practically', 'responsible', 'two', 'deaths', 'first', 'death', 'worst', 'where', 'MURDERS', 'old', 'man', 'How', 'can', 'possibly', 'sympathize', 'guy', 'who', 'committs', 'cold', 'blooded', 'murder', 'understand', 'objective', 'film', 'even', 'films', 'play', 'dark', 'side', 'mankind', 'need', 'character', 'can', 'trust', 'enjoy', 'sympathize', 'know', 'least', 'TRYING', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Paxton', 'out', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'then', 'trying', 'do', 'wrong', 'thing', ""n't"", 'character', 'development', 'what', 'most', 'may', 'think', 'called', 'stepping', 'character', 'Paxton', 'character', 'just', 'switches', ""n't"", 'develop', 'difference', 'fact', 'Paxton', 'character', 'initial', 'character', 'dies', 'mind', ""n't"", 'even', 'shade', 'character', 'Paxton', 'film', 'with.I', 'also', 'thought', 'violence', 'film', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'totally', 'control', 'very', 'yahoo', 'mean', 'Paxton', 'best', 'friend', 'kill', 'sawed', 'shot-gun', 'Then', 'buddy', 'wife', 'cookie', 'jar', 'out', 'revolver', 'also', 'kill', 'Paxton', 'Paxton', 'guts', 'out', 'defense', 'Then', 'Paxton', 'character', 'mercilessly', 'brains', 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'kicker', 'absolute', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Paxton', 'brother', 'depressed', 'end', 'die', 'so', 'Paxton', 'shoot', 'shoots', 'own', 'brother', 'What', 'film', 'What', 'up', 'Paxton', 'character', 'blowing', 'people', 'away', 'began', 'character', 'moral', 'back', 'bone', 'yet', 'more', 'murders', 'responsible', 'more', 'deaths', 'Ted', 'Bundy', 'people', 'think', 'character', 'sympathetic', 'awful', 'film', 'understand', 'moral', 'point', 'greed', 'trying', 'teach', 'point', 'film', 'characters', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'making', 'switch', 'dark', 'evil', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'shooting', 'own', 'family', 'members', 'mean', 'insane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'people', 'actually', 'think', 'good', 'movie', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'least', 'lesson', 'unfortunately', 'costed', 'three', 'stars', 'giving', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'relate', 'sympathize', 'most', 'would', ""n't"", 'turn', '180', 'degrees', 'found', 'loot', 'may', 'horde', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'kill', 'murder', 'Think', 'according', 'film', 'would']",N/A

A Simple Plan, Sam Raimi's (the Evil Dead trilogy, Spider-Man) critically acclaimed thriller, despite it's flaws, has a lot going for it, and for the most part fails to disappoint.  When brothers Hank (Bill Paxton) and Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) and their friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) stumble across a crashed plane with a sack loaded with cash, they conceive a simple plan to hide it for a year and keep their mouths shut.  But this simple plan goes awry after a series of events that tear everyone apart, and changes them all forever.  Paxton, and especially Thornton, are superb.  These two actors give powerhouse performances that must be seen to believed.  Bridget Fonda's performance as Paxton's wife however doesn't come off as too believeable though.

One of the reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because of Bridget Fonda's character. I found aspects of her character to be a little unrealistic. For example, in the beginning (spoiler) when Bill Paxton asks her what she would do if she found 4 million dollars, without the slightest hesitation she says she would definitely hand it in, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. But then not too long after that, she becomes possessed with these crazed ideas on how to keep the money and deceive other people. And finally at the end, after presumably learning that 1/10 of the bills are marked, she's STILL whining and crying with her insane notions of taking the money and running.

It's staying with me and I'm continuing to think about it.""A Simple Plan"" asks the question, ""What if you found $4.4 million in a gym bag in the woods...would you keep it...what if you thought there was a reasonably good chance you'd never get caught...that no one would ever know?""  This is what happens to the central characters.  The DVD cover advertises, ""Sometimes good people do evil things.""  Once they make their decision, and plan their plan, the movie illustrates how consequences happen that are completely unanticipated.Bill Paxton plays the main character and is wonderful as a typical ""good"" middle-class accountant in a small rural town.  Bridget Fonda does an excellent job as his wife, who is very idealistic and moralistic until she realizes that the scenario is not hypothetical---in fact, she has to decide what to do, and she makes decisions different from what I would have expected.  Billy Bob Thornton is predictably great, of course, playing a rural man (the main character's brother) who has never had a chance in the town he lives in and just wants to truly have a life, and in his own way, do what is right; he is handicapped, however, by his intelligence, his eccentricity, and his background.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, and since I'm a person more like his brother, it was fascinating to see how he lived and thought...as the movie progressed, his middle-class brother gained empathy for the difficult life he led, too.I didn't think that any of the pacing was slow, as other reviewers have said.  I thought that the starkness and the pacing fit in beautifully with the movie and it gave me a chance to process what was going on.  One moral decision led to another, and each of them made me think ""Would I do that?"" and ""Could I do that?""  It made me see how seductive certain crimes in certain circumstances can be to any one of us.This is a quality, very suspenseful, provocative film.  I think it would be equally enjoyable for men and women but definitely not for children at all, as the themes are very heavy and mature.There are no special features or subtitles.  I generally like subtitles, but they are not necessary in this film for hearing people, as everyone speaks very clearly.I cannot imagine how anyone would dislike this movie.  There is some violence, but none of it is gratuitous.  I generally really dislike violence in movies, but it was worth it for the experience I took away after watching it.*****",5,Quality Movie That Adults Will Enjoy,1149552000,"06 6, 2006",2006,2554,"['*****I', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'was', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'made', 'think', 'staying', ""'m"", 'continuing', 'think', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'question', 'What', 'found', '4.4', 'million', 'gym', 'bag', 'woods', 'would', 'keep', 'what', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'reasonably', 'good', 'chance', ""'d"", 'never', 'get', 'caught', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'know', 'what', 'central', 'characters', 'DVD', 'cover', 'advertises', 'Sometimes', 'good', 'people', 'do', 'evil', 'things', 'make', 'decision', 'plan', 'plan', 'movie', 'how', 'consequences', 'happen', 'are', 'completely', 'unanticipated.Bill', 'Paxton', 'main', 'character', 'wonderful', 'typical', 'good', 'middle-class', 'accountant', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'excellent', 'job', 'wife', 'who', 'very', 'idealistic', 'moralistic', 'scenario', 'not', 'hypothetical', '-in', 'fact', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'decisions', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'predictably', 'great', 'course', 'playing', 'rural', 'man', 'main', 'character', 'brother', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'town', 'just', 'truly', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'way', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'handicapped', 'however', 'intelligence', 'eccentricity', 'background', 'felt', 'lot', 'sympathy', 'character', ""'m"", 'person', 'more', 'brother', 'was', 'fascinating', 'see', 'how', 'lived', 'thought', 'movie', 'progressed', 'middle-class', 'brother', 'gained', 'empathy', 'difficult', 'life', 'led', 'too.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'pacing', 'was', 'slow', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'thought', 'starkness', 'pacing', 'fit', 'beautifully', 'movie', 'gave', 'chance', 'process', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'One', 'moral', 'decision', 'led', 'made', 'think', 'Would', 'do', 'Could', 'do', 'made', 'see', 'how', 'seductive', 'certain', 'crimes', 'certain', 'circumstances', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'us.This', 'quality', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'provocative', 'film', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'equally', 'enjoyable', 'men', 'women', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'themes', 'are', 'very', 'heavy', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'generally', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'necessary', 'film', 'hearing', 'people', 'everyone', 'very', 'clearly.I', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'how', 'anyone', 'would', 'dislike', 'movie', 'violence', 'none', 'gratuitous', 'generally', 'really', 'dislike', 'violence', 'movies', 'was', 'worth', 'experience', 'took', 'away', 'watching', '*****']",N/A

Spoilers alert.I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance.The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf?When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded.If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.",2,Please enter a title for your review,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2918,"['Interesting', 'premise', 'plot', 'swiss', 'cheese.This', 'review', 'will', 'just', 'be', 'point', 'point', 'major', 'things', 'found', 'so', 'implausable', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'Spoilers', 'alert.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'make', 'leap', 'believing', 'Sarah', 'sudden', 'turn', 'towards', 'malicious', 'opportunism', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'cash', 'When', 'questioned', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'found', 'hypothetical', 'millions', 'chirpy', 'disinterest', 'would', 'certainly', 'turn', 'Just', 'one', 'scene', 'looking', 'longingly', 'brochure', 'holiday', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'would', 'have', 'established', 'repressed', 'dissatisfation', 'life', 'situation', 'general', 'demeanor', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'not', 'only', 'comfort', 'satisfaction.Why', 'did', 'Hank', 'would', 'burn', 'money', 'instead', 'return', 'turned', 'out', 'someone', 'legitimately', 'owned', 'Surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'anonymously', 'return', 'being', 'implicated', 'disappearance.The', 'first', 'murder', 'old', 'guy', 'regained', 'consciousness', 'why', 'did', 'Hank', 'not', 'try', 'negotiate', 'threaten', 'old', 'guy', 'keep', 'quiet', 'brother', 'assaulting', 'Hank', 'finishing', 'job', 'brother', 'started', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'absolute', 'last', 'resort', 'seemed', 'took', 'murder', 'lightly.When', 'Hank', 'got', 'home', 'apparently', 'volunteered', 'information', 'wife', 'what', ""'d"", 'just', 'done', 'What', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'understanding', 'something', 'Hi', 'honey', ""'m"", 'home', 'way', 'just', 'killed', 'man', 'protect', 'money', 'Wtf', 'When', 'Jacob', 'shot', 'Lou', 'protect', 'Hank', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Hank', 'just', 'give', 'tape', 'back', 'got', 'point', 'shotgun', 'impact', 'Lou', 'wife', 'was', 'cartoonishly', 'ridiculous', 'sending', 'flying', 'three', 'feet', 'air', 'when', 'blast', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'hit', 'upward', 'trajectory.And', 'final', 'ridiculous', 'flaw', 'Jacob', 'taking', 'fake', 'FBI', 'agent', 'gun', 'instead', 'just', 'shooting', 'brother', 'had', 'time', 'react', 'brother', 'responsibility', 'killing', 'setting', 'up', 'final', 'emotional', 'crescendo', 'film', 'Supposedly', 'explanation', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'fake', 'FBI', 'agent', 'shot', 'Jacob', 'shot', 'was', 'fired', 'point', 'blank', 'range', 'why', 'not', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'forensic', 'investigators', 'scene', 'believe', 'altercation', 'could', 'have', 'transpired', 'where', 'Jacob', 'charged', 'gunman', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'shoot', 'sheriff', 'wrestled', 'wound', 'up', 'taking', 'point', 'blank', 'shot', 'head', 'really', 'sense.One', 'inspiredly', 'believable', 'moment', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'credit', 'Hank', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'bullets', 'sheriff', 'office', 'loading', 'gun', 'lazier', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'had', 'find', 'gun', 'loaded.If', 'major', 'plot', 'developments', 'were', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'detail', 'be', 'made', 'believable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'frustratingly', 'flaw-ridden', 'glimpse', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'waste', 'time', 'watch']",N/A

463442,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6305417806,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 4]","I got this movie because of the cast.  The first ten minutes were promising, setting up an interesting moral dilemma  involving four characters of different personalities.  Everyone has to ask himself what he'd do if he'd find a gym bag of four million dollars in hundreds.  Most people, I think (hope) would follow the immediate impulse of Hank, the square-jawed, clean cut guy with a good job, a college degree, a nice house and pretty pregant wife.  He said obviously that that they had to turn it in, because it would be a crime not to and if they kept it that they'd be caught and sent to jail.  Good thinking, Hank.Watching him cave in, after a discussion of about five minutes wasn't very convincing but I kept with him as he went home and told his wife, Sarah, about the find.  By this time, though, he doesn't seem to have much moral compunction about keeping the money, but  displays it on the dining room table with a huge grin on his face.  HmmmI kept watching until the incident when Hank kills the old farmer.  His dim-wit brother Jacob, has hit the man and they believe he's dead.  In the process of moving the body, the farmer comes to life.  Rather than being happy that the fellow isn't dead, Hank finishes him off.  This was where I decided to shut the film off.  There is nothing in the film that prepares you for the sudden, drastic change in Hank's behavior.  It was too horrible and although the acting was first rate and the style of the direction was engaging, I chose to opt out. I could tell that things were destined to go from very bad to even worse and I didn't care to stick along for the depressing ride.I don't know if the book was more successful in making this believable.

For one, the three individuals who come across a downed plane with upwards of a million bucks in it devise a plan on how they will be able to keep the money for themselves.  Watching that plan unfold and fall apart is pretty interesting.  Seondly, the movie works because it allows us to see the development of greed through four completely different people.  One is a simple easy-going follower, another is a brash but fairly dim assertive individual, another is a fine, upstanding businessman, and the fourth is his quiet and cautious wife.  Following the changes we see in each of these people becomes a morality play of notable impact.  Finally, the acting is pretty decent which enables us to identify with the individuals all the more.  Billy Bob Thornton is particularly impressive.I enjoyed watching ""A Simple Plan"" and would gladly watch it again.

They think it is drug money, and the police will never know. They decide upon a simple, harmless plan to keep the money. To be safe; they plan to wait to spend the money until the plane is found. If the police say they are looking for the money; they will burn the money. If the police say nothing; they will split the money, and all move out of State. None of them get greedy; none of them try to kill the others for all the money. Their simple plan sounds foolproof and harmless; yet, their plan unravels almost immediately after they commit.They say, One lie leads to more lies to cover it up. How many guys are in prison for murder because they only wanted to rob a convenience-store, but found themselves facing an unwise and slow clerk pulling a gun and having to shoot the clerk in self-defense? This film shows that sin takes you farther than you want to go, and keeps you there longer than you want to stay.When something goes wrong; one guy's wife comes up with a plan to fix it. There are several occasions where she fixes things. These seem like clever plans. The characters make assumptions, and so do we. Though our assumption is the most likely; there are other possibilities. When the wife's plan goes differently than expected; not only is the outcome, which did not cross your mind, believable, but you will say, ""That is the way it certainly would have happened; why did I ever think that was a good plan?""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Do not do a crime with a couple of nitwits as partners; no matter how clever you are. Even if you do a crime with a clever partner; you will always be wondering if your partner is going to tell someone, or have too many drinks and let things slip, or tell the cops for a plea deal.Even had things all gone as planned; we will see it still would not have worked.This movie made me want to turn-in the $2 I found lying on the ground in the park last month.The movie has some very realistic and graphic murder scenes, so I do not recommend this movie to children.",5,A good moral to this story.,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2130,"['Three', 'guys', 'find', 'small', 'plane', 'crashed', 'snow', 'woods', '4-1/2-million', 'dollars', 'think', 'drug', 'money', 'police', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'decide', 'simple', 'harmless', 'plan', 'keep', 'money', 'be', 'safe', 'plan', 'wait', 'spend', 'money', 'plane', 'found', 'police', 'say', 'are', 'looking', 'money', 'will', 'burn', 'money', 'police', 'say', 'nothing', 'will', 'split', 'money', 'move', 'State', 'None', 'get', 'greedy', 'none', 'try', 'kill', 'others', 'money', 'simple', 'plan', 'foolproof', 'harmless', 'yet', 'plan', 'almost', 'immediately', 'commit.They', 'say', 'One', 'lie', 'more', 'lies', 'cover', 'up', 'How', 'many', 'guys', 'are', 'prison', 'murder', 'only', 'wanted', 'rob', 'convenience-store', 'found', 'facing', 'unwise', 'slow', 'clerk', 'pulling', 'gun', 'having', 'shoot', 'clerk', 'self-defense', 'film', 'sin', 'farther', 'want', 'go', 'there', 'longer', 'want', 'stay.When', 'something', 'wrong', 'one', 'guy', 'wife', 'up', 'plan', 'fix', 'are', 'several', 'occasions', 'where', 'fixes', 'things', 'seem', 'clever', 'plans', 'characters', 'make', 'assumptions', 'so', 'do', 'assumption', 'most', 'likely', 'are', 'other', 'possibilities', 'When', 'wife', 'plan', 'differently', 'expected', 'not', 'only', 'outcome', 'did', 'not', 'cross', 'mind', 'believable', 'will', 'say', 'way', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'why', 'did', 'ever', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'plan', 'chain', 'only', 'as', 'strong', 'weakest', 'link', 'Do', 'not', 'do', 'crime', 'couple', 'nitwits', 'partners', 'matter', 'how', 'clever', 'are', 'Even', 'do', 'crime', 'clever', 'partner', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'wondering', 'partner', 'going', 'tell', 'someone', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'drinks', 'let', 'things', 'slip', 'tell', 'cops', 'plea', 'deal.Even', 'had', 'things', 'all', 'gone', 'planned', 'will', 'see', 'still', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked.This', 'movie', 'made', 'want', 'turn-in', '2', 'found', 'lying', 'ground', 'park', 'last', 'month.The', 'movie', 'very', 'realistic', 'graphic', 'murder', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'children']",N/A

This is pretty much  the classical metatragedy, where the true evil lies in the ability of men  to become corrupt through no real fault of their own.Hank Mitchell  (Bill Paxton) and his brother Jacob (Thornton), along with their friend Lou  (Brent Briscoe, a longtime Thornton collaborator), are together when they  discover a wrecked plane containing, in part, $4.3 million. The three  devise a plan that will, conceivably, allow them to keep the money--  assuming no one comes looking for it.Murphy's Law plays as much a  part as the eventual, and necessary, corruption of the three conspirators,  along with Hank's wife (Bridget Fonda). Anything that can go wrong does,  and everyone involved soon finds they're far deeper into this mess than  they ever thought they could get.It's got a lot of potential, and  it's been a while since we've seen a really great metatragedy (thanks in no  small part to the cynicism in American society today). And A Simple Plan  almost, but not quite, gets there. Much of the reason for the movie's  failure can be traced directly to Bill Paxton, who more than once seems to  forget everything he learned in acting school and comes off as wooden and  unconvincing.That said, Thornton, Fonda, and Briscoe are all  fantastic, and make the movie worth watching, at least.

All shouting ""I'm DUMB!"" instead of implying it. Also Billy Bob's idea of acting which is incessantly mumbling in southern white trash got tiresome. The problem with Jacob's (Billy Bob) character was he was supposed to be slightly retarded, but when the plot needed him to come with a slightly brilliant plan, he could. So that left me wondering how really dumb he was and threw off the intensity of the story line.I liked the psychology of how ""good, moral"" people turned into money grubbing murderers as soon as they laid eyes on all that money, the wife especially turned bad in a heart beat. You could see the dollar signs in her eyes. A very convoluted thriller that Hitchcock would have made in his day, probably starring Cary Grant and a gorgeous blond and he'd have made it pretty much bloodier.5 stars if Billy Bob had not been in it, or maybe coming off the Slingblade movie, not have so much clout with the persona of his character.Overall it was a very good little movie.

It reecall &quot;Fargo&quot; both in its Minnesota setting and it's picture of small time losers making a huge mess of being criminals. And the premise is very pretty similar to the Scottish movie ""Shallow Grave"" which put both its director Danny Boyle and star Ewan McGregor on the map.

We know it won't work out. We know there will be a problem of trust between these three (Jacob, while he's the most sympathetic character, is too stupid to be very trustworthy and Lou and Hank have never liked each other much). There is. We know the bad guys will come looking for their cash. They do. We know it will end in tears. It does. Not least, very soon after they take the money, when the body count starts to rise.

463454,A3IXPFN5DU9Z9L,6305417806,Solid Snake,"[2, 4]","Set against the desolation of an upper-Midwest winter, ""a simple plan"" brings to mind another snow blanketed tale of greed-fueled tragedy, namely ""Fargo"". In the Coen brother's cynical depiction of human nature at its worst, the ever-present North Dakota snow became a metaphor for the emotional and ethical bankruptcy of the small town losers who's petty problems led to cold-blooded murder.Sam Rami approaches a similar theme from a somewhat different angle, preferring to frame his protagonists in a kinder light. Rather than mocking them for the smallness of their lives he invites us to see them as average human beings at the mercy of circumstances beyond their control. In his film the snow is more like the clean conscience the characters enjoy before greed and paranoia weave their way through it, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake.The story is self-explanatory. Hank Mitchell(Paxton), his dim-witted brother Jacob (Thornton) and Jacob's redneck friend Lou (Briscoe) get in over their heads when they stumble across 4 million dollars in a downed plane. Good intentions give way to greedy plotting, and the story moves swiftly and predictably to its violent conclusion.What elevates this film above a run of the mill drama is the complexity of the leading characters and the cast's ability to add the necessary depth to their performances. Hank and his expectant wife Sarah (Fonda) have accepted their small town lives and consider themselves content. Jacob and Lou, both unemployed, live on the brink of poverty but seem happy enough drinking beer together and telling dirty jokes. The discovery of the money shakes them out of the limbo of ordinary life, and the prospect of escaping what they suddenly consider a miserable existence quickly consumes them.In short order Sarah's priorities shift from child-rearing to surreptitious plotting, forcing mild mannered Hank, acting as the agent of his wife's machinations, to find in himself the dark heart of a killer. Jacob, who is actually more clever than he seems, foolishly believes that wealth will finally end his loneliness and skillfully draws his brother Hank into his plans to buy back the family farm. Lou, who sees an easy way to shed his loser image, is fully aware that as the only non-Mitchell family member he is the most vulnerable to betrayal. In order to improve his odds he proceeds to erode the bond between Jacob and Hank.Alliances are formed, promises are made, and bitter animosities and painful secrets are laid bare. The bonds of trust unravel, and everyone involved finds themselves committing acts they never thought they were capable of. Ultimately the film is a skillful examination of the weak underpinnings that support civility, family and friendships. These four relatively normal people, Rami shows, are easily broken by ill begotten wealth. What Lou joyfully calls ""The American Dream in a Gym Bag"" turns out to be a nightmare beyond their ability to control. If it can happen to them, the film seems to warn, it can happen to anyone.Rami's serious approach to the material allows us to overlook the occasional narrative stretch, like the fact that the police more or less overlook the mounting body-count, or that no-one discovers the secret of the money before it's too late to undo the damage (a simple phone call probably would have done the trick). These are minor flaws in a well crafted film where the tension, as well as the stakes, escalate with each passing moment. Definitely worth a viewing or two.",4,A Portrait of Greed and Human Frailty,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3509,"['Set', 'desolation', 'upper-Midwest', 'winter', 'simple', 'plan', 'mind', 'snow', 'blanketed', 'tale', 'greed-fueled', 'tragedy', 'namely', 'Fargo', 'Coen', 'brother', 'cynical', 'depiction', 'human', 'nature', 'worst', 'ever-present', 'North', 'Dakota', 'snow', 'became', 'metaphor', 'emotional', 'ethical', 'bankruptcy', 'small', 'town', 'losers', 'who', 'petty', 'problems', 'led', 'cold-blooded', 'murder.Sam', 'Rami', 'similar', 'theme', 'somewhat', 'different', 'angle', 'preferring', 'frame', 'protagonists', 'kinder', 'light', 'Rather', 'mocking', 'smallness', 'lives', 'see', 'average', 'human', 'beings', 'mercy', 'circumstances', 'control', 'film', 'snow', 'more', 'clean', 'conscience', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'greed', 'paranoia', 'weave', 'way', 'leaving', 'trail', 'bodies', 'wake.The', 'story', 'self-explanatory', 'Hank', 'Mitchell', 'Paxton', 'dim-witted', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'Thornton', 'Jacob', 'redneck', 'friend', 'Lou', 'Briscoe', 'get', 'heads', 'when', 'stumble', '4', 'million', 'dollars', 'downed', 'plane', 'Good', 'intentions', 'give', 'way', 'greedy', 'plotting', 'story', 'swiftly', 'predictably', 'violent', 'conclusion.What', 'film', 'run', 'mill', 'drama', 'complexity', 'leading', 'characters', 'cast', 'ability', 'add', 'necessary', 'depth', 'performances', 'Hank', 'expectant', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Fonda', 'have', 'accepted', 'small', 'town', 'lives', 'consider', 'content', 'Jacob', 'Lou', 'unemployed', 'live', 'brink', 'poverty', 'seem', 'happy', 'enough', 'drinking', 'beer', 'together', 'telling', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'discovery', 'money', 'limbo', 'ordinary', 'life', 'prospect', 'escaping', 'what', 'suddenly', 'consider', 'miserable', 'existence', 'quickly', 'them.In', 'short', 'order', 'Sarah', 'priorities', 'shift', 'child-rearing', 'surreptitious', 'plotting', 'forcing', 'mild', 'mannered', 'Hank', 'acting', 'agent', 'wife', 'machinations', 'find', 'dark', 'heart', 'killer', 'Jacob', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'clever', 'foolishly', 'wealth', 'will', 'finally', 'end', 'loneliness', 'skillfully', 'draws', 'brother', 'Hank', 'plans', 'buy', 'back', 'family', 'farm', 'Lou', 'who', 'easy', 'way', 'shed', 'loser', 'image', 'fully', 'aware', 'only', 'non-Mitchell', 'family', 'member', 'most', 'vulnerable', 'betrayal', 'order', 'improve', 'odds', 'erode', 'bond', 'Jacob', 'Hank.Alliances', 'are', 'formed', 'promises', 'are', 'made', 'bitter', 'animosities', 'painful', 'secrets', 'are', 'laid', 'bare', 'bonds', 'trust', 'unravel', 'everyone', 'involved', 'committing', 'acts', 'never', 'thought', 'were', 'capable', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'skillful', 'examination', 'weak', 'underpinnings', 'support', 'civility', 'family', 'friendships', 'four', 'relatively', 'normal', 'people', 'Rami', 'are', 'easily', 'broken', 'ill', 'begotten', 'wealth', 'What', 'Lou', 'joyfully', 'American', 'Dream', 'Gym', 'Bag', 'out', 'be', 'nightmare', 'ability', 'control', 'can', 'happen', 'film', 'warn', 'can', 'happen', 'anyone.Rami', 'serious', 'approach', 'material', 'overlook', 'occasional', 'narrative', 'stretch', 'fact', 'police', 'more', 'less', 'mounting', 'body-count', 'no-one', 'discovers', 'secret', 'money', 'too', 'late', 'undo', 'damage', 'simple', 'phone', 'call', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'trick', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'where', 'tension', 'as', 'well', 'stakes', 'escalate', 'passing', 'moment', 'Definitely', 'viewing', 'two']",N/A

463457,ANO0XQ6XSIEVJ,6305417806,"Steven W. Hill ""Owner of shillpages.com""","[5, 8]","When I write reviews I usually don't focus much on the story; I'd rather let people know the pros and cons of the technical side of the movie and its video presentation. So what about A SIMPLE PLAN?It's a beautiful  movie, with some absolutely breathtaking scenery that is well-served by one  of the nicest DVD transfers I've seen. The picture is so wonderfully smooth  and crisp, no oversharpening or pixelation, and since the film's palette is  limited (let's face it - a lot of shades of white) you *need* the subtle  graduation of color that a good transfer provides. Paramount comes up  trumps in that respect. Sound is good, and the Danny Elfman score matches  the film's color palette: gray, cold, subdued and thoughtful.The movie  itself? I know a good many people who didn't like it, but perhaps that's  more a matter of frustration - how can one NOT be frustrated as this simple  plan goes so quickly and disastrously astray? Every time a decision is  made, you just want to tell the actors to change their mind...but the truth  is people make bad decisions all the time, and an ever-deepening spiral is  difficult to climb out of or stop. Can things get so bad that a good person  could consider giving up their life in either a metaphorical or literal  sense? Maybe. Bill Paxton turns in a strong performance; his character is  &quot;the smart one&quot; who keeps trying to do the right thing. Bridget  Fonda is his wife whose advice tends to be on the bad side, and Billy Bob  Thornton (who also appeared with Paxton in ONE FALSE MOVE and TOMBSTONE)  serves up - no exaggeration - an incredible performance as Paxton's  &quot;dumb&quot; brother.At least that's how it's supposed to look, and  how it looks on the surface. Jacob (Thornton) is slow, perhaps, but  obviously smart in a way Hank (Paxton) simply cannot grasp. Hank's made up  his mind that HE has to make the decisions because he is the strong one,  the smart one...but many times he doesn't even heed his own advice, which  only serves to make things worse. The film is strongest in its character  interactions; one person's words can change the way another acts which can  change the shape of a conversation and ultimately... well, let's just say  this movie is full of decisions, impulsive or not, and almost all of them  are bad ones, and it is through dialogue that we are privy to the workings  of the brains of these people, we can follow their logic and understand  their decisions even when we know they're wrong.Okay, so why 4 stars?  It's not a perfect film, no, but it deserves a very high rating. What gets  it a solid 4 out of 5 is the DVD presentation - nothing special, no extras  apart from a trailer. I would especially have welcomed a commentary from  the the director Sam Raimi and writer Scott B Smith who adapted his own  novel. Unfortunately that's something we'll have to wish for in the future.  So for now, A SIMPLE PLAN is a great film but a simple DVD.",4,"A Simple Plan, alas, a simple DVD",948153600,"01 18, 2000",2000,2955,"['When', 'write', 'reviews', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'focus', 'much', 'story', ""'d"", 'rather', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'pros', 'cons', 'technical', 'side', 'movie', 'video', 'presentation', 'what', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'well-served', 'one', 'nicest', 'DVD', 'transfers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'picture', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'smooth', 'crisp', 'oversharpening', 'pixelation', 'film', 'palette', 'limited', 'let', 'face', 'lot', 'shades', 'white', '*need*', 'subtle', 'graduation', 'color', 'good', 'transfer', 'Paramount', 'up', 'trumps', 'respect', 'Sound', 'good', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'film', 'color', 'palette', 'gray', 'cold', 'subdued', 'thoughtful.The', 'movie', 'know', 'good', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'more', 'matter', 'frustration', 'how', 'can', 'one', 'NOT', 'be', 'frustrated', 'simple', 'plan', 'so', 'quickly', 'disastrously', 'astray', 'Every', 'time', 'decision', 'made', 'just', 'want', 'tell', 'actors', 'change', 'mind', 'truth', 'people', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'time', 'ever-deepening', 'spiral', 'difficult', 'climb', 'stop', 'Can', 'things', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'person', 'could', 'consider', 'giving', 'up', 'life', 'metaphorical', 'literal', 'sense', 'Maybe', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'strong', 'performance', 'character', 'quot', 'smart', 'one', 'quot', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'wife', 'advice', 'be', 'bad', 'side', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'Paxton', 'ONE', 'FALSE', 'MOVE', 'TOMBSTONE', 'up', 'exaggeration', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Paxton', 'quot', 'quot', 'least', 'how', 'supposed', 'look', 'how', 'surface', 'Jacob', 'Thornton', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'obviously', 'smart', 'way', 'Hank', 'Paxton', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'grasp', 'Hank', 'made', 'up', 'mind', 'HE', 'make', 'decisions', 'strong', 'one', 'smart', 'one', 'many', 'times', ""n't"", 'even', 'heed', 'own', 'advice', 'only', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'film', 'strongest', 'character', 'interactions', 'one', 'person', 'words', 'can', 'change', 'way', 'acts', 'can', 'change', 'shape', 'conversation', 'ultimately', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'full', 'decisions', 'impulsive', 'not', 'almost', 'are', 'bad', 'ones', 'dialogue', 'are', 'privy', 'workings', 'brains', 'people', 'can', 'follow', 'logic', 'understand', 'decisions', 'even', 'when', 'know', ""'re"", 'wrong.Okay', 'so', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'very', 'high', 'rating', 'What', 'solid', '4', '5', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'nothing', 'special', 'extras', 'apart', 'trailer', 'would', 'especially', 'have', 'welcomed', 'commentary', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'writer', 'Scott', 'B', 'Smith', 'who', 'adapted', 'own', 'novel', 'Unfortunately', 'something', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wish', 'future', 'now', 'SIMPLE', 'PLAN', 'great', 'film', 'simple', 'DVD']",N/A
463458,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,6305417806,The Jaundiced Eye,"[10, 11]","This is a brilliantly acted and directed look at the effects of greed on seemingly normal people. Bill Paxon and Bridget Fonda portray a happily married couple with a child on the way...Billy Bob portrays Paxon's brother, as (what seems to be) a dim-witted, worthless bum....and Brent Briscoe portrays Billy Bob's best friend, another unemployed bum, who is actually flattered to be called ""The Town Drunk"".The three men discover a huge sum of money ($4.4 million) and talk themselves out of turning it in to the authorities, preferring instead to follow a ""simple plan"": hide it for a year, until ""the heat is off"" and then split it up and leave town. After all it is probably ""dirty money"" from some drug deal, and no one will be the worse for it....right?  Unfortunately, the magnitude of this windfall is so great that it joins forces with the inherent weaknesses of human nature to completely undermine this ""simple plan"" and wreak havoc upon our ""seemingly normal"" characters, their neighbors, and associates.The film is often compared to the Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"", partially due to the stark, expansive, snowy setting, but I feel that it also compares quite favorably to their first, classic 1984 film ""Blood Simple"", in which another ""simple plan"" leads to an ungodly tangle of murder and mayhem. Watch both, and you decide.There are several violent plot twists, but to me the most impressive twists were of the psychological kind, and thus perhaps too subtle for those interested only in ""blood and guts"". Billy Bob turns in a magnificent performance as he gradually reveals himself to be not the dim-witted bum we thought, but a kind, sensitive, intelligent, and ultimately compelling individual. The Paxon role, a college-educated accountant, dripping with self-professed superiority and always ""putting on airs"" around his bumpkin cohorts, degenerates into much the opposite of our initial favorable impression, with the full encouragement and counsel of his ""Lady Macbeth"" wife, played by Bridget Fonda.The most important feature of this movie, however, is that every move and decision....every action and reaction, are all very well justified by the characters, dialog, and events....all are quite plausible. You might not agree with all they do, but you definitely understand why they do it. Too often in movies like this, the characters do crazy, improbable things that we would never do, and thus lose our empathy and support...but in this movie, the plot and dialog are so beautifully crafted that we remain interested and concerned until the very end. I assure you that you will be deeply affected by the climatic scene.All actors rendered superb performances; in several cases, probably the best of their careers, and the direction (by horror-maven Sam Raimi), stark settings, haunting background music (Danny Elfman), cinematography, etc. are all exceptional. If you enjoy a mature, complex, psychologically-challenging plot that is beautifully presented, you will enjoy this movie.

Although it is played straight without intentional humor, the irony is so delicious at times that you might find yourself laughing.  Jacob Mitchell (Billy Bob Thornton) is the one who begins to feel evil, and rightly so as the bodies begin to pile up. His presumably smarter brother Hank (Bill Paxton) feels mostly fear as he struggles to cover up one mishap after another. Their problems begin when they and Jacob's buddy Lou Chambers (Brent Briscoe) stumble onto a downed airplane in the woods covered with snow in which they find one dead person being feasted on by crows and a duffle bag full of hundred dollar bills. Lou, who might represent the common man, says, let's keep it. Hank, who could be rational man, says, whoa, this money belongs to somebody and besides we could get into trouble. We better turn it in. And Jacob, who is the natural man, sides with his buddy Lou. After all they're country poor and this is probably drug money that nobody is going to miss. And anyway, what can go wrong?Well, as Ben Franklin observed a long time ago, `Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.' As they wait for spring to come and the plane to be discovered before they risk spending the money, the `simple plan' begins to unravel with horrific consequences.  Thornton and Briscoe play country boys to perfection, and Paxton does a great job as a small town golden boy seriously compromised. Bridget Fonda plays Hank's pregnant wife, who turns out to be the brains (as it were) of the group. There are some very nice plot twists as the all too human emotions of the characters begin to crash into one another. Inevitably we have a morality tale in which the wages of sin are fully realized.  Sam Raimi's (""The Evil Dead"", ""Spiderman) direction captures well the atmosphere of North Country America without any obvious straining for effect. He gets great mileage out of a few crows (actually some of them are ravens, I think) and a whole lot of snow. Scott B. Smith's script (from his novel) is clever and morally astute. The characterizations are excellent and the story psychologically satisfying.

Well written and acted, the film proceeds in a mostly credible fashion, as the discovery of a cache of cash, triggers an unexpected chain of events.Two brothers and a friend hunting in the snowy Minnesota woods, discover a plane that has crash landed in the snow.  Inside is a dead pilot, and bag with a huge sum of cash.  Rather than alerting the authorities, the men decide to take the cash and keep their discovery a secret.  Unfortunately, almost immediately things start to go wrong, as a murder is committed in order to keep their secret.  Additional deaths follow, as the conspirators begin to doubt each other.  Still managing to avoid disaster, those who remain face their biggest threat, when a visitor from out of town arrives looking for a downed plane.Directed by Sam Raimi (Drag Me to Hell, Spider-Man film series), A Simple Plan features a string of tragedies and traumatic events, that grind down and crush the spirit of those who remain, until all hope is gone, and empty shells of humanity remain.  In this case, greed is not good.  The acting performances from top to bottom are very solid, lead by Bill Paxton (Aliens), Billy Bob Thornton (Sling BladeSlingblade), Bridget Fonda (Single White Female), Brent Briscoe, Chelcie Ross, and Gary Cole(Midnight Caller).

463461,A243HY69GIAHFI,6305417806,tropic_of_criticism,"[2, 12]","The problem with A SIMPLE PLAN is that its title is unfortunately accurate.  It's a little too simple, this plan.  The plot, not to mention the characterizations, are so frequently devoid of explanation that this morality play ends up drawing no conclusions we can apply to our own lives.Chief among the problems is the plot's genesis. How a plane could crash within reasonable proximity of Washington DC and not be discovered by authorities is frankly unbelievable.  Did all the radar systems on the ground suddenly go dead?  Did the NATSB suddenly forget how to triangulate location based upon the last known data received from the plane? Did they look for a day or so and then give up, just because there was some snow on the ground?  Some might call this nitpicking.  But it's absolutely crucial to the plot.  The story depends upon a money-loaded plane not being discovered by authorities, but we're never given adequate understanding of how that came to be.  It's as if the writers simply posited the existence of such an event and we're supposed to accept it without question.It also misses the boat on characterization.  Fonda's character is wholly unsympathetic.  She makes such a radical emotional change we have little reason to care for her.  Indeed, this is kind of the problem of all the characters.  There is no motivation for their criminal acts, other than that circumstances made it possible for them to commit them.  The film would've been more compelling  if there had been some nobler motivation for their acts.  Self-preservation may be the kind of goal that leads to an examination of the darker side of the human psyche, but it is, again, too &quot;simple&quot; a tale.  To be sure, this is the tale the filmmakers obviously wanted to tell.  But it would've been far more interesting had the film been a cautionary tale about the dangers of noble ends being justified by evil means.What the film lacks in plot and theme, it makes up for in acting.  Paxton is at perhaps his most powerful in this film.  Long relegated to supporting roles, or starring in fairly emotionally uncomplicated ones, we see here a depth that has been too long hidden.  His is the character under the most pressure and guilt, and he manages to almost carry the film away from its other problems.  Billy Bob Thornton, likewise, almost lifts the script from its own banality.[DVD notes:  Nothing much of interest here.

463464,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,6305417806,viewer,"[3, 5]","Recently, I found a copy of this movie in an old box of home video releases and watched it for the first time. All I knew about the film was my recollection of a thumbnail sketch of the story and that it had received good reviews when it first came out, almost ten years ago. Watching the TV reviews again on a website archive (Gene Siskel reviewed it two months before his death, with Roger Ebert), I was reminded of the praise for the film's acting, pacing, and ""foreboding"" mood.  Reading the reviews on this site, I enjoyed the insights that some of them, both positive and negative, had to offer.  Unfortunately, too many of the reviews, often very skimpy, went way over the top one way or the other without making any serious attempt to explain why (the movie is neither a ""masterpiece"" nor a ""disgrace"") and got bogged down in lazy, sloppy, inapt comparisons (this is not ""Fargo"" or ""Macbeth""), trivial hang-ups (whether a character behaved exactly as the reviewer would have liked or a body flew at exactly the right angle after being shot by a rifle), and tedious platitudes (""greed is bad,"" ""money is the root of all evil"").I saw nothing to complain about in the writing or lead performances, maybe because they were built on a strong foundation of the book (I have not read it but it has received a lot of praise).  Bill Paxton does a solid job. He looks and acts persuasively his ""all-American boy-next-door"" role. Bridget Fonda, as his soft-on-the-surface but hard-as-nails wife, plays a terrific scene of brutal honesty about her life and conveys a merciless, misguided, blinkered sense of intelligence. The character of Paxton's brother, played by Billy Bob Thornton, shows some depth, surprises, and touches that make it much more than a stereotypical portrayal of a ""retard.""There is smart, honest dialogue. Some examples are Fonda telling Paxton that he would not be suspected of wrongdoing ""because he is so normal,"" various characters calling each other on their mistakes and illusions, and Thornton confiding under stress to Paxton uncomfortable facts about his growing up and their father's demise. Contrary to the negative reviews, the movie manages to make the characters' downward spiral into ever-more disastrous events seem convincing, through its well-done set-up and depiction of them. The characters make so many mistakes because of their limitations and because the situation they face is so new and unusual to them.  Of course the movie exaggerates, but it is handled well and makes a point. Its mundane ending is an interesting commentary.On the other hand, the negative reviews are right that the film's animal imagery, especially an early, noisy, ugly scene in the crashed airplane, comes across as heavy-handed and overdone. The tone is set well enough by the deeply unhappy, going-through-the-motions characters, grim events, and daily-grind, snowy-wilderness surroundings, without having to go to excess with the ear-piercing, carrion-foraging black birds. I suppose the intended message may be that the human beings in the story, although horrified by the flesh-eating birds, become little better than them in the end. Still, the symbolism in the movie feels clumsy and distracting, rather than seamlessly enhancing the story (maybe it was handled better in the book). At times, Paxton and Thornton do not seem very believable as brothers, though to some extent their incompatibility is the point. Some supporting characters and performances, particularly the dim-witted sheriff, are weak. Gary Cole is completely wasted in the film.  And the pacing gets a little forced toward the end of the movie.It makes me uncomfortable to read simpering, simplistic, one-sided reviews, long on mindless hype and boosterism, that give a seriously flawed movie an easy pass, make no attempt to come to grips with its problems or, worse, try to dump on anyone who points them out, as with the lazy, unintelligent flicking of the ""not helpful"" button on others. Such reviews offer little or nothing of value and only contribute to the impression that moviegoers are suckers. But it also bothers me to read hatchet-job reviews that become so self-indulgent in coming up with supposedly clever put-downs and in heaping on the vitriol that they show no appreciation for what the film does, or attempts to do, well in individual scenes and in its larger design, and sometimes read as if they were based on preconceived, surface-level, gut-driven reactions formed without even watching the movie very well or at all (like those ""reviews"" that are based on watching a movie for ten minutes or on a few glimpses in between naps and that therefore are completely worthless and a waste of everyone's time).  Such reviews can give as false an impression about what is on the screen as overly positive ones.
