And, for those who wish to learn the nuts and bolts & nitty gritty of that area where standup clubs dominated, this, too, will be of interest.The premise of the DVD is the rise of young comedians primarily of the Boston area during the late 70's early 80's. They have stories to tell, the big breaks, stardom, influx of comedians claiming to be from Boston, the many clubs, intense competition, etc., etc.,Some names you will recognize, Denis Leary, Colin Quinn, Lenny Clark, Kevin Meany...but others you won't.  There are clips of the acts, but nothing riotious as the box cover claims.So don't expect a standup comedy act of the comedians, as this is documentary, and it is informative at that.

982560,A3E1KL2N4ZOQ8W,B000F48D7I,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","This was a good documentary on the history of two local comedy clubs in Boston.  Since I am not from Boston, never been to Boston, and never will ever go to Boston, it was good for a one time viewing only.I agree with others that the cover of the DVD is misleading.  I think that they purposely designed it to look like these people are actually performing routines, as an attempt to sell more copies, nationwide.  Most people are pretty self centered and could care less about local comedy in an area other than their own.I give it two and a half stars.  I thought that it would actually have some funny scenes in it and was disappointed when there was not any.",2,An interesting look into Boston's comedy clubs,1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,662,"['was', 'good', 'documentary', 'history', 'two', 'local', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'Boston', 'am', 'not', 'Boston', 'never', 'been', 'Boston', 'never', 'will', 'ever', 'go', 'Boston', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'time', 'viewing', 'only.I', 'agree', 'others', 'cover', 'DVD', 'misleading', 'think', 'purposely', 'designed', 'look', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'performing', 'routines', 'attempt', 'sell', 'more', 'copies', 'nationwide', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'pretty', 'self', 'centered', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'local', 'comedy', 'area', 'other', 'own.I', 'give', 'two', 'half', 'stars', 'thought', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'funny', 'scenes', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', 'not']",When Standup Stood Out

All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out together and getting their start.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere.",2,"Comedy Scene, and Not Heard",1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,798,"['DVD', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'get', 'hoping', 'see', 'substantial', 'portion', 'acts', 'various', 'comics', 'listed', 'cover', 'get', 'here', 'are', 'snippets', 'performance', 'best', 'rest', 'just', 'loose-leaf', 'reminiscence', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Boston', 'early', '80', 'when', 'lot', 'comics', 'were', 'hanging', 'out', 'together', 'getting', 'start.It', 'frat', 'house', 'reunion', 'lot', 'lame', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'guffaws', 'recalling', 'jokes', 'practical', 'otherwise', 'perpetrated', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'appreciate', 'basically', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'camaraderie', 'were', ""n't"", 'actually', 'part', 'scene', 'joshing', 'jostling', 'will', 'fall', 'flat.If', 'want', 'actually', 'hear', 'comics', 'routines', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'elsewhere']",When Standup Stood Out

982564,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000F48D7I,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[13, 13]","What some of the angry reviewers of this film don't seem to understand is that although there are quite a few clips of stand up bits, this is a documentary ABOUT stand up, not a collection of acts. And it's a brilliantly made documentary as well. When I started watching, I didn't know that it was going to be so specifically about the Boston stand up scene. I didn't even know that so many great comedians came out of Boston.What this documentary is really about is a brief period in the late 70s - early 80s when stand up was suddenly all the rage in Boston. Suddenly comedy clubs were popping up all over town, and stand up was something that you could really make a good living at. It was fresh, original, and every act was different. Old clips from inside the clubs really showcase some funny stuff here too.What makes this documentary so enjoyable is the obvious respect and affection that filmmaker (and Boston comedian) Fran Solomita has for every artist he interviews. He still doesn't allow his film to turn into a love fest of idolizing Boston comedians. All aspects of the movement are documented here. The initial rise, Steven Wright's first appearance on the Late Show that really set Boston ablaze, and then the downfall that occurred because of the surplus of comedians and tv channels displaying comedians... and the drugs. Can't forget the drugs.When Stand Up Stood Out is just a really well made film about a very specific group of people in a specific area, but it alludes to the fact that stand up was exploding everywhere at this time, Boston was just the heart of it.There are great interviews and clips from comedians you may have never heard of and many that you have. All have their own insights into the process and the business and it's all interesting. This film is definitely never boring.The DVD contains tons of extras. There's an interview with Dane Cook talking about how he was affected by all the great Boston comedians before him. There's a good deal of clips from Bobcat Goldthwaite, Larry Clarke, and some ""man on the street"" clips from Kevin Meaney. There's also a making of featurette that really offers a lot of behind the scene information. Overall, this is a great DVD and worth every cent.",5,A documentary that really stands out,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,2234,"['What', 'angry', 'reviewers', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'clips', 'stand', 'bits', 'documentary', 'ABOUT', 'stand', 'up', 'not', 'collection', 'acts', 'brilliantly', 'made', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'started', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'specifically', 'Boston', 'stand', 'up', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'comedians', 'came', 'Boston.What', 'documentary', 'really', 'about', 'brief', 'period', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'when', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'suddenly', 'rage', 'Boston', 'Suddenly', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'were', 'popping', 'up', 'town', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'really', 'make', 'good', 'living', 'was', 'fresh', 'original', 'act', 'was', 'different', 'Old', 'clips', 'clubs', 'really', 'showcase', 'funny', 'stuff', 'here', 'too.What', 'documentary', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'obvious', 'respect', 'affection', 'filmmaker', 'Boston', 'comedian', 'Fran', 'Solomita', 'artist', 'still', ""n't"", 'allow', 'film', 'turn', 'love', 'fest', 'idolizing', 'Boston', 'comedians', 'aspects', 'movement', 'are', 'documented', 'here', 'initial', 'rise', 'Steven', 'Wright', 'first', 'appearance', 'Late', 'Show', 'really', 'set', 'Boston', 'ablaze', 'then', 'downfall', 'occurred', 'surplus', 'comedians', 'tv', 'channels', 'displaying', 'comedians', 'drugs', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'drugs.When', 'Stand', 'Up', 'Stood', 'Out', 'just', 'really', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'very', 'specific', 'group', 'people', 'specific', 'area', 'fact', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'exploding', 'everywhere', 'time', 'Boston', 'was', 'just', 'heart', 'it.There', 'are', 'great', 'interviews', 'clips', 'comedians', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'many', 'have', 'have', 'own', 'insights', 'process', 'business', 'interesting', 'film', 'definitely', 'never', 'boring.The', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extras', 'interview', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'talking', 'how', 'was', 'affected', 'great', 'Boston', 'comedians', 'good', 'deal', 'clips', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwaite', 'Larry', 'Clarke', 'man', 'street', 'clips', 'Kevin', 'Meaney', 'also', 'making', 'featurette', 'really', 'lot', 'scene', 'information', 'Overall', 'great', 'DVD', 'worth', 'cent']",When Standup Stood Out
