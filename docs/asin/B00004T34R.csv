It was a movie that reflected its time and for that, I for one, am quite thankful.  &quot;Stop Protesting&quot; should be the mantra for this new century.  PC, unfortunately, will never die but this movie went a long way to delegitimizing it.  I had a laugh when I saw that this was rated #12 for Michigan universities--it would have to be based on my memories of visiting my friend's at Michigan.

Piven's character is signed up, as a prank, by a friend (Alex D&eacute;sert) to show around ""the pre-frosh""(Tom) the School.  Piven is in a frat that is dwindling in numbers and has a bad rep.  The school, according to many of the characters, is drowning from being politically correct.  Piven, Young and D&eacute;sert cause some trouble and need to get some money to bail them selves out.The movie is the story of how they do it, things that stop them and has many different good themes, that if I tell you may give away too much of the plot.The movie is well written, has a lot of heart and has you understanding who the characters are without much explanation.  The movie is from 1994 and it shows, but doesn't take much away from it.  In the end, what you have is a funny, entertaining movie worth watching.

This is the movie that should have catapulted him into stardom, and on the DVD track a sulky, offhand Jeremy Piven reveals some of the frustration he must have felt when as it happened, the movie died a terrible death during its very first weekend at the box office and nearly ended the careers of all concerned.Piven is always complaining about poor Hart Bochner and how he felt stifled by Bochner's conservative direction and his insistence on sticking to the script.  You'd think Jeremy was some kind of Robert Altman/John Cassavetes veteran the way he swears by improvising your lines even when you've got a really good script.  Of course he had a very good bit in Altman's THE PLAYER.  Directors are drawn to his ability to play a selfish, self-absorbed heel.  On the DVD commentary he comes across as supremely bored with everything, including his own performance.Everyone who hates being PC will find their egos massaged by this light-hearted, and really very conservative movie which is really only for college students and those who remember being on the odds with the PC culture while they were in college.

It succeeds in bringing all the students together (with some help from George Clinton), but the president of the university still shuts them down.

I was surprised how much I loved it and after half-a-dozen viewings it still holds up as one of the top &quot;kollege skool daze&quot; films of all-time. A sort of 1990s take on &quot;Animal House&quot; but adjusted to reflect the smothering, neutering, pandering effect that political correctness has had on society, and college society in particular, &quot;PCU&quot; is the story of a hapless perspective freshman (&quot;prefresh&quot;) who visits the fictional Port Charles University, once a happening party school that has been spayed by its obsessively PC dean. The prefresh finds himself in the middle of a war being waged between the Order of Balls &amp; Shaft (a button-down clan of elitist snobs led by super-smarmy David Spade) and a group of renegade misfits led by Droz (Jeremy Piven at his very best) over ownership of &quot;the Pit&quot; -- the decaying fraternity house occupied by Droz's band but which once housed Spade's Hitler Youth troop. The real battle on campus, however, is between those who just want to party and have a good time and various sterotypical groups (militant blacks, feminazis, potheads, vegans, gays, etc) who have made any behavior that doesn't involve protesting basically impossible. The president of the university, Garcia-Thomas (note the hyphen), so hates the &quot;offensive&quot; Pit-persons that she sides with Spade's group to drive them off campus even though Spade is the antithesis of all of her beliefs. What follows is general chaos, with a hilarious performance by John Favereau (fat and wearing dreadlocks) as Gutter, a moron who fails every task given to him yet somehow gets George Clinton and his P-Funk All Stars to jam at a &quot;Save the Pit&quot; fundraiser. &quot;PCU&quot; is hardly a perfect movie, but having had an extremely crazy college career I could definetly relate to what happens in the film, and I most definetly give a &quot;big up&quot; (as they say in Jamaica) to the brutally anti-PC message.

Set at the fictional Port Chester University in Connecticut, the film centers around a fun loving fraternity who faces eviction from their frat house unless they come up with $7,500. for damages.  Much like Animal House, a smarmy, white-bred priss teams with the dean to help aid in their ousting.  The campus is overrun with political correctness from Womanysts, Afrocentrics, gay groups, stoners and others.  The plotlines are predictable, but the cast lead by the extremely underrated Jeremy Piven, rise above the clich&eacute;s to create an extremely enjoyable film.  Mr. Piven stars as Droz, the leader of the group and he plans a blow out party at the house's main room, The Pit.  His cohorts include Alex Desert as Muls, his smooth talking best friend, a young Jon Favreau (with a bizarre dreadlock hairdo) as the stoner Gutter, Megan Ward as the freshman Katy and Chris Young as a pre-freshman up for weekend to see if he wants to attend the school and who ends up ticking off almost the entire campus.  They are pitted against the Dean Garcia-Thompson played with icy bluster by Jessica Walter and Rand McPherson played with unctuous smarm by David Spade.  Through a series of mishaps, it looks like the party is going to be a bust.  Then through a minor set of miracles, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic show up and play the party and they gather enough cash to pay the damages.  It is still not enough to save them.  In another Animal House parallel, the frat disrupts the school's Bicentennial celebration and ends up saving the house by getting the dean fired.  PCU has TV movie like running time of barely one hour and twenty minutes, but its brevity helps keep the frantic pace up and it doesn't get bogged down in extraneous plotlines.",3,Animal House For the 90's,1088726400,"07 2, 2004",2004,1799,"['PCU', '90', 'version', 'Animal', 'House', 'Set', 'fictional', 'Port', 'Chester', 'University', 'Connecticut', 'film', 'centers', 'fun', 'loving', 'fraternity', 'who', 'eviction', 'frat', 'house', 'come', 'up', '7,500', 'damages', 'Much', 'Animal', 'House', 'smarmy', 'white-bred', 'priss', 'teams', 'dean', 'help', 'aid', 'ousting', 'campus', 'overrun', 'political', 'correctness', 'Womanysts', 'Afrocentrics', 'gay', 'groups', 'stoners', 'others', 'plotlines', 'are', 'predictable', 'cast', 'lead', 'extremely', 'underrated', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'rise', 'clich', 'eacute', 'create', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Piven', 'Droz', 'leader', 'group', 'blow', 'out', 'party', 'house', 'main', 'room', 'Pit', 'cohorts', 'include', 'Alex', 'Desert', 'Muls', 'smooth', 'talking', 'best', 'friend', 'young', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'bizarre', 'dreadlock', 'hairdo', 'stoner', 'Gutter', 'Megan', 'Ward', 'freshman', 'Katy', 'Chris', 'Young', 'pre-freshman', 'up', 'weekend', 'see', 'attend', 'school', 'who', 'up', 'ticking', 'off', 'almost', 'entire', 'campus', 'are', 'pitted', 'Dean', 'Garcia-Thompson', 'played', 'icy', 'bluster', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'Rand', 'McPherson', 'played', 'unctuous', 'smarm', 'David', 'Spade', 'series', 'mishaps', 'party', 'going', 'be', 'bust', 'Then', 'minor', 'set', 'miracles', 'George', 'Clinton', 'Parliament-Funkadelic', 'show', 'up', 'play', 'party', 'gather', 'enough', 'cash', 'pay', 'damages', 'still', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'Animal', 'House', 'parallel', 'frat', 'school', 'Bicentennial', 'celebration', 'up', 'saving', 'house', 'getting', 'dean', 'fired', 'PCU', 'TV', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'barely', 'one', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'brevity', 'keep', 'frantic', 'pace', 'up', ""n't"", 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'extraneous', 'plotlines']",N/A

I wasn't very impressed with the Mud Honey video or the Behind-the-scenes featurette, but seeing the trailer (for the first time ever) was cool and the fact that I had TWO separate commentaries to choose from was very promising.  HOWEVER, being a Jeremy Piven fan, I started with his commentary, which is actually second on the list of bonus features and not necessarily a logical place to start the show.  I was sorely disappointed by Piven's whiney repetitive rant about how the actors were denied creative license &amp; not allowed to improvise.  He spent half the movie complaining about the director (not very professional).  The other 50% was pretty evenly split between him mentioning that he came down with Malaria and just letting the movie play because he couldn't think of anything else to say.  I felt like he hadn't watched the movie since it's release a decade ago and didn't bother to prepare for his stint as commentator.I then turned to Hart Bochner's commentary, figuring that he would have comparable complaints to those of Piven.  I was surprised to find that he seems to be under the exact opposite impression - namely that he actively gave the cast creative license.  He did have some complaints of his own though... namely that HE was not allowed to have creative license due to being contractually bound by the studio to deliver a PG-13 movie, whereas his vision of PCU would have been R (language, visual, drug use, etc).  He makes several references to scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor (most notably the Jerrytown scene, which is apparently completely different than the original version), which would have made an excellent addition to the Bonus Features section.  Other interesting info served up by Bochner include the other actors considered for certain roles.  I found Bochner's commentary to be the most entertaining and educational commentary I have ever watched.If you buy this DVD for one reason, buy it because PCU is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  If you buy it for two reasons, make sure you watch Bochner's commentary.  You'll gain a new appreciation of an old favorite.",4,Bonus features offer up a mixed bag of enjoyment,1063324800,"09 12, 2003",2003,2488,"[""'ll"", 'make', 'point', 'upfront', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'worth', 'penny', 'spent', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'commentary', 'alone.Now', 'reasons', 'opinion', 'Let', 'premise', 'review', 'saying', 'watched', 'PCU', 'cable', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'skipped', 'straight', 'Bonus', 'features', 'getting', 'DVD', 'home', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressed', 'Mud', 'Honey', 'video', 'Behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'was', 'cool', 'fact', 'had', 'TWO', 'separate', 'commentaries', 'choose', 'was', 'very', 'promising', 'HOWEVER', 'being', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'fan', 'started', 'commentary', 'actually', 'second', 'list', 'bonus', 'features', 'not', 'necessarily', 'logical', 'place', 'start', 'show', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Piven', 'whiney', 'repetitive', 'rant', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'denied', 'creative', 'license', 'amp', 'not', 'allowed', 'improvise', 'spent', 'movie', 'complaining', 'director', 'not', 'very', 'professional', 'other', '50', '%', 'was', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'split', 'mentioning', 'came', 'down', 'Malaria', 'just', 'letting', 'movie', 'play', 'could', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'else', 'say', 'felt', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movie', 'release', 'decade', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'prepare', 'stint', 'commentator.I', 'then', 'turned', 'Hart', 'Bochner', 'commentary', 'figuring', 'would', 'have', 'comparable', 'complaints', 'Piven', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'be', 'exact', 'opposite', 'impression', 'namely', 'actively', 'gave', 'cast', 'creative', 'license', 'did', 'have', 'complaints', 'own', 'though', 'namely', 'HE', 'was', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'creative', 'license', 'due', 'being', 'contractually', 'bound', 'studio', 'deliver', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'vision', 'PCU', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'R', 'language', 'visual', 'drug', 'use', 'etc', 'several', 'references', 'scenes', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'most', 'notably', 'Jerrytown', 'scene', 'apparently', 'completely', 'different', 'original', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'addition', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'section', 'Other', 'interesting', 'info', 'served', 'up', 'Bochner', 'include', 'other', 'actors', 'considered', 'certain', 'roles', 'found', 'Bochner', 'commentary', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'commentary', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.If', 'buy', 'DVD', 'one', 'reason', 'buy', 'PCU', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'buy', 'two', 'reasons', 'make', 'sure', 'watch', 'Bochner', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'gain', 'new', 'appreciation', 'old', 'favorite']",N/A
