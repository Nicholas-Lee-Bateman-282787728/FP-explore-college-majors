1424190,AKV9F8HZ7XX0B,B004QJOE44,AC,"[3, 3]","This film is strikingly documentary-like, and very well-acted. The child actress whose character is at the center of the film also does a lot of acting that involves no dialogue... and the expression on her face, and in her eyes, is often difficult (emotionally) for us to 'experience'.Others have commented regarding the gist of the film, and the events which unfold in it. I simply want to add some of my thoughts and 'reaction' to the film.There is so much that is realistic about this film, and it can feel somewhat 'long' to watch, given the 'pace' at which things occur -- but the 'pace', and what takes place, and in the way that it does, is also part of what is 'effective' about the film -- you almost feel as though you're 'witnessing' periods of time in this little girl's life 'along with her' (in a way), and she isn't so much 'experiencing' her life as she is 'existing' within it -- as though 'doing time' (and during her one and only childhood, at that) -- which is part of the heartbreak in watching this. She is 'in' a system which is supposed to 'help' her, but she is all but 'cast adrift' within it, and must seemingly 'go it alone', in ways...and is practically 'invisible'. Despite the physical presence of various (and older) human beings, it is as though she is forced to exist within a kind of nurtureless 'ghost town'... and you desperately want to pluck her from the film and find her a loving home.One of the more subtlely accretive heart-tugging aspects of this film is the fact that the child seen onscreen for the majority of the film so often has a 'neutral' and emotionally 'numb' face, and is quiet/silent -- when what we expect (and want) to see a child's life involve (though understandably, would not see in this type of circumstance) is happiness, smiling, and laughter. The sight -- and 'knowledge' -- of an emotionally numb child, and knowing that this type of survival mechanism (which is essentially the mind's way of preserving itself, and allowing the human being in question to function) emerges as a result of great emotional pain and trauma -- is disturbing, to say the least, and is uncomfortable to 'watch', partly due to the fact that it 'goes against nature' -- children should not 'know' the type of emotional pain that results in such... but so many do.The ultimate 'knife twist' in all of this is that we see/'know' how gentle, kind, and sweet this child is -- and she is essentially guardianless, and, as the title says, unloved -- and additionally, as the title indicates, by its use of the word ""The"" in ""The Unloved"", this little girl is but one of many such children (and whether in England or elsewhere) whose lives do not include this basic human need, let alone during the timeframe when it is needed most -- in childhood. A powerful aspect of this film is in showing that such children also often experience the apathy of the society in which they live (and that of dysfunctional institutions purported to help (just because a 'system' exists doesn't mean it's effective -- or truly *trying*)), and can and often do experience such apathy -- and neglect -- for prolonged periods of time (and time is disproportionately perceived/'felt'/'experienced' when we're children -- a year can feel like an eternity).These children are all but 'pushed aside', and practically forgotten -- which is an abomination.This film is the first film directed by Samantha Morton, who in addition to being a remarkable actress, was made a ward of the court at the age of 8, and spent years in group homes and foster care (in England) -- this film is based on her experiences, and that of others who she knew... and while many refer to this as her ""directorial debut"", she considers this a one-off experience -- she doesn't consider herself to be a director, but felt compelled to get this story ""out of her system""... and she began storyboarding it when she was 16. Samantha stated in an interview that ""The Unloved"" is a censored version of what took place; she intentionally diluted its content, and omitted aspects of violence, sexual abuse, and torture. She conveyed, ""I'm not going to make a children's film and turn it into a horror film. I wanted to make a film that someone from the age of 13 could watch and get, and it would change them."" Samantha intentionally left various aspects unanswered/unexplained, due to its reflecting the reality that for many children, they never get an explanation for why various things did or did not take place (such as why one of their parents wasn't around, or beat them, or abandoned them).This is a bleak film that is depressing to watch, but it is also important, and worth seeing.",4,"Somber, depressing, and heartbreaking... and filled with silent anguish",1386892800,"12 13, 2013",2013,4672,"['film', 'strikingly', 'documentary-like', 'very', 'well-acted', 'child', 'actress', 'character', 'center', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'expression', 'face', 'eyes', 'often', 'difficult', 'emotionally', ""'experience'.Others"", 'have', 'commented', 'regarding', 'gist', 'film', 'events', 'unfold', 'simply', 'want', 'add', 'thoughts', ""'reaction"", 'film.There', 'so', 'much', 'realistic', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'somewhat', ""'long"", 'watch', 'given', ""'pace"", 'things', 'occur', ""'pace"", 'what', 'place', 'way', 'also', 'part', 'what', ""'effective"", 'film', 'almost', 'feel', ""'re"", ""'witnessing"", 'periods', 'time', 'little', 'girl', 'life', ""'along"", 'way', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', ""'experiencing"", 'life', ""'existing"", ""'doing"", 'time', 'one', 'only', 'childhood', 'part', 'heartbreak', 'watching', ""'in"", 'system', 'supposed', ""'help"", 'adrift', 'must', 'seemingly', ""'go"", 'alone', 'ways', 'practically', ""'invisible"", 'physical', 'presence', 'various', 'older', 'human', 'beings', 'forced', 'exist', 'kind', 'nurtureless', 'town', 'desperately', 'want', 'pluck', 'film', 'find', 'loving', 'home.One', 'more', 'subtlely', 'accretive', 'heart-tugging', 'aspects', 'film', 'fact', 'child', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'majority', 'film', 'so', 'often', ""'neutral"", 'emotionally', ""'numb"", 'face', 'quiet/silent', 'when', 'what', 'expect', 'want', 'see', 'child', 'life', 'involve', 'understandably', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'type', 'circumstance', 'happiness', 'smiling', 'laughter', 'sight', ""'knowledge"", 'emotionally', 'numb', 'child', 'knowing', 'type', 'survival', 'mechanism', 'essentially', 'mind', 'way', 'preserving', 'allowing', 'human', 'being', 'question', 'function', 'result', 'great', 'emotional', 'pain', 'trauma', 'disturbing', 'say', 'least', 'uncomfortable', ""'watch"", 'partly', 'due', 'fact', 'nature', 'children', 'should', 'not', ""'know"", 'type', 'emotional', 'pain', 'results', 'such', 'so', 'many', 'do.The', 'ultimate', 'twist', ""see/'know"", 'how', 'gentle', 'kind', 'sweet', 'child', 'essentially', 'guardianless', 'title', 'unloved', 'additionally', 'title', 'use', 'word', 'Unloved', 'little', 'girl', 'one', 'many', 'such', 'children', 'England', 'elsewhere', 'lives', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'basic', 'human', 'need', 'let', 'alone', 'timeframe', 'when', 'needed', 'most', 'childhood', 'powerful', 'aspect', 'film', 'showing', 'such', 'children', 'also', 'often', 'apathy', 'society', 'live', 'dysfunctional', 'institutions', 'purported', 'help', 'just', ""'system"", 'exists', ""n't"", 'mean', 'effective', 'truly', '*trying*', 'can', 'often', 'do', 'experience', 'such', 'apathy', 'neglect', 'prolonged', 'periods', 'time', 'time', 'disproportionately', ""perceived/'felt'/'experienced"", 'when', ""'re"", 'children', 'year', 'can', 'feel', 'eternity', '.These', 'children', 'are', ""'pushed"", 'aside', 'practically', 'forgotten', 'abomination.This', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'directed', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'who', 'addition', 'being', 'remarkable', 'actress', 'was', 'made', 'ward', 'court', 'age', '8', 'spent', 'years', 'group', 'homes', 'foster', 'care', 'England', 'film', 'based', 'experiences', 'others', 'who', 'knew', 'many', 'refer', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one-off', 'experience', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'director', 'felt', 'compelled', 'get', 'story', 'system', 'began', 'storyboarding', 'when', 'was', '16', 'Samantha', 'stated', 'interview', 'Unloved', 'censored', 'version', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'intentionally', 'diluted', 'content', 'omitted', 'aspects', 'violence', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'torture', 'conveyed', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'make', 'children', 'film', 'turn', 'horror', 'film', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'someone', 'age', '13', 'could', 'watch', 'get', 'would', 'change', 'Samantha', 'intentionally', 'left', 'various', 'aspects', 'unanswered/unexplained', 'due', 'reflecting', 'reality', 'many', 'children', 'never', 'get', 'explanation', 'why', 'various', 'things', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'such', 'why', 'one', 'parents', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'beat', 'abandoned', '.This', 'bleak', 'film', 'depressing', 'watch', 'also', 'important', 'worth', 'seeing']","Unloved, The"

The lost children caught in the system between foster and children home ( or dumping ground for tomorrow's delinquents) The film uses a real such kid in some scenes in the home.The subject matter comes across as important for the director ( Samantha Morton) to bear witness to.Overcrowding. seems to be the biggest fault about In Care. Then the criticism that in the UK, health and social services are over-run by liberals wherein plight is their livelihood and the budget seems stretched. There is a paralell story to Lucy's with her room-mate that is a compelling under-drama of its own worth rewatching to see it played out in hindsight.There are enough shots where Lucy stares at objects and her surroundings . When inside her head is scarily disassociative and painful,  then fixating on the calm "" is-ness"" of physicality is when Lucy achieves a relief of sorts. These objects take on an abstract quality imbued with a kind of living sensation of their own. Speaking from experience I was sitting with a neglected boy once ( his mother, herself a children'home casualty) when a kind of psyche transference occured between us. We were watching tv but he really wanted us to interact but dare not ask. Meanwhile my attention was drawn to the  building bricks infront of us which had become imbued and tangibly sentient ( with/by him) The primary colours glowed unearthily. The surface of the bricks was covered in a rods surface that seemed like a layer of alien finger-tips. On a cognitive level Lucy also projects onto religious statues and prayer, willing them to come alive. It was chilling when the film cut to an exert from a tv show with a very scary looking puppet.Camaraderie saves this film from being a pit of gloom At least the people around Lucy are trying so this not an entirely nilhistic film.

I think Molly was picked for the part because she is so lovable and it is hard for us to understand how her parents could not put her life ahead of their own desires.
