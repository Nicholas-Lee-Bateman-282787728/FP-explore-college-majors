971634,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B000ECX0R4,J. Martin,"[2, 2]","There are two versions of this movie on DVD, both released by Water Bearer Films, but they are very different. Get the SECOND version! Amazon in its bizarre drive toward consolidation lumps together reviews for the two DVDs. To be absolutely sure:*BUY* THIS DVD:Saturday Night at the Baths-Director's Cut! It has a guy's torso in a white towel on the cover, with the title like a blue bumper sticker over his crotch.*DO NOT BUY* THIS DVD:Saturday Night at the Baths! It has a murky, black and pink cover with facing profiles and the title between them in the center.The first was a chopped-up version released without the director's participation in 2006. Later an uncut version of the movie was found in the director's files and released as ""director's cut"" on a new DVD in 2008. The second DVD not only is a cleaner copy with better video and audio, but it includes several minutes of footage missing from the first DVD.Most important **BY FAR** is a five-minute love scene between Scotti and Michael that not only balances the earlier scene between Michael and Tracey but blows it clean out of the water. The scene with Tracey is a sex scene; the scene with Scotti is a love scene, infinitely more sensual, passionate, romantic and erotic than the mechanical humping with Tracey. The gay love scene alone kills forever the criticism that this movie is worth watching only for its documenting of a life and a world long gone. It qualifies this as a very good movie in its own right and one of the sexiest gay moves of that or any era.The new DVD also includes an extensive, fantastic making-of interview with the director David Buckley and a wide-ranging interview with Steve Ostrow, owner of the Baths - both filmed recently - which were not on the first DVD; and a few extra seconds of the magical Jane Olivor performance of ""Pretty Girl"" and of the fabulous Judy impersonator lost from the first DVD.Don't bother renting and certainly don't buy the butchered 2006 DVD with two pink profiles on a black cover; BUY the 2008 director's cut DVD with the guy in the towel.

Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[10, 10]","Made in 1975 and filmed on a modest budget, ""Saturday Night at the Baths"" was a little film about the hey days of bathhouses that didn't get much notice. That's too bad, because producer/director David Buckley created a film that now serves as a historical record of what life was like in the early LGBT community, via New York's famous Continental Baths.The inclusion of legendary owner Steve Ostroff---as well as using real-life patrons & performers of the baths as extras---in the movie lends it authenticity...especially when we discover he's alive & well and living in Australia in a Special Features documentary-interview.The three lead characters in the film are given life by three appealing actors: Robert Aberdeen, Ellen Sheppard and newcomer Don Scotti, who forge a unique & touching friendship/relationship through 70's sexual freedom & attitudes.It's not a perfect film by any means---the editing is choppy and the acting a bit campy at times. But hey, there are not many movies out there chronicling a culture long gone, so this film is really something to treasure. If anything, places like the Continental Baths live on today in spirit in Pride Festivals all over the globe.Little did Buckley know that he would create a film whose content was relevant then, and is still relevant now.",4,An important part of 70's culture is rediscovered,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,1301,"['Made', '1975', 'filmed', 'modest', 'budget', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Baths', 'was', 'little', 'film', 'hey', 'days', 'bathhouses', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'notice', 'too', 'bad', 'producer/director', 'David', 'Buckley', 'created', 'film', 'now', 'historical', 'record', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'early', 'LGBT', 'community', 'New', 'York', 'famous', 'Continental', 'Baths.The', 'inclusion', 'legendary', 'owner', 'Steve', 'Ostroff', '-as', 'well', 'using', 'real-life', 'patrons', 'performers', 'baths', 'extras', '-in', 'movie', 'authenticity', 'especially', 'when', 'discover', 'alive', 'well', 'living', 'Australia', 'Special', 'Features', 'documentary-interview.The', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'life', 'three', 'appealing', 'actors', 'Robert', 'Aberdeen', 'Ellen', 'Sheppard', 'newcomer', 'Don', 'Scotti', 'who', 'forge', 'unique', 'touching', 'friendship/relationship', '70', 'sexual', 'freedom', 'attitudes.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'means', '-the', 'editing', 'choppy', 'acting', 'bit', 'campy', 'times', 'hey', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'chronicling', 'culture', 'long', 'gone', 'film', 'really', 'something', 'treasure', 'anything', 'places', 'Continental', 'Baths', 'live', 'today', 'spirit', 'Pride', 'Festivals', 'globe.Little', 'did', 'Buckley', 'know', 'would', 'create', 'film', 'content', 'was', 'relevant', 'then', 'still', 'relevant', 'now']",Saturday Night at the Baths
