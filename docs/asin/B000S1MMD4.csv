1085045,A1AGBTL8M08K4V,B000S1MMD4,Al Hence,"[1, 1]","Back in 2004, Jeff Goldblum starred in the Pittsburgh Light Opera production of The Music Man, featuring his now-former girlfriend, Catherine Wreford, plus Illeana Douglas, and Ed Begley, Jr.  Although Mr. Goldblum is a talented actor, his skills do not extend to musical comedy. That became the basis for this unfunny mockumentry with all of the aforementioned playing versions of themselves.  It's hard to see why this was made other than as a vanity project for  Ms. Wreford.  As someone else pointed out, there are easier ways to get laid.  Mr. Goldblum and the entire cast are good but they have very little to do except mugg and pretend to fumble around.  Premise is that Mr. G has a young Canadian fianc&eacute; (Ms. Wreford), who, for some reason, can't get back into the US.  Somehow this requires him to participate in the regional production of Music Man. Huh?  If they are engaged, why don't they just get married?  Problem solved.  But then you wouldn't have a movie (a good outcome for all involved).  There are also a couple of pointless sub-plots about Ms. Douglas' relationship issues and Mr. Begely's  promotion of solar cells.",1,Vanity of Vanities,1401408000,"05 30, 2014",2014,1145,"['Back', '2004', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'starred', 'Pittsburgh', 'Light', 'Opera', 'production', 'Music', 'Man', 'featuring', 'now-former', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'Wreford', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr', 'Mr.', 'Goldblum', 'talented', 'actor', 'skills', 'do', 'not', 'extend', 'musical', 'comedy', 'became', 'basis', 'unfunny', 'mockumentry', 'aforementioned', 'playing', 'versions', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'made', 'other', 'vanity', 'project', 'Ms.', 'Wreford', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'easier', 'ways', 'get', 'laid', 'Mr.', 'Goldblum', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'mugg', 'pretend', 'fumble', 'around', 'Premise', 'Mr.', 'G', 'young', 'Canadian', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Ms.', 'Wreford', 'who', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'US', 'Somehow', 'participate', 'regional', 'production', 'Music', 'Man', 'Huh', 'are', 'engaged', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'married', 'Problem', 'solved', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'good', 'outcome', 'involved', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'pointless', 'sub-plots', 'Ms.', 'Douglas', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Mr.', 'Begely', 'promotion', 'solar', 'cells']",Pittsburgh

Okay, so it's no ""Waiting for Guffman"", but it's a heck of a lot better than Christopher Guest's last movie.  In fact, it's one of the more enjoyable comedies I've seen in a while.I'm amazed at how thoroughly Jeff Goldblum owns this film.  His goofy, winning personality shines throughout and is a pleasure to watch.  He (or at least the version of himself in the film) is the kind of guy I'd like to have as a best friend - his quirky behavior is totally endearing.  The other actors are great too, especially Illeana Douglas.I guess I can see why Pittsburgh isn't for everyone.  It's a subtle humor, relying more on personality quirks than jokes, and there aren't that many laugh-out-loud moments.  But I really enjoyed it and even decided to buy the DVD.

This is the movie that marks the dividing line for me. I don't know if the girl friend in the movie is his real life girl friend. It wouldn't surprise me. She is really cute and men have done dumber things than make a movie this bad in order to get laid.The movie is about Goldblum agreeing to star in a local musical even though he can't sing so his hot very young girl friend can also get a part. The premise could have been a funny mockumantary. That's what they were going for: something like Best in Show or Waiting for Gufman.But the thing those movies have going for them is even though they make fun of everyone involved they still show us the underlying humanity. We may laugh at the weird couple that wins best in show (slutty wife with nebish husband) but we also kind of like them and root for them. There was no one to like in this movie. The people behave in a completely unrealistic way and Goldblum really phones in his performance.  Everyone in the movie seems to be so in awe of Jeff Goldblum for some reason.  I was totally bored with this movie and only saw it through to the end so that my girl friend and I could make sarcastic comments as it was playing. For a while I was hoping there might be some plot twist, like the hot young girl friend meets another celebrity or something...
