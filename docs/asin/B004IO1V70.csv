1411180,A1P98DMX8YUSNW,B004IO1V70,Brad Smith,"[8, 9]","Though this two-hour documentary does cover Keef's full life, right up to the moment, almost, it lacks a great range of commentators to really round things out. Keith himself only appears rather briefly, in old clips, with nothing done exclusively for this dvd. None of the other band members were interviewed for this disc, and not even old film clips are included. Instead, we get a bunch of nobodies commenting, including the usual cast of Brit and American music journalists, obscure musicians and one or two people with actual connections to the band, though mostly from the very early days. The gist focuses on Keith's guitar playing. Most of the albums are commented on. You will get a decent picture from this movie, but it's not what it could have been.",3,Missing quite a lot,1324944000,"12 27, 2011",2011,762,"['two-hour', 'documentary', 'cover', 'Keef', 'full', 'life', 'right', 'up', 'moment', 'almost', 'great', 'range', 'commentators', 'really', 'round', 'things', 'out', 'Keith', 'only', 'rather', 'briefly', 'old', 'clips', 'nothing', 'done', 'exclusively', 'dvd', 'None', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'were', 'interviewed', 'disc', 'not', 'even', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'included', 'Instead', 'get', 'bunch', 'nobodies', 'commenting', 'including', 'usual', 'cast', 'Brit', 'American', 'music', 'journalists', 'obscure', 'musicians', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'actual', 'connections', 'band', 'though', 'mostly', 'very', 'early', 'days', 'gist', 'Keith', 'guitar', 'playing', 'Most', 'albums', 'are', 'commented', 'will', 'get', 'decent', 'picture', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Keith Richards: The Human Riff
1411181,A2FJCITRT7GQ0N,B004IO1V70,D.R.L.,"[2, 2]","~ This 118 minute documentary provides a valuable look into the music, the myth, and the man who is Keith Richards. Released at approximately the same time as Keith's autobiography, the DVD serves as a useful companion to that book. The video and Keith's autobiography both present an honest, no-holds-barred view into Keith's past and present. The advantage of the video is the ability to hear the music and see performance videos.~ The story is told by a combination of narration and interviews with journalists and authors who have traveled with and written about Keith and The Stones. There are also a few interviews with some musicians who have worked with Keith. Interestingly, none of the musicians interviewed could be classified as close to Keith or frequent collaborators with Keith, and there are no interviews with other members of The Stones. However, the input from the journalists and authors is valuable.~ As mentioned above, there are frequent snippets of performance videos to enhance the story and to demonstrate Keith's unique musical style. These performance clips and on-camera interviews with Keith as well as photographs provide an interesting study of the 'evolution' of Keith's facial features over the last 50 years.~ Noted guitar educator Wolf Marshall appears at various times throughout the video to discuss and demonstrate Keith's guitar techniques. The editors do a nice job of morphing from Wolf's demonstrations of Keith's technique to video clips of Keith and The Stones playing. Indeed, more than most &#34;biography&#34; documentaries, this video focuses on the music and how it has changed over the years due to various influences on Keith and The Stones. There is considerable discussion of Keith's approach to the guitar and his music. The take-home message of the DVD is the respect everyone has for Keith the musician, Keith the rhythm / lead guitarist, Keith the Human Riff.~ Recommended.",4,Keith Richards: The Human Riff,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,1931,"['~', '118', 'minute', 'documentary', 'valuable', 'look', 'music', 'myth', 'man', 'who', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'Released', 'approximately', 'same', 'time', 'Keith', 'autobiography', 'DVD', 'useful', 'companion', 'book', 'video', 'Keith', 'autobiography', 'present', 'honest', 'no-holds-barred', 'view', 'Keith', 'past', 'present', 'advantage', 'video', 'ability', 'hear', 'music', 'see', 'performance', 'story', 'told', 'combination', 'narration', 'interviews', 'journalists', 'authors', 'who', 'have', 'traveled', 'written', 'Keith', 'Stones', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'interviews', 'musicians', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'Keith', 'Interestingly', 'none', 'musicians', 'interviewed', 'could', 'be', 'classified', 'close', 'Keith', 'frequent', 'collaborators', 'Keith', 'are', 'interviews', 'other', 'members', 'Stones', 'However', 'input', 'journalists', 'authors', 'valuable.~', 'mentioned', 'are', 'frequent', 'snippets', 'performance', 'videos', 'enhance', 'story', 'demonstrate', 'Keith', 'unique', 'musical', 'style', 'performance', 'clips', 'on-camera', 'interviews', 'Keith', 'as', 'well', 'photographs', 'provide', 'interesting', 'study', ""'evolution"", 'Keith', 'facial', 'features', 'last', '50', 'years.~', 'Noted', 'guitar', 'educator', 'Wolf', 'Marshall', 'various', 'times', 'video', 'discuss', 'demonstrate', 'Keith', 'guitar', 'techniques', 'editors', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'morphing', 'Wolf', 'demonstrations', 'Keith', 'technique', 'video', 'clips', 'Keith', 'Stones', 'playing', 'Indeed', 'more', 'most', '34', 'biography', '34', 'documentaries', 'video', 'music', 'how', 'changed', 'years', 'due', 'various', 'influences', 'Keith', 'Stones', 'considerable', 'discussion', 'Keith', 'approach', 'guitar', 'music', 'take-home', 'message', 'DVD', 'respect', 'everyone', 'Keith', 'musician', 'Keith', 'rhythm', '/', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Keith', 'Human', 'Riff.~', 'Recommended']",Keith Richards: The Human Riff

A ton of rare clips and (to me) unseen interview footage/stills.Rockologists are compelling - I was stunned to hear some real criticism of Keith's/Stones recorded works; plus the mention of the name Chuck Berry, countless times. These documentaries of '60s superstars uually say that, well, in the beginning, the artist borrowed a few licks from 1950s pioneers. I will be ordering a few Stones albums/CDs I never owned before. (Already got a complete Chuck collection!).For oldtime fans (not ""expert"" fans) like me, it's great to have a great reference on solo projects into the '90s.Bernie Worrell, the Soul-Funk-Rock instrumental genius, does not analyze the tracks..just delivers his own Keith experience, with deep emotion.Project is seriously lacking distaff input. Keith once made a particularly great, honest statement: (paraphrasing) ""Why am I still in Rock and Roll?
