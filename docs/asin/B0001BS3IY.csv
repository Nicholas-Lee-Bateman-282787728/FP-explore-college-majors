799488,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B0001BS3IY,Chris,"[12, 12]","I just finished watching the second season of The King Of Queens.  This season is about the same as the first (comedy wise).  The writing is still great and very fresh.  This show is still the show about the ""common"" guy and how he tries to get by in life.  This season has a little more character development.  Arthur becomes crazier and more obsessed.  His classic line from this season has to be when he talks about getting beat up by a biker gang and a young man named ""Road Hog"" taking advantage of him.  Doug becomes more aggresively angry and gets jealous a lot easier.  Him seems to try to fit in with others better, i.e. becoming a big brother and trying to run a 10K.  Carrie doesn't change too much.  We learn that she is a chronic cheater at games, but other than that she is the same great character.As for the quality of the DVDs, this season is far better.  The first season was a little fuzzy because they tried to put too many shows on one disc. There is one less episode on each disc this season and the difference is noticable.  The special features are not as good as I would like, but the humor of the show is enough to hold this set up on its own.

I hope that the 2nd season DVD will contain deleted scenes, a gag-reel, more interviews with the cast and crew, and commentaries by the cast and crew.  So I did not get the special features that I wanted on the DVD oh well the DVD is still worth it.  I bought the 2nd season of King Of Queens today and it does not contain many special features.

Kevin James and Leah Remini have great chemistry as a married couple, and Jerry Stiller is so funny as Arthur.  The story lines on the show are so funny and simple. My favorite episode is the one about how Doug and Carrie meet for the first time.  The episode where Doug tries so hard to rekindle the romance in his marriage by giving Carrie flowers is very funny too.  I also loved the episode where Doug takes Arthur to a baseball game after he accidently hurts his feelings.  Jerry Stiller is just  hillarious in the episode where Arthur gets a job managing a pretzel shop.  I also enjoyed the episode where Doug buys a RV trailer and argues with Carrie about where to go on vacation. Victor Williams, who plays Deacon Palmer on the show is Doug's best friend and a perfect supporting cast member.  One of the funniest episodes of season 2 is where Doug and Deacon go to Atlantic City to go gambling.This DVD does not include interviews with the cast members like on the 1st season DVD,  but it does have a feature called A Day in the Life of Kevin James.  It shows Kevin James going on various talk shows like Conan and Regis and Kelly and having fun playing baseball.  This extra feature shows that Kevin James is such a nice person in real life.

And let's not forget lovable loon Arthur, Carrie's kook of a father played with inimitable charm and chutzpah.  Deacon is the foil to Doug's Ralph Kramden character, ready and able to dive headlong into the broil of an ill-thought plot but savvy enough to know when to pull out.Other incidental and recurring characters help to give more flavor and fill out the cast.  And despite the character's exaggerations they are all down to earth.  My main complaint about this set is the graininess of a couple of episodes and frequent scenes throughout the episodes.  I don't know what this is due to but it was often distracting.",4,Lots of laughs marred by some grainy transfers.,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,868,"['Kevin', 'James', 'schlubby', 'Doug', 'Heffernan', 'make', 'laugh', 'antics', 'channel', '34', 'Honeymooners', '34', 'only', 'comedy', 'couple', 'better', 'giving', 'better', 'half', 'Carrie', 'much', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'plot', 'lines', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'lovable', 'loon', 'Arthur', 'Carrie', 'kook', 'father', 'played', 'inimitable', 'charm', 'chutzpah', 'Deacon', 'foil', 'Doug', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'character', 'ready', 'able', 'dive', 'headlong', 'broil', 'ill-thought', 'plot', 'savvy', 'enough', 'know', 'when', 'pull', 'out.Other', 'incidental', 'recurring', 'characters', 'help', 'give', 'more', 'flavor', 'fill', 'out', 'cast', 'character', 'exaggerations', 'are', 'down', 'earth', 'main', 'complaint', 'set', 'graininess', 'couple', 'episodes', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'due', 'was', 'often', 'distracting']",N/A
799507,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0001BS3IY,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","There's something to be said for sitcoms that have as a character a crotchety old father or father-in-law such as in Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, and King of Queens.  Just seems to work doesn't it?  This show really became a surprise hit and I was really upset when they moved it off of Mondays.  Why do networks do that?  it was such a perfect fit to precede Everybody Loves Raymond where Kevin James had been a frequent recurring character as Kevin.But this is just a plain funny show.  It never gets too serious and tries to tacking social issues.  We get enough of that.  It's a sitcom for middle America about the Heffernan's, Doug and Carrie.  He delivers parcels for IPS and she's a legal secretary.  They live in Queens with Carrie's father Arthur played beautifully by Jerry Stiller in a slightly toned down version of the Frank Costanza role he played in Seinfeld.My wife and teenage son and I really enjoy this show.  Here are some of my favorite episodes from Season two:""Assaulted Nuts"" Doug is supposed to meet Carrie on his lunch hour at a bank to sign for a loan for her to build a home office.  He accidently shoots himself in the groin with a staple gun but toughs out the trip to the bank and then has to go to the hospital to have it removed.""Dire Strayts"" Ray and Debra Barone make a guest appearance at the Heffernans for a BBQ.  Doug tries to get into the attic to fix the TV cable and ends up getting stuck in the attic hole.""net Prophets"" CArrie takes Dougs Christmas bonus and invests it into an online stock.  Doug makes her sell it when it goes down only to see it skyrocket after she sells.""Frozen Pop""  Arthur is too cold sleeping in his basement room so Doug and Carrie move him across the hall to the home office.  But Arthur begins intruding every moment on the pair and when it becomes warmer, they find he's become attached to his new room and doesn't want to go back downstairs.""Wild Cards"" Doug and Deacon sneak off to Atlantic City to gamble, telling the wives they had to make an emergency parcel delivery.  Doug of course loses all his money and ends up being caught in the lie.""Whine Country"" Carrie wants to go to Paris on vacation but Doug would rather rent an RV and go trekking around the country.  They flip a coin and Doug wins.  Carries gets even by dragging Arthur along on the trip.Great stuff.  My only disappointment is that the extras were very minimal.  Hopefully they will give us more in future sets.",5,A WORKING MAN'S SITCOM,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,2462,"['something', 'be', 'said', 'sitcoms', 'have', 'character', 'crotchety', 'old', 'father', 'father-in-law', 'such', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'King', 'Queens', 'Just', 'work', ""n't"", 'show', 'really', 'became', 'surprise', 'hit', 'was', 'really', 'upset', 'when', 'moved', 'Mondays', 'Why', 'do', 'networks', 'do', 'was', 'such', 'perfect', 'fit', 'precede', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'where', 'Kevin', 'James', 'had', 'been', 'frequent', 'recurring', 'character', 'Kevin.But', 'just', 'plain', 'funny', 'show', 'never', 'too', 'serious', 'tries', 'tacking', 'social', 'issues', 'get', 'enough', 'sitcom', 'middle', 'America', 'Heffernan', 'Doug', 'Carrie', 'parcels', 'IPS', 'legal', 'secretary', 'live', 'Queens', 'Carrie', 'father', 'Arthur', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Jerry', 'Stiller', 'slightly', 'toned', 'down', 'version', 'Frank', 'Costanza', 'role', 'played', 'Seinfeld.My', 'wife', 'teenage', 'son', 'really', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Here', 'are', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Season', 'two', 'Assaulted', 'Nuts', 'Doug', 'supposed', 'meet', 'Carrie', 'lunch', 'hour', 'bank', 'sign', 'loan', 'build', 'home', 'office', 'accidently', 'shoots', 'groin', 'staple', 'gun', 'out', 'trip', 'bank', 'then', 'go', 'hospital', 'have', 'removed', 'Dire', 'Strayts', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'Barone', 'make', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Heffernans', 'BBQ', 'Doug', 'get', 'attic', 'fix', 'TV', 'cable', 'up', 'getting', 'stuck', 'attic', 'hole', 'net', 'Prophets', 'CArrie', 'Dougs', 'Christmas', 'bonus', 'online', 'stock', 'Doug', 'sell', 'when', 'down', 'only', 'see', 'skyrocket', 'Frozen', 'Pop', 'Arthur', 'too', 'cold', 'sleeping', 'basement', 'room', 'so', 'Doug', 'Carrie', 'move', 'hall', 'home', 'office', 'Arthur', 'intruding', 'moment', 'pair', 'when', 'warmer', 'find', 'become', 'attached', 'new', 'room', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'back', 'downstairs', 'Wild', 'Cards', 'Doug', 'Deacon', 'sneak', 'off', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'gamble', 'telling', 'wives', 'had', 'make', 'emergency', 'parcel', 'delivery', 'Doug', 'course', 'money', 'up', 'being', 'caught', 'lie', 'Whine', 'Country', 'Carrie', 'go', 'Paris', 'vacation', 'Doug', 'would', 'rather', 'rent', 'RV', 'go', 'trekking', 'country', 'flip', 'coin', 'Doug', 'wins', 'Carries', 'even', 'dragging', 'Arthur', 'trip.Great', 'stuff', 'only', 'disappointment', 'extras', 'were', 'very', 'minimal', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'future', 'sets']",N/A
