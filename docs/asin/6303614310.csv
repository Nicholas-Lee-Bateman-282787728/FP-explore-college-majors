Perhaps it doesn't have the cultural importance or impact of ""Swimming to Cambodia"", but it's his most personal and open monologue.Like Jonathan Demme's approach with ""Swimming..."" Nick Broomfield (the second best documentary film-maker after Errol Morris) simply attempts to recreate the affect of seeing Spalding's live performance (Steven Soderberg's ""Gray's Anatomy"" tried a different non-live, internalised-externalised, impressionistic approach which doesn't entirely work, and the HBO production of Terrors of Pleasure is only worth it to actually see the peformance) and it's the best way of presenting such a theatre piece; point the camera at the man and let him talk!!!!!There are a few visual/stylistic moments - but they don't detract from the reason to see this masterpiece - Spalding himself.On the surface the monologue is about SG not being able to write his book Impossible vacation (largely about his mother's suicide) - but the bigger picture is a self-portrait of an impending nervous breakdown and his fortunate avoidance of it.There's wit and pathos to Gray's dialogue and performance, you'll be laughing and feel touched at the same time.If you've never seen or read anything by him - watch this and you'll be hooked!!!",5,Theatre as therapy,1023753600,"06 11, 2002",2002,1322,"['doubt', 'best', 'filmed', 'versions', 'Spalding', 'Gray', 'monologues', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", 'have', 'cultural', 'importance', 'impact', 'Swimming', 'Cambodia', 'most', 'personal', 'open', 'monologue.Like', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'approach', 'Swimming', 'Nick', 'Broomfield', 'second', 'best', 'documentary', 'film-maker', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'simply', 'recreate', 'affect', 'seeing', 'Spalding', 'live', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'Gray', 'Anatomy', 'tried', 'different', 'non-live', 'internalised-externalised', 'impressionistic', 'approach', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'work', 'HBO', 'production', 'Terrors', 'Pleasure', 'only', 'worth', 'actually', 'see', 'peformance', 'best', 'way', 'presenting', 'such', 'theatre', 'piece', 'point', 'camera', 'man', 'let', 'talk', 'are', 'few', 'visual/stylistic', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'detract', 'reason', 'see', 'masterpiece', 'Spalding', 'surface', 'monologue', 'SG', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'write', 'book', 'Impossible', 'vacation', 'largely', 'mother', 'suicide', 'bigger', 'picture', 'self-portrait', 'impending', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'fortunate', 'avoidance', 'it.There', 'wit', 'pathos', 'Gray', 'dialogue', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'feel', 'touched', 'same', 'time.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'read', 'anything', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked']",N/A

381712,AZ4JHTB28WC39,6303614310,Criterion Collector,"[2, 5]","Just saw this on DVR (taped off cable) and was appalled at how intrusive the soundtrack is.  Spalding Gray doesn't need a soundtrack, never mind one that is as jab-you-in-the-eye-with-a-stick obnoxious as this one.  The zooming and cutting and background images were also annoying, but I think I could have lived with that.  The music (by Laurie Andersen) is almost always unsuited to the subject matter.  And it is so loud at some points that I had trouble following what he was saying.  A total miscalculation in my opinion.  Just because they were both in the NYC downtown arts scene doesn't mean they belong together!  Glad to see that I can delete it from my DVR, because I can always buy this DVD if I feel compelled to watch it again.

381713,A20MSVXRPAPEGP,6303614310,Gareth L. Avelle,"[0, 0]","After reading ""The Journals of Spalding Gray,"" I decided to revisit his monologues with a fresh perspective. This was not without considerble trepidation, of course, having learned through my reading that his monologues (including ""Monster In A Box,"" ""Gray's Anatomy,"" the most-recently released "" And Everything Is Going Fine,"" and the acclaimed ""Swimming To Cambodia"") are essentially Gray stripping away all pretense and allowing us to see his troubled soul. The fact that he does it while keeping us in stitches of laughter testifies to the genius also at work. ""Monster In A Box"" will have to serve as an introduction to Gray for some, now that ""Swimming To Cambodia"" has been pulled from distribution. I don't know who is responsible for that, but I suggest they have their own neuroses to deal with. Bottom line is: the journal entries that so tragically describe Gray's downward spiral into the abyss of insanity do not fracture the spell Gray casts over the rest of us.",5,"""Monster In A Box""",1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,978,"['reading', 'Journals', 'Spalding', 'Gray', 'decided', 'revisit', 'monologues', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'was', 'not', 'considerble', 'trepidation', 'course', 'having', 'learned', 'reading', 'monologues', 'including', 'Monster', 'A', 'Box', 'Gray', 'Anatomy', 'most-recently', 'released', 'Everything', 'Going', 'Fine', 'acclaimed', 'Swimming', 'Cambodia', 'are', 'essentially', 'Gray', 'stripping', 'away', 'pretense', 'allowing', 'see', 'troubled', 'soul', 'fact', 'keeping', 'stitches', 'laughter', 'testifies', 'genius', 'also', 'work', 'Monster', 'A', 'Box', 'will', 'have', 'serve', 'introduction', 'Gray', 'now', 'Swimming', 'Cambodia', 'been', 'pulled', 'distribution', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'responsible', 'suggest', 'have', 'own', 'neuroses', 'deal', 'Bottom', 'line', 'journal', 'entries', 'so', 'tragically', 'describe', 'Gray', 'downward', 'spiral', 'abyss', 'insanity', 'do', 'not', 'fracture', 'spell', 'Gray', 'rest']",N/A

Barton ""Beth Barton""","[2, 2]","I agree with a previous reviewer that the directing (lighting, music and camera angles) are a little more obtrusive in this than they were in Swimming to Cambodia but they settle down toward the middle and become hardly noticeable (as they should be).Mr. Gray gives a fantastic performance again with what seems to me to be a very personal saga. It is a story within a story within a story. He centers around the writing of this novel which becomes &quot;the monster&quot;.  It is a fictional work that one eventually surmises is not fictional at all but a loosely based retelling of his relationship with his mother and her suicide while he was away and unable to intervene. Like I said - very personal. But there are all of these interruptions and these side trips - from a writer's retreatin New Hampshire to Los Angeles to South America to Russia to New York - each interesting and entertaining. And - somehow - they all end up back up at some center point. The book? Yes, but no.Check it out.

Every so often I had to pause the disk so I wouldn't miss his words as I was laughing until I coughed. Kudos to Spalding Gray, who turned the world on its side and gave his audiences the greatest gift -- laughter.Real comedy doesn't rely on the shock value of any version of the F word, and this is pure comedy that is rarely seen in the world today.  It is sad to know he is no longer with us, but his words will live on because they are honest and funny.  His monologue is slightly self-deprecating, but filled with experiences to which most audiences can relate. There will always be those who wanted a story they understood rather than the joy of the journey through one situation after another.Years ago a book stormed the market entitled (I think) Humor is the Best Medicine. Letting yourself laugh until you cry or cough exercises those all important lungs, stomach muscles and frees your mind and imagination. You need to laugh to let your mind have a little freedom, then follow a magnificent monologue presented by one of the best comedians I've experienced.  It was early, but I didn't want another show interfering with the joyous yet mellow feelings I experienced. I still laugh when I think of something in the film. I won't even mind not sleeping.The flow of the stories he tells is excellent and absorbing.  The monster is &#34;almost done&#34; at 1800 or 1900 pages. Every so often he refers to it. If you write at all, you know a book of that size wouldn't get published. But he takes you through trying to take a vacation in the most unique ways.I'll watch this many more times, and I know each time I'll get something I'd missed, and laugh as I did before.  Treat yourself to an hour and a half of fun with adult humor that even children could watch.5 stars to a master comedian.Victoria Tarrani in Florida.",5,A monologue that I couldn't quit watching or stop laughing.,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1917,"['ageless', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'still', 'awake', '3:00', 'AM', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', ""'m"", 'wired', 'so', 'often', 'had', 'pause', 'disk', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'words', 'was', 'laughing', 'coughed', 'Kudos', 'Spalding', 'Gray', 'who', 'turned', 'world', 'side', 'gave', 'audiences', 'greatest', 'gift', 'laughter.Real', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'rely', 'shock', 'value', 'version', 'F', 'word', 'pure', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'seen', 'world', 'today', 'sad', 'know', 'no', 'longer', 'words', 'will', 'live', 'are', 'honest', 'funny', 'monologue', 'slightly', 'self-deprecating', 'filled', 'experiences', 'most', 'audiences', 'can', 'relate', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'who', 'wanted', 'story', 'understood', 'rather', 'joy', 'journey', 'one', 'situation', 'another.Years', 'ago', 'book', 'stormed', 'market', 'entitled', 'think', 'Humor', 'Best', 'Medicine', 'Letting', 'cry', 'cough', 'exercises', 'important', 'lungs', 'stomach', 'muscles', 'frees', 'mind', 'imagination', 'need', 'laugh', 'let', 'mind', 'have', 'little', 'freedom', 'then', 'follow', 'magnificent', 'monologue', 'presented', 'one', 'best', 'comedians', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'was', 'early', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'show', 'interfering', 'joyous', 'yet', 'mellow', 'feelings', 'experienced', 'still', 'when', 'think', 'something', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'not', 'sleeping.The', 'flow', 'stories', 'excellent', 'absorbing', 'monster', '34', 'almost', 'done', '34', '1800', '1900', 'pages', 'Every', 'so', 'often', 'write', 'know', 'book', 'size', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'published', 'trying', 'take', 'vacation', 'most', 'unique', 'ways.I', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'know', 'time', ""'ll"", 'get', 'something', ""'d"", 'missed', 'did', 'before', 'Treat', 'hour', 'half', 'fun', 'adult', 'humor', 'even', 'children', 'could', 'watch.5', 'stars', 'master', 'comedian.Victoria', 'Tarrani', 'Florida']",N/A
