It detracted from the story and made you take your focus off the runners and their accomplishments.,4,Good movie,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,217,"['only', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'like/understand', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'necessary', 'mention', 'coach', 'infidelity', 'wife', 'detracted', 'story', 'made', 'take', 'focus', 'runners', 'accomplishments']",Fast Women

Follows a group of runners, their families and coaches on their journey to Olympic trials. Each of the women has a different style and approach to running, as well as their coaches.Some drama with coach infidelity puts them to the test.

The filming is something you could probably do yourself with a couple hours training.  It has some value but if you are wanting to learn how they train in any detail then you need to look elsewhere.  If you want some insights on what it is like then watch this.,3,I like running and this is about running,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,386,"['watch', 'will', 'fell', 'sat', 'front', 'runners', 'ran', 'moderate', 'elite', 'level', 'filming', 'something', 'could', 'probably', 'do', 'couple', 'hours', 'training', 'value', 'are', 'wanting', 'learn', 'how', 'train', 'detail', 'then', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'insights', 'what', 'then', 'watch']",Fast Women

Watching the runners and hearing their stories of progression and failure alike make for an interesting show. There is a lot of personal information on the runners -- almost too much for me but it still was able to keep my interest because it cut to running frequently enough.,3,"Fun and inspirational for all runners, not just women",1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,339,"['good', 'runner', 'documentary', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'Watching', 'runners', 'hearing', 'stories', 'progression', 'failure', 'alike', 'make', 'interesting', 'show', 'lot', 'personal', 'information', 'runners', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'still', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'interest', 'cut', 'running', 'frequently', 'enough']",Fast Women
1436245,A2RG6V2HH02U0M,B00514JK06,Stephen Pellerine,"[8, 9]","Great documentary here. If you are a sociable runner and enjoy running tales to give a bit of inspiration, this is a 5 star.This is an interesting documentary/docudrama looking at the challenges and successes of a few women engaged in the lifestyle and the art of running/marathon training. As a marathoner myself I enjoyed each of the runners' stories and felt inspired to run immediately after (although it doesn't take much to make me feel this way).It is a movie sociable runners will enjoy. It is a great contribution to the videos out there on running and would fit well into your collection especially if you have others like:PrefontaineRunning BraveRun for Your LifeHood To Coast 2-Disc Special Edition DVDSpirit of the MarathonMarathon ChallengeIf you own and enjoyed any of the above - I think you will also appreciate this one as well.It could also be a wonderful course video for Applied Media students as the style and simplicity of the film is one new videograpers and those whom want to produce their own documentaries.It is probably not a movie for non-runners, or more specifically for folks not looking for inspirational tales from athletes.  It could be, but I just want to point out that this is not a Hollywood blockbuster here. BUT - I need to stress again, if a runner the rating will probably be very high.",5,If a sociable runner,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,1330,"['Great', 'documentary', 'here', 'are', 'sociable', 'runner', 'enjoy', 'running', 'tales', 'give', 'bit', 'inspiration', '5', 'star.This', 'interesting', 'documentary/docudrama', 'looking', 'challenges', 'successes', 'few', 'women', 'engaged', 'lifestyle', 'art', 'running/marathon', 'training', 'marathoner', 'enjoyed', 'runners', 'stories', 'felt', 'inspired', 'run', 'immediately', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'make', 'feel', 'way', '.It', 'movie', 'sociable', 'runners', 'will', 'enjoy', 'great', 'contribution', 'videos', 'there', 'running', 'would', 'fit', 'well', 'collection', 'especially', 'have', 'others', 'PrefontaineRunning', 'BraveRun', 'LifeHood', 'Coast', '2-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVDSpirit', 'MarathonMarathon', 'ChallengeIf', 'own', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'will', 'also', 'appreciate', 'one', 'well.It', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'wonderful', 'course', 'video', 'Applied', 'Media', 'students', 'style', 'simplicity', 'film', 'one', 'new', 'videograpers', 'whom', 'want', 'produce', 'own', 'documentaries.It', 'probably', 'not', 'movie', 'non-runners', 'more', 'specifically', 'folks', 'not', 'looking', 'inspirational', 'tales', 'athletes', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'here', 'BUT', 'need', 'stress', 'again', 'runner', 'rating', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'high']",Fast Women
