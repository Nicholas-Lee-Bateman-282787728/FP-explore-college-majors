Major success, major tours and incredible music. I am not a huge Journey fan or a big  classic rock guy, but I can tell when a band is on all cylinders.I grew up constantly hearing this stuff, and though I liked it, I never saw the big deal with this band back then. And though I am a Metal Head at heart and listen to Progressive Rock/Metal for the most part, there is no denying that Journey were a great live band in 1980 and beyond. This disc is a total reminder of that fact. Especially when this Escape tour was going on. Steve Perry sings his heart out here, the band is very tight and the sound quality is stellar. You can feel the energy that a good live CD can bring when you listen.I own all of 2 Journey discs in my 1100+ CD collection, this and Escape. Its usually not my thing, but there was something truly magical about these albums that really brings you back when you listen to them now. Everything they touched in this 80's period was gold. There is a reason for that. Great Great music and atmosphere. This disc is a must have for all Classic Rock and Journey Fans. The songs speak for themselves.90% of these songs were hits, so you shouldn't need a break down of the track list. Just think back to those old Live MTV videos and that is what you get on this Live disc. A truly great, sincere performance and a bunch of great memories.",4,Magical Period,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1424,"['period', 'Journey', ""'79"", ""'82"", 'was', 'incredible', 'band', 'Major', 'success', 'major', 'tours', 'incredible', 'music', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'Journey', 'fan', 'big', 'classic', 'rock', 'guy', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'band', 'cylinders.I', 'grew', 'up', 'constantly', 'hearing', 'stuff', 'liked', 'never', 'saw', 'big', 'deal', 'band', 'back', 'then', 'am', 'Metal', 'Head', 'heart', 'listen', 'Progressive', 'Rock/Metal', 'most', 'part', 'denying', 'Journey', 'were', 'great', 'live', 'band', '1980', 'disc', 'total', 'reminder', 'fact', 'Especially', 'when', 'Escape', 'tour', 'was', 'going', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'heart', 'here', 'band', 'very', 'tight', 'sound', 'quality', 'stellar', 'can', 'feel', 'energy', 'good', 'live', 'CD', 'can', 'bring', 'when', 'listen.I', 'own', '2', 'Journey', 'discs', '1100+', 'CD', 'collection', 'Escape', 'usually', 'not', 'thing', 'was', 'something', 'truly', 'magical', 'albums', 'really', 'back', 'when', 'listen', 'now', 'Everything', 'touched', '80', 'period', 'was', 'gold', 'reason', 'Great', 'Great', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'disc', 'must', 'have', 'Classic', 'Rock', 'Journey', 'Fans', 'songs', 'speak', 'themselves.90', '%', 'songs', 'were', 'hits', 'should', ""n't"", 'need', 'break', 'down', 'track', 'list', 'Just', 'think', 'back', 'old', 'Live', 'MTV', 'videos', 'what', 'get', 'Live', 'disc', 'truly', 'great', 'sincere', 'performance', 'bunch', 'great', 'memories']",N/A

The previously-recorded live album, CAPTURED, featured Gregg Rolie, whereas this one features Jonathan Cain on keyboards. It has been said that the band's manager, Herbie Herbert, didn't really like Cain, but that's irrelevant, as Cain brought more of a pop feel to the band.
