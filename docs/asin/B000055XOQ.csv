These dancers I liked. They were disciplined, wove beautiful patterns of movement on stage, and created an atmosphere of grace and polish. Mezentseva bore well the starring role. As pointed out by many reviews, she is skinny. Most ballet dancers I have seen are skinny. I saw no difference in her than in the norm. After all, we are speaking of a discipline to which access has been denied to normally endowed women for that fact alone. What I did miss is what a Leon Bakst, Marc Chagall, Eugene Berman, David Hockney, William Kentridge, Bonnard, Picasso, and others of their kind, brought to the stage, costumes and scenery, which inspire immersion by audiences into the world that the dancers create. For my money, they might better have been performing on a bare stage in rehearsal clothes.All-in-all, though, despite these deficiencies, and the obvious lack of room given for bravura male dancing,  most who enjoy dance, without knowing the technicalities of performing, should enjoy this performance. By the way, as is customary, though not without exception, in Kultur discs, there is no additional material of any sort.",4,From the Desk of a ballet Ignoramus,1304380800,"05 3, 2011",2011,1290,"['know', 'very', 'little', 'ballet', 'have', 'seen', 'only', 'few', 'seasons', 'Balanchine', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'nearly', 'half', 'century', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'like', 'see', 'dancers', 'liked', 'were', 'disciplined', 'wove', 'beautiful', 'patterns', 'movement', 'stage', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'grace', 'polish', 'Mezentseva', 'bore', 'well', 'starring', 'role', 'pointed', 'out', 'many', 'reviews', 'skinny', 'Most', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'skinny', 'saw', 'difference', 'norm', 'are', 'speaking', 'discipline', 'access', 'been', 'denied', 'normally', 'endowed', 'women', 'fact', 'alone', 'What', 'did', 'miss', 'what', 'Leon', 'Bakst', 'Marc', 'Chagall', 'Eugene', 'Berman', 'David', 'Hockney', 'William', 'Kentridge', 'Bonnard', 'Picasso', 'others', 'kind', 'brought', 'stage', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'inspire', 'immersion', 'audiences', 'world', 'dancers', 'create', 'money', 'might', 'better', 'have', 'been', 'performing', 'bare', 'stage', 'rehearsal', 'clothes.All-in-all', 'though', 'deficiencies', 'obvious', 'lack', 'room', 'given', 'bravura', 'male', 'dancing', 'most', 'who', 'enjoy', 'dance', 'knowing', 'technicalities', 'performing', 'should', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'way', 'customary', 'not', 'exception', 'Kultur', 'discs', 'additional', 'material', 'sort']",N/A

567288,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B000055XOQ,J. Lizzi,"[27, 34]","This is a solid, classically rendered performance of Giselle by a decent cast.  The one brilliantly shining star is Alessandra Ferri, who, in my opinion, is among the best at portraying the most emotional and expressive of ballerinas.  This performance, which took place at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, around 1995-96, caught Ms. Ferri in her well-seasoned prime.  She's a joy to watch.As for the ballet, nothing really stood out.  Besides Ms. Ferri, none of the other cast members caused me to jump for joy ... no stupendous efforts; just basic dancing.  Neither did I see anything to make me gasp.  The stage design and costumes looked pretty familiar, the lighting was fine, and the music came through clearly.  One-word summary for everything:  satisfactory.Unfortunately, the video problems were serious.  The disc cover notes say ""Recorded Live in HDTV,"" but the transfer to DVD was problematic, with one decidedly bad result:  the outline of the dancers blurs whenever there is movement.  I could overlook this on some occasions, but the glitch persisted.The camera editing was good, but not great.  There were several instances during the dancing where some close-ups made me miss the full head-to-toe posture that I prefer when I'm watching dance.  This may not bother other viewers who like to get as many closer-up views of the characters' faces as possible.Another glaring video distraction had to do with a particular camera that was positioned in the back of the orchestra pit, right about at stage level.  Aside from having way too low of a vantage point, this camera created a distortion characteristic of wide-angle lenses, whereby the images at the edge of the frame move in rotational fashion as the camera pans from side to side.  Further, the camera was operated remotely, and seemed to swivel in one plane, thus creating a kind of ""robotic"" movement.  I don't understand why this was even used, since there was another camera, also centrally located but higher up, which rendered a far more natural perspective.I would recommend this DVD to most viewers except some ballet fanatics and others who are sensitive to flawed video work.",3,Decent performance; Ferri shines; major video problems,1044835200,"02 10, 2003",2003,2153,"['solid', 'classically', 'rendered', 'performance', 'Giselle', 'decent', 'cast', 'one', 'brilliantly', 'shining', 'star', 'Alessandra', 'Ferri', 'who', 'opinion', 'best', 'portraying', 'most', 'emotional', 'expressive', 'ballerinas', 'performance', 'took', 'place', 'Teatro', 'alla', 'Scala', 'Milan', '1995-96', 'caught', 'Ms.', 'Ferri', 'well-seasoned', 'prime', 'joy', 'watch.As', 'ballet', 'nothing', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'Ms.', 'Ferri', 'none', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'caused', 'jump', 'joy', 'stupendous', 'efforts', 'just', 'dancing', 'did', 'see', 'anything', 'make', 'gasp', 'stage', 'design', 'costumes', 'looked', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'lighting', 'was', 'fine', 'music', 'came', 'clearly', 'One-word', 'summary', 'everything', 'satisfactory.Unfortunately', 'video', 'problems', 'were', 'serious', 'disc', 'cover', 'notes', 'say', 'Recorded', 'Live', 'HDTV', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'was', 'problematic', 'one', 'decidedly', 'bad', 'result', 'outline', 'dancers', 'blurs', 'whenever', 'movement', 'could', 'overlook', 'occasions', 'glitch', 'persisted.The', 'camera', 'editing', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'were', 'several', 'instances', 'dancing', 'where', 'close-ups', 'made', 'miss', 'full', 'head-to-toe', 'posture', 'prefer', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'dance', 'may', 'not', 'bother', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'like', 'get', 'many', 'closer-up', 'views', 'characters', 'possible.Another', 'glaring', 'video', 'distraction', 'had', 'do', 'particular', 'camera', 'was', 'positioned', 'back', 'orchestra', 'pit', 'right', 'stage', 'level', 'Aside', 'having', 'way', 'too', 'low', 'vantage', 'point', 'camera', 'created', 'distortion', 'characteristic', 'wide-angle', 'lenses', 'whereby', 'images', 'edge', 'frame', 'move', 'rotational', 'fashion', 'camera', 'side', 'side', 'Further', 'camera', 'was', 'operated', 'remotely', 'seemed', 'swivel', 'one', 'plane', 'thus', 'creating', 'kind', 'robotic', 'movement', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'used', 'was', 'camera', 'also', 'centrally', 'located', 'higher', 'up', 'rendered', 'far', 'more', 'natural', 'perspective.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'most', 'viewers', 'ballet', 'fanatics', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'sensitive', 'flawed', 'video', 'work']",N/A
567289,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,B000055XOQ,J. M WILINSKY,"[20, 25]","This performance from 1982 features Galina Mezentseva as Giselle and Konstantin Zaklinsky(Altynai Asylmuratova's husband) as Albrecht.  You may have seen these two in a Kirov production of Swan Lake from the same period(also available on DVD from Amazon.com).  They both dance quite well together and separately.  This is a very complete version with all the usual solos and an entire peasant pas de deux, with every variation and very challenging choreography(such as a double prouette from a kneeling position).  The Myrtha( danced by Tatyana Terekhova) variation is also complete.  At the end of Myrtha's opening adagio, she walks off stage(right) and is then seen flying high in the sky across the stage; she then reappears, walking on stage(left) and continues with her variation.  That was unusual.  There is also a great deal of mime in this, more than I have ever seen in this ballet.  As far as the quality of the dancing is concerned, this certainly is at the highest standards.  I should point out that Mezentseva's personality is very quiet and demure and some of you may wonder if this is a good part for her.  It is difficult to say.  I usually don't like to focus on such things.  Furthermore, since this production is more than 20 years old, some may not be satisfied with the quality, although I would say the image(full screen) and sound(Dolby 2.0) are very good.  Is this the perfect Giselle for you?  I bought it to have another performance by Mezentseva and Zaklinsky and I am very happy with it.

567290,AIJUXB9WUHYK1,B000055XOQ,Quo Primum,"[6, 10]","It is unfortunate to have to give this ballet only two stars, as the Kirov Ballet does a wonderful job and the corp is quite talented.  I bought this DVD to replace a 1983 Bolshoi version that I no longer have, and I must say that I am also disappointed in Galina ""eat a cracker"" Mezentseva's performance.  I have to agree with other reviewer that her gaunt look does distract from the role.  I watched and saw that she could not carry off the youthful, joyous love of Act I and hoped that she could carry off the haunting, mysterious love of the second.  And she couldn't.  I also hoped that at least her technique was superior, and there again she fell short in this version - she may have been one of the best ballarinas ever but in her extensions of this performance she frequntly wobbles on her right foot, fighting for balance.  I think if you watch closely, you will pick this up.I studied the other Wilis to see if they were as thin at Galina, and saw several that were very close.  I hope that the directors of the Kirov are not promoting this among their ballarinas???There is applause and yelling from the audience throughout the performance, which was more typical of a sporting event than a ballet.  Its quite distracting from the flow of the story.To preempt the gentleman who seemed to think that negative reviewers were fed on a diet of bad american television, I can state that is not the case here, and that I have seen theatrical productions, concerts, ballets, etc... on three continents.If you can get your hands on the 1983 Bolshoi version of this I think you will not be disappointed.

567291,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B000055XOQ,R. Nicholson,"[33, 35]","A spectacular, stunning Giselle!This DVD version of Giselle was recorded live at La Scala. It stars Alessandra Ferri as Giselle and  Massimo Murru as  Albrecht: both give stellar performances.There are the many wonderful moments in this production: I'll touch briefly on a few....-Ferri is breathtaking in her interpretation of the main character: her dancing is vibrant and her acting and expressions capture the essence of the naive, love-stuck young girl in Act I, and then, as the protective Wili for the final Act.-The costumes and sets are beautiful. For example, in the village scenes of Act I, the corps de ballet wear gold and rust colored outfits , while Ferri,as Giselle, wears a sky blue skirt with a navy blue top that  makes her stand out from the other performers. She is simply stunning, your eye cannot help but be drawn to her  in this setting.-There is something about ballet done before a live audience. This ""Giselle"" is so enchanting, you could really appreciate the reaction of the audience: enthusiastically clapping and cheering, almost before some of the scenes ended.- And last but not least, there is the music by Adolphe Adams: melodies so beautiful and haunting that when combined with the choreography for this work, have resulted in a ballet that has become an ageless masterpiece. What a thrill it must have been to have been there that night.Technically, I thought the cameras were well placed  and film editing was, with one or two exceptions, well done. The DVD has superb video and audio, and the menu allows you to go to any scene you like.All in all a recording of Giselle of the highest quality.P.S. If I had to pick a Giselle to buy, this is the DVD I'd recommend. The other notable offering of Giselle is the movie version by the American Ballet Theatre starring Carla Fracci and Eric Bruhn.

567292,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,B000055XOQ,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[8, 15]","This 1996 production of the Romantic classic &quot;Giselle&quot; ballet was staged and performed for the opera theatre La Scala in Milan, Italy. The production stars Allesandra Ferri in the title role. This version is one of two I've seen that I feel are quite good as far as visually and choreography. There is another one which is obscure with another A-list ballerina who is more into character, especially in Giselle's Mad Scene and Death Scene. The dancers in this production are doing an excellent job and Allesandra Ferri as Giselle is suitable. What most grabs me abou this production is the visuals. The scenery and sets, costumes and the shots of La Scala's auditorium, with its lights, golden tiers and plush red carpets. La Scala is mostly an opera house but now and then they have ballets performed on stage.Giselle was originally a German fairy tale or folk tale. The male dancer Jules Perrot, who was the ballet instructor at the Paris Opera Ballet in the 19th century, decided to put the story into a ballet and choreographed the dances. Soon, it was enjoying great successes and all the lead ballerinas of the day were dancing the role. The role is still a very juicy and career-boosting opportunity for ballerinas today. Giselle tells the story of a village girl who is engaged to a village man. Her mother is the operator of a country inn. When Albrecht, a prince, comes to the village and the surrounding forest to hunt, he falls for Giselle. He does not reveal his identity and Giselle is under the impression he is a wealthy hunter. Hilarion, Giselle's husband-to-be, is jealous and bitter that Giselle has fallen for Albrecht. Hilarion soon tears off the mask of Albrecht's disguising. Not only is he a prince, but he is engaged to marry an aristocratic lady. When Giselle learns of the deception, she becomes insane and dies. That is only Act 1. Act 2 deals with Albrecht's mourning of Giselle and his encounter with the Willis, the ghosts of women dressed in white gowns the young virgins who died before their wedding day. They are lead by Martha or sometimes called Myrtha, the Queen of the Willis. Giselle is among them. When they threaten to kill Albrecht, Giselle intervenes and saves him. But they can never be together as they inhabit different worlds - Albrecht the world of the living and the day and Giselle the world of the dead and the night. The ballet was considered the first true Romantic ballet-blanc, originating the tradition of ballerinas in the corps wearing white. Later, this would be seen in La Bayadere and most prominently in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.",5,Giselle In La Scala,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2601,"['1996', 'production', 'Romantic', 'classic', 'quot', 'Giselle', 'quot', 'ballet', 'was', 'staged', 'performed', 'opera', 'theatre', 'La', 'Scala', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'production', 'Allesandra', 'Ferri', 'title', 'role', 'version', 'one', 'two', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'feel', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'far', 'visually', 'choreography', 'one', 'obscure', 'A-list', 'ballerina', 'who', 'more', 'character', 'especially', 'Giselle', 'Mad', 'Scene', 'Death', 'Scene', 'dancers', 'production', 'are', 'doing', 'excellent', 'job', 'Allesandra', 'Ferri', 'Giselle', 'suitable', 'What', 'most', 'grabs', 'abou', 'production', 'visuals', 'scenery', 'sets', 'costumes', 'shots', 'La', 'Scala', 'auditorium', 'lights', 'golden', 'tiers', 'plush', 'red', 'carpets', 'La', 'Scala', 'mostly', 'opera', 'house', 'now', 'then', 'have', 'ballets', 'performed', 'stage.Giselle', 'was', 'originally', 'German', 'fairy', 'tale', 'folk', 'tale', 'male', 'dancer', 'Jules', 'Perrot', 'who', 'was', 'ballet', 'instructor', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'Ballet', '19th', 'century', 'decided', 'put', 'story', 'ballet', 'choreographed', 'dances', 'Soon', 'was', 'enjoying', 'great', 'successes', 'lead', 'ballerinas', 'day', 'were', 'dancing', 'role', 'role', 'still', 'very', 'juicy', 'career-boosting', 'opportunity', 'ballerinas', 'today', 'Giselle', 'story', 'village', 'girl', 'who', 'engaged', 'village', 'man', 'mother', 'operator', 'country', 'inn', 'When', 'Albrecht', 'prince', 'village', 'surrounding', 'forest', 'hunt', 'Giselle', 'not', 'reveal', 'identity', 'Giselle', 'impression', 'wealthy', 'hunter', 'Hilarion', 'Giselle', 'husband-to-be', 'jealous', 'bitter', 'Giselle', 'fallen', 'Albrecht', 'Hilarion', 'soon', 'mask', 'Albrecht', 'disguising', 'Not', 'only', 'prince', 'engaged', 'marry', 'aristocratic', 'lady', 'When', 'Giselle', 'deception', 'insane', 'dies', 'only', 'Act', '1', 'Act', '2', 'deals', 'Albrecht', 'mourning', 'Giselle', 'encounter', 'Willis', 'ghosts', 'women', 'dressed', 'white', 'gowns', 'young', 'virgins', 'who', 'died', 'wedding', 'day', 'are', 'lead', 'Martha', 'sometimes', 'called', 'Myrtha', 'Queen', 'Willis', 'Giselle', 'When', 'threaten', 'kill', 'Albrecht', 'Giselle', 'intervenes', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'together', 'inhabit', 'different', 'worlds', 'world', 'living', 'day', 'Giselle', 'world', 'dead', 'night', 'ballet', 'was', 'considered', 'first', 'true', 'Romantic', 'ballet-blanc', 'originating', 'tradition', 'ballerinas', 'corps', 'wearing', 'white', 'Later', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'La', 'Bayadere', 'most', 'prominently', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Swan', 'Lake']",N/A

Ascher,"[0, 0]","At the time of its release I felt this was the best overall Giselle, combining youthful freshness, exquisite performances, direction and camerawork. I found it extremely moving to see a performance where both principals still look young, involved and excited by dance and love!  There are no weak elements in this.  Choreography, performances, sets, lighting, camerawork, everything works.  Plus this is a live audience which adds an overlay of involvement and excitement!  I would have given this 6* if I could!More recently a couple of new productions have been released in blu-ray, most notably the one with the Dutch National Ballet, which I feel is both artistically and technically superior.  See my review of this one, with anna Tsygankova and Jozef Vargo for an update.",5,Youthful freshness combined with superb dancing and staging!,1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,777,"['time', 'release', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'overall', 'Giselle', 'combining', 'youthful', 'freshness', 'exquisite', 'performances', 'direction', 'camerawork', 'found', 'extremely', 'moving', 'see', 'performance', 'where', 'principals', 'still', 'look', 'young', 'involved', 'excited', 'dance', 'love', 'are', 'weak', 'elements', 'Choreography', 'performances', 'sets', 'lighting', 'camerawork', 'everything', 'works', 'live', 'audience', 'overlay', 'involvement', 'excitement', 'would', 'have', 'given', '6*', 'could', 'More', 'recently', 'couple', 'new', 'productions', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'blu-ray', 'most', 'notably', 'one', 'Dutch', 'National', 'Ballet', 'feel', 'artistically', 'technically', 'superior', 'See', 'review', 'one', 'anna', 'Tsygankova', 'Jozef', 'Vargo', 'update']",N/A

The production is very beautiful, the sound is quite good and the performance of Ferri is lovely. I have some reservations about some of the camera work - for example in the important first moments of Giselle's mad scene, the camera cuts to a reaction shot of her lover and the court, and there are some other odd choices like that. Some of the Wili scenes would benefit from a wider camera shot as well. But given what is available on DVD, this is as fine a choice as you will find.",4,A very solid recommendation,1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,558,"['one', 'looking', 'solid', 'traditional', 'GISELLE', 'good', 'choice', 'production', 'very', 'beautiful', 'sound', 'quite', 'good', 'performance', 'Ferri', 'lovely', 'have', 'reservations', 'camera', 'work', 'example', 'important', 'first', 'moments', 'Giselle', 'mad', 'scene', 'camera', 'reaction', 'shot', 'lover', 'court', 'are', 'other', 'odd', 'choices', 'Wili', 'scenes', 'would', 'benefit', 'wider', 'camera', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'given', 'what', 'available', 'DVD', 'as', 'fine', 'choice', 'will', 'find']",N/A
