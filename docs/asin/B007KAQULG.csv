I never intended to purchase the series, but every one I see, I just love. The ones that have music are becoming really just great to me. No, I don't speak Korean, but their talent speaks in every language. They put so much into doing a drama it is hard to explain. Watching outtakes which they include in almost every series, gives insight into just what they experience. It is unbelievable filming in sub zero weather in water scenes as they did in Boys Over Flowers. I can't imagine, but one can see how cold it is in many of the series as you can see their breath. In Dream High, they make jokes about no heat. In Dream High Too, they make one scene where the one office is heated and the rest of the sets are freezing. I bought Hearstrings as I liked the cast. It did not let me down. Again, the story was so original. I am considering the sound track from this one too if most of the music is recorded. If you like to laugh, cry, fall in love, feel passion, joy, sadness, and can't always figure out the ending, give Korean drama a try...then the music.",5,Series is really great...Amazon has this through a dealer,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,1123,"['am', 'becoming', 'maybe', 'already', 'am', 'enraptured', 'Korean', 'drama', 'never', 'intended', 'purchase', 'series', 'one', 'see', 'just', 'love', 'ones', 'have', 'music', 'are', 'becoming', 'really', 'just', 'great', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Korean', 'talent', 'speaks', 'language', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'doing', 'drama', 'hard', 'explain', 'Watching', 'outtakes', 'include', 'almost', 'series', 'insight', 'just', 'what', 'experience', 'unbelievable', 'filming', 'sub', 'zero', 'weather', 'water', 'scenes', 'did', 'Boys', 'Over', 'Flowers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'cold', 'many', 'series', 'can', 'see', 'breath', 'Dream', 'High', 'make', 'jokes', 'heat', 'Dream', 'High', 'Too', 'make', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'office', 'heated', 'rest', 'sets', 'are', 'freezing', 'bought', 'Hearstrings', 'liked', 'cast', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'Again', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'original', 'am', 'considering', 'sound', 'track', 'one', 'too', 'most', 'music', 'recorded', 'like', 'laugh', 'cry', 'fall', 'love', 'feel', 'passion', 'joy', 'sadness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'figure', 'out', 'ending', 'give', 'Korean', 'drama', 'try', 'then', 'music']",Heartstrings / You've Fallen for Me (2011) Korean Drama with English Subtitle

1532695,A3L4DIB3CUWTII,B007KAQULG,LoveBug,"[0, 0]","Lee Gyu Won and Lee Shin are students at an art college. Lee Gyu Won is a traditional Korean music major who happens to be the granddaughter of a famed musician of traditional Korean music. Her grandfather is a very narrow-minded and strict man who demands that Lee Gyu Won follow in his footsteps. Lee Shin is laid back, but is a talented and very popular rock band guitarist and lead singer.Lee Gyu Won hires Lee Shin's band for a gig to help raise money for an ill teacher. But Lee Shin doesn't show up. Lee Gyu Won confronts Lee Shin and they immediately despise each other. They both insult each other's music and decide to have a competition. The loser is the winner's slave for a period of time. Because of an incident during the competition, Lee Gyu Won loses. Lee Shin orders Lee Gyu Won around every chance he gets. When the bet has been completed, they plan to go their separate ways. However, both unexpectedly join the school's 100th Anniversary Performance and they are thrown back together for rehearsals. After spending so much time together, will they end up falling for each other?I love the main actor (Jung Yong Hwa) and actress (Park Shin Hye) in this story. They were in another Korean drama called ""You're  Beautiful."" I was hoping to find another show where they were both starring and I came across this. They have good chemistry. They are both great singers, I have all the songs from this show on my iPod. (The main actor is from a band called C.N. Blue. All of the band members are on the show too.) It's a romantic comedy about music, love, and pursuing one's dreams. It's my absolute favorite Korean show. I highly recommend this drama.

1532697,A57UZXTQU9DJE,B007KAQULG,Supernatural Rocks,"[18, 20]","At first I wasn't too sure if I was going to like this K-Drama but then I heard Jung Yong Hwa (leader of K-Pop Group CN Blue) sing and that was it.  This show really picked up and was hilarious.  Loved the relationship between Lee Shin and Lee Gyu Won.Lee Shin is a popular university student majoring in Western Music.  All the girls adore him because he is the vocalist and guitarist of the band ""The Stupid."" Shin is known for his good looks, cocky personality, and strong passion for music. Everyone around him knows him for his cold-hearted and distant personality, but deep down he has a soft side hidden away. He lacks interest in anything unrelated to music and has neither dreams nor plans for the future. At first he is smitten with a dance professor at the university, but this all changes when he meets Lee Gyu Won, a bright, clumsy, outgoing student from a prestigious family.  She is majoring in Traditional Korean Music and her instrument is the gayageum. Gyu Won's grandfather, Lee Dong Gun, is one of the top 3 traditional musicians of his age and his biggest wish is to see his granddaughter become a traditional music prodigy. While trying to live up to her grandfather's expectations, Gyu Won is so involved in trying to please her grandfather, her life as a university student is boring.  She knows nothing much outside of her studies. As her friends are fans of ""The Stupid"", she is forced to go to the band's concert with them. There she sees Lee Shin performing live, and is immediately captivated by him.  However, the two clash and it's an all out war when Lee Gyu-Won challenges Lee Shin to a music duel (Korean Traditional Music to Western Music).I have watched this K-Drama twice and it gets even better.  The first time I was paying more attention to the subtitles to truly enjoy it.  Second time I watched it, my attention was more on the actors.  The interactions between the characters are hilarious.  Gyu Won is perfect because she is so clumsy and everything embarrassing seems to happen to her while Lee Shin is cold, always dressed in the latest fashions, and the persona of cool.  The two play off of each other perfectly.  Definitely one of my favorite K-Dramas!!!  And like I mentioned at the beginning the music is great!!!  Love Jung Yong Hwa's voice.  :)",5,HILARIOUS K-DRAMA WITH GREAT MUSIC,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,2297,"['first', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'K-Drama', 'then', 'heard', 'Jung', 'Yong', 'Hwa', 'leader', 'K-Pop', 'Group', 'CN', 'Blue', 'sing', 'was', 'show', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Loved', 'relationship', 'Lee', 'Shin', 'Lee', 'Gyu', 'Won.Lee', 'Shin', 'popular', 'university', 'student', 'majoring', 'Western', 'Music', 'girls', 'adore', 'vocalist', 'guitarist', 'band', 'Stupid', 'Shin', 'known', 'good', 'looks', 'cocky', 'personality', 'strong', 'passion', 'music', 'Everyone', 'cold-hearted', 'distant', 'personality', 'deep', 'soft', 'side', 'hidden', 'away', 'interest', 'anything', 'unrelated', 'music', 'dreams', 'plans', 'future', 'first', 'smitten', 'dance', 'professor', 'university', 'changes', 'when', 'Lee', 'Gyu', 'Won', 'bright', 'clumsy', 'outgoing', 'student', 'prestigious', 'family', 'majoring', 'Traditional', 'Korean', 'Music', 'instrument', 'gayageum', 'Gyu', 'Won', 'grandfather', 'Lee', 'Dong', 'Gun', 'one', 'top', '3', 'traditional', 'musicians', 'age', 'biggest', 'wish', 'see', 'granddaughter', 'become', 'traditional', 'music', 'prodigy', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'grandfather', 'expectations', 'Gyu', 'Won', 'so', 'involved', 'trying', 'please', 'grandfather', 'life', 'university', 'student', 'boring', 'nothing', 'much', 'studies', 'friends', 'are', 'fans', 'Stupid', 'forced', 'go', 'band', 'concert', 'Lee', 'Shin', 'performing', 'live', 'immediately', 'captivated', 'However', 'two', 'clash', 'out', 'war', 'when', 'Lee', 'Gyu-Won', 'Lee', 'Shin', 'music', 'duel', 'Korean', 'Traditional', 'Music', 'Western', 'Music', '.I', 'have', 'watched', 'K-Drama', 'twice', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'paying', 'more', 'attention', 'subtitles', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'Second', 'time', 'watched', 'attention', 'was', 'more', 'actors', 'interactions', 'characters', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Gyu', 'Won', 'perfect', 'so', 'clumsy', 'everything', 'embarrassing', 'happen', 'Lee', 'Shin', 'cold', 'always', 'dressed', 'latest', 'fashions', 'persona', 'cool', 'two', 'play', 'other', 'perfectly', 'Definitely', 'one', 'favorite', 'K-Dramas', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'music', 'great', 'Love', 'Jung', 'Yong', 'Hwa', 'voice']",Heartstrings / You've Fallen for Me (2011) Korean Drama with English Subtitle
