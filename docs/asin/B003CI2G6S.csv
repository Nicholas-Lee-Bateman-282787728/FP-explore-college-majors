1336336,A3RX6E9EP1J5WW,B003CI2G6S,A Christy,"[10, 14]","This is one of those rare movies that brings history to life in a way that moves the mind of today. I also think it is much misunderstood by some of the critical reviewers; both in the science and in the art of it. I'd like to try to clear some of that up and encourage more movie lovers to give this one a view.Before I begin, I would request that those who click ""Helpful"" or ""Not Helpful"" not make their decision by deciding they don't like my description of their religion. I'm reviewing a movie, not anyone's religious beliefs and would ask that you decide based on that.Our main character is Hypatia of Alexandria. Most people aren't even familiar with that name anymore, which is a sad statement on our public education system, but that is another story altogether. As an introduction, Hypatia was a somewhat mysterious scholar and lecturer in Alexandria during the second half of the 4th century. To put it into context, her skills in mathematics joined with her deep knowledge of philosophy (she was a student of Ptolemy) and ability to speak made her not just a brilliant scientist but one capable of transmitting that knowledge in an engaging way to students. Needless to say, she was popular and her students traveled from all over the known world to hear her and study under her.Why she remains mysterious is entwined with her death and the rise of the Christian church at this time. Much of what she did was destroyed and, in fact, most of the knowledge of the time was purposefully destroyed by Christians as they rose to power. Most of what survives of Hypatia is third person in the form of letters about her and her discoveries and a few remaining scraps from her lifetime.In the movie, we follow Hypatia and the larger city of Alexandria through a time of tumult and change. Christianity is on the rise and in Rome, the Emporer has become a Christian (though retrospective analysis indicates it was a political move to capitolize on the violent action of early Christians in suppressing a populace that questioned rule by Emporers and wanted a return to the Republic). In effect, now all those in government must also convert...even at the point of a spear. Some, however, are genuine believers. It is the ignorance of the uneducated combined with the justification that no matter what you do, if you *can* do it then it must be this god's will that helped to set the ancient world ablaze in our story.In order to not spoil the movie for others, I'll not get into too many details that unfold during the movie. The general progression is that Hypatia, who lives to learn and discover as scientists across time have always done, continues her work under an increasingly tight net until the inevitable happens and the Christians demand that she, as a woman, must be silent...and she must convert. When she refuses it is only a matter of time until they wreak a terrible vengeance upon her.Because so much of her life is unknown but hinted at, the writers in this movie have much leeway in depicting her life amongst the men who surrounded her as students, admirers or implacable enemies. The addition of the story of her slave, Davus, is compelling and allows them to deal with her death in a more senstive manner than it happened in real life. In real history she was butchered with sharp shells while alive and then hung and burned while still alive directly afterward. And it is an accepted fact that she was, in fact, a virgin and no ones lover. Dedicated to science and learning, she had no interest in purely physical relationships by all accounts. The story of the handkerchief and this attitude is dealt with delicately.I found the acting well done with Rachel Weisz stunning as the mentally absorbed and physically pared down Hypatia. What other reviewers have called wooden in some of the performances are reflective, I think, of the manner and style of the time and suit the scenes and language exceptionally well. The director has allowed others to be a little muted so that those who have the passion to move mobs or minds stand head and shoulders above the rest. Stunning work.The imagery is, in a word, brilliant. The perspective, recreation of Ancient Alexandria and even the turning of the camera to reflect a world turned backward by the wanton destruction of the sum total of it's knowledge is breathtaking.There is also clearly a misunderstanding of her experiments in the movie and one even remarked that this wasn't discovered until Kepler. That is the point. We'll never know what was discovered or codified mathematically by her, her students or even thousands of others who work resided in Alexandria (think of Alexandria as repository of all work done in the universities and research facilities of today and you'll get the idea). It was purposefully destroyed and we entered a dark age that pushed back such discoveries, whether for the first time or rediscoveries of lost knowledge, a thousand years. The experiment on conic shapes and planetary movement was entirely logical given her sphere of work but the movie shows how such knowledge is lost by using a bit of information that is approachable and undestandable to the movie audience. I found it compelling.While Hypatia was a renowned scholar of conic shapes (and this knowledge plays a huge role in the early discovery of planetary movement) and a passionate student of astronomy, there remains no proof that she unraveled the dichotomy between planetary movement and the paradigm of circles. It would be nice to think she had solved such a thing and at least had that before she died.",5,Masterpiece overlooked in the U.S. but shouldn't be missed by you now!,1294704000,"01 11,

1336337,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B003CI2G6S,A. Gavin,"[3, 3]","That this movie got made at all is fairly amazing -- and in a totally different way and polar opposite from the vacuous crap oft spewing out of Hollywood (Hansel & Gretel I'm looking at you!).Agora is set during the tumultuous decades at the end of the 4th and early 5th century AD. It centers around the riots in the Egyptian city of Alexandria between various sects and factions. Between government and mob. Between pragmatists and fundamentalists. Sound familiar? It should. The same sort of thing is occurring today, 1600 years later. The period in the film, known as late antiquity, is an important one, because the order of the modern word was forged in these fires. Yet, most people, including a fair sprinkling of my Ivy League friends, know almost nothing about it. The average American would be lucky to know this is the same Alexandria that hosted the affairs of Cleopatra -- over 400 years earlier. They might not distinguish these sandal wearers from the spear toting Spartans of 300 -- but that battle occurred 900 years before this one! The ancient world is not one moment, but a vast progression of political and social evolution -- all informing our own world.Back to 400 AD and Alexandria. The city was a peculiar and important experiment. Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC on the shores of the Mediterranean at the Nile delta, it was one of the most cosmopolitan in the world, being the poster child for the very idea of Hellenism and the its questioning and philosophic spirit. Perfect, no, but this is the city that housed the Great Library (which desired to obtain a copy of every work written by man) and taught and nurtured 700 years worth of scholars of all faiths. The Hebrew bible was translated here from Aramaic into Greek.Agora is not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does an impressive job of bringing to life the grandeur, sadness, and dust of this ancient place. With superb costumes and by combining grand and detailed sets with judicious CG / Model aerial shots it's one of the best looking depictions of the ancient world I've  seen. It also does a great job with the substance, if not the detail of the history. The central figure is the female philosopher Hypatia, about whom relatively little is known. Her scientific role is a bit extrapolated, but the political situation is fairly faithful. In just a couple of decades Christianity goes from being a minor (and illegal) cult to the one and only state religion of the aging Roman Empire. It is at the hands of men like Saint Cyril of Alexandria (the villain of the film) that established the theological/political principle of religious intolerance that poisons our world today.Prior to this, men of all nations did their fair (and more) share of killing, usually over political and economic objectives. But in the polyglot world of antiquity, variation of belief was usually taken as a given, separate and outside the world of pragmatic gain (which generally took precedence).People constantly ask me (knowing I'm a Roman history buff) ""how did Rome fall?"" Well, when you watch how Cyril maneuvers the liberal Imperial Prefect Orestes you find one of the answers to this complex question. This moment, which appears roughly fairly faithful to historical sources , is about as brilliant a bit of political manipulation as the world has ever witnessed. Cyril, preaching from his pulpit, reads to assembled politicians from the bible, outlining his fundamentalist agenda, and then segueing into a question of faith, forces his opponents -- in front of the mob -- to kneel and declare their faith to the book (held aloft by him!). But what are they kneeling to? The power of God or the ambition of man?Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dream",4,Things haven't changed,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3756,"['movie', 'got', 'made', 'fairly', 'amazing', 'totally', 'different', 'way', 'polar', 'opposite', 'vacuous', 'crap', 'oft', 'spewing', 'Hollywood', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', ""'m"", 'looking', '.Agora', 'set', 'tumultuous', 'decades', 'end', '4th', 'early', '5th', 'century', 'AD', 'riots', 'Egyptian', 'city', 'Alexandria', 'various', 'sects', 'factions', 'Between', 'government', 'mob', 'Between', 'pragmatists', 'fundamentalists', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'should', 'same', 'sort', 'thing', 'occurring', 'today', '1600', 'years', 'later', 'period', 'film', 'known', 'late', 'antiquity', 'important', 'one', 'order', 'modern', 'word', 'was', 'forged', 'fires', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'fair', 'sprinkling', 'Ivy', 'League', 'friends', 'know', 'almost', 'nothing', 'average', 'American', 'would', 'be', 'lucky', 'know', 'same', 'Alexandria', 'hosted', 'affairs', 'Cleopatra', '400', 'years', 'earlier', 'might', 'not', 'distinguish', 'sandal', 'wearers', 'spear', 'toting', 'Spartans', '300', 'battle', 'occurred', '900', 'years', 'one', 'ancient', 'world', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'vast', 'progression', 'political', 'social', 'evolution', 'informing', 'own', 'world.Back', '400', 'AD', 'Alexandria', 'city', 'was', 'peculiar', 'important', 'experiment', 'Founded', 'Alexander', 'Great', '331', 'BC', 'shores', 'Mediterranean', 'Nile', 'delta', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'cosmopolitan', 'world', 'being', 'poster', 'child', 'very', 'idea', 'Hellenism', 'questioning', 'philosophic', 'spirit', 'Perfect', 'city', 'housed', 'Great', 'Library', 'desired', 'obtain', 'copy', 'work', 'written', 'man', 'taught', 'nurtured', '700', 'years', 'scholars', 'faiths', 'Hebrew', 'bible', 'was', 'translated', 'here', 'Aramaic', 'Greek.Agora', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'stretch', 'impressive', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'grandeur', 'sadness', 'dust', 'ancient', 'place', 'superb', 'costumes', 'combining', 'grand', 'detailed', 'sets', 'judicious', 'CG', '/', 'Model', 'aerial', 'shots', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'depictions', 'ancient', 'world', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'substance', 'not', 'detail', 'history', 'central', 'figure', 'female', 'philosopher', 'Hypatia', 'whom', 'relatively', 'little', 'known', 'scientific', 'role', 'bit', 'extrapolated', 'political', 'situation', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'just', 'couple', 'decades', 'Christianity', 'being', 'minor', 'illegal', 'cult', 'one', 'only', 'state', 'religion', 'aging', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'hands', 'men', 'Saint', 'Cyril', 'Alexandria', 'villain', 'film', 'established', 'theological/political', 'principle', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'world', 'today.Prior', 'men', 'nations', 'did', 'fair', 'more', 'share', 'killing', 'usually', 'political', 'economic', 'objectives', 'polyglot', 'world', 'antiquity', 'variation', 'belief', 'was', 'usually', 'taken', 'given', 'separate', 'world', 'pragmatic', 'gain', 'generally', 'took', 'precedence', 'constantly', 'ask', 'knowing', ""'m"", 'Roman', 'history', 'buff', 'how', 'did', 'Rome', 'fall', 'Well', 'when', 'watch', 'how', 'Cyril', 'liberal', 'Imperial', 'Prefect', 'Orestes', 'find', 'one', 'answers', 'complex', 'question', 'moment', 'roughly', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'historical', 'sources', 'as', 'brilliant', 'bit', 'political', 'manipulation', 'world', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Cyril', 'preaching', 'pulpit', 'assembled', 'politicians', 'bible', 'outlining', 'fundamentalist', 'agenda', 'then', 'segueing', 'question', 'faith', 'opponents', 'front', 'mob', 'kneel', 'declare', 'faith', 'book', 'held', 'aloft', 'what', 'are', 'kneeling', 'power', 'God', 'ambition', 'man', 'Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Untimed', 'Darkening', 'Dream']",Agora

Salama,"[2, 4]","There are very few works of fiction that deal with the brief and very interesting period in which the Greco Roman classical world was rapidly and sometimes violently replaced by Christianity: if you ask me quickly I can recall only some of the poems of Constantin Cavafy. Agora, directed by the Spanish Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar (who also cowrote it) tells the real life story of the Alexandrian philosopher Hypatia, one of the last platonic philosophers, who was brutally murdered in 415 at the hand of Christian monks followers of bishop (later Saint) Cyril.Her story has always been almost too neat a metaphor of freedom and scientific inquiry being crushed by obscurantist theology, and as such it has been espoused by writers critical of religion (the first time I heard about Hypatia was when I watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos when I was 12 years old and reportedly director Alejandro Amenabar also first heard about her there).Agora is certainly not subtle, but at least it does not underestimate its audience and is not afraid of being about ideas, refusing to water them down. I read negative comments by some classicists about the movie, and most of their criticisms are really nit picking (like, Roman soldiers are using uniforms of the 1st century instead of the fifth). Other common criticism is in the movie's imagining Hypatia as a precursor of the Keplerian system of planetary movement, but given that a lot of the science and philosophy of this period was lost with the burning of the library of Alexandria, and that geometry and astronomy of that era was quite advanced for the time, this scene doesn't seem such a terrible slip. If you read any biography of Hypatia, it is clear that the movie got the big details about her life (and the ideas she was espousing) right.The acting is generally good: Rachel Weisz is good as the philosopher, but some of the supporting players like Oscar Isaac as Orestes (the prefect of Egypt and a former student and admirer of her that try to protect her) and Sami Samir as Cyril particularly excel.",4,Not subtle but different and intellectually stimulating,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,2057,"['are', 'very', 'few', 'works', 'fiction', 'deal', 'brief', 'very', 'interesting', 'period', 'Greco', 'Roman', 'classical', 'world', 'was', 'rapidly', 'sometimes', 'violently', 'replaced', 'Christianity', 'ask', 'quickly', 'can', 'recall', 'only', 'poems', 'Constantin', 'Cavafy', 'Agora', 'directed', 'Spanish', 'Chilean', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'who', 'also', 'cowrote', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'Alexandrian', 'philosopher', 'Hypatia', 'one', 'last', 'platonic', 'philosophers', 'who', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', '415', 'hand', 'Christian', 'monks', 'followers', 'bishop', 'later', 'Saint', 'Cyril.Her', 'story', 'always', 'been', 'almost', 'too', 'neat', 'metaphor', 'freedom', 'scientific', 'inquiry', 'being', 'crushed', 'obscurantist', 'theology', 'such', 'been', 'espoused', 'writers', 'critical', 'religion', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Hypatia', 'was', 'when', 'watch', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'Cosmos', 'when', 'was', '12', 'years', 'old', 'reportedly', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'also', 'first', 'heard', '.Agora', 'certainly', 'not', 'subtle', 'least', 'not', 'underestimate', 'audience', 'not', 'afraid', 'being', 'ideas', 'refusing', 'water', 'down', 'read', 'negative', 'comments', 'classicists', 'movie', 'most', 'criticisms', 'are', 'really', 'nit', 'picking', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'are', 'using', 'uniforms', '1st', 'century', 'instead', 'fifth', 'Other', 'common', 'criticism', 'movie', 'imagining', 'Hypatia', 'precursor', 'Keplerian', 'system', 'planetary', 'movement', 'given', 'lot', 'science', 'philosophy', 'period', 'was', 'lost', 'burning', 'library', 'Alexandria', 'geometry', 'astronomy', 'era', 'was', 'quite', 'advanced', 'time', 'scene', ""n't"", 'seem', 'such', 'terrible', 'slip', 'read', 'biography', 'Hypatia', 'clear', 'movie', 'got', 'big', 'details', 'life', 'ideas', 'was', 'espousing', 'right.The', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'good', 'philosopher', 'supporting', 'players', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'Orestes', 'prefect', 'Egypt', 'former', 'student', 'admirer', 'try', 'protect', 'Sami', 'Samir', 'Cyril', 'particularly', 'excel']",Agora
1336342,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003CI2G6S,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 14]","`Agora' is one of those films that tries to do so much and yet fails miserably to do much of anything.  It is essentially two stories running perpendicular that are supposed to become interwoven and yet neither story really feels whole and one aspect of the film feels like a poorly conceived side-plot that never gets the attention it deserved, for it was probably the film's more interesting feature.Taking place in Roman occupied Egypt, `Agora' tells the story of religious unrest amongst the turn of Christianity and the displaced values of the pagan populous.  With so many turning to Christianity, the ideals of those with `other' ways of thinking (or believing) become distained and despised, and effectively illegal.  Spanning a breadth of time, `Agora' begins by following a young slave named Davus who has fallen in love with a female philosopher, Hypatia, during the birthing pains of Christianity.  His feelings continue with him, even after he converts to Christianity and violently takes his freedom.  As the years progress, the tension between religious factions grows and soon Hypatia herself is being questioned and condemned despite her prestigious connections.The violence contained within `Agora' is not merely that of a physical nature, but the film's core themes and mood created reek of aggression.  This is one of the film's commendable traits, for it understands the mood it is trying to convey and it does so expertly.  I also loved the production design here, because it was so crisp and so clean, depicting the religious `purity' being toted and yet it always appeared so dirty, so dusty; great way to contrast their values with their actions.But that is about all I have for praise.The astrology aspect of the film could have lent itself in a more eventful manner, but the film tries to be almost too realistic for its own good and it loses any true grandeur.  The religious side of things can become hammy and overly theatrical, and while I understand that that is much the way of these `swords and sandals' epics, there is something about `Agora' that feels so; un-epic.  The acting is hit and miss, with Rachel Weisz delivering one of her most boring performances to date (where is the depth).  She has two scenes where she shines, and both involve a form of violation that attacks her emotions.  Max Minghella gives a standard (expected) performance, but his final scene (thanks to some heavy cinematic manipulations) is very effective.  The real flaws here are seen in the way that director Alejandro Amenabar painted his canvas.  The film just feels so underwhelming.  Amenabar tries to give provocative moments, but most of his directorial flourishes come across unnecessary.  The scroll throwing sequence in particular is a ridiculous use of CGI and takes away from what could have been a signature scene in the film (for the upside down ending shot was surprisingly superb).  Juggling the two focuses was not done well, and the astrology section underperforms and becomes pointless (unless you want to say it was there for authentic merit), a waste of time and essentially takes you out of the film.  Had Amenabar woven in a supernatural currency, then maybe that aspect of the film would have proved substantial, but in the end it is just a wasted focal point.  At times the film feels like a television production (think HBO's `Rome' or something of that nature) and at other times it feels like a halfhearted video game (that upwards glance at Davus's bloodstained sword and the ominous hoodies read video game to a T).It just doesn't come together like it was supposed to and winds up being yet another attempt to capitalize on a genre that ended when Russell Crowe's hand swept the glistening fields of wheat for the very last time.",2,Empty...,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,3775,"['Agora', 'one', 'films', 'tries', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'yet', 'miserably', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'essentially', 'two', 'stories', 'running', 'perpendicular', 'are', 'supposed', 'become', 'interwoven', 'yet', 'story', 'really', 'feels', 'whole', 'one', 'aspect', 'film', 'feels', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'side-plot', 'never', 'attention', 'deserved', 'was', 'probably', 'film', 'more', 'interesting', 'feature.Taking', 'place', 'Roman', 'occupied', 'Egypt', 'Agora', 'story', 'religious', 'unrest', 'turn', 'Christianity', 'displaced', 'values', 'pagan', 'populous', 'so', 'many', 'turning', 'Christianity', 'ideals', 'other', 'ways', 'thinking', 'believing', 'become', 'distained', 'despised', 'effectively', 'illegal', 'Spanning', 'breadth', 'time', 'Agora', 'begins', 'following', 'young', 'slave', 'named', 'Davus', 'who', 'fallen', 'love', 'female', 'philosopher', 'Hypatia', 'birthing', 'pains', 'Christianity', 'feelings', 'continue', 'even', 'Christianity', 'violently', 'freedom', 'years', 'progress', 'tension', 'religious', 'factions', 'grows', 'soon', 'Hypatia', 'being', 'questioned', 'condemned', 'prestigious', 'connections.The', 'violence', 'contained', 'Agora', 'not', 'merely', 'physical', 'nature', 'film', 'core', 'themes', 'mood', 'created', 'reek', 'aggression', 'one', 'film', 'commendable', 'traits', 'mood', 'trying', 'convey', 'so', 'expertly', 'also', 'loved', 'production', 'design', 'here', 'was', 'so', 'crisp', 'so', 'clean', 'depicting', 'religious', 'purity', 'being', 'toted', 'yet', 'always', 'appeared', 'so', 'dirty', 'so', 'dusty', 'great', 'way', 'contrast', 'values', 'actions.But', 'have', 'praise.The', 'astrology', 'aspect', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'lent', 'more', 'eventful', 'manner', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'realistic', 'own', 'good', 'true', 'grandeur', 'religious', 'side', 'things', 'can', 'become', 'hammy', 'overly', 'theatrical', 'understand', 'much', 'way', 'swords', 'sandals', 'epics', 'something', 'Agora', 'so', 'un-epic', 'acting', 'hit', 'miss', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'delivering', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'performances', 'date', 'where', 'depth', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'involve', 'form', 'violation', 'emotions', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'standard', 'expected', 'performance', 'final', 'scene', 'thanks', 'heavy', 'cinematic', 'manipulations', 'very', 'effective', 'real', 'flaws', 'here', 'are', 'seen', 'way', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'painted', 'canvas', 'film', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'underwhelming', 'Amenabar', 'give', 'provocative', 'moments', 'most', 'directorial', 'flourishes', 'come', 'unnecessary', 'scroll', 'throwing', 'sequence', 'particular', 'ridiculous', 'use', 'CGI', 'away', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'signature', 'scene', 'film', 'upside', 'down', 'ending', 'shot', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'superb', 'Juggling', 'two', 'focuses', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'well', 'astrology', 'section', 'underperforms', 'pointless', 'want', 'say', 'was', 'there', 'authentic', 'merit', 'waste', 'time', 'essentially', 'film', 'Had', 'Amenabar', 'woven', 'supernatural', 'currency', 'then', 'maybe', 'aspect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'proved', 'substantial', 'end', 'just', 'wasted', 'focal', 'point', 'times', 'film', 'feels', 'television', 'production', 'think', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'something', 'nature', 'other', 'times', 'halfhearted', 'video', 'game', 'upwards', 'glance', 'Davus', 'bloodstained', 'sword', 'ominous', 'hoodies', 'read', 'video', 'game', 'T', '.It', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'was', 'supposed', 'up', 'being', 'yet', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'genre', 'ended', 'when', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'hand', 'swept', 'glistening', 'fields', 'wheat', 'very', 'last', 'time']",Agora
1336343,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B003CI2G6S,Arch Stanton,"[0, 0]","This is a good movie that could have been great were it not for two major flaws. Since I think there's much of value here I'll focus on what the film did right before getting to what it did wrong.First off, and most obviously, comes the sets and costumes. The sets here are truly amazing. This film's Alexandria is possibly the most realistic portrayal of an ancient city on film. It's run down, populous, and colorful. The costumes are likewise realistic using a much heavier cloth than we're used to seeing in film. When this is combined with some excellent cinematography and visual themes (including a recurring satellite view) it makes for a visually stunning film. I don't know how they did this on such a small budget but it stands proudly as one of the most beautiful historical dramas put to film.The second thing I loved about this movie is simply it's choice of time and subject. The Roman Empire seems to end with the death of Commodus judging from Hollywood productions. It's very nice to see a film that takes place in Rome's final century. The choice of philosophers for a theme is also excellent. Rachel Weisz makes a wonderful Hypatia and the scenes with her working to understand the nature of the universe are the best in the film. In fact, if the film had consisted entirely of this plot line it'd have been simply perfect. The love of knowledge and culture really comes through in a big way. They pay strict attention to what science was known at the time and how it was taught, and although they do have some rather implausible speculation about what she knew it manages to make it seem believable.Now we get to the problems. First and most obvious is the fact that the film is basically several films in one. And you can take that in several ways. To deal with the most obvious example the film tells a complete narrative that ends around the halfway point only to start up again several decades later. You can also see two separate movies within the plot. One half is Hypatia's quest to understand the physical world, the other is based around the rise of Christianity. Both of these plots are intertwined throughout the film but they are never interconnected. The two stories happen in pretty much complete isolation to each other, particularly in the second half. The Christian scenes are boring too and every scene not dealing with Hypatia seems like a distraction. Really, the film needed to pick one of these themes and make them the subtext because they do not combine well together.Secondly the film has some terrible character choices. Hypatia herself is great, her father likewise, and the prefect Orestes alternates between being great and incomprehensible. The real problem comes in the slave character Davus, who is madly in love with Hypatia and so turns to Christianity to get some relief. The slave in love with his master is about as tired a plot as you can get in Roman films and the way they do it doesn't help here. Hypatia's part in it is quite good revealing a sheer indifference that was hidden beneath her earlier compassion, but Davus' part in the story generally feels phony and tacked on. The ending in particular is unspectacular and out of the blue. The Christian characters in general are without nuance or personality except for fanaticism. The only exception to this is her former student who has some positive qualities. In general it is the reduction of all Christian characters to crude stereotypes that is annoying. The various debates of the period have been simplified into religious conflicts with extremely simplified issues. For example the whole issue with Cyrus wasn't about whether pagans could still have a role in the city (they would continue to do so for over a century) but a power struggle between a prefect and a bishop. Whether the changes made are fair or not they make the film uninteresting. While I do get what he's saying about religious fundamentalism he could have done so more interestingly and more subtly if it had been the subtext of the film and not part of a joint focus.I have other minor complaints about the film from a historical angle, such as the fact that Hypatia is presented as secular when in fact she was a pagan, but none of them take away from the fun of it. I just wish that all the Hypatia scenes could be excised from the religious fundamentalist scenes and put into a movie of their own. Honestly, Hypatia isn't even driving the plot in her own film. At no point does she have any influence on outside events.If you're interested in other films from the same period in history there is a miniseries onAttila, amovieon Attila, and a pretty poorpeplumbased on the life of Constantine. There is also the seriesAncient Rome: The Rise and Fall of An Empirewhich has an episode on Constantine and one on the fall of Rome.

1336345,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B003CI2G6S,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[4, 8]","Kudos to Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar and Canal Espana for rescuing an epic story of martyrdom from classical antiquity.  `Agora` is a fast-paced and compelling drama based on the life of ancient Alexandria`s most illustrious citizen, philosopher, scientist, and free-spirit, Hypatia.`Agora` follows Hypatia`s life from her position as lecturer at Alexandra`s colossal library to her tragic martyrdom at the hands of the burgeoning Christian Church.  Hypatia, like Giordano Bruno and Nicolas Copernicus, pursued a life of scientific inquiry and speculation that challenged the religious and political order of the day.  And like Bruno, Hypatia paid the ultimate price for refusing to compromise her intellectual autonomy with the rising religious movement that eventually overwhelmed the classical world, the Christian Church.Amenabar `s initial goal with `Agora` was to create a film about astronomy and one of its greatest students.  In the opening scenes, Hypatia divides her time between teaching Greek philosophy and understanding the movement of the heavens. The film speculates that Hypatia predicted both Copernicus` heliocentric theory and Kepler`s elliptical orbits.Her students range from the smitten dandy Orestes (Oscar Isaac) to the devout Christian, Silius (Rupert Evans).  Ever present is her slave boy, Davus (Max Minghella), equally smitten with her.  Hypatia ignores both and pours her passion into her science.  Her sole companions are her influential father and steadfast dog.Outside the great library, the streets of Alexandria are afoul with the spiritual strife of the day.  Garbed in penitent black, the `Parabalani, ` the Jesuits of the day, spread Paul`s teachings and mock the polyglot mix of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman gods that dominated Alexandria`s religious order.  The newly christened, `Christians` attract the impoverished and disenfranchised of Alexandrian society by offering a sense of self-worth and empowerment.  Soon, the Christians gain in numbers and demand a greater share of Alexandria`s wealth.  They denigrate the ancient gods and anger the city officials who arm the students to attack the Christians.  The students unleash a pogrom and soon the Christians respond in kind as the whole city erupts into civil war.The complex relationship between noblewoman Hypatia and slave Davus is a fascinating one.  On one hand, the film shows Hypatia attempt to mitigate the cruelties and indignities that Davus suffers as a slave.  Yet, the film portrays her (accurately I believe) as a person of her time.  She never questions the right or wrongness of having a slave and treats Davus with both arrogant patronage and doting kindness.  Yet, to consider her intellectually gifted slave her equal is foreign to her.  In response, Davus joins the Christians.  Here again, the film shows the complexity of the issue.  For Davus, the new faith promises him an equality that Hypatia would never have granted.  In one poignant scene, Davus, armed with his new sense of equality, makes known his amorous feelings for Hypatia.  Stunned, she releases him from his servitude.  Yet, the film leaves Hypatia`s motivations unclear.  Was she taken aback because of his advances or because a slave made them?While Davus` unrequited love simmers, so does the city.  Still nominally in control, the Roman authorities pursue a path of compromise and appeasement.  Yet, the writing is on the wall. Day by day, the growing Church gains power.  Street preachers become bishops and the impoverished become soldiers for Christ, this time armed with the sword.  Scapegoats are found, tortured, murdered.  The local Jewish population is terrorized; blood flows, bodies burn and eventually the Jews are banished from the city.  Shocked and horrified by what has happened, Hypatia stands steadfast in her belief that education is the only antidote to such horror.Such naivety bears a cost.  As the Church gains power, it seeks to conform and stamp out any form of possible dissent.  Public baptisms and confessions of allegiance are demanded by all.  Even the Roman Consul is not immune to the new power.  As Constantine goes, so goes the Empire. In one of the film`s most intense moments, Consul Orestes, Hypatia`s ex-student and confidant, is forced to choose loyalties:  his teacher or his Empire.  Orestes` agonizing dilemma and Bishop Silius`oily manipulations are powerful to watch, yet they last but for a second.  Never fully developed, such scenes are soon forgotten as the film marches onwards.Abandonned and betrayed, Hypatia soon realizes that she can remain untouched no longer and that her mere existence as free-thinker and educated woman threaten the male-dominated Church.`Agora`'s final minutes are that of Hypatia`s `passion` and subsequent Golgotha as she bravely endures the Parabalani`s tortures. Her ignoble and horrifying end, which the film mercifully alters somewhat (she was alleged flayed alive) is redeemed by a moving final sequence where Davus, having abandoned his militant new faith, spares his love the worst of indignities.This final scene is worth the whole film.  Rachel Weisz`s performance is both understated and mesmerizing.  Throughout the film, Weisz becomes that great and noble woman who sacrificed herself for the autonomy of the human spirit.  In addition, both Minghella and Isaac give very credible performances.  Yet, `Agora` moves at a quick pace and not without cost.  Scenes worthy of a slower and deeper direction are mowed down in the relentless pace of history.  Rome`s surrender to an increasingly temporal faith is never fully explained.  Consul Orestes kneels before Bishop Silius and next thing you know Orestes is distancing himself from Hypatia and her classical world. Moments of internal conflict are given but cursory treatment.Yet, considering what it aimed to do, `Agora` succeeding admirably. It does a fine job of paying homage to a great thinker and a great woman.  In addition, the film has taken a potentially arid subject, classical history, and has transformed it into something alive and meaningful for our own time.  With its grand setting, attention to historical detail and moments of intense drama, `Agora` gives the viewer a front row seat to the magic and tragedy that was Alexander`s city.",5,Rescued

Marold""","[3, 5]","I really sympathize with those reviewers who said this was the best movie they had ever seen, because it has a lot of exceptional things to say for itself. My problem was that it was unclear what was really important. But first, the good things.The recreation, however much it may have been based on speculation (almost all of the ancient city is under water), the recreation of the city of Alexandria draws you in, with a level of detail I have not seen since the city of Minas Tirith in ""Lord of the Rings."" You can almost feed the grit and the heat of the fires and the decay of old buildings. Even if most of it is done with blue screen and CGI, it must have kept lots of effects artists up for long hours.The historical story (much of which I checked after watching the movie) is more accurate than one may have presumed. All the principal characters, such as Hypatia, Cyril, and Orestes are real, mentioned in the Church History of Socrates Scholasticus. In fact, even the events of the last 20 minutes are described in that history. The further one goes back in history, the more speculative the story becomes. There is a later history which accuses Hypatia of using pagan wiles with music and other devious methods. The movie may use what sound like facts from both, but the tone is from the more moderate Socrates.Aside from Rachel Weisz, none of the actors are well known, except that the French character actor, Michael Lonsdale who has a familiar face from dozens of appearances (the Abbot in ""The Name of the Rose""). All actors, both adult and adolescent versions of the characters, do well. There is nothing to fault there.I hope that people who see the movie realize this is real history (at least there is about two paragraphs of real history on which the story is based.)What might be hard to discern is ""What was the point?"" The title, ""Agora"", a Greek word for what we might call a mini-mall, has nothing to do with the story, except that a lot of action takes place in the streets of Alexandria. Of the three factions, early on, the pagans, then the Jews and the Christians, it is hard to identify any one as the villain, although it seemed the writer / director seemed to be a bit hard on the Christians and bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Why, for example, were the pagans in white, the Jews in brown, and the Christians in black?As I sat through the movie, I could not help thinking that all this exposition must be leading somewhere.

1336351,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B003CI2G6S,brainout,"[5, 13]","This version of the Hypatia story isn't historically accurate in some respects, but it quite accurately displays the horror of Christianity during the 5th century, the legacy of Diocletian, eagerly adopted by the brutal 'catholic' brand of Christian apostasy which, after fighting with other Christians for three centuries, finally got control via Constantine, in the fourth.  It is a very hard movie to watch.  We have a sordid and disgusting history, yet claim as ""Lord"", someone who DIED rather than be brutal to others.  Thus we spit on His Name.The plot is based on history.  Problem is, the movie adds subplots of romance which are not true.  Basically, a pagan woman mathematician and philosopher who defended freedom of faith, ends up brutally raped and murdered by monks.  The movie version does not accurately portray her age when it happens (she was elderly), nor the monks who did it, probably to avoid ratings problems.  But it does nonetheless, in Cecille B. DeMille style, show the crowd frenzy.  Christians, egged on by a maniacal leader, just as much a mob as the one storming in the French or Russian or Chinese revolutions.  Shame on us.Our 'Church Fathers' were absolute JERKS.  And if you read what they write, you'll see that, soon enough.  They whitewashed our evil past, and persecuted anyone who properly wrote about it, with the result that we have NO idea what the Bible really says, or what our history, really was.  This movie, therefore, will likely be denounced by some, thinking it is anti-Christian.  No, it's pro-Christian, for the real Christian would never have engaged in that sordid past.  Some of the subplot elements do show this fact (I don't want to give away any details).  The dilemma of being a Christian yet giving into a crowd ABUSING the Bible, in the name of Christ!  That was our history, and it ought to be admitted.  But it has not been. Since those responsible, laud the disgusting 'church fathers' who were unabashedly apostate, anti-semitic, power-mad and just plain wacko.So all of us Christians need to see this movie.  It captures the time, well.  Constantine and his ilk were pawns of the evil that began in 96AD and has continued ever since.  The production is lavish, in Biblical style, and everyone associated with this movie should get a million dollar reward for the courage to make it.I am a Christian.  I make exegetical videos in Youtube, 'brainouty' channel, showing how Paul predicted this apostasy year by year, starting when Christ would have been age 56, in his meter of Ephesians 1:3-14.

What saddened me the most is that we haven't changed much in 1700 years.  At least Hypatia has finally gotten her due and the Bishop of Alexandria, ""St. Cyril"" his. I wouldn't be surprised if a few Catholic churches dedicated to him don't change their name if this film gets much attention.How can you possibly talk about this film without discussing the history behind it?? I don't think you can because that is its beauty. Its true.  Amenabar recreates the city and the violence that surrounded the Library of Alexandria in the 400's with a broad but honest brush. It was a complex time of religious intolerance born partially of the political manipulations of rulers who were being forced to deal with the social and economic crumbling of the Roman Empire.At this point in time, Christianity had taken on a kind of ""social welfare"" role that was attracting many adherents. Amenabar concentrates more on Christianities philosophical influence which given the level of violence and intolerance, was at best poorly understood by the people. As the Christian segment grows in power, he shows us how the discord between it and the city's Jewish and Pagan factions explode in the form of murderous encounters.We meet the beautiful Hypatia teaching a group of obviously well-off young men as the film opens. When the violence starts she is the voice of logic and peace, but with the exception of the actual sacking of the library, she remains concerned almost solely with her science throughout the film and is an innocent victim of intolerance. Hers is the rational mind with no will to power. It is a mind dedicated to ideals rather than the dogma of any faith. Most of the  dramatic content comes from the struggle of those around her to maintain their honor and loyalty in the face of increasingly deadly threats from the Christian mobs.Her ability to immerse herself in her science is dramatized by her devotion to experiments and breaks from the movie in which the camera pulls out and views the earth from space give us a feel for the scope of her mind. These interludes not only give us an interesting perspective on the difference between her thinking and that of zealots like Cyril, they are also used to provide written historical information about what is about to take place in the next segment.Amenabar keeps us hooked on the action as one side and then the other exacts its revenge. As the movie draws to its end we focus on the inner moral dilemma of Orestes, the Roman civil authority who supported Hypatia and the cities Pagan intellectuals.

1336360,AB34G6VKP28L,B003CI2G6S,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[8, 19]","Hollywood has a long history of misrepresenting historical events -- altering timelines and characters, changing motivations, and injecting an alarming amount of anti-Christian prejudice. Agora is no different, a film that approaches a fascinating historical figure without a shred of respect for what actually happened.The Library of Alexandria holds the most precious philosophical works in the world, and among its many admirers and protectors is the beautiful philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz). A student of progressive thought, an instructor in philosophy and science, and obsessed with circles and their relation to the movement of the earth, Hypatia is much loved by her students and colleagues alike. One of her most ardent admirers is Orestes (Oscar Isaac), who hopes to inspire her to marry him -- but in doing so she would lose her independence and fall beneath his influence, meaning she would be forced to fall silent and no longer teach. Hypatia is convinced he does not love her for her mind as much as for her body and rejects him, not realizing as she does so that her world is about to be torn apart. Christianity has spread throughout Alexandria now that it is no longer illegal and in the wake of slaughtering Christians defacing Pagan statues in the central square, a mob descends upon the great Library with the intention of burning its contents.Caught up in the midst of this religious fervor is Hypatia's slave Davus (Max Minghella), who is also in love with her -- but cannot tell her as much, for it is forbidden and inappropriate. A Pagan who has converted recently to the new faith, Davus abandons her and joins the mob, finding his calling while at the same time questioning the motives of the Christians that surround him. In later years, the violence between the Pagans and Christians and also the Jews will escalate into inescapable pandemonium, resulting in a bloodbath. Where the film succeeds is in the strength of its characters -- each of them are interesting and likable in some sense, even though some make poor decisions. Our heart goes out to Davus when he offers to take a flogging for a female servant who admits to professing the Christian faith. He is not religious then, but becomes more so later on. Hypatia is a spunky heroine and in some sense easy to identify with, both in her yearning to discover truth and her resistance toward submitting to the men around her. Orestes appears at first to be something of a jerk but eventually we discover that his love for her is genuine -- and he risks his life in defending her honor. Another figure, this one first a student and then later a Bishop in the Church, comes across as adhering to the teachings of Christ at least -- compassionate, forgiving, and respectful to Hypatia.On a purely cinematic level this film works in a lot of ways and fails in others -- minor characters are not well developed and many of them look so much alike that for awhile I didn't know who anyone was; the story likewise seems to have no internal focus, since it cannot decide what its story is really about -- or what it wants to say about its characters. It is part romance (that never goes anywhere), part historical fiction (rather than fact), part adventure, and partly a push for science and philosophy while at the same time denouncing religion. Its underlining message is that philosophy unites and inspires whereas faith divides and incites violence. Furthermore, it throws Christians to the forefront of controversy and depicts them poorly, while disregarding the actual historical events. In the film, they intend to burn the library, presumably to put a stop to free thought and philosophy -- in reality, the Library of Alexandria did not exist in that time period; it had fallen into disrepair and been destroyed years earlier. In its place was a Pagan temple that a Christian mob sacked in return for their Churches having been defaced by Pagans.The film paints Hypatia as an atheist or agnostic, her fundamental faith only in philosophy -- in truth, she was a Pagan. It misrepresents her friendship with a Bishop -- implying he abandons and speaks ill of her, when in reality she ceased corresponding with him and never told him why, although he continued to speak highly of her and admire her tremendous mind. It also claims her death was religious, when in fact it had everything to do with politics. The director makes very conscious decisions to imply that Christians of Alexandria were actually comparable to the Nazis.The costumes and acting are without a doubt marvelous, but that it so deliberately maligns the facts in an attempt to misrepresent actual events and place blame where it is unwarranted displeases me very much -- and I am not the only one to be offended by it, as various atheists have also proclaimed their disappointment as well.",2,Misrepresents History,1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,4845,"['Hollywood', 'long', 'history', 'misrepresenting', 'historical', 'events',

The ironic thing was that some of the ""Pagan"" writings were saved by the Christian Church not because they valued the widom and knowledge but because they used them to show how much more enlightened they were and how ignorant and un-enlightend the ""Pagans"" were.  Well at least they saved those great works for a more enlightend time.The most dire and horrifying effect this film has is to show the shadows of our world today.

1336363,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B003CI2G6S,David A. Wend,"[2, 4]","I would have liked to have seen Agora in a theater; but the film played in such a limited number of theaters and for such a short time that it was not possible to see it.  I read about Hypatia some years ago and thought that her story would make a good drama. When I learned about this film, I was excited to see it.Alexandria had a turbulent history under the Romans with the Greeks, Jews and Christians at each other's throats.  The culmination of the violence came when the emperor Theodosius I declared Christianity as the official state religion.  Pagan faiths that had been tolerated before were now subjected the same persecution that the Christians had endured in earlier centuries.(There are minor spoilers in the next two paragraphs)The film opens with a scene where Hypatia is teaching her students about the movement of the planets. This is the focus for Hypatia's teaching although as a neo-Platonist her subjects would have been more diverse.  Orestes, very well played by Oscar Issac, is one of Hypatia's students and openly declares her love for her but is rebuffed by her.  Hypatia class holds Christians and pagans, and she stresses that with her they are all brothers, not members of different religious faiths.Hypatia has an interesting relationship with a slave named Davus (played with sensitivity by Max Minghella).  When Davus declares himself a Christian Hypatia's father (a high official in the cult of Seraphis) punishes Davus. However, Hypatia looks after Davus and presents him to her class when he creates a model of the universe. Symbolically, when the Christian's storm the Seraphium Hypatia frees Davus. The film departs from the facts of Hypatia's life in presenting her death, poetically, at the hands of Davus instead of a mob of Christians. I liked the change for the loving kindness that Hypatia's former slave has for her in order to spare her a painful death.Rachael Weisz succeeds in brining Hypatia to life. She is passionate about her teaching and learning and sticking to her principles as the world she has known is being destroyed. The scenes that come to mind are those where she is with her students and where she puzzles over the precise movements of the planets. Michael Lonsdale is very good as Hypatia's father.Alejandro Amenabar is to be congratulated for this powerful film. The production is very good particularly with the re-creation of the Serapeum. The riot scenes are nicely staged and the costumes very nicely designed with the period in mind. Agora is a film covering a period of time that is rarely portrayed in film.  Hypatia is one of the rare women of antiquity who steps beyond the bounds that men set for women. Being able to see a film celebrating her life is an event in itself.",5,A Powerful Film,1287964800,"10 25, 2010",2010,2748,"['would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Agora', 'theater', 'film', 'played', 'such', 'limited', 'number', 'theaters', 'such', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'see', 'read', 'Hypatia', 'years', 'ago', 'thought', 'story', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'drama', 'When', 'learned', 'film', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'it.Alexandria', 'had', 'turbulent', 'history', 'Romans', 'Greeks', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'other', 'throats', 'culmination', 'violence', 'came', 'when', 'emperor', 'Theodosius', 'declared', 'Christianity', 'official', 'state', 'religion', 'Pagan', 'faiths', 'had', 'been', 'tolerated', 'were', 'now', 'subjected', 'same', 'persecution', 'Christians', 'had', 'endured', 'earlier', 'centuries', 'are', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'next', 'two', 'paragraphs', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Hypatia', 'teaching', 'students', 'movement', 'planets', 'focus', 'Hypatia', 'teaching', 'neo-Platonist', 'her', 'subjects', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'diverse', 'Orestes', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Oscar', 'Issac', 'one', 'Hypatia', 'students', 'openly', 'love', 'rebuffed', 'Hypatia', 'class', 'Christians', 'pagans', 'are', 'brothers', 'not', 'members', 'different', 'religious', 'faiths.Hypatia', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'slave', 'named', 'Davus', 'played', 'sensitivity', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'When', 'Davus', 'Christian', 'Hypatia', 'father', 'high', 'official', 'cult', 'Seraphis', 'Davus', 'However', 'Hypatia', 'Davus', 'class', 'when', 'model', 'universe', 'Symbolically', 'when', 'Christian', 'storm', 'Seraphium', 'Hypatia', 'Davus', 'film', 'departs', 'facts', 'Hypatia', 'life', 'presenting', 'death', 'poetically', 'hands', 'Davus', 'instead', 'mob', 'Christians', 'liked', 'change', 'loving', 'kindness', 'Hypatia', 'former', 'slave', 'order', 'spare', 'painful', 'death.Rachael', 'Weisz', 'brining', 'Hypatia', 'life', 'passionate', 'teaching', 'learning', 'sticking', 'principles', 'world', 'known', 'being', 'destroyed', 'scenes', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'where', 'students', 'where', 'precise', 'movements', 'planets', 'Michael', 'Lonsdale', 'very', 'good', 'Hypatia', 'father.Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'be', 'congratulated', 'powerful', 'film', 'production', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 're-creation', 'Serapeum', 'riot', 'scenes', 'are', 'nicely', 'staged', 'costumes', 'very', 'nicely', 'designed', 'period', 'mind', 'Agora', 'film', 'covering', 'period', 'time', 'rarely', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Hypatia', 'one', 'rare', 'women', 'antiquity', 'who', 'bounds', 'men', 'set', 'women', 'Being', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'celebrating', 'life', 'event']",Agora
1336364,AECVYXIL9791R,B003CI2G6S,David C. Read,"[11, 16]","In the ""making of"" featurette, the writer/director of this film, claims to be interested in telling the story of Hypatia of Alexandria in order to explain astronomical subjects like elliptical orbits.  But he is reportedly an atheist, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that he actually chose his subject to put Christianity in a bad light vis-a-vis paganism.  This is not an easy movie for Christians to watch.  Unfortunately for us Christians, the film tells basically a true history.Especially disturbing is the way Egyptian actor Sammy Samir portrayed Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, as creepily villainous.  Samir's performance will make you hate Cyril, but the harsh reality is that Cyril, now ""Saint Cyril,"" was one of the worst men of his age.  He persecuted the harmless Christian Novation sect, and he persecuted the Jews, destroying their synagogues and exiling 40,000 of them from Alexandria.  He challenged the civil authority of the Roman prefect Orestes.  In one historical incident depicted in the movie, Cyril's Nitrian monk thugs assault the prefect, and despite Orestes' plea that he was a Christian just like them, a monk named Ammonius threw a stone at him, striking him in the head and covering his face with blood.  After Orestes had the man killed, Cyril honored Ammonius as a Christian martyr and renamed him St. Thaumasius the Wonderful.  But this was going to far even for the mobs of Alexandria, and Cyril backpedaled.Mercifully, what ""Saint"" Cyril's Parabalani and Nitrian monks did to Hypatia is not fully depicted in the film.

1336366,A10NM4PC3209XU,B003CI2G6S,Deevah,"[3, 6]","These facts about Hypatia are true: she was a brilliant astronomer, a mathematician, philosopher, scholar, and atheist, who studied the cosmos and charted planetoids, invented the graduated hydrometer, the plane astrolabe, and the hydroscope. We would all have learned about her in school, just as students have been taught about Plato, Socrates, Copernicus, and Kepler, EXCEPT that she was female and relegated to the dustbins of history -- and as a fiercely independent and intellectual woman she became the target of weak and philistine men who feared her influence and genius. And as an uppity woman she became a victim of the hatred towards free thinking and self-governing women that lay at the heart of Middle Eastern-based religions of her time (Islam the only one left that continues to recoil from and revile the notion.) Her death was at the hands of Christians, probably fanatical monks, who intercepted her on the road while returning to Alexandria from a trip, they dragged her to a church, stoned her to death, flayed her with shards of pottery and tile, dragged her carcass through the streets of Alexandria, cut her up, then burned her remains. They also destroyed all her works that they could get their hands on -- it wasnt enough to murder her, she had to be annihilated. What we know today about her, and her fate, is based on letters and memoirs of her contemporaries. This film is fact-based entertainment, after all, and takes liberties with alleged relationships with former students and slaves; and in an era of few or no budgets for grand-scale historical movies with huge casts and lushness of scope, Agora manages to make computer-generated backgrounds, settings, and crowds believable.

1336367,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B003CI2G6S,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 8]","In ""Agora,"" a film depicting the Roman Empire in circa 415 AD, director Alejandro Amenabar presents his audience with screen-filling photo segments of the earth peacefully spinning in the blackness of space to the music of its sphere.  Who would believe that such serenity would reveal, as the camera pans closer and moves through the layers of the earth's atmosphere, a great din of unrest. Cross-wearing mobs have amassed near the Great Library of Alexandria to uphold the Emperor Theodosius's call for the ultimate removal of all things pagan from the face of the Empire he rules.  Turn-the-other-cheek Christians with cudgels and swords will insure the icons of the pagan world fall without but preferably with bloodshed.  As marble statues topple and priceless scrolls of learning burn in a fire inflamed with fear and ignorance, the pagan denizens of the Library realize that the seclusion of their academic lives is forever to change.Most influenced by this is the mathematician, philosopher and cosmologist Hypatia (check out Brian Trent's novel ""Remembering Hypatia: A Novel of Ancient Egypt""), who is willing to forego romantic love and a domestic life for her desire to unravel the unknown--she happily spends her time teaching a philosophy of the brotherhood of learning while extensively pondering the mathematics of the earth's trajectory around the sun.  Unfortunately, her egalitarian ideas of understanding through knowledge and gender equality threaten those politically positioned to grab the reigns of power and plunge the world into a dark age of domination without the light of free thought.Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia with a gravitas that brings to life not only her legendary beauty but, her philosopher's love of the truth. Her eyes gaze at a point only she sees bringing an ethereal aura to the otherwise befuddled academic forever preoccupied with theoretical questions the world of science even today has yet to answer. As she fends off three different suitors from three different factions of the city, Weisz, as Hypatia, does a fine job of giving the role a sense of innocence, urgency and impending doom.  Amenabar and Mateo Gil's script allows her to pontificate her idea of a Republic worthy of that of Plato in speeches that underline the seclusion and otherworldliness of her academic life and yet maintain her credibility with a luminous mixture of serenity and dread.As one of her admirers, the slave Davus (Max Minghella) violently embraces the ascendancy of Christian rule over Alexandria, becoming one of the black-robed `parabolani' who patrol the streets armed with crude weapons, sharp tongues and little mercy for the once aristocratic pagans.  Archbishop Cyril (Sami Samir) wants nothing less than the eradication of all paganism and is willing to preach insurgence.  When he targets Hypatia while sermonizing one of Paul's letters to the Corinthians, former students and rationalists Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the Roman Prefect and Synesius (Rupert Evans) Bishop of Cyrene (this is historically incorrect as Synesius actually was the Bishop of Ptolemais) cringe at what they presage as the unavoidable fate of those who choose not to bend the knee to a faith that is swift in gaining governmental control.In his scenes of chaos where the once underdog Christians (think arena with lions) fight for control, Amenabar speeds up the action, giving the audience a buzzard's eye view of the warring participants who scurry along and cluster like ants fighting for crumbs of food and annihilating anything in sight.  Papyrus scrolls dance through the air in a macabre sacrilege across an oculus framing an otherwise bright blue sky; harsher, darker fabrics, black beards and the gleam of knives reflecting sneering eyes portray marauding Christians as fanatical equalizers extinguishing the lantern of learning. The point?  All fundamentalists, no matter what the religious or political persuasion, halt humanity's understanding of the world in which it lives and is content to seize control at the expense of the overall common good.  Perhaps Amenabar as an acknowledged atheist uses his film to make a statement against religion as one of the opiates anesthetizing the masses while control is seized by an elite corps--but history tells us that despots will use religion, politics, racial supremacy, various interpretations of the rights of man or anything else to get ultimate access to power and materialistic gain.Unfortunately, his depiction of Hypatia as an atheist does not ring true.  As a Neo-Platonist, she most likely sought some Gnostic union with the One.  Like many New Agers that profess gnosis of God through meditation, Hypatia probably reveled in her ability to privatize her knowledge of God and attempted to teach her students her ""path"" to that understanding.  History records that Cyril was jealous of her popularity and if she was advocating knowledge of God without the communal help and guidance of the Church, it is little wonder that Cyril affixed a target to her being.  Amenabar, being fully aware that most audiences love beauty and put it well before age, takes another liberty: at the time of her death, Hypatia would have been nearing sixty rather than the 30-something that Weisz's fresher visage suggests.  Artistic license allows that which aesthetically pleases and that which will further the theme of the medium.  From the same standpoint, Amenabar's version of the destruction of the Serapeum shows the mob burning books to intensify the end of illuminated thinking.  However the actual event in 391 did not actually involve the burning of books as the Serapeum was used primarily as a temple rather than a library.Bottom line?  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Alejandro Amenabar uses his film ""Agora"" to remind us that history does indeed repeat itself with the machinations of the heavy-handed using fear and ignorance to move their cause. Perhaps Amenabar's point as an atheist is that all religion manipulates the masses. Whether it be with a fear of the unknown or unfamiliar or an argument over whose god is better, the fanatical fundamentalist armies championing intolerance destroy progressive thought and stall the overall evolution of mankind in favor of their specific agenda. A stirring musical score by Dario Marianelli thrusts the film towards its grisly conclusion while Rachel Weisz as the philosopher Hypatia quietly spouts rhetoric on the side of the truth and the absolute quest for knowledge. No one in the supporting cast listens and the world goes mad. Recommended with warnings of much violence and a brutal ending.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",4,Agoraphobia: Societal Unrest,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,6655,"['Agora', 'film', 'depicting',

1336370,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B003CI2G6S,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[6, 11]","There is a great deal of background information that the viewer should be aware of &lt; watching this film.  First off, Alexander of Macedon dreamed of an intellectual sanctuary where philosophers / scientists / acadamecians could come together and collaborate on their mutual quests to discover the truth about how the universe operates.  Alexander did not live to see his dream fulfilled, but one of his top generals, Ptolemy, set the groundwork for the tangible manifestation of Alexander's vision:  the library of Alexandria.After the demise of Athens in the Peloponnesian war, Alexandria would become the most cosmopolitan city of the ancient world.  It was a Greek city on Egyptian soil;  the architecture was mostly Greek and the denizens (in the beginning) were Greek as well.  Myriad intellectuals either visited the library or had their works stored at the library (Euclid, Archimedes, Hero, Aristarchus of Samos & Eritosthenes ~ just to name a few).  The entire literary canon of antiquity was stored at the library as well.The concept of the university is a product of the Middle Ages.  While this is an indisputable fact, one could easily argue that the Library of Alexandria was a predecessor to the university.  No less an authority than the late Carl Sagan described the Library as the first scientific institute.  Yes, it was that big of a deal!In 313CE Constantine the Great signed the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity throughout the Roman Empire.  Within a century, Christianity went from a religion known for having its members persecuted to being a religion that routinely persecuted persons who were either areligious or followed other religions.That brings us to the crux of the current film:  the life & times of Hypatia of Alexandria.  She was an astronomer, philosopher, physicist, literary critic and quite simply one of the most remarkable minds of the ancient world.  She lived in the waning days of the Roman Empire, when the early Christians incited a war against science and philosophy.Rachel Weisz is fabulous as Hypatia.  It is said that Hypatia had the form of Aphrodite and the spirit of Plato;  Weisz is credible in her portrayal of Hypatia on both of these fronts.  Weisz takes us by the hand and shows us how Hypatia grappled with issues that would be hammered out by Copernicus, Keppler, Galileo and Einstein > 1,000 years later.Hypatia's story is a tragic one ~ mirrored by the fate of the library of Alexandria itself.  She lived in a time when friction rose between the separation of church and state as well as the animosity between science and religion.  Misogyny also reigned supreme.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[8, 15]","AGORA (which is Greek for ""meeting place"", 2010) reminded me of another period, roughly two centuries later than the setting of this film. It was in the 7th century A.D.: the pope, Martin I, had been arrested and imprisoned by Emperor Constans II of Byzantium. In prison, Pope Martin wrote about the revolting nature of the Christians then living, saying ""even the Barbarians have more Christian spirituality than they.""*** SPOILERS ***This film is about the Roman astronomer/mathematician Hypatia of Egypt, a/k/a Hypatia of Alexandria (Rachel Weisz) and how four weak men condemned her to a torturous death for being a free-minded, intelligent, great teacher. Sound familiar? Well, this thing is not as splashy as TROY, GLADIATOR or even ALEXANDER - but on the other hand it is nearly 100% true. I wager few people saw it or would recognize it at all.By the way, I assume the title refers to the Agora of Alexandria which is what both the school and the museum might have been called. As stated, ""agora"" is Greek for ""meeting place"" or even ""conference building"".It is near the end of the 4th century A.D., Alexandria, Egypt. The Roman scientist and philosopher Hypatia was taught and trained by her father Theon (Michael Lonsdale), who was the Master of the Museum of Alexandria. Their 'faith' was reason, logic and scientific truth - and if she could be said to have been a spiritual figure, she certainly fits the Transcendentalist (Neo-Platonist) mould. In this film, Weisz plays Hypatia as a strong, brilliant professor of astronomy and mathematics.Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the Roman prefect of Alexandria, in the film portrayed as a student of Hypatia's in his youth, was one of the evil-minded men responsible for her assassination. Orestes was like most Romans - a Christian-of-convenience, but he sought Hypatia's counsel often. This comes back to haunt him.The other horrible figure, an outright proto-inquisitor, is Bishop Kyril (St. Cyril, played by Sami Samir). If I may quote a website about great women in history: ""The other key player in Hypatia's demise is the Patriarch Cyril, the Bishop of St. Mark [actually Metropolitan of Alexandria]. He was installed as bishop in October of 412 A.D. It was his mission and his quest to bring Christianity to Alexandria, to rid the city of pagans and Jews. He fought his battle for Christian purity by moving against groups that did not follow his beliefs. Cyril was a power-hungry man, who was later canonized .... ""In the film, Kyril confronts Orestes by reading a passage from St. Paul about the subservience of women. He then condemns Hypatia as a witch. This creates the scene of total evil: Orestes must either force Hypatia to convert, or have her killed as a pagan witch.Here enters a fictitious and unnecessary figure, Bishop Synesius (Rupert Evans), another former pupil of Hypatia's. Working behind the scenes as a sort of passive-aggressive Christian agitator, he corners Orestes (in real life Orestes was cornered by Kyril) and forces him to convert. This makes no sense, as Orestes was a powerful figure like many of the first Roman Christians: secretly pagan, Christian when it suited. I can only guess that Evans needed a job, so they cooked up this silly role for him. Really he's more of a third wheel, and this throws the truth in the film totally off balance.There's yet another silly and rather cock-eyed character: young Davus (the gorgeous Max Minghella), a former slave of Hypatia's. Though deeply in love with her, he somehow simply waltzes out into the street, becomes a frenzied Kyrilian Christian and betrays Hypatia. It is he at the end of the film who murders her, to spare her the torture that the real Hypatia endured.In real life, as far as we know, Hypatia was nabbed during a carriage ride, dragged back into Alexandria, flayed alive then dismembered. They dragged her through the city to great cheering. Her remains - such as they were - were cremated in a great pyre at Kinaron, outside Alexandria, to even more frantic cheers.What puzzles me about films such as this (a ""great historic epic"" type) is why so much goes into it, near perfect history, then it is ruined with stupid things like fictitious characters and silly screen text explaining the history. This film is a muddle and quite confusing for the average viewer. We know they are not in the great library of Alexandria; they mention its destruction. They are in a lyceum and library, presumably the Alexandria Museum ... but ... oh well. Best not to overthink it. The producers didn't!It gives the film what little punch it has: the director follows, more or less, Hypatia's true story. He presents her as a strong albeit flawed character, with a real life and influence. To its credit, there is no gratuitous sex here - a pleasant shock to me - as Hypatia was known for being 'married to her work'.Filmed in Ft. Ricasoli, Malta, with generally good acting and directed by Spanish director Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, this film is a rare focusing, zooming in on a historical period few understand. It shows the late 4th century Egypt, its ugly and brutal Christianization (and the Jews are not painted in a very good light either, nor do they deserve to be).Were it not for the nauseating view of humankind in general, this film is otherwise educational quality. Just try not to eat anything while watching this. Finally, let me say everyone except Hypatia got the stink-eye-treatment in this film, so it cannot be called prejudiced in any direction. Not really knowing a lot about the Alexandrian Jews of the era, the film left them completely out of the picture except as cardboard backdrops.It struck me Hypatia is a representative of something even bigger: the choices to be made by those who are neither Jewish nor Christian. Perhaps not even monotheist. Hypatia represents what is there for us all, religious or not. Hypatia is the steadfast rock for those who long to escape religion. If you do not believe in God, or are a monotheist without religion and without interest, what is left for you? What choices? - HYPATIA! And never forget what the Christians did to her.This is as profound as what was done to the Jews, and no less meaningful or less worthy of our attention.This movie struck me as a call for logic, reason and peace, as an object lesson cogent in today's world especially. It is for the most part the thinker's action film, the historian's epic. Finally, it is a testament to the place women held long ago, and are just now fighting to attain once again.",3,Hypatia Patron Saint of Atheists and the ugly truth about Christianity's

1336377,A3NY38UUNMO810,B003CI2G6S,E.K. Wright,"[5, 6]","I rented this after doing some late night reading which made mention of Hypatia's painful end at the hands of Alexandria's Christian ruler (I believe it was Augustus)I've wanted to see this film ever since the previews years ago but I'm glad I waited until I had some solid historical context from my reading, otherwise this would have been just some sword & sandal drama with ancient guys in robes jews and Christians all going at it. My hat's off the director for taking on such a richly complicated story set in an era most people know little about or do not grasp the significance of. I enjoyed the speed and depth of emotion carved out by different characters and the actors. I particularly enjoyed the quietly powerful and dashing Orestes character, without whom I believe Rachel Wesz's Hypatia would have been less intriguing and flat. some criticisms; I found the music to be a tad repetitive. not sure whether the filmmaker's budget in this area was restrained but the same track of a woman's wailing voice played over and over through so many scenes it became aggravating and cliche. some simple instrumental score or even more modern electronic mixing would have done the film more justice. secondly, I found the portrayal of jews & christians in this film sloppy. I would not go so far as anti-semitic because I think that's too severe. but the older jews who address Orestes could have come off a sketch comedy set. the Christianized jews were no better, with their middle eastern & Israeli accents, these were the most semitic looking of the bunch. it was a tad too caricatured and simplistic for my taste (yes I'm jewish) the 'new' jews vs the 'old' jews. casting and dialogue should have taken a different tone. lastly, the Davus slave character literally had the same mute expression on his face the entire time. I liked his face, I think most people would agree his performance was moving in its own right. but again, from an acting point of view it got tedious to see that sad scowl every time the camera panned over. lastly, the character of Hypatia was a mixed bag for me. I loved the lack of pretense (no makeup, no bulging cleavage or sexist feminine seductive stances) and yet at times the character looked and sounded like a simple schoolgirl. reaching up to the stars while laying on a pillow and confessing she'd never loved. I found this character diminished by the writer & director. her story, stature and role in the film was watered down to say the least. if anything she was a vehicle to summarize the cosmological and philosophical questions of the day, rather than a prominent mathematician and philosopher of great talent and renown who posed a serious threat to the new republic.Although fictionalized, I liked how they filmed her death. in reality she was taken by a group of men, dragged to a church and 'skinned alive' as one of the men in the movie suggests. no naked suffocation by a lifelong friend and would be lover. Hypatia's skin was scraped off bit by bit while she was fully conscious. if anything, the strength of this film is in showing how the roots of Christianity and the transfer of power from one civilization to another was rooted in mob mentality. the teachings of Jesus the healer/prophet vs the religion of his followers hundreds of years later could not have been more different. equating brutality with the word of god and his magnificence made the Christian faith one of brute force and violence, especially towards the jews who presented a constant problem theologically and culturally having been the 'chosen' ones who closely followed the word of god in their own book which far predated Christ. that many if not most were forced and brainwashed into converting, or had to trade spiritual guidance for unethical behavior shows the power hungry nature of this small sect turned world religion. lastly, what it shows so clearly and painfully is the Church's backwater thinking as well as disregard for the rule of law, science and freedom, not to mention its deep hatred of women. of course Hypatia was nothing more than a filthy pagan whore witch. like so many after her she was killed and tortured for holding steadfast to thousands of years worth of human exploration, medicine philosophy and a belief system rooted in the magic of nature and the universe -

Agora is such a movie. I've known about the burning of the Library at Alexandria, but I never considered the events surrounding it. I also never thought about the rise of Christianity once it was no longer under persecution by the Romans.Hypatia (the Rachel Weisz character) was a real historical figure. She taught philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, and tried to figure out the movements of the heavenly bodies. This was happening at a time when the Christians were gaining in their numbers. The differences between the Pagan, Christian and Jewish religions heat up to boiling point. This causes rifts in Hypatia's class, as well as local society in general, to the point where large numbers of people die violent deaths.I don't know how much historical accuracy suffers for the need of a good script here, but it's fascinating to see it all unravel. The prime characters become a cross section of society in general and it's not pretty to watch. Christian viewers beware. This paints Christians of that time as a violent, ugly people. Some of them even wear pouches filled with rocks in case they need to stone someone at a moment's notice. They are shown as having no tolerance. If you are not a Christian, your life is forfeit.This film is good on the eyes. The sets and costumes are great to look at. The performances are very good as well. If there is anything I thought could have been better it's that certain ideas the writer/ director was trying to convey could have been a bit more subtle. A particular scene when, in the craziness of the events, Hypatia's slave comes to see her and begins with his attempting to rape her and ends with his crying on her as though she were his mother was a bit ""too."" But this is a minor quibble. This is a rich movie with a great revealing of what was happening in this time and place.

1336380,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B003CI2G6S,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 4]","""Agora"" has much to recommend it. The recreations of ancient Alexandria, with the camera sweeping past the great lighthouse, are quite magnificent, and the costumes, the details of which have been based upon the Roman-Egyptian Fayum portraits, are equally spectacular. Rachel Weisz portrays a believable Hypatia, the unique philosopher-scientist, who was associated with Alexandria's center of learning, the Great Library, the Temple of Sarapis and its ancillary school of medicine.As one with a profound interest in ancient history but with a complete ignorance of all things mathematical, I found the most fascinating parts of the film to be the explanations (criticised by reviewers more knowledgeable than I) of parabolas and ellipses. It had not occurred to me previously that such geometrical shapes could be sliced out of a cone. I found myself wishing that geometry had been made so interesting when I was forced to struggle through its complexities during high school.The film is heavy-handed with its undeniable message that religious fanaticism engenders the destruction of both humanism and humanity. I found the least interesting parts of the film to be its depiction of the social, political, and religious conflicts, which, because the film is not a documentary, were oversimplified, sometimes to the point of absurdity (The Christian fanatics picking up stones reminded me not of the Taliban but of the zealots in Monty Python's ""Life of Brian;"" I therefore found myself giggling when I should have been horrified). Because of this oversimplification, in which the filmmakers ""tell"" with terse and difficult-to-read white-on-white subtitles instead of ""showing"" with about 20 minutes of expository development, one gets the impression that the turmoil which brought about Hypatia's downfall was sudden, when violent ethnic conflicts in Alexandria had been ongoing since the days of the first-century emperor Claudius. This sense of suddenness was also apparent in the portrayal of Hypatia's ""discoveries,"" which were part of a continuum of intellectualism in connection with the great library (where Eratosthenes, who knew the world was round, had calculated the circumference of the earth). One had no sense that Alexandria had been the hub of the intellectual world for the previous six hundred years.Since the film focuses upon such an extraordinary woman of learning, I can't think why it was not entitled ""Hypatia,"" especially since the word ""Agora"" has little meaning to those unfamiliar with Greek, or Alexandria's history as a Hellenistic city. And Hypatia's history as a respected professor in a man's world is fascinating. Indeed, the part that rang truest for me were the charges of witchcraft brought against her, since the word ""docta"", meaning an educated woman, was synonymous with a female practitioner of witchcraft in the ancient world. Such charges, which were almost impossible to refute, were constantly brought against women of prominence in Ancient Rome.Despite the above reservations, the merits of ""Agora"" outweigh its faults. It is worth watching if only to whet your interest about Hypatia and Alexandria, the multicultural center of learning in the ancient world.",4,An Extraordinary Woman,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",2011,3207,"['Agora', 'much', 'recommend', 'recreations', 'ancient', 'Alexandria', 'camera', 'sweeping', 'great', 'lighthouse', 'are', 'quite', 'magnificent', 'costumes', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'Roman-Egyptian', 'Fayum', 'portraits', 'are', 'equally', 'spectacular', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'believable', 'Hypatia', 'unique', 'philosopher-scientist', 'who', 'was', 'associated', 'Alexandria', 'center', 'learning', 'Great', 'Library', 'Temple', 'Sarapis', 'ancillary', 'school', 'medicine.As', 'one', 'profound', 'interest', 'ancient', 'history', 'complete', 'ignorance', 'things', 'mathematical', 'found', 'most', 'fascinating', 'parts', 'film', 'be', 'explanations', 'criticised', 'reviewers', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'parabolas', 'ellipses', 'had', 'not', 'occurred', 'previously', 'such', 'geometrical', 'shapes', 'could', 'be', 'sliced', 'cone', 'found', 'wishing', 'geometry', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'so', 'interesting', 'when', 'was', 'forced', 'struggle', 'complexities', 'high', 'school.The', 'film', 'heavy-handed', 'undeniable', 'message', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'destruction', 'humanism', 'humanity', 'found', 'least', 'interesting', 'parts', 'film', 'be', 'depiction', 'social', 'political', 'religious', 'conflicts', 'film', 'not', 'documentary', 'were', 'oversimplified', 'sometimes', 'point', 'absurdity', 'Christian', 'fanatics', 'picking', 'up', 'stones', 'reminded', 'not', 'Taliban', 'zealots', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Life', 'Brian', 'therefore', 'found', 'giggling', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'horrified', 'oversimplification', 'filmmakers', 'tell', 'terse', 'difficult-to-read', 'white-on-white', 'subtitles', 'instead', 'showing', '20', 'minutes', 'expository', 'development', 'one', 'impression', 'turmoil', 'brought', 'Hypatia', 'downfall', 'was', 'sudden', 'when', 'violent', 'ethnic', 'conflicts', 'Alexandria', 'had', 'been', 'ongoing', 'days', 'first-century', 'emperor', 'Claudius', 'sense', 'suddenness', 'was', 'also', 'apparent', 'portrayal', 'Hypatia', 'discoveries', 'were', 'part', 'continuum', 'intellectualism', 'connection', 'great', 'library', 'where', 'Eratosthenes', 'who', 'knew', 'world', 'was', 'round', 'had', 'calculated', 'circumference', 'earth', 'One', 'had', 'sense', 'Alexandria', 'had', 'been', 'hub', 'intellectual', 'world', 'previous', 'six', 'hundred', 'years.Since', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'woman', 'learning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'entitled', 'Hypatia', 'especially', 'word', 'Agora', 'little', 'meaning', 'unfamiliar', 'Greek', 'Alexandria', 'history', 'Hellenistic', 'city', 'Hypatia', 'history', 'respected', 'professor', 'man', 'world', 'fascinating', 'Indeed', 'part', 'truest', 'were', 'charges', 'witchcraft', 'brought', 'word', 'docta', 'meaning', 'educated', 'woman', 'was', 'synonymous', 'female', 'practitioner', 'witchcraft', 'ancient', 'world', 'Such', 'charges', 'were', 'almost', 'impossible', 'refute', 'were', 'constantly', 'brought', 'women', 'prominence', 'Ancient', 'Rome.Despite', 'above', 'reservations', 'merits', 'Agora', 'faults', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'whet', 'interest', 'Hypatia', 'Alexandria', 'multicultural', 'center', 'learning', 'ancient', 'world']",Agora

It succeeds on spectacle but stumbles a bit on chronology and script.  Written by Mateo Gil and Writer/Director Chilean born Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar (honored for 'the Sea Inside' with Javier Bardem, 'The Others', 'Open Your Eyes', etc), and populated with a handsome and smart cast, the film succeed on many levels and frustrates on others.Set in Alexandria, Egypt in the year 391AD, Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) teaches her students in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy: her rapt students include Orestes (Oscar David), Theon (Rupert Evans) and Hypatia's loyal and adoring slave Davus (Max Minghella).  Alexandria is in the throes of upheaval as the ancient culture becomes challenged by Christians who gradually gain influence and power in the city, eventually leading to hostilities with the Jews and with women who are not Christians.  By the end of the film Hypatia has remained a scientist and philosopher, concerned about the movement of the planets and the need for unifying all men in a universal brotherhood and is uninfluenced by the current religions and is condemned to being stoned to death, but an act of real love prevents the agony of the end of Hypatia: her benevolent freeing of her slave, the loving Davus, provides an ending that is bearable.The sets and costumes are dramatically beautiful and the moments when the film concentrates on individual character development instead of focusing on fights and brawls it is quite successful.  The long film simply sinks under its own weight despite the radiant Rachel Weisz' performance as the brilliant and enlightened philosopher and astronomer.

Sadly, institutionalized religion's quest for numbers, power and control has not abated and still deceptively couches desires in misdirected terminology and goals.Negatives:(1.) Can't studios find it in their vast budgets to hire appropriate consultants -  in this case teachers and scientists. During Hypatia's time the methods of Socratic discourse and teaching to encourage reasoned thought were well known. Hypatia failed to query her students in order to elicit creative responses to questions; did not encourage return creative questioning; did not redirect or build upon responses...(2.)

The movie demonizes Christians, namely Cyril of Alexandria. The movie makes it seem as if Cyril called Hypatia out by referring to her as a &#34;witch&#34;, conjuring up stories of the salem witch trials in the minds of the viewer. This word would have been completely foreign to the people of Egypt and if Cyril would have been referring to her as a pagan or priestess, well, that was not all that uncommon and certainly would not have incited mob violence against Hypatia, in fact, Cyril was trying to make amends with Orestes who was without a doubt influenced by Hypatia, as Socrates Scholasticus makes clear. The mob violence against Hypatia was due to her influencing Orestes against the Christians.What actually happened was that the jews had Orestes publicly torture and kill Hirax because he was an alleged spy. The jews blamed him and Cyril for the closing of their theater, which caused all sorts of public drunkeness and violence in itself. Cyril, knowing that the people of Alexandria would react swiftly against the jews, personally had the majority of them removed before any massacre could happen, despite what the movie shows, Cyrils intentions were undoubtedly to protect the jews from massacre and yet appease the masses who were tired of being persecuted and plotted against by the jews. For instance, the incident in the movie where the jews lured the Christians to the church to kill them is actually true.It is sad that Cyril is portrayed as some religious fanatic hell bent on murder and destruction, none of which can be proven with valid historical sources, and none of this is seen in his letters. Even when writing to his opponents he shows the utmost respect and love towards them. This movie could have been so much better, however, it is an offense to any student of history, let alone Christians. These are not typical mistakes, which happen sometimes, many of these are blatant falsehoods used to lead the viewer to a specific conclusion. That conclusion? Religion is opposed to science and reason. For instance, there is a part in the movie where the Parabolani are speaking about the earth MUST be flat, this is another blatant lie contrived to make Christians look like backwards simple minded fools.

1336397,A3TIC3BIXX55GW,B003CI2G6S,J. Lundberg,"[0, 0]","Agora is a dramatic depiction of what happened to Hypatia, the highly intelligent non-Christian Greek scholar from Alexandria, Egypt who was considered the first notable woman in mathematics.An agora was an open place of assembly in ancient Greek city-states. This movie focuses on the agora in the area of the Serapeum in Alexandria, Egypt around 391 CE. The Serapeum, as presented in this movie, is incredibly well done. It's as though you were actually stepping back in time to see how it actually looked. The actors, the sets, and the entire production come together well and give the movie an authentic feel. This film truly has the feel of going back into time.By NO MEANS am I stating that the movie ""Agora"" is 100% realistic. I am well aware that this is a typical Hollywood movie and I am also aware that NO movie is going to be 100% historically accurate. That being said, the movie ""Agora"" does get the big picture right and some details wrong. It's a movie. It was made to make money. I know that dramatic liberties were taken and I expect that. But, as long as the general story is told correctly then I don't mind some historical inaccuracies.The Serapeum in Alexandria was destroyed by a Christian crowd in 391. The Serapeum housed part of the Great Library. The Serapeum in Alexandria did house a collection of writings that were a part of the Great Library. Now, the movie ""Agora"" shows Christian mobs destroying the Great Library at Alexandria. This, in truth, was most likely just a smaller housing of writings instead of the actual Great Library. There was a fire near the library in 47 BCE when Julius Caesar and the Roman armies conquered Egypt but there is no evidence that this destroyed the entire library and Caesar certainly never mentioned anything about completely burning down the greatest library in ancient history. A fire in the harbor most likely wouldn't have reached and burned down the entire library.Suetonius, writing around 125 CE, says that the Emperor Domitian (reigning from 81 to 96 CE) used Alexandrian scholars to replace texts from Augustus' library at Palatine after a fire. It is entirely plausible that some portion of the Great Library continued to exist for many years and that there was a sister library of writings located at the Serapeum in Alexandria where the movie ""Agora"" takes place. Regardless of whether or not it was the actual Great Library or just a smaller collection of writings, it is sad to watch. All those philosophical, scientific, mathematical, and other literature destroyed by an ignorant mob who considered anything against their god to be pagan and therefore in need of being destroyed.Hypatia taught philosophy and astronomy. Her contributions to science are reputed to include the charting of celestial bodies and the invention of the hydrometer which is used to determine the relative density and gravity of liquids. In the movie, she is shown with an incessant quest for knowledge concerning the world around her and not accepting any god for an answer. The real Hypatia was not an atheist and she was not a pagan either in the sense of worshipping many different gods. She devoted her entire life to the study of great thinkers such as Aristotle, Plato, Aristarchus, etc. In the movie she is shown as investigating the heliocentric model of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos. This might not have been historically accurate but was most likely used as part of the movie to make it more interesting. There was no evidence that she actually studied the heliocentric model of the solar system. But, the movie does get it right that she was an avid astronomer and she had many students who would come from all over to be taught by her.The movie Agora focuses on Hypatia's final years. Hypatia is played extremely well by actress Rachel Weisz. One thing that must be said is that Rachel Weisz is much too young to have played Hypatia at this stage in her life. In reality, she was around 60 years old. But, Rachel Weisz is much nicer to look at than perhaps a 60 year old actress so I can see why she was chosen to play the part. My favorite two lines from her in this movie are where, at one point, one of her inquisitors says that Hypatia does not believe in anything concerning religion and she states: ""I believe in philosophy. "" Later on when a Christian demands that she must be baptized and that she must consider herself among the Christians, she says to this Christian, ""You don't question what you believe, I must.."" You have to admire this woman for defying the ignorant piety of the times to stand up for what scientific knowledge she had.The movie does a really good job of creating the contentious condition surrounding Orestes and Cryil, who were played brilliantly by the actors in this movie. All the actors in Agora are really talented. Hypatia was believed to have been the reason for the strained relationship between the governor of Alexandria, Orestes and the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril. Orestes and Cyril clashed. Both of these men were Christians but Orestes would allow the support of pagans and Jews. Cyril detested pagans and Jews. Problems occurred when Cyril and the church interfered with the secular authority of Orestes but this is really not developed too deeply in the movie. There are a few different spins on how events developed between Orestes and Cyril in the movie but nothing far fetched at all. In fact, everything appears extremely realistic at all times. History records that Orestes was angered with Cyril for interfering with secular issues and Cryil was angered that Orestes did not accept reconciliatory attempts made by him. There were other issues involving the Jews and pagans as well. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital. This is really not explained well before the Christian mob takes her to be killed.That brings me to the death of Hypatia. There is no denying that she was brutally murdered and that Christians did it. That absolutely remains a black spot on the record of early Christianity. The film Agora presents her death in a lot more subtle manner than what actually transpired. In this film, her former slave does her the honorable duty of suffocating her before the mob gets to her. In actuality, she was stripped naked, brutally sliced up with shards of shell, cut into pieces, and then burned. That would have made for an extremely gruesome scene indeed in this movie. But we get a toned down version. We have accounts on what truly happened to her. This is truly one of the most awful historical atrocities committed by ancient Christians. This woman, Hypatia, was a beautiful scientific mind that was ruthlessly wiped out by the fervent religious ignorance of that time. Socrates Scholasticus writes in the 400s CE;""Some of them therefore, hurried away by a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter, waylaid her returning home, and dragging her from her carriage, they took her to the church called Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her by scraping her skin off with tiles and bits of shell. After tearing her body in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.""Agora is truly a remarkable film that I would highly recommend. It's like stepping back into time and experiencing a piece of history that should not be ignored. Although it is not completely accurate in regards to history (NO film is) it still gets the big picture right in the fact that Hypatia was a brilliant mind, she taught many students in Alexandria, she was believed to be the cause of strained relations between Orestes and Cyril, and she was brutally murdered by Christians in 415 CE. The dark age of ignorance would soon follow this atrocity and would again repeat itself with the likes of Giordano Bruno and Galileo during the Italian (Roman) Inquisition.",4,Excellent

The violins would have come out, minorities would have held tearful candlelit vigils outside movie theatres, the film would have been banned and the director would have been forced into Hollywood exile.As it turns out, the punch went to the solar-plexus of Christianity, which meant a few Catholic feathers were ruffled, and everyone apart from evangelistic atheists and myself fell alseep mid-way through the movie. While it is, of course, unacceptable to denigrate, insult and marginalise any world religion, Christianity inexplicably enjoys exemption from this rule.That's not saying that individuals acting in the name of Christianity have not done some dreadful things - there is no question of this. They destroyed the cultures of meso-America as best they could, they attempted the same in South America, they conducted the inquisition and they burned thousands of innocent women alive at the stake. The list is long and various legitimate films could have been made based on these events.What they dind't do is single-handedly destroy the library at Alexandria. At worst Christians acting under the edict of Theodosius are thought to have destroyed pagan religious artifacts once the library had already been burned down in 48BC and then looted during an attack by the Emperor Aurelian on the city of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.Naturally, you wouldn't realise this watching the movie, which makes it appear as Theodosious single handedly and deliberately destroyed the world's ancient teachings in the name of Christianity. If this type of allegation had been  made against a living person it would have resulted in a fairly meaty libel case, but since Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's adversaries can't speak for themselves by dint of being dead, he gets to grind his axe against Christianity without any interference.The result is that Amenabar gets to:1. Falsely portray the destruction of the literary contents of the library as a Christian act2. Falsely portray the murder of Hypatia as a Christian act (it is only known that she was murdered by a mob)In amongst all this you have a love story that doesn't quite work, lots of hacking people to bits and Hypatia being falsely credited with finding a scientific rational for the heliocentric view of the universe.In other words, what you have is a work of anti-Christian fiction loosely based on historical events and personalities.The film we'll never see is how direct anti-Christian policies in the gloriously atheistic Soviet Union led to some of the worst atrocities in modern history - for instance the boiling alive of the Bishop of Voronezh in a cauldron of boiling tar (just one of the 20 odd million unluckly eggs that were broken in the making of the delectable socialist omelette of the Soviet Union).

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria, ""Agora"" follows the fall of the Pagans as the newly empoweredand growing Christian movement took over. On a political and historical level the film works well, with interestingswipes at the destructive power of religious fanaticism (Pagans, Jews and Christians all have some very badmoments here), and obvious parallels to today, when extremists of various faiths can still be seento be taking making some of the same kind of violent attacks on those they see as wrong or other, as well asdis-empowering women, denying science and distorting scriptures to justify violence or oppression.On a human level the film is a bit more rocky. The story centers on Hypatia, a female teacher, philosopher andscientist who, at least at the start of the film, is given the same level of respect as a great male thinker - somethingthat seems very rare in the world of the film. She is outspoken in preaching brotherhood, and always unbowed in herpursuit of knowledge.Rachel Weisz does good work in the role, but I wish the film hadn't made her so glamorous in look and feel, whichseems like a movie conceit, a bit at odds with the character. More important, the movie feels slowed and weigheddown by the stories of the various men trying to romance Hypatia, in spite of her seeming indifference to romanticentanglements and her almost monk like devotion to knowledge. It's not that these sub- plots are bad, they're justmuch less interesting and more pro forma than the far less familiar historical, scientific and social material and storylines that surround them.Amenebar is without question one of our most talented directors, so when he makes a film that doesn't reach the heightsof ""The Sea Inside"" or ""The Others"" or ""Open Your Eyes"" in can't help but feel a little disappointing.

As to the ungodly scoundrels who perpetrated this horrific crime against a defenseless woman in true cowardly fashion and who by their very actions rejected the timeless teachings of Jesus (especially that part about loving others), couldn't they at least have given up torture and murder during Lent the way later generations of their Lent-observing progeny give up candy and cake?And to anyone who wants a crash course on the differences between the teachings OF Jesus and the teachings ABOUT Jesus, there is always the distant echo of Hypatia's screams to cut through the clouds of chaos as just one of many examples that emerges through the thread of time and the needle of space to remind us how differently Jesus would have reacted to Hypatia and the angry mob compared to the worst of what can happen when the name of Jesus becomes merely an outside thing worn like a fancy logo on a uniform for a local sports team.Whether based on the 77 Urantia Papers devoted exclusively to the unabridged version of Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Jesus or the Bible's Gospel accounts, the Jesus I know would have undoubtedly rescued Hypatia from this dire situation had He been incarnated on the temporal stage of tragedy depicted in this film where all tangible traces of her slaughtered innocence slowly slipped away from her mutilated femininity with the final few breaths that passed across her fading lips into the winter darkness of a silent abyss. How quickly Hypatia would have embraced Jesus and become a true believer had His facial expression of unconditional love been the last image she saw at the very end of her mortal journey.If the eyes are the windows to the Soul, then just imagine how Light from Paradise reflected through the eyes of Jesus could have reduced that crime scene to a tiny speck of cosmic dust.",4,The Distant Echo of Hypatia's Screams,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1997,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'find', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'unjust', 'demise', 'Hypatia', 'hands', 'angry', 'mob', 'Christians', 'took', 'place', 'Lent', '415', 'A.D.', 'ungodly', 'scoundrels', 'who', 'perpetrated', 'horrific', 'crime', 'defenseless', 'woman', 'true', 'cowardly', 'fashion', 'who', 'very', 'actions', 'rejected', 'timeless', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'especially', 'part', 'loving', 'others', 'could', ""n't"", 'least', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'torture', 'murder', 'Lent', 'way', 'later', 'generations', 'Lent-observing', 'progeny', 'give', 'up', 'candy', 'cake', 'anyone', 'who', 'crash', 'course', 'differences', 'teachings', 'OF', 'Jesus', 'teachings', 'ABOUT', 'Jesus', 'always', 'distant', 'echo', 'Hypatia', 'screams', 'cut', 'clouds', 'chaos', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'examples', 'thread', 'time', 'needle', 'space', 'remind', 'how', 'differently', 'Jesus', 'would', 'have', 'reacted', 'Hypatia', 'angry', 'mob', 'compared', 'worst', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'name', 'Jesus', 'merely', 'outside', 'thing', 'worn', 'fancy', 'logo', 'uniform', 'local', 'sports', 'team.Whether', 'based', '77', 'Urantia', 'Papers', 'devoted', 'exclusively', 'unabridged', 'version', 'Everything', 'Always', 'Wanted', 'Know', 'Jesus', 'Bible', 'Gospel', 'accounts', 'Jesus', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'undoubtedly', 'rescued', 'Hypatia', 'dire', 'situation', 'had', 'been', 'incarnated', 'temporal', 'stage', 'tragedy', 'depicted', 'film', 'where', 'tangible', 'traces', 'slaughtered', 'innocence', 'slowly', 'slipped', 'away', 'mutilated', 'femininity', 'final', 'few', 'breaths', 'passed', 'fading', 'lips', 'winter', 'darkness', 'silent', 'abyss', 'How', 'quickly', 'Hypatia', 'would', 'have', 'embraced', 'Jesus', 'become', 'true', 'believer', 'had', 'facial', 'expression', 'unconditional', 'love', 'been', 'last', 'image', 'saw', 'very', 'end', 'mortal', 'journey.If', 'eyes', 'are', 'windows', 'Soul', 'then', 'just', 'imagine', 'how', 'Light', 'Paradise', 'reflected', 'eyes', 'Jesus', 'could', 'have', 'reduced', 'crime', 'scene', 'tiny', 'speck', 'cosmic', 'dust']",Agora

Is it the question itself, or the questioner, who offends in asking?  These are some of the issues presented in ""Agora"", the compelling film by Alejandro Amenabar starring Rachel Weisz.The film presents the fascinating life of the Roman philosopher/mathematician/scientist Hypatia, a neo-Platonist philosopher of 4th century Alexandria.  Very little is known of her scientific or philosophical discoveries, as none of her writings survived the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity.  What we do know of her comes from other writers of the period, who tell us she was widely regarded as the bright jewel of the empire for her wisdom, virtue and brilliant erudition.  The broader outlines of her life are known, as are the larger historical and cultural context in which she lived.As the film opens, Hypatia is laboring to develop a theory that explains the orbits of the planets in contradiction to the accepted Ptolemaic model of the time.  Amenabar and his writer take a few artistic liberties in his presentation, as he imagines Hypatia's train of thought along these lines in the absence of any documentary evidence.  We just don't know if this was in fact the case. But never mind that, as Art is well served here.Do the planets travel around the earth, or the sun?  Hypatia struggles relentlessly with this question against the backdrop of abrupt and shocking changes in Roman culture.  The early Christians have gained a political foothold with imperial favor, and begin to challenge the Pagans and Jews in the provincial capital.  The confrontations become violent.  As the Christians gain power, they repress any differences of belief and insist on agreement with their faith, often at the point of a sword.  Fascinated with this emerging model of the universe, Hypatia persists in her inquiries in the face of growing danger.Amenabar has created a very convincing Alexandria.  The sets and costumes are wonderful, and the writing is quick and idiomatic.  Rachel Weisz gives another stand-out performance as a genius completely taken up with the creative process of thought.  Weisz's Hypatia is a woman of great perspicacity, intellectual honesty, personal warmth and moral courage.  She gives us the convincing internal struggle with a Really Big Idea, a feat of acting that requires great artistic restraint.  She succeeds admirably.  Hypatia's simple scientific experiments are mesmerizing and charged with drama.  Her intellectual struggles are at the same time rigorous and intuitive, deeply moving, yet not cold or distant. She cares about the people around her as much as her Really Big Idea.  The rest of the cast performs at the same superb level.Much has been said elsewhere about the romantic interests in the film.  Fortunately, these are entirely secondary to the larger contrasts of the emerging cosmological model and the ultimate closing of the Roman mind.  And it is highly refreshing to see a plot driven by a conflict other than the typical Hollywood-formula ""love interest"".In life, we know that Hypatia died a martyr to her beliefs.  We also know that this moment in European history marked the beginning of the end of the free-thinking philosophy peculiar to Classical, Hellenistic culture.  Which makes Hypatia's problems quite contemporary, as people everywhere face the same challenge today.  Is it good or right to question?  If history is any judge then it certainly is, because that is the only way one will arrive at the truth.",5,"A Really Big Idea, at the End of the Golden Age of Reason",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,3518,"['right', 'question', 'proper', 'doubt', 'question', 'questioner', 'who', 'asking', 'are', 'issues', 'presented', 'Agora', 'compelling', 'film', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'starring', 'Rachel', 'Weisz.The', 'film', 'fascinating', 'life', 'Roman', 'philosopher/mathematician/scientist', 'Hypatia', 'neo-Platonist', 'philosopher', '4th', 'century', 'Alexandria', 'Very', 'little', 'known', 'scientific', 'philosophical', 'discoveries', 'none', 'writings', 'survived', 'fall', 'Rome', 'rise', 'Christianity', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'other', 'writers', 'period', 'who', 'tell', 'was', 'widely', 'regarded', 'bright', 'jewel', 'empire', 'wisdom', 'virtue', 'brilliant', 'erudition', 'broader', 'outlines', 'life', 'are', 'known', 'are', 'larger', 'historical', 'cultural', 'context', 'lived.As', 'film', 'Hypatia', 'laboring', 'develop', 'theory', 'orbits', 'planets', 'contradiction', 'accepted', 'Ptolemaic', 'model', 'time', 'Amenabar', 'writer', 'take', 'few', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'presentation', 'Hypatia', 'train', 'thought', 'lines', 'absence', 'documentary', 'evidence', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'fact', 'case', 'never', 'mind', 'that', 'Art', 'well', 'served', 'planets', 'travel', 'earth', 'sun', 'Hypatia', 'relentlessly', 'question', 'backdrop', 'abrupt', 'shocking', 'changes', 'Roman', 'culture', 'early', 'Christians', 'have', 'gained', 'political', 'foothold', 'imperial', 'favor', 'begin', 'challenge', 'Pagans', 'Jews', 'provincial', 'capital', 'confrontations', 'become', 'violent', 'Christians', 'gain', 'power', 'repress', 'differences', 'belief', 'insist', 'agreement', 'faith', 'often', 'point', 'sword', 'Fascinated', 'emerging', 'model', 'universe', 'Hypatia', 'inquiries', 'face', 'growing', 'danger.Amenabar', 'created', 'very', 'convincing', 'Alexandria', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'quick', 'idiomatic', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'genius', 'completely', 'taken', 'up', 'creative', 'process', 'thought', 'Weisz', 'Hypatia', 'woman', 'great', 'perspicacity', 'intellectual', 'honesty', 'personal', 'warmth', 'moral', 'courage', 'convincing', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Really', 'Big', 'Idea', 'feat', 'acting', 'great', 'artistic', 'restraint', 'admirably', 'Hypatia', 'simple', 'scientific', 'experiments', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'charged', 'drama', 'intellectual', 'struggles', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'rigorous', 'intuitive', 'deeply', 'moving', 'yet', 'not', 'cold', 'distant', 'people', 'around', 'as', 'much', 'Really', 'Big', 'Idea', 'rest', 'cast', 'performs', 'same', 'superb', 'level.Much', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'romantic', 'interests', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'are', 'entirely', 'secondary', 'larger', 'contrasts', 'emerging', 'cosmological', 'model', 'ultimate', 'closing', 'Roman', 'mind', 'highly', 'refreshing', 'see', 'plot', 'driven', 'conflict', 'other', 'typical', 'Hollywood-formula', 'love', 'interest', '.In', 'life', 'know', 'Hypatia', 'died', 'martyr', 'beliefs', 'also', 'know', 'moment', 'European', 'history', 'marked', 'beginning', 'end', 'free-thinking', 'philosophy', 'peculiar', 'Classical', 'Hellenistic', 'culture', 'Which', 'Hypatia', 'problems', 'quite', 'contemporary', 'people', 'everywhere', 'face', 'same', 'challenge', 'today', 'good', 'right', 'question', 'history', 'judge', 'then', 'certainly', 'only', 'way', 'one', 'will', 'arrive', 'truth']",Agora

This is not an action film by any means, but it does highlight a very important era in history, especially in women's history.  Hypatia, female--the worst thing to be in that world at that time, had an indulgent father who educated her.  She led a free life, did not marry and thus was not protected.  She was a wise woman in a time when women did not exist but to bear young but her freedom disturbed the male society, and her religious inclinations, if they were anything, were based in the pagan religion at a time when Christianity was struggling against the pagan world to gain power and hegemony.  Too often the Christians were led by zealots and, of course, early Christians, much like too many religions today, are not wonderfully happy when a woman shows strength, courage, and exercizes power.

1336415,A22R1X2P28BFCV,B003CI2G6S,Mark K. Rempel,"[1, 1]","This is a Spanish made film, filmed in Malta, with a chiefly English cast. I saw the R rated version, there apparently exists a PG version. A tense film, in which the Christian no-nothings thugs are compared to the Taliban. It is the end of civilization and the beginning of the Dark Ages. Hypatia was apparently too much of an intellectual and too unworldly to see when she was in danger, even when politically powerful Christians were willing to defend her against the evil St. Cyril. The film is repeatedly anti-Christian. First they persecute the pagans, then the Jews, then Hypatia the philosopher. There is no universal unconditional brotherly love among these terrorists. No doubt they eventually killed every intellectual in Alexandria. The problem with this film is it does not show the pagans fighting back. The home Roman Government by that time had become Christian, so the emperor decreed the Christians be allowed to enter the library -- a crime against civilization as the Christians destroyed everything, much like the Nazis destroyed everything in Germany that they didn't like. I wonder what did the emperor think would happen? This is never shown in the film. What was the emperor thinking? The mob became the rulers and persecuted anyone who did not think precisely like they did. They made everyone as stupid as sheep-- for a thousand years  and more. Somewhat like Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution -- pull all the intellectuals down to the level of peasants.Some of the Christians were a puzzle. Davus, the former slave, was obviously a brilliant man, what with his model of the solar system, but he smashes it when he becomes a Christian and anger at Hypatia rejecting his amorous advances. He joins the anti-intellectual mob and rejects science. Also, Orestes, the Prefect, who later became a Christian, did not challenge Cyril when he had the power to arrest him--he lacked the courage to do so. Also Orestes did not aggressively defend Hypatia enough. He was in a position to protect her, but failed. I see that as major flaw in the script.  He could have challenged the sexism in the scriptures (Cyril quotes Timothy about how women should be silent), but he is forbidden to do so by the Bishop of Cyrene, who insisted that what Cyril was voice of God, even though it is well-known that the bible contradicts itself on many levels. St. Paul viciously hated women, as did St, Ambrose, St. Timothy, and many others. The Bible is terribly sexist, this also is well-known.Cyril calls Hypatia a whore and witch, when its seems Hypatia had zero interest in having sex with anybody. She was obsessed with science, astronomy, philosophy--no time for sex. So Cyril calling her a whore is a deliberate lie and slander. He simply found the idea of a female intellectual revolting. The misogyny of Christianity is perversive and how could any woman call themselves a Christian is beyond me. It is all absurd.And of course priests have used Scripture to justify any atrocity, abomination, obscenity, perpetuated by the infallible Christians as the word of God. The primitive Christians were illiterate peasants, often slaves, with no culture, comparable to today's Taliban. This makes sense. The original Christians were fanatics among the poorest of the poor. They could comprehend the richness and color of the pagans, which they saw as decadent, so they destroyed what was foreign, alien, upper class, pagan. Oh, my! Yet for all that by 391 A.D. when this takes place many well-educated persons were Christians and were continually fighting among each other, creating numerous schisms and accusing each other as heretics. Thus invalidating any worth the Christian theology ever had.Hypatia was portrayed as a peacemaker and a detached intellectual obsessed with the solar system even when Alexandria was falling into Christain tyranny. St. Cyril, like many Christians in power, suppressed factions he did not like. He closed churches he declared heretical, and was opposed to the Nestorians, the Arians, and other schismatics. He railed against Julian, the last pagan Roman emperor, a virtuous man according to Edward Gibbon. Cyril was interested in power, conformity, dogma, and made those under him obeyed. In short, a rotten excuse for a Christian. Christianity became powerful through brute force, not from its codes, morality, theology, or being nice. A cult of no-nothing peasants willfully destroyed the intellectuals.The destruction of the library of Alexandria is well-known to students of history, but not to the general public. The general public are only fed propaganda that somehow Christianity is benign and enlightened, when it is the opposite. The destruction of the library in the film is the most upsetting part, as it is a horror cast upon knowledge and wisdom thrust on by the no-nothing Christians.  Christianity here is ignorance, violence, run by terrorists.The film is beautifully photographed though much is actually computer generated images; also it has impressive gigantic sets. The film on the whole is marvelous and breathtaking. It is a violent drama of the war between science and religion, a war that will never end until religion is erased from the Earth -- then we shall have peace.",5,"Tense drama, with Christians shown as

1336416,AEBKXHNYQ17GK,B003CI2G6S,"Meme ""Meme""","[15, 46]","Agora was the marketplace in Alexandria where religious debates took place.  Agora, the movie, is a fallacy.Alejandro Amenabar's portrayal of Christians as a hysterical, filthy, violent crowd of disheveled animals is not surprising since the overwhelming majority of film-makers and novel-writers are either atheists or leftists. His choice of Miss Weisz was a bad one: at the time the story takes place, Hypathia would be on her 50's. The main argument of the movie seems to be that Cyril (the Christian Patriarch of Alexandria) declared Hypatia to be a witch, therefore inciting Christian zealots to murder her. She is portrayed desperately gathering scrolls from the library before the hysterical Christian mob can get to it, and nobly dies, defending reason and science against the ignoramus Christians! Yes, Cyril's uncle (Theophilus) destroyed pagan statues in the pagan temple area of Alexandria, but it was Julius Caesar who it seems accidentally burned down the library. Some sources believe Muslim conquerors in the seventh century A.D. are the responsible party. Accounts of that day, both Christian and pagan, so much as hint at the destruction of any large collection of books. Not even the pagan Eunapius of Sardis (who despised Christians) ever suggested such a thing happened. And pagan historian Ammianus Marcellinus, describing the Serapeum not long before its demolition, spoke of its libraries as no longer in existence.Amenabar's film has an arresting resemblance to Carl Sagan's TV program ""Cosmos"" (""The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria""), where Hypatia is shown as a scientist and philosopher who became a victim of the wicked Cyril. According to Sagan ""the supreme tragedy was that when the Christians came to burn down the great library of Alexandria, there was no one to stop them."" Sagan based his account upon Edward Gibbon's anti-Christian ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."" Gibbon (who misread a sentence from the Christian historian Orosius) was the first to link Hypatia's murder with the burning of the Alexandrian library. Yet, there is no evidence connecting Hypatia to any library in Alexandria at all. The Sarapeum was sacked by angry Christians in her time, as a result to pagan defilements of Christian houses of worship.In Socrates Scholasticus' Historia Ecclesiastica there is an interesting description of the destruction of the Serapeum temple complex: ""The pagans of Alexandria, and especially the professors of philosophy, were unable to repress their rage at this exposure, and exceeded in revengeful ferocity their outrages on a former occasion: for with one accord, at a preconcerted signal, they rushed impetuously upon the Christians, and murdered every one they could lay hands on. The Christians also made an attempt to resist the assailants, and so the mischief was the more augmented. This desperate affray was prolonged until satiety of bloodshed put an end to it. Then it was discovered that very few of the heathens had been killed, but a great number of Christians; while the number of wounded on each side was almost innumerable.""  It seems Hypatia was caught in the struggle between Orestes (the civil authority) and Cyril (the bishop), and was killed in retaliation for the murder of some of Cyril's supporters by agents of Orestes (it seems by the ""parabalani,"" a fraternity originally founded to care for Alexandria's poor).The film portrays Hypatia as an astronomer (clearly in order to draw comparison with Galileo), but she was best known as a follower of Plato and Plotinus. There were Christians in Hypatia's classes, Christian bishops among her circle of friends, Christian theologians--like Augustine, Ambrose, and Origen--enthusiastic advocates of neo-Platonism. (One of her most ardent students, Bishop Synesius, wrote several letters to her, calling her ""mother, sister, teacher, and withal benefactress, and whatsoever is honored in name and deed."") So her portrayal as the noble champion of reason against a bunch of disheveled half-crazed Christian is more than ridiculous: it is insidious! (Incidentally, she was not the inventor of either the astrolabe or the hydrometer. The hydrometer was mentioned in a letter to her by her friend Synesius of Cyrene, where he explained how the device was made, so she could arrange to have one built for him!)But Mr. Amenabar's tricks are also aesthetic. In one scene the camera is on a high point of vantage overlooking the Alexandria library while vandalized by the Christian mob: it is clearly intentional that it makes the Christians look like cockroaches. (Incidentally, and according to historical records, the Jews also took part in the fighting that often occurred among the religious factions in Alexandria.) Another even more perverse scene shows a group of scruffy Christians carting away bodies of Jews they had just killed, a clear parallel to the bodies of the Jews seen in photographs of concentration camps. Had Mel Gibson made a movie depicting muslims the way this movie depicts Christians, he would not have long to live! Yes, Cyril was a harsh ruler; he did expel the Jews from Alexandria against the wishes of Orestes; but there is no concrete evidence that he led a murderous crusade against the Jews nor that he had a role in the murder of Hypatia. It seems her murder was instigated by Peter, a minor layman in Cyril's church. Apparently, Peter and his followers believed Hypatia was somehow preventing Orestes and Cyril's reconciling. And Socratis Scholasticus condemns the deed: ""This affair brought not the least opprobrium, not only upon Cyril, but also upon the whole Alexandrian church. And surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort."" (It reminds me of a certain religion that actually encourages ""massacres""!) Finally, the movie portrays Christians as being opposed to scientific investigations, as if only atheists--or pagans--honored science!To the ones who believe this is an accurate portrayal of that time, here is an article with an in-depth study of the movie's inaccuracies, based on historical material: [...]. And if you are interested in History, I suggest you read ""A History of Christianity"" by respected historian Paul Johnson, and David B. Hart's ""Atheist Delusions""--because the real story of Hypatia will never, ever be made into a movie!",1,"Christian bashing galore (or ""License to Lie!"")",1352678400,"11 12,

Fine performances by all but Rachel Weiss stands as tall as the great lighthouse of Alexandria in a nuanced, deeply felt performance as Hypatia. the screenplay too is a star here and shows great insight and an unbiased look at religious intolerance by the three religious groups in Alexandria at the end of the Roman Empire.The realization of a gorgeous if slightly faded Alexandria is stunningly achieved in this film. Bringing to mind and even surpassing the sets of Joseph L Mankiewicz' 1963 'Cleopatra'. This city that stood as a beacon of learning, art, architecture and wonders seems to breath and move as if sixteen centuries were blown away by a magical wind from the desert.The film will raise a lot of questions in the minds of viewers who may have very fundamental beliefs in Judaism or Christianity and could be construed by the less astute as anti Christian. It is not. the film simply shows true events of the clash of belief at the end of the classical age. Many were guilty of barbarism in the name of their gods then, just as some are today.Finally the tragic end of the film is heart rending for not only the obvious reasons but for the fact that had men been more enlightened towards the wonders of the minds and brilliance of women we might be a lot further along in our evolution as a species than we are today.",5,ALEXANDRIA REBORN,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,1412,"['brilliant', 'beautiful', 'film', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'move', 'viewer', 'Fine', 'performances', 'Rachel', 'Weiss', 'as', 'tall', 'great', 'lighthouse', 'Alexandria', 'nuanced', 'deeply', 'felt', 'performance', 'Hypatia', 'screenplay', 'too', 'star', 'here', 'great', 'insight', 'unbiased', 'look', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'three', 'religious', 'groups', 'Alexandria', 'end', 'Roman', 'Empire.The', 'realization', 'gorgeous', 'slightly', 'faded', 'Alexandria', 'stunningly', 'achieved', 'film', 'Bringing', 'mind', 'even', 'surpassing', 'sets', 'Joseph', 'L', 'Mankiewicz', '1963', ""'Cleopatra"", 'city', 'stood', 'beacon', 'learning', 'art', 'architecture', 'wonders', 'breath', 'move', 'sixteen', 'centuries', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'magical', 'wind', 'desert.The', 'film', 'will', 'raise', 'lot', 'questions', 'minds', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'very', 'fundamental', 'beliefs', 'Judaism', 'Christianity', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'less', 'astute', 'anti', 'Christian', 'not', 'film', 'simply', 'true', 'events', 'clash', 'belief', 'end', 'classical', 'age', 'Many', 'were', 'guilty', 'barbarism', 'name', 'gods', 'then', 'just', 'are', 'today.Finally', 'tragic', 'end', 'film', 'heart', 'rending', 'not', 'only', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'fact', 'had', 'men', 'been', 'more', 'enlightened', 'wonders', 'minds', 'brilliance', 'women', 'might', 'be', 'lot', 'further', 'along', 'evolution', 'species', 'are', 'today']",Agora
1336418,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003CI2G6S,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 4]","Agora is a sweeping epic covering the fall of Alexandria and all it represents: religious freedom, women's rights, and critical thinking. At two hours long, it's an intriguing take on a pivotal moment in history that says as much about our modern society as it does about the past.The film starts out with a God's-eye view of the world, slowly zooming in until we see it's 391 AD.  Greek Philosopher Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, revealing her full acting range here) teaches the future leaders of Rome at the Platonic school of Alexandria. Her father is the tolerant Theon (Michael Lonsdale) and director of the Musaeum of Alexandria. A love triangle of sorts swirls around Hypatia: Theon's slave Davus (Max Minghella) whom she could never love due to his social status and one of her pupils Orestes (Oscar Isaac) whom she doesn't love because of his inevitable dominance as her husband. This delicate balance of learning and freedom is not to last.Christianity is on the rise in Rome and the Library of the Serapeum becomes a symbolic representation of all things pagan. When a conflict over the worship of the gods turns violent, a full-blown riot causes the pagans to retreat to the Library.  The Christian Emperor eventually settles the conflict by allowing the pagans to escape with their lives, leaving the library to the Christians. End of Act One.Act Two picks up years later.  Many of Hypatia's students have gone on to become leaders of Rome. Orestes, still in love with her, is a prefect of Alexandria. Synesius (Rupert Evans), another former pupil, is now the Bishop of Cyrene. Davus has been freed and joined the Christians extremists. Hypatia has been toiling diligently away at developing a heliocentric model of the solar system and elliptical orbits of the planets. But the Christian leader Cyril (Sami Samir) is not content with just expelling the pagans.  The Jews are at risk too, and it's not long before a similar conflict erupts in the streets.It's clear the Christians are ascending in power, leaving civil authorities at risk of losing their secular objectivity.  Cyril uses Orestes' affection for Hypatia to attack his authority.  If Hypatia will not convert, the Christian mobs will kill her; if she does convert to Christianity, Cyril's authority over the city is complete. Orestes refuses to force the issue publicly but pleads with her in private to convert.  For those viewers who know their history, Hypatia is already doomed.  It is just a question of who will stand by her in the end.Agora occasionally reaches to connect with a modern audience beyond what history has told us - director Alejandro Amenabar heaps scientific theories in her lap so that we can understand just how much was lost. The inverted roles of fanatical extremism and the literal interpretation of scriptures is likely to be a sore point with some, but Agora makes a compelling case: Hypatia WAS killed by a Christian mob for being a witch.Unfortunately the film drags as it slowly unspools an inevitable downward spiral of learning, freedom, and human decency. As a history lesson it's thought-provoking and more than a little controversial.  As a film, it's about twenty minutes too long.",4,Who weeps for Hypatia?,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,3190,"['Agora', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'covering', 'fall', 'Alexandria', 'religious', 'freedom', 'women', 'rights', 'critical', 'thinking', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'intriguing', 'take', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'history', 'as', 'much', 'modern', 'society', 'past.The', 'film', 'out', ""God's-eye"", 'view', 'world', 'slowly', 'zooming', 'see', '391', 'AD', 'Greek', 'Philosopher', 'Hypatia', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'revealing', 'full', 'acting', 'range', 'here', 'future', 'leaders', 'Rome', 'Platonic', 'school', 'Alexandria', 'father', 'tolerant', 'Theon', 'Michael', 'Lonsdale', 'director', 'Musaeum', 'Alexandria', 'love', 'triangle', 'sorts', 'swirls', 'Hypatia', 'Theon', 'slave', 'Davus', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'whom', 'could', 'never', 'love', 'due', 'social', 'status', 'one', 'pupils', 'Orestes', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'whom', ""n't"", 'love', 'inevitable', 'dominance', 'husband', 'delicate', 'balance', 'learning', 'freedom', 'not', 'last.Christianity', 'rise', 'Rome', 'Library', 'Serapeum', 'symbolic', 'representation', 'things', 'pagan', 'When', 'conflict', 'worship', 'gods', 'violent', 'full-blown', 'riot', 'pagans', 'retreat', 'Library', 'Christian', 'Emperor', 'eventually', 'conflict', 'allowing', 'pagans', 'escape', 'lives', 'leaving', 'library', 'Christians', 'End', 'Act', 'One.Act', 'Two', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'Many', 'Hypatia', 'students', 'have', 'gone', 'become', 'leaders', 'Rome', 'Orestes', 'still', 'love', 'prefect', 'Alexandria', 'Synesius', 'Rupert', 'Evans', 'former', 'pupil', 'now', 'Bishop', 'Cyrene', 'Davus', 'been', 'freed', 'joined', 'Christians', 'extremists', 'Hypatia', 'been', 'toiling', 'diligently', 'away', 'developing', 'heliocentric', 'model', 'solar', 'system', 'elliptical', 'orbits', 'planets', 'Christian', 'leader', 'Cyril', 'Sami', 'Samir', 'not', 'content', 'just', 'expelling', 'pagans', 'Jews', 'are', 'risk', 'too', 'not', 'long', 'similar', 'conflict', 'erupts', 'streets.It', 'clear', 'Christians', 'are', 'ascending', 'power', 'leaving', 'civil', 'authorities', 'risk', 'losing', 'secular', 'objectivity', 'Cyril', 'Orestes', 'affection', 'Hypatia', 'attack', 'authority', 'Hypatia', 'will', 'not', 'convert', 'Christian', 'mobs', 'will', 'kill', 'convert', 'Christianity', 'Cyril', 'authority', 'city', 'complete', 'refuses', 'force', 'issue', 'publicly', 'private', 'convert', 'viewers', 'who', 'know', 'history', 'Hypatia', 'already', 'doomed', 'just', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'stand', 'end.Agora', 'occasionally', 'connect', 'modern', 'audience', 'what', 'history', 'told', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'heaps', 'scientific', 'theories', 'lap', 'can', 'understand', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'lost', 'inverted', 'roles', 'fanatical', 'extremism', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'scriptures', 'likely', 'be', 'sore', 'point', 'Agora', 'compelling', 'case', 'Hypatia', 'WAS', 'killed', 'Christian', 'mob', 'being', 'witch.Unfortunately', 'film', 'slowly', 'inevitable', 'downward', 'spiral', 'learning', 'freedom', 'human', 'decency', 'history', 'lesson', 'thought-provoking', 'more', 'little', 'controversial', 'film', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long']",Agora

First are the grand action flicks featuring some sort of power struggle atop the empire as the context of the personal dramas.  These films include Cleopatra, Gladiator, and Spartacus.  Then there are the movies that take place at the peripheries of the empire, and usually involve wild tribes, foreign powers, and long dangerous hikes through forests.  Examples of this sub-genre include Last Legion, The Eagle, King Arthur, and Centurion.  The third category, and the most rare, are films that examine the transformation of the people and culture within the Empire, usually by religion.  The best-known example is probably Ben-Hur, which at heart, is an examination of the Jewish experience within the Empire.  Now we have Agora, which looks at the rise of Christianity within the Empire, and how it supplants both the older pagan beliefs, and its predecessor Jewish faith.  Within this context is the story of Hypatia, one of the most notable female philosophers with the ancient world.  This movie recreates her life and intellectual pursuits, which she can pursue due to her aristocratic and privileged life, and shows how it is drowned out by growing Christian faith, a faith built on those excluded from the aristocracy and privilege.

Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and Newton were devoted Christians, formed, shaped, and trained by Christian Universities. In fact, everything we know about the ancients we owe to the thousands of unknown Christian scholars that salvaged, preserved, copied and divulged their knowledge!

They organized persecutions and pogroms against the Christians of Alexandria. Cyril the Bishop spoke against such behavior, but he never advocated pogroms against the Jews. He did preach against what the Jews were doing to the Christians. But this was defensive rather than offensive. Slowly the Christian faith became the faith of most of the inhabitants of Alexandria. The Jews continued to invoke the power of the state against the Christians. Finally, they were ordered to leave Alexandria by the prefect, who had himself become a convert to Christianity.

The Jews, long removed from their slave history, are generally portrayed as rich and influential merchants of the period, though they play a minor role in the movie.  The Pagans, a polytheistic culture grounded in philosophy, mathematics and observational science to seek divine comprehension play a dominant role.

I picked it for several reasons:  Agora in Alexandria was one of the first public libraries where young, noble men had their lessons thought to them and where they freely exchanged their ideas.  It was a breeding ground for raising new leaders for the future generations.  But this is also a story about Hypatia, one of the first female philosophers from the ancient times known to mankind.  Although none of her written work remains today, she was well known figure and her unfortunate demise is just one of the facts that grants her immortality.Hypatia devoted her entire life to teaching, writing and questioning the world around her.  As a philosopher, she raised questions related to mankind as well as God and Universe.  During her life, religion was depply divided between pagans, who worshiped Egyptian Gods, Jews who believed in a single God and Christinas fairly new religion who accepted teachings of Jesus and were waiting for their salvation.  There was little tolerance between these three fractions and with Roman Empire loosing its grip in that part of the world, it was a place destined for uprising between old world and the new one; between aristocracy and their slaves.I liked the fact that director choose to portray Hypatia as a woman devoted to her profession and able to separate herself from men she was teaching, in spite of the fact that many of them fell in love with her for her brilliant mind and her compassionate spirit.  Her beauty from the inside out, transcends the social order of the time which is both her strenght and her fall.  Being unmarried woman, she has no protector.  Her profession requires of her to constantly question and challenge the world around her which does not sit  well with men in power.  Her brutal death makes her a martyr that makes her immortal for eternity.Great movie, with story well told.

1336437,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B003CI2G6S,Robert J. Crawford,"[2, 4]","I was quite astonished at the sophistication of this film.  It has all the prerequisites of overblown melodrama:  a beautiful proto-feminist heroine, two men in love with her (a slave and an aristocrat), and a reconstituted repository of ancient rational knowledge, in a backdrop of fanatical Christians taking over from declining pagans.  I assumed, wrongly, it was going to be another Prince-of-Persia type reconstruction of hyperbole, muddled facts, and overlooked nuance.  Instead, the film is a wonderfully stimulating portrayal of an intellectual and the end of a tradition - of rationalist philosophy - of nearly 1000 years, to make way for monotheism and soon the collapse of the Roman civilization.The intellectual themes of the film are rather recondite.  On the one hand, Hypatia (who actually is an historical figure) is seeking to explore the validity of the core assumptions in the cosmology of Ptolemy:  that the Earth is the stationary center of the universe around which everything revolves; that circles, the most perfect expression of the principles of Euclidean geometry, must be the form that the motions take.  She starts from the premise that real-life observation should be connected to philosophic ideals (a precursor of modern scientific experimentation).  On the other hand, there are the fundamentalists, that is, the early Christians who are following their consciences and the dictates of the Emperor Constantine to accept Christianity as the religion of the Empire;  their universe is not rational, but based on faith, what is the word of God as written in the Book, and lastly revelation in which God directly offers guidance to the self-appointed leaders of the faithful.  It is simply amazing to me that this clash of world views can be presented with the level of subtlety and sophistication that it is.The plot that frames the story is somewhat less subtle, but the script, the direction, and the acting are so fine that, in my view, none of the characters (save perhaps the brutal, angry, and arrogant Christian leader Cyril) fall into stereotypes.  Hypatia is the daughter of an old-style aristocratic philosopher, who is open-minded enough not to push her into marriage and nurtured her mind to the point that she is a masterful teacher and intellectual.  They maintain what is left of the Alexandrian library, a treasury of ancient knowledge accumulated from the time of Alexander the Great.  Outside their walls, there is a fight for the soul of the city, led by a fanatical Christian, Cyril, about whom I know nothing as to his historical basis.  The pagans feel besieged, the Christians on the ascendant, as backed by the Emperors of West and East Rome.Hypatia is loved by both an aristocratic upstart and one of her slaves.  These two men embody what is happening to the city and indeed to the empire.  Fortunately, the evolution of their characters and their later actions - in spite of Hyaptia's rejection of both of their advances - is completely believable and nuanced.  I do not want to play the spoiler here as it is a big part of the film's value and dramatic tension.  Suffice to say that the Christians win, their appetite for power and domination ever expanding and sweeping away anything and everyone in its wake:  as fundamentalists with a monopoly on the truth, they are portrayed as nascent totalitarians though not as simple brutes.As a history buff who has long studied the elucidation of the motion of the planets - the greatest early achievement of what became modern science - I did feel that too much license was taken with what Hypatia did and thought.  Indeed, she is portrayed as first discovering what Johannes Kepler finally proved in the late Renaissance:  that the Earth moved in an elliptical orbit around the sun, which occupied one of its foci.  There is no evidence that she did, so far as I know.  Nonetheless, that the film brings these issues to a popular audience with the sophistication that it does, and without  2-dimensional characters, is a first-rate achievement.Recommended with enthusiasm.  If  Christian fundamentalists denounce the existential perspective of the film, this would be a regrettable missed chance for dialogue.  No one, save the brilliant Hypatia, looks good in this rich film.",5,"a delightfully stimulating surprise, at the close of antiquity",1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,4280,"['was', 'quite', 'astonished', 'sophistication', 'film', 'prerequisites', 'overblown', 'melodrama', 'beautiful', 'proto-feminist', 'heroine', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'slave', 'aristocrat', 'reconstituted', 'repository', 'ancient', 'rational', 'knowledge', 'backdrop', 'fanatical', 'Christians', 'taking', 'over', 'declining', 'pagans', 'assumed', 'wrongly', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Prince-of-Persia', 'type', 'reconstruction', 'hyperbole', 'muddled', 'facts', 'overlooked', 'nuance', 'Instead', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'stimulating', 'portrayal', 'intellectual', 'end', 'tradition', 'rationalist', 'philosophy', 'nearly', '1000', 'years', 'make', 'way', 'monotheism', 'soon', 'collapse', 'Roman', 'intellectual', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'rather', 'recondite', 'one', 'hand', 'Hypatia', 'who', 'actually', 'historical', 'figure', 'seeking', 'explore', 'validity', 'core', 'assumptions', 'cosmology', 'Ptolemy', 'Earth', 'stationary', 'center', 'universe', 'everything', 'revolves', 'circles', 'most', 'perfect', 'expression', 'principles', 'Euclidean', 'geometry', 'must', 'be', 'form', 'motions', 'take', 'premise', 'real-life', 'observation', 'should', 'be', 'connected', 'philosophic', 'ideals', 'precursor', 'modern', 'scientific', 'experimentation', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'fundamentalists', 'early', 'Christians', 'who', 'are', 'following', 'consciences', 'dictates', 'Emperor', 'Constantine', 'accept', 'Christianity', 'religion', 'Empire', 'universe', 'not', 'rational', 'based', 'faith', 'what', 'word', 'God', 'written', 'Book', 'lastly', 'revelation', 'God', 'directly', 'guidance', 'self-appointed', 'leaders', 'faithful', 'simply', 'amazing', 'clash', 'world', 'views', 'can', 'be', 'presented', 'level', 'subtlety', 'sophistication', 'plot', 'story', 'somewhat', 'less', 'subtle', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'so', 'fine', 'view', 'none', 'characters', 'save', 'perhaps', 'brutal', 'angry', 'arrogant', 'Christian', 'leader', 'Cyril', 'fall', 'stereotypes', 'Hypatia', 'daughter', 'old-style', 'aristocratic', 'philosopher', 'who', 'open-minded', 'enough', 'not', 'push', 'marriage', 'nurtured', 'mind', 'point', 'masterful', 'teacher', 'intellectual', 'maintain', 'what', 'left', 'Alexandrian', 'library', 'treasury', 'ancient', 'knowledge', 'accumulated', 'time', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'Outside', 'walls', 'fight', 'soul', 'city', 'led', 'fanatical', 'Christian', 'Cyril', 'whom', 'know', 'nothing', 'historical', 'basis', 'pagans', 'feel', 'besieged', 'Christians', 'ascendant', 'backed', 'Emperors', 'West', 'East', 'Rome.Hypatia', 'loved', 'aristocratic', 'upstart', 'one', 'slaves', 'two', 'men', 'embody', 'what', 'happening', 'city', 'indeed', 'empire', 'Fortunately', 'evolution', 'characters', 'later', 'actions', 'spite', 'Hyaptia', 'rejection', 'advances', 'completely', 'believable', 'nuanced', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'play', 'spoiler', 'here', 'big', 'part', 'film', 'value', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Christians', 'win', 'appetite', 'power', 'domination', 'ever', 'expanding', 'sweeping', 'away', 'anything', 'everyone', 'wake', 'fundamentalists', 'monopoly', 'truth', 'are', 'portrayed', 'nascent', 'totalitarians', 'though', 'not', 'simple', 'history', 'buff', 'who', 'long', 'studied', 'elucidation', 'motion', 'planets', 'greatest', 'early', 'achievement', 'what', 'became', 'modern', 'science', 'did', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'license', 'was', 'taken', 'what', 'Hypatia', 'did', 'thought', 'Indeed', 'portrayed', 'first', 'discovering', 'what', 'Johannes', 'Kepler', 'finally', 'proved', 'late', 'Renaissance', 'Earth', 'moved', 'elliptical', 'orbit', 'sun', 'occupied', 'one', 'foci', 'evidence', 'did', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'issues', 'popular', 'audience', 'sophistication', '2-dimensional', 'characters', 'first-rate', 'achievement.Recommended', 'enthusiasm', 'Christian', 'fundamentalists', 'denounce', 'existential', 'perspective', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'regrettable', 'missed', 'chance', 'dialogue', 'one', 'save', 'brilliant', 'Hypatia', 'good', 'rich', 'film']",Agora

1336439,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B003CI2G6S,Robin Friedman,"[68, 90]","The major character in this large-scale film, ""Agora"" (2009) is Hypatia of Alexandria (350? - 415 A.D.), a beautiful and brilliant philosopher and mathematician performed by Rachel Weisz.  Set in Alexandria, Egypt, this film is an expensive, lavish production, a throwback in many ways to other extravagant epics set in ancient Greece or Rome.  The film is Spanish in origin and directed by Alejandro Amenebar. The movie is serious in intent. It portrays Hypatia as a scholar without religious belief intent only upon free disinterested scientific inquiry.  She is caught in the turbulence of 4th Century Alexandria in the decaying Roman Empire in the violence among pagans, Jews, and Christians.  The violence results in the destruction of the storied Library of Alexandria, a treasure house of wisdom in the ancient world.  Religious fanaticism and sectarianism also leads to Hypatia's death at the hands of a Christian mob.Other than Weisz' portrayal of the heroine, the acting in this movie tends to be wooden and the dialogue stilted. The most effective scenes are those of Hypatia in her study.  She is a renowned teacher whose students include individual from all creeds and status united only by the desire to learn. She is a geometer who has studied the properties of cones. A student of Ptolemy, Hypatia becomes skeptical of his geocentric model of the solar system in which the earth is at the center. She becomes interested in the theory that the planets revolve around the sun. The difficulties she finds in this theory result from, among other things, the teleological view of reality she inherits from Plato and Aristotle which teaches that movement of astronomical bodies in their orbits must be circular because the circle is the most perfect shape. The movie shows Hypatia working away from this theory towards a more modern understanding.Much of the movie consists of the mob scenes and violence common to epic films of the ancient world.  There is large-scale, brutal fighting between Christians and pagans and between Christians and Jews as the Christians are shown as mindlessly and violently destroying what was best in the ancient world.  In the film, Hypatia is shown as having at least three suitors, one a former slave, and another a highly placed prefect who tries to bring a balance between the claims of the Church and the competing voices of paganism.  Hypatia rejects romantic love in scenes that are muffled in their purpose and mostly confused.The problem I found with the movie was that its format does not work to convey the complexity of the issues that it tries to raise.  Instead, it offers what on its face is a garish, expensive production which, whatever its virtues as entertainment, does not encourage reflection. ""Agora"" has its heart in the right place in its skepticism and commitment to free inquiry, but the cost is great oversimplification of philosophical and historical issues and anachronism. While this movie has been praised for its portrayal of free inquiry and for its critique of religious exclusivism, it doesn't grapple in any depth with its themes. A rather free-wheeling historical epic seems to me to contrast with the quiet, independent spirit and thought that the movie tries properly to attribute to Hypatia. I was frustrated by the movie and unconvinced that it left me wiser than I had been before about Alexandria, Hypatia, or religion and science.  It seems to me that the movie substitutes one set of oversimplified platitudes for another.Robin Friedman",3,Hypatia,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,3524,"['major', 'character', 'large-scale', 'film', 'Agora', '2009', 'Hypatia', 'Alexandria', '350', '415', 'A.D.', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'philosopher', 'mathematician', 'performed', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Set', 'Alexandria', 'Egypt', 'film', 'expensive', 'lavish', 'production', 'throwback', 'many', 'ways', 'other', 'extravagant', 'epics', 'set', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'Rome', 'film', 'Spanish', 'origin', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenebar', 'movie', 'serious', 'intent', 'Hypatia', 'scholar', 'religious', 'belief', 'intent', 'only', 'upon', 'free', 'disinterested', 'scientific', 'inquiry', 'caught', 'turbulence', '4th', 'Century', 'Alexandria', 'decaying', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'violence', 'pagans', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'violence', 'results', 'destruction', 'storied', 'Library', 'Alexandria', 'treasure', 'house', 'wisdom', 'ancient', 'world', 'Religious', 'fanaticism', 'sectarianism', 'also', 'Hypatia', 'death', 'hands', 'Christian', 'mob.Other', 'Weisz', 'portrayal', 'heroine', 'acting', 'movie', 'be', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'stilted', 'most', 'effective', 'scenes', 'are', 'Hypatia', 'study', 'renowned', 'teacher', 'students', 'include', 'individual', 'creeds', 'status', 'united', 'only', 'desire', 'learn', 'geometer', 'who', 'studied', 'properties', 'cones', 'student', 'Ptolemy', 'Hypatia', 'skeptical', 'geocentric', 'model', 'solar', 'system', 'earth', 'center', 'interested', 'theory', 'planets', 'revolve', 'sun', 'difficulties', 'theory', 'result', 'other', 'things', 'teleological', 'view', 'reality', 'Plato', 'Aristotle', 'movement', 'astronomical', 'bodies', 'orbits', 'must', 'be', 'circular', 'circle', 'most', 'perfect', 'shape', 'movie', 'Hypatia', 'working', 'away', 'theory', 'more', 'modern', 'understanding.Much', 'movie', 'mob', 'scenes', 'violence', 'common', 'epic', 'films', 'ancient', 'world', 'large-scale', 'brutal', 'fighting', 'Christians', 'pagans', 'Christians', 'Jews', 'Christians', 'are', 'shown', 'mindlessly', 'violently', 'destroying', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'ancient', 'world', 'film', 'Hypatia', 'shown', 'having', 'least', 'three', 'suitors', 'one', 'former', 'slave', 'highly', 'placed', 'prefect', 'who', 'bring', 'balance', 'claims', 'Church', 'competing', 'voices', 'paganism', 'Hypatia', 'romantic', 'love', 'scenes', 'are', 'muffled', 'purpose', 'mostly', 'confused.The', 'problem', 'found', 'movie', 'was', 'format', 'not', 'work', 'convey', 'complexity', 'issues', 'raise', 'Instead', 'what', 'face', 'garish', 'expensive', 'production', 'virtues', 'entertainment', 'not', 'encourage', 'reflection', 'Agora', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'skepticism', 'commitment', 'free', 'inquiry', 'cost', 'great', 'oversimplification', 'philosophical', 'historical', 'issues', 'anachronism', 'movie', 'been', 'praised', 'portrayal', 'free', 'inquiry', 'critique', 'religious', 'exclusivism', ""n't"", 'grapple', 'depth', 'themes', 'rather', 'free-wheeling', 'historical', 'epic', 'contrast', 'quiet', 'independent', 'spirit', 'thought', 'movie', 'properly', 'attribute', 'Hypatia', 'was', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'unconvinced', 'left', 'wiser', 'had', 'been', 'Alexandria', 'Hypatia', 'religion', 'science', 'movie', 'one', 'set', 'oversimplified', 'platitudes', 'another.Robin', 'Friedman']",Agora

1336447,A2GQ7EUWPSB0OP,B003CI2G6S,Sarakani,"[294, 327]","Alexandria was one of the most glorious cities of Eurasia, a hybrid of three sets of cultures, European, Nubian and Asian created by Alexander and the Ptolemy dynasty around 320BCE.  Its heyday was probably around 200BCE and it lasted well over a millennium.  Alexandria was eclipsed by the dark ages around 415 when the whole of Egyptian history in the classical mould came to an end as Theodosius, the Emperor of a dying Rome imposed Christianity on Egypt.  Most temples, their gods and writings were destroyed or defaced, from Zeus in Olympia to the temple of Artemis at Ephesus in modern Turkey.  In Egypt the Seraphium was destroyed, a daughter library to the famous library of Alexandria that was probably largely destroyed around 50BCE when Julius Caesar took over Alexandria and Egypt fell under Roman sway.  This film is very much an encapsulation of the Christianisation of Alexandria and the destruction of its ancient ways, making it ripe for ruin and decay.  The one structure that did survive that forms a backdrop to this film is the Pharos lighthouse, created in 250BCE that survived all the way into around 1280 by which time Alexandria was part of the Islamic Empire.As a satellite city of Rome, Alexandria still enjoyed a cultural and educational reputation at the time of Hypatia, a neoplatonist philosopher who had studied in Athens and Italy.  She taught at the Seraphaeum representing a sort of University/Library scholastic complex dedicated to learning.  Hypatia was part scientist and mathematician but also and no less importantly a philosopher.  She probably believed in transcendental modes of consciousness as taught by Plotinus.  She worked with her farther Theon and together they edited several works, clarified various mathematical books added their own contributions, none of which have survived (though some of Hypatias editing may be present in Greek mathematics that she helped transmit).  Hypatia invented or devised several scientific instruments.  She was obviously a person of importance, not merely a noted academic.  Towards 415AD there was a power struggle between the Roman prefect Orestes and the Roman Archbishop Cyril of Alexandria.  Orestes was allied with Hypatia and Cyril probably engineered her elimination as a symbol of paganism and witchcraft.What facts we have come from the letters of her students among other works, including clergymen and the historian Socrates Scholasticus.  We know very little about whether the Serapheum had a large book collection and how much of the library of Alexandria had survived there into the time of Hypatia.This film encapsulates the facts available in the context of a triangle of rivalry between Judaism, Christianity and Paganism and also a struggle between the Church and State.  It objectifies Alexandria seen from space.  The restoration of the city is very good but perhaps does not do justice to the glories of the city that once was that probably possessed more colour, rather than the dusty restoration the film presents.  I was disappointed that there were so many candles shown.  They did not use candles.  They used lamps of olive oil and we know much about these lamps from surviving examples.  So much more could have been shown about Hypatia herself, even as a semi fictitious character.  Maybe a vignette of her writing with a quill pen in lamp light, and how she travelled around in a carriage rather than on foot.  Here we do get glimpses of her with her students and a famous incident of her rebuffing one of them who declared his love for her.  This incident did take place.  More is shown of Hypatia the astronomer and scientist and less of her as a spiritual being, a philosopher though some indication is given.  My favourite line is concerns Hypatia stating that her father would have celebrated a conjunction between Mars and perhaps Jupiter in Aquarius.  Hypatia was no atheist secularist though she would have been a rational thinker who questioned dogma as the film tries to show.I believe that given the limited resources the film commanded they have done the best they could.  Indeed certain details of the script reveal a depth of reading and research that is new to me to deserve exploration.  They concentrate on Hypatia formulating a heliocentric view of the Earth's rotation as stated by Aristarchus from one of his books.  We hear about this book from the ""mother library"" that once was in Alexandria of which the Serapheum, associated with Hypatia was a satellite.In this film they indicate bloody conflicts arising between the pagans and the Christians.  I think that most of the aggression came from the Christians given they were supported by Rome and there isn't much evidence for the pagans attacking Christians in cold blood as indicated (though blood was probably spilt one way or another).  We are aware that the Serapheum was destroyed and the film recreates this incident on the basis of a precedent which is questionable.  Later we see another scene where the Jews rouse the ire of the Christians.  What is clear from history is that the Jews of Alexandria were attacked and dispersed, again rendered in unholy detail in this film.  The ancient anti semitism is portrayed very realistically and may arouse emotion.The conflict between Orestes and St Cyril is dramatized extremely well leading to a rather tragic climax.  Rachel Weisz gives a good performance where Hypatia stands out like an English heroine.  The real Hypatia may have been a bit more tanned (and theoretically a lot older when she died) but Weisz is believable.  If only the props were a bit better, with lamps and a carriage for her.  Her face looks pained and haunted as she is lead to her death, dealt with rather sensitively if a touch unconvincingly given Hypatia's slave who softens the blow.Dramatic license is acceptable and much of the context is very powerfully served up.  I could have watched a film an hour longer if necessary if more history was introduced.  We see the theatre and overall the city comes alive, about as close as a film could ever take you to classical Alexandria.  The fanaticism of emergent Christianity is I believe faithful enough though this film is not an attack on religion per se.  Indeed, it always tries to create a precedent to indicate why the Christians became hostile, precedents not always contained in history though the hostility was clear.  Overall, the film does a good job.The greatest tragedy of this film is that despite covering its costs it has had a poor audience in the USA and the UK.  As far as I'm aware the film was only largely shown in London in two cinemas and rather tentatively at that.  I get the impression there is a conspiracy to suppress this film that mirrors the conspiracy to suppress Hypatia.  Far more deserves to be shown of Alexandria as a centre of learning and humanity at its finest.  Egypt was far more glorious then than it even aspires to today.  However the glories of Alexandria continue to emerge from the sea.  Above all the Egyptians could learn from this film, though the bulk of them will probably remain unconvinced.The flavor and power of this film is sufficiently strong and convincing for it to be considered very significant.  At least as significant as the old Cleopatra film (with Elizabeth Taylor) that happened to be a cinematic flop.  I just hope this film helps to keep the lamps and the light alive for civilisation to continue without getting bogged down in dogma.",5,The light of Alexandria,1275436800,"06 2,

It follows the life of a Greek philosopher, astronomer and mathematican named Hypatia played extremely well by Rachel Weisz.  The story takes place in the city of Alexandria in Egypt and has a great deal to do with the emergence of Christianity and the Christians persecution of the pagan religions.  From what I&#8217;ve read by people who know more than I do about the 4th century A.D., the movie is a bit heavy handed when it comes to the Christians, who appear more like modern day Taliban, and it seems the Library of Alexandria and lighthouse were already destroyed.  As I was ignorant of those facts, I found Hypatia&#8217;s story interesting and the depiction of Alexandria quite fascinating.  I don't know if the director of the film had an agenda to put down Christianity and don't care if he did.

The setting is in the early years following the edict of Milan that would eventually lead to the acceptance of Christianity as the Roman state religion.  However, the Christian bishops of this movie are not portrayed as the neo-Platonic philosophers they tended to be but as something more akin to modern Fundamentalist extremists.  Such anachronisms are expected from the movie business but then to build subtle error into outright inaccuracy, the script writers decided to pin the blame for burning the great library at Alexandria on these same proto-Charismatics.  Never mind that at the time of the movie setting the library had already been burned centuries before by Roman armies.  No, once again there seems to be an underlying agenda that must force the past to fit the modern bias toward faith as opposed to enlightened and morally superior reason and science.  History has many examples of injustice on the part of Christians (or any group for that matter).  But perpetuating the anti-faith myths such as the Hypatia incident and Galileo without an honest treatment of the historical context is becoming a modern film clich&eacute;.

1336458,A2TFWLHE25JD06,B003CI2G6S,Surrounded,"[3, 7]","This film does take liberty with the historical record.  It's tempting to imagine the burning of the library and the lynching of Hypatia as the culture performing an intellectual suicide, moving the world from the wisdom of antiquity to the fear and ignorance of the dark ages, not to be dispelled until the Renaissance.  In one of his books, Carl Sagan described it in just this way.  It would seem that the library was so monumental as to require a cataclysmic explanation for its disappearance.The first accusation, barely remembered now, was to blame Julius Caesar for burning the library.  Apparently Caesar was trapped in Alexandria, and fired the harbor to excape, resulting in the accidental burning of a few books when the flames spread.  But the library obviously was still around for centuries after this.There is also no evidence that the early Christians burned the library, either, as evidence clearly shows many books surviving after this period as well.  What happened is that as tastes and interests changed, many of the works considered ""pagan"" were deemed not worth the effort of copying, so as the ink faded and the papyrus disintegrated, these works were lost.  Later, when Alexandria was under Moslem control, the Christian works suffered the same fate, with the result that the library gradually succumbed to the ravages of time, its contents gradually disappearing.  Yet many works did survive, there and in other places, in copies and translations by Christian and Moslem scholars.  If they had not, the Renaissance itself - a rediscovery and reapplication of the art and science of antiquity - may never have happened.The film's ending seems to imply that had Hypatia been allowed to live and continue her work, science would have been advanced 1,200 years, and the so-called ""Dark Ages"" (more properly, the Early Middle Ages) might possibly have been avoided.  I have wondered the same thing about Archimedes, who was reportedly on the verge of discovering Calculus when he was mistakenly killed by a soldier who was only supposed to capture him.  Had he been allowed to live, maybe we would already be in the world of Star Trek by now.  This thinking suggests that history is advanced by intelligent, powerful, or charismatic individuals with big ideas.We tend to accept this explanation because history does seem to be advanced by such individuals, who tend to take center stage.  After all, if George Washington and King George III had never lived, would the United States still be a colony of Great Britain today?  But this ignores the zeitgeist, where the masses of a particular time make a collective decision to move in a certain direction.  In Hypatia's time, her brand of inquiry was on the wane - it had no place in the new society that was developing, where knowledge was based on personal revelation rather than objective observation.  Even if she had survived and published her supposed discoveries, they really would have been a thousand years ahead of their time.  There was no audience for them, in other words, so they would have been ignored, or at best a mere curiosity.  And one benefit of this is that atomic weapons were developed in the 1940s, not the 740s.Science is not a disparate collection of facts - it is more like a jigsaw puzzle.  New pieces must fit into the existing ones, which can be modified or even discarded, but the entire picture is difficult to erase.  This may be why research into psychic phenomena seems so crackpot - it doesn't fit into the existing paradigm.  It may also be why great discoveries are sometimes made by completely separate and disconnected people at the same time - they are not sui generis, but are logical developments of the current scientific culture.  Hypatia's ""discoveries"" in this film were not the beginning of anything; they were the tail end.  It is fun to speculate, ""what would have happened, if...""

The narrative revolves around the Greek philosopher Hypatia (a teacher at the Platonic school) where the future elite are educated. Her story is told against the back ground of a Roman Empire running out of `steam', and is turning rapidly from Paganism to the early form of Christianity .The metamorphosis of the relatively new religion is neither pain less or consequence free. Religious tolerance seems non-existent, from this new faith. In turn the Pagans either convert on mass and the few who remain try to keep a low profile. The Christians then turn their attention to the Jews, and soon they come into conflict, committing violent acts against each other.  The majority soon prevail, with the Christians ultimately wresting power from the only other religious group remaining.  During this time of change - which at times are punctuated by a years of peace our philosopher Hypatia, continues with her single minded quest for knowledge. However, her study of heliocentrism, is not permitted by the new faith and soon she has to focus on working privately on her theories and experiments.Heliocentrism is the study of `astronomical model' in which the Earth and planets revolve around a stationary Sun at the centre of the solar system. This type of study was at odds with the accepted theory that all heavenly bodies, including the Sun, revolved around the Earth, the Earth was the centre of all things. While film is based on key main events in the Historical record, the narrative, the characterizations are fictional. The colour and iconography are rich and sumptuous, and remind me of such classic films as Ben-Hur or the Ten Commandments.This review does not wish to give away plot themes and the narrative that encompasses this rather fictionalized view of a rather extraordinary person who was ahead of her time by nearly 500 years plus, both as an accomplished scientist and women who was not abashed in speaking her mind in the company of men, these men being the elite of Alexandria in their own home patch. This then brings Hypatia into conflict as it is believed that she is the cause of strained relations between Orestes (a former pupil who loves her and values her intellect), the Imperial Roman Prefect, and the Patriarch Cyril, thus she attracted the hatred of the Christians of Alexandria, who wanted the politician and the priest to reconcile. One day, in March AD 415, during Lent, a Christian mob of Nitrian monks, way lay, attack and finally kill what they perceive is a Witch of the worst kind.I do not believe this film is anti Christian and for that matter nor is it anti religion. As one reviewer has puts it, the film is about `fanaticism and unreason'. Well I see the threads here that may lead to this inclination. However, for me I felt it was more about power play and influence, the religious conflict etc are the tools of the conflict, at the end of the day it was about power and who has it. The same is true in today's world.

It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?Hypatia was a scientist and philosopher, she is portrayed as an atheist in this film, although her religious belief is uncertain.

Because for all the cries of brilliance from one school of thought and damnation from the other, Agora is nothing more than a technically impressive but emotionally unengaging Christians versus pagans epic that aspires to be a thoughtful allegory of scientific inquiry versus religious fundamentalism but instead tends to be very vague and confused when it comes to religion, which is a real problem considering the subject matter, and increasingly dull, which is an even bigger problem.It does offer novelty value in reversing the traditional Biblical epic and having Christians metaphorically throwing pagans and Jews to the lions with sadistic abandon in 4th Century AD Alexandria as the Roman Empire starts to fall to pieces, but it's all a little half-baked and woolly-headed to pass muster as a thinking man or woman's epic and too relentlessly so-so to work as entertainment.Stuck in the middle and supposedly standing for reason is the idealised figure of Hypatia (Rachel Weisz, the actress you call when Kate Winslett is busy), a philosopher-astronomer-teacher whose words of wisdom fall on increasingly deaf ears because, as a woman, she's despised by the bloodthirsty radical Christians and, as an atheist, is regarded as unsuitable for public office by the pagans (well, at least in the cut that premiered at Cannes in 2009, though that scene is notably missing from the shorter version that was eventually released to theatres).Although the film doesn't try to entirely impose 20th century values on its rather one-dimensional heroine - she takes slavery for granted and the science is appropriately 2000 years out of date - it does have a rather confused attitude to what she stands for and why we should admire her. She espouses brotherhood but has no empathy, responds to shows of affection with humiliation, uses others merely as a sounding board for her own brilliance while ironically, and presumably unintentionally, being portrayed as something of a second-rate thinker. With her actual works long destroyed (by Muslims rather than Christians a couple of centuries after the events in the film), her quest to unravel if or how the Earth orbits around the sun may even be a misrepresentation of her work in an attempt to present her as an earlier Galileo and further the myth that science and religion are completely incompatible. The film certainly misrepresents her as an atheist when it seems she was a pagan to simplify the story's central conflict into one of empirical evidence versus blind faith - having her worship graven images might have taken some of the shine off her credibility for modern audiences, and it would never do to have a flawed heroine.Instead, it paints her as an atheist Christ dying for the sins of Deists, and one whose wisdom all reasonable men (there are no other female characters) bow before. And how ""How nave I was. How nave I was,"" laments one former suitor-turned-prefect when she points out the errors in his let-the-Christians-kill-the-Jews-and-that'll-be-an-end-to-it policy. Even her father's final scene is an ""I should have listened to you"" mea culpa after his ill-advised response to a Christian act of provocation results in the besieging of the Alexandria Library. If only they'd have listened to her, the film seems to be saying, all of this could have been avoided.It's a role and a film that desperately needs an exceptionally charismatic and inspiring star performance to compensate for the many flaws, but it doesn't get it. With little real dramatic meat to work with, Weisz generally chooses to play the part by alternating between two expressions, her serious look and the head girl enthusiastically giving the school lecture on prize day, and a two-note performance in a one-dimensional role that never develops makes her a weak centre for the film to revolve around (Amenabar is big on revolutions and circles in the film's visual scheme). We're only introduced to her emotional dilemma - that to give herself to a man means the loss of her freedom to think and to teach - through her father (Michel Lonsdale), and it really doesn't seem to bother her until one brief scene near the film's end. She's far too in love with her own intellect and the heavenly spheres.Unfortunately her character seems to be made all the weaker by the one-note villainy the film extends to the evil kill-crazy Christians. Ideologically and spiritually these black-clad crazies stand for nothing - they could just as well be Indians or Zulus or insects from Starship Troopers (and boy, does Amenabar love his sped-up aerial shots making them look like busy ants). They're simply empty-headed black-hearted villains out to kill everyone, with Saint Cyril portrayed as such a Satanic figure that all that's missing is the forked tail and pitchfork. Even a Christian lifelong friend and devotee like Synsesius is inaccurately turned into an enemy opposing her ideas or right to offer counsel to men. It's those kind of broad brushstrokes and lack of historical context that perhaps hurts the film the most, with the film offering no idea of how an empire that had previously been tolerant of most religions changed so violently any more than it shows how a religion built on turning the other cheek and forgiving your enemies became so violently militant as it abandoned pacifism with a vengeance once it became Romanised. One early scene does briefly address the appeal Christianity had to the poor and the under class - a religion that you didn't have to be born into, that favored the weak over the powerful and which found joy in giving rather than receiving - but it's a brief moment that's never pursued in the final cut. Instead it's a conflict between the nasty black togas and the good white togas, with little explanation of what either faction really stands for. Only in the final scenes does it threaten to address the conflict between constantly questioning science and unquestioning religion, by which time it's too late to summon up much interest.(The longer version that premiered at Cannes in 2009 to such a poor response was a little bit more balanced: you saw the Parabalanos acting as intermediaries in street disputes, feeding the poor and burying the dead rather than just acting like Christ's stormtroopers, the Christians were themselves more firmly divided into two opposing camps, the pagans more aware of the coming storm and, crucially, Max Minghella's slave was seen as being as interested in being seen as an equal of his mistress as her lover, if not more. Unfortunately none of those scenes - included on the Spanish DVD and BluRay - were enough to add more than the most superficial of window dressing to the film.)The digitally recreated Alexandria and the massive sets filled with thousands of extras are often impressive even if used more as scenery and the occasional battleground than a centre point for the film, and after the first half the film conveys no sense of the world around its few characters. It doesn't help that these characters seem to be made out of cardboard, not least the men who are either weak-willed or evil, a problem magnified by a number of poor performances from some weak actors. Max Minghella's once-loyal slave briefly threatens to become more interesting than his dull performance as he realises that he has no value to Hypatia beyond what practical use she can make of him, but that simply manifests itself as turning in a Christian-Bale-in-a-bit-of-a-moody impersonation as he becomes a Christian stormtrooper on gaining his freedom. Oscar Isaac's performance as the equally ineffectual suitor and prefect seems to be driven by thoughts of what Rufus Sewell would do in his place and Rupert Evans' Bishop Synesius cuts a particularly pitifully unconvincing figure. Only Ashraf Barhom's Christian martyr offers a genuinely charismatic performance as a man whose joyous belief exceeds his understanding and leads him to do terrible things in the name of divine love. As for the other female characters - there aren't any. Weisz and the odd extra with a non-speaking walk-on in the odd street scene is yer lot.Even as a purely visceral spectacle, the film feels curiously soft even in the midst of all the bloodletting. Rather than get in the thick of it, Amenabar would rather seem to be above it all, quite literally. Massacre of innocents? Cue celestial overhead shot accompanied by contractually obligatory wailing woman on the soundtrack courtesy of Dario Marinelli's surprisingly clich&eacute;d and dreary score. Suitor pouring out his heart through music? Cut to the slowly turning Earth seen from space. Rise of fundamentalism? Cosmic zoom ahoy, Cap'n! As yet another shot pointing out the cosmic insignificance of it all appeared, I just found myself wondering if he'd bought a job lot of outtakes from Carl Sagan's Cosmos. But no - the credits reveal he'd actually bought a job lot of stock footage from NASA, which presumably explains the presence of the Suez Canal and the Assuan Dam in Fourth Century AD Egypt, which the FX boys forgot to paint out. But then, in a film that takes as many liberties with history as this does (the film not only ignores the esteem she was held in by many contemporary Christians but even portrays Synesius, who defended her intellectual achievements, attacking her `blasphemous' scientific theories as if in a bad school production of Galileo), maybe they thought it didn't matter?In one of the film's better lines, Hypatia tells a Christian that his new religion has yet to prove it is any better than the old ones. Sadly, this is one peplum that, for all its technical window dressing, really isn't any better or more clearly thought through than the average confused and superficial Italian fight-for-Christ peplum of the 50s. And a lot less fun.",2,A would-be inspiring atheist epic that's as superficial and empty-headed as any 50s fight-for-Christ peplum,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",2011,10485,"['Alejandro', 'Amenabar',

1336465,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003CI2G6S,Turfseer,"[7, 12]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***With Agora, Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar has taken on a subject that has not been done before in the movies: the story of Hypatia, 4th century Alexandrian astronomer-philosopher, a woman way ahead of her time. Little is known about the historical Hypatia so Amenabar also depicts the political situation in Alexandria: the internecine struggle between a besieged Roman pagan culture and ascendant Christians. A fantastic set was constructed on the island of Malta along with digital effects added later on that recreates ancient Alexandria. Coupled with some excellent work on the part of the film's costume designer, the result is an impressive verisimilitude. Quibblers might object to the use of candles and glass windows but as the director points out in a special features DVD interview, there is considerable disagreement amongst historians as to whether those and other materials were in use at that particular period in history.Amenabar's main problem is that his protagonist is for the most part not an active agent in the external arc of the story. It's established early on that she rejects the love interests of both Davus, her soon to be freed slave and convert to Christianity and Orestes, the pagan nobleman who later becomes the prefect of Alexandria. In a scene based on a true story, she hands Orestes (at the beginning of the film, a student of Hypatia), a handkerchief soaked with blood from her menstrual cycle and makes it clear that she has no interest in future sexual relationships. Her interest is furthering her career in philosophy and astronomy. The focus thus is on Hypatia's internal arc, as she struggles to replace Ptolemy's erroneous geocentric conception of the universe with a heliocentric model. Amenabar informs us that he wanted 'Agora' to be, in part, a tribute to astronomy and physics. This is unfortunate because the many scenes that focus on Hypatia totally lack suspense. We KNOW basically that she'll come up with the right answer in regards to her astronomical quandaries, so no matter how many circles are drawn in the sand, the viewer is reminded more of a History Channel documentary than scenes from a flesh and blood drama.In contrast to most Biblical epics, Amendabar turns his Christians into the bad guys and now the Pagans, represented by the rational and humanistic Hypatia, are the enlightened. The Christians become stand-ins for today's fundamentalists. We learn from the DVD documentary that the costume designer based the costumes of the Parabalani (the Christian Brotherhood who are depicted here as bad guy enforcers for the local Patriarch) on the Taliban. Amendabar intentionally has the Christians all dressed in a dark gray and the pagans in white.Amendabar claims that the film is not meant to be anti-Christian and he emphasizes that the violence in the opening scenes is clearly instigated by the pagans. On the other hand, the Christians' rising militancy is ably depicted in the character of Ammonius who challenges a pagan to walk over some burning coals (this supposedly was based on a true story). When the pagan hesitates, the crowd throws him into the fire and he's almost burned to death. Amendabar then awkwardly inserts a scene that's designed to depict the 'good' side of the Christian mission--the soldiers are directed to give bread to the poor. But it's not enough--before you know it, the 'fundamentalist' Christians are throwing Jews out the windows of their apartments (a la Schindler's List) and stoning poor Hypatia to death much in the manner of today's Tablian. Despite his claims to the contrary, Amendabar appears to take some satisfaction in having his Christians get their comeuppance. He even has ""Saint"" Cyril, the bad guy Alexandrian Patriarch, read an misogynistic passage from the Book of Timothy as a prelude to his order that Hypatia renounce her 'faith'.Given all the sappy pro-Christian Biblical epics we've had to endure over the years, a corrective in the other direction might not be such a bad thing after all. Amendabar has provided a service in depicting true historical events where once oppressed Christians now attain power and become as bad as their former pagan oppressors. But that's really all Amendabar has provided: a history lesson! I think what's missing is some basic character development. Somehow I have the feeling that Cyril was a little more complicated than the sinister Fundamentalist stand-in depicted here.Amendabar fails to rise above hagiography in his telling of the Hypatia story. The short scene where she reminds Davus that he's still a slave during the pagan evacuation of the city is not enough to humanize his protagonist. Amendabar ends up being just as guilty as the Christians he derides when he turns Hypatia into a martyr of western rationalism. Even the 'good' Christians are ineffectual or downright hypocritical. Spineless Orestes falls to his knees in front of Synesius, symbolizing the complete capitulation of the pagan world to Christianity and Synesius can only mumble platitudes about God as he basically condones Hypatia's death sentence.In the end, science and 'reason' are Amendabar's good guys and promoters of 'faith' are the bad guys. The virtually all virtuous Hypatia stands in stark relief to the world's religions which are blamed for the spread of fundamentalism. 4th Century Christians are not only stand-ins for modern day Islamic fundamentalists but the basic tenets of Christianity, based on an anti-Semitic creed, is linked to the horrors of the Holocaust. Even the Jews (albeit seen less culpable here than the Christians and the Muslims) commit atrocities in the name of religion.Amendabar still manages to show restraint in some scenes. Particularly admirable is that he protects his audience from experiencing the full horror of Hypatia's execution (in history she's skinned alive; here, Davus, her former slave, suffocates her in order to prevent her further suffering).Agora is good as a basic history lesson. But its simplistic depiction of the supremacy of reason over religious fundamentalism doesn't ring quite true.",3,Hagiography of 4th Century Philosopher Scientist held up as corrective to religious

1336471,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B003CI2G6S,Z Hayes,"[3, 5]","I can't believe I never heard of this movie until it popped up as a recommended title on a movie rental site I subscribe to. This is a beautifully-made period/ historical drama which is set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria. The central character in this story is Hypatia (played by Rachel Weisz) a renowned female scholar who taught philosophy, astronomy, and mathematics. Though Hypatia is beautiful and desirable to males (having many male admirers), she is quite oblivious to this effect she has on men, preferring to immerse herself in scholarly pursuits.Some of her male admirers are Davus (Max Minghella), who happens to be her slave; there's the Christian student, Synesius (Rupert Evans); and finally, the openly admiring Orestes (Oscar Isaac) who declares his love for Hypatia during a public gathering - her reaction to this? By offering him a 'token' in the form of a rag smeared with her menstrual blood, a blatant and obvious message of rejection. There are more serious things explored in this drama than romantic pursuits. Alexandria is in the midst of a serious conflict between the pagan aristocracy to which Hypatia and her father belong, and the rising Christian militant movement called the Parabolani. The Jews are sort of caught in the middle, and the divisions between the upper and lower classes, as well as slaves, further exacerbates the situation.Fast forward a couple of years, and the library at Alexandria is now a holding pen for animals - a man named Cyril is the Patriarch of Alexandria, i.e. the leader of the Church; Orestes has converted to Christianity and is the Imperial Prefect of Alexandria, he is also dependent on Hypatia for her advice and appears to have set aside her rejection of him in the past; Synesius has risen to the position of Bishop; and Davus has joined the Parabolani. Hypatia continues to teach, though in a much diminished capacity - she also continues to fervently study the planets and their movement. Little does she realize the very real threat posed to her by the increasingly militant Christians who perceive her as a threat both because of her paganism and the influence she wields over the Prefect Orestes who is frequently at odds with Cyril.I'm not sure as to how much of this movie is period authentic, but I was impressed by the quality of the sets, and the direction. The acting was also above average - Rachel Weisz was incredible in her role as the strong-willed scholar who was way ahead of her time in terms of being a respected female scholar, and in the way she thought not only about astronomy but also about faith ( in one insightful dialogue between Hypatia and Synesius, she says, ""You do not question your beliefs, but I must."").Is this movie anti-Christian? I do not believe so - I think it portrays the events (based on whatever sources are still available) as they occurred during that period. Both the militant Christians, the black-robed Parabolani, and the Jews are depicted as being in conflict with each other -acts of stoning abound in this movie (must have been the favorite method of retaliation at the time?). More interestingly, I looked at this movie as depicting the conflict between religion and science, an age-old conflict that persists to this day. How much do we take on faith, and how much of science can truly explain all there is to be explained? Hypatia's theories about the movement of the planets was considered blasphemous, against Church teachings, yet time proved her theories had merit. I prefer to think of this movie as a thought-provoking drama that makes one ponder about the relationship between man, faith, and science.",5,"Beautifully-made, compelling historical drama",1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,3644,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'popped', 'up', 'recommended', 'title', 'movie', 'rental', 'site', 'subscribe', 'beautifully-made', 'period/', 'historical', 'drama', 'set', '4th', 'century', 'A.D.', 'Alexandria', 'central', 'character', 'story', 'Hypatia', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'renowned', 'female', 'scholar', 'who', 'taught', 'philosophy', 'astronomy', 'mathematics', 'Hypatia', 'beautiful', 'desirable', 'males', 'having', 'many', 'male', 'admirers', 'quite', 'oblivious', 'effect', 'men', 'preferring', 'immerse', 'scholarly', 'pursuits.Some', 'male', 'admirers', 'are', 'Davus', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'who', 'be', 'slave', 'Christian', 'student', 'Synesius', 'Rupert', 'Evans', 'finally', 'openly', 'admiring', 'Orestes', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', 'who', 'love', 'Hypatia', 'public', 'gathering', 'reaction', 'offering', ""'token"", 'form', 'rag', 'smeared', 'menstrual', 'blood', 'blatant', 'obvious', 'message', 'rejection', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'things', 'explored', 'drama', 'romantic', 'pursuits', 'Alexandria', 'midst', 'serious', 'conflict', 'pagan', 'aristocracy', 'Hypatia', 'father', 'belong', 'rising', 'Christian', 'militant', 'movement', 'called', 'Parabolani', 'Jews', 'are', 'sort', 'caught', 'middle', 'divisions', 'upper', 'lower', 'classes', 'as', 'well', 'slaves', 'further', 'situation.Fast', 'forward', 'couple', 'years', 'library', 'Alexandria', 'now', 'holding', 'pen', 'animals', 'man', 'named', 'Cyril', 'Patriarch', 'Alexandria', 'i.e', 'leader', 'Church', 'Orestes', 'converted', 'Christianity', 'Imperial', 'Prefect', 'Alexandria', 'also', 'dependent', 'Hypatia', 'advice', 'have', 'set', 'aside', 'rejection', 'past', 'Synesius', 'risen', 'position', 'Bishop', 'Davus', 'joined', 'Parabolani', 'Hypatia', 'teach', 'much', 'diminished', 'capacity', 'also', 'fervently', 'study', 'planets', 'movement', 'Little', 'realize', 'very', 'real', 'threat', 'posed', 'increasingly', 'militant', 'Christians', 'who', 'perceive', 'threat', 'paganism', 'influence', 'Prefect', 'Orestes', 'who', 'frequently', 'odds', 'Cyril.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'period', 'authentic', 'was', 'impressed', 'quality', 'sets', 'direction', 'acting', 'was', 'also', 'above', 'average', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'was', 'incredible', 'role', 'strong-willed', 'scholar', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'terms', 'being', 'respected', 'female', 'scholar', 'way', 'thought', 'not', 'only', 'astronomy', 'also', 'faith', 'one', 'insightful', 'dialogue', 'Hypatia', 'Synesius', 'do', 'not', 'question', 'beliefs', 'must', '.Is', 'movie', 'anti-Christian', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'think', 'events', 'based', 'sources', 'are', 'still', 'available', 'occurred', 'period', 'militant', 'Christians', 'black-robed', 'Parabolani', 'Jews', 'are', 'depicted', 'being', 'conflict', 'other', '-acts', 'stoning', 'abound', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'method', 'retaliation', 'time', 'More', 'interestingly', 'looked', 'movie', 'depicting', 'conflict', 'religion', 'science', 'age-old', 'conflict', 'day', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'take', 'faith', 'how', 'much', 'science', 'can', 'truly', 'explain', 'be', 'explained', 'Hypatia', 'theories', 'movement', 'planets', 'was', 'considered', 'blasphemous', 'Church', 'teachings', 'time', 'proved', 'theories', 'had', 'merit', 'prefer', 'think', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'drama', 'one', 'ponder', 'relationship', 'man', 'faith', 'science']",Agora
