It's the true story of an Indiana boy who has Spina Bifida and all he dreams about is winning a trophy in anything.  After several misshaps, he gets insterested in soap box racing and becomes successful at it.  The movie is not overly sentimental or sappy and is very truthful in how disabilities affect families.  It shows that no matter what, if you dream about something and work to make it happen, it will happen.  Another thing it teaches is that some people discriminate against those that have disabilities and that anyone, even a teenage boy can overcome those who discriminate.See it on the Disney Channel, Rent it on video or buy it for your own collection (I own it).",5,Great movie for everyone!!,1010620800,"01 10, 2002",2002,769,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'even', 'Disney', 'movie', ""'m"", '29', 'love', 'true', 'story', 'Indiana', 'boy', 'who', 'Spina', 'Bifida', 'about', 'winning', 'trophy', 'anything', 'several', 'misshaps', 'insterested', 'soap', 'box', 'racing', 'successful', 'movie', 'not', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'sappy', 'very', 'truthful', 'how', 'disabilities', 'affect', 'families', 'matter', 'what', 'dream', 'something', 'work', 'make', 'happen', 'will', 'happen', 'thing', 'people', 'discriminate', 'have', 'disabilities', 'anyone', 'even', 'teenage', 'boy', 'can', 'overcome', 'who', 'discriminate.See', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Rent', 'video', 'buy', 'own', 'collection', 'own']",Miracle in Lane 2 VHS

562966,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,B000050IMO,Kristopher Haines,"[7, 18]","I didn't expect much from &quot;Miracle in Lane 2&quot; Yet I checked my local lisitings every month or so hoping that I would see it soon. For no other reason than to laugh. Laugh at Disney's blindness. Only brainless executives could dream up a movie in which Frankie Muniz plays the wheel-chair bound protagonist. The same young actor who plays TV's Malcolm, whose family regularly uses Stevie (the show's wheelchair-bound character) as a comedic whipping boy.  Believe it or not, Muniz is the least of the movie's problems. Granted I am seventeen, do not watch the Disney channel, and I am certain that I am not included in the film's target audience. However that does not excuse the movie's shortcomings. I think that an older, more critical eye is just what this movie needs. Hopefully this review will stop parents from buying this video for their children, or sitting them in front of the TV to watch it re-run.  First, I do admit that I am aware that this movie was based on a true story, I have not researched the particulars and do not know how many of the film's events are true and which were created or embellished for &quot;dramatic appeal.&quot; With that said, I will try to keep my criticisms of Justin's character to a minimum.  Disney does it again, masterfully turning what could have been a decent story into a poorly done &quot;feel good&quot; family film. The most of obnoxious way this is done is through frequent journies into Justin's imagination. For example when his parents are debating whether or not to allow Justin to participate in summer league baseball the scene turns into a courtroom, his parents are opposing counsel, wearing judges wigs.  One notable exception to this is the scene in which Justin imagines that he actually gets a place on the team. The ball is hit and then is held in suspended animation, waiting for him to catch it. This is good for a laugh and is a clever way to demonstrate that baseball is perhaps not the best choice.  Next there is the use of the word &quot;cripple.&quot; I realize that the word is only used twice, once by a clearly evil character and once by Justin himself. The last time it is said is what worries me. Justin says something to the effect of &quot;Just because I'm a cripple doesn't mean that I'm an idiot.&quot; The word is not used in jest and it appears as if it is an acceptable term.  I use the term frequently but ALWAYS in jest. It is a bad term to use in a movie that is geared towards viewers as young as six, they might not be able to make the destinction.  The most insulting thing in the entire movie are the scenes in which Justin imagines that he is conversing with &quot;God&quot; A marshmellow roasting race car driver. The most insulting of these scences occurs when Justin asks if he will be &quot;perfect&quot; or cured in heaven. &quot;God&quot; unlocks a door to reveal a room full of people in angel-winged wheelchairs implying that they will forever have to live with being disabled. This is supposed to be a good thing? If this wasn't enough &quot;God&quot; wears a muscle shirt thar proclaims, &quot;I don't make mistakes.&quot; Implying that he intends for some us to be disabled.  If this is true than I'm going to expect a lot of explaining from whomever intended my legs not to work,my spine to be tilted eighty degrees, my hips slip out of their sockets, and my brain uncapable to drain fluid on it's own. And to further intend for me to stay that way even after I leave this world. As you can probably tell I'm disabled myself, and I don't think this movie sends as good of message as it intends......",1,One of the most condesending pieces of cinematic trash ever,983664000,"03 4, 2001",2001,3618,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'quot', 'Miracle', 'Lane', '2', 'quot', 'checked', 'local', 'lisitings', 'month', 'so', 'hoping', 'would', 'see', 'soon', 'other', 'reason', 'laugh', 'Laugh', 'Disney', 'blindness', 'Only', 'brainless', 'executives', 'could', 'dream', 'up', 'movie', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'wheel-chair', 'bound', 'protagonist', 'same', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'TV', 'Malcolm', 'family', 'regularly', 'Stevie', 'show', 'wheelchair-bound', 'character', 'comedic', 'whipping', 'boy', 'Believe', 'not', 'Muniz', 'least', 'movie', 'problems', 'Granted', 'am', 'seventeen', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'Disney', 'channel', 'am', 'certain', 'am', 'not', 'included', 'film', 'target', 'audience', 'However', 'not', 'excuse', 'movie', 'shortcomings', 'think', 'older', 'more', 'critical', 'eye', 'just', 'what', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'review', 'will', 'stop', 'parents', 'buying', 'video', 'children', 'sitting', 'front', 'TV', 'watch', 're-run', 'First', 'do', 'am', 'aware', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'have', 'not', 'researched', 'particulars', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'film', 'events', 'are', 'true', 'were', 'created', 'embellished', 'quot', 'dramatic', 'appeal.', 'quot', 'said', 'will', 'try', 'keep', 'criticisms', 'Justin', 'character', 'minimum', 'Disney', 'again', 'masterfully', 'turning', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'story', 'poorly', 'done', 'quot', 'feel', 'good', 'quot', 'family', 'film', 'most', 'obnoxious', 'way', 'done', 'frequent', 'journies', 'Justin', 'imagination', 'example', 'when', 'parents', 'are', 'debating', 'not', 'allow', 'Justin', 'participate', 'summer', 'league', 'baseball', 'scene', 'courtroom', 'parents', 'are', 'opposing', 'counsel', 'wearing', 'judges', 'wigs', 'One', 'notable', 'exception', 'scene', 'Justin', 'actually', 'place', 'team', 'ball', 'hit', 'then', 'held', 'suspended', 'animation', 'waiting', 'catch', 'good', 'laugh', 'clever', 'way', 'demonstrate', 'baseball', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'cripple.', 'quot', 'realize', 'word', 'only', 'used', 'twice', 'once', 'clearly', 'evil', 'character', 'once', 'Justin', 'last', 'time', 'said', 'what', 'Justin', 'something', 'effect', 'quot', 'Just', ""'m"", 'cripple', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'m"", 'idiot.', 'quot', 'word', 'not', 'used', 'jest', 'acceptable', 'term', 'use', 'term', 'frequently', 'ALWAYS', 'jest', 'bad', 'term', 'use', 'movie', 'geared', 'towards', 'viewers', 'as', 'young', 'six', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'destinction', 'most', 'insulting', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'Justin', 'conversing', 'quot', 'God', 'quot', 'A', 'marshmellow', 'roasting', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'most', 'insulting', 'scences', 'occurs', 'when', 'Justin', 'will', 'be', 'quot', 'perfect', 'quot', 'cured', 'heaven', 'quot', 'God', 'quot', 'door', 'reveal', 'room', 'full', 'people', 'angel-winged', 'wheelchairs', 'implying', 'will', 'forever', 'have', 'live', 'being', 'disabled', 'supposed', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'quot', 'God', 'quot', 'muscle', 'shirt', 'thar', 'proclaims', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistakes.', 'quot', 'Implying', 'be', 'disabled', 'true', ""'m"", 'going', 'expect', 'lot', 'explaining', 'whomever', 'intended', 'legs', 'not', 'work', 'spine', 'be', 'tilted', 'eighty', 'degrees', 'hips', 'slip', 'sockets', 'brain', 'uncapable', 'drain', 'fluid', 'own', 'further', 'intend', 'stay', 'way', 'even', 'leave', 'world', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', ""'m"", 'disabled', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'message']",Miracle in Lane 2 VHS
