JKS is a laid back dancer that just needs a warm place to stay for a while.  Enter the lady who has bad luck with all sorts of love dating disasters.  Her brother, who is friends with JKS, suggests that he bunk down with the sister.  She is no longer interested in love, but is willing to put up with a ""pet"".  So the agreement is made.  He greets her at the door with a smile & gratitude.  He is appreciative of her cooking & in her care of him.  BUT then things progress nicely.  He is still her pet, but she starts 'worrying' about how he is doing when she is not home, etc.Watch the movie THRU the credits....extra scenes are included.Enjoy!",5,JKS can be my pet anytime!,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,771,"['Jang', 'Keun', 'Geum', 'Suk', 'perfect', 'role', 'just', 'so', 'CUTE', 'smile', 'just', 'giggly', 'goosebumps', 'JKS', 'laid', 'back', 'dancer', 'just', 'warm', 'place', 'stay', 'while', 'Enter', 'lady', 'who', 'bad', 'luck', 'sorts', 'love', 'dating', 'disasters', 'brother', 'who', 'friends', 'JKS', 'bunk', 'down', 'sister', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'love', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'pet', 'agreement', 'made', 'door', 'smile', 'gratitude', 'appreciative', 'cooking', 'care', 'BUT', 'then', 'things', 'progress', 'nicely', 'still', 'pet', ""'worrying"", 'how', 'doing', 'when', 'not', 'home', 'etc.Watch', 'movie', 'THRU', 'credits', '.extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'included.Enjoy']","Be My Pet / You're My Pet Korean Movie Dvd (Kim Ha Neul, Jang Keun Suk) Based on Manga Kimi Wa Petto"

I like a lot of Korean movies and happen to think their film industry is first rate. However, I couldn't force myself to watch this to the end. The premise is so ridiculous, but I knew that going in. I was just giving it a chance, hoping somehow they could pull it off. Even if you're a 13 year old girl, I don't think there's any hope or redeeming qualities in this movie. Skip it.

Definitely geared to the younger generation. I miss the important spiritual messages that are in the older Korean films. I know someone mentioned that the male lead was hot but if you like your men looking like girls, then maybe. Overall, I kept telling myself how stupid it was especially during the first half of the film, almost turned it off but I always tend to hang in there.
