No matter what religion you are or what beliefs you have, I believe most people will come away from this very heartwarming dvd with an appreciation for  what really matters in life, a deeper understanding of what yoga is and where it comes from. It really makes you think about living a simpler=happier life.........I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.",5,Feel good and uplifting!,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,441,"['ended', 'up', 'watching', 'twice', 'there', 'was', 'so', 'much', '34', 'good', '34', 'matter', 'what', 'religion', 'are', 'what', 'have', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'dvd', 'appreciation', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'what', 'yoga', 'where', 'really', 'think', 'living', 'simpler=happier', 'life', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

We are all yogis. You don't have to go to India, you find out on your mat. Meet your mat daily. Even when you don't think it has anything for you that time, it does. Just go there. Listen, be intuned to your body. I'd still love to go to India just to have my feet on the soil, walk around in sandals and not think about the next alarm to be someplace doing nothing important.  Become a yogi. practice mindful meditation. It's not about poses or who can hold themselves upside down or to the side.  It's an enlightening journey will be on and there is no turning back. Trust Yoga. It will lead you. Watch this film and get your direction.

I rented it the first time while I had a mountain of laundry to fold lol, and was happy with it. Never expected to rent it again, but I found myself as weeks went by, wanting to remember what a certain yogi had said in the film, so I rented it again. Then the same thing happened again, and again lol. For me, the greatest value of this movie is most definitely all the insightful interviews with a variety of yoga experts. I really appreciated all of their comments. For me, Suzanne's personal story is simply a means to weaving all those in, and I'm grateful for it. I have recently started practicing and learning more about yoga and was interested in watching something more on the &#34;spiritual&#34; side of yoga at the time. I read some of the negative reviews on this and I can see where most of them are coming from, but those same things, even though I recognized them, just didn't bother me so I guess it's going to be up to each individual as to whether they are irritated by small things in the film or just pleased by the overall positive. I personally am very glad she made the film :). I enjoyed it.",5,"I've ""rented"" this 4 times lol.

It is a story told by as woman who experiences a profound grief after death of her mother to cancer.  It shows transformation of a successful professional journalist who lives in NYC, has great relationship with the man she loves, only to turn it all away and return to San Francisco so she can spend last days with her mother.  Grief is overwhelming and this woman turns to yoga as means of easing emotional pain but also finding a peace of mind and some sort of consolation over her loss.  Before long, she finds herself in India in search of a guru who can teach her how to overcome grief, sadness and find her new purpose in life.It is absolutely beautiful movie that talks about love, purpose, truth and other spiritual and moral questions without being highbrow or patronizing.  It is also an inspiring story about a woman who finds her way back to life and new her new purpose, career (psychology, nutrition) and passion for practice of yoga and meditation that puts her in touch with herself.  It is absolutely inspirational and transformational movie and regardless if one practices yoga or not, if one is interested in matters of spirituality and personal growth, this is one of the most wonderful films I would recommend to anyone.
