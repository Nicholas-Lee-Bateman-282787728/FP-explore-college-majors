1002555,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000GEIRVY,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","MOONLIGHTING started to stumble during Season Four, arguably it's weakest season in terms of writing and overall performance standard.  Things weren't helped by a long and messy writers' strike, and Cybill Shepherd's offscreen pregnancy limited the number of episodes she could appear in.The characters of Maddie (Cybill Shepherd) and David (Bruce Willis) consummated their long-held sexual tension during the penultimate episode of Season Three.  Given that writers chose to commit the ""cardinal sin"" of television writing by allowing that to happen, the bulk of Season Four's storylines fell on kooky receptionist Agnes DiPesto (Allyce Beasley) and her unlikely love interest, Herb (Curtis Armstrong).  Beasley and Armstrong provide a solid anchor for this season's action, but Willis and Shepherd's screen magic is sorely missed during some of the weaker episodes.Things returned to normal just in time for the fifth and final season, but fans of MOONLIGHTING should still enjoy this fourth chapter of magic, murder and mayhem.COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""A Trip to the Moon"" - It's been one month since detectives Maddie Hayes and David Addison revealed their feelings for one another - and their relationship is worse than ever.  Maddie has dreams that her life is a TV sitcom, while David receives imaginary advice from Ray Charles.""Come Back, Little Shiksa"" - When Maddie heads off for Chicago, David focuses all his energies on an impossible case: tracking down a mystery woman who left behind nothing except a single earring.""Take a Left at the Altar"" - As David tracks down a runaway groom, Maddie's parents must solve another mystery: What's the real reason their daughter came home?""Tale of Two Cities"" - David becomes increasingly frustrated with Maddie's absence and decides to return to his old partying, playboy lifestyle.""Cool Hand Dave (Parts 1 & 2)"" - When David learns that Maddie is pregnant, he desperately tries to catch a flight to Chicago to see her...and is tricked into switching identities with a wanted felon.  David's typically wacky stay in jail involves a botched break-out, a murderous guard, a full-scale prison riot and an outrageous musical number!""Father Knows Last"" - The Blue Moon Detective Agency faces financial ruin, the employees are striking and the furniture is being repossessed.  And as if David doesn't have enough problems - Maddie's father drops by to discuss his daughter's pregnancy.""Los Dos DiPestos"" - Ace secretary Miss DiPesto must solve a mystery of her very own: why are dangerous crooks pursuing her elderly mother?""Fetal Attraction"" - David's decision to prepare for the arrival of Maddie's baby has unintended consequences: he meets a pregnant woman who just might be his perfect match.""Tracks of My Tears"" - As Maddie finally heads back to Los Angeles, she begins to wonder if marriage and fatherhood will change everything that makes David special.""Eek! A Spouse!"" - When Maddie shows up at the office with her surprise new husband, everyone is confused by David's complete non-reaction.""Maddie Hayes Got Married"" - Maddie is frustrated by David's refusal to believe that she's really in love with Walter Bishop...and David offers to pay for a big church wedding so she can prove she means it.""Here's Living With You, Kid"" - Bored and lonely as he spends long nights guarding a top-secret grapefruit, Bert imagines his relationship with Agnes DiPesto as a topsy-turvy version of ""Casablanca"".""And the Flesh Was Made Word"" - David and Maddie finally reunite as partners to solve a case.

I was one of the few who was glad there were lot's of reruns during season three. I had not been a Moonlighting watcher from the begining, but was able to get a great overview during the 2nd half of the 3rd season. I had seen original episodes during seasons one, two and the first half of three from time to time. I always liked the show, however, I was only fifteen and it took a little time to suck me in. Most of the the die hards (No pun intended) were women or adult men who could relate to relationships. I finally got grapped for good when I realized that I wanted to be like David Addison. For that reason I enjoyed seaon four because it is all David all the Time. I became a huge Bruce Willis buff and when Blind Date and Die Hard came out during this time frame I knew he was going to be a superstar. At the end of the day the best Moonlightings are when it's David and Maddie doing what they do best, which is anything they did together. Nevetheless, even in those episodes it is Bruce Willis who carries the show. There is no way season four could have ended as high as # 12 in the Nelson ratings if Maddie had to be the focus of most of the episodes. Willis had personality that has proven to do him well in Hollywood as well. My daughter is only eight years old and she watches my sets of seasons one and two and my season three set. She loves Moonlighting but she wants to ""marry"" David Addison. She realizes he a fictional charcter and that the role Bruce is playing is from the 1980's, but she is infatuated, nonetheless. I find it very ironic that my teenage hero is my child's crush. That's the charisma of Bruce Willis but primarily in the role of David Addison. My wife thinks we are both crazy. My daughter gets a kick out of my terrible impersonation of David when I say things like ""Maddie, Maddie, Maddie"" and shout ""Yo Maddie!""  Moonlighting is great TV no matter what the season or the reason.  My daughter once said something to me that some dads might take offense to, but I didn't. She said ""Daddy I wish you were like David Addison"" I responded ""Me too Baby Doll, me too.""",4,I remember it well,1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2229,"['remember', 'season', 'four', 'very', 'well', 'plan', 'owning', 'other', 'reason', 'period', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'was', 'glad', 'were', 'lot', 'reruns', 'season', 'three', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Moonlighting', 'watcher', 'begining', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'great', 'overview', '2nd', 'half', '3rd', 'season', 'had', 'seen', 'original', 'episodes', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'first', 'half', 'three', 'time', 'time', 'always', 'liked', 'show', 'however', 'was', 'only', 'fifteen', 'took', 'little', 'time', 'suck', 'Most', 'die', 'hards', 'pun', 'intended', 'were', 'women', 'adult', 'men', 'who', 'could', 'relate', 'relationships', 'finally', 'got', 'grapped', 'good', 'when', 'realized', 'wanted', 'be', 'David', 'Addison', 'reason', 'enjoyed', 'seaon', 'four', 'David', 'Time', 'became', 'huge', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'buff', 'when', 'Blind', 'Date', 'Die', 'Hard', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'frame', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'superstar', 'end', 'day', 'best', 'Moonlightings', 'are', 'when', 'David', 'Maddie', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'anything', 'did', 'together', 'Nevetheless', 'even', 'episodes', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'show', 'way', 'season', 'four', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'as', 'high', '12', 'Nelson', 'ratings', 'Maddie', 'had', 'be', 'focus', 'most', 'episodes', 'Willis', 'had', 'personality', 'proven', 'do', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'only', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'sets', 'seasons', 'one', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'set', 'Moonlighting', 'marry', 'David', 'Addison', 'fictional', 'charcter', 'role', 'Bruce', 'playing', '1980', 'infatuated', 'nonetheless', 'find', 'very', 'ironic', 'teenage', 'hero', 'child', 'crush', 'charisma', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'primarily', 'role', 'David', 'Addison', 'wife', 'are', 'crazy', 'daughter', 'kick', 'terrible', 'impersonation', 'David', 'when', 'say', 'things', 'Maddie', 'Maddie', 'Maddie', 'Yo', 'Maddie', 'Moonlighting', 'great', 'TV', 'matter', 'what', 'season', 'reason', 'daughter', 'once', 'said', 'something', 'dads', 'might', 'take', 'offense', 'did', ""n't"", 'said', 'Daddy', 'wish', 'were', 'David', 'Addison', 'responded', 'Me', 'too', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'too']",N/A

There are some fun moments here and there, but they're pretty scarce overall; in fact, there are entire episodes where not one funny thing occurs or is said.  Most of the season consists of David and Maddie ruminating over their relationship's shortcomings, which gets old on the very first episode, but it continues.  For much of the season, Maddie is away with her parents, so some episodes show her with them and in others she does not appear at all.  The point, though, is that after the first episode David and Maddie are not in any scenes together until much later in the season.  Since the success and popularity of the show owed to the chemistry between the two of them, the tone of the show was altered immensely due to their lack of scenes together, and not for the better.  The producers of this show made the decision to send Maddie away temporarily in order to give Cybill Shepherd time off to have her child.  They could have handled that much more creatively, however, (maybe by delaying the production so D&M; wouldn't have to be separate) and you can easily see how the series suffered.  Overall it's quite dull, slow-paced and laugh-free.  Even when D&M; actually are together, the dialogue between them isn't as snappy and clever as before.  A lot of it consists of one character repeating the other's words (""I'm ambivalent about our relationship.""  ""Ambivalent?""  ""Yes, ambivalent.""  ""Well, I'm ambivalent about your ambivalence"" etc., etc., etc.) and that really drags. The writers weren't exactly giving it their all.There are a few good points, though, such as the ""Honeymooners"" homage in the first episode.  We get more DiPesto and Viola, both of whom I find charming.  And once you get to disc 3 (there are THREE discs to this set, not four as listed) things start to pick up.  The last episode of this season is actually quite charming, I think, and contains one of the best, funniest climactic chase scenes of the series altogether in my opinion.As for special features, the set just contains a few commentaries.  Those involved admit they made some poor decisions that damaged the show for its viewers.  So, again, there are some good moments in the first episode and near the end, but if you go for this season just know that you're in for a few nonsensical and uninteresting plotlines and a lot of depressing analyzing-of-one's-feelings that should belong on Dr. Phil (well, if the Dr. Phil show had existed then), not a fun, witty show like Moonlighting.",2,Slow-paced & Doesn't Stack Up to Seasons 1-3,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2592,"['got', 'hooked', 'show', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'had', 'watch', 'season', '4', 'bad', 'reputation', 'are', 'fun', 'moments', 'here', 'there', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'scarce', 'overall', 'fact', 'are', 'entire', 'episodes', 'where', 'not', 'one', 'funny', 'thing', 'occurs', 'said', 'Most', 'season', 'David', 'Maddie', 'ruminating', 'over', 'relationship', 'shortcomings', 'old', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'much', 'season', 'Maddie', 'away', 'parents', 'so', 'episodes', 'show', 'others', 'not', 'appear', 'point', 'first', 'episode', 'David', 'Maddie', 'are', 'not', 'scenes', 'together', 'much', 'later', 'season', 'success', 'popularity', 'show', 'owed', 'chemistry', 'two', 'tone', 'show', 'was', 'altered', 'immensely', 'due', 'lack', 'scenes', 'together', 'not', 'better', 'producers', 'show', 'made', 'decision', 'send', 'Maddie', 'away', 'temporarily', 'order', 'give', 'Cybill', 'Shepherd', 'time', 'have', 'child', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'that', 'much', 'more', 'creatively', 'however', 'maybe', 'delaying', 'production', 'so', 'D', 'M', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'separate', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'suffered', 'Overall', 'quite', 'dull', 'slow-paced', 'laugh-free', 'Even', 'when', 'D', 'M', 'actually', 'are', 'together', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'snappy', 'clever', 'before', 'lot', 'one', 'character', 'repeating', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'relationship', 'Ambivalent', 'Yes', 'ambivalent', 'Well', ""'m"", 'ambivalent', 'ambivalence', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'etc', 'really', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'giving', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'points', 'though', 'such', 'Honeymooners', 'homage', 'first', 'episode', 'get', 'more', 'DiPesto', 'Viola', 'whom', 'find', 'charming', 'once', 'get', 'disc', '3', 'are', 'THREE', 'discs', 'set', 'not', 'four', 'listed', 'things', 'start', 'pick', 'up', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'actually', 'quite', 'charming', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'funniest', 'climactic', 'chase', 'scenes', 'series', 'altogether', 'opinion.As', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'just', 'few', 'commentaries', 'involved', 'admit', 'made', 'poor', 'decisions', 'damaged', 'show', 'viewers', 'So', 'again', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'first', 'episode', 'end', 'go', 'season', 'just', 'know', ""'re"", 'few', 'nonsensical', 'uninteresting', 'plotlines', 'lot', 'depressing', ""analyzing-of-one's-feelings"", 'should', 'belong', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'well', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'show', 'had', 'existed', 'then', 'not', 'fun', 'witty', 'show', 'Moonlighting']",N/A

It was so new and different that the principals just couldn't control it well.  Take into consideration two volitile stars and two pregnancies.  Cybill's was with twins so it took her out of the show for most of the season.  Still it is a wonderful show and even a slower season is a great season.  I appreciate the fact that all the DVDs came out and are available on the market.  I personally don't feel that I ever loved a TV show more.  There was something about the connections of the two (four) stars that is caring and special.  Never has a show eluded so much warmth and love despite the craziness that was happening on the set.  This is not a bad season and it kept moving no matter what.

Which made the David character NOT caring about anything else & this was all he could think about.The pregnancy story then Maddie getting married to Walter (Dennis Dugan) after meeting him on a train.  The last line this character says was perfect after he & Maddie ended the quickie marriage.There were some good ideas in episodes which was normal for the show BUT it was these story lines that just brought the show down.A LOT of time on the Agnes & Burt (Hubert) to get through an episode.  Then the Burt fighting with fellow employee MacGillicudy.  Done too much.David crashing Maddie's car in the parking garage.  The garage Burt & MacGillicudy duel.MY favorite bit.  Disc 2 episode ""Cool Hand Dave Part 2"".  The bad guy who got David thrown in prison goes to stay at David's apartment.  Agnes & Burt go to find David but find this guy claiming to be David's cousin.  He tells them a story & they play Indiana Jones music.  Love that hearing the music.No extras other than commentary on SOME episodes.And, a SHORT season.So, we all know why this original show did not last more than 5 seasons.

1002573,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B000GEIRVY,Nicholas Carroll,"[5, 5]","This is the season that began the slump and eventual demise of ""Moonlighting."" After teasing viewers with the potential romance between David Addison and Maddie Hayes, the final shows of Season 3 finally got them between the sheets, which created a problem of having the sexual tension between them relieved. So, what does one do after that? Well, this season should be held as an example to all shows on what could happen if you tease audiences with sexual tension between two characters and have them finally give in and get together.The reason for the slump is because Maddie had, as Agnes Dipesto rightfully put it, de-Daved David Addison. Instead of the fun loving, often breaking into song, making the slightest sexist comment Dave that we loved, he became a love sick puppy. He spent most of the season sulking and depressed after Maddie left to spend the season with her folks in Chicago. Both of them reverted back to adolescence and thus why the show often sucked this season. It's like the writers couldn't figure out what to do with the characters after they had done the deed. Besides that, there were stories of Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd not getting along, so it's like the show accommodated them both by having them not work together. In the end, fans of the show suffered for it.However, all is not lost. I'm a true fan of the show and own all three DVD sets. This season does have a few gems worthy of the ""Moonlighting"" brand: a peppy guest appearance with Ray Charles, a two-parter where David Addison goes off to jail, which allows him to play his antics with a new group of people, we get to see Burt Viola in drag as well as serenade his love Agnes DiPesto with a strangely appealing version of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" (hilarious!), and the episode in which David and Maddie are turned into clay-mation figures. Those are the highlights. But all in all, this show turned towards second fiddles Burt and Agnes romance, and they simply weren't meant for the spotlight.Although they can't rewrite Season 4 to make it as good as Seasons 2 and 3, this set is still worth owning for any ""Moonlighting"" fan. Even when it was bad, it was still better than most shows in the 1980s. I'm glad to have it as part of my collection.",4,The Series slump!,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2253,"['season', 'began', 'slump', 'eventual', 'demise', 'Moonlighting', 'teasing', 'viewers', 'potential', 'romance', 'David', 'Addison', 'Maddie', 'Hayes', 'final', 'shows', 'Season', '3', 'finally', 'got', 'sheets', 'created', 'problem', 'having', 'sexual', 'tension', 'relieved', 'So', 'what', 'one', 'do', 'Well', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'example', 'shows', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'tease', 'audiences', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'finally', 'give', 'get', 'together.The', 'reason', 'slump', 'Maddie', 'had', 'Agnes', 'Dipesto', 'rightfully', 'put', 'de-Daved', 'David', 'Addison', 'Instead', 'fun', 'loving', 'often', 'breaking', 'song', 'making', 'slightest', 'sexist', 'comment', 'Dave', 'loved', 'became', 'love', 'sick', 'puppy', 'spent', 'most', 'season', 'sulking', 'depressed', 'Maddie', 'left', 'spend', 'season', 'folks', 'Chicago', 'reverted', 'back', 'adolescence', 'thus', 'why', 'show', 'often', 'sucked', 'season', 'writers', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'characters', 'had', 'done', 'deed', 'were', 'stories', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Cybil', 'Shepherd', 'not', 'getting', 'along', 'show', 'accommodated', 'having', 'not', 'work', 'together', 'end', 'fans', 'show', 'suffered', 'it.However', 'not', 'lost', ""'m"", 'true', 'fan', 'show', 'own', 'three', 'DVD', 'sets', 'season', 'have', 'few', 'gems', 'Moonlighting', 'brand', 'peppy', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'two-parter', 'where', 'David', 'Addison', 'jail', 'play', 'antics', 'new', 'group', 'people', 'get', 'see', 'Burt', 'Viola', 'drag', 'as', 'well', 'serenade', 'love', 'Agnes', 'DiPesto', 'strangely', 'appealing', 'version', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'Sexual', 'Healing', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'David', 'Maddie', 'are', 'turned', 'clay-mation', 'figures', 'are', 'highlights', 'show', 'turned', 'towards', 'second', 'fiddles', 'Burt', 'Agnes', 'romance', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'meant', 'spotlight.Although', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rewrite', 'Season', '4', 'make', 'as', 'good', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'set', 'still', 'worth', 'owning', 'Moonlighting', 'fan', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'shows', '1980s', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'part', 'collection']",N/A
1002574,AEGQWVR6KWBV,B000GEIRVY,"Ron Cronovich ""Ron""","[42, 44]","Season 4 may be the show's weakest season.  Yet, it gets unfairly panned.  It stands up fairly well after 20 years.After Season 3, which most fans and critics consider the best of all 5 seasons, the expectations for Season 4 were extremely and unfairly high.  Also, Cybill Sheperd's pregnancy kept her from putting in more than a few cameos for several months, and a Hollywood strike disrupted many network shows.  As a result, Season 4 was short (only 14 episodes), had long gaps between new episodes, and had too many episodes in which David and/or Maddie had very little screen time.  Which meant an increased presence of Herbert Viola and Miss DiPesto, something that not all fans thought was consistently a good thing.Despite these obstacles, Season 4 managed to bring some of that Moonlighting magic that fans love, and remains better than most television, despite being perhaps the weakest season of Moonlighting.Season 4 continued the Moonlighting tradition of lots of great music and great guest stars, including:  Ray Charles, Dr Joyce Brothers, John Goodman, Pat Boone, and Terry O'Quinn (the guy that plays John Locke on ""Lost"").In a very strong episode, David butts heads with Maddie's overprotective father, well-played by Robert Webber, who was in the original ""12 Angry Men"", and a guest on such shows as Rockford Files, Outer Limits (the original), Ironside, and Kojak.Another great Season 4 episode is ""Fetal Attraction"", in which David takes a Lamaze class with foxy future single mom Brooke Adams (who was also in Frasier, Thirtysomething, Kojak, Police Woman, and the Lords of Flatbush).  David is doing this so he can be there for Maddie, who in Chicago is oblivious to his sacrifice; meanwhile, the healthy way David and Brooke Adams's character get along is such an amazing contrast to the rocky roller-coaster relationship David has with Maddie.  Great episode!Serious fans and completists will want to pick up the Season 4 DVD set.
