I didn't realize just how terrific the series was until its release on dvd and watching it from an adult perspective. I've been watching the hour episodes on Encore Western channel as well, when Chester was still a character on the show (Dennis Weaver left in 1964) and these early episodes are uncompromising in their outcome. Likeable characters are often killed. You just never know what is going to be the outcome of a particular situation. John Meston and Kathleen Hite are two writers who have been responsible for many of these outstanding pre-1965 Gunsmokes. The chemistry among the cast (Matt, Kitty, Doc, Chester) is perfection. I agree with everyone that all subsequent seasons should have been released as one volume like season 1. Since they're not, I'll pay the price.

1370510,ANUJUFRP6RNA2,B003XEKXYI,O'Dryden,"[3, 3]","Season 4 of Gunsmoke ran from the fall of 1958 to the spring of 1959. By this time, Gunsmoke was the number 1 show in America and for good reason. Season 4 is just as good as the first three. This is just not a good western show, it is excellent drama. The stories are believable, the characters are realistic, the production values are superb, and the guest stars without equal. Every episode displays the reality of human nature - greed, anger, and dishonesty. Marshall Dillon and his right hand man Chester work tirelessly to bring law and order to the city of Dodge and justice to the victims. There is not a weak episode in this package. This is the only series I have watched where I would give every episode 5 stars. The brutality in some of the episodes is hard watch but in true Gunsmoke form, Marshall Dillon gets to the bottom of the issue and the outlaws get what they deserve - a six foot plot of ground on Boot Hill cemetery or time behind bars. What I like about the show is that the main characters have their imperfections as well. Sometimes they make mistakes and let their emotions get the best of them. The one thing that stands out in season 4 of Gunsmoke is the belief that the wild west was no place for a weak and passive man. If you didn't own a gun and know how to use it, you were raw meat for the outlaws and less scrupulous citizens of the Kansas plains.  Although the show is very clean and can be watched by all family members you need to decide if your child is old enough to handle the brutality and violence in the show. For example, one episode is about an old man who wants to raise sheep. The cattle men in the area don't like sheep ranchers so they decide to run him off his land. They first shot all his sheep. They then burn down his house. Finally, they tie a rope around the old man and drag him behind a horse which almost kills him. During this whole ordeal the old man - who doesn't own a gun - never defends himself because he does not believe in violence. He refuses to tell Marshall Dillon who his tormentors are. In the end good prevails but it is hard to watch the story play out. With that being said, I think Gunsmoke is the best television show ever created.

Gunsmoke was so well written and the actors were so good at their character portrayals. This series was good from the very first season but I am finding that it gets even better each season!!! James Arness's portrayal of Matt Dillon was an inspiration to all who watched and his off screen conduct and respectability was equal to his on screen character. I had written a previous review on another season and joined others in complaining about the high price and slow release of these. I still would like to see them released a little faster (at the present rate DVD's will be a thing of the past before they get through all of the series) however after dividing the price of the DVD by the 39 episodes per season I have concluded that the price for this quality of entertainment is a steal compared to my monthly satellite TV bill!!
