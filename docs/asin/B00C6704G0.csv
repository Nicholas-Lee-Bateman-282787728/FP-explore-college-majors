Basically Brendan is having marriage troubles and, as a mechanic, can only think to get his hands professionally cleaned by a manicurist, Tam, as a possible solution.  He confides in her and she offers suggestions.  I started to get confused because I thought a line was going to be crossed, which one was, kind of, but not really.  Anyway the story shows how their interaction affects their personal lives.  The acting is OK.  I felt that the actress who plays Tam is a little too expressionless for me. Since she basically has the same expression for happiness, sadness, and anger, I couldn't really tell what she is supposed to be conveying in a scene.  I had to insert how I'd feel in that situation.  That was kind of frustrating.  But the overall story itself is still decent.  I'd watch it again.",4,Good,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,889,"['interesting', 'movie', 'kind', 'slow', 'moving', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Basically', 'Brendan', 'having', 'marriage', 'troubles', 'mechanic', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'get', 'hands', 'professionally', 'cleaned', 'manicurist', 'Tam', 'possible', 'solution', 'suggestions', 'started', 'get', 'confused', 'thought', 'line', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'crossed', 'one', 'was', 'kind', 'not', 'really', 'Anyway', 'story', 'how', 'interaction', 'personal', 'lives', 'acting', 'OK', 'felt', 'actress', 'who', 'Tam', 'little', 'too', 'expressionless', 'basically', 'same', 'expression', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'anger', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'conveying', 'scene', 'had', 'insert', 'how', ""'d"", 'feel', 'situation', 'was', 'kind', 'frustrating', 'overall', 'story', 'still', 'decent', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again']",Touch

1642703,A10BWW5GU19AD,B00C6704G0,Jeff Wiley,"[3, 5]","Brendan (portrayed by John Ruby) is a mechanic desperate to save his failing marriage. He visits a nail salon, where he meets Tam (portrayed by Porter Lynn), a shy new employee who offers guidance upon Brendan's request. Along the way, their unexpected friendship provides some welcome revelations, and takes both of them as well as those around them in directions unforeseen. This is crux of 'Touch'.Directed by Minh Duc Nguyen, 'Touch' offers some of the best metaphor usage I have ever seen in a a movie. The multi-edged meaning of the film's title displays itself over and over. While the acting was above average by the mostly Vietnamese cast, Porter Lynn as Tam is a breakout star waiting to happen. As the reserved manicurist, she often communicates without saying much at all. This truly was a tour de force for her, and I look forward to see what the future holds for her. The screenwriters weave an intricate allegory that will keep you thinking about the movie long after you've stopped watching it.'Touch' is a unique, emotionally complex narrative that will keep its audience engaged from beginning to end.

I get the premise - touch is essential to our well-being but I think this woman's need for touch was excessive.  Felt more like a fetish of some sort rather than sensual as some reviews indicate.  Sure, there was some disfunction in her childhood courtesy of her father's apparent aversion to it but it still seemed over the top. If I had a kid who had to cling to my bare leg I'd be worried too.  It was just way too slow-moving with an ending that indicated some closure but what exactly I don't know.  Maybe I was too tired to fully appreciate it but I don't think it would've been anymore scintillating in the light of day. The interactions with her coworkers were by far the most interesting.
