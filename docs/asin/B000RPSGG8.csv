I rented it on an impulse on one of those days when nothing seemed available at the video store....and am so glad I did.From an opening sequence suggesting that the ending is a foregone conclusion to the introduction of characters who make intense first impressions as two-dimensional stereotypes, ""The Unseen"" gradually shifts to a tension-filled tale packed with character study and action often as much psychological as physical.  The plot moves more or less methodically, gathering in strength and intensity as it leads to its climax (a few murky moments are my only quibble).  Tension builds, matters come to a head....and when the payoff comes, it's most definitely Not What It Seems time.  Expect a couple of surprises, perhaps more, depending on how much thought you've given to each character.  None, it seems, are what the viewer has assumed they were through the entire film....a truly eerie experience which remains with me long after the final fadeout.  As to what ""The Unseen"" is....well, you'll see...or perhaps not.This is not a ""happily ever after"" movie--indeed, the ending leaves several matters troublingly (and possibly deliberately) unresolved.  There are a few echoes of William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren, but this is very much a story of the here and now, a tale of the prejudices of its audience as much as those of its characters.  If you let them get in the way, chances are you won't get through this film--and that would be a true shame.No director in recent memory has accomplished so much with a camera, simple location filming and perhaps a dozen actors.  A monument perhaps to the power of economy in the hands of a capable artist.",4,"A Thinking Person's ""Deliverance""?",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,1765,"['movie', 'starring', 'one', ""'d"", 'ever', 'heard', 'written', 'unknown', 'directed', 'unknown', 'rented', 'impulse', 'one', 'days', 'when', 'nothing', 'seemed', 'available', 'video', 'store', '.and', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did.From', 'opening', 'sequence', 'suggesting', 'ending', 'foregone', 'conclusion', 'introduction', 'characters', 'who', 'make', 'intense', 'first', 'impressions', 'two-dimensional', 'stereotypes', 'Unseen', 'gradually', 'tension-filled', 'tale', 'packed', 'character', 'study', 'action', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'psychological', 'physical', 'plot', 'more', 'less', 'methodically', 'gathering', 'strength', 'intensity', 'climax', 'few', 'murky', 'moments', 'are', 'only', 'quibble', 'Tension', 'builds', 'matters', 'come', 'head', '.and', 'when', 'payoff', 'most', 'definitely', 'Not', 'What', 'time', 'Expect', 'couple', 'surprises', 'perhaps', 'more', 'depending', 'how', 'much', 'thought', ""'ve"", 'given', 'character', 'None', 'are', 'what', 'viewer', 'assumed', 'were', 'entire', 'film', 'truly', 'eerie', 'experience', 'long', 'final', 'fadeout', 'what', 'Unseen', '.well', ""'ll"", 'see', 'perhaps', 'not.This', 'not', 'happily', 'ever', 'movie', 'indeed', 'ending', 'several', 'matters', 'troublingly', 'possibly', 'deliberately', 'unresolved', 'are', 'few', 'echoes', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Robert', 'Penn', 'Warren', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'here', 'now', 'tale', 'prejudices', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'shame.No', 'director', 'recent', 'memory', 'accomplished', 'so', 'much', 'camera', 'simple', 'location', 'filming', 'perhaps', 'dozen', 'actors', 'monument', 'perhaps', 'power', 'economy', 'hands', 'capable', 'artist']","The Unseen, the movie"

Lawrence ""velasupernova""","[11, 12]","As a long time fan of Gale Harold's, it's been a privilege to watch him develop into an amazing actor.And quite fascinating to watch Mr. Harold portray a racist, confederate flag waving redneck, since the film character represents the polar opposite of Mr. Harold's personal views.Powerful story, beautiful cinematography.

Sad story - nobody won in the end but, as with his Queer as Folk role, Gale was not afraid to take on a difficult topic.  It was funny to see Michelle Clunie acting with him in a totally different roll.  The other actors made this whole story believeable.  I found myself laughing in some parts and actually crying in others.
