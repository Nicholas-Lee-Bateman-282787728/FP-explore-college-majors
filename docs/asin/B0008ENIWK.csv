Kirstie Alley plays herself with such a great sense of humor. She is as funny as she has ever been and has a supporting cast that absolutely shines. Rachel Harris plays Kevyn, Kirstie's friend/assistant, and regualrly steals the scenes she is in. Bryan Callen, from MadTV, plays another friend/assistant of Kirstie. I never really cared for him on MadTV but he is very well cast in this series. The guest stars are many and they are very well used, from Kelly Preston to Kid Rock to Leah Remini.The plot is basically Kirstie battling her weight and trying to get back on TV. In the same vein as ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" Kirstie has multiple social blunders per episode. Her blunders are very overstated (for lack of a better word) and can lie outside the realm of believability which is my only complaint. Even so, the scenarios are quite funny if not believable.",4,What an underrated show!,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1106,"['watching', 'first', 'season', 'seven', 'episodes', 'am', 'disappointed', 'show', 'never', 'caught', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny.This', 'show', 'basically', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'only', 'instead', 'avuncular', 'bald', 'Jew', 'have', 'fat', 'actress', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'as', 'funny', 'ever', 'been', 'supporting', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'Rachel', 'Harris', 'Kevyn', 'Kirstie', 'friend/assistant', 'regualrly', 'steals', 'scenes', 'Bryan', 'Callen', 'MadTV', 'friend/assistant', 'Kirstie', 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'MadTV', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'series', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'used', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'Leah', 'Remini.The', 'plot', 'basically', 'Kirstie', 'battling', 'weight', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'TV', 'same', 'vein', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'Kirstie', 'multiple', 'social', 'blunders', 'episode', 'blunders', 'are', 'very', 'overstated', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'can', 'lie', 'realm', 'believability', 'only', 'complaint', 'Even', 'so', 'scenarios', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'believable']",Fat Actress - The Complete First Season

898863,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0008ENIWK,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","When Hollywood branded her as just another overweight and unemployable star, Kirstie Alley hit back with her very own television series.  FAT ACTRESS revolves around a somewhat-fictionalised Kirstie as she battles and schemes to reinvent herself in fame and in life.FAT ACTRESS is a great show, because it features Kirstie Alley playing an alternate version of her own persona, plus a range of guest stars who aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves.  Much of the dialogue was improvised, which gives a freshness to the episodes.The main characters in FAT ACTRESS are Kirstie, her personal assistant Eddie Falcone (Bryan Callen), hairdresser Kevyn (Rachael Harris); and diet guru Quinn Taylor-Scott (Kelly Preston), who eats Kleenex tissues.COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:""Big Butts"" - Kirstie forces her agent to set up a meeting with NBC president Jeff Zucker; and after a steamy night with one of his executives, manages to get a holding deal.  Guest starring John Travolta, Jeff Zucker, Mark Curry and Michael McDonald.""Charlie's Angels"" - Bloated to the point of violent diarrhea after swallowing a series of laxatives and caffeine, Kirstie attends a meeting with ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG.; whilst Eddie decides to stalk Carmen Electra.  Guest starring Kid Rock, Edie McClurg, Carmen Electra, and Melissa Gilbert.""Holy Lesbo, Batman!"" - Desperate to meet Gwen Stefani, Kirstie plots to intercept her regular afternoon walk, only to wind up being arrested in a gay pick-up sting.  Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Kevin Nealon, and Mo Collins.""The Koi Effect"" - After being embarrassed on the street by Leah Remini, Kirstie decides to take drastic measures in her dieting.  With a new method, Kirstie surrounds herself with small people and things, and turns her mansion into ""Tiny Town"".  Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Wallace Shawn, and Leah Remini.""Crack for Good"" - Kirstie's crackhead brother arrives for a visit, just as Kirstie is trying to get a free kitchen makeover on ""Oprah"".  Guest starring Connie Stevens, Christopher McDonald, Geoffrey Lewis, and Larry King.""Crybaby McGuire"" - Kirstie's new man is just a little bit too sensitive, as she and her assistants discover during a weekend getaway.  Guest starring Bill Smitrovich and Merv Griffin.""Hold This"" - With her holding deal about to expire, Kirstie will stoop to new depths...  Guest starring Jeff Zucker and Rhea Perlman.FAT ACTRESS is a side-splitting comedy series that will be remembered for a very long time.  Kirstie Alley gives a fearless performance that sees her into some very graphic and confronting material, yet she still manages to be the same loveable Kirstie that endeared her to ""Cheers"" and ""Veronica's Closet"".  The supporting cast is first-rate, especially Kelly Preston as the Botox-lipped Quinn; and Mayim Bialik (TV's ""Blossom"") will surprise you with her cutting self-parody.The DVDs include bonus audio commentaries and cast biography pages.",4,wild and wicked Hollywood satire,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,2935,"['When', 'Hollywood', 'branded', 'as', 'just', 'overweight', 'unemployable', 'star', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'hit', 'back', 'very', 'own', 'television', 'series', 'FAT', 'ACTRESS', 'around', 'somewhat-fictionalised', 'Kirstie', 'schemes', 'reinvent', 'fame', 'life.FAT', 'ACTRESS', 'great', 'show', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'playing', 'alternate', 'version', 'own', 'persona', 'range', 'guest', 'stars', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'poke', 'fun', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'was', 'improvised', 'freshness', 'episodes.The', 'main', 'characters', 'FAT', 'ACTRESS', 'are', 'Kirstie', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Eddie', 'Falcone', 'Bryan', 'Callen', 'hairdresser', 'Kevyn', 'Rachael', 'Harris', 'diet', 'guru', 'Quinn', 'Taylor-Scott', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'who', 'Kleenex', 'tissues.COMPLETE', 'EPISODE', 'LISTING', 'Big', 'Butts', 'Kirstie', 'agent', 'set', 'up', 'meeting', 'NBC', 'president', 'Jeff', 'Zucker', 'steamy', 'night', 'one', 'executives', 'get', 'holding', 'deal', 'Guest', 'starring', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Jeff', 'Zucker', 'Mark', 'Curry', 'Michael', 'McDonald', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Bloated', 'point', 'violent', 'diarrhea', 'swallowing', 'series', 'laxatives', 'caffeine', 'Kirstie', 'meeting', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'director', 'McG', 'Eddie', 'stalk', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'Holy', 'Lesbo', 'Batman', 'Desperate', 'meet', 'Gwen', 'Stefani', 'Kirstie', 'intercept', 'regular', 'afternoon', 'walk', 'only', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'arrested', 'gay', 'pick-up', 'sting', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'Mo', 'Collins', 'Koi', 'Effect', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'street', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'Kirstie', 'take', 'drastic', 'measures', 'dieting', 'new', 'method', 'Kirstie', 'small', 'people', 'things', 'mansion', 'Tiny', 'Town', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'Crack', 'Good', 'Kirstie', 'crackhead', 'brother', 'visit', 'just', 'Kirstie', 'trying', 'get', 'free', 'kitchen', 'makeover', 'Oprah', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Connie', 'Stevens', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'Geoffrey', 'Lewis', 'Larry', 'King', 'Crybaby', 'McGuire', 'Kirstie', 'new', 'man', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'sensitive', 'assistants', 'discover', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'Hold', 'holding', 'deal', 'expire', 'Kirstie', 'will', 'stoop', 'new', 'depths', 'Guest', 'starring', 'Jeff', 'Zucker', 'Rhea', 'Perlman.FAT', 'ACTRESS', 'side-splitting', 'comedy', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'fearless', 'performance', 'very', 'graphic', 'confronting', 'material', 'still', 'be', 'same', 'loveable', 'Kirstie', 'endeared', 'Cheers', 'Veronica', 'Closet', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Botox-lipped', 'Quinn', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'TV', 'Blossom', 'will', 'surprise', 'cutting', 'self-parody.The', 'DVDs', 'include', 'bonus', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'biography', 'pages']",Fat Actress - The Complete First Season

But with great writing, an excellent cast, and Kirstie Alley anchoring the show with still-strong comedic instincts, this has turned out to be one of TV's better comedies.A strong supporting cast really helps this show, with Rachael Harris and Bryan Callen both providing excellent foils for Alley.  Kelly Preston has a small but funny recurring role, and their are some hilarious guest turns - I especially enjoyed Kevin Nealon's turn as a Specter-esque producer, and Bill Smitrovich as an emotional suitor to Alley.The first episode is the weakest of the bunch, but that's likely because it had to be used to set up the rest of the season and to introduce the players.  After that, the show quickly begins to arc sharply upward, and there are some truly hilarious and memorable scenes in each episode.  It would have been nice to have more than 7 episodes, but I have to credit HBO with never trying to squeeze too much out of a show.If you like Kirstie Alley, and if you're a fan of other semi-reality comedies like Curb, you're sure to enjoy this show.

As soon as I read the back of it I started laughing so hard everyone was looking at me. I knew I had to get it.To state the obvious Kirstie Alley is one of the funniest ladies of television of all time. It does not really matter how much weight she gains, she is as beautiful as ever and funnier then ever.As the title of the show suggests, it revolves around Kirstie being a fat actress in Hollywood. From the first episode, which starts with her getting on a scale and throwing herself on the floor screaming and sobbing, till the last one which ends with her saying ""As god is my witness I'll never be fat again"" this show is funny, funny, funny. She has taken her real life experiences and has created most honest, in-your-face comedy I've seen in a long time. Put in a mix all of her Hollywood friends as guests on a show and you've got one entertaining show. I did as one of the reviewers suggested and watched all 7 of them in one afternoon, it was that good. Writing is great; show unfolds very naturally as if you were watching real life.

I've always liked Kirstie Alley, and after seeing this all-too-brief first season, appreciate her even more. Like another wonderful, mostly-improvised show, HBO's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, this one follows Alley's plight as she tries to rebuild a sagging (no pun intended) career and wrestle with her considerable weight problem. (How brilliant to create a character that is at once bigger than life and yet who suffers some of the same demons we all deal with.) Take note, also, of some of the camera angles that go out of the way to show Alley at her worst, and you appreciate how brave she was to do this comedy about her shortcomings. Add in some very funny situations and excellent ensemble support, and you have a show that will make you laugh out loud time and again. (In one episode, she starts dating an older billionaire who turns out to have a quirky, over-emotional personality. I laughed so hard at actor Bill Smitrovich's star turn as the billionaire that I think I hurt myself. In another equally funny episode, Wallace Shawn plays Dr. Sigmund von Oy, whose theories Alley embraces in an attempt to try anything that might remotely help her lose weight.) It seems that this first season and its seven episodes will probably be the extent of this show; once Alley's weight is fully off the show won't play particularly well. Meanwhile, we  have these seven in which a fifty-something actress fighting the pounds shows us the flip side of glamour, and makes us realize even the rich and famous suffer the same challenges we all do.

The show premiered to very high ratings earlier this year. The show includes cameos from a virtual who's who in Hollywood. Guest stars include Kid Rock, Carmen Electra, John Travolta, Leah Remini and more. One very special guest star is Mayim Bialik--yes Blossom from NBC's series Blossom. Bialik hasn't been seen on television in awhile and she really shows her acting chops as Kirstie's bitchy neighbor who beds one of her friends.This show is so funny you really will sit down and possibly watch the entire season in one afternoon. The ratings for Fat Actress slipped a bit after the shows debut, but I hope that Showtime brings back the show for another season.

She simply lampoons herself in an (allegedly) unscripted parody of her (allegedly) real life.  It works.  Surrounded by unprofessional and `quick-buck' Hollywood sleazebags, Kirstie serves up some delicious moments.  Every episode works, but some standouts are her family (a drunk father, a ditzy mother, and a crack addict brother).  He tries to convince her that loosing weight with crack is the way to go, instead of having Oprah redo her kitchen.  Another knockout episode has her cavorting with `little people' in `little houses' as a way to get small by ""thinking"" small.  It's so weird, it hilarious.  Don't forget about the episode where she takes the advice of Kelly Preston (as a real bitch weight loss guru) and consumes too many laxatives and has to have a lunch meeting with some executives.  The bathroom scenes are hilarious (""Oh!  You're Kirstie Alley!  Will you sign my baby's Diaper?"").  Now it seems she will supplement her income by working for Jenny Craig.

898878,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0008ENIWK,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[1, 1]","Kirstie Alley is such a wonderful comic actress: from Cheers to the Look Who's Talking movies, to Veronica's Closet, to Drop Dead Gorgeous, as well a number of other, smaller roles, she's shown us all time and again that she's more than capable of delivering the laughs. Also, she's an extremely likeable sort of screen presence, she's got a beautiful sort of vulnerability that alternates with a hard-as-nails bitchiness that's a joy to watch. I was looking very much forward to the release of 'Fat Actress', a pseudo-documentary style show that showcases Alley's current weight-and-career-related nightmares.Starring alongside Alley are Rachael Harris as Kevyn Shecket, a quirky and shrill personal assistant, and Bryan Callen as Eddie Falcon, Alley's put-upon male secretary. As an ensemble, this trio works extremely well together, their charisma and zeitgeisty carrying-on is hugely suited to this style of show. Also, there's a huge and expansive roster of cameo appearances by more professionally fortunate actors - John Travolta, Mayim Bialik, Kid Rock, McG, Edie McLurg, Leah Remini and Carmen Electra, to name but a few. Also, some of the plots are essentially very funny - Kirstie tries a bizarre 'think smaller' diet, Kirstie's drug-and-alcohol addicted family shows up while she's waiting for Oprah's TV Crew, she's given the Hope diamond by a needy billionaire, and gets thrown in jail for being caught cruising with a group of gay men - one of whom is her ex-lover.So why didn't 'Fat Actress' work, then? Lousy writing, I think. For every solid, belly-laugh joke, there's a number of totally unfunny one-liners and situations. Also, there's an odd lack of decisiveness about the show - the first two episodes could be reality television, but subsequent episodes just come off as mundane sitcom. All the charisma in the world couldn't have saved the final two epsidoes from unfunny mediocrity.And it's truly a shame, this could have been such a wonderful series, had the producers stuck to the foulmouthed fly-on-the-wall style of the first few episodes. It's sad - albeit unsurprising - that this was cancelled, but if you're an Alley fan, or simply curious about this show, I can recommend this for purchase, for no other reason than to own a genuine television curio.Come back soon, Kirstie!",3,"31/2 Stars for Great Potential, some funny moments",1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,2308,"['Kirstie', 'Alley', 'such', 'wonderful', 'comic', 'actress', 'Cheers', 'Look', 'Who', 'Talking', 'movies', 'Veronica', 'Closet', 'Drop', 'Dead', 'Gorgeous', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'other', 'smaller', 'roles', 'shown', 'time', 'again', 'more', 'capable', 'delivering', 'laughs', 'Also', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'sort', 'screen', 'presence', 'got', 'beautiful', 'sort', 'vulnerability', 'hard-as-nails', 'bitchiness', 'joy', 'watch', 'was', 'looking', 'very', 'much', 'forward', 'release', ""'Fat"", 'Actress', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'show', 'Alley', 'current', 'weight-and-career-related', 'nightmares.Starring', 'Alley', 'are', 'Rachael', 'Harris', 'Kevyn', 'Shecket', 'quirky', 'shrill', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Bryan', 'Callen', 'Eddie', 'Falcon', 'Alley', 'put-upon', 'male', 'secretary', 'ensemble', 'trio', 'extremely', 'well', 'together', 'charisma', 'zeitgeisty', 'carrying-on', 'hugely', 'suited', 'style', 'show', 'Also', 'huge', 'expansive', 'roster', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'more', 'professionally', 'fortunate', 'actors', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Mayim', 'Bialik', 'Kid', 'Rock', 'McG', 'Edie', 'McLurg', 'Leah', 'Remini', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'name', 'few', 'Also', 'plots', 'are', 'essentially', 'very', 'funny', 'Kirstie', 'bizarre', 'smaller', 'diet', 'Kirstie', 'drug-and-alcohol', 'addicted', 'family', 'up', 'waiting', 'Oprah', 'TV', 'Crew', 'given', 'Hope', 'diamond', 'needy', 'billionaire', 'thrown', 'jail', 'being', 'caught', 'cruising', 'group', 'gay', 'men', 'one', 'whom', 'ex-lover.So', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", ""'Fat"", 'Actress', 'work', 'then', 'Lousy', 'writing', 'think', 'solid', 'belly-laugh', 'joke', 'number', 'totally', 'unfunny', 'one-liners', 'situations', 'Also', 'odd', 'lack', 'decisiveness', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'reality', 'television', 'subsequent', 'episodes', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'mundane', 'sitcom', 'charisma', 'world', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'saved', 'final', 'two', 'epsidoes', 'unfunny', 'mediocrity.And', 'truly', 'shame', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'series', 'had', 'producers', 'stuck', 'foulmouthed', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'style', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'sad', 'unsurprising', 'was', 'cancelled', ""'re"", 'Alley', 'fan', 'simply', 'curious', 'show', 'can', 'recommend', 'purchase', 'other', 'reason', 'own', 'genuine', 'television', 'curio.Come', 'back', 'soon', 'Kirstie']",Fat Actress - The Complete First Season

She is still very beautiful, and her voice is still so sexy and funny.I was really looking forward to this and I have just watched 2 eps. It is very funny, some scenese stand out, like the beginning of the second one when she tries to find her fat pants LOLBut often, it is so cruel I feel sorry for her, so much fun is being made of her weight that I feel sorry for her, she doesn't deserve it. I feel bad for her like when in the future, maybe when she's lost all the weight, she'll look back at this, and feel so bad for being such a spectacle.I hope not, she's a great gal.

898880,A15MLF38WROSWU,B0008ENIWK,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[2, 3]","Kirstie Alley stars in a show that pokes fun at her being overweight, and I have to say there were times this show was hilarious.  I really found myself laughing, and laughing hard.  It was over the top at times, but it really made me admire her for taking this situation, and making it work for her.The show opens with Kirstie Alley getting on the scale and sobbing in hysterics when she sees the number on the scale.  She will not get work until she loses weight and all her agent has to offer her is a spokesperson for a weight loss product.  This simply sends her running for the nearest burger joint for a burger and fries.  She mentions all the overweight men in the industry who seem to have no problems finding work, and wants to know why she has to lose weight in order to get a new television show.  Her make up artist suggests she find a black man to date, that blackmen love ample figures, so off to the Soul Food place she goes.  She is being judged by the sisters sitting in the restaurant, but thinks she spots a guy who is interested in her.  The scene that had me laughing is why she is walking down the hall the looks of horror she is getting.  I mean okay she put on weight, but folks were looking at her like she weighed 400 pounds or something.  The music they used for that scene cracked me up.While talking about a potential deal she meets Max who is an executive at the company.  The scene where he keeps slapping her backside and she slaps his face is hilarious!!!  I had to watch that a few times because I was laughing so much.  There is another scene where she is trying to find pants that fit, and is upset that out of all the pants she has tried on, nothing seems to want to fit her.  She solicits the help of some diet guru who suggests she finds a creative way to throw up, or take laxatives, or other horrible bad stuff to be skinny.  Kirstie has a major crush on Kid Rock and dreams of doing him.  Kirstie takes the laxatives and coffee sets them off and she goes running to the bathroom, and ends up being confronted by a woman who thinks she is pregnant.  Then Kirstie finds out an ex lover of hers is gay, and she ends up thrown in jail for cruising with gay men.  She is needless to say puzzled by him being gay being they lived together for 2 years.  While in jail she convinces a female guard who keeps hitting on her to use her cell phone so she can get out of jail.A man falls in love with Kirstie and showers her with gifts but the man has issues of his own.  Can you say therapy?Seeing Mayim Bilik (Blossom) was amazing.  I don't think I've seen her on television well since her show went off the air, and her doing her intro from her show was too funny.There are times the endings of the show simply did not make sense, and the show did not always flow from episode to episode, but I was entertained, and there are times some images will pop in my head and I will find myself chuckling.  Hearing Kirstie cuss was a hoot.  I also enjoy watching her dance.  Kirstie has some moves on her.The show has a host of guest stars like Mark Curry (hanging with Mr. Cooper), Kelly Preston, Kid Rock, John Travolta, Leah Remini, and some other notable actors. Kirstie really had some support from her friends for this project.The most funniest part had to be the crack head brother coming to the house while she is waiting for Oprah to redo her kitchen.  Kirstie is hoping redoing her kitchen will help her get skinny.  Brother suggests she become a crack head because ""you don't see overweight crackheads.""  Instead of Kirstie smoking the crack her make up artist Kevyn  ends up smoking it and is a mess.  Then it turns out the whole family seems to have some kind of addiction.I seriously doubt there will be a season 2 being she has lost the weight and looking fabulous, unless they decide to name the show Formerly Fat Actress.  To truly enjoy this show you have to have an open mind, and a crazy sense of humor.  I don't plan to add this show to my DVD collection, but it's one I enjoyed renting.
