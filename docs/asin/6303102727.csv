""brnn64""","[4, 10]","This is an oddly assembled and poorly edited patchwork quilt of film clips of people and music representing the &quot;counterculture&quot; of the late 60s-early 70s era. Basically, the nude scenes, profanity, etc. seem to be more for shock value than for making any statement, and nothing seems to make any particular point. Not even good for historical purposes, it's unlikely that you would want to see this more than once, or even all the way through upon the first viewing. The Richard Pryor scenes are only mildly interesting. I recall in the reviews for Frankie Avalon's &quot;Back To The Beach,&quot; a reviewer said, &quot;It stinks.

356630,A27QKI9K6RKFIT,6303102727,"CARLOS ROMERO ""&#34;natural cinephile&#34;""","[0, 0]","I have to say, I found this film (which was a collage of 60's images and a series of bold skits and sketches) to be completely hilarious, uproariously funny and right on! ""Dynamite Chicken"" was directed by Ernest Pintoff and was released in 1971 or '72. Anyway, it is really an interesting and one-of-a-kind experience. This is a time-capsule and a look back at a volatile period (just like the one right-now!), in the history of this country, when things were really coming to a head. The 60's counter-culture generation never really made the lasting impact we read and talk so much about (the corporations won out in the end, no surprise there!). The powers-that-be made it their priority (via infiltration and dissension), in shutting them down fast and quick! From watching this film, we get a sense of the reason why that was. The honesty and genuine dedication a lot of the people of that generation had in making changes to the social-conditions of the world as they existed then and now were very real. Most of the opinions and ideas these people shared, were considered dangerous and a threat to the status-quo of the power-establishment. Their non-partisan and truly anti-establishment stance (they attacked both parties and their candidates), in how they mocked the system (the sham-democracy we have), is something that's completely lacking and missing in today's activists. Here we get a small glimpse of: the civil-rights movement, the women's-movement, the anti-war movement, etc., etc. Without any of the bias or prejudice of: for-or-against, all in less than 80 mins. How can you beat a history lesson like that! And even better, it has a young Richard Pryor (in some very candid moments), giving us his street-wise philosophy and humor. Fred Willard and the 'Ace Trucking Co.' in a series of some very funny skits (the scene of a parody of an 'Aqua Velva' commercial was especially memorable). There was plenty of beautiful and uninhibited 60's & 70's female nudity - serving as a contrast to the morally-uptight (and downright hypocritical), socio-political views of the older and compliant predecessor-generation (via man-on-the-street interviews). Of course even a lot of the young people had some outrageous views on the social-issues of the day. This film will bring back so many memories to those who were old enough to remember this era. The film never took itself seriously (it looks like it was shot on super-8 or 16mm), remaining true to its underground roots. This was a funny and creative send-up of the American cultural-landscape as it existed then! This really is a forgotten gem, I hope someone restores the entire film someday (there might even be more footage out there somewhere). The DVD picture and sound quality were actually very good. NTSC, English (no subtitles or extras), NR 76 mins.

It was good to see a young Richard Pryor again and if this was just a movie of him talking about anything it would be a hundred times better. It's just bits of Pryor hanging out on the outdoor basketball playground interspersed with some unfunny skits and comments from 60s pot head political whiners. They hate the U.S. flag and let you know that they consider it nothing. That kind of thing.It's possible that 60s and early 70s pot heads and acid droppers would really enjoy the entire movie in a room filled with black light posters and purple light blubs. They would love the attempts at President Nixon jokes. You know how those people laugh like an uncontrollable hyena. Unfortunately for those people, it's 2011 and they are all dead now.Dynamite Chicken is a great title for a comedy but there's nothing really that funny in this movie. A comedy is supposed to be funny. The movie is so dated that you have to be between 40 and 50 to even understand the political jokes and even then, the jokes aren't funny.",2,Dynamite Chicken is a dud but someone had to be lit when it was made!,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1082,"['only', 'reason', 'bought', ""'m"", 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'fan', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'young', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'again', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'talking', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'hundred', 'times', 'better', 'just', 'bits', 'Pryor', 'hanging', 'out', 'outdoor', 'basketball', 'playground', 'interspersed', 'unfunny', 'skits', 'comments', '60s', 'pot', 'head', 'political', 'whiners', 'hate', 'U.S.', 'flag', 'let', 'know', 'consider', 'nothing', 'kind', 'thing.It', 'possible', '60s', 'early', '70s', 'pot', 'heads', 'acid', 'droppers', 'would', 'really', 'enjoy', 'entire', 'movie', 'room', 'filled', 'black', 'light', 'posters', 'purple', 'light', 'blubs', 'would', 'love', 'attempts', 'President', 'Nixon', 'jokes', 'know', 'how', 'people', 'laugh', 'uncontrollable', 'hyena', 'Unfortunately', 'people', '2011', 'are', 'dead', 'now.Dynamite', 'Chicken', 'great', 'title', 'comedy', 'nothing', 'really', 'funny', 'movie', 'comedy', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'movie', 'so', 'dated', 'have', 'be', '40', '50', 'even', 'understand', 'political', 'jokes', 'even', 'then', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny']",N/A
