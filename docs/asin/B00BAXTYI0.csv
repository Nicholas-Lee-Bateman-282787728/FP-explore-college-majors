In watching it as an adult I am struck by how imaginative all the stories are. You will find none of the standard Western cliches here, not a one. Every story is fresh and new.As usual, the CBS vaults have yielded absolutely perfect quality episodes, just like they did for Perry Mason.This is a really great example of why Westerns were so popular back then. I highly recommend it to everyone.",5,Excellent old 60's show,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,515,"['was', 'wonderful', 'show', 'remembered', 'childhood', 'being', 'no-nonsense', 'Western', 'great', 'lead', 'character', 'watching', 'adult', 'am', 'struck', 'how', 'imaginative', 'stories', 'are', 'will', 'find', 'none', 'standard', 'Western', 'cliches', 'here', 'not', 'one', 'Every', 'story', 'fresh', 'new.As', 'usual', 'CBS', 'vaults', 'have', 'yielded', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'quality', 'episodes', 'just', 'did', 'Perry', 'Mason.This', 'really', 'great', 'example', 'why', 'Westerns', 'were', 'so', 'popular', 'back', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone']",Have Gun Will Travel: The Complete Series
