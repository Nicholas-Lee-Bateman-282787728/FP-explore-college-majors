Let's not even mention that most TV shows are about nothing and don't have the guts to admit it, but Seinfeld inevitably caught the mood of the times, containing the requisite amounts of jaded cynicism and irony that the 1990s embodied. Seinfeld was a show that probably wouldn't be made today, with networks looking more at bottom line than inspiration, but, in a rare instance of network foresight and courage, NBC stood by the show and watched it become the biggest show ever, surpassing even its ""older brother"", Cheers. It's too bad NBC didn't learn from their successes, to which their current fourth place status can attest.The third season was pivotal. Although the show's ratings weren't exactly smashing in the previous two seasons, NBC decided that the show needed more room to grow. This season produced some seminal episodes, like ""The Library Cop"", ""The Pen"" and especially ""The Parking Garage"", which laid down the show's look and feel. By ""The Keys"", the season's final episode, Seinfeld the show had evolved into what we all remember it as: clever, wacky, and oddly insightful into modern-day life.Sony really went to town with these DVD sets. Tons of deleted scenes, documentaries, commentaries (voice and text), etc. There's enough material here for even the biggest Seinfeld devotee to learn more.

Through the years, they're joined by loveable cast of characters that includes Newman, Uncle Leo, the Soup Nazi, Frank and Estelle Costanza, the Bubble Boy, and countless others.The third season DVD offers some of the best episodes yet, with classic lines such as ""I think it moved"" (episode 18) and ""These pretzels are making me thirsty"" (episode 28).

845307,A1VONCVB0ANIEH,B0002UE1WQ,B. Wolf,"[11, 19]","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times: Seinfeld difused all discontent.""Nothing Wrong With That,"" outakes are uproarious.  Although I've seen more of the show through reruns, a fuzzy memory was indeed revived by this smash-hit show, and now DVD, one of watching this classic sitcom on a warm, fresh spring day, just around dinner time way back in 95. (More idyllic times in general worldwide).  The true allure of the show, with all it's admirers and adherents countrywide (world over for that matter), in all liklihood can never be fully conceived by those of latter generations.  However, keeping the memory of the show alive will prove invaluable.  Seinfeld was not only full of wise-cracks, quick lines, and unique gesticulations, it also shared the common bond of character evolution w/ most other succesful network shows.  The prize awaiting fans in these first three seasons is a less refined ensemble, something that is interesting to view when one knows in the back of their mind how big the cast became over the course of the '90s.  If there were to be an aspect of the show that I enjoyed thoroughly, it would of course have to be their wonderful humor and, in retrospect, how well the whole crew depicts relationships.  Some may say the show got too big, and people became somewhat obsessed with its more surreal side (i.e. nutty premises and ""Kramers"" antics), but I have to disagree.  The show was great because it captured the best of fantasy and reality; something I notice also in a lot of British productions.  It has its manic moments, silly situations, and emotional realizations, all completing a compendium on every-day life.  To avoid further praise, the show is a classic because it shows how great life can be if it is lived with a little less gravity, a tad more enthusiastically, but always with the respect for genuine personality and freedom of expression.  A real delight and suprise was the ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" extra.  Michael Richards is so eloquent and insightful, drawing further recognition to his abilities.  In closing, thank you Sony and Seinfeld crew members for the DVD release.  Please throw in a ton of extras in future episode releases.",5,Funny is as Funny does...,1101600000,"11 28, 2004",2004,2193,"['was', 'best', 'times', 'was', 'worst', 'times', 'Seinfeld', 'difused', 'discontent', 'Nothing', 'Wrong', 'outakes', 'are', 'uproarious', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'show', 'reruns', 'fuzzy', 'memory', 'was', 'indeed', 'revived', 'smash-hit', 'show', 'now', 'DVD', 'one', 'watching', 'classic', 'sitcom', 'warm', 'fresh', 'spring', 'day', 'just', 'dinner', 'time', 'way', 'back', '95', 'More', 'idyllic', 'times', 'general', 'worldwide', 'true', 'allure', 'show', 'admirers', 'adherents', 'countrywide', 'world', 'matter', 'liklihood', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'fully', 'conceived', 'latter', 'generations', 'However', 'keeping', 'memory', 'show', 'alive', 'will', 'prove', 'invaluable', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'full', 'wise-cracks', 'quick', 'lines', 'unique', 'gesticulations', 'also', 'shared', 'common', 'bond', 'character', 'evolution', 'w/', 'most', 'other', 'succesful', 'network', 'shows', 'prize', 'awaiting', 'fans', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'less', 'refined', 'ensemble', 'something', 'interesting', 'view', 'when', 'one', 'back', 'mind', 'how', 'big', 'cast', 'became', 'course', ""'90s"", 'were', 'be', 'aspect', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'would', 'course', 'have', 'be', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'retrospect', 'how', 'well', 'whole', 'crew', 'relationships', 'may', 'say', 'show', 'got', 'too', 'big', 'people', 'became', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'more', 'surreal', 'side', 'i.e', 'nutty', 'premises', 'Kramers', 'antics', 'have', 'disagree', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'captured', 'best', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'something', 'notice', 'also', 'lot', 'British', 'productions', 'manic', 'moments', 'silly', 'situations', 'emotional', 'realizations', 'completing', 'compendium', 'every-day', 'life', 'avoid', 'further', 'praise', 'show', 'classic', 'how', 'great', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'lived', 'little', 'less', 'gravity', 'tad', 'more', 'enthusiastically', 'always', 'respect', 'genuine', 'personality', 'freedom', 'expression', 'real', 'delight', 'suprise', 'was', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'extra', 'Michael', 'Richards', 'so', 'eloquent', 'insightful', 'drawing', 'further', 'recognition', 'abilities', 'closing', 'thank', 'Sony', 'Seinfeld', 'crew', 'members', 'DVD', 'release', 'Please', 'throw', 'ton', 'extras', 'future', 'episode', 'releases']",Seinfeld: Season 3

845309,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B0002UE1WQ,calvinnme,"[3, 4]","After two somewhat experimental seasons, Seinfeld really began hitting its stride in this third season. It's really a tribute to the talent that was in front of and behind the cameras on this show that they tweaked the formula for two seasons until near perfect comedy and chemistry was achieved.In ""The Library"" we see how the writers make everything come full circle in this show. One of the best one-episode characters in Seinfeld's history, the Library Detective is an hilariously stubborn old fashioned man who confronts Jerry about a missing book from 1971 that was never returned. Jerry goes to see his girlfriend at the time to see if he returned the book, only to find that he had not. Meanwhile, Kramer meets a pretty librarian and George sees his brown toothed underwear pulling gym teacher, who now is a bum living under the steps of the NYC Public Library. The old man hasn't changed much, and he gives George yet another wedgie.  Also, the library book turned out not to be just a red herring, as it turns out the homeless gym teacher has hung onto it all these years.""The Red Dot"" is a hilarious example of how George cannot just leave well enough alone - he always has to push everything to its limits. Elaine gets the long out-of-work George a job at the publishing company for which she works. Everything would be back on track for George, but he just can't resist having sex in the office with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady takes the encounter more seriously than George does, and George is afraid she'll tell his boss of the encounter and get him fired. He decides to give her a gift, a cashmere sweater that has been deeply discounted because of a tiny red dot on it that is supposedly too small to see yet each of its recipients spot it almost immediately, including the cleaning lady. She informs on George, and he is out of work once again.The season finale, ""The Keys"", sets up the Emmy winning fourth season. Kramer has been abusing his house priveleges in Jerry's apartment too much, so Jerry revokes his spare key privileges. Realizing that he has broken the ""covenant of the keys"" gives Kramer the realization he is now free to break out of his routine. Kramer takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor. Jerry gave his spare keys to Elaine, then when he needs them, he goes with George to Elaine's to search for his spare set, since George has Elaine's spare keys. What they find is Elaine's show-biz project, an episode of Murphy Brown that she has written. Elaine finds the two going through her stuff and in turn revokes George's spare key priveleges. Kramer finds adventure as he journeys across the country to LA where he gets a bit part on Murphy Brown playing her secretary. The next season picks up on the gang trying to locate Kramer in California.I highly recommend this season as the first season of Seinfeld where everything seems to be clicking both storywise and character-wise. It's not a show where you need any background from previous seasons, since, after all, it is ""a show about nothing"". However, I found it helpful to view the first two seasons first to see how everything came together.",5,The first of the truly great seasons of Seinfeld,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",2006,3170,"['two', 'somewhat', 'experimental', 'seasons', 'Seinfeld', 'really', 'began', 'hitting', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'really', 'tribute', 'talent', 'was', 'front', 'cameras', 'show', 'tweaked', 'formula', 'two', 'seasons', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'chemistry', 'was', 'achieved.In', 'Library', 'see', 'how', 'writers', 'make', 'everything', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'show', 'One', 'best', 'one-episode', 'characters', 'Seinfeld', 'history', 'Library', 'Detective', 'hilariously', 'stubborn', 'old', 'fashioned', 'man', 'who', 'Jerry', 'missing', 'book', '1971', 'was', 'never', 'returned', 'Jerry', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'see', 'returned', 'book', 'only', 'find', 'had', 'not', 'Meanwhile', 'Kramer', 'pretty', 'librarian', 'George', 'brown', 'toothed', 'underwear', 'pulling', 'gym', 'teacher', 'who', 'now', 'bum', 'living', 'steps', 'NYC', 'Public', 'Library', 'old', 'man', ""n't"", 'changed', 'much', 'George', 'yet', 'wedgie', 'Also', 'library', 'book', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'red', 'herring', 'out', 'homeless', 'gym', 'teacher', 'hung', 'years', 'Red', 'Dot', 'hilarious', 'example', 'how', 'George', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'leave', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'always', 'push', 'everything', 'limits', 'Elaine', 'long', 'out-of-work', 'George', 'job', 'publishing', 'company', 'Everything', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'track', 'George', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'having', 'sex', 'office', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'encounter', 'more', 'seriously', 'George', 'George', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'boss', 'encounter', 'get', 'fired', 'give', 'gift', 'cashmere', 'sweater', 'been', 'deeply', 'discounted', 'tiny', 'red', 'dot', 'supposedly', 'too', 'small', 'see', 'yet', 'recipients', 'spot', 'almost', 'immediately', 'including', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'George', 'work', 'once', 'again.The', 'season', 'finale', 'Keys', 'up', 'Emmy', 'winning', 'fourth', 'season', 'Kramer', 'been', 'abusing', 'house', 'priveleges', 'Jerry', 'apartment', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'Jerry', 'spare', 'key', 'privileges', 'Realizing', 'broken', 'covenant', 'keys', 'Kramer', 'realization', 'now', 'free', 'break', 'routine', 'Kramer', 'California', 'follow', 'dream', 'becoming', 'actor', 'Jerry', 'gave', 'spare', 'keys', 'Elaine', 'then', 'when', 'George', 'Elaine', 'search', 'spare', 'set', 'George', 'Elaine', 'spare', 'keys', 'What', 'find', 'Elaine', 'show-biz', 'project', 'episode', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'written', 'Elaine', 'two', 'going', 'stuff', 'turn', 'revokes', 'George', 'spare', 'key', 'priveleges', 'Kramer', 'adventure', 'country', 'LA', 'where', 'bit', 'part', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'playing', 'secretary', 'next', 'season', 'up', 'gang', 'trying', 'locate', 'Kramer', 'California.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'Seinfeld', 'where', 'everything', 'be', 'clicking', 'storywise', 'character-wise', 'not', 'show', 'where', 'need', 'background', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'nothing', 'However', 'found', 'helpful', 'view', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'everything', 'came', 'together']",Seinfeld: Season 3

845322,A1MAG8BDOVJHTT,B0002UE1WQ,"G. Swift ""97jedi""","[20, 23]","The third season of Seinfeld is when some of the really great stories came out, making this set a must have for fans of the show.  Of course, I loved Seinfeld over its entire run, watching the premiere when it first aired and then watching the series till it ended, so I may be a bit biased in favor of it.  The episodes are presented in the order they were filmed rather than the order they aired, which actually makes the continuity better for this set.  The special features are only so-so, and I did not bother to look for hidden bits like the first set had, so there might be more to see.As with the first set, there is for each episode a brief making-of retrospective with various cast and crew sharing their recollections.  It is interesting to watch, and the different people giving commentary keeps it from seeming too repetitive.  I like the Notes About Nothing, which gives subtitles of minutiae, like Girlfriend and Boyfriend Counters for the cast, Kramer Entrance Counter, things like that.The best part of this set, like the first set, is the outtakes.  While I did not actually time it, I believe that there are more outtakes in this set than in the first set.  I watched it three times before moving on, as I laughed so hard at them.  Some were already shown on other discs with the pertinent episode's short documentary, but they are still hilarious.The behind-the-scenes stuff is OK, if a bit dry and somewhat padded in length by clips from the shows themselves.  The audio commentaries that can be run are pretty disappointing.  There are none with all four cast members, which would have rocked, but some have three (all but Seinfeld), likely due to the money issues that delayed this set so long in the first place.  I only listened to a couple, with Kramer, George, and Elaine speaking, as that was the closest to the cast as was available.  Not bad, but for 22 minute shows it seems clear to me that they did not put that much time and effort into it.  I also would have loved all four cast members together for one of the interviews, but maybe that can happen on a later set.All in all, I am happy with the purchase, even if the features are not so great, mainly because I love the show and can now watch whichever episodes I like whenever I want.

Again we the viewers learn interesting stuff from these features such as Jason Alexander explaining during Inside Look of The Pen how he threatened to quit after George being left out of the episode. Whilst there was a lot of great information I was a bit disappointed with the commentary on The Parking Garage as it was just a couple of directors on an ego trip telling us what a great job they did, how the garage looks real and stuff like this.

845330,A3T9IX8EDFDX4G,B0002UE1WQ,John Alapick,"[4, 5]","Riding on the momentum of the last few episodes of the previous season, Seinfeld - Season 3 would be the first of several seasons where nearly every episode was top notch, many of which would become classics. The writing, much of which was based on things that really happened to the writers, improved tremendously as did the rapport among the cast. This led to a small but dedicated cult following which would increase during the season. Momentum had built as such that two of Season 4's episodes would debut the following summer rather than in the traditional fall season.Disc 1 is very strong as both ""The Library"" and ""The Pen"" would become early classics while ""The Note"" and ""The Truth"" were also very good. Every episode of Disc 2 is top notch with the episodes ""The Parking Garage"", ""The Caf&eacute;"", ""The Tape"", and ""The Alternate Side"" reaching classic status with the last debuting one of the show's many catchphrases, in this case ""These pretzels are making me thirsty!"" Disc 3 is just as great with the best episodes being ""The Red Dot"", ""The Pez Dispenser"", and ""The Boyfriend"", the series' first two-part episode, which features former baseball great Keith Hernandez as well as a hilarious segment involving a spitting incident between Hernandez, Kramer, and Newman in the guise of the movie, JFK. Disc 4 is awesome as well with the best episodes being ""The Fix Up"", ""The Limo"", and ""The Parking Space."" Even lesser known episodes during the season such as ""The Dog"", ""The Nose Job"", and ""The Subway"" are very funny. As with all of the DVD's released in the Seinfeld series, the coup de grace are the special features which feature bloopers, deleted scenes, inside looks, and exclusive stand-up material. Also included is a must see 22-minute documentary on the Kramer character and the highly recommended Notes About Nothing which are chock full of information.  Also worth noting is there's less emphasis on Jerry's stand-up routine as the writing team was running on all cylinders. Despite the struggling ratings when these shows originally aired, Season 3 would be the season where Seinfeld came of age and would lead to its phenomenon status.

""The Seinfeld gang"" is, to me, one of the quirkiest phrases imaginable. Is the Seinfeld gang like the crips or the bloods? Well, no. In fact, the most enduring trait and root of great comedy comes from their relentless self-absorption and lack of empathy.Larry David lends himself to the show in incredible ways.Oddly enough, I stopped watching Seinfeld after the original ""chronicles"" morphed into the much more familiar sitcom rhythm. I felt cheated. It was almost as though the integrity of the first creative concept had been sacrificed to commercialism.Five years later, when the only thing people around the water cooler could talk about was last night's Seinfeld, I realized that I was right: it had ""gone commercial"" but, in the process, become a part of our culture and had brought pleasure to many, many people.

The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.

It's really fun getting a little dose of that sort of thing while the episode is still fresh in your mind.  And, of course, there are lots of other extras on the final disc.  A particular favorite was a nice sampling of extended Seinfeld stand-up routines, using lots of material that didn't make it into the stand-up segments used in the episodes.

845346,A1HGQBE8ZSI58,B0002UE1WQ,Nick Mackler,"[5, 7]","The Third Season of Seinfeld is superb. It was the season that led to the show being a huge success and eventually deemed the greatest sitcom of all time.The success of the season is built upon the outstanding story lines as the season immediately leaps into a highly comical story of George being massaged by a man.Another strong point of the season is the fact that actor Michael Richards finally unleashed into a new phase of the character of Kramer, playing the role more intelligently and incorporating many outrageous sequences of body movements for effect. In fact, each actor branches out even more in this season, especially Jerry Seinfeld who begins to learn more about acting and expresses more emotions in each episode. Each character can be found in the whackiest of situations and the hilarity of them will have you laughing non-stop.The special features also have a large role in this DVD, taking up the majority of it. They are all fabulous as we often get an ""Inside Look"" at the episode with brilliant commentary from Larry David, Larry Charles, and other writers. And of course we also hear from Michael Richards, Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis Dreyfus. One of the features is a look at Kramer's character which is a thrill to watch. Another highlight to the extras is the unseen stand up footage from Jerry Seinfeld.The quality of the episodes is nothing short of spectacular as well. There lies not one weak show in the collection of 22, with the highlights coming from episodes like:The Pen: The only episode in which Jason Alexander sits out in,  it features Jerry and Elaine visiting Jerry's parents at a Resort  for the elderly.The Tape: Jerry discovers a sexy message left on his tape recorder by none other than Elaine and George becomes attracted to her because of it.The Boyfriend: One of the most famous in the Seinfeld episodes featuring baseball star Keith Hernandez. It relates to the delicate issue of the Kennedy Assassination.The Cafe: Jerry feels obliged to enter a restaurant in fear of the man working there losing his business. This episode introduces us to the beloved character, Babu.Overall, there are no weak episodes and you'll watch them over and over again.

Among the great episodes of season three:""The pen""  Jerry visits his parents in florida and Jack Klompus gives Jerry the famous Astronaut pen that writes upside down.""The Library"" The library asks Jerry about a book he checked out in 1971 and never returned, so Jerry looks up an old girlfriend for his defense against a library cop.  Phillip Baker Hall is priceless as the Libray Cop Bookman.""The Subway""  Everyone has an uncommon experience while going their separate ways on the subway. George meets a beautiful woman who distracts him from his intended destination, a job interview. Jerry falls asleep and then wakes up across from a fat naked man and winds up discussing with him, the New York Mets & Coney Island.""The Pez Dispenser"" Kramer joins the ""Polar Bear Club."" Jerry gets one of Kramer's Pez dispensers which makes Elaine laugh during a piano recital of George's girlfriend, and that puts their relationship in jeopardy.""The Boyfriend Parts 1 & 2""  Jerry meets Keith Hernandez and wants to make a good impression. Meanwhile, George is out of time on his unemployment and he works harder than ever on his scheme to get a 13 week extension. He tells the unemployment office he was really close on Vandelay Industries, a company that makes latex products and whose main office is Jerry's apartment.

845355,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002UE1WQ,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[13, 16]","""Seinfeld"" continues to be sponge worthy in this great DVD boxed set of the third season.  The third season consists of 22 episodes. All the episodes are the uncut original episodes that aired on NBC (most of the episodes in syndication are usually trimmed by a minute or two). The boxed set has a slipover case. Inside the inside slipcase each disc is nicely housed in individual slim DVD holders. Season Three has 9 commentary tracks (if I'm counting correctly)featuring Jerry and Larry David, Michael Richards, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander on a trio of episodes and writer Larry Charles & Director/Producer Tom Cherone on the remainder. Deleted scenes, unused stand up bits, promos and a sly featurette on the real Karmer make this a generous set particulary when compared to the bare bones releases for other similar (although not as funny) series.Overall, the high definition transfer look very sharp.  The good news is that even though the show was videotaped, the quality of the picture and sound for most of those analog episodes continues to look great. The blacks are solid for a videotaped program and the colors are as real and true as they appeared over a decade ago. Sound is also quite good on this set. Clearly, Columbia took a lot of care in transferring the show. Considering they could have just dumped it on the market with only the episodes and no extras and commentaries, I'm a happy camper.For a show about nothing this boxed set spends plenty of time and space talking about the something special that made this an outstanding show. We get 9 commentary tracks from Jerry, Larry David, writer Larry Charles and Jason, Julia and Michael the other part of the fab four. All in all, it's a generous boxed set filled to the brim with extras.""Kramer vs. Kramer"" allows the real life inspiration for Cosmo Kramer to comment on his fictional counterpart. Kenny Kramer comes across as wacky and weird as Cosmo but a little scarier in that he occupies real space. We also get outtakes, bloopers (watch Jerry and the cast screw everything up and make the screw ups almost as funny as the scripts) and deleted scenes from episodes that ran a little but too long. ""Master of His Domain"" features the stand up material that introduced much of the third season that was shot but never featured in the show. You can well imagine which episodes they were intended for and guess pretty accurately without seeing any info on the subject. ""Sponsored by Vandelay Industries"" features the funny promo ads and trailers that NBC ran to promote the show. ""Inside Looks"" provides a glimpse behind-the-scenes as to what was really happening when various episodes were shot. There's also some discussion about improve on the set, what inspired the various episodes and the chemistry that the ensemble cast had together. We also have the chance to see trivia about the various episodes but, more importantly, two slightly different versions of the pilot episode that play a bit different as well. It's like entering the Bizarro Universe from Superman at times.There's also cool production notes about the making of each episode that appear at the bottom of the screen.

845356,A34HYQ9BQZPE78,B0002UE1WQ,William Dorfer,"[2, 2]","Like many other reviewers/fans, I believe that the third season of Seinfeld was definitely a head above the first and second seasons. Of course, there some great shows in those two seasons, but Season 3 is really the time when the show defined itself and started to perfect its elements. They found their comfort zone for plots, jokes and even some experimentation, such as an episode taking place outside the usual realm of location (""The Parking Garage"", ""The Subway"" and ""The Limo"" all come to mind).Some of my all-time favorite Seinfeld episode are from this season. I loved ""The Parking Garage"" because it was able to take such a minimalistic idea and make an entire episode out of it. ""The Pen"" builds up to a hilarious climax where Elaine gets high off painkillers and Jerry's eyes get discolored from diving, forcing him to awkwardly wear sunglasses to a party. Then of course, the first time I saw ""The Limo"", I was truly taken by surprise and absolutely had to know how it ended, and what an ending!There were also some episodes that took unusual elements and made them strangely charming. One example is in ""The Dog"" where Jerry has to watch a dog while his braindead drunkard owner (who's very funny during his onscreen time!), is at a hospital halfway across the country. ""The Subway"" is able to construct and execute four totally different plots, one for each of the characters, until all is brought to a head in the Restaurant at the end.Overall, this collection brings together some of the greatest and most interesting Seinfeld episodes in the show's run. Add to the four discs all the extra features, and this is a purchase worth every last cent. Buy it and spend countless hours enjoying it! Thanks for the time, and peace.",5,These pretzels are makin' me thirsty!,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,1742,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers/fans', 'believe', 'third', 'season', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'definitely', 'head', 'first', 'second', 'seasons', 'course', 'great', 'shows', 'two', 'seasons', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'time', 'when', 'show', 'defined', 'started', 'perfect', 'elements', 'found', 'comfort', 'zone', 'plots', 'jokes', 'even', 'experimentation', 'such', 'episode', 'taking', 'place', 'usual', 'realm', 'location', 'Parking', 'Garage', 'Subway', 'Limo', 'come', 'mind', '.Some', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'are', 'season', 'loved', 'Parking', 'Garage', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'minimalistic', 'idea', 'make', 'entire', 'episode', 'Pen', 'up', 'hilarious', 'climax', 'where', 'Elaine', 'high', 'painkillers', 'Jerry', 'eyes', 'get', 'discolored', 'diving', 'forcing', 'awkwardly', 'wear', 'sunglasses', 'party', 'Then', 'course', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Limo', 'was', 'truly', 'taken', 'surprise', 'absolutely', 'had', 'know', 'how', 'ended', 'what', 'ending', 'were', 'also', 'episodes', 'took', 'unusual', 'elements', 'made', 'strangely', 'charming', 'One', 'example', 'Dog', 'where', 'Jerry', 'watch', 'dog', 'braindead', 'drunkard', 'owner', 'who', 'very', 'funny', 'onscreen', 'time', 'hospital', 'halfway', 'country', 'Subway', 'able', 'construct', 'execute', 'four', 'totally', 'different', 'plots', 'one', 'characters', 'brought', 'head', 'Restaurant', 'end.Overall', 'collection', 'together', 'greatest', 'most', 'interesting', 'Seinfeld', 'episodes', 'show', 'run', 'Add', 'four', 'discs', 'extra', 'features', 'purchase', 'worth', 'last', 'cent', 'Buy', 'spend', 'countless', 'hours', 'enjoying', 'Thanks', 'time', 'peace']",Seinfeld: Season 3
