I particularly love the psychics, mediums, demonologists and gifted guests called in to assist - I'm amazed at the accuracy of their readings and insight.  I'm a fan of this type of show and have and continue to watch many of the older established (Paranormal Witness, My Ghost Story) but I have to say that Paranormal State is my favorite.  Great job Ryan & crew - you all are so brave and fearless although I know sometimes you're frightened, I think we know you guys are the real deal because you DO get scared.  I love it when I get the ""What the ****(beep) was that?""  That's what each and every one of us would say if we were in your shoes. Thanks for the education, I consider myself well versed and know that the paranormal is nothing to experiment with or ""try out""...too many inexperienced people don't realize  who or what they could attract and when or where they could mistakenly open a door for a demon to move in.  Keep up the great work.  One area that has always intrigued me is Ryan's childhood experience being tormented or threatened by spirits - if you could, perhaps now is the time to give us more insight into what has brought you to this place in your life.

1428109,A3R4XIOYH1OOPV,B004UIFZQC,"Stephanie C ""Stephanie""","[34, 40]","First to the technical issues. With all the tech ppl and all the cameras on a computer screen showing multiple rooms, and all the equipment; they never show us one thing beyond the faces of the ppl reacting. They saw something move, saw a shadow, saw a figure. GREAT! Yet there's never any video to show us what they saw. ""Did you hear that?"" ""What was that sound?"" Well gee, who knows since all we as the viewer get to hear is the scary background music they throw in.I have no doubt the crew is telling the truth as to what they see and hear, but you'd think for a show trying to capture it would actually show us things. We see nothing. This big camera crew and all they focus on is Ryan's face, Katrina's face, Michelle's face, their personal reactions etc..I'm intrigued by the topic of anything paranormal and this has become such a complete disappointment. There's snipets here and there where you get a moment of excitement because they actually show something for half a second. It's a fleeting moment that passes quickly.The biggest let down is Ryan himself. His whole reason for starting this quest and all his emotional moments of talking about his experiences as a child and how hard it was for nobody to believe him. He seems to have become very numb to this and now does the same thing to other ppl. In just about every episode, he is so eager to dismiss what the ppl pleading for help are telling him that is going on, what they've seen, what they've heard, and how they've felt.In his talks with the crew, before he's even met the clients, he makes comments that things are probably hallucinations, bad dreams they probably had, mental issues, and even lying.. the one thing he himself still talks about in an emotional way about being so difficult for him. He seems to have become very numb to the people and more interested in debunking or capturing paranormal activity as his sole purpose of being there in these ppl's homes.He's lost that compassion he once had in wanting to help ppl and not wanting to make others feel the way he once did in being told he didn't see what he knows he saw. That's what made this show different and made it stand apart from others. He truly cared and wanted to make sure others knew they would finally be believed and someone would understand.This whole season 5 on every single disc, he does this to every single client by finding a multitude of reasons and excuses for why these ppl say they've seen things instead of just believing and listening as he once did. The only time this changes is if there's things that Ryan himself or someone on the team experiences first hand that can't be explained. Other than that, it's all in their head, there's more to the story, they're hallucinating, having nightmares, and the list goes on. He always tells them he believes they believe what they saw, BUT it's actually probably this this and this. How insulting.He does this at times before even speaking to the ppl he's supposed to go help. He's completely lost his passion and compassion to help ppl. Even when he appears to help at the end, it's more of going through the motions of having someone come in to bless the house, bringing in a counselor, and the usual things just to make the ppl feel better.But the actual help isn't there anymore; he's completely lost all the reasons why he started doing this in the 1st place. Oh and if you're a Chip Coffey fan.. Chip only makes one appearance on one short episode throughout the whole 3 disc set.I'd recommend this for entertainment purposes only for those moments when there's nothing on tv. But overall, it's a huge disappointment. If you want to be scared, order 'A haunting.' If you want real evidence of paranormal activity from ppl who truly want to show the world it exists, order 'Ghost Adventures'. If you want to watch ppl react to things we never see, enjoy.

It may also be my feeling of disappointment but in this last series there are more and more mirrors, more and more shots of Ryan looking at himself in them, surely he has earnt enough money by now to buy his own mirror or is he just vain ????? Maybe the director is possessed by mirror's or his mother was attacked by one but something is strange here and it's not the filmed vision presented which is after all, why one would buy this !
