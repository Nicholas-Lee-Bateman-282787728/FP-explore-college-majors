There's the required reference to Tom Berringer's character in this one, just to have the tie-in. There's the family connection (this keeps up, I'm going to believe that every merc is related somehow to a high-school teacher). It's really a very sequel-sih sequel. Sort of a crayoly copy of the original. It's like, you know how you have those old music files called midis, where the notes to the song are on key but played in that awful synthysized tone? Well, that. The original Substitute was the song; this is the midi.I should have rented it, not bought it.

I did like that they made at least some tenuous reference to the first film at the beginning of this one -- we are told that Berenger's Shale character is teaching in S. America with his Peace Corps girlfriend. Nice touch, that. Glad to know that they're doing OK. (Yeesh! I care about the welfare of fictional characters!)I like Treat Williams (great hair) and BD Wong, and I thought they did fine in their roles. One other highlight was the guy who played the janitor. He was probably my favorite character in this film -- very fiesty and amusing. But even the presence of all these great actors could not redeem this dismal film. The plot holes are gaping wide; there are plausability problems all over the place, and then there's the story. What story?

He plays a guy who's worked with Tom Berenger's character before(or at least has mutual friends).  I've always liked Treat Williams.  He's one of those actors that's actually very good, yet seems to get thrown into these movies all the time.  You'll catch him once in awhile in major motion pictures as a supporting character, but in B flicks he's the star!  He seems a little too nice to play the cold hearted mercenary type, but does it well.  The plot's similar to the first film in the sense that he goes undercover at a New York high school to find out who killed his brother, get revenge, and take care of his niece.  Along the way he brings a fellow merc, teams up with the half crazed Vietnam vet janitor and discovers a  chop shop operation going on in the school.

All three are worthwhile entertainment, much better than most of the &quot;B&quot; movies out there (I rent so many B movies that turn out to be unwatchable). However, this first sequel is the best. Treat Williams is a good replacement for Tom Berenger. He has that almost-too-old-but-still-can-kick-butt feel like Berenger. The reason this movie works better than the other two sequels is that it actually takes place in a high school and kind of mimics the first movie with the gangs, etc.. I love these movies because in every one the Substitute beats up some kid in the classroom to prove a point. There's good action like the first movie, I love it when the Substitute is going to get shot in a drive-by and actually runs to the car, does a flip, and breaks the guy's arm which is sticking out of the window!

76067,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,0784011664,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 2]","The murky conclusion of ""Untraceable"" director Steven Pearl's straight-to-video sequel ""The Substitute 2: School's Out"" undercuts an otherwise okay sequel that goes to enormous ends to establish itself as the follow-up to the Tom Berenger original. Treat Williams plays an entirely different character who knew Shale, and ""School's Out"" concerns his search for the person who gunned down his brother in cold blood in broad daylight. Williams is suave but decisive as Karl Thomasson who masquerades as the new substitute teacher. B.D. Wong is superb as the slimy villain. The Miami high school in the first film, the school here is a zoo with abrasive students who play their boom boxes in class and tote around deadly weapons like ice picks. Unlike the villains in the predecessor who were trafficking in illegal drugs, the bad guys here are operating a chop shop for stolen cars that nets them a $100-thousand-a-month. Like the original, the most considerate character turns out to be the source of the trouble. During the first three-fourths of ""The Substitute 2: School's Out,"" the scenarists of the first movie--Roy Frumkes, Rocco Simonelli, and Alan Ormsby--establish the reason for the sequel, neatly place the characters in the context of the original, and do a good job of integrating Karl into the action. The action scenes themselves, when Karl has to practice his expertise on the disruptive students as well as the adult villains, are fine, but everything collapses in the last quarter hour when the fatherless daughter discovers who killed her father. The filmmakers never have a confrontation scene between the hero and this villain. Moreover, the disruptive students in the classroom who should go down as hard as their counterparts did in the first movie are never shown receiving their just comeuppance for their crimes. The yo-yo scene where Karl explains the use of a yo-yo as a weapon is well-done as is the 'compromise' scene when he toss Mace's purloined boom box out the second story class room. Presumably, Mace is supposed to be the Jerome character here. The single character who doesn't have a counterpart from the first movie is Michael Michele; she plays a sympathetic school employee, Kara Lavelle, who is attracted to Karl. Initially, she met him at his brother's funeral. Not surprisingly, Karl's niece (Susan May Pratt of ""Drive Me Crazy"")doesn't trust Karl at first, but she breaks down and gets to like him. The only character here that is truly exceptional is the high school custodian, Johnny Bartee (Daryl Edwards of ""Arthur 2: On the Rocks""), who has an unique way of entering and exiting through the tunnels in the walls. He is a former Vietnam soldier who specialized in going into tunnels to flush out the Viet Cong. One of the things that the filmmakers do that looks cool is that the car-jacking gang wears their cotton windbreakers backwards so the hood covers them faces and they have slit eye-holes to see. One of the survivors from the first movie, Joey 6, reappears here but he is played by a different actor.",2,"""The Substitute 2"" is Substandard!",1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,3058,"['murky', 'conclusion', 'Untraceable', 'director', 'Steven', 'Pearl', 'straight-to-video', 'sequel', 'Substitute', '2', 'School', 'Out', 'otherwise', 'okay', 'sequel', 'enormous', 'ends', 'establish', 'follow-up', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'original', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'entirely', 'different', 'character', 'who', 'knew', 'Shale', 'School', 'Out', 'search', 'person', 'who', 'gunned', 'down', 'brother', 'cold', 'blood', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Williams', 'suave', 'decisive', 'Karl', 'Thomasson', 'who', 'new', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'B.D', 'Wong', 'superb', 'slimy', 'villain', 'Miami', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'film', 'school', 'here', 'zoo', 'abrasive', 'students', 'who', 'play', 'boom', 'boxes', 'class', 'tote', 'deadly', 'weapons', 'ice', 'picks', 'villains', 'predecessor', 'who', 'were', 'trafficking', 'illegal', 'drugs', 'bad', 'guys', 'here', 'are', 'operating', 'chop', 'shop', 'stolen', 'cars', '100-thousand-a-month', 'original', 'most', 'considerate', 'character', 'out', 'be', 'source', 'trouble', 'first', 'three-fourths', 'Substitute', '2', 'School', 'Out', 'scenarists', 'first', 'movie', 'Roy', 'Frumkes', 'Rocco', 'Simonelli', 'Alan', 'Ormsby', 'establish', 'reason', 'sequel', 'neatly', 'place', 'characters', 'context', 'original', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'integrating', 'Karl', 'action', 'action', 'when', 'Karl', 'practice', 'expertise', 'disruptive', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'adult', 'villains', 'are', 'fine', 'everything', 'collapses', 'last', 'quarter', 'hour', 'when', 'fatherless', 'daughter', 'discovers', 'who', 'killed', 'father', 'filmmakers', 'never', 'have', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'hero', 'villain', 'Moreover', 'disruptive', 'students', 'classroom', 'who', 'should', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'hard', 'counterparts', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'receiving', 'just', 'comeuppance', 'crimes', 'yo-yo', 'scene', 'where', 'Karl', 'use', 'yo-yo', 'weapon', 'well-done', ""'compromise"", 'scene', 'when', 'toss', 'Mace', 'purloined', 'boom', 'box', 'second', 'story', 'class', 'room', 'Presumably', 'Mace', 'supposed', 'be', 'Jerome', 'character', 'here', 'single', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'counterpart', 'first', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Michele', 'sympathetic', 'school', 'employee', 'Kara', 'Lavelle', 'who', 'attracted', 'Karl', 'Initially', 'met', 'brother', 'funeral', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Karl', 'niece', 'Susan', 'May', 'Pratt', 'Drive', 'Me', 'Crazy', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Karl', 'first', 'down', 'like', 'only', 'character', 'here', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'high', 'school', 'custodian', 'Johnny', 'Bartee', 'Daryl', 'Edwards', 'Arthur', '2', 'Rocks', 'who', 'unique', 'way', 'entering', 'exiting', 'tunnels', 'walls', 'former', 'Vietnam', 'soldier', 'who', 'specialized', 'going', 'tunnels', 'flush', 'out', 'Viet', 'Cong', 'One', 'things', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'cool', 'car-jacking', 'gang', 'cotton', 'windbreakers', 'backwards', 'hood', 'have', 'slit', 'eye-holes', 'see', 'One', 'survivors', 'first', 'movie', 'Joey', '6', 'reappears', 'here', 'played', 'different', 'actor']",N/A
