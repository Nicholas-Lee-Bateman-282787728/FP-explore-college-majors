1281208,A1WCQ282UKVWJ9,B002OMIKHW,Fidget's Momma,"[27, 30]","I'm honestly not sure why all these other reviews (up to this point) have been stating that the movies follow the books so closely. Hallmark is running a marathon of the LCS movies today, so I'm watching them as I type this. Let's be honest here - they don't follow the books, at least, not after the first one. That doesn't mean the video series doesn't have merit (see my more positive comments, below), it just means that a LOT of stuff is different. When I say a LOT, I mean stuff like this (watch out for spoilers, here):- Missy is 9 when the video series starts off, while in Love Comes Softly, she is much younger. I think they had to do this in order to keep from having to age Katherine Heigl in the next movie.- Though they at least attempted to stay true to Love Comes Softly (the first book), the movie ending is completely wrong, and is an obvious attempt to add excitement to what was originally a peaceful (love coming SOFTLY) resolution to the book.- The second book is still largely about the lives of Clark & Marty and their children. However, the MOVIE focuses entirely on the relationship of Missy and Willie (Willie had left town at a young age due to a tragedy in his family, and came back claiming to be a guy named ""Nate"" - again, NOT true to the book at all).- In total, FIVE LCS movies (that's right, FIVE) are entirely about Missy and her ""family"". Her family being made up of mostly randomly adopted children. After Willie is killed in the line of duty (because he was the sheriff of their town...what???), Missy moves back (with her only child- a son???) to live near Clark and Marty. There, she falls in love with Zach Taylor, who, I'm sorry, ISN'T ANYWHERE IN THE BOOKS, let alone as Missy's love interest.- Belinda, who was originally Clark and Marty's surprise youngest child, is - in this series - an orphan who arrived on an orphan train with her brother, and is promptly adopted by Missy, thus becoming Missy's daughter. Belinda's story from then on seems to be a mish-mash of her's and the younger Melissa's storylines. However, here I sit watching Belinda and Drew get married at the end of Love's Unfolding Dream.- Names and story lines are turned upside-down all over the place. Clark and Marty's other children are barely given a thought, though the books are peppered with events of their lives. (For instance, so far there is no Luke - Belind'a older brother doctor, part of her inspiration - anywhere in the films.)Ok, now Love Takes Wing is starting...and did Belinda just say she ""couldn't save Drew""??? We now find Belinda sharing the spotlight with her friend Annie and opening a clinic in a frontier town. Skipped Boston completely. From what I understand, ""Annie"", played by Haylie Duff, will be the main character in the final film. And here is a depressed Belinda completely rejecting her faith (in anger - I'm sure this will be resolved by the end of the series) and claiming that God doesn't exist.Now for the positive comments...So far (I am now well into the seventh movie) conservative values are upheld fairly well. It is mostly family-friendly, though I wouldn't let my own preschoolers watch it, due to some of the themes of death (we see this come up at least once in each film) and occasional mild, very brief violence. I do cringe a little at lines like ""if you're doing the right thing, everything will work out"", but over all, the themes of love, faith, and compassion come through in at least the first six films. No harsh language, sexual situations, or overtly graphic scenes. Though I have only noticed scenes directly involving prayer or scripture in the first two or three films, it does seem as though there is an attempt being made to at least keep some of the focus on Christian values. Hence, the two stars.As my kids get older, I will definitely consider adding this to our video collection as a good option that will appeal to us as well as our kids, but again, not sure how ANYBODY could think these films follow the books. A lovely little series, but if you're really interested in Janette Oke's works, read them before watching.",2,Nice - but NOT true to the books (some spoilers),1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,4108,"[""'m"", 'honestly', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'other', 'reviews', 'up', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'stating', 'movies', 'follow', 'books', 'so', 'closely', 'Hallmark', 'running', 'marathon', 'LCS', 'movies', 'today', ""'m"", 'watching', 'type', 'Let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'books', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'one', ""n't"", 'mean', 'video', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'merit', 'see', 'more', 'positive', 'comments', 'just', 'LOT', 'stuff', 'different', 'When', 'say', 'LOT', 'mean', 'stuff', 'watch', 'out', 'spoilers', 'here', 'Missy', '9', 'when', 'video', 'series', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'much', 'younger', 'think', 'had', 'do', 'order', 'keep', 'having', 'age', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'next', 'movie.-', 'least', 'attempted', 'stay', 'true', 'Love', 'Comes', 'Softly', 'first', 'book', 'movie', 'ending', 'completely', 'wrong', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'add', 'excitement', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'peaceful', 'coming', 'SOFTLY', 'resolution', 'book.-', 'second', 'book', 'still', 'largely', 'lives', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'children', 'However', 'MOVIE', 'entirely', 'relationship', 'Missy', 'Willie', 'Willie', 'had', 'left', 'town', 'young', 'age', 'due', 'tragedy', 'family', 'came', 'back', 'claiming', 'be', 'guy', 'named', 'Nate', 'again', 'NOT', 'true', 'book', '.-', 'total', 'FIVE', 'LCS', 'movies', 'right', 'FIVE', 'are', 'entirely', 'Missy', 'family', 'family', 'being', 'made', 'mostly', 'randomly', 'adopted', 'children', 'Willie', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'was', 'sheriff', 'town', 'what', 'Missy', 'back', 'only', 'child-', 'son', 'live', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'love', 'Zach', 'Taylor', 'who', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""N'T"", 'ANYWHERE', 'IN', 'THE', 'BOOKS', 'let', 'alone', 'Missy', 'love', 'interest.-', 'Belinda', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'surprise', 'youngest', 'child', 'series', 'orphan', 'who', 'arrived', 'orphan', 'train', 'brother', 'promptly', 'adopted', 'Missy', 'thus', 'becoming', 'Missy', 'daughter', 'Belinda', 'story', 'then', 'be', 'mish-mash', 'younger', 'Melissa', 'storylines', 'However', 'here', 'sit', 'watching', 'Belinda', 'Drew', 'get', 'married', 'end', 'Love', 'Unfolding', 'Dream.-', 'Names', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'turned', 'upside-down', 'place', 'Clark', 'Marty', 'other', 'children', 'are', 'barely', 'given', 'thought', 'books', 'are', 'peppered', 'events', 'lives', 'instance', 'so', 'far', 'Luke', 'Belind', 'older', 'brother', 'doctor', 'part', 'inspiration', 'anywhere', 'films', 'Ok', 'now', 'Love', 'Takes', 'Wing', 'starting', 'did', 'Belinda', 'just', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'Drew', 'now', 'find', 'Belinda', 'sharing', 'spotlight', 'friend', 'Annie', 'opening', 'clinic', 'frontier', 'town', 'Skipped', 'Boston', 'completely', 'what', 'understand', 'Annie', 'played', 'Haylie', 'Duff', 'will', 'be', 'main', 'character', 'final', 'film', 'here', 'depressed', 'Belinda', 'completely', 'rejecting', 'faith', 'anger', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'resolved', 'end', 'series', 'claiming', 'God', ""n't"", 'exist.Now', 'positive', 'comments', 'So', 'far', 'am', 'now', 'well', 'seventh', 'movie', 'conservative', 'values', 'are', 'upheld', 'fairly', 'well', 'mostly', 'family-friendly', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'own', 'preschoolers', 'watch', 'due', 'themes', 'death', 'see', 'come', 'up', 'least', 'once', 'film', 'occasional', 'mild', 'very', 'brief', 'violence', 'do', 'cringe', 'little', 'lines', ""'re"", 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'themes', 'love', 'faith', 'compassion', 'come', 'least', 'first', 'six', 'films', 'harsh', 'language', 'sexual', 'situations', 'overtly', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'have', 'only', 'noticed', 'scenes', 'directly', 'involving', 'prayer', 'scripture', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'films', 'seem', 'attempt', 'being', 'made', 'least', 'keep', 'focus', 'Christian', 'values', 'Hence', 'two', 'stars.As', 'kids', 'get', 'older', 'will', 'definitely', 'consider', 'adding', 'video', 'collection', 'good', 'option', 'will', 'appeal', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'again', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'ANYBODY', 'could', 'think', 'films', 'follow', 'books', 'lovely', 'little', 'series', ""'re"", 'really', 'interested', 'Janette', 'Oke', 'works', 'read', 'watching']",N/A

It is a series of exceptional stories sure to inspire as well as entertain. Hardships are felt and you will empathize with family losses, as well as feel the exuberance of success when a character achieves. It is a family oriented set true to it's name, ""Love Comes Softly.""Of course, a series based on books cannot add all that can be placed into a book. If you want more quantity to these stories, pick up the book set. You will find them quite similar, but no film version can include all that an author can place in pages. Even so, this set of film stories ranks high among the family/romance/historical viewers from almost any generation. It is for Grandparents to Jr. Hi. and men or women. Of course the underlying characteristic of this series is the Christian spirit of many of the characters, and how that changes or guides the lives of the people you will meet in the stories, but the DVDs do not get preachy.An excellent period film with a wholesome story throughout. Good FAMILY viewing, with action, suspense, drama, and some romance. The series is based on the books of Janette Oke. OK they are all Oke stories, so we all know they will each end deliciously heartwarming and acceptable. But not till we have some heroics, suspense, and fist-o-cuffs. It can't all be sweet out west.This collection offers the complete set and a lower price and well worth the retail.

It shows how life can start out as a dream with your husband or wife and all of a sudden it changes, but love can come softly again with the right person and the teaching of trying and never giving up is a good lesson for us all. Life is precious and in these series it shows that from time to time, but then true love sparks again and again with tender stories of fighting with the cattlemen russlers robberies, traveling in covered wagons and the excitment of what is ahead for them coming from the east to find land for themselfs and be free.  A great series for those of us who are searching for our ancestors it give me anyway the feeling of how my family traveled from other countries to here in the USA how they worked for others in the states and decided it was time for them to make a home for theirselfs in a land that wasn't settled just yet.
