Mystery Science Theater 3000 was cancelled because it was getting too popular and the rights to movies became too expensive.  Now WKRP in Cincinnati is being altered because of music rights.  I'm surprised certain clothing lines haven't demanded money for the rights to Beverly Hills 90210.  (Quick, airbrush their clothes!!!!)Here's an idea for Fox.  Instead of charging the $39.98 market price for the DVD set, charge $54.98.  That would add $15 per sale extra into the budget.  If you sell a meer 100,000 copies of the DVD (which I believe the city of Cincinnati, itself, would purchase) you then have $1.5 million to put towards the rights of the original songs.  Just think if you sell a million copies or more.  I personally would spend more money to get the original versions of the episodes instead of these blasphemous shells of a great show.

The story of a small radio station  in the 1970's which changed its format from easy listening to rock & roll. Gary Sandy, Frank Bonner, Gordon Jump, Tim Reid, Richard Sanders, Lori Anderson and Howard Hesseman made this show a classic. Who could forget the classic Turkey Dropo episode? NOT ME! It was A CRAZY show that worked on many levels. After the Mary Tyler Moore show, this was the best comedy MTM ever didIt's almost Thirty years later. it is being released to DVD. and the news is not good.  The version of the SO CALLED complete first season is being released. Some of the  episodes are the syndicated version (which ran on Nick at Nite/TV Land) and most are missing the music which made this show. A few  episodes of the DVD has had cuts the first act for time (episode like Hoodlum Rock, Never Leave Me, Lucille and others)..that is not complete, unless you mean all the episodes are here.  That is not a DVD release, that like a bootlegged home record from TV Land, This is similar to what happenned with Bossom Buddies DVD(see my review)DONT BLAME FOX  DVD TOTALLY. Music licensing has gone thru the roof. Bob Segar, Pink Floyd, Bob Segar, Foreigner, Ted Nugent , Eddie Money, The Beach Boys and Elvis Presley(his JailHouse Rock)  are a few of the artists that are changed or cut from these eposodes. Even Jennifer's doorbell which plays ""Fly me to the Moon "" is replacedSomeone may ask why it gets 3 stars. No matter if it is cut or not, You cant change the chatacters and the acting of Tim Reid's Venus Fly Trap, Lori Anderson's Jenniffer, Richard Sanders's Les Nesman, Frank Bonner's Herb and Howard Hesseman as DOCTOR JOHNNY FEVER (who was taken off the air on anoher station for saying BOOGER). With such great acting, The DVD survives.

1051772,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000MXPE6U,calvinnme,"[8, 17]","This is a day I never thought would come due to all of the copyrighted music in the show. Running only four short seasons from 1978-1982, this was one of the most perfect shows of its time, and a near dead on commentary on small media outlets. How ironic that the premise of the show was Andy's attempt as program director to prevent another free-form rock station from playing mediocre music, and now the current pack of  vampires running the recording industry and their irresponsible greed are exactly why we may have that same mediocre music that Andy held in such great disdain replacing the great rock hits that were an essential part of the show.One of my personal favorite episodes from season one was ""Hold Up"", where the stereo store remote broadcast became a robbery situation. The engineer, Bucky Dornster, came out of the bathroom and headed for the front door on his lunch break. The robber, who was a frustrated DJ, orders him to stop. The engineer turns around and casually says, ""I am a member of the radio engineer's union, local 533 (or something like that), and it's time for my lunch break."" The robber asks Johnny Fever, ""Is he really in the union?"" Johnny nods, and the robber moves out of the way and lets Bucky out, because he doesn't want any trouble with the union. Bucky walks right past a pay phone and goes to lunch, never bothering to call the police.""Fish Story"" probably wouldn't air on TV today because it was so un-PC. On a day when a reporter is coming to do a story on WKRP, Mr. Carlson unveils his latest promotion idea: dressing Herb up as the station mascot, the KRP Carp. At the same time, Johnny and Venus are taking an on-air test to demonstrate the effects of alcohol upon the average driver. While Venus' reaction times slow down as expected, it turns out that the more alcohol Johnny ingests, the faster his reaction times get, much to the chagrin of the officer administering the test.Then of course there's the unforgettable Thanksgiving episode, ""Turkeys Away"". This has got to be the best holiday episode of any series. The Big Guy, Herb, and Les try to handle the Thanksgiving promotion themselves. They keep the promotion a secret from the others - which turns out to be a plan to drop live turkeys from a helicopter to a crowd at the local mall. They have forgotten one small point - turkeys can't fly. Les' on the spot reporting, from his slow reading of the sky banner, to his spot on imitation of the Hindenburg disaster report as he describes how the turkeys are crashing through the car windshields, is a comedy classic. The reactions of Andy and Dr. Johnny Fever in the broadcast booth are great too. And then to finally see the Big Guy and Herb returning to the station covered in feathers after the turkeys have ""regrouped and turned on them"" is just a comedy classic. And of course there's the Big Guy's memorable line ""I swear, as God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly!""And finally there's Les and his ""walls"". In his great need for respect and self esteem, he wanted walls (an office of his own) so much, that he put masking tape on the floor where he wanted them to be - and everyone he worked with, without any question or comment at all, proceeded to pretend that those walls were there and acted accordingly all for Les's sake.WKRP was a refreshing little show during a time when many of the sitcoms were taking on serious tones. Its writers understood the comedy part of situation-comedy. Although I was sad when it was cancelled, the fact that it was on just four seasons meant that it never really had to change its format and in retrospect probably had a perfect show life.

If you remember the initial run of the show, it had tons of pop and rock music, songs that often very wittily commented on the story. Getting the rights to all that music was deemed far too expensive. According to reports, this package either (a) put the original song back in or (b) put in another song that was deemed a good fit. Both are better than what is currently being shown on television, with non-descript music in the background, or sometimes scenes cut because without the original music, it doesn't make sense.WKRP was originally pitched as a male Mary Tyler Moore, with Gary Sandy playing the straight man to a radio station full of crazy people. The show turned into so much more thanks to amazing cast and a pitch perfect writing (Come on, does anyone think of Howard Hesseman as anything BUT Dr. Johnny Fever) So many amazing episodes, more often that not based on a somewhat true story. (Yes, Herb's infamous ""Dancing Ducks"" promotion happened at a station in Atlanta, and the Turkey Drop was based on Thanksgiving promotion gone wrong in Dallas)To answer another long time question, there are no lyrics to the closing song.

Elements of the show were dated even in 1978 when this show premiered - most notably the DJ dialogue.  Some of the costuming is hilarious and I'm pretty sure bell-bottoms had been out of style for awhile, although my high school yearbook from the same year is pretty awful too.  For younger people who have never seen this series life before MTV might be of interest.What made this series great was the cast of characters and their struggles to achieve their dreams and find their place in a world that was recovering from social upheaval and on the cusp of undergoing massive technological changes.  In the beginning of the series several of the characters were completely stereotyped, but as the show progressed through the years they were able to break through the stereotypes and become more well rounded.  Loni Anderson's character was genius as a beautiful secretary who used her smarts and wit to deflect sexual harrassment and disrespect in the workplace while maintaining her femininity, a role model for women as they entered the workforce in greater numbers during the 1970s.Whether you have seen this series or have never watched an episode, it is worth a look!",4,Still funny after all these years,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,1248,"['core', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'Season', '1', 'still', 'entertaining', 'sitcom', 'Elements', 'show', 'were', 'dated', 'even', '1978', 'when', 'show', 'premiered', 'most', 'notably', 'DJ', 'dialogue', 'costuming', 'hilarious', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'bell-bottoms', 'had', 'been', 'style', 'awhile', 'high', 'school', 'yearbook', 'same', 'year', 'pretty', 'awful', 'too', 'younger', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'life', 'MTV', 'might', 'be', 'interest.What', 'made', 'series', 'great', 'was', 'cast', 'characters', 'struggles', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'was', 'recovering', 'social', 'upheaval', 'cusp', 'undergoing', 'massive', 'technological', 'changes', 'beginning', 'series', 'several', 'characters', 'were', 'completely', 'stereotyped', 'show', 'progressed', 'years', 'were', 'able', 'break', 'stereotypes', 'become', 'more', 'well', 'rounded', 'Loni', 'Anderson', 'character', 'was', 'genius', 'beautiful', 'secretary', 'who', 'used', 'smarts', 'wit', 'deflect', 'sexual', 'harrassment', 'disrespect', 'workplace', 'maintaining', 'femininity', 'role', 'model', 'women', 'entered', 'workforce', 'greater', 'numbers', '1970s.Whether', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'look']",N/A

The expensive version would only sell to hardcore fans -- there would be no additional seasons.  Contrary to the silly claims made by some of the reviewers, the music was NOT what the series was all about.  That was the setting.  Like any good series, what WKRP was about was the characters and their relationships with each other.  Unfortunately, economic reality means there is probably no way we'll get the original music.  Do we have to cut off our noses to spite our faces with a childish ""all or nothing"" attitude?It is much less defensible that some of the episodes are apparantly cut from their original broadcast versions.  But why not enjoy what we can for now?  If this set sells well, there may be a more complete reissue later.  If it does not sell well -- if too many people refuse to buy it because of the cuts, then there will definitely NEVER be a reissue.  There will be no season 2, no season 3, no nothing.I, for one, am delighted that this set is becoming available, despite its faults.  I hope it sells well, and many people write the company to voice their concerns about the cuts.  That is the only way we'll ever get any more WKRP at all, much less better presented WKRP.It is pathetic to see so many whiny babies give low ratings to the long overdue release of this excellent series, even if the release is less than perfect.

But I think the die hard fans who would pay $60 plus for this set are in the MINORITY. Here's the evidence:Paramount released the first season of Laverne & Shirley two years ago for 39.95.  It was a half season of 13 shows, bringing the per show cost to $3. The high cost was probably due to music rights. Fans stayed away in droves.  Most of them decided the show was too expensive.The studios exist to make money. They like to keep the fans happy, but they will NOT lose money doing it.  Remastering these old programs is expensive.  No one makes an investment unless they think there's a chance they'll make a profit on that investment.  It's just common sense.We also can't blame musicians or copyright holders.  With record companies losing money because of free downloads, they can't afford to make the rights to their songs cheap.What's the solution? Perhaps giving the music owners a percentage of sales instead of paying them up front, to keep the cost of the dvd's as low as possible.  If they sell a lot, then both parties will benefit. Of course, you'll have haggling over the percentage. Everything boils down to money, unfortunately.I love this show.  I haven't seen it in years.

Because the people involved with making the show - actors, writers, producer, creator, director, etc - DESERVE the 5 stars...NOT only one! I'm afraid if anyone NOT familiar with the series sees all these bad post ratings, they won't give it a shot.I watched this set, intending to be turned off by the changes; in fact, there are glaring, obvious edits and music changes that are disappointing; but as soon as I got into the stories themselves, I found myself overwhelmingly enjoying this excellent show again after all these years. The stories and the cast ensemble are so polished and superior to most other shows that even the lamest of storylines comes across as fresh and hilarious.I'm urging fans of this show to buy this set - because if it brings in decent revenue for Fox, they may consider trying harder to keep all the original music for following sets (it was basically a money/copyright matter that kept 'em out). If it doesn't sell well, we may have to wait two or three years for season two, if they release another one at all. I honestly feel once you start watching these shows, your anger over the changes will subside a few degrees (as did mine) and you'll be happy you made the purchase. (I may be a little biased, as I've been in the entertainment biz for over 40 years - radio for most of it - and I can relate to many of the stories and characters.)Still don't wanna buy it but yer still a fan?

But I'd rather have WKRP with some substituted music than not have WKRP at all.  It's that simple.If you know where to look you can buy bootleg copies of the entire series on DVD, but you take your chances with the disc quality.  I bought the entire series last year on bootleg DVD and while it generally is watchable there are some disc defects that prevent me from watching about 15 percent of the episodes.  It was quite an ordeal just to get the DVDs in the first place and I don't feel up to the task of pushing for replacment discs.I feel better about ""official"" releases such as this one.Having all the original music would have been great, but I'm a fan of the show itself and the music was just icing on the cake.  Give me the cake anyday.REVISED COMMENTS:**********Okay, I'm not allowed to revise my star rating but now I'm gonna have to drop it down a couple to 3 stars tops.  I knew going into this that much of the original music would be replaced or dropped for $$$ reasons, but I naively assumed the studio would make an effort to retain at least SOME of it where it was integral to the plot.  For example, what good is the Ivan episode without ""Tiny Dancer""?  But no, that song won't make it in at all and the lyric lines spoken from the song in normal dialogue scenes have been redubbed.  WTF?  And for them not even ponying up a buck or two for ""Fly Me To The Moon"" for Jennifer's doorbell?  I mean, COME ON!One thing is for darn sure -- I will cancel me pre-order and RENT this from my local independently-owned video/DVD store before I even consider purchasing it.  If the studios had made even a REASONABLE attempt to keep even SOME of the original music, then I would have been willing to pay a little extra.  Many of us would.  But to drop ALL of it and not pay a buck or two for even a LITTLE of it, not to mention giving us the syndicated cuts of the shows (granted, there may have been other issues in play with that decision)....?Sounds like this release is going to be a dishonor to both the show itself and its fans.The show itself is a treasure and the moments between the generic music are what made the show so much fun.  I never get tired of watching Frank Bonner's ""Herb Tarlek"".  But I am dismayed that the studio decided to scrap ALL the music when it should have been feasible to pay for at least key moments of it.  The show is still funny.  But the studio who produced the DVD should be ashamed of themselves for making such a deliberately weak effort with the music.",5,REVISED REVIEW,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,2600,"['ORIGINAL', 'REVIEW', 'understand', 'issue', 'music', 'rights', 'Makes', 'perfect', 'business', 'sense', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'WKRP', 'substituted', 'music', 'not', 'have', 'WKRP', 'simple.If', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'can', 'buy', 'bootleg', 'copies', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'take', 'chances', 'disc', 'quality', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'last', 'year', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'generally', 'watchable', 'are', 'disc', 'defects', 'prevent', 'watching', '15', 'percent', 'episodes', 'was', 'quite', 'ordeal', 'just', 'get', 'DVDs', 'first', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'up', 'task', 'pushing', 'replacment', 'discs.I', 'feel', 'better', 'official', 'releases', 'such', 'one.Having', 'original', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', ""'m"", 'fan', 'show', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', 'Give', 'cake', 'anyday.REVISED', 'COMMENTS', '**********Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'allowed', 'revise', 'star', 'rating', 'now', ""'m"", 'gon', 'have', 'drop', 'down', 'couple', '3', 'stars', 'tops', 'knew', 'going', 'much', 'original', 'music', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'dropped', 'reasons', 'naively', 'assumed', 'studio', 'would', 'make', 'effort', 'retain', 'least', 'SOME', 'where', 'was', 'integral', 'plot', 'example', 'what', 'good', 'Ivan', 'episode', 'Tiny', 'Dancer', 'song', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'lyric', 'lines', 'spoken', 'song', 'normal', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'have', 'been', 'redubbed', 'WTF', 'not', 'even', 'ponying', 'up', 'buck', 'two', 'Fly', 'Me', 'Moon', 'Jennifer', 'doorbell', 'mean', 'COME', 'ON', 'One', 'thing', 'darn', 'sure', 'will', 'cancel', 'pre-order', 'RENT', 'local', 'independently-owned', 'video/DVD', 'store', 'even', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'studios', 'had', 'made', 'even', 'REASONABLE', 'attempt', 'keep', 'even', 'SOME', 'original', 'music', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'pay', 'little', 'extra', 'Many', 'would', 'drop', 'not', 'pay', 'buck', 'two', 'even', 'LITTLE', 'not', 'mention', 'giving', 'syndicated', 'cuts', 'shows', 'granted', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'issues', 'play', 'decision', 'release', 'going', 'be', 'dishonor', 'show', 'fans.The', 'show', 'treasure', 'moments', 'generic', 'music', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'Frank', 'Bonner', 'Herb', 'Tarlek', 'am', 'dismayed', 'studio', 'decided', 'scrap', 'music', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'feasible', 'pay', 'least', 'key', 'moments', 'show', 'still', 'funny', 'studio', 'who', 'produced', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'making', 'such', 'deliberately', 'weak', 'effort', 'music']",N/A

We do have the DVD, so the content we are critiquing is not ""sight unseen.""  What this is about, for us, is the memories.  Part of what marks out the human experience as special is our ability to relive enjoyable moments of our past.  They give us a context for our own identity, a path to the now and the future of our self, that makes our life a continuous whole.  When a significant creative work such as this, that forms one of the better memories in entertainment history, is chopped to bits due to budgetary shortsightedness, our personal past has been invaded, and our memories altered, and we are supposed to just be happy about that.  FOX does not realize that this, more than liking for a particular song, is at the bottom of the discontent over the edited, no, mutilated, release of this show.  Do you realize the irony here?  A basic WKRP theme, essential to the creative expression of the show, was that authenticity would always win the day over the [...] and artificial.  The creators of the show deliberately used the idea of rock music's authenticity in opposition to disco's artificiality to carry this message.  The characters mirrored this fundamental contrast in nearly every episode.  To go back and remove that symbol of authenticity, and replace it with the very thing the creators of the show found most repugnant, is to insult and deface the single most enriching memory created by that show, that authenticity is good, and a right way to live.  Johnny and the gang wouldn't stand for it.  As they are fictional characters, they have no voice in the matter.

What possible benefit is there to licensing rights owners to keeping music out of circulation by refusing to make some sort of reasonable financial provision for licensing music for tv shows on DVD?This is of course also why we will never see The Wonder Years on DVD in its original form.While the series was legendary I will reserve final judgement on this DVD set until we see what was kept and what wasn't as regards the music.,4,Wait and see attitude,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1005,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'WKRP', 'original', 'run', 'Never', 'sitcom', 'so', 'successfully', 'satirized', 'popular', 'culture', 'such', 'believable', 'manner', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'wonderful', 'period', 'piece.I', 'think', 'sad', 'commentary', 'music', 'industry', 'country', 'ridiculously', 'unrealistic', 'financial', 'demands', 'are', 'made', 'owners', 'make', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'license', 'commercially', 'released', 'music', 'order', 'make', 'release', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'feasible.What', 'precisely', 'music', 'business', 'kind', 'industry', 'standard', 'practice', 'impossible', 'What', 'possible', 'benefit', 'there', 'licensing', 'rights', 'owners', 'keeping', 'music', 'circulation', 'refusing', 'make', 'sort', 'reasonable', 'financial', 'provision', 'licensing', 'music', 'tv', 'shows', 'DVD', 'course', 'also', 'why', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'DVD', 'original', 'form.While', 'series', 'was', 'legendary', 'will', 'reserve', 'final', 'judgement', 'DVD', 'set', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'kept', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'regards', 'music']",N/A

Man does it ever! Easily one of the best written and acted comedy shows ever. Don't let the folks carping about the music keep you from this gem.

People naturally get angry at the companies releasing the dvds, and maybe they're right, but I'm more angry at the music industry for not appreciating how stupid it is NOT to make their music available for these releases. I don't know how many cds I've bought over the years because I heard a great song on a tv program, but it's been quite a few.

There is no sense crying over spilled milk-if musical artists do not want there music on the DVD, c'est la vie.This, however, does not deter from the fact that this is, in my opinion at least, the most hysterical sitcom ever.  On this DVD, immortal characters such as Les Nessman (two time winner of the Buckeye Newshawk Award and the coveted ""Silver Sow"" Award), Arthur ""Big Guy"" Carlson, and Herb Tarlek run amok in comedic ineptitude.  Who can forget where they were when the immortal words were uttered by laid-back deejay Johnny Fever:  ""The Pinedale shopping mall has just been bombed with live turkeys""?  Johnny Caravella upstages most every show, with his dry one-liners or simply by looking at you with his shaded sunglasses. Super groovy Venus Fly Trap always provides amusement as he is dressed like a nightmare pimp (""I have suits I can't even get parts for"") and lugs a gong around with him wherever he goes.  And then the three ""normal"" individuals in the line-up:  Andy Travis; Jennifer Marlowe-a blonde bombshell receptionist who makes a ridiculous sum of money and sets Herb's tongue a-wagging as he promises he can get her a side of beef for a date; and Bailey Quarters, a journalism graduate who could use some serious assertive training (if she can't handle Herb, Les, and the ""Big Guy"" who can she handle?).No matter how amusing the station personnel is, some of the guest stars on the show are even more hysterical:  Mama Carlson, owner of the station and the ""Big Guy's"" worst nightmare; Scum Of the Earth, a trio who gives even punk rock bands a bad name by physically attacking their audience; Bobby Boogie, the inept robber who holds up a live broadcast at Del's Stereo and Sound (where did the budget come from for Herb and Del's styrofoam-processed suits); Herb's wife, Lucille (played by the always funny Edie McClurg); a disturbingly hip funeral director who wishes to advertise to sell ""pre-need"" to young people; Hoyt Axton as a long lost love interest of Jennifer's; Mr. Carlson's son, a four-foot tall replica of General Patton; and, perhaps my two favorites, Officer Buddy Pliler (the man running the on -air drunk campaign that Johnny puts a serious monkey wrench into) and the absolutely awesome Reverend Little Ed Pembrooke and his Toe-to-Toe with Satan Church Of the Mighty Struggle (and don't forget his Merciful Sisters of Melody in the background).As with any sit-com, some of the styles and vocabulary are dated and sometimes WKRP tries hard to deliver a message (the horror of the Vietnam War and homosexuality) but on the whole it will always make you laugh, even with the dubbed-in sounds.",5,I'm Living On The Air In Cincinnati,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,3011,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'WKRP', 'Cincinnati', 'ever', 'was', 'child', 'yes', 'have', 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'dubbed-in', 'music', 'what', 'FOX', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'improve', 'things', 'believe', 'most', 'missed', 'musical', 'selection', 'was', 'Dogs', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'agree', 'different', 'route', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'simply', 'editing', 'dogs', 'barking', 'background', 'sense', 'crying', 'over', 'spilled', 'milk-if', 'musical', 'artists', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'music', 'DVD', ""c'est"", 'la', 'vie.This', 'however', 'not', 'deter', 'fact', 'opinion', 'least', 'most', 'hysterical', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'DVD', 'immortal', 'characters', 'such', 'Les', 'Nessman', 'two', 'time', 'winner', 'Buckeye', 'Newshawk', 'Award', 'coveted', 'Silver', 'Sow', 'Award', 'Arthur', 'Big', 'Guy', 'Carlson', 'Herb', 'Tarlek', 'run', 'amok', 'comedic', 'ineptitude', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'immortal', 'words', 'were', 'uttered', 'laid-back', 'deejay', 'Johnny', 'Fever', 'Pinedale', 'shopping', 'mall', 'just', 'been', 'bombed', 'live', 'turkeys', 'Johnny', 'Caravella', 'most', 'show', 'dry', 'one-liners', 'simply', 'looking', 'shaded', 'sunglasses', 'Super', 'groovy', 'Venus', 'Fly', 'Trap', 'always', 'amusement', 'dressed', 'nightmare', 'pimp', 'have', 'suits', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'parts', 'gong', 'wherever', 'then', 'three', 'normal', 'individuals', 'line-up', 'Andy', 'Travis', 'Jennifer', 'Marlowe-a', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'receptionist', 'who', 'ridiculous', 'sum', 'money', 'Herb', 'tongue', 'a-wagging', 'can', 'get', 'side', 'beef', 'date', 'Bailey', 'Quarters', 'journalism', 'graduate', 'who', 'could', 'use', 'serious', 'assertive', 'training', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'Herb', 'Les', 'Big', 'Guy', 'who', 'can', 'handle', '.No', 'matter', 'how', 'amusing', 'station', 'personnel', 'guest', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'hysterical', 'Mama', 'Carlson', 'owner', 'station', 'Big', 'Guy', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'Scum', 'Earth', 'trio', 'who', 'even', 'punk', 'rock', 'bad', 'name', 'physically', 'attacking', 'audience', 'Bobby', 'Boogie', 'inept', 'robber', 'who', 'up', 'live', 'broadcast', 'Del', 'Stereo', 'Sound', 'where', 'did', 'budget', 'come', 'Herb', 'Del', 'styrofoam-processed', 'suits', 'Herb', 'wife', 'Lucille', 'played', 'always', 'funny', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'disturbingly', 'hip', 'funeral', 'director', 'who', 'advertise', 'sell', 'pre-need', 'young', 'people', 'Hoyt', 'Axton', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'interest', 'Jennifer', 'Mr.', 'Carlson', 'son', 'four-foot', 'tall', 'replica', 'General', 'Patton', 'perhaps', 'two', 'favorites', 'Officer', 'Buddy', 'Pliler', 'man', 'running', '-air', 'drunk', 'campaign', 'Johnny', 'serious', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'Reverend', 'Little', 'Ed', 'Pembrooke', 'Toe-to-Toe', 'Satan', 'Church', 'Mighty', 'Struggle', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Merciful', 'Sisters', 'Melody', 'background', '.As', 'sit-com', 'styles', 'vocabulary', 'are', 'dated', 'sometimes', 'WKRP', 'hard', 'deliver', 'message', 'horror', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'homosexuality', 'whole', 'will', 'always', 'make', 'even', 'dubbed-in', 'sounds']",N/A

Every real fan of this show knows exactly what I mean! To remove ALL the songs....ALL of them! To change dialog or to remove whole sections of the show because there's no easy way to excise dialog interwoven with music. To re-dub new dialog to cover-up this radical surgery. To utilize cut, awful syndicated prints because there is no other way to cover the damage. This is NOT the Complete WKRP as advertised. This is an Opera with the music removed. What are you watching when you see this? I am old enough to have loved this show in its original run. Part of the fun was the shock of hearing rock in a sitcom. And how it was so cleverly, even lovingly utilized! This bowdlerized DVD collection is NOT the complete WKRP. It is a travesty that should disappear quickly and without a trace. I canceled my pre-order, as painful as that was. I will not be a party to this constant lowering of standards.

""Mike""","[13, 17]","I picked up a cheap used copy of this set and saw the notice about some musical content being removed, but figured, 'so, they cut a few songs, no biggie.'  I was wrong.  Believe the reviews--Fox really did butcher this season.  The music was such a huge part of WKRP that without it, the show feels like a rock band without the drummer: it's fine sometimes but it never really kicks like it should.  I don't know which songs were axed, but the edits mess up the flow of the episodes, leaving them feeling choppy.  You'll undoubtedly sense that something is missing, even if you don't know what.I suspect Fox did this because in 1978, studios didn't typically include non-broadcast media in their music licenses (remember, VHS tapes had only been out for two years and there were no DVDs, so it would have taken a visionary studio exec to realize that selling copies of old series would someday be a big business...and guess how many visionary studio execs there are!).  When they were preparing this release, they probably simply figured that licensing the music would cost more than they would make in sales and broke out the carving knives.Your choice, then, is whether you want to buy a neutered version of WKRP or not have it at all.

Obvoiusly, I've not read all 310 reviews, but I have read many, many of them. And as I thought about what I read, something interesting entered my mind.Fox issued both ""WKRP"" and ""M*A*S*H,"" did they not? Have you thought about the musical content in ""M*A*S*H?"" In earlier episodes ""My Blue Heaven"" was darn near a part of every other episode. In an episode called ""The Long John Flap,"" as Hawkeye and Trapper are leaving the mess tent bound for the swamp, Hawkeye is singing ""In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening."" There's an episode where a sloshed Frank is singing a slight variation on ""The More I See You."" When the whole camp is trying to watch ""My Darling Clementine,"" Margaret sings an entire song that I've heard before but can't recall the title of. ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" was also used quite a bit. There's alot of music in the episode ""Showtime."" B.J. sings ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" while drunk. An episode has Trapper singing ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" while operating. There are more instances where songs are either sung or recited.Now, in NO WAY knocking ""M*A*S*H"" (because I love the show, seasons 1-5 especially), but how is it that Fox had no problem getting permission to use every bit of music for an entire 11 season series, but one season of a four year series has botched dialogue, lost jokes, scenes that make no sense, and impersonator voice overs due to horrible editing? Is someone at Fox more partial to ""M*A*S*H"" than to ""WKRP?"" Do they feel that in the case of ""WKRP"" they find themselves in posession of such a dud that it doesn't deserve the effort that ""M*A*S*H"" did?Honestly, when you watch this, you feel as though some really eager individual who loves his job was anxiously sitting with a butcher knife waiting for any use of lyric or music so that he could test it's sharpness! For example, when Herb is trying to enlist singers for the Ferryman Funeral Home account, he asks Johnny to sing something. Johnny sings: ""Good-bye, for now"" as he wheels his seat backwards to the door and waves. On the DVD Johnny has no dialogue. All we see is him waving, leaving a first time viewer with the impression that the audience may have over-reacted to that scene. In that same scene, when Herb and Venus are asking Jennifer to sing, Herb begins quoting (not singing, mind you, QUOTING) ""Sing"" by The Carpenters. Well, that's been removed. Again, it sounds like an audience over-reaction! To quote a line from Johhny in this episode: ""This is deeply weird."" And that's just one example!In short, this set's a mess! If I had known what Fox had done, I'd never have bought this.

Considering the fact that creator Hugh Wilson wanted real music to be used in the show, even to the point of sacrificing the use of film for shooting the show (to get cheaper licensing rates which existed at the time). While I think that 95% of ""classic"" rock is horrible, it was still part of the show and as much of the music as possible should be retained.Consider the fact that Universal could license each and every song in Miami Vice on DVD and keep the costs reasonable. Also consider the fact that Fox did bother to license ""Hot Blooded"" for a Simpsons episode on DVD, and Sony paid to use ""Fly Me to the Moon"" for an episode of What's Happening on DVD. I have trouble believing that Fox even tried to get any of the original music.Not one episode is as it originally aired. Two episodes are even syndicated versions, running two minutes shorter than the original broadcasts. In short, this release is worse than a travesty.

The ""canned"", non-specific rock-and-roll strains don't bother me that much, but the absolute RIDICULOUSNESS of the episode with the unwinnable contest was too much to bear!  In the original, they pieced together one or two notes from six unrecognizable songs that they were SURE people wouldn't be able to identify (and which, in reality, nobody ever could have!)  Well, not only did they actually string together six DIFFERENT one or two note clips and redub them, they eliminated the names of the original songs and groups and substituted stupidly fabricated song and group names!  And in the tornado episode, they edited out the Star Spangled Banner, of all things, and replaced it with a BAD midi version of another patriotic song.  You mean to tell me that the National Anthem isn't in the public domain?!?!?!?! And Jennifer's doorbell, which used to play ""Fly Me To The Moon"" is now ""Beautiful Dreamer"".

For many of us the highlight of the week was to watch this show on TV. The success of this show is due to Bill Dial, a great writer, and a team of wonderful actors who made this show stand out as one of the Top 5 on my all time great sitcom lists. The show starred Gordon Jump as befuddled yet always beloved station manager Arthur Carlson; Gary Sandy as self assured program director Andy Travis; Loni Anderson as brainy and beautiful Jennifer Marlowe as the highest paid station receptionist; Experienced actor Howard Hesseman as a down and out disc jockey; Tim Reid as the only African American character on the show as a DJ; Jan Smithers as lovable Bailey Quarters as publicity director; Frank Bonner as a sleazy, kick-back taking and womanizing sales director; and Richard Sanders as funny, accident-prone news director with interest in hogs and dislike for communism. The first season of the show aired some of the best episodes of the series; Turkey Give Away is widely regarded as the best show of the series and one would like to remember the funniest moments of this show from this particular episode. I Want to Keep My Baby is another episode that shows the emotional and human side of the members of the station when a mother leaves her infant baby at the station. Everyone wants to offer their love and support for the baby and everyone pull in together as a family. Tornado is another episode that shows how a radio station could help the public during a tragedy when a young boy calls the station for help after his house is hit with a tornado.

They make me want to hate it, really.  And I find I am still a sucker for this show, just like I was when it originally ran and I was just out of college working as a DJ in the last decade of vinyl.  The negatives are significant - many people are justifiably unable to stomach the edited versions and the music.  I don't argue with their feelings here.  But the truth is, there is some incredible comic acting and writing captured in what you DO get and that alone is enough to win my money and my 4-star endorsement.  Gordon Jump, Richard Sanders, and Frank Bonner do not get enough credit for their incredible comic chops as the fall guys in this show that features many a plotline pitting the 'suits' against the 'dungarees.'  Loni Anderson is too often dismissed as a bimbo in a show where her timing and delivery were essential keys to its success.  These things are captured here and are wonderful to watch, despite the awful edits and music.  On top of that, the show did an amazing job of facing issues that were barely approachable for TV around 1980 - an un-insulting look at homosexuality, a sympathetic episode dealing with the trauma of serving in Vietnam, race issues, and so on.  This show explored a lot of significant stuff in a half-hour comedy series known as surreal.  The secret to why it is so great, however, is that those of us who worked in small-market, struggling radio stations know that this series was virtually spot-on with it's accurate depiction of small-time radio.

But, I'd give less than one star for how this product was put together.You watch, all these complaints about how this first season was done is going to cancel their decision to release the others.  I guess I should take this First Season of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" back to the store for a refund.  I'd hate to buy another collection from my favorite TV shows that may only release the first few seasons and then they discontinue releasing the other seasons because of all this negative backlash.Well, I guess we should have all seen this coming.  A TV show about a radio station that played actual songs.  Removing all the original songs kills the appeal (or even that specific comical moment) of what made this show so great.Since I haven't opened this First Season of WKRP, I'll just take it back to the store and I won't buy it again until I'm certain that all the seasons were released.  Then I'll buy it back again.But, you know what's really stupid?  ANY POSSIBLE EXCUSE they may have for removing the songs!!!!  I would think that having the songs on the show would help SELL the songs to the public.  Not hinder them.  If people heard ""Dogs"" by Pink Floyd on that episode, it would help sell that album again (or maybe it would just remain harmlessly insignificant, so any way you look at it: No negative damage would be done to anyone if this show was to be left alone as it was originally done with the original songs.  Song exposure would most likely benefit that music artist, not hurt them.  If I were a music artist, I would be proud that my song was becoming immortalized on a classic TV show.  My song and it's album might enjoy some more sales again.  Don't you think?  So, the consumer (you and me) are at a loss, the record companies lose another opportunity for a song to be heard, and eventually, the seller of this shoddy product may not enjoy increased sales, or sales of future seasons.  Everybody gets screwed!Here's another example. The movie ""American Graffiti"" had over 40 original songs in it.  Many songs I would have never heard of, or ever even made an effort to buy till I heard them in the movie. The songs from ""american Graffiti"" still enjoy exposure and record sales even to this day just because they were used to immortalize a scene on film.So, my question is (because I think we all have a right to know). Can anyone tell me a logical reason why these songs have to be removed from this show?  Who's at a LOSS for these songs to be used on this show?  The way I see it, nobody benefits from these decisions.  The original songs never get heard again and the whole show suffers from backlash for not being genuine.  Either the record companies are being stupid, or 20th Century Fox is making this stupid decision before even talking to the record companies.  Either way, everyone loses. You, me, them, everybody!UPDATE: I just rented the second DVD of this First Season box set of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"".  It's bad enough that the original songs have truly been removed, but I also see that the picture quality is very poor too.  Very fuzzy and blurry.  Our only opportunity to see Jan Smithers and Loni Anderson at their previous gorgeous best, doesn't look as good as it should with this poorly done, non-mastered video release.  I've seen better looking VHS tapes.So, yes, this DVD is very poorly recieved by all its true fans, including me.  I'm glad that I didn't open the copy that I bought last week.  I've still got my receipt, so I'm taking it back to the store and I don't think I'll ever bother to buy it again even if they do release all the seasons.

We lose the entire ""Giving it all I got"" exchange in the turkey episode, merely because of the Pink Floyd music issue, and even a throwaway line like Johnny's marvelous ""So long for a while..."" exit in the Ferryman's episode has to be cut, just to satisfy the Lawyers Who Rule The Earth!  SHAME ON THEM!!One of the pleasures of collecting classic TV series on DVD is to have them in their unspoiled entirety, and we have been cheated of such pleasure in this case.  That being said, it's still a great series, and is still mostly enjoyable, with only the occasional reminder of the savaging it has received.Kinda like watching ""Casablanca"" in color.P.S.  It's perversely satisfying to know the Lawyers goofed.  During the second appearance by Carlson's mother (an episode which raises the question of why a series needs a clip show only halfway through its first season...??), we're treated to a flashback to Johnny's ""Booger!"" rant from the pilot again.

1051880,A178LLZ84A2JB5,B000MXPE6U,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[1, 5]","WKRP is a quality sitcom, from top to bottom. It was based on the real WKRP radio station, which existed in Cincinnati. Back in the late 70s when WKRP premiered, there were still a few sitcoms on the tube, that took place in middle America. Other examples of such shows, were Mary Tyler Moore, and Bob Newhart. As a heartland-based show, WKRP certainly conveyed lots of heart.WKRP revolved around a group of lovable misfits. And they all wound-up, for one reason or another, working together at the marginal WKRP. The station Manager, Mr. Carlson (played with great comedic flair, by Gordon Jump), wants to improve the station's low ratings. So, he brings in a hip new programmer, who switches the format from old-time easy-listing music, to rock and roll. Day-to-day, the station still tries to hold its own, despite it's eccentric, and often incompetent staff.Best thing about this show, was the great ensemble cast. All of the characters, had distinctly different personalities. And the friction between them all, could be quite hilarious. The characters also displayed very human flaws, which the viewer could identify with. These days, most sitcoms have characters that have more than their share of good things; sexy looks, great careers, plenty of money, etc. By contrast, the characters on WKRP were lacking in many ways. But this managed to make these characters quite endearing to the average viewer, whose lives may not be the least bit glamorous.Hands-down, WKRP is among the best of the classic sitcoms.

When all of the negative feedback was coming in about the editing rumors and missing music, I thought twice about ordering this beloved program.Then I realized that all of these reviews were speculation. They were reviewing a product that HAD NOT been viewed by those writing. For those of you who were swayed by these negative pre-reviewers, please reconsider.I know the music is missing, but it really doesn't take away from the show. I was laughing just as hard when Les shimmyed on his Mr. Macho wig to a generic rock track as I did when I saw the original airing with ""Hot Blooded."" As a former radio DJ who lives and breathes music, the missing songs don't take away the polished writing and fine acting of a stellar cast.Additionally, if the original music rights were retained (a tough task considering how many tracks would be required to obtain licensing), this set would cost well over $100 for the consumer to purchase. Far less sets would be sold and future season releases would be scrapped. Look at what happened to ""American Dreams."" That series had a high price tag (due to publishing costs)and never saw further seasons released due to poor sales.If you are a fan of the series, don't let those numerous people deter you from enjoying a great series such as WKRP. To those who are reviewing a product you actually haven't seen at that point is not a legitimate (or fair) review. If you want to see future seasons, the first one needs to sell. I don't feel the missing music is a problem with viewing these fantastic episodes.

Included were newly filmed bumpers with Loni Anderson and Howard Hesseman. A total of 40 or so episodes were added to my collection, which I still have.The original music is a necessary and unavoidable component of WKRP. Jennifer's doorbell (Fly Me To The Moon), Supertramp's(Goodbye Stranger) playing in the background as Andy Travis shoves the contents of his desks onto the floor in anger in response to low ratings. It cannot be verbally explained why some songs during the original CBS-TV broadcasts in 1978 fit so well into the background of some episodes, they just did. A commentary on how talented the WKRP producers were in selecting appropriate music. The original music is vital in another aspect as well. It is a time capsule of what was going on in the music business in 1978, 79, 80, etc. WKRP aired just as Disco was coming to an end, traditional Rock was regaining its fitting, and Punk was just around the corner.
