1405269,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B004FRVDY6,G. Charles Steiner,"[4, 4]","It took me a while to write a review of this new DVD because, until today, Memorial Day, I never did the full 5-mile session offered here since I purchased it some time ago.  I found myself  so busy every day I was limited to one- or two-mile segments and, infrequently three.  Having now completed my first 5-mile session today with Leslie Sansone, I feel more confident to report on the contents:  it's totally wonderful, like swimming in a pool in your backyard, or like listening to smooth jazz  while getting a workout in a jacuzzi:  you're going to sweat and your muscles will be stretched and tested.This is my third 5-mile DVD workout with Leslie Sansone, and while I also have enjoyed the others, I like this one for the simple fact that it's unpretentious and it's just Leslie and me.  While some of the music is familiar from other DVDs and while almost all of the moves offer no surprise, there are new music pieces and none of the segments drag or go stale.  Everything is upbeat and pleasant without being excessive in the show business sense.The new twist here, for me, was doubling up on the workout bands so as to increase the workout's intensity.  Leslie introduces the idea of doubling the bands in the first session and gives the viewer a foretaste of such a workout in the second mile segment with one exercise, but it's in the fourth session that ""we"" use the doubling of the band throughout a good many exercises. I recently learned my arm strength isn't all that great having stopped weight-lifting now for almost a year and I actually didn't think doubling the bands on the fourth mile was such a good idea initially, but the choice of exercise for using two bands was something I did not predict and I found the workout good without having me burnt out or gasping for breath and wanting to quit by session's end.  The fifth session would be the test.  Would I get through it or would I want to -- faint?I barely noticed the fifth mile, it went by so quickly.This DVD is a keeper.  As I've already said, I've been doing the one and two-mile segments for a couple months and totally enjoy the experience, but I'm looking forward to integrating the 5-mile session now into my routine as soon as possible because it was a pleasant and good workout, one I feel I'd be a fool not to want to repeat.",5,Pleasant Easy Movements That Let You Sweat,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2318,"['took', 'while', 'write', 'review', 'new', 'DVD', 'today', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'never', 'did', 'full', '5-mile', 'session', 'offered', 'here', 'purchased', 'time', 'found', 'so', 'busy', 'day', 'was', 'limited', 'one-', 'two-mile', 'segments', 'infrequently', 'three', 'Having', 'now', 'completed', 'first', '5-mile', 'session', 'today', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'feel', 'more', 'confident', 'report', 'contents', 'totally', 'wonderful', 'swimming', 'pool', 'backyard', 'listening', 'smooth', 'jazz', 'getting', 'workout', 'jacuzzi', ""'re"", 'going', 'sweat', 'muscles', 'will', 'be', 'stretched', 'tested.This', 'third', '5-mile', 'DVD', 'workout', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'also', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'like', 'one', 'simple', 'fact', 'unpretentious', 'just', 'Leslie', 'music', 'familiar', 'other', 'DVDs', 'almost', 'moves', 'offer', 'surprise', 'are', 'new', 'music', 'pieces', 'none', 'segments', 'drag', 'go', 'stale', 'Everything', 'upbeat', 'pleasant', 'being', 'excessive', 'show', 'business', 'sense.The', 'new', 'twist', 'here', 'was', 'doubling', 'up', 'workout', 'so', 'increase', 'workout', 'intensity', 'Leslie', 'idea', 'doubling', 'bands', 'first', 'session', 'viewer', 'foretaste', 'such', 'workout', 'second', 'mile', 'segment', 'one', 'exercise', 'fourth', 'session', 'use', 'doubling', 'band', 'good', 'many', 'exercises', 'recently', 'learned', 'arm', 'strength', ""n't"", 'great', 'having', 'stopped', 'weight-lifting', 'now', 'almost', 'year', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'doubling', 'bands', 'fourth', 'mile', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'idea', 'initially', 'choice', 'exercise', 'using', 'two', 'bands', 'was', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'predict', 'found', 'workout', 'good', 'having', 'burnt', 'out', 'gasping', 'breath', 'wanting', 'quit', 'session', 'end', 'fifth', 'session', 'would', 'be', 'test', 'Would', 'get', 'would', 'want', 'faint', 'barely', 'noticed', 'fifth', 'mile', 'went', 'quickly.This', 'DVD', 'keeper', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'one', 'two-mile', 'segments', 'couple', 'months', 'totally', 'enjoy', 'experience', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'integrating', '5-mile', 'session', 'now', 'routine', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'was', 'pleasant', 'good', 'workout', 'one', 'feel', ""'d"", 'be', 'fool', 'not', 'want', 'repeat']",N/A
1405270,A1XJ3M3JTMD3HZ,B004FRVDY6,Honest,"[13, 17]","This video was so bad, I'll just go point by point:1. Leslie is constantly out of step. She has to do that little double step to get to her leading foot so many times I lost count. At one point, she is totally off beat. Part of the problem is that she talks so much that she forgets that she's supposed to be leading a workout video and loses focus. She does attempt to rearrange some of her choreography but it wasn't enough to save it from a poor rating from me.2. The music is barely audible the first mile. I found myself having to walk and fiddle with the remote.3. Song selection was poor. One of the songs was used 3 times throughout the workout. Leslie has been doing this a quarter of a century. You mean to tell me that she can't find enough unique songs for a 5-mile workout?4. At the end of the 4th mile (it may have been the third), the song stops abruptly. It was almost like someone bumped the stereo and it caused the CD to get off track. You could tell is was a foul up because Leslie even seems taken aback by it (you can tell by her movement at that point) and  just keeps exercising through the silence.5. I'm not certain that is truly 5 miles because the way the songs are played are so wonky/inconsistent. Shortly after the 4.5 mile point, she goes into the cool down and then stretch without a clear understanding of whether or not 5 miles had actually been accomplished or if she is counting the meager steps done within the stretch towards the total mileage of the workout.6. The intensity is poor due in part to the fact that every mile starts out slower than the one before ended. In other words, the pace isn't really progressive. I did 5 miles on my own, came in and saw my husband had bought this for me and popped it right in. You'd think after a 5 mile jog, doing this right after would wipe me out. Nope. In fact, it was so boring that I had enough breath while doing the workout to talk to my husband about how it might be time for Leslie to retire because she's obviously made so much money from this Walk At Home system that quality is no longer of importance to her. This was more like an extremely long cool down to my previous 5 mile jog.7. The band. The menu says that there are two bands included. There was only one in my DVD case. I bought mine from Wal-Mart. However, it doesn't matter because the workout is so boring that you'd be better off using your band as a Christmas tree decoration than trying to get any benefit out of using it in this workout. I think I'll use mine as a scarf for the winter ahead.Overall, do not be fooled by the fact that the case says it is a 5-mile workout. I don't own every single Sansone workout but this is the poorest one I own out of them all. I was honestly in disbelief at one point. It is a ""5-mile"" workout with the intensity of a 1-2 mile cool down. I can't say for certain that I will do this workout again. If you want a 5-mile that will keep your heart rate in an acceptable range, I suggestLeslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk.",1,Is This A Joke?,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,3036,"['video', 'was', 'so', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'just', 'go', 'point', 'point:1', 'Leslie', 'constantly', 'step', 'do', 'little', 'double', 'step', 'get', 'leading', 'foot', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'lost', 'count', 'one', 'point', 'totally', 'off', 'beat', 'Part', 'problem', 'so', 'much', 'supposed', 'be', 'leading', 'workout', 'video', 'focus', 'attempt', 'rearrange', 'choreography', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'poor', 'rating', 'me.2', 'music', 'barely', 'audible', 'first', 'mile', 'found', 'having', 'walk', 'fiddle', 'remote.3', 'Song', 'selection', 'was', 'poor', 'One', 'songs', 'was', 'used', '3', 'times', 'workout', 'Leslie', 'been', 'doing', 'quarter', 'century', 'mean', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'enough', 'unique', 'songs', '5-mile', 'workout', '4', 'end', '4th', 'mile', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'third', 'song', 'abruptly', 'was', 'almost', 'someone', 'bumped', 'stereo', 'caused', 'CD', 'get', 'off', 'track', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'foul', 'up', 'Leslie', 'even', 'taken', 'aback', 'can', 'tell', 'movement', 'point', 'just', 'keeps', 'exercising', 'silence.5', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'truly', '5', 'miles', 'way', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'are', 'so', 'wonky/inconsistent', 'Shortly', '4.5', 'mile', 'point', 'cool', 'down', 'then', 'stretch', 'clear', 'understanding', 'not', '5', 'miles', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'accomplished', 'counting', 'meager', 'done', 'stretch', 'total', 'mileage', 'workout.6', 'intensity', 'poor', 'due', 'part', 'fact', 'mile', 'out', 'slower', 'one', 'before', 'ended', 'other', 'words', 'pace', ""n't"", 'really', 'progressive', 'did', '5', 'miles', 'own', 'came', 'saw', 'husband', 'had', 'bought', 'popped', 'right', ""'d"", 'think', '5', 'mile', 'jog', 'doing', 'right', 'would', 'wipe', 'out', 'Nope', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'boring', 'had', 'enough', 'breath', 'doing', 'workout', 'talk', 'husband', 'how', 'might', 'be', 'time', 'Leslie', 'retire', 'obviously', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'Walk', 'Home', 'system', 'quality', 'longer', 'importance', 'was', 'more', 'extremely', 'long', 'cool', 'down', 'previous', '5', 'mile', 'jog.7', 'band', 'menu', 'are', 'two', 'bands', 'included', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'DVD', 'case', 'bought', 'mine', 'Wal-Mart', 'However', ""n't"", 'matter', 'workout', 'so', 'boring', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'using', 'band', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'decoration', 'trying', 'get', 'benefit', 'using', 'workout', 'think', ""'ll"", 'use', 'mine', 'scarf', 'winter', 'ahead.Overall', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'fact', 'case', '5-mile', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'single', 'Sansone', 'workout', 'poorest', 'one', 'own', 'out', 'was', 'honestly', 'disbelief', 'one', 'point', '5-mile', 'workout', 'intensity', '1-2', 'mile', 'cool', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'certain', 'will', 'do', 'workout', 'again', 'want', '5-mile', 'will', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'acceptable', 'range', 'suggestLeslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', '5', 'Mile', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Walk']",N/A

Otherwise, I like walking with Leslie and I enjoyed the miles and exercises.I recommendLeslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning",3,Like the Dvd except one band missing,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,587,"['like', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'enthusiasm', 'encouragement', 'did', 'close', 'two', 'miles', 'DVD', 'liked', 'band', 'arms', 'shoulders', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'workout', 'only', 'received', 'green', 'band', 'Dvd', 'Leslie', 'was', 'working', 'green', 'pink', 'band', 'same', 'time', 'separately', 'Now', 'bands', 'are', 'required', 'miles', 'exercises', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'BOTH', 'green', 'pink', 'bands', 'Dvd', 'Otherwise', 'like', 'walking', 'Leslie', 'enjoyed', 'miles', 'exercises.I', 'recommendLeslie', 'Sansone', 'Walk', 'Home', '5', 'Day', 'Slim', 'Down', 'Mile', 'Morning']",N/A
