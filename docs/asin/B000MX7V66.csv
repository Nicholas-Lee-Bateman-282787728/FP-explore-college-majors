I liked everything about it from the theme song on.  Things began to fall off a little during the third season which I am sure led to its demise.  I love having this complete series now and being able to watch it wherever and whenever I choose.  It is based on the premise that 4400 people disappeared at different times during the 20th Century and then all came back at once circa 2002-03.  It shares a theme with alien abductions that we've all heard of, but this story is different.  I have it in my collection with the Dead Zone, Lost, Supernatural, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, et.al.

With the mysterious maturation of Isabelle, the death of Lily, the impending return of a resurrected Jordan Collier, Richard joining Shawn as head of the 4400 center, Kyle arrested, more of Tom's family in trouble with NTAC, and the now villainous Dennis Ryland as head of his own secret organization, it seems like all of the characters have suddenly become major players.  Any of them could be fighting for good and any of them could be fighting for evil.  At this point, all of the ideas of pure good and pure evil have been thrown out the window in favor of a theme of choices that runs through this season, and the characters do indeed have to make some hard ones.The acting, which was admittedly pretty bad in thefirst season, continues to improve.  The entire cast is at least competent, and at times excellent.  Another improvement was the way that this season handled the long term story arc.  The episodes in thesecond seasonwere probably individually stronger, but this season excelled in executing the bigger, continuing arcs, such as the ever changing Isabelle story line, which was at once tragic and frightening.  One thing I thought was a bit off was how they handled the Nova group.  I thought they could have been great antagonists if they were more fleshed out, but instead they ended up being used as a plot device to show the true nature of Isabelle and, earlier, how Shawn has compromised the integrity of the 4400 Center.  I did, however, think amends were made when Jordan Collier (who was shown to be alive at the end of the second season) finally returned.Overall, this is a quality season of a very good show.  I hope that, by the fourth season (which is also the last, as this series was cancelled) that we will get at least a few answers, because this is quickly becoming a story that I'm investing myself in.8/10",4,Every Bit As Good As Season Two,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2004,"['third', 'season', '4400', 'twelve', 'compelling', 'episodes', 'filled', 'tension', 'drama', 'reveals', 'plot', 'twists', 'whole', 'lot', 'moral', 'greyness', 'mysterious', 'maturation', 'Isabelle', 'death', 'Lily', 'impending', 'return', 'resurrected', 'Jordan', 'Collier', 'Richard', 'joining', 'Shawn', 'head', '4400', 'center', 'Kyle', 'arrested', 'more', 'Tom', 'family', 'trouble', 'NTAC', 'now', 'villainous', 'Dennis', 'Ryland', 'head', 'own', 'secret', 'organization', 'characters', 'have', 'suddenly', 'become', 'major', 'players', 'could', 'be', 'fighting', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'fighting', 'evil', 'point', 'ideas', 'pure', 'good', 'pure', 'evil', 'have', 'been', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'favor', 'theme', 'choices', 'season', 'characters', 'do', 'indeed', 'have', 'make', 'hard', 'ones.The', 'acting', 'was', 'admittedly', 'pretty', 'bad', 'thefirst', 'season', 'improve', 'entire', 'cast', 'least', 'competent', 'times', 'excellent', 'improvement', 'was', 'way', 'season', 'handled', 'long', 'term', 'story', 'arc', 'episodes', 'thesecond', 'seasonwere', 'probably', 'individually', 'stronger', 'season', 'excelled', 'executing', 'bigger', 'continuing', 'arcs', 'such', 'ever', 'changing', 'Isabelle', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'once', 'tragic', 'frightening', 'One', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'was', 'how', 'handled', 'Nova', 'group', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'antagonists', 'were', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'instead', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'show', 'true', 'nature', 'Isabelle', 'earlier', 'how', 'Shawn', 'compromised', 'integrity', '4400', 'Center', 'did', 'however', 'think', 'amends', 'were', 'made', 'when', 'Jordan', 'Collier', 'who', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'alive', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'finally', 'returned.Overall', 'quality', 'season', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'hope', 'fourth', 'season', 'also', 'last', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'will', 'get', 'least', 'few', 'answers', 'quickly', 'becoming', 'story', ""'m"", 'investing', 'in.8/10']",The 4400: Season 3

Though most reviewers will disagree, I found this season to be the best of them all. In this season, we finally get to know why the 4400 were abducted.Though this season was great, I do have a few comments:1. The season is too short. I think they should add a few more episodes to every season.2. I loved Isabelle, but didn't like the way the writers were sexually exploiting her. There were a few unnecessary French kissing scenes that I found to be vulgar, especially in close-up. I know that many reviewers will disagree with me, but I think the kissing scenes could have been more tastefully done.3. I do get the feeling in some episodes if the writers really know where they are going. Some episodes seem to just be thrown in as fillers.4. The return of Jordan Collier was great and unexpected. He is one of the best characters in the show.I am looking forward for season 4. Will there be war between the 4400, the new 4400s, and humans?
