What can I say but this movie rocks and also that this movie has""SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE""! If you like Medieval wars it's got that if you like romance it's got that if you are interested in the Bubonic Plague and its effects on people and animals equally its got that if you like sex and nudity(ie Jennifer Jason Leigh in her birthday suit! NICE!) it's got that if you like great acting,writing,relatable characters,and believability it's got that and finally if you like stories about revenge it's got that too! All in all it's got all of that going for it plus great performances by Rutger Hauer,Jennifer Jason Leigh, and the late great Brion James(being the second great film for Rutger and Brion since Blade Runner)! Granted this is not a cheerful movie nor a kids movie either but any movie that tries to sugar-coat the Middle Ages is just lying to you anyway!  In closing I highly recommend this movie more than any of that other period piece hollywood garbage that's come out in the past 12 years!

497983,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00000F3KV,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","FLESH+BLOOD is director Paul Verhoeven's first English language film. In 1969, Verhoeven and Rutger Hauer worked together on the popular Dutch TV series ""Floris"" (1969). In it, Hauer portrayed a medieval knight. Perhaps his role of 13th Century mercenary Martin in ""Flesh+Blood"" felt familiar to the actor, for he's very good here.Another standout is the very eccentric Susan Tyrell. She's clearly having a great time as Hauer's sometime mistress, a dirt-stained woman of coarse manners and voracious appetites.SYNOPSIS--Superstitious mercenaries, who've been cheated out of plunder by Lord Hawkwood, seek wealth by following wherever an unearthed St. Martin's statue points his sword, also by kidnapping for ransom the noble's soon-to-be daughter-in-law.Unrelentingly barbaric and mindbogglingly unhygenic, this dark one-of-a-kind adventure tale set in the terrifying days of the Black Plague well illustrates with filth and squalor why few commoners back then made it to old age, and why not very many central characters survive this story.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.7) Flesh+Blood (Spain/USA/Netherlands-1985) - Rutger Hauer/Jennifer Jason Leigh/Tom Burlinson/Susan Tyrell/Bruno Kirby",4,"Hawkwood: ""Bless you Martin, your reward is in heaven."" --- Martin: ""I'd rather get paid sooner sir if you don't mind.""",1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,1237,"['FLESH+BLOOD', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', '1969', 'Verhoeven', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'worked', 'together', 'popular', 'Dutch', 'TV', 'series', 'Floris', '1969', 'Hauer', 'portrayed', 'medieval', 'knight', 'Perhaps', 'role', '13th', 'Century', 'mercenary', 'Martin', 'Flesh+Blood', 'felt', 'familiar', 'actor', 'very', 'good', 'here.Another', 'standout', 'very', 'eccentric', 'Susan', 'Tyrell', 'clearly', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'Hauer', 'sometime', 'mistress', 'dirt-stained', 'woman', 'coarse', 'manners', 'voracious', 'appetites.SYNOPSIS', 'Superstitious', 'mercenaries', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cheated', 'plunder', 'Lord', 'Hawkwood', 'seek', 'wealth', 'following', 'wherever', 'unearthed', 'St.', 'Martin', 'statue', 'sword', 'also', 'kidnapping', 'ransom', 'noble', 'soon-to-be', 'daughter-in-law.Unrelentingly', 'barbaric', 'mindbogglingly', 'unhygenic', 'dark', 'one-of-a-kind', 'adventure', 'tale', 'set', 'terrifying', 'days', 'Black', 'Plague', 'well', 'filth', 'squalor', 'why', 'few', 'commoners', 'back', 'then', 'made', 'old', 'age', 'why', 'not', 'very', 'many', 'central', 'characters', 'survive', 'story.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'IMDb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.7', 'Flesh+Blood', 'Spain/USA/Netherlands-1985', 'Rutger', 'Hauer/Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh/Tom', 'Burlinson/Susan', 'Tyrell/Bruno', 'Kirby']",N/A
497984,A38N4MOCLSOKOH,B00000F3KV,Armando A. Gomez,"[1, 7]","At this point of time, much is said, and written, about FLESH+BLOOD.  It is considered one of the most ""raw, refreshing and un-Hollywood movie"" you'll  ever see.  But that is not quite true, about the ""un-Hollywood"" part; when it comes to gratuitous sex and violence, in this case, the rape scene, this movie is ""most"" Hollywood.  But I would agreed with some of the reviewers when they say FLESH+BLOOD is unconventional with Hollywood's perception of the Middle Age genre, say with The Lion In Winter, Beckett and even A Man For All Season.  This is true.  It's just as gory and raw, say, Prince Valiant, The Vikings, or Charlton Heston's the War Lord or El Cid, but FLESH+BLOOD has none of the aforementioned's charm or scope.  What this film has going for it are gimmicks, which are tacked together by Hollywood hacks.  Perhaps, the only ""attractive"" gimmick in the film is Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Aside from her occasional nudity, (when the film's gimmicks become apparently tiresome) Ms. Leigh's acting ability shone through on such a bleak movie.  I began to notice, of late, that Medieval films, as well as other genre, such as westerns, have been relegated in the bottom shelves of armpits.  The more it is graphic, cruddy or putrid, the more it's acceptable  and, what's worse, they use ""historical acuity"" to justify it.  Well, I don't find such excuses acceptable and either should the general public.Note: During the ""rape"" of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, there was a boy, about the age of, say, thirteen, on the scene, witnessing the whole event--and that of Ms. Leigh's complete frontal nudity.

497992,A1IWA90FHZZO3V,B00000F3KV,Dale Smith,"[4, 8]","This is my review of Flash & Blood, or was $6 million will buy you in 1985.  Flesh and Blood stars Rutger Hauer, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  The movie is billed as a realistic adventure story (what the Middle Ages were really like.)  And the movie is that.The movie is basically a gritty love triangle between Martin (played by Rutger Hauer) and Agnes (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Stephen , the son of a nobleman who has wronged Martin.The story is filled with violence, blood, and the graphic rape scene of Agnes.  I say graphic, because this is the director's cut of Flesh and Blood even though the packaging does not say so.  This is one of the first DVD's that I have seen of an older movie (1985) that actually add scenes, and does not take them out.  Usually, there is a difference between the original VHS, and the DVD.  However, in this case, we get the European version of the movie.Now, I don't consider 1501, the Middle Ages.  I consider 1501, early Renaissance period.  However, I will not quibble with such a fine movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I believe that you will too.  If you are over 18, and you enjoy action movies.It also helps if you are a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh as an actress.  Because in this movie, you see a lot of her, and I'm not just talking about acting.This movie was filmed outside the walls of Avila Spain, the city is Casares, Spain.

This is one Paul Verhoven movie that fails miserably on all fronts, and if you've read the story summary on a site like Wikipedia, then you should already grasp the ugliness of the plot. Now imagine THAT with horrid, and I mean HORRID execution.Rape is treated like something unwanted but ok once it starts. Do not expect our female lead to even react to it afterwards - in fact, she starts a relationship with her rapist.As I've indicated, the movie abandons sense and realism.

497994,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00000F3KV,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[6, 6]","You need a strong fortitude to make it through this movie on medieval warfare starring a still largely unknown Rutger Hauer (the cult favorite BLADE RUNNER at that time was still considered a failure in 1985) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (whatever happened to her). It's an entertaining movie if highly exploitative, that portrays the gruesome days of hand-to-hand swordmanship with the requisite amount of gore and bloodletting in addition to shots of severed limbs and people suffering from the bubonic plague.The story centers on charismatic mercenary Martin and his followers (including WHEN HARRY MET SALLY's Bruno Kirby). After being promised the spoils of a castle if they help a King capture it they are betrayed by said ruler and banished from the land. Understandably a little miffed its not long before Martin is heading back to seek his revenge on the ruler and attain the riches which he feels his band was cheated of.So Martin and friends ambush the king's carriage that is escorting the rulers son's bride Agnes (played by Leigh) back for a royal wedding.  Leigh is one of Hollywood's most appealing actresses and here she is in one of her first roles really throwing caution to the wind, in addition to most of her clothes. It's not surprising that Hauer's character falls for her and intends to keep her for himself.The son Steven (played excellently by Tom Burlinson) is an inventor of sorts and a lot of the needed humor (needed to lighten an otherwise dark and foreboding picture) comes from his sheer ingenuity and the dogged manner in which he continues his crusade to save Agnes.Really one should know what to expect from a Paul Verhoeven directed movie. This was the same man who gave us the violent ROBOCOP, the twisted sexual thriller BASIC INSTINCT and the exploitative SHOWGIRLS. This movie is full of sex, nudity, gore and rape (perhaps the most disturbing one put to film since Susan George's scene in STRAW DOGS).That's not to say this movie isn't entertaining. I had not planned to watch it all the way through in one sitting but 10 minutes in and I cpuld not turn my eyes away from the screen, it's a well crafted story that is both fascinating and yet repulsive in the same breath.Recommended",4,Fascinating depiction of medieval warfare,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,2222,"['need', 'strong', 'fortitude', 'make', 'movie', 'medieval', 'warfare', 'starring', 'still', 'largely', 'unknown', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'cult', 'favorite', 'BLADE', 'RUNNER', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'considered', 'failure', '1985', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'happened', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'highly', 'exploitative', 'gruesome', 'days', 'hand-to-hand', 'swordmanship', 'requisite', 'amount', 'gore', 'bloodletting', 'addition', 'shots', 'severed', 'limbs', 'people', 'suffering', 'bubonic', 'plague.The', 'story', 'centers', 'charismatic', 'mercenary', 'Martin', 'followers', 'including', 'WHEN', 'HARRY', 'MET', 'SALLY', 'Bruno', 'Kirby', 'being', 'promised', 'spoils', 'castle', 'help', 'King', 'capture', 'are', 'betrayed', 'said', 'ruler', 'banished', 'land', 'Understandably', 'little', 'miffed', 'not', 'long', 'Martin', 'heading', 'back', 'seek', 'revenge', 'ruler', 'attain', 'riches', 'band', 'was', 'cheated', 'of.So', 'Martin', 'friends', 'ambush', 'king', 'carriage', 'escorting', 'rulers', 'son', 'bride', 'Agnes', 'played', 'Leigh', 'back', 'royal', 'wedding', 'Leigh', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'appealing', 'actresses', 'here', 'one', 'first', 'roles', 'really', 'throwing', 'caution', 'wind', 'addition', 'most', 'clothes', 'not', 'surprising', 'Hauer', 'character', 'keep', 'himself.The', 'son', 'Steven', 'played', 'excellently', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'inventor', 'sorts', 'lot', 'needed', 'humor', 'needed', 'lighten', 'otherwise', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'picture', 'sheer', 'ingenuity', 'dogged', 'manner', 'crusade', 'save', 'Agnes.Really', 'one', 'should', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'directed', 'movie', 'was', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'violent', 'ROBOCOP', 'twisted', 'sexual', 'thriller', 'BASIC', 'INSTINCT', 'exploitative', 'SHOWGIRLS', 'movie', 'full', 'sex', 'nudity', 'gore', 'rape', 'perhaps', 'most', 'disturbing', 'one', 'put', 'film', 'Susan', 'George', 'scene', 'STRAW', 'DOGS', '.That', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'had', 'not', 'planned', 'watch', 'way', 'one', 'sitting', '10', 'minutes', 'cpuld', 'not', 'turn', 'eyes', 'away', 'screen', 'well', 'crafted', 'story', 'fascinating', 'yet', 'repulsive', 'same', 'breath.Recommended']",N/A
497995,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00000F3KV,David A. Wend,"[3, 3]","Flesh & Blood is set in 1510, ironically at the height of the Renaissance in Italy.  What Paul Verhoeven offers instead is the brutal side of civilization: an army (that includes several mercenaries) assaults a city for a nobleman who had previously been expelled.  In order to inspire his troops, the noblemen offers them all they booty they can take but when the city has been taken he goes back on his promise and not only has the mercenaries expelled from his domain but robs them of their considerable booty.The band of mercenaries is led by Martin (Rutger Hauer) and is a motley group that includes Brion James (who had been paired with Mr. Hauer as a replicant in Blade Runner a few years earlier).  The mercenaries, who are comically led by a statue of St. Martin (who will is interpreted by a priest), decide to recover their wealth by robbing the first caravan they encounter, which happens to include the future bride (Agnes) of the nobleman's son (Steven),  played by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Burlinson.  Steven is the only truly noble person; he has been well-educated and has progressive views but his thoughts are wasted on the rabble that surrounds him.  Agnes has never been near a man and is shy and somewhat frightened by the idea of sex; she even has her maid seduce a guard so she can observe how things are done.Agnes is claimed by Martin as his woman and she become not so much a kidnapped woman but a camp follower of the mercenaries: even if she had a chance to escape she would not take it.  Gradually, she falls in love with Martin but when Steven attacks the castle the mercenaries have taken as their own, she has to choose between Martin and Steven.Flesh & Blood attempts to show the cold-blooded life of a band of mercenaries and does succeed in providing a picture of how dirty and brutal life was for the average peasant of the times. The fighting scenes are bloody, and one should remember that Mr. Hauer is an expert with a sword. Soldiers being soldiers there are two rape scenes that will be rather intense for most viewers. There are also scenes that include frontal nudity and a nasty death for Brion James when he is skewered by three spears. The indecision of Agnes is the one of the most memorable parts of the film: does she want the noble Steven or the perfect warrior Martin. The film is not rated but is intended for mature audiences.  All of the cast members turn in strong performances and the photography by Jan De Bont is very good.  An interesting film that has its moments but not a great film, and, it should be added, one that Mr. Hauer does not talk about in his recent autobiography.",4,"Flesh & Blood, Sex & War",1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,2643,"['Flesh', 'Blood', 'set', '1510', 'ironically', 'height', 'Renaissance', 'Italy', 'What', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'offers', 'instead', 'brutal', 'side', 'civilization', 'army', 'several', 'mercenaries', 'assaults', 'city', 'nobleman', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'expelled', 'order', 'inspire', 'troops', 'noblemen', 'booty', 'can', 'take', 'when', 'city', 'been', 'taken', 'back', 'promise', 'not', 'only', 'mercenaries', 'expelled', 'domain', 'robs', 'considerable', 'booty.The', 'band', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Martin', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'motley', 'group', 'Brion', 'James', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'paired', 'Mr.', 'Hauer', 'replicant', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'are', 'comically', 'led', 'statue', 'St.', 'Martin', 'who', 'will', 'interpreted', 'priest', 'decide', 'recover', 'wealth', 'robbing', 'first', 'caravan', 'encounter', 'include', 'future', 'bride', 'Agnes', 'nobleman', 'son', 'Steven', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', 'Steven', 'only', 'truly', 'noble', 'person', 'been', 'well-educated', 'progressive', 'views', 'thoughts', 'are', 'wasted', 'rabble', 'Agnes', 'never', 'been', 'man', 'shy', 'somewhat', 'frightened', 'idea', 'sex', 'even', 'maid', 'seduce', 'guard', 'can', 'observe', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done.Agnes', 'claimed', 'Martin', 'woman', 'become', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'kidnapped', 'woman', 'camp', 'follower', 'mercenaries', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'escape', 'would', 'not', 'take', 'Gradually', 'love', 'Martin', 'when', 'Steven', 'castle', 'mercenaries', 'have', 'taken', 'own', 'choose', 'Martin', 'Steven.Flesh', 'Blood', 'attempts', 'show', 'cold-blooded', 'life', 'band', 'mercenaries', 'succeed', 'providing', 'picture', 'how', 'dirty', 'brutal', 'life', 'was', 'average', 'peasant', 'times', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'bloody', 'one', 'should', 'remember', 'Mr.', 'Hauer', 'expert', 'sword', 'Soldiers', 'being', 'soldiers', 'are', 'two', 'rape', 'scenes', 'will', 'be', 'rather', 'intense', 'most', 'viewers', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'include', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'nasty', 'death', 'Brion', 'James', 'when', 'skewered', 'three', 'spears', 'indecision', 'Agnes', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'parts', 'film', 'want', 'noble', 'Steven', 'perfect', 'warrior', 'Martin', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'intended', 'mature', 'audiences', 'cast', 'members', 'turn', 'strong', 'performances', 'photography', 'Jan', 'De', 'Bont', 'very', 'good', 'interesting', 'film', 'moments', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Hauer', 'not', 'talk', 'recent', 'autobiography']",N/A

The budget is very, VERY raw.  That said, it (unfortunately) gives a pretty accurate depiction of life in the middle ages.Of course, any movie with Rutger Haur gets some bonus points right off the bat.  Although he probably doesn't recall this movie with fondness, he likely gets a good chuckle out of it.  Paul Verhoeven has gone on to direct many other films, some better, some worse, most better known and virtually all of them bigger budget.  The lovely Jennifer Jason Leigh stars in the flick as well, and one of the biggest selling points is seeing her frolick around naked through most of the film.  Had it not been for this aspect, the DVD would have received zero stars!As for the story itself, it does detail a great many motifs that would have been familiar to our ancestors who were unlucky enough to live at the end of the middle ages.  Factors such as constant & unending wars, plague and betrayals all played a great role in their lives.Most all of the negative factors of this epoch are portrayed thoughtfully in this film, although in a few places people who contracted the plague died almost immediately (am pretty sure that didn't happen).  For the most part, however, the stuff is true.When the movie opens the date & time is announced as Europe in 1501.  I have been wondering:  why 1501?  Was there something special about this date?  If so, I missed its significance in the storyline.  It could be that the writer just picked a date out of his head, but then why not just say that the film takes place in the middle ages?In any event, this movie is not for the feint of heart.  Much of it is grotesque and it is far from a polished, high-budget film depicting this time period.  [For movies that are polished, I would recommend EXCALIBUR, FIRST KNIGHT and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN].

It's dark and violent, especially how women are treated.Paul Verhoeven's direction brings Gerald Soeteman's screenplay to life and its Spanish locales are amazing.  A group of mercenaries help to regain a city for an exile noble with promises of wealth only to betrayed and vanished from the city they had recaptured.Rutger Hauer leads the rough band.  He plays Martin, named for St Martin. He's a warrior pure and simple with some aspirations for something better.  His men just want wine, women and gold.There is a cardinal who has joined himself to the motley band.  He finds a statue of St Martin which he becomes convinced will guide them to the promise land with a little help from Martin.Unfortunately, Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Agnes, a princess on her way to an arranged marriage to Prince Steven.  She's captured by Martin and his men.  She's abused and raped.  This is a very violent, gratuitous scene in this film.Another violent scene is the attack on the castle by Martin and his men.  The slaughter is brutal.  There is a poetic justice twist which falls on Martin's men.Prince Steven mounts a rescue effort.  He's more of a scholar, scientist than a warrior.  He leaves the warrior responsibilities to Captain Hawkwood, a seasoned warrior who has seen many campaigns.This film is unrated.  Don't let its age (released in 1985) fool you-it's dark, violent and bloody.  Its brutal treatment of women deserves no stars. Women are treated like property to be used and discarded.

498007,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B00000F3KV,Genevieve Hayes,"[6, 6]","In Western Europe in 1501, a noble betrays the mercenaries he hired to help him seize a castle. This leads to the mercenaries, led by Rutger Hauer, seeking revenge on the noble by killing his men and kidnapping the woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) betrothed to his son (Tom Burlinson).Probably due to the fact that this film is a Spanish/American/Dutch co-production, ""Flesh + Blood"" is not your typical Hollywood version of history, it's more the unwashed, disease-ridden version, where even the supposed heroes of the film aren't entirely good. ""Flesh + Blood"" was director Paul Verhoeven's first American movie, and as with his later movies (such as ""Robocop"", ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Basic Instinct""), this film is filled with graphic sex, brutal violence and gratuitous nudity. Unlike these other films, however, which fit more closely to the Hollywood ""violence is fun"" mould, this film portrays these elements in a far more realistic and disturbing manner. In fact, the whole film seems to be trying to be realistic (give or take an anachronism or two), right down to the inclusion of the black plague into the storyline and the acknowledgement of what happens to young women who are kidnapped by mercenaries. For this reason, I hesitate to describe ""Flesh + Blood"" as an enjoyable film (I can imagine many people turning this film off within the first half-hour). Nevertheless, ""Flesh + Blood"" is a compelling film that is very different from any film that I have ever seen (the heroes of this film are a far cry from Errol Flynn in tights), and as a result, kept me watching, even through the more difficult scenes. What fascinated me the most was wondering who would actually ""win"" at the end of the day: the nobles, the mercenaries or the plague. Given that both the nobles and the mercenaries were capable of evil, it seemed that the film could go either way.",5,Not your typical Hollywood version of history,1224633600,"10 22, 2008",2008,1868,"['Western', 'Europe', '1501', 'noble', 'mercenaries', 'hired', 'help', 'seize', 'castle', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'noble', 'killing', 'men', 'kidnapping', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'betrothed', 'son', 'Tom', 'Burlinson', '.Probably', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'Spanish/American/Dutch', 'co-production', 'Flesh', '+', 'Blood', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'history', 'more', 'unwashed', 'disease-ridden', 'version', 'where', 'even', 'supposed', 'heroes', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'good', 'Flesh', '+', 'Blood', 'was', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'first', 'American', 'movie', 'later', 'movies', 'such', 'Robocop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'film', 'filled', 'graphic', 'sex', 'brutal', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'other', 'films', 'however', 'fit', 'more', 'closely', 'Hollywood', 'violence', 'fun', 'mould', 'film', 'elements', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'disturbing', 'manner', 'fact', 'whole', 'film', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'realistic', 'give', 'take', 'anachronism', 'two', 'right', 'down', 'inclusion', 'black', 'plague', 'storyline', 'acknowledgement', 'what', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'mercenaries', 'reason', 'hesitate', 'describe', 'Flesh', '+', 'Blood', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'can', 'imagine', 'many', 'people', 'turning', 'film', 'first', 'half-hour', 'Nevertheless', 'Flesh', '+', 'Blood', 'compelling', 'film', 'very', 'different', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'heroes', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'cry', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'tights', 'result', 'kept', 'watching', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'What', 'fascinated', 'most', 'was', 'wondering', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'win', 'end', 'day', 'nobles', 'mercenaries', 'plague', 'Given', 'nobles', 'mercenaries', 'were', 'capable', 'evil', 'seemed', 'film', 'could', 'go', 'way']",N/A

498011,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00000F3KV,Jeffrey Leach,"[71, 83]","As a longtime Rutger Hauer fan, I knew I would get around to watching Paul Verhoeven's medieval epic ""Flesh + Blood"" sooner or later. Thanks to DVD, it's sooner. True Hauer fans appreciate seeing him in anything, which is saying a lot considering the immense number of low budget schlock films he starred in over the last couple of decades. No matter how many times he plays a cranky cop embittered with the march of technology, or a fugitive on the run from justice, we diehards always refuse to change the channel. One reason I appreciate Hauer is that his performance is never anything less than wonderful even in the worst of films. Take a film like ""Arctic Blue,"" for example. It plods with the speed of a snail caught in molasses, looks like the filmmakers used a chainsaw as an editing tool, and boasts a script riddled with cliches. O.k., it isn't that bad, but you get the idea. The only good thing in the entire film is this actor. That's the only reason to watch the film entitled ""Arctic Blue."" That's the power of Rutger Hauer--with a wave of his hand or a scowl on his face, he can turn a terrible film into something bearable. It's a gift few possess.""Flesh + Blood"" isn't a terrible film. It isn't, I hate to say, a great one either. Verhoeven's film begins by introducing us to a motley band of mercenaries waging war in the employ of a powerful nobleman. This wealthy figure promises the group, led by the charismatic Martin (Rutger Hauer), that he will allow them to loot the city as a reward for defeating the enemy. Sounds like a good idea, right? Lots of pillage and plunder always does a man's heart good. Martin--with Orbec (Bruno Kirby), Karsthans (Brion James), and several other ruffians--sets out to win the war. With the dubious help of the nobleman's inventor son Steven (Tom Burlinson), the fortified city falls in record time. But as Martin and the others attempt to reap their spoils, the nobleman changes his mind and uses his own soldiers to force the mercenaries out of town with nary a coin in their pockets. Although Steven expresses disbelief and disgust that his father would renege on the agreement, other issues soon arise that put the double cross far from his mind. The father arranges a marriage for his son with the beautiful Agnes (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the daughter of another wealthy aristocrat. If at this point you predict that Agnes, Steven, Martin and his band, and the father will have it out in the future, you would be right.Martin and his band wander through the countryside until they find a statue of a saint buried in the mud. Never one to miss an opportunity to use religion for his own bloodthirsty purposes, Martin convinces the rest of the group that the icon possesses great power to foretell the gang's future. Anytime a compatriot expresses reservations about a proposed action, Martin points to the saint and claims divine sanction for his position as leader. Apparently, the saint approves of the abduction of Agnes and her subsequent defilement because that is exactly what happens. Agnes and Martin end up hitting it off, so much so that she becomes an unofficial member of the mercenary brigade. Steven, unaware that his beloved is in cahoots with a bunch of cutthroats, heads out with his myriad inventions and a force of men to reclaim the young noblewoman. The final segments of ""Flesh + Blood"" are as ridiculous as they are entertaining, with Steven building a contraption out of wood that can mechanically extend wooden ladders over high walls in order to gain entrance to the fortress where Martin and Agnes are hiding. There is also a rather grotesque scene in which some of Steven's men lob parts of a plague infected dog over the walls of the castle. As we all know, any film about the Middle Ages must involve the plague.Where to start with this film? I don't know what Verhoeven was thinking when he came up with this offbeat ""historical"" epic. Should I mention the nun with the head wound who frequently lapses into seizures and gibberish? Or how Steven breaks his chains by channeling lightening? Perhaps I'll mention Agnes's and Steven's most romantic moment, a truly bizarre scene involving professions of love, mandrake roots, and a rotting body hanging from a tree. Of course, nothing stands out more in my mind than the mercenaries traveling around in covered wagons. You'd think they were about to head to Oregon or something. I'm probably being more sarcastic than I intended since I did enjoy the film; it's got plenty of bloody violence to spare, quite explicit situations involving Agnes and Martin, and a truly stirring musical score. ""Flesh + Blood"" also has an eyeful of Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actress of such talent and charisma that I could spend hours watching her doing laundry while clad in a T-shirt, sweat pants, and flip flops without getting bored. I guess my main problem with the film is that I expected it, for some inexplicable reason, to explore some deep themes. It doesn't. The film is nothing more than an action packed yarn and should be enjoyed as such.""Flesh + Blood"" has quite a reputation with fans who enjoy these types of things. They will probably enjoy the DVD release, which contains a commentary with Paul Verhoeven, a trailer, and a short featurette about creating the music for the film entitled ""Composing Flesh + Blood."" Verhoeven's little adventure tale is as accurate in its details of sixteenth century Europe as an undergraduate history report, but it is a lot of fun if you just empty your mind and accept it as two hours of pure entertainment.",4,Historically accurate?

A time when the ignorant and hopeless would cleave to anything they thought might better their lives. I especially liked Rutger Hauer's use of the fluked Great sword at the movies beginning. Taking the heads off of pikes and horsemen was this weapons primary function & Hauer also shows a bit of the half swording technique rarely seen in movies. I had braced myself for the brutal rape scene mentioned in other reviews but after sitting through &#34;Deliverance&#34; & &#34;I spit on your grave&#34; the scene paled by comparison and was typical of the time frame the movie was set.

498022,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00000F3KV,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[0, 0]","Flesh and Blood stars Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a fairly ruthless movie set in the Italian middle ages. This isn't a tender romance. It's about brutal rape, the plague, and what people do to survive. Note that this review containers spoilers.Flesh and Blood Rutger is a mercenary who leads a rag-tag band of fighters and whores. They're betrayed by the nobles who hire them, and in revenge they ambush the nobles' caravan. The mercenaries manage to accidentally capture the intended bride of one of the nobles. Rutger rapes her but then protects her from the others. She turns to him as a protector. When her intended husband - who she had only met for five minutes - comes after her to save her, she has to make a choice.In terms of the medieval setting, they do a reasonable job with this. Basil Poledouris's score gives that Conan / rough feel to it. They don't sugar-coat life in the middle of a siege. It was nasty. The triumphant troops merrily rape women. There's no remorse. A captured woman is seen as fair game for gang rape. It's simply what they're there for - and the women of the group join in on it. They don't think about saving the damsel in distress. The landscape is gritty. The clothes look well used. Rutger carries a Zweih&auml;nder - a German long sword - which was a favored weapon of mercenaries. Sure, sometimes the outfits look more like &#34;costumes&#34; rather than &#34;clothing&#34;, especially later in the movie, but that's all right. This wasn't meant to be a historical treatise along the lines of Name of the Rose. It's more an examination of what people will do to survive. It also examines how the middle ages was a time of signs and portents, and life was tenuous at best.Interestingly, while I watch vast numbers of movies with my partner of 18 years, this is one of the few that we disagree about. I've seen similar disagreements in other reviews I've read of this movie. I've seen this movie many times over the years, so my thoughts aren't a first reaction. They've had a lot of pondering.I look at Jennifer's character as doing what had to be done to stay alive. First she's foisted off on Steven, the nobleman's son, and he actively doesn't want her. She has to lure him in with mandrake, to convince him that she's what he wants in a wife. They only talk for maybe five minutes before she's abducted by Rutger. His first act is to rape her in front of his gang, and then turn her over to the others for their turn. She pleads with Rutger to let her be only his. It's not that she wants to be raped by him more, of course - it's that she doesn't want to be also raped by the others. And he gives in to her plea - he sets a fire so that the others are distracted. As the movie progresses he continually steps in to keep her safe from the others.So we get to a point where Steven makes it into the castle where the mercenaries are holed up. At this point Jennifer is solidly &#34;Rutger's&#34; and this is keeping her safe from the others. Steven is captured and Jennifer stays on the mercenaries' side, not helping Steven. Then she sees Steven throw plague-infested dog meat into the communal well and Steven explicitly tells her she has to make a choice. When the others start drinking from that water, she lets them drink, one by one - but when it gets to Rutger drinking, she knocks the cup out of his hand. She isn't willing to actively kill the man who, in his own way, saved her.The nobles' troops attack, there's fighting, and Rutger tries to kill her rather than let Steven have her. Steven comes in just in time and saves her. She goes off with Steven - but when she sees Rutger is escaping, she doesn't tell Steven. She lets him escape to live another day.Flesh and Blood My boyfriend feels she should have been more actively against the mercenaries. She should have let Rutger drink the tainted water. She should have pointed out when he was escaping, so that he could be hunted down and killed. He feels she was the &#34;bad character&#34; for using whoever was near her. I see this same response from many male reviewers.I have to wonder if this comes from being personally hurt in the past by a woman who did the same thing - seem to be fond of them, but then be fond of others when she was with them.In comparison, maybe being female is part of it, I tend to look at this from her point of view. She was being rejected by her future husband so she did her best to be friends with him. Then she's about to be gang raped so she does her best to align with the guy who can prevent that. She's in a dangerous situation so she stays by his side. It would have been incredibly could-be-fatal risky to do otherwise.And in terms of Rutger, he was a mercenary. Rape was a normal part of life. He wasn't doing anything &#34;bad&#34; in terms of the culture of the times. Rape was a normal part of the spoils of war. When they capture Jennifer, the thought of rape came naturally. It's just what they did. If anything, he was being odd / &#34;overly&#34; moral by then preventing the others from taking their turn. He was rising above what was normal for his entire community. In terms of what he was &#34;due&#34;, he was the one who had been betrayed by the nobles. He'd lost his son to miscarriage as a result. He strove to protect his band and keep them safe. I think letting him go was a reasonable thing.I suppose he did try to strangle Jennifer :). That falls into the romantic heat-of-passion over-the-top movie category, and while I wouldn't want Jennifer to end up with him as a result, I suppose I also don't see it as an offence for which he should then be stabbed in the back.It's interesting to me where I draw this line. In romance novels I speak out vociferously when heroines are raped and mistreated and then fall in love with the guy as her &#34;happily ever after&#34;. So I wouldn't want Jennifer to end up with Rutger. But I also don't think he should be drawn and quartered for what he did. He wasn't sadistically evil. He was a normal, if brutish, mercenary. So not someone I would want a heroine to end up with - but not someone to be brutalized either.There's interesting dialogue about Rutger being an older, experienced version of Steven (age 29 but playing a younger man), and Steven being a younger, idealistic version of Rutger (age 41). Steven is what Rutger might have been fifteen years ago, with hopes and dreams. Rutger is what Steven might have turned into after having endured the horrors of war and the rough betrayals of life. He's the experienced, capable, can-handle-it version. Jennifer's drawn to both. She was actually 23, but I imagine she was playing an 18 or so year old.At the same time, there's the behavior of Rutger toward woman. At the beginning of the story it's clear he's made the mercenary whore, Celine, pregnant, but he dismisses responsibility for the kid. Another man in the group, Karsthans (who interestingly also played Rutger's loyal companion in Blade Runner) actively offers to be with Celine and be the child's father, but she only wants Rutger. And Rutger does show remorse when, after the betrayal and driving-out, she has a stillborn son. He accepts that it was his child. But then - *poof* - the moment the pretty Jennifer comes along, he tosses Celine aside. He'd much rather have the young, pretty woman in his life. He doesn't even have a twinge of a thought about the woman who bore his child.So I suppose I don't see either male character as ideal for her. Steven blows up a man by accident at the beginning of the movie and they just laugh. They don't fault him. These things happen. He's dismissive of Jennifer and has to get drawn into caring for her. Her rescue is just as much revenge for what the mercenaries did to his father as an actual caring about her personally. And Rutger is doing what mercenaries do. They rape women and rob households. He cares for his troops, and he actually does care for Jennifer. He protects her. But in his mentality, there's a thin line between owning something and making sure others can't have it. If she can't be his, it makes sense to him to ensure she can't be someone else's. Just like their priest off-handedly killed a team member for a disparaging comment, and few blinked an eye. It's the way the mercenary code worked.So for her to try to stay aligned with whoever had the best chance of helping her to live made sense to me. She wasn't killing people. It was hard for her to let the mercenaries drink the tainted water, and in the end she couldn't let Rutger do it. She couldn't actively raise a call to take down Rutger when he was escaping - but if others had noticed him fleeing, I don't think she would have interfered with them capturing / killing him, either.I'll comment as an ending note that it's intriguing and nice (to me) that they have a homosexual couple in the movie and it's just taken as a normal thing. The mercenaries don't mind or comment on it. It's not made to be a big deal. The two men are simply together, and when one is killed, the other commits suicide to be with him. I like that it's simply part of the story.In any case, well worth watching as a brutal view of the middle ages, how women in this situation were treated / mistreated, and how characters deal with betrayals and forced relationships.",4,A rare gritty look into this time period,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",2014,9320,"['Flesh', 'Blood', 'stars', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh',

It didn't used to be. But I've watched it, oh, three, maybe four times since it came out, and each time it is just as enjoyable. This one ages well, and it is an old film by now (which rather shocks me).It isn't rated, being a foreign-made film (and probably somewhat extreme in the ""flesh"" department even by modern rating standards -- between F&B; and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Jennifer doesn't hide anything). But then I hate the film rating ""system"" anyway.F&B; has good period eye candy everywhere. It's supposed to be ""1501 AD"" and I can't really fault anything visual about how Verhoeven pulled off directing his own screen play. Supposedly the ""parrot"" cannons used early in the story to threaten the mercenaries into surrendering are American Civil War pieces (so says someone on IMDb, anyway), but you could fool me with artillery some of the time: I am more into arms and armor, and in that area F&B; is good at keeping within the period.Someone refers to The Black Death, The Plague, as ""Bubonic plague"" and that is surely anachronistic. Meh, so what.The characters/cast are superb. Ronald Lacey's supporting character role as the Cardinal is psychotic to the extreme, ""laced"" with religious fanaticism. Great fun!Hauer's Martin is amoral, yet in his world understandably so. Agnes, who succumbs majorly to ""Stockholm Syndrome"" after being abducted and raped, awakens his latent appreciation of the finer things enjoyed by the upper classes. And her emotional dichotomy between Martin and Steven creates Martin into a jealous rival: which aspect of the story is left hanging as we see Martin set out after his new-found infatuation, Agnes, who has been rejoined with her betrothed, Steven, after much shedding of blood. The continuing story is left up to the viewer and was never ruined by a sequel (a rare event it seems anymore these days).The rest of the supporting cast are equally interesting mixes of good and bad with no clear-cut bad guys at all on either side. Everyone is just trying to get what they can and keep it for as long as they can. F&B; makes me glad I live when and where I do! And I don't think the violence and grime and chaos is over-done: at times whole swathes of Europe were backwaters of the larger wars and left to their own devices in pretty much the atmosphere of decay that F&B; brilliantly evokes.Add in an excellent musical score by the under-employed Basil Poledouris, and you have a potent mix.This film would by my first pick for creating a cult classic....",4,Very much flesh and liberal blood,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2825,"['Whenever', 'am', 'mood', 'nice', 'dose', 'delightful', 'skin', 'sauced', 'violence', 'late', 'medieval', 'world', 'views', 'scene', 'Agnes', 'Steven', 'kissing', 'putrescent', 'hanged', 'men', 'just', 'too', 'weirdly', 'casual', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'fetch', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'sit', 'back', 'relax.Is', 'film', 'favorite', 'did', ""n't"", 'used', 'be', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'oh', 'three', 'maybe', 'four', 'times', 'came', 'out', 'time', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'well', 'old', 'film', 'now', 'rather', '.It', ""n't"", 'rated', 'being', 'foreign-made', 'film', 'probably', 'somewhat', 'extreme', 'flesh', 'department', 'even', 'modern', 'rating', 'standards', 'F', 'B', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Jennifer', ""n't"", 'hide', 'anything', 'then', 'hate', 'film', 'rating', 'system', 'anyway.F', 'B', 'good', 'period', 'eye', 'candy', 'everywhere', 'supposed', 'be', '1501', 'AD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'anything', 'visual', 'how', 'Verhoeven', 'pulled', 'off', 'directing', 'own', 'screen', 'play', 'Supposedly', 'parrot', 'cannons', 'used', 'early', 'story', 'threaten', 'mercenaries', 'surrendering', 'are', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'pieces', 'so', 'someone', 'IMDb', 'anyway', 'could', 'fool', 'time', 'am', 'more', 'arms', 'armor', 'area', 'F', 'B', 'good', 'keeping', 'period.Someone', 'refers', 'Black', 'Death', 'Plague', 'Bubonic', 'plague', 'surely', 'anachronistic', 'Meh', 'what.The', 'characters/cast', 'are', 'superb', 'Ronald', 'Lacey', 'supporting', 'character', 'role', 'Cardinal', 'psychotic', 'extreme', 'laced', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'Great', 'fun', 'Hauer', 'Martin', 'amoral', 'yet', 'world', 'understandably', 'so', 'Agnes', 'who', 'succumbs', 'majorly', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'being', 'abducted', 'raped', 'latent', 'appreciation', 'finer', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'upper', 'classes', 'emotional', 'dichotomy', 'Martin', 'Steven', 'Martin', 'jealous', 'rival', 'aspect', 'story', 'left', 'hanging', 'see', 'Martin', 'set', 'out', 'new-found', 'infatuation', 'Agnes', 'who', 'been', 'rejoined', 'betrothed', 'Steven', 'much', 'shedding', 'blood', 'continuing', 'story', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'was', 'never', 'ruined', 'sequel', 'rare', 'event', 'days', '.The', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'equally', 'interesting', 'mixes', 'good', 'bad', 'clear-cut', 'bad', 'guys', 'side', 'Everyone', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'what', 'can', 'keep', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'F', 'B', 'glad', 'live', 'when', 'where', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'violence', 'grime', 'chaos', 'over-done', 'times', 'whole', 'swathes', 'Europe', 'were', 'backwaters', 'larger', 'wars', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'pretty', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'decay', 'F', 'B', 'brilliantly', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'under-employed', 'Basil', 'Poledouris', 'have', 'potent', 'mix.This', 'film', 'would', 'first', 'pick', 'creating', 'cult', 'classic']",N/A

Next thing you know, Martin is kidnapping the bride to be (the gorgeous Jennifer Jason Leigh) of the King's cunning son (Tom Burlinson), and what follows are a series of battles, chases, betrayals, and some great action as well.  What makes Flesh + Blood so good are the performances from everyone involved, particularly Hauer and the young Leigh; both of whom are just plain brilliant here.  The only real drawbacks of Flesh + Blood are the much lauded graphic rape sequences, but Verhoeven was attempting to make a film that reflected the violent times of the era, and Flesh + Blood certainly does just that.

How is it that you make such crappy movies, and yet somehow, they work? Take this pile of rags, for example. We have a band of mercenaries who have been hired by Hawkwood (Jack Thompson, recently of Attack of the Clones) to retake a town that's been seized by the enemies of its owner, Arnolfini (Fernando Hilbeck). Arnolfini promises the mercenaries the world, but after they retake the town, he strips them of their weapons and loot and kicks them out, much to the disgust and dismay of his son, Stephen (Return to Snowy River's Tom Burlinson). The unofficial leader of the mercenaries, Martin (Rutger Hauer), vows revenge. He gets it rather quickly, when Arnolfini arranges a faux hunting party to introduce Stephen to his future wife Agnes (Jennifer Jason Leigh). The mercenaries happen upon the party, there is a great battle, and they make off with wagons, gold, and various finery-- including Agnes. Stephen, despite his seeming sympathy towards the plight of the mercenaries previously and his aggressively-stated lack of interest in an arranged marriage, vows revenge because, well, he ate a mandrake root with Agnes during the brief time they knew one another. Agnes, on the other hand, seems torn between chivalrous Stephen and cynical Martin.It's epic and bloody and utterly stupid, and yet it's somehow compelling. The acting is, for the most part, horrendous, the sets are cheap, the script is just plain bad, the special effects vary in quality. But somehow we come to care about (some of) these characters. I think a great deal of it has to do with Rutger Hauer's powerful charisma (despite his rather weak acting abilities, at least in this film); his presence onscreen seems to lend an odd dignity to things, despite his status in this film as something of a lowlife (albeit the leader of the lowlifes). His character is a person who is a lowlife not by choice, as those around him, but by circumstance; after he and his band liberate a castle from its owners, and with the well-born Agnes to show him how to comport himself among the genteel, he eagerly seizes the chance, while the other mercenaries still act like animals. Granted, there's a great deal more that Verhoeven could have done with this subplot, as there's a great deal more he could have done with most of the avenues he peeks down, but doesn't explore, in this movie, but that it's here at all says this wasn't your basic low-budget swords-and-sorcery flick.It's not a good film, by any means, but it is a very watchable film (not least because Jennifer Jason Leigh spends so much time with so little on in the second half of the movie). Certainly superior to every American film Verhoeven made after Total Recall.

Nobleman Arnolfini (Fernando Hilbeck) has decided its time for his book-headed son, Stephen (Tom Burlinson), to wed.So much for love, but on the war side, Arnolfini has used a rowdy band of commoners and mercenary peasants led by Martin (a very young Rutger Hauer) to clear his city of miscreants.  The peasants present a problem in and of themselves, so Arnolfini reneges on his promise to them, refusing to pay them for their help.Led by Martin and a mad priest, the band of peasants raid Arnolfini's caravan, wounding Arnolfini and unknowingly kidnapping young Agnes.  As the peasants celebrate their spoils, Agnes is discovered hiding underneath a pile of clothing and is pulled out and raped.  Yes, the rape scene is pretty graphic, but it actually blends with the movie.  The surroundings of Flesh And Blood are not the pretty castles and noble knights and clean cities of LOTR.  The women are prosties, course and vulgar, the speech is rough, the landscape mud and blood and hanged men.Agnes, however, is a selfish girl, spoiled and used to getting her way.  She manipulates Martin into choosing her over his wanton wench, so that he would keep her to himself and not share her around the group.  At first reluctantly, and then with more vigor, she joins with the marauders as they raid and capture a castle.Stephen finds he must pull his head out of his books and rescue Agnes, so he gathers and army to assault the castle the peasants have barricaded themselves in.  Using engines and structures of his book's designs, he lays siege to the castle, including flinging corpses riddled with plague over the walls.Agnes, it seems, is torn.  Who should she back in this battle to the death?  He betrothed nobleman?  Or the wild mercenary who has shown her the pleasant things in life?'Flesh And Blood' is gritty and visually real, though there are flaws in the film as well.  Such as, the speed in which plague takes to infect and sicken a person, but its flaws do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film.  Especially if you like medieval type flicks.There is violence, nudity, and blood, so this isn't an LOTR kind of movie made for kids.  The supporting cast, especially Brion James, performs extremely well.  The film has excellent cinematography, a good script, great acting, superb costume design, and lots of grittiness.  Enough to keep this horror/fantasy girl quite happy.  Definitely a 'Buy'.

Historical accuracy was obviously never the intention, so if that is what you want, look elsewhere. So, what is the point? The movie has no true heroes or villains. No character is truly always noble or always base. The movie is filled with violence, nudity, rape, murder, not for thrills, but to demonstrate the truth of any quest for vengeance - it will bring horror and will only bring redemption when you surrender your bloodlust and escape secretely to an open future without sticking around to drive nails in the coffin. The acting is human, not heroic, which fits the theme. This movie is not for those seeking to escape reality; it is a dark reminder of it. Hate breads hate. Forgiveness and compassion bread life. Flesh and Blood has been one of my favorite movies ever since I first viewed it back in the mid 1990's and I rewatch it every few years. It just does not get old. It is not a light movie. It is brutal. So, again, if you want to see a heroic fairy tale, try The Princess Bride. If you want historic accuracy of the age portrayed, try A Man for All Seasons perhaps.
