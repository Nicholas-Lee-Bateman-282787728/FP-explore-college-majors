1650199,A3TOLK34MJLKLE,B00CQ8792G,Bruce E. Roberts,"[0, 0]","Based on THE BEST animated movies ever made, How To Train Your Dragon, it is just as appealing as the movie and carries the story forward and shows the humor and danger in working with Dragons.  A lot of new characters and most important, new Dragons.  The same voice actors for the kids are used and that does lend familiarity to the show.  It's extremely well animated for a TV show but that seems to be Dreamworks plan now.  Both Kung Fu Panda and The Dragon Riders/Defenders TV shows make any other animated TV series pale in comparison.  It's off the air right now because Dreamworks is concentration on the 2nd Dragon Movie due out June 14, 1014 then there are 3 seasons of the TV show to go, for now.  There will be a 3rd HTTYD movie next year so maybe the TV show will continue on for as long as it can.

1650201,AA7P2NEC94K79,B00CQ8792G,J. Pappan,"[0, 0]","This series is a must have if your kid(s) are entertained by the movie that spawned this series, ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and Part 1 of ""Riders of the Berk"". Many of the same voice actors have returned to complete the series, and the ones that didn't return were replaced by great impersonators, so your kids (or you) won't know the difference.One observation on this series, the production company didn't spend the money on the new characters. In the world of computer graphics (CG), when you make a new character, you have to develop a 3D model of that character, which is extremely time consuming and tedious. Once the character (or model) is created, you can use that model over and over again. That being said, the characters from the film look great in this series, just like the movie, but you'll notice a significant difference between them and any new characters - which will appear somewhat rough and cheap. I don't think kids really notice or care, but I'm interested to see if others have noticed.Still, this is a series worth owning.There are 9 episodes in Part 2 (2 disc set):Disc 1:ThawfestWhen Lightning StrikesWhat Flies BeneathTwinsanityDefiant OneDisc 2:Breakneck BogGem of a Different ColorWe are Family Part IWe are Family Part IIThe 9 episodes gets you 3 hours and 22 minutes of actual Dragon footage (1 hours 52 min on Disc 1, 1 hour 30 minutes on Disc 2), so you're getting a lot more content than a feature film.
