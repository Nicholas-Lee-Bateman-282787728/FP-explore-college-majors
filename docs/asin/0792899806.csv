157970,A26R4PDCZX5SOK,0792899806,"Amazon Customer ""The World According to JimG944""","[0, 0]","2 of 5 stars to the 1980's typical teen comedy movie Johnny Be Good. To the movies credit, it has several young actors who turn out to be name-brand people. How about Uma Thurman? Robert Downey Jr? Anthony Michael Hall? So that was good.The plot is about a high school football star who is trying to decide which college to attend. So, we follow AM Hall as his character visits several colleges who each roll-out the red carpet with VIP perks to get him to decide in their favor. The whole thing would be OK if you can possible believe that Hall COULD be a football star. My thinking is that on his first tackle, he'd be broken-up into little parts. He simply was not believeable as a star player.So, the movie was mildly funny with the usual plot twists and gags. Nothing special to recommend this movie. As I said at the start, a typical 1980's style comedy. Oh, it had too much 1980's synthesized music--my head hurts.You can skip this one.",2,Typical 1980's teen comedy movie,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,943,"['2', '5', 'stars', '1980', 'typical', 'teen', 'comedy', 'movie', 'Johnny', 'Be', 'Good', 'movies', 'credit', 'several', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'name-brand', 'people', 'How', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'was', 'good.The', 'plot', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'star', 'who', 'trying', 'decide', 'college', 'attend', 'So', 'follow', 'AM', 'Hall', 'character', 'visits', 'several', 'colleges', 'who', 'roll-out', 'red', 'carpet', 'VIP', 'perks', 'get', 'decide', 'favor', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'can', 'possible', 'believe', 'Hall', 'COULD', 'be', 'football', 'star', 'thinking', 'first', 'tackle', ""'d"", 'be', 'broken-up', 'little', 'parts', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'believeable', 'star', 'player.So', 'movie', 'was', 'mildly', 'funny', 'usual', 'plot', 'twists', 'gags', 'Nothing', 'special', 'recommend', 'movie', 'said', 'start', 'typical', '1980', 'style', 'comedy', 'Oh', 'had', 'too', 'much', '1980', 'synthesized', 'music', 'head', 'hurts.You', 'can', 'skip', 'one']",Johnny Be Good VHS

He and Robert Downey Jr. were incredible goofballs on set, and you could never believe anything they said, so it was easy for me to be a viper onscreen. There was always a huge line of teenage girls outside Robert and Anthony's trailers, we had to shoo them away. We were all aware that our director, though a well-known cinematographer, was a first-time director. He joshed a lot with us all. Cool, but the movie was changed as we went along and it wreaked havoc. It was Uma Thurman's first film as well, as she was a model and 15-16 years old. Robert Downey tried to convince me his dad was a famous opera singer... Oh yeah, ""Eraserhead"" was an opera. Almost all the footage Robert did was on-the-spot improv, and he was brilliant at it. The monologue he has in the film was made up entirely on the spot, and Bud kept it. I told Robert I thought he'd be a brilliant serious actor. He looked at me, mask dropped, and he said, ""Have you heard of 'Less Than Zero?', and I told him I had. He said he'd been offered the script, and was thinking of taking it. He did, and it made his career. All in all, this is one stupid film... But that's what makes it so dang funny, and such a classic. All the performers became film luminaries. If you insist on seeing the cheerleaders (who were in reality all strippers from a local men's club) flash the sheriff, then look around, you may find it.

157981,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,0792899806,Richard Ross,"[2, 3]","I got the wrong Anthony Michael Hall movie by mistake. I wanted 'Johnny Be Good' a comedy that co-stars Robert Downey, Jr. and Uma Thurman (in her film debut) but instead I got 'The Dead Zone'- no laughs and horrendously bad performances from a couple of stiffs. Each one of the three leads are incredibly likable and versatile, in other  movies, so it's disappointing they couldn't bring some sort of life to their idiotic characters. Hall sleepwalks through his role mumbling all of his dialogue so that it's barely intelligible and Downey Jr. is so over-the-top it's grating and even painful to watch. I'm not implying anything, but both men had well documented substance problems around the time the movie was made. Maybe that would explain some of the more confusing and bizarre aspects of their performances. Thurman isn't given anything more to do than look beautiful as Hall's girlfriend and throw a couple of tantrums whenever her immature boyfriend misbehaves, which is often.Johnny Walker (Hall) is a star high-school football player who finds himself bombarded with offers from college scouts who all want him to play for their teams. Promised endless amounts of money, girls, fame, and apartments, Johnny can't decide where he should go. His best friend Leo (Downey Jr.) isn't good enough to make it on his own so his only hope is to convince Johnny to go to UCC where both men are guaranteed spots on the team. The boy's obnoxious coach Hisler (Paul Gleason), has his own motives for convincing Johnny what college to attend. If he can get Walker to sign with Piermont University, Hisler will get the head  coaching job. Unable to make up his mind Johnny goes on several campus tours where he sees everything but the campus. Tons of cheerleaders, hookers and strippers make themselves readily available for Johnny and four other draft picks. When he gets back from these tours his girlfriend Georgia (Thurman) is none too happy to learn of her boyfriend's indiscretions. Georgia wants Johnny to go to college with her so that they'll stay together. What's a boy like John to do? The film doesn't attempt to come up with answers, instead trafficking in stereotypes and cliches. None of the characters or situations they find themselves in are believable at all. This is one disposable 80s flick that's notable only for being Uma's first movie. Other than that, there's nothing worth recommending.",2,Johnny Be Better Than This,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2409,"['got', 'wrong', 'Anthony', 'Michael', 'Hall', 'movie', 'mistake', 'wanted', 'Be', 'Good', 'comedy', 'co-stars', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'film', 'debut', 'instead', 'got', ""'The"", 'Dead', ""Zone'-"", 'laughs', 'horrendously', 'bad', 'performances', 'couple', 'stiffs', 'one', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'incredibly', 'likable', 'versatile', 'other', 'movies', 'disappointing', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'sort', 'life', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'Hall', 'role', 'mumbling', 'dialogue', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'grating', 'even', 'painful', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'implying', 'anything', 'men', 'had', 'well', 'documented', 'substance', 'problems', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'explain', 'more', 'confusing', 'bizarre', 'aspects', 'performances', 'Thurman', ""n't"", 'given', 'anything', 'more', 'do', 'look', 'beautiful', 'Hall', 'girlfriend', 'throw', 'couple', 'tantrums', 'whenever', 'immature', 'boyfriend', 'misbehaves', 'often.Johnny', 'Walker', 'Hall', 'star', 'high-school', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'bombarded', 'offers', 'college', 'scouts', 'who', 'want', 'play', 'teams', 'Promised', 'endless', 'amounts', 'money', 'girls', 'fame', 'apartments', 'Johnny', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'best', 'friend', 'Leo', 'Downey', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'own', 'so', 'only', 'hope', 'convince', 'Johnny', 'go', 'UCC', 'where', 'men', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'spots', 'team', 'boy', 'obnoxious', 'coach', 'Hisler', 'Paul', 'Gleason', 'own', 'motives', 'convincing', 'Johnny', 'what', 'college', 'attend', 'can', 'get', 'Walker', 'sign', 'Piermont', 'University', 'Hisler', 'will', 'get', 'head', 'coaching', 'job', 'Unable', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'Johnny', 'several', 'campus', 'tours', 'where', 'everything', 'campus', 'Tons', 'cheerleaders', 'hookers', 'strippers', 'make', 'readily', 'available', 'Johnny', 'four', 'other', 'draft', 'picks', 'When', 'back', 'tours', 'girlfriend', 'Georgia', 'Thurman', 'none', 'too', 'happy', 'learn', 'boyfriend', 'indiscretions', 'Georgia', 'Johnny', 'go', 'college', 'so', ""'ll"", 'stay', 'together', 'What', 'boy', 'John', 'do', 'film', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'come', 'up', 'answers', 'instead', 'trafficking', 'stereotypes', 'cliches', 'None', 'characters', 'situations', 'find', 'are', 'believable', 'one', 'disposable', '80s', 'flick', 'notable', 'only', 'being', 'Uma', 'first', 'movie', 'Other', 'nothing', 'worth', 'recommending']",Johnny Be Good VHS
