295753,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6302098459,Anyechka,"[0, 1]","This actually doesn't seem like a half-bad little film if one takes it as a children's fairytale and not a Three Stooges movie.  It is interesting and pleasant enough, and sticks fairly well to the familiar Snow White story (with the obvious exception of the Seven Dwarves not being in it); I can definitely see it as being rather appealing to young children.  And it is gorgeous to look at, being in Technicolor.  However, even taking that into consideration, it doesn't exactly hold up as great top-notch entertainment either.  It just symbolises what the Stooges had become in this final phase of their career when they were being marketed heavily to children and forced to seriously tone down the slapstick violence by parents' groups.  Being child-friendly does not have to equate being boring, watered-down, lame, and unintelligent.  A lot of their classic shorts can be considered child-friendly without being bad kiddy fare.  And if the kids of the era were able to watch those shorts in syndication without incident, it wouldn't have killed the powers that be to have allowed some more violence in their features.  (There are a couple of pretty violent scenes, but none of them with the Stooges.)  Apart from the opening scene where the prologue is told via the storybook, with the Stooges periodically popping up on pages where they shouldn't, the only times I laughed were when the film was so unintentionally bad it was funny.Moe and Larry do a valiant job with the crummy material (and DeRita once again exhibits no real chemistry with them, let alone much of a personality), but apart from that, there's some extraordinarily bad acting, particularly from Carol Heiss.  She was rather pretty and was a great iceskater, but who told her she could act?  And then there are the lame songs and some rather long and boring iceskating scenes, esp. the one around the midway point.  At least these songs and iceskating scenes might not have seemed so bad had they actually had something to do with the plot.  And while it is a kind of nice change of pace to see the Stooges in dramatic pathos-laden roles, they just don't seem like themselves.  The kindly grandfatherly types they played in this era are so at odds with their well-established characters from the entire rest of their career!  We know that at heart they're sympathetic and even lovable guys, but they're not supposed to be this nice and sweet!  The color also makes them look their age; in black and white, even in the last of their shorts, they seem beyond the constraints of their actual ages.  In particular, it makes Moe's eye-bags look even more pronounced.  I'm glad they were finally able to be in starring full-length features and to make serious money after so long of being exploited, but I just wish these features had been more tailored to their talents and strengths, instead of being boring embarrassing sappy watered-down bad kiddy fare.  While I could recommend it as a nice old-fashioned children's movie, I could never recommend it as a great Stooges movie.",3,"Not that bad, not that great",1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,3047,"['actually', ""n't"", 'seem', 'half-bad', 'little', 'film', 'one', 'children', 'fairytale', 'not', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'movie', 'interesting', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'sticks', 'fairly', 'well', 'familiar', 'Snow', 'White', 'story', 'obvious', 'exception', 'Seven', 'not', 'being', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'being', 'rather', 'appealing', 'young', 'children', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'being', 'Technicolor', 'However', 'even', 'taking', 'consideration', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'great', 'top-notch', 'entertainment', 'either', 'just', 'what', 'Stooges', 'had', 'become', 'final', 'phase', 'career', 'when', 'were', 'being', 'marketed', 'heavily', 'children', 'forced', 'seriously', 'tone', 'down', 'slapstick', 'violence', 'parents', 'groups', 'Being', 'child-friendly', 'not', 'have', 'equate', 'being', 'boring', 'watered-down', 'lame', 'unintelligent', 'lot', 'classic', 'shorts', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'child-friendly', 'being', 'bad', 'kiddy', 'fare', 'kids', 'era', 'were', 'able', 'watch', 'shorts', 'syndication', 'incident', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'killed', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'allowed', 'more', 'violence', 'features', 'are', 'couple', 'pretty', 'violent', 'scenes', 'none', 'Stooges', 'Apart', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'prologue', 'told', 'storybook', 'Stooges', 'periodically', 'popping', 'up', 'pages', 'where', 'should', ""n't"", 'only', 'times', 'laughed', 'were', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'unintentionally', 'bad', 'was', 'funny.Moe', 'Larry', 'do', 'valiant', 'job', 'crummy', 'material', 'DeRita', 'once', 'again', 'real', 'chemistry', 'let', 'alone', 'much', 'personality', 'apart', 'extraordinarily', 'bad', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'was', 'rather', 'pretty', 'was', 'great', 'iceskater', 'who', 'told', 'could', 'act', 'then', 'are', 'lame', 'songs', 'rather', 'long', 'boring', 'iceskating', 'scenes', 'esp', 'one', 'midway', 'point', 'least', 'songs', 'iceskating', 'scenes', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'seemed', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'actually', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'plot', 'kind', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'see', 'Stooges', 'dramatic', 'pathos-laden', 'roles', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'kindly', 'grandfatherly', 'types', 'played', 'era', 'are', 'so', 'odds', 'well-established', 'characters', 'entire', 'rest', 'career', 'know', 'heart', ""'re"", 'sympathetic', 'even', 'lovable', 'guys', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'nice', 'sweet', 'color', 'also', 'look', 'age', 'black', 'white', 'even', 'last', 'shorts', 'seem', 'constraints', 'actual', 'ages', 'particular', 'Moe', 'eye-bags', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'finally', 'able', 'be', 'starring', 'full-length', 'features', 'make', 'serious', 'money', 'so', 'long', 'being', 'exploited', 'just', 'wish', 'features', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'tailored', 'talents', 'strengths', 'instead', 'being', 'boring', 'embarrassing', 'sappy', 'watered-down', 'bad', 'kiddy', 'fare', 'could', 'recommend', 'nice', 'old-fashioned', 'children', 'movie', 'could', 'never', 'recommend', 'great', 'Stooges', 'movie']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS
295754,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,6302098459,"Bruce Barker ""Risingsnow""","[2, 2]","After reading the reviews - good and bad both - and seeing how quickly the lore of the legendary Stooges is being eroded and changed - I felt compelled to set the record straight on a few things. The 3 stars is my rating of the movie itself, which should be viewed as a stand-alone film, NOT as a Stooges film. Anyone considering buying this movie should keep that fact at the front of their minds for a large number or reasons, some of which I'll get into here. I'll also correct a number of errors I discovered in other reviews. I've taken a lot of grief over the decades for loving the post-vaudevillian antics of the ""Fine/Howard Family,"" but these men lived their lives like candles; dripping away their lives in frequent pain only to be taken for granted as they tried to spread the light of laughter that was their meager talent. They deserve a modicum of respect.The movie was made at a time of great confusion in Hollywood. It was not the last Stooges movie, nor was it the first. If memory serves (when I'm not certain, I'll admit it) the final appearance of the 3 Stooges in a full-length film was in the classic, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World in 1963. The have little more than a cameo near the end of that epic comedic tribute, so don't buy that one looking for it to be a ""Stooges vehicle"" either. The last appearance by an individual member of the Stooges was in the 1970 film, ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" starring Vincent Price. Moe Howard had a supporting role in that film which, apart from the presence of Mr. Price and the footnote of it being Moe's final appearance in a movie, is largely forgettable.The hippie/beatnik/yippie ""revolution"" had not yet begun to spread across America, but the ""good old days"" of American innocence that were stripped away forever with the Kennedy assasination that was less than 2 years in the future were already beginning to show signs of trouble. Hollywood didn't know how to adapt or portray the country in films during this period of transition. Some movies still carried the style left over from the 40s and 50s, full of dated music and production numbers reminiscent of the old MGM musicals, and SW&T3S; is one of those. Basically, it was dated before it ever reached theaters.By the time of the film's release, the Three Stooges has ceased being a trio and had become an ""act."" The difference is that Hollywood though of them as one entity instead of 3 individual actors. The act had gone through several changes (translation, the Stooges, comprised almost entirely of family members, began dying)and after decades of frustration with Sam Goldwyn at MGM, went with 20 Century Fox in order to make full-length films instead of the one or two reeled shorts they were famous for. The ""Curly Joe"" character in this movie, as well as the others, is a long-time character actor named Joe Derita. He was hired because he was the exact same height as Moe and Larry (5' 4"") and only became a permanent part of the trio after Larry talked Moe into making Derita a full partner.Expecting Joe to be as funny as Jerome (Curly) isn't even close to being fair. Curly was a unique soul and literally gave his life for our pleasure. As you watch this movie (or any other piece featuring DeRita, Joe Besser, or even Moe's brother Shemp) try not to hold it against the ""third stooge"" for not being Curly and you will come to appreciate the movie and the character a whole lot more.Of the full-length Stooge films, this one sits somewhere in the lower half in terms of quality and fun, but it is a valid part of Stooge history and earns a place in any true Three Stooges collection on its own merits, not just as a pale reflection of a once bright light. For a truly great history of this gifted group of men, I would recommend the book, ""Moe Howard & The Three Stooges."" It's not the easiest thing in the world to find (and is often priced north of $150 when you CAN find it) but it is their story, told mostly by Moe himself. (His daughter wrote the final chapter and a half when Moe passed away without completing the memoir)I suggest that anyone reading this (yeah, I mean YOU, ya chowdahhead) take the time to focus on a particular Stooge and rewatch several of the classic shorts. You will find Moe had a comedic timing to rival Groucho's (VERY high praise) and, along with frequent director ""Jules"" White an instinctive sense of what the fans wanted. Larry was perhaps the best ""straight man"" in film history and his role as the glue that held their works together is criminally underappreciated. Curly was... well, you already know, don't you. Shemp, a ladies man, was the original third Stooge - replaced by Curly and then coming out of retirement after Curly's untimely death. That's why he appears so young in some of the shorts. It's hard to believe it, but the Three Stooges became famous superstars before Curly even arrived and if you give him a chance to prove himself, Shemp had some pretty impressive chops of his own. Joe Besser is the least popular of the ""Curly(s)"" and justifiably so. He never really developed his own personality in the role. But then again, imagine having to fill the shoes of BOTH Shemp and Curly. The poor guy never stood a chance. DeRita understood that there was no replacing these men and instead chose to simply be himself. He's not the easiest guy in the world to love to be honest, but he deserves credit for keeping the Stooges as an ""act"" viable far longer than just about anyone else on earth could have.Anyway, I apologize for the lack of brevity in this review, but I kept it as short as I could while still correcting some misstatements made regarding the film and the Stooges themselves. Look at the pricetag on the film for a second. It sells for less than a big bucket of popcorn at most modern movie houses. Even ""weaker"" Stooge movies are worth double that. Now you know what you're getting before you buy it and you know that it's still a bargain. When you watch it, meet the movie on level ground and you will appreciate it for what it is; a snapshot of that brief moment of time in the history of cinema between the joy of American prosperity and the horror of being eye-witness to the death of innocence that was on the horizon. I don't think you'll regret it and you will get to spend some time with three guys who spent their entire lives dedicated to making you and your children's children smile.",3,An informed review from a

This film was tailored as a showcase for five-time Olympic champion iceskater Carol Heiss, and while she lacks the dramatic finesse of a true actress, she deeply feels the role of Snow White and does a fine job.In this version of the tale, the Wicked Queen (played with aplomb by B-movie bad girl Patricia Medina) plots to kill lovely Snow White (Carol Heiss) as well as the prince of a neighbouring kingdom.  Both plans flounder, and the two royal refugees find solace in the company of a wandering minstrel trio (played by--of course--the Three Stooges).  What follows is a wonderful mix of comedy, adventure and breathless romance as Snow White and her Prince Charming skate towards their ""sky of happiness"".As an all-skating, all-musical version of SNOW WHITE, this version hits the mark beautifully.  Playing the thankless role of the Prince Charming is no easy assignment, but Edson Stroll does what he can with the part--most of the time he just stands around looking pretty, but what else does a fairytale prince do?  Likewise, Carol Heiss rarely rises above the level of department-store mannequin in her performance as Snow White, but achieves what she can, and really comes alive with her ice-skating routines.Patricia Medina manages to hold back in her rendering of the Wicked Queen; it would have been so easy for the role to be done in a high-camp style, but Ms Medina stays true to the material and plays it straight.  The Three Stooges likewise curb their usual comic schtick, and it does make a refreshing and welcome change.  They could sometimes be subtle, and the proof is right here.The production values are indeed lavish.  The director, Walter Lang, almost bankrupted the Twentieth Century-Fox studios with his incredible ice-rink sets, and there are several wonderful skating sequences to savour, including a ""Dream Ballet"" for Stroll and Heiss.  The musical numbers do little to advance the plot, but are very pretty, and highlights include ""Magic Day"" and ""That Place Called Happiness"".As with any film version of a fairytale classic, it's hard not to get caught up in the romance and adventure--the same is true for SNOW WHITE & THE THREE STOOGES.The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the film, plus the trailer.

In fact, the movie is more of a vehicle for a musical Holiday on Ice tour rather than the standard Stooges romp. Had the movie been produced and released in the 80s or 90s and had the boys popularity been still at its height it might have spawned something similar to a Disney on Ice presentation. Unfortunately, we'll never know, but the beginning skating musical number with Heiss, the songs sung by Stroll and Heiss, the dream sequence with the Prince, the evil Queen and the Stooges to the rescue and of course the ending sing-a-long all seem geared toward that end. Veteran Actress Patricia Medina has the plum role as the evil Queen and Witch, but with lines like ""You needn't make it sound as if I enjoy annihilating children, I only do it when it's unavoidable"" how could she go wrong? Guy Rolfe does an excellent job as the evil Count Ogre, no poor man's Basil Rathbone by any means. Look, despite its additional twists to the fairy story this doesn't win any major awards. It isn't the slap-stickiest stooge film, but it's a lavish and colorful, musical fairytale with just the right amount of pathos to counter-balance the happiest of endings. My only regret is that Carol Heiss didn't perform the musical version of this actually on Ice. I'm sure she didn't lose sleep over it though as the retired Olympic and World Champion skater became a very prominent figure skating Coach in later years and I believe still coaches today - a real happy ending after all.Postscript: Anyone notice Quinto's voice sounds alot like Bugs Bunny?

""Snow White & The Three Stooges"" was a milestone film for the boys in several ways: first, it was their only feature film to be made for a big name studio (20th Century Fox); second, to have a sizeable budget (well over $1 million, fairly large for a children's movie in 1961); and third, their one & only major film shot in color (the never-finished 1970 film ""Kooks Tour"" notwithstanding). Again, the money was there, so why not? Columbia certainly wasn't shelling it out as all of their features were shot in black & white and on shoestring budgets until the end.I've read quite a few of the previous reviews stating that this wasn't the ""real"" Three Stooges and that their antics of old are all but gone, and while I do agree with both, you have to remember that all of them were in their late fifties by this time (in Moe's case, his early sixties), and also the Stooges were bowing to public pressure to tone down the violence. If this hadn't already been the case, they probably would've toned it down themselves anyway, because how convincing would it be watching retirement-age men slapping each other around? Probably not very. If anything, they would've ended up making an embarassing mockery of themselves had they kept at it.That notwithstanding, this movie is very delightful; there's certainly plenty of ice skating going on here as Carol Heiss was a renowned Olympic skating champion in 1960. She really wasn't much of an actress, so what else would there have been for her to do in this film except to skate? As you might expect, the Stooges are the good guys, taking the place of the Seven Dwarfs, who were, of all things, on ""vacation"" and allowed the Stooges to use their cottage!While the Stooges were pretty tame and ""sanitized"" here as some people have referred to it, their lack of violence was replaced by the swordfighting throughout the film, which to me was much more violent than slapping, eye-poking or head-clunking; I had forgotten about it until I saw the film again recently and never knew it was rated PG; I always thought it was G. After seeing the level of violence in the sword fights, I was not at all surprised.It was nice seeing this again after many years and was a real treat; I can't wait to watch it with my son when he gets a little older and hopefully he'll enjoy it as much as his Dad!",4,Delightful Children's Movie!,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,2490,"['definitely', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'going', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'matinees', 'child', 'early', '70', 'was', 'one', 'ones', 'saw', 'back', 'then', 'Snow', 'White', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'was', 'milestone', 'film', 'boys', 'several', 'ways', 'first', 'was', 'only', 'feature', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'big', 'name', 'studio', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'second', 'have', 'sizeable', 'budget', 'well', '1', 'million', 'fairly', 'large', 'children', 'movie', '1961', 'third', 'one', 'only', 'major', 'film', 'shot', 'color', 'never-finished', '1970', 'film', 'Kooks', 'Tour', 'notwithstanding', 'Again', 'money', 'was', 'there', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Columbia', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'shelling', 'out', 'features', 'were', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'shoestring', 'budgets', 'end.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'quite', 'few', 'previous', 'reviews', 'stating', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'antics', 'old', 'are', 'gone', 'do', 'agree', 'have', 'remember', 'were', 'late', 'fifties', 'time', 'Moe', 'case', 'early', 'sixties', 'also', 'Stooges', 'were', 'bowing', 'public', 'pressure', 'tone', 'down', 'violence', 'had', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'case', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'toned', 'down', 'anyway', 'how', 'convincing', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'retirement-age', 'men', 'slapping', 'other', 'Probably', 'not', 'very', 'anything', 'would', ""'ve"", 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'embarassing', 'mockery', 'had', 'kept', 'notwithstanding', 'movie', 'very', 'delightful', 'certainly', 'plenty', 'ice', 'skating', 'going', 'here', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'was', 'renowned', 'Olympic', 'skating', 'champion', '1960', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'actress', 'what', 'else', 'would', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'do', 'film', 'skate', 'might', 'expect', 'Stooges', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'taking', 'place', 'Seven', 'Dwarfs', 'who', 'were', 'things', 'vacation', 'allowed', 'Stooges', 'use', 'cottage', 'Stooges', 'were', 'pretty', 'tame', 'sanitized', 'here', 'people', 'have', 'referred', 'lack', 'violence', 'was', 'replaced', 'swordfighting', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'violent', 'slapping', 'eye-poking', 'head-clunking', 'had', 'forgotten', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'recently', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'rated', 'PG', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'G.', 'seeing', 'level', 'violence', 'sword', 'fights', 'was', 'not', 'surprised.It', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'again', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'watch', 'son', 'when', 'little', 'older', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'Dad']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS

I don't blame 20th Century Fox for trying to cash in on the Stooges craze at the time. Fox was desperately trying to save itself. During 1961, Fox was struggling to make ""Something's Got To Give,"" with a mostly-absent Marilyn Monroe, who was ultimately fired. The over-budgeted ""Cleopatra"" was in production in Europe at the same time with the million-dollar Elizabeth Taylor. So Fox was hoping this would be a nice easy way to bring in some much-needed revenue. The best thing about SW&TTS is seeing these men whom we have grown to love genuinely proving themselves as dramatic actors--the only good acting in the film, besides Patricia Medina. When Snow White is kidnapped and then dies, the fear and grief of Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe is really heartbreaking. I don't know whether director Walter Lang gets the credit or not. For whatever reason, the Stooges are the only reason to watch. If only the comedy could have kept up the momentum set by the clever opening credits. It's no worse than some of the abysmal later Columbia shorts, when Harry Cohn kept the boys working on a shoestring budget.

No one said it was supposed to be a comedy.So only a few slapstick routines the Stooges are known for are in this film. But after 30 years of eye poking, ear and hair pulling, full circle arm swings to the top of head poundings, saw blades losing their teeth, and anything else you can think of,I found it refreshing that the boys were finally given a chance to actually act. And not just beat each other up.This is a beautiful, well executed fairy tale filled with suspense, adventure, a little sadness and some humor carefully sprinkled throughout. The acting is as fairy tale acting should be.Speaking of acting. The Stooges turn out a wonderful performnce that would choke up any reasonable human being.The puppy burning, kitty drowning, rob the poor box ogres that submitted the unfair harsh reviews wouldn't agree with me.I'm a Three Stooges fan as best as can be expected, but let's face it though. They weren't always THAT funny to begin with.Look for the scene with the Stooges in the royal kitchen. The head chef gives a performance so reminiscent of Shemp it's almost spooky. The skating sequences can tend to be boring but they're not sleep inducing or dreadful.If you don't like the songs and there's only a few.You can hit NEXT and it goes to the next scene right after the song is over. The sets,costumes, outdoor scenery, background music,and overall mood is very similar to the the Errol Flynn classic The Adventures of Robin Hood.In fact that's what this movie can be seen as, Robin Hood for small children that adults can also enjoy watching. The full screen side starts off in a widescreen presentation for exactly 4 minutes and 33 seconds then BAMM fullscreen the rest of way. The widescreen side is remastered beautifully. I recommend watching the fullscreen side first. Then later in the day or the next day watch the glorious widescreen. Pay no attention to the heartless beasts berating this lovely family film.

I remember even when I was a little boy I refused to go to see this one, even when the other kids on the school bus said it was awesome.  Well, I finally gave in and I was confounded to see that it was practically an A film, with lots of stylish touches and a genuinely well-acted script by the ever-reliable Noel Langley (from the Brothers Grimm classic).  Langley also wrote (and directed!) one of my grandma's favorites, the pro-reincarnation docudrama THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY MURPHY.No dwarfs in sight, but Carol Heiss is a haunting Snow White, limited in range but with a strange beauty, like Gene Tierney's in LAURA.  No wonder little boys and girls alike were drawn to her.  I wonder if she could still be alive, what a shame she made no films after this one, but she must have been hard to cast, having so little acting talent.  Edson Stroll is super, and he really can act!  He was also in the Three Stooges' venture IN ORBIT the following year--wonder if he was sleeping with someone at the top?  Whoever put him in those russet tights knew what he was doing!The song that his little puppet, Quinto, sang to Snow White is so touching!  And Stroll does a great job of making it seem as though the Prince (disguised as the peasant, ""Quatro"") really is performing ventriloquism, moving the muscles in his tightly closed mouth while staring passionately at Carol Heiss while Quinto bleats out the love song.  Musical fans will notice the strong resemblance (strong enough for plagiarism?) between this main love theme and the Cole Porter tune ""True Love"" that Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly performed in HIGH SOCIETY a few years earlier.  Whatever, it is a gorgeous number and well sung by all concerned--little Quinto, handsome Stroll, and lovely Carol Heiss.Yes, she is an atrocious actress, but there's something appealing about her, you want to save her from her own bad acting.  Her voice isn't very modulated, but she's great on ice and the fantasy sequence where she dances on the multicolored ice rink is an unbelievable Technicolor spectacle.I don't know, I liked the kinder and gentler Stooges.  The scene where they have to tell Snow White about Prince Charming's supposed death is truly a heartbreaker.  Moe Howard acquits himself as an ace actor,  He really should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.As for Patricia Medina, she is way over the top, and not that great at it.  Her outfits are so loud she nearly gets lost in them.  I realize I'm in the minority here but I didn't care for her here.

Bernabo,"[3, 5]","I think the idea was probably to have &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot; do for the Three Stooges what the 1952 version of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; did for Abbott &amp; Costello, but this 1961 film does not come anywhere near that level of fun.  The Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Joe DeRita this late in the game) are pretty much supporting characters to Snow White, who is played by 1960 Olympic gold medalist skater Carol Heiss, in her one and only film.  Obviously the hope was that Heiss, who had won six straight medals at the World Championships (1955-1960) before winning the gold medal at Squaw Valley, would turn out to be another Sonja Heine.The grand irony is that the Stooges are rather likeable in this film, which means they are not really the Three Stooges.  They are the protectors of Snow White and you can actually make the argument that these are among the most realistic characters the Stooges ever played.  Of course, if you stop and think about it there are two pretty good reasons why this sanitized Stooges feature is devoid of physical punishment.  The first was that during this time, when the Stooges Columbia comedy shorts were being aired on television, there was a lot of parental concern that kids would emulate the Stooges slapstick violence and hurt each other.  So there was an effort to tone things down.  The second reason was that the Stooges were all in their sixties, and beating each other up was simply not going to look right.However, despite the less than stellar results this was not a throwaway production.  &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot; was directed by Walter Lang, who won an Oscar for &quot;The King and I,&quot; but also had directed the Stooges back in 1933's &quot;Meet the Baron.&quot;  Meanwhile, the script by Noel Langley and Elwood Ullman received a Writers Guild of America nomination for Best Written American Musical.  I sort of like the fact that the Stooges are the good guys in this, helping both Snow White and the novice actress Carol Heiss, but I have to admit these are not the real Three Stooges.  Young kids might like this for the most part, although they might be struck by how quaint the figure skating routines if they have seen any figure skating on television.  Then again, the same can be said for watching Sonja Heine, Peggy Fleming, and even (I cannot believe I am saying this) Dorothy Hamill.",3,The Three Stooges help out Carol Heiss' Snow White,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,2412,"['think', 'idea', 'was', 'probably', 'have', 'quot', 'Snow', 'White', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'quot', 'do', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'what', '1952', 'version', 'quot', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'quot', 'did', 'Abbott', 'amp', 'Costello', '1961', 'film', 'not', 'come', 'anywhere', 'level', 'fun', 'Stooges', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'Larry', 'Fine', 'Joe', 'DeRita', 'late', 'game', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Snow', 'White', 'who', 'played', '1960', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medalist', 'skater', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'one', 'only', 'film', 'Obviously', 'hope', 'was', 'Heiss', 'who', 'had', 'won', 'six', 'straight', 'medals', 'World', 'Championships', '1955-1960', 'winning', 'gold', 'medal', 'Squaw', 'Valley', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Sonja', 'Heine.The', 'grand', 'irony', 'Stooges', 'are', 'rather', 'likeable', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'are', 'protectors', 'Snow', 'White', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'argument', 'are', 'most', 'realistic', 'characters', 'Stooges', 'ever', 'played', 'course', 'stop', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'pretty', 'good', 'reasons', 'why', 'sanitized', 'Stooges', 'feature', 'devoid', 'physical', 'punishment', 'first', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Stooges', 'Columbia', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'were', 'being', 'aired', 'television', 'was', 'lot', 'parental', 'concern', 'kids', 'would', 'emulate', 'Stooges', 'slapstick', 'violence', 'hurt', 'other', 'was', 'effort', 'tone', 'things', 'down', 'second', 'reason', 'was', 'Stooges', 'were', 'sixties', 'beating', 'other', 'up', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'going', 'look', 'right.However', 'less', 'stellar', 'results', 'was', 'not', 'throwaway', 'production', 'quot', 'Snow', 'White', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'quot', 'was', 'directed', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'also', 'had', 'directed', 'Stooges', 'back', '1933', 'quot', 'Meet', 'Baron.', 'quot', 'Meanwhile', 'script', 'Noel', 'Langley', 'Elwood', 'Ullman', 'received', 'Writers', 'Guild', 'America', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Written', 'American', 'Musical', 'sort', 'fact', 'Stooges', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'helping', 'Snow', 'White', 'novice', 'actress', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Young', 'kids', 'might', 'like', 'most', 'part', 'might', 'be', 'struck', 'how', 'quaint', 'figure', 'skating', 'routines', 'have', 'seen', 'figure', 'skating', 'television', 'Then', 'again', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'watching', 'Sonja', 'Heine', 'Peggy', 'Fleming', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'am', 'saying', 'Dorothy', 'Hamill']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS

When the film was released in 1961, it was yet another flop Fox could ill afford. It is, however, a wonderful movie with fine performances by Carol Heiss in what was both her film debut and swan song, the ravishingly beautiful Patricia Medina, who conveyed the evil in her character without overdoing it, and Stroll, who, alas was little heard from since, though he became a regular on the TV series ""McHales's Navy"".The Cinemascope production is truly beautiful, with sets which convey the perfect fairy tale mood, as well as establishing where a good deal of the budget went. The music score by Lyn Murray, and the songs were delightful, as well. SW3S is, to be sure, best appreciated by lovers of fairy tale films than fans of the Three Stooges.Another criticism leveled at the film was the toned-down antics of the rowdy team. but, truthfully, there is little room for all-out slapstick in a fantasy of this kind, without destroying the mood. However, they did have a brief pie-throwing scene. In short, the film is successful as a very lavish and satisfying adaptation of the beloved fairy tale, and no apologies need be made for it.

It is a wonderful telling of the story of Snow White, with the Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe) stepping in for the Seven Dwarfs.  It is beautifully filmed, the tuneful musical score is well done and performed, and the cast is exceptional.Unfortunately, this film is not often looked well upon by the critics.  The most often-cited complaint is that the slaps, pokes, and other classic slapstick ""stooge"" routines are kept to a bare minimum.  Remember, this is a telling of Snow White--a fairytale.  Do you honestly think that the Stooges' slapstick comedy from their shorts days (and their Columbia feature films yet to come) have any place in a film like this?  The familiar slaps, pokes, and nyuk-nyuk-nyuks are not present.  I also appreciate that here, the Stooges are actually attempting to portray REAL serious characters rather than just slap each other around.  Also, keep in mind is that by the early 60s, the Columbia Stooge shorts were being shown on television, and it's been said that Moe was sensitive to parental complaints about the violence in the Stooge routines we know and love.  There is SOME Stooge comedy thrown in here and there, but not on the level that some might expect.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Stooges dearly, and have many of their tapes/DVDs, but if you take this film for what it really is, you'll find that it is truly enchanting.The new DVD transfer from 20th Century Fox Home Video is awsome.  Colors are bold and sharp and well defined.  For the first time since its 1961 release, we can see it in widescreen, which was not offered on the previous VHS version (only full-screen).  Both the widescreen and the full-screen versions are on the DVD (2 sides), and there is a theatrical trailer.  There are no other extra features, but no reason to gripe, as the package is available for less than $10.  The Columbia Records soundtrack LP is long out of print; it is really an amalgamation of the film's songs with some dialogue mixed in, as an attempt to tell the story on records.  It is not an essential listen, but worth picking up if you should come across it in the secondhand record store.The bottom line: Don't take the film as a Stooges vehicle.

Depending on the age group viewing, children might get bored during the long musical production numbers while waiting for the Stooges to return; die-hard Stooge fans might complain that the Stooges are taking a secondary role, providing much-needed comic relief for Olympic skater Carol Heiss & company; and others might find it a nice change of pace from all the Stooge's usual violent slapstick, and an utterly charming film.To accomodate the plot, Moe, Larry & Curly Joe have replaced the Seven Dwarfs, Prince Charming is their companion on their travels, and of course, there are many musical numbers performed on ice skates to showcase Heiss' talents (along with skaters who are made up in long shot masquerading as the Stooges).But, it's actually the villainy of Patricia Medina as the Wicked Queen and Guy Rolfe as her right-hand man who provide the more delicious moments of the story.It's a rare delight to see the Stooges in a big budgeted production--and in technicolor, no doubt! Their scene in which they return too late to find Snow White fallen victim to the poisonous bite of the apple is well done, and genuinely touching as they openly weep.It's true that the Stooges have done far funnier fare in their earlier years (even their current 1960's features).

295794,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,6302098459,Scott MacGillivray,"[2, 2]","SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES is unique in the Stooges' filmography. It is NOT a burlesque of the famous fairy tale. The title conjures up visions of The Three Stooges being clumsy and noisy and violent and generally making a shambles of the story. If that's what you like about The Three Stooges, this picture will probably be a disappointment. But if you're a serious Stooge buff who tries to see everything the team ever filmed, the Stooges will surprise you in this. They're mellower than usual and you'll see them actually doing the most dramatic acting of their careers, especially by Moe Howard (very effective in a bereavement scene, with broken voice and subtle gestures).In this costume piece, Moe, Larry, and Curly-Joe play itinerant peddlers (shades of their roles in 1951's GOLD RAIDERS) who rescue an orphaned boy from attack, and years later befriend a young girl who fears for her life. The boy turns out to be Prince Charming and the girl is Snow White, and the Stooges do everything in their power to protect them from the wicked Queen and her assassins.There are familiar story elements in this, courtesy of none other than Noel Langley, the screenwriter who adapted THE WIZARD OF OZ and the 1951 SCROOGE. Langley's script hits all the right notes as the story unfolds. (You'll recognize the ""forest,"" ""hourglass,"" ""three protectors,"" and ""wicked witch"" elements from OZ.) Stooge screenwriter Elwood Ullman contributed material for the Stooges, but it's much gentler than usual and more in keeping with the ""Snow White"" story. There is only one brief slapstick episode, with character comic Herbie Faye (familiar as ""Fender"" in Sgt. Bilko's platoon) on the receiving end of several pies. Faye acts and sounds like Shemp Howard!The production itself is handsome and elaborate, with superb color photography by ace Fox cameraman Leon Shamroy and good direction by Fox veteran Walter Lang. Carol Heiss will probably impress more with her skating than her acting, but she fills the demands of the role well. Edson Stroll is the juvenile lead and this is probably his biggest role (more footage than in his many years on ""McHale's Navy"" combined). Patricia Medina and Guy Rolfe are quite effective as the villains; Rolfe is reminiscent of Basil Rathbone in Errol Flynn's costume epics.The double-sided DVD includes both the widescreen and full-screen versions, as well as the long theatrical trailer. The restoration job is superior: picture is excellent and the sound is remarkable.This makes a good family-matinee show. If you DON'T like the Stooges, try this: you'll like their quieter brand of humor here. If you're a student of the Stooges, see it for the team's dramatics. If you only watch the Stooges for the slam-bang action and physical mayhem, you won't find them here, but it's worth a look: you might discover new things to like about the Stooges.",3,"Charming children's fantasy by OZ's Noel Langley, best for family viewing but Stoogeheads should see this at least once",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2877,"['SNOW', 'WHITE', 'THE', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'unique', 'Stooges', 'filmography', 'NOT', 'burlesque', 'famous', 'fairy', 'tale', 'title', 'up', 'visions', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'being', 'clumsy', 'noisy', 'violent', 'generally', 'making', 'shambles', 'story', 'what', 'like', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'picture', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointment', ""'re"", 'serious', 'Stooge', 'buff', 'who', 'see', 'everything', 'team', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Stooges', 'will', 'surprise', ""'re"", 'mellower', 'usual', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actually', 'doing', 'most', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'careers', 'especially', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'very', 'effective', 'bereavement', 'scene', 'broken', 'voice', 'subtle', 'gestures', '.In', 'costume', 'piece', 'Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly-Joe', 'play', 'itinerant', 'peddlers', 'shades', 'roles', '1951', 'GOLD', 'RAIDERS', 'who', 'rescue', 'orphaned', 'boy', 'attack', 'years', 'later', 'befriend', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'life', 'boy', 'out', 'be', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'girl', 'Snow', 'White', 'Stooges', 'do', 'everything', 'power', 'protect', 'wicked', 'Queen', 'assassins.There', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'elements', 'courtesy', 'none', 'other', 'Noel', 'Langley', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'adapted', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', '1951', 'SCROOGE', 'Langley', 'script', 'right', 'notes', 'story', 'unfolds', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'forest', 'hourglass', 'three', 'protectors', 'wicked', 'witch', 'elements', 'OZ', 'Stooge', 'screenwriter', 'Elwood', 'Ullman', 'contributed', 'material', 'Stooges', 'much', 'gentler', 'usual', 'more', 'keeping', 'Snow', 'White', 'story', 'only', 'one', 'brief', 'slapstick', 'episode', 'character', 'comic', 'Herbie', 'Faye', 'familiar', 'Fender', 'Sgt', 'Bilko', 'platoon', 'receiving', 'end', 'several', 'pies', 'Faye', 'acts', 'sounds', 'Shemp', 'Howard', 'production', 'handsome', 'elaborate', 'superb', 'color', 'photography', 'ace', 'Fox', 'cameraman', 'Leon', 'Shamroy', 'good', 'direction', 'Fox', 'veteran', 'Walter', 'Lang', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'will', 'probably', 'impress', 'more', 'skating', 'acting', 'demands', 'role', 'well', 'Edson', 'Stroll', 'juvenile', 'lead', 'probably', 'biggest', 'role', 'more', 'footage', 'many', 'years', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'combined', 'Patricia', 'Medina', 'Guy', 'Rolfe', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'villains', 'Rolfe', 'reminiscent', 'Basil', 'Rathbone', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'costume', 'epics.The', 'double-sided', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'full-screen', 'versions', 'as', 'well', 'long', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'restoration', 'job', 'superior', 'picture', 'excellent', 'sound', 'remarkable.This', 'good', 'family-matinee', 'show', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'like', 'Stooges', 'try', ""'ll"", 'like', 'quieter', 'brand', 'humor', 'here', ""'re"", 'student', 'Stooges', 'see', 'team', 'dramatics', 'only', 'watch', 'Stooges', 'slam-bang', 'action', 'physical', 'mayhem', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'look', 'might', 'discover', 'new', 'things', 'like', 'Stooges']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS

The cast is all beautiful/handsome and the ice skating flawlessly performed by all. FYI - after watching this as a Netflix rental I bought the DVD to add to my personal collection. - SBJ",5,Snow White and the Three Stooges,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,815,"['very', 'much', 'toned', 'down', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'where', 'are', 'almost', 'serious', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'do', 'less', '34', '34', 'face', 'slapping', 'eye-poking', 'hammer-heading', 'antics', 'Stooge', 'fans', 'are', 'familiar', 'being', 'said', 'tone', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'telling', 'fairest', 'Snow', 'White/Carol', 'Heiss', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Wicked', 'Queen/Patricia', 'Medina', 'handsome', 'Prince', 'Charming/Edson', 'Stroll', 'color', 'fantastic', 'time', 'sets', 'are', 'belief', 'ice', 'skating', 'scenes', 'are', 'expertly', 'flawlessly', 'performed', '1960', 'Olympic', 'figure-skating', 'champion', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'cast', 'beautiful/handsome', 'ice', 'skating', 'flawlessly', 'performed', 'FYI', 'watching', 'Netflix', 'rental', 'bought', 'DVD', 'add', 'personal', 'collection', 'SBJ']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS

The boys are a bit long in the tooth and long past the frenetic physical stunts and slapstick that made them legends.  True, Curly Joe is no Curly Howard and the Stooges are not in enough of the scenes to satisfy their die-hard fans.  That being said, SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES is a pleasant film that will delight younger audiences, providing a mixture of fairy tale with gentle comedy.  It is a film that the whole family can watch and enjoy.The film was beautifully filmed in Cinemascope and is presented on the DVD in both full-screen and wide-screen format.  The picture and sound quality are excellent and it is great to see its wide-screen presentation and pristine technicolor.  Carol Heiss, a champion skater and 1960 Olympic Gold Medal winner (although no actress in the real sense), does a decent job in the title role, and Edson Stroll gives a good journeyman's performance as Quatro/Prince Charming.  The villains are well played by Patricia Medina (the wicked queen) and British character actor, Guy Rolfe (as Count Oga).  Although uncredited, veteran actor and comic, Herbie Faye gives an absolutely Shemp-like performance as the head cook in the queen's kitchen on the receiving end of a number of pies.There are a number of critics who lambast the film.  I believe Leonard Maltin, or was it Moe Howard himself, referred to it as a ""technicolor mistake"" and perhaps, by classic Three Stooges measures, it is somewhat true. The dialogue is somewhat stilted, the songs are generally mediocre and the film needed tighter editing.  However, the Stooges offer something in this film not seen in their classic shorts - genuine pathos and character, particularly when they tell Snow White of the Prince's apparent demise or when they find her body after she had bitten the apple.  It makes one wonder what might have been, if the Stooges had been consistently given Grade A writing and direction, as well as the opportunity to stretch their acting abilities when in their prime.",3,"Not classic ""Stooges,"" But a Pleasant Little Film.",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,2041,"['Okay', 'not', 'classic', 'stooge', 'comedy', 'boys', 'are', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'long', 'frenetic', 'physical', 'stunts', 'slapstick', 'made', 'True', 'Curly', 'Joe', 'Curly', 'Howard', 'Stooges', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'scenes', 'satisfy', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'being', 'said', 'SNOW', 'WHITE', 'THE', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'pleasant', 'film', 'will', 'delight', 'younger', 'audiences', 'providing', 'mixture', 'fairy', 'tale', 'gentle', 'comedy', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy.The', 'film', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Cinemascope', 'presented', 'DVD', 'full-screen', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'great', 'see', 'wide-screen', 'presentation', 'pristine', 'technicolor', 'Carol', 'Heiss', 'champion', 'skater', '1960', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'Medal', 'winner', 'actress', 'real', 'sense', 'decent', 'job', 'title', 'role', 'Edson', 'Stroll', 'good', 'journeyman', 'performance', 'Quatro/Prince', 'Charming', 'villains', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'Patricia', 'Medina', 'wicked', 'queen', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'Guy', 'Rolfe', 'Count', 'Oga', 'uncredited', 'veteran', 'actor', 'comic', 'Herbie', 'Faye', 'absolutely', 'Shemp-like', 'performance', 'head', 'cook', 'queen', 'kitchen', 'receiving', 'end', 'number', 'pies.There', 'are', 'number', 'critics', 'who', 'lambast', 'film', 'believe', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'was', 'Moe', 'Howard', 'referred', 'technicolor', 'mistake', 'perhaps', 'classic', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'somewhat', 'true', 'dialogue', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'songs', 'are', 'generally', 'mediocre', 'film', 'needed', 'tighter', 'editing', 'However', 'Stooges', 'offer', 'something', 'film', 'not', 'seen', 'classic', 'shorts', 'genuine', 'pathos', 'character', 'particularly', 'when', 'tell', 'Snow', 'White', 'Prince', 'apparent', 'demise', 'when', 'find', 'body', 'had', 'bitten', 'apple', 'one', 'wonder', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Stooges', 'had', 'been', 'consistently', 'given', 'Grade', 'writing', 'direction', 'as', 'well', 'opportunity', 'stretch', 'acting', 'abilities', 'when', 'prime']",Snow White & Three Stooges VHS

If you're looking to be amused and entertained then press the play button, sit back and enjoy ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"" in color. The final version of the Three Stooges tries to put a stooge spin on a classic old tale. In my opinion they did a very good job with their acting and the movie was just as I remembered seeing as a kid.In this movie the Three Stooges are more serious than funny as the violence between them is toned down, but there are still some laughs to be had throughout the movie. For stooge fans that have never seen this movie its live action and Snow White is played by Carol Heiss, the 1960 Olympic figure skating champion. Prince Charming is played by Edson Stroll. The Wicked Queen/Witch is played by Patricia Medina and she does a fantastic job and probably the best acting in the movie. The Queens henchman Count Oga is played by Guy Rolfe and he meets his fate in boiling fashion. Filling in for the Seven Dwarfs are of course Moe, Larry and Curly Joe. This movie does contain some scenes that may frighten younger children but overall its harmless fun for the whole family.The video transfer is really decent; the sound is very good and it comes across nicely on my sound system. The disc contains both full and widescreen color versions and the Theatrical trailer. It definitely wasn't one of their best films, but it still managed to entertain me on a lazy afternoon.

In the same vein as Sonja Henie, movie producers tried to make a star out of her.  The fact that Hiess never made another film should tell you all you need to know about her acting ability.  The stooges, Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe DeRita replace the Seven Dwarfs but their severly watered down and tamed act can't save this flick from being a sappy mess.  Curly Joe actually gets a few funny scenes, especially when he wishes the wicked with would go to ""hades"" but the Stooges keep the slaps to a bare minimum.  Edson Stroll as Prince Charming was a good looking guy and would go onto play in McHale's Navy as Virgil Edwards.Because heiss couldn't act we get some scenes thrown in where she just skates a bit that are out of place in what is supposed to be a fairy tale.  But the fact that the producers and directed made Heiss the focus and put the Stooges in the background instead of the other way around damages what could have been a somewhat funny film, even for Stooges who were now well past their prime.  There's some decent songs and the film looks good.  The makeup on the queen when she transforms herself into the old hag is very good.  But that's hardly enough to save the film.
