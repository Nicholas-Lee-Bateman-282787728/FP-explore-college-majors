It provides the viewer with a clear picture of satan's destruction in a person's life, as the scripture says &#34; the thief cometh but to steal, kill, and destroy, but Jesus came that we might have life and that more abundantly.when Mr. Champion turned to GOD for his answers to the problems in his life, he received the GOD kind of turn around that only GOD could have given him and his family even in the midst of trials!In my opinion, this is a winner of a movie",5,Deep in the heart,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,504,"['am', 'still', 'impressed', 'movie', 'viewer', 'clear', 'picture', 'satan', 'destruction', 'person', 'life', 'scripture', '34', 'thief', 'cometh', 'steal', 'kill', 'destroy', 'Jesus', 'came', 'might', 'have', 'life', 'more', 'abundantly.when', 'Mr.', 'Champion', 'turned', 'GOD', 'answers', 'problems', 'life', 'received', 'GOD', 'kind', 'turn', 'around', 'only', 'GOD', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'family', 'even', 'midst', 'trials', 'opinion', 'winner', 'movie']",Deep in the Heart

I just can't imagine Jesus weighing in at over 300 lbs!!!Otherwise, this video was professionally done; near perfect editing, dialog and filming really professional.  It is such a good thing Christian movie-making has become professional instead of well-meaning church-goers who use their home video cameras to make a &#34;movie&#34;...I digress.........the acting is very natural and the actors all fit in with what they needed to do.  The movie is thought provoking and warms the heart.  Everything fit in it's place at the right time.  This is NOT a &#34;holy-roller&#34; film.  It is good Christian movie making and it is well done....Just don't expect Val to be in every frame..",4,Val was not the star of this thing................,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",2013,865,"['little', 'detail', 'when', 'watch', 'flick', 'very', 'good', 'flick', 'might', 'notice', 'camera', 'always', 'did', 'close-ups', 'Val.As', 'much', 'Val', 'wanted', 'look', 'Jesus', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'Jesus', 'weighing', '300', 'lbs', 'Otherwise', 'video', 'was', 'professionally', 'done', 'perfect', 'editing', 'dialog', 'filming', 'really', 'professional', 'such', 'good', 'thing', 'Christian', 'movie-making', 'become', 'professional', 'instead', 'well-meaning', 'church-goers', 'who', 'use', 'home', 'video', 'cameras', 'make', '34', 'movie', '34', 'digress', 'acting', 'very', 'natural', 'actors', 'fit', 'what', 'needed', 'do', 'movie', 'thought', 'provoking', 'heart', 'Everything', 'fit', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'NOT', '34', 'holy-roller', '34', 'film', 'good', 'Christian', 'movie', 'making', 'well', 'done', '.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Val', 'be', 'frame..']",Deep in the Heart
