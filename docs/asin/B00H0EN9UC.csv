Jeepers Creepers is at the top of my all time favorite horror films. Also, nice to know the 3rd is in the making. I wish he would hurry up with that one :(. This film reminds me a little ofWrong Turn. It has all I need in a B movie. Tobin Bell (Saw), creepy house, and a partly original story. It isn't cheaply made with a handheld either. I would say the budget was somewhere in the millions. Though the acting isn't the greatest ever, it made me a little uneasy at times and wonder what would happen next. The ending wasn't as great. I felt like it was a little ridiculous. The lead actor Luke Kleintank did ok as the person who is able to see someones death if he touches their skin. It consists of him and others searching for answers about his father and a house he has been drawing for years. Well he finds the house and it's pretty action packed from then on. His father is actually someone ridiculous. Wont say more because it would ruin the film. All around good movie with great action. It's not really scary in the jump out of your seat kind of way. It's more of a backwoods Wrong Turn kind of terror.",4,Interesting premise,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,1496,"['Plot', 'ImdbWhen', 'Nick', 'Di', 'Santo', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'alive', 'can', 'possibly', 'reveal', 'origin', 'son', 'dark', 'gift', 'out', 'trip', 'abandoned', 'mansion', 'thought', 'only', 'existed', 'childhood', 'imaginationReview', '4/5I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'going', 'seen', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'director', 'ofJeepers', 'Creepers', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', '2', 'was', 'helm', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'top', 'time', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'Also', 'nice', 'know', '3rd', 'making', 'wish', 'would', 'hurry', 'up', 'one', 'film', 'little', 'ofWrong', 'Turn', 'need', 'B', 'movie', 'Tobin', 'Bell', 'Saw', 'creepy', 'house', 'partly', 'original', 'story', ""n't"", 'cheaply', 'made', 'handheld', 'either', 'would', 'say', 'budget', 'was', 'somewhere', 'millions', 'acting', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'ever', 'made', 'little', 'uneasy', 'times', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'next', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'felt', 'was', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'lead', 'actor', 'Luke', 'Kleintank', 'did', 'ok', 'person', 'who', 'able', 'see', 'someones', 'death', 'skin', 'others', 'searching', 'answers', 'father', 'house', 'been', 'drawing', 'years', 'Well', 'house', 'pretty', 'action', 'packed', 'then', 'father', 'actually', 'someone', 'ridiculous', 'Wont', 'say', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'film', 'around', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'jump', 'seat', 'kind', 'way', 'more', 'backwoods', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'kind', 'terror']",N/A
1682993,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00H0EN9UC,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[2, 3]","I didn't expect anything near what I got. This film doesn't shy away from injecting fantasy and eschewing reality, so if you need things situated firmly in the laws of physics (the known ones anyway), then this probably won't be for you. If you have no trouble with suspending disbelief, then carry on. I am a sucker for demonic themed flicks, especially apocalyptic ones, and I so did not see that coming. The actors were competent and pulled off their respective roles, in appearing believable in a fantastical situation. I loved &#34;Seth&#34; and his hunchbacks. The latter gave me some good laughs. Overall, I am very pleased with the creativity shown here and wish I could see more like that. The story was intriguing and fun trying to decipher the clues, which were eventually all explained. I liked the 'next generation' ending and I would not mind revisiting the Dark House again, if a sequel was planned.",5,"Horror Junkie's Review: A 4.5 rounded up for creativity, a fun  yarn pretty well executed in these dark days for horror fans",1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,914,"['did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'what', 'got', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'injecting', 'fantasy', 'eschewing', 'reality', 'so', 'need', 'things', 'situated', 'firmly', 'laws', 'physics', 'known', 'ones', 'anyway', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'have', 'trouble', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'then', 'carry', 'am', 'sucker', 'demonic', 'themed', 'flicks', 'especially', 'apocalyptic', 'ones', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'actors', 'were', 'competent', 'pulled', 'off', 'respective', 'roles', 'appearing', 'believable', 'fantastical', 'situation', 'loved', '34', 'Seth', '34', 'hunchbacks', 'latter', 'gave', 'good', 'laughs', 'Overall', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'creativity', 'shown', 'here', 'wish', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'intriguing', 'fun', 'trying', 'decipher', 'clues', 'were', 'eventually', 'explained', 'liked', ""'next"", 'generation', 'ending', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'revisiting', 'Dark', 'House', 'again', 'sequel', 'was', 'planned']",N/A

It was really good - I so enjoyed the entire film...the story, the actors, the scenery, the gore, the blood, the jump out of my seat & screams.I have changed my previous review which I listed as a warning when this movie was first released - this movie was actually good, really good. My only question came at the ending, which was abrupt and left me with some unanswered questions on what actually happened.

The special effects were pathetic, the overall plot is recycled and poorly executed, and overall, there is just very little here to warrant a viewing by even the most lenient of fans of the horror genre.

I have not seen that one, but I would wager the plot lines are drastically different.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect going into this one because I had not heard any buzz about it, especially since Tobin Bell was involved.  But I&#8217;m happy to report it&#8217;s a heck of a film with a unique story, good acting, and some great special effects.Curiously, I&#8217;ve read a few negative reviews about this film where the reviewer stated he/she didn&#8217;t understand the film.  I&#8217;m stunned to hear this, as I thought the plot line was easy to follow.  Not to mention, it is clever and intelligent, a nice change of pace from the traditional house-in-the-woods concept.DARK HOUSE looks good and has a pretty decent production budget.  The production team does a nice job of fleshing out details in this film, especially when it comes to the house itself.  I like the location chosen, and the architecture of the structure is certainly menacing in its own right.I enjoyed the acting in the film as well.  Tobin Bell never disappoints, and the rest of the cast does a good job overall.  I particularly like Luke Kleintank in the lead as Nick.  He brings a realistic depth to his role, and his chemistry with Alex McKenna (who portrays his girlfriend Eve) is very believable.My sole complaint about the movie is that the ending seems a bit forced.  **SPOILER ALERT**  When Eve and Ryan find Nick in the house at the end, we are never shown nor told what happened when Nick went into the basement.  There&#8217;s a lot of assumption that is made (or at least there was on my part), so I feel the ending could have been fleshed out more.Still, DARK HOUSE has a nice punch as a horror flick, and I do recommend it.

It was cool, graphics were not SYFY cheap graphics done with cameras... it was scary, and a bit freaky but the end told you the story. I cannot imagine any horror fan not liking this its from the guy who gave us Jeepers Creepers and the first SAW. It was well acted and just had a creepy feel to it. I liked it as much as I did Conjuring. Though the subject matter was completely different. I do not believe you will find a better film. Most are using hand held cams I wouldn't sit through one of those... others are using all teen cast who can't act to save their lives... and if the actor can't act how do they expect anyone to be literally pulled into the film as if they were part of it... that's why so many films fail and whined up on that SYFY channel replaying movies over and frigging over until you lose your mind and don't even know what day it is.
