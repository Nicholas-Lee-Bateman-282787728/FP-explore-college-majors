61435,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,0783229151,DarthJustice,"[4, 4]","Career Opportunities I first discovered on television one late night years ago in the 90s. After recently remembering it, I knew I had to buy it and see it again. So how did it stand up for my second viewing, and the first in over a decade?I enjoyed it. Isn't that enough for any movie?Seriously, what we have here is a movie about a 20-something year old guy named Jim. Jim is someone who compulsively lies, not out of hurtful spite but of esteem building exaggeration. It's also implied (or perhaps stated in not so many words) that Jim has monophobia, the fear of being alone. Enter Jennifer Connelly's character, Josie, who is the daughter of the town's wealthiest man. Like true John Hughes form, Josie is very unhappy with her father and living with him.After being fired, Jim gets a job as a janitor at the local Target. However, he soon discovers a job detail not discussed--having to clean up the store after hours where he must stay in the store all night alone. Josie, meanwhile in an effort to embarrass her father, nearly decides to shoplift and get caught but decides otherwise and falls asleep in the dressing room.Much of the movie is spent with the two characters, who went to school together their entire lives, truly getting to know each other and falling in love.That, and dealing with a pair of crooks who decide to break into Target.All in all, Career Opportunities is a fun watch when in a light-hearted kind of mood. It's not the type of movie to watch to get into some serious thought. But it's definitely a fun movie to pop in every so often.

However, this is a John Hughes comedy, and he has this indescribable appeal in all his movies . . . this film is very corny and cliche-ridden, but it is self-aware of all its cheesy jokes!  Because of this, it is a highly-enjoyable piece of popcorn fluff, as only John Hughes (&quot;the master of watchable teen flicks&quot;) could write 'em.The plot is simple: a 21-year-old guy, who happes to be the town liar, can't seem to find a job anywhere.  He lives at home with his parents, who have just about had it with their son's laziness and innability to keep a steady income for more than three weeks.  So, in a desperate move, his dad gets him a position at. . . . . . none other than. . . . Target!  But there's just one problem: he's the night shift pick-up boy.  So, locked in at 7:00, he tends to his chores, and then begins to do some hysterical time-passers.  Little does he know it, however, that he was also locked in accidentally with the town beauty (the gorgeous Jennifer Connely).  The two slowly become friends as the night passes; until two &quot;Home Alone&quot;-esque thieves attempt to rob the store.The ending is somehow disappointing, but hey, it was never that great of a movie to begin with.  Now, don't get me wrong, it has its funny attributes to it (heck, at times it's downright side-splitting).  But one can easily tell who its main audience was meant to be (teenage boys).  Jennifer Connely is constantly showing off her glamour and good looks; the overlong close-ups of her face, and the dancing &amp; rollerskating scenes give it all away.  But, Jennifer Connelly was (and still is) hot-as-hell, and her showing off of her body gives the movie many of its high points, especially when she's distrating the thieves  (just watch the scene with her riding the nickle-ride horse to see what I mean).Now, some may call it slow and boring.  But I think that's part of what makes John Hughes such a great filmmaker: he's not afraid to move at a steady pace, like far too many films these days are.

When forced by his father to get a job or get lost, Whaley gets a job at the local Target store working  the midnight shift as the store janitor. There, he encounters Josie  (Connelly), the daughter of the richest man in town, who is hiding out in  the store past closing hours.The relationship between Whaley and  Connelly develops, and they discover each other's strengths and faults.  When two burglars break into the store to rob it blind, Whaley and Connelly  must play it cool in order to stop them. However, the beautiful Connelly  only leads all three guys into further trouble due to lust.Written by  the great John Hughes, &quot;Career Opportunities,&quot; is somewhat like a  &quot;Home Alone&quot; for teens. Hughes, who has written similar stories  in the past (e.g. &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; &amp; &quot;Some Kind of  Wonderful&quot; have the same premise) does a good job in illustrating life  in a small town (suprisingly it does not take place in Shermer, Illinois,  the fictional town Hughes has used in his past films).While the film  starts to slow down after the discovery of the two burglars, the film ends  happily, justice served and all. The transfer to DVD is great. The only  NEGATIVE thing about the DVD version is the fact that there is no  theatrical trailer included on the disc, even though the packaging states  that there is. Whether an act of false advertising or a company error, this  leaves the owner short of all expectations we expect when we buy films in  this great format.If you are in the mood for a cute comedy involving a  geeky hero and a beautiful girl, this is the perfect film for you. Keep an  eye out for Dermot Mulroney (Julia Robert's &quot;best friend&quot; in  &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot;) as one the scruffy burglars (the  other burglar is played by Dermot's real-life brother, Kieran).

61450,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,0783229151,Muzzlehatch,"[2, 2]","The lame old joke goes that you watch this movie for two reasons - both well in evidence in the box cover reproduced here, right above Frank Whaley's head.  For some reason I own this John Hughes-written, Bryan Gordon-directed flick, but I'd never watched it all the way through.  I remember when it came out on video, working in the video store and having a Connelly-crazed coworker who had to put it on all the time, and getting so irritated by the soundtrack and the just plain stupid music-video feel of the thing that I vowed I'd never watch it straight through - despite my own attraction to Ms. Connelly's...uhh...talents.Well, it's not actually as bad as I feared.  Bad, yes - particularly the beginning 20 minutes and a similar chunk at the ending.  I don't know if it's Frank Whaley's Jim Dodge character that is incredibly annoying, or Whaley himself, and I don't know if Hughes wanted him to seem AS annoying as he is - probably not.  He's a 21-year-old compulsive liar always talking himself up who still lives at home in a small town somewhere near St. Louis who ends up in a night clean-up job at Target - after being fired from innumerable other positions.  One thing I found particularly irritating was that the guy seems to belong to a completely different family than the one he is actually a part of - his speech, his intellectual pretensions, just don't jibe.  Not that such things don't happen, but it's played entirely for laughs here and is never remotely convincing.The humor, in fact - this is supposed to be a ""comedy"" after all - is what doesn't work, and surprisingly what really does succeed is the sentimental element that comes into place when Dodge finds that Connelly's rich-girl character Josie McClellan is locked in with him, and starts to bond with her over their mutual dissatisfactions with life.  Here in the central part of the film we get to see Jim's egotistical bluster fade away and Josie starts to appear as something more than an object of desire.  And the dialogue about hopes and aspirations here is actually some of Hughes' better work I think - both Whaley and Connelly seem more natural and at ease during this section, and for a few moments the film starts to approach the kind of feeling that we find in THE BREAKFAST CLUB.Alas it doesn't stay on that level for long, and a subplot about a couple of incompetent (yet supposedly vicious) criminals (Dermot and Kieran Mulroney) that break into the store and threaten the kids is played entirely for broad laughs, and very poorly at that.  And Connelly's many cleavage shots and the infamous scene of her riding a coin-op horse really get to be obnoxious and borderline offensive by the end - which is entierly predictable if even more poorly staged than I would have guessed.If you're  watching this because of fantasies about the young Jennifer Connelly then - well, I guess it might be worth it.  And if  you find the typical John Hughes adolescent/young male arrogance and snottiness - think of Jim Dodge as a just slightly older Ferris Bueller from the sticks - more bearable than I do, you'll probably like this.

61451,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,0783229151,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[4, 5]","The comedic story of two people locked overnight in a department store, one of them being Jennifer Connelly and the other being, obviously, one of the luckiest guys in the world.  They end up encountering some rather incompetent would-be robbers in the process.  Underneath the surface there are some kind of dark hints though.  Connelly's character is in the store hoping to get caught shoplifting in order to embarrass her rich but scummy father.  He's apparantly quite controlling and verbally abusive of her, and it's even implied that it might go far beyond that.  The movie never really gets into that possibility beyond a glimmer, because it's chosen to be a fun, endearing romantic fantasy rather than a dark and disturbing drama, but the hint does add an extra dimension.I think I'd prefer to think that the father is just an immense creep and not something far worse, because while that path could have made a really good drama, I like the really good comedy we got instead.  People complain that this isn't serious; but it's a romance and where is it written that romances have to be all somber, stone-faced serious all the time?  This romance is chipper, at times endearingly goofy, and wonderful fun, as the two leads (Jennifer and male co-star Frank Whaley) fall in love over the space of an evening.  Cynics will scoff at that too, but good grief if you can't believe that something so cool could happen in one night in the movies, what hope do people have of love striking like lightening in real life?  Not to mention the pluses of scenes like Jennifer riding the store's coin-opreated mechanical horse (with, happily, the inevitable bounce) or the fact that hearing her giggle is worth buying the movie alone.Now that Connelly has finally received her rightful acclaim thanks to her recent movies, alot of people have dismissed her earlier stuff.  To me, all through her career she's been brilliant.  She's shined in the dramas everybody knows about (and a few that have slipped through the cracks, like ""Seven Minutes In Heaven"", one of her alltime best), she's shined in horror (""Phenomena"", aka ""Creepers""), she's shined in action/adventure like ""The Rocketeer"" and she's shined in comedies like ""Career Opportunities"".  This diversity makes her one of moviedom's most valuable performers.I don't mean to ignore the other performers; they all did fine jobs, but Jennifer was the main draw for me.  Besides, I just don't think Whaley or the bumbling robbers would have looked quite as good in that white halter top.As good as it is, it missed some opportunities to be significantly better, so it's refined to a strong four stars.  The script was pretty minimal, and there were missed opportuities for humor, but the cast have made what they have work splendidly, and I fully recommend it.  If you like this kind of comedic romantic fantasy fun, I also recommend the 2 ""Mannequin"" movies, the charming and enchanting ""Amelie"" and the heartpoundingly sexy ""Dream Trap"".",4,Endearingly Silly Comedy With Some Subtle Weight,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",2004,2987,"['comedic', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'locked', 'overnight', 'department', 'store', 'one', 'being', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'other', 'being', 'obviously', 'one', 'luckiest', 'guys', 'world', 'end', 'up', 'encountering', 'rather', 'incompetent', 'would-be', 'robbers', 'process', 'surface', 'are', 'kind', 'dark', 'hints', 'Connelly', 'character', 'store', 'hoping', 'get', 'caught', 'shoplifting', 'order', 'embarrass', 'rich', 'scummy', 'father', 'apparantly', 'quite', 'controlling', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'even', 'implied', 'might', 'go', 'far', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'possibility', 'glimmer', 'chosen', 'be', 'fun', 'endearing', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'drama', 'hint', 'add', 'extra', 'dimension.I', 'think', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'think', 'father', 'just', 'immense', 'creep', 'not', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'path', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'good', 'drama', 'like', 'really', 'good', 'comedy', 'got', 'instead', 'People', 'complain', ""n't"", 'serious', 'romance', 'where', 'written', 'romances', 'have', 'be', 'somber', 'stone-faced', 'serious', 'time', 'romance', 'chipper', 'times', 'endearingly', 'goofy', 'wonderful', 'fun', 'two', 'leads', 'Jennifer', 'male', 'co-star', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'fall', 'love', 'space', 'evening', 'Cynics', 'will', 'scoff', 'too', 'good', 'grief', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'something', 'so', 'cool', 'could', 'happen', 'one', 'night', 'movies', 'what', 'hope', 'do', 'people', 'have', 'love', 'striking', 'lightening', 'real', 'life', 'Not', 'mention', 'pluses', 'scenes', 'Jennifer', 'riding', 'store', 'coin-opreated', 'mechanical', 'horse', 'happily', 'inevitable', 'bounce', 'fact', 'hearing', 'giggle', 'worth', 'buying', 'movie', 'alone.Now', 'Connelly', 'finally', 'received', 'rightful', 'acclaim', 'thanks', 'recent', 'movies', 'alot', 'people', 'have', 'dismissed', 'earlier', 'stuff', 'career', 'been', 'brilliant', 'shined', 'dramas', 'everybody', 'few', 'have', 'slipped', 'cracks', 'Seven', 'Minutes', 'Heaven', 'one', 'alltime', 'best', 'shined', 'horror', 'Phenomena', 'Creepers', 'shined', 'action/adventure', 'Rocketeer', 'shined', 'comedies', 'Career', 'Opportunities', 'diversity', 'one', 'moviedom', 'most', 'valuable', 'performers.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ignore', 'other', 'performers', 'did', 'fine', 'jobs', 'Jennifer', 'was', 'main', 'draw', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Whaley', 'bumbling', 'robbers', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'white', 'halter', 'top.As', 'good', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'be', 'significantly', 'better', 'refined', 'strong', 'four', 'stars', 'script', 'was', 'pretty', 'minimal', 'were', 'missed', 'opportuities', 'humor', 'cast', 'have', 'made', 'what', 'have', 'work', 'splendidly', 'fully', 'recommend', 'like', 'kind', 'comedic', 'romantic', 'fantasy', 'fun', 'also', 'recommend', '2', 'Mannequin', 'movies', 'charming', 'enchanting', 'Amelie', 'heartpoundingly', 'sexy', 'Dream', 'Trap']",N/A
