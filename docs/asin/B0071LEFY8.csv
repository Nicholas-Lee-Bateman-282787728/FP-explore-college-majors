Will and Grell are too cute.But forcing myself to see past that, the story was pretty impressive too! I liked that it was short and sweet, but really said a lot about both the reapers and their job as a whole. I was impressed with how much we got to learn about the shinigami life in such a short time. Definitely worth watching. I re-watch it for multiple reasons: the story is great and I love the characters.And my one complaint (which doesn't take away from the quality of this) is that Grell used to be so much more assertive, I suppose, than he is now.

Just in case people wonder why this is so much more expensive than the $30, its because this particular set comes with a large box that is capable of holding both season one and season two. It even comes with a decorative cardboard filler to hold the second season in place without the first season.The series its self is wonderful as always, beautiful picture, sound and amazing storyline. The 'Making of Black Butler II' OVA sums it up: Stunning visuals, amazing battle scenes, combined with the beautiful cruelty of its storyline. It honestly is as amazing as the first season.It varies from the manga, I promise you that, but then again, so does season one. This, however, is one such beautiful creation that  I believe holds true to the theme of Black Butler, and still is quite researched and detailed on that time in ways that still amaze me. This is one such beautiful gem that you should get and keep in your collection just because it is beautiful and worth watching over and over, no matter how it varies (for those who adore the manga). Most animes that veer from the manga become shoddy and less detailed, losing the feeling the author intended. Both seasons of this, however, are so beautifully detailed that I was shocked that the manga was different.All-in-all, this is a beautiful series, and if you don't mind that its different from the manga, just as I don't, this is an amazing buy!",5,Awesome Box Set,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1427,"['awesome', 'set', 'Just', 'case', 'people', 'wonder', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'expensive', '30', 'particular', 'set', 'large', 'box', 'capable', 'holding', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'even', 'decorative', 'cardboard', 'filler', 'hold', 'second', 'season', 'place', 'first', 'season.The', 'series', 'self', 'wonderful', 'always', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'sound', 'amazing', 'storyline', ""'Making"", 'Black', 'Butler', 'II', 'OVA', 'sums', 'up', 'Stunning', 'visuals', 'amazing', 'battle', 'scenes', 'combined', 'beautiful', 'cruelty', 'storyline', 'honestly', 'as', 'amazing', 'first', 'season.It', 'varies', 'manga', 'promise', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'season', 'one', 'however', 'one', 'such', 'beautiful', 'creation', 'believe', 'true', 'theme', 'Black', 'Butler', 'still', 'quite', 'researched', 'detailed', 'time', 'ways', 'still', 'one', 'such', 'beautiful', 'gem', 'should', 'get', 'keep', 'collection', 'just', 'beautiful', 'worth', 'watching', 'matter', 'how', 'who', 'adore', 'manga', 'Most', 'animes', 'veer', 'manga', 'become', 'shoddy', 'less', 'detailed', 'losing', 'feeling', 'author', 'intended', 'seasons', 'however', 'are', 'so', 'beautifully', 'detailed', 'was', 'shocked', 'manga', 'was', 'different.All-in-all', 'beautiful', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'different', 'manga', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'buy']",Black Butler: Complete 2nd Season

Firstly even after being aware of Japanese culture to a certain degree and being a fan of many aspects of Japanese entertainment I'm still left wondering what the writer of the manga intended. Are people really satanic? or is this just a theme used for entertainment? I find this entertaining but it's quite bizarre and obviously occult and esoterically themed. This second season starts off very enigmatically and left me cold at first since there was seemingly no continuity whatsoever following the end of the first season, but without going into any possible spoilers it all makes sense roughly half way through this second season's episodes.I've yet to watch all the 'bonus' type fan service episodes but they are great so far.

The interchange between Sebastian Michaelis and Claude is exhilarating. They are both demons, they are both scorchingly desirable. It's a fun little game to play as to which one is better looking. Sebastian is loyal and witty but Claude is dark and draconian. Sebastian has red eyes and Claude has golden eyes. Then of course there is the series finale which thrills in its own special way. All the while during the buildup you're asking yourself the question as to how they could possibly end such a fantastic storyline. And without giving anything away I'll just tell you that I was vastly pleased with the ending. It resolved everything but also somehow left it open and unending.

1524078,A2BFPQT4UQ9DKI,B0071LEFY8,Jason C. Ditz,"[36, 39]","The first series of Black Butler was a fascinating story, involving some very dark comedy, some downright weird historical anachronisms, and some nice interplay between the characters. Little girl Queen Victoria and crazy angels and a ""New London Bridge"" being constructed of human souls. It was just a fun watch from start to finish.The second series is by no means bad, and I did enjoy it, but the introduction of Alois Trancy (which ended up being the whole storyline) was really uncomfortable. It took all the weird molestation undertones that Sebastian-Ciel's relationship had (buried behind a ""demon devouring a soul"" motif) and brought it really far out into the open. Alois is damaged goods from the ground up, he's literally molested by his adopted father and he's got his own father-figure demon to devour his soul, just like Ciel does. But where Ciel comes off as vulnerable (and desperate to hide it), resigned to relying on Sebastian even with the knowledge that the ""devouring"" is coming sooner or later, Alois is cruel, and seems to relish his fate, and flies off the handle when his own demon decides he'd rather ""devour"" someone else.Overall the second series is good, and if you're a huge fan of the first you won't be sorry you watched it. Some of the bonus OVAs included are also tremendously fun.
