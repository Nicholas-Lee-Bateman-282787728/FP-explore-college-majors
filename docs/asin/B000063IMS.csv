694941,A1RGN7M6P3HI98,B000063IMS,A. Alfred,"[3, 6]","A few points to clear up.  Spriggan is based on a manga release in Japan titled Striker.  The movie IS NOT a manga to film adaptation, but a completely different story all together.  So if after watching Spriggan you want kinda a new story to follow, getting the manga will be a good step. There has been so much hype surrounding this movie's release from the explosive trailers that were released for it.  Many people were expected one thing, but felt they got another.  Well folks, YOU GOT WHAT YOU SEEN!!!Animation:  The Animation here is superb.  The fight scenes were so well choreographed they almost seemed real.  There were many nice camera techniques used here to keep pace with the explosive filled action sequences that worked very well.  But as for anything ground breaking, Spriggan offered little to new innovation.  You'd find all that you seen here in many other anime series.Characters:  I think you'd have to read the manga to get a feel for the characters because there is really no character development here.  It simply follows the Good guy versus bad guy motif throughout the whole movie.  Yeah there were some solemn parts of Yui's past, but other than that, there seems to have been nothing more offered.  What you see is what ya got.  As for interesting Characters?  Well, we've seen these types all before.  There seemed not to have been anything really unique.  But boy did the action sequences make up for all of it.Story (Don't worry, no real spoilers):  The story revolves around the discovery of Noah's ark deep in the Antarctic.  A power struggle ensues between two organizations; one fighting to keep the Ark's secrets secret and another wanting to unleash the power of it's true use.  Special agents known as Spriggans are dispatched to fight for the Ark and prevent it from being opened. The story is verrry good.  I would say above all criticism, the story makes up for it all.  But after watching it you will get the feeling that so much more could have been done with this.  More could have been added to the story that would have made it more unique.  But alas, it fell short, not offering anything further.  The movie seemed too rushed.  You'd be left scratching your head about 5 minutes into it cause things just happen too fast.Conclusion:  There seemed to have been one problem with this movie...  There were some points in the film were the characters voices would go from normal to faint for no reason at all.  And no, it wasn't a DVD malfunction.  This was actually found in the final product.  This aspect was what really turned me off.  There were times I could swear the characters mouths were moving but nothing would come up.  Sometimes you'd kinda have to put your ear to the TV to get the line.  Don't think about putting on the Subtitles to get those missed lines.  They're translation is so far off from what is really being said you'd think your viewing another movie.  But fortunately, these audio mishaps don't occur throughout the whole film.  I would say you'd encounter this about five times.  It's just that these five times are at the heart of the movie.  But overall, Spriggan is a good movie to maybe rent and check out.  I predict you'll have a good experience with this film.  Just make sure to put your volume up.",3,Spriggan Delivers but.......,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",2002,3282,"['few', 'points', 'clear', 'up', 'Spriggan', 'based', 'manga', 'release', 'Japan', 'titled', 'Striker', 'movie', 'NOT', 'manga', 'film', 'adaptation', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'together', 'So', 'watching', 'Spriggan', 'want', 'kinda', 'new', 'story', 'follow', 'getting', 'manga', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'step', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movie', 'release', 'explosive', 'trailers', 'were', 'released', 'Many', 'people', 'were', 'expected', 'one', 'thing', 'felt', 'got', 'Well', 'folks', 'YOU', 'GOT', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'SEEN', 'Animation', 'Animation', 'here', 'superb', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'choreographed', 'almost', 'seemed', 'real', 'were', 'many', 'nice', 'camera', 'techniques', 'used', 'here', 'keep', 'pace', 'explosive', 'filled', 'action', 'sequences', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'anything', 'ground', 'breaking', 'Spriggan', 'offered', 'little', 'new', 'innovation', ""'d"", 'find', 'seen', 'here', 'many', 'other', 'anime', 'series.Characters', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'read', 'manga', 'get', 'feel', 'characters', 'really', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'simply', 'Good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'motif', 'whole', 'movie', 'were', 'solemn', 'parts', 'Yui', 'past', 'other', 'have', 'been', 'nothing', 'more', 'offered', 'What', 'see', 'what', 'ya', 'got', 'interesting', 'Characters', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'types', 'before', 'seemed', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'really', 'unique', 'boy', 'did', 'action', 'sequences', 'make', 'up', 'it.Story', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'real', 'spoilers', 'story', 'discovery', 'Noah', 'ark', 'deep', 'Antarctic', 'power', 'struggle', 'ensues', 'two', 'organizations', 'one', 'fighting', 'keep', 'Ark', 'secrets', 'secret', 'wanting', 'unleash', 'power', 'true', 'use', 'Special', 'agents', 'known', 'Spriggans', 'are', 'dispatched', 'fight', 'Ark', 'prevent', 'being', 'opened', 'story', 'verrry', 'good', 'would', 'say', 'criticism', 'story', 'up', 'watching', 'will', 'get', 'feeling', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'More', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'unique', 'alas', 'fell', 'short', 'not', 'offering', 'anything', 'further', 'movie', 'seemed', 'too', 'rushed', ""'d"", 'be', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', '5', 'minutes', 'cause', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'too', 'fast.Conclusion', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'problem', 'movie', 'were', 'points', 'film', 'were', 'characters', 'voices', 'would', 'go', 'normal', 'faint', 'reason', 'was', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'malfunction', 'was', 'actually', 'found', 'final', 'product', 'aspect', 'was', 'what', 'really', 'turned', 'off', 'were', 'times', 'could', 'swear', 'characters', 'mouths', 'were', 'moving', 'nothing', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'Sometimes', ""'d"", 'kinda', 'have', 'put', 'ear', 'TV', 'get', 'line', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'putting', 'Subtitles', 'get', 'missed', 'lines', ""'re"", 'translation', 'so', 'far', 'what', 'really', 'being', 'said', ""'d"", 'think', 'viewing', 'movie', 'fortunately', 'audio', 'mishaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'occur', 'whole', 'film', 'would', 'say', ""'d"", 'encounter', 'five', 'times', 'just', 'five', 'times', 'are', 'heart', 'movie', 'overall', 'Spriggan', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'rent', 'check', 'out', 'predict', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'experience', 'film', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'put', 'volume', 'up']",Spriggan

694943,A3O6E41H4V1TMN,B000063IMS,A&M Junkie,"[3, 5]","""Spriggan"" is one of the most action-packed anime movies I have seen. After initially reading the story and reviews I was expecting to watch a muscle-bound man in an action packed no-brainer movie. However, I was delighted to discover that the main character Yu is similar in age and looks to Souske Sagara from Full Metal Panic - a good looking teenage Japanese guy. The fact that both character have the same voice actor - Chris Patton - and both work for secret military international agencies only adds to this similarity.  So for all you Full Metal Panic fans out there, this may be the closest to a serious movie along the lines of FMP that you are going to get.The storyline: Two rival military secret agencies are both trying to claim an archaeology find in Turkey - Noah's Ark and to discover the secret that lies within. Of course this being anime - human experimentation, psychic children, and mechanical/human hybrids - also feature.The action is non-stop but is also vitally important to the storyline. The soundtrack and dubbing are excellent and the graphics are similar to Cowboy Beebop: The movie. It is only upon the second viewing that you get to fully appreciate the level of detail the creators have put in their background scenery and action pieces. After I finished the movie I have to admit that I was disappointed - but only because it had ended. Why was this never carried on and made into a proper series? It has so much promise that you will also be dying to follow Yu on his next assignment. Recommended if you enjoyed Akira or Full Metal Panic or simply a good action-packed movie.",4,Action-packed movie,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1611,"['Spriggan', 'one', 'most', 'action-packed', 'anime', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'initially', 'reading', 'story', 'reviews', 'was', 'expecting', 'watch', 'muscle-bound', 'man', 'action', 'packed', 'no-brainer', 'movie', 'However', 'was', 'delighted', 'discover', 'main', 'character', 'Yu', 'similar', 'age', 'Souske', 'Sagara', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'good', 'looking', 'teenage', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'fact', 'character', 'have', 'same', 'voice', 'actor', 'Chris', 'Patton', 'work', 'secret', 'military', 'international', 'agencies', 'only', 'similarity', 'So', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'may', 'be', 'closest', 'serious', 'movie', 'lines', 'FMP', 'are', 'going', 'get.The', 'storyline', 'Two', 'rival', 'military', 'secret', 'agencies', 'are', 'trying', 'claim', 'archaeology', 'find', 'Turkey', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'discover', 'secret', 'course', 'being', 'anime', 'human', 'experimentation', 'psychic', 'children', 'mechanical/human', 'hybrids', 'also', 'feature.The', 'action', 'non-stop', 'also', 'vitally', 'important', 'storyline', 'soundtrack', 'dubbing', 'are', 'excellent', 'graphics', 'are', 'similar', 'Cowboy', 'Beebop', 'movie', 'only', 'second', 'viewing', 'get', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'level', 'detail', 'creators', 'have', 'put', 'background', 'scenery', 'action', 'pieces', 'finished', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'only', 'had', 'ended', 'Why', 'was', 'never', 'carried', 'made', 'proper', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'promise', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'dying', 'follow', 'Yu', 'next', 'assignment', 'Recommended', 'enjoyed', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'simply', 'good', 'action-packed', 'movie']",Spriggan
694944,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000063IMS,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[0, 2]","(MOVIE REVIEW)Spriggan, while definitely an entertaining movie, is not the deepest, though you won't think it after you hear what the movie is about. It's carried by its action, and there are times when characters are introduced solely to bring action into a scene (i.e. Jean when he first fights Little Boy). But as an action flick, this movie is excellent, and carries itself well using mostly the action, with very little in the way of plotting.The story is basically about two rival organizations: one is an American organization hell-bent on keeping America on top; the other is a world-wide organization meant to protect the world from potentially dangerous artifacts. At the core of this second group is an elite unit of warriors known as Spriggan, and Ominae Yu, who appears to be your everyday Japanese student, is one of their best. He's sent to Mt. Ararat in Turkey in order to help protect the recently discovered Noah's Ark. That's when the opposing organization makes their claim to the ancient artifact; so starts the endless scenes of great action. Yet during all of this, Col. MacDougal, a child-psychic, makes his way to and into the Ark, and seems to be the only one who knows the true purpose of the Ark. Is it a savior of man-kind, or a weapon of ultimate destruction? Either way, Ominae doesn't care. His job is to keep enemies away, and he goes about doing this as only he knows how.What's great about this movie is not just the action, but the excellent animation as well. Though a bit washed and chaotic at times, Katsuhiro Otomo's influence on the film is evident, with super-detailed scenes and settings, his own unique character styling, and his penchant for Akira-like violence. Without him working as supervisor, I'm sure this movie would have failed. So, with that said, I'd recommend Spriggan to people who enjoyed Akira and aren't too picky about deep plotting (like me). If you're like this, you may be one of the people who gives this movie five stars.(SOUNDTRACK REVIEW)For anyone familiar with the Spriggan movie, you know what to expect of this soundtrack: high-impact symphonic sounds, as well as some harmonic singing in the background, often with a quick, harsh tone. A lot of the songs are techno/hard rock mixes, with a few softer sounds. Only a couple have actual lyrics played along with the music, but in truth this is one CD that doesn't really need lyrics, as the songs very in tempo from moment to moment, stealing away some of the repetativeness that comes with intrumental music.The good thing about this CD is it has a huge track list (20 are listed on the back cover, but mine has 27, which I attained through the special edition movie). But the problem with this is that most of the songs sound the same. It's a good soundtrack, but not very well-rounded. Easily, the best song on the CD is ""Jing Lin,"" the opening track. Other good tracks are ""Drive in Istanbul,"" as it has the feeling as if it is being played right on the streets of Istanbul; ""Ararat"" is also well-done, and is the first real some to come along with a different sound than most of the other songs, and it constantly morphs into something different, from mysticism to techno to jazz.If you can get the Spriggan Special Edition, then I'd highly recommend you get the sound track this way. While it's a good soundtrack, it can be surpassed for others and isn't really worth the price tag on it.",4,Intense Action-Oriented Story,1138665600,"01 31, 2006",2006,3415,"['MOVIE', 'REVIEW', 'Spriggan', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'not', 'deepest', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'hear', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'carried', 'action', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'solely', 'bring', 'action', 'scene', 'i.e', 'Jean', 'when', 'first', 'Little', 'Boy', 'action', 'flick', 'movie', 'excellent', 'well', 'using', 'mostly', 'action', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'plotting.The', 'story', 'basically', 'about', 'two', 'rival', 'organizations', 'one', 'American', 'organization', 'hell-bent', 'keeping', 'America', 'top', 'other', 'world-wide', 'organization', 'meant', 'protect', 'world', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'artifacts', 'core', 'second', 'group', 'elite', 'unit', 'warriors', 'known', 'Spriggan', 'Ominae', 'Yu', 'who', 'be', 'everyday', 'Japanese', 'student', 'one', 'best', 'sent', 'Mt', 'Ararat', 'Turkey', 'order', 'help', 'protect', 'recently', 'discovered', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'when', 'opposing', 'organization', 'claim', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'endless', 'scenes', 'great', 'action', 'Col.', 'MacDougal', 'child-psychic', 'way', 'Ark', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'true', 'purpose', 'Ark', 'savior', 'man-kind', 'weapon', 'ultimate', 'destruction', 'way', 'Ominae', ""n't"", 'care', 'job', 'keep', 'enemies', 'away', 'doing', 'only', 'how.What', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'excellent', 'animation', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'washed', 'chaotic', 'times', 'Katsuhiro', 'Otomo', 'influence', 'film', 'evident', 'super-detailed', 'scenes', 'settings', 'own', 'unique', 'character', 'styling', 'penchant', 'Akira-like', 'violence', 'working', 'supervisor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'So', 'said', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Spriggan', 'people', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Akira', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'picky', 'deep', 'plotting', ""'re"", 'may', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'SOUNDTRACK', 'REVIEW', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'Spriggan', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'soundtrack', 'high-impact', 'symphonic', 'sounds', 'as', 'well', 'harmonic', 'singing', 'background', 'often', 'quick', 'harsh', 'tone', 'lot', 'songs', 'are', 'techno/hard', 'rock', 'mixes', 'few', 'softer', 'sounds', 'Only', 'couple', 'have', 'actual', 'lyrics', 'played', 'music', 'truth', 'one', 'CD', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'very', 'tempo', 'moment', 'moment', 'stealing', 'away', 'repetativeness', 'intrumental', 'music.The', 'good', 'thing', 'CD', 'huge', 'track', 'list', '20', 'are', 'listed', 'back', 'cover', 'mine', '27', 'attained', 'special', 'edition', 'movie', 'problem', 'most', 'songs', 'sound', 'same', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'very', 'well-rounded', 'Easily', 'best', 'song', 'CD', 'Jing', 'Lin', 'opening', 'track', 'Other', 'good', 'tracks', 'are', 'Drive', 'Istanbul', 'feeling', 'being', 'played', 'right', 'streets', 'Istanbul', 'Ararat', 'also', 'well-done', 'first', 'real', 'come', 'along', 'different', 'sound', 'most', 'other', 'songs', 'constantly', 'something', 'different', 'mysticism', 'techno', 'jazz.If', 'can', 'get', 'Spriggan', 'Special', 'Edition', 'then', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'sound', 'track', 'way', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'be', 'surpassed', 'others', ""n't"", 'really', 'worth', 'price', 'tag']",Spriggan

I am not dissapointed.Spriggan has an okay story and very good action.  It is also dubbed very well and the animation, while not world altering, is more than enough to get the idea across.  But Spriggan also is not all that it could be.When I watched it, I liked the action sequences but I felt that much of it was more borrowed from other anime than origional.  The hero is not unlike Jubei in Ninja Scroll or even the hero in Fist of the North Star.  However, unlike these other characters, this guy is not well defined or fleshed out.  The main villians also fall into some of the more stereotypical designs.  If you are a Anime fan, you will find yourself recognizing many of them.The ending battle was very good but also anti-climatic.  I guess I wanted a little more out of the final conclusion.  I half expected the main Spriggan (the hero) to whip out some even more hidden powers like Dragon Ball Z or even Neon Genesis Evangelion ( he does have hidden powers by the way...Just not what I expected).

One by the ADR director and engineer, the other by two of the English voice actors (Chris Patton and Kelly Manison).Without spoiling the anime for the curious, I will say that ""SPRIGGAN"" is definitely action oriented.The animation is very well done, the voice acting is very well done and the DTS soundtrack for the English version is awesome!  The video is 1:1:85 aspect ratio and anamorphic widescreen.As much as I love ""SPRIGGAN"", I feel that there are problems with this special edition release.The inclusion of the CD soundtrack for ""SPRIGGAN"" is great because the music for the film is awesome.  But there is a problem.Although the back of the CD soundtrack lists 20 tracks, there are actually 27 tracks and unfortunately the 7 remaining tracks are not listed.  No worry, if you were to put your CD in your computer, you can get the remaining track titles via CDDB.And for a major release, there's a typo on the DVD features listing.But the one thing that made me knock the rating down to a B+ from an A was that the original 2001 DVD release of ""SPRIGGAN"" featured really cool animated interactive menus, video portfolios of the character designs, vehicles and equipment, key backgrounds which are now all gone in this special edition release.Granted, for those who never purchased the 2001 release would probably never know but for those of us ""SPRIGGAN"" fans who do know, those special features from the original release was a major addition that really made the DVD a complete package and if included with the special edition, would have made it the ultimate.But all-in-all, aside from that, you still get a spankin' new look at ""SPRIGGAN"" with that DTS soundtrack.  It sounded great via digital 5.1 several years ago but sounds so awesome now.I highly recommend checking ""SPRIGGAN"" out!  The experience is definitely worth it!",5,THE FIGHT FOR HUMANITY BEGINS HERE!,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,3355,"['Back', '1998', 'SPRIGGAN', 'was', 'anime', 'hyped', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'based', 'very', 'successful', 'manga', 'series', 'course', 'people', 'SPRIGGAN', 'was', 'directed', 'first-time', 'director', 'Hirotsugu', 'Kawasaki', 'supervised', 'Katsuhiro', 'Otomo', 'creator', 'Akira', 'based', 'manga', 'Striker', 'Chu', 'Takasige', 'Ryoji', 'Minagawa', 'appeared', 'publication', 'Shonen', 'Sunday', '.Suffice', 'say', 'anime', 'made', 'headlines', 'when', 'was', 'major', 'bidding', 'war', 'rights', 'make', 'movie.With', 'Otomo', 'Kawasaki', 'helm', 'together', 'animators', 'Studio', '4C', 'SPRIGGAN', 'was', 'film', 'utilize', 'traditional', 'cel', 'animation', 'computer', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'significant', 'time.As', 'story', 'SPRIGGAN', 'athe', 'top', 'world', 'ancient', 'artifact', 'known', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'been', 'uncovered.It', 'said', 'artifact', 'keeper', 'status', 'god', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'eliminate', 'mankind', 'Earth', 'seconds.The', 'race', 'two', 'secret', 'organizations', 'go', 'battle', 'efforts', 'recover', 'lost', 'artifact', 'one', 'seeks', 'destroy', 'other', 'enslave', 'human', 'race', 'battle', 'half-human', 'cyborgs', 'secret', 'organization', 'known', 'ARCAM', 'elite', 'agents', 'Spriggan', 'epic', 'duel', 'future', 'humanity.The', 'original', 'DVD', 'release', 'SPRIGGAN', 'ADV', 'Films', 'was', 'back', '2001', '2005', 'special', 'edition', 'been', 'released', 'new', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'One', 'ADR', 'director', 'engineer', 'other', 'two', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Patton', 'Kelly', 'Manison', 'spoiling', 'anime', 'curious', 'will', 'say', 'SPRIGGAN', 'definitely', 'action', 'oriented.The', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'English', 'version', 'awesome', 'video', '1:1:85', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen.As', 'much', 'love', 'SPRIGGAN', 'feel', 'are', 'problems', 'special', 'edition', 'release.The', 'inclusion', 'CD', 'soundtrack', 'SPRIGGAN', 'great', 'music', 'film', 'awesome', 'back', 'CD', 'soundtrack', '20', 'tracks', 'are', 'actually', '27', 'tracks', 'unfortunately', '7', 'remaining', 'tracks', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'worry', 'were', 'put', 'CD', 'computer', 'can', 'get', 'remaining', 'track', 'titles', 'CDDB.And', 'major', 'release', 'typo', 'DVD', 'features', 'listing.But', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'knock', 'rating', 'down', 'B+', 'A', 'was', 'original', '2001', 'DVD', 'release', 'SPRIGGAN', 'featured', 'really', 'cool', 'animated', 'interactive', 'menus', 'video', 'portfolios', 'character', 'designs', 'vehicles', 'equipment', 'key', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'now', 'gone', 'special', 'edition', 'release.Granted', 'who', 'never', 'purchased', '2001', 'release', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'know', 'SPRIGGAN', 'fans', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'special', 'features', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'major', 'addition', 'really', 'made', 'DVD', 'complete', 'package', 'included', 'special', 'edition', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ultimate.But', 'all-in-all', 'aside', 'still', 'get', 'spankin', 'new', 'look', 'SPRIGGAN', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'sounded', 'great', 'digital', '5.1', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'awesome', 'now.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'SPRIGGAN', 'experience', 'definitely', 'worth']",Spriggan

Most compared it to Akira.Spriggan finally arrived to DVD in April and I was able to pass my own judgement upon it.Remember Akira? I thought it was a classic anime. However, after reading some of the manga, I quickly realized as good an anime as it was, a LOT of the story was condensed nd much compromising was made. Major characters took a complete backseat, some making mere cameos. For this reason, some don't look at the movie as well as they should.Well, Spriggan suffers from the same problem. This was also a Manga first, called Striker here in the US. I myself have had a chance to see it, and the story was greatly condensed as well.But don't let that keep you from getting this anime! The story, while quite light, is still present. However, I will admit that is not really the highlight of the movie. It's the action that takes center stage!Spriggan is an aboslutely exciting anime filled with many memorable fight scenes.The story revolves around Yu Ominae, a high-school student who is also a part of a top-secret organization known as ARCAM. When his friends begin to be killed off one by one, he goes off to Turkey in search of who is reponsible. What he finds is beyond comprehension, as he meets a group of half machine/half human beings bent on finding the secret behind Noah's Ark deep within Mount Ararat. In a desperate bid to stop their malevolent plans, Yu must fight against immeasurable odds.The fight scenes are absolutely sights to behold. The bullets fly, punches blaze through the air; the action gets crazy but never too hectic. The animation is top-notch and completely smooth.And the sound is a bonus as this film is filled with explosions and battle cries. The music, while probably not classic, has a couple memorable beats. &quot;Jing Ling,&quot; the ending theme, is extremely infectious and in fact, as I type, I am listening to it.The DVD menu itself is quite clean and I thought ADV did a good job. The extras tie up the package. Not the best I've seen, but certainly no the worst. Production sketches of vehicles and key locations and characters. My only gripe is of all the trailers to forget, they forgot to add Spriggan's!All in all, this DVD is worthy of a purchase and is excellent to show to friends just starting with anime, or just want some non-stop action!",5,A Riveting Action-Packed Anime!,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,2378,"['Spriggan', 'came', 'theatres', 'US', 'while', 'back', 'much', 'hype', 'Most', 'compared', 'Akira.Spriggan', 'finally', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'April', 'was', 'able', 'pass', 'own', 'judgement', 'it.Remember', 'Akira', 'thought', 'was', 'classic', 'anime', 'However', 'reading', 'manga', 'quickly', 'realized', 'good', 'anime', 'was', 'LOT', 'story', 'was', 'condensed', 'nd', 'much', 'compromising', 'was', 'made', 'Major', 'characters', 'took', 'complete', 'backseat', 'making', 'mere', 'cameos', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'should.Well', 'Spriggan', 'same', 'problem', 'was', 'also', 'Manga', 'first', 'called', 'Striker', 'here', 'US', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'story', 'was', 'greatly', 'condensed', 'well.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'keep', 'getting', 'anime', 'story', 'quite', 'light', 'still', 'present', 'However', 'will', 'admit', 'not', 'really', 'highlight', 'movie', 'action', 'center', 'stage', 'Spriggan', 'aboslutely', 'exciting', 'anime', 'filled', 'many', 'memorable', 'fight', 'scenes.The', 'story', 'around', 'Yu', 'Ominae', 'high-school', 'student', 'who', 'also', 'part', 'top-secret', 'organization', 'known', 'ARCAM', 'When', 'friends', 'begin', 'be', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'Turkey', 'search', 'who', 'reponsible', 'What', 'comprehension', 'group', 'half', 'machine/half', 'human', 'beings', 'bent', 'finding', 'secret', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'deep', 'Mount', 'Ararat', 'desperate', 'bid', 'stop', 'malevolent', 'plans', 'Yu', 'must', 'fight', 'immeasurable', 'odds.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'sights', 'behold', 'bullets', 'fly', 'punches', 'blaze', 'air', 'action', 'crazy', 'never', 'too', 'hectic', 'animation', 'top-notch', 'completely', 'smooth.And', 'sound', 'bonus', 'film', 'filled', 'explosions', 'battle', 'cries', 'music', 'probably', 'not', 'classic', 'couple', 'memorable', 'beats', 'quot', 'Jing', 'Ling', 'quot', 'ending', 'theme', 'extremely', 'infectious', 'fact', 'type', 'am', 'listening', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'menu', 'quite', 'clean', 'thought', 'ADV', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'extras', 'tie', 'up', 'package', 'Not', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'certainly', 'no', 'worst', 'Production', 'sketches', 'vehicles', 'key', 'locations', 'characters', 'only', 'gripe', 'trailers', 'forget', 'forgot', 'add', 'Spriggan', 'DVD', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'excellent', 'show', 'friends', 'just', 'starting', 'anime', 'just', 'want', 'non-stop', 'action']",Spriggan

Based off the manga by Takashige and Minagawa (who are now making the best selling manga ""Arms""), Spriggan has some subtle themes but by no means is challenging. The story is pretty fast paced with a fight scene punctuating every 5-8 minutes of plot development. A nice touch is that the good guys aren't really all that good ^_^The ending is a little hokey but the combat scenes are unparralleled! Highly detailed, incredibly articulated and dynamic animation. As some one who's worked at some US animation shops I can say this is some of the best stuff I've seen in the past few years (in terms of the motion)...think Cowboy Bebop level of quality.The non-action stuff is also beautiful compositionally. Kawasaki, the director, keeps his pallette very desaturated so it has a slighlty melencholoy feel to it. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning as it is very, very good.

Still, I actually like the animation and the flow of the story better in Spriggan. I also liked the fact that this anime was more action-oriented (granted it's rather bloody in places; war is hell. So I wouldn't recommend showing it to squeamish kids w/o parental supervision).Now, that's not to say I don't have any reservations about Spriggan. I thought the ending was, as many anime endings are, slightly cheap and incomplete. Granted it was ""climactic"" in some regards, and looked pretty, but it seemed to not necessarily tie everything up completely. Not that I could necessarily write a better ending, as some questions don't really have easy answers, and some problems don't have easy or sensible resolutions. So, I don't ENTIRELY begrudge the usual ""shortcut"" ending(s).On the whole, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. But, that said, I was pleasantly surprised. I can say, however, that it's light years ahead ofHarmagedon(which I watched just prior to Spriggan), in terms of visuals, character design and development. There didn't seem to be any ""reused"" scenes, unlike many early animes used (in fight scenes and whatnot). Or, if there were, I didn't notice them (unlike in Harmagedon).There were minimal features on the disc (commentary & trailers mostly). But the video and audio were good, and the feature itself I liked. So, if you're into ""fighting""/""super soldier"" animes, pick up Spriggan if it's at a good price.

The Sound FX of the movie are also top notch.There is a fair amount of glood, and the gore is not overwhelming, but there is enough of it.
