Filmed in the early 80's, it's pacing may seem slow at times compared to the ultra-sleek, CGI rehashes being released today, but this movie has charm and feeling and a persona all its own that shouldn't be rushed.  The scenery is incredibly beautiful, and Robert MacNaughton gives a fine performance as the main character, Adam Farmer.  Adam is searching for his father and receiving psychiatric treatment as he tries to recall the buried memories of his past.  No one around him seems to be able to offer any substantial help as he presses on to discover the painful truth awaiting him.  Twist ending.  Based on the book by Robert Cormier.

895358,AB7ABDGSTHGTT,B0007YMW32,Ray Riddle,"[20, 22]","I first read this book when I was in the 7th grade.  I didn't understand it all then, because there are a lot of levels to the story.  I so identified with Adam, felt so alone, felt all this stuff inside me, wanted to be a writer and kept a journal full of what was in my head, felt like screaming and screaming and never stopping.  I'd read the book twice, I think, when I chanced upon the movie late one night on cable more than 20 years ago.  I was with a friend, and couldn't really let myself go into the movie like I wanted, but remembered liking it, and especially the punch (you'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie).  I spent years looking for a copy, and finally found a VHS copy, which I promptly ordered.When it showed up, I took the TV and the VCR and set them up in my bedroom and sat on my bed in the corner to watch it.  This was such a personal story to me, I wasn't going to share that first watching with anyone.  It was...very very well done.  The story has changed slightly from the book, especially the parts with Amy, but I was glad to see them.  I'd have loved it being just like the book, of course, but the changes made, kind of give Adam an ""adolescent growing up"" feel.  The soundtrack is very subdued, but perfect.  Violin, Oboe, Cello, I'm not sure which is used, but it's about the only instrument used through much of the film, and it really adds that touch of loneliness, of being so alone, especially on Adam's bike ride.  There's a bit of music that plays at times throughout that mimics part of ""The Farmer in the Dell"" that has stayed with me all these years, as Adam, eternally riding his father's bike on that lonely ride to Monument in my head.  They both play together in my mind.Robert MacNaughton, who played Elliot's older brother in ""E.T."", was the perfect Adam.  I've seen several different covers for the book, one of which shows a boy, who looks to be about 8 years old at the most, in some kind of prison cell or something similar.  And while the feel of the cover captures the essence of the book, the boy is far too young.  Robert MacNaughton is just the right age and does such a great job in this, you have to wonder why his acting career never took off.  As I'm watching this, he IS Adam.  It's like there isn't any acting involved.  Someone followed Adam around with a camera filming his life, and released it as a movie.Some people talk about the cold relationship he and Doctor Brint have, how unrealistic it is, and thus makes a poorer movie.  I disagree completely.  For Adam's part, all that has happened to him, though he can remember only parts of it, have lead him to be distrustful of anybody in authority (in fact, that was the theme of Cormier's book, man versus government/authority and how man ultimately loses), and Brint is certainly an authority figure, and one who seems to be trying get specific things out of Adam, all the while trying to help him.  There's at least one scene where Brint is asking him specific questions and Adam starts to get paranoid and asks repeatedly to end the session.  So it's no surprise Adam doesn't warm up completely to Doctor Brint.  And as for Brint's part, he knows, ultimately, what is going to happen to Adam once he gets all the information his superiors are wanting, and thus I can easily see him not wanting to get close to this particular patient.  Part of him just wants to think of Adam as a tool, so when the eventual end happens, it won't affect him emotinally, but another part of him is still the doctor, wanting to help, and can't distance himself completely.  Which is why, at the end of the movie, he does nothing when he sees Adam through the window, on his bike, riding near the van.The only actor I had problems with was Adam's father (Don Murray), who gives a completely wooden performance in this, which is surprising considering I've seen him do a fine job in other movies, like ""Quarterback Princess,"" and ""Peggy Sue Got Married.""This has the feel of a low-budget movie, but that very feel works to its benefit.  More money, a slicker production, would have taken away from the essence of the movie, that core feeling that runs through both the movie and the book.The movie begins with Adam waking up, putting on his coat and picking up a wrapped package, and starting off on his bike.  It switches after a bit to Adam in a room, meeting Doctor Brint.  It switches back and forth between the bike ride and the psychiatric sessions with Brint, and scenes from Adam's life as Brint helps him to remember them.  The bike ride is not uneventful, but always lonely, even when other people are encountered.  The music meshes perfectly with the scenes, and once the movie is over, you find yourself thinking about all the different levels to this story.  The book has them all, but the movie really helps to bring them out.  The endings are different between the movie and the book, but unlike most book-to-movie adaptations, I don't mind.  After years of living with the book, and that ride, and those sessions, in my head, I needed the ending the movie gave me.I highly recommend watching the movie and reading the book, most especially to those not yet adults, but to people of all ages.  It is a tale that makes you think, that makes you feel, and doesn't just provide an hour and a half of entertainment easily forgotten when the next movie is on.  This one will stay with you for a very long time, if not forever.I gave the movie 5 stars because it's better than 4.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate a 9, but that doesn't quite break down to 4 of 5.",5,Adam still pedals on his lonely bike ride in my mind..,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,5591,"['first', 'read',
