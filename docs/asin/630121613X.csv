246785,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,630121613X,Bomojaz,"[7, 8]","The setting is a private school for the rich run by Catholic monks in France; the time is January 1944. The story is about how 2 boys become friends, and how one, who is of a rich Paris family, learns that the other is Jewish. One day the Gestapo comes and the Jewish boy is arrested, along with the head of the school who had been hiding him there. Louis Malle, who wrote and directed the movie, said that this is based on a true story in his own childhood, and it is faithfully, even lovingly, produced - yet this parochial French setting during the Nazi occupation seems so strange and different it might have taken place on another planet. Though not much happens - the boys attend classes (in freezing rooms), fight with one another, attend church, exercise, etc. - one's interest never flags. This is mainly for two reasons: it IS so different (the boys sleep in one big dormitory room, they bathe at the public baths in town, their game of war on stilts, the wild boar in the woods, the monks in bare feet); and the tension that builds as we slowly learn of the Jewish boy and then the scene with ""collaborators"" in a restaurant, and then the final outrage with the Gestapo barging in on the school - it happens so subtly yet inevitably that we can't but feel morally outraged and moved at the end. An excellent film; it's also beautifully photographed.

246786,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,630121613X,Buenoslibros.es,"[3, 6]","French director Louis Malle made in this one, in my opinion, his greatest work.Briefly -and mainly- this is the story of two kids in a catholic school during the German occupation of France.As always, different critics will pick up those themes that most interest him. To me this was a film abouta) Childhood cruelty,b) Coming of agec) Social classes (as noted from the environment of a school)d) and religionNot in any particular order but all very interrelated. Also, I'd like to point out some interesting notes that caught my eye: the education environment. The relation between kids themselves, and the kids and their teachers. I was specially interested (because of the contrast with today's US) in the quality of education that was taught in France, in the spirit of discipline, respect, hard word... the underlining importance -as usual in French films- of books. Sure the French kids could be as ""naughty"" as US kids, but at least they would read Jules Verne or Arabian Nights. What do US kids read? That's right, nothing. They don't know Melville, Steinbeck, Jack London, Robert L. Stevenson. In US public schools kids don't read anything. They have the maid-teachers read for them. They still write on lined paper in college because they wouldn't be able to write straight (!!).A work of art, even more because it is not an easy-to-tell story, this one. And time practically flies while watching it. I suggest showing it to your nearest specimen of teenager. If he stands the whole movie, he is probably a happy private school kid or a miserable public shool underachiever. If he stands ten minutes only, he can still live to be a senator or even President. If he runs away at the beginning he is probably a ""normal"" kid. (And, unfortunately, the same applies to their parents).A wonderful film.",5,A  Classic of European Films,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,1806,"['French', 'director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'made', 'one', 'opinion', 'greatest', 'work.Briefly', '-and', 'mainly-', 'story', 'two', 'kids', 'catholic', 'school', 'German', 'occupation', 'France.As', 'always', 'different', 'critics', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'themes', 'most', 'interest', 'was', 'film', 'abouta', 'Childhood', 'cruelty', 'b', 'Coming', 'agec', 'Social', 'classes', 'noted', 'environment', 'school', 'd', 'religionNot', 'particular', 'order', 'very', 'interrelated', 'Also', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'interesting', 'notes', 'caught', 'eye', 'education', 'environment', 'relation', 'kids', 'kids', 'teachers', 'was', 'specially', 'interested', 'contrast', 'today', 'US', 'quality', 'education', 'was', 'taught', 'France', 'spirit', 'discipline', 'respect', 'hard', 'word', 'underlining', 'importance', '-as', 'usual', 'French', 'films-', 'books', 'Sure', 'French', 'kids', 'could', 'be', 'naughty', 'US', 'kids', 'least', 'would', 'read', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'What', 'do', 'kids', 'read', 'right', 'nothing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Melville', 'Steinbeck', 'Jack', 'London', 'Robert', 'L.', 'Stevenson', 'US', 'public', 'schools', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'have', 'maid-teachers', 'read', 'still', 'write', 'lined', 'paper', 'college', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'write', 'straight', '.A', 'work', 'art', 'even', 'more', 'not', 'easy-to-tell', 'story', 'one', 'time', 'practically', 'flies', 'watching', 'suggest', 'showing', 'nearest', 'specimen', 'teenager', 'whole', 'movie', 'probably', 'happy', 'private', 'school', 'kid', 'miserable', 'public', 'shool', 'underachiever', 'ten', 'minutes', 'only', 'can', 'still', 'live', 'be', 'senator', 'even', 'President', 'away', 'beginning', 'probably', 'normal', 'kid', 'unfortunately', 'same', 'applies', 'parents', '.A', 'wonderful', 'film']",Au Revoir Les Enfants VHS
246787,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,630121613X,Dennis Littrell,"[46, 53]","This is a masterpiece of cinema, a work of genius by the late great Louis Malle.  Would that we had another like him!  As in Le souffle au coeur (1971) Malle (apparently) reprises part of his childhood for us, recalling everything with the barest touch, just the slightest emphasis, without rancor or any loading of the deck.  He understates and plays fair always.  He has complete control of his story as he gently guides the audience.  He knows what they believe and what they expect.  He respects that, but he doesn't cater, and he is very gentle about leading us to the conclusion.  He makes it beautiful although it is horrible.Gaspard Manesse as Julien and Raphael Fejto as Jean are unforgettable and a reminder that in film it's important to have a good cast.  Yet, I suspect Malle could have made geniuses of any number of talented boys in their roles.  This is your Catholic boys school coming of age film without lecherous priests or the brutality of children; that is, no more than is necessary, just what is real and seen in perspective, the context being the Nazi occupation of France in 1944.  It is amazing how Malle manages to show the bestiality and brain dead stupidity of the Nazis by presenting them at their most gentle.  If one can damn by faint praise, one can destroy by contrast.  Compared to what is human and natural we see the Nazis, as their pretentious Reich is falling apart, chasing after children, obsessed with psychotic racist delusions.  Through the objective eyes of the children we see the evil.  Malle need only let the events speak for themselves.I think artists working in any medium would benefit from a study of this film.  (An excellent American film by Malle also worth study is the fascinating Atlantic City (1980) starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon.)  What Malle's technique teaches us is to be honest, to be fair, and to keep it simple, but not too simple.  Use not a brush stroke more than necessary, and pay attention to every detail, especially the small ones.  But while we can learn from and appreciate, it takes genius to pull it off.  It can't be done by connecting the dots.I am struck by a little irony on the jacket of the video.  It has an early Siskel and Ebert quote: ""One of the year's best films.""  That's a little embarrassing unless the year is a hundred years long.Incidentally, the sublime and beautiful Ir&egrave;ne Jacob, who later became a protege of Krzysztof Kieslowski in La Double vie de V&eacute;ronique (1991) and Trois Couleurs: Rouge (1994), made her debut here in a small part as a piano teacher.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",5,A work of genius,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,2681,"['masterpiece', 'cinema', 'work', 'genius', 'late', 'great', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Would', 'had', 'Le', 'souffle', 'au', 'coeur', '1971', 'Malle', 'apparently', 'part', 'childhood', 'recalling', 'everything', 'barest', 'touch', 'just', 'slightest', 'emphasis', 'rancor', 'loading', 'deck', 'fair', 'always', 'complete', 'control', 'story', 'gently', 'audience', 'what', 'believe', 'what', 'expect', ""n't"", 'cater', 'very', 'gentle', 'leading', 'conclusion', 'beautiful', 'horrible.Gaspard', 'Manesse', 'Julien', 'Raphael', 'Fejto', 'Jean', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'reminder', 'film', 'important', 'have', 'good', 'cast', 'suspect', 'Malle', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'geniuses', 'number', 'talented', 'boys', 'roles', 'Catholic', 'boys', 'school', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'lecherous', 'priests', 'brutality', 'children', 'no', 'more', 'necessary', 'just', 'what', 'real', 'seen', 'perspective', 'context', 'being', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'France', '1944', 'amazing', 'how', 'Malle', 'show', 'bestiality', 'brain', 'dead', 'stupidity', 'Nazis', 'presenting', 'most', 'gentle', 'one', 'can', 'damn', 'faint', 'praise', 'one', 'can', 'destroy', 'contrast', 'Compared', 'what', 'human', 'natural', 'see', 'Nazis', 'pretentious', 'Reich', 'falling', 'apart', 'chasing', 'children', 'obsessed', 'psychotic', 'racist', 'delusions', 'objective', 'eyes', 'children', 'see', 'evil', 'Malle', 'need', 'only', 'let', 'events', 'speak', 'themselves.I', 'think', 'artists', 'working', 'medium', 'would', 'benefit', 'study', 'film', 'excellent', 'American', 'film', 'Malle', 'also', 'worth', 'study', 'fascinating', 'Atlantic', 'City', '1980', 'starring', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'What', 'Malle', 'technique', 'teaches', 'be', 'honest', 'be', 'fair', 'keep', 'simple', 'not', 'too', 'simple', 'Use', 'not', 'brush', 'stroke', 'more', 'necessary', 'pay', 'attention', 'detail', 'especially', 'small', 'ones', 'can', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'pull', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'connecting', 'dots.I', 'am', 'struck', 'little', 'irony', 'jacket', 'video', 'early', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'quote', 'One', 'year', 'best', 'films', 'little', 'embarrassing', 'year', 'hundred', 'years', 'long.Incidentally', 'sublime', 'beautiful', 'Ir', 'egrave', 'Jacob', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'protege', 'Krzysztof', 'Kieslowski', 'La', 'Double', 'vie', 'de', 'V', 'eacute', 'ronique', '1991', 'Trois', 'Couleurs', 'Rouge', '1994', 'made', 'debut', 'here', 'small', 'part', 'piano', 'teacher.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",Au Revoir Les Enfants VHS
246788,A280GY5UVUS2QH,630121613X,Doug Anderson,"[2, 2]","The overall atmosphere of the movie is a threatening one. The historical circumstance threatens all but in particularly Jean whom the main character Julian befriends. Jean is not Catholic, he has been placed in the boarding school with the school fathers approval to hide him as well as a couple other boys. The viewer knows Jeans ""secret"" all along but it takes Julian a lttle time to figure it out so I'm not giving anything away. Jean lives in fear of being found out, so while the other boys lose themselves in games of play he is always on the look out & as Julian and he become friends so too is Julian on the look out. The two boys are equally gifted, both a bit precocious,  and they share their enthusiasms with each other for books, for music, and for girls.The movies most powerful scenes are the ones where that bond is consolidated as in the scenes where the two boys are separated from the rest in a treasure hunt game. The two run for their lives from the other boys in a game of play but real life  resonates within the game. The two are lost together but are found by a German patrol and returned to their school. Jean is relieved not to have been found out even though he ran when the Germans found the boys. Julian breaks down crying though, it is as if he knows instinctively just how real the game really is. Julian invites Jean to dinner when his mother comes to visit and during dinner at a posh restaurant Julian tests the petty prejudices that even someone so dear to him as his own mother holds. ""Aren't we Jewish too?""Many of the best moments are when the war has been pushed into the background as when the whole school watches a Chaplin film. Malle pans the audience laughing while Chaplin negotiates a ships to and fro movements and then he pans the boys faces again when Chaplin courts a beautiful girl and all the boys faces are still before the mystery of it.  And the scene when Julian and Jean ignore an air raid siren and remain above ground alone playing a lively jazzy piano duo together which makes them both spill over with the delight it gives them. When together they are a world of two, they read taboo passages from 1001 Arabian nights by candlelight while the other boys sleep. The joy of the movie is that their bond seems so real, their moments together seem absolutely natural.This film has the quiet nuances you expect from Malle but all is perhaps even more heigtened by that pervading atmosphere which  threatens always to put an end to it all.",5,materpiece of two youth's bond,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,2495,"['overall', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'threatening', 'one', 'historical', 'circumstance', 'particularly', 'Jean', 'whom', 'main', 'character', 'Julian', 'befriends', 'Jean', 'not', 'Catholic', 'been', 'placed', 'boarding', 'school', 'school', 'fathers', 'approval', 'hide', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'other', 'boys', 'viewer', 'Jeans', 'secret', 'all', 'along', 'Julian', 'lttle', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'Jean', 'lives', 'fear', 'being', 'found', 'out', 'so', 'other', 'boys', 'lose', 'games', 'play', 'always', 'look', 'out', 'Julian', 'become', 'friends', 'so', 'too', 'Julian', 'look', 'out', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'equally', 'gifted', 'bit', 'precocious', 'share', 'enthusiasms', 'other', 'books', 'music', 'girls.The', 'movies', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'bond', 'consolidated', 'scenes', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'are', 'separated', 'rest', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'game', 'two', 'run', 'lives', 'other', 'boys', 'game', 'play', 'real', 'life', 'resonates', 'game', 'two', 'are', 'lost', 'together', 'are', 'found', 'German', 'patrol', 'returned', 'school', 'Jean', 'relieved', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'out', 'even', 'ran', 'when', 'Germans', 'found', 'boys', 'Julian', 'breaks', 'down', 'crying', 'instinctively', 'just', 'how', 'real', 'game', 'really', 'Julian', 'Jean', 'dinner', 'when', 'mother', 'visit', 'dinner', 'posh', 'restaurant', 'Julian', 'petty', 'prejudices', 'even', 'someone', 'so', 'dear', 'own', 'mother', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Jewish', 'too', 'Many', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'war', 'been', 'pushed', 'background', 'when', 'whole', 'school', 'watches', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'Malle', 'audience', 'laughing', 'Chaplin', 'ships', 'fro', 'movements', 'then', 'boys', 'again', 'when', 'Chaplin', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'boys', 'are', 'still', 'mystery', 'scene', 'when', 'Julian', 'Jean', 'ignore', 'air', 'raid', 'siren', 'remain', 'above', 'ground', 'alone', 'playing', 'lively', 'jazzy', 'piano', 'duo', 'together', 'spill', 'delight', 'When', 'together', 'are', 'world', 'two', 'read', 'taboo', 'passages', '1001', 'Arabian', 'nights', 'candlelight', 'other', 'boys', 'sleep', 'joy', 'movie', 'bond', 'so', 'real', 'moments', 'together', 'seem', 'absolutely', 'natural.This', 'film', 'quiet', 'nuances', 'expect', 'Malle', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'heigtened', 'pervading', 'atmosphere', 'always', 'put', 'end']",Au Revoir Les Enfants VHS

246790,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,630121613X,Dr. James Gardner,"[6, 7]","Au Revior les Enfants is a 1987 film written and directed by Louie Malle that recalls his fall and winter semesters in Catholic school in France in 1944. During this time, the Germans are stepping up their program against the Jews, and eventually the issue comes to Malle's school where a number of Jewish boys have been posing as Catholics.Malle was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Murmur of the Heart"", ""Atlantic City"", ""Au Revoir les Enfants"") . He won 2 awards at Cannes (""Pretty Baby"" and ""Le Monde du Silence"") and over his career of 33 films he won a total of 37 awards. Malle is famous for ""The Lovers"" (1958) which resulted in a Supreme Court ruling about pornography, and equally famous for being the husband of Candice Bergen. I think his best work was ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981) although his most reknowned film is ""Au Revoir Les Enfants."" The film won 7 French Oscars and several European awards. It was nominated for a Golden Globe, 2 Oscars and 4 BAFTAs, but won only 1 BAFTA (best direction).As with almost any French film it is slow to develop and tends to linger on individual scenes in an attempt to bring some lyrical quality to the shot. Malle's tender reflections go on and on for more than an hour before we can get any sense of the underlying theme of the film. Though it's all very nice and child-like, it seems an excessive amount of time to devote to the goings on. For example, at one point, we watch the children watch a Charlie Chaplin silent film. It's a marvelous bit of direction and works, for about 30 seconds. But as the scene lingers on, switching between the children and Chaplin, I found myself getting more interested in the Chaplin film than the French film. Mercifully, after about 3 minutes, the scene ends. What could have been a touch of brilliance got milked to the point of becoming an annoyance.I understand that many viewers will find the slow pace enjoyable, and some will find it enthralling. Roger Ebert praises how Malle ""naturally evokes the daily life of a French boarding school"". I'm just saying that I don't. Moreover, it's hard to imagine that this is really World War 2 and there are people being slaughtered everywhere. The Nazis behave like stern school monitors, and even the Gestapo are polite, sincere, and gentlemanly. In addition, everyone complains about the cold, but there is no snow, no ice, not even a chill wind blowing. People complain about the lack of food, but everywhere people seem to be well fed and there are a couple of really fat kids.""Au Revoir"" can be compared with other World War 2 films that show what goes on in a conquered country.

Long after finishing Au Revoir Les Enfants, the story will disturb you...it is a part of history that we rarely think about anymore, the German occupation of France and the genocide of the Jews and their sympathizers.Louis Malle, the famous French director (1932-1995) and the late husband of actress Candace Bergen not only directed this film, but it is his story.  Malle was able to find closure for an experience that had preoccupied him since the German occupation of France in World War II. When he was 12, he was sent to a Catholic boarding school near Paris where the priests and teachers kept several Jewish students hidden.  They were given French names and the other boys were not told.  Julien Quentin (as Malle) begs his mother not to send him; he is a thoughtful, bright, sensitive boy who has a secret; he is a bed-wetter.  What a horrible place for a child who wets the bed............having to sleep with scores of other boys in a huge dormitory.  In addition, it is freezing cold and there is never enough food. But there is fun and games and the teachers really care for their pupils.Through a series of events our young hero becomes good friends with a new student, Jean Bonnet.  When Julien finds out that Jean's last name is really Kippelstein, he realizes what he has suspected for a while, that Jean is a Jew.  The boys forge a friendship based on their love of books, music and their innate intelligence.  Jean even eats lunch with Julien's mother and brother during parent's day.  Then one day the Nazis come to class and arrest the three hidden Jews and the Priest (also the principal of the school) who protected them and send them to concentration camps.  The informant was the fired kitchen worker.  They also close down the school.  Julien and the other children, whose lives were once so carefree, are affected by this event for the rest of their lives.  In fact, their childhood is lost.This haunting film is very well acted, the children portray such an innocence, even during their rough housing.  They are extremely believable.

246799,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,630121613X,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[8, 40]","Hollywood has embedded in the minds of movie-goers for generations the horrific images of the Jewish Holocaust during World War II. Though mainly dramatic presentations, there are instances where lighthearted moments are thrown in order to not leave the audience too emotionally depressed, while at the same time not allowing them to leave forgetting about one of the most brutal genocides in our history. Steven Spielberg's epic presentation, Schindler's List, is quite probably one of the most revered of the Holocaust genre, having won numerous awards including Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but there have been many others including The Pianist and Life is Beautiful. But, for one reason or another, foreign releases have failed to embrace, so to speak, this specific subject in their films as much as we have, so when one is released and praised it is only right to stand up and take notice.The story for Goodbye, Children, based on the childhood experiences of the film's director Louis Malle, is not so much a commentary on the loss of innocence in the midst of the ravaged countryside of France during the second world war as it is instead a direct condemnation of the ignorance of which the French enveloped themselves in during the war and the half-hearted assessment they continue to express toward the Jewish race to this day. True, the conclusion to the film in which Julien is shown starring in stark disbelief at the sight of three of his fellow classmates, including the young Bonnet with whom he had recently established a friendship with, and his mentor does strike an emotional chord, albeit less expressive then that of either Life is Beautiful or Schindler's List, but it is actions expressed by the school boys throughout the earlier portion of the film such as the smoking or the ogling of women that would appear to contradict this belief. There is quite a dramatic difference between the loss of innocence and the discovery of ignorance, the latter applying to Julien and a fair number of the boys within the French Catholic boarding school at the end of the film.Since this was based on the memoirs of Louis Malle, we as a collective audience have to assume that the events of the film actually took place, but as with nearly every Hollywood production, domestic or foreign, based on actual events, there are bound to be particular sequences which were fabricated in order to either liven up the mood of the picture or to have the script flow more consistently. Sadly, based on educational purposes, Goodbye, Children does not branch far from its focus on the relationship between the two boys in the boarding school, leaving those less familiar with the detailed events of World War II, specifically the assistance of the Vichy government during the Nazi occupation period in tracking down the Jews, completely lost. And though this does feature a leading character who is eventually captured by the Nazis and is sent to die in Auschwitz, this should not be dictated as a ""Holocaust film"" in the sense that it barely acknowledges the suffering of the Jews within the concentration camps at the hand of Nazi cruelty. It is in instances such as these that films like Schindler's List become an invaluable educational tool in bringing the suffering of the Jewish race under the Nazi regime into full view for college students.It is quite understandable for Malle to portray the French collaborators of the German occupation of France as individuals who are as morally corrupt, if not more so, then the Nazis themselves in part because they are fully aware of what is taking place and yet are allowing it to transpire in order to save their own necks and perhaps make a little change on the side as well. An unmitigated result of Malle venting his frustration toward those who would betray their country as the collaborators had done is that the director appears to go quite easy on the Nazis within the film, going so far as to even portray them as decent human beings. When the Nazis begin to appear sufferable that is usually the telltale sign that this obsession is being taken to an unhealthy level and needs to be quelled immediately.Gaspard Manesse gives an eloquent performance in the role of Julien, the protagonist of the pictures, who can easily be fathomed as the childlike reflection of the director Louis Malle on whose childhood experiences in occupied France were the basis for this film. Sadly the magnificent performance given by Manesse does not in effect make up for the lack of character development and direction. The motivations and the emotions behind the character Julien are a mystery and appear to come straight out of thin-air. For example, when Julien first meets the new student Bonnet, he snubs him and swears at him. One could apply the ancient excuse of ""boys will be boys"", but can anyone recall a time in their childhood when they acted as he did to a person they had just met? Raphael Fejt&ouml; performs fairly well opposite Gaspard Manesse, or at least in the scene where they are playing the piano together, and given that this is one of his first feature film roles, there is little to complain about. There are however other problems that concern the character of Bonnet that transcend the performance of the young child actor. The most apparent of which being that the screenwriters rely on a few racial stereotypes of the Jewish race - for example, the admission from Bonnet that his father worked as an accountant before the war - in order to fill out his back-story. Though the script certainly does not follow the route of the Nazis in making the Jews out to be a race to be feared and discriminated, this nonetheless would appear to be going against the message the film attempted to covey upon its audience and acts merely as a telltale sign that the French no matter how much time has passed that they are not entirely absolved of their occupation from the Nazi ideology.Pere Jean, the benevolent monk in charge of the Catholic boarding school for French boys, is played affectionately by Philippe Morier-Genoud. There are sure to individuals within the audience that will complain that Pere Jean is not seen enough in the film but seeing as how the story's focus is of the relationship between the two boys, Morier-Genoud screen time and his body language within those periods demonstrate a figure that is paternalistic but standoffish enough to allow the children develop without being smothered as they are at home. The scene in which Pere Jean and the three Jewish boys are rounded up by the Nazis and taken to the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, is truly a poignant moment as the boys lose not only their mentor and friend but also the only father figure some of the young children have had in their lives for the past few years.Overall, Goodbye Children, though undoubtedly conceived as a copious perspective of the trepidation that was the Jewish Holocaust, instead acts merely as a subservient and adolescent equivalent to the realistic, emotionally driven, and vastly superior Schindler's List, a historical masterpiece truly worthy of the recognition it has received. It is quite ironic that a film whose storyline involves Jews hidden by Christian monks in a boys boarding school during World War II would be made in France, which is undoubtedly one of the most anti-Semitic countries in all of Europe. With synagogues being blown up or burnt down and Jewish graves being vandalized with Swastikas spray painted onto them not being uncommon news in France, it is hard to imagine this film ever invoking too much of an emotional reaction from its audiences. But even if it had been well received within Malle's native land, there is little doubt that the French populous would have learned anything more of value then the American audiences had received, which was sadly very little.",3,The Moose Hole - Irony: A French Holocaust Film,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,7881,"['Hollywood', 'embedded', 'minds', 'movie-goers', 'generations', 'horrific',

There has got to be a  general topic here for some desperate grad student someday looking for a dissertation theme. For I recently ran into a friend from the Dupont Circle neighborhood on the street, and he brought my reviews here  up. After asking ""What are you guys doing for fun nowadays?"", he surprised me by saying that he actually had seen some of my reviews here online. He actually chided me a bit for being too nice to the Catholic Church, as he said ""always bending over backwards"" to emphasize that there are plenty of decent Catholics. Even though the Roman Church is engaged in the most heinous campaign against gay people. He asked why...??  Well, this movie sort of explains why. My dad's own story as a Jewish  child during the Second World War was quite similar to this movie. For that reason I found this movie especially poignant. This provides the ""why"" for my ""bending over backwards"" because I think it is a tenet of a moral life that you never forget a good deed done to you. And as my dad's story had a better, and less tragic ending than the one in this movie, I am here writing this today. Of course, in sad irony, my father was also subject to some of the now  cliche vices of the Catholic clergy.

246803,A2W1GT509PD228,630121613X,"Randy ""An Idealistic Realist""","[12, 13]","Au Revoir les Enfants (Goodbye, Children) is a French film of profound sadness. The story is about Julien Quentin, a young French boy who must attend school in the countryside because Paris is not safe due to WWII. The opening scene with Julien saying goodbye to his mother says a lot about Julien's character. He can be mean yet at the same time, he shows incredible love and friendship to those dearest to him. While at the school, he meets Jean Bonnet, a mysterious boy who Julien cannot help but be curious about.The title of the film says much about the themes present. As the film progresses, 12-year-old Julien learns about the tragic things in life. Unlike most other boys his age, the events surrounding the film cause him to grow up earlier than he is comfortable with. Childhood is an incredibly fleeting thing and to many of the characters in the film, it is even more so.The strongest part of the film was the acting by Gaspard Manesse (Julien) and Raphael Fejt&ouml; (Bonnet). Julien initially takes a dislike to Bonnet, but they begin spending more time with one another, learning that despite differences in each other, they are able to get along and form a friendship that touches both of their hearts. A tragic yet innocent mistake late in the film leads to a heart wrenching and unforgettable ending.Au Revoir les Enfants is one of the best films I've seen. It is intelligent and deep in its message. For me, the message is that war affects children unnecessarily and cruelly. Like the title implies, children are forced to grow up too quickly because of war. I do not know about other viewers but for me, childhood was a happy yet brief time. For children affected by war and violence, it is even shorter, and this film perfectly embodies the tragic consequences that follow. I cannot recommend a film more intensely than this.

I watched it the other night and must admit that it IS an exceptional movie.  At first I figured that it might be just another over-rated French movie as I watched a well-done production of the standard boy's school hyjinks.  However, the characters were more substanitive that usual (even for a group of pre-teens nearing puberty) and the setting of France during WWII added a lot to the dramatic effect.You could guess what was coming but I kept getting more and more impressed by the depth of the story, supporting cast, and the way Malle let us see Occupied France.  We see the collaborators, the anti-semites (somewhat redundant), the ones who buried their heads in the sand, and those brave enough to risk their lives for others.  The ending is not action-filled nor overly dramatic.  The ending evolves from a series of events that seem to happen too fast and then it is over.  A narrator from the future puts it all into perspective as we realize we have glimpsed a scene of horror that happened too easily.  Malle has given us an excellent movie and he has given his fellow French an uncomfortable (for many) look at their recent past.",5,Lost Innocence,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,1257,"['had', 'heard', 'Au', 'Revoir', 'Enfants', 'was', 'exceptional', 'film', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'watched', 'other', 'night', 'must', 'admit', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'first', 'figured', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'over-rated', 'French', 'movie', 'watched', 'well-done', 'production', 'standard', 'boy', 'school', 'hyjinks', 'However', 'characters', 'were', 'more', 'substanitive', 'usual', 'even', 'group', 'pre-teens', 'nearing', 'puberty', 'setting', 'France', 'WWII', 'added', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'effect.You', 'could', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'kept', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'impressed', 'depth', 'story', 'supporting', 'cast', 'way', 'Malle', 'let', 'see', 'Occupied', 'France', 'see', 'collaborators', 'anti-semites', 'somewhat', 'redundant', 'ones', 'who', 'buried', 'heads', 'sand', 'brave', 'enough', 'risk', 'lives', 'others', 'ending', 'not', 'action-filled', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'evolves', 'series', 'events', 'seem', 'happen', 'too', 'fast', 'then', 'over', 'narrator', 'future', 'perspective', 'realize', 'have', 'glimpsed', 'scene', 'horror', 'happened', 'too', 'easily', 'Malle', 'given', 'excellent', 'movie', 'given', 'fellow', 'French', 'uncomfortable', 'many', 'look', 'recent', 'past']",Au Revoir Les Enfants VHS

His Au Revoir, Les Enfants, based on his own wartime memories is about the guarded friendship of two 12 year-old boys of 12, Julien Quentin and Jean Bonnet (played by amateur actors Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto. Julien has been sent by train from Paris to the distant safety of a Catholic boarding school for rich kids.  At the school, Julien finds happiness and security from the war.

Because it's based on the truth, it has added meaning for the viewer. It's about school, friendship, racism and regret.The story begins with a 15-year-old boy, Julien Quentin (Manesse), leaving his mother and taking the train to a Catholic boarding school. The school is run by monks and all of the students are boys. It's set in the 1940s during the German occupation of France. A new boy, Jean Bonnet (Fejt&ouml;), takes the bed next to Quentin.Most of the students tease Bonnet and make his life a misery. As you have probably experienced, this is typical treatment for a new student in any school. In addition to the teasing, he finds that the water is cold, baths have to be taken in the local town, and air raids disrupt the lessons. Bonnet's life becomes more tolerable when a monk tells Quentin to befriend him without explaining why. After a while, Bonnet's ability in a wide range of school subjects such as music, math and French, earns Quentin's respect. The two become friends.The portrayal of school life is realistic and reminds me somewhat of The 400 Blows. It gradually becomes clear that Bonnet has a secret. He claims to be a protestant and mentions that his father is a prisoner. Quentin searches Bonnet's locker and uncovers the secret, but he's not completely aware of its significance at the time.When his mother visits, Quentin persuades her to include Bonnet on a trip to a local restaurant. She likes him although he doesn't say much. While they are eating, we are shown a group of collaborators harassing a Jewish man who simply wants to have dinner. Jews are not allowed in the restaurant. Quentin is puzzled by this treatment and isn't even sure what a Jew is and why they should be hated.Quentin matures throughout the film and his awareness of events happening in his life increases. It's a coming-of-age tale of sorts, and the seemingly innocent existence of the students is overshadowed by something more sinister.This sad tale will emotionally affect viewers who allow themselves to be drawn into the story. I can only imagine what Malle must have gone through in order to make it. Perhaps it was his way of confessing?I don't want to reveal anything more as it might ruin the experience for anyone yet to see it.Actress Ir&egrave;ne Jacob made her film debut in the role of a piano teacher which ultimately led to her being noticed by director Krzysztof Kieslowski.

246809,A3M2WW0PO34B94,630121613X,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[34, 36]","Louis Malle, one of the best directors to ever create film, gained his reputation through a series of semi-autobiographical films, films so heart-felt, so deeply emotional, so full of detail, they can't be anything but outstanding. ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", recently released on DVD by the Criterion Collection, is my favorite of these films.Julien (Gaspard Manesse) has a deep-felt affection for his mother (see Malle's ""Murmur of the Heart"" for more on this) but he understands he will be much safer at the French boarding school in the countryside. The school, run by priests, provides a safe haven for the children of well-off families during World War II. Returning from Christmas break, the new year is uneventful for a while. Julien is a bright student and the ring leader for a bunch of boys. Julien trades items with Joseph, a poor boy who works in the kitchen, more out of amusement than anything else, but also to supplement the meager diet served by the priests. One day, a new student arrives; Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejto), a quiet boy the other kids make fun of: ""Look at Easter Bonnet."" Julien also begins to notice things about the new kid; he doesn't participate in the Catholic prayers the father's lead, he doesn't eat certain things, and one night, Julien wakes up to find Jean praying over some candles. Then, Julien's attitude changes and he forms an uneasy friendship with Jean.Made in 1987, more than forty years after the events depicted, Julien is a thinly disguised autobiographical version of the director, as he lives a real life event from Malle's childhood. You might expect such a film to be filled with saccharin and sugar, full of fond reminiscences from his childhood. But the film is very astute at depicting the childhood as an observer might see it. We watch Julien observe things, react to things, but he is very adult for his age, giving us an adult view of the events. Because we are watching his reactions, we see his feelings, which are emotional but reserved. It is similar to a television show with a laugh track, the fake laughter cueing us to laugh. When the television show doesn't have a laugh track, they have to work harder to make us laugh. When we are watching the events unfold through Julien's eyes, Malle has to work harder to make adults feel for the characters. Because this works, every emotion is more resonant and the film is much more powerful.Life in the school is depicted in such a vivid fashion, it instantly becomes clear someone really lived through this period, this tale is autobiographical. The boys live in an old monastery, with very little heat. Yet, they don't seem to notice the problem much. They have endured it for so long and have become used to it, playing outside in the frigid weather, wearing shorts and coats. The classes are also very different from what we are used to today; the teachers are strict and the children tend to learn despite the circumstances of their life. Even though these children are from rich families, living in this boarding school, and they are well-cared for, they still have worries. The war is ever present. Some of the students have lost brothers, father, uncles and more. They are better off than many of their countrymen, but that doesn't mean they are comfortable.As the relationship between Julien and Jean grows and changes, their friendship becomes deeper. Julien is like most boys his age, anytime someone new enters the picture, they have to prove they can fit in. Jean doesn't really fit in, or for that matter, really try to. Yet, every time Julien is surrounded by a group of friends, Jean seems to long for the same camaraderie. He is better in most subjects than Jean and he seems to get the preferential treatment Julien once received. But as Julien realizes Jean is different, and begins to piece together why, he realizes Jean will never completely fit in and has to help him through this ordeal. They become friends. Thankfully, Malle also shows a lot of restraint in this area. The friendship is a gradual thing. It doesn't happen immediately, or completely, taking time to develop.Because the film is set in the winter of 1944, the threat of German soldiers is constant. These soldiers have occupied the small town, changing everything about the people's lives. Yet, Malle doesn't paint them as the completely evil men we have come to associate with Hitler's persona. Yes, there is always a threat, but some of their human qualities are displayed. When Julien and Jean get lost in the forest, German soldiers find them and return them to the school. One of the teachers makes a remark about the ""filthy"" German soldiers. The soldier responds he would like the blanket the ""filthy"" Germans used to keep the children warm during the ride back. During a parent visit, Julien's mother visits and takes them to a restaurant. At the restaurant a French Collaborator gives a Jewish customer a hard time. A table of German soldiers notices this and chastises the French Collaborator, humiliating him, leaving the Jewish customer to reflect in silence. The German Soldiers acted out of irritation at having their dinner interrupted, but it is interesting to watch them take the frustration out on the right person. It would have been extremely easy to paint the German soldiers as the villains we know they were. This story is told through Julien's eyes. And at the time, he wouldn't have known the full extent of the atrocities inflicted by the German army. Therefore, Malle makes some of these men seem human, giving the entire film another layer of depth. Also, during the final moments, when the Gestapo arrives at the school to investigate claims of Jewish students, their leader seems to be fairly kind and nurturing, even towards the Jewish students he uncovers. Of course, this makes him all the more monstrous. We don't expect him to take one of the children and start reading him a bedtime story. We know the fate of these children. And it is chilling. We don't really need to know what happened to them, but when Malle provides voice over narrating what happened to Jean and the other Jewish students hiding in the boarding school, we learn their fate and it causes great sadness.All of these different layers help to make the story seem more realistic. The boarding school is run by Pere Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud), a strict missionary who puts up with little foolishness. But after Jean's arrival, Julien witnesses a different side of the headmaster. The fact that this Catholic priest would help Jewish children hide in his boarding school, putting him and the school at risk, is a truly courageous thing. This is yet another layer, another detail, giving the film great depth. Because no one is completely innocent, or completely bad, everyone is involved in the tale of wartime survival.""Au Revoir, Les Enfants"" is a heartfelt, masterful film everyone should witness for themselves. Description doesn't do it justice.Malle also worked in American film, creating some interesting stories, the best of which is ""Atlantic City"" starring Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon in an early role.If you haven't experienced the work of Louis Malle, now is the time.

246810,A2GJ98824GGXGP,630121613X,Timothy Kearney,"[6, 7]","AU REVOIRE LES INFANTS is a moving coming  of age film by famed French director Louis Malle. Julien Quentin, the film's protagonist, is a member of a well to do French family. He attends a Catholic boarding school during World War II which is the setting of most of the film. Julien is a sensitive, intelligent twelve year old and is considered by his teachers to be a young man with great promise. He is asked to befriend a new student Jean Bonnet, but this the young Julien finds difficult. Jean is the first student to rival the young Julien academically, and when Jean is taunted by his classmates, Julien fears risking his popularity. Eventually Julien finds in Jean the only student who shares his interests and both understands and shares his precociousness.There are not many surprises in this film. Germany is losing the war and the French know it, which causes the Germans to resort to bullying tactics. Jean is attending the school as a means of escaping the death camps. Eventually the school's harboring of Jews is discovered and the school is closed. Director Louis Malle accepts that viewers will know the story and this allows us to be drawn into the characters. We see good and we see evil, but we also see that blurred line between good and evil that can make any of us ask ourselves what we would do in the same situation. For this reason the film stays with the viewer and can be seen multiple times and each time a new insight can be gained.The critical praise of this film when it was first released is well deserved. Malle captures the atmosphere of France in 1944 perfectly. We see a defeated nation but we see glimpses of its pride returning. The boarding school is accurate and the Catholic back-story is authentic. Yet what makes this film so compelling is the superb acting of the two young actors Gaspard Manesse and  Rafael Fejto as Julien and Jean respectively. Throughout the film Manesse plays Julien with an innocence that is endearing but hidden under the innocence is a sophistication that far exceeds his age. Fejto's  Jean is both frightened and brave and he's able to capture a young man who would be lively and engaging if the circumstances were different.Perhaps the fact that the film is based on Malle's own experiences during the war is the reason for its quality, but it is a moving film that will not soon be forgotten and reminds us that good films, like good novels, have a way of staying with us.",5,A Film That Is Not Easily Forgotten,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2445,"['AU', 'REVOIRE', 'LES', 'INFANTS', 'moving', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'famed', 'French', 'director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'Julien', 'Quentin', 'film', 'protagonist', 'member', 'well', 'do', 'French', 'family', 'Catholic', 'boarding', 'school', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'setting', 'most', 'film', 'Julien', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'considered', 'teachers', 'be', 'young', 'man', 'great', 'promise', 'asked', 'befriend', 'new', 'student', 'Jean', 'Bonnet', 'young', 'Julien', 'difficult', 'Jean', 'first', 'student', 'rival', 'young', 'Julien', 'academically', 'when', 'Jean', 'taunted', 'classmates', 'Julien', 'risking', 'popularity', 'Eventually', 'Julien', 'Jean', 'only', 'student', 'who', 'shares', 'interests', 'understands', 'shares', 'precociousness.There', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'surprises', 'film', 'Germany', 'losing', 'war', 'French', 'know', 'Germans', 'resort', 'bullying', 'tactics', 'Jean', 'attending', 'school', 'means', 'escaping', 'death', 'camps', 'Eventually', 'school', 'harboring', 'Jews', 'discovered', 'school', 'closed', 'Director', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'story', 'be', 'drawn', 'characters', 'see', 'good', 'see', 'evil', 'also', 'see', 'blurred', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'can', 'make', 'ask', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'same', 'situation', 'reason', 'film', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'multiple', 'times', 'time', 'new', 'insight', 'can', 'be', 'gained.The', 'critical', 'praise', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'well', 'deserved', 'Malle', 'atmosphere', 'France', '1944', 'perfectly', 'see', 'defeated', 'nation', 'see', 'glimpses', 'pride', 'returning', 'boarding', 'school', 'accurate', 'Catholic', 'back-story', 'authentic', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'superb', 'acting', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'Gaspard', 'Manesse', 'Rafael', 'Fejto', 'Julien', 'Jean', 'respectively', 'film', 'Manesse', 'Julien', 'innocence', 'endearing', 'hidden', 'innocence', 'sophistication', 'far', 'age', 'Fejto', 'Jean', 'frightened', 'brave', 'able', 'capture', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'lively', 'engaging', 'circumstances', 'were', 'fact', 'film', 'based', 'Malle', 'own', 'experiences', 'war', 'reason', 'quality', 'moving', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten', 'good', 'films', 'good', 'novels', 'have', 'way', 'staying']",Au Revoir Les Enfants VHS
246811,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,630121613X,Z Hayes,"[5, 6]","I have watched numerous World War Two movies, specifically those based on the Holocaust, and this is one gem that deserves a wider audience. The story depicts the exploits of a young French boy, Julien who is sent off to a Catholic boarding school in the countryside by his mother as Paris is deemed too dangerous during World War Two. At school, he encounters a new boy, Jean Bonnet, who doesn't seem to fit in with the other boys. At first the two boys view themselves as rivals in grades, but later, they form a close friendship, made all the more precious due to the secret that Jean harbors. It is a dangerous secret, one which Julien finds out through some sleuthing around, but never detracts from their friendship. This is a story about childhood innocence, and coming of age in a time when the Nazis were in power. A time when one was persecuted simply for being of an undesirable race, even children. A time when even good people who acted based on their conscience were packed off to camps. It is a beautiful movie...there is no graphic violence, but you can sense the evil that permeates the atmosphere throughout the movie...children having to hide during air raids in dark shelters, a man forced to leave a restaurant for being a Jew, and children sent off to their deaths for their racial identity.
