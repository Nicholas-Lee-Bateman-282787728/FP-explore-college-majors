Many of his recordings are controversial, claimed by some to be showy and unmusical. I personally believe it to be professional jealousy. In any case there is generally little doubt that Cziffra had a remarkable virtuoso technique. After watching this DVD, I wonder if his critics have ever listened to him. His Liszt is full of life and it fits completely to the music. His Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6 is absolutely astonishing, yet the central section is very sensitively played. In the more virtuoso pieces, Cziffra really puts the music on fire in the concert study Gnomenreigen seems to be under the effect of steroids! But it is in Chopin that Cziffra shows his music critics have been unfair. The Scherzo and the Improptu are very honestly played, with much spontaneity and no distortion. Even the A flat Polonaise is very controlled yet brilliant. Of course there are better Chopin players, but the items included here sound very pleasant. Georges Cziffra didn't make many recordings due to the death of his son who was also a pianist and a conductor who died in a fire, supposedly a suicide. Georges Cziffra never made another recording after that. As a bonus, EMI includes Benno Moiseiwitsch performing Wagner's Tannhauser Overture in Liszt's transcription. These 15 minutes are worth alone the price of this DVD. The Russian master throws the million note score with elegance and mastery, projecting the themes from the octaves and arpeggios with the most beaultiful singing tone. I own many of the EMI Classic Archive DVD's and this is by far the best DVD I've seen from the Classic Archive Series and no piano lover should miss it.",5,Awesome pianism from two keyboard masters,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",2007,1742,"['became', 'commonplace', 'many', 'music', 'critics', 'dismiss', 'Georges', 'Cziffra', 'brainless', 'noisemaker', 'Many', 'recordings', 'are', 'controversial', 'claimed', 'be', 'showy', 'unmusical', 'personally', 'believe', 'be', 'professional', 'jealousy', 'case', 'generally', 'little', 'doubt', 'Cziffra', 'had', 'remarkable', 'virtuoso', 'technique', 'watching', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'critics', 'have', 'ever', 'listened', 'Liszt', 'full', 'life', 'completely', 'music', 'Hungarian', 'Rhapsody', 'No', '6', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'yet', 'central', 'section', 'very', 'sensitively', 'played', 'more', 'virtuoso', 'pieces', 'Cziffra', 'really', 'music', 'fire', 'concert', 'study', 'Gnomenreigen', 'be', 'effect', 'steroids', 'Chopin', 'Cziffra', 'music', 'critics', 'have', 'been', 'unfair', 'Scherzo', 'Improptu', 'are', 'very', 'honestly', 'played', 'much', 'spontaneity', 'distortion', 'Even', 'A', 'flat', 'Polonaise', 'very', 'controlled', 'yet', 'brilliant', 'course', 'are', 'better', 'Chopin', 'players', 'items', 'included', 'here', 'sound', 'very', 'pleasant', 'Georges', 'Cziffra', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'recordings', 'due', 'death', 'son', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'pianist', 'conductor', 'who', 'died', 'fire', 'supposedly', 'suicide', 'Georges', 'Cziffra', 'never', 'made', 'recording', 'bonus', 'EMI', 'Benno', 'Moiseiwitsch', 'performing', 'Wagner', 'Tannhauser', 'Overture', 'Liszt', 'transcription', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'worth', 'alone', 'price', 'DVD', 'Russian', 'master', 'million', 'note', 'score', 'elegance', 'mastery', 'projecting', 'themes', 'octaves', 'arpeggios', 'most', 'beaultiful', 'singing', 'tone', 'own', 'many', 'EMI', 'Classic', 'Archive', 'DVD', 'far', 'best', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Classic', 'Archive', 'Series', 'piano', 'lover', 'should', 'miss']",N/A

And this is not just evident from his superb Chopin pieces, it is also evident from his Franck and his Lizst. And partly because of his interpretation , his sense of drama is never too strong and his touch is generally light: Even his choice of piano (Pleyel and Gaveau etc) suggests that he is a pianist more poised to delight than to impress. Nevertheless,  his playing is quite modern, and he is quite a structuralist.The sound here is acceptable and the films are not too grainy. There is a lot of depictions of his hands from a perfect point of view. But the camera doesn't particularly cover his hands when we come to the more difficult passages. Moreover, the speed of some of the films is not fast enough to give us a clear view of his hands in action in the fast passages. And yet, his hands and fingers moves even faster than Kissin. Even though that is done without compromising any music at all, but that is done at the expense of blurring the images of his hands for a whole passage a number of times! Fortunately, that consists of only a small proportion of the films only.This DVD is rather short with a running time of only 78 minutes and we have Moiseiwitsch playing Tannhauser as a bonus. Perfect phrasings and articulations with a beautiful tone: with a tiny bit of Hofmann's spontaneity or else Friedmann's originality, EMI would sure issue a solo album for this great artist of the Golden Period of Pianists.",4,A Virtuoso as well as A Poet,1081900800,"04 14, 2004",2004,1544,"['People', 'used', 'associate', 'Cziffra', 'virtuoso', 'instead', 'poet', 'DVD', 'otherwise', 'quite', 'poet', 'not', 'just', 'evident', 'superb', 'Chopin', 'pieces', 'also', 'evident', 'Franck', 'Lizst', 'partly', 'interpretation', 'sense', 'drama', 'never', 'too', 'strong', 'touch', 'generally', 'light', 'Even', 'choice', 'piano', 'Pleyel', 'Gaveau', 'etc', 'pianist', 'more', 'poised', 'delight', 'impress', 'Nevertheless', 'playing', 'quite', 'modern', 'quite', 'structuralist.The', 'sound', 'here', 'acceptable', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'grainy', 'lot', 'depictions', 'hands', 'perfect', 'point', 'view', 'camera', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'cover', 'hands', 'when', 'come', 'more', 'difficult', 'passages', 'Moreover', 'speed', 'films', 'not', 'fast', 'enough', 'give', 'clear', 'view', 'hands', 'action', 'fast', 'passages', 'yet', 'hands', 'fingers', 'moves', 'even', 'faster', 'Kissin', 'Even', 'done', 'compromising', 'music', 'done', 'expense', 'blurring', 'images', 'hands', 'whole', 'passage', 'number', 'times', 'Fortunately', 'only', 'small', 'proportion', 'films', 'only.This', 'DVD', 'rather', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'only', '78', 'minutes', 'have', 'Moiseiwitsch', 'playing', 'Tannhauser', 'bonus', 'Perfect', 'phrasings', 'articulations', 'beautiful', 'tone', 'tiny', 'bit', 'Hofmann', 'spontaneity', 'else', 'Friedmann', 'originality', 'EMI', 'would', 'sure', 'issue', 'solo', 'album', 'great', 'artist', 'Golden', 'Period', 'Pianists']",N/A

Interesting how he sweats profusely when he plays (because of the absolute concentration required to perform such difficult compositions; I sweat a lot too when I play). Cziffra is one of the best interprets of Chopin and Liszt bar none. He really feels the music and knows when to place the dynamics. I especially love his renditions of Chopin's Waltzes.Moiseiwitsch's performance is simply extraordinary. What makes Moiseiwitsch better than the other pianists on this overture? His rhythm. He plays precisely in measure with superb prose and confidence. His accuracy and assuredness mark him as one of the all-time great pianists ever. The Force is with him, and this is way before Lucas coined that term. I would give an arm and a leg to have been the cameraman recording Moiseiwitsch; this would have been one ""job"" I would never--ever--have forgotten.I have just listened again in my car to Maestro Moiseiwitsch's interpretation of the overture. It is as wonderful as when I first heard it. I especially love how he is able to make his left hand ""roar"" like a lion during the crescendos/decrescendos before reaching the main theme. His poise and technique are unmatched; as a self-taught amateur concert pianist, I am soooo jealous.Benno, I love you!Best,Charles D.",5,Outstanding DVD!
