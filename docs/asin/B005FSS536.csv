1459347,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B005FSS536,John J. Schauer,"[4, 4]","This movie's main claim to attention is the fact that it is the only film that starred husband-and-wife team of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford. It was released in 1929, and while it is understandably dated, both in acting style and camera technique, it is an important historical artifact. Unfortunately, it was seriously distorted when attempts were made 37 years later to ""update"" it by adding a new music track and cutting about 9 minutes from a film that was short to begin with. (The version offered here is only one hour and five minutes long.) It becomes immediately apparent in the opening credits, which are in a visual style totally foreign to 1929 Hollywood, set to music that is also anachronistic, and it is confirmed in the credit line that says it was copyrighted in 1966 by Mary Pickford (who was then 74) and Douglas Fairbanks JR. The fact is that very old films such as this are usually of interest only to those who, like myself,  enjoy the look and sound of vintage Hollywood films; the cosmetic disfigurement that was perpetrated to try to increase its appeal is probably nowhere near enough to make the film palatable to those who want something more ""updated."" It would have been much better had they actually restored the picture quality, which in this version ranges from so-so to poor. All in all, a thoroughly misguided tampering that should be indicated prominently on the cover of this disappointingly mutilated edition.
