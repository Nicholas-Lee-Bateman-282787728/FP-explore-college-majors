Dean Cain was fantastic, you could truly see the good in his eyes. I tried to get into Smallville but until the end of the show didn't really care for it; I had a hard time buying Tom Welling as a good person his eyes were cold and vain most of the time. Maybe that was the intent of the creators to make him more human. To me Clark Kent was supposed to be very modest and even though he was Superman was not supposed to think he was one.

1016711,AKOZ8T5S6DFEF,B000HWZ4BG,Brad,"[23, 25]","Well, Ive watched all 4 boxsets in their entirety, all 88 episodes, including the bonus material.  Most fans love the show so I wont get into why its so wonderful and the great chemistry between Dean and Teri, blah blah blah.  Lets get right on to it.  Whats the best material and what, if any, are the problems plaguing the boxsets?There are 3 things that are completely worth your attention, and the majority of it is on season 1.  The commentary for the pilot, and the 30 minute looking back documentary.  The other commentary is on season 2 and its on Deans Season's Greedings episode.  Aside from that, the effort put forth as a whole for bonus material on these 4 boxsets is pathetic.  There is plenty of other stuff out there that they could of included.  ABC promos for every episode exist as well as other spots that appeared to promote the show, and none of it appears on these boxsets.  There is also no comments on the wedding arc in season 3, and nothing to explain the shows untimely demise in the 4th season boxset.  It's simply pathetic.The 4th box needed to explain what was planned for season 5 had the show continued, and none of it is explained at all.How is the transfer and sound??  Seasons 2,3, and 4 look fantastic all throughout.  However, season 1 gets the lowest grade in the video department.  The pilot, though crisp, has all sorts of source defects and dirt present.  Also, several episodes following the pilot, look too soft and muddy in its picture and detail and color.  This significantly improves though by the time you reach the latter half of disc 3 and on to disc 4.  The sound is standard; nothing too impressive.Finally, lets talk about the packaging and any other problems related to the dvd's themselves.  The covers work for me, though id say season 1 is the best.  It has a chrome appearance that is just really impressive.  All the others are a dull cardboard.  What they did inside each box has driven me nuts since season 1 was released.  The discs are packaged practically stacked on top of each other.  They overlap; which means that if you want to get to disc 2, you have to pry disc 1 up out of the box in order to get to disc 2.  That is just ridiculous, and for those who arent especially careful with their purchase, it can be really easy to scratch the discs in this format.  While my wife and I have been watching the series in order, I just remove disc 1 from the box and lay it aside in another case so that I have a space freed up for the other discs in the boxset so I can get to everything easier.  That has worked for me.  Though it is annoying that I have to move discs around in the first place.  I would have preferred the WB package them like a book with one disc per tray, but thats just me.  Also, the first 2 seasons feature a moving main menu screen which was really impressive.  The WB then decided that for the last 2 seasons they would cut costs and use a static main menu screen; STUPID AND INCONSISTENT!!  All 4 should match.  They really dropped the ball with their season 4 package in that it was reported that many packages contained duplicate discs!!  One fellow had to exchange his 6 times until he found a package that had a disc 1 in it!!  Fortunately my copy had no such issues.  However I had to exchange it one time due to a severelly damaged disc that I hadnt even touched.Overall a great package, a great show.  The extras that are there are good but missing tons of stuff.  The packaging is less than I would want, but go buy this anyway.  If you are careful with the discs, you shouldnt have any problem.",5,"Great show, but some issues with the dvd sets themselves",1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,3593,"['Well', 'Ive', 'watched', '4', 'boxsets', 'entirety', '88', 'episodes', 'including', 'bonus', 'material', 'Most', 'fans', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'wont', 'get', 'why', 'so', 'wonderful', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Dean', 'Teri', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Lets', 'get', 'right', 'best', 'material', 'what', 'are', 'problems', 'plaguing', 'boxsets', 'are', '3', 'things', 'are', 'completely', 'attention', 'majority', 'season', '1', 'commentary', 'pilot', '30', 'minute', 'looking', 'back', 'documentary', 'other', 'commentary', 'season', '2', 'Deans', 'Season', 'Greedings', 'episode', 'Aside', 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'whole', 'bonus', 'material', '4', 'boxsets', 'pathetic', 'plenty', 'other', 'stuff', 'there', 'could', 'included', 'ABC', 'promos', 'episode', 'exist', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'spots', 'appeared', 'promote', 'show', 'none', 'boxsets', 'also', 'comments', 'wedding', 'arc', 'season', '3', 'nothing', 'explain', 'shows', 'untimely', 'demise', '4th', 'season', 'boxset', 'simply', 'pathetic.The', '4th', 'box', 'needed', 'explain', 'what', 'was', 'planned', 'season', '5', 'had', 'show', 'continued', 'none', 'explained', 'all.How', 'transfer', 'sound', 'Seasons', '2,3', '4', 'look', 'fantastic', 'However', 'season', '1', 'lowest', 'grade', 'video', 'department', 'pilot', 'crisp', 'sorts', 'source', 'defects', 'dirt', 'present', 'Also', 'several', 'episodes', 'following', 'pilot', 'look', 'too', 'soft', 'muddy', 'picture', 'detail', 'color', 'significantly', 'time', 'reach', 'latter', 'half', 'disc', '3', 'disc', '4', 'sound', 'standard', 'nothing', 'too', 'impressive.Finally', 'talk', 'packaging', 'other', 'problems', 'related', 'dvd', 'covers', 'work', 'id', 'say', 'season', '1', 'best', 'chrome', 'appearance', 'just', 'really', 'impressive', 'others', 'are', 'dull', 'cardboard', 'What', 'did', 'inside', 'box', 'driven', 'nuts', 'season', '1', 'was', 'released', 'discs', 'are', 'packaged', 'practically', 'stacked', 'top', 'other', 'overlap', 'want', 'get', 'disc', '2', 'have', 'pry', 'disc', '1', 'box', 'order', 'get', 'disc', '2', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'who', 'arent', 'especially', 'careful', 'purchase', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'easy', 'scratch', 'discs', 'format', 'wife', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'order', 'just', 'remove', 'disc', '1', 'box', 'lay', 'aside', 'case', 'have', 'space', 'freed', 'up', 'other', 'discs', 'boxset', 'can', 'get', 'everything', 'easier', 'worked', 'annoying', 'have', 'move', 'discs', 'first', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'WB', 'package', 'book', 'one', 'disc', 'tray', 'just', 'Also', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'feature', 'moving', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'was', 'really', 'impressive', 'WB', 'then', 'decided', 'last', '2', 'seasons', 'would', 'cut', 'costs', 'use', 'static', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'STUPID', 'INCONSISTENT', '4', 'should', 'match', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'season', '4', 'package', 'was', 'reported', 'many', 'packages', 'contained', 'duplicate', 'discs', 'One', 'fellow', 'had', 'exchange', '6', 'times', 'found', 'package', 'had', 'disc', '1', 'Fortunately', 'copy', 'had', 'such', 'issues', 'However', 'had', 'exchange', 'one', 'time', 'due', 'severelly', 'damaged', 'disc', 'hadnt', 'even', 'touched.Overall', 'great', 'package', 'great', 'show', 'extras', 'are', 'are', 'good', 'missing', 'tons', 'stuff', 'packaging', 'less', 'would', 'want', 'go', 'buy', 'anyway', 'are', 'careful', 'discs', 'shouldnt', 'have', 'problem']","Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman - The Complete Series, Season 1 - 4"

1016713,AUCISQA1YXX86,B000HWZ4BG,Confederate,"[3, 9]","""Lois and Clark"" was a light-hearted comedy that centered more around the Clark Kent persona of the Superman sagas. As a superhero, Superman was always overladen with super powers and, as such, was a boor unless someone had the Kryptonite to go after him. I remember years ago, Superman had a race around the world against the Flash. The Flash had only one power, and that was extraordinary speed, but D.C. Comics could never bring themselves to give the race to the Flash, so they made it a draw--a cheap niggardly thing to do to poor Flash. Could not Superman have simply said, ""I'm fast, pal, but you're way out of my league!"" No, they couldn't even give the laurel wreath to poor Flash! Fortunately, in these seasons of Lois and Clark, a more lighthearted approach was taken.""Smallville"" always bored the living daylights out of me. It was far too touchy-feely for my tastes and could have been full of bullies, field trips to the big city, practical jokes on farmers (having steel implements appear bent into pretzel shapes and left in various places in about town and the local environ), but that would have required more creativity than was available. It also could have been set back in the early 40s, which would have given it a fun backdrop.Anyway, Dean Cain was great, as well as Miss ""they're real"" Hatcher. This is quite a deal. If you've never seen the show, lucky you.

1016714,A3GS7XVYAK31QT,B000HWZ4BG,David Heeren,"[0, 0]","I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime.One of my favorites is Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. I missed this show the first time around because on the night its pilot was aired, I watched a more highly-publicized pilot. I was hooked after watching the reruns once, then again and again. Then, when the DVDs came out I went out and bought them and watched all four seasons several more times.This show features brilliant color schemes reminiscent of the original color comics. Teri Hatcher, brilliant, scheming, but sometimes bumbling, is delectable as the best Lois Lane ever. Dean Cain is a strong, yet sensitive Clark Kent/Superman. Kent&#8217;s parents are credible characters, as are Lane Smith as Perry White and Justin Whalen as Jimmy Olson.The bad guys are familiar and diabolic. The story lines are intense.This show truly reflects the high-spirited optimism of the old comic books, as opposed to the new Superman and Batman movies, which are so dark you can hardly see them without a flashlight. In my opinion this show should have endured fourteen seasons instead of four.Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7.

Overall, the picture and audio quality are good but remastered episodes would be great in a future release. Some special features, such as commentaries, interviews and documentaries are available for each season although more could have been added to explain what was planned for Season 5 before the untimely cancellation of the series. There remain some loose ends story-wise that would make for an interesting future documentary (like many great TV series that ended before their time). While I loved the chemistry between Hatcher and Cain for the entire run, I felt the first two seasons were the best because after Clark let the cat out of the bag at the end of season 2 the writing fizzled out somewhat. The tension of Clark's secret identity while pursuing Lois made for great viewing.

Comparing it to the newer Superman show &#34;Smallville&#34; is not a direction I would go at all. They are in no way the same. &#34;Smallville&#34; is good for a more modern Superman and what he went through to become who he does but &#34;Lois & Clark&#34; is something all it's own.
