I would be doing my work on my laptop while my wife watched it. Well, when Mary McDonnell made her appearance, her voice startled me, in the way a familiar, desirable sound would. Her whole attire - but especially her glasses - commanded respect, I felt as if I were in her presence, it was really spellbinding for me.  Her character (and by extension, she) exhibits a rare blend of sweetness  and elegance that I thought Brenda lacked.  In any case, the relationship between the women is priceless (going into it here would take several paragraphs so I'll refrain), I watched several episodes repeatedly.

1353336,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B003L77GWY,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[1, 1]","The sixth season of ""The Closer"" remains a favorite of mine. The changing relationships, the ruffled feathers caused by Captain Raydor (Mary McDonnell)gives Brenda a character that she can butt heads with that is every bit her equal (except for rank)and there's a game changing episode involving a gangbanger, the murder of two people at a store and Brenda's decision at the end to let him go that sets up the big conflict of season sixth AND demonstrates a shift in her character.As with the previous seasons Warner Home Video has done a nice job with the tranfer here--it looks quite nice with bold colors, nice detail, etc. Audio also sounds quite strong with a nice use of surround speakers in some of the more action driven sequences of the show.While many fans could care less about commentary tracks I like them--they can make an episode fresh (with the right people on the commentary track)and give us interesting insight into how difficult or easy it was to pull off a particular episode. Sadly there aren't any here which has been a flaw of every season of ""The Closer"" on DVD. Perhaps they are going to roll some out for Blu-ray (which hopefully we'll see one of these days although it doesn't appear to be too big a priority for Warner when it comes to this show)but, given that the show is wrapping with the seventh season, it would be nice if they included a commentary track or two at some point.As with the previous seasons we get deleted scenes for selected episodes and a gag reel. We do get a nice featurette ""Kyra Sedgwick Open Up About The Closer"" allowing the actress to open up about her take her character and the series.Over all this is a fine set although I do have to question WHY Warner's art department decided to airbrush the picture of Sedgwick on the cover--she's a beautiful 40 something and cleaning up the lines on her face seems rather odd particularly given that none of the other cast members were subjected to that. She looks great the way she is (and I'm sure Kevin Bacon her husband would agree) so why not let us see her the way nature intended?Highly recommended.",5,"Game changing sixth season is one of the finest of ""The Closer"".",1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,2106,"['sixth', 'season', 'Closer', 'favorite', 'mine', 'changing', 'relationships', 'ruffled', 'feathers', 'caused', 'Captain', 'Raydor', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Brenda', 'character', 'can', 'butt', 'heads', 'bit', 'equal', 'rank', 'game', 'changing', 'episode', 'involving', 'gangbanger', 'murder', 'two', 'people', 'store', 'Brenda', 'decision', 'end', 'let', 'go', 'up', 'big', 'conflict', 'season', 'sixth', 'AND', 'shift', 'character.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'tranfer', 'here', 'quite', 'nice', 'bold', 'colors', 'nice', 'detail', 'etc', 'Audio', 'also', 'quite', 'strong', 'nice', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'more', 'action', 'driven', 'sequences', 'show.While', 'many', 'fans', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'like', 'can', 'make', 'episode', 'fresh', 'right', 'people', 'commentary', 'track', 'give', 'interesting', 'insight', 'how', 'difficult', 'easy', 'was', 'pull', 'off', 'particular', 'episode', 'Sadly', 'are', ""n't"", 'here', 'been', 'flaw', 'season', 'Closer', 'DVD', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'going', 'roll', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'one', 'days', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'too', 'big', 'priority', 'Warner', 'when', 'show', 'given', 'show', 'wrapping', 'seventh', 'season', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'included', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'point.As', 'previous', 'seasons', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'selected', 'episodes', 'gag', 'reel', 'do', 'get', 'nice', 'featurette', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Open', 'Up', 'Closer', 'allowing', 'actress', 'open', 'up', 'take', 'character', 'series.Over', 'fine', 'set', 'do', 'have', 'question', 'WHY', 'Warner', 'art', 'department', 'decided', 'airbrush', 'picture', 'Sedgwick', 'cover', 'beautiful', '40', 'something', 'cleaning', 'up', 'lines', 'face', 'rather', 'odd', 'particularly', 'given', 'none', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'subjected', 'great', 'way', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'husband', 'would', 'agree', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'let', 'see', 'way', 'nature', 'intended', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
