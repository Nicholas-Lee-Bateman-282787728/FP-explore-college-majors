Jenn Gotzon was fabulous in the lead role and watching her character's transformation throughout the film was a joy to watch. She was very believable in the dramatic moments and her comic timing was fabulous! The rest of the cast were equally as good and had wonderful chemistry. Gib Gerard was an excellent foil and love interest to Jenn's character and you know that Michael Toland and Daniel Hugh Kelly are seasoned actors who had superb performances. The exuberance of Lenny (Kelvin Brown) and the sweet, idealistic Geri (Stephanie Barnes) really stood out to me and I also loved Meghan's mom (Suzanne Ford). Well done to all of the cast! I also want to say how impressed I was with director Chris Armstrong. Some of the scenes he captured were absolutely stunning, and the entire film was outstanding. This was a fun film that had a message of faith, but filled with characters you knew would stand firm in their trust in God no matter what.",5,God's Country,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,985,"['film', 'more', 'exceeded', 'hopes', 'Jenn', 'Gotzon', 'was', 'fabulous', 'lead', 'role', 'watching', 'character', 'transformation', 'film', 'was', 'joy', 'watch', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'comic', 'timing', 'was', 'fabulous', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'equally', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Gib', 'Gerard', 'was', 'excellent', 'foil', 'love', 'interest', 'Jenn', 'character', 'know', 'Michael', 'Toland', 'Daniel', 'Hugh', 'Kelly', 'are', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'superb', 'performances', 'exuberance', 'Lenny', 'Kelvin', 'Brown', 'sweet', 'idealistic', 'Geri', 'Stephanie', 'Barnes', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'also', 'loved', 'Meghan', 'mom', 'Suzanne', 'Ford', 'Well', 'done', 'cast', 'also', 'want', 'say', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'director', 'Chris', 'Armstrong', 'scenes', 'captured', 'were', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'fun', 'film', 'had', 'message', 'faith', 'filled', 'characters', 'knew', 'would', 'stand', 'firm', 'trust', 'God', 'matter', 'what']",God's Country
1586211,A32U6577WUD9L5,B00960EHT0,"Donald James. Parker ""Author""","[0, 0]","In this flick, star Jenn Gotzon plays a successful investment banker who receives an assignment that forces her to question whether the financial victories in her life are worth the cost of precluding a life of real love. Her idea of expressing love is to write a big check or buy an expensive present. The mission, should she decide to accept it, is to discover the importance of relationships, especially one with God.The acting was very good. Of course, Jenn Gotzon was stellar, but she had lots of help. The rest of the cast, which seemed to be comprised of all Hollywood actors, delivered satisfactory performances, which we should expect from a team coming from the fiercely competitive secular world of acting.  Gib Gerard, one of the stars, features a pair of intense eyes, which I discovered through IMDB research that he inherited from his mother, Connie Sellecca. I especially enjoyed the performances of Stephanie Barnes and Michael Toland. I think Stephanie, who was performing in her first feature film, has a bright future. This is the kind of acting that I expect from most Indie Christian films in the near future. God will either enhance and anoint the skill set of those currently acting in Indie films, raise up His children who are not getting the opportunity to act now, or will pull people from the Hollywood ranks to deliver his messages. The days when ""Christian films"" are noticeably substandard will come to an end as the genre and personnel involved mature, although some people may be reticent to acknowledge that rise to excellence. This movie is a good example of that maturation process.Jenn Gotzon's husband, Chris Armstrong, did an admirable job as the director of his first feature film. The cinematography was excellent. The mountain desert features some wonderful sunrises and sunsets, and the DP of this film captured them both in addition to awesome skies and landscapes. The music is good, but mostly stays in the background, where it should be.  The plot certainly was not original, but had some good twists. The story presents a good balance of faith, humor, emotion, stimulating dialogue, and romance. What is there not to like if you're a believer in a sovereign Heavenly Father and His son Jesus Christ? If you're not, this wonderful movie might rub you the wrong way, not because it is not tastefully done, but because some people are offended by the gospel of love no matter how it is presented. If you're in the ranks of those offended by Jesus, you need to spend some time in God's Country.",5,This is a keeper!,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,2539,"['flick', 'star', 'Jenn', 'Gotzon', 'successful', 'investment', 'banker', 'who', 'assignment', 'question', 'financial', 'victories', 'life', 'are', 'cost', 'precluding', 'life', 'real', 'love', 'idea', 'expressing', 'love', 'write', 'big', 'check', 'buy', 'expensive', 'present', 'mission', 'should', 'decide', 'accept', 'discover', 'importance', 'relationships', 'especially', 'one', 'God.The', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'course', 'Jenn', 'Gotzon', 'was', 'stellar', 'had', 'lots', 'help', 'rest', 'cast', 'seemed', 'be', 'comprised', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'delivered', 'satisfactory', 'performances', 'should', 'expect', 'team', 'coming', 'fiercely', 'competitive', 'secular', 'world', 'acting', 'Gib', 'Gerard', 'one', 'stars', 'pair', 'intense', 'eyes', 'discovered', 'IMDB', 'research', 'inherited', 'mother', 'Connie', 'Sellecca', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Stephanie', 'Barnes', 'Michael', 'Toland', 'think', 'Stephanie', 'who', 'was', 'performing', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'bright', 'future', 'kind', 'acting', 'expect', 'most', 'Indie', 'Christian', 'films', 'near', 'future', 'God', 'will', 'either', 'enhance', 'anoint', 'skill', 'set', 'currently', 'acting', 'Indie', 'films', 'raise', 'up', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'act', 'now', 'will', 'pull', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'ranks', 'deliver', 'messages', 'days', 'when', 'Christian', 'films', 'are', 'noticeably', 'substandard', 'will', 'come', 'end', 'genre', 'personnel', 'involved', 'mature', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'reticent', 'acknowledge', 'rise', 'excellence', 'movie', 'good', 'example', 'maturation', 'Gotzon', 'husband', 'Chris', 'Armstrong', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'director', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'cinematography', 'was', 'excellent', 'mountain', 'desert', 'wonderful', 'sunrises', 'sunsets', 'DP', 'film', 'captured', 'addition', 'awesome', 'skies', 'landscapes', 'music', 'good', 'mostly', 'background', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'plot', 'certainly', 'was', 'not', 'original', 'had', 'good', 'twists', 'story', 'good', 'balance', 'faith', 'humor', 'emotion', 'stimulating', 'dialogue', 'romance', 'What', 'there', 'not', 'like', ""'re"", 'believer', 'sovereign', 'Heavenly', 'Father', 'son', 'Jesus', 'Christ', ""'re"", 'not', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'might', 'rub', 'wrong', 'way', 'not', 'not', 'tastefully', 'done', 'people', 'are', 'offended', 'gospel', 'love', 'matter', 'how', 'presented', ""'re"", 'ranks', 'offended', 'Jesus', 'need', 'spend', 'time', 'God', 'Country']",God's Country
1586212,A1XD0C8DTUF998,B00960EHT0,"Dr. Fred ""Dr. Fred""","[12, 13]","One of the things that plagues independently made films of faith is that without big studio backing there will be problems with such things as lighting, editing, music and sadly even acting.  There is no such problem with this film, it is positively brilliant and I have had the privilege of reviewing faith based and family films for years.  This is a film that should have been featured in theaters as there is a wide open expanse of beauty that harks back to the great old days of the John Ford epics.  Of course this is not a Western though it takes place in Western style territory.  There are also scenes in the metropolis of LA and here is one of the areas the film shines in.  You are taken back and forth from city to country, intercutting between scenes in a style often over looked in films today.  Certainly the director Chris Armstrong, who put this together, deserves credit for knowing his craft.  However, I have to single out one element in particular.  Though the over all cast is good, this is a Jenn Gotzon film and were this theatrical we would be talking Oscar.  Jenn Gotzon  plays a top notch business woman who knows the art of the deal and is at the pinnacle of the ladder of success.  Her assignment is to talk a preacher and his family into giving up his land, his dream, which is used as a campo for young people.  The preacher challenges Jenn to wait six days and during this time... well I don't want to be a spoiler.  I will just say that seldom has an actress had to make herself believable in so many settings and she pulls it off in the style of the great actresses during Hollywood's Golden Age.  Of course it is a faith based film and you will see the hand of God throughout the story.  The film is a miracle itself and I am thankful it was shown in a special preview screening.  I will say I am not alone in my opinion as the film drew the audience in a way I have seldom heard of and there was applause at the end.",5,"God's Country, an Excellent Film of Inspiration",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1952,"['One', 'things', 'plagues', 'independently', 'made', 'films', 'faith', 'big', 'studio', 'backing', 'will', 'be', 'problems', 'such', 'things', 'lighting', 'editing', 'music', 'sadly', 'even', 'acting', 'such', 'problem', 'film', 'positively', 'brilliant', 'have', 'had', 'privilege', 'reviewing', 'faith', 'based', 'family', 'films', 'years', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'theaters', 'wide', 'open', 'expanse', 'beauty', 'back', 'great', 'old', 'days', 'John', 'Ford', 'epics', 'course', 'not', 'Western', 'place', 'Western', 'style', 'territory', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'metropolis', 'LA', 'here', 'one', 'areas', 'film', 'shines', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'forth', 'city', 'country', 'intercutting', 'scenes', 'style', 'often', 'looked', 'films', 'today', 'Certainly', 'director', 'Chris', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'credit', 'knowing', 'craft', 'However', 'have', 'single', 'out', 'one', 'element', 'particular', 'cast', 'good', 'Jenn', 'Gotzon', 'film', 'were', 'theatrical', 'would', 'be', 'talking', 'Oscar', 'Jenn', 'Gotzon', 'top', 'notch', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'art', 'deal', 'pinnacle', 'ladder', 'success', 'assignment', 'talk', 'preacher', 'family', 'giving', 'up', 'land', 'dream', 'used', 'campo', 'young', 'people', 'preacher', 'Jenn', 'wait', 'six', 'days', 'time', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiler', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'seldom', 'actress', 'had', 'make', 'believable', 'so', 'many', 'settings', 'off', 'style', 'great', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'course', 'faith', 'based', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'hand', 'God', 'story', 'film', 'miracle', 'am', 'thankful', 'was', 'shown', 'special', 'preview', 'screening', 'will', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'opinion', 'film', 'drew', 'audience', 'way', 'have', 'seldom', 'heard', 'was', 'applause', 'end']",God's Country
