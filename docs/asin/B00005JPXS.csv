658452,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPXS,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 7]","A terrific tale for children, `The Spiderwick Chronicles' shows the plight of a NYC family moving into an old, decrepit house in the country while the children discover an ancient book that brings faeries, ogres, and sprites to life. Led by chief, Mulgarith (Nick Nolte), the ogres try to steal the chronicles from Simon, Jared, (both played by Freddie Highmore) and Mallory (Sarah Bolger) while Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen), a hideous changing forms leader, tries to destroy the children. Enchanting, transporting, and whimsical, 'The Spiderwick Chronicles' aims to please, even as it might be a bit too frightful for the wee little ones.Merits:1.) The movie's a whimsical throwback to the stellar Spielberg days of `E.T.' and `Gremlins' with Highmore more than a passing resemblance to Elliott (Henry Thomas).  Thumblejack (Martin Short) is a charming (if not high strung) original.2.) Faeries, ogres, and sprites have their day once more in big screen splendor.3.) The haunting gives the house a personality, reminiscent of the quality of `Monster House' and `Poltergeist'.  Suspension of belief is in high size (as are the special effects).4.) Excellent portal for the imagination with a good plug for the magical powers of books.5.) The screen presence of David Strathairn (as past portal figure Arthur Spiderwick) and believable performances all around.Demerits:1.)  Some of the film's elements are familiar.2.) It could provide too many nightmares for parents with lingering images of tomato sauce splattered on the walls with holes poked through them.

Simon and Jared are twins (played by the impressive Freddie Highmore)2. It doesn't take the kids long to find a secret room, a locked chest and a book marked ""Do NOT read""3. You can guess what happens next4. Up pops a tiny Brownie named Thimbletack (Martin Short) who changes into a Boggart when riled up.5. He gets riled up a lot6. There's an evil Ogre named Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) who commands an army of Goblins, and really, really wants the aforementioned book7. The Ogre can change his appearance, and is at his most frightening when he looks like Nick Nolte.8. During the machinations and shenanigans to protect the book, the kids meet a scene stealing Hobgoblin named Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen) who has a talent for expectorating and a penchant for bipedal, endothermic vertebrate animals that lay eggs (also known as birds)9. The kids set off on a quest to find the author of the book, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn)10. When they get back, they have to quickly work out a strategy for repelling Goblins and an Ogre who looks like the Grinch on steroids.11. Exciting yet somewhat disturbing altercation ensues12. Just desserts are served for the grand finale.The movie is based on the five books that make up The Spiderwick Chronicles, but barely touches book three,Lucinda's Secretand never touches book four,The Ironwood Tree.  There are a few small differences, but for the most part the movie captures the spirit of the series.Relatively short, it's ideal for kids from around ten or so, as there are some mildly scary scenes and one close to the end that could be disturbing until the twist is revealed.It's also recommended that you get the series for your young `uns.  The books are short, easy to read and full of magical and fantastical adventures.

658455,AUJEF31CXWTCQ,B00005JPXS,Amazon Customer,"[4, 6]","Having read and enjoyed the books, I was surprised by some aspects of the Spiderwick movie. A warning to parents of children 9 and under: this movie is quite scary, and contains violence - yes, violence. There are many sword slashing scenes which feature puncturing, slashing, biting and blood. While most of the blood is monster (green) blood, Spiderwick also features scenes which reveal monster bites that make the monsters much more scarier and real than your average children's flick.Another disappointing aspect to Spiderwick is the portrayal of the father. The father is seen as cold, uncaring, and unloving. The father cheats on his wife, abandons her, and abandons the children - even at the end of the movie. Lastly, there is a scene in which it appears that the father has come to the rescue, but in reality, the father is actually a hideous monster in disguise.Why Spiderwick goes out of its way to portray fathers in such a very negative light to such a young and impressionable audience baffles me. This is careless, cruel and irresponsible.The movie could have easily - by a country mile - left the blood, violence and father bashing out, and Spiderwick would have been a 5 star movie. With the ""junk"" left in, it was 3 stars at best.In conclusion, I wouldn't say this is a movie for children under 10 unless a parent is involved. My younger daughter was scared to death by what was taking place on screen.

While this isn't bad, it turns the other children into sidekicks, whose lines mostly consist of ""what should we do, Jared?"" It's particularly frustrating that the book authors gave children an active, athletic female character -- instead of the bookish Hermione Granger types who are more common -- and the producers took her away, for the most part.Still, it's an enjoyable film, particularly for elementary school aged children.

And what is with the cuter walking off into the sunset type ending running a chivalrous exit.Because Blu-ray is just a standard now and everything is made in it there is no reason to go in to the intricacies.

658470,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPXS,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 7]","Visually appealing even if the story deviated significantly from the novels, THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES is bound to entertain young and old alike (but perhaps more the old).Starting with the visuals, Tippet Studios and ILM worked exceptionally well together to put out some very vivid visual effects. The creature creations were both interesting and sometimes creepy and since this was a large part of what we see as the audience, I found that I was pretty well glued to my TV screen as I watched the DVD.Although the kids in the film are much older than the kids in the books, I found this change acceptable and not irritating like some Spiderwick purists (and I think it's okay to be a purist as long as you look at the film as a whole and not in snippets).The story is that of the Grace family and their inheritance of an old mansion belonging to a (supposedly) deceased family member, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn,Good Night, and Good Luck). Strange things abound inside and outside this seemingly ancient place. But Helen Grace (Mary-Louise Parker,Weeds) isn't interested so much in the place as she is getting away from her husband who's run off and left her with their three children. Mallory (Sarah Bolger) is the eldest and is the only daughter. Jared and Simon (Freddie Highmore,The Golden Compass) are twin boys but couldn't be more different. Simon is a self-proclaimed pacifist, while Jared is the belligerent and self absorbed one who finds the new home initially appalling and can't wait to be picked up by his father.The house eventually reveals its secretive past: a place where Arthur Spiderwick discovered we humans are not alone in the world. Beautiful and sometimes terrible things lurk in our periphery -- and sometimes they are combined. This combination is quickly revealed when Jared finds a special reference book written by Mr. Spiderwick that explains each creature that hides in this peripheral land. With the book comes great danger. Knowledge of them is the primary problem, unless these special creatures want you to see them. And such is the case with Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who initially is supposed to protect this book from prying eyes but fails to keep it out of Jared's hands. Thimbletack can also change from a caring creature to one of great disrespect and upset when things don't go the way he plans (note: keep honey nearby to reverse this process). But Thimbletack isn't the problem; it's Mulgarath (Nick Nolte,Peaceful Warrior), an ogre that desires the book and its secrets so that it can rule everyone and everything. And with him are his goblins and beasts that are tenacious in their pursuit of the book.But can three kids convince their mother that this newfound world is real? And dangerous? Looking through rounded stones and getting ""spit in your eye"" helps to see them, but what of Mulgarath, the shape-shifting ogre that learns many secrets when pages from the Chronicles are ripped out and passed on to him?The Grace's new house becomes the battleground, and the kids realize they need help and information. So they head out to see their great Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright,Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont) who has been confined to a looney bin ever since she revealed to those around her that her father (Arthur Spiderwick) had been abducted by some of the creatures in this nearly invisible realm. Geared up with new and important ideas on how to fight Mulgarath and his legions, the Grace kids race back home and prepare for battle (which includes salt and tomatoes ...are we making pasta here?). But can the kids win against overwhelming odds? Of course they can ...with a little help from unknown quarters (gryphons, old men who aren't old, and Hogsqueal, a bizarre being with an infatuation for birds).Most important to this story is that it is a modern one. It isn't ancient history or trying to be old-English style. There are cell phones and new cars and plenty of modern items that let the audience know when and where they are.The acting is okay, but Joan Plowright shines as the superstar even though she's not given much screen time. I'm pretty fond of Freddie Highmore and his performances inAugust RushandCharlie and the Chocolate Factory, but here he was just ""okay.""The big winners in every sense, though, were the special effects and the scenery. It really pulled the viewer in and made you believe in the things you were seeing; no small task nowadays.I would warn parents, though, that the PG rating is very well deserved. The violence is ever-present, as are the stabbings of small, evil creatures. It could also be a bit unnerving for kids to see a young boy being dragged off into the wilds by initially invisible creatures. Just a warning for those with real young ones.Besides that, this is a very good film. Something to watch for on Blu-Ray disc since the visuals are so stunning.",4,Here's Spit In Your Eye!,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,4879,"['Visually', 'appealing', 'even', 'story', 'deviated',

658472,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B00005JPXS,Brian E. Erland,"[5, 5]","The '08 film `The Spiderwick Chronicles' is an exciting, exhilarating, enchanting and at times surprisingly eerie tale that absolutely bowled me over! There's nothing I enjoy more than a tale dealing with the denizens of the ""Secret Commonweath"" consisting of the elves, fairies, sylphs, goblins, trolls and the rest of the mythic creatures that move unseen behind every flower and stone, or on occasion a dusty book in the library for that matter.There's not much in this movie that one could honestly point to as a totally original idea. Upon viewing `The Spiderwick Chronicles' one will immediately recognize the numerous bits and pieces of storyline borrowed from a rather broad spectrum of other well-known fantasy and horror films.On the lighter side of the tale we see glimpses from such beloved family films as; `The Neverending Story' from '84, `Labyrinth from '86 and of course the immensely successful `Harry Potter' series.However the plot of `The Spiderwick Chronicles' deals predominantly with the darker aspects of the Fairy Realm and this unexpected dark side of the film is what ultimately fascinates and beguiles its audience. The more children friendly films mentioned above are counterbalanced with cinematic aspects found in some surprisingly frightening adult films. You'll find overt correlations with such movies as; the legendary cult classic `Night of the Living Dead' from `68` and the '87 teen favorite `The Lost Boys'.However the greatest source of inspiration for this storyline surely must have been an obscure little film from '03 titled `Inhabited'. In fact there are simply too many similarities for it to be a nothing more than a coincidence.Having said all this let me also say that I don't share these similarities to dissuade you from viewing this film. I share it as an observation and nothing more. Afterall there's nothing new under the sun that hasn't been done before so the goal is to take what's already there and do it better and that's just what `The Spiderwick Chronicles' accomplishes. The film grabbed my rapt attention from the beginning and never let up. There's absolutely nothing I didn't enjoy about this film which is sure to become a classic in the years ahead.Message to Parents: If you have small children who want to watch this please take the time to view it with them. The goblins and troll will appear quite frigntening to a young audience so be forewarned.Postscript: Also remember to keep plenty of honey on hand and don't forget tomato sauce kills goblins.",5,"""A Gift Only A Hobgoblin Can Bestow""",1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,2522,"[""'08"", 'film', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'exciting', 'exhilarating', 'enchanting', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'eerie', 'tale', 'absolutely', 'bowled', 'nothing', 'enjoy', 'more', 'tale', 'dealing', 'denizens', 'Secret', 'Commonweath', 'consisting', 'elves', 'fairies', 'sylphs', 'goblins', 'trolls', 'rest', 'mythic', 'creatures', 'move', 'unseen', 'flower', 'stone', 'occasion', 'dusty', 'book', 'library', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'honestly', 'point', 'totally', 'original', 'idea', 'viewing', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'one', 'will', 'immediately', 'recognize', 'numerous', 'bits', 'pieces', 'storyline', 'borrowed', 'rather', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'other', 'well-known', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'films.On', 'lighter', 'side', 'tale', 'see', 'glimpses', 'such', 'beloved', 'family', 'films', 'Neverending', 'Story', ""'84"", 'Labyrinth', ""'86"", 'course', 'immensely', 'successful', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series.However', 'plot', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'deals', 'predominantly', 'darker', 'aspects', 'Fairy', 'Realm', 'unexpected', 'dark', 'side', 'film', 'what', 'ultimately', 'audience', 'more', 'children', 'friendly', 'films', 'mentioned', 'are', 'counterbalanced', 'cinematic', 'aspects', 'found', 'surprisingly', 'frightening', 'adult', 'films', ""'ll"", 'find', 'overt', 'correlations', 'such', 'movies', 'legendary', 'cult', 'classic', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '68', ""'87"", 'teen', 'favorite', 'Lost', ""Boys'.However"", 'greatest', 'source', 'inspiration', 'storyline', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'obscure', 'little', 'film', 'titled', 'Inhabited', 'fact', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'similarities', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'coincidence.Having', 'said', 'let', 'also', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'share', 'similarities', 'dissuade', 'viewing', 'film', 'share', 'observation', 'nothing', 'more', 'Afterall', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'goal', 'take', 'what', 'already', 'there', 'do', 'better', 'just', 'what', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'accomplishes', 'film', 'grabbed', 'rapt', 'attention', 'beginning', 'never', 'let', 'up', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'sure', 'become', 'classic', 'years', 'ahead.Message', 'Parents', 'have', 'small', 'children', 'who', 'want', 'watch', 'please', 'take', 'time', 'view', 'goblins', 'troll', 'will', 'appear', 'quite', 'frigntening', 'young', 'audience', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned.Postscript', 'Also', 'remember', 'keep', 'plenty', 'honey', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'kills', 'goblins']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

658476,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPXS,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","I have to say that I was generally surprised by this film as, although I'm not much of a Freddie Highmore fan I've seen most of and liked most of his movies. Spiderwick Chronicles I expected to be bad but I was again surprised and shouted ""DAMN IT!"" as I liked another one of his films. I so want to hate Highmores films but again and again he constantly gives us something great. I think it's time I get over my hate filled feelings and just say, ""OK he's awesome, I admit it."" Even doing an American accent when he's definitively upper class British is great, and he even plays two roles which, damn him he still manages to pull off brilliantly.Twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace (Highmore) along with their sister Mallory discover a book, an encyclopedia if you will of goblins, fairies and other mythical creatures. They go unseen by the naked human eye but exist in a magical hidden world. The goblins are after this book as it contains mystical powers, which will help their leader Mulgarath become even more powerful. Their house is surrounded by an invisible field which keeps the goblins out, but now they are aware the book is in the house, Mulgarath and the goblins set out on a mission to get the book at all costs. In order to stop it, Jared, Shane and Mallory must find Arthur Spiderwick and have him destroy the book. The only problem is, Arthur wrote the book over 80 years ago and hasn't been seen since.This is a genuinely magical film that will put off some casual movie goers expecting more. The use of special effects is authentic and unflinching with the interaction between the invisible creatures and the human characters seems shockingly real. The real genuine shock of it all is the interaction between the two Highmores. This was a genuinely unexpected item in the film and is no doubt something that will have pushed Highmores acting ability further. The evil Mulgarath goes relatively unseen until the final scene in the film, but is something that wont disappoint if you're expecting a truly scary looking creature.One criticism I think I do have to point out is the clich&eacute; of the start of the film. It's very much like every fantasy film we've all seen, the main character discovers something magical and dangerous and tries to convince those around him what he's discovered. Guess what, they don't believe him until they themselves are attacked by the hideous creatures. It does counter this clich&eacute; when it becomes the film about closeness of family and banding together to fight the greater evil.Great movie though, and is something that can be enjoyed by many film fans including the kids.",5,A Great Movie,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,2638,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'generally', 'surprised', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'liked', 'most', 'movies', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'expected', 'be', 'bad', 'was', 'again', 'surprised', 'shouted', 'DAMN', 'IT', 'liked', 'one', 'films', 'so', 'want', 'hate', 'Highmores', 'films', 'again', 'again', 'constantly', 'something', 'great', 'think', 'time', 'get', 'hate', 'filled', 'feelings', 'just', 'say', 'awesome', 'admit', 'Even', 'doing', 'American', 'accent', 'when', 'definitively', 'upper', 'class', 'British', 'great', 'even', 'two', 'roles', 'damn', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'brilliantly.Twin', 'brothers', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'Grace', 'Highmore', 'sister', 'Mallory', 'book', 'encyclopedia', 'will', 'goblins', 'fairies', 'other', 'mythical', 'creatures', 'go', 'unseen', 'naked', 'human', 'eye', 'exist', 'magical', 'hidden', 'world', 'goblins', 'are', 'book', 'mystical', 'powers', 'will', 'help', 'leader', 'Mulgarath', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'house', 'surrounded', 'invisible', 'field', 'goblins', 'out', 'now', 'are', 'aware', 'book', 'house', 'Mulgarath', 'goblins', 'set', 'out', 'mission', 'get', 'book', 'costs', 'order', 'stop', 'Jared', 'Shane', 'Mallory', 'must', 'find', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'have', 'destroy', 'book', 'only', 'problem', 'Arthur', 'wrote', 'book', '80', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'since.This', 'genuinely', 'magical', 'film', 'will', 'put', 'off', 'casual', 'movie', 'goers', 'expecting', 'more', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'authentic', 'unflinching', 'interaction', 'invisible', 'creatures', 'human', 'characters', 'shockingly', 'real', 'real', 'genuine', 'shock', 'interaction', 'two', 'Highmores', 'was', 'genuinely', 'unexpected', 'item', 'film', 'doubt', 'something', 'will', 'have', 'pushed', 'Highmores', 'acting', 'ability', 'further', 'evil', 'Mulgarath', 'relatively', 'unseen', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'something', 'disappoint', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'truly', 'scary', 'looking', 'creature.One', 'criticism', 'think', 'do', 'have', 'point', 'out', 'clich', 'eacute', 'start', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'fantasy', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'main', 'character', 'discovers', 'something', 'magical', 'dangerous', 'convince', 'what', 'discovered', 'Guess', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'attacked', 'hideous', 'creatures', 'counter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'when', 'film', 'closeness', 'family', 'banding', 'together', 'fight', 'greater', 'evil.Great', 'movie', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'film', 'fans', 'including', 'kids']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

658480,A2FNA5903D9E6Y,B00005JPXS,Carol Toscano,"[3, 5]","The Spiderwick Chronicles, directed by Mark Waters, and based on the children's books by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, begins as an emotional family drama but quickly deteriorates into a clich&eacute;-ridden attempt at riding the ever-thriving, sci-fi fantasy coat tails of the Harry Potter films. Except, the producers of the Harry Potter films understand that today's children are the smartest children in history and are not likely to fall for poorly crafted, dumbed-down storytelling even if it did open on an IMAX screen.The film begins when Helen Grace (Mary Louise Parker), newly separated from her cheating, no-good creep of a husband (Andrew McCarthy), moves herself and her three children from New York City to her Aunt Lucinda's spooky Victorian mansion in upstate New York. Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick (Joan Plowright) lives in a sanitarium and has left the house to her niece, Helen (though Lucinda is an only child and therefore can't be anyone's aunt, technically speaking). The children, twins Jared and Simon Grace (played by Freddie Highmore in a dual role) and daughter Mallory Grace (Sarah Bolger) all deal with the separation of their parents in their own special ways. Jared is giving mom the silent treatment except when he's not and spouting clich&eacute;s like ""Dad left `cause you didn't listen to him."" Mallory has focused her attention on fencing and defending her mother's honor. Simon, the geek-child does not ""conflict"" and therefore exists in a world of passive avoidance. That is, until invisible goblins catch him and he becomes a new and improved Simon filled with lots of conflict and purpose.Within minutes - no, make that seconds - of moving in, Jared becomes spooked by a creature that, incredibly, appears to live in the walls of the Spiderwick mansion. By dinnertime, weird things happen and stuff disappears. In full clich&eacute; form, Jared, the angry, silent kid gets the blame. When he crawls into the dumbwaiter to get away from it all, he hoists himself into a secret attic where he finds two fascinating things: a honey-guzzling gremlin named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) and a book entitled Field Guide to the Fantastical World All Around Us by Arthur Spiderwick, the family's great uncle (performed by the talented David Strathairn). Thimbletack's main function is to guard the Field Guide above all else and although he warns Jared (several times) not to open the sealed book, Jared goes ahead and does so anyway (of course).  Through flashbacks, we learn that Great Uncle Arthur has discovered the secrets of the invisible world in the woods surrounding the Spiderwick mansion. Arthur has documented years of research and secret findings in his Field Guide complete with extensive illustrations and instructions for keeping the goblin universe in line. Because the secrets in this book could unleash death and destruction across faerie, gremlin, and humankind, after sealing the Field Guide and hiding it in a trunk in the attic, Arthur Spiderwick is whisked away by snow faeries because he knows too much and must be protected. Which brings me to the one of the many holes in this story: if the Field Guide's contents are so dangerous, why did the snow faeries leave it behind where the evil goblins could very likely get their claws or paws or hooves on it?The Spiderwick Chronicles is a fast-paced film - too fast, in fact. The viewer has no time to adjust to quick changing, illogical sequences while trying to come to terms with the sometimes underacted/overacted performances from some members of the cast, most notably, Mary Louise Parker's vacant interpretation of Helen. In one scene, a knife-wielding Helen stares blankly at her knives and unenthusiastically exclaims ""It's a good thing we're New Yorkers."" I didn't know whether to agree or be offended.Throughout this film, the Field Guide is dragged around, hidden, pulled apart and soiled (to name a few things), but none of the characters ever actually reads it. They flip through it a few times and talk about it a lot but that's about it. Right before the movie degenerates into a chaotic frenzy with the family fighting to save themselves from the evil ogre Mulgrath (performed to frightening excess in part by Nick Nolte and partially through some creative animation techniques), an all-out battle of exploding tomato sauce and oatmeal bombs ensues. While all this was happening, a little boy in the row in front of me asked his dad, ""Why don't they read the instructions in the book?"" Exactly.Overall, there's some good animation, a few magnificent aerial sequences, some very pretty flower faeries, a cast of greats and just the right bit of green slime, but this film falls short in the most important areas: storytelling and performance. And I would warn parents to think twice before allowing children under the age of 7 or 8 to see this because of dark themes and very scary animation.",3,Not quite what it could have

And a griffin and a uncouth pig-like creature whose spit-in-the-eye (yeeech!) makes all the unseen world around a spooky old Addams-family house out in the middle of the north woods visible for twins Jared and Simon and their sister Mallory. As far as young Jared is concerned, he has been dragged kicking and screaming away from the city and his father by his newly divorced mother. Angry, resentful and with a hasty temper, he is still the one who finds the dumb-waiter hidden behind a plastered wall, the secret study upstairs and sealed book - possession of which drives the whole rest of the story. For the book was the creation of naturalist Arthur Spiderwick, and there in loving and minute detail is everything about all the creatures, great and small, helpful and malign who inhabit that secret and unseen world. Based on the popular book series by Tony DiTerllizi and Holly Black, the movie is exactly what young book-fans would have been waiting for.The look and atmosphere of this movie is lush and believable; the various creatures are fully-realized, and some of the sequences - especially those involving the sprites -  are just dazzlingly beautiful. It is purely amazing how far this sort of thing has come. The Spiderwick Chronicles critters make Ray Harryhousen's stop-action creations in Jason and the Argonauts look as basic as a simple pencil sketch animated by flipping pages.The extras are lavish, most of them included on a second disc.  The cast interviews come as a little surprise - here we have an American fairy tale, and the two child stars are from the British Isles, and the location shoots were in Canada. The most interesting, technically speaking is how the special effects critters were designed and generated - at a cost of much computer and tech-hours, of course. In the very near future, movie makers may well be able to get along without live actors all together, at the light-speed rate that effects generation animation is barreling along.",5,"Goblins, Sprites and Bogles, Oh My",1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,2052,"['Think', 'Home', 'Alone', 'goblins', 'sprites', 'bogles', 'oh', 'griffin', 'uncouth', 'pig-like', 'creature', 'spit-in-the-eye', 'yeeech', 'unseen', 'world', 'spooky', 'old', 'Addams-family', 'house', 'middle', 'north', 'woods', 'visible', 'twins', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'sister', 'Mallory', 'As', 'far', 'young', 'Jared', 'concerned', 'been', 'dragged', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'away', 'city', 'father', 'newly', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Angry', 'resentful', 'hasty', 'temper', 'still', 'one', 'who', 'dumb-waiter', 'hidden', 'plastered', 'wall', 'secret', 'study', 'upstairs', 'sealed', 'book', 'possession', 'whole', 'rest', 'story', 'book', 'was', 'creation', 'naturalist', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'there', 'loving', 'minute', 'detail', 'everything', 'creatures', 'great', 'small', 'helpful', 'malign', 'who', 'inhabit', 'secret', 'unseen', 'world', 'Based', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'Tony', 'DiTerllizi', 'Holly', 'Black', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'young', 'book-fans', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'for.The', 'look', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'lush', 'believable', 'various', 'creatures', 'are', 'fully-realized', 'sequences', 'especially', 'involving', 'sprites', 'are', 'just', 'dazzlingly', 'beautiful', 'purely', 'amazing', 'how', 'far', 'sort', 'thing', 'come', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'critters', 'make', 'Ray', 'Harryhousen', 'stop-action', 'creations', 'Jason', 'Argonauts', 'look', 'as', 'basic', 'simple', 'pencil', 'sketch', 'animated', 'flipping', 'pages.The', 'extras', 'are', 'lavish', 'most', 'included', 'second', 'disc', 'cast', 'come', 'little', 'surprise', 'here', 'have', 'American', 'fairy', 'tale', 'two', 'child', 'stars', 'are', 'British', 'Isles', 'location', 'shoots', 'were', 'Canada', 'most', 'interesting', 'technically', 'speaking', 'how', 'special', 'effects', 'critters', 'were', 'designed', 'generated', 'cost', 'much', 'computer', 'tech-hours', 'course', 'very', 'near', 'future', 'movie', 'makers', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'along', 'live', 'actors', 'together', 'light-speed', 'rate', 'effects', 'generation', 'animation', 'barreling', 'along']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

658486,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPXS,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 8]","I could use this review of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" as a platform to describe how different it is from the five books that inspired it, but why bother? After years of hearing it in college English classes, I've finally come to accept the adage that movies are not books, and books are not movies. As a film, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is charming, magical, and a lot of fun, which is about what one would expect from a family-oriented fantasy film. The characters are compelling and the story is effectively simple and good-hearted, telling a tried and true story that an audience can willingly enjoy. I'm not so deluded as to think this an original story; the Reluctant Hero, the Magical Creatures, and the Fight Against Evil are all too familiar at this point. On the same token, I'm not so cold-hearted as to dismiss it entirely. This is, quite simply, an effective movie.The story focuses on the Grace family and its bumpy transition into a new life, one that happens to include an adventure into a world of goblins, ogres, sprites, and brownies. The mom, Helen (Mary-Louise Parker), now a divorcee, moves with her children out of New York City and into the dilapidated former home of her great uncle, Arthur Spiderwick. Her teenage daughter, Mallory (Sarah Bolger), is headstrong, bossy, and a champion fencer. Her identical twin boys--Jared and Simon (both played by Freddie Highmore)--are polar opposites: Simon is a quiet pacifist who loves to read and connects with animals; Jared is angry, bitter, and rebellious, not only because his father left him, but also because he bears the brunt of his mother's anger. Adjusting to a new life won't be easy for him, especially since his new house looks like it was taken straight from the panels of a Charles Addams comic strip.The adventure proper begins the very night they arrive. Jared immediately hears something scurrying in the walls, and after busting a wall open with a broomstick, he finds a dumbwaiter filled with various knickknacks (such as Mallory's fencing medal, which she believes he stole). He also finds a key. He then enters the dumbwaiter and pulls himself up to the attic, which contains a secret library coated in dust; in one corner sits a large chest, and lo and behold, the key fits into the lock. Jared unlocks it, opens the lid, and finds a book with a warning attached to the front, something about not opening the book because you'd risk your life doing so. He ignores it, of course, which is fine since there wouldn't be a story otherwise. Inside, Jared discovers that it's a field guide created by Arthur Spiderwick over eighty years ago, one that explains everything about the magical world around us with illustrations and notes.At around this point, Jared discovers what's been scurrying through the walls: his name is Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short), an easily provoked brownie that loves honey and can only be seen if he wants you to see him. He's in a panic because Jared has discovered the book, and this will not do since Thimbletack's job was to protect it at any cost. Jared is learning more about the creatures that inhabit our world, namely that they can't be seen without a special ring-shaped stone. Thimbletack gives Jared the stone, and he looks through it in time to see Simon dragged off by a mean group of ugly ogres; the ensuing rescue attempt reveals that a powerful, shape shifting ogre named Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte) wants Spiderwick's book for his own malevolent reasons.This is pretty much the foundation for the journey, one that sees Mallory joining her brothers, a visit to their great aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright) in a mental institution, and a few sequences with Arthur Spiderwick himself (David Strathairn), a man who walks with a cane because it makes him look scholarly. We're also treated to a number of impressive visual effects, not the least of which have to do with a number of creatures that hide in plain sight. I especially liked the sprites that take the form of ordinary flowers--I'd love to walk through a park with such creatures floating around me. We also meet Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen), a hobgoblin that loves to eat birds, and a griffin named Byron, who flies majestically above clouds, over mountains, and through caves.There was also an interesting subplot about the house itself. Apparently, it's surrounded by a ring of toadstools that act as a kind of force field; nothing magical can cross that line either way, meaning that the book is safe so long as it remains in the house. Jared, being the willful young lad he is, takes it with him wherever he goes, which is one of the reasons why Thimbletack is always so high-strung. Is it any wonder that his anger forces him into acts of mischief, such as tying Mallory's hair to the posts of her bed, or switching the field guide with a cookbook when Jared isn't looking?As routine as this material is, all of it still manages to be wonderful, so much so that we don't stop to think about the film's weaker aspects, namely the tension and resentment growing between Jared and his mother. Then again, that too would have been unoriginal, since it's been explored so many times in so many other movies. Ultimately, what we really care about is the fight between the Graces and Mulgarath--or to more general, the fight between Good and Evil. The final confrontation has some nice subtleties that I wouldn't dream of giving away, not only because they're clever, but also because they're expected. I recommend ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" to everyone, even to diehard fans of the book series created by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black; it's an easy-going fantasy fable, about as enjoyable as a green pasture swarming with sprites.",4,Fantasy by the Book,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,5734,"['could', 'use', 'review', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'platform', 'describe', 'how', 'different',

658489,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPXS,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 1]","I think we're all aware now of Hollywood's tendency to favor familiar grounds or new, exciting but undependable territory. Instead of giving the go-ahead to wild and out-there movies which might not bring in the money but offer unique stories, producers tend to love the next big thing, whether it's Japanese horror remakes, gross-out comedies and our current trend: the children's fantasy film. So far they've ranged from tremendous (Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter), serviceable (Bridge to Terabithia) to incredibly subpar (The Seeker). The Spiderwick Chronicles, a successful book series by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, is in the same league as Terabithia as it's pretty successful in areas but then ends up being only a good adaptation.The Grace family are moving from New York to their relative's house in the countryside. Getting hit particularly hard is Jared who's acting outward and rebelliously towards his twin brother Simon, sister Mallory and his mother Helen. However, upon hearing strange sounds and investigating the attic, Jared comes across a book written by Arthur Spiderwick, a relative who went missing 80 years ago, which details many creatures and secrets. But a nasty ogre is hellbent on discovering the secrets within the book so Jared has to somehow protect the book with the help of his siblings who also discover a world they can't see.Upon finishing watching the film, I had to admit I actually liked what I saw and found it entertaining despite it being on a book series I never read or being an unfortunate victim of a film I might forget in a few years. With a tone that's more akin to Willow or Gremlins than Terabithia had (despite the scenes after a character's fate is revealed). The film's a bit more heavier on action and the film couldn't really be described as ""safe"" for the kiddies. On one hand it is thrilling that sees a film a bit more confident in its storytelling and not just simply being a toothless film for everyone but the action scenes might be a little bit too intense for the kiddies.The other thing that might bother people is that at times the film feels a bit too much for its fans and not for general audiences like me who haven't read a word from the series. While certain concepts are easy to grasp, other things like terms and rules and uses for things kind of fly over your head and you're like ""wait, so the thing does the thing....right?"" and not to mention the film itself feels a bit truncated and despite the excellent sense of pacing, the material feels like certain sections were chopped out for time. But the film works with what it has and (used since only certain books were adapted) the film's entertaining all the way through without being too long.Another highlight is that there's an actual emotional story running throughout and leading the pack is Freddie Highmore playing the dual roles of Jared and Simon, one being outspoken and brash while being very shy and somewhat of a wimp. Managing to create two distinct characters rather than just being told to be a rebel on one day and introverted on another, he's the highlight of the film. But we also have Sarah Bolger as Mallory, David Strathairn as Arthur Spiderwick and Mary-Louise Parker from tv's ""Weeds"" who does pretty well considering her smaller role. And surprise, Martin Short isn't entirely annoying as a house elf and Seth Rogen is great as a bird-eating...pig/troll/goblin. The effect work works pretty well though closeups of the creatures look a bit too texture-y for me.I'd give the film a solid rental since I doubt I'll end up dying to revisit this months for now but for the time the film was on, I have to admit I was entertained the whole way.",4,"In the end, it's delightful",1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,3698,"['think', ""'re"", 'aware', 'now', 'Hollywood', 'tendency', 'favor', 'familiar', 'grounds', 'new', 'exciting', 'undependable', 'territory', 'Instead', 'giving', 'go-ahead', 'wild', 'out-there', 'movies', 'might', 'not', 'bring', 'money', 'offer', 'unique', 'stories', 'producers', 'tend', 'love', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'remakes', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'current', 'trend', 'children', 'fantasy', 'film', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'ranged', 'tremendous', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'serviceable', 'Bridge', 'Terabithia', 'incredibly', 'subpar', 'Seeker', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'successful', 'book', 'series', 'Tony', 'DiTerlizzi', 'Holly', 'Black', 'same', 'league', 'as', 'Terabithia', 'pretty', 'successful', 'areas', 'then', 'up', 'being', 'only', 'good', 'adaptation.The', 'Grace', 'family', 'are', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'relative', 'house', 'countryside', 'Getting', 'hit', 'particularly', 'hard', 'Jared', 'who', 'acting', 'outward', 'rebelliously', 'twin', 'brother', 'Simon', 'sister', 'Mallory', 'mother', 'Helen', 'However', 'hearing', 'strange', 'sounds', 'investigating', 'attic', 'Jared', 'book', 'written', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'relative', 'who', 'went', 'missing', '80', 'years', 'ago', 'details', 'many', 'creatures', 'secrets', 'nasty', 'ogre', 'hellbent', 'discovering', 'secrets', 'book', 'so', 'Jared', 'somehow', 'protect', 'book', 'help', 'siblings', 'who', 'also', 'discover', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see.Upon', 'finishing', 'watching', 'film', 'had', 'admit', 'actually', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'found', 'entertaining', 'being', 'book', 'series', 'never', 'read', 'being', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'film', 'might', 'forget', 'few', 'years', 'tone', 'more', 'akin', 'Willow', 'Gremlins', 'Terabithia', 'had', 'scenes', 'character', 'fate', 'revealed', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'heavier', 'action', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'described', 'safe', 'kiddies', 'one', 'hand', 'thrilling', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'confident', 'storytelling', 'not', 'just', 'simply', 'being', 'toothless', 'film', 'everyone', 'action', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'intense', 'kiddies.The', 'other', 'thing', 'might', 'bother', 'people', 'times', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'fans', 'not', 'general', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'word', 'series', 'certain', 'concepts', 'are', 'easy', 'grasp', 'other', 'things', 'terms', 'rules', 'uses', 'things', 'kind', 'fly', 'head', ""'re"", 'wait', 'thing', 'thing', '.right', 'not', 'mention', 'film', 'bit', 'truncated', 'excellent', 'sense', 'pacing', 'material', 'feels', 'certain', 'sections', 'were', 'chopped', 'out', 'time', 'film', 'what', 'used', 'only', 'certain', 'books', 'were', 'adapted', 'film', 'entertaining', 'way', 'being', 'too', 'long.Another', 'highlight', 'actual', 'emotional', 'story', 'running', 'leading', 'pack', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'playing', 'dual', 'roles', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'one', 'being', 'outspoken', 'brash', 'being', 'very', 'shy', 'somewhat', 'wimp', 'Managing', 'create', 'two', 'distinct', 'characters', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'told', 'be', 'rebel', 'one', 'day', 'introverted', 'highlight', 'film', 'also', 'have', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'Mallory', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'tv', 'Weeds', 'who', 'pretty', 'well', 'considering', 'smaller', 'role', 'surprise', 'Martin', 'Short', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'annoying', 'house', 'elf', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'great', 'bird-eating', 'pig/troll/goblin', 'effect', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'closeups', 'creatures', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'texture-y', 'me.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'solid', 'rental', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'revisit', 'months', 'now', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'entertained', 'whole', 'way']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

658494,AUHG8KSHI529U,B00005JPXS,Craig Matteson,"[1, 1]","I have not read any of the Spiderwick books, so I am only reviewing the movie.While there is plenty of fantasy here for kids to enjoy, some aspects of the way the story is told might leave younger kids a big confused.  However, I don't think they will care.  What is here is quite delightful and there is something here for everyone to enjoy.  Well, unless you dislike fantasy stories.The story opens with a mother, a teenage daughter, and twin teenage boys moving into a spooky old house that a relation owns.  The mother has moved her family to this new city to get a job and there is obviously some fresh pain in the family.  The house is not only old and spooky there is a lot of odd stuff like salt at the windowsills, can and cans of tomato sauce, and a seemingly endless supply of those little bear containers full of honey.One of the twin boys if very aggressive and angry about being separated from his father and the other deals with his hurt passively.  At some point you will come to realize that there mother and the father have split up, but the angry boy has not been told this and refuses to understand the evidence all around him.Damage is done to the house that everyone blames on the angry twin with some evidence, but the major damage comes from the house's brownie / boggart, Thimbletack.  Along the way the boy discovers a secret room, a key, and a sealed book with a note that warns him not to open or read the book.  Of course he ignores the warning.  All kinds of bad things ensue.The chief obstacle is a very bad creature named Mulgarath.  He has many servants who help him in his evil and cruel pursuits.  However, his main goal in life is to get that book and use what is in it to dominate the world.  The book was put together by Arthur Spiderwick to document his studies of the beings of the unseen world all around us.Once the bad guys become aware of where the book is they will stop at nothing to get it.  The battles are more intense than little children can take, but not horrible.  The suspense is quite good and the revealing of all the components of the unseen world is quite wonderful.I think it is a good family film, if tinged with sadness throughout.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,"An interesting but somewhat sad fantasy story that is good for families, but not small children",1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,2233,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'Spiderwick', 'books', 'am', 'only', 'reviewing', 'movie.While', 'plenty', 'fantasy', 'here', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'aspects', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'might', 'leave', 'younger', 'kids', 'big', 'confused', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'care', 'What', 'here', 'quite', 'delightful', 'something', 'here', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'Well', 'dislike', 'fantasy', 'stories.The', 'story', 'mother', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'twin', 'teenage', 'moving', 'spooky', 'old', 'house', 'relation', 'mother', 'moved', 'family', 'new', 'city', 'get', 'job', 'obviously', 'fresh', 'pain', 'family', 'house', 'not', 'only', 'old', 'spooky', 'lot', 'odd', 'stuff', 'salt', 'windowsills', 'can', 'cans', 'tomato', 'sauce', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'supply', 'little', 'bear', 'containers', 'full', 'honey.One', 'twin', 'very', 'aggressive', 'angry', 'being', 'separated', 'father', 'other', 'deals', 'hurt', 'passively', 'point', 'will', 'come', 'realize', 'mother', 'father', 'have', 'split', 'up', 'angry', 'boy', 'not', 'been', 'told', 'understand', 'evidence', 'him.Damage', 'done', 'house', 'everyone', 'angry', 'twin', 'evidence', 'major', 'damage', 'house', 'brownie', '/', 'boggart', 'Thimbletack', 'way', 'boy', 'secret', 'room', 'key', 'sealed', 'book', 'note', 'not', 'open', 'read', 'book', 'course', 'warning', 'kinds', 'bad', 'things', 'ensue.The', 'chief', 'obstacle', 'very', 'bad', 'creature', 'named', 'Mulgarath', 'many', 'servants', 'who', 'help', 'evil', 'cruel', 'pursuits', 'However', 'main', 'goal', 'life', 'get', 'book', 'use', 'what', 'dominate', 'world', 'book', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'document', 'studies', 'beings', 'unseen', 'world', 'bad', 'guys', 'become', 'aware', 'where', 'book', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'battles', 'are', 'more', 'intense', 'little', 'children', 'can', 'take', 'not', 'horrible', 'suspense', 'quite', 'good', 'revealing', 'components', 'unseen', 'world', 'quite', 'wonderful.I', 'think', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'tinged', 'sadness', 'throughout.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

658503,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005JPXS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","Before writers Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi worked on the book ""The Field Guide"" (2003) and way before they created their eight books based on ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", both writers have said that the story is based on an actual events that were told to them by a family in Maine.After receiving letters from three young children about their experiences of discovering these magical creatures, it became an inspiration to write about their experiences and create a magical story based on their experiences via ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"".With the popularity of the children's books, the first five books (""The Field Guide, ""The Seeing Stone"", ""Lucinda's Secret"", ""The Ironwood Tree"" and ""The Wrath of Mulgarath"") were then adapted into a film released in theaters in 2008 and has grossed over $162 million worldwide and for the most part, receiving favorable reviews from reviewers.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a film presented in 1080p High Definition and with many of the scenes featured during the day and night, one thing that is constantly emphasized throughout the film are its blacks.  Blacks are well done and outdoor scenes are quite vibrant and colorful.  We see the scenes of Fall with the leaves on the ground but for the most part, the film utilizes a lot of CG.  And overall, the CG is where most of the detail can be seen.  But in some ways, the film has its share of darkness and for the most part, I think it was the cinematographer's goal to capture the home being surrounded by darkness and light during indoor scenes are kept minimal.  But overall, I felt that ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" dark nature was fitting for the film and definitely looked much better than its DVD counterpart.As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I felt the film was quite immersive as dialogue and music was quite clear during the front and center channels.  But the roars of the monsters and the overall sounds being carried through the surround channels as it pans from left to right or right to left was pretty awesome.  Great use of the subwoofer producing really nice LFE during the monstrous sounds as a troll going after Jared and Mallory or the action sequences towards the end of the film.  There are plenty of action sequences in ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" and for the most part, audio quality is top notch!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" feature the following special features:* Spiderwick: It's All True! - (7:02) - Director Mark Waters introduces us to the creatures of Spiderwick.* It's a Spiderwick World - (8:44) Writers Holly Black and Toni DiTerlizzi explain how the Spiderwick Chronicles came to be and also seeing their books being turned into a movie.  Also, crew talk about their involvement in the film.* Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide - Using your remote, you can view the Field Guide and learn more about the creatures featured in the film.* Field Guide In-Movie Mode - While watching the film, you can see some interesting information shown on the bottom in regards to the characters in the film.* Spiderwick: Meet the Clan! - (13:54) Director Mark Waters talks about casting of the talent in the film and the talents talk about being part of the film.  Also, how the talents Freddie Highmore is from England and Sarah Bolger is from Ireland.  So, despite being an American made film, the two were cast for the part and speaking without their accents.* The Magic of Spiderwick! - (20:53) We learn about the set and production design of the film.  From the creation of the house, the trees, the tunnels and more.* A Final Word of Advice! - (1:51) - Director Mark Waters final message.* Deleted Scenes: Four deleted scenes which include: Mom & Jared, Boys in Bedroom, Messy Kitchen and Meet Lucinda.* Nickelodeon TV Spots - (5:04) A Total of nine TV spots which include: A Guide to Seeing The Spiderwick Chronicles, Cinema Spy, Confessional - Jared, Confessional - Mallory, Field Guide - Tomato Sauce, Field Guide - Seeing Stone, Field Guide - Creatures, What if you had a seeing stone? and The Split Spot.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:04 each) Featuring two trailers Good vs. Evil and Secrets.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that I had no knowledge of ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" previously to watching the films and having watched the film, I truly enjoyed the magical aspects of the film and how the film was actually quite dark considering it was based on a children's book.  I actually tried to watch this film with my six-year-old son who insisted that since it was Nickelodeon movie, he wanted to watch it.  And 15-minutes into the film, he was literally scared and couldn't watch anymore.But for me, I had a fun time and partly it's because of the Blu-ray's immersive soundtrack.  This film did a great job making you hear the monsters all around you and creating that dark atmosphere throughout the film.  ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" definitely does a great job in utilizing sound and those with a good home theater setup will enjoy this film's lossless soundtrack.And for the film, it was great to see so many talent involved.  Seeing Mary-Louise Parker, Nick Nolte, Andrew McCarthy, Joan Plowright, David Strathairn in the film and also knowing that Seth Rogen and Martin Short providing the voices was pretty cool.  But you also have to give credit to English actor Freddie Highmore and Irish actress Sarah Bolger who did a great job in playing American kids.  Highmore especially did a fantastic job in having us believe that perhaps Jared and Simon were actually twins.  He managed to pull of two different characters, despite the two being twin brothers.If I had any negatives with the film, it's when the film tried to use Jared's anger towards his parent's split and you suddenly go back and forth from the action to his family woes.  In just seemed a bit unusual to see things disrupted in that manner but fortunately, it happens only once or twice in the film.  And since the film is based on five books, one can only imagine how much storyline was left out from the actual film and how different or how faithful the film's adaptation was to the original books.But overall, being a guy who has no knowledge of the books, it was pretty fun to have a film that was adventurous and dark.  Sure, there are a lot of these adventure/magical type of films that are being adapted into a film these days but I definitely found ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" to be quite entertaining and fun.  And you do get quite a number of special features included in the Blu-ray as well.If you are looking for an adventure film to add to your Blu-ray collection and you enjoyed films such as ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" or even the Harry Potter films, definitely give ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" a chance.",4,"Blu-ray: I have not read the books but for this film alone, I had a fun time watching

658525,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B00005JPXS,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[2, 2]","The Spiderwick Chronichles is one of the better recent fantasy movies based on a book series. It's about a boy named Jared Grace (Freddie Highmore) who moves into a house with his mom (Mary-Louise Parker), sister and twin brother ""who Highmore also plays of course"". Soon after he arrives he notices some strange things about the house, such as something living in the walls. When he starts poking holes in the walls his mom thinks it's over anger issues due to his father leaving them. So yes there's a sub-plot about divorces and him missing his father and wanting to live with him.The movie still sweeps you away though once he finds a mysterious book that holds all the mysteries of a hidden magical world. Soon after finding the book he meets who he heard behind the walls. He's warned by it not to ever leave the house with the book and that him and his family are in danger due to him even opening it. Soon after that goblins start coming after him and his family led by the evil Mulgarath (Nick Nolte).I liked Narnia but I found The Spiderwick Chronicles to be just as good as any of the Harry Potter movies. Just don't expect to be able to bring small kids because just like Potter, it's too intense for them. Moving on, this movie is magical and instantly became one of my new favorite fantasy films. It helps that the cast is pretty good. David Strathairn especially is solid as Arthur Spiderwick who's obsession with fairies and other creatures is what started all the trouble in the first place. Nick Nolte is pretty creepy when his character is shown in human form. While Seth Rogan is funny as the voice of a good creature who means to help Jared but loses sight of his goals whenever he spots a bird.

658526,A3UZFB2LEZYWCT,B00005JPXS,"JLL ""jamesndir""","[24, 31]","First let me say if you did NOT read the books and just want a good film with outstanding and magical special effects for you and your older children then this really is a great choice; go ahead and get this movie and be happy.If you want to watch the movie and expect it to follow the books you will be greatly disappointed.  I am not sure that the Amazon reviewer, Tom Keogh, read the books.  This is not a ""good adaptation"" of the books.  The writers of this movie took the characters and then twisted and distorted them into a story vaguely reminiscent of the books.  One of the main rewards we use for our children is they can watch the movie if they have read the books.  We read the entire 7 Narnia books and have seen the first two movies which are very good (especially Prince Caspian movie).Let me quickly list just a very few of the differences from the movie and the book off the top of my head (we read the book quite a while ago and just bought the DVD and watched it last night).  I am sure there are many more differences but you will get the idea:1.  They don't really play up the love of animals Simon has.2.  There are no Dwarfs/sleeping Mallory in a box scenes.3.  There is no quarry scene.4.  There are no school scenes or mentioning.5.  Jared does not have to solve any mystery to find anything (i.e. like figuring out the riddle of the trunk and that it had a false bottom).6.  They don't have to find the seeing stone Thimbletack just happens to have it and hand it to them/Jared.7.  Mallory and Simon are more antagonistic to Jared and come into believing that there are strange things going on much later.8.  Thimbletack is mostly a green somewhat scary Boggart and very little of the Brownie.  He shape shifts before your eyes multiple times and is as addicted to honey as any Meth addict is to their drug.9.  The scene to go find the book is different (Jared goes alone and Simon and Mallory do not help him in the dumbwaiter).10.  The whole story line was changed when they were off to find Simon after he was carried away by the Goblins.  Mallory does not go with him and there is no Troll in the water (instead the Troll-which looks more like a giant iguana/dinosaur on steroids- chases them later when they go to see their Aunt).11.  They do not go to see their aunt with their Mom they do through this underground tunnel system chased by a psychotic dinosaur they are saying is a Troll.12.  There is a lot of honey, salt and tomatoes in this movie not found in the book.13.  Hogsqueals initial scene is totally changed; as is his motivation; in the movie he is on some sort of crusade to revenge his family.14.  The Griffin character was changed to Arthur Spiderwicks pet they somehow summon out of thin air and not rescued from the Goblins when trying to free Simon after they discovered Hogsqueal.15.  There are no elves and they do not have to figure out how to get to Arthur Spiderwick (the summoned Griffin just flies there to him.16.  Mulgaraths character is totally changed.  He shape shifts into two equally frightening characters, Nick Nolte on his daily dose of drugs and scleral icterus and a demon character that resembles a scary devil.17.

One by one starting with Jared, the family members learn that they are living in a bad and dangerous place. They get scared out of their wits, but they are resourceful and get help from the famous British actress Joan Plowright.I've seen cleverer movies and monsters who were more monstrous and truly frightening.

But the archetypes in Spiderwick are so familiar (like the abbreviated Potter movies) that it is less of a disadvantage than you would think. We, as objective movie viewers have to let go of the expectation for the Holy Grail of the perfect book-to-film translation and face that the mediums are apples and oranges. This is an easy task for me this time because I haven't read any of the Spiderwick series. But having said that, my children and I, enjoy the film. The look of the ""world"" created in the spirit of the books were originally stylized enough to make it a departure from the world of Hogwarts (which is no small accomplishment when you also have trolls and griffins.Typical of the archetypes of the genre, you have the child-outsider of a broken (or bent) home who blunders into a magic world, along with quirky, sometimes ill-mannered, but ultimately well-meaning siblings and finally the single parent who doesn't believe a word-of it. The kid opens a  book he shouldn't (like who would read a book that has ""Do not open"" on the cover, it should have read: don't open infested with Lice!"" that would have kept `em out!) and then spends the film trying to make things right and bonding with his estranged family.Production is pretty eye-candy using visual designers of the Henson school of creature making.  John Horner (the not-Williams) composes a face paced soundtrack that matches the speed of the story and slows appropriately of the sappier moments of the movie. The cast is a watchable bunch of not-overly attractive kids, along with some voice cameos like Martin Short and Nick Nolte, not without distinction, plays the badie (physically sometimes) well enough.We enjoyed the film and, if there isn't higher praise than this let me know, we were inspired to check-out the Spiderwick Chronicles book series at our local library to fill in all the plot holes.",4,"Condensed, but creative eye-candy",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,1976,"['Condensing', '5', 'books', 'one', 'film', 'can', 'hurt', 'storylines', 'make', 'lots', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'archetypes', 'Spiderwick', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'abbreviated', 'Potter', 'movies', 'less', 'disadvantage', 'would', 'think', 'objective', 'movie', 'viewers', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'expectation', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'perfect', 'book-to-film', 'translation', 'face', 'mediums', 'are', 'apples', 'oranges', 'easy', 'task', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Spiderwick', 'series', 'having', 'said', 'children', 'enjoy', 'film', 'look', 'world', 'created', 'spirit', 'books', 'were', 'originally', 'stylized', 'enough', 'make', 'departure', 'world', 'Hogwarts', 'small', 'accomplishment', 'when', 'also', 'have', 'trolls', 'griffins.Typical', 'archetypes', 'genre', 'have', 'child-outsider', 'broken', 'bent', 'home', 'who', 'magic', 'world', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'ill-mannered', 'ultimately', 'well-meaning', 'siblings', 'finally', 'single', 'parent', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'word-of', 'kid', 'book', 'should', ""n't"", 'who', 'would', 'read', 'book', 'Do', 'not', 'open', 'cover', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'open', 'infested', 'Lice', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'em', 'then', 'film', 'trying', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'bonding', 'estranged', 'family.Production', 'pretty', 'eye-candy', 'using', 'visual', 'designers', 'Henson', 'school', 'creature', 'making', 'John', 'Horner', 'not-Williams', 'face', 'paced', 'soundtrack', 'speed', 'story', 'appropriately', 'sappier', 'moments', 'movie', 'cast', 'watchable', 'bunch', 'not-overly', 'attractive', 'kids', 'voice', 'cameos', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'not', 'distinction', 'badie', 'physically', 'sometimes', 'well', 'enough.We', 'enjoyed', 'film', ""n't"", 'higher', 'praise', 'let', 'know', 'were', 'inspired', 'check-out', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'book', 'series', 'local', 'library', 'fill', 'plot', 'holes']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

It is no one's first choice, but newly single mom Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) has a job in the area.  And it allows them a chance to move into the Spiderwick mansion.  Helen is related to the Spiderwicks.  In fact, she has inherited the mansion, so it cuts down on costs.Of her three kids, daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and son Simon (Freddie Highmore) are okay with the change.  Simon's twin Jared (also Freddie Highmore) is not.  He can't wait for his dad to come and get him out of there.The house is creepy, and right away things start to go missing.  Jared hears a noise in the wall that leads to the discovery of a dumb waiter and a hidden room.  Exploring further, Jared finds an old book with a warning on the cover.  Ignoring the warning, Jared opens the book and starts to read.It's only after reading the book that Jared realizes what he's done.  See, the book contains the secrets of all the creatures that are in the world around us that we can't see, like fairies, goblins, and ogres.  And one ogre in particular, Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte), wants that book so he can destroy everything.  Now Jared, Simon, and Mallory are in the fight of their lives to find a way to defeat Mulgarath and stay alive.  Can they do it?This movie is an adrenaline fueled ride.  It is creepy and intriguing from the first few seconds and builds from there.  I was on the edge of my seat by the end.  While I absolutely loved it, it might frighten young kids.  I would seriously question whether anyone under 8 or so would enjoy it.  Of course, you know your own kids best, so judge accordingly.While a fast paced thrill ride, the story still hangs together.  A couple things got glossed over in the ending, but they were minor.  The acting is great as well, especially from Sarah Bolger and Freddie Highmore who carry the film since they are in every scene.  Freddie makes both his characters different.  I expect we'll be seeing lots more from him in the future.The special effects could have been a little better.  I don't know whether they were going for stylized or what, but they aren't up to the level we are used to seeing these days.  And it just goes to show how spoiled we are because they are certainly adequate.  They just aren't the blow your socks off stuff we normally see these days.If this movie won't scare your kids, see it.  Heck, see it even if you don't have kids.

Many governments use the excuse national security to keep citizens in the dark when they are at war to keep the enemy from finding out their spies or their battle strategy. In this instance however, a scientist is studying nature (representing lets say Darwin). Cute little fairies disguised as flowers represent a popular religion (lets say christiananity).

They are moving into the Spiderwick Estate, a mansion that Helen inherited from her Aunt Lucinda (Plowwright).  The estate has an interesting history though.  80 years ago, Arthur Spiderwick (Strathairn) wrote a ""field guide"" to the world around him.  This guide includes all kinds of fantastical creatyres.  By writing it, he unleashed some terrible forces and now an army of goblins is amassing.  Led by the ogre Mulgrath (Nolte), they seek to take the book away from the protection of the house.  The kids are all that stands between Mulgrath and world domination.""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a surprisingly well done movie.  For a movie that covers five books, there isn't a feeling that much was lost in the translation.  There is a lot of action that keeps the moving quickly.  The child actors do a good job in the roles, especially Highmore in dual roles.  The story is not complex, but is not simple either.

I love the books, and I love their possibilities more, and one of those possibilities was a truly extraordinary movie. But that wasn't what I got.The plot, what there is of it, hinges around three siblings, Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace, and their rather quick-to-judge mother. When the Graces move into Spiderwick Manor following a divorce, Jared finds a book - a field guide - that he soon realizes should never have been uncovered.This should have been a great movie. And yet, I could tell from the first few minutes that it wouldn't be. Aside from the many great scenes and moments from the books thrown away (Mallory's kidnap, the mother's kidnap, the various other creatures besides goblins, hobgoblins, and griffins) the acting is relatively stiff, except for the good performances of Freddie Highmore as twins Simon and Jared, and the ""batty"" Aunt Lucinda. The direction, too, could have been better; as it was it seemed hasty, thrown together, juvenile, and trying-to-be-modern (like Jared's oft-shown cell phone and iPod).The ending was really quite dumb and had me rolling my eyes as all the young boys in the theater guffawed. I honestly can't remember if the villain was disposed of like that in the books, but if he was, it was done better than in this movie.Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly wasn't a great one, and it didn't come near the quality of the books.

Some of these creatures want to obtain a book from the country house, and this quest for the book, called The Spiderwick Chronicles, is the chief conflict of the movie.  Its resolution is quite original and probably the best part of the movie.Here are some things to look out for.  First is the great acting by David Straithan, in his first fantasy role.  Second is Nick Nolte's casting as the chief antagonist.  His voice is perfectly suited to his character.  And last is the twins played by Freddie Highmore.

658571,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPXS,RMurray847,"[2, 2]","I doubt that THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES will enjoy that same longevity that the film adaptations of HARRY POTTER (and possibly even the current CHRONICLES OF NARNIA) will.  However, it is nonetheless a more solid adaptation of its source material than the tonally misguided SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, more down-to-earth than the lovely but boring GOLDEN COMPASS and FAR superior to the horrific ERAGON.The SPIDERWICK books are slight volumes indeed, and the movie easily adapts all five of them into one film less than 2 hours long.  Unless the film is a hit and its makers decide to ""invent"" their own sequels, this CHRONICLE will stand alone.  And that's probably okay.  It's nice to see a ""family epic"" that doesn't have a transparent agenda to be the first in a series of smash hits.It's a relatively humble story, told with simplicity.  It begins with that most tiresome of all family movie clich&eacute;s...the newly single mother moving into a decrepit old house in the middle of nowhere with her unhappy city kids.  The children hate the new little town they have to live in, the creeky and creepy old house and to some extent, their overstressed mother.  Isn't there any other way to get a family into a ""haunted"" or ""mysterious"" house anymore?!?!Fortunately, this worn-out idea is quickly thrust aside, as one of the kids (played by young Freddie Highmore of FINDING NEVERLAND) discovers a hidden room that holds the secret workshop and writings of Arthur Spiderwick, a long gone relative who is reputed to have been more than a little nuts about pursuing his life's work of documenting the magical ""other world"" of fairies, goblins, etc. that exists right along side ours...only invisibly.As you might guess, it turns out this world exists. At first, no one believes young Highmore, especially his twin brother (also played by Highmore) and his older sister.  But they soon embark on adventures that prove the existence of this magical world, and unwittingly they have also enabled that world to threaten their very lives.The movie is partly an exploration of the magical world, as we learn some of its rules and meet its inhabitants.  Most enjoyable is Thimbletack, a little creature charged with guarding the book that contains all these secrets.  He's got a love of honey, which is good, because feeding him a honey-smeared cracker calms his tendency to turn into a little, green, angry ogre.  All the creatures are CGI rendered and the effects, while not earth-shattering, are convincing enough to allow for proper suspension of disbelief.The others parts of the movie are a detective story (as the kids try to put together the truth) and some light action sequences, because in the end, the goblins must be battled.  There is also a subplot featuring David Straithairn (as Arthur Spiderwick) and Joan Plowright that I won't go into any detail on, because it is the source of the lovely and satisfying ending.The movie is perfectly entertaining, but hardly flawless.  After awhile, you realize that virtually the entire thing is taking place at the one house, with brief forays to a magical glade and to the town.  It feels a little ""stagebound"" for lack of a better word.  In some ways, this keeps the story small and more grounded in our world.  But it also prevents any sense of truly sweeping vistas (despite one scene of the kids flying on the back of a Griffin).  This makes the film seem just a little low-budget...just when we have grown to expect more from these sorts of films.  (On the other hand, at least it doesn't exceed its grasp.)  Also, Freddie Highmore, a very talented young actor, is just not quite up to a convincing American accent, and this bothered me just a little throughout the film.But on the other hand, watching the first moment when flowers in a flower bed turn into fairies is a true high-point...a moment of brief loveliness that sneaks up on you.  In fact, SPIDERWICK is a film of small pleasures throughout.  Little details, tiny touches...these are what you'll remember...long after the splattering of goblins and trolls.---see more of my reviews on [..]",4,"Solid, unpretentious fantasy for the whole family",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,4108,"['doubt', 'THE', 'SPIDERWICK', 'CHRONICLES', 'will', 'enjoy', 'same', 'longevity', 'film', 'adaptations', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'possibly', 'even', 'current', 'CHRONICLES', 'OF', 'NARNIA', 'will', 'However', 'nonetheless', 'more', 'solid', 'adaptation', 'source', 'material', 'tonally', 'misguided', 'SERIES', 'OF', 'UNFORTUNATE', 'EVENTS', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'lovely', 'boring', 'GOLDEN', 'COMPASS', 'FAR', 'superior', 'horrific', 'ERAGON.The', 'SPIDERWICK', 'books', 'are', 'slight', 'volumes', 'indeed', 'movie', 'easily', 'five', 'one', 'film', 'less', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'film', 'hit', 'makers', 'decide', 'invent', 'own', 'sequels', 'CHRONICLE', 'will', 'stand', 'alone', 'probably', 'okay', 'nice', 'see', 'family', 'epic', ""n't"", 'have', 'transparent', 'agenda', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'smash', 'hits.It', 'relatively', 'humble', 'story', 'told', 'simplicity', 'most', 'tiresome', 'family', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'newly', 'single', 'mother', 'moving', 'decrepit', 'old', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'unhappy', 'city', 'kids', 'children', 'hate', 'new', 'little', 'town', 'have', 'live', 'creeky', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'extent', 'overstressed', 'mother', ""n't"", 'other', 'way', 'get', 'family', 'haunted', 'mysterious', 'house', 'anymore', 'Fortunately', 'worn-out', 'idea', 'quickly', 'thrust', 'aside', 'one', 'kids', 'played', 'young', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'FINDING', 'NEVERLAND', 'hidden', 'room', 'secret', 'workshop', 'writings', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'long', 'gone', 'relative', 'who', 'reputed', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'little', 'nuts', 'pursuing', 'life', 'work', 'documenting', 'magical', 'other', 'world', 'fairies', 'goblins', 'etc', 'right', 'along', 'side', 'ours', 'only', 'invisibly.As', 'might', 'guess', 'out', 'world', 'first', 'one', 'young', 'Highmore', 'especially', 'twin', 'brother', 'also', 'played', 'Highmore', 'older', 'sister', 'soon', 'embark', 'adventures', 'prove', 'existence', 'magical', 'world', 'unwittingly', 'have', 'also', 'enabled', 'world', 'threaten', 'very', 'lives.The', 'movie', 'partly', 'exploration', 'magical', 'world', 'learn', 'rules', 'meet', 'inhabitants', 'Most', 'enjoyable', 'Thimbletack', 'little', 'creature', 'charged', 'guarding', 'book', 'secrets', 'got', 'love', 'honey', 'good', 'feeding', 'honey-smeared', 'cracker', 'calms', 'tendency', 'turn', 'little', 'green', 'angry', 'ogre', 'creatures', 'are', 'CGI', 'rendered', 'effects', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'are', 'convincing', 'enough', 'allow', 'proper', 'suspension', 'disbelief.The', 'others', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'detective', 'story', 'kids', 'try', 'put', 'together', 'truth', 'light', 'action', 'sequences', 'end', 'goblins', 'must', 'be', 'battled', 'also', 'subplot', 'featuring', 'David', 'Straithairn', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'source', 'lovely', 'satisfying', 'ending.The', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'entertaining', 'hardly', 'flawless', 'awhile', 'realize', 'virtually', 'entire', 'thing', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'house', 'brief', 'forays', 'magical', 'glade', 'town', 'little', 'stagebound', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'ways', 'story', 'small', 'more', 'grounded', 'world', 'also', 'sense', 'truly', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'one', 'scene', 'kids', 'flying', 'back', 'Griffin', 'film', 'seem', 'just', 'little', 'low-budget', 'just', 'when', 'have', 'grown', 'expect', 'more', 'sorts', 'films', 'other', 'hand', 'least', ""n't"", 'exceed', 'grasp', 'Also', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'very', 'talented', 'young', 'actor', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'up', 'convincing', 'American', 'accent', 'bothered', 'just', 'little', 'film.But', 'other', 'hand', 'watching', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'flowers', 'flower', 'bed', 'turn', 'fairies', 'true', 'high-point', 'moment', 'brief', 'loveliness', 'up', 'fact', 'SPIDERWICK', 'film', 'small', 'pleasures', 'Little', 'details', 'tiny', 'touches', 'are', 'what', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'long', 'splattering', 'goblins', 'trolls.', '-see', 'more', 'reviews', '[', '..', ']']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition
658572,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00005JPXS,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","The Spiderwick Chronicles released in Feb/08 is based on the first five books about Spiderwick written by Holly Black and Tony DiTierlizzi.There have been two series of books with the first five,four companion pieces and three more in a newer series.They are all enchanting pieces and this film adaption does the first series a certain amount of justice,considering it condensed the t five novels into one.The acting is very good and the pace never lets up throughout.The story involves the Grace family who move into an old New England house once owned by their Aunt Lucinda(Joan Plowright);who now resides in a local sanitarium.Jared and his twin brother Simon(played both wonderfully by Freddie Highmore) are total opposites;Jared the forceful one while his brother Simon is the timid and meek one.Jared doesn't want to be there while Simon and sister Mallory(Sarah Bolger)are trying to make the best of things.When strange things start to happen(possessions are taken and/or broken) the blame goes squarely on Jared who they think is acting out;but no one believes he is innocent.When Jared hears a knock in the wall but no one is around he finally gets his proof.He follows the noise upward through a dumbwaiter to the attic.In the attic he finds a book called the Field Guide to the Fantastical World around You,by the former owner Arthur Spiderwick,who went missing years before.The noise turns out to have been a small creature called a Brownie.If he is provoked he turns into a Bogart who can only be assuaged by honey,which returns him to a Brownie.Of course he becomes upset several times throughout the movie but his main duty,as set down by Arthur Spiderwick(David Strathairn),is to protect the book.As things progress his brother and sister come to believe and see what Jared sees.There is a ring of salt around all around the windows and a ring of stones around the house.This is to keep the evil creatures that vie to take possession of the book,away from the house.The Brownie gives Jared a round stone with glass in it with which to see the unseen and when he looks out to the outer perimeter of the house,beyond the stones,he sees a myriad of different creatures all trying to get passed the barrier.When his brother Simon gets captured by the creatures he sets out to rescue him.He meets up with a hobgoblin called Hogsqueal who spits in his face and gives him the ""sight"";the ability to see the fantastical world around him without the round stone.Hogsqueal loves to eat birds,which will come in handy later on.He also sees Mulgrath a shape shifting ogre who is bound and determined to take over the world.When Mulgrath realizes he has the wrong brother he sends him back to get the book.He is followed and Jared and Simon run back,barely making it beyond the stone barrier.The brothers and Molly try and formulate a plan.They will try and seek out old Aunt Lucinda in the nearby home to get her advice.Without the knowledge of the Brownie or anyone,Jared smuggles part of the field guide out to the sanitarium with him.There they find their old Aunt living alone with many faeries who supply her with food and company.Jared tells her what has happened and to her shock he shows her the part of the book.She tells him the book was written by her father who disappeared many years before when she was very young(6 1/2)and who never returned.They must seek out Arthur Spiderwick who is not dead but being held by the faerie-like Sylphs.He is the only one who can help them to destroy the book.Before they leave however one of Mulgrath's goblins reaches through and grabs the partial pages and takes it to Mulgrath.In the meantime the children learn how to reach Arthur and summon a Griffin who takes them on a journey to see him in person.Arthur is being held in a trance like state and doesn't at first realize that what he sees is real.When he does Jared explains the situation and shows him the partial book.But the Brownie switched the book for a cookbook so the real partial book one is still back home.Arthur cannot help the youngsters but distracts the Sylphs with the book allowing the children to escape.Back home the Grace family is preparing for an all out assault by Mulgrath and his army of goblins,as the partial book has given him enough information to destroy the protective circle and enter the house.The assault comes as predicted and the creatures try everything they have but after a fever pitched battle they are finally defeated with a healthy dose of tomato sauce,whichdestroys all but Mulgrath.At the end of the battle Mulgrath changes into a bird in order to swoop down on Jared and the book but as he does Hogsqueal is in the branches of a nearby tree and his large tongue dispatches him forthwith.The Graces go to the home and bring Aunt Lucinda home.As they are standing on the porch they turn and see Arthur Spiderwick floating down on a circle of Sylphs.They have allowed him to come home briefly because the book is safe within the house,but he cannot stay.Lucinda asks if she can return with him.He takes her hand and they both leave,joined together after such a long separation.The Graces go back to their life,with new found knowledge but happy for their Aunt and her new life with her father.This movie's special effects are dazzling,especially Freddie Highmore's turns as two brother,but they never,ever intrude on the story but constantly compliment it.The acting is wonderful throughout and the story moves along at an excellent pace,never bogging down on too many superfluous details.Nick Nolte does a good turn as the evil ogre Mulgrath and Andrew McCarthy makes a brief appearance as Jared's father.Technically the film has been transferred well and is in its' original widescreen a/r.Extras include the trailer,three featurettes including Its a Spiderwick World,It's all true and a Field Guide.This a movie the entire family can enjoy and I highly recommend the film to everyone of all ages.It is a film that deserves a wider audience than it has gotten.Get set to enter a world of Goblins,Griffins,Sylphs,Faeries,Elves,Trolls and many more;the fantastical world of Arthur Spiderwick.",4,4 1/2 stars-A pleasing look at the Spiderwick world!,1280102400,"07 26,

658589,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPXS,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","Regardless of how faithful The Spiderwick Chronicles movie is to the original stories by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, the film is tremendously entertaining and thankfully resolute. Unlike the recent flock of fantasy epics including The Golden Compass and The Seeker, which conclude feeling wholly unsatisfactory due to an abrupt resolution that suggests further films in the series, The Spiderwick Chronicles easily stands alone as a complete story. With sensationally mirthful creature designs and likeable human characters, topped with state-of-the-art special effects, The Spiderwick Chronicles is another big win for Paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008.The moment the Grace family moves into the dilapidated Spiderwick Estate, strange things begin to happen. Jared (Freddie Highmore) is a curious, adventurous boy who quickly seeks out the hidden cob-web-covered remains of great great uncle Arthur Spiderwick's laboratory. He unleashes a mysterious force when he locates a field guide full of the secrets of the magical creatures that inhabit the forest surrounding the mansion. His twin brother Simon is calm and reserved and very much the intellectual one, but is rapidly drawn into the fantastical world of faeries and goblins. Older sister Mallory and their mom are harder to convince, but after the almighty and ruthless ogre leader Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) begins to attack the home, everyone must band together to combat the hordes of goblins and ensorcelled creatures that lurk outside.The Spiderwick Chronicles is, on the surface, an alluringly delightful fantasy that blends the very best of character designs, both human and CG, into a story that effortlessly engrosses without stumbling out of the realm of suspended disbelief. Everything within the story makes sense as it unfolds, and we don't question why certain things are feasible - because as the world of goblins and boggers is defined, we have no reason not to become completely immersed in the fantasy. Director Mark Waters doesn't rush the process of illustrating the multitude of magic and myths, and doesn't overload us with jargon that we couldn't possibly comprehend. The pacing is fantastic for a family film, and doesn't fall into the three hour trap that The Lord of the Rings sets.The children have more appeal and charismatic personalities than those of the Narnia kids, and the creatures are more loveable and waggish than those in Harry Potter. Each computer animated monstrosity and cuddly ally beautifully blend into the forested environment, and never reach a level of utter annoyance. The designs themselves are ingenious, with a mix of gelatinous abominations like Redcap, the angry henchman goblin, a furry old hamster-like man (Thimbletack, voiced by Martin Short) who speaks in rhyme, and a mighty griffin that soars above the picturesque clouds. Eloquently wispy faeries and an enormous horned ogre are also substantial parts of the Spiderwick mythology, and many other exciting creatures frequent this action-filled fairyland.The Spiderwick Chronicles undeniably makes fantasy and magic fun. While a few scenes of unnecessary predicaments involving the children's divorced parents could have been cut, the film manages not to be overly preachy, even with its many positive messages and abounding morals. With pleasing characters, family-friendly magical adventure and a mind-bogglingly fantastical world of faeries, goblins and ogres, The Spiderwick Chronicles is extraordinarily entertaining fantasy fun.- The Massie Twins",4,The Spiderwick Chronicles Movie Review,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3538,"['Regardless', 'how', 'faithful', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'movie', 'original', 'stories', 'Tony', 'DiTerlizzi', 'Holly', 'Black', 'film', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'thankfully', 'resolute', 'recent', 'flock', 'fantasy', 'epics', 'including', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Seeker', 'conclude', 'feeling', 'wholly', 'unsatisfactory', 'due', 'abrupt', 'resolution', 'further', 'films', 'series', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'easily', 'alone', 'complete', 'story', 'sensationally', 'mirthful', 'creature', 'designs', 'likeable', 'human', 'characters', 'topped', 'state-of-the-art', 'special', 'effects', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'big', 'win', 'Paramount', 'high', 'bar', 'family', 'films', '2008.The', 'moment', 'Grace', 'family', 'dilapidated', 'Spiderwick', 'Estate', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'Jared', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'curious', 'adventurous', 'boy', 'who', 'quickly', 'out', 'hidden', 'cob-web-covered', 'remains', 'great', 'great', 'uncle', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'laboratory', 'mysterious', 'force', 'when', 'field', 'guide', 'full', 'secrets', 'magical', 'creatures', 'inhabit', 'forest', 'surrounding', 'mansion', 'twin', 'brother', 'Simon', 'calm', 'reserved', 'very', 'much', 'intellectual', 'one', 'rapidly', 'drawn', 'fantastical', 'world', 'faeries', 'goblins', 'Older', 'sister', 'Mallory', 'mom', 'are', 'harder', 'convince', 'almighty', 'ruthless', 'ogre', 'leader', 'Mulgarath', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'attack', 'home', 'everyone', 'must', 'band', 'together', 'combat', 'hordes', 'goblins', 'ensorcelled', 'creatures', 'lurk', 'outside.The', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'surface', 'alluringly', 'delightful', 'fantasy', 'very', 'best', 'character', 'designs', 'human', 'CG', 'story', 'effortlessly', 'stumbling', 'realm', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'Everything', 'story', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'question', 'why', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'feasible', 'world', 'goblins', 'boggers', 'defined', 'have', 'reason', 'not', 'become', 'completely', 'immersed', 'fantasy', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Waters', ""n't"", 'rush', 'process', 'illustrating', 'multitude', 'magic', 'myths', ""n't"", 'overload', 'jargon', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'comprehend', 'pacing', 'fantastic', 'family', 'film', ""n't"", 'fall', 'three', 'hour', 'trap', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'sets.The', 'children', 'have', 'more', 'appeal', 'charismatic', 'personalities', 'Narnia', 'kids', 'creatures', 'are', 'more', 'loveable', 'waggish', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'computer', 'animated', 'monstrosity', 'cuddly', 'ally', 'beautifully', 'blend', 'forested', 'environment', 'never', 'reach', 'level', 'utter', 'annoyance', 'designs', 'are', 'ingenious', 'mix', 'gelatinous', 'abominations', 'Redcap', 'angry', 'henchman', 'goblin', 'furry', 'old', 'hamster-like', 'man', 'Thimbletack', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Short', 'who', 'rhyme', 'mighty', 'griffin', 'picturesque', 'clouds', 'Eloquently', 'wispy', 'faeries', 'enormous', 'horned', 'ogre', 'are', 'also', 'substantial', 'parts', 'Spiderwick', 'mythology', 'many', 'other', 'exciting', 'creatures', 'frequent', 'action-filled', 'fairyland.The', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'undeniably', 'fantasy', 'magic', 'fun', 'few', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'predicaments', 'involving', 'children', 'divorced', 'parents', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'overly', 'preachy', 'even', 'many', 'positive', 'messages', 'abounding', 'morals', 'pleasing', 'characters', 'family-friendly', 'magical', 'adventure', 'mind-bogglingly', 'fantastical', 'world', 'faeries', 'goblins', 'ogres', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'extraordinarily', 'entertaining', 'fantasy', 'fun.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

The family home is available to them because Aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright), the 86 year-old daughter of Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn), has finally gone to the sanatorium to live out the remainder of her life. Almost immediately, Jared, the more rebellious, surly of the twins, suspects there are creatures living in the house. He soon finds Spiderwick's secret study and a handmade book covered with a wax seal and a warning. ""Do Not Open This Book"". Naturally, Jared opens the book and learns of Spiderwick's lifelong obsession with faeries, goblins and trolls. Throughout his life, Spiderwick documented everything about these creatures, charms, cures, protective spells. As soon as he finished the book, Mulgarath (voiced by Nick Nolte), a huge, monstrous troll, made it his quest to get the book because once he has the information in his possession, he has control over all beasts, including humans. Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short), a house elf, helps to protect the book and Hogsqueal (voice by Seth Rogen) helps the family in their battle against Mulgarath and his goblins. Naturally, as soon as Jared reads the book, he becomes a target and Simon and Mallory have to help him fight off the troll and his minions. Their mother, dealing with a move, a divorce and family problems, is slow to catch on, but once she does, she helps with the battle.Based on a series of popular children's books ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a very well-made, exciting, fast-paced film for the whole family. It has the detail, the level of danger and the characters most filmmakers strive for when making a film they hope will join the cannon of family classics like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and the dozens of other family classics.Directed by Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"", ""Freaky Friday""), the child actors are really good. Freddie Highmore, who was so memorable in ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", plays twin brothers Jared and Simon. Twins are difficult for adult actors to play, so it seems even more remarkable that Highmore is able to create and maintain distinct personalities for both. Jared is the more rebellious one; Simon is the quieter, more accepting child. When they first arrive at the Spiderwick house, it quickly becomes apparent Jared would rather be somewhere else. He has his iPod turned up so loud so he can refrain from interacting with his brother, his sister and most especially, his mother, who he considers responsible for his parent's divorce. In fact, he is waiting for their dad, Richard (Andrew McCarthy) to show up and take him away to live with him. Jared is also the more adventurous brother, so when he finds a mysterious book marked ""Do Not Open"", he will, of course, open it. Simon's the more reflective, quieter brother. He realizes there is a rift in the family and wants to try to help repair it. But he is also willing to follow his brother just about anywhere. So when it becomes apparent Jared's actions in opening the Spiderwick Chronicles have placed them all in danger, Simon immediately jumps into the fray and fights alongside his brother.Sarah Bolger plays Mallory, the older sister, and she is also good. As with older siblings, she knows and realizes things the younger kids won't and can't, and tries to help her mom deal with the situation. She is, initially, unable to believe Jared and Simon's tales of creatures living in another world just outside the house, trying to break through. But when she gets a glimpse of them, she joins her brothers and brings her unique skills to the mix.Mary-Louise Parker plays Helen, the divorced single mom trying to make a fresh start of it in the dilapidated family mansion. So often in `family films' the story is centered around the kids and the adults are barely a presence in their life, receiving little, if any, attention from the filmmakers. In ""Spiderwick"", Helen has a lot of issues of her own, things she is trying to deal with as she tries to raise these three kids on her own. She yells too much and doesn't listen, two key problems she has to deal with, which will also play a significant role in later events in the story. It is nice to see a fully fleshed out adult role in a `family film' like this.David Strathairn plays Arthur Spiderwick, the man who spent his entire life chronicling everything her could about the faeries, goblins and trolls living around him. As soon as he finished the book, he sets into effect events that will affect and follow his family for eighty years. His role is brief, but no less memorable. His actions have flavored every frame of the film, and we always remember him and what he has done.Joan Plowright, a formidable actress, plays Aunt Lucinda, a woman who has had to live with the consequences of her fathers' actions, alone, for the last eighty years. She plays a key role in the action late in the film, giving the family the extra knowledge they need to beat Mulgarath.The voice actors (Nick Nolte, Martin Short and Seth Rogen) are all good. Surprisingly, Short is pleasantly low-key, giving his character, a house elf who helps Arthur Spiderwick protect his book, a believable fairy tale quality.""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a beautiful film to watch and this can only be credited to Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer who directed ""The Black Stallion"" and has worked as a cinematographer on dozens of other films. He captures the look and feel of what I have to guess is upstate New York, in the fall, in all its wonder and glory. The film mimics the palette of falling leaves, painting everything in orange, brown and dark yellow tones. It is really a beauty.And this beauty meshes abnormally well with the CGI. Early on, the story establishes the boundaries of the human world and the magical world explored by Arthur Spiderwick. When he realizes he needs to protect his family, he creates a barrier around the house to protect them from attack. As soon as he finishes his book, he creates a need for Mulgarath to enter our world, so an alternate world is opened. Because these two worlds are so similar, little is done to make one seem different. The world inhabited by the magical creatures is a little more saturated with color, but that is about it. When these creatures pop up, they magically appear and seem to blend in to this world effortlessly. This is a key of how good the CGI is, and how well it blends with Deschanel's cinematography. It all appears seamless. There is a level of reality to them, making them appear more realistic.Spiderwick also creates a special monocle lens allowing its wearer to see the other creatures. This allows for some interesting and exciting battles, especially in the beginning. Mallory, who is good at fencing, uses the lens to battle off the creatures, turning to fight them only when she able to see them. Later, there is a plot point negating the need for this lens, making the battles less interesting. Until Mom needs some help, to protect her and help her kids fight off the attackers.Director Waters has done a great job of combining believable performances, beautiful cinematography and great special effects in a rousing adventure for the whole family. Better yet, the film creates a definite feeling of menace for the characters, giving them a real goal to fight for, giving the audience something to root for. And the outcome is moving as well as believable. If you are able to suspend your disbelief a little and go with the flow of the story.",4,"Pretty, Darned Good",1203552000,"02 21, 2008",2008,7759,"['Jared', 'Simon', 'Grace', 'Freddie', 'Highmore',

658593,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JPXS,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","The Spiderwick Chronicles is based on a series of popular children's fantasy novels written by Holly Black and Tony Di Terlizzi.  The first book premiered in 2003 with four more following in the next two years.  The film essentially encompasses the major plot of the five novels although a number of sub-plots and characters are left out and several significant changes were made to streamline the production, such moving the climactic battle from Mulgarath's castle to the Spiderwick estate.The story centers on the Grace family, twins Jared and Simon, older sister Mallory, and mom Helen, who move into the country estate they inherited from their Aunt Lucinda(Joan Plowright) who is now living in a psychiatric facility.  Freddie Highmore plays the roles of Jared and Simon Grace in a remarkable performance.  I was convinced that they really were twins as Highmore gives each character a distinct personality and mannerisms.  Jared is the agitator and angry with his parents for splitting up and forcing the move to the country.  Simon is a thoughtful pacifist and animal lover.  Highmore's performance as the twins, as well as the technical aspect of having them onscreen together is flawless.Jared discovers an old key that opens a truck in the study of Arthur Spiderwick, Lucinda's father.  Inside he finds a book, Spiderwick's Field Guide and a note warning not to open the book.  Well of course Jared opens the book, unleashing evil forces.  Jared meets a Brownie named Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short) who scolds him for opening the book.  He warns him that Mulgarath (Nick Nolte), a shape-shifting ogre, wants the book to unlock its magical secrets and gain dominion over the world.  He has a legion of goblins, trolls, and other beasties to aid him.  A magical circle protects the house, but Mulgarath has found a way to dispel the enchantment, putting the family in peril.  The grace family has to find a way to defeat Mulgarath before he can get his hands on the book.The Spiderwick Chronicles is an enjoyable film for the whole family and vastly superior to other recent films based on children's/teen fantasy novels, The Golden Compass and Seeker: The Dark is Rising. The Spiderwick Chronicles is geared to kids but could be too intense for young children as some of the monsters, Mulgarath most notably, are quite terrifying.  Martin Short is amusing as Thimbletack, the jittery-tempered brownie who can only be calmed by guzzling fresh honey.  Seth Rogen provides the voice for Hogsqueal, a Hobgoblin who aids the children.There is a lot of CGI in Spiderwick that threatens to overwhelm the story when there are dozens of goblins scurrying about and the massive Mulgarath smashing down walls.  Still, it has its subtle moments as well with the gentle Sylphs who kidnap Arthur Spiderwick to keep him safe.  The tiny fairies look like dandelion fluffs blowing in the wind.  The simplicity of the plot also makes it very watchable for kids and probably the reason why so many of the book's subplots were dropped.",4,One of the Better Recent Juvenile Fantasy adaptations,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,3031,"['Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'based', 'series', 'popular', 'children', 'fantasy', 'novels', 'written', 'Holly', 'Black', 'Tony', 'Di', 'Terlizzi', 'first', 'book', 'premiered', '2003', 'four', 'more', 'following', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'film', 'essentially', 'major', 'plot', 'five', 'novels', 'number', 'sub-plots', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'several', 'significant', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'streamline', 'production', 'such', 'moving', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Mulgarath', 'castle', 'Spiderwick', 'estate.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Grace', 'family', 'twins', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'older', 'sister', 'Mallory', 'mom', 'Helen', 'who', 'move', 'country', 'estate', 'inherited', 'Aunt', 'Lucinda', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'psychiatric', 'facility', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'roles', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'Grace', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'was', 'convinced', 'really', 'were', 'twins', 'Highmore', 'character', 'distinct', 'personality', 'mannerisms', 'Jared', 'agitator', 'angry', 'parents', 'splitting', 'up', 'forcing', 'move', 'country', 'Simon', 'thoughtful', 'pacifist', 'animal', 'lover', 'Highmore', 'performance', 'twins', 'as', 'well', 'technical', 'aspect', 'having', 'onscreen', 'together', 'flawless.Jared', 'discovers', 'old', 'key', 'truck', 'study', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'Lucinda', 'father', 'book', 'Spiderwick', 'Field', 'Guide', 'note', 'warning', 'not', 'open', 'book', 'Well', 'course', 'Jared', 'book', 'unleashing', 'evil', 'forces', 'Jared', 'Brownie', 'named', 'Thimbletack', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Short', 'who', 'opening', 'book', 'Mulgarath', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'shape-shifting', 'ogre', 'book', 'unlock', 'magical', 'secrets', 'gain', 'dominion', 'world', 'legion', 'goblins', 'trolls', 'other', 'beasties', 'aid', 'magical', 'circle', 'house', 'Mulgarath', 'found', 'way', 'dispel', 'enchantment', 'putting', 'family', 'peril', 'grace', 'family', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'Mulgarath', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'book.The', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'vastly', 'superior', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'based', ""children's/teen"", 'fantasy', 'novels', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Seeker', 'Dark', 'Rising', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'geared', 'kids', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'young', 'children', 'monsters', 'Mulgarath', 'most', 'notably', 'are', 'quite', 'terrifying', 'Martin', 'Short', 'amusing', 'Thimbletack', 'jittery-tempered', 'brownie', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'calmed', 'guzzling', 'fresh', 'honey', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'voice', 'Hogsqueal', 'Hobgoblin', 'who', 'children.There', 'lot', 'CGI', 'Spiderwick', 'overwhelm', 'story', 'when', 'are', 'dozens', 'goblins', 'scurrying', 'massive', 'Mulgarath', 'smashing', 'down', 'walls', 'Still', 'subtle', 'moments', 'well', 'gentle', 'Sylphs', 'who', 'kidnap', 'Arthur', 'Spiderwick', 'keep', 'safe', 'tiny', 'fairies', 'look', 'dandelion', 'fluffs', 'blowing', 'wind', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'also', 'very', 'watchable', 'kids', 'probably', 'reason', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'book', 'subplots', 'were', 'dropped']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition

I would have liked a little more backstory on the creatures and less discussion of the family.  I would have also liked to see more diversity in the creatures and preferred less reality and more fantasy.  The books are filled with interesting tidbits that seem glossed over, but what can you expect from Hollywood today (they don't expect you to be able to read, after all).

658596,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPXS,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is a fantasy film with a slightly dark side. Though the film's premise is pretty familiar, its tone sometimes becomes a little different from other recent fantasy films like ""Stardust"" or ""The Golden Compass."" Some creatures such as fairies and goblins may look too grotesque or creepy, even scary for some kids - though adults may find something humorous in their behaviors.""The Spiderwick Chronicles,"" based on a series of children's novels by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, begins with the Grace family - spirited Mallory (Sarah Bolger, ""In America""), twins Jared and Simon (both by Freddie Highmore, ""August Rush"") and their mother Helen (Mary-Louise Parker) - moving into old ""Spiderwick"" estate. Those kids are not very happy living in this dilapidated house surrounded by thick woods. And this spooky house may be haunted. At least that's how Jared (Freddie Highmore) thinks when he notices something is crawling behind the wall.Jared, most adventurous (and most careless) one of the three children, discovers an old laboratory. There he finds an old book that has a note warning not to open it. Of course, he ignores it. He realizes his mistake too late when he knows the house is beleaguered by some invisible critters led by terrifying Mulgarath (cameo by Nick Nolte).Though the film's story may sound like zombie film, it is, as some reviewers point out, actually closer to ""Home Alone"" where clever children outwit ""bad"" goblins. The battles are, as IMDb's parents guide says, ""suspenseful but not too violent,"" but still some of the creatures (including ""good"" ones) may look too creepy for some. Remember the animation supervisor / characters designer is Phil Tippett, whose great visual effects works include those of ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Willow.""Entertaining and fun as it is, ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" is not perfect. The double role by Freddie Highmore does not work as it should because Simon is much weaker as character than Jared. The sub-plot about kids' parents can be much shorter. Some part of the film's actions is a bit conventional and the ending is ... well, certainly unique, but you may dislike it.Still director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Just Like Heaven"") keeps a good pace throughout, never wasting time before starting actions, and these actions are always fun to watch. Perhaps the readers of the original books have something to say about the way they were adapted, but overall I enjoyed watching ""The Spiderwick Chronicles.""",4,Very Entertaining Fantasy Film (Though Some Scenes May Be A Bit Scary for Younger Kids),1210032000,"05 6, 2008",2008,2499,"['Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'fantasy', 'film', 'slightly', 'dark', 'side', 'film', 'premise', 'pretty', 'familiar', 'tone', 'sometimes', 'little', 'different', 'other', 'recent', 'fantasy', 'films', 'Stardust', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'creatures', 'such', 'fairies', 'goblins', 'may', 'look', 'too', 'grotesque', 'creepy', 'even', 'scary', 'kids', 'adults', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'humorous', 'behaviors', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'based', 'series', 'children', 'novels', 'Tony', 'DiTerlizzi', 'Holly', 'Black', 'Grace', 'family', 'spirited', 'Mallory', 'Sarah', 'Bolger', 'America', 'Jared', 'Simon', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'August', 'Rush', 'mother', 'Helen', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'moving', 'old', 'Spiderwick', 'estate', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'living', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'surrounded', 'thick', 'woods', 'spooky', 'house', 'may', 'be', 'haunted', 'least', 'how', 'Jared', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'when', 'something', 'crawling', 'wall.Jared', 'most', 'adventurous', 'most', 'careless', 'one', 'three', 'children', 'discovers', 'old', 'laboratory', 'old', 'book', 'note', 'warning', 'not', 'open', 'course', 'mistake', 'too', 'late', 'when', 'house', 'beleaguered', 'invisible', 'critters', 'led', 'terrifying', 'Mulgarath', 'cameo', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'film', 'story', 'may', 'sound', 'zombie', 'film', 'reviewers', 'point', 'out', 'actually', 'closer', 'Home', 'Alone', 'where', 'clever', 'children', 'bad', 'goblins', 'battles', 'are', 'IMDb', 'parents', 'guide', 'suspenseful', 'not', 'too', 'violent', 'still', 'creatures', 'including', 'good', 'ones', 'may', 'look', 'too', 'creepy', 'Remember', 'animation', 'supervisor', '/', 'characters', 'designer', 'Phil', 'Tippett', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'works', 'include', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Willow', 'Entertaining', 'fun', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'not', 'perfect', 'double', 'role', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'not', 'work', 'should', 'because', 'Simon', 'much', 'weaker', 'character', 'Jared', 'sub-plot', 'kids', 'parents', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'shorter', 'part', 'film', 'actions', 'bit', 'conventional', 'ending', 'well', 'certainly', 'unique', 'may', 'dislike', 'it.Still', 'director', 'Mark', 'Waters', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'Just', 'Heaven', 'good', 'pace', 'never', 'wasting', 'time', 'starting', 'actions', 'actions', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'Perhaps', 'readers', 'original', 'books', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'way', 'were', 'adapted', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles']",The Spiderwick Chronicles Field Guide Edition
