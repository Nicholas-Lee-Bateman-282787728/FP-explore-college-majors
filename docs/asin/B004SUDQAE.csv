1427548,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B004SUDQAE,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[11, 12]","I had to take a road-trip of my own four towns to the south to see Billy Bob Thornton in ""Waking Up In Reno"" because of its 'limited release' status.  But it was worth the trip.There were only six other people in the theater. All seven of us laughed at the appropriate times, so there are at least seven people in this part of southern Florida who recognize 'funny' when they see/hear it.I do not know why this movie is getting such bad reviews and bad press.  Maybe you have to be from the south to enjoy the humor.  I would say maybe you have to be a BBT fan, but I don't think that is true, because I would have enjoyed it anyway.  It isn't another Monster's Ball or Sling Blade, but it is funny and has just enough of a ring of truth in the situations and very believable characters (at least to us southern folk) to make it enjoyable, recognizable, cute and humerous.  Won't win any awards, but deserves better ink than it is getting.The premise for those of you who don't know is based on a road trip from Millsberg, Arkansas (pop 8,8??, too quick for my old eyes) to Reno with a detour to Amarillo so Billy Bob's character (Lonnie Earl Dodd) can win a $50.00 bet by eating a 72 oz. steak.  This is like a road-movie, but less like Hope and Crosby and more like Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo without the kids (although the two couples do often act a lot like kids).Patrick Swayze's character (Roy Kirkendall-sp?) is sweating the results of a pending fertility test; his wife, Candy, (Charlize Theron) is begging for a renewal of their marriage vows in Reno (because lots of people get re-married where gambling is legal); and Lonnie Earl's wife (Darlene Dodd) played by Natasha Richardson just 'isn't the girl that Lonnie married' anymore.Lonnie sells used-cars, Roy works for his father-in-law in a cat-food cannery, and Darlene is a stay-at-home mom, while Candy has transformed from 'Lonnie's supportive friend' to 'his afternoon delight'.  These are individuals who have been friends since grade school, but discover while on the road to Reno that there are still many things to be learned about one another.  The revelation of these little secrets 'just among friends' makes for some pretty hilarious antics in 'the 'Biggest Little City In The World'.From searching for midgets to roadside-bedroom antics for a grateful audience; from brawls on the casino floor, to bubble baths and room service; the four ""Wake Up"" to insights about themselves and their friends and relations.  Roy discovers his manhood in a most unlikely manner, Candy learns a secret that sends tremors through all the relationships, Darlene definitely gets her groove back, and Lonnie...well Lonnie may just be on the receiving end of one of the greatest acts of revenge a scorned woman has ever devised.....Brent Briscoe (The Killing Box, A Simple Plan, U-Turn, Sling Blade, and Minus Man, not a Billy Bob Thornton film, but starring Dwight Yoakam, who also was one of the producers of ""Waking Up In Reno"") is Russell Whitehead, small town cop.  I will need to see the flick again, but I believe I caught a brief, very brief, glimpse of Marty Stuart.  He was billed as a member of the 'musical group', but I thought I caught him in a crowd scene.  Tony Orlando plays himself in an integral part of locating 'the real' Darlene.  There are ooodles of great shots of Billy Bob's gorgeous brown eyes that you could drown in.  You also get to hear him sing a snippet of ""Hang On Sloopy"" (which might possibly be on his next CD).  There is a close-up of a kiss between BB and Natasha that will have his female fans drooling, at least it worked for me.All in all this was a very enjoyable film and I would recommend it to all Billy Bob's fans and anyone else who enjoys cute comedy with a just a little message tucked in the corners.Its a good'n.  See it soon at a theater that may NOT be near you.",4,"Not an award winner, but funny film.....",1035676800,"10 27, 2002",2002,3877,"['had', 'take', 'road-trip', 'own', 'four', 'towns', 'south', 'see', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Waking', 'Up', 'Reno', ""'limited"", 'release', 'status', 'was', 'worth', 'trip.There', 'were', 'only', 'six', 'other', 'people', 'theater', 'seven', 'laughed', 'appropriate', 'times', 'are', 'least', 'seven', 'people', 'part', 'southern', 'Florida', 'who', 'recognize', ""'funny"", 'when', 'see/hear', 'it.I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'movie', 'getting', 'such', 'bad', 'reviews', 'bad', 'press', 'Maybe', 'have', 'be', 'south', 'enjoy', 'humor', 'would', 'say', 'maybe', 'have', 'be', 'BBT', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'true', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', ""n't"", 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'funny', 'just', 'enough', 'ring', 'truth', 'situations', 'very', 'believable', 'characters', 'least', 'southern', 'folk', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'recognizable', 'cute', 'humerous', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'better', 'ink', 'getting.The', 'premise', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'based', 'road', 'trip', 'Millsberg', 'Arkansas', 'pop', '8,8', 'too', 'quick', 'old', 'eyes', 'Reno', 'detour', 'Amarillo', 'so', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'character', 'Lonnie', 'Earl', 'Dodd', 'can', 'win', '50.00', 'bet', 'eating', '72', 'oz', 'steak', 'road-movie', 'less', 'Hope', 'Crosby', 'more', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Beverly', 'DeAngelo', 'kids', 'two', 'couples', 'do', 'often', 'act', 'lot', 'kids', '.Patrick', 'Swayze', 'character', 'Roy', 'Kirkendall-sp', 'sweating', 'results', 'pending', 'fertility', 'test', 'wife', 'Candy', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'begging', 'renewal', 'marriage', 'vows', 'Reno', 'lots', 'people', 'get', 're-married', 'where', 'gambling', 'legal', 'Lonnie', 'Earl', 'wife', 'Darlene', 'Dodd', 'played', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'just', ""'is"", ""n't"", 'girl', 'Lonnie', 'married', 'anymore.Lonnie', 'used-cars', 'Roy', 'father-in-law', 'cat-food', 'cannery', 'Darlene', 'stay-at-home', 'mom', 'Candy', 'transformed', ""'Lonnie"", 'supportive', 'friend', ""'his"", 'afternoon', 'delight', 'are', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'grade', 'school', 'discover', 'road', 'Reno', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'things', 'be', 'learned', 'one', 'revelation', 'little', 'secrets', 'friends', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'antics', ""'the"", ""'Biggest"", 'Little', 'City', ""World'.From"", 'searching', 'midgets', 'roadside-bedroom', 'antics', 'grateful', 'audience', 'brawls', 'casino', 'floor', 'bubble', 'baths', 'room', 'service', 'four', 'Wake', 'Up', 'insights', 'friends', 'relations', 'Roy', 'manhood', 'most', 'unlikely', 'manner', 'Candy', 'secret', 'tremors', 'relationships', 'Darlene', 'definitely', 'groove', 'back', 'Lonnie', 'well', 'Lonnie', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'receiving', 'end', 'one', 'greatest', 'acts', 'revenge', 'scorned', 'woman', 'ever', 'devised', '..Brent', 'Briscoe', 'Killing', 'Box', 'A', 'Simple', 'Plan', 'U-Turn', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Minus', 'Man', 'not', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'film', 'starring', 'Dwight', 'Yoakam', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'one', 'producers', 'Waking', 'Up', 'Reno', 'Russell', 'Whitehead', 'small', 'town', 'cop', 'will', 'need', 'see', 'flick', 'again', 'believe', 'caught', 'brief', 'very', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'Marty', 'Stuart', 'was', 'billed', 'member', ""'musical"", 'group', 'thought', 'caught', 'crowd', 'scene', 'Tony', 'Orlando', 'integral', 'part', 'locating', ""'the"", 'real', 'Darlene', 'are', 'ooodles', 'great', 'shots', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'gorgeous', 'brown', 'eyes', 'could', 'drown', 'also', 'get', 'hear', 'sing', 'snippet', 'Hang', 'Sloopy', 'might', 'possibly', 'be', 'next', 'CD', 'close-up', 'kiss', 'BB', 'Natasha', 'will', 'have', 'female', 'fans', 'drooling', 'least', 'worked', 'me.All', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'fans', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'cute', 'comedy', 'just', 'little', 'message', 'tucked', 'corners.Its', 'good', 'n', 'See', 'soon', 'theater', 'may', 'NOT', 'be']",N/A

1427551,A2DJBY7UZOW6PD,B004SUDQAE,"W. Baker ""Under Down""","[0, 0]","Half the actors in this movie are very good,in fact they stole the movie, the other half very weak.The Good:  Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron.They really seemed to jump feet first into their characters and breathe huge amounts of life and originality into them. Billy bob is a car dealership owner who cheats on his wife (surprise!) and Charlize basically plays the same rather white-trash character she was in ""Monster"" 'cept she din't git no Oscar for this one. The most priceless scene in the movie is when Charlize learns she's pregnant but her husband is sterile. The look she and Billy Bob exchange is worth sitting through the whole movie! There are some very good comedy lines in this movie, but parts where it really sags.The Bad: Patrick Swayze and Nathasha Richardon. Swayze plays just too syrupy good, too much a complete doofus. Whenever he came onscreen, the momentum sort of died. Richardson, being British, handled the Texan drawwwwwwl just a little too strong to be believable. And her coldness towards her husband which made him cheat was also too weak to be believed.All in all, not a bad comedy at all. Has a very, very nice ending, where all is forgiven and all remain friends.",3,Very Watchable,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,1205,"['actors', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'fact', 'stole', 'movie', 'other', 'half', 'very', 'weak.The', 'Good', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Charlize', 'Theron.They', 'really', 'seemed', 'jump', 'feet', 'first', 'characters', 'breathe', 'huge', 'amounts', 'life', 'originality', 'Billy', 'bob', 'car', 'dealership', 'owner', 'who', 'wife', 'surprise', 'Charlize', 'basically', 'same', 'rather', 'white-trash', 'character', 'was', 'Monster', 'di', ""n't"", 'git', 'Oscar', 'one', 'most', 'priceless', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Charlize', 'pregnant', 'husband', 'sterile', 'look', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'exchange', 'worth', 'sitting', 'whole', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'lines', 'movie', 'parts', 'where', 'really', 'sags.The', 'Bad', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Nathasha', 'Richardon', 'Swayze', 'just', 'too', 'syrupy', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'complete', 'doofus', 'Whenever', 'came', 'onscreen', 'momentum', 'sort', 'died', 'Richardson', 'being', 'British', 'handled', 'Texan', 'drawwwwwwl', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'strong', 'be', 'believable', 'coldness', 'husband', 'made', 'cheat', 'was', 'also', 'too', 'weak', 'be', 'believed.All', 'not', 'bad', 'comedy', 'very', 'very', 'nice', 'ending', 'where', 'forgiven', 'remain', 'friends']",N/A
