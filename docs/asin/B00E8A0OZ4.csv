1665129,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00E8A0OZ4,atmj,"[1, 1]","This DVD has 4 workouts.  3 are the main advertised ones and the 4th is a short core workout.They are:1. The Total body Workout: 21:25 minutes long2. Long & Lean Waistline Workout: 23:10 minutes long3. Lower body Lift & Sculpt Workout: 21:30 minutes long4. Core Strengthener: 11:15 minutes longHaving done Pilates for a number of years, I figured these workouts would be familiar and they were.  However the author: Elizabeth Ordway has added a few unique twists which I enjoyed.  I found the following:The total body workout, had a great arm routine that will be great for most office workers, who suffer from weak shoulders after years of slouching (guilty here). I also found this was a very accessible workout.  Most people can do this.Long & Lean Waistline, I felt was not as basic as the total body workout. This is a pet peeve of mine.  When it says beginner, it should be doable by most people or with modifications for those that have limitations. I found the author did not do modifications, so it is  a case of do or not do.  Having done pilates for years I could do all of the routines, but they were hard. Also with a single yoga mat on a hard surface this can be a bit rough on your tail bone.Lower body Lift & Sculpt was nicely tiring.  I felt this was accessible to the beginner.  But, they may not be able to do the number of reps or all the exercises called for in this.  That is okay, as at least they can do some and work up to the rest.The extra core workout, might be a good one to help you prep for the Long & Lean Waistline.  This was very doable.Overall this is a decent set of routines to get you into Pilates.The best way to approach this is, to watch the routines though first once, so you are aware of technique and transitions.  Then the first few times you do the routines they will seem fast as you are trying to watch and do.  Finally the instructions will make sense and you can just follow by listening.  The speed then seems more appropriate.As with prior element DVDs, I have owned however I have complained about the background music being too loud.  This one was also a bit much, but not as bad as it seemed in a Yoga routine.  Maybe I see Pilates as being more physical and Yoga being more mental.  Then the music seems like noise and inappropriate to the routine..I will continue to do these exercises and report back on what long term use does for me. With my prior Pilates experience, I know the results should be as promised.",5,Decent beginner to intermediate routines.

1665130,A3HZHTHOSEHHXT,B00E8A0OZ4,Avril Sol,"[0, 1]","Got this DVD because I was hitting a plateau with my regular Callanetics and yoga routines. Callanetics is great, but Callan Pinckney had only made a limited number of videos, so once you know all the exercises, your body knows them very well and kinda loses the challenge. Haven't tried Pilates yet, mainly because when it first came into vogue, I noticed more than half his movements were taken from Callan Pinckney, and the rest were yoga stretches/moves. Yet Pilates never acknowledged his sources (especially Pinckney).This DVD is truly for beginners. You can easily follow the moves, especially if you've been doing yoga or Callanetics or other stretching exercises for a while. (If not, Ordway walks you through fewer reps and easier positions.) Ordway does mention various ways you can make the movements more advanced or challenging. I liked the way she chose Pilates moves that were adaptations of Callanetics, which meant I could use the same stretches I use with Callanetics but with more muscle and movement variation, creating a challenge for me--which was my original purpose in getting this DVD.  The exercises are good for maintaining suppleness and limberness in your muscles, and they give you a very good posture, especially if you're getting older and your body tends to curve at the spine. Pilates, like Callanetics and yoga, strengthens your core muscles (abdominals) and the lower spine, both of which are the foundation of your whole muscular and skeletal systems, respectively, making them stronger and able to carry your weight into old age. The stronger your core, the stronger your back, the flatter your tummy is, the less likely you are to shrink as you get older. Shrinking by quarters of an inch each year happens ""naturally"" as we age, but who says you have to give in to it sooner than you have to? The exercises in this DVD stretch your back all the time if you do them regularly, so you're always at your tallest and leanest. I'm already researching into the more advanced stage after this DVD. As a variation with Callanetics and yoga, this is really good!",5,Great for both beginners and seasoned Pilates exercisers!,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2094,"['Got', 'DVD', 'was', 'hitting', 'plateau', 'regular', 'Callanetics', 'yoga', 'routines', 'Callanetics', 'great', 'Callan', 'Pinckney', 'had', 'only', 'made', 'limited', 'number', 'videos', 'so', 'once', 'know', 'exercises', 'body', 'very', 'well', 'kinda', 'challenge', 'Have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Pilates', 'yet', 'mainly', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'vogue', 'noticed', 'more', 'movements', 'were', 'taken', 'Callan', 'Pinckney', 'rest', 'were', 'yoga', 'stretches/moves', 'Pilates', 'never', 'acknowledged', 'sources', 'especially', 'Pinckney', '.This', 'DVD', 'truly', 'beginners', 'can', 'easily', 'follow', 'moves', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'Callanetics', 'other', 'stretching', 'exercises', 'while', 'not', 'Ordway', 'fewer', 'reps', 'easier', 'positions', 'Ordway', 'mention', 'various', 'ways', 'can', 'make', 'movements', 'more', 'advanced', 'challenging', 'liked', 'way', 'chose', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'were', 'adaptations', 'Callanetics', 'meant', 'could', 'use', 'same', 'stretches', 'use', 'Callanetics', 'more', 'muscle', 'movement', 'variation', 'creating', 'challenge', 'was', 'original', 'purpose', 'getting', 'DVD', 'exercises', 'are', 'good', 'maintaining', 'suppleness', 'limberness', 'muscles', 'give', 'very', 'good', 'posture', 'especially', ""'re"", 'getting', 'older', 'body', 'curve', 'spine', 'Pilates', 'Callanetics', 'yoga', 'core', 'muscles', 'abdominals', 'lower', 'spine', 'are', 'foundation', 'whole', 'muscular', 'skeletal', 'systems', 'respectively', 'making', 'stronger', 'able', 'carry', 'weight', 'old', 'age', 'stronger', 'core', 'stronger', 'back', 'flatter', 'tummy', 'less', 'likely', 'are', 'shrink', 'get', 'older', 'Shrinking', 'quarters', 'inch', 'year', 'naturally', 'age', 'who', 'have', 'give', 'sooner', 'have', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'stretch', 'back', 'time', 'do', 'regularly', ""'re"", 'always', 'tallest', 'leanest', ""'m"", 'already', 'researching', 'more', 'advanced', 'stage', 'DVD', 'variation', 'Callanetics', 'yoga', 'really', 'good']",Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners
1665131,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00E8A0OZ4,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[4, 4]","NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.Like all of the offerings in the Element series, TARGETED TONING PILATES FOR BEGINNERS is set in an outdoor garden with the ocean as a backdrop.  Most of the DVDs in this series feature two workouts, but this video provides three PLUS a bonus abs segment.  The practices are led by certified Pilates instructor Elizabeth Ordway, who teaches via voiceover and provides mirrored cuing.  The only prop required for these routines is a mat.  I have described the workouts in greater detail below.TOTAL BODY LENGTHEN & STRENGTHEN (21:25 minutes)Ordway begins in a seated position for breathing, lengthening, seated chest expansion, and seated side stretch.  Remaining seated, she also performs bicep curls, triceps turns, arm circles, and roll back (light weights could easily be added for these moves).  Ordway then transitions to the floor for bridge/single leg bridge.  Abs-focused work follows, including abs curl, hundred, face-up frog, roll-ups, single leg bicycles and circles, and scissors.  After performing back extensions, Ordway stretches with spine stretch forward and saw and then finishes with rolling like a ball.LONG & LEAN WAISTLINE (23:10 minutes)For this abs-focuses routine, Ordway starts with the single leg and double leg stretches to warm up, then continues with a move she calls ""barre legs.""  For the obliques, she performs an oblique crunch and criss-cross.  Seated moves include a spine twist and roll-up with rotation.  Next, Ordway moves into ""elephant"" (a.k.a. down dog), pulling in the knees to work the abs.  Coming back down to the floor, she performs single leg teaser and single leg rocker prep.  The final sequence includes tick-tock, cobra kicks, and in a side kneeling position, leg lifts and pass&eacute;.  Ordway concludes with a mermaid stretch.LOWER BODY LIFT & SCULPT (21:30 minutes)This workout starts with a lengthy, thorough side kick series.  Ordway includes standard moves such as front/back, up/down, leg circles, and inner thigh lifts, but there are also some lesser-seen exercises, including knee dips, clamshells, and princess kicks.  For the last 5-6 minutes of this routine, Ordway performs an all-fours series that includes rear lifts, knee ins, and side karate kicks; between sides, she does a bird-dog, or alternating arm-leg balance, and this is how she concludes the workout.CORE STRENGTHENER BONUS (10 minutes)The section starts with a simple abdominal curl.  Ordway gradually ups the challenge, first lifting the feet to chair position and then to raised perpendicular to the ground.  Additional crunch versions include four-point crunch and targeted oblique touch.  Ordway then moves through criss-cross and single leg extension, and for her ""grand finale,"" she combines these two moves.  She finishes with a lying full-body stretch.I enjoyed these routines.  I like adding on Pilates to my other workouts, and so the length of these sessions felt just about perfect to me:  Ordway moves along at a nice, measured pace, and the time went by quickly.  However, as someone who has been practicing Pilates for over ten years and who considers myself to be at an approximately intermediate level, I disagree with the ""for beginners"" label of this DVD.  Ordway does offer some modifications, particularly during the total body workout, when she performs fewer repetitions and other easier versions of some classic Pilates moves.  Otherwise, however, Ordway includes some much more challenging exercises (e.g., corkscrew), and she does not provide the level of instruction that would be necessary for those truly new to Pilates.  For this reason, I would take a 1/2 star off my rating and rate the DVD at about 4 1/2 stars, as I would ONLY recommend the DVD for experienced Pilates practitioners and above.",5,"Great routines IF you are already familiar with Pilates--i.e., NOT for beginners!",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,3920,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online', 'Reviews', 'please', 'see', 'site', 'more', 'detailed', 'version', 'review.Like', 'offerings', 'Element', 'series', 'TARGETED', 'TONING', 'PILATES', 'FOR', 'BEGINNERS', 'set', 'outdoor', 'garden', 'ocean', 'backdrop', 'Most', 'DVDs', 'series', 'feature', 'two', 'workouts', 'video', 'three', 'PLUS', 'bonus', 'abs', 'segment', 'practices', 'are', 'led', 'certified', 'Pilates', 'instructor', 'Elizabeth', 'Ordway', 'who', 'voiceover', 'mirrored', 'cuing', 'only', 'prop', 'required', 'routines', 'mat', 'have', 'described', 'workouts', 'greater', 'detail', 'below.TOTAL', 'BODY', 'LENGTHEN', 'STRENGTHEN', '21:25', 'minutes', 'Ordway', 'seated', 'position', 'breathing', 'lengthening', 'seated', 'chest', 'expansion', 'seated', 'side', 'stretch', 'Remaining', 'seated', 'also', 'bicep', 'curls', 'triceps', 'turns', 'arm', 'circles', 'roll', 'back', 'light', 'weights', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'added', 'moves', 'Ordway', 'then', 'floor', 'bridge/single', 'leg', 'bridge', 'Abs-focused', 'work', 'including', 'abs', 'curl', 'hundred', 'face-up', 'frog', 'roll-ups', 'single', 'leg', 'bicycles', 'circles', 'scissors', 'performing', 'back', 'extensions', 'Ordway', 'spine', 'stretch', 'forward', 'saw', 'then', 'finishes', 'rolling', 'ball.LONG', 'LEAN', 'WAISTLINE', '23:10', 'minutes', 'abs-focuses', 'routine', 'Ordway', 'single', 'leg', 'double', 'leg', 'stretches', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'move', 'barre', 'legs', 'obliques', 'oblique', 'crunch', 'criss-cross', 'Seated', 'moves', 'include', 'spine', 'twist', 'roll-up', 'rotation', 'Next', 'Ordway', 'elephant', 'a.k.a', 'dog', 'pulling', 'knees', 'work', 'abs', 'Coming', 'back', 'down', 'floor', 'single', 'leg', 'teaser', 'single', 'leg', 'rocker', 'prep', 'final', 'sequence', 'tick-tock', 'cobra', 'kicks', 'side', 'kneeling', 'position', 'leg', 'lifts', 'pass', 'eacute', 'Ordway', 'mermaid', 'stretch.LOWER', 'BODY', 'LIFT', 'SCULPT', '21:30', 'minutes', 'workout', 'lengthy', 'thorough', 'side', 'kick', 'series', 'Ordway', 'standard', 'moves', 'such', 'front/back', 'up/down', 'leg', 'circles', 'inner', 'thigh', 'lifts', 'are', 'also', 'lesser-seen', 'exercises', 'including', 'knee', 'dips', 'clamshells', 'princess', 'kicks', 'last', '5-6', 'minutes', 'routine', 'Ordway', 'all-fours', 'series', 'rear', 'lifts', 'knee', 'ins', 'side', 'karate', 'kicks', 'sides', 'bird-dog', 'alternating', 'arm-leg', 'balance', 'how', 'workout.CORE', 'STRENGTHENER', 'BONUS', '10', 'minutes', 'section', 'simple', 'abdominal', 'curl', 'Ordway', 'gradually', 'challenge', 'first', 'lifting', 'feet', 'chair', 'position', 'then', 'raised', 'perpendicular', 'ground', 'Additional', 'crunch', 'versions', 'include', 'four-point', 'crunch', 'targeted', 'oblique', 'touch', 'Ordway', 'then', 'criss-cross', 'single', 'leg', 'extension', 'grand', 'finale', 'two', 'moves', 'lying', 'full-body', 'stretch.I', 'enjoyed', 'routines', 'like', 'adding', 'Pilates', 'other', 'workouts', 'so', 'length', 'sessions', 'felt', 'just', 'perfect', 'Ordway', 'along', 'nice', 'measured', 'pace', 'time', 'went', 'quickly', 'However', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'practicing', 'Pilates', 'ten', 'years', 'who', 'be', 'approximately', 'intermediate', 'level', 'disagree', 'beginners', 'label', 'DVD', 'Ordway', 'offer', 'modifications', 'particularly', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'when', 'fewer', 'repetitions', 'other', 'easier', 'versions', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'Otherwise', 'however', 'Ordway', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'exercises', 'e.g.', 'corkscrew', 'not', 'provide', 'level', 'instruction', 'would', 'be', 'necessary', 'truly', 'new', 'Pilates', 'reason', 'would', 'take', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', 'rate', 'DVD', 'about', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'would', 'ONLY', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'experienced', 'Pilates', 'practitioners', 'above']",Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners

1665135,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00E8A0OZ4,Colleen M. Schneider,"[2, 3]","Pilates is one of the exercises that I actually enjoy doing....maybe it is having taken dance as a kid and enjoying the precise movements, the pointed toes, the leg turn-out and the gracefulness of it.  You don't feel like you have a lot of wasted movement when doing pilates, you don't do 10,000 repetitions but those that you do are doing are well targeted and based in your core (aka: abs).  I never feel like I didn't get a good workout because it makes me feel like I worked effectively and like I had better posture (at least for a while) once I completed.  I very much enjoyed this beginning pilates dvd.  I would say this is easy enough to follow for a true beginner to an intermediate person.  If you are an absolute ace at the teaser move and need to have the more advanced moves, this is probably not for you.  I, however, don't do Pilates every day so this is plenty for me to keep my core in shape for now and I like the fact I can do it in 20 minute segments or can string several together for a longer workout.The DVD consists of 3 20 minute workouts (waistline, lower body lift & sculpt & total body lengthen & strengthen), and one 10 minute bonus core (abs) segment.  One day I did the waist and lower body and the other day I did the Total body and abs.  You can mix and match as you like and as you have time.  Pilates is a good way to see results of your hard work fairly quickly and to really build a strong lean core and strengthen your back.The instructor on this dvd is good- great cuing, good form and not too chatty-she gets in and gets the job done.  Motivating but not over the top.  I liked that.  The setting is familiar if you have done any of the element videos before, ocean, and a garden with a pool and pretty plants around it.

I enjoy doing Pilates, but where I did them had a rotating group of instructors, who tended to focus on different aspects of Pilates, instead of the ""completeness"" of the exercises.  With TARGETED TONING PILATES FOR BEGINNERS, the instructor, Elizabeth Ordway, not only shows one what you should ""look"" like when you do Pilates, but she explains which muscles should be exerted and how your body should be reacting to each exercise, so that you will be doing the Pilate's exercises correctly.The DVD contains three 20-minute workouts: Long & Lean Waistline, Lower Body Life & Sculpt, and Total Body Lengthen & Strengthen. This is, also, a 10-minute exercise on strengthening ones core.  I found all of the exercises to be very thorough and complete, especially for beginners, in that the exercise is explained and you are told how you should feel as you do the exercise.  This isn't a rah-rah type DVD, it is all business, and I view this as a plus.In addition to the health benefits of Pilates, I found being proficient in them prior to open-heart surgery was very beneficial in that it was easier for me to get out and back into bed after surgery because of my developed core.I would recommend this DVD to Pilates beginners and even if you have been doing Pilates for a while, especially if you find yourself hurting afterwards.  If you are hurting afterwards, chances are that you are doing something wrong, and this DVD will help you correct exercises you might be doing wrong.

The Lower body lift is ideal for toning your rear end, hips and thighs.  Of all the workouts, this one was my particular favorite, as I always seem to have problems in that area.There is a bonus 10 minute core strengthener that features more traditional toning of your tummy. This part of the DVD includes crunches and bicycle maneuvers.One warning-if you don't like to excersize, please don't buy this DVD.

As is also common with Element, there is just one exerciser demonstrating the exercises (so there is a more intimate vibe, but you have no modifiers for more or less intensity).This is a good strong start for a pilates practice, and it is a nice daily practice for those experience in pilates who don't feel like &#34;going for bear&#34; that day but still want a good workout.  The pace is slow (not that pilates is ever frantic, but this slower).  Beginners will not feel overwhelmed because you will have time to set up and position for each move (likewise, the moves are well sequenced and flow into one another).  There is lots of cuing, lots of explanation of what you are doing, form pointers (the downside being that those who like silence will probably feel like she never stops talking).In spite of the slow pace, some of the moves are deeper and some are more challenging than other beginner moves.  You are encouraged to challenge but not push yourself.Those who have a very, very significant amount of weight to lose will possibly find difficulty getting into some of the positions.

The answer is a resounding,""Yes!""This is a Pilates matwork dvd, and a lot of it, is frankly, taught out of order--and that is probably my only real complaint.  The real gem in this though, is the toning section for legs: one of the nasty little secrets about Pilates is that for people who don't genetically have dancer's bodies, Pilates matwork was never that effective; it does not create enough muscle mass to make your average pear-shaped woman any smaller. However, if you add exercises to the side-lying legs section of the classic matwork, then badaboom, all of a sudden, you start getting results.This is exactly what needs to be added to the classical Pilates matwork to make it work for your average person. This dvd has a phenomenal not-classic-added-exercises side-lying leg series that will produce results, if you stick with it.It's not for beginners; it's intermediate, which means it will actually do something. Imagine the Pilates side-lying leg sequence (think ballet exercises on your side) combined with the donkey kicks from ""Buns of Steel"", and the old Jane Fonda aerobics books, with a little Mary Helen Bowers,""Body Beautiful""-torture thrown in, shot in a pleasant tropical setting, and you'll have a good idea of what is on this dvd.This is worth it for the legs series alone.

Her voice is also very pleasant. The setting is also gorgeous with lots of greenery and flowers in a garden overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The music by Daveed also makes the whole experience relaxing for the mind all while the body is working out pretty hard. I will say this workout is more for those who are intermediate to advanced.The exercises are divided up into three 20-minute workouts. There is also a 10-minute Core Strengthener which is mostly crunches and other exercises like criss cross with leg extensions. Some of the exercises lengthen and flatten the abs.The three main workouts include:Total Body Workout - This will relax you all while making you feel the burn. Some moves are advanced and require strong abs. The exercises include arm circles, frog, roll up, leg circles, swan (very modified) and rolling like a ball.Long & Lean Waistline Workout - Even though this is for the abs you will be using your legs a lot and your legs might start shaking. The exercises include single leg stretch, double leg stretch, criss cross, single leg teaser, corkscrew, double leg lifts and mermaid. There are also some moves from yoga like cobra and downward dog that the instructor calls elephant for some reason.Lower Body Lift & Sculpt Workout - This segment tones the butt and includes exercises that you will recognize as a leg series. Grasshopper and cat/cow are also exercises to enjoy.If you do all three segments at one time you are going to be quite worn out and will probably feel sore the next day as I did.

Twenty minutes to stretch and tone, with easy to follow instructions that flow into each other, and an instructor who looks like I'd like to look.

I'm not willing to take the time to go to a gym, and the yoga video I tried, spent so much time with every pose that I found myself getting frustrated.  This video gets right to the point, works you out, and finishes up, and is divided into different parts so you can just work on your upper body or abs if you need to.I'm quite fit from years of running, but I had some abdominal soreness for a few days.  Nothing major, more of a good pain that says the workout is working.This is my first experience with Pilates and I'm glad I tried it.  I've tried yoga, both hot and cold, and a video and it's just a little too 'new age' for me.

The instructions are clear and the workout a perfect level of challenging and possible.Pilates is typically done on a mat so it doesn&#8217;t require standing but some balance is still necessary.  However, when you are close to the floor, losing your balance is not as worrisome.  The instructor, Elizabeth Ordway is lovely to watch as she flows through her elegant movements.  There were times I was not clear about how to sync my breath with the move because her instruction was not clear.  I think that with a few more viewings I'll get to where I know when to inhale and exhale, practice being key to getting it right.The DVD allows you to choose one of the three 20-minute workouts or play all three.  Unfortunately, it does not allow you to mix and match so you will work through them from first to last.  Don't expect a warm-up or cool-down because Pilates has an emphasis on working the core through stretches and balancing.  Someday when I can do all three, I'll be thrilled to do so.  For now, I was happy I was able to get through the first two with little difficulty and, even when something was challenging it was never discouraging.  I really like this DVD and it's a welcome addition to my collection.To the DVD distribution company, however, I have one very clear complaint.  I see no point in added a cardboard sleeve to the DVD case when the content on the sleeve duplicates what is on the case.  Less packaging, in this day and age, is not something to be taken lightly.

But I've been looking for more exercise DVDs to try out in the comfort of my home, and trying to push myself beyond yoga and jogging, so when I saw that this DVD had relatively short workouts (three 20 minute programs) I thought it would be worth trying.In each workout, I thought the instructor did a great job of explaining where the move should target and what the viewer should be experiencing - I think this is always especially important in home exercise videos since no one's around to tell you if you're doing something incorrectly.  Some of the positions were very challenging because my balance is poor, but at other times the stretches really felt great.  I think that some of the moves were a bit advanced for a mere beginner, but maybe I just felt especially self-conscious because I was struggling with something that Elizabeth Ordway did with such ease.Not being all that familiar with traditional pilates, I didn't notice anything unusual about the stretches, but some of the moves are &#34;invented&#34; or modified by Ordway so pilates purists may not like her changes.  But then again, it might provide a nice break from the usual routine.",4,"It might be a bit of a stretch to call this ""for Beginners""",1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1262,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'once', 'twice', 'past', 'never', 'been', 'major', 'part', 'exercise', 'routine', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'more', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'try', 'out', 'comfort', 'home', 'trying', 'push', 'yoga', 'jogging', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'had', 'relatively', 'short', 'workouts', 'three', '20', 'minute', 'programs', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'trying.In', 'workout', 'thought', 'instructor', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'explaining', 'where', 'move', 'should', 'target', 'what', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'experiencing', 'think', 'always', 'especially', 'important', 'home', 'exercise', 'videos', 'one', 'tell', ""'re"", 'doing', 'something', 'incorrectly', 'positions', 'were', 'very', 'challenging', 'balance', 'poor', 'other', 'times', 'stretches', 'really', 'felt', 'great', 'think', 'moves', 'were', 'bit', 'advanced', 'mere', 'beginner', 'maybe', 'just', 'felt', 'especially', 'self-conscious', 'was', 'struggling', 'something', 'Elizabeth', 'Ordway', 'did', 'such', 'ease.Not', 'being', 'familiar', 'traditional', 'pilates', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'anything', 'unusual', 'stretches', 'moves', 'are', '34', 'invented', '34', 'modified', 'Ordway', 'so', 'purists', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'changes', 'then', 'again', 'might', 'provide', 'nice', 'break', 'usual', 'routine']",Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners

The video is shot from angles that make all the moves very easy to follow, and the verbal instructions are also very clear.  The 20-minute sections target different areas of the body, and there is a bonus core workout.  I like having the option of picking just one or watching all of them in one long session. I was not sore the day after beginning these, but I could tell I'd worked out.This is a great DVD for people who want to start pilates!",5,Great Pilates DVD,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,519,"['targeted', 'Pilates', 'DVD', 'Beginners', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'video', 'shot', 'angles', 'make', 'moves', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'verbal', 'instructions', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'clear', '20-minute', 'sections', 'target', 'different', 'areas', 'body', 'bonus', 'core', 'workout', 'having', 'option', 'picking', 'just', 'one', 'watching', 'one', 'long', 'session', 'was', 'not', 'day', 'beginning', 'could', 'tell', ""'d"", 'worked', 'out.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'start', 'pilates']",Element: Targeted Toning Pilates for Beginners
