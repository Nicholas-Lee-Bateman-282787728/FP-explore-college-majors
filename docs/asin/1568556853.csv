185005,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,1568556853,Char,"[0, 0]","A family film well worth watching as a learning experience about the settling of America, and also as an emotional experience about the difficulty of keeping courage (and promises) when circumstances becoming really distressing-and-stressful.  Other reviews indicate that it is emotionally affecting both for children and adults.  I reacted to it variously with tears, and alternating feelings of tension and relief throughout.Many reviewers who've read the book say the book was much better because it gave a better sense of the relationship that developed between the young American boy and the Penobscot Indian boy.  The book also is said to give more detail about specific lessons for survival in the wilderness taught by the Indians.Without even having read the book, I felt a disappointment with the relationship between the two boys as depicted in the movie.  I think this was partly due to poor ""acting"" and partly due to the superficial treatment of the development of their relationship.  Both boy actors came across at times as ""wooden"".  I was chiefly aware that the only palpable feeling they ever radiated very distinctly was hostility.  (In fact, none of the Indians, even the grandfatherly one who looked like a sympathetic character, really expressed a clear and consistent friendship.  The motive behind the ""grandfather""'s benign relationship with the American boy seemed to be just learning how to read and write so as to prevent any further tricking of the Indians out of their land.)  The two boys never came across to me as completely sympathetic characters, or sympathetic ""PERSONS.""  The  eventual feelings of friendship and brotherhood that they supposedly developed never felt palpable or real to me.  I ""felt"" them mainly as just two stilted boy actors.  In fact, except for the characters of the parents and Loomis, other acting in the movie seemed stilted or at an elementary level--but maybe that is an effect deliberately produced in movies for young people because they may best recognize meanings through more elementary acting.The roles of the parents were so realistically acted that several scenes in the movie seemed to me to be suitable only for adult audiences.  These were the two scenes where the parents argue hotly, expressing angry reactions to one another which seem to threaten the solidity of their love relationship.  I think that in real life such scenes are distressing for children to observe, and perhaps they would feel the same way in reaction to movie arguments between parent figures.  There is also a scene of reconciliation between the parents conveyed by the depiction of a long ""smooch"" in the presence of the young daughter.  These scenes, I feel, might ""feel"" emotionally embarrassing, distressful and/or ""gross"" for children and young people--but I could be wrong about this.Otherwise, for any adults or young people looking for a good family movie to watch, this would be a good choice, a good film experience.  Also, just for adults who prefer movies that don't immerse the viewer in graphic sex scenes, this is an interesting enough story.  It's a visually colorful movie, probably a bit too idyllic-looking in spots to be really true-to-life.",4,A good family film,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,3210,"['family', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'learning', 'experience', 'settling', 'America', 'also', 'emotional', 'experience', 'difficulty', 'keeping', 'courage', 'promises', 'when', 'circumstances', 'becoming', 'really', 'distressing-and-stressful', 'Other', 'reviews', 'indicate', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'children', 'adults', 'reacted', 'variously', 'tears', 'alternating', 'feelings', 'tension', 'relief', 'throughout.Many', 'reviewers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'say', 'book', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'gave', 'better', 'sense', 'relationship', 'developed', 'young', 'American', 'boy', 'Penobscot', 'Indian', 'boy', 'book', 'also', 'said', 'give', 'more', 'detail', 'specific', 'lessons', 'survival', 'wilderness', 'taught', 'Indians.Without', 'even', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'felt', 'disappointment', 'relationship', 'two', 'boys', 'depicted', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'partly', 'due', 'poor', 'acting', 'partly', 'due', 'superficial', 'treatment', 'development', 'relationship', 'boy', 'actors', 'came', 'times', 'wooden', 'was', 'chiefly', 'aware', 'only', 'palpable', 'feeling', 'ever', 'radiated', 'very', 'distinctly', 'was', 'hostility', 'fact', 'none', 'Indians', 'even', 'grandfatherly', 'one', 'who', 'looked', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'really', 'expressed', 'clear', 'consistent', 'friendship', 'motive', 'grandfather', 'benign', 'relationship', 'American', 'boy', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'learning', 'how', 'read', 'write', 'so', 'prevent', 'further', 'tricking', 'Indians', 'land', 'two', 'boys', 'never', 'came', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'PERSONS', 'eventual', 'feelings', 'friendship', 'brotherhood', 'supposedly', 'developed', 'never', 'felt', 'palpable', 'real', 'felt', 'mainly', 'as', 'just', 'two', 'stilted', 'boy', 'actors', 'fact', 'characters', 'parents', 'Loomis', 'other', 'acting', 'movie', 'seemed', 'stilted', 'elementary', 'level', 'maybe', 'effect', 'deliberately', 'produced', 'movies', 'young', 'people', 'may', 'best', 'recognize', 'meanings', 'more', 'elementary', 'acting.The', 'roles', 'parents', 'were', 'so', 'realistically', 'acted', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'suitable', 'only', 'adult', 'audiences', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'parents', 'argue', 'hotly', 'expressing', 'angry', 'reactions', 'one', 'seem', 'threaten', 'solidity', 'love', 'relationship', 'think', 'real', 'life', 'such', 'scenes', 'are', 'distressing', 'children', 'observe', 'perhaps', 'would', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'reaction', 'movie', 'arguments', 'parent', 'figures', 'also', 'scene', 'reconciliation', 'parents', 'conveyed', 'depiction', 'long', 'smooch', 'presence', 'young', 'daughter', 'scenes', 'feel', 'might', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'embarrassing', 'distressful', 'gross', 'children', 'young', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'this.Otherwise', 'adults', 'young', 'people', 'looking', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'good', 'film', 'experience', 'Also', 'just', 'adults', 'who', 'prefer', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'immerse', 'viewer', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'interesting', 'enough', 'story', 'visually', 'colorful', 'movie', 'probably', 'bit', 'too', 'idyllic-looking', 'spots', 'be', 'really', 'true-to-life']",N/A

Like the other reviewer on here, I hated to see the Indians leave and thought they could have at least stayed for the winter.  I thought, too, that it was strange that the family said nothing when Loomis took their belongings into the woods and dumped them all there.  I know they didn't see it happen, but they would have noticed that their things were gone, wouldn't they?  But other than that, this movie is outstanding and is one I will watch over and over, I'm sure.
