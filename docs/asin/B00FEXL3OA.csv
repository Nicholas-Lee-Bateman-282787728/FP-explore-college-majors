However since I own all the other Madonna concerts on DVD I decided to purchase this one and give it another shot on my TV. I still didn't like it. lol  Some songs are really good, most are boring and couldn't keep my attention. Favorite is Open Your Heart - amazing rendition of this song! Makes me like it better than the original. Like A Virgin wanted to make me hang myself (you'll see). As usual Madonna concerts are not shot for the epileptic at heart, so if constant flipping frames aren't your thing, don't bother with this.

I've seen her in concert 6 times now (including the MDNA tour) & she never fails to please.  Nobody can put on a show like her.  But...This concert recording is just awful.  Between the fast (& CONSTANT) cuts from her to the crowd and back (again & again & again) and all of the &#34;special&#34; effects, it's almost nauseating to watch.  You can't even enjoy the show because as soon as your eyes are about to focus on something it cuts back to the crowd to cutting back to her to an overhead shot & all manners of colors and hues & most of the time it's not even really in focus.

1671409,AEL6AD2AL2UX8,B00FEXL3OA,"Kevin ""Revolution""","[15, 19]","The DVD sound and picture are perfect!  As for the show itself?  Absolutely incredible.  It starts off super dark and angry.  By the second and third number they're wielding guns with blood spattering on the screen.  It's ferocious, but don't let that turn you off as there is a point.  The whole show takes on a journey from dark to light as she transforms on stage.  There are about five separate sections within the show and by the second section Madonna appears as a cheerleader with a bright light extravaganza that is almost like a hot pep rally.  By the end of the show and the last section, she's transformed into a spiritual guru celebrating the power of life and spirit.It's mind blowing to watch this hard working woman on the stage.  Her showmanship is present in every frame.  Just watching her is motivating in itself.  Madonna's body looks incredible and even better than those in their 20's.  It's amazing to watch someone with so much energy and stamina.  She dominates the stage and shines the greatest when she's performing.  She's one of the final major entertainers left on the scene.  Michael Jackson was the other one and now he's gone.  When she was going on tour, I knew that I had to go see her regardless if she was going to be performing songs from an album that I found to be less than stellar.  She did not disappoint.If there are any negatives with this show, it's that the bulk of songs performed are from her MDNA album which wasn't the most popular or her best musically.  However, her performances on the stage are so fantastic that you quickly forget about the song and are mesmerized by all of the sets, the lights, the messages within the technically choreographed numbers.  That was another thing.  I've seen a lot of live shows and nothing compares to these dancers on the stage - including her.  She is a trained dancer first and foremost so its no surprise that she dominates that arena.  She does perform some old stuff including Papa Don't Preach, Hung Up, Express Yourself, Vogue, Like a Prayer, Open Your Heart, Like a Virgin.  Although a couple of those like Open Your Heart and Like a Virgin have a different musical arrangement that takes away the original flavor of the hit.  Still as I said, the performance on stage is top notch that you find yourself not caring that the song has been altered.  Highly recommend this show for those who want to be entertained and uplifted.",5,Mind blowing concert,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",2013,2425,"['DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'perfect', 'show', 'Absolutely', 'incredible', 'super', 'dark', 'angry', 'second', 'third', 'number', ""'re"", 'wielding', 'guns', 'blood', 'spattering', 'screen', 'ferocious', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'turn', 'off', 'point', 'whole', 'show', 'journey', 'dark', 'light', 'stage', 'are', 'five', 'separate', 'sections', 'show', 'second', 'section', 'Madonna', 'cheerleader', 'bright', 'light', 'extravaganza', 'almost', 'hot', 'pep', 'rally', 'end', 'show', 'last', 'section', 'transformed', 'spiritual', 'guru', 'celebrating', 'power', 'life', 'spirit.It', 'mind', 'blowing', 'watch', 'hard', 'working', 'woman', 'stage', 'showmanship', 'present', 'frame', 'Just', 'watching', 'motivating', 'Madonna', 'body', 'incredible', 'even', 'better', '20', 'amazing', 'watch', 'someone', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'stamina', 'stage', 'greatest', 'when', 'performing', 'one', 'final', 'major', 'entertainers', 'left', 'scene', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'other', 'one', 'now', 'gone', 'When', 'was', 'going', 'tour', 'knew', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'regardless', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'performing', 'songs', 'album', 'found', 'be', 'less', 'stellar', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint.If', 'are', 'negatives', 'show', 'bulk', 'songs', 'performed', 'are', 'MDNA', 'album', 'was', ""n't"", 'most', 'popular', 'best', 'musically', 'However', 'performances', 'stage', 'are', 'so', 'fantastic', 'quickly', 'forget', 'song', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'sets', 'lights', 'messages', 'technically', 'choreographed', 'numbers', 'was', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'live', 'shows', 'nothing', 'compares', 'dancers', 'stage', 'including', 'trained', 'dancer', 'first', 'foremost', 'so', 'surprise', 'arena', 'perform', 'old', 'stuff', 'including', 'Papa', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Preach', 'Hung', 'Up', 'Express', 'Yourself', 'Vogue', 'Prayer', 'Open', 'Your', 'Heart', 'Virgin', 'couple', 'Open', 'Your', 'Heart', 'Virgin', 'have', 'different', 'musical', 'arrangement', 'away', 'original', 'flavor', 'hit', 'Still', 'said', 'performance', 'stage', 'top', 'notch', 'find', 'not', 'caring', 'song', 'been', 'altered', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'uplifted']",Madonna: The MDNA Tour
