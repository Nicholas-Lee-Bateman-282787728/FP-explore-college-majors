Robert Hayes is at his best illustrating the lengths of someone who becomes obsessed with controlling another person. I shudder to think this is a reality for some women who are trapped in an unhealthy marriage.  I recommend this movie highly and hope that anyone trying to escape from an abusive relationship will watch this film.,5,Domestic Violence Thriller!,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,449,"['Victoria', 'Principal', 'excellent', 'performance', 'portraying', 'woman', 'being', 'stalked', 'very', 'disturbed', 'ex-husband', 'Robert', 'Hayes', 'best', 'illustrating', 'lengths', 'someone', 'who', 'obsessed', 'controlling', 'person', 'shudder', 'think', 'reality', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'unhealthy', 'marriage', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'hope', 'anyone', 'trying', 'escape', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'will', 'watch', 'film']",The Abduction

Paul's been stalking Kate since their bitter divorce two years earlier. He's been able to skirt the law due to his being a cop. Now, his efforts seem to be increasingly intense and violent. It becomes apparent that Paul will never stop in his mission to take his family back. First, he snags the boyfriend off the street at gunpoint! Next, after knocking out lover-boy, Paul abducts Kate. He grows more dangerous, and whiney, w/ each passing second.  Meanwhile, we're treated to flashbacks of Kate and Paul in their earlier years of marital ""bliss"", showing his gradual mental disintegration. THE ABDUCTION is an ok thriller. For her part, Ms. Principal is stellar, especially when she turns the tables on Paul. Hays is pretty convincing as a maniac, making us want to ring his neck!

It might give them the courage to leave before it is to late for many, which we all have seen with the murders of these women and children by their abusive husbands.and fathers.It also would not hurt men to watch these movies, as it may enlighten some to seek help before they either go to prison or end up dead.  Many men are now coming out against abusing women and that men have to stop, as well as buying women and girls for sex must stop.Watch this wonderful movie with some girlfriends, or even some male friends for a time of sitting on the edge of your seat waiting what will happen next to the wife and her abusive husband and her boyfriend.Below is the link to the movie &#34;Abduction&#34; join Amazon Prime and many movies are free to watch or rent them for a couple of dollars as well:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ8ILZ4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0",5,"""A Typical Personality Disorder"" are associated with many individuals in authority & this movie brings it out with a Policeman",1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,1490,"['Victoria', 'Principle', 'Robert', 'Hays', 'Chris', 'Lawford', 'who', 'Peter', 'Lawford', 'son', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'woman', 'Victoria', 'Principle', 'divorced', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Hays', 'Police', 'Officer', 'stalks', 'x-wife', 'then', 'kidnaps', 'beating', 'Chris', 'Lawford', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'marry', 'take', 'care', 'two', 'children.I', 'do', 'wish', 'more', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'abused', 'would', 'watch', 'movies', 'Lifetime', 'Television', 'are', 'true', 'stories', 'what', 'many', 'women', 'go', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'physical', 'mental', 'abuse', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'husband', 'might', 'give', 'courage', 'leave', 'late', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'murders', 'women', 'children', 'abusive', 'husbands.and', 'fathers.It', 'also', 'would', 'not', 'hurt', 'men', 'watch', 'movies', 'may', 'enlighten', 'seek', 'help', 'go', 'prison', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'Many', 'men', 'are', 'now', 'coming', 'out', 'abusing', 'women', 'men', 'have', 'stop', 'as', 'well', 'buying', 'women', 'girls', 'sex', 'must', 'stop.Watch', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'girlfriends', 'even', 'male', 'friends', 'time', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'wife', 'abusive', 'husband', 'boyfriend.Below', 'link', 'movie', '34', 'Abduction', '34', 'join', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'many', 'movies', 'are', 'free', 'watch', 'rent', 'couple', 'dollars', 'well', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ8ILZ4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0']",The Abduction
