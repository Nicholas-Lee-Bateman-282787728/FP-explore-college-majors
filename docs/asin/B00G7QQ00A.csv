1677437,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00G7QQ00A,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 2]","This movie has quirks piled on top of quirks, occasionally relying on exaggerated animation to develop the storyline. There are drama queens, drama kings and so much designed overacting that it almost reaches the point of annoyance.The fundamental plot is based on a centuries old curse in a Korean family where most of the members are now living in the United States, if a man does not get married before his thirtieth birthday then very dire things happen to him. Jason is within a few weeks of turning thirty but all is fine as his elaborate wedding is in progress. However, in the moment before she is to walk down the aisle, his spoiled brat (extreme drama queen daughter of a very rich family) of a fianc&eacute; bolts and runs off with one of the caterers. There is much swooning and chattering among the members of the family, those that haven't fainted are yelling at each other.Devastated, Jason still must face the curse so his best friend tells him to go to Korea to find a bride. Jason is an advertising executive and he is showing his latest creation to a management group. The ad has a man offering his date her choice of feminine hygiene products when the situation suddenly presents itself.Fortune seems to fall on Jason's side when he encounters a lovely Korean woman (Na Young) and with some help, the romantic sparks begin to fly. Jason must return to the United States but they are able to keep the romance going with elaborate and unusual online dating. Jason proposes and Na Young files to the United States for the wedding only to find that there are unexpected problems. The issue then becomes whether Jason will follow his heart or Korean tradition. Last-minute aid comes from an unexpected source that definitively resolves the issue.This is first and foremost a romantic comedy, while it drags at times from overacting the scene where Jason is at the airport dressed in an ancient Korean costume is hilarious. There are other scenes that are so incongruous that you have to laugh, although you must pay close attention or you will miss the joke. The actors occasionally speak Korean, sometimes within an English phrase so you have to watch the subtitles. When I was watching it I stopped and rewound a few times in order to get the full meaning of the joke. Sometimes stupid, often completely over the top, there are some very tender moments, so this is at the end a great romantic comedy.",5,Quirks piled on top of quirks in a great romantic comedy,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,2417,"['movie', 'quirks', 'piled', 'top', 'quirks', 'occasionally', 'relying', 'exaggerated', 'animation', 'develop', 'storyline', 'are', 'drama', 'queens', 'drama', 'kings', 'so', 'much', 'designed', 'overacting', 'almost', 'point', 'annoyance.The', 'fundamental', 'plot', 'based', 'centuries', 'old', 'curse', 'Korean', 'family', 'where', 'most', 'members', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'United', 'States', 'man', 'not', 'get', 'married', 'thirtieth', 'birthday', 'then', 'very', 'dire', 'things', 'happen', 'Jason', 'few', 'weeks', 'turning', 'thirty', 'fine', 'elaborate', 'wedding', 'progress', 'However', 'moment', 'walk', 'aisle', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'extreme', 'drama', 'queen', 'daughter', 'very', 'rich', 'family', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'bolts', 'off', 'one', 'caterers', 'much', 'swooning', 'chattering', 'members', 'family', 'have', ""n't"", 'fainted', 'are', 'yelling', 'other.Devastated', 'Jason', 'still', 'must', 'face', 'curse', 'so', 'best', 'friend', 'go', 'Korea', 'find', 'bride', 'Jason', 'advertising', 'executive', 'showing', 'latest', 'creation', 'management', 'group', 'ad', 'man', 'offering', 'date', 'choice', 'feminine', 'hygiene', 'products', 'when', 'situation', 'suddenly', 'itself.Fortune', 'fall', 'Jason', 'side', 'when', 'lovely', 'Korean', 'woman', 'Na', 'Young', 'help', 'romantic', 'sparks', 'begin', 'fly', 'Jason', 'must', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'are', 'able', 'keep', 'romance', 'going', 'elaborate', 'unusual', 'online', 'dating', 'Jason', 'Na', 'Young', 'United', 'States', 'wedding', 'only', 'find', 'are', 'unexpected', 'problems', 'issue', 'then', 'Jason', 'will', 'follow', 'heart', 'Korean', 'tradition', 'Last-minute', 'aid', 'unexpected', 'source', 'definitively', 'issue.This', 'first', 'foremost', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'times', 'overacting', 'scene', 'where', 'Jason', 'airport', 'dressed', 'ancient', 'Korean', 'costume', 'hilarious', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'incongruous', 'have', 'laugh', 'must', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'will', 'miss', 'joke', 'actors', 'occasionally', 'speak', 'Korean', 'sometimes', 'English', 'phrase', 'so', 'have', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'stopped', 'rewound', 'few', 'times', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'meaning', 'joke', 'Sometimes', 'stupid', 'often', 'completely', 'top', 'are', 'very', 'tender', 'moments', 'end', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy']",Wedding Palace

1677443,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00G7QQ00A,Paul Allaer,"[3, 4]","&#34;Wedding Palace&#34; (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Jason, a Korean-American living in California with his extended family, including parents and uncles and aunts who are all 1st generation immigrants from (South) Korea. As the movie opens, we get to know Jason and the background behind a family curse that goes all the way back to the 1700s in Korea. As it turns out, Jason simply MUST marry by age 30, or he'll die. When Jason is stood up by his bride-to-be Jinnie on their wedding day (in a scene strongly reminiscent of &#34;The Graduate&#34;), he must renew his search for a suitable bride, with an assist from his parents. Then one day Jason travels to Seoul on a work project, and he gets to know Na Young, a beautiful and funny co-worker. Separately we see how Jinnie realizes her mistake and she wants Jason back. At this point we are about 35 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one whacky and zany rom-com, and I mean that as a compliment. The pace of the movie, in particular the first 20 min. or so, is at breakneck pace where you barely get time to absorb what is going before the film shifts to the next scene. Second, the movie contains a number of observations on the Korean-American community that are obvious without ever being mean or rude. Check out the overbearing parents (I love the &#34;Pick Your Bride Show&#34; scene), but also the multiple references to karaoke, materialism, etc. I'm sure that there are many others that likely went over my head (I am not Korean-American). At one point, someone makes a comment about how all Korean-Americans are stuck in the 1970 and someone else responds: &#34;Of course, that's when they all left Korea!&#34;, ha!Kudos to writer-director Christine Yoo, in her full-length feature debut, as she brings us a thoroughly enjoyable rom-com and family comedy set in the Korean-American community.
