I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. The picture was clean and crisp. The sound needed to be turned up, but It was good quality. The footage from one million was very well placed into the film. If I had not seen one million so many times I would not have known it. For old timers I recomend this movie. You will enjoy it.",5,one million BC?,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,447,"['ordered', 'becouse', 'saw', 'teaser', 'U', 'Tube', 'thought', 'lot', 'old', 'one', 'million', 'bc', 'footage', 'was', 'used', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'picture', 'was', 'clean', 'crisp', 'sound', 'needed', 'be', 'turned', 'up', 'was', 'good', 'quality', 'footage', 'one', 'million', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'placed', 'film', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'million', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'known', 'old', 'timers', 'recomend', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy']",Valley of the Dragons
1396549,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004CZZZKY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Don't underestimate the simpler joys of a hokey film, especially if you're watching it with your sarcastic friends. Take 1961's Valley of the Dragons, a prehistoric sci-fi picture that posits this premise: In 1881, in northern Africa, just before the count of ten, two pistol-wielding duelists are swept away onto a passing comet on which surface roam primeval creatures... and gorgeous, scantily-clad cave girls. Can French Captain Hector Servadac (Cesare Danova) and Irish soldier-of-fortune Michael Denning (Sean McClory) belay their feud and work in concert for survival? Well, yeah.The opening credits hullabaloo not once but twice that the film bases itself on the Jules Verne story, ""Career of a Comet."" But Verne-heads should be aware that it's very loosely based. It's too bad Ray Harryhausen or George Pal didn't get their mitts on this film. As it is, what we get are fairly standard cave man/dinosaur thrills. In quick order, our two Earthmen are attacked by laughably googly-eyed sub-humans and witness two gigantic beasts tear at each other. One glance at that looming satellite and we're exposed to Servadac's crazy scientific theory. That heavenly body hovering over them turns out not to be the moon but, rather, the Earth. Servadac supposes that a thousand centuries ago their comet had glanced off our planet and ripped away a piece of the Earth and an envelope of its atmosphere. Very much pals at this stage and seemingly very calm about their situation, Servadac and Denning munch away on prehistoric partridge.Speaking of heavenly bodies, Joan Staley (most notably from The Ghost and Mr. Chicken) as ""Deena"" and Danielle De Metz as ""Nateeta"" make for fetching cave girls. We're in for mild tittilation during one underwater sequence as Joan Staley's near-revealing swimming escapade apparently had them boys at the theaters in 1961 howling and hooting. And if you're a fan of dusty old creature features, then maybe you'll recognize several stock footage lifted from One Million B.C. (1940) and, I think, Rodan (1956). That spider monster suspiciously looks like the same prop from Cat-Women of the Moon (1953).If nothing else Valley of the Dragons reaffirms modern man's superiority over squabbling tribes of spear-waving primitives. If you were ever temporally flung back to the Stone Age, then rest easy in the knowledge that your ability to manufacture gunpowder and to teach the local brutes our good English language will serve you in good stead. So, thanks, Valley of the Dragons. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",3,...crazy comet...,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2530,"['Do', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'simpler', 'joys', 'hokey', 'film', 'especially', ""'re"", 'watching', 'sarcastic', 'friends', 'Take', '1961', 'Valley', 'Dragons', 'prehistoric', 'sci-fi', 'picture', 'premise', '1881', 'northern', 'Africa', 'just', 'count', 'ten', 'two', 'pistol-wielding', 'duelists', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'passing', 'comet', 'surface', 'roam', 'primeval', 'creatures', 'gorgeous', 'scantily-clad', 'cave', 'girls', 'Can', 'French', 'Captain', 'Hector', 'Servadac', 'Cesare', 'Danova', 'Irish', 'soldier-of-fortune', 'Michael', 'Denning', 'Sean', 'McClory', 'belay', 'feud', 'work', 'concert', 'survival', 'Well', 'yeah.The', 'opening', 'credits', 'hullabaloo', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'film', 'Jules', 'Verne', 'story', 'Career', 'Comet', 'Verne-heads', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'too', 'bad', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'George', 'Pal', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'mitts', 'film', 'what', 'get', 'are', 'fairly', 'standard', 'cave', 'man/dinosaur', 'thrills', 'quick', 'order', 'two', 'Earthmen', 'are', 'attacked', 'laughably', 'googly-eyed', 'sub-humans', 'witness', 'two', 'gigantic', 'beasts', 'tear', 'other', 'One', 'glance', 'looming', 'satellite', ""'re"", 'exposed', 'Servadac', 'crazy', 'scientific', 'theory', 'heavenly', 'body', 'hovering', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'moon', 'rather', 'Earth', 'Servadac', 'thousand', 'centuries', 'comet', 'had', 'glanced', 'off', 'planet', 'ripped', 'away', 'piece', 'Earth', 'envelope', 'atmosphere', 'Very', 'much', 'pals', 'stage', 'seemingly', 'very', 'calm', 'situation', 'Servadac', 'Denning', 'munch', 'away', 'prehistoric', 'partridge.Speaking', 'heavenly', 'bodies', 'Joan', 'Staley', 'most', 'notably', 'Ghost', 'Mr.', 'Chicken', 'Deena', 'Danielle', 'De', 'Metz', 'Nateeta', 'make', 'fetching', 'cave', 'girls', ""'re"", 'mild', 'tittilation', 'one', 'underwater', 'sequence', 'Joan', 'Staley', 'near-revealing', 'swimming', 'escapade', 'apparently', 'had', 'boys', 'theaters', '1961', 'howling', 'hooting', ""'re"", 'fan', 'dusty', 'old', 'creature', 'features', 'then', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'several', 'stock', 'footage', 'lifted', 'One', 'Million', 'B.C', '1940', 'think', 'Rodan', '1956', 'spider', 'monster', 'suspiciously', 'same', 'prop', 'Cat-Women', 'Moon', '1953', '.If', 'nothing', 'else', 'Valley', 'Dragons', 'reaffirms', 'modern', 'man', 'superiority', 'squabbling', 'tribes', 'spear-waving', 'primitives', 'were', 'ever', 'temporally', 'flung', 'back', 'Stone', 'Age', 'then', 'rest', 'easy', 'knowledge', 'ability', 'manufacture', 'gunpowder', 'teach', 'local', 'brutes', 'good', 'English', 'language', 'will', 'serve', 'good', 'stead', 'So', 'thanks', 'Valley', 'Dragons', '2.5', '5', 'stars']",Valley of the Dragons

1396551,A16XRPF40679KG,B004CZZZKY,Michael Dobey,"[0, 1]","Even by the standards of sci fi in 1961 , this was a silly but fun shlocker. Shlock movies do not try to be silly , they are earnest and awkward.  This is a good spirited flick of that vein.  Two duelists are swept up to a comet , which then flies into outer space. the comet is full of giant lizards and mammoths, and a volcano , because as one of the men speculates , 'the earth had much more of them when the comet picked up parts of the earth last time it came close."" Well , now you see it.  It's pure sci fantasy from the pulps of 1900. Which by 1961 , is amazing it was being made in films. But then , ""first men in the moon' was made a few years later and it was like this and a 1800's type of story too! that one was actually a very good film, this is what it is,  But this is fun. Of course there are sexy women with shaved legs on the comet! And Rodan from the Japanese film series flies by. (they use  a lot of stock footage from other films in this one!""  It would be easy to just pick this apart. But it's of it's time and not so bad in a schlocky way! So the other two people are right , this is a three star flick for them. As it is entertaining and kids back then could identify with the two heroes. Especially boys!  The cave and river women are very hot indeed!.  And they take to our heroes with relish.  I am sure at least five other films footage is used in this one. That's how low budget it was. But the earnestness of the actors is very good. They knew that this was not sci fi but complete kid fantasy stuff. And they did their best. Cheers to them for that. But this is still shlock. It's really dumb in so many ways. But still fun. I can put aside all that has come since this flick and enjoy it. But most people unfortunately cannot.  But then , even the very good 'first men in the moon' would be easy to poke fun of by todays standards. But they didn't make these films for today, they made them for then and in this case , they cobbled together several films to come up with a plot.  It's  what it is. And  if you can enjoy that sort of thing , then this is for you. I did get a smile from this. But dare not give it a three star as it is shlock.",2,fun shlock flick!,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,2178,"['Even', 'standards', 'sci', 'fi', '1961', 'was', 'silly', 'fun', 'shlocker', 'Shlock', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'be', 'silly', 'are', 'earnest', 'awkward', 'good', 'spirited', 'flick', 'vein', 'Two', 'duelists', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'comet', 'then', 'outer', 'space', 'comet', 'full', 'giant', 'lizards', 'mammoths', 'volcano', 'one', 'men', 'speculates', 'earth', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'when', 'comet', 'picked', 'up', 'parts', 'earth', 'last', 'time', 'came', 'close', 'Well', 'now', 'see', 'pure', 'sci', 'fantasy', 'pulps', '1900', 'Which', '1961', 'amazing', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'films', 'then', 'first', 'men', 'moon', 'was', 'made', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'was', '1800', 'type', 'story', 'too', 'one', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'what', 'fun', 'course', 'are', 'sexy', 'women', 'shaved', 'legs', 'comet', 'Rodan', 'Japanese', 'film', 'series', 'flies', 'use', 'lot', 'stock', 'footage', 'other', 'films', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'just', 'pick', 'apart', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'schlocky', 'way', 'other', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'right', 'three', 'star', 'flick', 'entertaining', 'kids', 'back', 'then', 'could', 'identify', 'two', 'heroes', 'Especially', 'cave', 'river', 'women', 'are', 'very', 'hot', 'indeed', 'take', 'heroes', 'relish', 'am', 'sure', 'least', 'five', 'other', 'films', 'footage', 'used', 'one', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'was', 'earnestness', 'actors', 'very', 'good', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'sci', 'fi', 'complete', 'kid', 'fantasy', 'stuff', 'did', 'best', 'Cheers', 'still', 'shlock', 'really', 'dumb', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'still', 'fun', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'come', 'flick', 'enjoy', 'most', 'people', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'then', 'even', 'very', 'good', ""'first"", 'men', 'moon', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'poke', 'fun', 'todays', 'standards', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'films', 'today', 'made', 'then', 'case', 'cobbled', 'together', 'several', 'films', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'what', 'can', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'did', 'get', 'smile', 'not', 'give', 'three', 'star', 'shlock']",Valley of the Dragons
