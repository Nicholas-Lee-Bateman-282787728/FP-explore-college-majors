690778,A3OTA04EV3T5DB,B00005YUOO,Allison,"[0, 0]","I like the format of the Wiggles on this DVD. They still use the real backgrounds (not the CGI ones in later videos) and they have children singing and doing motions that get my kids attention. However, there is a reason not many of these songs have made it to multiple DVDs or a Best of DVD. This is definitely geared to a more &#34;down under&#34; crowd. The songs my 16 month olds like are: Wiggly Party and Caveland (interestingly, this is a computer made cartoon of Wiggles singing as cavemen). They will pop their head up from time to time to catch some of the other songs on here, but this DVD just doesn't seem to be as bright and catchy as some of the other ones are. We are collecting all the Wiggles DVDs that we can though so this was a definite must to purchase. I rated it with three starts because, again, my kids don't seem to be as interested in this one as some of the other DVDs the Wiggles have made.",3,Not quite as magical as some of the other Wiggles DVDs,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,920,"['like', 'format', 'Wiggles', 'DVD', 'still', 'use', 'real', 'backgrounds', 'not', 'CGI', 'ones', 'later', 'videos', 'have', 'children', 'singing', 'doing', 'motions', 'get', 'kids', 'attention', 'However', 'reason', 'not', 'many', 'songs', 'have', 'made', 'multiple', 'DVDs', 'Best', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'geared', 'more', '34', 'down', '34', 'crowd', 'songs', '16', 'month', 'olds', 'are', 'Wiggly', 'Party', 'Caveland', 'interestingly', 'computer', 'made', 'cartoon', 'Wiggles', 'singing', 'cavemen', 'will', 'pop', 'head', 'time', 'time', 'catch', 'other', 'songs', 'here', 'DVD', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'bright', 'catchy', 'other', 'ones', 'are', 'are', 'collecting', 'Wiggles', 'DVDs', 'can', 'though', 'so', 'was', 'definite', 'must', 'purchase', 'rated', 'three', 'starts', 'because', 'again', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'interested', 'one', 'other', 'DVDs', 'Wiggles', 'have', 'made']",N/A

This is such a darling video and you even get to see what the characters look like at the end - that's really nice.

It's fast-paced, the songs are catchy as can be, and it's wildly entertaining.  If you're not afraid to let your guard down, you'll find yourself dancing along with your kids throughout.And you'll be winded by the end of ""Wiggly Party"" and ""Hoop Dee Doo,"" the opening numbers.  Thankfully, there are slower numbers strategically placed along the way, such as ""Move Like an Emu"" and ""Marie's Wedding,"" giving both the big and little folks a chance to catch their breath.  But before you know it, you're back to a ""Fun on the Farm"" a ""Wobbly Dance,"" or a ""Wiggle Hula,"" and the frantic pace is on again.This tape gets constant play in my house, and neither I nor my daughter seem to tire of it.  My hands may get a bit sore from the ""clap-clap-clap-clap"" during ""Hoop Dee Doo,"" and my arms and legs a bit tired from dragging my daughter around during my sad attempts at the polka, but that's well worth the price of admission.This is a quality production throughout, even if the computer-animated ""Caveland"" seems a bit out of place.  The kids won't know the difference--they'll love it all.  And unless you're anti-Wiggles, you will, too.

Like any party.You party pooper reviewers out there, not every single thing you watch is all that educational for you! so why should everything your children watch be? If you really think about it there is a sense of education here. My son has learned to appreciate polka, rock, dance/pop music, and folk songs. This video helps them to appreciate music and also they learn that dancing is fun. Plus, younger children, like my son, don't really watch it that much and see those annoying patterns that many reviewers mentioned.I am glad that two of these wiggly men are attractive, at least, much more attractive than Steve, of ""blues' clues"", which I have to watch every day as well.  Anthony & Greg totally rock!!!! And I think they all look like they are having a really good time.Isn't that what all parties are supposed to be about?If you are really concerned with visual patterns, this maybe a bad choice of video. Otherwise I recommend it for children between the ages of 1 1/2(like my son) and 7.  Most of the children in the video are between these ages, and they all look like they are having a good time.This is a FUN video..It's pure entertainment....and we all like to be entertained from time to time..Eileen Famiglietti",4,It's a wiggly party!

We have many of these videos in our library, and the more you watch them, the more they take on a life of their own.  Take for example - the song ""Hoop De Doo.""  Now that I'm getting used to the music, I'm beginning to dance it, too, and I'm almost there, too.Then we have Captain Feathersword, and is animated and lively song, ""The Captain's Magic Buttons.""  This particular piece highlights the Captain (Paul Paddick) and his extraordinary talent to improvise on the spot.  We enjoy him immensely.  Then there are all the dancers, kids, and Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and as we get closer to the end, we ""Walk Like an Emu,"" and finally the Wiggle Polka - ""Wiggle your Fingers, and Wiggle your Thumbs,"" which almost sounds like an Elvis song, or a throwback to the 50's kind of music.The credits are alot of fun, too, because you get to see the entire crew and background workers, while the music plays, and the major characters out of costume.A Great Video.

690785,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,B00005YUOO,Heather Walton,"[7, 10]","The Hallorans are gone! They were the excellent dancers from the other tapes. Their Choreographer was Leanne Halloran, who played Officer Beaples, who is also gone. The contract The Wiggles had with the Donna Halloran School of Dance is over for good. The songs are wonderful, but the dancing is non-existent with the new Choreographer (who was Dorothy The Dinosaur) Leanne Ashley. Although she herself is an excellent dancer, as a Choreographer, she does not deliver and the pizzazz the Wiggles once had is gone. Still my 26-month-old loves this video a lot.My other complaint is all the songs, with the exception of Caveland, are performed on the same background stage. I liked the other videos where they go to the beach and to other locations for their songs. The songs are as good as they get and my child adores this tape, so that's all that matters I guess. I only wish Leanne Halloran and her daughters would come back! It was great seeing them all grow-up from Dance Party through to Wiggly Wiggly World. Now they are gone forever and it makes me sad, even though my daughter does not notice, it is obvious without the Hallorans, The Wiggles are lacking much of their magic.These songs are wonderful and follow the CD exactly except the Beach song is missing. I have all their CD's too and this one is the best along with Yummy Yummy. This is the only video that follows the CD closely. If you do not mind The Wiggles and the children dancers sitting around and occasionally waving their arms and wiggles their hips, instead of dancing, then this is a wonderful tape to own. The did skip something in thier artwork for this one though. Seeing that same stage on every song gets dull fast.
