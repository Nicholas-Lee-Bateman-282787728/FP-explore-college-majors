I was not sure what to expect but it was actually pretty funny. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys good standup comedy. Be warned, she curses and talks about the things that people go through in life from being a child through their adult hood. If you are looking at comedy videos trying to decide what you should get, I would suggest you pick up Sommore for a real good laugh. Set the mood....Tell the kids to go into the other room, pour you some Hennessy, burn you some incense and get ready to laugh!

I make it a point to check out her show whenever she comes to my area.  She's had funnier rooutines but this DVD has its moments.
