It felt very much like a slowed down music video with similar dumbed down plot lines. There is a dance scene which is ridiculous in the extreme. No one in 19th century Russia, in fact no one in the world today does such insane gyrations in the name of dance. And I'm sorry to say that the numerous sex scenes were unable to raise this ill conceived monstrosity from a laughable waste of two plus hours. I must say that I was intrigued by the device of using a stage proscenium setting to set up the scenes. This was quite nicely done. To have utterly sacrificed the brilliant original story to a very lame so called love story is quite unforgivable. Sample revisions: Anna does not throw herself into an oncoming train and her lover in fact dumps her to forgo a scandal which would ruin his professional life. Conquest complete, self interest prevails. Did the screenwriter even bother to read the original? This modern reworking of a great classic is dull, overwrought, and ridiculous in the extreme.

It opened up a lot of the heart of the story by either brutally confining the characters to the bondage of the stage of society or quite literally opening up the back door to let certain people escape to their own freedoms, however brief they may be. Metaphors aside, watching the filming and orchestration of this style of storytelling was absolutely a dazzling treat! Although I did find Anna a rather unlikable character, I most certainly understood her. So to that end, I managed to escape disliking the movie. Her motives were wild and impetuous; she rarely acted like anything other than a spoiled child. Yet I think that may have been a point of the plot, to let the audience see how love, passion, and greed for both of these emotions spoils people like fruit left out too long. I must point out the brilliance of casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky! The entire first hour of the movie completely captivated me as I watched the delicate dance between Keira Knightley and himself. I almost felt as if I was being overwhelmingly wooed by the man. Olivia Williams, who portrayed Vronsky's domineering mother, was also delightful! She is one of those British actresses who is absolutely sumptuous to watch on-screen.

This is one of the most beloved love stories of all time, so I can see off the get-go why some people were disappointed.  The vehicle goes in a different direction, but you get to where you are going.  The story has not changed, the spine of the story is there.  Please keep in mind that this is a British film, the Brits don't explain each little nuance, you have to use a process of deduction.  Don't want to go through all the trouble?  This isn't the film for you, but it is beautifully presented.I watched this movie almost all in fast forward late one night.  I didn't think it was great, and I thought the concept was strange, with the theater stage and all.  Then, a few days later I decided to watch it again. The second time I really enjoyed it, I love this story, who doesn't?? Humans are flawed. agree or disagree with Anna, you will go back and forth.  This was a creative take, but it is worth watching for the acting, costumes, scenery and unique view of the novel.  I think Kiera Knightly was a little young to play Anna, but she is an excellent actress, with a great emotional range, and I am not sure who else could have pulled it off, not many other young actresses are of her caliber, able to play such diverse roles.  Jude Law was FLAWLESS as a stern Karenin, you will actually feel sorry for him, and Aaron Johnson had a good slant on Vronsky, pompous at first, but then bemused with Anna, and how his whole look changed from the beginning to the end, from drop dead gorgeous and confident, to worried and tense at the end, and you saw how the affair aged him prematurely.  The other stories tied in nicely, with some good actors that you haven't seen everywhere (thankfully), and the dancing scenes were beautifully choreographed, with the flavor of the Russian ballet woven in.  Yes, the story is imaginative, you will see, but that is what gives you the hook, you are never sure what is coming.  You need to use your brain with this movie, that is what I liked.  It is not always spelled out for you.I felt for these actors after I watched it, as it had to be a challenging movie to make and live up to, realizing that everyone was going to tear it apart, I would imagine expectations were so high, NOTHING would ever be good enough for critics and die hard fans of the story, but kudos to them for re-making this movie AGAIN!  As a historical fan, I appreciate a movie like this, it wasn't 100% accurate, but they put a lot of effort into this movie.  I only give it 4 stars because I wanted to see more Russian elements woven in, including the dress of the period.

1543095,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008220C38,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Count me in the Joe Wright fan club.  I've been a pretty diehard fan of his since seeing `Pride and Prejudice' and his knack for elaborate showmanship continues to elate me.  He's like a more refined Baz Luhrmann and I love him for that.  After failing to ignite audiences with `The Soloist' (the only Wright film I haven't seen) and then trying his hand at the popular `teen kills adults' genre, Wright came back home to his roots with `Anna Karenina'.  This also reteamed him with his muse, Keira Knightley, giving them both something intriguing to sink their claws into.`Anna Karenina' was a project met with immediate skepticism.  Tolstoy is not an easy author to adapt, and when taking on such a big and beloved literary piece the critics are already sharpening their knives to dig in and destroy.  For those who love the original text, I can see where the complaints carry merit.  I have not read Tolstoy's gargantuan novel, but I hear that the romantic subplot and Karenina's eventual demise is not the supreme focus of the book and so the constant focus on her romantic plight is a sore spot for those devoted to Tolstoy's classic.For those of us who have not read the book and are basing their opinions on the craftsmanship of the film itself; this is VERY rewarding.Yes, `Anna Karenina' is a sweeping epic that has so much character and style one cannot simply dismiss it.  In the hands of visionary Wright, we are taking on a very visceral journey that stays with the viewer long after the credits have finished rolling.  The story takes place in 19th century Russia where aristocrat Anna, married to the older Karenin, suffers greatly after entering into an affair with the dashing Count Vronsky.  Vronsky is the eye of young Kitty's heart, but he is smitten with the illusive Anna and makes it a point to seek out her affections.  In the meantime, Anna is trying to help mend the marriage of her adulterous brother and his wife, Dolly.  When word of their affair gets out, shame is placed all over Anna and Karenin, and decisions must be made with regard to the repercussions circulating Anna's poor choices.The story is beautifully woven, with all ends brought into light at the right moments.  The uniform performances by the entire cast are essential to this story feeling lush, and Knightley, Law, Macdonald, Vikander and especially Macfayden were up to the task at hand.  This was really Wright's movie though, and the way he layers each visual is astonishing to witness.

This film excited me though because of its lush visuals, acting talent and the hope that I may develop an interest in Russian literature.First, I would like to say that this film is gorgeous. The colors are rich, the sets lavish, the costumes are stunning. The director has created a world based on a period in time but imbued it with a dreamlike quality. Scene changes have a theatrical quality to them and the director has purposefully used model trains and sets for certain scenes to give the setting a surreal quality. There are moments when music and actions are combined as if a musical number. These are visual treats but combined with the lesser aspects they weigh down and undermine the film.The bad parts of this film are so weighty that that ruin what could have been a fantastic experience. The acting is truly all over the place. The majority of the performances are so over the top they are almost parody. During the first 20 minutes I was confused wondering if this was meant to be a comedic work as the over exaggerated gestures and delivery of lines was more like a Mel Brooks' comedy.  The dramatic parts were even worse as the music become melodramatic, extreme close ups on characters highlight stunning revelations like a scene from the original Dark Shadows TV series and characters threw themselves into fits of despair or sob in seconds. A ballroom scene I recall where Kiera Knightly dances with  Alexei is made very awkward by the director having all other dancers stand in place while the star couple dance around a decadent and stunning hall. The effect is lost in such strange visual.The script itself is a confusing and rushed mess. Characters come and go, dialogue is badly delivered and then the next sumptuous scene with bad acting starts. As stated I have no previous knowledge of Anna Karenina prior to viewing this film and I dare say I still don't after watching.

In many ways, this adaptation is a visual masterpiece and brilliant artistic achievement. It gambles mightily in its metaphors by limiting most of the indoor scenes into an old theater, thus reminding us that all men (and women) are simply ""players on a stage."" When I first heard of this approach I thought it would be a disaster and severely limit the scope; instead, it is an intriguing twist that constantly surprises and engages its audience. The costuming is scrumptious and the acting is phenomenal, particularly from its leading lady. Unexpectedly, aspects of it are also fraught with humor, which brings much-needed levity into the seriousness of the subject matter. The score is sometimes demure and at other times perfectly suits the mood.Where its faults lie are in its utter absence of the religious themes of the book. Though we do get to see the forgiveness of Karenin (and indeed, his are some of the best scenes) and how her own self-doubt and hatred eat away at Anna, the roles of Levin and Kitty are so reduced that it leaves us wondering why they are involved in the first place. The book's purpose is to show us wild, passionate, sexual desire in an extra-marital love affair, that turns itself inside out and descends into jealousy and contempt, contrasting it with a pure and innocent love that begins with an act of total forgiveness. But... that isn't in this version, and as a result, Levin's transformation is also absent. What we are left with is an incomplete story that does hit some of the highlights of the moral messages of the book but not the most important ones.Much of the adaptation is masterful but I did miss some of the more impacting moments in the story -- like the contrast between the birth of Anna's child and Kitty's. However empty as it may be, it does invoke in a viewer a sense of deep compassion toward this broken, sinful woman in desperate need of loving kindness. Our desire is to see her changed for the better, saved from her descent into despair, yet there is nothing we can do and in the end, that is what makes this story so impacting. I've seen many versions of this story and Keira's depiction of Anna is one of the best. It helps that she is surrounded by such talent, most of them fairly well-known among the BBC crowd. It isn't a perfect adaptation, but it's well worth a watch.Parental Concerns: three brief sex scenes (clothed), partial nudity, and a gruesome body after an accident on the tracks.",4,"Almost magnificent, with one flaw",1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2628,"['Tolstoy', 'novel', 'multi-faceted', 'work', 'tragedy', 'comparisons', 'lust', 'love', 'more', 'how', 'forgiveness', 'faith', 'transform', 'lives', 'many', 'ways', 'adaptation', 'visual', 'masterpiece', 'brilliant', 'artistic', 'achievement', 'mightily', 'metaphors', 'limiting', 'most', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'old', 'theater', 'thus', 'reminding', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'simply', 'players', 'stage', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'approach', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'disaster', 'severely', 'limit', 'scope', 'instead', 'intriguing', 'twist', 'constantly', 'audience', 'costuming', 'scrumptious', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'particularly', 'leading', 'lady', 'Unexpectedly', 'aspects', 'are', 'also', 'fraught', 'humor', 'much-needed', 'levity', 'seriousness', 'subject', 'matter', 'score', 'sometimes', 'demure', 'other', 'times', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'mood.Where', 'faults', 'lie', 'are', 'utter', 'absence', 'religious', 'themes', 'book', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'forgiveness', 'Karenin', 'indeed', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', 'how', 'own', 'self-doubt', 'hatred', 'eat', 'away', 'Anna', 'roles', 'Levin', 'Kitty', 'are', 'so', 'reduced', 'wondering', 'why', 'are', 'involved', 'first', 'place', 'book', 'purpose', 'show', 'wild', 'passionate', 'sexual', 'desire', 'extra-marital', 'love', 'affair', 'jealousy', 'contempt', 'contrasting', 'pure', 'innocent', 'love', 'act', 'total', 'forgiveness', ""n't"", 'version', 'result', 'Levin', 'transformation', 'also', 'absent', 'What', 'are', 'left', 'incomplete', 'story', 'hit', 'highlights', 'moral', 'messages', 'book', 'not', 'most', 'important', 'ones.Much', 'adaptation', 'masterful', 'did', 'miss', 'more', 'impacting', 'moments', 'story', 'contrast', 'birth', 'Anna', 'child', 'Kitty', 'However', 'empty', 'may', 'be', 'invoke', 'viewer', 'sense', 'deep', 'compassion', 'broken', 'sinful', 'woman', 'desperate', 'need', 'loving', 'kindness', 'desire', 'see', 'changed', 'better', 'saved', 'descent', 'despair', 'yet', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'end', 'what', 'story', 'so', 'impacting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'versions', 'story', 'Keira', 'depiction', 'Anna', 'one', 'best', 'surrounded', 'such', 'talent', 'most', 'fairly', 'well-known', 'BBC', 'crowd', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'adaptation', 'well', 'watch.Parental', 'Concerns', 'three', 'brief', 'sex', 'scenes', 'clothed', 'partial', 'nudity', 'gruesome', 'body', 'accident', 'tracks']",N/A

1543134,A1E4IWKDCT08WP,B008220C38,"Crystal Nelson ""Little Impaler""","[3, 3]","So I just watched the movie Anna Karenina, starring Keria Knightly and I got to say this movie was over dramatize, stylist, artistic piece of poop! I have seen some pretty bad movies of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, but this was the worst! Most of the cast was English! The English are not very good at playing people from other countries or culture and this turned a very Russian story to very English one. Only the Russian people who were the extras in the background spoke Russian.None of the actors went through culture training, because it made the story flat and strange. I would prefer this movie be played by Russian actors. Actor's mannerism just made it strange. None of the actors had Russian accents, so like any other movie played in Europe, European people speak with English accent.Another thing, this movie was totally confusing and not clear, and one of the reasons why the movie was confusing beyond confusing, was it was too artistic, don't know why the director wanted to make this film artistic and beautiful, but it did no good for the story. Another thing that cause the movie to be confusing was:First when you begin to watch this movie, you think ""oh going to be theatrical"" Then it shifts into Belle. There are many scenes that set on the stage, but then it moves off stage goes into more film-like structure. For example: Anna's lover enters a horse race, the horse race is on stage and the on-lookers are the audience and as the race begins the horse falls off stage. Which did NOTHING for the movie! It was like going to play and the actors on stage can't make up their minds if they speaking to you or their scene partner. There was a lot of back and forth.Relationships in the story were not developed. You did not know that Anna fell in love with this other man, until the character told you they were in love. Or Kitty fall in love with Anna's lover. So you are sitting there wondering ""Oh, you two love each other?"" And the love scene did nothing for the story, it was more of up close dance of moving your hands this way and that way with Anna moaning over again ""Murdering"". If you want to turn on your lover, I guess saying murdering gets them pretty hot and heavy. Then there was this one scene where I thought it was going to turn into up close porno. No, seriously! Anna is outside with her lover and she straddles him and the camera moves closely on some French kissing. All these dumb things did not help the movie!Acting was ok, I was sorely disappointed in Knightly's performance, because she did so good in A Dangerous Method, but her acting was ok. And there were scenes where I just wanted to feed her a burger, because in some, she looked like she was going to snap or break and there's nothing appealing seeing someone's bones on their back and in one scene she looked like she had 16 inch waist. She could have done better in her dance scene, she seem not smooth and not graceful, when the people in the background move better than you and they are not the lead there is a problem.Now, Jude Law did a great job in the movie, he connected and even though he had an English accent he acted more Russian than a lot of the other actors, because he understood what he was talking about and connected. And his parts made more sense than other thing that was going on this film.Anna's lover in this movie annoyed the hell out of me, he was over the top flamboyant in his movements, everything he did  had a feminine flare, he looked like woman with a mustache. Everything he did from lighting a cigarette had to look beautiful and every time he took off his coat he had to spin around before taking it off. I just wanted to slap him.Every day people do not act like this, certainly not Russians back in Imperial Russia! It made the movie hard to understand!And I really hate to say this too, knowing my Russian history, all the rich people were so elegant looking and there clothes look like it cost an arm and leg and I couldn't help wondering how many Russians were staving outside in the fidget cold, so the rich people can look all pretty with their stupid parties. And some of the costumes did not fit with the time.Anna really annoy me in this film, wonder if she really like this in the book. She falls in love with another man, her husband finds out, tells her she can't do what she doing, she doesn't stop, when her husband shuns her and she has her lover's baby, I guess she dying in bed and she begs for her husband's forgiveness. Her husband finally forgives her, then in second she is cruel to him. You would think once she had her lover and in the middle of getting divorce she would be happy? NOOOOOOOO! She wants to go out and see a play, and her lover is concern how people will think and say, she tells him ""I don't care. Well, it bites her in the ass and the people ostracize her and she feels horrible. Later she burst into tears and says to her lover ""If you really did love me, you wouldn't let me go!"" This woman has issues with a capital I. One moment she is happy and in the next totally sad and upset She kills herself at the end by throwing her self on the tracks of an upcoming train. Best thing in the film! If you are so miserable with yourself, you should do the whole world a favor just throw yourself off a cliff! When she throws herself onto the tracks she says ""forgive me!"" This woman cause her own misery.Only thing the movie got right, is showing how many rich Russians live a screw up lives and how many did with Tolstov did and live out in the country to have a more simple life.This movie would have been a lot better, if the actors went through culture training, if the movie was just simple. But this movie sucks. When doing Tolstoy do not think you can do a better story than him.

In the Leigh version, you see clearly how bored they both are after they run away to Italy and are completely severed from their life in Russia - Vronsky wilts without the military friendships that he lives and breathes; and Anna becomes desperate when, without her high-class family and society friends, Vronsky becomes her ONLY lifeline. Her desperation makes her manic, and though he truly loves her, her constant anger and jealousy in the face of his constant efforts to keep their relationship together, can only eventually make him want to escape. The clear deterioration of their relationship due to the pressures that were in it from the beginning is not so clear in this version.Anna's suicide seems very sudden and senseless. There is no searching of self or mourning for lost honour as in the Leigh version, where Leigh's Anna is revealed to herself to have been selfish and dishonorable... loving no one, not even her son, as much as herself.I disagree with other viewers who thought Vronsky was mis-cast. I thought he was excellent, though it was difficult to see how the affair kept momentum as long as it did, and the movie leaves his fate after Anna's suicide a blank. However, the movie starts off in such a choreographed, artificial manner that it is almost burlesque, with a synchronized army of paper-stampers weaving in and out of rouged accordion players... and it switches between a natural style and a burlesque style without any discernible reason. Also the theme of the train, which possibly represents fate either carrying us to a happy ending if we search for something other than gratification or running us down if we don't, is very strong in the beginning, but really lost by the time Anna's suicide at the end.Connecting with the characters was difficult. I could not respect Anna, who thought about no one's pain but her own throughout the movie. I really felt for Karenin, who's warning to Anna was so verbally emotionless and accurate although he was clearly feeling great emotion at every step of Anna's betrayal. He wasn't a perfect husband (and again, other versions show him neglecting his family in favor of his career) but Anna's subsequent obvious contempt and hatred was so unjustified and painful to watch.I think it is worth seeing, but seeing other versions too will give you the rest of the story that this one left out.",3,Beautiful but missed a lot of plot,1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2013,2853,"['think', 'version', 'Amazon', 'streaming', 'missing', 'several', 'important', 'scenes', 'saw', 'earlier', 'trailers', 'just', 'same', 'even', 'have', 'feeling', 'movie', 'really', 'important', 'ways', 'deliver', 'plot', 'made', 'novel', 'classic.At', 'least', 'one', 'older', 'movie', 'one', 'Vivien', 'Leigh', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'Anna', 'Vronsky', 'affair', 'was', 'doomed', 'start', 'one', 'can', 'keep', 'affair', 'things', 'make', 'life', 'satisfying', 'Leigh', 'version', 'see', 'clearly', 'how', 'bored', 'are', 'run', 'away', 'Italy', 'are', 'completely', 'severed', 'life', 'Russia', 'Vronsky', 'wilts', 'military', 'friendships', 'breathes', 'Anna', 'becomes', 'desperate', 'when', 'high-class', 'family', 'society', 'friends', 'Vronsky', 'ONLY', 'lifeline', 'desperation', 'manic', 'truly', 'constant', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'face', 'constant', 'efforts', 'keep', 'relationship', 'together', 'can', 'only', 'eventually', 'make', 'want', 'escape', 'clear', 'deterioration', 'relationship', 'due', 'pressures', 'were', 'beginning', 'not', 'so', 'clear', 'version.Anna', 'suicide', 'very', 'sudden', 'senseless', 'searching', 'self', 'mourning', 'lost', 'honour', 'Leigh', 'version', 'where', 'Leigh', 'Anna', 'revealed', 'herself', 'have', 'been', 'selfish', 'dishonorable', 'loving', 'one', 'not', 'even', 'son', 'as', 'much', 'herself.I', 'disagree', 'other', 'viewers', 'who', 'thought', 'Vronsky', 'was', 'mis-cast', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'affair', 'kept', 'momentum', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'movie', 'fate', 'Anna', 'suicide', 'blank', 'However', 'movie', 'off', 'such', 'choreographed', 'artificial', 'manner', 'almost', 'burlesque', 'synchronized', 'army', 'paper-stampers', 'weaving', 'rouged', 'accordion', 'players', 'natural', 'style', 'burlesque', 'style', 'discernible', 'reason', 'Also', 'theme', 'train', 'possibly', 'fate', 'carrying', 'happy', 'ending', 'search', 'something', 'other', 'gratification', 'running', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'very', 'strong', 'beginning', 'really', 'lost', 'time', 'Anna', 'suicide', 'end.Connecting', 'characters', 'was', 'difficult', 'could', 'not', 'respect', 'Anna', 'who', 'thought', 'one', 'pain', 'own', 'movie', 'really', 'felt', 'Karenin', 'who', 'warning', 'Anna', 'was', 'so', 'verbally', 'emotionless', 'accurate', 'was', 'clearly', 'feeling', 'great', 'emotion', 'step', 'Anna', 'betrayal', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'husband', 'again', 'other', 'versions', 'show', 'neglecting', 'family', 'favor', 'career', 'Anna', 'subsequent', 'obvious', 'contempt', 'hatred', 'was', 'so', 'unjustified', 'painful', 'watch.I', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing', 'seeing', 'other', 'versions', 'too', 'will', 'give', 'rest', 'story', 'one', 'left', 'out']",N/A

1543153,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B008220C38,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","The ingredients for this fourth adaptation of Tolstoy's classic look promising on paper: Joe Wright and Keira Knightley reunite after their success with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005), with a screenplay written by Tom Stoppard.  The conception behind the film is a suggestive one: the entire action is located in a giant theater, with the protagonists conceived as performers putting on roles for the audience's benefit.  This should have provided a framework for an analysis of Anna's (Knightley's) motivations, as she abandons her husband (Jude Law) in favor of her lover (Aaron Taylor-Johnston), even though by doing so she condemns herself to a lifetime of social ostracism.  It's perhaps more important for her to follow her inclinations rather than conform to pre-determined social roles.  Unfortunately the finished product turns out a disappointment: director Wright seems to have little idea how to develop the screenplay, other than to indulge in a series of consciously 'artificial' shots - for example, zooming into the characters' faces, or using a deliberately jagged narrative style - that render the action difficult to follow.  In the central role Knightley seems miscast; she lacks both poise and grace - essential to portraying a Russian aristocrat - and she tends to gabble her lines.  ITaylor-Johnston's Vronsky is easily the worst I have seen in any of the four versions of the tale - surpassing Kieron Moore in Korda's woebegone 1948 adaptation.  Not only does he lack any sense of nobility, but he does not seem to know what to do with the part: we are left wondering precisely why Anna should have wanted to fall in love with him.  Jude Law's Karenin is perhaps the only reason for watching this film; a quiet, yet menacing personality who seldom loses his cool, yet remaining determined to control his wife (and hence maintain a facade of social respectability) at any costs.  Trapped within this kind of marriage, we can understand precisely why Anna should want to take her own life.  The film's group sequences are competently handled, although the choreography could have been improved.  What this ANNA KARENINA shows is that even attaching the biggest names in theater to a project cannot guarantee its overall quality.",2,Elegant and Boring Misfire,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,2246,"['ingredients', 'fourth', 'adaptation', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'look', 'promising', 'paper', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'reunite', 'success', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', '2005', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'conception', 'film', 'suggestive', 'one', 'entire', 'action', 'located', 'giant', 'theater', 'protagonists', 'conceived', 'performers', 'putting', 'roles', 'audience', 'benefit', 'should', 'have', 'provided', 'framework', 'analysis', 'Anna', 'Knightley', 'motivations', 'husband', 'Jude', 'Law', 'favor', 'lover', 'Aaron', 'Taylor-Johnston', 'even', 'doing', 'so', 'lifetime', 'social', 'ostracism', 'perhaps', 'more', 'important', 'follow', 'inclinations', 'rather', 'conform', 'pre-determined', 'social', 'roles', 'Unfortunately', 'finished', 'product', 'out', 'disappointment', 'director', 'Wright', 'have', 'little', 'idea', 'how', 'develop', 'screenplay', 'other', 'indulge', 'series', 'consciously', ""'artificial"", 'shots', 'example', 'zooming', 'characters', 'using', 'deliberately', 'jagged', 'narrative', 'style', 'render', 'action', 'difficult', 'follow', 'central', 'role', 'Knightley', 'miscast', 'poise', 'grace', 'essential', 'portraying', 'Russian', 'aristocrat', 'gabble', 'lines', 'ITaylor-Johnston', 'Vronsky', 'easily', 'worst', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'versions', 'tale', 'surpassing', 'Kieron', 'Moore', 'Korda', 'woebegone', '1948', 'adaptation', 'Not', 'only', 'lack', 'sense', 'nobility', 'not', 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'part', 'are', 'left', 'wondering', 'precisely', 'why', 'Anna', 'should', 'have', 'wanted', 'fall', 'love', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Karenin', 'perhaps', 'only', 'reason', 'watching', 'film', 'quiet', 'yet', 'menacing', 'personality', 'who', 'cool', 'yet', 'remaining', 'determined', 'control', 'wife', 'hence', 'maintain', 'facade', 'social', 'respectability', 'costs', 'Trapped', 'kind', 'marriage', 'can', 'understand', 'precisely', 'why', 'Anna', 'should', 'want', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'film', 'group', 'sequences', 'are', 'competently', 'handled', 'choreography', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'What', 'ANNA', 'KARENINA', 'even', 'attaching', 'biggest', 'names', 'theater', 'project', 'can', 'not', 'guarantee', 'overall', 'quality']",N/A

I just have to commend Joe Wright for going out on a limb and trying something different. He's worked with Keira Knightley before with great results, so I was looking forward to this movie, but what I got was truly unexpected!Almost the whole movie is set within a theatre, and if you're wondering how that's possible - well - that's the fun of watching it. I was just blown away again and again by the adventurous staging and shooting that took place on the screen. Some may think that it's showy and distracting and CERTAINLY not like the book. To which I say - who cares?! It's just such a blast to watch.This is a true MOVIE, that could only exist as a movie. It's not a book put on the screen. Deal with it, people.The only drawback I found was that it was unclear to me [SMALL SPOILER ALERT!] by the end of the movie whether Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character was being truly unfaithful, or if it was just in Anna's mind, and why he started as a philanderer and apparently ended up as totally devoted to her and then perhaps regressed to being a philanderer again. Perhaps once I watch the Blu-ray (which I am about to order) I'll have a better idea what the director's intention was. I have not read the book, where things are possibly more clear.So one star off for not quite pulling off a masterwork, but it's certainly up there with ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice.""",4,Masterpiece?

The film is visually interesting. The sets are beautiful and the costumes are lovely. Keira Knightley is not exactly as Tolstoy described her but she is none the less very good. Knightley is one of my favorite actresses working today and as Anna she is heart breaking and she luminous. She is not a afraid to make Anna a flawed woman, which she is very much so. Anna can be very unlikeable she is not a saint and we sometimes don't take her side but I think Keira realized that Anna was a complex character she is not a hero but not a villain. Jude law as Anna's Husband is great. His character is not a monster at all. He is a man who is very moral and fights for what he thinks is morally  correct. He loves Anna and it's obvious he values his role as a husband and father. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is not as bad as many people say as he is in his role. He is not great but he is not so bad.

It was enjoyable watching the director further develop techniques he'd used years earlier in Pride & Prejudice and I absolutely loved the stage framing and model work. Sadly, with two exceptions, casting was a big detraction from the film (most particularly unconvincing is a young and wavering Aaron Johnson). Although few could ever seem as perfect for the titular character as Vivien Leigh, Knightley acquits herself well, only occasionally feeling overwhelmed in the role. Domhnall Gleeson's Levin is probably the strongest casting choice, but here the filmmakers seem at a loss over Levin's earnest melancholy, and turn the character into someone at times awkwardly cartoonish.

1543163,A3EHIGO4FNILXP,B008220C38,.fgd,"[2, 3]","The characters and elocution are decidedly upper-class-Edwardian. While relationships are supposed to be building between characters, the film keeps looping into fast forward, so that the dialogue becomes voice prompts , merely telling the audience what happened and what to expect next.A prime example of is the ballroom scene when Vronsky and Anna cannot help but be attracted  and fall head-long for each other. The camera is held at a distance during a stylised dance. I cannot remember any close-ups of the chemistry developing between them. Eye-contact , during what should be a charged seduction was an essential that never happened.As a man capable of awakening desire in a conservative woman, Vromsky needed some tangible sex-appeal, in an affair driven by sexual passion. Joe Wright's Vronsky does not get beyond The Bold Stare and  becomes softer and younger looking under later pressure. The sex scene is so chopped about and edited i could not make out which part of the body or whose. Passion was fulfilled evidently when Kiera Knightly arches triumphantly ontop and sucks air through her teeth. Or gazes from the pillow with a ""That was IT"" look,  that looks over-acted.Joe Wight seems to avoid serious content , requiring mature director skills. He may have been The Studios' golden boy,  awarded with youngest director, but he has failed to attract any of The Names to work with him ( outside of Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx in The Soloist and Vanessa Redgrave at the end of Atonement) His male leads are either youngish men or middle-class types. It's like he can't deal with real men or actors of calibre. Patrick Stewart, for example, not likely.....He couldn't get the funding he had in mind whilst working with Tom Stoppard on the screenplay. He has been endosed by the studios and he's not an independant working on a shoe-string,  I wonder if no Names is the reason. However, he did come up with an original, bold solution to set the world of the Russian rich in a theatre as a metaphor for their staged and stuffy etiquette ; stifling at times.It screams budget cuts if the theatre is dilapidated; MORE so because the dilapidation is not consistant. Did the production run out of paint? In some scens the walls are painted. In other scenes, the mouldy looking walls and crumbling cornices etc....are not.. For example, the ballroom or using the auditorium for their opera nights out. It is ok if set in an old theatre but in order for the world of the rich to feel staged, there needed to be paint and guilding on-stage. Dilapidation as a metaphor for decadence did not work especially when a day at the horse races and the ice rink are clearly time spent out-doors away from their stuffy drawing rooms. It's a real distraction when those out-door scenes are inside. At one point there were several real horses cantering across the boards,backstage and I couldn't get pooper-scoopers off my mind.Levin's scenes were set out-side in the country, on his farm as  a metaphor for healthy living and thinking. ( A gaurd rail could have suggested a racing track easily enough ) The switch  is a pleasing and refreshing contrast of worlds.Kitty and Levin are well cast and played as subplot and ultimatly model courtship.Bizzarely, a few times, a cheap toy steam train wobbily careened towards the viewer or across the screen, surrounded by icing. It seemed childish as Anna's son had no intrinsic part in the film.What is also onstage is Joe Wright's love of the trade-mark. It is the third time using Kiera Knightly the leading actress. It's the same posh bird and  limted acting skills as her appearence in Atonement and Pride and Predjuidice. It's shameless dis-regard for castings since a director allways try to cast the best actor/actress for each film. What on earth can he be thinking? Trade-mark and style over substance over-ride any quality to what he does. There is also a tribute in this film to his Indian wife when Levin's mistress croons sutras over his sick-bed. Hard to figue where the Sub-Continent fits into Imperial Rusia.There could have been better distinction in the casting, especially since this is a stagey production. Oblonsky and Anna's husband seem to come out of the same mould except one had a pate. In Tolstoy,  Oblonsky is as cheerily bourgiouse as a hobbit and the husband has a parsimonious air. Dolly seems like Kitty 15 yrs older although she is supposed to be inbred. Th countess did not act like the queen of her salon. It was a missed opportunity to be more camp because it IS a theatrical setting. Why be limted to film types? It would have added colour.I almost feel Joe Wright is itching to do a musical where pesky things like dramatic integrity and maturity can be disgarded. He loves style and patterns ;clerks stamping documents in unison, flowing fingertips outside dance scenes and synchronised choreography .What he is,  is a good camera-man, who would be an asset to a true director.It often looks as if he has put his camera-work, literally, onstage because it outshins what he's filming.His father was a talented, reserved director of sophisticated marrionette shows for children ( and adults ) He gave him a strong transmission as an individual. But only in an executive sense ; not an artistic one since his mother was too ambitious. Progidy is a subjective, ingenous gift best left unstirred, in developing years, by over-exposure or flattery or great expections, She over-stirred his pot with a silver spoon and there is even a hommage to her in Atonement's commentary.

1543174,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008220C38,Grady Harp,"[151, 185]","There have been many cinematic versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel ANNA KARENINA but for this viewer none matches the creative excellence and power of this very different version.  Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay for this adaptation and the work was directed with eye toward timeless artistry by Joe Wright. There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays, but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well.  The flavor of Tolstoy's story and mood are maintained and yet made somehow more vital by Wright's electing to place this story as though it were happening on a theater stage (including catwalks, backstage, audience and theater boxes etc.) The story is theatrical and Wright embellishes the last of the Czarist days with great aplomb.The story needs no summary: Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley more beautiful to behold and brilliant in acting than ever) is married to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law in a tour de force acting role) and is happy in her station with her slightly cool husband but very warm young son. Then quite unexpectedly her eyes meet those of the wealthy Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in a career making turn) and their love is immediate. The flirtation is enhanced by some of the most beautiful waltzing choreography on film. We are in St. Petersburg, Russia and divorce is something only a man /husband can initiate so as the love affair reaches a point of no return Anna must decide whether to bear the shame of a divorced woman or just be the mistress of the incredibly handsome Count and remain married. In contrast to the Anna/Vronsky duet is the passion of the country lad Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) for the aristocratic Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and throughout the story the two forms of love are paralleled. Anna becomes pregnant with Vronsky's child, an act that quietly infuriates Karenin as it makes Anna's affair public - a condition no one can tolerate in that society - and subsequently results in Anna's leaving her beloved son after she gives birth to the daughter belonging to Vronsky: Karenin will care for the child. The climax comes with Anna's infamous suicide and the story ends with all loose ends tied.The exceptionally strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Matthew Macfadyen, Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Ruth Wilson, Emily Watson, Michelle Dockery, and Shirley Henderson.  The luxuriant costumes are by Jacqueline Durran, the cinematography is by Seamus McGarvey, and the glorious musical score is by Dario Marianelli. A Stunning Film.

1543175,A1AMPGEFN9R9CT,B008220C38,grayjessical75,"[0, 0]","I haven't read Anna Karenina, though I plan to.  I cannot say how accurately this film depicts the novel because of this.  What I do know is that the director wanted to do something different, and therefore it is possible that he put a different spin on things than what the original author had intended.  For this reason, I don't think literary purists will like this movie...but then, literary purists probably prefer books anyway.The whole movie is set on a stage, which is interesting.  I think it helps take the &#34;edge&#34; off the movie.  Russian literature can be very heavy and depressing, and this format lightens the mood and makes it less painful.  However, because it is done on a stage, it also has the characteristics of a play that may cause some objections.  One thing I find about plays is that they tend to simplify things.  There are not deep conflicts about the characters that are delved into.  A person is cast as either a hero(ine), extra, or villain.  You are supposed to root for the good guys and hiss at the bad ones.I definitely got the feeling that either the screenwriter or the director probably had some experience with a cheating lover.  I feel that this movie is very unsympathetic to Anna.  For this reason, though, it is probably a great movie to watch if you get dumped.  I can picture sitting on the couch, eating ice cream, crying, and cheering when that selfish broad gets hit by a train...picturing whoever has hurt you being in her place.  I don't know about you guys, but I regretted Vronsky didn't also get it.Kiera Knightley played this well, though she didn't really make Anna sympathetic.  Knightley has a certain crudity that makes her wonderful as the girlfriend of a pirate, but not as acceptable as the wife of a respected Russian minister.  However, the age difference between Anna and her husband is more definite in this movie compared to some of the others.  Anna seems very young and rather immature, and though she is not sympathetic exactly, the audience may understand her motivations better.I got this movie mainly because of Jude Law.  I'm not usually a big fan of his, and I'm not a big fan of Anna Karenina...but I really liked him in this film.  I don't know if his part isn't larger compared to some of the other movies.  The director did seem to want to focus more on Alexei Karenin--and how his emotional turmoil makes him unfold as the story goes on.  Though Karenin is generally a character you feel sorry for, there are some things about him that makes you understand why his wife may cheat on him.  The age difference, the fact that he seems too busy for his family, his general uptightness, and his sometimes rather creepy stalking behavior...yes, you can perhaps understand. [SPOILER COMING UP HERE: And if you are wondering, yes, that is a condom in that little glass case.  I watched the movie two times trying to figure that out.  I thought it was an eyeglass holder, but it looked rather strange.  I finally had to google it.  I didn't even know they had condoms then.  Then I got a little grossed out.]Vronsky creeped me out.  I didn't really like the actor that played him.  The only problem is, I don't know what Vronsky is supposed to be.  The character struck me as being rather predatory, an untalented man who always wants what he can't have...particularly if it belongs to a man more successful than himself.  He also struck me as someone who has mommy issues and inwardly hates women, and he takes pleasure in humiliating and destroying women because of it.The characters you will root for without any problem are Konstantin and Kitty--the two truly pure people.  My favorite scene is where they use a block game to discuss their feelings for each other.Though the film summarizes everything, I think it does essentially highlight what seems to be Tolstoy's point--the many faces of love.  There is the dutiful love represented by Karenin, who is interested not exactly in passion but what endures...what you build a family on.

From then on, we move from theater to house to theater to street, etc., etc... It is a bit disorienting at the beginning, but once we adjust our expectations, it works very, very well. The actors' movements are sometimes balletic, sometimes comedic and sometimes simply theatrical, but director Joe Wright (""Atonement"") never loses control.We see:* Keira Knightley (""Pride and Prejudice"" 2005) is Princess Anna, sweet and unspoiled...but untested. She loves her son and never questions her wealth or doubts her position in society.* Jude Law (""Sherlock Holmes"") is Prince Karenin, Anna's husband, a cool and distant man who has absolute trust in his wife.* Aaron Taylor-Johnson (""Nowhere Boy"") is Count Vronsky, the pretty nobleman who spots Anna and is determined to win her.* Kelly Macdonald (""Gosford Park"") is Dolly, Anna's sister-in-law. She is such an open, loving woman, our hearts go out to her whenever she is on screen.* Matthew Macfadyen (""Death at a Funeral"" 2007) is Oblonsky, Anna's brother. He provides the comic relief. It's a marvelous trick the way his minions change his jackets; we see it a number of times and it never fails to amuse.* Alicia Vikander (""A Royal Affair"") is Kitty, the darling young woman who first falls for Count Vronsky.* David Wilmot (""The Guard"") is Nikolai, Oblonsky's love-struck brother who adores Kitty from afar. Tolstoy uses this farmer to examine the pre-Bolshevek Revolutionary relationship between the peasants and the nobles.This is a lush production with gorgeous costumes, amazing hair styles and a peek at the privileges enjoyed by the aristocracy. The Russians emulated the French, so the children were taught French, while the clothing and furniture echoed those of Paris.This R-rated film runs over two hours and is filled with endless close-ups that examine Knightley's face, hands, hair, eyes, lips, etc. I saw more than I needed during the love scenes: I still think some things are best left to our imagination (saliva anyone?).

He's not afraid to take a risk.

I can see where some/most? viewers could be put off, but to give an example: I rented ""Argo"" and ""Anna Karenina"" at the same time.

The dance scenes and choreography are ridiculous.The film shifts back and forth between a playhouse stage and a natural setting.  The horse race scene and the opera house scenes have very cheap scenery and the opera house looks shabby.  The actor playing Vronsky has zero charisma or sex appeal.  He looks like a foppish closet case.  Jude Law is the only remarkable actor in the cast.  Keira Knightly doesn't have the depth or classic beauty for a role like this.

Not having the time to go out afterward for our usual ""gab about the film over coffee"", I have been mulling it over alone for a few days now.  What did I think of the film? Hmmmm. I find it difficult to answer.First of all, if you enjoy period drama you should definitely see this film. I can even say that I will purchase this on DVD to have in my collection. But I have to say that I want to see it again more for the spectacle and the costumes and the ingenious set design than for the story.I will qualify this by saying that I have not read the book Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, touted as one of the best novels of all time. I do however, really want to read the novel now. And I want to see the film again after I have read the book and see if I feel differently about it. That is a recommendation for the film right there isn't it?The acting is superb. Keira Knightley does an amazing job as Anna Karenina. She is luminous onscreen and her descent into inevitable madness is riveting. Matthew McFadyen is wonderful as Anna's brother. Very odd to see he and Keira Knightley dancing together as brother and sister, having the image of Lizzy and Darcy from Pride and Prejudice 2005 stuck firmly in my head, but he is wonderful as the philandering brother. Jude Law is appropriately cold and detached as Anna's husband Karenin. But I don't think you will be emotionally attached to these characters because there isn't time for character development, even though it clocks in at just over 2 hours long.But I really did like it. The music was lovely, the costumes were to die for. Oh, the hats and the veils alone are worth the price of admission. And I think that Joe Wright can now be viewed as a singularly talented director. This was a real risk and he pulled it off admirably.I think my only quibble is the same one I would level at Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice. These books are just too long to be squeezed into 2 hours. If he could have been given the length of a miniseries to do this, it might have involved me more in the story, as one who knew little of the plot ahead of time. But in the time allotted, this is a truly wonderful film. And if it gets a lot of us to read the book, what more can we ask?P.S. Try not to be too distracted by the familiar actors from other beloved films. Points to anyone who can spot William the ill fated footman from Downton Abbey in this. Much easier to spot Lady Mary (and Moaning Myrtle and Jane Eyre and Mary Maceachran and Elsie the housemaid and Jane Fairfax and...)",4,"Anna Karenina- A visual feast, makes you want to read the book!",1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,2582,"['saw', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'week', 'group', 'girlfriends', 'Not', 'having', 'time', 'go', 'out', 'afterward', 'usual', 'gab', 'film', 'coffee', 'have', 'been', 'mulling', 'alone', 'few', 'days', 'now', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'film', 'Hmmmm', 'find', 'difficult', 'answer.First', 'enjoy', 'period', 'drama', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'even', 'say', 'will', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'have', 'collection', 'have', 'say', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'more', 'spectacle', 'costumes', 'ingenious', 'set', 'design', 'story.I', 'will', 'qualify', 'saying', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'touted', 'one', 'best', 'novels', 'time', 'do', 'however', 'really', 'want', 'read', 'novel', 'now', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'feel', 'differently', 'recommendation', 'film', 'right', ""n't"", 'acting', 'superb', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'amazing', 'job', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'luminous', 'onscreen', 'descent', 'inevitable', 'madness', 'riveting', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'wonderful', 'Anna', 'brother', 'Very', 'odd', 'see', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'dancing', 'together', 'brother', 'sister', 'having', 'image', 'Lizzy', 'Darcy', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '2005', 'stuck', 'firmly', 'head', 'wonderful', 'philandering', 'brother', 'Jude', 'Law', 'appropriately', 'cold', 'detached', 'Anna', 'husband', 'Karenin', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'characters', ""n't"", 'time', 'character', 'development', 'even', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'long.But', 'really', 'did', 'music', 'was', 'lovely', 'costumes', 'were', 'die', 'Oh', 'hats', 'veils', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'think', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'viewed', 'singularly', 'talented', 'director', 'was', 'real', 'risk', 'pulled', 'off', 'admirably.I', 'think', 'only', 'quibble', 'same', 'one', 'would', 'level', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'books', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'squeezed', '2', 'hours', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'length', 'miniseries', 'do', 'might', 'have', 'involved', 'more', 'story', 'one', 'who', 'knew', 'little', 'plot', 'ahead', 'time', 'time', 'allotted', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'lot', 'read', 'book', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'P.S', 'Try', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'distracted', 'familiar', 'actors', 'other', 'beloved', 'films', 'Points', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'spot', 'William', 'ill', 'fated', 'footman', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'Much', 'easier', 'spot', 'Lady', 'Mary', 'Moaning', 'Myrtle', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'Mary', 'Maceachran', 'Elsie', 'housemaid', 'Jane', 'Fairfax']",N/A

I love Leo Tolstoy and Anna Karenina is one of my favorite books - a beautifully rich story about love, lust, loss, and all things Russian.  With this all said, it's difficult to both not like, and to like, Wright's film.The post-modern approach to setting each scene on a &#34;stage&#34; just didn't work and it actually took away from the important context of the story.  I understand why Wright wanted to do this but it just doesn't work.  The setting of this story has everything to do with who the characters are and why the story is so tragic.  I wanted to see more of the countryside to understand Levin; more of St. Petersburg as the backdrop for Anna and Vronsky's heated attraction.  The weird theater backdrops not only didn't add to the landscape of the story, they took something away from it.I love Aaron Taylor-Johnson.  He was great in Kick Ass (don't be a hater - watch the film.  It's hilarious) and he was wonderful in Albert Nobbs.  The kid can act and he's very good looking.  But Vronksy's character is complex; yes he's a naive kid in many ways, but he's also sophisticated enough to match Anna in wit and in worldliness.  Taylor-Johnson was not old enough for this role and was not convincing.  I think a more experienced actor - maybe someone like Tom Hardy who is wonderful in period works, would have been good.Keira was wonderful.  Her clothes were spectacular; elegantly beautiful.  She was Anna - through and through.  The supporting actors were great too - especially Levin and Kitty.  But where was Levin's story?  The beauty of Anna Karenina is that Tolstoy balances out the story of false love / lust (Anna's affair with Vronsky) with what real love / commitment really are (Levin and Kitty's story).  I wanted more of Levin's story but of course, an almost 800 page book is hard to fit into a 2 to 3 hour film.I think this film is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the novel and or of Joe Wright's work.

Hated it with a deep and abiding passion.  It was badly cast, editing was absurd, and I'm pretty sure the screenwriters were escaped research chimps.  But much of my fury was over the blatant mishandling of the source material.With that in mind, I can certainly understand why devout Tolstoy fans will kick up a fuss. Sure, there are some holes and kinks in the fabric.  But what we get in return is a luscious, darkly whimsical fall from grace to utter devastation. While it raises eyebrows, I thoroughly love how the action winds between 'real' time and various behind-the-scenes metaphors. This was a wonderful way to show the internal conflicts of the characters. They also signal important shifts in the story without bulking up on expository dialog.Lastly, I'm happy to say that Knightley has MORE than redeemed herself in terms of her acting chops. She gave me hope with 'A Dangerous Method' and 'Never Let Me Go,' so this has sealed the deal. Sorry I was harsh on ya, girl. Now go find yourself another cool project and kick some Oscar a55.I encourage everyone to ease up on the Tolstoy orthodoxy and try to appreciate it for what it is.

1543225,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B008220C38,Kyle Slayzar,"[0, 1]","Having first heard of the newest Anna Karenina film via a trailer on the Les Miserables Blu Ray (A far superior film), and recognizing it as an adaptation of Tolstoy, my room mate and I split the bill and picked it up at the next available opportunity.  We are big fans of what mainstream media has dubbed ""more artistic"" styles of film, especially musicals... which we mistakenly believed Anna Karenina was.  We love films that push certain boundaries of acceptable filmmaking in order to tell a story.  If it enhances the story and overall experience, we're all for it and we sincerely hoped Anna Karenina would do just that!When we both had a mutual night off we broke out the popcorn, large cups of Cherry Pepsi (the perfect movie beverage as far as I'm concerned), popped in front of the home theater system (Klipsche Icon *smiley face*), and braced ourselves for what we thought would be a magical experience.It was not.Prior to picking up Anna Karenina, I read some of the user reviews on them internets to see what us everyday folk thought about it and, despite overwhelming evidence that I was about to purchase something incredibly stupid... I went ahead anyway and bought it.  What my room mate, who we shall lovingly refer to as ""Tito,"" and I were immediately subjected to was a rushed style of story telling that can be over simplified in one word; ""huh?""  Anna Karenina portrays itself as if... as if it were on an actual stage at a vintage-style theater and the only way the audience can watch this play is through the lens of a camera crew that film EVERYTHING including backstage and the above rafters.  When one character goes 'upstairs' to witness something he literally goes into the stage rafters!  You also see a faux curtain go up and down and stage hands removing pieces of scenery.  The only parts that were not filmed entirely on location at the Jim Beam Primary School of Theater were the country shots at the Levin Estate.  Even the 'snow' on the locomotives were more fake than Joan Rivers' face.On top of the really bizarre method of filming and portrayal the plot moves waaay too fast, the characters are hurriedly introduced, and not really elaborated on until later.  For instance, the film begins with adulterous brother to Anna Karenina, Stiva, getting caught up in his philandering ways, causes drama, gets the attention and sympathy of his sister Anna, and off she goes to see him.  Now, maybe my ADD makes it more difficult for me to process fast pacing story and dialog spoken by people with mismatched accents (British accents on Russian roles including Jude Law, it's Enemy at the Gates all over!), but come on people!  Talk a little slower and elaborate on the relations between characters because, to me, it seems as though the roll call for the entire Russian elite and royal family resembles the same style of roster for the city council of Rock Ridge (Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, Johnson, etc.).Granted, like War and Peace, Tolstoy made Anna Karenina a textbook size novel with over 800 pages and that means you have to condense the story... a LOT.  However, let us briefly compare this adaptation to the one that inspired me to buy it; Les Miserables.Anna Karenina was between 850-900 pages depending on what version you read, Les Miserables is almost 1,500!  Despite this, I was able to follow along with Les Miserables even with the poor group singing in certain parts.  Within ten minutes of watching Les Miserables I got the notion of who Jean Valjean is, a victim, and that prison guard and later Police Inspector Javert is an obsessive man with some serious issues.If Les Miserables can be effectively condensed, so can Anna Karenina.Alas, I digress.Tito and I attempted to keep up with the film and, for awhile, we were able to piece together some of the crazy love story without the need of a schematic.  However, what made the film more difficult to follow were the characters themselves.  I have NOT read the original novel (I have, however, read War and Peace) and cannot speak to how well the acting portrays the characters, but we felt as though all of them were... *thinks of an accurate, yet appropriate word to use* ... er... we hated them all.  They were all self-absorbed jerks that were too full of themselves to think of the consequences of their actions.  It was like watching an episode of any reality TV show whose title begins with ""Real Housewives of"" as the absurdity of the outlandish pageantry seemed totally pointless and the problems the characters experienced were brought upon themselves.I could not relate to any of the characters save for one, Levin, who was not a *insert bad name here* but an honest land owner with good professional scruples.  The only good aspect of the Levin side story is that that one actually ended well but, watch the film for yourself if you wanna know how... at your own risk.When the love triangles came full circle between Anna Karenina and Count Vronsky, a cavalry officer that Tito and I personally wanted to take out back and beat with various garden implements, came full circle we stopped taking the film seriously and began to riff it.  This means that we began throwing out ad lib commentary and numerous non sequiturs to make the film more interesting.  When a prominent character committed suicide towards the end of the film, we cheered as the drama of THAT person had come to end... THANK GOD.All in all, Anna Karenina was highly anticipated by myself and Tito but the film tried waaaay too hard to be artistic and, in essence, inadvertently engaged in a horrible act of self-sabotage.  It ruined itself with what was a stellar cast and a seemingly beautiful story.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless you are an amateur riffer that needs something to make fun of.",2,An Attempt at Artistry Becomes a Travesty,1367798400,"05 6,

I agree with other reviewers who stated that a large subtext of the novel was entirely missed and there was far too much emphasis on Anna's ultimate fate.  Whoever wrote the screenplay clearly did not ""get"" Tolstoy.  But no matter, there were other things that ruined the film for me.....I must describe the ""artsy"" part so you will know ahead of time if this kind of film suits you.  The movie is presented as a stage production.  Not quite a musical, but choreographed like one (ie, background characters performing tasks in tandem to music, frozen characters on the dance floor to emphasize Anna and Vronksy dancing, etc and so on).  New scenes are introduced by stage scenery changes, just as if you were in a real theater.  Much of the background information you need to know, such as Stiva and Dolly's problems that first bring Anna to Moscow, are done without much dialog, just the melodramatic over-acting to music that you would see on stage.  Hope you can picture this in your head.Anyway, I ultimately disliked the film intensely.  I was willing to overlook that casting of Knightly in the title role because of my adoration for the book, but in this case, Knightly didn't ruin the movie, the screenplay and choice of presentation did.

1543267,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008220C38,M. Oleson,"[9, 11]","Director Joe Wright certainly knows how to bring the best out of Keira Knightley in this, their third outing together.  Knightley glistens as Tolstoy's Anna who is married to a Russian aristocrat, Aleksei Karenin (Jude Law).  While their marriage is by all accounts happy, Anna also knows she has never known true love.  Although she doesn't search it out, it comes to her in the form of Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a rising military officer in the Imperial Russian army.Wright's take on this often filmed story combines and unusual setting of a stage production with characters traipsing across stages, sometimes in front of theater audiences.  Then as they head to the countryside, so does the camera.  At first this was a bit unsettling, but after a while I actually liked the concept.  I'm sure there is a subtext to it all.  I'm guessing it has something to do with the ""acting"" many of the upper crust society must play.The photography is beautiful and ranges from dark inner plebian bedrooms to opulent palaces to the white frozen landscape of 19th century Russia.  My biggest issue with the film is in the casting of Taylor-Johnson who was so good in ""Savages,"" ""Nowhere Boy"" and other films.  Here he is miscast as Vronsky who is portrayed as the most eligible bachelor.  His wispy blond mustache is a distraction in most of his scenes.  While Knightly gives it her all conveying an agonizing love for Vronsky, Taylor-Johnson isn't overly interested.  Perhaps I'm giving this too much attention but for me, the chemistry just wasn't there.  And after all, that is the point of the story.In a more interesting subplot, the scenes between Domhnall Gleeson as a rich landowner named Levin who wants to meet and marry young Kitty (Alicia Vikander) who is initially smitten by Vronsky.  She is the younger sister of Anna's sister-in-law.  In the only scene that caused my eyes to mist, Kitty who is now on her honeymoon, comforts Levin's dying brother because the innkeeper won't allow the brother's common law wife (and former prostitute) to be there.Over all, this is a film full of eye candy and fresh in its approach to a classic story.

1543275,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B008220C38,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[1, 2]","A BOLD NEW VISION!  As the movie trailer itself proclaims.STUNNINGLY VISUAL ART PIECE - SET LIKE A STAGE PLAY MUSICAL - NOT FOR MANY VIEWERSThis version is not necessarily for hardcore Tolstoy fans looking for a traditional performance.  It is a re-imagining of the work, taking the turmoil, the passionate dance, the poetic dialog and flinging them out again on an entirely new canvas.  Knowing this first, the viewer may still enjoy, or even love this film.  I did not expect this and confess I was very disappointed the first time I viewed it.  I wouldn't say Tolstoy lends itself to song and dance!  However, I re-read, re-watched, and I appreciate it much more.  I realized that the elements of the epic are actually here.  This piece is absolutely not for everyone and I am not sure even Tolstoy would approve.  However, it serves a purpose and I want to be fair to those who will appreciate it for the art piece it represents.  The dance is one of the most important pivot points of the story.  This movie takes the dance - a waltz instead of the mazurka - and creates one of the most beautiful interpretive dance scenes I have ever seen.  I would own it for that alone.  I still am not a fan of the way stage sets swirl around klezmatically to transition the scenes.  Or the odd way some of the extras break out into song sometimes (overall I would not call this a musical).  However, I appreciate the extraordinary choreography of tumultuous emotions, visual artistry, and flat out eye candy of cinematography.  I lean traditional, so this rendition is still not in my list of favorites.BRIEF COMPARISONS TO OTHER EDITIONS with links to the product  (this list is not comprehensive and I apologize if a favored version is not represented.  I already watched nearly 24 hrs of video not counting research and writing!)  This list is not in order of precedence and each version has merits.  You can see slightly more detailed versions of my reviews like the paragraph above by going to each product page.1977 BBC Mini SeriesAnna Kareninawith Nicola PagettThe Gold Standard of adaptations even after so many years.  Despite the 70's BBC acting style, this version has aged well with tremendous faithfulness to the book and ideas behind it.  Performances are melodramatic to today's audience, but so good they are relevant.  It is still my favorite rendition.  You must be up for nearly 10 hrs worth of story though.2000 Materpiece TheaterMasterpiece Classic: Anna Karenina, Part 1with Helen McCrory and Kevin McKiddThis version is the next longest I viewed and fairly faithful to the plot and spirit of the book.  The acting style is more natural (less stage play melodramatic) and the entire focus seems to be on a realistic portrayal.  Lead actors less compelling than I would have liked.  This version will still be some peoples' favorite.  It is not mine.1948Anna Kareninawith Vivien Leigh and Kieron MooreClassic black and white is a different style and shouldn't be compared too critically with modern adaptations.  It has the charm of a golden age of cinema.  Leigh is perhaps still the most elegant Anna and Kieron Moore the most dashing Vronsky after all this time.1997 Bernard Rose versionLeo Tolstoy's Anna Kareninawith Sophie Marceau and Sean BeanMost visually stunning of the traditional adaptations, gorgeous cinematography and recognizable stars galore.  Despite all the stars, acting is uneven and accents all over the place.  Choppy story flow.  Still one of my favorites!1985 TV MovieAnna Kareninawith Jacqueline Bisset and Christopher ReeveShortened or edited version is somewhat lifeless though the flow is less choppy than other adaptations.

I *never* purchase movies but purchased this one from Amazon.  I've now watched the film 3 times and am on the 4th as I write.  Each successive time I catch new bits of mastery and genius by director Joe Wright and screenwriter Tom Stoppard.The movie has so many layers it is hard to adequately describe.  I can only say watch, and watch again.  After the third or fourth time you will start to see how the pieces of this movie fit together like the pieces of any exceptional puzzle -- the blend of flavors by a great chef, the interplay of notes and themes of a great composition, the design of a beautiful garden.What is it that grabs you and just doesn't let go?:*DANCE & CHOREOGRAPHY are THE star of this show. You don't quite know if this is realism, camp, vogue, ballet, broadway, or what.  For me it worked beautifully and I typically don't like musicals.  There is no singing, but the combination of realistic dialog and story with the fantastical dance and choreographed movement of the actors worked stunningly.  My favorite scene of the movie -- the waltz scene -- is just mesmerizing...all of the dancers became frozen in time until Anna and Vronsky waltz past and pull them whirling into their vortex.  In particular Aaron Taylor-Johnson's dancing left me slackjawed.  All I can say is watch for yourself and see if you've ever seen a man dance like that.*SCREENPLAY.  Brilliant.  Each time I watch I see how the screenplay brings certainly not all of Tolstoy's plot, but surely a great deal of the meaning and larger themes he brought to the novel (I've since read several novel summaries).  The screenplay is layered -- each time you watch again you see and understand more.  These little bits step out front when you have watched several times and are no longer so distracted by the gorgeous and fantastical spectacle that is going on.*SETTING.  As others have noted; all the world's a stage in this movie.  For the first 10 minutes you don't know if you are watching the characters watch a play, but then you realize they *are* the play.  I remember feeling very off guard my first time watching...is Stiva going to be murdered by the barber?  Is the giant pear a bomb?  Why is the barber like a toreador?  Why is a couple dancing on the theater floor and another woman wandering playing a concertina?  What the HECK is going on??? After about 5 or 10 minutes you get it, settle in and it no longer seems strange... you truly feel that life *IS* art.  You never stop marveling at the beauty and ingenuity of it this bold directorial choice.  The juxtaposition of reality and theater setting, the model trains segueing to real trains and back -- these things seem like they could not possibly work in theory.  But they work.  The choreography and dialogue of the actors at cousin Betsy's society party and her firework surprise were visually stunning and just magical.* COSTUMES.  Lavish, gorgeous, over the top.  Wright uses color like no other.  Vronsky is all blond youthful curls, bright blue-eyed, and wore white and light blue, while Anna has deep dark burden of an older woman who has never loved -- she is dark haired, eyed and skinned, and wears only black or dark colors.  Wright made the unusual choice of using a lot of redhead and very fair-skinned men throughout and film, which was quite beautiful with the film's coloring, and yet cast olive skinned women as their love interests.  Very rich, visually interesting film.* ACTING:  Jude Law as Karenin, Matthew McFayden as Anna's brother Stiva, Domnhall Gleeson as country landowner Levin all had scene-stealing performances.  Olivia Williams shined as Vronsky's mother.  Ruth Wilson's delightful turn as Vronsky's bad-tinkerbell cousin Princess Betsy made a new fan of me.  Keira Knightly -- I'd give a maybe little pat on the back but nothing special.  She looked exquisite and handled her part quite well and maybe that was enough. While everyone says Aaron Taylor-Johnson was miscast as Vronsky, I suppose that is only if you expect the character to be true to the novel.  I thought Aaron brought a rakish vulnerability to the character that I've never quite seen on screen -- now that I think of it perhaps only Richard Gere in his youth -- rather like a desperate child on the one hand; on the other an arrogant cad, stopping at nothing to embroil a married woman in his torrid lust (or is it love?) affair.  I think he will turn out to be one of this generations most gifted actors.  You know the saying ""so handsome it hurts"".  Well he's that too.  Just as exquisite as Keira...so in that sense they are well matched, though I thought his depth as an actor was far greater.  Their almost impossible beauty adds to the pain of the relationship.Any more and this review would be too long.  See it for yourself, stick it out, and if nothing else, see something like you've never seen before.",5,"Beautiful, different, ingenious adaptation",1367625600,"05 4, 2013",2013,5010,"['have', 'not',

I found this film a riviting masterpiece of a production, an expanded stage play - the stage of life, the patterns of life - highly stylized, dance-like, like a poem, especially with the Russian backdrop.  It exemplifies the damage from following every whim - while the husband tries to maintain the semblance of a family for his children - order matters.  How eternally relevant.  (The life of the aristocrats reminds me of the film, ""The Age of Innocense"" with Daniel Day Lewis, had he and his lover followed their desire, she would have been cast out by her family with no money and in that film, she knows it.)  In Anna Karenina the plot is juxtaposed with the simpler, more earthy Russian peasant life, very poetic.  The dance-like scything of the wheat, comforting and washing the dying man - following the stage and patterns of nature - shadows of our forgotten past.  The acting is outstanding, the costumes and music are brilliant, the staging is a masterpiece.  I love Michele Dockery of Downton Abbey as well.  She's always excellent as an aristocat.

Yet Anna is bored out of her mind, and she catched the fancy of Count Vronsky (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and soon they embark on an ill-fated affair.Several comments: the movie is eye-candy from start to finish. For reasons not clear, the movie cuts back and forth between real-life scenes and a theatre, where some of the scenes are played out. While it allows for some nice and clever shots, it is never made clear why this is happening this way, other than I suppose for production value. The acting performances are great throughout, none more so that Knightley who carries the movie on her shoulders as much as she can. Alicia Vikander as Kitty also was noteworthy (I also saw her in another historical drama, Denmark's excellent ""A Royal Affair"", earlier this year--that movie is now playing in selected screens in the US). Yet despite all that, as I was watching this, I never fully connected emotionally and I never got pulled in, a big flaw in any movie I watch. I want to root for a character, or against one, or at least care emotionally. It didn't happen for me in this movie. Last but not least, the art-house theatre I saw this movie in this past weekend here in Cincinnati, was absolutely packed, I mean completely sold out. So there is definitely a strong interest in this movie. Whether it will be a break-out hit will depend on word of mouth.

1543297,A2TYSWTM5MSEXZ,B008220C38,Pedro Lpez,"[0, 0]","The story is Leo Tolstoy's  but the movie is Mr. Wright's. This is a film that is a bit difficult to appreciate, as is the novel, but I don't want to argue about the adaptation from the text.Joe Wright had already made two excellent films based on excellent novels:  Pride & Prejudice and Atonement,  both featuring Keira Knightley, but in this third collaboration he went a little further in his approach to the material, as we follow the story alternating two perspectives: the world of social rules and conveniences is shown as a theather play: characters move about in a stage, trough the props, having wardrobe changes on the go; and the world of true emotions and conflicts is shown as taking place in the real world.Both perspectives are beautifully shot by Seamus McGarvey and scored by Dario Marianelli, who were nominated for an academy award (both won for Atonement in 2008), actors dressed in costumes by Oscar winner Jacqueline Durran (who had also been nominated in 2008 for her work in Atonement).Keira Knightley phisically may not look very russian, but to me that was easily forgiven watching her in the role, she lifts the emotional weight of the film. I admired also the rest of the cast particularly for overcoming the extra difficulties they were presented with.Poor Anna Karenina's dilemma seems more than a bit outdated for our time, particularly since many movies in trying to appeal to the audience present conducts and behavior which are anachronisms for the period they are depicting, above all in respect to the social roles of women.  Anna's plight: discovering and following love outside her marriage, and the social consecuences it will bring her demand understanding of the audience.That said I must confess that the dual approach of Mr Wright tempted me to think that it was in favor of a smaller budget for the film, as a more conventional Anna Karenina movie would demand more expensive sets, locations, computer imagery to show exteriors of old Russia, but all those are just conventions that almost every movie, however serious it's intentions, offers. And Mr Wright's film's aren't lacking in beauty, in fact it is in that regard that I consider them exceptional, they take on fine and small details, and fill the screen with them, to me his films are impossible to watch just once.",4,Joe Wright's Anna Karenina,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,2320,"['story', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Wright', 'film', 'bit', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'novel', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'argue', 'adaptation', 'text.Joe', 'Wright', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'two', 'excellent', 'films', 'based', 'excellent', 'novels', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Atonement', 'featuring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'third', 'collaboration', 'went', 'little', 'further', 'approach', 'material', 'follow', 'story', 'alternating', 'two', 'perspectives', 'world', 'social', 'rules', 'conveniences', 'shown', 'theather', 'play', 'characters', 'move', 'stage', 'props', 'having', 'wardrobe', 'changes', 'go', 'world', 'true', 'emotions', 'conflicts', 'shown', 'taking', 'place', 'real', 'world.Both', 'perspectives', 'are', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'scored', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'who', 'were', 'nominated', 'academy', 'award', 'won', 'Atonement', '2008', 'actors', 'dressed', 'costumes', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jacqueline', 'Durran', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'been', 'nominated', '2008', 'work', 'Atonement', '.Keira', 'Knightley', 'phisically', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'very', 'russian', 'was', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'watching', 'role', 'emotional', 'weight', 'film', 'admired', 'also', 'rest', 'cast', 'particularly', 'overcoming', 'extra', 'difficulties', 'were', 'presented', 'with.Poor', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'dilemma', 'more', 'bit', 'outdated', 'time', 'particularly', 'many', 'movies', 'trying', 'appeal', 'audience', 'present', 'conducts', 'behavior', 'are', 'anachronisms', 'period', 'are', 'depicting', 'respect', 'social', 'roles', 'women', 'Anna', 'plight', 'discovering', 'following', 'love', 'marriage', 'social', 'consecuences', 'will', 'bring', 'demand', 'understanding', 'audience.That', 'said', 'must', 'confess', 'dual', 'approach', 'Mr', 'Wright', 'tempted', 'think', 'was', 'favor', 'smaller', 'budget', 'film', 'more', 'conventional', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'movie', 'would', 'demand', 'more', 'expensive', 'sets', 'locations', 'computer', 'imagery', 'show', 'exteriors', 'old', 'Russia', 'are', 'just', 'conventions', 'almost', 'movie', 'however', 'serious', 'intentions', 'offers', 'Mr', 'Wright', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'lacking', 'beauty', 'fact', 'regard', 'consider', 'exceptional', 'take', 'fine', 'small', 'details', 'fill', 'screen', 'films', 'are', 'impossible', 'watch', 'just', 'once']",N/A

It didn't make sense to me how it could only have 2 stars when the trailer made it look so good. Last night, I decided to try it out for myself and it did not disappoint! Granted, the style was a little jarring and confusing at first. The rapid scene changes can make it hard to follow if you're not familiar with the novel. I confess that I've read the first one-hundred or so pages of the book. I really enjoyed as far as I got into it and it did help quite a bit that I had previous knowledge of the characters and storyline.The main draw for me were the stunning visuals. It's a very breathtaking movie to watch in that regard. After I finished watching it last night, I did some researching about the plot and characters (there were things that remained a mystery to me). After brushing up a bit on my knowledge, things started to make much more sense. I watched it again today and I enjoyed it even more than the first time, and I noticed a lot of things that I hadn't noticed before. It's a very artistic and visually-driven film, full of symbolism and rich detail. It's a movie that requires multiple viewings to gain full appreciation and understanding.I'll be honest, though... this movie really isn't for everyone and that's totally OK. It's a bold movie with a bold style that not everyone will like and that certainly hasn't been done before. Even though I enjoyed the way it was filmed, it did have some limitations. The only thing I suggest is to keep an open mind and abandon your expectations. A lot of people who slammed this movie were disappointed because they were expecting what they experienced in the book or in a previous film adaptation.

I had a problem with the conceit of the theater setting.  It didn't illumine the story and seemed just like a self conscious arty idea.  The scenes where the actors froze were particularly annoying.The main problem for me though was the casting of Vronsky.  I'd expected Jude Law to be the romantic hero and was surprised to see him stuck away as the uptight, lackluster husband.  He would have made a terrific, passionate, Vronsky, someone worthy of Anna. This poor lad, no fault of his own, was just terribly miscast.  He looks like a teenager, almost feminine in his blond curls and big blue eyes, hardly the kind of fellow a woman would risk her family for.  The love scenes were not believable and I kept thinking of how Keira and Jude would have been amazing together.It's a huge task to adapt this novel into film length and I suppose they did a creditable job.  But I missed any reasonable rationale for Anna's transformation from the sweet, warm, loving person she is during the first two hours of the film to the harpy she plays at the end.  Is it the morphine?  Is Vronsky really cheating on her or is she just paranoid?  The film fails to make this plausible.

One an extended two part miniseries fairly recently and a much longer 10 part series from 1977.And then there was a quite beatiful movie done of it about a decade ago with Sophie Marceau and Sean Bean but with the same unavoidable defects due to limited running time but mercifully without all the ""stage"" artifice.And two classic ones also with Garbo and Greer Garson. Garbo of all of the actresses playing this role is the best cast perhaps.But Keira Knightly's performance and her ability to express an impressive emotional authenticity grew on me in this beautifully filmed, highly cinematic and imaginative version.The lasting appeal and greatness of the novel pivots on the honesty of the characters involved.Anna quite suddenly comes to a realization that she is infatuated with the somewhat mediocre Vronsky and blurts it all out to Karenin, her much older husband.Whatever Victorian restraints existed in 1874 didn't apply so rigidly in Moscow Society in 1874 except in its insistence to keep up appearances.When Anna asks Dolly, the wife of Anna's cheating brother who Anna had previously asked Dolly to forgive, ""Do you blame me for what I have done?"", Dolly unhesitantly says not at all. I wish I could have done the same but no one asked me to.And then Karenin, badly stung by Anna's infidelity, admits his own uncharacteristic hatred of her but overcomes it by gratiously deferring to both Vronsky and Anna in separate scenes.Though he too is dilatory in his committment to grant a divorce consistent with Tostoy's casting blame on ALL of his characters, refusing to ignore their moral failings and defects.No one is quite up to one's own ideals and standards in the end.And then there is Levin, whose story is not fully articulated. He is the ""idealist"" but in the novel he too is overwhelmed by circumstances and becomes far less saintly than he appeared to be.Tolstoy's novel is astounding in its candid portrayal of his characters, warts and all.The ""webs we weave"" he compassionately whispers to us.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[10, 13]","After watching the 2012 film remake of Leo Tolstoy's classic epic novel Anna Karenina, who can deny quoting within the lines and words of William Shakespeare, ""all the world's a stage, and all the men and women are merely players:  they have exits and their entrances; and man in his time plays many parts.""  Indeed, that is certainly what may cross one's mind while watching the work of Director Joe Wright and Screenplay Writer Tom Stoppard as well as from the cinematography and choreography to the elegant costumes that comprise of the entire production of the film.  The film's theatrical touch is greatly emphasized within a theater stage backdrop that interchanges with different scenes from ballroom dances to a dramatic horse race to actual outside scenes of the constant train that appears in out of the film as a toy and a real-life locomotive; suggesting a sense of departure but not quite leaving the station.For viewers that are familiar with Tolstoy's classic tale of intrigue and the whirlwind of affairs that center upon the life of Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley), the film may not be much of a surprise.  However, what may be amazing to this version is the pure imagination of all aspects of the film from the actors to the dramatics may provide a great amount of artistry like a music box or a snow globe.  And the praises do not end there but continue with the cinematography and the costume department because the story and the actors that are displayed in the film look much like an impressionistic painting by Renoir or Seurat but within the geographic setting of late nineteenth century Russia and its recognizable cold barren wintry and pastoral landscape.  But of course, the story cannot be left unmentioned and is identifiable in the film and is twofold.  First, the major dilemmas that Anna experiences within her traditional marriage to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law) and son Serhoza (Oskar McNamara) that she constantly dotes on, and the love triangle that emerges between she and Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that causes her marriage and world to crumble. The cold and constricted elements are truly shown.  Second, pocketed within Knightley's most dramatic role, other major characters show a glimmer of light in Anna's dark world.  There exists within the story between Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kitty (Alicia Vikander) that show that life is not at all abysmal and that through patience, time, and work, a happy ending may just come true.  And their story shows a display of freedom and less retrained qualities.  And also individuals in Anna's life that add a bit of comic relief within each situation, such as her brother Oblonsky (Matthew MacFadyen) and support Princess Myagkaya (Michelle Dockery) and Countess Lydia Ivanova (Emily Watson).Overall, Anna Karenina is an eye-opening film that may leave an impression on the viewer because of the theatrical display that is unforgettable.",5,Intense Imagery,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2931,"['watching', '2012', 'film', 'remake', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'epic', 'novel', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'who', 'can', 'deny', 'quoting', 'lines', 'words', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'world', 'stage', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'merely', 'players', 'have', 'exits', 'entrances', 'man', 'time', 'many', 'parts', 'Indeed', 'certainly', 'what', 'may', 'cross', 'one', 'mind', 'watching', 'work', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Screenplay', 'Writer', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'as', 'well', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'elegant', 'costumes', 'comprise', 'entire', 'production', 'film', 'film', 'theatrical', 'touch', 'greatly', 'emphasized', 'theater', 'stage', 'backdrop', 'different', 'scenes', 'ballroom', 'dances', 'dramatic', 'horse', 'race', 'actual', 'outside', 'scenes', 'constant', 'train', 'film', 'toy', 'real-life', 'locomotive', 'suggesting', 'sense', 'departure', 'not', 'quite', 'leaving', 'station.For', 'viewers', 'are', 'familiar', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'tale', 'intrigue', 'whirlwind', 'affairs', 'center', 'life', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'much', 'surprise', 'However', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'amazing', 'version', 'pure', 'imagination', 'aspects', 'film', 'actors', 'dramatics', 'may', 'provide', 'great', 'amount', 'artistry', 'music', 'box', 'snow', 'globe', 'praises', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'there', 'continue', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'department', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'displayed', 'film', 'look', 'much', 'impressionistic', 'painting', 'Renoir', 'Seurat', 'geographic', 'setting', 'late', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'Russia', 'recognizable', 'cold', 'barren', 'wintry', 'pastoral', 'landscape', 'course', 'story', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'unmentioned', 'identifiable', 'film', 'twofold', 'First', 'major', 'dilemmas', 'Anna', 'traditional', 'marriage', 'Alexei', 'Karenin', 'Jude', 'Law', 'son', 'Serhoza', 'Oskar', 'McNamara', 'constantly', 'love', 'triangle', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'Aaron', 'Taylor-Johnson', 'marriage', 'world', 'crumble', 'cold', 'constricted', 'elements', 'are', 'truly', 'shown', 'Second', 'pocketed', 'Knightley', 'most', 'dramatic', 'role', 'other', 'major', 'characters', 'show', 'glimmer', 'light', 'Anna', 'dark', 'world', 'story', 'Levin', 'Domhnall', 'Gleeson', 'Kitty', 'Alicia', 'Vikander', 'show', 'life', 'not', 'abysmal', 'patience', 'time', 'work', 'happy', 'ending', 'may', 'just', 'come', 'true', 'story', 'display', 'freedom', 'less', 'retrained', 'qualities', 'also', 'individuals', 'Anna', 'life', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief', 'situation', 'such', 'brother', 'Oblonsky', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'support', 'Princess', 'Myagkaya', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Countess', 'Lydia', 'Ivanova', 'Emily', 'Watson', '.Overall', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'eye-opening', 'film', 'may', 'leave', 'impression', 'viewer', 'theatrical', 'display', 'unforgettable']",N/A

Many of the scenes are highly exaggerated: dance at the ball, office where Anna's brother works in the office and endless stream of paperwork.Many who have read the novel often wondered what would happen to Anna and her beloved if they did end up getting married?  Would they be happy or would ""life"" happen to them too? Keira Knightly was wonderful choice for the role of Anna - fresh face with beautiful classical facial features, dark eyes and wild hair.  I just did not like Alexey Vronsky's mustache.  It looked too pompous and I could not imagine any woman taking him seriously.  Tolstoy tells the story of love and reason.  The two usually do not go together.  It is usally when love is not strong enough that reason takes over and then it simply becomes practial for all parties involved.  The older I get the harder it is for me to believe that life is simply about that. Life should not be just about duty and responsibility - there must be some joy and happiness in it too....

Confusion is increased by the means by which this production is framed: we start out with a proscenium, and the conceit is we're watching a stage production, but we go on to have the story set in all kinds of naturalistic settings, with transitions always harkening back to the stage-play notion. I had a hard time remembering when we were in Moscow and when in St. Petersburg. But about a third of the way through I got the hang of it, and enjoyed it. Keira Knightly has one of those faces that looks so familiar, but I checked IMDB and couldn't identify anything else I'd seen her in. She is a beauty to be sure, and a fine, nuanced actress. What brought me to this film was the presence of Ruth Wilson, with whom I am in love, thanks to her work on the British detective show Luther.

1543313,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B008220C38,RMurray847,"[14, 18]","I have never read ANNA KARININA, nor do I expect to.  Here's what I knew about the book going into the movie:  it was written by Leo Tolstoy and (spoiler ahead) the lead character throws herself under a train.  Oh, and it's set in Russia sometime before the fall of the Czars.So I went into the film with few expectations, and I will be unable to comment on whether this adaptation is faithful or not.  But I can opine on if I liked the movie.It tells the tale of Anna, the wife of an aristocrat/politician.  She lives in St. Petersburg, with her husband and young son.  But when travelling to Moscow to try to ask her sister-in-law to make up with her womanizing scoundrel of a husband, she meets a dashing young officer and the two launch into a torrid and scandalous affair.  Misery ensues.I know this sounds a bit dismissive, but I don't intend it to be.  I think that if you don't know the story, it would be unfair of me to tell you more, as the twists and turns, both romantic & political, are most of the fun in the story.Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) has, in a huge error, tried to stage this movie as though it were an elaborate stage production.  The actors move around an enormous theater and various pieces of scenery roll in and out.  All parts of the venue become staging areas, including the rafters, the wings and the audience.  Sometimes, though, this conceit lapses.  This lapse always occurs when there are scenes staged ""in the country""...and it occurs to the viewer eventually that much like Tolstoy always did, Wright is trying to convey that city life, politics, petty affairs of the rich, etc.  are all transient and theatrical...the only ""real"" things are of and for the land and thus, Mother Russia.  We meet several key characters who achieve a form of salvation through connecting or reconnecting with the land.  This is a noble (if grossly oversimplified) idea, and it is in fact these outdoor, on location scenes that perhaps fare the best...they are freed from the staginess of the rest of the film.  But Wright spends much of the film, particularly in the early going, letting us see how the scenery rolls in and out and how cleverly he has staged everything that the story itself is practically a distraction.  I understand WHAT he is trying to convey...but it is done with such artifice and clumsiness that it fails.  I appreciate his efforts, but all his showiness deflates much of the emotion of the film.Keira Knightley plays Anna, and she gives another solid performance in a ""period piece.""  She looks great in her costumes, moves with regal authority and to her credit, isn't afraid to make her character unlikeable.  At times, with side with Anna as she rebels against societal shackles and yearns for passion.  At other times though, she flings herself headlong into reckless behavior that threatens her relationship with her children, her standing in society, her husband's career and even her own sanity.  Knightley embraces all these sides with gusto.  Her performance makes this movie worth seeing.Jude Law is her husband.  It's a little unsettling seeing him playing the older, repressed politician.  When did he age?  But then I remember that he can still play spry and fun (SHERLOCK HOLMES), and I realize what a terrific, contained performance he's giving.  Yes, he's repressed and dreadfully dull.  He's also heartbreakingly perplexed when he sees Anna's behavior.  He was truly the character I rooted for most consistently, even as I realized he was not exactly great husband and father material.As the young soldier, Aaron Johnson (KICK ASS, NOWHERE BOY) tries awfully hard.  He is not assisted by a costume and hairstyle that make him look like he belongs in the ""Rock Me Amadeus"" music video...but Johnson is all softness and ""baby-like.""  I can almost see why Anna is initially attracted to him.  He is clearly attracted to her, he's somewhat dashing and he's capable of passion.  But he's revealed to be selfish, whiney and ultimately more concerned with his happiness than hers.  Some of this is the script, but Johnson does little to dig deeper into his character to find something to make us care for him as the events of the story begin to spin out of control.Overall, this is a film more interesting than compelling.  Knightley and Law make it worth seeing, but it also fades quickly from the memory.  I would give it 3.3 stars.  If Wright had refrained from unneeded theatricality, it would be a 4 star film.",3,"3.3 stars.

1543342,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008220C38,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 0]","Sad story (for abandoned son and husband); in this version of Tolstoy's classic, dumb story of nitwit heroine.  Liked the actors.  Hard to be sympathetic to Anna because of her selfish choices, when she was clearly old enough to know better.  Her husband was presented as an outstanding person - to me, no comparison in character quality between him and her boy toy.  Apparently she married too young and had no time to kick up her heels and so was ripe for seduction when a player came along.  She found his interest so flattering that ultimately she left her husband and young son for him, knowing nothing about him except that she desired him and he her.The story wasn't told effectively, as the storytellers did nothing to protect Anna's estimation in the audience's eyes: the storytellers should have made her husband less extraordinary and given her lover far more appeal; as is, her choices make her seem stupid, which I don't think was their intent.  All the actors were good, but I think miscast.  Kiera was made to look older, but didn't quite pull it off.  Her husband, I forget his name (oh wait, Jude Law), was the most honorable film character I've ever seen, and just his behavior alone should have made a sane female character remain by his side.  Anna's lover is merely handsome, in my opinion she is just a conquest to him, as evidenced in his conversations with his female lady friend.Just disliked him; he was a hunter on the prowl, caring nothing (in my humble opinion) for her initially (perhaps loving her somewhat after their affair had begun), but I disliked him for pursuing a happily married woman.  Early in the story he gave money to cover the burial of a poor man killed under the train, and I suspect he did so as he knew Anna was watching and wanted her to notice him.  Story didn't show that, but later in film, a conversation he has with a female friend social strategist clearly showed he knew what he was doing, and that his actions were very deliberately focused.  He really did all the running initially.  Can't blame him for Anna's ruin entirely as she at some point said yes, but she was a moron and he a selfish, self indulgent boy-man, willing to destroy a marriage for his sexual gratification.The screenplay is poorly executed as Anna demonstrates early in the story that she understands society's rules (when attempting to mentor her friend with the straying husband), yet she throws herself under the train (figueratively (sp?)) by starting divorce proceedings against her husband, and though knowing she'll be socially ostracized, cries and takes morphine to comfort herself.  Her character in this version wasn't well thought out.  Whatever the novel wrote (I don't remember that story after all this time), the screenwriters should have made sure the audience understood why Anna made her choices and if not condone them, at least appreciate why she felt she had to make them.  With her mature, kindly, truly loving husband attempting to advise her, rather than scream at her in outrage, the storytellers did Anna no favors.  This is Anna's story so it would be helpful if audience can see the story from her perspective and sympathize.  This version makes it real hard to do that.And unfortunately she never questions the character of a person who pursues a happily married wife and mother.  One wonders how this Anna survived as long as she did, and we can only conclude that the wealth of her husband, as well as his kind and loving heart, protected her from herself.  In this story, Anna does her own self in, for no understandable reason.On a sidenote, nice vehicle for Jude Law, but I thought (at least in theory), Anna Karenina was supposed to be a vehicle for Keira Knightley too.",2,not a success...(SPOILERS),1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3737,"['Sad', 'story', 'abandoned', 'son', 'husband', 'version', 'Tolstoy', 'classic', 'dumb', 'story', 'nitwit', 'heroine', 'Liked', 'actors', 'Hard', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'Anna', 'selfish', 'choices', 'when', 'was', 'clearly', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'better', 'husband', 'was', 'presented', 'outstanding', 'person', 'comparison', 'character', 'quality', 'boy', 'toy', 'Apparently', 'married', 'too', 'young', 'had', 'time', 'kick', 'up', 'heels', 'so', 'was', 'ripe', 'seduction', 'when', 'player', 'came', 'along', 'found', 'interest', 'so', 'flattering', 'ultimately', 'left', 'husband', 'young', 'son', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'desired', 'her.The', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'effectively', 'storytellers', 'did', 'nothing', 'protect', 'Anna', 'estimation', 'audience', 'eyes', 'storytellers', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'husband', 'extraordinary', 'given', 'lover', 'far', 'more', 'appeal', 'choices', 'make', 'seem', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intent', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'think', 'miscast', 'Kiera', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'older', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'husband', 'forget', 'name', 'oh', 'wait', 'Jude', 'Law', 'was', 'most', 'honorable', 'film', 'character', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'just', 'behavior', 'alone', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'sane', 'female', 'character', 'remain', 'side', 'Anna', 'lover', 'merely', 'handsome', 'opinion', 'just', 'conquest', 'evidenced', 'conversations', 'female', 'lady', 'friend.Just', 'disliked', 'was', 'hunter', 'prowl', 'caring', 'nothing', 'humble', 'opinion', 'initially', 'perhaps', 'loving', 'somewhat', 'affair', 'had', 'begun', 'disliked', 'pursuing', 'happily', 'married', 'woman', 'Early', 'story', 'gave', 'money', 'cover', 'burial', 'poor', 'man', 'killed', 'train', 'suspect', 'did', 'so', 'knew', 'Anna', 'was', 'watching', 'wanted', 'notice', 'Story', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'later', 'film', 'conversation', 'female', 'friend', 'social', 'strategist', 'clearly', 'showed', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'actions', 'were', 'very', 'deliberately', 'focused', 'really', 'did', 'running', 'initially', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Anna', 'ruin', 'entirely', 'point', 'said', 'yes', 'was', 'moron', 'selfish', 'self', 'indulgent', 'boy-man', 'willing', 'destroy', 'marriage', 'sexual', 'gratification.The', 'screenplay', 'poorly', 'executed', 'Anna', 'early', 'story', 'society', 'rules', 'when', 'attempting', 'mentor', 'friend', 'straying', 'husband', 'yet', 'train', 'figueratively', 'sp', 'starting', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'husband', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'socially', 'ostracized', 'cries', 'morphine', 'comfort', 'character', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'novel', 'wrote', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'story', 'time', 'screenwriters', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'sure', 'audience', 'understood', 'why', 'Anna', 'made', 'choices', 'not', 'condone', 'least', 'appreciate', 'why', 'felt', 'had', 'make', 'mature', 'kindly', 'truly', 'loving', 'husband', 'attempting', 'advise', 'rather', 'scream', 'outrage', 'storytellers', 'did', 'Anna', 'favors', 'Anna', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'perspective', 'sympathize', 'version', 'real', 'hard', 'do', 'that.And', 'unfortunately', 'never', 'questions', 'character', 'person', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'wife', 'mother', 'One', 'how', 'Anna', 'survived', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'wealth', 'husband', 'as', 'well', 'kind', 'loving', 'heart', 'protected', 'herself', 'story', 'Anna', 'own', 'self', 'understandable', 'reason.On', 'sidenote', 'nice', 'vehicle', 'Jude', 'Law', 'thought', 'least', 'theory', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'vehicle', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'too']",N/A

Is this a theatrical experience or a cinematic one... or something else entirely? It's like the writers, director and producer sat down with a bong to do the brainstorming for this and settled on the opinion that, ""Yeah, that's a good idea"" without thinking things through. For instance, there are scenes when everything freezes except the main character. Or things are moving right along in a realistic manner and then suddenly everyone is on stage with a really fake looking backdrops. Or in the dance scene, some of the dancers are moving, but not all of them. It's distracting. What am I supposed to be looking at and why? Those things seem to serve no purpose other than to be creative.If you are going to do a movie about a book, there should be some semblance of the original story. This movie does a terrible job at that as well. I get that maybe you want to highlight a different aspect, tell it from a different perspective or turn an angle here and there, but this is so far from the original that it ceases to be a tragedy. I didn't feel any pity for Anna at all. She came across as insensitive, selfish, arrogant and finally crazy. This wasn't a love story. It was a common story of a bored, immature wife having a cheap affair.If you are going to do a remake of a movie, you should do something different or do it better. It's different, but not better. The Vivian Leigh version is definitely the best.The movie manages to earn 2 stars in my book, however, because the costuming and settings are delicious! Whether we are in the country with paupers or dining with the Russian aristocracy, it's a delight for the eyes.The acting has some high points. Jude Law (Karenin), Olivia Williams (Countess Vronsky), and Emily Watson (Countess Ivanova) were excellent. Unfortunately that was not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. I normally love Matthew MacFadyen but he was too British. In fact, the whole cast was too British. Despite the snow, the furs, and the Russian names, there was no Russian feel about this piece at all. I found that a big detraction. Casting Keira Knightly in the lead role was also a mistake. She is always the same. It's like she figured out a formula and said, ""This has worked for me before. I am sticking to it."" She just hasn't grown as an actress at all. She's not 21 anymore, but she still has the immaturity of a girl. Her part lacked juice. I couldn't relate to her and didn't care about her.

The aristocracy live their live on the stage. It is a world of drama, make believe and one that will soon draw its final curtain. The workers are off stage and live in the rafters and audience supporting the rich. Who is really happy?The locomotion movement and sound represented the emotions of Anna, thrusting when she feels raw passion and falling silent at the end. In addition to the symbolism, the film has the irony of Anna attempting to patch up an infidelity relationship only to fall into one. Perhaps inadvertently,  the novel portrays how women are trapped inside a man's world.Konstantin seems to represent ""us"" in this film as he is a man who freely travels between two worlds as he seeks his happiness.

All you have to know is that the latest cinematic adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"" is directed by Joe Wright, responsible for such films as ""Atonement"" and the 2005 version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" starring Keira Knightley. Back then the director tended to use filming techniques like long take, but now his penchant for so-called ""style over substance"" has gone too far.Keira Knightley (her third collaboration with the director) plays the titular heroine who has a love affair with Count Vronsky (miscast Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The familiar story is told in a unique fashion, where the viewer is constantly made aware that he/she is watching a stage production. Characters are often seen moving in an exaggerated way, as if choreographed by someone off stage.The problem is, despite the beautiful costumes and nice production design, the film gets less and less interesting as it goes on, with the story that is superficial and emotionally distant. It is not Anna Karenina or anyone else from Tolstoy's book, but the director himself, who takes center stage, so as to keep showing his visual tricks.""Anna Karenina"" is a kind of film some would hail as something original, a triumph of the director's experimental approach to the classic, while others (including me) would dismiss it as something pretentious, a failed attempt of someone too self-absorbed.",2,"So Beautiful, So Distant",1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1444,"['original', 'book', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'very', 'famous', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'do', 'recap', 'here', 'All', 'have', 'know', 'latest', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'responsible', 'such', 'films', 'Atonement', '2005', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Back', 'then', 'director', 'tended', 'use', 'filming', 'techniques', 'long', 'take', 'now', 'penchant', 'so-called', 'style', 'substance', 'gone', 'too', 'far.Keira', 'Knightley', 'third', 'collaboration', 'director', 'titular', 'heroine', 'who', 'love', 'affair', 'Count', 'Vronsky', 'miscast', 'Aaron', 'Taylor-Johnson', 'familiar', 'story', 'told', 'unique', 'fashion', 'where', 'viewer', 'constantly', 'made', 'aware', 'he/she', 'watching', 'stage', 'production', 'Characters', 'are', 'often', 'seen', 'moving', 'exaggerated', 'way', 'choreographed', 'someone', 'stage.The', 'problem', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'nice', 'production', 'design', 'film', 'less', 'less', 'interesting', 'story', 'superficial', 'emotionally', 'distant', 'not', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'anyone', 'else', 'Tolstoy', 'book', 'director', 'who', 'center', 'stage', 'so', 'keep', 'showing', 'visual', 'tricks', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'hail', 'something', 'original', 'triumph', 'director', 'experimental', 'approach', 'classic', 'others', 'including', 'would', 'dismiss', 'something', 'pretentious', 'failed', 'attempt', 'someone', 'too', 'self-absorbed']",N/A

What a horrific representation of Tolstoy's masterpiece.  Be ready for a bizarre ride.  Not only does the director try far too hard to approach it in a unique and original fashion (stages, sets, slow or frozen actors, behind the stage scenes, etc.) they completely destroy the story. Anyone going into this without having read the book will have no idea what is going on and instead of feeling compassion for Anna one only feels contempt and very little sorrow in her last act, as she is more like Madame Bovary than Tolstoy's tragic heroine.Important things missing...here are just a few!Anna being married to someone far older than her.  An arranged marriage, not a love one.Anna trying desperately NOT to get involved or compromise herself, hence the heroine.  Kiera Knightley's version makes her very little less than a common prostitute rather than fateful star-crossed lovers.Kitty being ill, kitty being heartbroken, Kitty rising above her station, lowering herself because of love and compassion.Levin trying to figure out the meaning of life.  Levin's brother being washed not because he was sick, but because he was dying and his body was being prepared before the priest came to give last rites.Sad abandonment of any &#34;Beautiful Corners&#34; where Icons are placed for prayers in each household.No scenes of marriages in the Orthodox Church and who will raise their candle the highest.No explanation of why Anna is taking morphine and why it gets out of hand.

And what's even worse is the horrible way they have staged and blocked the film.  It looks as if the actors are all performing on a big stage, then they're not.  Or one couple is dancing and all the others freeze.  Then later, Anna steps off of a train and is on a big ship (?) but really isn't, and everyone freezes in place.

Flanigan Jr.,"[1, 1]","Fancy window dressing and art for art&#8217;s sake fail to compensate for what is simply a creaky morality point of view from the latter part of the 19th Century.  Worse than being irrelevant for the early 21st Century, it&#8217;s just plain boring as a film.  The machinery of using a play within a play and film inside and outside of a play becomes tedious rather quickly as well as virtually eliminating the chance of building audience bonding with the protagonists.  Just when character empathy starts to build, the machinery dashes this prospect by repeatedly and abruptly shifting from film-generated intimacy to distant, formal stage play by actors who do not seem to have much in the way of (or are prevented from exhibiting) stage-acting presence.  The silliness includes unending disco-dancing waltzes, meaningless mannerism, and a model electric train that predate the invention of the light bulb.  Gigantic misuse of talent on all levels (above and below the line) with the exception of the film score which is brimming with very cleaver audio segues and leif motifs.
