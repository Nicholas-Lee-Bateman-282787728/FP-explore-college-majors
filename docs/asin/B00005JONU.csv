642311,A33CGUK6890TP3,B00005JONU,Andre Ali Seewood,"[0, 7]","While it is common knowledge that almost every filmmaker is influenced by the films and filmmakers he or she admires, an unfortunate effect of too much admiration is that one does not develop a cinematic style that is wholly one's own.  Just as we can readily identify the cinematic style of Scorsese vis-a-vis Spielberg or Lucas vis-a-vis Cimino- we can also recognize when up and coming filmmakers have consumed too much of the style of others to have a style of their own.  Battaglia is just such a film, by just such a filmmaker.  From the frame story (reminiscent of Cameron's TITANIC) to the war action (reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan or any recent film about World War II, the style of the film is too derivative and dulls the heroic tale.  Although the filmmaker certainly spent a great deal of effort constructing very interesting shots (particularly the wide shots with multiple planes of action criss-crossing our field of view)there is nothing that hasn't been seen before.  The use of sound is particularly disappointing- in spite of the fact that much of the excitement of the shots and the story depends on the use of sound.  We remember how Sam Peckinpah demanded authentic sounding gunfire for his Western Epic THE WILD BUNCH and because he demanded such authenticity- his Western was immediately different than all other Westerns because of this simple insistence.  The same is not true here in Battaglia, too much of the gunfire and war sounds do not sound authentic.  The dangerous cachopony of sound that represents war is created as much through silence as it is through bombs and bullets.  I feel the filmmaker went too far in the wrong direction by not using silence to his advantage- particularly in the scene where the two soldiers walk together.  Silence would have made his sudden death a greater shock for the audience.  We would do well here to remember Robert Rossen's A WALK IN THE SUN as a reference point.  To sum up, to do any kind of film now about WWII one must look further in the past for influences or find alternate ways to make one's vision authentic (sound and silence) are just a few of those ways.  Battaglia's heroic story deserves to be told, but it must be told as uniquely as possible to stand in the company of the other great war films that depict that period.",3,An Unfortunate Effect,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,2315,"['common', 'knowledge', 'almost', 'filmmaker', 'influenced', 'films', 'filmmakers', 'unfortunate', 'effect', 'too', 'much', 'admiration', 'one', 'not', 'develop', 'cinematic', 'style', 'wholly', 'one', 'own', 'Just', 'can', 'readily', 'identify', 'cinematic', 'style', 'Scorsese', 'vis-a-vis', 'Spielberg', 'Lucas', 'vis-a-vis', 'Cimino-', 'can', 'also', 'recognize', 'when', 'up', 'coming', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'consumed', 'too', 'much', 'style', 'others', 'have', 'style', 'own', 'Battaglia', 'just', 'such', 'film', 'just', 'filmmaker', 'frame', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'Cameron', 'TITANIC', 'war', 'action', 'reminiscent', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'recent', 'film', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'style', 'film', 'too', 'derivative', 'heroic', 'tale', 'filmmaker', 'certainly', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'constructing', 'very', 'interesting', 'shots', 'particularly', 'wide', 'shots', 'multiple', 'planes', 'action', 'criss-crossing', 'field', 'view', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'use', 'sound', 'particularly', 'disappointing-', 'spite', 'fact', 'much', 'excitement', 'shots', 'story', 'use', 'sound', 'remember', 'how', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'demanded', 'authentic', 'sounding', 'gunfire', 'Western', 'Epic', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'demanded', 'such', 'authenticity-', 'Western', 'was', 'immediately', 'different', 'other', 'Westerns', 'simple', 'insistence', 'same', 'not', 'true', 'here', 'Battaglia', 'too', 'much', 'gunfire', 'war', 'sounds', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'authentic', 'dangerous', 'cachopony', 'sound', 'war', 'created', 'much', 'silence', 'bombs', 'bullets', 'feel', 'filmmaker', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'wrong', 'direction', 'not', 'using', 'silence', 'advantage-', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'soldiers', 'walk', 'together', 'Silence', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sudden', 'death', 'greater', 'shock', 'audience', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'here', 'remember', 'Robert', 'Rossen', 'WALK', 'IN', 'THE', 'SUN', 'reference', 'point', 'sum', 'up', 'do', 'kind', 'film', 'now', 'WWII', 'one', 'must', 'look', 'further', 'past', 'influences', 'find', 'alternate', 'ways', 'make', 'one', 'vision', 'authentic', 'sound', 'silence', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'ways', 'Battaglia', 'heroic', 'story', 'deserves', 'be', 'told', 'must', 'be', 'told', 'as', 'uniquely', 'possible', 'stand', 'company', 'other', 'great', 'war', 'films', 'depict', 'period']",Battaglia Theatrical Release

I don't care about the director's website, I care about the film.This film is excellent. From it's writing and acting, to it's cinematography, directing, and editing, from beginning to end it captivated me like not other short film before it.

Especially as the heroes from that time period pass on, we need to be remembered of their sacrifices.The acting is decent.

I respect the logistics behind gathering the vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. However, it reminds me of an interview with George Lucas where he criticized other Sci Fi movies who built elaborate sets and then spent a great deal of the movie showing off the set despite the fact that the story was not progressing. The story of Battaglia was nice, but this movie has been made before. For this competition I would like to see the film makers take more risks. This one did not.

It gave me a tinge of Pearl Harbor mixed in with a pinch of Titanic (I know it's not a war movie) to make this good concoction of a movie.I understood the beginning, okay, they're in a museum.  The men could've looked younger and maybe a little gaudy.  This is a war!  The men looked healthy and some of them over weight.  this doesn't really add to the realism or drama of the movie.  For a moment there I thought I was being shown a product short film and at the end I'd have the opportunity to purchase a camera or a digital camera of some sort. The special effects were nice except for the very last effect it looked really weak.  There's a blast and a bit of smoke, the men should've been flying off somewhere.  I'd like to know the budget for the film?Also, the baby kept getting thrown/passed around like a hot potato.  Too much attention on the baby, I got it, this is a war-hero movie.  Too much baby time.  Unless, I'd be shown at the end that the baby had something to do with the present. Aha!The only acting I appreciated was that of the soldiers.  The old lady,the man, and woman at the beginning and end didn't do it for me.  They're acting was weak.I was left with this thought, ""Was the old lady related to someone who was rescued? Was the old lady rescued herself? What her role other than that of the museum keeper?"" It would've been more interesting if the old lady had been the baby or the little girl that was rescued.  I never understood this part.  What did stay with me is the idea that we have to put up museums in order to not forget the past to keep them alive in our modern world.

It could have worked if cuts were moved off of them faster. Was the old lady in some way connected--was she rescued..?  Dialogue was also weak.

Who the man at the memorial was there to honor was not clearly established--that was confusing. If he was looking for the pictures of his journalist grandfather to begin with then we could have connected to the jouranlist when we saw him. Who the ""hero"" was was not clear--I get that it was about them both but it is too short for us to have them both be the ""main guy.""
