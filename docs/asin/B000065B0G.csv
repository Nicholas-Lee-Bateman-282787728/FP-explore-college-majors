699661,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000065B0G,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","This is a modern version of the 'film noir' genre popular in the late 1940s Hollywood, mostly lower budget films made to feed the chains of theatres. This was mostly filmed in Canada and has many faces not usually seen in Hollywood films. It reminded me of 'Rififi', that 1950s classic that is all but forgotten. Or blacklisted?It has the usual collection of ""average"" people who live amoral lives. The husband's adultery with his sister-in-law would be shocking decades ago, but shows like ""Jerry"" flaunt these people everyday in Reality TV. People who are sleazy are tempted to betray a neighbor for a million dollars. ""Those who would sup with the devil should use a long spoon"" goes the saying. Of course something goes wrong; amateurs can't match professionals. The scheming pair pay a higher price than they demanded. The ""hero"" and ""heroine"" survive, but that is needed for a profitable film. People want to believe that some goodness gets some reward. Some people would question the realism of this action story, but ""its only a movie"".That neighborhood is shown as barren of life, or, it could be the need to rein in production costs. That scene in Chicago was the most expensive and could explain the other sparse scenes.",3,They Can Run but They Can't Hide,1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,1231,"['modern', 'version', ""'film"", 'noir', 'genre', 'popular', 'late', '1940s', 'Hollywood', 'mostly', 'lower', 'budget', 'films', 'made', 'feed', 'chains', 'theatres', 'was', 'mostly', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'many', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'reminded', ""'Rififi"", '1950s', 'classic', 'forgotten', 'blacklisted', 'usual', 'collection', 'average', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'amoral', 'lives', 'husband', 'adultery', 'sister-in-law', 'would', 'be', 'shocking', 'decades', 'ago', 'Jerry', 'flaunt', 'people', 'everyday', 'Reality', 'TV', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'sleazy', 'are', 'tempted', 'betray', 'neighbor', 'million', 'dollars', 'who', 'would', 'sup', 'devil', 'should', 'use', 'long', 'spoon', 'saying', 'course', 'something', 'wrong', 'amateurs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'professionals', 'scheming', 'pair', 'pay', 'higher', 'price', 'demanded', 'hero', 'heroine', 'survive', 'needed', 'profitable', 'film', 'People', 'want', 'believe', 'goodness', 'reward', 'people', 'would', 'question', 'realism', 'action', 'story', 'only', 'movie', '.That', 'neighborhood', 'shown', 'barren', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'need', 'rein', 'production', 'costs', 'scene', 'Chicago', 'was', 'most', 'expensive', 'could', 'explain', 'other', 'sparse', 'scenes']",Federal Protection

Overall, the movie is entertaining, but somebody really missed the opportunity for a great ending.  I won't blow it for you by describing how they missed it, but if you do watch this one you'll probably have the same perception -- something is missing at the end, but there's not enough missing to expect a sequel (not to say that they won't cobble one together).",3,"Decent plot, but very weak ending.",1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,467,"['comedy', 'Hardly', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'engaging', 'predictable', 'plot', 'Overall', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'somebody', 'really', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'great', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'describing', 'how', 'missed', 'do', 'watch', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'same', 'perception', 'something', 'missing', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'missing', 'expect', 'sequel', 'not', 'say', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cobble', 'one', 'together']",Federal Protection
699664,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B000065B0G,D. Mok,"[4, 5]","This film isn't much of an action thriller, contrary to what the cover suggests.  There's a lengthy shootout scene at the end, but most of the film is an excessive, violent, aiming-to-be-hip comedy which does draw some good laughs, but ultimately falls short of being a good film.Dina Meyer all but owns the picture.  She single-handedly drives the action, and she's clearly having a ball with the scheming, none-too-bright character.  She also supplies the film with its best scene, the seductive cat-and-mouse at the police luncheon.  It's precisely this spark that Angela Featherstone lacks -- playing the wounded housewife, Featherstone offers nothing we haven't seen before.  A shame, because she'd started her career in an array of strange roles, most memorable being Dark Angel:  The Ascent -- not the James Cameron TV show, but the Full Moon Pictures gore film.  She's become a token actress with soft eyes and elvish haircut, offering no surprises or star quality.  Armand Assante's role in the picture isn't all that large, frankly, but he does appear more confident than most of the other actors.  Too bad he and Meyer don't really have scenes together; Meyer is a much better actor than Featherstone for Assante to play opposite.There are some good sight gags -- the golf-club gag, the aforementioned police luncheon -- but some of that is negated by over-the-top violence.  Director Anthony Hickox is at fault -- what did you expect from the director of Hellraiser III?  As he deserves credit for the inventiveness of the comedic routines, so he deserves blame for the excessive gore-as-sight-gag scenes, which are never as funny as they think they are.Worth a look, but not much more.",3,"A bizarre comedy, made watchable by Meyer and Assante.",1061424000,"08 21, 2003",2003,1698,"['film', ""n't"", 'much', 'action', 'thriller', 'contrary', 'what', 'cover', 'lengthy', 'shootout', 'scene', 'end', 'most', 'film', 'excessive', 'violent', 'aiming-to-be-hip', 'comedy', 'draw', 'good', 'laughs', 'ultimately', 'short', 'being', 'good', 'film.Dina', 'Meyer', 'picture', 'single-handedly', 'action', 'clearly', 'having', 'ball', 'scheming', 'none-too-bright', 'character', 'also', 'film', 'best', 'scene', 'seductive', 'cat-and-mouse', 'police', 'luncheon', 'precisely', 'spark', 'Angela', 'Featherstone', 'playing', 'wounded', 'housewife', 'Featherstone', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'shame', ""'d"", 'started', 'career', 'array', 'strange', 'roles', 'most', 'memorable', 'being', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Ascent', 'not', 'James', 'Cameron', 'TV', 'show', 'Full', 'Moon', 'Pictures', 'gore', 'film', 'become', 'token', 'actress', 'soft', 'eyes', 'elvish', 'haircut', 'offering', 'surprises', 'star', 'quality', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'role', 'picture', ""n't"", 'large', 'frankly', 'appear', 'more', 'confident', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'Too', 'bad', 'Meyer', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'scenes', 'together', 'Meyer', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'Featherstone', 'Assante', 'play', 'are', 'good', 'sight', 'gags', 'golf-club', 'gag', 'aforementioned', 'police', 'luncheon', 'negated', 'over-the-top', 'violence', 'Director', 'Anthony', 'Hickox', 'fault', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'director', 'Hellraiser', 'III', 'credit', 'inventiveness', 'comedic', 'routines', 'blame', 'excessive', 'gore-as-sight-gag', 'scenes', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'funny', 'think', 'are.Worth', 'look', 'not', 'much', 'more']",Federal Protection
