So, I saw it, and frankly, even at that time, I felt it was overrated. Plot is nothing new, not even when it was released. All the characters are living unfulfilled lives full of lies and deceit of others and/or self. Not new. (Ever seen Gone with the Wind--made in 1937?) I think it got a great deal of attention because it was an indie talking about sex which made it to mainstream television via cable! (which itself was quite new at the time). I love almost anything with James Spader, and his Graham is a cross between creepy and seductive, depending on who you talk to about the film. The rest of the characters are well-played, but not interesting. The pacing crawls. It's an ok film, but if you expect greatness, you may want to look elsewhere, regardless of what professinal critics will tell you about it.",3,Mediocre storyline; overrated film,1302220800,"04 8, 2011",2011,998,"['When', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'cable', 'television', 'was', 'late', 'twenties', 'graduate', 'school', 'EVERYONE', 'student', 'adults', 'alike', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'most', 'amazing', 'film', 'So', 'saw', 'frankly', 'even', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'overrated', 'Plot', 'nothing', 'new', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'characters', 'are', 'living', 'unfulfilled', 'lives', 'full', 'lies', 'deceit', 'others', 'and/or', 'Not', 'new', 'Ever', 'seen', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'made', '1937', 'think', 'got', 'great', 'deal', 'attention', 'was', 'indie', 'talking', 'sex', 'made', 'mainstream', 'television', 'cable', 'was', 'quite', 'new', 'time', 'love', 'almost', 'anything', 'James', 'Spader', 'Graham', 'cross', 'creepy', 'seductive', 'depending', 'who', 'talk', 'film', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'well-played', 'not', 'interesting', 'pacing', 'crawls', 'ok', 'film', 'expect', 'greatness', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'regardless', 'what', 'professinal', 'critics', 'will', 'tell']",N/A
11178,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767812158,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","One of the smartest and all around cleverest films I've had the pleasure of ever seeing; `Sex, Lies and Videotape' is a very moving and poignant study of the effect that sex has on our lives.  Taking four individuals and placing them under scrutiny, Soderbergh's masterpiece single-handedly does what so many have attempted to do in the past; take sex out of the bedroom and place it in the living-room, where we all are forced to confront it.Be aware though, despite the films rather graphic subject, the content here within is no where near as graphic as one might expect it to be.  This is not an `adult film' but a study of adults; there is a difference.The film tells the story of unhappily married couple Ann and John Mullany.  In the opening scene we hear Ann telling her therapist that she believes John is having an affair because he no longer longs to touch her.  She has found herself distanced from him and she wonders who he is sleeping with.  The answer is Cynthia, Ann's flirtatious sister.  Cynthia and John have been sleeping with one another for some time now, and Ann has only a suspicion but no hard evidence.  The Graham walks into their lives.  Graham is John's old college roommate who stops by for an extended visit.  He brings with him his fetesh; videotape.Not what you think.Graham, being impotent, likes to videotape women talking about their fantasies and desires.  He records their most intimate of secrets and uses them later for his own fantasies.  The videotapes are a mask to hide the pain of his own failures with women, a way for him to stay guarded because commitment is something that terrifies him.  The videotape is a way for Graham to experience love and lust without ever having to give of himself and so he exploits those he knows in an attempt to salvage the humanity he has left in himself.  He is scorned and guilty and ashamed, and this plays heavily into why he feels it necessary to restrict himself of a woman's touch and rely wholly on the fantasies they cement for him on film.This movie is so much deeper than `sex', believe me.The film is elevated by some very strong performances; most notably by the female portion of the cast.  Laura San Giacomo is astonishing as the deliciously despicable Cynthia.  She oozes forth with this creamy seduction that captures her characters personality disorders marvelously.  Andie MacDowell has found the perfect film for her form of acting.  I said this before with `Four Weddings and a Funeral', where she was perfectly cast as the uninteresting girl you can't help but find interesting.  MacDowell is one of those actresses who rarely excites you; but here she manages to use that sullen demeanor to create a woman ravaged by an unidentifiable pain.  She doesn't understand why she feels so lost and so distant and it haunts her, and she bleeds that through with each passing scene.  James Spader is effectively reserved, as he is almost always, and Peter Gallagher manages not to disgust me (I really dislike this guy for the most part) but as a whole this movie belongs to the women.In the end I must recommend this movie.  Sure, it is a little rough in some scenes so don't expect a PG film here; there is a rating system for a reason, but if you can appreciate film as an art form then you will find much to appreciate here.  This is a thinking mans film for it exposes the highs and low of America's favorite pastime (okay, humanities favorite pastime) allowing us to finally understand why this `activity' is so vitally important.",5,Let's talk about sex...,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,3530,"['One', 'smartest', 'around', 'cleverest', 'films', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'very', 'moving', 'poignant', 'study', 'effect', 'sex', 'lives', 'Taking', 'four', 'individuals', 'placing', 'scrutiny', 'Soderbergh', 'masterpiece', 'single-handedly', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'attempted', 'do', 'past', 'take', 'sex', 'bedroom', 'place', 'living-room', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'it.Be', 'aware', 'films', 'rather', 'graphic', 'subject', 'content', 'here', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'graphic', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'not', 'adult', 'film', 'study', 'adults', 'difference.The', 'film', 'story', 'unhappily', 'married', 'couple', 'Ann', 'John', 'Mullany', 'opening', 'scene', 'hear', 'Ann', 'telling', 'therapist', 'John', 'having', 'affair', 'no', 'longer', 'longs', 'touch', 'found', 'distanced', 'wonders', 'who', 'sleeping', 'answer', 'Cynthia', 'Ann', 'flirtatious', 'sister', 'Cynthia', 'John', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping', 'one', 'time', 'now', 'Ann', 'only', 'suspicion', 'hard', 'evidence', 'Graham', 'walks', 'lives', 'Graham', 'John', 'old', 'college', 'roommate', 'who', 'extended', 'visit', 'fetesh', 'what', 'think.Graham', 'being', 'impotent', 'likes', 'videotape', 'women', 'talking', 'fantasies', 'desires', 'most', 'intimate', 'secrets', 'later', 'own', 'fantasies', 'videotapes', 'are', 'mask', 'hide', 'pain', 'own', 'failures', 'women', 'way', 'stay', 'guarded', 'commitment', 'something', 'videotape', 'way', 'Graham', 'experience', 'love', 'lust', 'ever', 'having', 'give', 'so', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'humanity', 'left', 'scorned', 'guilty', 'ashamed', 'heavily', 'why', 'necessary', 'restrict', 'woman', 'touch', 'rely', 'wholly', 'fantasies', 'cement', 'film.This', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'sex', 'believe', 'me.The', 'film', 'elevated', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'most', 'notably', 'female', 'portion', 'cast', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'astonishing', 'deliciously', 'despicable', 'Cynthia', 'forth', 'creamy', 'seduction', 'characters', 'personality', 'disorders', 'marvelously', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'found', 'perfect', 'film', 'form', 'acting', 'said', 'Four', 'Weddings', 'Funeral', 'where', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'uninteresting', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'find', 'interesting', 'MacDowell', 'one', 'actresses', 'who', 'rarely', 'here', 'use', 'sullen', 'demeanor', 'create', 'woman', 'ravaged', 'unidentifiable', 'pain', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'lost', 'so', 'distant', 'passing', 'scene', 'James', 'Spader', 'effectively', 'reserved', 'almost', 'always', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'not', 'disgust', 'really', 'dislike', 'guy', 'most', 'part', 'whole', 'movie', 'women.In', 'end', 'must', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Sure', 'little', 'rough', 'scenes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'PG', 'film', 'here', 'rating', 'system', 'reason', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'art', 'form', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'appreciate', 'here', 'thinking', 'mans', 'film', 'highs', 'low', 'America', 'favorite', 'pastime', 'okay', 'humanities', 'favorite', 'pastime', 'allowing', 'finally', 'understand', 'why', 'activity', 'so', 'vitally', 'important']",N/A

Starting off slow while slowly building up the depth of the characters, it begins to revolve around one man, Graham Dalton played superbly by James Spader, and then the conflict explodes in a climatic ending. Steve Soderberg keeps his direction taut and focused on the four primary players while trying to let the characters evolve and become the people with real problems. It's interesting how the conflicts of each player are intertwined with others, and then they become connected. The performances are outstanding: James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher, and Laura San Giacomo. It's funny that I would see James Spader's character to be dark and mysterious, but in the end, he is just an ordinary person; however, not as mysterious as Mickey Rourke's John of 9  Weeks. What makes Sex, Lies, and Videotape to work and achieve its accolades is the simplicity of the picture.10/10: The sensual energy is what sustains the momentum for Sex, Lies, and Videotape that never lets down. The performances by James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher, and Laura San Giacomo are throughly excellent and flawless. What I loved about the film the most is how James Spader's performance affected everybody else around him and how his character is the focal point even though he has a small but important role. This was a very small, low-key type of a picture, but the way Steven Soderbergh executed it...that was just brilliant. It was also his first full-length picture. So kudos for him. Of course, the title is misleading, making the audience think it might entail some nude scenes, but the film actually never did a second of it. That is what was so brilliant about the film: the sexual feelings and the romanticism aspect of it yet no actual viewing of naked people. Other films will do the obvious and still fail to be a sexy picture. All in all, Sex, Lies, and Videotape is easily the best film of everybody's career and remains one of the best films I've ever seen.",5,Sexually Entertaining Buoyed by Flawless Performances.,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,2071,"['Viewed', '7/03', '12/04', '2/07', '10/10Rate', '102/07', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'small', 'masterpiece', 'Starting', 'off', 'slow', 'slowly', 'building', 'up', 'depth', 'characters', 'revolve', 'around', 'one', 'man', 'Graham', 'Dalton', 'played', 'superbly', 'James', 'Spader', 'then', 'conflict', 'climatic', 'ending', 'Steve', 'Soderberg', 'direction', 'taut', 'focused', 'four', 'primary', 'players', 'trying', 'let', 'characters', 'evolve', 'become', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'interesting', 'how', 'conflicts', 'player', 'are', 'intertwined', 'others', 'then', 'become', 'connected', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'James', 'Spader', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'funny', 'would', 'see', 'James', 'Spader', 'character', 'be', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'end', 'just', 'ordinary', 'person', 'however', 'not', 'as', 'mysterious', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'John', '9', 'Weeks', 'What', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'work', 'achieve', 'accolades', 'simplicity', 'picture.10/10', 'sensual', 'energy', 'what', 'momentum', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'never', 'down', 'performances', 'James', 'Spader', 'Andie', 'MacDowell', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'are', 'throughly', 'excellent', 'flawless', 'What', 'loved', 'film', 'most', 'how', 'James', 'Spader', 'performance', 'affected', 'everybody', 'else', 'how', 'character', 'focal', 'point', 'even', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'small', 'low-key', 'type', 'picture', 'way', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'executed', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'full-length', 'picture', 'So', 'kudos', 'course', 'title', 'misleading', 'making', 'audience', 'think', 'might', 'entail', 'nude', 'scenes', 'film', 'actually', 'never', 'did', 'second', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'brilliant', 'film', 'sexual', 'feelings', 'romanticism', 'aspect', 'yet', 'actual', 'viewing', 'naked', 'people', 'Other', 'films', 'will', 'do', 'obvious', 'still', 'fail', 'be', 'sexy', 'picture', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'everybody', 'career', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

The marriage lacks any sparks plus the fact that John is having sex on a regular basis with Ann's sister, Cynthia, played by Laura San Giacomo.John is a lawyer moving up the ladder, Ann consults her therapist regularly, with whom she discusses her lack of interest in sex and compulsive ways. Cynthia tends bar at some dive with one regular customer that gets on Ann's nerves.One day an old college buddy of John's appears wanting to face his past and find a place in town to live for an unspecified period of time. Graham is played by James Spader and spends a night or two at Ann and John's place before apartment hunting.While John sends Ann off to look at apartments with Graham, he calls Cynthia for a quick romp before heading to the office. There is an interesting scene in a restaurant with Graham and Ann afterwards where the topic turns to sex. For some reason Graham confides in Ann that he is impotent.What I found funny is the number of times Ann and Cynthia are talking on the phone and then Cynthia and John planning their next tryst. Once Graham moves into town the talk between these three at separate times is based on what they know and want to know about Graham.Each time Cynthia and John are together it becomes apparent that once the sex is over Cynthia wants him gone. They really have nothing in common but the sex is intense after Cynthia relays the videotaping incident.It sure looked like Cynthia spent more time with Ann and John separately than Ann and John were together. I did not see why they were even married in the first place. Ann seemed to be attracted to Graham in an off sort of way.The ending left gaps for me because the sisters discussed their Mother's birthday and I did not see the significance of this discussion. The drunk in the bar got on my nerves always saying the same thing. I could not tell what line of work Ann was interested in pursuing or involved in.I still sat glued to my couch watching Sex, Lies and Videotape wanting to see something that never came to light. I hoped that Ann and Graham would connect because I never saw a relationship between her and John. The sisters had a bond but also were jealous of what the other had. Graham mentioned spending nine years structuring his life, which was not really explained.It was an interesting movie that was on the dark side with sexual undertones but never showing anything sexual but the language was of adult matter.

This  film tells the story of Graham (James Spader), a minimalist anti-yuppi, who  goes back to his home town and stays with his long  lost college buddy John  (Peter Gallagher) who has become a lawyer and Ann (Ande MacDowell) his  eccentric but conservative wife. John is a bit repelled by Graham's  free-spirited honesty and liberalism, but it is intruiging to Ann... until  Graham reveals to her that he is more-or-less impotent, and tapes women  talking about sex to get off. John is having an  affair with Ann's sister  Cynthia (Laura San Giamoco) a sexually aggresive bartender, who is informed  of Graham's indulgent practice and takes part in a &quot;taping&quot;,  which puts all four characters in a landslide of events. Ingeneously  crafted by first-time director Steven Soderberg, this film was the sleeper  hit of 1989, and probably the year's best film too. The performances are  superb all around, and are backed by an excellent script. Though not a  highly technical film, this film has some neat camera tricks to  offer.The DVD of &quot;sex, lies, and video&quot; has only one extra  feature worth metioning besides the theatrical trailer. That is the feature  length commentary by the film's director Steven Soderberg, who is  interviewed during the film by Niel LaBute, the director of &quot;In the  Company of Men&quot;. Better than most commentaries, the director discusses  the preproduction of the film and his experience with the actors, rather  than the technical aspects.This DVD is a great addition to anyone's  video library.",5,"sex, lies, and videotape on DVD",965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1692,"['quot', 'sex', 'videotape', 'quot', 'well-crafted', 'little', 'gem', 'adultery', 'sexual', 'perversion', 'value', 'honesty', 'film', 'story', 'Graham', 'James', 'Spader', 'minimalist', 'anti-yuppi', 'who', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'stays', 'long', 'lost', 'college', 'buddy', 'John', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'become', 'lawyer', 'Ann', 'Ande', 'MacDowell', 'eccentric', 'conservative', 'wife', 'John', 'bit', 'repelled', 'Graham', 'free-spirited', 'honesty', 'liberalism', 'intruiging', 'Ann', 'Graham', 'reveals', 'more-or-less', 'impotent', 'tapes', 'women', 'talking', 'sex', 'get', 'off', 'John', 'having', 'affair', 'Ann', 'sister', 'Cynthia', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giamoco', 'sexually', 'aggresive', 'bartender', 'who', 'informed', 'Graham', 'indulgent', 'practice', 'part', 'quot', 'taping', 'quot', 'four', 'characters', 'landslide', 'events', 'Ingeneously', 'crafted', 'first-time', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'film', 'was', 'sleeper', 'hit', '1989', 'probably', 'year', 'best', 'film', 'too', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'backed', 'excellent', 'script', 'not', 'highly', 'technical', 'film', 'film', 'neat', 'camera', 'tricks', 'offer.The', 'DVD', 'quot', 'sex', 'video', 'quot', 'only', 'one', 'extra', 'feature', 'metioning', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'feature', 'length', 'commentary', 'film', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderberg', 'who', 'interviewed', 'film', 'Niel', 'LaBute', 'director', 'quot', 'Company', 'Men', 'quot', 'Better', 'most', 'commentaries', 'director', 'preproduction', 'film', 'experience', 'actors', 'rather', 'technical', 'aspects.This', 'DVD', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'video', 'library']",N/A
11187,A3I7EHVQ4AAKFV,0767812158,"Christina ""Lisa""","[9, 9]","I keep thinking about Hitchcock's Notorious everytime I watch Sex, Lies & Videotape. With a different plot and genre, both masterful films tell the story of all the lies that veil people from the truth.  Visually, they give us clues or icons.  A key is not just a key, and a houseplant is not just a houseplant. The line about villains being the heroes in their own imagination could easily explain the thrust of not just the cheating husband but even the more morally appealing characters.  The trick is how the drama changes or doesn't change people.Stylistically, it is very sparse but frugal. The cast and cameras make the most of what they have. Gallagher spins John's wedding ring and wears a queen's ivy. McDowell blushes and laughs as Ann. Spader lays Graham open to disarming vulnerability. San Giancomo asserts Cynthia's chin and takes up another challenge in her rivalry with her sister, Soderbergh?s camera doesn't waste any of it.  McDowell and San Giancomo act like sisters. Even the videocamera and television take on semblance of character. (Compare Hitchcock?s use of doors dramatically shutting and the video ending in tv snow. It is the same finality.) The barfly cracks me up with his improvised drunken wooing. It is welcome comic relief and accents a very subtle charm in the drama and comedy bundled together.In his commentary with a fellow director on this DVD, Soderbergh makes all sorts of references to other filmmakers.  I was disappointed, at first, that he didn't mention Notorious but reveled that we viewers bring something to the to the table on our own.  Film may seem like a passive media, but it ain't.",5,"""Did anybody touch anybody""",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,1638,"['keep', 'thinking', 'Hitchcock', 'Notorious', 'everytime', 'watch', 'Sex', 'Lies', 'Videotape', 'different', 'plot', 'genre', 'masterful', 'films', 'tell', 'story', 'lies', 'veil', 'people', 'truth', 'Visually', 'give', 'clues', 'icons', 'key', 'not', 'just', 'key', 'houseplant', 'not', 'just', 'houseplant', 'line', 'villains', 'being', 'heroes', 'own', 'imagination', 'could', 'easily', 'explain', 'thrust', 'not', 'just', 'cheating', 'husband', 'even', 'more', 'morally', 'appealing', 'characters', 'trick', 'how', 'drama', 'changes', ""n't"", 'change', 'people.Stylistically', 'very', 'sparse', 'frugal', 'cast', 'cameras', 'make', 'most', 'what', 'have', 'Gallagher', 'John', 'wedding', 'ring', 'queen', 'ivy', 'McDowell', 'blushes', 'Ann', 'Spader', 'Graham', 'open', 'disarming', 'vulnerability', 'San', 'Giancomo', 'Cynthia', 'chin', 'up', 'challenge', 'rivalry', 'sister', 'Soderbergh', 's', 'camera', ""n't"", 'waste', 'McDowell', 'San', 'Giancomo', 'act', 'sisters', 'Even', 'videocamera', 'television', 'take', 'semblance', 'character', 'Compare', 'Hitchcock', 's', 'use', 'doors', 'dramatically', 'shutting', 'video', 'ending', 'tv', 'snow', 'same', 'finality', 'barfly', 'cracks', 'up', 'improvised', 'drunken', 'wooing', 'welcome', 'comic', 'relief', 'very', 'subtle', 'charm', 'drama', 'comedy', 'bundled', 'together.In', 'commentary', 'fellow', 'director', 'DVD', 'Soderbergh', 'sorts', 'references', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'disappointed', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'Notorious', 'reveled', 'viewers', 'bring', 'something', 'table', 'own', 'Film', 'may', 'seem', 'passive', 'media', 'ai', ""n't""]",N/A

11189,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767812158,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[11, 11]","In 1988, an independent film directed by newcomer Steve Soderbergh (who would go on to direct the films ""Erin Bockovich"", ""Traffic"", ""Oceans Twelve"", etc.) would achieve prominence as the film was the spark that helped revolutionize the independent film movement in the 1990's.  Winner of the Palme D'or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, winner of the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, the indie film would also earn a nomination for an Academy Award and would be the beginning of a long, prosperous career for Steve Soderbergh but also the four main talents of the film: James Spader (""Stargate"", ""Boston Legal"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""White Palace""), Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"", ""Hudson Hawk"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""), Laura San Giacomo (""Pretty Woman"", ""Just Shoot Me"", ""Saving Grace"") and Peter Gallagher (""The OC"", ""Short Cuts"", ""Californication"").The film which cost about a million dollars to make, went on to receive critical success and earn $24 million in the box office.  ""sex, lies, and videotape"" became a big hit for independent film studio Miramax Films and the film was selected and preserved by the United States National Film Registry in 2006 as a film that is ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" and in 2009, to celebrate the film's 20th year anniversary, ""sex, lies and videotape"" receives its first High Definition Blu-ray release.VIDEO & AUDIO:""sex, lies, and videotape"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, the picture quality has a fine layer of grain but also shows quite a bit of detail as we can see the skin pores of Andie McDowell.  You can see the details of the characters quite clearly.  The transfer is not perfect as I did see a few instances of dirt and even artifacting.  But I have to admit that this is the best I've seen of the film compared to its Criterion Collection LD and DVD counterpart.As for the transfer, the same Interpositive Element from the original 35mm Camera negative which was used in the 1988 DVD was scanned 4K DPX Files, as a potential source for future remastering.  The 2K files were color timed at Technicolor using the 1998 transfer as a color reference.  Also, a substantial amount of dirt was cleaned up utilizing version 7 of MTI DRS and splice bump correction using Autodesk Inferno.The audio of the film is presented in English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The sound although lossless sounds very good.  Dialogue is clear and understandable but at the same time, audio doesn't utilize the surround channels as much as I was hoping for it too.  But this is explained through the restoration special feature that Soderbergh felt it important to present this film with its original 1989 mix.  The goal of the audio restoration was to remove any snap and pops throughout the film but focusing on audio being a front and center channel for ""sex, lies and videotape"" and minimal utilization of subwoofers and surrounds.Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""sex, lies, and videotape"" comes with several special features new and old (some from the original Criterion Collection LD release) and are featured in High Definition or Standard Definition and in English Stereo.* Movie IQ - Real-time movie information about the cast, crew, music and production via BD-Live.* Commentary with Writer/Director Steven Soderbergh and Neil LaBute - A very good commentary that filmmakers and commentary fans will definitely enjoy.  From the setup of a scene and learning from Soderbergh about his mindset of what he wanted to accomplish for the film plus  comparisons to an Eric Rohmer film.* 20 Year Reunion at the Sundance Film Festival - (3:26) Featuring Steven Soderbergh, Peter Gallagher, Andie McDowell and Laura San Giacomo for a reunion 20 years later at the Sundance Film Festival.  The group fields questions from the audience and more.* Deleted Scene with Optional Commentary- (3:26) Director Steven Soderbergh sets up a deleted scene featuring Ann (McDowell) with her therapist.* Steven Soderbergh on ""sex, lies and videotape"" trailers - (4:40) Director Soderbergh talks about shooting the theatrical trailer for the film.  View Soderbergh's trailer and the Miramax trailer.* Steven Soderbergh on ""sex, lies and videotape"" - (8:22)  Soderbergh talks about his influences in creating the film.  About not utilizing nudity in the film and more.* Notes on Remastering and Restoration - Text info. on what was digitally restores for the Blu-ray release.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""sex, lies and videotape"" was released, I can remember that I was thinking that this would be a bold film that showcased a lot of nudity. Of course, the film is not anything like that.  But I felt that watching it now 20 years later versus watching it when I was in my teens, I felt that I have much more appreciation for the film more now than ever.Soderbergh has went on to create many wonderful films since ""sex, lies and videotape"" but what has captured my attention about this film is his how he kept the film simple and concentrated on the details around the four characters.  He mentions in the commentary of his influence of Eric Rohmer (who created the popular films as part of his ""Six Moral Tales"") and the long dialogue between characters.  Maybe it made no impression to me back then but now, any director who can have their characters engage in dialogue with meaning and profoundness is wonderful.Andie MacDowell was the surprising star because in the beginning, I thought she would be the typical jilted housewife but we see her character emerge as one that is confused to one that finally gains perspective.  Laura San Giacomo did well in portraying the free-will Cynthia (which she would go on to do again in ""Pretty Woman""), John Mullany (Peter Gallagher) was the ultimate sleezeball and for Graham (Spader), his character was mysterious and although the viewer doesn't know exactly what had happen to him, it's how the character was changed after changing the character he videotaped.As the film itself, one can see how this independent film helped revolutionize indie films and allowing media coverage.  Sure, we see independent films, arthouse films receive media coverage today but in the context of independent films getting seen by a wide audience, ""sex, lies, and videotape"" was definitely instrumental in being part of that small group of films that Hollywood would give a chance to.  And of course,  without this film, we wouldn't have awesome films by Steven Soderbergh such as ""Erin Brokovich"", ""Traffic"", ""Out of Sight"", ""The Good German"", ""Che"" and ""Schizopolis"" (although we can leave Soderbergh's ""Oceans"" films out of the list).As for the Blu-ray release, this is the best the film has ever looked and the restoration was definitely important for this 20th Anniversary release.  The only problem that I have with this release is that if they were going to show that 20th Anniversary reunion, why not show the entire Q&A; session?  They show bits and pieces of it and that is my main peeve of this release.  We are seeing more and more films given the anniversary treatment on Blu-ray with the reunion Q&A; sessions featured in its entirety, I would have loved to see this Q&A; at Sundance in full.  Also, some of the features are from the original Criterion Collection LD from nearly 20 years ago, so quality is not exactly that great.  But nevertheless, it was good to see Sony include that on this Blu-ray release.Overall, for those who enjoyed the film or Soderbergh's work will definitely want to add ""sex, lies and videotape"" to their Blu-ray collection.  Although the film was once a Criterion Collection release (on LD), it was great to see this release have almost a Criterion feel with is restoration technique explanation and also amateur filmmakers will enjoy Soderbergh's audio commentary as well.  Definitely a solid Blu-ray release worth owning!",5,"Blu-ray: Very solid blu-ray release, older Criterion interviews included plus 20th anniversary reunion",1258502400,"11 18,

11191,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,0767812158,Doreen Appleton,"[3, 3]","I always watch this magnificent movie through earphones because the background sound used by Soderbergh is so exquisite.sex, lies was the first independent film to equal or surpass the production values of Hollywood movies. The cinematography (Soderbergh was the film editor), the stereo sound, are spectacular.The film includes many riches and rewards. To mention a few:One thing I've always noticed is that John and Cynthia have similar features. They both have black hair, thick eyebrows, wide-set eyes, and a faintly reptilian appearance. Whether this was a conscious casting decision by Soderbergh one can only speculate. Perhaps not, since the film was made on such a low budget.Soderbergh sometimes joins two scenes by a word or a phrase. ""Can I ask you something personal?"", asked by Ann in the restaurant, is repeated by Cynthia to John. Later, when Ann says to John ""You never used to say f...,"" this is the first word of John's speech to Cynthia in the following scene.Another thing I've always noticed and admired is that Soderberg's camera is always moving just a bit to the left or to the right. The scenes are never static. This personal quirk adds style and depth to our viewing experience.Some of the dialogue between Ann and Graham toward the end doesn't make much sense to me (except when she tells him ""Your problems are not yours only. You've had an effect on my life. I'm divorcing my husband, and maybe I would have anyway, but I'm doing it sooner because of you.""), and I have a problem with Graham ending up with a neurotic suburban conformist like Ann. But the fact that sisterhood triumphs over Cynthia's infidelity with Ann's husband is a fine irony.Unlike Tom Buchanan in THE GREAT GATSBY, who ends up with Daisy and his money while Gatsby dies, John Mullaney loses both his women and his job. Clearly Soderbergh was preparing for this throughout the movie.A masterpiece by a 26-year-old filmmaker, to be compared to REPULSION by a 28-year old Roman Polanski. In my opinion Soderbergh never matched this level of inspiration in his later films. Neither did Andie McDowell nor Laura San Giacomo.

Only later I found out that Sodebergh was 29 when he wrote the screenplay in eight days during a trip to Los Angeles and made the film for $1.8 million. His independent movie was a real hit that was selected for Cannes Film Festival and won the Palme d'Or and the best actor prize for James Spader.The film concerns four attractive and intelligent young people.  Ann (Andy MacDowell in the best role I've ever seen her) is married to John (Gallagher) but their sexual life is practically non-existent since Ann finds sex over-rated, and to simply put it, she does not enjoy or even need it. John is having an affair with Ann's sexy younger sister, Cynthia (San Giacomo) who seems to resent Ann. Enters Graham (Spader), John's college friend with the unusual hobby of videotaping women while they describe their sexual fantasies and very important skill - he knows how to listen.I had seen many movies before ""sex, lies and videotape"" and I've seen plenty since but it has a special place in my memory. It was the first film I had seen that dealt with and talked about very intimate topics of sexuality, satisfaction, jealousy, sisters' relationship, marital problems and loyalty, the secret longings in all of us, and the ever mysterious nature of erotic desire with such level of honesty, openness, and intelligence.

I sat down with the intention of only watching the first half hour and ended up watching it all in one sitting because I just couldn't bring myself to press stop.

11195,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,0767812158,Hillary,"[12, 16]","This quietly riveting, intellectually stimulating masterpiece of erotic drama put the now famous director Steven Soderbergh on the Hollywood map. Rightfully so, as it's four central characters pull you into an intriguing plotline filled with just what the appropriate title has promised.John, played by uni-brow actor Peter Gallagher in a low-brow performance, is a career minded, self-centered lawyer married to uptight southern girl Ann (Andie MacDowell). Ann has a flaky and sexually liberated sister named Cynthia, ""Just Shoot Me"" alum Laura San Giacomo. What Ann DOESN'T know, is how she is being mocked and scorned by both her husband, and her sister as they secretly meet for torrid, forbidden sexual encounters. Cynthia takes a perverse pleasure in this duplicity, especially in her sisters bed.  The disregard these two have for those who are affected by their affair is shamelessly cruel.  I really dislike Gallagher's John, which means he plays his role well.The games begin when Graham, an old collegiate buddy of John's, comes to town for a visit. Graham is wonderfully played by the incredible James Spader, a personal favorite of mine. Graham has a bit of a problem though, he's impotent.  (Now, I must say, Spader playing an impotent character is a bit of a reach, but I'm not complaining!)  The only way he can be gratified sexually, is by videotaping women talking about their personal sexual experiences, hence the third item in the film title.As I said, the movie is quietly fascinating. One of the oddest things about it, is the complete LACK of any sort of musical score within. It seems to draw you into the plot even more, since there's little else to distract ones attention.I like Spader's character the best, not just because I'm partial to the actor, but because he played the most complex and interesting character. He is also at his sexiest here, all dressed in black shirt, jeans, and his blonde hair longish and VERY sexy. His impotence in the movie, is like a companion to Andie MacDowell's Ann characters frigidity. Together, they find a way to overcome the deceit around them.This is an unusual film, controversial in its time, but rather tame by todays standard fare. It's a good choice when you're in the mood for a little food for thought, or a quiet relaxing movie experience. I say this because you have to be in the mood for this sort of film.

These people all have problems with relating to other people but Anne and Graham do finally manage to get together(because of Anne's persistence) and experience sex together.

11199,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,0767812158,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[3, 3]","Steven Soderbergh and James Spader initiated my immediate interest in this film as Soderbergh's emotionally engaging techniques as a director never falls short of amazement; his characters are usually rich and very complex which enables him to invoke a sense of familiarity and impeccable plausibility to his audience. I have been a fan of James Spader's work especially in the 80's and was quite intrigued in this unusual role he plays for Sex Lies and VideoTape. The calm and appropriate setting that SoderBergh intentionally chooses for this film as well as his emphasis on character development will truly immerse and retain most of the audience's attention span. In respect to plot and character development I always prefer the latter to be richer and more carefully crafted.Anne Bishop Mullany played by a very passive and quite attractive (Andy Macdowell) is a recent and fairly converted housewife. From the get go we get a sense of who Anne Mullany is through her therapy session. Our quick glimpse into her therapy session manifests how truly bored and empty Mullany's life is as her incessant trepidation about very mundane problems such as the onslaught of endless human garbage and world starvation impede and trap this woman's ability to truly focus on herself or more importantly her role in society.Her character is further exposed when she reveals more personal information regarding her sex life with her husband John. (Peter Gallagher) According to Anne, her sex life has truly waned in the sense that she has physically lost any remaining sexual attraction to John. Moreover, she reveals that she has no desire to touch him in bed and that she never was the ""sexual initiator"" even when she was attracted. Her therapist begins to ask her some rather probing questions about her sexual feelings and gradually touches upon the act of masturbation. Anne's reaction is quite interesting as she emit's a very childish and retrained response stammering with a facetiously and giggling tone, ""Sex is stupid"" and that ""I once tried to attempt masturbation but with no success"".  Her reaction suggests as if she attempted it out of sheer humor or for kicks. Her response also implies to us and the therapist that she acted upon this fairly recently; and, when her therapist picks up on this and further reconfirms her answer her face becomes distorted and looks unsettling; she looks uncomfortable and changes the subject. Her session gradually ends by voluntarily expressing her annoyance of her husband's failure to warn her sooner about his past time friend, Graham (James Spader), an old college buddy, who is going to be staying with them for a few days.It is during Anne Mullany's therapy session where Steven Soderbergh cleverly uses the technique of parallel editing to convey an unfulfilled relationship as he is seen cheating on Anne with her younger sister, Cynthia.John, a young up and coming lawyer, who is not only trying to manage his demanding and burdensome client schedule but also trying to manage his affair with Cynthia as well, is not too successful at it. His frequent and yet brief escapades enable John to cope with stress and fulfill his lackluster sex life with Anne. John and Cynthia's frequent and carefully planned escapades inevitably lead Anne to suspicion.Cynthia, Anne's younger sister, is quite the opposite of Anne in every possible way; she is a loud, candid extrovert who is not in the least bit timid on the topic of sex either. She also seems to thoroughly enjoy how Anne reacts to her attitude and behavior.  Her subsequent affair with John truly belittles and demeans Anne's marriage; moreover, it merely reduces it to a simple ""non-attached fling"" which is something quite similar and more appropriate you would find in Cynthia occupation of bartending. Cynthia's lack of guilt respect and compassion towards Anne and her marriage only reinforce this concept further. On a more important note, she doesn't even seem really interested neither in John's personality nor of his potential qualities or lack thereof. Cynthia seems to only enjoy the secrecy aspect of the affair as John comes and goes like a common cold.My favorite character and one of the more complex as well is Graham Dalton (James Spader) who is a highly unusual, soft-spoken analytical and quite reticent as his inner feelings are admittedly expressed non-verbally. His strange innocent and yet probing questions lure Anne's attention immediately upon his arrival. With in a few minutes of his arrival Graham is sitting down asking Anne about her marriage particularly on how and why she likes this new lifestyle. Anne's answers to these questions further reveal her profound emptiness and lost sense of identity when she only mentions a few materialistic possessions such as the nice house they live in and the security of John's career.  After their initial encounter, we find Anne becoming more drawn to Graham when she protects him from the claws of her feisty younger sister, or when she stares at him sleeping on the couch with a sort of curiosity and engaging interest. We also get a sense of Anne's attraction to him when she opens up to her therapist about his unexpectedly unusual personality that is so far different from her husbands that in a way is alleviating to her.The interaction between these four characters is quite mesmerizing and very complex. James Spader's and Andy MacDowell's character interaction is by far the most interesting and multifaceted. The way they challenge and react to each other's body language is enough to at least invoke some sense of enjoyment and curiosity from this film.  Personally I enjoyed the heavy social commentary that sheds light on the troubles of flawed characters in modern relationships. Ironically, all of these characters do have something in common after all, and that is through their carefully self-constructed mental prisons that they built for themselves in society; Graham is still haunted by a previous and apparently unsuccessful relationship with a woman named Elizabeth, and this still has a profound affect on Graham's life. Moreover, his apprehensiveness to engage in future relationships not only prevents him from making forward progress but also isolates him from other women.Anne's inability to feel sexual attraction with her husband or to any other potential male completely dominates her life and this is particularly evident in her unproductive therapy sessions. We are not really sure how long Anne and John have been married nor are we aware of how long he has been in an affair. We are also not aware of how long Anne has been in therapy either. However, it is safe to assume that Anne's dissatisfaction as a wife and place in society has been pestering her long enough.John, who is according to Graham the lowest form of human life: A lying lawyer. John struggles to become a successful lover or a husband for that matter in every possible aspect; he is not honest in the least bit as he openly and blatantly lies to his wife in a very poor manner too.  It is also revealed later that John also cheated with Grahman's former girlfriend Elizabeth. It seems as though John's life was and is still completely dominated by short-term non-attached flings. It is also revealed how John struggles to cope with this pattern of behavior when we see him get tossed like a bad habit in Cynthia's apartment.Cynthia's poor attempt to become emotionally attached to any male is pathetic to say the very least. Her affair with John along with her attempt to seduce Graham manifests her inability to have a long-term relationship. In a sense this is empowering to her.Most importantly, it is through these interactions that enable us to see how these characters center their entire lives on their insecurities. In a much larger sense, this flaw prevents them from fulfilling their roles as wife, a husband, a potential lover and a sister. SoderBergh is nothing short of excellent in his debut film; his deceptive vocal recording along with his stylistic editing is very impressive and intriguing. More impressive, are his carefully crafted characters that are acted flawlessly throughout the film.For a low-budget indie film that takes us back to 1989 this film is completely restored and re-mastered of the highest and most accurate quality. Although I have never seen the dvd I think it is safe to assume that this Blu Ray transfer is probably the far superior format that this picture is ever going to look, end of story; colors look completely natural which produce a strong feel of vibrancy particularly during some of the exterior shots of Graham's apartment and Anne's house. Flesh tones are fairly consistent throughout exhibiting a very subtle and appropriate level of softness during the interior shots. Detail is not extraordinary but is still impressive no less and that is because of the film's age. The gentle and subtle layer of grain prevalent throughout the film will not displease Blu-Ray fans or technical critics either as it is able to retain the indie appearance of the film without discrediting the superb transfer. In respect to sound, don't look for a jaw-dropping Dobly TrueHD 5.1 immersing surround sound experience either, because this is a drama film that centers around dialogue and a soft-haunting soundtrack composed by the brilliant Cliff Martinez. The majority of your speakers will be dominated by your center-channel and left-right speakers. This is not a disappointment in the least bit either as Martinez's deep and haunting soundtrack will easily satisfy it's audience because it contributes to the mood and atmosphere of the various characters inner thoughts and feelings. The dialogue is very crisp and is immune to any distracting pops or crackles. Overall, this is quite an impressive and excellent Blu-Ray transfer.",5,Blu Ray Review: A personally engaging director with a stellar cast and a profoundly haunting score,1266019200,"02 13,

This movie, his first, is written and directed by the Oscar winner (Best Director, 'Traffic') and it's one of my favorite movies by him. I think it's better than both Traffic and Erin Brockovich. The only Soderbergh film I've seen that I like more is Out of Sight. This movie is funny, interesting, intriguing, and very entertaining. I thought there was one downside to the movie...No nudity. The whole time I was watching this movie, everytime Laura San Giacomo was onscreen I was thinking ""Take off your shirt."" But, I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie stars Peter Gallagher (""American Beauty"") and Andie McDowell (""Michael"") as a married couple John and Ann. Ann is a stay at home wife, who secretly attends therapy sessions where she confesses her relationship with John isn't much and that they don't have sex. Meanwhile, John (a lawyer) is having sex with Ann's sister Cynthia (Giacomo). At the same time, an old friend of John's named Graham (James Spader in one of his best performances) arrives at their house to stay for a few days until he gets on his feet. Ann is drawn to Graham and finds him interesting, but her opinion is changed when she finds out that Graham interviews woman and asks them personal questions about their sex lives while filming the entire thing. After hearing about this, however, Cynthia takes an interest in Graham. It's basically just one big love triangle. But, this movie is truly a fantastic and extremely interesting film. Soderbergh brings up really interesting points about everything from love to sex to marriage to impotency. The score by Cliff Martinez also helps to move the film along perfectly.GRADE: A-",5,Interesting,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,1761,"['already', 'knew', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'was', 'talented', 'director', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'had', 'written', 'movie', 'first', 'written', 'directed', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Best', 'Director', ""'Traffic"", 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'think', 'better', 'Traffic', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'only', 'Soderbergh', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'like', 'more', 'Out', 'Sight', 'movie', 'funny', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'downside', 'movie', 'nudity', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'everytime', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'was', 'onscreen', 'was', 'thinking', 'Take', 'off', 'shirt', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'movie', 'stars', 'Peter', 'Gallagher', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Andie', 'McDowell', 'Michael', 'married', 'couple', 'John', 'Ann', 'Ann', 'stay', 'home', 'wife', 'who', 'secretly', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'where', 'relationship', 'John', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sex', 'Meanwhile', 'John', 'lawyer', 'having', 'sex', 'Ann', 'sister', 'Cynthia', 'Giacomo', 'same', 'time', 'old', 'friend', 'John', 'named', 'Graham', 'James', 'Spader', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'house', 'stay', 'few', 'days', 'feet', 'Ann', 'drawn', 'Graham', 'interesting', 'opinion', 'changed', 'when', 'out', 'Graham', 'interviews', 'woman', 'personal', 'questions', 'sex', 'lives', 'filming', 'entire', 'thing', 'hearing', 'however', 'Cynthia', 'interest', 'Graham', 'basically', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'love', 'triangle', 'movie', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'up', 'really', 'interesting', 'points', 'everything', 'love', 'sex', 'marriage', 'impotency', 'score', 'Cliff', 'Martinez', 'also', 'move', 'film', 'perfectly.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Just ask Graham (James Spader), who is impotent, but  rather than concealing the fact with shame, he discusses it with his  friend's wife (Andie MacDowell), with the same comfort and truth that he  has seen in his several interviews with women.  Entering into three private  lives, Graham becomes an audience to a wife's paranoia and inhibition, a  husband's infedility and dishonesty, and a sister's shallow standards and  immaturity.

Still, this talky little film -- far more European than American -- seduces its audience with its gentle tales about people, their sexuality and, ultimately, their views of their own lives.What I found most remarkable watching this film 16 years after its release is how potent is the ""videotape"" message in an era when people have trashed their video technology. Second most remarkable is how little Andie McDowell has aged in more than a decade and a half. The woman must have some of nature's best genes or one of Hollywood's best surgeons!If you've never seen this talkfest, it involves the reunion of two old friends, nine years apart, that ignites a fuse of passion, understanding and exposure of lies, sex and emotions that distrubs the life of the four main participants -- a man, his disturbed wife, his mistress and the friend. These discoveries all revolve around the friend's impotence and its replacement, his involvement with videotape.The aura of this film most reminds me of ""The Swimming Pool"", a more recent entrant in the drama-sexuality sweepstakes with an equally European feel. That movie was European, of course, but shares an aura and similar cinematic likeness to this one. While ""sex, lies & videotape"" is no mystery, it arrives at conclusions similar to those in ""The Swimming Pool"".So watch this little movie to see how something seemingly based in yesterday's technolgoy can be germane to a new era of techheads.

This low-budget film captured a wide audience and a large box office.  It's a seemingly simple film, but it makes an important statement.  Basically, it demonstrates that our most erogenous zone is the mind.  And it is the conversation, rather than the act itself where eroticism lies.The story is about four modern people, all with relationship problems.  Andie MacDowell is a frigid wife.  Peter Gallager is her lawyer husband who cheats on her with her own sister, Laura San Giacomo.  And James Spader is the husband's friend Graham, who, because of his own dysfunctional needs, can only get aroused one way - by watching videotapes of women talking about their erotic life.  Otherwise, he's impotent in a real life situation.I found this film slow and talky but it was also intriguing.  It goes deeper than the surface and I was fascinated by its creativity.  And it uses the medium of videotape to do it all.  This, of course was filmed before the Internet, cell phones and even DVDs.  And so there is a certain datedness to it.  But yet it deals with some universal truths.  And a willingness to explore the lies.  I enjoyed it but it's more for film buffs than a general audience.

Add to this a wild card, Ann's sister Cynthia (Laura San Giancomo) who happens to be having an affair with John.Graham has intimacy issues and gets around them by videotaping women talking about sex lives and fantasies.  Cynthia is a free spirit and wants all men to desire her.  She comes on strong to Graham who takes advantage and adds her videotape to his collection.  To Graham, the prize is the prim and proper Ann.  Like Graham, Ann is also emotionally repressed.  But after a while she opens up and creates a videotape of her own.This experience not only changes her life but Graham's too.Soderbergh has created a fine film that explores the human soul with stunning performance all around.  Spader was better known as part of the Brat Pack and totally redefined his persona with this film - unfortunately he has never been given a chance to show his abilities again.

It's about the possibility of connection, of making contact, and of taking responsibility for the impact of one's life upon another.  Mere ""sex"" becomes a surrogate for intimacy, what we search for when we are unable to be honest with ourselves and our significant others and acknowledge that our self is bound up with these others.  Mere ""sex"" - as in the ""casual"" fling John carries on with his wife Ann's sister - is then a lie, in a double sense: it has him cheating on his wife, and it manifests his refusal to admit the manifest truth that his desires, his needs, are bound up with those of others.Graham (in a brilliant performance by James Spader), has organized his life precisely to avoid the lie that John embraces.  He is brutally honest with others, but to avoid any hint of deception he also refuses to be intimate with anyone.  He uses the video camera as a distancing technique, creating an objective filter between himself and the women in his life - pitting them as objects of study rather than subjects in a dynamic relationship, whose parameters he could not ultimately control.  Of course, his little experiment doesn't work out as he plans, and everyone in his life is affected.  The story is simple and direct, the dialogue pitch perfect, the acting top notch, and the direction quite appropriate.  One of my favorite films, and certainly deserving of its status as one of the most important American independent films.

Things do blow up in this film, but on a much smaller scale, and without the pyrotcehnics involved in bigger-budget efforts.John Melaney (Peter Gallagher, probably best known as the coma patient in While You Were Sleeping) is a not-nice guy. Not nice at all. He's married to the repressive sister (Andie McDowell), sleeping with the more liberated sister (Laura san Giacomo), and not terribly concerned with who's going to find out. He is visited by an old school friend. Graham (James Spader) is the slick, weasely guy you usually find prowling the bars, actually living the dream that the guys with the big gold chains and umbrella drinks are dreaming. Graham, however, is impotent, and he sublimates his sexual urges into a fetish for recording women he knows talking about their sex lives. This seemingly harmless affectation ends up throwing the whole finely-balanced ecology around the other three main characters into disarray.Soderbergh is great at keeping the tension high in this film, despite the relative lack of anything goingon most of the time. The four characters keep things going at a steady pace, leisurely and tense at the same time, helped along by a select handful of minor characters who provide the necessary comic relief (Steven Brill is especially good in this regard). A fine movie all around, and while it never quite gets over the top into true timelessness, it's still solid to the core, and very well done in a genre where to fail is to create a spectacularly awful release (eg.

I first watched sex, lies & videotape in a theater and was bored by it.  Perhaps the title had me looking for more explicit elements in the film that just aren't there.  As other reviews here point out, the film is far more subtle than its bold title would suggest.Months later I was in a video store and decided to give the movie another try (my companion when I first saw it had loved it, so I figured it was worth a shot).  Upon the second viewing, I really liked it, appreciating more in depth the interaction of the characters, the challenges (mostly internal) that they face, and the story lines of the film.Several months passed after this second viewing and again I returned to it at the video store, being one who gravitates toward old favorites more often than not.  Watching the film for the third time, I found myself appreciating the film as a love story as tender and touching as others I'd seen, though far more quirky than your typical love story plot.The next time I picked up the box in the video store (yes, I did eventually just BUY it!), I noted a review that proclaimed the movie as ""hilarious"", which really caught my attention.  Here I had seen the movie three times, in three different ways and yet I could not remember at any time finding anything remotely funny about it.  So again I rented it and, yes, found myself laughing out loud at times during the movie.  Don't get me wrong, it will never be mistaken for Caddyshack, but it does have its own quirky sense of humor.Now, the movie is naturally among my all-time top five. Soderbergh has gone on to become a great director that at times is very heavy-handed artistically (e.g. Limey, Traffic), while at other times letting the story or the actors lead they way (e.g. Erin Brockovich).

11217,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0767812158,S. Schell,"[6, 9]","""sex, lies and videotape"" is an intriguing indie that comes from Academy Award-winning writer and director Steven Soderbergh, the man responsible for two of the Y2K's most critically acclaimed films - Traffic and Erin Brockovich (in theaters now is ""Ocean's Eleven"").  Soderbergh was 26 when he wrote and directed ""sex, lies and videotape"" in 1989, winning the FIPRESCI and Golden Palm awards at the Cannes Film Festival and garnering an Oscar nomination the following year for Best Original Screenplay.  Like all neophyte filmmakers, he had a very limited budget ($1.2 million) and scant knowledge of what could substantially enhance a motion picture. Therefore, resources were limited and ""sex, lies and videotape"" has many weak points - sound/film editing, cinematography, inexperienced actors and ham-fisted direction.  A blatant novice, Soderbergh's immaturity shows in the way his cast aimlessly wanders, the caliber of their performances glaringly under par.Other than the flaws at hand, SL&amp;V proves to be a very intriguing drama, unfolding slowly and discreetly.  It begins with Ann Millaney (MacDowell) lounging on her shrink's settee and obsessing over the Earth's piling garbage.  She's also bothered by the fact that her husband John's (Gallagher) old college buddy is coming to stay with them for a few days without her permission.  John is an egotistical lawyer and lately Ann's appeal towards him has diminished, reaching the point where she recoils at his touch.  John however, isn't too concerned about her waning libido; he makes almost daily visits to the apartment of her younger sister Cynthia (Giacomo) to quell his sexual urges.Ann is oblivious to John's sordid affair and when Graham Dalton (Spader) arrives in town, things start taking a turn toward the bizarre.  Ann finds herself captivated by Graham's quiet, contemplative nature and while visiting his apartment one day, he confesses to a titillating hobby - his entire catalog of video tapes contain explicit discussions with several women about their sexual histories.  She is at first repulsed by his fetish but Graham manages to peak her curiosity and Ann eventually participates in his psychological game with a newfound fervor.It's easy to figure out which actor has the longest resume.  Laura San Giacomo is the neophyte of the group, her role as Cynthia Bishop her very first acting/film credit.  MacDowell had done very little before SL&amp;V, her only notable credit being a supporting part in Joel Schumacher's brat-packer classic ""St. Elmo's Fire"".  Peter Gallagher's resume was substantially longer, though most of his work was based in television.  James Spader is the obvious veteran (Pretty In Pink, Baby Boom, Mannequin, Wall Street)  - he's the only person who seems to fit his character mold the best. As the introverted Graham, his striking appearance (""...a face that fluctuates between remarkably handsome and just plain strange"") and his direct yet pensive delivery are very fitting traits that make Graham seem more alive than the rest.Louisiana accents here are either nonexistent or horribly attempted.  MacDowell is the only genuine Southern belle, her delightful twang acquired in the Carolinas.  Giacomo's drawl comes and goes and even when it's there, it's painfully obvious that she's a Yank (born and bred in West Orange, NJ).  This story could have easily taken place anywhere in the US (upper Manhattan would've been excellent), but Soderbergh chose to film in familiar territory - his hometown of Baton Rouge.My biggest qualm with this flick is MacDowell's interpretation of Ann.  I had read the screenplay several times before I finally rented the movie, delighting in the simplicity of the dialogue and the intense nature of each character.  I found Ann to be a shy but extremely intense person and it's unfortunate that MacDowell plays her a complete 180 from what I imagined.  Instead of the sophisticated and self-conscious woman I pictured, MacDowell has Ann laughing when she should be frowning, smiling inanely at inappropriate moments and underplaying her shock when Graham's MO is revealed for the first time.  In short, Ann appears to be a total airhead, incapable of having a serious moment or an in-depth conversation - the ""blonde syndrome"", as it were.  This is, of course, due to her inexperience.With its central cast of characters and virtually no supporting parts, ""sex, lies and videotape"" could easily be converted to a stage play.  The minimal sets and petite cast command attention, making SL&amp;V eligible for a Broadway run (if Soderbergh were so inclined).Despite the movie's technical flaws, one will find ""sex, lies and videotape"" to be an absorbing drama with a cast and director on their way to very rewarding careers.",4,Appealing Indie,1008720000,"12 19, 2001",2001,4767,"['sex', 'videotape', 'intriguing', 'indie',

His presence becomes disruptive, even though he is not aggressive.

Despite the title, there's nothing raunchy about it, instead we are rewarded with perceptive insight into the lives of the main characters.  James Spader, who also won the Best Actor Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance in this movie portrays Graham, the long-lost pal of Peter Gallagher's John, a lawyer married to Ann [Andie MacDowell] who seems like a lost soul searching for something. Ann, who at first appears uptight and almost sexless, is drawn to Graham and both share a very palbable on-screen chemistry.Ann and John's marriage seems idyllic on the surface, but is plagued by problems. Ann is not interested in sex, and John has lots of illicit sex with Ann's sister, a spitfire named Cynthia [Laura San Giacomo]. The characters are well-cast, each bringing a certain level of depth to his/her character and especialyl so with Spader's performance, as the subtle and unassuming, yet mentally tortured Graham.Graham's role here is very significant in impacting upon and acting as a catalyst in the transformation of the other characters. He makes videotapes of women's sexual confessions, and the impact this has upon Ann and Cynthia is crucial to the plot.Steven Soderbergh does an excellent job directing, drawing out nuanced performances from his cast, and the result is truly a wrenching look at human relationships.
