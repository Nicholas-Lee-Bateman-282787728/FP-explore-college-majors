547457,A2QZVW56O4WSBT,B00004CZVT,Cloggie Downunder,"[0, 0]","A Town Like Alice is the 1956 low-budget film adaptation of the 1950 novel of the same title by Nevil Shute. The screenplay generally follows the plot of the novel, although only the first half of the novel is included: Jean&#8217;s experiences in Australia and her life with Joe are absent from the film. Joe is very well played by Peter Finch; Virginia McKenna plays a rather older Jean than in the book, blonde, unable to speak Malay and rather more emotional. The setting is quite authentic, although some of the beauty is lost due to the film not being in colour, and in trying to portray sunburned skin in b&w it is difficult not to make the actors look simply dirty or made up. This film won the 1957 BAFTA Best British Actor, Best British Actress and was nominated for the Best British Screenplay, Best British Film and Best Film from any source.

But the conclusion, last 5 minutes or so, is even better.Virginia McKenna does a great acting job, especially in the increasingly emotionally gripping scenes in the last few minutes.  I can't imagine how shecould have been better.So both are worth seeing.

This short novel send-up was the real deal, starring many fine actors, both Japanes and British. Told in flashback to Harry Andrews, the romantic leads are Helen Morse and a new-comer, Bryan Brown. What is missing today in any Hollywood love story is the struggle, sacrifice and testingt of potential partners dramatized throughout this series. The tension of the unselfish pair, builds to s surprise climax, but you would lose considerable enjoyment if you miss any of the realistic events that tested their resilience and courage, both the captors and the captives, when war intervenes.

547464,A1QCTBSO24KF4Q,B00004CZVT,John Chapman,"[4, 4]","This original 1956 adaptation of the Nevil Shute book, ""A Town Like Alice,"" is a great teaser.  This version stared Peter Finch as Joe Harmon as an Australian POW and Virginia McKenn as Jean Paget, an English woman being marched around the coutnry side of the Malay penninsula by her Japanese captors.  The book, the 1956 movie and a 1981 Masterpiece Theater TV production are all based from an actual incident that took place in Malaya in the early months of 1942.  A number of English women and children were captured by the Japanese.  No officer would take responsibility for them at any internment camps so they were marched hundreds of miles around the countryside.  Many of the women as well as some children, died of disease, fatigue and starvation.  When their Japanese guard dies, Jean Paget brokers a deal with a village elder.  He allows the survivors to stay in his village to plant and harvest rice.  Joe Harmon pilfers and barters for food and medicine to keep them alive which he passes along to Jean Paget.  The two develop a relationship talking about their hometowns.  Jean is drawn to Joe's stories about Alice Springs.  At some point Joe is discovered to have been stealing by the Japanese.  He is beaten and cruicified for his troubles with his fellow POW's and the English women, including Jean Paget, looking on helplessly.  I won't go into any more on this story other than to say the women survive the war.  READ THE BOOK.  Then watch this movie.  Finch and McKenna BOTH won the 1956 BAFTA awards for Best Performance by an actor or actress.  This is the English version of the Academy Award Oscar. A DVD extra includes an interview with several of the performers, including Virginia McKenna and the director.  They provide some nice background information on the making of the film.My three daugthers became familiar with the 1981 Masterpiece Theater version that starred Bryan Brown, Helen Morse and Gordon Jackson.  We fell in love with the story.  On our summer vacations driving cross country we would listen to the book on tape at least three times every summer as we drove all over the country.The 1956 version is much shorter then the 1981 version but the story comes across nicely.  The rock solid performances of Peter Finch and Virginia McKenna are the icing on the cake.  If forced to choose between the 1956 and the 1981 story I would be hard pressed to make the call.Hopefully, Masterpiece Theater will get their version out on DVD.  They are missing a golden opportunity.  The versions that are out there are poorly copied from VHS tape and leave a lot to be desired.You won't go wrong buying this DVD.",5,A Town Like Alice (B&W 1956),1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,2642,"['original', '1956', 'adaptation', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'book', 'Town', 'Alice', 'great', 'teaser', 'version', 'stared', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Joe', 'Harmon', 'Australian', 'POW', 'Virginia', 'McKenn', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'English', 'woman', 'being', 'marched', 'coutnry', 'side', 'Malay', 'penninsula', 'Japanese', 'captors', 'book', '1956', 'movie', '1981', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'TV', 'production', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'Malaya', 'early', 'months', '1942', 'number', 'English', 'women', 'children', 'were', 'captured', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'would', 'take', 'responsibility', 'internment', 'camps', 'were', 'marched', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'countryside', 'Many', 'women', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'died', 'disease', 'fatigue', 'starvation', 'When', 'Japanese', 'guard', 'dies', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'brokers', 'deal', 'village', 'elder', 'survivors', 'stay', 'village', 'plant', 'harvest', 'rice', 'Joe', 'Harmon', 'pilfers', 'barters', 'food', 'medicine', 'keep', 'alive', 'along', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'two', 'develop', 'relationship', 'talking', 'hometowns', 'Jean', 'drawn', 'Joe', 'stories', 'Alice', 'Springs', 'point', 'Joe', 'discovered', 'have', 'been', 'stealing', 'Japanese', 'beaten', 'cruicified', 'troubles', 'fellow', 'POW', 'English', 'women', 'including', 'Jean', 'Paget', 'looking', 'helplessly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'story', 'other', 'say', 'women', 'survive', 'war', 'READ', 'BOOK', 'Then', 'watch', 'movie', 'Finch', 'McKenna', 'BOTH', 'won', '1956', 'BAFTA', 'awards', 'Best', 'Performance', 'actor', 'actress', 'English', 'version', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Oscar', 'A', 'DVD', 'extra', 'interview', 'several', 'performers', 'including', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'director', 'provide', 'nice', 'background', 'information', 'making', 'film.My', 'three', 'daugthers', 'became', 'familiar', '1981', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'version', 'starred', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Helen', 'Morse', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'summer', 'vacations', 'driving', 'cross', 'country', 'would', 'listen', 'book', 'tape', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'summer', 'drove', 'country.The', '1956', 'version', 'much', 'shorter', 'then', '1981', 'version', 'story', 'nicely', 'rock', 'solid', 'performances', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'are', 'icing', 'cake', 'forced', 'choose', '1956', '1981', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'make', 'call.Hopefully', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'will', 'get', 'version', 'DVD', 'are', 'missing', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'versions', 'are', 'are', 'poorly', 'copied', 'VHS', 'tape', 'leave', 'lot', 'be', 'desired.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A
