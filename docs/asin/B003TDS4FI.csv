1361915,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B003TDS4FI,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","At first, I didn't understand why these two films were packaged as a double feature; that is, until I found out they're two versions from a play. The well-used play ""Merton of the Movies"" has been made over several times over the years, and these two films are examples of that outgrowth.First, Paramount Pictures does a retitled one called ""Make Me A Star"" (1933). It features then-popular actor-comedian Stuart Erwin (but Joan Blondell gets top billing) as a lowly store clerk whose movie-crazy dreams lead him to Hollywood. Once there, things don't go as planned, naturally. Interestingly, this version leans heavily on pathos (Blondell's sympathetic lunch for starving Erwin is one of those moments) as well as light comedy. Erwin, whose comedy style as ""the schnook"" is occasionally too mild to make an impact, ends the film in a weepy climax. ""Old pros"" such as Ben Turpin & Zasu Pitts turn up.Retaining the original title, MGM's 1947 ""Merton"" was bought as a vehicle for their resident clown, the wonderful Red Skelton. This one's a pure comedy, and easily the livelier version of the two offerings. With a more snappy pace, Red plays the hick come to make his fame during the silent movie era. Thanks to Skelton, there are some comedy gems to treasure: A running gag with Red hooking his cane onto things (the film closes with this gag); Red ""attempting"" to be quiet in a gentleman's club; ""messenger"" Red marring a Civil War drama with his bumbling; and a theatre climax with Red hiding in rows while patrons jump up like ""the wave"". While surely not Skelton's best film, this underrated comedy still deserves a good look.Which version is more faithful to the play? Your guess is as good as mine. It's pretty obvious both studios went their own way in creating their films. Yes, both leads are named Merton. Yes, they eventually get duped into making comedies instead of dramas (nearly an ironic footnote for two comedians). But this is where similarities end.The verdict? I, personally, like the Red Skelton version, mostly because I think he's one of (and still is) the funniest men in movies. As for yourself, you be the judge.",4,Dueling Mertons,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2139,"['first', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'packaged', 'double', 'feature', 'found', ""'re"", 'two', 'versions', 'play', 'well-used', 'play', 'Merton', 'Movies', 'been', 'made', 'several', 'times', 'years', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'examples', 'outgrowth.First', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'retitled', 'one', 'called', 'Make', 'Me', 'A', 'Star', '1933', 'then-popular', 'actor-comedian', 'Stuart', 'Erwin', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'top', 'billing', 'lowly', 'store', 'clerk', 'movie-crazy', 'dreams', 'lead', 'Hollywood', 'Once', 'there', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'naturally', 'Interestingly', 'version', 'heavily', 'pathos', 'Blondell', 'sympathetic', 'lunch', 'starving', 'Erwin', 'one', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'light', 'comedy', 'Erwin', 'comedy', 'style', 'schnook', 'occasionally', 'too', 'mild', 'make', 'impact', 'film', 'weepy', 'climax', 'Old', 'pros', 'such', 'Ben', 'Turpin', 'Zasu', 'Pitts', 'turn', 'up.Retaining', 'original', 'title', 'MGM', '1947', 'Merton', 'was', 'bought', 'vehicle', 'resident', 'clown', 'wonderful', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'one', 'pure', 'comedy', 'easily', 'livelier', 'version', 'two', 'offerings', 'more', 'snappy', 'pace', 'Red', 'hick', 'come', 'make', 'fame', 'silent', 'movie', 'era', 'Thanks', 'Skelton', 'are', 'comedy', 'gems', 'treasure', 'running', 'gag', 'Red', 'hooking', 'cane', 'things', 'film', 'gag', 'Red', 'attempting', 'be', 'quiet', 'gentleman', 'club', 'messenger', 'Red', 'marring', 'Civil', 'War', 'drama', 'bumbling', 'theatre', 'climax', 'Red', 'hiding', 'rows', 'patrons', 'jump', 'up', 'wave', 'surely', 'not', 'Skelton', 'best', 'film', 'underrated', 'comedy', 'still', 'good', 'look.Which', 'version', 'more', 'faithful', 'play', 'guess', 'as', 'good', 'mine', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'studios', 'went', 'own', 'way', 'creating', 'films', 'Yes', 'leads', 'are', 'named', 'Merton', 'Yes', 'eventually', 'get', 'duped', 'making', 'comedies', 'instead', 'dramas', 'nearly', 'ironic', 'footnote', 'two', 'comedians', 'where', 'similarities', 'end.The', 'verdict', 'personally', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'version', 'mostly', 'think', 'one', 'still', 'funniest', 'men', 'movies', 'be', 'judge']",Make Me A Star / Merton Of The Movies
1361916,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003TDS4FI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","Make Me a Star (William Beaudine, 1932)Comedy in the early days of the film industry (which I'll define as pre-WW2, despite that covering an awful lot of ground) was in the main a lot simpler than it is now, with characters that were a lot more two-dimensional, an overreliance on silly gags (and puns, don't forget the puns!), and a staid predictability. In other words, they were safe, the filmic equivalent of a Barbara Cartland novel. Not to say there's no comedy like that today; Broken Lizard's movies have a great deal more in common with Laurel and Hardy than they do with Sandler and Schneider (and thank heaven for that), for example. And if you like that sort of thing, then it's worthwhile for you to dig back into the treasure trove Hollywood has to offer from the pre-WW2 years, and especially the pre-code years. Make Me a Star is a minor film at best, flirting with the edges of pre-code scurrilousness (while the Hays Code was adopted in 1930, it was not enforced until 1934) without ever getting as racy as something like Wellman's Night Nurse, which also featured the delicious dame Joan Blondell. The comedy is gentle and kind of silly without ever getting into screwball territory, you have every faith that the guy will end up with the girl at the end, and all that sort of thing, but still, like so few comedies of modern times, it's actually funny now and again.Merton Gill (Stuart Erwin, nominated for an Oscar in Pigskin Parade five years later) is a down-home kind of guy who believes he's got it in him to be an actor. Problem is, while he's a big fish in the small pond he comes from, his acting talents are nowhere near Hollywood-quality. But he's so earnest that no one's willing to tell him how bad he is. Still, he camps out in the lobby of the studio of his idol, Buck Benson (The Thin Man's George Templeton, nominated for two directing Oscars, but never one for acting), until an actress (Blondell) and a secretary (the great ZaSu Pitts) take pity on the kid and send him to be an extra in a Buck Benson picture. Of course, he flubs it completely, but this gives the director (Oscar Apfel, who played in one hundred seventy-three films and directed over one hundred others, all in the span of thirty years) an idea: the kid's so bad that he'd be perfect in a Buck Benson spoof. Problem is, the kid's still so earnest that he believes comedy is a debasement of the form. Thus, a deception is plotted...If you're a film buff, you're going to want to watch this for the cameos as much as anything else; Maurice Chevalier, Claudette Colbert, Frederic March, Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper, Charles Ruggles, Sylvia Sidney, and a host of others pop up unannounced here, and that's always fun. But the central story is engaging (and still as fresh as it was almost eighty years ago; free agency may have killed sports, but Hollywood grinds on as it always has despite studios no longer having actor-slaves), there's some actual chemistry between Erwin and Blondell, and despite the script being simplistic and often predictable, the movie's still a joy to watch. It's not the best movie you'll ever see. It's not even the best movie from the early thirties you'll ever see. But it's good, and it's watchable. ***",3,"Oh, Joan Blondell... one of the screen's true bombshells.",1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,3241,"['Make', 'Star', 'William', 'Beaudine', '1932', 'Comedy', 'early', 'days', 'film', 'industry', ""'ll"", 'define', 'pre-WW2', 'covering', 'awful', 'lot', 'ground', 'was', 'main', 'lot', 'simpler', 'now', 'characters', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'two-dimensional', 'overreliance', 'silly', 'gags', 'puns', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'puns', 'staid', 'predictability', 'other', 'words', 'were', 'safe', 'filmic', 'equivalent', 'Barbara', 'Cartland', 'novel', 'Not', 'say', 'comedy', 'today', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'movies', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'common', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'do', 'Sandler', 'Schneider', 'thank', 'heaven', 'example', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'worthwhile', 'dig', 'back', 'treasure', 'trove', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'pre-WW2', 'years', 'especially', 'pre-code', 'years', 'Make', 'Star', 'minor', 'film', 'best', 'flirting', 'edges', 'pre-code', 'scurrilousness', 'Hays', 'Code', 'was', 'adopted', '1930', 'was', 'not', 'enforced', '1934', 'ever', 'getting', 'as', 'racy', 'something', 'Wellman', 'Night', 'Nurse', 'also', 'featured', 'delicious', 'dame', 'Joan', 'Blondell', 'comedy', 'gentle', 'kind', 'silly', 'ever', 'getting', 'screwball', 'territory', 'have', 'faith', 'guy', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'girl', 'end', 'sort', 'thing', 'still', 'so', 'few', 'comedies', 'modern', 'times', 'actually', 'funny', 'now', 'again.Merton', 'Gill', 'Stuart', 'Erwin', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Pigskin', 'Parade', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'down-home', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'be', 'actor', 'Problem', 'big', 'fish', 'small', 'pond', 'acting', 'talents', 'are', 'nowhere', 'Hollywood-quality', 'so', 'earnest', 'one', 'willing', 'tell', 'how', 'bad', 'Still', 'out', 'lobby', 'studio', 'idol', 'Buck', 'Benson', 'Thin', 'Man', 'George', 'Templeton', 'nominated', 'two', 'directing', 'Oscars', 'never', 'one', 'acting', 'actress', 'Blondell', 'secretary', 'great', 'ZaSu', 'Pitts', 'take', 'pity', 'kid', 'send', 'be', 'extra', 'Buck', 'Benson', 'picture', 'course', 'flubs', 'completely', 'director', 'Oscar', 'Apfel', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'hundred', 'seventy-three', 'films', 'directed', 'one', 'hundred', 'others', 'span', 'thirty', 'years', 'idea', 'kid', 'so', 'bad', ""'d"", 'be', 'perfect', 'Buck', 'Benson', 'spoof', 'Problem', 'kid', 'still', 'so', 'earnest', 'comedy', 'debasement', 'form', 'Thus', 'deception', 'plotted', ""'re"", 'film', 'buff', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'cameos', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'else', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Frederic', 'March', 'Tallulah', 'Bankhead', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Charles', 'Ruggles', 'Sylvia', 'Sidney', 'host', 'others', 'pop', 'up', 'unannounced', 'here', 'always', 'fun', 'central', 'story', 'engaging', 'still', 'as', 'fresh', 'was', 'almost', 'eighty', 'years', 'ago', 'free', 'agency', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'sports', 'Hollywood', 'always', 'studios', 'no', 'longer', 'having', 'actor-slaves', 'actual', 'chemistry', 'Erwin', 'Blondell', 'script', 'being', 'simplistic', 'often', 'predictable', 'movie', 'still', 'joy', 'watch', 'not', 'best', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'movie', 'early', 'thirties', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'good', 'watchable', '***']",Make Me A Star / Merton Of The Movies

1361918,AVBC26VPR0BAE,B003TDS4FI,"Vincent T. Lynch ""vtl""","[4, 5]","This is probably one of Red Skelton's most under-appreciated films.  And, as I sat watching it this time I tried to determine why.  And perhaps it's because it has a split personality.  On the one hand, there's lots of broad humor here...the kissing scene, for example...but lots of pathos, as well.  And so, it's that question of whether this is really a comedy with lots of serious scenes, or a drama with lots of humor.  When we think of Skelton, we usually think of slapstick, and that is certainly present in this film, but the story is of a country bumpkin who wants to become a serious actor in the era of silent pictures.  Unfortunately, no one thinks he's very talented, until they realize that is trying to a serious actor, his antics come across as silly overacting.  Red plays this role just right.  You can get some insight as to why he was later so successful in a couple of television dramas.  He balances the serious and the comic here very well.  And a nice bonus is getting a sense of the silent picture era in which the film is set.  Virginia O'Brien is great as the leading lady, and Gloria Grahame is her typically sultry self.  No, this isn't Clem Kaddiddlehopper or Sheriff Deadeye, but if you are at all a Skelton fan, or a fan of old movies in general, I think you'll enjoy this film...particularly if you look at it as a cross between a comedy and a drama.  Recommended.  The one negative here is that this is not as pristine a print as we're used to from the Warner Archives line; it's not bad, but particularly early on there's a graininess that is a bit distracting in some scenes.",4,Merton Of The Movies...more than meets the eye,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",2010,1610,"['probably', 'one', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'most', 'under-appreciated', 'films', 'sat', 'watching', 'time', 'tried', 'determine', 'why', 'perhaps', 'split', 'personality', 'one', 'hand', 'lots', 'broad', 'humor', 'here', 'kissing', 'scene', 'example', 'lots', 'pathos', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'question', 'really', 'comedy', 'lots', 'serious', 'scenes', 'drama', 'lots', 'humor', 'When', 'think', 'Skelton', 'usually', 'think', 'slapstick', 'certainly', 'present', 'film', 'story', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'who', 'become', 'serious', 'actor', 'era', 'silent', 'pictures', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'very', 'talented', 'realize', 'trying', 'serious', 'actor', 'antics', 'come', 'silly', 'overacting', 'Red', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'can', 'get', 'insight', 'why', 'was', 'later', 'so', 'successful', 'couple', 'television', 'dramas', 'serious', 'comic', 'here', 'very', 'well', 'nice', 'bonus', 'getting', 'sense', 'silent', 'picture', 'era', 'film', 'set', 'Virginia', ""O'Brien"", 'great', 'leading', 'lady', 'Gloria', 'Grahame', 'typically', 'sultry', 'self', 'No', ""n't"", 'Clem', 'Kaddiddlehopper', 'Sheriff', 'Deadeye', 'are', 'Skelton', 'fan', 'fan', 'old', 'movies', 'general', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'particularly', 'look', 'cross', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Recommended', 'one', 'negative', 'here', 'not', 'pristine', 'print', ""'re"", 'used', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'line', 'not', 'bad', 'particularly', 'early', 'graininess', 'bit', 'distracting', 'scenes']",Make Me A Star / Merton Of The Movies
