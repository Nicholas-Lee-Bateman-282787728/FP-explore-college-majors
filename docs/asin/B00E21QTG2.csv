1663851,A5P8WMUX28LLZ,B00E21QTG2,Heidi G.,"[2, 3]","Thomas and Friends Santa's Little Engine DVD is a super cute and fun DVD for any Thomas lover.  When I had the opportunity to review it I knew that my nieces and nephews would love it and I was right.  They sat down and watched the entire video for an hour and they were in love with the Christmas spirit. Briar who is 3 said, ""It's my Thomas movie"" when he saw the DVD.  And older sister Sage who is 4 enjoyed it as well, but Briar was the one that enjoyed it the most.The first story is  ""Santa's Little Engine"" and Sir Topham Hatt is dressing up as Santa Claus so he could visit Sodor.  Which amazed Sage because Santa always visits everywhere, why wasn't he  always in Sodor.  Good question, but one that was easily answered with, of course he does, but now we have proof Santa visits Sodor.  Problem solved!!Episodes Include:  ""Santa's Little Engine""  ""No Snow for Thomas""  ""Frozen Turntable""  ""The Missing Christmas Decorations""  ""Snow Tracks""DVD SPECIAL FEATURES  Sir Topham Hatt's Frosty Friend Game  Guess Who? PuzzlesThere is one thing I know for sure Thomas and Friends Santa's Little Engine is a great DVD for just in time for the holidays!!
