1289110,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002TZS57E,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[9, 9]","For some reason, Christopher Walken attracts people. His acting style is unique and his physical presence on screen is just magnetic. He is one of the very few actors who happens to be good in both dramas and comedies. So, when I learned that he was part of the film ""$5 a Day,"" I couldn't wait. And I have to say this movie doesn't disappoint - it is smart and funny, a total delight, with Walken being responsible for much of it.Directed by Nigel Cole, who also helmed the wonderful ""Calendar Girls"" (2003), this picture has been referred by some as a road movie, which may be the case. Walken stars as Nat Parker, a good-natured and hearted drifter, con artist, scam operator - he likes everything for free, provided he can get away with it  --, who learns that he has a brain tumor and is about to die. He contacts Ritchie Flynn (Alessandro Nivola), his only son, and asks him to take him to New Mexico for a new, free treatment. Problem is, Ritchie has problems of his own, including an imminent divorce from his wife Maggie (Amanda Peet), and being fired from his job as a Health Inspector. Needless to say, he was also recently released from jail. As you can imagine, growing up with Nat, he inherited some of his ""talents."" Ritchie accepts against his will, and they travel by car from New Jersey to New Mexico, making stops in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Along the way, as expected, many things happen - some hilarious --, which make Ritchie learn more about his father. Along the way, too, they visit Dolores Jones (the very sexy Sharon Stone), who happened to be Ritchie's baby-sitter, and with whom Ritchie had a crush as a kid. This is pure gold.""$5 a Day"" feels fresh and it makes you feel good. It is also tender and touching, with awesome photography by Peter Donahue. The film also stars Peter Coyote and Dean Cain. The DVD includes director and cast interviews and more. (USA, 2008, color, 98 min plus additional materials).

Richie did an 11 month stretch for taking the heat for one of Nat's schemes and took a health inspector job upon his release.  Out of the blue Richie gets a message from Nat that he's dying and he needs a lift to Mexico for an experimental treatment.  That's when the fun begins.  Nat spends his life cadging freebies and on their road trip there are any number of opportunities.  Whether bumming a free birthday meal at IHOP or crashing a trade convention dinner you will be simultaneously amused and repulsed at Nat's audacity.  You can sense the pride in his voice as he relates how he swung a deal for $50.00 at the Howard Johnson lobby for his wedding reception.  My wife, who never met a deal she didn't like, was taking mental notes while we were watching the movie.  This is the perfect vehicle for Walken's independent streak.  His deadpan sense of humor makes Nat's guile more palatable.  The film is at turn funny, poignant, and moving without being maudlin.

1289113,A328S9RN3U5M68,B002TZS57E,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","It seems like every year or so the cinema comes out with a 'road movie' - an extended revelation of character deficiencies and nobilities played out on the open road (such as 'La Strada', 'Easy Rider', 'Thelma and Louise', 'About Schmidt', 'Motorcycle Diaries', 'The Adventures of Felix', 'Central Station' etc). They usually do well at the box office as a type of catharsis for the audience.  That '$5 A DAY', given an excellent script by writing team Neal and Tippi Dobrofsky, a director with the comic timing such as Nigel Cole, and one of the finest groomed casts around, wasn't a major hit is puzzling.  Timing, I suppose, but at least we have the great opportunity to see this little jewel of a movie on DVD. By all means pay attention.Richie Flynn Parker (the gem of an actor Allesandro Nivola who can play comedy as well as he handles drama) is unhappy: he is a conservative Health inspector of restaurants - fired when his police record is uncovered (he had taken the rap for one  of his father's capers), whose girlfriend Maggie (Amanda Peet) is leaving him because he never communicates about who he really is,  and discovers a letter from his gallivanting grifter huckster father Nat Parker (Christopher Walken in a pitch perfect comedic role) who claims he is dying from a brain tumor and needs a ride to New Mexico for a special treatment.  Because Flynn's life is such a mess he consents to go and he and his father set out in a 'Sweet and Low' advertising little auto. Nat shows how he can live on $5 a day by sleeping in empty homes, pulling shenanigans to get free food, entry into parties (Dean Cain plays an 'old acquaintance'), and money and gas.  The two spar about why Nat was never there for Flynn, how their relationship is broken, and gradually Flynn discovers the realities of his background - realities he nightly shares on voicemail to his girlfriend Maggie.  Along the way the two make stops including a visit to Flynn's previous babysitter Dolores (Sharon Stone, better than ever!), a woman who knows how to bolster Nat's morale and brighten his life - as well as fill Flynn in on some important truths about his parental past.  Flynn questions whether Nat really is dying or is just pulling off a scam to get a trip to New Mexico.  But in Albuquerque Nat meets up with an old debtor Kruger, now wealthy because of Nat's assistance years ago, and in the process of correcting problems with the past, Flynn's true identity is revealed.  What began as a raw, near hostile relationship between Nat and Flynn is transformed in a very touching manner.It is such a pleasure to jump into the trip and go along with this entertaining ride with Walken and Nivola because they are so very fine in their roles that we feel like we know them well.  The balance between hilarity and pathos is excellent and the quality of every aspect of this little Indie film is first class.  Highly recommended!

A young man (Alessandro Nivola) agrees to drive his father (Christopher Walken), who may or may not have an inoperable brain tumor, from Atlantic City to New Mexico, where the latter hopes to get into an experimental treatment program. The results are pretty predictable, and your enjoyment will be mostly proportional to how much you like (or dislike) Christopher Walken. Walken is a fine actor who always has something smoldering under his performance, whether it be a touch of insanity or violence, or, in this case, sweetness. He is terrific here, and he is well paired with Nivola. As in most road movies, the two meet an assortment of characters on the way to their final destination (including Dean Cain, Sharon Stone, and Peter Coyote), but it's basically a two-character film.

How can anything with him as the comedic star be shelved like this was? Chris has it all as an actor as well as a comic presence: tight timing, wryness to spare, and an endless reservoir of sly looks and moves. Not many actors have a resume with films like Pennies From Heaven, The Deer Hunter, King Of New York, Catch Me If You Can (another fine flim-flam film (say that three times fast)) and $5 A Day, to name but a few of Walken's best.Not to mention his many classic skits on SNL (The Continental!), where his dancing and comedic skills finally gained the huge audience they deserve. This film is no exception; it's light on the hoofing but heavy on the laughs, mainly from Walken. The script has some fine moments as do the other actors, but 5AD is all Walken's, and he's fully up to the task. He easily controls every single scene he's in; you can't take your eyes off him---the sign of a true star---and he delivers the laughs here by milking every line for all it's worth with his trademark off-beat pauses. The guy knows how to use his eyes and voice to focus our thoughts exactly where he wants them, then bang! Yet another crisp bit of humor.He makes a perfect con man here; Nat is charmingly duplicitous, and his never-ending schemes are rarely mean or uncouth...just slippery as an eel. He sucks everybody into his weird wake, and his son Ritchie has trouble holding the many grudges he has every right to. Walken makes Nat so likable that you end up cheering him on and cracking up every time he pulls another fast one. The only question for me here is why this took two years to come out on dvd, and got such limited release in theaters. It's a sweet little comedy, and even the oddly orange Sharon Stone is quite funny in it; I have a strong feeling this will be a real cult classic as the years roll by.If you like Walken, have any charmingly roguish family members, or just love to crack up, $5 A Day will keep you laughing until its bittersweet end.Recommended.",4,Walken is hilarious in another fine flim-flam film,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,2076,"['was', 'surprised', 'see', 'local', 'rental', 'barn', 'love', 'Walken', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'How', 'can', 'anything', 'comedic', 'star', 'be', 'shelved', 'was', 'Chris', 'all', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'comic', 'presence', 'tight', 'timing', 'wryness', 'spare', 'endless', 'reservoir', 'sly', 'looks', 'moves', 'Not', 'many', 'actors', 'have', 'resume', 'films', 'Pennies', 'From', 'Heaven', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'Catch', 'Me', 'Can', 'fine', 'flim-flam', 'film', 'say', 'three', 'times', 'fast', '5', 'A', 'Day', 'name', 'few', 'Walken', 'best.Not', 'mention', 'many', 'classic', 'skits', 'SNL', 'Continental', 'where', 'dancing', 'comedic', 'skills', 'finally', 'gained', 'huge', 'audience', 'deserve', 'film', 'exception', 'light', 'hoofing', 'heavy', 'laughs', 'mainly', 'Walken', 'script', 'fine', 'moments', 'do', 'other', 'actors', '5AD', 'Walken', 'fully', 'up', 'task', 'easily', 'single', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'sign', 'true', 'star', 'laughs', 'here', 'milking', 'line', 'worth', 'trademark', 'off-beat', 'pauses', 'guy', 'how', 'use', 'eyes', 'voice', 'focus', 'thoughts', 'exactly', 'where', 'then', 'bang', 'crisp', 'bit', 'humor.He', 'perfect', 'con', 'man', 'here', 'Nat', 'charmingly', 'duplicitous', 'never-ending', 'schemes', 'are', 'rarely', 'mean', 'uncouth', 'just', 'slippery', 'eel', 'everybody', 'weird', 'wake', 'son', 'Ritchie', 'trouble', 'holding', 'many', 'grudges', 'right', 'Walken', 'Nat', 'so', 'likable', 'end', 'up', 'cheering', 'cracking', 'up', 'time', 'fast', 'one', 'only', 'question', 'here', 'why', 'took', 'two', 'years', 'come', 'out', 'dvd', 'got', 'such', 'limited', 'release', 'theaters', 'sweet', 'little', 'comedy', 'even', 'oddly', 'orange', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'quite', 'funny', 'have', 'strong', 'feeling', 'will', 'be', 'real', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'roll', 'by.If', 'Walken', 'have', 'charmingly', 'roguish', 'family', 'members', 'just', 'love', 'crack', 'up', '5', 'A', 'Day', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'bittersweet', 'end.Recommended']",N/A

I enjoyed this film as it had a lot of funny moments, and I think Christopher Walken did a fairly decent job in it. Sharon Stone has a tendency to get on my nerves but was actually all right, plus she's only in it for a second or so. Light-hearted and easy to watch, my wife even liked it, and she is often times overly critical of movies in general. The picture and sound quality are good, and it was worth the price I paid, no problems with the disc whatsoever.",4,-It's Ok-,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,514,"['purchased', 'one', '2.89', 'including', 'shipping', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'funny', 'moments', 'think', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'did', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'tendency', 'get', 'nerves', 'was', 'actually', 'all', 'right', 'only', 'second', 'so', 'Light-hearted', 'easy', 'watch', 'wife', 'even', 'liked', 'often', 'times', 'overly', 'critical', 'movies', 'general', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'paid', 'problems', 'disc', 'whatsoever']",N/A

His dad (Nat, Christopher Walken), in Atlantic City writes him and claims he is dying from a brain tumor and needs his help to go to New Mexico for experimental treatment. Nat is a con artist who manages to get by using the free offers and give-aways that corporations come up with. Nat has a route planned where they can stay for free at various locations, as well as eat free at Howard Johnson's and get free gas from Chevron while driving a pink PT Cruiser with ""Sweet and Low"" on it. The drive allows father and son to bond. During the trip Ritchie calls his ex-girlfriend to give her his pathetic bio, except she never picks up the phone. The scene on the cover with Sharon Stone in the car with the two of them, never happens and is just a cover shot. Sharon Stone plays a bit part as Ritchie's former babysitter, now a scamming cougar. The movie goes along very pleasant, only to end with a scam I found beneath both Nat and Ritchie and a bit anti-climatic.  ""The Brothers Bloom"" is a far superior con artist movie.",3,ANOTHER FLIM-FLAM MAN MOVIE,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,1141,"['Ritchie', 'Flynn', 'Alessandro', 'Nivola', 'fired', 'job', 'same', 'time', 'girlfriend', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'dad', 'Nat', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'claims', 'dying', 'brain', 'tumor', 'help', 'go', 'New', 'Mexico', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'Nat', 'con', 'artist', 'who', 'get', 'using', 'free', 'offers', 'give-aways', 'corporations', 'come', 'up', 'Nat', 'route', 'planned', 'where', 'can', 'stay', 'free', 'various', 'locations', 'as', 'well', 'eat', 'free', 'Howard', 'Johnson', 'get', 'free', 'gas', 'Chevron', 'driving', 'pink', 'PT', 'Cruiser', 'Sweet', 'Low', 'drive', 'father', 'son', 'bond', 'trip', 'Ritchie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'give', 'pathetic', 'bio', 'never', 'up', 'phone', 'scene', 'cover', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'car', 'two', 'never', 'just', 'cover', 'shot', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'bit', 'part', 'Ritchie', 'former', 'babysitter', 'now', 'scamming', 'cougar', 'movie', 'along', 'very', 'pleasant', 'only', 'end', 'scam', 'found', 'Nat', 'Ritchie', 'bit', 'anti-climatic', 'Brothers', 'Bloom', 'far', 'superior', 'con', 'artist', 'movie']",N/A
