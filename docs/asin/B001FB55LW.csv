To avoid having any form of psychosis, please learn to say no when you can't do certain things. Jim Carrey is hilarious in this film, so is Zoey Deschanel and others. Deschanel's performance on stage should not be missed for any reason 'cause it's so funny. She is great in some other parts too, but her performance is my favourite Deschanel scene in the entire movie. Like I said before, the other actors were also great. The non-'white' characters are portrayed positively, but they are few.... Some of the 'white' characters are portrayed positively as well, but not everyone as is the case in real life. I can relate to being misunderstood. It's nice that Jim Carrey learned Korean for this film because people shouldn't limit themselves to just one language when there are lots of them out there. I love that the movie is also about love, a universal subject as well as friendship. I also love that Jim's character and his girlfriend are spontaneous because having the same routine is not healthy. It's terrific that Carrey's character is nice to people, but there are limits. I recommend this film because people shouldn't say yes every time, but viewer discretion is advised because of the scene where Carrey does something R-rated with a much older woman.",4,"Yes, Saying Yes Too Much Is Very Problematic",1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,1358,"['realistic', 'film', 'showing', 'how', 'bad', 'be', 'yes', 'man', '-woman', 'are', 'limits', 'avoid', 'having', 'form', 'psychosis', 'please', 'learn', 'say', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'certain', 'things', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'hilarious', 'film', 'so', 'Zoey', 'Deschanel', 'others', 'Deschanel', 'performance', 'stage', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'reason', 'so', 'funny', 'great', 'other', 'parts', 'too', 'performance', 'favourite', 'Deschanel', 'scene', 'entire', 'movie', 'said', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'also', 'great', ""non-'white"", 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'positively', 'are', 'few', ""'white"", 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'positively', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'everyone', 'case', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'relate', 'being', 'misunderstood', 'nice', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'learned', 'Korean', 'film', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'limit', 'just', 'one', 'language', 'when', 'are', 'lots', 'there', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'about', 'love', 'universal', 'subject', 'as', 'well', 'friendship', 'also', 'love', 'Jim', 'character', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'spontaneous', 'having', 'same', 'routine', 'not', 'healthy', 'terrific', 'Carrey', 'character', 'nice', 'people', 'are', 'limits', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'yes', 'time', 'viewer', 'discretion', 'advised', 'scene', 'where', 'Carrey', 'something', 'R-rated', 'much', 'older', 'woman']",Yes Man

1190790,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001FB55LW,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","Jim Carrey was once an actor who elicited endless bouts of laughing fits that usually resulted in one being bent over on the couch on the verge of peeing in ones pants.Or so I hear.To be completely honest, I've never been a huge fan of the whole `zany is funny' approach to comedy.  Sure, every once in a while a mindless film that filters gag after gag is a nice escape from reality, but I prefer my comedy to have a little more substance.  Even at that, I could never deny the fact that Carrey had what it took to do what he did better than most other people.  I may not be the biggest fan of `Ace Ventura' or `The Cable Guy' or even `Dumb and Dumber', but I respect what this man can do.  He is, without doubt, considered a comedic god to many.  Personally though, I have come to admire what Jim has been able to do with smarter, more subdued comedies.  His performances in films like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and `The Truman Show' are leagues better than what he's done in any of his big Blockbuster smash hits.As of late, Carrey's star has seemed to kind of fade away.  His newer movies are not as big and or as exciting as his older ones, and as he increases in age he has found himself replaced by the new generation of slapstick stars.Because of that, you may not have given `Yes Man' the time of day.Even before it was released, rumors of this being nothing but a `Liar, Liar' rip off were everywhere.  Beings that I was not a huge fan of `Liar, Liar' to begin with (I found it only marginally funny) I was not really all that excited about this film and so I wrote it off.  Then I noticed that it co-stared the amazingly talented and absolutely gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (who I would sit through anything to see) and I decided to give it a try.  Cuddled up on a couch with my wife and my best friend we popped this bad boy in and prepared ourselves for a letdown.That letdown never came.What is so great about `Yes Man' is that it plays to every one of Carrey's strengths without letting them get the better of him.  He begins the film a very subdued character, and so when he starts to venture into `zany' territory he is reeled in by his character's demeanor.  He never goes overboard, which saves this film from becoming a random clich&eacute;.  Instead, he pulverizes us with physical comedy that works, with new age wit that works and with actual human emotion that sells because his character seems much more down to earth than a lot of the freaks he's played in the past.  Deschanel is sweet and charming and everything a man could ever want and need and so she complements Carrey's transformation very well; and the script is actually all sorts of clever.  Sure, there are moments of clich&eacute;d and obvious `borrowing' from other possibly better films, but for the most part this one actually works very hard to be something memorable.If you like what Carrey is capable of when handed the right script then see this movie.  It's one of his better films in recent years, certainly his best since `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.  Sure, it has nothing on that film (they are totally different), but for what it attempts to be, it is aces all the way.",5,I'll avoid the obvious pun; so just take my word for it and see this movie...,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",2009,3192,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'was', 'once', 'actor', 'who', 'elicited', 'endless', 'bouts', 'laughing', 'fits', 'usually', 'resulted', 'one', 'being', 'bent', 'couch', 'verge', 'peeing', 'ones', 'pants.Or', 'so', 'hear.To', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'whole', 'zany', 'funny', 'approach', 'comedy', 'Sure', 'once', 'while', 'mindless', 'film', 'filters', 'gag', 'gag', 'nice', 'escape', 'reality', 'prefer', 'comedy', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'Even', 'could', 'never', 'deny', 'fact', 'Carrey', 'had', 'what', 'took', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'even', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'respect', 'what', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'doubt', 'considered', 'comedic', 'god', 'many', 'Personally', 'have', 'come', 'admire', 'what', 'Jim', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'smarter', 'more', 'subdued', 'comedies', 'performances', 'films', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Truman', 'Show', 'are', 'leagues', 'better', 'what', 'done', 'big', 'Blockbuster', 'smash', 'hits.As', 'late', 'Carrey', 'star', 'seemed', 'kind', 'fade', 'away', 'newer', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'big', 'as', 'exciting', 'older', 'ones', 'age', 'found', 'replaced', 'new', 'generation', 'slapstick', 'stars.Because', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'Yes', 'Man', 'time', 'day.Even', 'was', 'released', 'rumors', 'being', 'nothing', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'rip', 'were', 'everywhere', 'Beings', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'begin', 'found', 'only', 'marginally', 'funny', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'excited', 'film', 'so', 'wrote', 'off', 'Then', 'noticed', 'co-stared', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'would', 'sit', 'anything', 'see', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Cuddled', 'up', 'couch', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'popped', 'bad', 'boy', 'prepared', 'ourselves', 'letdown', 'never', 'came.What', 'so', 'great', 'Yes', 'Man', 'one', 'Carrey', 'strengths', 'letting', 'get', 'better', 'film', 'very', 'subdued', 'character', 'so', 'when', 'venture', 'zany', 'territory', 'reeled', 'character', 'demeanor', 'never', 'overboard', 'film', 'becoming', 'random', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Instead', 'physical', 'comedy', 'new', 'age', 'wit', 'actual', 'human', 'emotion', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'lot', 'freaks', 'played', 'past', 'Deschanel', 'sweet', 'charming', 'everything', 'man', 'could', 'ever', 'want', 'need', 'so', 'Carrey', 'transformation', 'very', 'well', 'script', 'actually', 'sorts', 'clever', 'Sure', 'are', 'moments', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'obvious', 'borrowing', 'other', 'possibly', 'better', 'films', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'actually', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'like', 'what', 'Carrey', 'capable', 'when', 'handed', 'right', 'script', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'certainly', 'best', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Sure', 'nothing', 'film', 'are', 'totally', 'different', 'what', 'be', 'aces', 'way']",Yes Man

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","It seems Jim Carrey has turned his attention away from being his typically goofy self including facial expressions and other silly mannerisms, and has turned to a more... not necessarily a more intelligent style of comedy, but starring in films that focus less on the goofiness.So far it seemed to work for Jim Carrey, because the Yes Man was pretty funny.  It's about a man (Jim Carrey of course) who has to say ""YES"" to everything.  This includes ALL questions asked by everyone.  This can include having to say yes to his neighbor (an old lady who knows a thing or two about making love), his workmates (one of them being a Harry Potter fanatic) and his girlfriend (whom he met at a gas station while riding a motorcycle).I do miss the old version of Jim Carrey where he was just an insanely goofy person, but with good writing to back up his behavior so the writing in those old movies had a purpose at least.  Yes Man is a very minor disappointment in that regard, but not enough to take away from all the times I was sitting there laughing while watching it tonight.The film does a really nice job covering a variety of different locations, and having Carrey's character interact with a variety of interesting people.  I like that.  It makes the story that much more interesting when Jim Carrey has to say yes to everything.Maybe the writers could have found funnier ways for Jim Carrey to say yes involving funnier segments and questions, but that's a small complaint because in the end this is a movie I recommend you watch with your family, and a film all Jim Carrey fans should be able to appreciate.",4,another quality film starring Jim Carrey,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,1610,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'turned', 'attention', 'away', 'being', 'typically', 'goofy', 'self', 'including', 'facial', 'expressions', 'other', 'silly', 'mannerisms', 'turned', 'more', 'not', 'necessarily', 'more', 'intelligent', 'style', 'comedy', 'starring', 'films', 'focus', 'less', 'goofiness.So', 'far', 'seemed', 'work', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Yes', 'Man', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'man', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'course', 'who', 'say', 'YES', 'everything', 'ALL', 'questions', 'asked', 'everyone', 'can', 'include', 'having', 'say', 'yes', 'neighbor', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'thing', 'two', 'making', 'love', 'workmates', 'one', 'being', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fanatic', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'met', 'gas', 'station', 'riding', 'motorcycle', '.I', 'do', 'miss', 'old', 'version', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'insanely', 'goofy', 'person', 'good', 'writing', 'back', 'up', 'behavior', 'writing', 'old', 'movies', 'had', 'purpose', 'least', 'Yes', 'Man', 'very', 'minor', 'disappointment', 'regard', 'not', 'enough', 'take', 'away', 'times', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'laughing', 'watching', 'tonight.The', 'film', 'really', 'nice', 'job', 'covering', 'variety', 'different', 'locations', 'having', 'Carrey', 'character', 'interact', 'variety', 'interesting', 'people', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'say', 'yes', 'everything.Maybe', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'funnier', 'ways', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'say', 'yes', 'involving', 'funnier', 'segments', 'questions', 'small', 'complaint', 'end', 'movie', 'recommend', 'watch', 'family', 'film', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fans', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate']",Yes Man

Terrance singles him out of the crowd and gets him to agree to a covenant. He has up until now been saying ""No"" to life, but now he must say ""Yes"" instead.

Happy networking a**hole!=======Yes Man is right up there with the greatest Jim Carrey films. It has a serious concept, but doesn't skimp on the comedy. The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, as I have said many times before, but it was quite dark and not everyone ""got"" it. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another triumph, but Carrey was very low key in it, suppressing his inner Ace Ventura. The Truman Show was a noble experiment that failed. Too much high concept, not enough low brow humor. Man in the Moon was another failed experiment that paid homage to the edgy humor of Andy Kaufman but tried to wrap it up in a package that would entertain the lowest common denominator, which is a self-defeating proposition. Dumb & Dumber was in my opinion a masterpiece of the broad comedy Carrey does so well, unencumbered by any higher aspirations whatsoever. However, in Yes Man Carrey has found that sweet spot right in between broad comedy and a more serious film with a message.------------Carl Allen: What I have to share is huge... and I want to share it with you.========Yes Man is based on a book by British Author Danny Wallace who spent a year saying ""Yes"" to every proposition and question he was asked, and then wrote about the results. Carrey and Director Peyton Reed spent a lot of time developing the story and changing it to an American setting. Carrey was really inspired by the message of the film and acted without pay, though he would get a share of the profits. He gave it his all, even breaking some ribs in a stunt. The stunt woman for Zooey Deschanel also broke her hip while riding a scooter, so Zooey had to ride it herself. The whole cast really gave an outstanding effort with superb results. Rhys Darby played Carl's boss Norman, and I'll compare him to Peter Sellers at the risk of hyperbole.------------Allison: [singing with her band, Munchausen's By Proxy] Don't call me past 11 PM, it won't happen again.

1190811,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001FB55LW,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 1]","Is it really healthy to say yes to everything? That seems to be the point ""Yes Man"" is trying to make. It tells the story of Carl Allen (Jim Carrey), a closed-off banker from Los Angeles who's challenged to accept whatever opportunities come his way, no matter what. The idea of expanding your horizons is a good one, although when you find yourself saying yes to things like Internet ads for penis enlargements or Persian mail-order brides, chances are you're taking the challenge a little too seriously. It's not about saying yes to everything--it's about saying yes when you know it feels right. What I find amazing is that this movie is based on a biography by British writer and humorist Danny Wallace, who spent six months accepting every offer in an attempt to make his life more interesting. Did he realize what kind of movie the Americans wanted to make? I guess it doesn't matter, not when you've practiced saying yes to everything.Is this to say that Jim Carrey should have said no to ""Yes Man""? Let me answer that with a resounding maybe. It's by no means a great film, but it's not a terrible film, either; it's an occasionally amusing comedy that gives Carrey license to indulge in the goofy mannerisms he's become so famous for. In the course of the story, he gets drunk out of his mind, engages in a barroom brawl, and drinks enough Red Bull to keep him wired for an entire night. He even wraps tape around his head, distorting his face grotesquely. While not very inspired, you do have to admire an actor that can bring so much youthful energy into a role. I admire him, at least.The plot: The always negative, recently divorced Carl runs into Nick (John Michael Higgins), an old friend who claims that a self-help guru inspired him to live his life to the fullest. He takes Carl to a Yes seminar hosted by the guru, named Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). Once the seminar begins, Bundley pressures Carl into accepting the Just Say Yes challenge. Now things start to get interesting. First, he gives a homeless man a lift, and when he asks for all of Carl's money, Carl willingly hands it over. Later on, he finally visits his elderly neighbor, Tillie (Fionnula Flanagan), who can do some pretty wild things with her mouth once she removes her dentures. He takes guitar lessons. He learns to speak Korean. At work, Carl begins accepting every loan request. He also says yes to his boss, Norman (Rhys Darby), who really seems to like themed costume parties.One of the more pleasant outcomes of this new life philosophy is Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who Carl met at a gas station. Allison dabbles in a number of things. She paints. She rides a scooter. She does charity work. She's part of an unknown rock group called Munchausen By Proxy (some may call them edgy, but the reality is that they're untalented). She heads a small group that somehow combines a love of photography with a love of jogging; every morning at 6:00, she and her group run around Griffith Park with cameras in their hands. I know, it doesn't make much sense, but she seems to be getting something out of it. She's also falling in love with Carl. What she doesn't yet realize is the reason why he's saying yes to everything.The only person who has any grasp of the situation is Carl's newly engaged best friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper). While he never appreciated Carl's refusal to do anything social, he doesn't agree with the yes-only philosophy he's now living by. He makes his point twice, first by announcing in a bar that Carl would be picking up the tab, second by asking him to plan his fianc&eacute;e's wedding shower. It isn't long before other friends start taking advantage of Carl; at that point, he finally begins to realize how blindly he's been going about this whole yes thing. It comes to a head on a spur-of-the-moment trip to Lincoln, Nebraska, when he's arrested on suspicion of being a terrorist.So again, I ask: Is this something Jim Carrey should have said no to? I admit, the concept is kind of funny, and there were a few select moments that made me chuckle. But I never got as far as laughing out loud, probably because the film is geared more towards a younger, more easily amused crowd. The one I was with certainly had a ball, especially later in the film, when Carl ended up on a motorcycle dressed in nothing but a hospital gown. The bike's powerful torque was apparently not as funny as the revealing nature of the gown. And after reaching his destination, making tire marks on the pavement, and walking slow motion out of the smoke, the audience actually applauded. Yes, there's nothing more exciting than a scantily clad comedian walking away from a motorcycle.Did Danny Wallace do any of this? How should I know? I haven't read his book. But given his stature as an author, do you think he could see ""Yes Man"" and think it's funny? I once again find myself turning to maybe as an answer. Incidentally, that word plays a very important role near the end of the film, which is very fitting in my opinion; it tells me that even the filmmakers were unsure about what they were dealing with. Let me put it this way: If you consistently get your money's worth out of Jim Carrey comedies, then chances are you'll have fun watching this movie. If not, then it's entirely your call. The ads say that yes is the new no, but I think that might be pushing it.",3,Yes? No?

The idea of saying yes and having good things happen to people is a sweet idea, and it's played well here. Sadly Jim Carrey does a few too many goofy faces, silly talk, and bad singing. A good percentage of the jokes fall pretty flat.The good: Zoey Deschanel's body of work is beginning to look like fun. A band-aid in Almost Famous, always quirky. She performs a number of songs in this film, and can genuinely sing. It wan't just a quirk during the bathroom scene in Elf. Zoey is a member of the group She & Him,Volume One. I loved the mooneyes on her helmetJohnny Lightning Mooneyes 1960's Shelby Cobra SILVERfrom the 50/60/70's drag racing era. The Eels perform a good percentage of the soundtrack. This is an amazing indie group,Meet the Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1,Souljacker [Bonus Disc]. The lead singer's father came up with the physics theory of parallel universes,NOVA: Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives. Mostly Jim Carrey is funny. The supporting cast is very good overall.The not so great: The direction was not outstanding. The film was very uneven. It really got legs with around 30 minutes to go, the peak of funny. Peyton Reed has directed such great humorous films as The Love Bug for television, Bring it On, and Bad Haircut. Jim Carrey did just too many of those horrible facial expressions from Mask.An Illustration of how the early part of the film was not exactly riviting cinema. Carl makes a pretty big deal out of picking up a copy of 300 in the video store. The movie then progresses a few days, maybe a week. Carl goes back to the video store and rents some random movies - clearly he returned 300 by that time - and we never see the movie titles. The next time we see him watching a movie, it's a clip (pun intended, a man is cutting off his leg) from Saw. And then a clip from 300. What, how could that be, he returned 300 already. Ah, a silly little continuity error. Oh, bigger point, the film was not interesting enough that I was looking for that kind of thing.The film is rated PG-13 and personally, I think that was a gift. There are some scenes I did not want my 13 year old son to watch. There is a scene of an old woman, that asks Carl if he'd like sexual relief. He finally says yes (well there's his covenant to always say yes). The next montage is of him laying on the bed, her moving her way down his body, a shot of her teeth in a glass, and then a shot of Carl's reaction to having a very enjoyable orgasm. That thread is repeated later in the movie when one of his buddies goes to a back room with this old woman and says, I've heard a lot about what you can do. There were a few too many fairly adult jokes and visuals in this film. The language was a bit strong here and there. I'm not protective of my son, however, this was just wrong for his age.The single disc DVD edition contains no bonus features at all.

1190817,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B001FB55LW,Davewise,"[1, 1]","First, let me say that I enjoy most of Jim Carrey's work though not all. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of my favorite movies, while I didn't care for ""Cable Guy"". ""Yes Man"" is probably most similar to ""Liar Liar"" - it allows Carrey to use his knack for physical comedy without overusing it. His bits fit in with the story rather than becoming the story.Carrey plays Carl, a guy who basically hides from the world, turning down invites to dinners, parties, and just about everything else. His close friends tolerate this to some degree, but appear to be close to the breaking point. Carl's life changes dramatically when he attends a motivational seminar which encourages people to say ""yes"" to EVERYTHING, an idea Carl follows blindly.

I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners.  It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likeable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future.

Yet Jim's lone salvation in the comedy YES MAN is delectable and cuddly cute Zooey Deschanel; playing a free spirit romantic interest Zooey is a wonderful counter to Carrey's overplayed antics.  Which makes YES MAN an enjoyable experience, as a shallow loan officer who constantly says ""No"" to lenders has his life transformed via a rowdy seminar (like that plot's never been done before) and commits to saying ""Yes"" to everything he's asked.  Meanwhile he enters into a romance with very predictable results.While Carrey often gets chalkboard-scraping annoying, he does exhibit (on occasion) a delightful rustic charm.  For example, his guitar serenade to prevent a disturbed Luis Guzman from jumping off a ledge is the film's best feel-good moment.  There are similar little gems interspersed throughout the movie (an encounter with an elderly lonely neighbor being one of them) to offset Carrey's perpetual mayhem.  There's a sizable supporting cast (with only Terrence Stamp and Guzman standing out from the crowd) and the story is so predictable you can set your watch to it, yet YES MAN is fun because Zooey is so cute you forget Carrey's around.--D.

Bearing in mind the ""meaning"" of it, not sayinga monosyllable, and taking it all with a pinch of salt (like theself-help guru Terrence Bundley teaches our man in the hospital), thismovie is fun, well made, and doesn't pretend deep meaningful questions.Popcorn movie? Yes, but good one! Only once did I feel I was intoanother formulaic trap. In my case, it was when Carl was riding thesuper motorcycle. It felt like The Mirror Has Two Faces (Streisand's),which was copied in (among others), ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"",etc.Moving to the stuff of life: I love Zooey Deschanel's Allison!

1190838,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001FB55LW,Jason,"[0, 0]","Carl Allen (Carrey), a divorced, borderline reclusive couch potato says, ""No"" to everything.  His negativity naturally steered him towards the divorce, his general malaise, and his work as a loan manager.  When his friend Nick (John Michael Higgins) convinces him to attend a cult-like `Yes' seminar from Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp), his life soon changes.Following the yes-mantra in every way, Carl soon meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who allows spontaneity and bizarre creativity to rule her life.  She is think outside the box personified, and, more importantly, different than the pre-vow Carl in every way.  Together they attack life and cross off a checklist that looks stolen from an insane person's bucket list.  Along the way, Carl predictably learns that in order to truly enjoy life, and another person, one must be open to new experiences and take life as it comes.  This is right up my philosophical alley, challenging oneself, breaking through barriers, and being able to look back in your later years with admiration.  The result is silly, typical Jim Carrey, with just enough laughs to make it enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the name of the alternative band led by Allison: Munchausen by Proxy.  That's hilarious.  However, there are two major problems with this movie.First, and not as significant, the cross-generational implied sex scene between Carl and his geriatric neighbor is enough to make a billygoat puke.  It's unnecessarily gross, and I've been less appalled by the Saw series.  Secondly, however, is the nave nature with which Carl embraces the ""say yes to everything""-culture.  After giving a bum a ride and allowing him to run down his cell battery, Carl drops the guy off in a dark, remote park and gives him a wad of cash.  Murders start out this way.  Imagine if he had said yes to other situations that could have been presented:-Seriously, do you want to go in that meth house?-Don't worry about protection; let's go au natural.  OK?-Can I tell you what it is after you eat it?-I know that hitchhiker has a bloody shirt and an ear-necklace, but I feel good about him because his sign says he's a vet.  Want to pick him up?There's promise to the premise, but just like everything in life, there are shades of gray.Overall, Carrey is pretty funny, especially during the Nebraska football scene, but I feel like the co-stars stole the show.  Zooey Deschanel is cute, and off-beat enough to make the character believable.  Other than Maggie Gyllenhall, I can't think of another actress who could have believably pulled it off.  Stamp is convincing as the self-help guru Bundley - his brood is like a snake-swinging church.  Higgins is hilarious as a cross between an insane man and a liberated free-thinker.  The true scene-stealer, however, is Rhys Darby as Norman; his costume parties (Harry Potter and 300) are hilarious, and his awkward Britishness (?) fits perfectly into the niche necessary for plot development.Even though my single word feeling about this movie is, ""Meh,"" I happily say ""Yes"" and recommend it if for no other reason than to see Jim Carrey return to his comedic roots abandoned after Me, Myself, and Irene.",3,"Welcome back Carrey to comedy, or frown at the predictability?

Rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor, language, and Jim Carrey's backside as seen in an ICU robe (which is why they call it ""I see you."")  Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel. Bradley Cooper, Fionnula Flanagan, Terrence Stamp, Vivian Bang, Sasha Alexander, Rhys Darby, Danny Masterson, Brent Briscoe, and others.A guy challenges himself to say ""yes"" to everything for an entire year.  Loosely based on Danny Wallace's autobiographical book (he makes a cameo appearance in the film).Jim Carrey doesn't exactly hit a home run out of the ballpark every movie he makes, but this time he got it right.

Both sides of that equation can thoroughly enjoy  ""Yes Man.""

I'm drawn to dry humor and she didn't disappoint in Yes Man.But one thing bugged me to the point that I'm not going to watch it again, nor am I giving it a glowing recommendation. Same old, same old, rude sexual jokes and comments pepper the first half hour or so including an embarrassing [...] comment and a few references to genitals. A scene involving an elderly woman offering to pay for a neighborly gesture with sexual favors, and the follow-up scene with Carl (Carrey) on the bed and the dentures getting dropped into a glass of water. Then she targets another young man. All of these scenes and comments don't add to the plot line or humor. Oh, maybe an embarrassed titter, but really, the humor is junior high at best and it gets old.We don't see the hero and heroine in bed. Carl turns away an opportunity with another woman. So I was left wondering about the whole point of Carl and his neighbor's little encounter.I really wanted to respect Carl and his friends and root for him as he began to grow and change, but the distraction of the adolescent sexual humor really detracted from a story that could have been really good.",3,"I Would've Liked it, But",1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,1587,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'latest', 'film', 'good', 'moments', 'Carrey', 'squish', 'face', 'well-known', 'rubbery', 'poses', 'storyline', 'cute', 'Hints', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'are', 'present', 'different', 'enough', 'be', 'clever', 'fresh', 'own', 'merit', 'have', 'really', 'appreciated', 'most', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'serious', 'Truman', 'Show', 'more', 'slapstick', 'Fun', 'Dick', 'Jane', 'think', 'good', 'actor.Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'sarcastically', 'charming', 'usual', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'dry', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Yes', 'Man.But', 'one', 'thing', 'bugged', 'point', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'am', 'giving', 'glowing', 'recommendation', 'Same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'rude', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'comments', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'including', 'embarrassing', '[', ']', 'comment', 'few', 'references', 'genitals', 'scene', 'involving', 'elderly', 'woman', 'offering', 'pay', 'neighborly', 'gesture', 'sexual', 'favors', 'follow-up', 'scene', 'Carl', 'Carrey', 'bed', 'dentures', 'getting', 'dropped', 'glass', 'water', 'Then', 'young', 'man', 'scenes', 'comments', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'plot', 'line', 'humor', 'Oh', 'maybe', 'embarrassed', 'titter', 'really', 'humor', 'junior', 'high', 'best', 'old.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'hero', 'heroine', 'bed', 'Carl', 'away', 'opportunity', 'woman', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'whole', 'point', 'Carl', 'neighbor', 'little', 'encounter.I', 'really', 'wanted', 'respect', 'Carl', 'friends', 'root', 'began', 'grow', 'change', 'distraction', 'adolescent', 'sexual', 'humor', 'really', 'detracted', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good']",Yes Man

The positivity ""Yes"" leader asks who are new attendees and picks Carl out of the audience.  He walks over to where Carl is sitting as Carl said ""No"" he would not come up on the stage.  One-on-One, in front of thousands the Yes Guru talks to Carl and makes a covenant for him to say Yes, that good things will happen.  Bad things will happen when he says no.At first Carl grudgingly embraces saying Yes - but soon realizes good things happen when he helps people.  Carl becomes a man who says Yes - and cannot say no.He meets a quirky young woman (Zooey Deschanel) on a motorcycle who happens to sing rock music, and take photos while jogging at the break of dawn, he learns guitars, learns a new language, learns to play the guitar, helps an elderly neighbor lady,I was pleasantly surprised how Cary played the lead.

So he sits at home and avoids his friends.  Not that Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) let him drop out of life completely.  Carl works at a bank where he denies every loan that comes across his desk.Things changes dramatically when he decides to attend a conference run by Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp).

Emphasis on the several.  I was ready to laugh hard at the entire movie, and that just didn't happen.On the whole, the movie is pretty predictable.  That was one reason I didn't find it as funny as I expected to.  I saw most of the jokes coming long before the punch line.  Likewise, all but a couple of the plot points were overly familiar.On the other hand, I found the story enjoyable.  I identified with Carl a little too much, so I was rooting for him to get out of his rut and enjoy life again.  Heck, it even made me rethink how I am living my life.  Pretty head stuff from a comedy.  And the great acting from everyone in the cast made it easy to like the characters.Since the movie is rated PG-13, I expected the language and sexual nature of some of the jokes.  But there were a couple in particular that I found out of line and squirm inducing.So the problem with the movie really comes down to the writing.

In the film, Jim Carrey plays an emotionally closed down man who has fallen into the habit of saying no to everything, until he's convinced by a cheesy self-help guru to make a ""covenant"" with life to say yes to everything.One might expect the movie to be something really zany given Jim Carrey's typical brand of humor (which I felt smothered the humor in a similar film he was in years back called ""Liar, Liar), but for the most part I thought it was a little more serious than that...to the point where when it did veer into craziness, that seemed a bit out of place and contrived.  I finished watching this thinking that it might have been interesting if the story had played it completely straight and shown both the good and the bad resulting from living one's life as a ""yes man.""

His friendships suffer, he's stuck in a dead-end job after five years of service, and he spends his time watching movies and being miserable.  Carl suffers a nightmare after blowing off his best friend Peter's (Bradley Cooper) wedding shower, so he decides to go to a seminar where he's embarrassed into entering a covenant where he has to say ""Yes"" to every opportunity that presents itself to him.  While it gives him some trouble at first, he ultimately finds himself meeting the quirky yet adorable Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and starts finding happiness in his life.  Will Carl be able to maintain the satisfactory results into saying ""Yes"" to everything, or will he have to break the covenant and eventually be forced to say ""No"" and go back to living a miserable life?Now, Jim Carrey seems to be doing many of these romantic comedies lately but you know what?  It's still darned funny and was absolutely worth checking out.  The film was grandiose a lot of the time once Carrey's character learned to say ""yes"" to everything but the whole story is well supported from start to finish and there never was a dull moment.

If ""Yes Man"" were merely a typical Hollywood ""comedy"" that mistook frenzy for laughs, I could have borne it. But ""Yes Man"" crosses over far too often into the realms of the offensive.

After missing his best friend's engagement party, he has an epiphany and allows himself to be dragged to a ""Yes man"" seminar, where he learns to say yes to everything.

For example, this latest comedy by Jim Carrey would have been great if it was released in 1990.  But coming out in 2008, after other Carrey films such as The Mask, Me Myself and Irene, and Bruce Almighty, this movie actually seems like a rehash of Carrey's previous films.  In The Mask, Carrey plays a meek bank employee who after encountering a mask, becomes an alpha male that takes everything he wants.  In Me, Myself and Irene, Carrey plays a pushover police officer who occasionally morphs into an aggressive alter-ego.  And in Bruce Almighty, Carrey plays a passive reporter who meets God, and suddenly relishes his new powers.  Notice the recurring theme?  Well, it gets transplanted into this movie in its full entirety.  Carrey plays Carl, a bank employee (again) who is a shy introvert loser.  He goes to a meeting by an inspirational speaker, and his life suddenly turns around.  Now he is extroverted, outgoing, with a happening life.  And of course there is the love interest, this time played by the cool, calm Zooey Deschanel.  To sum it up, this movie is a rehash of Carrey's previous comedies, except less funny.

1190873,A1D3XQC2DIT,B001FB55LW,Peter Shermeta,"[1, 1]","Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is an exaggerated version of anyone who has difficulty committing to things (or people). The events in his life have caused him to shy away from any engagement, regardless of how innocent; something needs to change. Coincidentally Carl runs into an old friend who says that becoming a ""Yes Man"" has changed his life. A Yes Man, from the seminar Carl attends, is someone who takes a vow not to turn down any new opportunities, effectively saying ""yes"" to everything. Carl commits to changing his life; he takes the Yes Man vow and attacks life with new vigor.I can understand that an actor wants to grow and continually take on new challenges, but Jim Carrey is so incredibly talented as a comedic leading man. Some people consider his more serious roles as worthwhile endeavors, but I disagree. The only move away from comedy that I have forgiven Mr. Carrey is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I will go so far as to say that it is one of my favorite movies. Jim Carrey brings a funny movie to life. Yes Man is a blend of the funny and dramatic movies that Carrey has done. The movie is full of laughs, but it has a stomachable, if not endearing message. He does add a few of his (over-the-top) ad-lib moments, but you wouldn't watch Good Times and not expect Jimmie Walker to say ""Dy-no-mite!"" either.Zooey Deschanel was perfect as the movie's leading lady. She provided the perfect amount of eccentricity to play Yin to Carl Allen's pre-vow Yang. She is cute and I am glad they didn't cast someone more socially-deemed ""beautiful"" to play this part, because it would not have been believable. She is great.Rhys Darby was a great choice for Norman, Carl's boss. He was great in the part and the two costume parties he throws might have been the two main highlights of the movie for me. We'll see if this movie can give him a more mainstream American following than his work on Flight of the Conchords. He is very entertaining.I took Yes Man in as a matinee with the family. Granted, it is a family that currently has no little children, but it was a great family movie. There were a lot of laughs and a tender moment or two for the romantics amongst us (but be wary of some offensive language).

That's how important I feel this movie is - I want to own it and show it to my friends and family in the months to come.To be honest, Jim Carey's usual movie formula is too manic for my tastes.  For every sensible Bruce Almighty or Truman Show there is an over-the-top Ace Ventura, and I'm one of those who don't go in for crude humor and middle-school plotting.  But in an outing more aligned to Carey's &#34;Liar Liar,&#34; we find &#34;Yes Man&#34; follows the life an ordinary, reasonable man thrown into an extraordinary situation.  And as he learns and grows, so we in the audience learn and grow with him.  I found the experience both exciting and thought-provoking.Without giving too much of a spoiler: imagine being challenged to just say YES to any opportunity that comes your way?  Now imagine being so lost and desperate, that you have nothing to lose by saying Yes to what presents before you?  Now what if - against all reason and common sense - the path you followed - the dominos you set in motion by going down the path - lead to bigger and better life experiences and rewards than you would ever have been able to accomplish by 'playing it safe'?This movie takes us on that kind of trip.  Assisted by the ever-charming pixie-ish Zooey Deschanel and an equally charming cast, Jim learns that the most unlikely choices can lead to incredible outcomes.  There IS place for the path less taken and the beat of the different drummer.If you need a little more poetry and derring-do in your life, add this movie to your collection.  It was a sleeper at the box-office, but big screenings is not where a film like this belongs.  It earns a solid place in my collection because it delivers on the small scale, up close and personal, and I am the better for having seen this film.

1190884,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001FB55LW,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Essentially a cock-eyed variation on ""Liar Liar,"" ""Yes Man"" presents Jim Carrey as a bank loan officer who spends most of his off-duty hours actively avoiding social engagements with his friends and co-workers.  A ""lonely guy"" by choice, Carl undergoes a life-altering experience when he attends a self-help seminar dedicated to the proposition that one can get a whole lot more out of life by saying ""yes"" when opportunity comes a-knockin' than by saying ""no.""  Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, ""Yes Man"" doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to.  On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling.  The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run.  Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here.  Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).On the downside, ""Yes Man"" does have a whiff of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake.  Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note.  And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine.  The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.",3,enjoyable if generic Carrey comedy,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,2149,"['Essentially', 'cock-eyed', 'variation', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'Yes', 'Man', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'bank', 'loan', 'officer', 'who', 'most', 'off-duty', 'hours', 'actively', 'avoiding', 'social', 'engagements', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'lonely', 'guy', 'choice', 'Carl', 'life-altering', 'experience', 'when', 'self-help', 'seminar', 'dedicated', 'proposition', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'life', 'saying', 'yes', 'when', 'opportunity', 'a-knockin', 'saying', 'Soon', 'Carl', 'agreeing', 'virtually', 'offer', 'way', 'often', 'surprising', 'hilarious', 'results.As', 'generally', 'generic', 'Carrey', 'vehicle', 'Yes', 'Man', ""n't"", 'provide', 'much', 'way', 'thespian', 'stretch', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'toss', 'one', 'roles', 'off', 'sleep', 'wanted', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'less', 'contrived', 'previous', 'efforts', 'thanks', 'fact', ""n't"", 'rely', 'cheap', 'gimmick', 'magic', 'spell', 'knock', 'head', 'get', 'plot', 'rolling', 'decision', 'become', 'compulsively', 'agreeable', 'act', 'volition', 'part', 'character', 'thus', 'making', 'tale', 'more', 'relatable', 'grounded', 'long', 'run', 'Nobody', 'better', 'Carrey', 'when', 'over-the-top', 'mugging', 'frequently', 'prime', 'form', 'here', 'Moreover', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'genuine', 'belly', 'are', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'randy', 'encounter', 'Carl', 'aged', 'landlady', 'achieving', 'movie', 'high', 'point', 'hilarity', 'downside', 'Yes', 'Man', 'have', 'whiff', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'never', 'entirely', 'able', 'shake', 'Moreover', 'certain', 'threadbare', 'quality', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'when', 'movie', 'premise', 'built', 'one', 'repetition', 'single', 'note', 'are', 'definite', 'dull', 'patches', 'when', 'comic', 'ideas', 'seem', 'be', 'withering', 'vine', 'compensation', 'Carrey', 'course', 'form', 'two', 'noteworthy', 'supporting', 'players', 'likable', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Carl', 'best', 'buddy', 'winsome', 'charming', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'slightly', 'offbeat', 'motorcycle-riding', 'band', 'singer', 'Carl', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'course', 'story']",Yes Man

I love Jim Carey anyway, and he is just hilarious in this movie.  Oh, the hijinks he gets into!  It's non-stop fun, but in a completely non-cheesy way.  And the super funny red-head ""agent"" from Flight of the Concords is in it too and plays an equally quirky character.  Also, if you love LA or have ever lived there, this movie is shot in so many great places, like Griffith Park, Spaceland, the Hollywood Bowl - it will make you nostalgic for LA.  I can't believe it's only like $5?  That doesn't even make sense - Oh Amazon how I love you.

To give you my take - I felt this movie was brilliant and totally unexpected - no overacting on Jim Carrey's part - no crazy antics (well other than the Ducati scene!) - just a good hearted movie with great music. Zooey Deschanel - how can you not fall in love with this girl? Get the soundtrack with her singing - Yes Man - the title track to the movie - very cool. Zooey is going to be a major Hollywood star and what's cool about that is she is so grounded - can't wait to see her next film!,5,Jim Carrey gets you through the door but Zooey Deschanel makes the movie!,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,573,"['So', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'know', 'plot', 'yes', 'No', 'pun', 'intended', 'give', 'take', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'overacting', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'part', 'crazy', 'antics', 'well', 'other', 'Ducati', 'scene', 'just', 'good', 'hearted', 'movie', 'great', 'music', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'girl', 'Get', 'soundtrack', 'singing', 'Yes', 'Man', 'title', 'track', 'movie', 'very', 'cool', 'Zooey', 'going', 'be', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'what', 'cool', 'so', 'grounded', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'next', 'film']",Yes Man

But I saw it earlier today on HBO 9 or whatever channel it was, and really liked it alot.It's not much of a thinking movie, basically what happens is that Jim Carrey is sort of a stuck up and boxed in type of guy, who winds up at this seminar where he discovers the power of always saying YES to everything.The movie sort of flows along, without much conflict at all. It's almost as if, if you really went along and just said yes to everything, that life would be perfect. Yet,,, still full of laughs.Carreys boss in the movie, a character named Norm cracks me up everytime. And Zooey Deschnal (spelling?) as usual is the love of my life. Sure she was good in 500 Days of Summer, but I enjoyed her character a lot more in this one, and the way she mixed with the style and timing of Carrey works perfectly. Theres Hyde from the seventies show and the dude from The Hangover too as Carreys close friends.  There is some conflict between the romance at the end, but the positive and upbeat swing of the story never stops. Just say yes to this one.
