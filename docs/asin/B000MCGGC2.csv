I love that the sone stepped up for a father who had been absent for his entire life and fought to provide him the best home care he could give. People today are to quick to shove people into nursing homes and just forget about the person that lives in that mind. I loved this movie,5,Awesome family movie,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,405,"['movie', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'when', 'come', 'talking', 'family', 'issues', 'concerning', 'dementia', 'elderly', 'family', 'members', 'love', 'sone', 'stepped', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'absent', 'entire', 'life', 'fought', 'provide', 'best', 'home', 'care', 'could', 'give', 'People', 'today', 'are', 'quick', 'shove', 'people', 'nursing', 'homes', 'just', 'forget', 'person', 'mind', 'loved', 'movie']",N/A

1044392,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000MCGGC2,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","The Theory of Everything"" is a wonderful Christian film.  The film is inspiring, heartwarming and though-provoking that by the end of the film, you will in no doubt feel touched by it's powerful message.VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Theory of Everything"" is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Picture quality looks slightly compressed as you will notice some compression artifacts and for a 2005 film, the PQ doesn't look as clear as I would have hoped.  There is a fine layer of grain which is fine but for the most part, picture quality for the film is good.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital English and also Spanish and Portuguese Stereo. Dialogue is clear and can be heard clearly through the front channel speakers. For those with a modern home theater receiver and setup will probably want to have audio settings on stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack but overall, audio is clear.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Theory of Everything"" comes with no special features but trailers. I wish there was audio commentary or some sort of special features, especially to know how David de Vos was inspired to write this script and also the inclusion of the science behind the film for the character of Dr. Eugene Holland.JUDGMENT CALL:I was very pleased with ""The Theory of Everything"".  I found it to be quite heartwarming and inspiring.I was surprised to see find out that David de Vos, producer, writer and director and also playing the main lead but also to find out that de Vos also has experience producing and writing for Hollywood specials for popular TV shows such as ""Beverly Hills 90210' and ""The O.C."" and as an actor, his main roles were extras in films such as ""Pearl Harbor"", ""Posers"" and ""The Island"".  But what de Vos was able to create was a magical film that will definitely touch the hearts of many people who have question if God was real and using science to justify if Heaven truly exists. A storyline focusing on the scientific and religious aspect could have been complex but overall, it was well-done (granted, I am not knowledgeable about the scientific things that Dr. Holland speaks of but I'm leaving it up to de Vos that he did research that aspect for the film).Victor Lundin did a tremendous job playing the part of Dr. Eugene Holland and seeing his character so full of energy and eccentric as a scientist but also this crotchety man who goes gun crazy if anyone nears his property.  But most of all, the viewer witnessing this man who was provided with this intellectual talent and his fear that he is losing it due to his brain disease.As for the film as a whole, acting for the film was not exactly spectacular but I am assuming that with the multiple roles that de Vos took part in the film, that the film was more than likely created with a very low budget (unfortunately, I was not able to find out how much the film actually cost).  But I suppose when it comes down to the more emotionally driven and more important scenes, that is where the talent of the film actually do shine.The film is not rated, so for those who plan to watch the film with their family and children, there was one or two scenes that did catch my attention and probably a scene that I wasn't expecting for a Christian film was  when the Holloway family are trying to protect Gene from the authorities and Doug's step sister Delilah went after his estate.The scene features de Vos's daughter Amanda trying to protect her grandfather and in the process, Delilah's friend slapping her in the face and seeing the daughter fall to the ground. With so much noise and seeing Doug nearly lose it and the crying baby and personally, I felt the scene was surprising but it made the film much more real.  So, I'm glad that David de Vos didn't sugarcoat the scene.  Also, it's important to note that Dr. Holland is one of those crotchety neighbors who will shoot anyone who comes near his property with a shotgun and in the beginning, he does try to shoot warning shots at Doug.  I can understand if those two scenes may be upsetting to parents but if you plan to watch this film with the kids, its important to at least parents know that those scenes are in the film.But ""The Theory of Everything"" is an enlightening and enjoyable family film.  From the challenges that exists within families (especially during these economic times where parents tend to focus so much in providing financially for the family and not enough time with them) and if one can keep the faith, they can overcome those challenges.  I thought it was absolutely cool how the family aspect of the film was handled and how the Holloway family reached out to Gene and within their time together, making sure they spent quality time even though they don't have much time due to his degenerative brain disease.The DVD for ""The Theory of Everything"" was originally released by Triumph Marketing back in 2007 and this 2010 re-release from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment doesn't feature anything else new but the trailers and perhaps the additional languages and subtitles.  So, if you are looking for a version that includes Spanish and Portuguese language (and subtitles), then this DVD re-release is for you!If there was one major disappointment that I had towards this new DVD release was the lack of any special features.  This is one of those films that you wish there was some sort of audio commentary included.  I would have loved to hear how David de Vos came up with the story, the challenges he had to undergo by taking on the multiple roles as producer, director, writer and playing the main character of the film, directing the confrontation (between Delilah and her father) segment of the film, him working with the various talent and discussion about the ending scene as well.Overall, ""The Theory of Everything"" is a wonderful Christian film.  The storyline is not too banal nor is religion forced down the viewer's throat.  Also, I have to say that among the Christian films that I have seen thus far, ""The Theory of Everything"" is among the more enjoyable ones that I have seen.I found the ""The Theory of Everything"" to be quite inspiring, heartwarming and though-provoking and by the end of the film, you will in no doubt feel touched by it's powerful message.

1044393,AOKIJQEO2DDNM,B000MCGGC2,Little ol me,"[8, 12]","*possible spoilers* :-PThis movie ranks up there with all of the other movies that individual little groups think they can produce and pull off but can't.  The story isn't smooth at all and moves in so many different directions.  The husband is adopted, but they don't come right out and tell you, they leave it for you to guess.  You see his adoptive parents once in the beginning of the movie, but never again.  Aren't they at least a little bit concerned about the biological father contacting their son?  The wife is shown constantly watching soap operas to the husbands disgust, but they never discuss her addiction to them.  The husband and wife fight constantly with hugely over exaggerated fight scenes and screaming. (think Fireproof)  There is a wicked step sister but nobody does anything to challenge her fight to parental custody or liquidating the old man's assets.  The old man constantly shows up in his front yard holding a gun and shooting at whoever is in his yard.  The whole story is about this old man who is living in a warped reality and thinks he can prove scientifically that God exists.  So during the entire movie there are equations rattled off at speeds so fast you can't even figure what he is talking about.  None of it makes any sense.  I don't know why people have rated this movie so high.  It is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  And I wish I would have known it was a cheap low budget film written and directed by the actor who stars as the husband himself!  It was boring, slow and not worth the money!  To the person who said there was no violence, uhm hello, there was the old man shooting at everyone in his front yard~ and not just once, but also there were numerous instances of the family arguing and yelling!

1044395,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000MCGGC2,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[3, 5]","THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING revolves around a young man named Doug (David de Vos) and the relationship that grows between himself and a man named Gene (Victor Lundin).  Doug is a pilot and the owner of a flight school. His school is doing well, but some delayed payments threaten to destroy his thriving business. He has been spending so much time at work that his wife Abby (Frances Black) feels neglected and spends most of her time eating junk food and watching soap operas.  A few weeks for Christmas, Doug receives a telephone call informing him that his biological father wants to contact him.  He agrees to meet the man whose real name is Eugene Holland. Gene was a former award-winning scientist who became a hermit after the death of his wife, Doug's birth mother. Gene has been spending the past thirty years working on a ""theory of everything"", a theory that unites all the mathematical and physical theories of the universe.  Gene is very close to succeeding, but he needs help. Unbeknownst to Doug, Gene is dying and his request for help is his attempt to finish his masterwork before he dies. The movie attempts to show how close Gene is to finishing his work by displaying Doug using Gene's mathematical and scientific theories to economics to win money from new financial supporters for his flight school. Gene misses his deceases wife dearly and feels that if he can decode the theory of everything, he will be able to open a doorway to heaven itself where he longs to see his wife.  Doug is a Christian who thinks that what Gene is missing is faith in Jesus and lovingly tells him so. In the meantime, Doug's half-sister threatens to ruin everything by having Gene committed for mental instability.Though it's not initially apparent, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a Christian movie. What that means is that a sermon (though not one in church) is contained in part of the movie and there is a ""come to Jesus"" moment where a character makes a declaration of faith. This isn't a bad thing, but viewers should be aware of it. Those moments are handled more believably in THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING than they usually are in Christian movies. The ""sermon"" isn't very preachy and the character's conversion is one that actually seems natural.David de Vos does a good job as Doug. He also directed, wrote, and co-produced the movie. Victor Lundin gives the best performance in the movie. I enjoyed watching the scenes he was involved in the most.I understand the confines of low budget, independent filmmaking. However, even taking that into consideration there are some obvious flaws to THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. The story is actually fairly good, but the way the story is told isn't.  There are gaps in the movie that wouldn't have been so awkward with a little more explanation. For instance, Doug was an adopted child but the word ""adopted"" is never really mentioned, it's hinted at but never spoken. There are other parts of the movie that don't make much sense.  The biggest being the reappearance of Doug's half-sister. Towards the beginning of the movie she agrees to give up any responsibility or relationship she has with Gene. Then she suddenly reappears in a dramatic fashion towards the end of movie where her husband batters Doug's daughter in the presence of a couple of police officers. Conflict is essential for any good story, but it should be conflict that actually makes sense. In all honesty, her reappearance was unnecessary and the story would be smoother and more coherent without it.The other major flaw of THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was the cinematography.  During most of the major conversations in the movie, some of the smaller ones, and many of the movie's key moments the camera revolves around the characters over and over and over. The technique is supposed to give the viewer a sense of omniscience, but it is overused in the movie and made me dizzy at times.Despite these flaws, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is a movie that many will enjoy. It's a movie with a strong message that has no sex, foul language, and minimal violence so families will probably enjoy watching this together. It's also not as preachy as most Christian movies. With a decent script and good acting from the movie's leads, I wanted to really enjoy THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, but I only found it ho-hum. The gaps and nonsensical moments of the storytelling grated on me and I found the oft-used circular use of the camera to be annoying.
