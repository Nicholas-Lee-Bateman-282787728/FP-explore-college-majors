815121,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0001WTVRU,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","We've been hearing a lot about ""pray away the gay"" lately, possibly because Michelle Bachmann's husband does this sort of ""counseling"" full time. But this documentary is nearly 20 years old. The two men in the wedding photo, Michael Bussee and his husband, are the main characters in the story. They were two of the founders of Exodus, one of the major organizations that claimed to turn gay people straight. You see how that worked out for them.The film interviews both people who claim the cure worked for them and people who remain unrepentantly gay. But the primary interest for me was the reasons why they wanted to turn straight: they'd been fed an overwhelming guilt trip by their Christian religion. The film details many of the rather horrible brainwashing techniques employed by the groups. It is by no means just prayer.As I say, the film is almost 20 years old, and some slack must be granted on that account. But these right-wing groups still exist, and are still messing with gay people's heads. So this is still a significant film.",4,An Unique and Thoughtful Documentary,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1046,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'hearing', 'lot', 'pray', 'away', 'gay', 'lately', 'possibly', 'Michelle', 'Bachmann', 'husband', 'sort', 'counseling', 'full', 'time', 'documentary', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'old', 'two', 'men', 'wedding', 'photo', 'Michael', 'Bussee', 'husband', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'were', 'two', 'founders', 'Exodus', 'one', 'major', 'organizations', 'claimed', 'turn', 'gay', 'people', 'straight', 'see', 'how', 'worked', 'out', 'them.The', 'film', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'cure', 'worked', 'people', 'who', 'remain', 'unrepentantly', 'gay', 'primary', 'interest', 'was', 'reasons', 'why', 'wanted', 'turn', 'straight', ""'d"", 'been', 'fed', 'overwhelming', 'guilt', 'trip', 'Christian', 'religion', 'film', 'details', 'many', 'rather', 'horrible', 'brainwashing', 'techniques', 'employed', 'groups', 'means', 'just', 'prayer.As', 'say', 'film', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'old', 'slack', 'must', 'be', 'granted', 'account', 'right-wing', 'groups', 'still', 'exist', 'are', 'still', 'messing', 'gay', 'people', 'heads', 'still', 'significant', 'film']",N/A
815122,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0001WTVRU,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[7, 8]","Associated with right-wing Christian evangelicals, Exodus advocates conversion of homosexuals into heterosexuals through various programs--although precisely what these programs are, how effective they are, and whether such conversion should be attempted at all have been contentious issues since the organization formed in 1976.  ONE NATION UNDER GOD seeks to describe Exodus and similar programs and compare their somewhat vague success stories against the realities of those who attempted this sexual conversion and crashed and burned.The major focus of the film is on Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper.  Bussee was among the five co-founding members of Exodus; Cooper was an Exodus volunteer who is sometimes described as a co-founder, depending on the exact source.  Both were gay men determined to become heterosexual--but precipitated a mighty scandal in the Exodus ranks when they instead fell in love with each other.  Other notables interviewed include Frank Worthen, founder of Love In Action, which pre-dated Exodus; and Martin Duberman, noted author, a gay man who sought to become heterosexual through psychotherapy and whose book CURES documents the process he underwent.As these and other interview subjects speak out on camera they are occasionally interrupted by ""scientific films"" drawn from the 1950s and 1960s; religious leaders who condemn or support, as case may be; and some unintentionally hilarious moments, including one that can only be described as ""beauty tips for lesbians.""  The result is a collage of questions to which no two people have exactly the same answer.  Can one change one's sexuality?  Or not?  If so, how?  And if so, is it actually a desirable sort of thing?Although ONE NATION UNDER GOD clearly comes down on the side of those who claim that ""ministries"" such as Exodus are little more than dangerous pseudo-science, the answers to the questions are not quite as clear cut as one could wish--which is, in fact, one of the points the film makes: to this date there has been no serious study of Exodus' success rates.  The DVD offers a reasonable transfer, but there are no bonuses of any kind--a great pity in this instance, for it is a fascinating subject that bears considerably deeper investigation than this fairly short film allows.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,Intriguing Issues and Unanswered Questions,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",2008,2301,"['Associated', 'right-wing', 'Christian', 'evangelicals', 'Exodus', 'conversion', 'homosexuals', 'heterosexuals', 'various', 'programs', 'precisely', 'what', 'programs', 'are', 'how', 'effective', 'are', 'such', 'conversion', 'should', 'be', 'attempted', 'have', 'been', 'contentious', 'issues', 'organization', 'formed', '1976', 'ONE', 'NATION', 'UNDER', 'GOD', 'describe', 'Exodus', 'similar', 'programs', 'compare', 'somewhat', 'vague', 'success', 'stories', 'realities', 'who', 'attempted', 'sexual', 'conversion', 'crashed', 'burned.The', 'major', 'focus', 'film', 'Michael', 'Bussee', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Bussee', 'was', 'five', 'co-founding', 'members', 'Exodus', 'Cooper', 'was', 'Exodus', 'volunteer', 'who', 'sometimes', 'described', 'co-founder', 'depending', 'exact', 'source', 'were', 'gay', 'men', 'determined', 'become', 'heterosexual', 'precipitated', 'mighty', 'scandal', 'Exodus', 'ranks', 'when', 'instead', 'fell', 'love', 'other', 'Other', 'notables', 'interviewed', 'include', 'Frank', 'Worthen', 'founder', 'Love', 'Action', 'pre-dated', 'Exodus', 'Martin', 'Duberman', 'noted', 'author', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'sought', 'become', 'heterosexual', 'psychotherapy', 'book', 'CURES', 'documents', 'process', 'other', 'interview', 'subjects', 'speak', 'out', 'camera', 'are', 'occasionally', 'interrupted', 'scientific', 'films', 'drawn', '1950s', '1960s', 'religious', 'leaders', 'who', 'condemn', 'support', 'case', 'may', 'be', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'including', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'beauty', 'tips', 'lesbians', 'result', 'collage', 'questions', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'exactly', 'same', 'answer', 'Can', 'one', 'change', 'one', 'sexuality', 'not', 'so', 'how', 'so', 'actually', 'desirable', 'sort', 'thing', 'ONE', 'NATION', 'UNDER', 'GOD', 'clearly', 'down', 'side', 'who', 'claim', 'ministries', 'such', 'Exodus', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'dangerous', 'pseudo-science', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'cut', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'fact', 'one', 'points', 'film', 'date', 'been', 'serious', 'study', 'Exodus', 'success', 'rates', 'DVD', 'reasonable', 'transfer', 'are', 'bonuses', 'kind', 'great', 'pity', 'instance', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'considerably', 'deeper', 'investigation', 'fairly', 'short', 'film', 'allows.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A
815123,A11SSYM4ISRN1I,B0001WTVRU,gclaheh,"[0, 2]","I watched this documentary to gain some understanding of gay people's perspective on many issues.Let me give you guys some background.  I used to belong to a church that supported Focus on the Family which supported the Exodus ministries.  I did not know any gay or lesbian people in the small town where I grew up and assumed that Exodus ministries was a good thing.  I accepted what my church taught me that being gay was a sin and Exodus ministries helped turn gay people straight.  This was in the early to mid 90's.I grew up and left the small town where I grew up and listened to other people's points of views on this issue.  I do agree with what this documentary was trying to say.  Exodus ministries was harmful to the people that they were trying to help.  What some gay people don't know is that now a lot of Christians will also speak out against Exodus ministries.  As a Christian, I believe that gay people desserve to be treated with kindness and respect and many other Christians believe that too.  I do not use gay slurs to describe them and will punish my daughter if I ever hear her repeating them.Where we disagree is that I will always think of homosexuality as a sinful lifestyle that will harm individuals who practice it.  I am sorry, but I don't think it is natural and the people who pratice this are extremely self-centered people.  Their whole idenity is wrapped around who they prefer to have sex with.  The gay couples who want to adopt children or have in-vitro fertilization never think about whether they can provide a good home for the child.  The gay people who I have met were really obnoxious perverted people who never had a thought that maybe other people don't want to hear their off-color jokes.  Even the people in the documentary who were being counseled in Exodus ministries seemed to only talk about their sexual desires.I would like to give this advice to gay people.  You can look for a partner, but you won't ever find the peace, love, and acceptance you are really looking for.  That can only come by finding God and accepting your calling in life-to be single.  Spend your life serving others because you can give yourself wholly to others as a single person.  This would be the same advice that I would give to a single heterosexual who can't find a partner and there are people out there like that.The last thing that I wanted to mention is that I think that the two narrators who fell in love with each other are being used as a tool to make political statements.  They were used before by Exodus as a political mouthpiece and are being used again except this time it is from GLADD groups.  They both left their wives and children to be with each other-never giving a thought to the children and wives they left behind because their sexual desires were more important.  I imagine that when they stood for both groups that they were subject to harassment and death threats as well as their children's whose faces were seen on the DVD.  I hope both groups offered these men protection from these dangerous radicals.  I do believe that some things are worth getting harassed for and receiving death threats, but not this issue for either side.  May God have mercy on them.",5,Gives me a lot of insight on gay people,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",2013,3222,"['watched', 'documentary', 'gain', 'understanding', 'gay', 'people', 'perspective', 'many', 'issues.Let', 'give', 'guys', 'background', 'used', 'belong', 'church', 'supported', 'Focus', 'Family', 'supported', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'assumed', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'accepted', 'what', 'church', 'taught', 'being', 'gay', 'was', 'sin', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'helped', 'turn', 'gay', 'people', 'straight', 'was', 'early', 'mid', ""90's.I"", 'grew', 'up', 'left', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'listened', 'other', 'people', 'points', 'views', 'issue', 'do', 'agree', 'what', 'documentary', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'was', 'harmful', 'people', 'were', 'trying', 'help', 'What', 'gay', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'now', 'lot', 'Christians', 'will', 'also', 'speak', 'out', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'Christian', 'believe', 'gay', 'people', 'desserve', 'be', 'treated', 'kindness', 'respect', 'many', 'other', 'Christians', 'believe', 'too', 'do', 'not', 'use', 'gay', 'slurs', 'describe', 'will', 'punish', 'daughter', 'ever', 'hear', 'repeating', 'disagree', 'will', 'always', 'think', 'homosexuality', 'sinful', 'lifestyle', 'will', 'harm', 'individuals', 'who', 'practice', 'am', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'natural', 'people', 'who', 'pratice', 'are', 'extremely', 'self-centered', 'people', 'whole', 'idenity', 'wrapped', 'who', 'prefer', 'have', 'sex', 'gay', 'couples', 'who', 'want', 'adopt', 'children', 'have', 'in-vitro', 'fertilization', 'never', 'think', 'can', 'provide', 'good', 'home', 'child', 'gay', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'met', 'were', 'really', 'obnoxious', 'perverted', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'thought', 'maybe', 'other', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'off-color', 'jokes', 'Even', 'people', 'documentary', 'who', 'were', 'being', 'counseled', 'Exodus', 'ministries', 'seemed', 'only', 'talk', 'sexual', 'desires.I', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'advice', 'gay', 'people', 'can', 'look', 'partner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'find', 'peace', 'love', 'acceptance', 'are', 'really', 'looking', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'finding', 'God', 'accepting', 'calling', 'life-to', 'be', 'single', 'Spend', 'life', 'serving', 'others', 'can', 'give', 'wholly', 'others', 'single', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'advice', 'would', 'give', 'single', 'heterosexual', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'partner', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'that.The', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'mention', 'think', 'two', 'narrators', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'tool', 'make', 'political', 'statements', 'were', 'used', 'Exodus', 'political', 'mouthpiece', 'are', 'being', 'used', 'again', 'time', 'GLADD', 'groups', 'left', 'wives', 'children', 'be', 'other-never', 'giving', 'thought', 'children', 'wives', 'left', 'behind', 'sexual', 'desires', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'imagine', 'when', 'stood', 'groups', 'were', 'subject', 'harassment', 'death', 'threats', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'were', 'seen', 'DVD', 'hope', 'groups', 'offered', 'men', 'protection', 'dangerous', 'radicals', 'do', 'believe', 'things', 'are', 'worth', 'getting', 'harassed', 'receiving', 'death', 'threats', 'not', 'issue', 'side', 'May', 'God', 'have', 'mercy']",N/A

I had often watched a VHS recording of a television broadcast about 8 years ago and I bought the DVD especially because I was hoping for improved video quality - however the DVD video has significant problems with dropouts and pixilisation, and the audio is just plain shocking with very many dropouts.So I then bought the original VHS version, being prepared to sacrifice some video quality in the hope of improved audio, but sadly the VHS has exactly the same video and audio errors as the DVD - plus the added annoyance of a severely overloaded HiFi audio track which causes lots of clipping throughout.The original content of ""One Nation Under God"" deserved the very best mastering for DVD and VHS presentation, so I am very disappointed.I must correct another reviewer who misrepresents the claimed credentials of the film's main characters. They do not claim to have been ""the two founding members of Exodus"", but merely ""two of the founding members"" - there's a BIG difference.
