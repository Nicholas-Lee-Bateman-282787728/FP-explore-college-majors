1363010,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B003U0AHG4,christmas lover,"[0, 0]",I saw this as a kid many times but I hadn't seen it in years. I ordered it when I saw it available. The only problem was because I hadn't seen it in so long I only vaugly remembered what it was about and had my fingers crossed that it would be the same thing. I didn't need to worry. A few minutes in it dawned on me that it was indeed the same story I liked from so many years ago. All that aside it is a very good story about how Santa Claus may not come after a mouse sends him a letter saying hes a fraudulent myth causing him to send a whole towns set of letters back. To add insult to injury a clockmaker tries to makes things better by making a clock that will cheer Santa Claus up and show him that they really do love him and the same mouse accidently breaks it insuring that he might not come. As I said its a very good story and you should get it.

1363017,AZP335D31XNA7,B003U0AHG4,RetroMan,"[40, 41]","Rankin Bass presents ""Twas the Night before Christmas"" This delightful Christmas special is based on the poem by Clement Moore adapted and written for the show by Jerome Coopersmith and produced by Arthur Rankin Jr.It features charming songs by Maury Laws and lyrics by Jules Bass. Some of the most memorable songs are, ""Even a Miracle Needs a Hand"" and ""Calling Santa,"" among others.There is a reading of the poem in the beginning of the show and when it gets to the part of ""..not a mouse was stirring,"" Father Mouse played by George Gobel catches us up on the events at hand. That being the hope that everything will turn out right in Junctionville and Santa will still visit and everyone can be happy again. Of course I could tell you all the details but you're better off watching it unfold yourself as to not spoil it if you haven't seen it before.Now on to this deluxe edition at hand. On the special alone I would give this show 5 stars but being this is a remastered deluxe edition thus I am scrutinizing it more. Truth be known, I'm a bit fed up with the majority of these deluxe editions from WB because the extras have nothing or hardly anything to do with Rankin Bass and it's talents. Just who is WB marketing these deluxe editions to? Certainly not real Rankin Bass fans. It leaves me perplexed. They have removed the Frosty's Winter Wonderland special from the last incarnation on this dvd so basically they're asking us to double dip it seems on this special being remastered and the extras. So let's see 25 minutes and a bunch of so-so extras. Now give us some real extras like interviews and retrospectives with the creators, a talk and show with Paul Coker who did the character designs here as he did before in Frosty as well, maybe he could draw some of the characters in a quick sketch showing his brilliance. Let's hear from the actors and actresses on what this show meant to them, let's hear from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin and Maury Laws on their experiences making these classics. Or have an interview with someone like Rick Goldschmidt who's a Rankin Bass historian. I would even say a round table with Rankin Bass fans on what this show means to them when they were a kid and what it means to their kids, grandkids etc..If WB is not going to do these deluxe editions justice, except for ""The Year without a Santa Claus"" deluxe edition, those extras were quite good I say why not just release the remaining Rankin Bass Christmas specials in true dvd digital quality the fans want, especially ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" and also ""The First Christmas,"" and ""Drummer Boy Book II."" I certainly don't feel to double dip on these kinds of lack luster deluxe editions. The people who are in charge of making these extras must have no clue on making Rankin Bass themed extras. It seems they have good intentions at first like contacting someone like historian Rick Goldschmidt but as soon as they would have to pay a little compensation they run for the hills. To think of all the money these specials have generated and generate year after year they could compensate the right people who had a hand in creating these Rankin Bass specials in putting together true Rankin Bass themed extras which are beloved by so many. Otherwise these deluxe editions are just a shell of what they should and can be!Feel free to leave your comments if you agree or even disagree.",3,I would like to see real Rankin Bass themed extras!,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,3400,"['Rankin', 'Bass', 'Twas', 'Night', 'Christmas', 'delightful', 'Christmas', 'special', 'based', 'poem', 'Clement', 'Moore', 'adapted', 'written', 'show', 'Jerome', 'Coopersmith', 'produced', 'Arthur', 'Rankin', 'Jr.It', 'charming', 'songs', 'Maury', 'Laws', 'lyrics', 'Jules', 'Bass', 'most', 'memorable', 'songs', 'are', 'Even', 'Miracle', 'Needs', 'Hand', 'Calling', 'Santa', 'reading', 'poem', 'beginning', 'show', 'when', 'part', '..not', 'mouse', 'was', 'stirring', 'Father', 'Mouse', 'played', 'George', 'Gobel', 'catches', 'up', 'events', 'hand', 'being', 'hope', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'Junctionville', 'Santa', 'will', 'still', 'visit', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'happy', 'again', 'course', 'could', 'tell', 'details', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'unfold', 'not', 'spoil', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'hand', 'special', 'alone', 'would', 'give', 'show', '5', 'stars', 'being', 'remastered', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'thus', 'am', 'scrutinizing', 'more', 'Truth', 'be', 'known', ""'m"", 'bit', 'fed', 'up', 'majority', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'WB', 'extras', 'have', 'nothing', 'hardly', 'anything', 'do', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'talents', 'Just', 'who', 'WB', 'marketing', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'Certainly', 'not', 'real', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'fans', 'perplexed', 'have', 'removed', 'Frosty', 'Winter', 'Wonderland', 'special', 'last', 'incarnation', 'dvd', 'so', 'basically', ""'re"", 'asking', 'double', 'dip', 'special', 'being', 'remastered', 'extras', 'So', 'let', 'see', '25', 'minutes', 'bunch', 'so-so', 'extras', 'Now', 'give', 'real', 'extras', 'interviews', 'retrospectives', 'creators', 'talk', 'show', 'Paul', 'Coker', 'who', 'did', 'character', 'here', 'did', 'before', 'Frosty', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'could', 'draw', 'characters', 'quick', 'sketch', 'showing', 'brilliance', 'Let', 'hear', 'actors', 'actresses', 'what', 'show', 'let', 'hear', 'Jules', 'Bass', 'Arthur', 'Rankin', 'Maury', 'Laws', 'experiences', 'making', 'classics', 'have', 'interview', 'someone', 'Rick', 'Goldschmidt', 'who', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'historian', 'would', 'even', 'say', 'round', 'table', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'fans', 'what', 'show', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'what', 'kids', 'grandkids', 'etc..If', 'WB', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'justice', 'Year', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'extras', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'say', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'release', 'remaining', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'true', 'dvd', 'digital', 'quality', 'fans', 'want', 'especially', 'Life', 'Adventures', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'also', 'First', 'Christmas', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'Book', 'II', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'double', 'dip', 'kinds', 'lack', 'luster', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'charge', 'making', 'extras', 'must', 'have', 'clue', 'making', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'themed', 'extras', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'first', 'contacting', 'someone', 'historian', 'Rick', 'Goldschmidt', 'as', 'soon', 'would', 'have', 'pay', 'little', 'compensation', 'run', 'hills', 'think', 'money', 'specials', 'have', 'generated', 'generate', 'year', 'year', 'could', 'compensate', 'right', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'hand', 'creating', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'specials', 'putting', 'together', 'true', 'Rankin', 'Bass', 'themed', 'extras', 'are', 'beloved', 'so', 'many', 'Otherwise', 'deluxe', 'editions', 'are', 'just', 'shell', 'what', 'should', 'can', 'be', 'Feel', 'free', 'leave', 'comments', 'agree', 'even', 'disagree']",N/A

Siegert,"[5, 7]","I already have the DVD release that contains ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"" and ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"", so I don't know if there is any logical reason why I would want to spend money on this DVD. I know this one is a ""Remastered Deluxe Edition"", but can anyone honestly tell me if the transfer on this DVD is any better than the one paired with the Frosty special? If the picture and sound are really that much better on this presentation, then perhaps I could see myself buying this one, but I just don't understand Warner Bros. decision making in recent years. Why waste so much money on a mass-retail release of a 30-minute TV special with lackluster bonus content? We all know that a pressed DVD is capable of holding much more content than this. I can say the same thing about them giving the 30-minute ""Yogi Bear's All-Star Comedy Christmas Caper"" a mass-retail release and releasing the feature-length ""Yogi's First Christmas"" through the Archive program. But, in terms of Rankin-Bass, I am a little disappointed that a complete set of all 13 WB-owned Christmas specials has not been produced yet. There are two specials given no release of any kind, ""The First Christmas"" and ""The Little Drummer Boy Book II"". There is an Archive release pairing ""The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus"" with ""Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"", but why pair it with Nestor when that special was already given a wide retail release paired with ""The Year Without a Santa Claus""? I don't think anyone at WB even has a clue or really even cares. Their motivation is whatever they can do to make a quick buck.
