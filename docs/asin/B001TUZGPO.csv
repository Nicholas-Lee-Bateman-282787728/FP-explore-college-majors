1237521,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B001TUZGPO,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[0, 0]",I have never been a big fan of Notorious B.I.G. when it comes to a musical aspect. I always respected him but he never appealed to me and I always felt 2Pac was a lot better then him. I finally decided to give this DVD a chance to rent from my library and I have to say it surprised me and I enjoyed it allot. I learned a lot that I did not know about B.I.G. including that he was being held on a gun charge with his friend and instead of letting him take the fall even though it was B.I.G. gun he went to prison for over 3 years. This was huge at the time cause it let B.I.G. catch his big break and he did. I will say that I think the actor that played B.I.G. was one that looked a lot like him but I feel he could have been a better actor. Because of the way he looked it was hard to take him serious sometimes when he got angry. They also did a decent job covering the 2Pac and Notorious B.I.G. feud. I feel they could have done more when 2Pac was still alive to describe it but it was still a solid effort put forth. At the same time I feel it was told more from the side of B.I.G. instead of being impartial. Overall the B.I.G movie is one you should check out. I am going to give it 3.5/5 stars and a recommendation to rent the movie if you get a chance.,3,Notorious is a well told story and a 3.5/5 star DVD,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1261,"['have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'when', 'musical', 'aspect', 'always', 'respected', 'never', 'appealed', 'always', 'felt', '2Pac', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'finally', 'decided', 'give', 'DVD', 'chance', 'rent', 'library', 'have', 'say', 'surprised', 'enjoyed', 'allot', 'learned', 'lot', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'B.I.G', 'including', 'was', 'being', 'held', 'gun', 'charge', 'friend', 'instead', 'letting', 'take', 'fall', 'even', 'was', 'B.I.G', 'gun', 'went', 'prison', '3', 'years', 'was', 'huge', 'time', 'cause', 'let', 'B.I.G', 'catch', 'big', 'break', 'did', 'will', 'say', 'think', 'actor', 'played', 'B.I.G', 'was', 'one', 'looked', 'lot', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'actor', 'way', 'looked', 'was', 'hard', 'take', 'serious', 'sometimes', 'when', 'got', 'angry', 'also', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'covering', '2Pac', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'feud', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'when', '2Pac', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'describe', 'was', 'still', 'solid', 'effort', 'put', 'forth', 'same', 'time', 'feel', 'was', 'told', 'more', 'side', 'B.I.G', 'instead', 'being', 'impartial', 'B.I.G', 'movie', 'one', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'am', 'going', 'give', '3.5/5', 'stars', 'recommendation', 'rent', 'movie', 'get', 'chance']",Notorious

1237524,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001TUZGPO,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'm not really all that into rap (I like it, but I don't love it), but there is no denying that Notorious B.I.G. was, and will always remain, one of the best acts in the history of rap music.  His flow, his fire, his passion rang true in every lyric he spit into the mic, and he sold me with each and every song.The world of music (not just rap) will forever miss the entity that was Christopher Wallace.I will admit that when the biopic was released in honor of Biggie Smalls `all too short but oh so meaningful' career I was an immediate skeptic.  How could they pull this off and do it right?  I'm all for the biopic (undeniably one of my favorite film genres), but there are so many musician biopics out there, and they generally fall into the same pot-holes and thus become increasingly generic.  The look and feel presented in the trailer read `elongated music video' and that turned me off, so I avoided it.  I happened to stumble across this film the other night while browsing the tube and I figured I'd give it a shot.  I'm kind of on the fence here.  Overall, the film really is a gigantic clich&eacute;, one that I think makes light of the powerful presence that was Notorious B.I.G., but on the other hand, the film is genuinely entertaining and sports a rather remarkable lead performance.The life of Christopher Wallace may seem rather generic.  He was a bright young kid who got derailed by circumstance.  He grew up in a poor and dangerous neighborhood and turned to drugs.  He spent time in prison, fathered a baby and then got a big break that changed his life.  He spilled his heart out in the studio and on the stage, creating an instant fan-base thanks to his effortlessly captivating flow.  He wasn't so lucky in the lady department (well, I guess it all depends on how you look at it), leaving his baby-mama, starting a relationship with Lil' Kim, marrying Faith Evans and then two-timing her with whoever, whenever, but there was never any doubt that Wallace was a good-hearted person.The film itself can't help but feel like a clich&eacute;, so much so that the audience gets a case of deja-vu while watching.  That said, a film of this nature kind of relies on the performances the elevate the material, to make it gripping and heartfelt.  Overall, this is a tad uneven.  Most of the performances nail the `every day persona' of these characters, but it's hard to deliver a stage presence that can capture the real essence of stars like Lil' Kim and Faith Evans.  As great as Naturi Naughton is (and as hot as she is), she just can't really capture the phenomenon that Lil' Kim is on the stage.  Her swagger comes off a tad forced.  In her intimate scenes with Woolard, she sells it (hook, line and sinker).  Derek Luke just comes off awkward and thus Puffy becomes a caricature.  I mean, he kind of is that way in real life, but it just felt one-dimensional in a film format.But, thankfully, Jamal Woolard is no caricature.  No, Woolard infuses every scene with a real essence of who Biggie was.  You feel his internal struggle, and despite some rough scripting (some of the dialog seems stilted and unnatural) he manages to make Wallace feel real and relatable.  Top that off with a ferocious stage presence and ability behind the mic that makes me anxious for him to drop a rap record and you have a performance that deserves to be recognized.In the end I can say that `Notorious' was a valiant effort (the closing footage was a nice touch) but it misses a lot of marks that could have made this even more compelling.  It feels too familiar and that aspect leaves one of the greatest and most iconic musical giants appearing rather small, when nothing about Biggie was small.",3,Nice try...,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,3705,"[""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'all', 'rap', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'denying', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'was', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'one', 'best', 'acts', 'history', 'rap', 'music', 'flow', 'fire', 'passion', 'rang', 'true', 'lyric', 'mic', 'sold', 'song.The', 'world', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'rap', 'will', 'forever', 'miss', 'entity', 'was', 'Christopher', 'Wallace.I', 'will', 'admit', 'when', 'biopic', 'was', 'released', 'honor', 'Biggie', 'Smalls', 'too', 'short', 'so', 'meaningful', 'career', 'was', 'immediate', 'skeptic', 'How', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'do', 'right', ""'m"", 'biopic', 'undeniably', 'one', 'favorite', 'film', 'genres', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'musician', 'biopics', 'there', 'generally', 'fall', 'same', 'pot-holes', 'thus', 'become', 'increasingly', 'generic', 'look', 'feel', 'presented', 'trailer', 'read', 'elongated', 'music', 'video', 'turned', 'off', 'avoided', 'happened', 'stumble', 'film', 'other', 'night', 'browsing', 'tube', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', ""'m"", 'kind', 'fence', 'here', 'Overall', 'film', 'really', 'gigantic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'one', 'think', 'light', 'powerful', 'presence', 'was', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G.', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'genuinely', 'entertaining', 'sports', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'lead', 'performance.The', 'life', 'Christopher', 'Wallace', 'may', 'seem', 'rather', 'generic', 'was', 'bright', 'young', 'kid', 'who', 'got', 'derailed', 'circumstance', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'dangerous', 'neighborhood', 'turned', 'drugs', 'spent', 'time', 'prison', 'fathered', 'baby', 'then', 'got', 'big', 'break', 'changed', 'life', 'spilled', 'heart', 'out', 'studio', 'stage', 'creating', 'instant', 'fan-base', 'thanks', 'effortlessly', 'captivating', 'flow', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'lucky', 'lady', 'department', 'well', 'guess', 'how', 'look', 'leaving', 'baby-mama', 'starting', 'relationship', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'marrying', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'then', 'two-timing', 'whoever', 'whenever', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'Wallace', 'was', 'good-hearted', 'person.The', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'clich', 'eacute', 'so', 'much', 'audience', 'case', 'deja-vu', 'watching', 'said', 'film', 'nature', 'kind', 'relies', 'performances', 'elevate', 'material', 'make', 'gripping', 'heartfelt', 'Overall', 'tad', 'uneven', 'Most', 'performances', 'nail', 'day', 'persona', ""'"", 'characters', 'hard', 'deliver', 'stage', 'presence', 'can', 'capture', 'real', 'essence', 'stars', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'As', 'great', 'Naturi', 'Naughton', 'as', 'hot', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'capture', 'phenomenon', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'stage', 'swagger', 'off', 'tad', 'forced', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'Woolard', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'just', 'off', 'awkward', 'thus', 'Puffy', 'caricature', 'mean', 'kind', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'felt', 'one-dimensional', 'film', 'format.But', 'thankfully', 'Jamal', 'Woolard', 'caricature', 'No', 'Woolard', 'scene', 'real', 'essence', 'who', 'Biggie', 'was', 'feel', 'internal', 'struggle', 'rough', 'scripting', 'dialog', 'stilted', 'unnatural', 'make', 'Wallace', 'feel', 'real', 'relatable', 'Top', 'off', 'ferocious', 'stage', 'presence', 'ability', 'mic', 'anxious', 'drop', 'rap', 'record', 'have', 'performance', 'be', 'recognized.In', 'end', 'can', 'say', 'Notorious', 'was', 'valiant', 'effort', 'closing', 'footage', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'lot', 'marks', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'too', 'familiar', 'aspect', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'iconic', 'musical', 'giants', 'appearing', 'rather', 'small', 'when', 'nothing', 'Biggie', 'was', 'small']",Notorious

1237526,A1L0W5MGW0TKWV,B001TUZGPO,"C. Logan ""Missy""","[12, 18]","I was overjoyed when I first heard they were making a film about the life of rapper Christopher ""Biggie"" Wallace. I'm a huge fan of his music, and I thought a biography about the famous rapper was long overdue. However, I don't think the film reached its full potential in essence. It could've been something great, but it settled for mediocrity instead.Director George Tillman uses lots of flashy, glossy shots and camera angles for each scene. Biggie was a man who grew up as a drug dealer and hustler. Nothing about his life growing up was glamorous or flashy. So I expected a less glossy, more raw approach to the film; especially the scenes of him as a child in Brooklyn. The movie didn't focus on Biggie's trials and hardships as much as they could've. Instead they chose to spend more time focusing on scenes with Biggie in clubs partying, on stage rapping, or in one scene...him getting pleased by 2-3 different women. The film should've cut back on these type of glamorous, luxury driven scenes, and focused more on the story of Christopher Wallace.Some of the casting was flawed as well. None of the actors looked like the people they portrayed. The worst was Derek Luke's portrayal of Sean ""Puffy"" Combs. It's bad enough that the actor looked absolutely nothing like him. He was far more attractive. But it's even worse that Puffy took his role as executive producer and made his character in the film out to be a saint. When all of the other characters in the film were smoking blunts, Puffy was in the back making beats. When Biggie felt uninspired or encountered any kind of trouble, Puffy was the voice of reason; offering inspirational advice and encouragement. Puffy wanted to look as innocent as possible in this film. And he used his power as executive producer to make that happen. We all know he wasn't the saint he appeared to be in the movie. Who was he trying to fool?I was a little disappointed in Angela Bassett's portrayal of Ms. Wallace as well. Bassett is a fantastic actress. This we all know. But she wasn't quite right for this role. The thing that bothered me the most was the way her Jamaican accent faded in and out throughout the entire film. One minute it was present, the next it was completely gone. The real Ms. Wallace has a very strong, prominent Jamaican accent. Bassett struggled to bring that accent to life. She didn't look or sound anything like the woman. And because of this, I didn't find her role the slightest bit believable.There were also countless plot holes and unexplained storylines. How about some more information on Big's father. He left when Biggie was  young. And that's really all we know and are told in the film. Who was Biggie's first baby's mother and how did they meet? We didn't see her at all until she popped up and said she was pregnant, which literally seemed to come out of the blue with zero explaination or development. Some more development into the Biggie/Faith relationship would've been nice too. The film wants us to believe that Lil Kim was Biggie's whore, while Faith was the woman he truly loved and wanted to settle with. And yet, the movie features more scenes and development between Biggie and Lil Kim than Biggie and Faith. I found that strange.For a movie that was nearly over 2 hours long--it left too many unexplained questions. Instead they spent most of the film showing Biggie on stage rapping. Which was okay every now and then, but these scenes would last up to 3-4 minutes, which was completely unecessary.There are some good attributes to the film, however. I was pleasantly surprised by Naturi Naughton's portrayal of Lil Kim. It was right on point; convincing and believable, especially during the scenes where she rapped Lil Kim's lyrics. She had the walk, talk, and essence of Lil Kim down to perfection.Jamal Woolard's portrayal of Biggie was also a nice surprise. His voice was damn near identical to the rapper's. He also had his movement and mannerisms completely memorized, right down to the heavy breathing. I thought it was a good debut role for an unknown actor.Overall, Notorious had its good points and bad points. Most of the casting was poor. The guy who played 2Pac was so unbelievable in the role it was almost comical. The direction and cinematography for the film was flashy and over-glossed. It didn't take the raw, gritty approach it should've. But at the same time, there were some real gems in this film. Jamal and Naturi's character portrayals were pleasant surprises. But even they couldn't save this movie from its numerous plot holes and unexplained storylines.",2,Not as good as it could've been...,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,4589,"['was', 'overjoyed', 'when',

English subtitles will also be available for the deaf and hard of hearing.Picture quality for ""Notorious"" looked amazing as you can see the skin pores quite clearly on high definition but what is most amazing is how New York was captured on film.  From the beauty of the city to its gritty side, the level of vibrancy in the colors, beautiful cinematography and wonderful editing really made this biopic come alive.As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio.

For one, Ms. Wallace was very instrumental for the film but what I enjoyed abut this commentary and hearing his co-managers talk is them actually chiming in what was different in terms of the real Chris Wallace and the version portrayed on the film.  Small situations such as when Chris goes to prison for the first time, his first and only call is to his mother and for Chris, panicking he cusses.  His mother was clear that her son knew better than to cuss around her and never did.  So, that was quite interesting to hear.* Behind the Scenes: ""Making of Notorious"" Featurette - (27:22) Interviews with Voletta Wallace, Director Frank Tillman, Jr., Christopher Wallace's friends and the talent.

I also thought that it was so touching for Biggie's son, Christopher Jordan Wallace playing his father at a young age.  The young man did a great job portraying his father.Angela Bassett really showcased Voletta Wallace's strength and caring for her son as a single mother and portrayed her quite well with emotion of happiness, sadness, anger, etc.  Bassett definitely gave a powerful performance especially capturing the moment when Voletta realized how important her son's music was to his fans.Derek Luke also portrayed Sean ""Puffy"" Combs quite well and capturing his mannerisms, especially onstage and doing Puffy's dance moves.You also have give credit to Biggie's entourage as Dennis L.A. White did a great job as Damion ""D-Roc"" Butler, capturing the time they were hustling on the streets and then afterward as a friend and being there when he died.  Marc John Jeffries as Lil Cease as Biggie's small friend but with a big heart and always there for him.  Also, Kevin Phillips as Biggie's manager Mark, did a good job showing his concern and for his sake, as well as his mother's sake, taking care of him.The ladies in Biggie's life was well played by Antonique Smith as Faith Evans, Amanda Christopher as Keisha and Naturi Naughton as Lil Kim.  Antonique having an impressive voice and having grown up listening and singing Faith Evans songs, definitely brought her beauty to the film.  Naturi Naughton as Lil Kim was well-cast, especially for the actress showcasing the actual talent's sexiness and how she became the sex-driven hip hop artist.  That was quite interesting to know.Well-cast and again, kudos to the crew for making sure these talents got down the mannerisms of their real counterparts.Another major positive for the film is the cinematography and editing.  Cinematography and capturing New York in a variety of forms from the area Biggie grew up to capturing the buildings and bridges and overall, Brooklyn.  Director of Photography Michael Grady (""Wonderland"", ""Hotel for Dogs"", etc.) did a phenomenal job.  Editing was also done very well by Dirk Westervelt (""Journey to the Center of the Earth"").  Cuts are tight and just the overall amount of editing from capturing New York to the live performances and making sure you feel the energy of the performance was well captured in the final cut.And last, this film would not be successful without the well-written script by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker, who knew Biggie Smalls and worked with his family and friends in making sure they got certain parts as accurate as they can.  Overall, pacing of the story was just right and made you care for the characters.If there was anything negative that I found, the film tends to focus on the more positive sides of Christopher Lawrence and less on his well-publicized bad-boy past which he has gotten in trouble for.  Aside from the drug dealing, Lawrence has had some major problems in his life with the law that were not shown in the film.  But then again, there were so many layers that needed to be covered in the overall film such as his many relations with the women in his life, his best friends, his manager and other performers, if anything, the people who made this film are those who loved the man for what he did for them and the music he created for people.  He touched a lot of lives and this film produced by the people most close to him, wanted to celebrate that.I just can help but be amazed by how much is on this blu-ray disc.  You get the original theatrical and unrated director's cut, you get a digital download disc, you get a film showcasing the beauty of New York and the gritty side of the city with amazing picture quality.Audio quality was just great especially with the music of Notorious B.I.G. and hearing the subwoofer's lower frequency and the bass drum making things sound amazing during the musical segments.  Audio is crystal clear and easily understood.And of course, the Blu-ray features many special features with in-depth footage of the making of this film and getting to learn about the life of Christopher ""Biggie"" Wallace and also the heartbreaking scenes of his murder and having to shoot those scenes for the film.  Also, kudos to the idea of including Voletta Wallace for the commentary segment a reality.  Just a nice touch to hear Biggie's mother speak about certain scenes and about her son.Suffice to say, you're getting your money's worth with this Blu-ray release.  Awesome picture quality, magnificent audio and jam-packed with features.  I give ""NOTORIOUS - UNRATED DIRECTOR'S CUT"" a high recommendation and for Biggie fans, this Blu-ray disc is definitely worth having in your collection!",5,"Well-cast, beautiful cinematography, very

I remember listening to B.I.G when I was 14 years old, everything hes ever done was lyrically amazing to me.  I saw the trailer for this movie and was really excited to see it.First let me say I picked this up on Blu Ray, and the quality is top notch!  The on screen visuals are excellent, faces are perfect tone, and really glow!  whites are bright, blacks are dark and inky, excellent all around picture quality is definitely present in this disc.Sound is also amazing with a 5.1 DTS HD soundtrack that really shines when you get the studio scenes, bass is deep, mids are razor sharp, and highs are crystal clear.  The dialogue also comes over perfectly, with no problems hearing conversations over background music or ambient sounds.Now onto the movie...if I had to use one word it would be breathtaking!  I came into this movie expecting nothing more than 8 Mile (which I really disliked) and about on level with Get Rich Or Die Trying (another movie I wasn't a fan of) I guess I based this on the fact that Chris wasn't here to act his own character, I read James Woolard (Notorious) had never acted before...and was a bit skeptical as to the performance he would give, to my surprise it was JAW DROPPING!Everything from the voice to the look was spot on, and I couldn't wait to hear him speak, it just reminded me of that awesome voice he has on all his tracks.  The characters playing Sean ""puffy"" Combs, Lil Kim, Faith Evans, and D-Roc, were all amazing, and wonderfully acted!The story is heartwarming and at times hard to swallow, but to my amazement the amount of ""gang"" related material was almost non existent, which is a nice change from movies like Hustle and Flow, and Get Rich Or Die Trying...every scene seemed like somebody was fighting or getting shot.In my honest opinion, even if your not a fan of Hip Hop, or Notorious B.I.G for that matter, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie!  I'm not gonna give any story details away, only the fact that the script, and acting is excellent!

1237553,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001TUZGPO,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","***1/2The biopic ""Notorious,"" directed by George Tillman Jr., tells of the life and career of Notorious B.I.G., the gangsta' rapper who was gunned down on the streets of L.A. at the age of twenty-four.  B.I.G. began life as Christopher Wallace, a kid being raised by a single mother in Brooklyn who, despite her best efforts, was unable to keep her son from falling prey to the destructive influences of life on the street.  For by the age of twelve, he had already begun dealing drugs and, by seventeen, had dropped out of school and served time in prison on a weapons charge.  But it was his talent for rapping - for putting into words and music his reflections on what it meant to be a black man living in the inner city - that brought him to the attention of Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, founder of Bad Boy Records, who signed Wallace, now known as Biggie Smalls, to his first recording contract.Soon, B.I.G. was a major figure in the gangsta' rap scene, adored by his fans, hated by his enemies and partaking in the fruits of all that the ""high life"" of a mass market celebrity had to offer: namely, wealth, fame, fashion, women, and an unlimited access to guns and drugs.  But as with all such tales, it would seem, Biggie ultimately found himself on an irreversible slide towards self-destruction, culminating in his assassination on Wilshire Boulevard on March 9, 1997, a victim, in part, of the life he lived and of outside forces he was simply unable to control (his killers, incidentally, were never identified).""Notorious"" is less interesting for the admittedly rather predictable cautionary tale and domestic drama it relates than for the glimpses it affords us into the hip-hop and gangsta' rap scene of the 1990s.  The sounds and fashions of the culture are successfully recreated on screen, backed by generous helpings of B.I.G.'s music that come in the form of stage performances and background accompaniment for much of the action.The film really hits its stride when it focuses on the famed and ultimately bloody feud that developed between Bad Boys Records on the East Coast and Death Row Records on the West, whose figurehead, Tupac Shakur, came to believe that B.I.G. had a hand in a botched attempt on his life.  This real-life thug opera that played itself out in the media ultimately turned deadly when, first, Tupac, and then B.I.G. himself met similar fates at the barrel of a gun.The movie is most notable for the performance of rapper Jamal Woodard in the title role, who not only looks amazingly like the original Biggie but manages to sound quite a bit like him as well.  It is Woodard who makes B.I.G. both the larger-than-life figure and the regular human being he needs to be to be believable.

In fact, it is the scenes between mother and son that ultimately serve as the heart and soul of the movie.For purposes of mass consumption and in the interest of burnishing B.I.G.'s posthumous reputation, the screenplay by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker provides a sunnier and more upbeat assessment  of the man's final days than is, perhaps, warranted by the facts, but those who made the movie can't really be blamed for wanting to cast their subject in the most positive light possible, especially in the summary moments.

1237556,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B001TUZGPO,Sky,"[1, 1]","Wow. Talk about a guy born to play a role....Did Jamal Woolard absolutely nail the part of The Notorious B.I.G. or what?!? Watching Woolard in Notorious was like looking into a magic window that let you see Biggie Smalls back in the days of his rise to fame and ultimate untimely death.Unfortunately, while Woolard shined in his role of Christopher Wallace, a.k.a Biggie Smalls, a.k.a The Notorious B.I.G., the rest of the cast was fair to good at best, and the story was a bit one-sided and breezed over or just plain skipped a lot of details.Instead of focusing on Biggie's music and the infamous East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry of the mid-nineties, the movie focused mostly on Biggie's personal life and how what was going on around him affected him mentally--giving only snippets of the stories and leaving much of the detail out of what was going on around him. And the telling of these stories was, in my opinion, extremely one-sided and sketchy.My guess is that the producers of Notorious decided that the movie was to be a tribute to Biggie--making him out to be somewhat of a saint--and not a documentary that would not only have made Biggie look a bit thuggish, but also would have needed to do the same with others in the East-West rivalry. It would have been a very difficult movie to make if more detail were included on ""the why"" and ""the how"" of the rivalry versus just the personal affect it had on Biggie. No, I can't imagine the producers wanted to start portraying Biggie as a cause of his own death any more than they would have wanted to directly point the finger at an individual (like Suge Knight) or group like the LA gangs.So what you get with Notorious is a relatively soft view into the story of the East-West coast rivalry. You also get only a limited look at Biggie's music and the making of it. But you get a heavy dose of a kinder-gentler Biggie and that part of his personal life.If you like The Notorious B.I.G. and / or have any awareness of the East-West rivalry thing, and you want a one-sided view of how it all went down, you should enjoy as I did this interesting movie.

1237560,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001TUZGPO,Turfseer,"[9, 15]","'Notorious' is the story of Christopher Wallace aka Biggie Smalls who became one of the most popular rap artists in the 1990s until he was gun downed at the very young age of 24. Biggie is played by newcomer Jamal Woolard who does a decent job playing Wallace, considering he never acted before.The first 45 minutes of the film are the most interesting as it focuses on Biggie's early career as a drug dealer. He's constantly arguing with his mother (played by the always solid Angela Bassett) who finally throws him out of the house after he won't give up his drug-dealing ways. Eventually he lands in jail where he starts writing rap lyrics which he eventually fashions into full-fledged songs in the recording studio. The era is ably recreated as we're given a sense of how rap music developed during the 1980s and early 90s.After his release from jail, Biggie starts building a reputation as a talented rapper in his Brooklyn neighborhood. He becomes a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of up and coming producer Sean ""Puffy"" Combs (one of the producers of the movie) who takes him under his wing. When Puffy is fired, Biggie goes back to drug-dealing only to find himself arrested again. This time however, a friend offers to take the rap on a gun charge and Biggie has a second chance to resume his career.The rest of the movie chronicles Biggie's eventual rise to the top. I was a little uncertain as to how Biggie actually got there. At one point he's 'paying his dues' playing college gigs at places like Howard University. The next thing you know he's got a number one hit record.If one is to believe the screenwriters, despite Biggie's involvement in the violent world of rap music, he was really a big Teddy Bear at heart. He's a character who can basically do no wrong. Even though he cheats on the three women he's closest to (the mother of his child, his wife and Lil Kim, fellow rap artist and lover), they all forgive this Teddy Bear despite his boorish behavior.Notorious lacks a central external antagonist who Biggie is pitted against throughout the movie. If there is an antagonist, it's got to be Tupac Shakur, the West Coast rapper who had a falling out with Biggie after he was shot outside a NYC recording studio. There are few dramatic scenes between Biggie and Tupac in Notorious and the relationship is mainly fleshed out through the use of an off-screen narrator. While Biggie admires Tupac as a philosopher and activist, he also perceives him as a loose cannon. According to Biggie's version, after Tupac was shot for the first time, he became completely paranoid and believed everyone was after him (including Biggie).As Biggie tells it, he made attempts to reconcile with Tupac but it never really worked out. Meanwhile the media played up the ""East Coast-West Coast rivalry"" which may have eventually led to the assassination of both Tupac and Biggie. The 'rivalry' is explained through a montage sequence which made me feel I was watching a documentary and not a feature film.The second half of Notorious mainly involves Biggie's internal struggles, particularly in the area of becoming a more responsible adult. Again, if you believe the screenwriters, despite acting irresponsibly with women and immersing himself in the thuggish, materialistic world of rap music (an involvement in a world which eventually led to his death), Biggie managed to stay 'above the fray'. The point is made that his second (and last) album revealed a more 'sensitive' side and that he was turning away from violence right before he died.One gets a feeling that the writers of Notorious have little information as to Biggie's dealings in his behind the scenes business world. Certainly they offer no theories as to who did him in. Instead, we're treated to all the histrionics of his volatile relationships with women (which basically proves that he was a 'ladies man' and nothing much else). By focusing mainly on his relations with women, we only get to see one side of Biggie and I didn't feel this was a complete, rounded picture.Probably the weakest character in the film is Puffy Combs. Since he's one of the film's producers, it's not in his interest to suggest anything controversial about his own character. Thus, Derek Luke has little to do in this film except act the part of a glorified cheerleader.Notorious touches on all the bases of Christopher Wallace's life. For those unfamiliar with all the details, it's a modestly interesting and somewhat entertaining story. Nonetheless, the filmmakers chose to place their protagonist on a pedestal. By doing so, they imply that Biggie was detached from the violent world which he was a part of. That somehow he was an unsuspecting victim who had nothing to do with his own demise. The truth was probably somewhere in the middle--that at times he could be Biggie the Teddy Bear and at other times, Biggie the Thug. Instead of a hagiography, Notorious needed to present more of a balanced portrait but it settled for an excessively sentimental and by the numbers treatment which earns it an average ""3"" in my
