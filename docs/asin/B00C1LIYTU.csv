I would LOVE to buy complete seasons of old-school Disney Channel shows but everytime, you get a DVD with 6 or 7 episodes which is annoying.

It is great for preteen and teen children.  They can dance with the DVD with Austin and Alley.  Austin's the extroverted musician and singer.  Alley is a brilliant but very shy songwriter.  But after Austin performs Alley's song in a video that goes viral, the two combine their talents.  The two and their good friends chase after their dreams and have hilarious adventures.  I recommend this Disney Channel Movie to middle and high school age children.",5,Really is all the right moves!,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,549,"['Making', 'music', 'biz', 'very', 'hard', 'Austin', 'Alley', ""'re"", 'going', 'top', 'great', 'preteen', 'teen', 'children', 'can', 'dance', 'DVD', 'Austin', 'Alley', 'Austin', 'extroverted', 'musician', 'singer', 'Alley', 'brilliant', 'very', 'shy', 'songwriter', 'Austin', 'Alley', 'song', 'video', 'viral', 'two', 'combine', 'talents', 'two', 'good', 'friends', 'chase', 'dreams', 'have', 'hilarious', 'adventures', 'recommend', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Movie', 'middle', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'children']",Austin & Ally: All the Write Moves!
