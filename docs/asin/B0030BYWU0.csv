1315197,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B0030BYWU0,Paul Jutras,"[10, 12]","while there are other top favorite episodes I wish could of made this DVD it has a large number of ones I really enjoy. Based on the children book series this DVD helps little kids learn vocabulary words while older kids will find enjoyable strictly from an entertainment stand point.  Being the first DVD to be release of the series however I was surprise that the episode MARTHA SPEAKS where Martha starts talking for the first time wasn't included here.  What are including among the 8 fifteen minute episodes that include TD, Helen and Martha trying to get pass a dog hating janitor to switch art drawings, Martha trying to make up for her past mistakes by doing something nice for grandma on her birthday but have trouble finding the right gift. Martha delivers flowers from the flower shop to a haunted house and sends TD, Helen and Martha into the type of spooky hi jinx you'd expect from the Hardy Boys. Martha learns about being a racist in a family friendly manner when Alice and Helen is making a fuss over a kitten.  When Truman says he never eat ice cream Alice goes above and beyond being annoying to try to make him eat it.  Helen and her family learn that while Alphabet soup makes Martha talks eating Helen's music home work makes her sing and she tries everything and ask everyone to try to find someone to stop her singing.  TD and his school friends form a neighborhood band. unfortunately they only know one song.

1315202,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0030BYWU0,Z Hayes,"[1, 2]","My six-year-old daughter loves reading, and loves learning new vocabulary. It was not too long ago that she and I discovered the PBS Kids' program, ""Martha Speaks"". The show is about a dog named Martha who gains the gift of speaking after she eats some alphabet soup. She has plenty of adventures with her best buddy Skits (another dog) and several other neighborhood animals and people. There are eight episodes on this DVD, i.e. Raiders of the Lost Art, Says It With Flowers, Martha Gets Spooked, Martha Changes Her Luck, There Goes the Neighborhood, Ice Scream, Martha Sings, and TD Makes the Band.Each episode, like all Martha episodes teaches children vocabulary, and most importantly, teach the use of these words in context. This show is a great teaching resource, and the stories are engaging.
