Unfortunately some of the movie is quite two-dimensional: it is sometimes  difficult to tell why the children love their father and Islam is not  really presented in a very complex or positive light at all.Nonetheless,  the movie is often hilarous, has some great acting from all involved and  has some serious points to make about Asian immigrants in Britain, not to  mention the lives of first-generation immigrants in general.",4,both funny and sad,965174400,"08 2, 2000",2000,793,"['movie', 'reportedly', 'most', 'successful', 'British', 'movie', 'time', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'rare', 'chances', 'U.S.', 'see', 'convincingly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Asians', 'case', 'Pakistanis', 'U.K', 'also', 'really', 'funny', 'times', 'good', 'deal', 'bawdy', 'humor', 'mixed', 'real', 'horrifying', 'scenes', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'quite', 'two-dimensional', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'tell', 'why', 'children', 'love', 'father', 'Islam', 'not', 'really', 'presented', 'very', 'complex', 'positive', 'light', 'all.Nonetheless', 'movie', 'often', 'hilarous', 'great', 'acting', 'involved', 'serious', 'points', 'make', 'Asian', 'immigrants', 'Britain', 'not', 'mention', 'lives', 'first-generation', 'immigrants', 'general']",East Is East VHS

I was worried that this was just another excuse to make fun of white people, as seems to be the formula for most ethnic movies now.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this film, its humour and its message.  Although it is presented as a comedy, its laughs thinly disguise a message of adaption to culture and tolerance.  I enjoyed that they kids are from both the white culture and the Indian culture, as I am.  People like me and the kids in this movie are in a tough spot because they have to choose what they want to be and it is hard to be both.  This movie presented this dilemma in a surprisingly intelligent manner.I would recommed this movie to anyone.  It's really fun and colourful.Also, to the kid who didnt' like this movie because they eat bacon and they're not supposed to.  Well, that's the whole point. They eat the bacon but they have to get rid of the smell so their devout father won't find out.

484970,A365GXQ94C42BC,6305958076,A. Lopez,"[0, 0]","This is one terrific movie. While it centers around a Pakistani father's conflict with Western culture which his children not only embrace but are a part of, it is a universal theme about the cultural conflicts that occur when people from any culture are transplanted to a new and very different way of life. As is always the case the children of immigrants adapt to and want to ""belong"" to the new culture of their friends and neighbors. The parents or parent in this case wants to instill and continue his beliefs and traditions in his children. This is a movie that explores these very real and at times violent conflicts. It does so with touching sentiment as well as wonderful touches of humor. Throughout the film we are both simpathetic as well as angered by the father's behavior toward his children because we see it from our own western perspective.  Yet we come to see that he is driven by real concern and love for his children as well as for his cultural beliefs. We come to see that while it is important to be a part of an adopted culture it is none the less important to preserve those positive elements of our own cultural traditions.

It does have its funny moments, but &quot;East is East&quot; really excels more as a drama than as a comedy.  As mentioned by another reviewer, you watch the father figure George Khan slowly metamorphize from loving father into abusive tyrant.  It's a painful process to watch, but it feels 100% real.

He wants them to be traditional Pakistanis, though the kids have other ideas.  As you'd imagine, this creates many humorous situations.  The direction and sets are very good and the cast is superb.  It's absolutely hysterical to see the red-headed, chain-smoking British Bassett as she shepherds her very unBritish-looking brood.  But the film takes an unexpected and darker turn as George becomes more enraged at his family's disobedience and ultimately reacts with violence.  While his transformation is believable, there is never really a resolution to the tension, so I would recommend this film, but if you are wanting a flat-out comedy or a film that tries to answer the question of how to resolve multicultural conflicts, this would not meet the bill.This is a barebones dvd, with an option for English captioning and a trailer.",4,comedy-drama about the clash of cultures on a barebones dvd,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,1043,"['George', 'Khan', 'Om', 'Puri', 'British', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'are', 'raising', 'family', 'Manchester', 'England', '1971', 'George', 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'children', 'are', 'adapting', 'English', 'homeland', 'be', 'traditional', 'Pakistanis', 'kids', 'have', 'other', 'ideas', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'many', 'humorous', 'situations', 'direction', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'superb', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'see', 'red-headed', 'chain-smoking', 'British', 'Bassett', 'very', 'unBritish-looking', 'brood', 'film', 'unexpected', 'darker', 'turn', 'George', 'more', 'enraged', 'family', 'disobedience', 'ultimately', 'reacts', 'violence', 'transformation', 'believable', 'never', 'really', 'resolution', 'tension', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'are', 'wanting', 'flat-out', 'comedy', 'film', 'answer', 'question', 'how', 'resolve', 'multicultural', 'conflicts', 'would', 'not', 'meet', 'bill.This', 'barebones', 'dvd', 'option', 'English', 'captioning', 'trailer']",East Is East VHS

For the most part English films never seem to surface over here which is a real shame because there are some great ones being made. Sure, &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; was pretty big but for every &quot;Lock, Stock&quot; we also get three counterfeit British films like Notting Hill or Mickey Blue Eyes. There are a number of really excellent movies being made in the UK that unfortunately will never see the time of day; Final Cut with Jude Law, Heart, The Debt Collector etc...&quot;East is East&quot; somehow made it across the pond and believe me when I say that it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. The story centers around the Khan family, and their growing up in 1970's Manchester. George, the Father is a traditional Pakistani who secretly arranges for two of his sons to be married. This causes a rift in the family that results in many hilarious antics and some surprisingly good dramatic scenes.The film's big focus is of course weather or not the son's have the right to choose their own destiny. Having being born and raised in England they are for the most part oppposed to their Father's views.&quot;East is East&quot; is a very effective comedy. The relationship between everyone in the family is perfect and makes for many laughs. Each of the character's are quick witted and clever which is a refreshing change from seeing something from the Adam Sandler school of comedy. Ultimately it is the relationship between all the characters that really makes this movie work well. There is a deep sense of family that is constantly tested by everyone baiting and antagonizing each other.&quot;East is East&quot; is a great little British film that is so much more effective than the overated, crowd pleasing &quot;Full Monty.&quot; If only North America got a great movie from England like this each week we'd be set.

484974,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6305958076,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[7, 9]","Although the film flip-flops and completely loses it's delicate balance right before it concludes, there is enough that is absolutely right to recommend this autobiographical look at a working class Muslim family in Manchester, England.  The humor is warm and genuine, and the inevitable brutality we uncomfortably witness is believable.  The acting is first rate with a couple of marvelous stand out performances.East is East is set near Manchester in 1971.  We meet George Khan (wonderfully played by Om Puri- who played a similar role in the better; My Son the Fanatic) who has one daughter and six sons, runs a fish and chips shop, and tries to control the lives of everyone in his family according to  strict Muslim codes of behavior.  Since he's also trying to be a good Muslim, good businessman, good father and keep up with current events involving the India-Pakistan war, he is not in touch with the details of his children's lives.  In fact he doesn't even realize that his youngest son was never circumcised as is a Muslim tradition. He is also trying to be a good husband for the English woman he loves.  Yes, his children are mixed, they are English and Pakistan.George's children see him as a hypocritical tyrant who screams orders to his family about the proper way to dress, the need to attend Muslim religious school, the necessity of arranged marriages which he himself has turned his back on, since he has left the first Mrs. Khan back in Pakistan.  It's is the Muslim way of things and arranged marriages is how it must be done and George's offspring should not ask questions of how he married their English mom, but get in line and do as they are told.How the family relates to each other is captured well in the opening scene which shows his children naughtily joining a parade of Catholics, while their Mom, Ella (in a powerfully effective performance from Linda Basset), distracts their father George just enough so they can get away with their playful ruse.In an early scene, George's eldest son runs from the alter just prior to wedding a young Pakistan girl in an arranged meeting.  He flees the alter and the family.  Later it's matter-of-factly revealed he's gay and part of a very successful high fashion shop (hats I believe).  To George this son has not just rejected the arranged marriage and become independent, but he has died.The tone that is set is one where humor comes out of very real autobiographical vignettes that seem authentic and realistic.  In fact the film is based on a stage play which has been adapted for the screen by the play write; Ayub Khan-Din.  It's directed by a very confident and assured freshman director, Damien O'Donnel.There are many themes that are woven throughout the film, the clash of traditions versus juvenille rebellion, the importance of family, the racism this family of Pakistani's face from even their neighbors, the sibling rivalries, the pursuit of one's dreams, the dangers of false pride, and the importance of love.All of these things are well balanced through almost the entire film.  The performances are all very strong.  There is an extended sequence involving the youngest boys' need for a circumcision, which is played mostly for humor, but reveals again how dominating George Kahn and his insistence of being a good Muslim family truly is.  There are subplots involving a neighborhood romance which strike just the right type of awkward tone.  There are several comedic moments that arise from the family's living conditions.  Three of the six sons share the same bed.  There is no indoor toilet facilities so pee pots and cast iron tubs are still in use.The film sharply turns to show us a brutal and disturbing scene. It's a scene that feels truthful and makes the film a lot more powerful than the almost light comedy it has been.Unfortunately after the film becomes disturbing it then tries tries to quickly shift back to it's earlier lighter tone.  This attempted shift feels all wrong and left me with many mixed feelings.  If we are indeed being authentic, then the film-makers insisting on trying give the film a feel-good type of ending is utterly hypocritical and false.  Perhaps the  material was mercilessly cut, and several scenes exist on the cutting room floor ( or in the original theatrical play)  that would have made the film play much better.  Or perhaps the film-makers failed to realize just how much impact the bit of brutality we see really has.  It's a pity because when the film tries to switch back it derails and loses it's slice of life honesty to become just another film that only partially lets us peak into the lives of people who are different, yet very much like we are.I am glad however, that ultimately despite the flaws, and disappointing ending (where loose ends are left dangling everywhere) there is a deep lingering sense of the love and commitment that exists in a very strong, very unique marriage -George and Ella's.East is East won the Alexander Korda award for Outstanding British Film at this year's British Academy Awards.  It's almost ironic since George Kahn is based on writer Ayub Khan Din's father who worked as an extra not just on Dam Busters (which is mentioned in East is East) but also on one of Korda's films as well.  Kahn had some problem with racism on the set until Korda sat with Kahn during his lunch breaks.",4,Ethnic Comedy Sharply Turns Serious.,978566400,"01 4, 2001",2001,5363,"['film', 'flip-flops',

484975,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,6305958076,Dai-keag-ity,"[0, 0]","While this film doubtlessly gives realistic insight into the culture shock of a traditional Pakistani man struggling to maintain the customs of his homeland in 1970's England---and to force those same customs onto his assimilating family---what I can't understand is how so many people found this movie to be both heartwarming and comedic. At least that's the billing it got when it was recommended to me by friends, and also how I heard it touted years ago by Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air. The main character here, George Khan, played by India's prolific Om Puri, is among the least sympathetic figures in all of recent cinema, which would be fine if the feeling was he was being set up to be presented that way, but the impression I got was that we were meant to receive him as more of a misguided soul than an abusive tyrant. He beats his wife, alienates his children by among other things seeking to force arranged marriages onto them, is a bigamist (of sorts) and a total bigot who thinks all Indians are evil and out to get him and other Pakistanis, yet the situations and clues in the background music seem determined to dismiss his antics as humorous. So spousal abuse and overseer-like control of children is funny, then, is it? As I watched this film, all I could think of was good riddance to Mr. Khan's traditions and customs, and long live the tolerance we have here in the west.

The humour is terrific - ranging from coarse humour and cheap laughs to subtle jokes about dialect and the period on which the film is set. But the rest of the film is a mature, post-colonial take on the topics of immigration, integration, and miscgenation.The humour in this film is great. The lovely Archie Punjabi and the boys supply most of this, while their parents deal in more serious matters. Om Puri convinces despite being a bit of a stereotyped Pakistani Dad, and the whole film glides along at a cracking pace, thanks to the humour. Despite dealing with serious subjects such as spousal abuse and cultural identity, the humour prevents any dragging.Mr Khan has lived in England for 25 years, and this is significant because 1946 is the year before Indian independence, and a time when many Indians and Pakistanis came to Britain. The second great influx of Asians came in the late 1960s with the independence of Uganda and Kenya and their respective new governments repatriating the Asian communities. These latter immigrants would have formed the lion's share of the Asian Communities in Salford and Bradford, and for this reason Mr Khan is out of place with the recent immigrants (all of whom have more knowledge of Pakistan - formed after his departure from India - than he) just as he has not entirely settled in England (he still only speaks pidgin English, despite being there 25 years).

Set in 1971 in the bleak city of Manchester, this is the story of a biracial family striving to come to terms with their cultural identities. George Khan (Om Puri) believes he is bringing up his seven children to be good Pakistanis but there is rebellion in the ranks, because George's wife Ella (Linda Bassett) is English and her children are as much her offspring as they are their father's despite his attempts to forget this. This film is coarsely vulgar at times, with ribald jokes and innuendo galore but it is also heart warming and genuinely moving and the plot though loose in parts is pulled together by some slick acting and good directing. The storyline follows George and his family as they struggle to come to terms with conflicting interests, such as the headstrong Meenah (Archie Panjabi) whose idea of fun is playing football in the street and eating bacon sandwiches, to Sajid (Jordan Routledge) who hides behind the hood of his dirty waxed jacket, and has yet to be circumcised, much to the horror of his orthodox Muslim father. The film touches many subjects such as arranged marriages, what the right job is for a good Pakistani boy and how do you make East meet West with out a clash of the Titans. With rude words galore, garish colours and a rocking sound track &quot;East is East&quot; is a film that will have you laughing and crying in the same breath.

As a matter of fact, not only does it deserve NO stars, it deserves a couple of puking face icons, along with handfuls of rotten tomatoes!!I seriously can NOT understand how this foul excuse for a movie is getting so many good reviews and high ratings. Either some of the other reviewers are totally blind, or they are completely ignorant of all the gross scenes, and the rampant stereotypes, and pigeon-holing of ethnic groups.""East is East"" which is set in England during the 1970's, is about a Pakistani immigrant, George Khan (Om Puri) a vile, uncouth, and abusive man who is married to Ella (Linda Bassett) a British woman who is almost as repulsive as her husband.George and Ella Khan own a neighborhood fish and chips restaurant, and they have 7 children together, most (if not all) of whom have turned out to be as vulgar and crass as their parents. Rounding out this misfit bunch is Ella's trashy sister, Annie.Eldest son Nazir, was disowned by his father after refusing to go through with an arranged marriage, and literally, leaving his bride standing at the altar. After walking out of his wedding, and being thrown out of his family, all traces of him - photos, mention of his name, etc., were removed from the Khan house. Only his mother and siblings acknowledge his existence with secret phone calls made from distant pay phones to keep the father, George Khan, from finding out.The other Khan children are far more disgusting. While one son, Saleem, uses his dubious artistic ""skills"" to create obscene and revolting pornographic sculptures and drawings, another son, Tariq, spends all his time sneaking off to discos, and making out with British girls, especially the daughter of a virulent racist, who's running for public, political office on an anti-immigrant platform.Sons Abdul and Maneer blend into the background of this awful family with Maneer as the ""goody-two shoes"" and ""brown-nosing suck-up"" to their father, and are only significant in that, they too end up a target of their boorish father's violent rages when they finally try to speak up.Daughter Meenah (Archie Panjabi) is, in my opinion, the least repugnant, and most likable of all the characters - which is not really saying much, since the other characters are like scum in the bottom of a barrel.Being the only daughter in a family of six sons, Meenah is a real tomboy, often playing soccer in the street with the neighborhood boys. As has been mentioned, Meenah's acting abilities are the only saving grace of this film, if there is any to really speak of. It's just a shame that such a talented actress like Archie Panjabi has to be associated with such an asinine and ghastly ""film"" like ""East is East"".Finally, rounding out this hideous family is youngest son, Sajid, who lives in a filthy fur-trimmed parka (a'la Kenny on South Park) and screeches at the top of his lungs when anyone tries to take it off. He is nearly as vile as his father, urinating on the walls of the local school, mosque, and other buildings.The family in this movie reminds me of characters called the Thingumajigs, in a series of children's books (The Thingumajig Book of Manners,Thingumajig Book of Health and Safety,A Thingumajig Christmas,Thingumajig Do's and Don'ts, andSanta Visits the Thingumajigs) by Irene Keller, that my mom used to read to my brother and me growing up. Those of you who know about those books, will definitely be able to identify with their human counterparts in this movie.I would SERIOUSLY avoid this movie like the Bubonic Plague, which this film probably carries. This movie is just plain AWFUL!! Avoid it at all costs! It is a stereotypical pile of rubbish!If you want to see GOOD movies about the Indian sub-continent, I recommend watching ""Bhaji on the Beach"", ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Bend it Like Beckham"". ""East is East"" portrays NOTHING accurate about Asians, or the Islamic culture in general.Director Damien O'Donnell clearly knows NOTHING about Indians & Pakistanis, or Muslims, and its easy to see that he has done NO research whatsoever into the subject. No meaningful study of Islamic laws and teachings, and Asian traditions.For one thing, in one scene, while the parents are out, the children cook and eat bacon and sausage at home. BACON & SAUSAGE!Apparently the director, and creators of this film are too ignorant to know, but Islam forbids the consumption of pork!Now even though the Khan children were eating the bacon and sausage in defiance of their father's Islamic beliefs, there is NO way that any Asian, Indian/Pakistani or Muslim child would eat it blatantly, out in the open like that, in their parents home. It would be considered like the ultimate disrespect and dishonor to their culture and their heritage.So if they were going to defy the Islamic tenets and eat pork products, they would eat it secretly, away from home, in some distant restaurant, or other far-off place where they would not be seen. They would not disrespect their family, by eating pork at home where they would bring their parents shame and dishonor.It is obvious that instead of doing his own independent research, director Damien O'Donnell has just taken all the stereotypes, myths, and mis-information about Muslims and Asians, and has just cobbled them together to make this movie.""East is East"" is the WORST POSSIBLE film to use in developing an opinion about Asians. It is worse than a caricature. I have never seen anyone - Asian, Muslim, or otherwise, act like that - so loutish, uncouth, and vulgar.Furthermore, I seriously wonder if the director, Damien O'Donnell, is some kind of fetishist. Because, even though this film is set in the 1970's, years after the development and widespread use of indoor plumbing, this family still does not seem to have it installed in their home, and there are excessive and graphic scenes of various characters urinating into chamber pots.I mean, practically every other scene or so has someone going to the bathroom on-screen. Literally on-screen! It is just disgusting!! One would think that in the 1970's, they would be using regular indoor toilets instead of pots in the corner.

The father, played by Om Puri, is Pakistani; the mother, played by Linda Basset, is English. They have seven children between the ages of 13 and 24 and run a fish and chips shop in a working class neighborhood. With a mixture of comedy and pathos, we feel the father's frustration as he tries to instill traditional Pakistani values into his family. Naturally they rebel as they are being raised in England and don't even speak their father's language. Each of the children copes in his or her own way, and there are some moments of hilarious comedy as the father tries to arrange marriages for his sons. But behind the humor, there's sadness, and I especially felt sorry for the 13 year-old boy who is forced to be circumcised. Mostly, the children want to be English and when the father becomes abusive to the mother, even the son who opted to be Muslim rebels against the father.Acting is wonderful. Om Puri makes the audience both laugh at him and understand his grief. And the rest of the casting feels genuine. I was troubled about a few things though. One was the simple fact that there was no indoor plumbing and there are a lot of scenes including urinating in chamber pots. Another was that the joke is always on the Pakistanis; the father looks like a fool over and over again. We laugh at him and are angry at him and even understand him a little bit. But he doesn't get any sympathy and we learn nothing positive about the Pakistani culture. If I were Pakistani, I'd be angry. I did enjoy the story and the acting. But it's a bit too painful to be a comedy. And it just doesn't work as a drama.

484991,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305958076,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 4]","`East is East,' something of a modern day version of `Fiddler on the  Roof,' explores the culture clash that occurs in the context of a half  Pakistani/half British family living in early 1970's England. George Khan  is a Muslim who, upon immigrating to Great Britain in 1937, married a  British woman despite the fact that his first wife still lives in Pakistan.  Now, twenty five years later, the still happily married couple lives in a  small apartment with their daughter and six sons all of whom have been  raised to honor their father's religion and traditions. Yet, like Tevye,  George is suddenly confronted with the fact that, as times change and the  world moves on, the younger generation will no longer abide by the archaic  rituals of an ancient age. In many ways, this is the flip side of `Fiddler'  in that here the reluctant marriage partners are sons and not daughters.  For indeed, George's ultimate goal in life is to arrange marriages for his  teenaged sons within the accepted tradition of the Muslim faith. But  culture is often a force that parents try in vain to withstand and these  children, raised in the far more open and liberated society of `mod'  England, are not about to take such dictatorial parental control lying  down.In the script based on his play, Ayub Khan-Din provides an  evenhanded and comprehensive view of the situation. George is not presented  to us as an inflexible or unreasonable ogre, yet at the same time, he will,  in his frustration, strike out even physically at the children and the wife  who seem to oppose him. We sense the fear that runs through him that, if  his sons are allowed to exercise their freedom in this one crucial area,  the family will sever that connection with the past which brings stability  to their lives. Thus, without any traditions to anchor them, George dreads  that he and the family will be cut adrift in a seemingly rudderless world  that suddenly seems in the 1970's to be in such great and terrifying moral  flux. Moreover, we are left to ponder the strange contradiction between  George's own words and the choices he himself has made. After all, his  opting to marry a British woman who does not share the tenets of his faith  obviously went beyond the bounds of the very traditions he is now so  dogmatically insisting his sons uphold. This type of ambiguity within the  characters enhances their credibility, for indeed life and the people we  meet therein come replete with such maddening inconsistencies.Khan-Din  and director Damien O'Donnell establish an effective balance between  low-key humor and occasionally searing drama. The relationship between the  husband and wife who comprise this interracial marriage is complexly  realized and fully drawn; the obvious difficulties the two have experienced  as a result of the nonconformity of their union has obviously strengthened  their devotion to one another and they appear to greatly enjoy each other's  company. She has undoubtedly made any number of concessions and compromises  to her husband's belief system, yet she has retained her British feistiness  and knows how far to let George go before she draws the line, especially  when it comes to protecting the rights and happiness of her own progeny. In  a similar way, we see, in thorough detail, the complexities that make up  the two very different sets of relationships between the respective parents  and their children. Din and O'Donnell have, wisely, chosen to limit the  scope of their film by downplaying the broader theme of how a suspicious  and prejudiced society deals with so unconventional a marriage and family.  We see only bits and pieces of this in the form of bigoted comments uttered  by a disapproving neighbor and a mere mention of a political rally intended  to rouse the populace on the issue of `repatriation.' Instead, the authors  concentrate almost exclusively on the internecine struggles taking place  within this one family. This helps to keep the scale of the film  life-sized, thus enhancing our identification with the characters and their  universal parent/child conflicts. For, in a way, the Khan family is really  not undergoing any crisis not already familiar to countless families the  world over, as parents cope with children eager to cut the filial chords  and establish life on their own terms and as children, likewise, deal with  parents who want to determine the course those lives will take.

484993,A1YWR6ITOMKU91,6305958076,"S. L. O. Salonis ""Nymphadora Tonks""","[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that this film is terribly mislabeled as a comedy when it is, in fact, very much a drama. Yes, there are times when I laughed out loud but I chose this film because I was in the mood for a comedy. Had I been in the mood for a drama I am sure I would have scored the film much higher.""East is East"" is the story of a Pakistani father, George Khan, his Caucasian British wife, Ella, and their seven children. The acting is superb, the writing is excellent, and the soundtrack is wonderful. Having said all of that, I do have a few issues with the film. (SPOILER ALERT) First, the oldest son, Nazir, just kind of disappears for a while without any explanation. Did he run away? Did he kill himself? Where did he go? We find out about halfway through the film when his father pronounces that he is dead. This leaves the viewer wondering how one could have missed such an important event, but a few minutes later we realize that Nazir is only dead to him. In fact, we discover, albeit something I guessed in the first ten minutes of the film, that Nazir is gay. This is all the more reason for his Pakistani father to call him dead.My second issue with the film is that I really liked all of the characters, even the strict and traditional George. Ella is charming the way she can talk him down from almost any argument with typical British humor mixed with a few choice swear words. The kids adore their mother and, although they disagree with him, they love their father. This led me to believe that the film was going to be a ""Dad is a strict traditional man, kids and mom are not, so this is the story of how everyone changes Dad."" (SPOILER ALERT) Unfortunately, the story became, ""Dad is an abusive and closed-minded bastard and starts beating on anyone, including mom, who dares to defy him."" I just don't understand why the story had to change this way. I left the film wishing Ella would leave her bastard husband and raise her kids on her own. We went from the tenderness of how Ella would ask George if he would like some tea and he would reply, ""just half a cup"", to George calling her a ""bloody b****"" and giving her a black eye. Why? My final issue with the film is the ending. (SPOILER ALERT) We are left with nothing changed in the family other than the children discovering that their father isn't just strict, he is cruel. I just feel incomplete after watching ""East is East"". I get that the Pakistani culture is very different from British culture and that, particularly in the 1970's, the west was not very open to accepting this new group of immigrants. What else came of this story? I don't feel warm and fuzzy toward this culture if George is a shining of example of how the men truly behave. Why did he choose to marry outside of his own culture if he hates it so much? Why raise children with a mother who is not Muslim and not from Pakistan if you are just going to teach them that it is unacceptable to marry anyone who is not from Pakistan? I feel like I got a glimpse of a very dysfunctional family who will never see a happy ending and that is just not why I choose to watch films. I watch films to learn something new, or to laugh, to perhaps cry a little, but overall, I watch films to have a few hours of enjoyment. I watch films to forget my own problems for a while. After watching this, I just feel like I would have been better off calling my own family back home and hearing about their issues and problems.",3,A few laughs between the many bumps in this film...,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",2009,3462,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'film', 'terribly', 'mislabeled', 'comedy', 'when', 'fact', 'very', 'much', 'drama', 'Yes', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'chose', 'film', 'was', 'mood', 'comedy', 'Had', 'been', 'mood', 'drama', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'scored', 'film', 'much', 'higher', 'East', 'East', 'story', 'Pakistani', 'father', 'George', 'Khan', 'Caucasian', 'British', 'wife', 'Ella', 'seven', 'children', 'acting', 'superb', 'writing', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'wonderful', 'Having', 'said', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'issues', 'film', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'First', 'oldest', 'son', 'Nazir', 'just', 'kind', 'disappears', 'while', 'explanation', 'Did', 'run', 'away', 'Did', 'kill', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'find', 'out', 'halfway', 'film', 'when', 'father', 'pronounces', 'dead', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'how', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'important', 'event', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'realize', 'Nazir', 'only', 'dead', 'fact', 'discover', 'something', 'guessed', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'Nazir', 'gay', 'more', 'reason', 'Pakistani', 'father', 'call', 'dead.My', 'second', 'issue', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'characters', 'even', 'strict', 'traditional', 'George', 'Ella', 'charming', 'way', 'can', 'talk', 'down', 'almost', 'argument', 'typical', 'British', 'humor', 'mixed', 'few', 'choice', 'swear', 'words', 'kids', 'adore', 'mother', 'disagree', 'love', 'father', 'led', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Dad', 'strict', 'traditional', 'man', 'kids', 'mom', 'are', 'not', 'story', 'how', 'everyone', 'Dad', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Unfortunately', 'story', 'became', 'Dad', 'abusive', 'closed-minded', 'bastard', 'beating', 'anyone', 'including', 'mom', 'who', 'defy', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'story', 'had', 'change', 'way', 'left', 'film', 'wishing', 'Ella', 'would', 'leave', 'bastard', 'husband', 'raise', 'kids', 'own', 'went', 'tenderness', 'how', 'Ella', 'would', 'ask', 'George', 'would', 'like', 'tea', 'would', 'reply', 'just', 'cup', 'George', 'calling', 'bloody', 'b****', 'giving', 'black', 'eye', 'Why', 'final', 'issue', 'film', 'ending', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'are', 'left', 'nothing', 'changed', 'family', 'other', 'children', 'discovering', 'father', ""n't"", 'just', 'strict', 'cruel', 'just', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'watching', 'East', 'East', 'get', 'Pakistani', 'culture', 'very', 'different', 'British', 'culture', 'particularly', '1970', 'west', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'open', 'accepting', 'new', 'group', 'immigrants', 'What', 'else', 'came', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'culture', 'George', 'shining', 'example', 'how', 'men', 'truly', 'behave', 'Why', 'did', 'choose', 'marry', 'own', 'culture', 'so', 'much', 'Why', 'raise', 'children', 'mother', 'who', 'not', 'Muslim', 'not', 'Pakistan', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'teach', 'unacceptable', 'marry', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'Pakistan', 'feel', 'got', 'glimpse', 'very', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'happy', 'ending', 'just', 'not', 'why', 'choose', 'watch', 'films', 'watch', 'films', 'learn', 'something', 'new', 'laugh', 'perhaps', 'cry', 'little', 'overall', 'watch', 'films', 'have', 'few', 'hours', 'enjoyment', 'watch', 'films', 'forget', 'own', 'problems', 'while', 'watching', 'just', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'calling', 'own', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'hearing', 'issues', 'problems']",East Is East VHS

That being said, this movie made absolutely no attempt to capture the real clash of culture and tradition that takes place when people from the 'East' migrate to the 'West'. Just to give some background, the story is about a family consisting of a 1st generation immigrant Pakistani father, his English wife, and their children, and the clash which takes place between the traditional father and the 'modern' children. The father is such a one-dimensional charachter. We know nothing about him: 1) What was his life like in Pakistan 2)Being as conservative as he is, what made him to marry an English woman? 3) Why do these two stay together, considering the horrible amount of abuse the father dishes out? We never see his point of view, except for one line in which he tries to explain to one of his sons why he is so harsh on them. That was it. The rest of the whole movie portrays him as uncouth, abusive and ignorant and nowhere does the movie attempt to show that any other form of South Asian man exists, i.e. that all people from the 'East' are like the father. Being South Asian, I take offense at this portrayal, as all it helps is to propagate stereotypes and racism against Pakistanis and other South Asians, which I don't think was necessary in this day and age. The movie makes a poor attempt capture the melancholy and struggle that immigrants go through in their new home. Watch it for laughs, but please, don't take this movie as representative of the South Asian diaspora in England/America, as you'll be doing all of them a dishonour.

Despite marrying a local, George Khan [Om Puri] is adamant that his children follow the old ways and the traditions of his culture, such as circumcision for his sons, and also arranged marriages. Though the movie adopts a light-hearted look at the clash between East and West, it also has an underlying seriousness to it. Khan's grown children [except for the youngest son who is under 12] chafe at the strictures imposed upon their freedom, preferring to embrace their mother's Western ideals rather than the tradition-bound strictures of their father's culture. Only one son embraces the strict, religious lifestyle of the father.""East is East"" has amazing scenes scattered throughout the movie - little gems that will have one laughing out loud or cringing in disgust. One particular highlight is the one where Khan's only daughter sings and dances, with a broom, to the tune of an old Hindi song as she scrubs and cleans!
