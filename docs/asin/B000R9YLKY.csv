1080865,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000R9YLKY,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","House Season Three, 2006-07These stories are set in the ""Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital"" in New Jersey. ""Gregory House MD"" is modeled after ""Sherlock Holmes"", a character who is more observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera records events like ""Dr. Watson"". ""Everybody lies"" is House's slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned this business). Would his temper tantrums work in the real world? Would his pill popping be overlooked? [Does this seem more like Show Business than medicine?] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflict as well as some comedy. Is that its attraction? After a patient arrives there are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem so it can be cured. [This recurring plot is as regular as the old ""Perry Mason"" show.]This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses. This show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda for which they are being paid? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctor's mistake?

House does misuse his cane, takes pain pills like penny candy and is an anti Doctor's  doctor. However the show gets better and better , season after seasonSome critics of this season of House which had been shot and recovers in the first episode and then David Morse (St Elsewhere) played  a revengeful  cop House disrespected in his clinic visit as a JUMP THE SHARK (a term when a show needs a gimmick in a story arc) season. I do not think so. The story arc added to the drama. Now we know House wont lose his license or go to jail, unless they canceled the show and FOX wants this hit for 2 more seasons...so we know the interplay between characters works so well asnd delivers well during this personal crisis story line.After the COP arc, the show was back to business as usually, until the second story arc, where Foreman (Omar Epps) wishes to leave House's team and the hospital. Here is acting at its best this season. Epps and Lurie play the power struggle with a Liar's poker style. There is a climax which is at the end of the season which will throw everyone for a loop. Emmy voters there is still time, Lurie and Epps for Best actor and best supporting actor in a drama, OKAY?Some will ask why only 4 stars..well there were so much of the Cop and Foreman arc, that there were not many of those single Episodes where House and his team acted like miracle workers.

1080871,A2IGYM7K8MFJRC,B000R9YLKY,Bo stergaard Jepsen,"[0, 0]","""House, M.D."" series 1 and 2 were possibly the best thing to happen to television drama in ten or so years with it's well defined and well played characters, funny yet serious dialogue, and well written stories, and series 3 is not far behind. But it is behind.Although the main plot of each episode still is an unsolvable medical case and House still is a jolly, painridden misanthropist, the sub plots plays a larger role in series 3. House is about to land in prison and lose his medical license when he insults a policeman (played excellently by David Morse) who in turn goes out of his way to nail House. The drama and tension between House's underlings also raises to new levels ending the series in a true cliffhanger.This is all very nice, but I think the sub plots get a little too much attention in series 3 and the drama gets a bit too dramatic. I think they painted themselves in a corner with the ending of series 3, which will be very hard to get out of in a plausible way for series 4.Series 3 is, however, still seriously good entertainment. Hugh Laurie makes sure of that on his own. It is just not entirely as good as series 1 and 2, is all. But the difference is more akin to an Aston Martin being a better car than a Jaguar.

If someone told me this show couldn't get better, I would be inclined to agree. At the end of Season 2, House was shot and he asked to be given Ketamine which would help fix his leg. Season 3 starts off with, what seems to be a completely new House, he's happy and he's walking without an aid and doing his job without Vicodin. This is cool, it shows us just how much the leg problems have affected House and his personality. It doesn't last, as within a few episodes he's back to using the Cane and popping pills every hour.During mid season House also gains himself a Vogler-esque type enemy, only this time it's a cop, and it lands House in some serious trouble. He's constantly haunted by this cop who insists on making House's life a misery until he's behind bars. House just carries on as usual, so the cop known as Tritter starts on his friends, first off is Wilson. This is a big test for their friendship as Wilson's life is almost destroyed by Tritter, but he refuses to give him up. Can we say the same for the team? Even Chase? Watch it and find out, you wont be disappointed.Naturally Season 3 is bound to have the classic lines. Below are some of my favourites.From Episode 1: The MeaningCameron: ""You're lucky he didn't die.""House: ""I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.""From Episode 8: Whac-A-MoleHouse: ""Okay, fine. I'll father your child. But first you gotta write me a Vicodin prescription. Just so I can get through the foreplay.""From Episode 14: InsensitiveHouse: ""I was curious.

""House"" delivered once again on its initial promise of a hard-hitting smart combination of dramatic medical stories, laugh-out-loud comedic interludes, and compelling character-driven arcs.  Hugh Laurie continues to amaze as the soulfully tortured genius whose heart we are ever so slowly unpeeling.  Not one minute during which Laurie was on screen was wasted, boring, or conventional -- an astounding achievement in the third year of a network show. [Emmy voters mysteriously mesmerized by other, lesser actors need to wake up now before its too late!]  Favorite episodes include the riveting conclusion to the bad cop arc ""Merry Little Christmas"" in which we watch horrified as House descends to the grimmest depths imaginable.

The extraordinary and sexy chemistry generated between Hugh Laurie and the intelligent and striking Lisa Edelstein was the overarching highlight of season three for me.  I also greatly enjoyed the twisted deepening of the characters of Wilson and Foreman, played expertly by Robert Sean Leonard and Omar Epps.  The skillful support Laurie enjoyed from Edelstein, Leonard, and Epps significantly strengthened this excellent season's drama.  Among many superior episodes, these stand out: ""Lines in the Sand,"" ""Son of a Coma Guy,"" ""Words and Deeds,"" ""Half-Wit,"" ""Top Secret,"" ""The Jerk,"" and ""Housetraining.""  Each of these episodes significantly advanced our knowledge of House's lonely inner journey, his desperate search for normality in the face of crushing pain, and his quest for meaning in a shattered life.  Guest actors John Laroquette, David Morse, Dave Matthews, Joel Grey and others all turned  in outstanding performances.

Hugh Laurie does an excellent job portraying a cynical doctor. However, season three betrays the writers resting upon their laurels. No changes happen in the show. No new characters are introduced besides a temporary villain in the form of a police officer. All of the other characters remain subservient to, and bullied by, Dr. House.The writers have notched the tension up to the screaming point, which they probably think is a good thing. There's a mantra among writers these days that Conflict is Everything. No conflict, no story. Oh yeah? There are such things as comedy, love, friendship and affection, but you won't find any of those elements ever portrayed in this season of House. Instead what you will find is hostility, hatred masquerading as wit, shouting, screaming, insults. The writers have run out of ideas. They don't know what to do with their characters.House cannot love anybody and cannot grow. There's no love interest. House remains a narrow, caustic nerd unable to show any affection for anyone. I find him to be a pathetic waste of space. Therefore, in their creative desperation, the writers choose to bring in sideshows. You have freaks brought in to be cured by the misanthropic genius. First the dwarf... then the Gypsy... and then I picked the DVDs up and threw them all in the garbage can.I did not enjoy this portrayal of sado-masochistic relationships, and in my judgment, not many other people will, either. This show is doomed, and I doubt there will be many more seasons. The writers have run out of gas. This happened with ""Six Feet Under"" after season two as well.

1080890,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000R9YLKY,General Zombie,"[2, 2]","I was late in coming to ""House"", as I'm not much of a fan of medical shows or contemporary procedurals, and these were the angles most emphasized by the early ads. Still, some family members were big into the show for years, and they finally wore me down this past summer. Now that I've watched every episode at least once . . . well, I'm still not much of a fan of medical shows, but it turns out that the medical mysteries are only a small part of the appeal, and work mainly to give a focus for the character- and humor-driven material. Yes, ""House"" is a medical drama, and it's every bit as formulaic as it appeared. Still, this is one of the most intelligently written, not to mention funniest, shows on TV, and they inevitably find ways to color this template in surprising and even moving ways.Though the first three seasons of House are very similar, Season 3 is probably the strongest of them, now that the characters are fully developed and the individual performances finely honed. At the heart of the show is Hugh Laurie's House, and so much has been written in praise of him that it's hard to add anything else without delving into clich&eacute;. Simply put, he's one of the most entertaining, fascinating figures you'll find in a TV show. I view him as something of a nerd icon: though we nerds are generally not geniuses nor are we necessarily interested in medicine, House provides an extreme version of the nerd personality: someone who is more interested in things and abstract ideas than in the people surrounding him, and who doesn't have patience for superficial social graces. Even better, House is, indeed, a genius and possesses an incredibly caustic wit, two other traits any self-respecting nerd must long for. (He also finds hot women inexplicably drawn to him from time to time, which, while not terribly plausible, also fulfills obvious nerd wish fulfillment.)House is no mere one man show, however. The far more human and empathetic oncologist Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is House's best friend and foil, and it's to the show's credit that he proves as intriguing as House, despite displaying a radically different personality. Beyond them we have Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), the dean of medicine and House's nemesis/secret love interest, and House's three younger fellows, Foreman (Omar Epps), Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) and Chase (Jesse Spencer). Cuddy initially functions primarily as a sparring partner for House, but here she's given greater depth, particularly in her attempts to become a mother. One relative weakness of the show is the slight thinness of House's fellows (a fact well-illustrated in Airborne: ""You disagree with everything I say, you agree with everything I say, you be morally outraged by everything I do."") Still, Epps, Morrison and Spencer give considered and nuanced performances that bring the sometimes underwritten figures to life. Chase is probably the most conventionally likable of them, and serves as a much more handsome stand-in for the nerd audience i.e. he admires House and wants to be like him/impress him. (Also, Chase's fabulous hair and powerful jaw has been known to give even the most staunchly heterosexual of male viewers a slight case of the vapours. I can only imagine what he does to women. . .) Foreman is harder to like, though he's probably the most complicated of the fellows; he's a former delinquent kid from the street who is endlessly determined to be the best, but fears the moral compromises and inhumanity sometimes necessary to get the job done. Finally we have the controversial Cameron, the quintessentially caring and emotional (not to mention gorgeous) female doctor who becomes to personally involved all too often. Lots of people (women) dislike her (bitter old hags, no doubt), but she's ultimately a necessary figure, since she provides the polar opposite of House, even more so than Wilson does. (This matters cause it's quite a philosophical show, and must represent a wide cross-section of viewpoints.) Anyway, regardless of what others think _I_ like her. (In fact, I like her more than it is either rational or wise to like a fictional character. . .)Since the show is so driven by dialogue and character, the individual episodes don't necessarily stand out as much as they would in more plot-driven shows. Still, there are more than a few particularly noteworthy efforts. ""One Day, One Room"" is probably the best episode of the season, a non-formula one where House is coerced into counseling a rape victim. This is a particularly philosophical episode, which I always like, and I'm impressed by how, despite being a generally misanthropic show, ""House"" manages to give a fair hearing for less bleak worldviews. ""Insensitive"" is another strong one, largely due to the comic subplot where House repeatedly disrupts Cuddy's date. (Possibly House's best line ever: (to Cuddy's date) ""You must've meet online . . . that or else you have a friend who secretly hates you."") There's also ""Son of a Coma Guy,"" where House awakens a vegetative patient (brilliantly played by John Larroquette) to help cure his dying son. (At its best, House is a great mixture of humor and pathos, and few episodes do that better than ""Son of. . ."") On the downside, the season has a rather humdrum finale, particularly when compared to the conclusions. Still, this is partially redeemed by the excellent multi-episode plot arc where the vengeful Det. Tritter (David Morse) tries to bring House down on drug charges. Morse gives a great turn as Tritter, who proves ever bit as obsessive and driven as House, and the general events does much to strain House's other relations, which is, again, always the heart of the show.""House"" underwent a somewhat substantial revamping after this season and, as much as I enjoy Season 3, this probably isn't a bad thing. While the last season and a half haven't been quite as good as the strongest earlier material, they managed to preemptively stave off any staleness that would've emerged sooner or later. Whatever the case, the material we have is very good, and anyone who is interested in a funny, intelligent but surprisingly human show would be wise to check this out. (Though you should start at the beginning, of course.)",5,A first-rate comedic drama,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,6246,"['was', 'late', 'coming', 'House', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'fan', 'medical',

1080896,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,B000R9YLKY,Jason A. Miller,"[169, 179]","You have to give the ""House"" production team credit.  Your show has the ""American Idol"" lead-in and is often the highest-rated scripted drama on TV.  However, instead of playing it safe with disease-of-the week plots, ""House"" swung for the fences several times: putting its main character in jail and threatening him with prison; ramping up the conflicts between all six of the main characters; and ending the year with a big cliffhanger that threatened to cut the main cast in half.  Even when a given episode wasn't advancing the progressive storyline, the writers attempted to push the envelope with several politically themed episodes.Early in Season 3, the big storyline revolved around recurring guest star David Morse, a detective out to get House and his questionable supply of Vicodin.  In previous years, lengthy story arcs were given to Chi McBride and Sela Ward: would House lose his job?  would House get married?  This year, the theme was: would House go to prison?  Morse dominated his episodes by playing the rare character that wouldn't back down to House.  Although some media critics grew tired of the plot, which perhaps went on 2-3 episodes too long, the resolution was clever and allowed House to keep his dignity (and his job) without having to sacrifice... anything.Several subplots emerged throughout the season, such as the romance between Drs. Chase and Cameron (first shown in season 2), and Dr. Foreman's growing dissatisfaction with having House as his mentor.  House's fascination (or, some might say, obsession) with his boss, Dr. Cuddy, reached new levels.  By the end of the season, House faced near mutiny from his underlings... and still didn't seem all that bothered.  Perhaps House was too busy counseling a patient to end his life, or faking cancer in order to get a supply of pain medications.  Perhaps he was dodging the romantic advances of a teenager, or trading in his case for a wheelchair in order to recover his handicapped parking spot.  The more outrageous the behavior, the better Hugh Laurie was in the role.  He even upgraded his cane to a model decorated with stars.Standout guest stars this season included John Larroquette as a man waking up from a decade-long coma, Joel Grey as an ailing doctor, Dave Matthews as a stunted piano prodigy, and the return of Charles S. Dutton as Foreman's dad.While the ""House"" season DVDs are never what you'd call packed with extras, the tightly knotted plots and the rapid-fire dialogue makes this a great show to watch more than once.  Also try and track down plot-lines that never quite went anywhere, like Cuddy's rumored pregnancy or her not-quite romance with Wilson.""House"" season 3 drew top ratings while continuing with the show's unflinching dialogue and medical situations.  This may not have been a great year for ""Grey's Anatomy"" or ""E.R."", so cruise on over to Princeton Plainsborough for a few hours of intense hospital drama.",4,Big ambitions in the House,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,2931,"['have', 'give', 'House', 'production', 'team', 'credit', 'show', 'American', 'Idol', 'lead-in', 'often', 'highest-rated', 'scripted', 'drama', 'TV', 'However', 'instead', 'playing', 'safe', 'disease-of-the', 'week', 'plots', 'House', 'swung', 'fences', 'several', 'times', 'putting', 'main', 'character', 'jail', 'threatening', 'prison', 'ramping', 'up', 'conflicts', 'six', 'main', 'characters', 'ending', 'year', 'big', 'cliffhanger', 'threatened', 'cut', 'main', 'cast', 'half', 'Even', 'when', 'given', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'advancing', 'progressive', 'storyline', 'writers', 'attempted', 'push', 'envelope', 'several', 'politically', 'themed', 'episodes.Early', 'Season', '3', 'big', 'storyline', 'revolved', 'recurring', 'guest', 'star', 'David', 'Morse', 'detective', 'out', 'get', 'House', 'questionable', 'supply', 'Vicodin', 'previous', 'years', 'lengthy', 'story', 'arcs', 'were', 'given', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'Sela', 'Ward', 'would', 'House', 'lose', 'job', 'would', 'House', 'get', 'married', 'year', 'theme', 'was', 'would', 'House', 'go', 'prison', 'Morse', 'dominated', 'episodes', 'playing', 'rare', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'back', 'down', 'House', 'media', 'critics', 'grew', 'tired', 'plot', 'perhaps', 'went', '2-3', 'episodes', 'too', 'long', 'resolution', 'was', 'clever', 'allowed', 'House', 'keep', 'dignity', 'job', 'having', 'sacrifice', 'anything.Several', 'subplots', 'emerged', 'season', 'such', 'romance', 'Drs', 'Chase', 'Cameron', 'first', 'shown', 'season', '2', 'Dr.', 'Foreman', 'growing', 'dissatisfaction', 'having', 'House', 'mentor', 'House', 'fascination', 'might', 'say', 'obsession', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Cuddy', 'reached', 'new', 'levels', 'end', 'season', 'House', 'faced', 'mutiny', 'underlings', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bothered', 'Perhaps', 'House', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'counseling', 'patient', 'end', 'life', 'faking', 'cancer', 'order', 'get', 'supply', 'pain', 'medications', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'dodging', 'romantic', 'advances', 'teenager', 'trading', 'case', 'wheelchair', 'order', 'recover', 'handicapped', 'parking', 'spot', 'more', 'outrageous', 'behavior', 'better', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'was', 'role', 'even', 'upgraded', 'cane', 'model', 'decorated', 'stars.Standout', 'guest', 'season', 'included', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'man', 'waking', 'up', 'decade-long', 'coma', 'Joel', 'Grey', 'ailing', 'doctor', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'stunted', 'piano', 'prodigy', 'return', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Foreman', 'dad.While', 'House', 'season', 'DVDs', 'are', 'never', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'packed', 'extras', 'tightly', 'knotted', 'plots', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'Also', 'try', 'track', 'down', 'plot-lines', 'never', 'quite', 'went', 'anywhere', 'Cuddy', 'rumored', 'pregnancy', 'not-quite', 'romance', 'Wilson', 'House', 'season', '3', 'drew', 'top', 'ratings', 'continuing', 'show', 'unflinching', 'dialogue', 'medical', 'situations', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'year', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'E.R', 'so', 'cruise', 'Princeton', 'Plainsborough', 'few', 'hours', 'intense', 'hospital', 'drama']",House: Season Three

1080899,A19XE6G6NDZFPS,B000R9YLKY,Joanna Mechlinski,"[1, 1]","Even if you've never seen a single episode of House, chances are you've heard about the cranky doctor that's made this show such a hit...Played by Hugh Laurie, Dr. Gregory House is a brilliant misanthrope who operates by no one's rules but his own. He's also in chronic pain, limping on a cane with flames painted along the side and popping huge numbers of Vicodin, even in front of patients. While he's pushed away most of humanity, he's fortune enough to have a best friend, the long-suffering Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) as well as the support of the hospital's Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Despite almost daily clashes with the two, House knows he can count on them to back him up when he needs it.House's team of fellows include Drs. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). Enduring regular emotional -- and sometimes physical -- abuse from their boss, the three will quickly say that they are only putting up with House in order to gain valuable experience to further their careers. But it's also apparent that after more than three years under his wing, each young doctor has grown to respect and care for House, who occasionally lets them see his damaged and human side.As Season 2 ended with House being shot by the crazed husband of a former patient, Season 3 begins with his returning to work, presumably after taking the summer off to recuperate. House -- and everyone who knows him -- is thrilled to see that the ketamine used to help him through surgery continues to help him walk well and without pain. But will it last?A plot arc involving Michael Tritter, a detective who swears to ruin House after the latter humiliates him in the hospital clinic, runs through several episodes. The detective's goal is to prove House is dangerous to patients because of his Vicodin addiction, and thus needs to have his license taken away. Many fans -- including myself -- felt this arc was poorly done, and did not contribute to the season's overall story growth.Other memorable episodes include ""One Day, One Room,"" where a rape victim inexplicably latches onto House, causing him to reveal some troubling details about his own past; ""Half Wit,"" where House claims to have brain cancer while he and team treat a damaged musical prodigy played by Dave Matthews; and ""Top Secret,"" where Chase and Cameron embark upon a complicated new relationship.Overall, the format of this show may seem too set or predictable; each episode, the team treats an unusual Patient of the Week, while dealing with side issues involving their own lives. Yet with the show's fantastic writing, this never happens. Rarely is anything predictable -- and as Dr. House is fond of saying, ""Everybody lies,"" so you can never tell what someone may be hiding until the very last minute. Each episode is enjoyable in its own way.As for this box set, it's handsomely packaged. It includes a few extras, like behind-the-scenes with the medical props people and some bloopers (which are mostly just instances where the actors started to say their lines and burst out laughing, nothing truly ""blooper-worthy,"" in my opinion). If you look forward to the extras on DVD sets, this probably won't be your favorite.",5,One of the best shows around!,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,3266,"['Even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'House', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'cranky', 'doctor', 'made', 'show', 'hit', 'Played', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Dr.', 'Gregory', 'House', 'brilliant', 'misanthrope', 'who', 'one', 'rules', 'own', 'also', 'chronic', 'pain', 'limping', 'cane', 'flames', 'painted', 'side', 'popping', 'huge', 'numbers', 'Vicodin', 'even', 'front', 'patients', 'pushed', 'away', 'most', 'humanity', 'fortune', 'enough', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'long-suffering', 'Dr.', 'James', 'Wilson', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'as', 'well', 'support', 'hospital', 'Dean', 'Medicine', 'Dr.', 'Lisa', 'Cuddy', 'Lisa', 'Edelstein', 'almost', 'daily', 'clashes', 'two', 'House', 'can', 'count', 'back', 'up', 'when', 'it.House', 'team', 'fellows', 'include', 'Drs', 'Allison', 'Cameron', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'Robert', 'Chase', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'Eric', 'Foreman', 'Omar', 'Epps', 'Enduring', 'regular', 'emotional', 'sometimes', 'physical', 'boss', 'three', 'will', 'quickly', 'say', 'are', 'only', 'putting', 'up', 'House', 'order', 'gain', 'valuable', 'experience', 'further', 'careers', 'also', 'apparent', 'more', 'three', 'years', 'wing', 'young', 'doctor', 'grown', 'respect', 'care', 'House', 'who', 'occasionally', 'see', 'damaged', 'human', 'side.As', 'Season', '2', 'ended', 'House', 'being', 'shot', 'crazed', 'husband', 'former', 'patient', 'Season', '3', 'begins', 'returning', 'work', 'presumably', 'taking', 'summer', 'recuperate', 'House', 'everyone', 'who', 'thrilled', 'see', 'ketamine', 'used', 'help', 'surgery', 'help', 'walk', 'well', 'pain', 'will', 'last', 'plot', 'arc', 'involving', 'Michael', 'Tritter', 'detective', 'who', 'ruin', 'House', 'latter', 'hospital', 'clinic', 'several', 'episodes', 'detective', 'goal', 'prove', 'House', 'dangerous', 'patients', 'Vicodin', 'addiction', 'thus', 'needs', 'have', 'license', 'taken', 'away', 'Many', 'fans', 'including', 'felt', 'arc', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'did', 'not', 'contribute', 'season', 'overall', 'story', 'growth.Other', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'include', 'One', 'Day', 'One', 'Room', 'where', 'rape', 'victim', 'inexplicably', 'House', 'causing', 'reveal', 'troubling', 'details', 'own', 'past', 'Half', 'Wit', 'where', 'House', 'have', 'brain', 'cancer', 'team', 'treat', 'damaged', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'played', 'Dave', 'Matthews', 'Top', 'Secret', 'where', 'Chase', 'Cameron', 'embark', 'complicated', 'new', 'relationship.Overall', 'format', 'show', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'set', 'predictable', 'episode', 'team', 'unusual', 'Patient', 'Week', 'dealing', 'side', 'issues', 'involving', 'own', 'lives', 'show', 'fantastic', 'writing', 'never', 'Rarely', 'anything', 'predictable', 'Dr.', 'House', 'fond', 'saying', 'Everybody', 'can', 'never', 'tell', 'what', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'hiding', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'episode', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'way.As', 'box', 'set', 'handsomely', 'packaged', 'few', 'extras', 'behind-the-scenes', 'medical', 'props', 'people', 'bloopers', 'are', 'mostly', 'just', 'instances', 'where', 'actors', 'started', 'say', 'lines', 'burst', 'out', 'laughing', 'nothing', 'truly', 'blooper-worthy', 'opinion', 'look', 'forward', 'extras', 'DVD', 'sets', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'favorite']",House: Season Three

1080902,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,B000R9YLKY,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[71, 79]","That incredibly crabby doctor with the serious leg pain is back for the third season of the acclaimed medical series ""House, M.D."" And once again Hugh Laurie and company came up with another winner of a season, although in my opinion it was just a tad notch below the first two seasons. Still, ""House"" season three is still very much worth watching.Laurie once again dominates season three as he did with seasons one and two, and come Emmy time he better be rewarded! (He's already won two Golden Globes and one Screen Actors Guild award for his portrayal of Dr. House.) Being snubbed for a nomination for season two was a crime! His performances throughout season three was probably some of the best acting that Laurie has done on the show so far, thanks in part to one major storyline early in the season. David Morse was introduced in the fifth episode as Detective Tritter, a cop who comes to the hospital as a patient. Guess which doctor he ends up getting? Before you know it, Dr. House starts off by treating him rude, and if that's not bad enough, pops Vicodin right in front of him. Later on, he arrests Dr. House for possession of drugs, and thereafter tries in every way to make the cranky doc's life miserable (such as when Dr. House has to go for days without Vicodin and ends up in rehab). In addition, these turn of events also put a disturbing effect on his team, as the cop pressures each team member to give him some answers about their boss. This was a very strong storyline, and Morse was excellent in the role of the ticked off cop.Sure ""House"" is the Hugh Laurie show, but lets not forget about the superb supporting cast: Lisa Edelstein as hospital administrator Lisa Cuddy; Omar Epps as neurologist Eric Foreman; Robert Sean Leonard as oncology specialist James Wilson; Jennifer Morrison as immunologist Allison Cameron; and Jesse Spencer as intensive-care specialist Robert Chase are all back for season three, and they're better than ever. For all three seasons these actors are given plenty to do in support of Laurie, and each of them does a great job playing off not only Laurie but each other. This is thanks to some terrific writing by creator David Shore and his writing team. They not only make this show compelling but smart as well. My favorite episode from season three is the one titled ""Airborne"", where House and Cuddy board a plane departing Malaysia that soon becomes a hospital ward when several passengers become seriously ill (including Cuddy); while back at Princeton-Plainsboro Wilson, Chase, Cameron, and Foreman try to solve a medical mystery on their own. This is a great episode, maybe the best overall episode of the show so far. It's not only thrilling and dramatic, but funny and shocking as well. Other great episodes include the second episode ""Cane and Able"", in which House and his team try to figure out why a 7 year old boy thinks he's being tortured by aliens, and the next-to-last episode ""The Jerk"", in which Dr. House meets his match with his latest patient: a teenage chess player with an arrogant attitude that's even worse than House's.Despite this show's greatness, I had a few quibbles on the third season of ""House"". One season three episode didn't work for me (episode #12 - ""One Day, One Room""). I found this episode kind of dull and not all that interesting. It's not real bad, but I just didn't seem to care about it all that much, which makes it the weakest episode of ""House"" so far. One minor storyline that was also kind of silly was the sexual hook-ups between Chase and Cameron, which featured them getting down and dirty in the hospital, in a patient's house, etc. And it was only for fun. Chase wants a relationship, but Cameron doesn't. This really isn't smart writing on the part of the writing team on ""House"". I think it was only thrown in their due to the real-life engagement of the actors who play Chase and Cameron (Jesse Spencer and Jennifer Morrison got engaged midway through season three). But in all fairness, I think this storyline would have worked better if the writers had done exactly what Chase wanted: let them have a relationship. These actors do look great together. I think a serious relationship storyline between Chase and Cameron would be awesome. Perhaps that might come later.Familiar faces who show up for guest appearances during season three include: John Larroquette (""Night Court""), Kathleen Quinlan (""Apollo 13""), Joel Grey (""Cabaret""), Charles S. Dutton (""The Piano Lesson""), Piper Perabo (""Coyote Ugly""), Kurtwood Smith (""That `70s Show""), and pop star Dave Matthews.The final episode of season three apparently will be opening the door for changes when season four debuts in the fall, as House lost his entire team (Foreman and Cameron resigned; Chase fired). I'm hoping that this will not be the end for some members of this great ensemble cast. I love this cast on ""House"", and if any one of these cast members leave the show or end up being let go, I will be very saddened by it. But this is the show's big cliffhanger for the summer. We'll eventually find out what will happen when season four returns this fall. And my fingers are crossed that all these cast members return.",5,"House, M.D. - Season Three",1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,5197,"['incredibly', 'doctor', 'serious', 'leg', 'pain', 'back', 'third',

1080906,AIBZIUB6WIVP,B000R9YLKY,"Kos ""Kos""","[0, 0]","I see some problems in continuity, one being in ""Birthmarks"" we learn House and Wilson meet soon after Wilson graduates med school, making him an intern. In an earlier episode, ""Knight Fall,"" when Wilson is talking to the first former Mrs Wilson, Sam, he mentions them being together while he was in his residency. However, at the conference he meets House at, Wilson's carrying a package containing his divorce papers. Also, in the most excellent episodes ""House's Head"" and ""Wilson's Heart"" (Season four enders), House states he sees some dangerous symptoms prior to the bus crash. Actually, all he sees is Amber taking flu medication. Her kidneys weren't messed up until after the crash, but House insists he saw something prior. OK, those two obvious things bothering me, IMO ""House, MD"" never ever jumped the shark. Sure, some episodes are better than others but none has that wretched, turning the corner to bad ""moment."" As for the medical issues, here is my big, major gripe about the show: there are so many HIPAA violations it's not even funny, unless we can assume medical releases were signed by just about anyone involved. One glaring example is Edward Vogler (hisssssss)coming in and picking up a patient's chart, like he has any business doing so. Not even another doctor can do that unless that doctor has some role in the patient's care. One good example of observing HIPAA, however, is when Cuddy goes to look at a person's chart and House moves the screen away from her because it's none of her business. Google HIPAA to learn more. The government takes this law very seriously. I work for a medical health system and we take it seriously too.One more great comment: Robert Sean Leonard. He was very young, early 20s, when he played a major role in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado about Nothing,"" and some time between that movie and ""House, MD"" his acting greatly improved. I've read reviews that he should've won an Emmy for the House's Head/Wilson's Heart episodes. He does an amazing job.As for getting these eps via Amazon Instant Video, I mostly don't have a problem, except in the connection.

Designed as a show with a mystery disease in every episode, the disease must last and not be resolved unit the end of the episode, and there must always be a crisis at some point midway through the episode.  Character development is designed as a distraction from the main disease, mystery storyline.  It inches slowly through the season like a slug.  This season the fellows are supposed to leave because they leave in real life after 2 years, but instead of ending their learning and moving on, one must be fired and the other two quit.  And the sexual innuendo focuses on Cuddy this year.  While I felt it didn't matter in the first two seasons, the format was getting old for me in this season.  The answer for me wasn't ditching 3 cast members but making it a more character driven show.  To me, it seems that network television has feared character driven shows and gone for something that doesn't matter how closely they are viewed and aimed toward shallow stories that don't matter from one episode to the next.  House is much better than most network shows but suffers from the same format.  While I still have affection for it, the format isn't something that really keeps it in my mind.

(He was willing to have his only friends in the world lose their licenses rather than apologize to the cop?) This was the worst, but by far not the only negative development.  House became nasty not-funny instead of nasty-funny.  Almost nothing was funny all season. The entire story arc with the cop was annoyingly dumb as well - you don't have to be a lawyer to know that one lone cop cannot have the prescription privileges of several doctors suspended without at least lengthy administrative proceedings (wherein, or course, he could not have prevailed, since he had no evidence against them).

That being said one should not put to much faith in realism being displayed.  Most of the episodes of this series have become rather predictable i.e. patient is admitted, patient has convulsions.  Patient gets Cat Scan or MRI. Patient nearly dies from various treatments.  Patient finally recovers when correct procedures are found.  The vast majority of the episodes follow this form. In addition one is left to wonder how the hospital could afford the lawsuits that would arise from House's caustic personality as he insults patients,guardians and co-workers with his verbal abuse not to mention questionable medical procedures.  Finally for that added touch the spouse or guardian of the patient always seems to be present when the patient begins to have problems to add to the tension.  The items that hook you on this program is not areas I have previously outlined, but rather the fun of watching a really cranky somewhat mentally unbalanced genius doctor go about his work.  What will he say this week to abuse someone or everyone what rare disease will come to light to explain the patients problems.  The backgrounds of the principal supporting characters  are becoming more filled in and with this seasons certain tensions explode. As stated at the begining this is a fun show to watch it pulls you back in every week however, a growing soap opera feel now is starting to become more notable.

1080924,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B000R9YLKY,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that House, M.D. has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, House, M.D. is probably a good show."" But in fact, House, M.D. is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.But before I say any more about House, MD., let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. House, M.D. is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)House, M.D., if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series  often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs  ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for The Rockford Files, a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first Rockford Files DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, The Dick Van Dyke Show, had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. The Rockford Files and The Dick Van Dyke Show reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.House, M.D. is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",5,Is There a Doctor in the House?
