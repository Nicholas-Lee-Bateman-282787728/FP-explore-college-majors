Definitely not the best song for him.  The surprise of the evening was Faith Hill singing &#34;Send in the Clowns&#34;.  What a knockout performance.  Barbra's two songs were excellent, as always.  But if she won an award, or if there was an award, why wasn't she presented with it....or introduced before she sang....or SOMETHING???  She just ended up being just another singer instead of taking a bow for her achievement in receiving the tribute.

Each year, MusiCares presents a Person of the Year Tribute Concert to honor those who have generously given to support their cause.  The 2011 honoree was the legendary Barbra Streisand, and the evening was recorded and is being made available for purchase, with all the proceeds going to MusiCares.""A MusiCares Tribute to Barbra Streisand"" presents many of today's most notable performers interpreting some of Streisand's classic hits. Highlights from the concert include songstress Leona Lewis' straight ahead interpretation of Streisand's 1984 recording of ""Somewhere"" from the musical ""West Side Story;"" an appropriately titled version of the standard, ""Smile,"" performed by the always happy Tony Bennett; a wailing arrangement of ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" featuring the eclectic trio of LeAnn Rimes, gospel mainstay BeBe Winans, and guitar legend Jeff Beck; and a rousing version of ""People,"" the Bob Merrill and Jule Styne classic made famous by Barbra in the 1964 Broadway production of ""Funny Girl,"" with Stevie Wonder getting the audience on their feet while exchanging riffs with trumpeter Arturo Sandaval.Not all of the performances are rousing: Barry Manilow's attempt to be youthful doesn't quite hit the mark during his rendition of the Andrew Lloyd Webber anthem, ""Memory;"" Faith Hill, though always well-coiffed, appeared out-of-place attempting the Stephen Sondheim penned, ""Send in the Clowns;"" and Streisand's ""mini-me,"" Lea Michele, tries to milk every note she can out of ""My Man,"" written exclusively for the ""Funny Girl"" film. Fortunately, the concert ends with the madam herself performing an outstanding version of ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" written by her frequent beneficiaries Marilyn and Alan Bergman, and ""The Promise (I'll Never Say Goodbye).""  The recording is worth the investment: the money goes to a good cause and you get two performances by Streisand herself.",3,Needed more Barbra...,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2028,"['MusiCares', 'established', '1989', 'Recording', 'Academy', 'was', 'created', 'provide', 'essential', 'services', 'music', 'people', 'times', 'need', 'year', 'MusiCares', 'Person', 'Year', 'Tribute', 'Concert', 'honor', 'who', 'have', 'generously', 'given', 'support', 'cause', '2011', 'honoree', 'was', 'legendary', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'evening', 'was', 'recorded', 'being', 'made', 'available', 'purchase', 'proceeds', 'going', 'MusiCares', 'MusiCares', 'Tribute', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'many', 'today', 'most', 'notable', 'performers', 'interpreting', 'Streisand', 'classic', 'hits', 'Highlights', 'concert', 'include', 'songstress', 'Leona', 'Lewis', 'straight', 'ahead', 'interpretation', 'Streisand', '1984', 'recording', 'Somewhere', 'musical', 'West', 'Side', 'Story', 'appropriately', 'titled', 'version', 'standard', 'Smile', 'performed', 'always', 'happy', 'Tony', 'Bennett', 'wailing', 'arrangement', 'Come', 'Rain', 'Come', 'Shine', 'featuring', 'eclectic', 'trio', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'gospel', 'mainstay', 'BeBe', 'Winans', 'guitar', 'legend', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'rousing', 'version', 'People', 'Bob', 'Merrill', 'Jule', 'Styne', 'classic', 'made', 'famous', 'Barbra', '1964', 'Broadway', 'production', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'getting', 'audience', 'feet', 'exchanging', 'riffs', 'trumpeter', 'Arturo', 'Sandaval.Not', 'performances', 'are', 'rousing', 'Barry', 'Manilow', 'attempt', 'be', 'youthful', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'rendition', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'anthem', 'Memory', 'Faith', 'Hill', 'always', 'well-coiffed', 'appeared', 'out-of-place', 'attempting', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'penned', 'Send', 'Clowns', 'Streisand', 'mini-me', 'Lea', 'Michele', 'milk', 'note', 'can', 'My', 'Man', 'written', 'exclusively', 'Funny', 'Girl', 'film', 'Fortunately', 'concert', 'madam', 'performing', 'outstanding', 'version', 'Windmills', 'Your', 'Mind', 'written', 'frequent', 'beneficiaries', 'Marilyn', 'Alan', 'Bergman', 'Promise', ""'ll"", 'Never', 'Say', 'Goodbye', 'recording', 'investment', 'money', 'good', 'cause', 'get', 'two', 'performances', 'Streisand']",N/A

The show is heavily edited and only shows Barbra Streisand Performing two songs. The DVD is only approx one hour and the entire show has such a hurried pace to it showing one performer after another singing one of Barbara's songs! It would have been nice if the producer of this DVD could have featured the entire show because I know that Barbra sang more than 2 songs! For the true Barbra Fan who needs to be a completist and own everything that she comes out with, I would still buy it but be warned there isnt much of Barbra on the DVD!",3,DVD Contains Half The Show!
