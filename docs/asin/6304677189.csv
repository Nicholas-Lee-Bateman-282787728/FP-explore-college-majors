This movie helped inspire me to do lay volunteer work around the world.I've owned this movie on VHS for years, and when I saw it was offered on DVD, I was excited to finally own it on disc. UNFORTUNATELY, the DVD is simply a TRANSFER of a VHS. It is extremely poor quality. It is NOT a scan or transfer of the original FILM elements.So if you own the VHS, you might consider just keeping what you have. I'm returning this because I am so disappointed in the quality of this DVD--NOT in the quality of the original movie or message.If you don't own the VHS, you may consider buying this DVD as it's a wonderful portrayal of Mother Teresa's life. It's just unfortunate that they transferred it from a VHS the way people can do at home on their own.",3,Movie GREAT!

431192,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,6304677189,Margaret Opine,"[1, 3]","THAT THE VIDEO IS OKAY but it could have been better without that statement being any reflection on Mother Teresa. I was hoping to learn more about the times when she had doubts and how she cured herself of them.  Mother Teresa said that when two people marry they are to ""cleave"" together as one...even more, ""become one.""  This she was teaching to her novices to get them to understand what they are undertaking as ""brides"" of Jesus though she never used that word.  But she did not use the word ""committment"" and ""devotion"" in her lesson but she wanted them to cling closely to the word ""cleave"" so they would know what they were getting themselves into.I thought of marriage then, as in spouses, as in partners for life, with the word 'cleave' in my mind..  Marriage, parenting, devotion, committment to...and that includes a committment to a job so that earn a retirement. It's as if we live our lives as little flowers or some other word or metaphor but all in all, we are to work hard (work is essential in Mother Teresa's way of life; it's good for you and it keeps you devoted; Booker T. Washington warned the people that they should not have all comfort in life that some struggle rather 'shines' and 'polishes' the soul for a really good life experience; my words, not his) but to dedicate one's self for an entire lifetime with no break for anything else, especially SELF; well, let's say: Ayn Rand would not be impressed. That's why I wanted to know more about her doubtful moments because here in our world called democratic capitalism we are prepared to change: change spouses, change addresses, change careers, change religions, change callings: CHANGE!!!  Therefore, we look at Mother's Teresa's calling (and though we adore her forever) we are left with a lot of questions about how much is too much, about how long is too long, and what price glory, and even: what else is there for me to do that I like more than what I'm doing? [I'm left with an interpretation I'll call: FOREVER IN A DAY and I'll admit that I have Mother's Teresa's career on my mind and one-time marriage on my mind, which infers: NO CHANGE. But then YOU can step up to the plate and remind me that all this one-time stuff in a person's life, without a lot of change, means that a person is building something that is likely to last a very long time, a very long time. So,that's why do it!Even so, a giant question I wanted asked: ""Do you have an opinion that has formed over the years as to how people became so destitute?  Is there a pattern or are the rest of us just lucky?""  Well the Indian People have responded to that question with this sort of thinking: ""Oh, this is just one of your lives; you will come back in other lives that might be better. It depends. So be kind to the poor and wretched. They can't help it. They are in a life that is wretched for a reason.""Mother Teresa let a government official know that she did not want to give up the land where the nuns were taking care of the sick and destitute.  This was in a South American country.  The government official spoke directly to Mother Teresa and let her know that they wanted the land to build progress (a shopping mall) and again the young official spoke carefully but assuredly.  Then suddenly Mother Teresa said, ""I want the sisters to remain here but we will accept whatever and where ever you put us.  We only want to serve Jesus.""  The government official was caught and she gasped in shock.  It was obvious she had been whipped.  The next thing in the video had the narrator telling us that not only did they give up that land the officials came back and gave Mother Teresa even more land and some other contrite offerings as well.Still, I wanted even more intimacy with Mother Teresa.  I wanted to know more about her person and I wanted to know if she wanted to teach how to remain faithful to your calling (and marriage and family is a calling) and even ask her if she thinks one should ever move on........""to something better""?--MO",4,Everybody says 5-stars but it's okay to say....,1292630400,"12 18, 2010",2010,4008,"['THE', 'VIDEO', 'IS', 'OKAY', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'statement', 'being', 'reflection', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'was', 'hoping', 'learn', 'more', 'times', 'when', 'had', 'doubts', 'how', 'cured', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'said', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'marry', 'are', 'cleave', 'together', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'become', 'one', 'was', 'teaching', 'novices', 'get', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'undertaking', 'brides', 'Jesus', 'never', 'used', 'word', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'word', 'committment', 'devotion', 'lesson', 'wanted', 'cling', 'closely', 'word', 'cleave', 'would', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'into.I', 'thought', 'marriage', 'then', 'spouses', 'partners', 'life', 'word', ""'cleave"", 'mind..', 'Marriage', 'parenting', 'devotion', 'committment', 'committment', 'job', 'earn', 'retirement', 'live', 'lives', 'little', 'flowers', 'other', 'word', 'metaphor', 'are', 'work', 'hard', 'work', 'essential', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'way', 'life', 'good', 'devoted', 'Booker', 'T.', 'Washington', 'warned', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'comfort', 'life', 'struggle', 'rather', ""'polishes"", 'soul', 'really', 'good', 'life', 'experience', 'words', 'not', 'dedicate', 'one', 'self', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'break', 'anything', 'else', 'especially', 'SELF', 'well', 'let', 'say', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'why', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'doubtful', 'moments', 'here', 'world', 'called', 'democratic', 'capitalism', 'are', 'prepared', 'change', 'change', 'spouses', 'change', 'addresses', 'change', 'careers', 'change', 'religions', 'change', 'callings', 'CHANGE', 'Therefore', 'look', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'calling', 'adore', 'forever', 'are', 'left', 'lot', 'questions', 'how', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'long', 'too', 'long', 'what', 'price', 'glory', 'even', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'do', 'like', 'more', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', '[', ""'m"", 'left', 'interpretation', ""'ll"", 'call', 'FOREVER', 'IN', 'A', 'DAY', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'have', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'career', 'mind', 'one-time', 'marriage', 'mind', 'infers', 'CHANGE', 'then', 'YOU', 'can', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'remind', 'one-time', 'stuff', 'person', 'life', 'lot', 'change', 'person', 'building', 'something', 'likely', 'last', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'Even', 'so', 'giant', 'question', 'wanted', 'asked', 'Do', 'have', 'opinion', 'formed', 'years', 'how', 'people', 'became', 'so', 'destitute', 'there', 'pattern', 'are', 'rest', 'just', 'lucky', 'Well', 'Indian', 'People', 'have', 'responded', 'question', 'sort', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'just', 'one', 'lives', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'other', 'lives', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'So', 'be', 'kind', 'poor', 'wretched', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'are', 'life', 'wretched', 'reason', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'let', 'government', 'official', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'land', 'where', 'nuns', 'were', 'taking', 'care', 'sick', 'destitute', 'was', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'government', 'official', 'spoke', 'directly', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'let', 'know', 'wanted', 'land', 'build', 'progress', 'shopping', 'mall', 'again', 'young', 'official', 'spoke', 'carefully', 'assuredly', 'Then', 'suddenly', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'said', 'want', 'sisters', 'remain', 'here', 'will', 'accept', 'where', 'ever', 'put', 'only', 'want', 'serve', 'Jesus', 'government', 'official', 'was', 'caught', 'gasped', 'shock', 'was', 'obvious', 'had', 'been', 'whipped', 'next', 'thing', 'video', 'had', 'narrator', 'telling', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'give', 'up', 'land', 'officials', 'came', 'back', 'gave', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'even', 'more', 'land', 'other', 'contrite', 'offerings', 'well.Still', 'wanted', 'even', 'more', 'intimacy', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'person', 'wanted', 'know', 'wanted', 'teach', 'how', 'remain', 'faithful', 'calling', 'marriage', 'family', 'calling', 'even', 'ask', 'one', 'should', 'ever', 'move', '..', 'something', 'better', 'MO']",Mother Teresa VHS
431193,A68QXK0H88J4I,6304677189,matt,"[29, 29]","If you ever wonder what the meaning of love and suffering is, this penetrating view of the life and work of Mother Teresa and her band of merry nuns will most likely leave you a different person if you act on the impulse that it will leave you with. I have shown this film to over a hundred people and every single person, Christian to atheist, has been bettered by it. The product review above gives a fine summary, and I can only add that if we take seriously the call of Jesus to love one another as He has loved us, then each one of us will find a way to express kindness and aid to those around us.A major message of the film is that small acts done with great love reveal the power of God and bring Christ in our midst, Who is present in the poor and lonely. We don't need to travel overseas to love the poor. We need only to walk down the road and really see a stranger's need, call a relative we have forgotten or snubbed, visit a nursing home. A nun once told a seeker who had asked how a person can know if they love God. She replied, think about the person you hate the most, for that is how much you really love God our Father. Mother Teresa confronts us with both our weaker and stronger selves.
