The blu-ray is beautiful, and it comes dubbed in about a dozen languages, but there are no English subtitles or closed captioning! I'm ridiculously disappointed in DreamWorks and Samsung for putting out a copy of a childrens' movie in the year 2010 without subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing kids in the audience.We'll have to sell this used because we can't watch it in my household.

I received the package, which says the complete collection (the disc box cover was broken) but inside it contained only 3 discs with a card where the 4th disk (and movie) are supposed to be able to redeem the card for the 4th disc.  Not what I expected as the offer was for the COMPLETE collection, but okay, still not an issue as if says &#34;your free 3D copy of Shrek Forever After awaits you&#34;.  I go to the order form and it asks for serial number and original UPC to redeem.  There is no UPC on the disc box cover (which says for promotional use only, not for retail).  The card also gives the option for online redemption.  However, the online redemption also asks for serial number and model number which are not to be found.So, long story short, I have no way of obtaining the 4th movie I paid for when I purchased the &#34;complete 4 disc collection&#34;, the disc box cover is broke, and apparently what I purchased was not supposed to be sold.",1,"the ""complete"" 4 disc series only comes with 3 of the 4 movies",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,1013,"['ordered', 'COMPLETE', '4', 'disc', 'collection', 'Shrek', '3D', 'received', 'package', 'complete', 'collection', 'disc', 'box', 'cover', 'was', 'broken', 'contained', 'only', '3', 'discs', 'card', 'where', '4th', 'disk', 'movie', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'redeem', 'card', '4th', 'disc', 'Not', 'what', 'expected', 'offer', 'was', 'COMPLETE', 'collection', 'okay', 'still', 'not', 'issue', '34', 'free', '3D', 'copy', 'Shrek', 'Forever', 'awaits', '34', 'go', 'order', 'form', 'serial', 'number', 'original', 'UPC', 'redeem', 'UPC', 'disc', 'box', 'cover', 'promotional', 'use', 'only', 'not', 'retail', 'card', 'also', 'option', 'online', 'redemption', 'However', 'online', 'redemption', 'also', 'serial', 'number', 'model', 'number', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'found.So', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'have', 'way', 'obtaining', '4th', 'movie', 'paid', 'when', 'purchased', '34', 'complete', '4', 'disc', 'collection', '34', 'disc', 'box', 'cover', 'broke', 'apparently', 'what', 'purchased', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'sold']",N/A
