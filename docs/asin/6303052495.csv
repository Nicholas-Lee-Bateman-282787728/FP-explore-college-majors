It's about a 3rd generation London Zoo lion named 'Christian', that acts like a human...and his eventual introduction into a life with wild lions in Africa. Much of the film centers around George Adamson, and how he forms a pride of lions out of rehabilitated, orphan cubs. Which is just amazing.Never have i seen such love displayed by ""ferocious beasts"". 'Christian' is a cat like no other. He will surely touch your heart.We found it on a $1 DVD, at Family Dollar. It's a double feature disc with another family film ('Lil'Scratch'), on the opposite side, about an orphaned bear cub. The transfer quality isn't that good, but the story makes up for it.It has some sad scenes and shows carcasses of large mammals, so viewer discretion is advised.A very powerful and moving experience.***** 5 Stars.

Lewis ""the lantern""","[0, 0]","This is the story of Christian the Lion, so as the song tells us (!), from a London zoo, and furniture store, and finally to the African wild, and to an encounter with a wonderful elderly man named George Adamson.  There are a number of different cuts and encasements of this story: but this is the original right footage right here.  It does not, contain, evidently, *all* the old footage, but it does contain the essential footage - that is, at least from what I know, and I have seen three versions...  Additionally, this DVD is the 'vintage presentation', which I rather enjoy, with the 'song of Christian' running merrily through it.  Yes, this film does tend to be somewhat grainer; but it is not a nuisance, and is still wonderfully enchanting.  But really all versions of this remarkable story must prove a gripping experience!

It is a decent enough attempt to put out a public domain copy of a 16mm film, but therein lies the problem. The PD version of this film is missing a few minutes. (Theofficial DVD titled Christian: The Lion at World's Endis complete.) Even the credits are not all there on the HSV DVD.Because of its source, the picture is a bit soft compared to the official DVD, as well.Heck, even the picture on the cover is just a generic lion picture; it's not Christian.Good enough to get by, but I don't really know why this DVD is around when theofficial DVDis available.",3,Christian the Lion DVD by HSV.,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,617,"['am', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'HSV', 'Hollywood', 'Select', 'Video', 'decent', 'enough', 'attempt', 'put', 'out', 'public', 'domain', 'copy', '16mm', 'film', 'therein', 'problem', 'PD', 'version', 'film', 'missing', 'few', 'minutes', 'Theofficial', 'DVD', 'titled', 'Christian', 'Lion', 'World', 'Endis', 'complete', 'Even', 'credits', 'are', 'not', 'all', 'there', 'HSV', 'DVD.Because', 'source', 'picture', 'bit', 'soft', 'compared', 'official', 'DVD', 'well.Heck', 'even', 'picture', 'cover', 'just', 'generic', 'lion', 'picture', 'not', 'Christian.Good', 'enough', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'DVD', 'when', 'theofficial', 'DVDis', 'available']",Christian the Lion VHS

353483,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6303052495,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","I wanted to to see ""Christian the Lion,"" having read the book by John Rendall and Ace Bourke years ago. Christian was purchased in Harrods Department Store in London in 1969 by Rendall and Bourke, who raised him in a boutique in the city until he became too big to keep in captivity any longer. Not wishing to put him in a zoo, they made contact with noted lion expert George Adamson of ""Born Free"" fame through actors Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna. Ultimately Christian was flown to Africa where he was acclimated to the wild for the first time in his life (his parents were in a zoo) by Adamson.The film documents Christian's life up through Rendall and Bourke's now-famous reunion with a very grown up Christian, film footage of which is ubiquitous on the Internet. The film is genuinely touching and speaks to the power of the human-animal bond, even in animals like giant predatory cats. I have always loved big cats, and greatly admire the work Adamson did until he was murdered by Somali bandits on August 20, 1989 at the age of 83. He was trying to help a tourist. Adamson was buried on his preserve in Kenya next to his beloved lion ""Boy,"" who is heavily featured in this film and became Christian's mentor and friend as much as was Adamson himself.I think the world owes a debt of gratitude to Rendell and Bourke for trying to do the right thing for Christian, even though they knew it would mean a shorter and more strife-filled life than if he lived his days out in a zoo. They understood that lions need to be free, and although I cannot imagine letting an animal I loved as much as they loved Christian move halfway across the world and enter such a savage life, they understood the importance of big cats in their natural habitat and I salute them. I couldn't stop thinking about the selflessness of their decision and the lifetime devotion of Adamson to the lions when I watched this film, and while the movie is sometimes painful, it is a wonderful tribute to these men and all the others who helped Christian realize his full potential.",5,"Christian: King Of The Beasts, Friend To Man",1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,2058,"['wanted', 'see', 'Christian', 'Lion', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'John', 'Rendall', 'Ace', 'Bourke', 'years', 'ago', 'Christian', 'was', 'purchased', 'Harrods', 'Department', 'Store', 'London', '1969', 'Rendall', 'Bourke', 'who', 'raised', 'boutique', 'city', 'became', 'too', 'big', 'keep', 'captivity', 'longer', 'Not', 'wishing', 'put', 'zoo', 'made', 'contact', 'noted', 'lion', 'expert', 'George', 'Adamson', 'Born', 'Free', 'fame', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Travers', 'Virginia', 'McKenna', 'Ultimately', 'Christian', 'was', 'flown', 'Africa', 'where', 'was', 'acclimated', 'wild', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'parents', 'were', 'zoo', 'Adamson.The', 'film', 'documents', 'Christian', 'life', 'up', 'Rendall', 'Bourke', 'now-famous', 'reunion', 'very', 'grown', 'up', 'Christian', 'film', 'footage', 'ubiquitous', 'Internet', 'film', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'power', 'human-animal', 'bond', 'even', 'animals', 'giant', 'predatory', 'cats', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'big', 'cats', 'greatly', 'admire', 'work', 'Adamson', 'did', 'was', 'murdered', 'Somali', 'bandits', 'August', '20', '1989', 'age', '83', 'was', 'trying', 'help', 'tourist', 'Adamson', 'was', 'buried', 'preserve', 'Kenya', 'next', 'beloved', 'lion', 'Boy', 'who', 'heavily', 'featured', 'film', 'became', 'Christian', 'mentor', 'friend', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'Adamson', 'himself.I', 'think', 'world', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'Rendell', 'Bourke', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Christian', 'even', 'knew', 'would', 'mean', 'shorter', 'more', 'strife-filled', 'life', 'lived', 'days', 'out', 'zoo', 'understood', 'lions', 'need', 'be', 'free', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'letting', 'animal', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'Christian', 'move', 'halfway', 'world', 'enter', 'such', 'savage', 'life', 'understood', 'importance', 'big', 'cats', 'natural', 'habitat', 'salute', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'selflessness', 'decision', 'lifetime', 'devotion', 'Adamson', 'lions', 'when', 'watched', 'film', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'men', 'others', 'who', 'helped', 'Christian', 'realize', 'full', 'potential']",Christian the Lion VHS
