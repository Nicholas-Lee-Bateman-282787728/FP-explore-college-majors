257661,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630159942X,Acute Observer,"[1, 2]","Pride of the Yankees, 1942 filmThis is the Hollywood biography of Lou Gehrig, who died before this move was produced. Lou was talented in baseball (and other sports), went to Columbia, and then the New York Yankees baseball club. It was unusual for a college graduate to become a baseball player then. Most had a grammar school education at best, left school to work at 14, played on a company team until their talents were noticed. This film presents a view of life and culture before WW II. You get a chance to see Babe Ruth (as himself), other Yankee players, and the old stadiums. [They did not need taxpayer subsidies in those days.] Lou's mother expected him to become a professional and work in an office, not as an entertainer. Fame and fortune are there, then afterwards an ordinary job like an accountant or engineer.Teams and people traveled by train. Players gambled with cards on the train. Ruth's straw hat is nibbled. [An example of rough humor by baseball players, whose careers can end with any serious injury.] Eleanor Twichell meets Lou Gehrig. [Marry the boss' daughter?] They visit a carnival, an entertainment that is as obsolete as those steam trains. There is a pair of ballroom dancers to provide entertainment, serve as symbolism, and pad out the story. ""I'll be loving you always."" [Note the names of the cities, all east of the Mississippi except St. Louis.] There is the famous scene where the Babe promises a home run for a sick boy. Can you do anything if you try hard enough? Lou hits two home runs in a World Series game! These scenes tell of pre-war America [no mention of the Great Depression].Lou returns home with Eleanor - a surprise party. We see a woman scrubbing a floor on her knees. ""It's second hand."" ""It's an antique."" ""Can't we afford new?"" Can a mother-in-law be too authoritarian? Can she know her limits? [No church wedding?] A honeymoon in Yankee stadium? [Lou loves his job.] Baseball star Lou has perquisites on the highway. [Simpler times, and a lot less traffic.] Did they have a perfect marriage? Lou wants to keep his personal life private. Lou sets a record for playing 2,000 consecutive games.""I won"" says Eleanor. But something is wrong! Lou has a problem with his shoulder. He tries exercise, but to no avail. ""I can't make it anymore."" Lou visits the Scripps Clinic. ""It's three strikes."" Elly surmises the truth. There is a celebration for ""Lou Gehrig Day"". Lou thanks his fans, his teammates, his parents. He considers himself ""the luckiest man on the face of the earth"". And so he leaves the playing field. The ending is implied, and a symbol for the future of many other Americans who were not famous in the coming years.",5,The Lou Gehrig Story,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,2687,"['Pride', 'Yankees', '1942', 'filmThis', 'Hollywood', 'biography', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'who', 'died', 'move', 'was', 'produced', 'Lou', 'was', 'talented', 'baseball', 'other', 'sports', 'went', 'Columbia', 'then', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'baseball', 'club', 'was', 'unusual', 'college', 'graduate', 'become', 'baseball', 'player', 'then', 'Most', 'had', 'grammar', 'school', 'education', 'best', 'left', 'school', 'work', '14', 'played', 'company', 'team', 'talents', 'were', 'noticed', 'film', 'view', 'life', 'culture', 'WW', 'II', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'other', 'Yankee', 'players', 'old', 'stadiums', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'taxpayer', 'subsidies', 'days', ']', 'Lou', 'mother', 'expected', 'become', 'professional', 'work', 'office', 'not', 'entertainer', 'Fame', 'fortune', 'are', 'there', 'then', 'ordinary', 'job', 'accountant', 'engineer.Teams', 'people', 'traveled', 'train', 'Players', 'gambled', 'cards', 'train', 'Ruth', 'straw', 'hat', 'nibbled', '[', 'example', 'rough', 'humor', 'baseball', 'players', 'careers', 'can', 'end', 'serious', 'injury', 'Eleanor', 'Twichell', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', '[', 'Marry', 'boss', 'daughter', 'visit', 'carnival', 'entertainment', 'as', 'obsolete', 'steam', 'trains', 'pair', 'ballroom', 'dancers', 'provide', 'entertainment', 'serve', 'symbolism', 'out', 'story', ""'ll"", 'be', 'loving', 'always', '[', 'Note', 'names', 'cities', 'east', 'Mississippi', 'St', 'Louis', ']', 'famous', 'scene', 'where', 'Babe', 'home', 'run', 'sick', 'boy', 'Can', 'do', 'anything', 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'Lou', 'two', 'home', 'runs', 'World', 'Series', 'game', 'scenes', 'tell', 'pre-war', 'America', '[', 'mention', 'Great', 'Depression', ']', '.Lou', 'home', 'Eleanor', 'surprise', 'party', 'see', 'woman', 'scrubbing', 'floor', 'knees', 'second', 'hand', 'antique', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'new', 'Can', 'mother-in-law', 'be', 'too', 'authoritarian', 'Can', 'know', 'limits', '[', 'church', 'wedding', ']', 'honeymoon', 'Yankee', 'stadium', '[', 'Lou', 'job', ']', 'Baseball', 'star', 'Lou', 'perquisites', 'highway', 'Simpler', 'times', 'lot', 'less', 'traffic', ']', 'Did', 'have', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'Lou', 'keep', 'personal', 'life', 'private', 'Lou', 'record', 'playing', '2,000', 'consecutive', 'games', 'won', 'Eleanor', 'something', 'wrong', 'Lou', 'problem', 'shoulder', 'exercise', 'avail', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'anymore', 'Lou', 'Scripps', 'Clinic', 'three', 'strikes', 'Elly', 'truth', 'celebration', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Day', 'Lou', 'thanks', 'fans', 'teammates', 'parents', 'luckiest', 'man', 'face', 'earth', 'so', 'playing', 'field', 'ending', 'implied', 'symbol', 'future', 'many', 'other', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'famous', 'coming', 'years']",N/A

There are a few blemishes (speckles) but nothing to get riled up about. There are yellow optional subtitles and clear and consistent mono audio. No extras at all where to properly celebrate the 65 Anniversary you would think some video featurette or commentary would be called for.

His parent's hopes are set on Lou becoming like his Uncle Otto, a successful engineer. Baseball means nothing to them but trouble until Lou shows he is the best.Lou falls in love with Miss Twitchell. She soon becomes Mrs. Gehrig, played by Teresa Wright, his doting wife, reminiscent of Donna Reed's character in ""It's a Wonderful Life."" A storybook life follows, and Lou outshines his childhood hero the Sultan of Swat, played by Babe Ruth himself.You know how it ends. Lou contracts what is now known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He not only must end his Iron Horse record of playing 2,130 straight games, but knows his life is ending. He retires and America swoons in grief. His retirement speech is full of dignity and power, and nothing like it has ever been seen since. The actual speech is barely edited in the movie.Impressive is not just the life of Lou Gehrig. It is also the respect of his teammates, especially Babe Ruth. Ruth was in his last years of playing when Gehrig showed up. However, as he saw how Ruth really lived as an undisciplined show-off, some rifts between them followed. When push came to shove, both on the field and during Ruth's retirement, they respected each other's abilities. Ruth did not need to be in the movie. His status as a legend was secure. He came to honor a great man. Ruth's presence and self-effacement is crucial to appreciate the depth of Gehrig's character.I bought into every character, from Gehrig's parents, to Gary Cooper as Gehrig, to the goofy cop who catches Gehrig nervously approaching Twitchell's door on his way to propose.The movie seems like part fantasy -- Could anyone be that decent of a guy? Further reading will tell you yes. It is that quality of humanity that might make it unpopular today, as movie goers are used to the antihero and imperfect man saving the day.""Pride of the Yankees"" might be a great movie that has passed its prime. The movie includes a strong message that immigrants are a great part of the American dream. The possibilities of America are still true, as seen through the current evidence of throngs of Mexican immigrants, but a patriotic movie might be snidely received by cynics and critics. Baseball also has found itself tainted by steroids, and today's homerun heroes are suspect.I fully recommend ""Pride of the Yankees.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,We Need Another Lou Gehrig.,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2859,"['Gary', 'Cooper', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'one', 'greatest', 'players', 'ever', 'wear', 'uniform', 'sport.In', 'one', 'movie', 'are', 'given', 'hero', 'who', 'out', 'dream', 'celebrity', 'who', 'did', 'more', 'off-camera', 'husband', 'who', 'wife', 'parents', 'who', 'sacrifice', 'so', 'son', 'may', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'parents', 'in-laws', 'sports', 'star', 'who', 'never', 'cheated', 'game', 'wife.It', 'could', 'be', 'perfect', 'family', 'movie.Lou', 'born', 'immigrant', 'parents', 'who', 'believe', 'traditional', 'America', 'parent', 'hopes', 'are', 'set', 'Lou', 'becoming', 'Uncle', 'Otto', 'successful', 'engineer', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'Lou', 'shows', 'best.Lou', 'love', 'Miss', 'Twitchell', 'soon', 'Mrs.', 'Gehrig', 'played', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'doting', 'wife', 'reminiscent', 'Donna', 'Reed', 'character', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'storybook', 'life', 'Lou', 'childhood', 'hero', 'Sultan', 'Swat', 'played', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'himself.You', 'know', 'how', 'Lou', 'contracts', 'what', 'now', 'known', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'disease', 'not', 'only', 'must', 'end', 'Iron', 'Horse', 'record', 'playing', '2,130', 'straight', 'games', 'life', 'ending', 'America', 'swoons', 'grief', 'retirement', 'speech', 'full', 'dignity', 'power', 'nothing', 'ever', 'been', 'seen', 'actual', 'speech', 'barely', 'edited', 'movie.Impressive', 'not', 'just', 'life', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'also', 'respect', 'teammates', 'especially', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Ruth', 'was', 'last', 'years', 'playing', 'when', 'Gehrig', 'showed', 'up', 'However', 'saw', 'how', 'Ruth', 'really', 'lived', 'undisciplined', 'show-off', 'rifts', 'followed', 'When', 'push', 'came', 'shove', 'field', 'Ruth', 'retirement', 'respected', 'other', 'abilities', 'Ruth', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'movie', 'status', 'legend', 'was', 'secure', 'came', 'honor', 'great', 'man', 'Ruth', 'presence', 'self-effacement', 'crucial', 'appreciate', 'depth', 'Gehrig', 'character.I', 'bought', 'character', 'Gehrig', 'parents', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Gehrig', 'goofy', 'cop', 'who', 'Gehrig', 'nervously', 'approaching', 'Twitchell', 'door', 'way', 'propose.The', 'movie', 'part', 'fantasy', 'Could', 'anyone', 'be', 'decent', 'guy', 'Further', 'reading', 'will', 'tell', 'yes', 'quality', 'humanity', 'might', 'make', 'unpopular', 'today', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'used', 'antihero', 'imperfect', 'man', 'saving', 'day', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'passed', 'prime', 'movie', 'strong', 'message', 'immigrants', 'are', 'great', 'part', 'American', 'dream', 'possibilities', 'America', 'are', 'still', 'true', 'seen', 'current', 'evidence', 'throngs', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', 'patriotic', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'snidely', 'received', 'cynics', 'critics', 'Baseball', 'also', 'found', 'tainted', 'steroids', 'today', 'homerun', 'heroes', 'are', 'suspect.I', 'fully', 'recommend', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A
257664,A1184B1I5G87YF,630159942X,"Austin ""atticus101""","[2, 2]","Baseball films are run the gamut these days.  You have the great ones like Bull Durham and Eight Men Out to Major League (actually not a half bad movie) silliness to just plain bad For the Love of the Game.  It seems funny to me that probably one of the best baseball movie is about one of the most beloved players on one of the most hated teams in baseball, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees.  The movie, Pride of the Yankees is a must see for any sports fan or anyone with a heartbeat for that matter.The movie follows Lou Gehrig (Gary Cooper), growing up in New York, son of immigrant parents who work themselves into exhaustion to make sure Lou goes to college at Columbia and becomes an engineer.  Gehrig, of course, has other interests and doesn't really want to do engineering but has a passion for baseball and wants to play that for a living.  While playing baseball for Columbia, is discovered by the Yankees who try to get Gehrig to play for them, though Gehrig's mom does not want Lou abandoning his pursuit of being an engineer.  After Gehrig's mother falls ill, he signs with the Yankees to pay for his mother's hospital bills and moves up to New England area to being playing in the minors.  Gehrig and his father keep the secret of Lou's new profession from his mother until circumstance prevent it from being heard any more.  During his rookie season with the Yankees, Gehrig meets his future wife, Eleanor and begins the road to becoming baseball's ""Iron Man"".Pride of the Yankees isn't really isn't a baseball movie outright, but more of a drama/love story with a baseball subplot.  Gary Cooper, who was fresh off his Oscar winning performance in Sergeant York, plays Gehrig superbly.  His humbleness and good nature allow Gehrig to come to life on screen again without allowing the character to become bigger than himself.  Cooper was nominated for another Academy Award for this role but did not win (he lost to James Cagney in Yankee Doodle Dandy), his acting seems more polished and refined than his Oscar winning Sergeant Alvin York.  Cooper was notoriously bad at baseball but, thanks to camera tricks and hard work of Coopers' part, he does his best to recreate to swing and motions of Gehrig on film.The other characters in the film help support it move it along without their scenes feeling rushed.  The baseball writers, played by Walter Brennan and Dan Duryea provide comic relief along with Gehrig's parents Elsa Janssen and Ludwig Stossel.  Teresa Wright has a good turn as Gehrig's wife; Eleanor is played with a mix of All-American girl and socialite suaveness.  In almost all her scenes, Ms. Wright is never allowed the chance to give her character more depth than that of being Ms. Lou Gehrig and even in her scenes without Cooper, we have a visual or audible reminder that Gehrig's presence isn't far off.To top off the film, cameos from some of the real life Yankees are in the film, such as Bill Dickey, Mark Koenig, Bob Meusel, and Babe Ruth, who's turn in the film doesn't show a hint of the supposed rivalry between the Babe and Gehrig.This movie tugs at your heart strings throughout the movie.  The film welcomes you into the Gehrig home and his life growing up and allows you to triumph in all his glories without touching on any real failures along the way.  The movie ends with Gehrig's now famous speech at Yankee stadium in 1939 and then ends with him walking into the shadows of the stadium.  We never see him suffer in the end or the trauma done to his family, though the ending is powerful enough to make you think you did see all these things and more.A great movie for all ages to see, especially history and sports fans, this movie is a true classic that deserves to be rediscovered.",5,Great historical baseball film,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,3730,"['films', 'are', 'run', 'gamut', 'days', 'have', 'great', 'ones', 'Bull', 'Durham', 'Eight', 'Men', 'Out', 'Major', 'League', 'actually', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'movie', 'silliness', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Love', 'Game', 'funny', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'baseball', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'players', 'one', 'most', 'hated', 'teams', 'baseball', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Yankees', 'movie', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'must', 'see', 'sports', 'fan', 'anyone', 'heartbeat', 'matter.The', 'movie', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'growing', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'son', 'immigrant', 'parents', 'who', 'work', 'exhaustion', 'make', 'sure', 'Lou', 'college', 'Columbia', 'engineer', 'Gehrig', 'course', 'other', 'interests', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'do', 'engineering', 'passion', 'baseball', 'play', 'living', 'playing', 'baseball', 'Columbia', 'discovered', 'Yankees', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'Gehrig', 'play', 'Gehrig', 'mom', 'not', 'want', 'Lou', 'abandoning', 'pursuit', 'being', 'engineer', 'Gehrig', 'mother', 'ill', 'signs', 'Yankees', 'pay', 'mother', 'hospital', 'bills', 'up', 'New', 'England', 'area', 'being', 'playing', 'minors', 'Gehrig', 'father', 'keep', 'secret', 'Lou', 'new', 'profession', 'mother', 'circumstance', 'prevent', 'being', 'heard', 'more', 'rookie', 'season', 'Yankees', 'Gehrig', 'future', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'road', 'becoming', 'baseball', 'Iron', 'Man', '.Pride', 'Yankees', ""n't"", 'really', ""n't"", 'baseball', 'movie', 'outright', 'more', 'drama/love', 'story', 'baseball', 'subplot', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'who', 'was', 'fresh', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'performance', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'Gehrig', 'superbly', 'humbleness', 'good', 'nature', 'allow', 'Gehrig', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'again', 'allowing', 'character', 'become', 'bigger', 'Cooper', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'lost', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Yankee', 'Doodle', 'Dandy', 'acting', 'more', 'polished', 'refined', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Sergeant', 'Alvin', 'York', 'Cooper', 'was', 'notoriously', 'bad', 'baseball', 'thanks', 'camera', 'tricks', 'hard', 'work', 'Coopers', 'part', 'best', 'recreate', 'swing', 'motions', 'Gehrig', 'film.The', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'help', 'support', 'move', 'along', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'rushed', 'baseball', 'writers', 'played', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'provide', 'comic', 'relief', 'Gehrig', 'parents', 'Elsa', 'Janssen', 'Ludwig', 'Stossel', 'Teresa', 'Wright', 'good', 'turn', 'Gehrig', 'wife', 'Eleanor', 'played', 'mix', 'All-American', 'girl', 'socialite', 'suaveness', 'almost', 'scenes', 'Ms.', 'Wright', 'never', 'allowed', 'chance', 'give', 'character', 'more', 'depth', 'being', 'Ms.', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'even', 'scenes', 'Cooper', 'have', 'visual', 'audible', 'reminder', 'Gehrig', 'presence', ""n't"", 'far', 'off.To', 'top', 'film', 'cameos', 'real', 'life', 'Yankees', 'are', 'film', 'such', 'Bill', 'Dickey', 'Mark', 'Koenig', 'Bob', 'Meusel', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'who', 'turn', 'film', ""n't"", 'show', 'hint', 'supposed', 'rivalry', 'Babe', 'Gehrig.This', 'movie', 'tugs', 'heart', 'strings', 'movie', 'film', 'Gehrig', 'home', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'triumph', 'glories', 'touching', 'real', 'failures', 'way', 'movie', 'Gehrig', 'now', 'famous', 'speech', 'Yankee', 'stadium', '1939', 'then', 'walking', 'shadows', 'stadium', 'never', 'see', 'suffer', 'end', 'trauma', 'done', 'family', 'ending', 'powerful', 'enough', 'make', 'think', 'did', 'see', 'things', 'more.A', 'great', 'movie', 'ages', 'see', 'especially', 'history', 'sports', 'fans', 'movie', 'true', 'classic', 'be', 'rediscovered']",N/A

There are scenes that run far too long or are often repeated throughout, causing an interminable drag in the pacing of the film. Sometimes, they are too much to take. One particular scene where Lou Gehrig the kid hits a home run is hysterical in a bad way because the ball did not actually come from his bat but all the way on the left side. In other words, it's fair to assume that the kid couldn't hit worth squat. So, either the certain scenes be cut out and replaced with diverse ones or the length of the film be significantly cut down to 90 minutes total is an ideal way to go about it. Babe Ruth looks like a total boob and is somewhat of a caricature. On the other hand, Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright are very good and do everything as they can in their roles.

Gary Cooper was the perfect choice to play Lou Gehrig and so was Teresa Wright to play his wife.  As a matter of fact the entire cast is first rate.  The production values are as only the great Sam Goldwyn could make them.  The cinematography and the screenplay are perfection and that Musical Score with the haunting Irving Berlin tune ""Always""!!!  Ahh, how can anyone not love this film, replete with so many touching scenes!  I can't name them all...but here are a few:  Lou signing his contract with the Yankees so his mother can have a decent private room in the hospital when she gets sick; Lou introducing his wife to be Ellie to his mother for the first time with the mother reacting a little coldly and the hurt that registers on Teresa Wright's face; the wallpaper scene between Lou's Mother and Teresa Wright; The hospital scene with Billy, the crippled boy and Lou promising him to hit 2 home runs for him and the following scenes at the baseball field with him doing that; the scene with Lou and Ellie wrestling on the floor where Lou has one of his first spells indicating his disease; the scene where the doctors and Lou try to keep Ellie from finding out just how serious Lou's disease is; the scene outside the baseball field with a grown up Billy showing Lou that he can walk now...(a real tearjerker) and of course...the ending with the famous Lou Gehrig (I am the luckiest man alive..).  Have a box of kleenex handy for this one.  One would have to be the most cynical, hard hearted person not to be affected by this beautiful film.The DVD has no extras other than scene selection.

It's interesting to note that Cooper was physically all wrong for the part. He was 40 years old, too tall, too thin and he was so inept at swinging a bat left-handed that they actually filmed him right-handed, transposed the number 4 on his back and flipped the film (a true story). Watch him running around the basepads... the actual baseball portions of this film are not high quality or believable. This is a small criticism, since the baseball shots are relatively few.However, the human story, however sentimental, is told with dignity and some brilliant acting. Babe Ruth appears as himself, and the Babe gives a truly fine performance; he had indisputable talent on the big screen. Watch the hat-eating scene, it's fabulous. One wishes that the screenwriters would have focused on Babe a little more often. Walter Brennan is outstanding, as always, and Teresa Wright is suitably cute and winning as the dying hero's wife.There are some extremely dated scenes in the movie, especially the lengthy, boring dance sequence. Fast forward through that one. Lou's parents are also a little annoying at times, especially his whining mother. The ending of the movie is a tear jerker, as Cooper delivers Gehrig's farewell speech in a beautifully understated manner.

257681,A315K47GRB024C,630159942X,Daniel C. Markel,"[7, 7]","This review is for the DVD released by MGM in 2002.The Pride of the Yankees is the story of baseball Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig.  His nickname was the ""Iron Horse"" which he earned for playing 2,130 consecutive games for the New York Yankees from the mid 1920's to the late 1930's.  That was a major league record for many years until Cal Ripken Jr. broke it 1995.  Of course Lou Gehrig will also be remembered as a courageous man who died from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, sometimes also referred to as ""Lou Gehrig's Disease"".The movie stars Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig.  The movie is a gem and has essentially four facets to it.  One area of lengthy coverage was his relationship with his domineering German mother (played by Elsa Janssen).  A second subplot is courting and marrying his wife (played by Teresa Wright).  The third subject of lengthy coverage was his great baseball career and the final facet of the film was Gehrig facing his mortality at a relatively early age.  Of course these four areas overlap into each other throughout the movie.  From a personal viewpoint, I would have liked to have seen a lot more about his baseball career and less of his love life.  (I'm sure this was done intentionally to get women to into the theaters.)  The movie is sugarcoated and squeaky clean and very corny at times, but personally I'd rather watch a movie like this than films like the Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb movies that were made in the 1990's where they exposed all of the dirty laundry in their private lives.Pride of the Yankees is a classic, especially with the unforgettable ""I consider myself the luckiest guy on the face of the earth"" speech at Yankee Stadium.  Another wonderful treat is to see Babe Ruth play himself in the movie and there are also a few brief scenes with another Yankee great: Bill Dickey.  Another nice feature were the shots of the various American League ball barks Gehrig played in.  It was also great to see some shots of the old grandstands of Yankee Stadium before it was renovated in the mid-`70s.  Overall, this a movie the whole family, from 6 to 96, can enjoy.The DVD picture quality is outstanding.  The black and white transfer is impeccable.  I don't recall seeing the slightest flaw throughout the entire movie and the sharpness is excellent.  The sound is fine too.  The DVD lacked bonus features which is a shame for a movie that has been so highly acclaimed for so many generations.

The movie itself had some interesting stories regarding how it was filmed.  I had once read an article regarding how they filmed Cooper playing Gehrig.

257686,A1LACH6MLQWZ,630159942X,Doug Erlandson,"[4, 4]","""Pride of the Yankees"" has two things going for it that many sports movies lack. First, it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Gary Cooper, who, whether he is playing Sergeant York or the sheriff in ""High Noon"" or Lou Gehrig, always rises to the top. Second, it is the story of Lou Gehrig, a truly legendary ballplayer, who played in a simpler era long before the age of multimillion dollar contracts and steroids, when character stood for something. And Lou Gehrig, by all accounts, had a stellar character. But the movie is more than a sports movie, for it also takes us into the immigrant home in which he grew up, his love for the game, exemplified by his willingness to play ball with the kids on the neighborhood field, and his ultimately losing battle with ALS.While there are some minor inaccuracies in the movie, they do not in any way detract from the overall story, one that is as compelling today as it was when the movie was first made in 1943. But these are more than offset by the positive message that is conveyed, which is that whether we live a long life or one cut short, as was Gehrig's, it is far better for us to count our blessings than to dwell on our woes. For in every way Gehrig, despite the blow that he was dealt, realized that he had had a great life and was truly thankful for it.This is a movie for everyone, not just for baseball junkies, although the latter will appreciate the cameo appearances of Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, and Bill Dickey, among others.",5,Timeless movie,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,1494,"['Pride', 'Yankees', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'many', 'sports', 'movies', 'lack', 'First', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'time', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'who', 'playing', 'Sergeant', 'York', 'sheriff', 'High', 'Noon', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'always', 'top', 'Second', 'story', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'truly', 'legendary', 'ballplayer', 'who', 'played', 'simpler', 'era', 'long', 'age', 'multimillion', 'dollar', 'contracts', 'steroids', 'when', 'character', 'stood', 'something', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'accounts', 'had', 'stellar', 'character', 'movie', 'more', 'sports', 'movie', 'also', 'immigrant', 'home', 'grew', 'up', 'love', 'game', 'exemplified', 'willingness', 'play', 'ball', 'kids', 'neighborhood', 'field', 'ultimately', 'losing', 'battle', 'ALS.While', 'are', 'minor', 'inaccuracies', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'detract', 'overall', 'story', 'one', 'compelling', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'made', '1943', 'are', 'more', 'offset', 'positive', 'message', 'conveyed', 'live', 'long', 'life', 'one', 'cut', 'short', 'was', 'Gehrig', 'far', 'better', 'count', 'blessings', 'dwell', 'woes', 'way', 'Gehrig', 'blow', 'was', 'dealt', 'realized', 'had', 'had', 'great', 'life', 'was', 'truly', 'thankful', 'it.This', 'movie', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'baseball', 'junkies', 'latter', 'will', 'appreciate', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'Bob', 'Meusel', 'Bill', 'Dickey', 'others']",N/A

All though he onlymanaged the one year, Girardi had a positive affect on the youngMarlins staff (in particular Josh Johnson, Anibal Sanchez, ScottOlsen).  A staff that struggled mightily following Girardi's prematuredeparture.Was it Girardi's overuse of the staff or a coincidence that all ofthese pitchers struggled in 2007?  If it's the former, then Girardican take solace in that the Yankee bullpen is more solid thanFlorida's 2006 version so that question is answered.Torre's makeup is geared more towards veterans.  All though from thisangle it is hard to argue that he didn't use the young pitcherscorrectly.  Most of the Yankee brass seem to believe he misused them.Perhaps this is the reason for their ""insulting"" contract offer toTorre all but sealing his fate.  In addition, Torre has never beenknown for developing young pitchers (Donovan Osbourne and Allen Watsonin St. Louis to name two).The Yankees are hopeful that Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, and maybeeven Alex Rodriguez don't follow Torre to Los Angeles (where he isabout to be named manager) and return to the Bronx and that AndyPettite exercises his 2008 player option.Even though Rodriguez opted out of his deal and unless Agent ScottBoras has a backdoor deal in place, ARod could return (provided theYankees can make it seem like they didn't give in).All things being considered and as much as Yankee fans wanted Torreback, the right move was made.",5,James Fontanetta,1193788800,"10 31, 2007",2007,2210,"['Yankee', 'fan', 'will', 'consider', 'October', '30', '2007', 'bittersweet', 'day.Firstly', 'have', 'Joe', 'Girardi', 'only', '43', 'very', 'much', 'respectedaround', 'baseball', 'named', '32nd', 'Manager', 'storied', 'franchise.In', 'Girardi', 'only', 'year', 'managing', '2006', 'Florida', 'Marlins', 'was', 'namedNational', 'League', 'Manager', 'Year.Then', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'Beloved', 'Yankee', 'skipper', '12', 'years', '12postseason', 'appearances', '6', 'World', 'Series', 'appearances', '4', 'WorldChampionships', 'argument', 'here.So', 'right', 'move', 'turning', 'club', 'much', 'younger', 'manager', 'giving', 'athree-year', 'deal', 'Yankees', 'have', 'created', 'situation', 'themanager', 'incentives', 'more', 'closely', 'reflect', 'long-term', 'goals', 'theclub', 'revolve', 'young', 'pitchers', 'Specifically', 'JabaChamberlain', 'Philip', 'Hughes', 'Ian', 'Kennedy', 'onlymanaged', 'one', 'year', 'Girardi', 'had', 'positive', 'affect', 'youngMarlins', 'staff', 'particular', 'Josh', 'Johnson', 'Anibal', 'Sanchez', 'ScottOlsen', 'staff', 'struggled', 'mightily', 'following', 'Girardi', 'prematuredeparture.Was', 'Girardi', 'overuse', 'staff', 'coincidence', 'ofthese', 'pitchers', 'struggled', '2007', 'former', 'then', 'Girardican', 'take', 'solace', 'Yankee', 'bullpen', 'more', 'solid', 'thanFlorida', '2006', 'version', 'question', 'answered.Torre', 'makeup', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'veterans', 'thisangle', 'hard', 'argue', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'young', 'pitcherscorrectly', 'Most', 'Yankee', 'brass', 'seem', 'believe', 'misused', 'them.Perhaps', 'reason', 'insulting', 'contract', 'offer', 'sealing', 'fate', 'addition', 'Torre', 'never', 'beenknown', 'developing', 'young', 'pitchers', 'Donovan', 'Osbourne', 'Allen', 'Watsonin', 'St.', 'Louis', 'name', 'two', '.The', 'Yankees', 'are', 'hopeful', 'Mariano', 'Rivera', 'Jorge', 'Posada', 'maybeeven', 'Alex', 'Rodriguez', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Torre', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'be', 'named', 'manager', 'return', 'Bronx', 'AndyPettite', '2008', 'player', 'option.Even', 'Rodriguez', 'opted', 'deal', 'Agent', 'ScottBoras', 'backdoor', 'deal', 'place', 'ARod', 'could', 'return', 'provided', 'theYankees', 'can', 'make', 'seem', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '.All', 'things', 'being', 'considered', 'as', 'much', 'Yankee', 'fans', 'wanted', 'Torreback', 'right', 'move', 'was', 'made']",N/A

From photos I have seen of Gehrig himself, Gary Cooper bears a decent resemblance to the legendary Yankee first baseman.  The film is a piece of living history, in that some of Gehrig's teammates, including Babe Ruth, played themselves.  It is a thrill to watch the movie and realize that one is looking at the great Ruth himself (and he does a good job playing himself).  From my admittedly limited knowledge of Gehrig's life, I have the impression that the film is fairly faithful to the facts.The film focuses on Gehrig's personality and character and his family life with less attention given to his relationships with his fellow ballplayers, managers and others in the sports world.  This appears logical to me in that the filmmakers had to choose an approach to Gehrig's life that would fit in a two hour time slot.  Beginning with his humble origins in New York as the son of German immigrants, the story traces Gehrig's career from Columbia University to the New York Yankees.  His happy marriage to Eleanor is a central theme of the film.  Gehrig's humility, decency, strong work ethic and courage are displayed throughout.  His response to the tragedy of his terminal illness should be an example to us all--to be grateful for all the blessings of life and to endure calamity and suffering with fortitude, courage and humor.This is a superb film to share with one's children and other young people--to teach them some American history, to present a sports hero worthy of notice, and to see a real example of great character.",5,A Great Man,1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,1677,"['Pride', 'Yankees', 'excellent', 'film', 'version', 'life', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'most', 'respected', 'baseball', 'players', 'photos', 'have', 'seen', 'Gehrig', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'decent', 'resemblance', 'legendary', 'Yankee', 'first', 'baseman', 'film', 'piece', 'living', 'history', 'Gehrig', 'teammates', 'including', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'played', 'thrill', 'watch', 'movie', 'realize', 'one', 'looking', 'great', 'Ruth', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'admittedly', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'Gehrig', 'life', 'have', 'impression', 'film', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'facts.The', 'film', 'Gehrig', 'personality', 'character', 'family', 'life', 'less', 'attention', 'given', 'relationships', 'fellow', 'ballplayers', 'managers', 'others', 'sports', 'world', 'logical', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'choose', 'approach', 'Gehrig', 'life', 'would', 'fit', 'two', 'hour', 'time', 'slot', 'Beginning', 'humble', 'origins', 'New', 'York', 'son', 'German', 'immigrants', 'story', 'Gehrig', 'career', 'Columbia', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'happy', 'marriage', 'Eleanor', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'Gehrig', 'humility', 'decency', 'strong', 'work', 'ethic', 'courage', 'are', 'displayed', 'response', 'tragedy', 'terminal', 'illness', 'should', 'be', 'example', 'be', 'grateful', 'blessings', 'life', 'endure', 'calamity', 'suffering', 'fortitude', 'courage', 'humor.This', 'superb', 'film', 'share', 'one', 'children', 'other', 'young', 'people', 'teach', 'American', 'history', 'present', 'sports', 'hero', 'worthy', 'notice', 'see', 'real', 'example', 'great', 'character']",N/A

Gary Cooper plays 'The Iron Horse' who came up in 1925 and played over 2000 games, never missing one. The film begins with Lou as a boy growing up playing ball. But he is not just any ball player. Right away a talent is recognized, he has power among other things. Lou is the son of immigrated parents who want to see there only living child make it in America. Lou's mother wants him to become and enginer. He can make money, support a family and live a better than average life. Lou doesn't want to, but tries to go with his mothers wish. College is just something in the way of playing for the Yankees. Along the way the film shows Gehrig's transformation from a boy into a fine ball player. He has to deal non-stop with his mother and her DREAM of him going to some kind of university. But his dream is shown to be some place else. Gehrig goes back to the Bronx in 1925 and never looks back. The Babe and Gehrig will go to war on offensive stats (yet share a mutual respect for one another) for the next decade and Lou would go after more when Ruth retires. Along the way in the film we meet Lou's future wife Eleanor. She will be the center of his life and him hers. The film captures the true character of Gehrig and his ups and downs in life. Dealing with everyday opsticles, he does it with class. Walter Brennan plays a always going after it sports writer and several real life Yankee players play themself. Nonetheless no one plays Ruth, except for himself. And does it well. The film captures a life filled with dreams to achieve and that are, a sport that truely is the greatest and a man who shows the true meaning of the human spirit. Gehrig is brilliantly played by Gary Cooper who won an Oscar nomination (and should have one.) Anything less than great would not have done this film and the life of Gehrig justice, yet it does just that. Being a life long Yankees fan, I don't like this film because it deals with the team, although it's a plus. It's the depth that it takes you too. How a man who had nothing early in life, left with it all and no less a great story of Gehrig's wonderful yet short life! Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, it won for Best Editing.

The mythologized life story of the New York Yankees ""Iron Horse,"" Lou Gehrig, who played an astounding 2,130 consecutive games (and this in the days before Sports Medicine, no apologies to Cal Ripken), PRIDE OF THE YANKEES is a celebration of good old-fashioned Americana. Gehrig, as the gifted only child of German immigrants, is the son we all wish we could have. His tragic death at 38 from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) robbed the world not only of a phenomenal baseball player but of an icon of determination and grace.Gary Cooper, himself iconic, plays Gehrig true-to-life as a dedicated husband, friend, son and teammate. The Norman Rockwell touch is rounded out by the adorable Teresa Wright the 1940s actress who was undoubtedly June Cleaver's mentor. Babe Ruth appears as himself, poking fun at his own legend.Although the movie is myth-magical, the truth is that Cooper's  stainless portrayal of Gehrig is as true to life as it can be.

257709,A2NJO6YE954DBH,630159942X,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[42, 46]","There are all sorts of little imperfections in the 1943 film ""The Pride of the Yankees.""  The screenwriters rearranged Lou Gehrig's famous farewell speech at Yankee Stadium so that the best line, ""Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth,"" becomes his exit line (it was the second line in his speech with his actual last line being, ""So I close in saying that I may have had a tough break, but I have an awful lot to live for"").  Gary Cooper had enough problems batting right-handed let alone left-handed like Gehrig, so the actor wore a uniform with ""KROY WEN"" on the front, ran to third base when he managed to hit the ball, and then they reversed the print.  Gehrig is shown wearing his famous number 4 when the Yankees play the World Series, but that happened in 1926 and 1928 while the Bronx Bombers did not start wearing uniform numbers until 1929 (Gehrig batted cleanup and was 4, Babe Ruth batted in front of him and was therefore 3).  The film talks about how Gehrig won the Triple Crown on the day he was married but Gehrig won the Triple Crown in the 1934 season, the year after Lou and Eleanor were married in 1933.But none of that really matters because ""The Pride of the Yankees"" remains the standard by which all sports biopics, whether of baseball players or anyone else, are judged.  Even those who were not weaned and raised on baseball know that the title character is going to die of Lou Gehrig's disease and the film takes full advantage of that foreshadowing: when Gehrig gets into his first game and refuses to come out after being hit in the head by a thrown ball, manager Miller Huggins asks, ""What do we have to do to get you out of the game?  Kill you?""  Irving Berlin's song ""Always"" becomes a recurring musical theme throughout the film, another reminder of Gehrig's mortality.In many ways ""The Pride of the Yankees"" is more of a love story than a baseball theme.  It starts off as a rags-to-riches story, where Gehrig's mother (Elsa Janssen) insists her son will be an engineer and does want him wasting time playing baseball.  Eventually the fame and money opens her eyes, but then Lou meets Eleanor Twitchell (Teresa Wright) and has a new ""best girl.""  One of the most impressive aspects of this film is how it touches on the two darker sides of the Lou Gehrig story, the friction between his overbearing mother and his society wife along with the strained relationship that developed between Gehrig and Babe Ruth.  The film really only touches on these aspects and Ruth, playing himself, is usually a smiling figure when he shows up on screen, except for when Gehrig is eating his new hat and he is listening to Gehrig's farewell speech.Cooper was nominated for an Oscar for his performance and even though he is rather awkward and a bit old for the role, he captures the essential dignity and class of Gehrig.  It makes sense that one American icon is being played by another.  Having been nominated of a Best Actress in a Supporting Role Oscar for ""The Little Foxes"" in 1941 she received another nomination in that category in 1942 for ""Mrs. Miniver"" and also one for Best Actress that same year for ""The Pride of the Yankees.""  Wright won for ""Mrs. Miniver"" and lost out to Greer Garson for Best Actress (because of the war the Oscars were made of plaster for the first time, but were replaced by ""real"" Oscars when the war ended).  ""The Pride of the Yankees"" was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Picture, but only won for Daniel Mandell's Film Editing.Walter Brennan as sportswriter Sam Blake and Ludwig St&ouml;ssel as Pop Gehrig provide a lot of the comic relief in the film.  Brennan's role is rather low-keyed for him while St&ouml;ssel has several fine moments where he tries, usually without success, to stand up to his wife.  Appearing as themselves are Yankee players Bill Dickey, Bob Meusel, and Mark Koenig, and the familiar voice of Bill Stern makes it on screen as well.Gehrig's tragic death at the age of 38 makes all of his records even more astounding given that his career was cut short. Sportswriter Jim Murray once described the tall, strong Gehrig as a ""Gibraltar in cleats,"" and ""The Pride of the Yankees"" provides a sense of that.  For me the most poignant scene comes before Gehrig enters Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, when he encounter 17-year-old Billy (David Holt), the lame boy in the hospital (Gene Collins) for whom Gehrig hit two home runs in a World Series game in the film's most extended baseball sequence.

257716,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,630159942X,Martin Asiner,"[6, 7]","There are movies that involve the audience about the life of its star and there are others that use gimmicks to hide the fact that the audience never gets to look at the star from the inside.  In PRIDE OF THE YANKEES director Sam Wood gave us a movie that has already stood the test of time as one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.  The high quality of this film is mostly because of Gary Cooper's startlingly realistic portrayal of a baseball icon whose playing career overlapped the cinematic career of the film icon who played him. The audience sees the man in a way that the fans in the stands could not.  Cooper carries the movie in the same way that he carries SERGEANT YORK, by his straightforward radiating of emotion that is often at odds with the face that says one thing but the eyes that say another.The young Lou Gehrig starts off as a youth loving baseball so much that he has to hide his love from a mother who wants Lou to surpass Uncle Otto as a symbol of success.  Lou hears his mother praise Uncle Otto and assures her that he will follow in his footsteps, but his eyes tell another story.  In fact, throughout this movie, it is his eyes that speak more eloquently than anything else he can say or do. Lou winds up in Columbia on a scholarship, and during a frat party hazing designed to test his ability to endure a razzing, Lou retreats within himself until he can retreat no more.  For the first time in this film, and very nearly for his entire movie career as well, Cooper shows the anger that we all knew lay buried deep. Cooper made a career out of rechanneling emotion into productive ends, and as Lou Gehrig, he can redirect his inner chi into belting baseballs over walls well enough to earn a tryout with the New York Yankees.  By this time, the audience is hooked by their caring for a man who combines the best of the American ideals of hard work and talent with the self-effacing that marks most film icons of that time.Theresa Wright plays first his girlfriend, then later his wife. She is simply wonderful as the cultured girl who falls for the small town hero. They poke fun of each other but the audience knows that what they are really saying is the Real Thing.  Theresa Wright knows exactly when to back off and let Cooper be at center stage and when to interact with him to produce some truly stirring moments.  There are two scenes that stand out as unforgettable, one with Wright, the other without.  The first occurs when Lou has been playing poorly.  He has been striking out, dropping easy catches, and running awkwardly. His teammates are puzzled and mix anger with concern.  After a loss caused by his poor play, Lou sits on a bench, trying to make sense of a body that had never before betrayed him.  As he leans forward to untie his laces, he continues to fall, rolling over onto the floor.  His mates pretend not to notice.  Lou says nothing but his face tells the audience all that they need to know.  The fear that often bubbles just beneath the skin in many of Cooper's movies surfaces, and that fear clicks in the hearts of all.  Later, when he has seen a doctor and knows that his illness, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, is terminal, he decides to hide this knowledge from his wife who nevertheless has already guessed the truth, but tries to hide that from him. There is a heartbreaking scene in which she tries to raise his spirits by donning a barker's hat and mustache.  As she stares at him, she laughs.  As she hugs him, her eyes reveal her own torment.  Each actor is absolutely convincing in their respective attempts to hide what they know, while pretending all is well.PRIDE OF THE YANKEES tells a story well-known to anyone who reads the sports pages.  It features Cooper in center stage, with a supporting cast including Walter Brennan and Dan Duryea, both of whom interact credibly with him and Ms. Wright.  This is more than a baseball bio of a man who hits it big in his game.  It is more the story of a giant who continued to hit it big even after the fans have left the stadium.",5,Pride of the Yankees: Lou Gehrig as True Hero,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,4061,"['are', 'movies', 'involve', 'audience', 'life', 'star', 'are', 'others', 'use', 'gimmicks', 'hide', 'fact', 'audience', 'never', 'look', 'star', 'inside', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'director', 'Sam', 'Wood', 'gave', 'movie', 'already', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'high', 'quality', 'film', 'mostly', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'startlingly', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'baseball', 'icon', 'playing', 'career', 'overlapped', 'cinematic', 'career', 'film', 'icon', 'who', 'played', 'audience', 'man', 'way', 'fans', 'stands', 'could', 'not', 'Cooper', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'SERGEANT', 'YORK', 'straightforward', 'radiating', 'emotion', 'often', 'odds', 'face', 'one', 'thing', 'eyes', 'say', 'another.The', 'young', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'off', 'youth', 'loving', 'baseball', 'so', 'much', 'hide', 'love', 'mother', 'who', 'Lou', 'surpass', 'Uncle', 'Otto', 'symbol', 'success', 'Lou', 'mother', 'praise', 'Uncle', 'Otto', 'will', 'follow', 'footsteps', 'eyes', 'tell', 'story', 'fact', 'movie', 'eyes', 'speak', 'more', 'eloquently', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'do', 'Lou', 'up', 'Columbia', 'scholarship', 'frat', 'party', 'hazing', 'designed', 'test', 'ability', 'endure', 'razzing', 'Lou', 'can', 'retreat', 'more', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'nearly', 'entire', 'movie', 'career', 'well', 'Cooper', 'anger', 'knew', 'lay', 'buried', 'deep', 'Cooper', 'made', 'career', 'rechanneling', 'emotion', 'productive', 'ends', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'can', 'redirect', 'inner', 'chi', 'belting', 'baseballs', 'walls', 'well', 'enough', 'earn', 'tryout', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'time', 'audience', 'hooked', 'caring', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'American', 'ideals', 'hard', 'work', 'talent', 'self-effacing', 'most', 'film', 'icons', 'time.Theresa', 'Wright', 'plays', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'later', 'wife', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'cultured', 'girl', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'hero', 'poke', 'fun', 'other', 'audience', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'saying', 'Real', 'Thing', 'Theresa', 'Wright', 'exactly', 'when', 'back', 'off', 'let', 'Cooper', 'be', 'center', 'stage', 'when', 'interact', 'produce', 'truly', 'stirring', 'moments', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'unforgettable', 'one', 'Wright', 'other', 'first', 'when', 'Lou', 'been', 'playing', 'poorly', 'been', 'striking', 'out', 'dropping', 'easy', 'catches', 'running', 'awkwardly', 'teammates', 'are', 'puzzled', 'mix', 'anger', 'concern', 'loss', 'caused', 'poor', 'play', 'Lou', 'bench', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'body', 'had', 'never', 'before', 'betrayed', 'forward', 'untie', 'laces', 'fall', 'rolling', 'floor', 'mates', 'pretend', 'not', 'notice', 'Lou', 'nothing', 'face', 'audience', 'need', 'know', 'fear', 'often', 'just', 'beneath', 'skin', 'many', 'Cooper', 'movies', 'surfaces', 'fear', 'clicks', 'hearts', 'Later', 'when', 'seen', 'doctor', 'illness', 'Amyotrophic', 'Lateral', 'Sclerosis', 'terminal', 'hide', 'knowledge', 'wife', 'who', 'nevertheless', 'already', 'guessed', 'truth', 'tries', 'hide', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'raise', 'spirits', 'donning', 'barker', 'hat', 'mustache', 'hugs', 'eyes', 'reveal', 'own', 'torment', 'actor', 'absolutely', 'convincing', 'respective', 'attempts', 'hide', 'what', 'know', 'pretending', 'well.PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'story', 'well-known', 'anyone', 'who', 'sports', 'pages', 'Cooper', 'center', 'stage', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'whom', 'interact', 'credibly', 'Ms.', 'Wright', 'more', 'baseball', 'bio', 'man', 'who', 'big', 'game', 'more', 'story', 'giant', 'who', 'continued', 'hit', 'big', 'even', 'fans', 'have', 'left', 'stadium']",N/A

Nominated for best picture and actor in 1943, the film is an inspirational and emotionally charged story about one man in both life and sport that was and is loved even to this day.  Lou Gehrig (G. Cooper) is portrayed as an honest, simple and selfless man who simply wants to play the game of baseball.  Although he means well, Gehrig is depicted as being both clumsy and reckless in his pursuit of the game.  The film begins with Gehrig as a young, poor immigrant boy who yearns to play ball but is pressured by his mother to become an engineer in college.  Being a mama's boy, Gehrig does what his mother wants and heads for college to become successful and rich.  When his mother grows ill, Gehrig finds himself in desperate need for money.  While playing ball on the side in college, a scout for the New York Yankees (W. Brennan) spots him and wants him to sign a contract.  Needing the money Gehrig accepts and the rest is Major League Baseball history.The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't entirely focus on Gehrig's success on the diamond, but his success as a man.  We learn of Gehrig's internal struggles with his mother, his subtle rivalry with teamate Babe Ruth (who portrays himself in this film), and his loving relationship with his wife (T. Wright) which gives a full biography of his greatness.As the film moves on from Gehrig's early years as a Yankee to a superstar and ""The Iron Horse"" of Baseball, the climax is revealed as an unfortunate turn for the worse.  The tragedy over Lou Gehrig's life is what detours this film from a giddy feel good bio of a great athlete and man to a movie about physical decline and death, while facing all these inevitable fates with dignity and honor.  The movie is humbling, to say the least, and powerful with hope.  It's difficult not to get choked up as the final scene fades away.Like all good sports films, the success of it isn't in the sport itself or the record setting highlights of a memorable career.  The success is in the human development of the real life character(s) and their real life struggles.  As imagined, this isn't a story about home runs or Lou Gehrig winning the World Series.  It's about Lou Gehrig---the man.One cannot say enough for the realism Gary Cooper poured into the character of Lou Gehrig.  After seeing real footage of Gehrig the likeness between both the athlete and actor are eerie in its similarity.  Gary Cooper won the oscar the year before for his role as Sgt. Alvin York and ten years later as Will Kane in ""High Noon,"" but in the humble opinion of this reviewer this was his finest performance of his entire career.There is no warnings to speak of with this movie.  In 1943 there were no such things as rating systems because movies didn't have to be rated.  The only thing to keep in mind is that the movie does end in a form of tragedy, which may come across as depressing to certain audiences.In summary, ""Pride of the Yankees"" is one of the best films of the 1940s and is easily among the greatest sports films ever done.  It is important to note that it is also a rareity for Hollywood to focus a story on a clean and uncontroversial athlete, such as Gehrig, whereas in recent sports biographies over Muhammed Ali and Babe Ruth have nothing but controversy painted all over them.

257734,A11LGJLERJOOGU,630159942X,rapid rabbit,"[0, 0]","I don't plan out my tragic film of the evening.  In fact, I don't even like tragedy: especially about handsome highly-skilled baseball players who we know are going to die of some horrible disease before the end of the film.  Real Greek tragedy, in which the outcome is already known to the reader, depends on the hero's obvious flaws to make it work.  Lou Gehrig, much less Gary Cooper, had no flaws.  So how does this tragedy work?To start, the three main professional-actor supports, Walter Brennan, Dan Duryea, and Teresa Wright all make magnificent contributions.  And like most great actors, Gary Cooper makes even greater stars of his supporting cast:  it must have been a treat to work with Mr. Cooper.Oh, I almost forgot:  Ludwig St&ouml;ssel, as Lou Gehrig's father, betrays his own future as  &#34;That Little Old Winemaker, Me!&#34; in the Italian Swiss Colony ads which doubtless made him wealthy.Teresa Wright, about whom I knew nothing before this film, really attracted my attention.  If you wanted to chose a wife for your son, Teresa Wright would be the one.  Wow!The smattering of professional ball-players making cameos is also wonderful:  Babe Ruth; Mark Koenig, et. al.  And the ballpark shots are really convincing - especially the real footage of actual Lou Gehrig home runs.So what about the film:  &#34;good guy hits home runs, gets sick, and then dies&#34;?Actually - Gary Cooper doesn't even die.  He makes his famous speech about &#34;being the luckiest guy&#34; - which he certain was not.  And then the film is over.  We don't get to watch the trials and tribulations such as were offered by the slow demise of NY Senator Jacob Javits who died of the same eponymous disease. [I'm not sure if I use &#34;eponymous&#34; correctly there.  Maybe it is the eponymous Lou Gehrig .  .  .  ].It's not a very good film.  Lou's mother's disappointment that Cary Cooper (I mean Lou Gehrig) doesn't to to Harvard for his engineering degree does not make for high drama.And Teresa Wright, the first good wife, snivelling at home while her husband is at the ballpark losing his snap at bat, is also weak drama.  Gary Cooper's face twitching as it dawns on him that he is really ill is very good acting in a really bad film.The problem with this film is that there's no ironic twist.  If Gary Cooper (I mean Lou Gehrig) had been gay and unbeknownst to himself had contracted HIV, had infected his wife, several of his teammates, and and then been serendipitously  knocked off by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - that would be a film.Gary Cooper wander off and die leaving us and all the others to their HIV fates.  That would be a good film.The Pride of the Yankees is a bad film!  But I'd watch it again - and I will.  A film can not be depended on to deliver all the goods - all in one film.  As I said in the very beginning:  this is a film to gorge on Gary Cooper.  And then you have Brennan, Duryea, and Wright as salad, cheese, and dessert:  with St&ouml;ssel as the wine choice.You can't do better than that.If you want to see a really bad contra-punctal effort, check out Tommy Lee Jones in &#34;Cobb&#34;.

Which is why I am a little embarassed to give Pride of the Yankees just three stars. But the truth is that I really had to fight hard to surpress a smile at the level of schmaltz in this film that I didn't recognize when I saw this as a boy.Gary Cooper plays Lou Gehrig with a childlike naivete which I know was charming in its day but today it feels like you would have to lock someone up who was his age and still that childlike. And I really did want to play along with the most classic scene in the film but found it funnier than any campy parody I have seen over the years. The little boy in the hospital who is sitting by the radio because the Babe and Lou promised him they would each hit home runs form him. &quot;Little Billy&quot; sits in pajamas in the hospital by the radio. He listens earnestly with a expectant vapid open mouth expression waiting. Its as if his ability to ever walk again hung on the success of that hit. Bottom of the sixth Gehrig disappoints by striking out for his second time in a row still one short of the two promised home runs, you can tell the kid is thinking &quot;Damn&quot; but instead says &quot;Golly&quot;! I am glad I wasn't drinking anything at the time because it would shot through my nose trying to hold back the laugh. Pride of the Yankess does hearken back to simpler times but is perhaps so gentle and guileless it crosses the line into accidental comedy.However I did very much enjoy the relationship between the two competing sportswriters who mock each others favorite players much like Statler and Waldorf the two old geezers in The Muppet Show. Walter Brennan plays writer Sam Blake who roots for Lou and does a wonderful job. He is so slender of build here he is almost unrecognizable in this role.I am sure most people will have a fine time enjoying this film and Lou Gehrigs touching farewell speech.",3,Nostalgic Eye for the Baseball Guy,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1990,"['hate', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'enjoy', 'old', 'fashioned', 'good', 'feeling', 'movie', 'call', 'sacharine', 'happy', 'ending', 'Which', 'why', 'am', 'little', 'embarassed', 'give', 'Pride', 'Yankees', 'just', 'three', 'stars', 'truth', 'really', 'had', 'fight', 'hard', 'surpress', 'smile', 'level', 'schmaltz', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'when', 'saw', 'boy.Gary', 'Cooper', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'childlike', 'naivete', 'know', 'was', 'charming', 'day', 'today', 'would', 'have', 'lock', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'age', 'still', 'childlike', 'really', 'did', 'want', 'play', 'along', 'most', 'classic', 'scene', 'film', 'found', 'funnier', 'campy', 'parody', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'little', 'boy', 'hospital', 'who', 'sitting', 'radio', 'Babe', 'Lou', 'promised', 'would', 'hit', 'home', 'runs', 'form', 'quot', 'Little', 'Billy', 'quot', 'sits', 'pajamas', 'hospital', 'radio', 'earnestly', 'expectant', 'vapid', 'open', 'mouth', 'expression', 'waiting', 'ability', 'ever', 'walk', 'again', 'hung', 'success', 'hit', 'Bottom', 'sixth', 'Gehrig', 'disappoints', 'striking', 'out', 'second', 'time', 'row', 'still', 'one', 'short', 'two', 'promised', 'home', 'runs', 'can', 'tell', 'kid', 'thinking', 'quot', 'Damn', 'quot', 'instead', 'quot', 'Golly', 'quot', 'am', 'glad', 'was', ""n't"", 'drinking', 'anything', 'time', 'would', 'shot', 'nose', 'trying', 'hold', 'back', 'laugh', 'Pride', 'Yankess', 'hearken', 'back', 'simpler', 'times', 'perhaps', 'so', 'gentle', 'guileless', 'line', 'accidental', 'comedy.However', 'did', 'very', 'much', 'relationship', 'two', 'competing', 'sportswriters', 'who', 'mock', 'others', 'favorite', 'players', 'much', 'Statler', 'Waldorf', 'two', 'old', 'geezers', 'Muppet', 'Show', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'writer', 'Sam', 'Blake', 'who', 'roots', 'Lou', 'wonderful', 'job', 'so', 'slender', 'build', 'here', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'role.I', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'have', 'fine', 'time', 'enjoying', 'film', 'Lou', 'Gehrigs', 'touching', 'farewell', 'speech']",N/A

And for so many years, I had Gehrig and Gary Cooper completely confused in my mind--they seemed inseparable. But there's good reason for it: the role of the Iron Horse seemed to be made for Cooper. Gehrig was a low-key, almost self-effacing athlete and person, which was just the type of character that Cooper built his career on. Their sizes were just about the same. Cooper nailed down Lou Gehrig's voice, especially for the famous &quot;luckiest man&quot; farewell speech. Hell, Gary Cooper LOOKS like Lou Gehrig! Maybe my confusion is justified, at least on this subject.PRIDE OF THE YANKEES is the grand-daddy of all baseball movies. Cooper's performance, as I can't help but keep mentioning, is stellar. Teresa Wright as his wife helps keep the hankies moist but she is also very spunky and strong. Walter Brennan (who also played opposite Cooper in MEET JOHN DOE where John Doe is a semi-pro pitcher) is in a supporting role here but provides desperately needed comic relief.And perhaps I'm wrong to categorize PRIDE OF THE YANKESS as merely a baseball film. It is about human potential, human frailty, and above all human strength during times of crisis. Lou Gehrig's tragedy occurred during a time of extreme crisis in America, and, I believe, his strong steady public appearances  helped the nation through it. PRIDE OF THE YANKEES could easily have been named &quot;Strength of America&quot; in my mind.

It is at once a sports movie and a romance, with both dramatic and comedic elements.  The cast is absolutely wonderful, with stellar performances by Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright and Walter Brennan leading a well rounded bevy of supporting actors including Dan Duryea and Ludwig Stossel & Elsa Janssen (as Mom & Pop Gehrig).  Director Sam Wood (A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races, Our Town, Goodbye Mr. Chips, The Stratton Story, and so many others memorable films) coaxed believable performances out of a number of Yankee greats including Bill Dickey, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig, and of course, Babe Ruth.  PRIDE was nominated for a total of 11 Academy Awards in its year of release, including best picture, best actor and actress, and other various categories.  It won for Film Editing (well-deserved - the pace and timing of the film are perfect).The DVD itself is well done: the film is beautifully mastered with pristine picture and sound quality.The real story of course, is Lou Gehrig the man, not merely the baseball player.  Gary Cooper becomes Gehrig as he progresses from the nave rookie and awkward romantic to seasoned ballplayer and devoted husband.  Teresa Wright, who passed away in 2005, gave a wonderful performance ranging from playful to tearful.  Walter Brennan, as Gehrig's reporter/best friend, displays the remarkable range that brought him three supporting actor Oscars.Gary Cooper's delivery of Gehrig's farewell at Yankee Stadium (after his retirement due to the disease that bears his name), while not historically accurate, still brings tears to one's eyes after repeated screenings.  The ending is one of the most dramatic and fulfilling of any movie.PRIDE OF THE YANKEES ultimately transcends the sports movie genre.

Gary Cooper plays Lou Gehrig in one ofhis most unforgettable roles in this, one of the most memorable filmsmade during the Golden Age of Hollywood.I think it's fair to say that the people involved in making this movie weregreatly concerned in making something that they sincerely hoped would standthe test of time and be watched and enjoyed by millions of people forpossibly hundreds of years. Because I guess that the story of the life of LouGehrig was just the kind of inspiration that many folks, sports fans or not,felt was needed, especially  in 1941 and 1942.And because, after all was said and done, Lou Gehrig was in many ways one ofthe most beloved sports figures of his time.  Yes, his early death is part ofhis mystique but that tragic early parting is not the main reason he isremembered so fondly.  I think it is how he lived his life, how he handledfame, relative wealth and eventually how he dealt with his certain doom thatshows us, even to this day, the way to handle life's triumphs and tragedieswith a touch of grace, class and doing your best not to unduly burdon thoseyou love.And I believe that THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES gets those ideas across ina wonderful fashion.In fact, THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES is generally looked upon as the classicsports biography, which it is.  It also is a tremendously entertaining movieloaded with baseball lore and a chance to see the real Babe Ruth ashe appeared in the later days of his career (I remember reading that the Bambinolost 60 Lbs to appear in this film).THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES is a classic film all the way around, pretty mucha must see by just about every sports fans as well as those of us whoreally enjoy and appreciate good films and those who made them.Five Stars for THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, without hesitation.",5,The Film Biography Of The Iron Horse,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,1896,"['review', 'classic', 'biographical', 'film', 'THE', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEESmade', 'MGM', 'released', '1942', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'one', 'ofhis', 'most', 'unforgettable', 'roles', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'filmsmade', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Hollywood.I', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'movie', 'weregreatly', 'concerned', 'making', 'something', 'sincerely', 'hoped', 'would', 'standthe', 'test', 'time', 'be', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'millions', 'people', 'forpossibly', 'hundreds', 'years', 'guess', 'story', 'life', 'LouGehrig', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'inspiration', 'many', 'folks', 'sports', 'fans', 'not', 'felt', 'was', 'needed', 'especially', '1941', '1942.And', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'one', 'ofthe', 'most', 'beloved', 'sports', 'figures', 'time', 'Yes', 'early', 'death', 'part', 'ofhis', 'mystique', 'tragic', 'early', 'parting', 'not', 'main', 'reason', 'isremembered', 'so', 'fondly', 'think', 'how', 'lived', 'life', 'how', 'relative', 'wealth', 'eventually', 'how', 'certain', 'doom', 'even', 'day', 'way', 'handle', 'life', 'triumphs', 'tragedieswith', 'touch', 'grace', 'class', 'doing', 'best', 'not', 'unduly', 'burdon', 'thoseyou', 'love.And', 'believe', 'THE', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'ideas', 'ina', 'wonderful', 'fashion.In', 'fact', 'THE', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'generally', 'looked', 'classicsports', 'biography', 'also', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'movieloaded', 'baseball', 'lore', 'chance', 'see', 'real', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'ashe', 'appeared', 'later', 'days', 'career', 'remember', 'reading', 'Bambinolost', '60', 'Lbs', 'appear', 'film', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'classic', 'film', 'way', 'pretty', 'mucha', 'must', 'see', 'just', 'sports', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'whoreally', 'enjoy', 'appreciate', 'good', 'films', 'who', 'made', 'them.Five', 'Stars', 'THE', 'PRIDE', 'THE', 'YANKEES', 'hesitation']",N/A
