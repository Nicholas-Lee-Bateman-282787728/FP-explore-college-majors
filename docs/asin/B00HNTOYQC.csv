A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","I have literally been waiting a few years for &#34;Knights of Badassdom.&#34; Initially shot in 2010, it was stuck in post-production hell for a long, long time.So it was something of a relief when it finally came out, and it turned out to be pretty much what I expected -- a wacky, gory movie about larpers who accidentally summon a real-life demon. That's... basically the entire plot. Expect buckets of blood, some goofy demon suits, and a bunch of guys in Ye Olde Medieval Costumes causing mayhem -- it's not great art, but it is fun.Joe (Ryan Kwanten) is down in the dumps when his girlfriend dumps him for not being &#34;successful&#34; enough. So his buddies Hung (Peter Dinklage) and Eric (Steve Zahn) decide to drag him to the Battle of Evermore that weekend, even though he knows more about doom metal than larping. As they prepare for the epic larp battle the next day, the gang decides to use an old book for a pretend wizard ritual.Here's the problem: the book once belonged to the occultist John Dee, and it contains actual spells... which means the group has summoned a succubus demon from hell. As the demon tears a bloody swathe through the larp community, the doughty little group must find a way to banish it back to the hellish abyss... which is harder than it sounds, especially when you can't actually read the spells.&#34;Knights of Badassdom&#34; is a movie for the teenage dork in all of us... which is to say it has bongs, metal music and lots of guys in armor whacking each other with foam swords. While it's aware of how silly larping can be, there's an affectionate awareness that we should do whatever hobbies make us happy. Unless you're a redneck who likes to shoot larpers with paintball guns -- then you're just an a-hole.Director Joe Lynch also produces a greyhound of a movie, loping quickly from Joe's heartbreak to his roomies dragging him off to Evermore. The plot slows down once they actually get there, but the horrible deaths (usually by torn-out heart) keep things entertaining. And of course, larp-related comedy, from the pseudo-medievalese (Subtitle: &#34;Ed's frickin' wife is making him clean the garage this weekend&#34;) to the guys in fairy costumes.But once the Knights find out that they actually summoned a demon, the movie revs itself back up for the bloody, fiery, frenetic finale, which climaxes on one of the most awesome battles I have ever seen in a comedy. There's an animatronic dragon, lots of weapons, a completely delusional guy, and Peter Dinklage sweeping around a sword in slow-motion to the sound of doom metal. It does not get better than that.It's also one of those movies where you can really tell that the actors were having fun -- Dinklage effortlessly steals every scene he's in, and left me wishing that he had many, many more. Zahn and Jimmi Simpson leap wholeheartedly into their roles as devoted nerds, and Kwanten is a good everyman hero who is involved in all this whether he likes it or not. Summer Glau seems a bit superfluous, though -- I was never entirely sure why she was there, except that the story needed a girl/love interest.This is both a love letter to and a gentle parody of larping -- lots of guts and gore, pseudo-medievalese and guys dressed as pixies.",4,"""Dude, you bent my mace!""

1691261,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00HNTOYQC,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[11, 17]","Although I like to privately imagine myself still of that age group acceptably dubbed &#8216;fanboys,&#8217; I&#8217;m probably a bit older than most to be a true card-carrying variety.  I&#8217;ve always loved film &#8211; I have tremendous respect for almost any picture that gets churned out by the studios or the indie types, and I&#8217;ve always been drawn to sci-fi, horror, and generally quirky features which fanboys tend to worship.  I&#8217;ve noticed as of late, though, that the older I grow the less inclined I am to give some of the usual fare as much freedom to play fast and loose with what is honestly entertaining.  Ten years ago, I may&#8217;ve laughed myself silly over something like KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM.  Today?  Well, today I&#8217;ll smile about some of the successful elements, but I find myself cringing over stuff that&#8217;s just callously overblown &#8230; which is more than this film should&#8217;ve done.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Down on his luck in a dead-end job and recently dumped by his girlfriend, Joe (played with his textbook golly-gee assurance by Ryan Kwanten) finds himself stoned and dragged by his two besties &#8211; Eric (Steve Zahn) and Hung (Peter Dinklage) &#8211; to a medieval LARP (Live Action Role Players) weekend festivity meant to cleanse the kingdoms of evil.  The problem is that Eric accidentally has released an authentic demon into the wilds with a spell from an all-new book he&#8217;s found, and this&#8217;ll require the team to join forces with Gwen (Summer Glau), her cousin Gunther (Brett Gipson), and a few others in order to stay alive and vanquish the beast.A few decades back, I can remember penning a review for BILL AND TED&#8217;S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.  I fondly recall what I wrote, much of it being that there&#8217;s a wealth of charm in any scripted idea that takes a group of lovable nitwits and plunks them into a situation requiring they step up, do the right thing, and save the world in the process.  It&#8217;s that charm that fuels quite a bit of KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM&#8217;s first half (what I&#8217;d term the better half); but once the bloodletting starts and the bodies pile up that welcome vibe kinda/sorta goes bye-bye, causing the picture to splinter into something vastly different all too quickly.Thematically &#8211; much like I wrote with BILL AND TED &#8211; these characters are classic knuckleheads.  Real life offers them very little reward, so they&#8217;ve understandably embraced what role-playing offers them: a chance at greatness.  As people, they&#8217;re committed to achieving more and more skills, to acquiring more and more power they can put to use within the game; and, on that level, each of them is not only understandable but also relatable.  The audience is drawn to them in part because they&#8217;re clueless but it&#8217;s an inviting cluelessness &#8211; an existence they revere.  It&#8217;s precisely Eric and Hung&#8217;s affinity that pushes them to bring Joe into their world: they know that this release from the pain of day-to-day life can bring rewards, and that&#8217;s something he definitely needs.However, once the succubus is loose and roaming the countryside &#8211; erm, city park &#8211; the film starts to gravitate toward bloodshed.  The first few unfortunate victims are dispatched with joy &#8211; an almost tongue-in-cheek, winking-at-the-camera hokeyness; once an important death is delivered with bloody surprise, that&#8217;s when BADASSDOM lost its charm for me.  Granted, director Joe Lynch went to great pains to try and recover it, but it just never felt right after that moment.I know those fellow fanboys of mine out there will be disappointed with this review, but I have to call &#8216;em like I see &#8216;em.  Maybe that makes me a curmudgeon.  Maybe that makes me a fuddy-duddy.  Still, I expected an awful lot more due to this film&#8217;s long-lasting internet buzz as well as the wealth of acting talent up on the screen.  A disappointment, but not a disaster.KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM (2013) is produced by IndieVest Pictures and North by Northwest Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by E One Entertainment (aka Entertainment One).  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly manufactured piece of mirth, and it offers up some quality sights and sounds &#8211; there&#8217;s even a handful of practical effects (splatter and gore variety) that are quite good, while some of the brief CGI-style stuff leaves a bit to be desired.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re interested in, then you have a solid handful to anticipate: besides the usual behind-the-scenes stuff, there are some good interviews with the cast, a celebration of Summer Glau&#8217;s &#8220;hotness,&#8221; and even a San Diego Comic Con panel.  Not too shabby.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  I won&#8217;t hide my disappointment with KNIGHTS OF BADASSDOM.  This flick has had an incredible shelf-life so far as entertainment websites are concerned.  Having read so much unadulterated praise about this thing and its central performances, I honestly expected more laughs and even bigger moments from it than what was delivered.  It musters some occasional charm &#8211; much of it in the first half &#8211; but so very much of its misplaced violence is probably why this cult flick struggled for so long to find a legitimate distributor.  In this era of PC-correctness, there&#8217;s an awful lot in here some folks might find objectionable.  My advice &#8211; always remember it&#8217;s a cult flick, and you should do fine with it.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at E One Entertainment (aka Entertainment One) provided me with an advance DVD copy by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,Uneven Cult-ish Flick Only Flirts With Greatness,1395878400,"03 27,

Every nerd's heart throb Summer Glau along with the super amazing Peter Dinklage took the cast over the top for me along with the mains Steve Zahn and Ryan Kwanten.  I also enjoyed Danny Pudi and some of the other actors who played smaller parts.  The movie doesn't stick in any particular genre, but is more like a &#34;Dale and Tucker vs Evil&#34; mish mash.

Also digging the soundtrack.Update: Watched a second time -So I was thinking about this and wondering if my review was skewed because of a couple things.  First, I was a little drunk.  Not falling down drunk, but I would not be able to drive a car.  Second, I watched this with a group of friends.  These two combined made me wonder if the booze and my friends laughing made me laugh more.  Well, in an effort to be thorough, I watched it again last night.  Just me, winding down after work, stone sober.  And you know what, still funny!I fully admit that there are numerous random plots points that were not explained that might have made the movie flow better.  But that could have also led to the movie being too long and slowing down too much.  But here is what made the movie awesome, to me:1.  Danni Pudi - Since I really like the show Community, this was a instant win.2.  Summer Glau - what can I say, she has such a sexy ""nerd girl"" look and when she smirks = awesome.3.  Peter Dinklage - I liked the Station Agent, but really I think GOT has made him that much more awesome.  He puts the Imp in Pimp and is still awesome and funny in this movie!  And without being too ""spoilery"", his final battle scene was just epic!4.  The music - Really the soundtrack overall is ok, but what sold the movie was the ""final battle scene"" and how the song plays into it.  Just trust me, it makes no sense at all, but it is awesome nonetheless!5.  The other actors all did well, but the 3 I called out really made the movie.

And, I will admit, I played D&D; back into day.  I should have taken a clue from delay after delay.  Ultimately, I think it was delayed because the producers realized that no one should have to suffer this much needlessly.And with Peter Dinklage, Summer Glau, and that Zahn guy, how could it go wrong?  F me, I really need to stop asking questions like that.I guess if we were to look at movies like Cabin in the Woods, or Tucker and Dale vs. Evil, we would see horror comedy done well.  As I recall, they might show the dude flying into the woodchipper, but its from a side view, where you don't see his spleen getting ripped out.  Not this movie.  That spleen gets ripped out and munched on in graphic detail.  Tough to find a chuckle, unless you're Hannibal Lecter.  Graphic evisceration just lacks humor.And the special effects.  I think the effort to bring back Claymation in this movie was heartfelt, but poorly done.  I thought the Claymation in the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans was much better (before anyone throws a hissy fit, I do know that it wasnt Claymation, Claymation would have been better than this.  The playdoh monsters I made fight my star wars action figures 30 years ago would have been better).The end of the movie.  They just cobbled that together in the last ten minutes.  The 'hero' of the movie sings some atonal gloom metal at the apocalyptic demon beast, thereby killing it.  God knows , it nearly did me in too.I am reminded of the following passage from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, 'During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem &#34;Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning&#34; four of his audience members died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council, survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.

1691290,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00HNTOYQC,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 4]","This is a dumb movie.That is NOT a strike against it. Heck, the movie WANTS to be dumb. Check out that title. That's a pretty dumb title.Maybe instead of ""dumb,"" I should've written ""silly."" Meh. I'm six sentences into this review already. Too late to turn back now.The point being: this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. This is fine in a film, as long as it's a consistent goal, and one reached with some level of skill, which is where this film falters.The story is about Joe, a mechanic with low aspirations. Joe's girlfriend, Beth, breaks up with him at the start of the film for reasons that would sound very mature to your average thirty-something, but which are made to seem domineering and overbearing in the film. She is presented as a villain because she wants him to be more interested in doing something with his life rather than sitting around listening to and playing heavy (doom? gloom? crash?) metal and smoking weed. Joe is able to do these things indefinitely because he lives with a friend named Eric who is an ""accidental millionaire."" How this is the case is never elaborated on, although it does explain why Eric and his friend, Hung (Peter Dinklage! I kept telling my girlfriend, ""Man. That guy looks a LOT like Peter Dinklage. But surely he wouldn't be in a movie like this.""), are able to dress to the nines for their LARP sessions (Live Action Role Play). To help Joe get over his heartbreak, they bring him to a massive LARP festival where they accidentally summon a demon with a spell book that Eric bought from eBay.That's actually pretty funny.Where the movie fumbles is when it tries to be both horror and comedy. This is such a tricky thing to pull off that it's rarely done perfectly. There is some shocking and pretty gruesome violence in the film, and likeable characters die, and they die in pretty unforgiving scenes about which there is nothing funny. It makes the film feel uneven. It goes from slapstick to stab-stick without really letting the two mesh. There are a few moments that meld the funny with the gory, but overall the violence and humor aren't blended properly to give the movie the feel it wants to have.Also, the climax, during which our heroes must battle the End Level Boss, has a few flubs to it as well. The movie-makers must not have had much confidence in the special effects required to create their Big Bad, because it is constantly filmed in swerving, dipping, headache-inducing shake-cam. When it IS focused on properly, yes, it is less horrifying than a strangely inarticulate plastic creation. Even that could be forgiven as the necessary evils of a low-budget film if it weren't for the method with which the bad guy is finally attacked. I don't want to give anything away, but the final showdown was pretty embarrassing as far as film-making/story-telling goes. It is meant to be a joke, but it's not a very good joke, and it goes on too long, stretching out what little humor there is into something paper thin.Every actor does a bang-up job, and the general concept is pretty funny, but the execution is spotty, and the penultimate scene is so ridiculous that the movie goes from being ""funny dumb"" to just plain dumb.",3,Review #666,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,3196,"['dumb', 'movie.That', 'NOT', 'strike', 'Heck', 'movie', 'WANTS', 'be', 'dumb', 'Check', 'out', 'title', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'title.Maybe', 'instead', 'dumb', 'should', ""'ve"", 'written', 'silly', 'Meh', ""'m"", 'six', 'sentences', 'review', 'already', 'Too', 'late', 'turn', 'back', 'now.The', 'point', 'being', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'fine', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'consistent', 'goal', 'one', 'reached', 'level', 'skill', 'where', 'film', 'falters.The', 'story', 'Joe', 'mechanic', 'low', 'aspirations', 'Joe', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'up', 'start', 'film', 'reasons', 'would', 'sound', 'very', 'mature', 'average', 'thirty-something', 'are', 'made', 'seem', 'domineering', 'overbearing', 'film', 'presented', 'villain', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'doing', 'something', 'life', 'rather', 'sitting', 'listening', 'playing', 'heavy', 'doom', 'gloom', 'crash', 'metal', 'smoking', 'weed', 'Joe', 'able', 'do', 'things', 'indefinitely', 'friend', 'named', 'Eric', 'who', 'accidental', 'millionaire', 'How', 'case', 'never', 'elaborated', 'explain', 'why', 'Eric', 'friend', 'Hung', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'kept', 'telling', 'girlfriend', 'Man', 'guy', 'LOT', 'Peter', 'Dinklage', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'are', 'able', 'dress', 'nines', 'LARP', 'sessions', 'Live', 'Action', 'Role', 'Play', 'help', 'Joe', 'get', 'heartbreak', 'bring', 'massive', 'LARP', 'festival', 'where', 'accidentally', 'summon', 'demon', 'spell', 'book', 'Eric', 'bought', 'eBay.That', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny.Where', 'movie', 'fumbles', 'when', 'be', 'horror', 'comedy', 'such', 'tricky', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'rarely', 'done', 'perfectly', 'shocking', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'film', 'likeable', 'characters', 'die', 'die', 'pretty', 'unforgiving', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'funny', 'film', 'feel', 'uneven', 'slapstick', 'stab-stick', 'really', 'letting', 'two', 'mesh', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'meld', 'funny', 'gory', 'violence', 'humor', 'are', ""n't"", 'blended', 'properly', 'give', 'movie', 'feel', 'have.Also', 'climax', 'heroes', 'must', 'battle', 'End', 'Level', 'Boss', 'few', 'flubs', 'as', 'well', 'movie-makers', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'confidence', 'special', 'effects', 'required', 'create', 'Big', 'Bad', 'constantly', 'filmed', 'swerving', 'dipping', 'headache-inducing', 'shake-cam', 'When', 'focused', 'properly', 'yes', 'less', 'horrifying', 'strangely', 'inarticulate', 'plastic', 'creation', 'Even', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'necessary', 'evils', 'low-budget', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'method', 'bad', 'guy', 'finally', 'attacked', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'final', 'showdown', 'was', 'pretty', 'embarrassing', 'as', 'far', 'film-making/story-telling', 'meant', 'be', 'joke', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'joke', 'too', 'long', 'stretching', 'out', 'what', 'little', 'humor', 'something', 'paper', 'thin.Every', 'actor', 'bang-up', 'job', 'general', 'concept', 'pretty', 'funny', 'execution', 'spotty', 'penultimate', 'scene', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'being', 'funny', 'dumb', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb']",Knights of Badassdom

1691297,AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B00HNTOYQC,MonsterZeroNJ,"[1, 1]","Fun comedy/horror tells the tale of slacker mechanic Joe (Ryan Kwanten), whose beautiful girlfriend Beth (Margarita Levieva) dumps him after tiring of his unambitious ways. To cheer him up, his friends Eric (Steve Zahn) and Hung (Peter Dinklage) take him, reluctantly, to a live action fantasy role play game for the weekend that they attend regularly. There Eric performs a 'spell' to activate Joe's status as a player but, uses an old spell book he bought on E-Bay instead of the regulation spells that are part of the game. Unknown to any of them, the book is real and it's spells can summon actual demons and thus Eric has unwittingly summons a succubus in the guise of Beth (also Margarita Levieva) who begins to literally eat any fantasy role player who crosses her sexy/hungry path. Once this grave error is discovered, it's up to the three friends and the sexy Gwen (Summer Glau) to find and destroy this very real monster and halt the bloody body count that is spiraling out of control. As directed by Joe Lynch (the fun and gruesome Wrong Turn 2) Knights Of Badassdom is a fun and, at times, delightfully blood-soaked flick that has a lot of fun with not only the horror conventions but, the fantasy role play world as well. The clever script by Kevin Dreyfuss and Matt Wall never makes fun of the subjects it covers but, playfully pokes them in the ribs while also being it's own horror with generous doses of laughs. And there is a lot of fun to be had here and it's only in it's finale where it sadly loses it'd grip a bit. After all we've been through with the lovable cast of eccentric characters, we kind of expected something with a bit more impact or at least a lot funnier. It's amusing but, there are far better bits throughout and the ending obviously should have been the best bit of all and it's not. The cast all have a good time playing their oddball characters such as Zahn's would-be sorcerer and Dinklage's stoner who backup Kwanten's more down to earth Joe. The ladies are enchanting as well with Glau being a strong and beautiful 'pretend' warrior woman and Levieva giving vampy life to both bitchy girlfriend and seductive monster. Nice to see Adventureland's &#34;Lisa P&#34; in a role she can sink her teeth into...literally! The whole cast seems to have a really good chemistry and work very well together and it helps make the relationships in the film more believable and thus more entertaining. The script would not have worked so well if the cast didn't make the characters so much fun to watch and they do. The FX are a little mixed. The visuals are satisfactory digital FX but, not great. The gore FX, however, are top notch and not only are well executed but, very plentiful. Overall I had a good time with Knights of Badassdom, I laughed quite a lot, but, just wish they had come up with a climatic confrontation that was worthy of all the fun that preceded it. Again, it's not a bad ending, it just seemed weak after some of the consistent cleverness that came before it. Overall, I would still very much recommend this fun little flick. I had a really good time and the ending certainly doesn't ruin a delightfully breezy and gory comedy/horror. Just be a little forgiving for the few times it stumbles as, more often then not, Badassdom takes it's story and gleefully runs with it. Also stars Community's Dani Pudi as one of the LARP players named Lando who dresses oddly similar to a certain Star Wars character.

However, the boys get more than they bargained for when some actual, honest-to-God demonic creatures decide to crash the festivities, leaving mayhem and destruction in in their wake and forcing the LARPers to put into practice what they`ve been only playacting at all this time.The presence of Ryan Kwanten (""True Blood""), Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones""), and Steve Zahn (""Treme"") in the cast suggests that the actors got bored one summer just hanging around while their respective series were on hiatus, and this is what they came up with to fill the void. Yet, it really isn't their fault that the movie looks as if it were filmed in someone's - admittedly expansive - backyard.

Eric uses an old book of spells he bought on eBay which, unknown to him, belonged to a 16th century sorcerer who tried to use the incantations to summon angels but instead summoned demons.  Eric conjures up a succubus in the form of Joe&#8217;s former girlfriend who goes on a bloody rampage, killing the gamers.  The friends have to survive long enough to send the demon back to Hell.Knights of Badassdom starts off hitting some high notes and the mix of Kwanten, Dinklage, and Zahn makes for several hilarious scenes early on with jokes generally aimed at stereotypical nerdy game players.  Predictble but funny.  Kwanten varies little from his character of Jason Stackhouse playing Joe as simple but honest.  Dinklage and Zahn throw themselves into their characters as gung-ho role-players who prefer fantasy to real life.One the demon is suffered the film loses most of its humorous charm and becomes almost a straight horror film the rest of the way.  Director Joe Lynch gives the demon no personality whatsoever, missing a chance to keep the film on its light-hearted parody trail.  Lynch does make the best of an epic &#8220;battle&#8221; between two rival factions of LARPers but it&#8217;s too little too late.  Dinklage, the most fun member of the cast is killed off far too early and Glau does little more than stand around looking hot&#8230;which she does quite well, however.
