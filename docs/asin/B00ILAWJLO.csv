Not sure who was the brilliant guy behind the production, but they killed the concert with this pissed poor production. As estated above by another reviewer, some cameras are 4x3 stretched to 16x9. Sound in 2009 should be far better than that, period...Warren, Derek your own concerts are far better recorded, why let an a$$ ruin this wonderful night with bad decisions about how we should watch a concert, if you filmed in 4:3. just leave it in 4:3, who cares? But why stretching the image? That is simply ridiculous, an unnaceptable, do you really believe that anybody will believe that a drum is an oval?

What I am impressed with greatly is how great Gregg Allman sings and is genuinely on fire in this concert. I felt the sound mix could have been better but overall the sound in 5.1 is good. I agree the stereo mix is not that great, flat and not dynamic as the 5.1 mix sounds. The guitar playing is top notch from Warren and Derrek, the filming seems to mostly focus on them. Overall I am happy this concert was put on DVD as I missed their final tour despite being in the USA recently. I am hoping more footage from this tour will come out such as the footage with Clapton and other guests.",4,Allman Brothers 40th Anniversary concert (DVD),1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,609,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'What', 'am', 'impressed', 'greatly', 'how', 'great', 'Gregg', 'Allman', 'sings', 'genuinely', 'fire', 'concert', 'felt', 'sound', 'mix', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'overall', 'sound', '5.1', 'good', 'agree', 'stereo', 'mix', 'not', 'great', 'flat', 'not', 'dynamic', '5.1', 'mix', 'sounds', 'guitar', 'playing', 'top', 'notch', 'Warren', 'Derrek', 'filming', 'mostly', 'focus', 'Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'concert', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'missed', 'final', 'tour', 'being', 'USA', 'recently', 'am', 'hoping', 'more', 'footage', 'tour', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'such', 'footage', 'Clapton', 'other', 'guests']",Allman Brothers/40: 40th Anniversary Show Live At The Beacon Theatre

1694598,AM836D28P0EEU,B00ILAWJLO,"Frank Lynch ""frank_lynch""","[21, 23]","There's enough about the description of this to make you skeptical: when you read they're playing the first two albums, you might fear that it's merely a faithful recreation of what you heard 40 years ago. But that's not the case. On the prior Beacon DVD the band seemed to hew to the original solos too much, but that's not the case here. The years have made a difference in terms of the comfort with the material and the chemistry in the band. It's looser, less formal, and the performances here are clearly a product of THIS band, not the one from 1971.That means that the solos are different, the interludes are different, and it's a new experience.Revival not only builds in the snippets of ""Joy To The World"" you remember from Fillmore East, but it's a major springboard for variations. And Elizabeth Reed is stunning; a really great bass solo (with Derek Trucks looking on appreciatively as it happens) followed by the bass player sitting behind Butch's drum kit while Butch mans the tympani, and we get to see an interlude of four drummers going at once.I won't hesitate to review with two or three stars on Amazon. This one gets five: It's really splendid. Don't hesitate for a moment.",5,I couldn't be more pleased with this,1398988800,"05 2, 2014",2014,1194,"['enough', 'description', 'make', 'skeptical', 'when', 'read', ""'re"", 'playing', 'first', 'two', 'albums', 'might', 'fear', 'merely', 'faithful', 'recreation', 'what', 'heard', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'case', 'prior', 'Beacon', 'DVD', 'band', 'seemed', 'hew', 'original', 'solos', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'years', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'terms', 'comfort', 'material', 'chemistry', 'band', 'looser', 'less', 'formal', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'clearly', 'product', 'THIS', 'band', 'not', 'one', '1971.That', 'means', 'solos', 'are', 'different', 'interludes', 'are', 'different', 'new', 'experience.Revival', 'not', 'only', 'snippets', 'Joy', 'World', 'remember', 'Fillmore', 'East', 'major', 'springboard', 'variations', 'Elizabeth', 'Reed', 'stunning', 'really', 'great', 'bass', 'solo', 'Derek', 'Trucks', 'looking', 'appreciatively', 'followed', 'bass', 'player', 'sitting', 'Butch', 'drum', 'kit', 'Butch', 'tympani', 'get', 'see', 'interlude', 'four', 'drummers', 'going', 'once.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'review', 'two', 'three', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'one', 'five', 'really', 'splendid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'moment']",Allman Brothers/40: 40th Anniversary Show Live At The Beacon Theatre
