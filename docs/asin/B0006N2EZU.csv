Now everywhere I look no season 2 and heare's why that is. Apparently word is that the sales to this one just wasn't high enough for Warner to continue on with the series and that's perfectly understandable. The thing that's not letting me give up on this show is this: When Warner started releasing ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" all was good. Let's skip foward to soon after the 4th season was released back in Auguest of 2006. 2007 came...nothing. 2008 came...nothing. Then came May of 2010. I sat down in front of my computer and went on [...] and and seen a headline for Fresh Prince season 5 being on it's way. It said ""Warner has figured it out, crunched the number together and found out a way to make it work""! That got me thinking ""Okay so if that happened to that show why can't they do the same thing for The Wayans Brothers""? After the release of the 4th season of Fresh Prince I kept on getting the same answer that I am getting with this one. Sales just dropped. But they figured it out for Fresh Prince. Why can't they do the same thing for this show? Warner if you are reading this please, just think about it. Like I said brfore the 1st season of this show was released 7 and a half years ago. If Warner continues them now you never know what might happen. The sales just might take a turn for the best.",5,The show must continue.,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,1416,"['7', 'half', 'years', 'Warner', 'home', 'video', 'breathed', 'life', 'hillariously', 'funny', 'goofy', 'show', 'Now', 'everywhere', 'look', 'season', '2', 'heare', 'why', 'Apparently', 'word', 'sales', 'one', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough', 'Warner', 'continue', 'series', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'thing', 'not', 'letting', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'When', 'Warner', 'started', 'releasing', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Bel-Air', 'was', 'good', 'Let', 'skip', 'foward', 'soon', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'back', 'Auguest', '2006', '2007', 'came', 'nothing', '2008', 'came', 'nothing', 'Then', 'came', 'May', '2010', 'sat', 'down', 'front', 'computer', 'went', '[', ']', 'seen', 'headline', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'season', '5', 'being', 'way', 'said', 'Warner', 'figured', 'out', 'crunched', 'number', 'together', 'found', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'work', 'got', 'thinking', 'Okay', 'so', 'happened', 'show', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'release', '4th', 'season', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'kept', 'getting', 'same', 'answer', 'am', 'getting', 'one', 'Sales', 'just', 'dropped', 'figured', 'out', 'Fresh', 'Prince', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'show', 'Warner', 'are', 'reading', 'please', 'just', 'think', 'said', '1st', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'released', '7', 'half', 'years', 'ago', 'Warner', 'now', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'sales', 'just', 'might', 'take', 'turn', 'best']",N/A

I used to like this show, I think Marlon is the funniest actor in Hollywood.  Shawn, however, rides the coat tail of his family and their talent.  Notice how Damon, Marlon, Keenen, and Kim have all done projects aside from their work with the family, but Shawn is always in a movie or show with one of his siblings.  That relates to the TV show because Marlon really makes the show funny.  Shawn's best quality is probably his good looks.  On ""The Wayans Brothers"", Marlon does some crazy things to make you laugh!  I like creativity of the TV show as well as the story line, which is two brothers living together in an urban neighborhood sometimes doing some crazy things to survive.  Marlon annoys Shawn and his girlfriend Lisa throughout the entire first season, but tries to make up for it a couple of times.  Also, they make it seem like Shawn is the ""smart"" one, which is probably a ploy to make him look better since Marlon is the funny one.  This was a good show and it's a shame it was canceled, but I think it will be funny to most who purchase it.  4 stars",4,The Wayans Brothers,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,1183,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', '13', 'episodes', 'included', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'sitcom', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'used', 'like', 'show', 'think', 'Marlon', 'funniest', 'actor', 'Hollywood', 'Shawn', 'however', 'coat', 'tail', 'family', 'talent', 'Notice', 'how', 'Damon', 'Marlon', 'Keenen', 'Kim', 'have', 'done', 'projects', 'aside', 'work', 'family', 'Shawn', 'always', 'movie', 'show', 'one', 'siblings', 'TV', 'show', 'Marlon', 'really', 'show', 'funny', 'Shawn', 'best', 'quality', 'probably', 'good', 'looks', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'Marlon', 'crazy', 'things', 'make', 'like', 'creativity', 'TV', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'two', 'brothers', 'living', 'together', 'urban', 'neighborhood', 'sometimes', 'doing', 'crazy', 'things', 'survive', 'Marlon', 'Shawn', 'girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'make', 'up', 'couple', 'times', 'Also', 'make', 'Shawn', 'smart', 'one', 'probably', 'ploy', 'make', 'look', 'better', 'Marlon', 'funny', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'shame', 'was', 'canceled', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'funny', 'most', 'who', 'purchase', '4', 'stars']",N/A
