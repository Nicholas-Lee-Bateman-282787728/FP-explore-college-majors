It may not have all the special effects, blood and guts of current cop shows, but it does show the procedures and professionalism expected and performed by the Los Angeles P.D. in the time-frame it was made (late 1960s early 1970s). I also watch Adam-12 episodes on ME-TV, and think I've watched more of them recently than when I did as a kid. These episodes remind me of some of the police novels by Joseph Wambaugh (like the book &#34;the New Centurions&#34;).
