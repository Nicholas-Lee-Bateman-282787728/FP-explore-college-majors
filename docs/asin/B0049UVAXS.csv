It is based on the true story of 71 student soldiers who in 1950 were left on a corner of the Pusan Perimeter to slow the DPRK advance.  People must realize it is a movie and it is not going to be 100% historically accurate.  I personally was picking out equipment inaccuracies in the movie, like using M-4 Shermans and M-48 Pattons for T-34s.  I also saw a couple rubber M-1 Garands get into the scene that should have been in the background, minor issue that most would not catch.  I thought the acting was good and the story kept you drawn in.  This is right up there with Tae Guk Gi.  For those complaining about the blood and explosions... this is a war movie not a dramatic comedy.  The koreans always seem to budget plenty of money for blood and gore in their movies.  Definitely more realistic than what you see in most movies out of Hollywood.  If you watch the credits you see some of the interviews with the real life survivors of this battle.

Since it is based on true events I would have much prefered they stick to those rather than make it into some sort of Hong Kong-ish action film.

1390283,A18JUJK45EXE4,B0049UVAXS,Jared M,"[4, 7]","The Korean War was one of the bitterest conflicts in history, but being sandwiched between the Second World War and the Vietnam War, is little more than a Forgotten War in the minds of many.  The stalemate between the Communist forces and the United Nations marked the start of the Cold War.  The early days of the Korean War were the most desperate as the American forces had yet to arrive in any substantial numbers, leaving South Koreans to bear the brunt of the fighting.  To fill in the gaps in the military forces facing the North Korean onslaught as they marched down the peninsula towards the Pusan Perimeter, large numbers of high school and university students formed volunteer units to assist the South Korean soldiers in defending their country. The basis of ""71: Into the Fire"" is the battle efforts of those students at a place called Pohang.  Sadly, despite high production values, the failings of the plot and characterization don't do the basic premise of the story justice, and instead is a load of cliches and unbelievable action sequences.After an initial opening sequence in which we are introduced to the shell-shocked leader of the students (played by Choi Seung-hyeon), the ranks of the student soldiers are found to be a mixture of juvenile delinquents, the leader of which immediately and predictably starts to undermine Choi's leadership, and the usual suspects - nerds, siblings and wannabe comedians.  Initially a disparate bunch of individuals, charged with protecting a school, the student soldiers predictably bond under fire as the school comes under siege from the North Koreans.""71: Into the Fire"" really does come into its own during the battle sequences.  The special effects are topnotch, just as good as one would see in Hollywood blockbusters, and clearly no effort has been spared in re-enacting the intensity of warfare.  Still, it was necessary to have to put one's brain in neutral during the extended battle sequence as the North Koreans attack the school in which the student soldiers have holed up.  The plot makes great play of the fact that the North Korea soldiers are ""Shock Troops"", making their way to Pohang.  Presumably these soldiers are highly trained and experienced fighting men, befitting their leader (played by Cha Seung-won, who was the standout actor for me, pulling off a grimy, rugged and battle experienced performance).  Yet a bunch of student soldiers, barely able to shoot straight a few days before, cuts down wave after wave of these soldiers with little effort. This is abundantly apparent in a rooftop sequence where the thought of taking cover does not appear to enter the minds of about 30 or so North Korean soldiers!As a war film, ""71: Into the Fire"" does what is expected.  Heroism abounds, as does explosions, shell casings and tragic and gory deaths.  However, as a measured tribute to the bravery of the student soldiers, ""71: Into the Fire"" doesn't quite make the grade because of the plot and its usual clich&eacute;s.Special Features: The CineAsia two disc release of this film comes with a disc of extras, including a ""Making of"" documentary,  featurettes on pre-production and production design, audio commentary by Bey Logan and Mike Leeder (experts on Asian Cinema), deleted scenes, behind the scenes, among other bonus features.",3,71: Into the Fire,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,3318,"['Korean', 'War', 'was', 'one', 'bitterest', 'conflicts', 'history', 'being', 'sandwiched', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'little', 'more', 'Forgotten', 'War', 'minds', 'many', 'stalemate', 'Communist', 'forces', 'United', 'Nations', 'marked', 'start', 'Cold', 'War', 'early', 'days', 'Korean', 'War', 'were', 'most', 'desperate', 'American', 'forces', 'had', 'yet', 'arrive', 'substantial', 'numbers', 'leaving', 'South', 'Koreans', 'bear', 'brunt', 'fighting', 'fill', 'gaps', 'military', 'forces', 'facing', 'North', 'Korean', 'onslaught', 'marched', 'peninsula', 'Pusan', 'Perimeter', 'large', 'numbers', 'high', 'school', 'university', 'students', 'formed', 'volunteer', 'units', 'assist', 'South', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'defending', 'country', 'basis', '71', 'Fire', 'battle', 'efforts', 'students', 'place', 'called', 'Pohang', 'Sadly', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'failings', 'plot', 'characterization', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'basic', 'premise', 'story', 'justice', 'instead', 'load', 'cliches', 'unbelievable', 'action', 'sequences.After', 'initial', 'opening', 'sequence', 'are', 'introduced', 'shell-shocked', 'leader', 'students', 'played', 'Choi', 'Seung-hyeon', 'ranks', 'student', 'soldiers', 'are', 'found', 'be', 'mixture', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'leader', 'immediately', 'predictably', 'undermine', 'Choi', 'leadership', 'usual', 'nerds', 'siblings', 'wannabe', 'comedians', 'Initially', 'disparate', 'bunch', 'individuals', 'charged', 'protecting', 'school', 'student', 'predictably', 'bond', 'fire', 'school', 'siege', 'North', 'Koreans', '71', 'Fire', 'really', 'come', 'own', 'battle', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'topnotch', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', 'clearly', 'effort', 'been', 'spared', 're-enacting', 'intensity', 'warfare', 'Still', 'was', 'necessary', 'have', 'put', 'one', 'brain', 'neutral', 'extended', 'battle', 'sequence', 'North', 'Koreans', 'attack', 'school', 'student', 'soldiers', 'have', 'holed', 'up', 'plot', 'great', 'play', 'fact', 'North', 'Korea', 'soldiers', 'are', 'Shock', 'Troops', 'making', 'way', 'Pohang', 'Presumably', 'soldiers', 'are', 'highly', 'trained', 'experienced', 'fighting', 'men', 'befitting', 'leader', 'played', 'Cha', 'Seung-won', 'who', 'was', 'standout', 'actor', 'pulling', 'off', 'grimy', 'rugged', 'battle', 'experienced', 'performance', 'bunch', 'student', 'soldiers', 'barely', 'able', 'shoot', 'straight', 'few', 'days', 'cuts', 'down', 'wave', 'wave', 'soldiers', 'little', 'effort', 'abundantly', 'apparent', 'rooftop', 'sequence', 'where', 'thought', 'taking', 'cover', 'not', 'appear', 'enter', 'minds', 'about', '30', 'so', 'North', 'Korean', 'soldiers', 'war', 'film', '71', 'Fire', 'what', 'expected', 'Heroism', 'explosions', 'shell', 'casings', 'tragic', 'gory', 'deaths', 'However', 'measured', 'tribute', 'bravery', 'student', 'soldiers', '71', 'Fire', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'grade', 'plot', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.Special', 'Features', 'CineAsia', 'two', 'disc', 'release', 'film', 'disc', 'extras', 'including', 'Making', 'documentary', 'pre-production', 'production', 'design', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'Mike', 'Leeder', 'experts', 'Asian', 'Cinema', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'other', 'bonus', 'features']",N/A

1390285,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B0049UVAXS,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[3, 3]","This review contains some limited SPOILERS.The story described in this film really happened. On 11 August 1950, during the battle of P'ohang-dong (part of the crucially important campaign of defense of Pusan perimeter), a group of 71 South Korean hastily conscripted teenagers fought an 11 hours battle against the attacking North Korean 766th Independent Regiment of Infantry (in fact a reinforced batallion of light infantry).The South Koreans made their stand in and around the building of a high-school for girls (civilians were previously evacuated). The position they were holding protected the flank of South Korean main force, which was at that moment already heavily pressed by the main North Korean attack and awaited reinforcements to counter-attack (they ultimately arrived at the end of the day). The defenders had for all weapons their rifles (semi-automatic M1Garands), hand greandes and Molotov cocktaisl, with one 60 mm light mortar as their only support weapon. North Koreans were lightly armed and poorly equipped to attack even an improvised position (no artillery, no air support, no mortars, no flame throwers) but were much, much more numerous (maybe as much as 800) and many of them had fully automatic weapons (PPSh-41 sub-macine guns) and they carried also some Degtyaryev DP light machine guns.After the failure of the first attack North Korean commander committed a platoon of BA-64 light armoured cars. When the second attack failed even worse, North Koreans engaged finally also a couple of T-34/85 tanks. At the end of the fighting 48 young South Korean students were laying dead. North Koreans however suffered much heavier losses and even more critically, they lost the one thing that can NEVER be recovered - crucial time...Now, this film was supposed to pay respect to those brave students, who certainly desserved to be remembered, as they risked (and for many gave) their life for their country at an age when boys should be learning, playing football and falling for the first time in love, and not waging war (most of them were no older than 15...). But, at least for my personnal taste, it did not fully succeed.The film contains lots of action and is filled with explosions (although most of them are clearly exploding bottles of gasoline, rather than real explosives), sprinkling blood and body parts flying in all directions, but I found many (not all) of the fighting scenes unrealistic. Especially the last attack against the school is disappointing. Some people compared this film to ""Saving Private Ryan"", but this is a complete misunderstanding - in this film people fight and die much more like in ""Missing in action"" franchise than in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece.Characters of the students are rather poorly developped, with especially their leader being a completely wooden figure. The only people who seem really alive amongst the defenders are the three older criminals (they are 18 or 19 years old) added to the 68 students.There is some good insight into the ideological mindframe of North Korean soldiers. The character of the North Korean regiment commander is an interesting mixture of intelligence, compassion, steel determination and - when necessary - great violence. There is however one element (sorry, SPOILER here) which is completely and totally unbelievable, as there is no way that any commander in a communist army treats his political officer with such contempt and brutality - at least not if he wants to live... Sadly, towards the end the North Korean commander is suddenly reduced to a ""standard issue"" villain, straight from a comic-book for teenagers.So although there are some good things in this film, I can not give it more than three stars. It is less good than ""Botherhood of war"" and many levels below the extraordinary ""The Frontline"".

It is slightly reminiscent of the German WW 2 film 'Die Brucke' or The Bridge,The Bridge (Die Brucke) [DVD] [1959] where school children are left to defend a bridge against overwhelming odds, but this has buckets more action.The events unfold in a mix of real time and some flash backs which help to create empathy for the main characters, who are all desperately young and most still in school uniforms.The action scenes are regular and bloody, they have built on the incredible realism that we saw in films like `Brotherhood',Brotherhood [DVD] [2004]and the excellent 'Assembly'Assembly [2007] [DVD] and first came to the fore in the West with `Saving Private Ryan'. Like those films, this is in Korean with English sub titles. I do not want to give away any plot spoilers as this is a rollicking rollercoaster from start to finish, during the more contemplative moments I was actually glad for a breather, such is the intensity of this film. It is 116 minutes long, which seems like a long film, but the time just flew past and there is so much action in it I feel I will have to view this again to be sure I did not miss too much. There are some plot holes and quite clearly this is `based' on actual events, all of that aside this is one of the best films I have seen in ages.",5,More Action from South Korea and its ruddy marvelous,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,1803,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'one', 'am', 'fan', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'wake', 'many', 'other', 'excellent', 'films', 'South', 'Korea', 'telling', 'stories', 'came', 'still', 'ongoing', 'civil', 'war.Once', 'again', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'August', '11th', '1950', 'when', 'group', 'volunteer', 'Student', 'Soldiers', 'held', 'back', 'North', 'Korean', 'commando', 'brigade', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'outnumbered', 'being', 'only', '71', 'number', 'hence', 'title', 'film', 'show', 'remarkable', 'ingenuity', 'tenacity', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'German', 'WW', '2', 'film', ""'Die"", 'Brucke', 'Bridge', 'Bridge', 'Die', 'Brucke', '[', 'DVD', ']', '[', '1959', ']', 'where', 'school', 'children', 'are', 'left', 'defend', 'bridge', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'more', 'action.The', 'events', 'unfold', 'mix', 'real', 'time', 'flash', 'backs', 'help', 'create', 'empathy', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'desperately', 'young', 'most', 'still', 'school', 'uniforms.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'regular', 'bloody', 'have', 'built', 'incredible', 'realism', 'saw', 'films', 'Brotherhood', 'Brotherhood', '[', 'DVD', ']', '[', '2004', ']', 'excellent', ""'Assembly'Assembly"", '[', '2007', ']', '[', 'DVD', ']', 'first', 'came', 'fore', 'West', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'films', 'Korean', 'English', 'sub', 'titles', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'spoilers', 'rollicking', 'rollercoaster', 'start', 'finish', 'more', 'contemplative', 'moments', 'was', 'actually', 'glad', 'breather', 'such', 'intensity', 'film', '116', 'minutes', 'long', 'long', 'film', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'past', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'feel', 'will', 'have', 'view', 'again', 'be', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'quite', 'clearly', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'aside', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'ages']",N/A
1390291,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0049UVAXS,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Set in 1950, a Korean war movie ""71: Into the Fire"" is based on the battle account during the Korean War and the seventy-one students who volunteered to fight as a soldier.Overwhelmed by the fierce attacks from the North Korean forces, the South Korean forces decide to transfer all the regular armies to P'ohang-dong, the last line of defense for South Korean and UN forces. This means seventy-one inexperienced student soldiers have to defend the city of Pohang alone, while outnumbered by the North Korea's well-trained troops led by battle-hardened Commander Park Mu-Rang (Cha Seung-Won).Unlike ""300"" and ""The Alamo,"" all the soldiers are teenagers (or younger). Among them are Oh Jang-bom (Choi Seung-hyeon, T.O.P of the band Big Bang), survivor of the previous battle. The quiet student is made a makeshift captain of the young soldiers with no practical experience of war, including Kap-jo (Sang-woo Kwone), a ""juvenile delinquent,"" whose real purpose of joining the army is revenge for the deaths of his parents.First I must say ""71: Into the Fire"" is not free from war movie conventions. Actually, it is full of them, making some of the scenes (including the two big combat sequences) borderline clich&eacute;. Except for some (misguided, I think) attempt at comedy, however, the film works surprisingly well, with very good acting from the leads and the well-executed stunts. Some of the characters are just stock types, and some episodes are too good to be true, but John H. Lee, better known for his love stories like ""A Moment to Remember,"" knows exactly how to keep us interested in the characters and their fates with slick storytelling.""71: Into the Fire"" may not break any new ground, but the film remains absorbing throughout.",4,(3.5 STARS) War as They See it: Absorbing,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,1744,"['Set', '1950', 'Korean', 'war', 'movie', '71', 'Fire', 'based', 'battle', 'account', 'Korean', 'War', 'seventy-one', 'students', 'who', 'volunteered', 'fight', 'soldier.Overwhelmed', 'fierce', 'attacks', 'North', 'Korean', 'forces', 'South', 'Korean', 'forces', 'decide', 'transfer', 'regular', 'armies', ""P'ohang-dong"", 'last', 'line', 'defense', 'South', 'Korean', 'UN', 'forces', 'seventy-one', 'inexperienced', 'student', 'soldiers', 'have', 'defend', 'city', 'Pohang', 'alone', 'outnumbered', 'North', 'Korea', 'well-trained', 'troops', 'led', 'battle-hardened', 'Commander', 'Park', 'Mu-Rang', 'Cha', 'Seung-Won', '300', 'Alamo', 'soldiers', 'are', 'teenagers', 'younger', 'are', 'Oh', 'Jang-bom', 'Choi', 'Seung-hyeon', 'T.O.P', 'band', 'Big', 'Bang', 'survivor', 'previous', 'battle', 'quiet', 'student', 'made', 'makeshift', 'captain', 'young', 'soldiers', 'practical', 'experience', 'war', 'including', 'Kap-jo', 'Sang-woo', 'Kwone', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'real', 'purpose', 'joining', 'army', 'revenge', 'deaths', 'parents.First', 'must', 'say', '71', 'Fire', 'not', 'free', 'war', 'movie', 'conventions', 'Actually', 'full', 'making', 'scenes', 'including', 'two', 'big', 'combat', 'sequences', 'borderline', 'clich', 'eacute', 'misguided', 'think', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'however', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'leads', 'well-executed', 'stunts', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'stock', 'types', 'episodes', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'John', 'H.', 'Lee', 'better', 'known', 'love', 'stories', 'A', 'Moment', 'Remember', 'exactly', 'how', 'keep', 'interested', 'characters', 'fates', 'slick', 'storytelling', '71', 'Fire', 'may', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'film', 'absorbing']",N/A
