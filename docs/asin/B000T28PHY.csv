1088228,A1HH0396RHYJIN,B000T28PHY,HISTORY GOURMET,"[10, 24]","I love military history, as well as Biblical history, so I thought this would be a good merger of the 2. It is a well researched program, as well as being excellently re-enacted in it's live scenes. My problem with it is that NO credit is given to The Lord for what occured during these battles..........NONE !!!!!!!!!! The Bible is explicit,in some of these accounts,in that God brought the Isrealites victory ( or defeat ), due to their faith in Him and their devotion to Him. None of that is covered in this show ; it suggests that all these conflicts were won solely by the Isreali comanders involved ( i.e. Moses, Joshua, Saul and David ),and their troops. God gave these men the knowledge,ability and courage to triumph in these struggles,as well as adding the weight of nature to the fight in favor of the Hebrews. Anyone who believes in the Bible believes in that ( or should ). It's astonishing that any program discussing the Bible would omit any reference to God's part in these events : in fact, at one point, one of the military historians who are adding their personal insight to the narration, actually questions God's existence,period !!!!!!!! Strange words for a Biblical show, I must say.

1088229,A1GSWZ1WEDN07Z,B000T28PHY,"Michael D. Castle ""Silverquill""","[17, 17]","If you are studying the Old Testament of the Bible, this History Channel program gives a unique perspective of events of the time, told from the point of view of the soldier. The perspective is supported by both Biblical text and Egyptian texts describing the various events. This program provides a humanistic opinion of Old Testament events that involved warfare as told in a very logical sequencing of military thought and strategy. I highly recommend this program for anyone doing in depth study of the Old Testament or Torah.",5,Understanding the Old Testament a bit better,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,530,"['are', 'studying', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Bible', 'History', 'Channel', 'program', 'unique', 'perspective', 'events', 'time', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'soldier', 'perspective', 'supported', 'Biblical', 'text', 'Egyptian', 'texts', 'describing', 'various', 'events', 'program', 'humanistic', 'opinion', 'Old', 'Testament', 'events', 'involved', 'warfare', 'told', 'very', 'logical', 'sequencing', 'military', 'thought', 'strategy', 'highly', 'recommend', 'program', 'anyone', 'doing', 'depth', 'study', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Torah']",History Channel: Bible Battles
1088230,A9VFS62QSJH2E,B000T28PHY,Midwest Guy,"[4, 22]","The narrative attempts to give one the idea the Jews were not in bondage, they simple walked out as a military force completely glossing over the impact of the plagues sent by God via Moses.  If you are a Jew or Christian who believes in God you will find this narrative slightly offensive.  Once again, humanistic academia tries to rewrite history and the bible... give them enough time and the Jews will be written right out of history.  They take one word, they left with ""boldness"" to build a whole story around one word... amazing, while ignoring other scripture that clearly says they are in bondage!  And crossing of the Red Sea once again, the winds just blew a path since it was so shallow , yet the same shallow water seemed to destroy the Egyptian army.  You will pick up on the subtle anti-God themes throughout!  Its funny, they have been trying to prove the Bible wrong for over 1500 year and they still can not!!  I also love how they make David look like a man and the Giant look like a semi-large man and show how easily it was to defeat him (again taking God out of the equation).  It clearly says he was a boy (not a soldier - took care of sheep).  No other hardened soldier stepped forward to fight, yet a boy defeated him with Gods help.Trust me it will not be long and they will be saying the Jews were never killed in WWII and Christ never walked the earth!  I was hoping for a military tactics, instead at every turn they take and try to destoy credibility of real events.  The Title should be how Humanstic Academia can use a military theme to further support thier obvious lack of faith in the Bible.They really could have just talked tactics and if they want to make a point pertaining to God at least give both viewpoints , and say "" which ever you believe"" then continue, but instead their strong bias comes out very clear!",1,Very Humanistic Point of View!,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,1852,"['narrative', 'attempts', 'give', 'one', 'idea', 'Jews', 'were', 'not', 'bondage', 'simple', 'walked', 'out', 'military', 'force', 'completely', 'glossing', 'impact', 'plagues', 'sent', 'God', 'Moses', 'are', 'Jew', 'Christian', 'who', 'God', 'will', 'find', 'narrative', 'slightly', 'offensive', 'Once', 'again', 'humanistic', 'academia', 'tries', 'rewrite', 'history', 'bible', 'give', 'enough', 'time', 'Jews', 'will', 'be', 'written', 'right', 'history', 'take', 'one', 'word', 'left', 'boldness', 'build', 'whole', 'story', 'one', 'word', 'amazing', 'ignoring', 'other', 'scripture', 'clearly', 'are', 'bondage', 'crossing', 'Red', 'Sea', 'once', 'again', 'winds', 'just', 'blew', 'path', 'was', 'so', 'shallow', 'yet', 'same', 'shallow', 'water', 'seemed', 'destroy', 'Egyptian', 'army', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'subtle', 'anti-God', 'themes', 'funny', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'prove', 'Bible', 'wrong', '1500', 'year', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'make', 'David', 'look', 'man', 'Giant', 'look', 'semi-large', 'man', 'show', 'how', 'easily', 'was', 'defeat', 'again', 'taking', 'God', 'equation', 'clearly', 'was', 'boy', 'not', 'soldier', 'took', 'care', 'sheep', 'No', 'other', 'hardened', 'soldier', 'stepped', 'forward', 'fight', 'yet', 'boy', 'defeated', 'Gods', 'help.Trust', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'saying', 'Jews', 'were', 'never', 'killed', 'WWII', 'Christ', 'never', 'walked', 'earth', 'was', 'hoping', 'military', 'tactics', 'instead', 'turn', 'take', 'try', 'destoy', 'credibility', 'real', 'events', 'Title', 'should', 'be', 'how', 'Humanstic', 'Academia', 'can', 'use', 'military', 'theme', 'further', 'support', 'thier', 'obvious', 'lack', 'faith', 'Bible.They', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'talked', 'tactics', 'want', 'make', 'point', 'pertaining', 'God', 'least', 'give', 'viewpoints', 'say', 'ever', 'believe', 'then', 'continue', 'instead', 'strong', 'bias', 'out', 'very', 'clear']",History Channel: Bible Battles

1088232,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000T28PHY,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 1]","This 90-minute History Channel documentary (ignore the dust jacket that says it is 100 minutes) from 2005 is a fun and fast-moving analysis of military battles in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, starting with Abraham's rescue of his nephew Lot and continuing through the military exploits of figures like Moses and the judge Deborah. Unlike many older History Channel videos deceptively packaged under recent copyrights in the same style of artwork, this is actually a modern (i.e. within the past ten years) production that features excellent CGI animations and rousing battle recreations. This video is no stale 1990s documentary with still art photography and pompous voiceovers, like many older History Channel or A&E; biblical documentaries, but is a slickly produced &#34;infotainment&#34; tour of the Bible in the more current History Channel style.The film's details about weapons and tactics are a bit excessive, and the Vietnam veteran-professor who provides most of the analysis seems just slightly on the crackpot side, but it's fascinating to see the Biblical battles presented in a way that presumes the reliability of scripture as a historical text. While one wishes for a bit more stuff on the archaeological record of these events, the documentary offers the intriguing hypothesis that the Bible is a treasure trove of accurate military history replete with rich information about ancient battle tactics, and it does so in an entertaining way. The film is just a touch bloody, but it's not excessive, and it's not boring at all. It's certainly modern enough to hold the attention of young people today, with appealing graphics and visuals that catch the eye. I would recommend it for religion students both young and old, but also for military history buffs who enjoy learning about ancient military culture. &#34;Bible Battles&#34; is not very deep, but it's fun, and it is respectful of the religious texts without trying to deconstruct them.",5,The Bible as military history,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,1964,"['90-minute', 'History', 'Channel', 'documentary', 'dust', 'jacket', '100', 'minutes', '2005', 'fun', 'fast-moving', 'analysis', 'military', 'battles', 'Old', 'Testament', 'Hebrew', 'Bible', 'starting', 'Abraham', 'rescue', 'nephew', 'Lot', 'continuing', 'military', 'exploits', 'figures', 'Moses', 'judge', 'Deborah', 'many', 'older', 'History', 'Channel', 'videos', 'deceptively', 'packaged', 'recent', 'copyrights', 'same', 'style', 'artwork', 'actually', 'modern', 'i.e', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'production', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'animations', 'rousing', 'battle', 'recreations', 'video', 'stale', '1990s', 'documentary', 'still', 'art', 'photography', 'pompous', 'voiceovers', 'many', 'older', 'History', 'Channel', 'A', 'E', 'biblical', 'documentaries', 'slickly', 'produced', '34', 'infotainment', '34', 'tour', 'Bible', 'more', 'current', 'History', 'Channel', 'style.The', 'film', 'details', 'weapons', 'tactics', 'are', 'bit', 'excessive', 'Vietnam', 'veteran-professor', 'who', 'most', 'analysis', 'just', 'slightly', 'crackpot', 'side', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Biblical', 'battles', 'presented', 'way', 'reliability', 'scripture', 'historical', 'text', 'one', 'wishes', 'bit', 'more', 'stuff', 'archaeological', 'record', 'events', 'documentary', 'intriguing', 'hypothesis', 'Bible', 'treasure', 'trove', 'accurate', 'military', 'history', 'replete', 'rich', 'information', 'ancient', 'battle', 'tactics', 'so', 'entertaining', 'way', 'film', 'just', 'touch', 'bloody', 'not', 'excessive', 'not', 'boring', 'certainly', 'modern', 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'young', 'people', 'today', 'appealing', 'graphics', 'visuals', 'catch', 'eye', 'would', 'recommend', 'religion', 'students', 'young', 'old', 'also', 'military', 'history', 'buffs', 'who', 'enjoy', 'learning', 'ancient', 'military', 'culture', '34', 'Bible', 'Battles', '34', 'not', 'very', 'deep', 'fun', 'respectful', 'religious', 'texts', 'trying', 'deconstruct']",History Channel: Bible Battles
