1377150,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B003Z94WC0,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 0]","In a performance where the actor and character fit perfectly together, so that it's impossible after seeing it to envision another actor/actress in that role, Doris Roberts plays Mrs. Merkle.  She's a new housekeeper who comes to look after the rambunctious twin elementary-age sons of a widower.  The circumstances of her arrival are mysterious, but she quickly wins over everyone's trust, and it becomes clear to us, the audience, that she has supernatural capabilities as their guardian angel.  But this is never clear to any of the characters, which is what makes it fun:  we know the secret which none of the characters knows.  I really enjoy the tricks she pulls to help the twin boys' father learn to move on past his grief about his wife and to help a single woman learn forgiveness, and to get them hooked up with each other.  The plot elements work very well in the story, and for a Christmas family movie, it is surprisingly hard-hitting in its lessons about healthy relationships.  And it's all thanks to Mrs. Merkle, whom the kids call Mrs. Miracle, that the single woman and the widower move past their own pasts and live happily ever after.I know that's not saying much about how the story plays out, but trust me:  to reveal more would be spoilers.  There are 3 reasons why I think this is a 5-star movie:  1) The really well-constructed story, based on a book by Debbie Macomber.  2) The acting feels more real than in a lot of family movies.  The people feel very believable.  It's rare to find a message movie that feels like a real story which you don't feel manipulated by.  Not that it's bad to be manipulated by a &#34;message movie&#34;, but I like it most when you are engaged in the story and not so focused on what the story is trying to say.  This movie, thanks to the acting which helps it feel real, is a paragon (outstanding example) in the large assortment of message movies.  3) Mrs. Miracle gets less screen time than the male and female protagonists, but she is so fun, and Doris Roberts just has to be herself for the character to work.  There's nothing all that special about the quality of her acting, just an authentic personality, like Gary Cooper investing himself in one of his &#34;decent Americana&#34; roles.  The last time I saw a character so captivating in a family movie/message movie was Kirk Cameron in Fireproof.  The personality Doris Roberts exhibits as Mrs. Miracle and the covert, sometimes mischievous things she does to align circumstances, are my favorite thing in the movie.",5,"3 reasons to see it:  well-constructed story, acting is a paragon among message movies, & Doris Roberts's delightful character",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2534,"['performance', 'where', 'actor', 'character', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'together', 'impossible', 'seeing', 'envision', 'actor/actress', 'role', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Mrs.', 'Merkle', 'new', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'look', 'rambunctious', 'twin', 'elementary-age', 'sons', 'widower', 'circumstances', 'arrival', 'are', 'mysterious', 'quickly', 'everyone', 'trust', 'clear', 'audience', 'supernatural', 'capabilities', 'guardian', 'angel', 'never', 'clear', 'characters', 'what', 'fun', 'know', 'secret', 'none', 'characters', 'really', 'enjoy', 'tricks', 'help', 'twin', 'father', 'learn', 'move', 'grief', 'wife', 'help', 'single', 'woman', 'learn', 'forgiveness', 'get', 'hooked', 'up', 'other', 'plot', 'elements', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'story', 'Christmas', 'family', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'hard-hitting', 'lessons', 'healthy', 'relationships', 'thanks', 'Mrs.', 'Merkle', 'whom', 'kids', 'call', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'single', 'woman', 'widower', 'move', 'own', 'pasts', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.I', 'know', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'how', 'story', 'out', 'reveal', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'spoilers', 'are', '3', 'reasons', 'why', 'think', '5-star', 'movie', '1', 'really', 'well-constructed', 'story', 'based', 'book', 'Debbie', 'Macomber', '2', 'acting', 'feels', 'more', 'real', 'lot', 'family', 'movies', 'people', 'feel', 'very', 'believable', 'rare', 'find', 'message', 'movie', 'real', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'manipulated', 'Not', 'bad', 'be', 'manipulated', '34', 'message', 'movie', '34', 'like', 'most', 'when', 'are', 'engaged', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'focused', 'what', 'story', 'trying', 'say', 'movie', 'thanks', 'acting', 'feel', 'real', 'paragon', 'outstanding', 'example', 'large', 'assortment', 'message', 'movies', '3', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'male', 'female', 'protagonists', 'so', 'fun', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'just', 'be', 'character', 'work', 'nothing', 'special', 'quality', 'acting', 'just', 'authentic', 'personality', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'investing', 'one', '34', 'decent', 'Americana', '34', 'roles', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'character', 'so', 'captivating', 'family', 'movie/message', 'movie', 'was', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'Fireproof', 'personality', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'covert', 'sometimes', 'mischievous', 'things', 'align', 'circumstances', 'are', 'favorite', 'thing', 'movie']",N/A

The original novel has sold over 60 million copies and with the holiday season around the corner, the film ""Mrs. Miracle"" starring Doris Roberts (""Everybody Loves Raymond""), James Van Der Beek (""Dawson's Creek"", ""Varsity Blues"") and Erin Karpluk (""Being Erica"", ""Life Unexpected"") is set for a release on DVD.""Mrs. Miracle"" revolves around Seth Webster (played by Van Der Beek) and Reba Maxwell (played by Erin Karpluk), two people who are going through their own personal pain in their lives.Seth is widower with two six-year-old twin boys Jason and Judd and as a pianist, since the death of his wife, not only has he stopped playing the piano, he has kept the existence of his deceased wife away from them.  Unwilling to talk about her until they grow older, despite the kids wanting to know more about their mother.  So, while Seth focuses on his construction company, he tries to find a nanny to watch over the kids.Unfortunately for Seth, every nanny that have been hired tend to quit on the Webster family because they can't deal with Jason and Judd, as the two are kids that tend to get into mischief.Meanwhile, Reba is is a young woman who owns her own travel agency.  A once aspiring actress, her life has been turned upside down when her older sister Vicki (played by Johannah Newmarch) had stolen her fiance a day before their wedding day.  So, part of her has remained a bit bitter and she tends to focus her life around her career.  Her good friend Kate (played by Chelah Horsdal) tries to get Reba away from her business and have some fun but unfortunately Reba is not budging.As for the Webster's, their life seems to change with the arrival of Mrs. Merkle (played by Doris Roberts), a new nanny assigned to the family and one who accepts the children and tries to bring some good into the family who is in need of some help.  But Mrs. Merkle appears to be more than just a regular nanny.Immediately, Mrs. Merkle uses her magical ways in trying to help the children and Seth but also finding a way for Reba to break out of her shell and become the director of the Christmas play (which the Webster twins are part of).While trying to bring some magic and help Seth's broken heart, she finds a way for both Seth and Reba to meet and from their, the two go on that first date.  But with these two people who have had major pain in their lives... will they be able  to come together and find love with one another?  With Mrs. Merkle/Mrs. Miracle around, most definitely.VIDEO:""Mrs. Miracle"" is presented in Anamorphic widescreen (1:78:1).  For those looking for a holiday-themed film, ""Mrs. Miracle"" definitely brings that Christmas atmosphere to your home viewing experience.  With that being said, picture quality is fine, as with most DVD releases, you are going to see compression artifacts and banding with this title.  But if you are not that picky with overall PQ, the video is just fine.AUDIO:""Mrs. Miracle"" is presented in English 5.0 Dolby Digital.  The film is dialogue driven and is heard through the front and center channels quite clearly.  I didn't notice much usage of the surround channels but for the most part, dialogue and also the music are heard quite fine through the front channels.Subtitles are in English, French, Spanish and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Mrs. Miracle"" comes with no special features but previews.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to the holidays, I tend to expect an emotional Hallmark holiday film.  And since the release of ""The Note"" films, I have come to appreciate the Hallmark holiday films as we don't see the original holiday new movies as much as before, but more of the usual holiday repeats on television.In the case of ""Mrs. Miracle"", it is your typical film in which someone comes into the life of a family in need of some help and this magical person... Mrs. Miracle is there to help.  And personally, I have watched these kind of films many times but I keep coming back to them because I'm always open to films that showcase hope, overcoming pain and faith.  It helps that the film is a holiday film as well because I do believe that there are people who have go through heartbreak or some pain around the holiday season that you just want to watch an uplifting film, despite its banality.""Mrs. Miracle"" is a feel-good film with a happy ending and it's a Hallmark film which you don't ask for much but just to be entertained and even shed a tear or two.I did enjoy the film adaptation of ""Mrs. Miracle"", I haven't read the novel but it was a holiday film that is very easy to get into and enjoy.  It's important to note that while there are children in this film and a viewer will need to sit through children singing Christmas songs, the film is more for the adults than the entire family.  The emotional situations that both the main characters are going through, it's one of those things that children probably will not understand.  From Seth's difficulty of having to openly talk about his deceased wife which is too hard for him and for Reba, it's the sheer hatred she has for her sister for taking her fiance away from her and now with the holiday season coming up, her mother wanting to bring her daughters together for the holidays.  So, the emotional driven storylines of both main characters probably won't go over too well with the young children.I have to admit that having watched James Van Der Beek on ""Dawson's Creek"" it was a bit of a trip to watch him as a father of two children but for the most part, he played the part of the hurting father quite well, as did Erin Karpluk with her role as the new girlfriend with a painful past.  Doris Roberts is just an actress you just enjoy watching (especially if you are a ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" fan).  Granted, a different kind of character as Mrs. Miracle is more about helping the family or people in need.Overall, ""Mrs. Miracle"" was a touching holiday film.  By no means is this film like a modern-day Mary Poppins but it is a film that is much more in common with the usual angel as a human trying to help out a person in need, or two humans in need.  Sure, it's a story that many of us are used to but in the context of the Holiday spirit, once in awhile, you need these upbeat, Christmas films with a happy ending.  A heartfelt and enjoyable Christmas film that just makes you feel good around the holidays. A holiday film where you can just hope to be entertained, not expecting too much but expecting something positive and uplifting...especially if you are feeling all stressed, bummed out and worked during the holidays.If you're in this position, ""Mrs. Miracle"" can at least give you the benefit of being entertained, but also giving you that feeling of forgiveness and hope if you are open to these magical holiday films.",4,"Looking for that feel-good holiday film on DVD, ""Mrs. Miracle"" is definitely for you!",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,6879,"['December', '2009', 'novel', 'movie',

1377186,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B003Z94WC0,J. Olsen,"[19, 20]","As the movie began it was very reminiscent of the opening of the movie ""Nanny Express."" Nannies are coming and going at a rapid pace, unable to cope with the two rambunctious kids of a widowed man. But in this case the kids are twin six-year-old boys who need a role-model, not a playmate for a father (according to one departing nanny). They are not bratty, spoiled kids who are annoying to watch, they are just kids who have lacked good parenting and need some guidance.The storyline has been very thoroughly covered in a previous review, so I won't spend time there. ""Mrs. Miracle,"" whose name is really Mrs. Merkle but the twins keep getting it wrong and it sticks, is played delightfully by Doris Roberts. She is not only a magical nanny who achieves ""Super Nanny"" results without a ""naughty chair,"" but she is pretty effective in the matchmaking department, too. The romance involves two people who have been deeply hurt in their past and have not been able to let go. One needs to forgive a very devastating hurt caused knowingly by a loved one, the other needs to face the loss of a loved one and move on. They can each see the need in the other person's life, but can't recognize it in their own. I found the story of forgiveness to be very effectively portrayed and very moving.This holiday film was entertaining on the surface and meaningful on a deeper level. I appreciated that it was pretty family friendly--I can only recall one incident of profanity. There is some discord between the female lead and her family members as she works through her process of forgiving, but I felt it was a real portrayal of the struggle to forgive a life-changing offense. The ""magical"" aspect is not overplayed and adds to the ""Christmas"" feel. I've never read the book upon which it is based, but I would recommend this movie.",4,Fun family holiday film with a lesson in forgiveness,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,1825,"['movie', 'began', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'opening', 'movie', 'Nanny', 'Express', 'Nannies', 'are', 'coming', 'going', 'rapid', 'pace', 'unable', 'cope', 'two', 'rambunctious', 'kids', 'widowed', 'man', 'case', 'kids', 'are', 'twin', 'six-year-old', 'boys', 'who', 'need', 'role-model', 'not', 'playmate', 'father', 'according', 'one', 'departing', 'nanny', 'are', 'not', 'bratty', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'annoying', 'watch', 'are', 'just', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'lacked', 'good', 'parenting', 'need', 'guidance.The', 'storyline', 'been', 'very', 'thoroughly', 'covered', 'previous', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'there', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'name', 'really', 'Mrs.', 'Merkle', 'twins', 'keep', 'getting', 'wrong', 'played', 'delightfully', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'not', 'only', 'magical', 'nanny', 'who', 'Super', 'Nanny', 'results', 'naughty', 'chair', 'pretty', 'effective', 'matchmaking', 'department', 'too', 'romance', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'past', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'let', 'go', 'One', 'forgive', 'very', 'devastating', 'hurt', 'caused', 'knowingly', 'loved', 'one', 'other', 'needs', 'face', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'move', 'can', 'see', 'need', 'other', 'person', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'own', 'found', 'story', 'forgiveness', 'be', 'very', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'very', 'moving.This', 'holiday', 'film', 'was', 'entertaining', 'surface', 'meaningful', 'deeper', 'level', 'appreciated', 'was', 'pretty', 'family', 'friendly', 'can', 'only', 'recall', 'one', 'incident', 'profanity', 'discord', 'female', 'lead', 'family', 'members', 'process', 'forgiving', 'felt', 'was', 'real', 'portrayal', 'struggle', 'forgive', 'life-changing', 'offense', 'magical', 'aspect', 'not', 'overplayed', 'Christmas', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

I liked the fact it was also about second chances,forgiveness, and setting priorities straight.Like me, perhaps others will enjoying seeing Doris Roberts in this role (the angel).

It would be without a doubt the highlight of my last Christmas viewing involving as it does a wonderful fantasy tale within a romantic theme. Playing the central character of the mysterious ""Mrs Merkle' who seemingly appears out of nowhere to affect the lives of all the other characters, Doris Roberts is wonderful and the very core of this story. Roberts is fast becoming the ""Queen of Christmas themed movies"" due to her involvement in so many Christmas themed films and television episodes including the classic ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" right through this current film and its followup ""Call Me Mrs Miracle"". The two romantic leads played by James Van Der Beek as Seth the emotionally injured widower and father of two young twin boys, and Erin Karphik as Reba who is a young woman equally bruised by life's expereinces. Both are terrific in their respective roles and I found James Van Der Beek a real standout as the father who is still grieving the loss of his wife and who cannot move on with his life. I found he has developed immensely from his early days on ""Dawson's Creek"" and I'm now a fan due to his work here.""Mrs Miracle"" written by award winning authoress Debbie Macomber I feel is a standout from the many Christmas themed movies produced each year. I especially liked the whole mystery element to the story about who actually Mrs Miracle (as the twins call her) is and where she comes from. All the elements of the story come together beautifully and the story has equal elements of humour, sadness, human conflict and touching romance. The overall message delivered that forgiveness is the first step towards emotional recovery is one that is applicable for any time but especially so for the Christmas season. I highly recommend ""Mrs Miracle"" and I know I will be looking forward to checking out the follow up film ""Call Me Mrs Miracle"" which again stars Doris Roberts in the lead character but with a different supporting cast,this coming Christmas.
