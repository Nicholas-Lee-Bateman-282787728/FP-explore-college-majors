552298,A2S9PZCNEJEF3Y,B00004UD5U,Hugo,"[88, 93]","I was inspired to write this review about the DVD releases on the classic Flip Wilson Show because several &quot;reviewers&quot; have written negative remarks. First of all, let it be known for the record that the Late Flip Wilson himself acquired the &quot;rights&quot; to his hour long comedy-variety show[episodes]from NBC back in the early 1990's and he set about editing them down to half hour episodes. His plan was to include the HIGHLIGHTS from each program within a half hour format. Eventually, after several years of hard work, cable's TV LAND aired his wonderfully edited episodes. The man was a comic genius! His characters, most notably &quot;Geraldine Jones&quot;, were spectacular individuals who strangely enough developed &quot;lives&quot; of their own in our nation's Pop Culture, becoming massively popular &amp; famous &quot;in their own right&quot;. Who could ever forget that incredibly funny and true life-like character &quot;Geraldine&quot;?! That chick really had it going on and was a riot to boot! Anyway, releases on VHS were issued in single volumes[volume 1/volume 2 and so forth]with each tape including two episode &quot;featurettes&quot;...thus, on DVD a single disc will contain the equal to two VHS releases or 4 &quot;featurettes&quot; plus a &quot;bonus&quot; episode because of the expanded format on disc. THE FLIP WILSON SHOW has been issued by Rhino Video in superb video/sound quality, and three decades later, FLIP WILSON's universal brand of comedy has definitely withstood the test of time and remains extremely funny, charming and quite entertaining. Each disc is a goldmine full of laughter and entertainment; &quot;Geraldine's&quot; skits are truly the ultimate best!

While all of the bits are good - and while it was great to see Flip in his various characters cavorting with his guest stars - I purchased this DVD primarily for the appearance by the Osmond Brothers singing 'Yo-Yo.'  They had only recently left 'The Andy Williams Show' and ventured out on their own.  In tune with the times, they had grew their hair long and this performance is, I think, their most exciting televised ever.  It's something I distinctly remembered way back when...!
