954269,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B000C1VB8M,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[5, 5]","""The Best of Youth"" is a six-hour mini-series that follows the fortunes of an Italian family from the 1960s almost to the present. It is an amazing experience for the viewer. It's like a cinematographic version of ""War and Peace"" with a lovely, slow, thoughtful and ultimately moving love story at its heart.The movie is based around the experiences of two brothers who go through a seminal experience together when they are young students and react in very different ways. One joins the army and then the police; the other becomes a child psychiatrist. We also meet their friends, an economist and a builder.As the lens widens, we are drawn into a loving family circle. Every character is so precisely etched we feel we know them -- the speculator father, teacher mother, two sisters...I have to add here that the acting is uniformly superb. The music that accompanies the action is also brilliant and of course the photography and depiction of Italy are stunning.I'm not Italian so some of the events they live through don't have the same resonance for me -- the threat of the Red Brigades who engaged in urban terrorism for example.Here is a group of people who live through tragedy and yet survive. I was tremendously struck by the general attitude of the movie -- compassionate, understanding and yet it takes a clear moral stance. These aren't heroes -- just ordinary people doing their best. Not all of them succeed -- there are some tragic failures here -- but most perservere, working through the bad times to celebrate the good.This is a wonderful, wonderful movie. You'll laugh, you'll cry.

I have taken on an almost messianic role in sharing the beauty that is this film. I've rented it at the video store and lent it to family, colleagues and friends. I've watched it alone, and then was compelled to watch it again with my wife. I still struggle to understand why this film is so beautiful, moving and engaging. I can only say that it is all those things and more. I have no doubt that the haunting soundtrack, and the notes of Astor Piazzolla's 'Oblivion' in particular, contibute to the film's impact; in fact the use of music in this film (as is the case in most Italian cinematic productions) is very well done. I thought that the film affected me in a particular way because I was born in the very same period that the film begins, and so I have witnessed most of the film's historical background events, right down to a drive in an green Alfa Romeo Giulia ti (makes an appearance in the film), which was the first car I remember being my father driving. However, I have heard and witnessed people having no such direct experiences, not speaking Italian for that matter, being just as moved as I was by this film. It must be the exceptional and intelligent dialogue. Brilliant insights that apply to everyone, without being pedantic or critical. It is the photography (in spite of TV budget meakeup, but really, who cares when the rest is so good?, the scenery, and perhaps the personal humanity of the actors themesleves, Luigi lo Cascio 'in primis' who can be so funny at the most unexpected moments. In fact, I feel sorry for non-Italian speakers who miss the comic - but well timed and executed - intonations of various Italian accents by Lo Cascio's character, Nicola Carati. He also gets the most memorable lines. two of the best occur when a sarcastic Nicola criticizes Giulia's emerging political fanaticism and then in a quiet chat with his daughter, when he tells her that it is important to be generous when life is treating you well. I'm writing thsi review, and I should be working, so I have not dealt with the subject to the extent I wanted; however, I hope that I conveyed my enthusiasm for this film, a film that has affected me like no other. teh one regret is that after seeing this film, nothing else will move you as much and most films even good ones will leave you longing for the mix of emotions that only 'The Best of Youth' can offer.

It's a long long story of an Italian family that will lead you from the 1960s to our days through their personal vicissitudes. It's a story about Italy, about history, about family, love, fatherhood and moderhoods, about friendship, about a beautiful beautiful place that yes is full of troubles but is not just a ""beautiful and useless country"", as one of the many splendid cameo characters declares towards the beginning of the movie (and how could something beautiful be useless anyway?).This is melodrama at its best. It is intelligent, sad, sometimes tragic, sometimes truly fun and comic (a little bit of the comicity may be missed if you are not Italian, because some of the characters often joke using exaggerated regional accents that may not be easy to identify for a foreigner). Actors are good, at times great, at times a bit overacting, but who cares, the story is so absorbing, and many of the characters are so lovable that you really would like to jump into the movie and talk to them, help them out. Nicola, one of the two brothers who are the central characters of the movie is such a sensitive, intelligent and courageous individual that you can't help wishing him well.Once you decide to watch this movie, set aside a whole long long evening with your family or friends, because you will want to watch it all, and it's a long six hours that will fly away, and it will leave probably a bit sad at the end, like when you finish a book that you loved.I don't know, maybe it's also because because I am Italian, but this movie really moved me, and made me want to take a plane and go back to my country right away, to hug my mom and dad, to lose myself in the Tuscan countryside, to gather at a house in the hills, and sit at a table in the garden eating and drinking with my spendid childhood friends, who are no less splendid that this movie's characters.",5,A beautiful and moving melodrama,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,1899,"['movie', 'such', 'gem', 'long', 'long', 'story', 'Italian', 'family', 'will', 'lead', '1960s', 'days', 'personal', 'vicissitudes', 'story', 'Italy', 'about', 'history', 'family', 'love', 'fatherhood', 'moderhoods', 'friendship', 'beautiful', 'beautiful', 'place', 'yes', 'full', 'troubles', 'not', 'just', 'beautiful', 'useless', 'country', 'one', 'many', 'splendid', 'cameo', 'characters', 'beginning', 'movie', 'how', 'could', 'something', 'beautiful', 'be', 'useless', 'anyway', '.This', 'melodrama', 'best', 'intelligent', 'sad', 'sometimes', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'truly', 'fun', 'comic', 'little', 'bit', 'comicity', 'may', 'be', 'missed', 'are', 'not', 'Italian', 'characters', 'often', 'joke', 'using', 'exaggerated', 'regional', 'accents', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'identify', 'foreigner', 'Actors', 'are', 'good', 'times', 'great', 'times', 'bit', 'overacting', 'who', 'story', 'so', 'absorbing', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'lovable', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'jump', 'movie', 'talk', 'help', 'out', 'Nicola', 'one', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'movie', 'such', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'courageous', 'individual', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wishing', 'well.Once', 'decide', 'watch', 'movie', 'set', 'aside', 'whole', 'long', 'long', 'evening', 'family', 'friends', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'long', 'six', 'hours', 'will', 'fly', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'probably', 'bit', 'sad', 'end', 'when', 'finish', 'book', 'loved.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'also', 'am', 'Italian', 'movie', 'really', 'moved', 'made', 'want', 'take', 'plane', 'go', 'back', 'country', 'right', 'away', 'hug', 'mom', 'dad', 'lose', 'Tuscan', 'countryside', 'gather', 'house', 'hills', 'sit', 'table', 'garden', 'eating', 'drinking', 'spendid', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'splendid', 'movie', 'characters']",The Best Of Youth
954274,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000C1VB8M,Andrew Raker,"[3, 5]","I watched this film in my Political Science 226 Government and Politics of Western Europe class. While I felt the film was interesting and mirrored some of the problems that Italy faced in the 1980s during the Craxi years of government (1983-1987), it appeared to me that the film ended on a too positive note. (There is no discussion on the corruption of the Berlusconi administration.)Also, while I think the artistic direction of the film was relatively believable, it seemed to push Andrea's character into adulthood too quickly for no apparent reason. Additionally, Giorgia's character simply disappears after being released from the mental hospital and back into society.I am not trying to criticize the film. It was not horrible. In fact, Nicola and Matteo (two brothers) are both interesting - seeing how each attempts to deal with the corruption in Italy. Nicola works within the system (becomes a doctor and tries to reform the mental health industry, and Matteo tries to join a part of a larger group such as the military and then civilian law-enforcement, in the hope of making a difference.Nicola's girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Sara, believes that change can only be achieved through violence, while Nicola's mother believes education is the future.Therefore, in the interactions of these characters - following the journey of members of one Italian family - the viewer will receive a larger picture of Italy. However, it will not be a full picture or a completely accurate one. Poverty is really not shown in this film. In fact, after about 1988, the film begins to move at a very rapid pace, ignoring the development of the Northern League and the collapse of the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties.In short:The film is certainly worth watching - it may even be worth purchasing if you are an afficiando. However, I do not think the film conveys the culture and political situation in Italy as well as Dickens' ""Bleak House"" (1986 or 2006 adaptation) conveyed the political and cultural situation of mid-19th century England.",4,"An interesting view, yet not a tour de force...",1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,2056,"['watched', 'film', 'Political', 'Science', '226', 'Government', 'Politics', 'Western', 'Europe', 'class', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'mirrored', 'problems', 'Italy', 'faced', '1980s', 'Craxi', 'years', 'government', '1983-1987', 'appeared', 'film', 'ended', 'too', 'positive', 'note', 'discussion', 'corruption', 'Berlusconi', 'administration', 'Also', 'think', 'artistic', 'direction', 'film', 'was', 'relatively', 'believable', 'seemed', 'push', 'Andrea', 'character', 'adulthood', 'too', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Additionally', 'Giorgia', 'character', 'simply', 'being', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'back', 'society.I', 'am', 'not', 'trying', 'criticize', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'horrible', 'fact', 'Nicola', 'Matteo', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'how', 'attempts', 'deal', 'corruption', 'Italy', 'Nicola', 'system', 'doctor', 'tries', 'reform', 'mental', 'health', 'industry', 'Matteo', 'tries', 'join', 'part', 'larger', 'group', 'such', 'military', 'then', 'civilian', 'law-enforcement', 'hope', 'making', 'difference.Nicola', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Sara', 'change', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'achieved', 'violence', 'Nicola', 'mother', 'education', 'future.Therefore', 'interactions', 'characters', 'following', 'journey', 'members', 'one', 'Italian', 'family', 'viewer', 'will', 'receive', 'larger', 'picture', 'Italy', 'However', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'full', 'picture', 'completely', 'accurate', 'one', 'Poverty', 'really', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'fact', '1988', 'film', 'move', 'very', 'rapid', 'pace', 'ignoring', 'development', 'Northern', 'League', 'collapse', 'Christian', 'Democrat', 'Socialist', 'parties.In', 'short', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'are', 'afficiando', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'film', 'conveys', 'culture', 'political', 'situation', 'Italy', 'as', 'well', 'Dickens', 'Bleak', 'House', '1986', '2006', 'adaptation', 'conveyed', 'political', 'cultural', 'situation', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'England']",The Best Of Youth

In the end, one feels privileged to have followed its characters through the course of their lives. And along the way, we get to see the cultural and political changes that Italy goes through as well. It is a profoundly moving experience.The series doesn't follow a traditional storyline, but rather follows the ups and downs of two brothers (Matteo and Nicola). And there will be ambiguity, for in the end, Matteo remains an introverted mystery. Is his self-loathing born from his inability to make a difference in his tumultuous Italian world? Or is it an imbalance that his psychiatrist brother Nicola could help him out with? (Speaking of Nicola, he is brilliantly played by a likable Luigi Lo Cascio. Bravo.)Kudos to director Marco Tullio Giordana for not taking the obvious path with the story. For example, the mentally ill and beautiful Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca) does not take part in the improbable romance one would get in an inferior film. Instead, she fights her own conflicts of instability and independence and reflects the problems and evolution of Italy's health care system.

I'm glad I invested myself in the film when it was played in two parts at a local theater this summer. Director Marco Tullio Giordana's epic is six hours long, but attending the film was an incredibly moving and special experience. It's the story of two very different brothers, Nicola and Matteo, and how their family coped with the last 40 years of social, personal and political upheaval in Italy. The lead actors, Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni, each give powerful and believeable performances as their characters mature over 40 years. The scope of this film's story is gigantic, filled with fascinating, well-defined characters, and it never steps wrong. It has marvelous actors, a great script and beautiful cinematography. Most of my favorite movies this year featured some big quest or journey, an attempt to discover something new or find a way to grow, and THE BEST OF YOUTH featured the grandest journeys, the most interesting people, the most beautiful sites, the deepest tragedies and the most fulfilling discoveries.

If this movie/miniseries had been around when I was the age of the Carnati offspring in the 60s, I might have lived my life very differently.  It doesn't try to explain why the world is as it is.I could rapsodized about the seamless acting, directing, writing, and photography, but what would that mean? Nor will I comment on any imperfections of this production because it swept me off my feet and embraced me with all its characters. There was no time to nitpick. Edmond Rostand or Steve Martin wrote - why sip from a teacup when you can drink from the river?-- This movie is a river of life. Do you need to review how a river runs?It is so spiritoso that you will pick up Italian.  It is so thoughtful that you will question whether you have to come back to the U.S. - I mean in front of your monitor.  It will point out that our elders heard castanets in their time and may have learned some wisdom about life and our partners we should learn too. We need to open our minds and listen. What it says about love and the lack of it is a lot by just telling a good long story.It is wonderful to see a European movie that sees women more complex than the mama or the troubled, nude femme fatale that gets the menfolk all worked up. It is refreshing how men can be portrayed as being invested in making things better through a regular life than having to kamakazi into eachother or sexual partners. Good people in the troubled spots in the world can ask each other, -- Are you happy? Don't you feel generous?.

954286,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000C1VB8M,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","The concept of an intimate, six-hour epic is an improbable one, but director Marco Tullio Giordana has pulled off quite a feat with this marathon, 366-minute film, which is divided into two three-hour parts over two discs. Originally a miniseries on Italian TV (which explains the structural similarities with old American miniseries like ""Rich Man, Poor Man""), it's a masterful work with emotional pull, rich characterizations and plot nuances spanning close to forty years from 1966 to the present day. Ostensibly, the story revolves around the Carati brothers - self-righteous Matteo and optimistic Nicola, inseparable at the outset of the story as they attempt to leave Rome on a backpacking holiday in Norway. More importantly, what the movie does is humanize Italy's recent history on a more personal level. Giordana's most glorious accomplishment is how he keeps the story so emotionally involving over its lengthy duration.The expansive, shrewdly observed script by Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli covers major historical incidents such as the 1966 flooding of Florence, the ongoing terrorism instigated by the Red Brigades, revolutionary mental asylum reforms, and various World Cup championships. There is no bulky exposition to these events, but frankly, an in-depth knowledge of 20th century Italian history is not a prerequisite to enjoy the human drama coursing through the story. Each brother experiences his share of trials, and the beauty is that they remain life-sized, not epic in scale, which brings further resonance to the broader events affecting their lives. What triggers the drama of the plot is Giorgia, a near-catatonic victim of botched electroshock treatments, whom Matteo tries to reunite with her father. Unfortunately, this act of goodwill backfires, and the brothers decide to take different routes. In vivid brushstrokes, Matteo joins the army and later works for the police, first in Sicily and then back in Rome. Nicola, on the other hand, ends up going to Norway alone; comes back to Florence to help with the flood victims; marries Giulia, a conflicted protestor; raises a precocious daughter; and builds a career as a well-respected psychotherapist helping the mentally ill disenfranchised. The brothers' lives intertwine throughout to the point where one seems to be fulfilling the failed destiny of the other.The cast is superb starting with the two stellar leads. Alessio Boni brings a charismatic blend of passionate intensity and veiled vulnerability as Matteo, illuminating an increasingly tortured soul as he further isolates himself from those closest to him. Bearing a striking resemblance to actor Rob Morrow, Luigi Lo Cascio plays the more open-hearted Nicola with dexterity, unafraid to reveal his character's inability to empathize with the deep anguish of those around him. Many of the supporting players are equally wonderful, with particular standouts being Andrea Tidona as the brothers' crafty father; Maya Sansa as the sympathetic photographer/librarian Mirella; Fabrizio Gifuni as dedicated lifelong friend Carlo; Lidia Vitale as the brothers' tough-minded sister Giovanna, who becomes an influential judge; and best of all, Adriana Asti as the brothers' put-upon mother. She has a particularly amazing scene of visceral power outside of Matteo's apartment. In pivotal roles, Jasmine Trinca does what she can as Giorgia, though I tend to think her character is designed more as a plot device to bring the brothers together; and with her excessive facial expressions, Sonia Bergamasco somewhat overplays the mercurial role of Giulia given her character's lightning-flash changes from lover to mother to revolutionary and back again.One area that is a bit lacking is Roberto Forza's cinematography, which I find a bit washed out perhaps because the film was made for television. Perhaps futilely, I was hoping for more of a David Lean-like quality to the imagery. Interestingly, the soundtrack is filled with period-correct American pop at the beginning when the boys are young but moves to strictly Italian music as they become older. Thankfully there is little attempt to use make-up to age the actors over the decades other than some gray streaks in Nicola's hair. The almost final scene with Nicola and Mirella walking in the woods is among the most touching I have seen in a movie. This represents vital, full-blooded cinema worthy of comparison to Bertolucci and Ozu in terms of the human scale it showcases. The two-disc set has no extras given the epic length of the film.",5,Sit a Spell...This Is Six Unforgettable Hours of Superb Character-Driven Cinema,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,4541,"['concept', 'intimate', 'six-hour', 'epic', 'improbable', 'one', 'director', 'Marco', 'Tullio', 'Giordana', 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'feat', 'marathon', '366-minute', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'three-hour', 'parts', 'two', 'discs', 'Originally', 'miniseries', 'Italian', 'TV', 'structural', 'similarities', 'old', 'American', 'miniseries', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'masterful', 'work', 'emotional', 'pull', 'rich', 'characterizations', 'plot', 'nuances', 'spanning', 'close', 'forty', 'years', '1966', 'present', 'day', 'Ostensibly', 'story', 'Carati', 'brothers', 'self-righteous', 'Matteo', 'optimistic', 'Nicola', 'inseparable', 'outset', 'story', 'attempt', 'leave', 'Rome', 'backpacking', 'holiday', 'Norway', 'More', 'importantly', 'what', 'movie', 'humanize', 'Italy', 'recent', 'history', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'Giordana', 'most', 'glorious', 'accomplishment', 'how', 'story', 'so', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'over', 'lengthy', 'duration.The', 'expansive', 'shrewdly', 'observed', 'script', 'Sandro', 'Petraglia', 'Stefano', 'Rulli', 'major', 'historical', 'incidents', 'such', '1966', 'flooding', 'Florence', 'ongoing', 'terrorism', 'instigated', 'Red', 'Brigades', 'revolutionary', 'mental', 'asylum', 'reforms', 'various', 'World', 'Cup', 'championships', 'bulky', 'exposition', 'events', 'frankly', 'in-depth', 'knowledge', '20th', 'century', 'Italian', 'history', 'not', 'prerequisite', 'enjoy', 'human', 'drama', 'coursing', 'story', 'brother', 'share', 'trials', 'beauty', 'remain', 'life-sized', 'not', 'epic', 'scale', 'further', 'resonance', 'broader', 'events', 'affecting', 'lives', 'What', 'drama', 'plot', 'Giorgia', 'near-catatonic', 'victim', 'botched', 'electroshock', 'treatments', 'whom', 'Matteo', 'reunite', 'father', 'Unfortunately', 'act', 'goodwill', 'backfires', 'brothers', 'decide', 'take', 'different', 'routes', 'vivid', 'brushstrokes', 'Matteo', 'army', 'later', 'works', 'police', 'first', 'Sicily', 'then', 'back', 'Rome', 'Nicola', 'other', 'hand', 'up', 'going', 'Norway', 'alone', 'back', 'Florence', 'help', 'flood', 'victims', 'marries', 'Giulia', 'conflicted', 'protestor', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'career', 'well-respected', 'psychotherapist', 'helping', 'mentally', 'ill', 'disenfranchised', 'brothers', 'lives', 'intertwine', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'be', 'fulfilling', 'failed', 'destiny', 'other.The', 'cast', 'superb', 'starting', 'two', 'stellar', 'leads', 'Alessio', 'Boni', 'charismatic', 'blend', 'passionate', 'intensity', 'veiled', 'vulnerability', 'Matteo', 'illuminating', 'increasingly', 'tortured', 'soul', 'isolates', 'closest', 'Bearing', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'actor', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'Luigi', 'Lo', 'Cascio', 'more', 'open-hearted', 'Nicola', 'dexterity', 'unafraid', 'reveal', 'character', 'inability', 'empathize', 'deep', 'anguish', 'Many', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'particular', 'standouts', 'being', 'Andrea', 'Tidona', 'brothers', 'crafty', 'father', 'Maya', 'Sansa', 'sympathetic', 'photographer/librarian', 'Mirella', 'Fabrizio', 'Gifuni', 'dedicated', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Carlo', 'Lidia', 'Vitale', 'brothers', 'tough-minded', 'sister', 'Giovanna', 'who', 'influential', 'judge', 'best', 'Adriana', 'Asti', 'brothers', 'put-upon', 'mother', 'particularly', 'amazing', 'scene', 'visceral', 'power', 'Matteo', 'apartment', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'Jasmine', 'Trinca', 'what', 'can', 'Giorgia', 'tend', 'think', 'character', 'designed', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'bring', 'brothers', 'together', 'excessive', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Sonia', 'Bergamasco', 'somewhat', 'mercurial', 'role', 'Giulia', 'given', 'character', 'lightning-flash', 'changes', 'lover', 'mother', 'revolutionary', 'back', 'again.One', 'area', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Roberto', 'Forza', 'cinematography', 'find', 'bit', 'washed', 'out', 'perhaps', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'Perhaps', 'futilely', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'David', 'Lean-like', 'quality', 'imagery', 'Interestingly', 'soundtrack', 'filled', 'period-correct', 'American', 'pop', 'beginning', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'young', 'strictly', 'Italian', 'music', 'become', 'older', 'Thankfully', 'little', 'attempt', 'use', 'make-up', 'age', 'actors', 'decades', 'other', 'gray', 'streaks', 'Nicola', 'hair', 'almost', 'final', 'scene', 'Nicola', 'Mirella', 'walking', 'woods', 'most', 'touching', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'vital', 'full-blooded', 'cinema', 'worthy', 'comparison', 'Bertolucci', 'Ozu', 'terms', 'human', 'scale', 'two-disc', 'set', 'extras', 'given', 'epic', 'length', 'film']",The Best Of Youth

Sounds a bit plain, doesn't it?The Best of Youth, though, is anything but plain and boring. It tells the story of a family in Italy from the 1960's all the way into the year 2000. As you can imagine, alot happens in 40 years: floods, riots, people die, are born, part ways, meet new friends and so forth.But what really drew me into this 6 hour masterpiece were the characters. There are no heroes, there are no anti-heroes--just people, like you and me. The story of Matteo and Nicola could be any one of us.Speaking of characters, I haven't been this attached to the characters since I last watched an episode of Friends. The actors  don't play their parts, they ARE their parts. If I saw the actor who played Matteo on the streets of Italy, I would be like, ""Hey, it's Matteo!"" The acting was THAT good. You'll go through a full spectrum of emotions with them throughout the course of this film.As for the pace of the movie, it takes a while to get to know the characters, the setting, but after about an hour you'll feel comfortable with it all. The plot twists are scattered and generously spaced, making them happen at just the right moment without feeling forced. I have to admit that some of the plot twists may not be anything new or innovative (alot of the plot twists you could see on any given day on a Soap Opera), but the whole of the movie is so well done you won't be able to care less. There are so many powerful and moving scenes in this movie--I'd love to tell them to you, but then I'd ruin your experience, wouldn't I?I can tell you one I liked, though:There is a scene in this movie where one of the characters says, ""I don't believe in exclamation points.""

954290,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B000C1VB8M,e. verrillo,"[1, 2]","It's good to remember while watching this six-hour marathon that, in Italy, life is like opera. In this version, they fight, they cry, they suffer, they die, you cry ... you don't know why. There was remarkably little singing.Basically, this is one of those long family sagas, sort of like The Forsyte Saga - with hugging. It touches on the history of the times - riots, Red Party terrorism, the mafia - and interweaves it all within the fates of two brothers, and, peripherally, the sisters, of the Carati family. Loosely, the story begins with the brothers and two of their friends planning a trip together. One of the brothers, the troubled and unpredictable Matteo, is an orderly at a mental hospital and, witnessing the mistreatment of a beautiful young girl, Giorgia, decides to free her. This is the pivotal event that changes all their lives. Giorgia is sent back to the hospital, Matteo joins the army (we never find out why), Nicola becomes a psychiatrist, the friends become a banker and a construction worker. Babies are born and coddled mercilessly. They all kiss on both cheeks and weep. (Again, not British.)Although I was fairly bored during the first part of this series, things picked up for me when they got into the rights of mental patients. There was a very moving trial scene that got me to sit up and pay attention. I wish they had done more with that theme. I also - and this pains me to say it - got really involved with the characters and had to move a box of tissues into the living room to make it through the second half. (OK, so I'm Italian. You gotta problem with that?)The scenery, of course, was stunning.

It follows the protagonists----two brothers and their friends----over a period of forty years, from the late sixties to the year 2000. The story, which begins and ends with a journey,  takes the viewer on an odyssey that covers the length of Italy and Sicily and is played out against the background of some of the most turbulent events that shook that nation during the late twentieth century: revelations about the scandalous treatment of the mentally ill; the flood in Florence; the Red Brigade terrorists; Tangentopoli (Payola in High Places); and the horrendous judicial assassinations in Sicily by the Mafia.The film, however, is no downer. One comes to care deeply for all the characters, laughing and crying with them.

954293,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000C1VB8M,Grady Harp,"[8, 8]","La Meglio giovent&ugrave; (THE BEST OF YOUTH) is a spellbinding drama that sweeps the viewer through Italian history from 1966 through 2003 as distilled in the lives of one family. Writers Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli have created a screenplay that is both informative to those of us who did not live this period in Italian political disturbance and simultaneously passionate in the creation of a group of people surrounding two brothers who propel the story with heartrending power.Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) are brothers in Rome in the Carati family - mother Adriana (Adriana Asti), father Angelo (Andrea Tidona) and sisters Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti) and Giovanna (Lidia Vitale). Nicola and Matteo are devoted to each other despite their polarity of differences in personalities and beliefs. With their childhood friends Carlo (Fabrizio Gifuni) and Vitale (Claudio Gio&egrave;) they begin their an adventure of travel to the northern regions of the globe, but Nicola and Matteo encounter and rescue a young abused girl Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca) who is confined in an asylum, a pause for humanity reasons that alters their lives forever. Matteo joins the military and then the police force while Nicola travels to Norway to work as a hippie laborer. He returns to Italy after the flood of Florence, and meets Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco) a talented piano player who sympathizes with the Red Brigade of socialism. Matteo, as an angry rebel spirit travels to Sicily where he encounters and encourages photographer Mirella (Maya Sansa). Due in part to his devotion to Giorgia's plight, Nicola becomes a psychiatrist. These four main characters then are the keys to the story which lives through the myriad terrorist political upheavals in Italy during that forty year period but also demonstrate the profound effect that family and friendship have on shaping the destinies of all concerned.Of course the story is far richer than this brief synopsis (the film is after all over six hours long!) and it is conducted like a symphony by the gifted director Marco Tullio Giordana. Originally screened as a television miniseries in Italy, the six hourly episodes are seamlessly joined for the award winning theatrical release and the result the film is a drama that stirs every emotion in the human spirit. It boasts brilliant cinematography by Roberto Forza and a musical score that is fine pastiche of works by Bach, Georges Delerue, Mozart, Astor Piazzolla, and Giovanni Sollima. The cast succeeds in brandishing talent so deeply embedded in their characters that each becomes part of the viewers' psyche. This is a stunning film, one that once seen will probably find its way into the permanent film libraries of those who appreciate great cinematic art. An exceptional visual and emotional experience.

Truth to be told, this is the kind of great opportunity you simply have to take advantage of.Why? Because this miniseries entertains, but also allows you to witness some of the things that happened in Italy in the last 50 years, from the point of view of two Italian brothers, Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) Carati. They are both very different, but thanks to them, their friends and girlfriends we can at the very least have a notion of what happened in Italy during those years. Mafia, floods, terrorism (the Red Brigades), corruption, yes, but also the transformation of two young men from starry eyed teenagers to adults that struggle with reality and its challenges, and find different paths in their lives.All in all, I can say that I loved this miniseries.

With most films, that would be a criticism, but in this case it is a signal of what is distinctive and wonderful about this film -- easily one of the most worthwhile and compelling fictions ever created for the big screen.  After about an hour and a half I was completely hooked and there was no chance I wasn't going to stay and watch both parts of this six-hour film, which is by turns touching, comic, and devastating.  (It is not, by the way, that the first hour and a half are slow, but that they are designed to give you time to get to know the characters -- rest assured that the film is never boring -- unless the very idea of a subtitled film about people from another country bores you.)  Liberated from the need to tell their story in a two or three hour scope, the filmmakers opted to make it not so much about a single event or action that affects the lives of a few people but about the people themselves as their lives unfold in complex and unpredictable ways in connection with the events taking place in Italy and in their families over a period of three decades: a wonderful cast of characters played by remarkable actors who show them convincingly aging and changing over the course of about thirty years.  We have time to get to know them, and care about them as people, to the point where they become like family.  It is hard to credit before watching this film the claims by numerous critics that after six hours they didn't want it to be over -- but in my case at the end I absolutely agreed.  Though it is not strictly speaking necessary and the film already comes to a perfect conclusion -- and is probably impossible, given that the film ends in the year 2000 -- I found myself wishing there were a third part.  In that sense, it is closer to television or to the novel than to most films.  It is also close to television in its intimacy, told as it is mostly through closeups -- but it is wonderful to see that intimate attention to detail brought to life on the big screen.  Still, for its scope and grandeur and power, and for its ability to connect intimate details to issues of extremely wide scope both historical and contemporary, it is very much a cinematic epic.  There are a few moments that test the credibility of the audience -- but somehow it all works to give the kind of enjoyable and moving experience that we often seek but rarely find in the cinema.  Definitely a film to see in the theaters if you get lucky enough to have the chance (Miramax has done a very poor job distributing this: holding on to it for a couple of years and then not knowing what to do with it and getting it out to only a few theaters: now it is running the College film festival circuit, so keep an eye out for it there; I got the chance to see it only because I brought it to the film series I run in Saint Petersburg, FL), but it is definitely a must when it comes out on DVD in February.",5,Unique and unforgettable: film as novel,1134172800,"12 10, 2005",2005,3020,"['time', 'get', 'story', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'criticism', 'case', 'signal', 'what', 'distinctive', 'wonderful', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'compelling', 'fictions', 'ever', 'created', 'big', 'screen', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'was', 'chance', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'stay', 'watch', 'parts', 'six-hour', 'film', 'turns', 'touching', 'comic', 'devastating', 'not', 'way', 'first', 'hour', 'half', 'are', 'slow', 'are', 'designed', 'give', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'rest', 'assured', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'very', 'idea', 'subtitled', 'film', 'people', 'country', 'Liberated', 'need', 'tell', 'story', 'two', 'three', 'hour', 'scope', 'filmmakers', 'opted', 'make', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'single', 'event', 'action', 'lives', 'few', 'people', 'people', 'lives', 'unfold', 'complex', 'unpredictable', 'ways', 'connection', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Italy', 'families', 'period', 'three', 'decades', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'characters', 'played', 'remarkable', 'actors', 'who', 'show', 'convincingly', 'aging', 'changing', 'course', 'thirty', 'years', 'have', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'care', 'about', 'people', 'point', 'where', 'become', 'family', 'hard', 'credit', 'before', 'watching', 'film', 'claims', 'numerous', 'critics', 'six', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'case', 'end', 'absolutely', 'agreed', 'not', 'strictly', 'speaking', 'necessary', 'film', 'already', 'perfect', 'conclusion', 'probably', 'impossible', 'given', 'film', 'year', '2000', 'found', 'wishing', 'were', 'third', 'part', 'sense', 'closer', 'television', 'novel', 'most', 'films', 'also', 'close', 'television', 'intimacy', 'told', 'mostly', 'closeups', 'wonderful', 'see', 'intimate', 'attention', 'detail', 'brought', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'Still', 'scope', 'grandeur', 'power', 'ability', 'connect', 'intimate', 'details', 'issues', 'extremely', 'wide', 'scope', 'historical', 'contemporary', 'very', 'much', 'cinematic', 'epic', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'test', 'credibility', 'audience', 'somehow', 'give', 'kind', 'enjoyable', 'moving', 'experience', 'often', 'seek', 'rarely', 'find', 'cinema', 'Definitely', 'film', 'see', 'theaters', 'get', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'chance', 'Miramax', 'done', 'very', 'poor', 'job', 'distributing', 'holding', 'couple', 'years', 'then', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'getting', 'only', 'few', 'theaters', 'now', 'running', 'College', 'film', 'festival', 'circuit', 'so', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'only', 'brought', 'film', 'series', 'run', 'Saint', 'Petersburg', 'FL', 'definitely', 'must', 'when', 'out', 'DVD', 'February']",The Best Of Youth

954305,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000C1VB8M,Roland E. Zwick,"[9, 9]","****1/2Although it originally premiered as a miniseries on Italian television, ""The Best of Youth"" arrived in America in the form of a not particularly viewer-friendly, six-hour-plus, all-at-one-sitting theatrical release.  As one who loves movies but who can still acknowledge his limitations when it comes to sitting still for ungodly lengths of time, I really must take my hat off to all those hardy souls who rose to the challenge and went to see this film at their local bijous.  I'm not sure which I admire more: their physical and mental stamina or their phenomenal bladder control.  (For a bit of perspective, the film runs almost twice as long as ""Doctor Zhivago"" and a good two hours longer than ""Cleopatra,"" the lengthiest American film of all time).  Luckily, for the cinematic wimps among us, ""The Best of Youth"" has arrived in a format - namely, a two-disc DVD set - that is far more reasonable and sensible given the episodic nature of the material and our own limited attention spans.Reaching across no fewer than five turbulent decades - from the mid-1960's to the present day - the film focuses on two Italian brothers who are very different by nature but whose paths continually cross and overlap throughout the years.  The younger and less ""promising"" of the two, Nicola, starts off as something of a dewy-eyed idealist, determined to right the social wrongs he sees in the society around him.  To this end, he becomes a doctor dedicated to reforming the abusive mental health system in Italy at that time.  However, as he ages, he begins to see the dangers of unbridled radicalism and becomes gradually more pragmatic and accepting in his outlook on life.  His older brother, Matteo, despite his tremendous early promise in medical school, is a fiery-tempered loner who turns to police work as a profession, a move Nicola looks upon with bewilderment and disdain, seeing it as a betrayal of the free-spirited idealism Matteo espoused as a youth.  One of the better choices on the part of the writers, Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli, is keeping Matteo a largely enigmatic figure throughout the course of the story.  They never spell out exactly why Matteo is the way he is or what it is in his background that has led him to the choices he makes.  The reason why this is so effective is because we are as perplexed by his seemingly irrational behavior as are the loved ones who so often become the unwitting victims of it.  In addition to the two brothers, the authors and the director Marco Tullio Giordana fill their canvas with any number of rich and fascinating secondary characters, some of whom play major roles in the lives of Matteo and Nicola and some of whom play only minor ones.  Yet all are finely drawn and expertly enacted by a flawless cast.Although it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance, thematic depth, and ingenious creativity of a true miniseries masterpiece like ""Six Feet Under"" (though, at times, it comes close), ""The Best of Youth"" still offers much to hold the viewer's attention throughout its exhaustive (though never exhausting) length.  The film moves quickly, and it rarely goes for the obvious in its storytelling.  Indeed, it offers many unexpected plot turns and narrative surprises that keep the film from falling into a formulaic trap and that keep us wondering where it is all ultimately heading to.  In fact, the filmmakers often seem to be leading us in a particular direction with a particular character, only to throw up a detour and have us go in an entirely different direction entirely.  One of the few weaknesses of the film is that, while it touches on such subjects as civil unrest, governmental and corporate corruption, and underground terrorism, the script doesn't provide enough of an historical context (i.e. specific names and movements) to make it very informative for those of us who might like to know a few more of the details of recent Italian history.  But where it really counts - as a human drama filled with complex and fully realized individuals who make a mark on our hearts - the film delivers the goods and then some.Of course, one of the advantages that a work of this length has over the usual two or two-and-a-half-hour drama is that it can far more effectively convey the passing of time and the handing of the torch from one generation to another.  It also allows us to grow and change right along with the characters.  The final scenes of ""The Best of Youth"" are tremendously moving and exhilarating simply because we feel as if we have truly come to know these people as individuals and will miss them when they're gone.  The penultimate scene showing the need for the living to move on with their lives harkens back to that lovely and unforgettable final moment in ""Places in the Heart.""Naturally, special note must be taken of Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni who, as Nicola and Matteo, beautifully convey the subtle changes their characters go through as the years pass by.And, of course, all of this plays out against the backdrop of the rich Italian landscape, filled with ancient Roman ruins, Medieval art and architecture, and glorious vistas of the sparkling Mediterranean Sea.  As a travelogue alone, the film is worth seeing.Yes, ""The Best of Youth"" is long and time-consuming, but, as a viewer-friendly DVD, the length should no longer be an obstacle to one's enjoyment of the film.  Check it out and immerse yourself in the very special pleasures it has to offer.  You won't soon forget it.",4,long but engrossing epic,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,5510,"['originally', 'premiered', 'miniseries', 'Italian', 'television', 'Best', 'Youth', 'arrived', 'America',

954306,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B000C1VB8M,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[24, 25]","This six-hour made-for-TV movie is a drama about a middle class Italian family that covers over 35 years of modern Italian history. Its central characters are two brothers of different temperaments, whose lives take very different paths. The overall message of the film, that life is beautiful, is played out against beautifully photographed travelogue footage that ranges from Turin to Palermo, with side trips to Norway, and a cast of often strikingly photogenic performers. More important, the film's dramatic conflicts, which hold our interest over the length of six hours, include a political dimension as one of the many characters becomes involved in a radical leftist cell, whose mission is to target and assassinate members of the professional and academic elite. The film has been praised for its refusal to simply sensationalize its subject but to humanize all those affected (would-be assassin, potential victim, and police inspector) and represent them with some psychological truth rather than stereotyping them.During the course of the film, a new generation emerges to soften the harsher legacy of recent history and to demonstrate that if life is beautiful it is in its returning promise that the failures of the past need not discourage our hopes for the future. While all of the cast bring to life characters that are plausibly real, the performance of Alessio Boni as the darkly tormented brother Matteo is a standout. The music score ranges from pop music and jazz of the 1960s to haunting compositions by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. It's been a long while since we've seen really great cinema from Italy.

It's not bad, but I was expecting much more.  For a series that is only 4 1/2 hours long, it took us a long time (two months) to find the time to watch it.

The plot is often either pointless (for example, Giorgia's entire storyline) or cliched and derivative (e.g. surprise surprise, Nonna discovers she has a heretofore unknown grand-child, and thus finds a new purpose in life - shades of ""Indian Summer of a Forsyte"").  This may very well be the best Italian television series ever made, but that's not saying much.  Granted, it is better than ""Incantesimo"".At its best, it is a confirmation to me that Italy is really the best place to live on earth.  The depiction of Italian apartment life, the sort of furniture people have, is very accurate.  If you've ever thought having a lot of money and restoring a farmhouse in Tuscany would be fun, this series will indulge that fantasy. Hardcore Italophiles will surely want to watch this series, but don't expect anything as profound or sublime as ""Heimat"".",3,"It's not that good, really",1144627200,"04 10, 2006",2006,1732,"['Based', 'many', 'prior', 'reviews', 'had', 'seen', 'Amazon', 'had', 'expected', 'true', 'television', 'masterpiece', 'lines', '1967', 'version', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'German', 'series', 'Heimat', 'series', 'moderately', 'interesting', 'Italophiles', 'native', 'speakers', 'nowhere', 'near', 'fascinating', 'even', 'entertaining', 'two', 'series.I', ""'ve"", 'given', 'considerable', 'thought', '3', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'more', 'series', 'only', '4', '1/2', 'hours', 'long', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'two', 'months', 'find', 'time', 'watch', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'genuine', 'moments', 'lot', 'weekly', 'soap', 'operas', 'might', 'see', 'RAI', 'USA.I', 'got', 'impression', 'people', 'who', 'produced', 'Best', 'Youth', 'were', 'not', 'particularly', 'familiar', 'genre', 'well-versed', 'literature', 'plot', 'often', 'either', 'pointless', 'example', 'Giorgia', 'entire', 'storyline', 'cliched', 'derivative', 'e.g', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'Nonna', 'heretofore', 'unknown', 'grand-child', 'thus', 'new', 'purpose', 'life', 'shades', 'Indian', 'Summer', 'Forsyte', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'Italian', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'Granted', 'better', 'Incantesimo', 'best', 'confirmation', 'Italy', 'really', 'best', 'place', 'live', 'earth', 'depiction', 'Italian', 'apartment', 'life', 'sort', 'furniture', 'people', 'have', 'very', 'accurate', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'thought', 'having', 'lot', 'money', 'restoring', 'farmhouse', 'Tuscany', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'series', 'will', 'indulge', 'fantasy', 'Hardcore', 'Italophiles', 'will', 'surely', 'want', 'watch', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'profound', 'sublime', 'Heimat']",The Best Of Youth
954313,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000C1VB8M,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 4]","""The Best of Youth"" is a very moving, engaging, complete tale of the journey two brothers make and how these journeys affect and are affected by their family members.Part of the reason for the film's success is its length. The film is long. Very long. When it was released in theaters last summer, it played as two separate films, requiring admission for each. Originally made as a miniseries for Italian television, the film runs over 6 hours long. Watching this in a theater would require some fortitude, planning, investment, but watching it at home, on DVD, allows a more leisurely pace; you can watch a bit, take a break, watch a bit more, make some dinner, continue watching, maybe continue on the next night. Even though the film follows the lives of two brothers throughout, there are very distinct `chapters' to their lives, the one indication of the projects origins as a television miniseries. It retains some of its episodic quality, giving you good indications of when one subplot is winding down and when another will begin.Because of the length, we spend a lot of time with these characters; we feel we get to know them. At the end of the journey, I defy you to not have used at least one tissue, probably more. The combination of good acting, engaging storytelling and the film's duration allows us to get up close and personal with these people. As we follow their lives over the course of four decades, we witness the good and the bad events, and the bad will probably bring you to tears.We first meet Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni) in the early 60s. Each is about to take their exams at the University and will then go on an extended trip with their friends for the summer. That's the plan anyway. Matteo is studying literature, Nicola medicine. To earn some extra cash for the trip, Matteo takes a job at the local asylum; the job is to take Giorgia (Jasmine Trinca), a young woman, out for walks, fresh air, etc. Matteo soon realizes she is one of many patients who are receiving electroshock therapy and decides to take Giorgia back to her parents, in a remote Italian village. He enlists Nicola's reluctant help; they will make a quick detour and then rejoin their friends at a later stage. But this detour doesn't go as planned and their lives begin to move in different directions. This only scratches the surface of the events throughout the film, their lives take many divergent paths throughout, but it should give you a feel of the tone of the film.All of the actors are good. As we follow them over the course of decades, they don't seem to age much, with the exception of more gray hair. But that is beside the point; they mature, they act differently as humans, and they grow. Luigi Lo Cascio plays Nicola, the more level headed of the two brothers. Eventually, he becomes a psychiatrist, adding a level of understanding to his character. As he deals with problems, both in his life and others, he remains calm, collected and a little impassive, showing little emotion. When he does show emotion, we really feel these moments with him. His few and rare emotional outbursts signal to us that something serious is happening. Pay attention.Alessio Boni plays Matteo, the more emotional, eccentric brother. Matteo studies literature, but after a disastrous exam, decides to join the Army. Then the police. His jobs, and his nature, cause him to become emotionally distant, letting out his aggressions at the wrong times, causing him to get into trouble. Boni is a very striking actor. He has the charisma of a young Harrison Ford or Russell Crowe. In fact, in the right hands, I could see him making the leap to American films. He isn't the most handsome guy to ever grace the big screen, but the combination of his looks, charisma and acting make him almost mesmerizing to watch.Over the course of the film, many characters come and go and all of these are played very well. It would take too much space to list every character and actor, but they are all universally interesting and believable.The one false note in the film comes when one character joins the Red Brigade and then becomes an assassin. This part of the story is entirely too sensationalistic. Like it was included to make the story a little more suspenseful, a little more interesting, to garner more viewers. Perhaps this type of thing happened, but the rest of the film is about a large extended family. It doesn't fit and it doesn't work.""The Best of Youth"" takes an investment; in time and emotion, but the payoff is equal. You will be rewarded with an in-depth look into the lives and struggles of a large, extended family in Italy. Even better yet?
