902458,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00097C4BC,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[11, 13]","Carrie Konyha's Tribaret is a delight to learn from, as you find yourself slowly but surely learning and doing steps you thought were beyond you; this is because Carrie's method is measured and methodical, but never boring, and you learn the basics accurately, and shimmy by shimmy, isolation by isolation,  move to a more advanced grade. The mood is enhanced by the fabulous sections interspersed throughout showing how what you are learning is incorporated into a choreographed dance for performance.Viewing is made even easier by the aesthetic pleasure of watching Carrie, who is stunningly gorgeous, with sensuality and grace down to her little finger. From the warm-up to the cool-down, her personality and beauty make learning easier, and her teaching methods make sure you learn the right way from the start. The DVD is topped off with a fantastic performance in a knock-out red costume.The music on a teaching DVD is always important, and here you've got excellent music. Naked Rhythm, Mosano, Gizira Band, Louie, Knossos, and Petrol Bomb Samosa all add to the mix of good listening. Good clear photography, so that you don't miss a single move completes this DVD and makes it a great addition to your dance instruction library.

902459,A1ARPLFACHIK7Y,B00097C4BC,"apriles78 ""aes78""","[12, 12]","Tribaret is packed with cute bellydance moves that are a great addition for anyone who likes learning bellydance. This is not a workout DVD, but a DVD geared to teach you bellydance moves and combinations. It's more like a library of versatile moves.I would not classify this as something for beginners, since Carrie covers the moves quite quickly and does not drill them repeatedly with instruction, but goes directly to demonstration. But if you are a beginner, get this anyway because sooner or later you're going to want to learn these moves.I'm glad I decided to get this. I was hesitant at first because I prefer traditional bellydance to tribal, but after previewing this I decided it had folkloric influence. Folkloric is my favorite kind of dance, especially with any hops, skipping, and bouncing. I was not disappointed, because Carrie included quite a few folkloric moves that I can't wait to learn.This is definitely a 5-star product. You can tell that Carrie is a qualified instructor, not just a bellydancer who decided to put out a DVD. Her instruction is professional and straight forward. My only real complaint is the cameraman often would switch to a side view of what Carrie was doing and this was not at all helpful to someone who was trying to learn the combination of moves for the first time. I really wish these videographers would realize that filming instructional dance DVDs is different from filming other genres and the most important thing is to get a clear, consistent, and complete view of what the instructor is doing. Still, other than the side views, the cameraman did a good job of keeping all of Carrie in view, so you could see everything she was doing.",5,Enhance your bellydance repertoire,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,1692,"['Tribaret', 'packed', 'cute', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'are', 'great', 'addition', 'anyone', 'who', 'learning', 'bellydance', 'not', 'workout', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'geared', 'teach', 'bellydance', 'moves', 'combinations', 'more', 'library', 'versatile', 'moves.I', 'would', 'not', 'classify', 'something', 'beginners', 'Carrie', 'moves', 'quite', 'quickly', 'not', 'drill', 'repeatedly', 'instruction', 'directly', 'demonstration', 'are', 'beginner', 'get', 'anyway', 'sooner', 'later', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'learn', 'moves.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'get', 'was', 'hesitant', 'first', 'prefer', 'traditional', 'bellydance', 'tribal', 'previewing', 'decided', 'had', 'folkloric', 'influence', 'Folkloric', 'favorite', 'kind', 'dance', 'especially', 'hops', 'skipping', 'bouncing', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Carrie', 'included', 'quite', 'few', 'folkloric', 'moves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'learn.This', 'definitely', '5-star', 'product', 'can', 'tell', 'Carrie', 'qualified', 'instructor', 'not', 'just', 'bellydancer', 'who', 'decided', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'instruction', 'professional', 'straight', 'forward', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'cameraman', 'often', 'would', 'switch', 'side', 'view', 'what', 'Carrie', 'was', 'doing', 'was', 'not', 'helpful', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'learn', 'combination', 'moves', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'wish', 'videographers', 'would', 'realize', 'filming', 'instructional', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'different', 'filming', 'other', 'genres', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'get', 'clear', 'consistent', 'complete', 'view', 'what', 'instructor', 'doing', 'Still', 'other', 'side', 'views', 'cameraman', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'Carrie', 'view', 'could', 'see', 'everything', 'was', 'doing']","Tribaret Belly Dance with Carrie Konyha- Technique & Combinations for the Versatile Dancer: Bellydance instruction, Tribaret belly dance beginner classes, complete how-to"
902460,A36N93O6F0WJ6E,B00097C4BC,C.C.N.,"[23, 23]","I really enjoyed this DVD. It has a lot of great instruction and combinations for Tribal & Cabaret (Tribaret) bellydance.The DVD is sectioned into basic Bellydance isolations (the foundation of bellydance.), Oriental Flow and Tribal movements, shimmies & combinations.The Isolation section covers pretty much all the isolations that are the basis of bellydance. Carrie's explanations are very easy to understand and she breaks everything down, but moves through each one pretty quickly. Those who have never had any dance experience might have to go through this section a couple of times to get comfortable. A beginner with some class time or some experience will find it great for working on your technique.The Oreintal Flow section Carrie teaches bellydance combinations, using layered moves that are based on what was taught in the isolation section. She breaks down the combination but assumes you know how to do the basic movements (Chest circle, reverse undulation, etc.).A short practice session follows each combination taught. There are no on-screen cues or voice over, it's just follow-along.The Tribal section covers some of the basic Tribal movement vocabulary- Basic Arabic, Basic Egyptian, Choo Choos, Turkish Basic, Double Hip Bumps, etc. The break-downs are great and it is explained well.There is a Shimmy section that teaches the egyptian shimmy, 3/4 Shimmies (both up & down), and the bycicle shimmy.The next sections cover Intermediate & Advanced combinations that combine the Oriental Flow & basic Tribal sections. This is the main material of the video, where you learn a series of Tribaret combinations (10 in each section). There is a practice session after each combination. Again she breaks down the combination & foot work but you need to know how to do the basic movements (omi, maya, 3/4 shimmy, etc.) & be pretty comfortable with them. Because you will be layering them over other movements & taveling steps.The final section of the DVD is a practice flow with the shimmy combinations. There is no voice-over, just music and follow-along dancing.Last there is a costumed performance by Carrie, in the beautiful costume she wears on the the cover of the DVD.Also inculded on this is DVD is a short warm-up & cool-down section.Overall alot of great material here to get a good understanding of the Tribaret style, and lots of nice combinations you will enjoy incorporating into your dance.A beginner with some experience will enjoy it and should be able to accomplish the isolation and first few sections. The combination sections will give you a challange, but they are still fun and a great learning tool. This DVD is perfect for the Intermediate stundent.",5,Excellent DVD for learning Tribal/Cabaret Bellydance Combinations,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,2687,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'lot', 'great', 'instruction', 'combinations', 'Tribal', 'Cabaret', 'Tribaret', 'bellydance.The', 'DVD', 'sectioned', 'basic', 'Bellydance', 'isolations', 'foundation', 'bellydance', 'Oriental', 'Flow', 'Tribal', 'movements', 'shimmies', 'combinations.The', 'Isolation', 'section', 'pretty', 'much', 'isolations', 'are', 'basis', 'bellydance', 'Carrie', 'explanations', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'understand', 'everything', 'down', 'moves', 'one', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'dance', 'experience', 'might', 'have', 'go', 'section', 'couple', 'times', 'get', 'comfortable', 'beginner', 'class', 'time', 'experience', 'will', 'find', 'great', 'working', 'technique.The', 'Oreintal', 'Flow', 'section', 'Carrie', 'bellydance', 'combinations', 'using', 'layered', 'moves', 'are', 'based', 'what', 'was', 'taught', 'isolation', 'section', 'down', 'combination', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'basic', 'movements', 'Chest', 'circle', 'reverse', 'undulation', 'etc', '.A', 'short', 'practice', 'session', 'combination', 'taught', 'are', 'on-screen', 'cues', 'voice', 'just', 'follow-along.The', 'Tribal', 'section', 'basic', 'Tribal', 'movement', 'vocabulary-', 'Basic', 'Arabic', 'Basic', 'Egyptian', 'Choo', 'Choos', 'Turkish', 'Basic', 'Double', 'Hip', 'Bumps', 'etc', 'break-downs', 'are', 'great', 'explained', 'Shimmy', 'section', 'egyptian', 'shimmy', '3/4', 'Shimmies', 'bycicle', 'shimmy.The', 'next', 'sections', 'cover', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced', 'combinations', 'combine', 'Oriental', 'Flow', 'basic', 'Tribal', 'sections', 'main', 'material', 'video', 'where', 'learn', 'series', 'Tribaret', 'combinations', '10', 'section', 'practice', 'session', 'combination', 'Again', 'breaks', 'down', 'combination', 'foot', 'work', 'need', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'basic', 'movements', 'omi', 'maya', '3/4', 'shimmy', 'etc', 'be', 'pretty', 'comfortable', 'will', 'be', 'layering', 'other', 'movements', 'taveling', 'steps.The', 'final', 'section', 'DVD', 'practice', 'flow', 'shimmy', 'combinations', 'voice-over', 'just', 'music', 'follow-along', 'dancing.Last', 'costumed', 'performance', 'Carrie', 'beautiful', 'costume', 'cover', 'DVD.Also', 'inculded', 'DVD', 'short', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'section.Overall', 'alot', 'great', 'material', 'here', 'get', 'good', 'understanding', 'Tribaret', 'style', 'lots', 'nice', 'combinations', 'will', 'enjoy', 'incorporating', 'dance.A', 'beginner', 'experience', 'will', 'enjoy', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'accomplish', 'isolation', 'first', 'few', 'sections', 'combination', 'sections', 'will', 'give', 'challange', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'Intermediate', 'stundent']","Tribaret Belly Dance with Carrie Konyha- Technique & Combinations for the Versatile Dancer: Bellydance instruction, Tribaret belly dance beginner classes, complete how-to"

The cool down isnt very good its like the warm-up I would prefer to do yoga stretches at the end.  It has intermediate/advanced choreography which is done in the same way as the beginners which I haven't done yet as it's bit too advanced for me yet which is good, something to work towards.  This dvd is good due to the fact that you actually start dancing.  I found the shimmies hard to do,it was broken down and practised slow enough for me, but the drill doing it slowly wasn't long enough for me to actually be able to do it, I was fumbling along trying to do the shimmy - one - two/three, but I'm a beginner so I suppose one day it will just click.

The instructor elaborately demonstrates the isolation preparation section and progresses into the technique variations which are divided into 3 segments; Orientale flow, Tribal basics and Shimmies. These begin with basic steps such as the slinky taqsim, basic arabic, mayas; traveling steps such as arabesques, placed into combos which evolve into very delightful practice flows. Vital to tribal style is the 4/4, 3/4 up and downward shimmies, including more breakdowns.In this open level instruction, completing the above sections is recommended as the Tribaret technique progresses into intermediate and advanced sections with yet fabulous steps and combination sections, (including cues for transitions). These are then set to generous practice segments with lovely music, delightful to dance along.Beautiful upon completion, this program merges the percussive and smooth movement,with its advanced steps and combination reviews into wonderful practice flows.A spell-binding performance by Carrie Konyha finalizes the program.",5,A Perfect Harmony,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,1405,"['intriguing', 'combining', 'earthy', 'tribal', 'improvisations', 'feminine', 'graceful', 'cabaret', 'style', 'Tribaret', 'Belly', 'Dance', 'enchanting', 'craving', 'share', 'styles.With', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'features', 'choose', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'anyone', 'who', 'seriously', 'wish', 'delve', 'excellent', 'presentation', 'program', 'material', 'instructor', 'elaborately', 'isolation', 'preparation', 'section', 'technique', 'variations', 'are', 'divided', '3', 'segments', 'Orientale', 'flow', 'Tribal', 'basics', 'Shimmies', 'begin', 'basic', 'steps', 'such', 'slinky', 'taqsim', 'basic', 'arabic', 'mayas', 'traveling', 'steps', 'such', 'arabesques', 'placed', 'combos', 'evolve', 'very', 'delightful', 'practice', 'flows', 'Vital', 'tribal', 'style', '4/4', '3/4', 'up', 'downward', 'shimmies', 'including', 'more', 'breakdowns.In', 'open', 'level', 'instruction', 'completing', 'above', 'sections', 'recommended', 'Tribaret', 'technique', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'sections', 'yet', 'fabulous', 'steps', 'combination', 'sections', 'including', 'cues', 'transitions', 'are', 'then', 'set', 'generous', 'practice', 'segments', 'lovely', 'music', 'delightful', 'dance', 'along.Beautiful', 'completion', 'program', 'percussive', 'smooth', 'movement', 'advanced', 'steps', 'combination', 'reviews', 'wonderful', 'practice', 'flows.A', 'spell-binding', 'performance', 'Carrie', 'Konyha', 'program']","Tribaret Belly Dance with Carrie Konyha- Technique & Combinations for the Versatile Dancer: Bellydance instruction, Tribaret belly dance beginner classes, complete how-to"
