I had high hopes for this movie. I rented it online for $3.99, as I did not know if I would want to buy it for my collection of Christmas movies. I do however plan to tell others to watch it and rent it or buy it in hopes the revenues will encourage his family and estate to keep making Christmas movies. Kinkade was one of the few still putting out good solid family and faith Christmas movies before his death earlier this year and any one who likes these kind of movies I encourage to help support this movie. Rent or buy his Christmas Cottage and Christmas Lodge as well. The reasons I give this 3 stars are because it is a dark color movie, I realize it takes place at night and in a old church, but it gives a overall gloomy feel to the movie. The characters were some what believable, but not as good as in the first two movies. Each movie has new characters and they are not connected in story line. Only Christmas Cottage is about Kinkade's early years and life I believe. I feel that Christmas movies people enjoy because they offer wonder and joy and I did not feel either much during this movie, which is part of why I am giving it 3 stars. I liked the old church idea in it, but it moved slow in the story line and the Characters did not pull me into the story with their acting very well. It just did not compare to the first two Kinkade movies. I do hope that this is not the last Kinkade Christmas movie though, this is a good legacy and I'd rent every future movie they make if they make more. If they are good, I'd buy them too.
