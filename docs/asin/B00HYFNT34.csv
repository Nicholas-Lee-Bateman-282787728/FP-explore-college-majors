1693018,A15P6JXOSIN2TG,B00HYFNT34,"Jalynn Patterson ""pattersonmom24""","[13, 15]","About the DVD:Inspired by the death of Cameron&#8217;s close friend who succumbed to cancer at the age of 15, Kirk Cameron takes viewers on an inspiring and hope-filled visual journey to better understand the biggest doubt-raising question in faith: &#8220;Where is God in the midst of tragedy and suffering?&#8221;Going back to the beginning&#8212;literally&#8212;Kirk investigates the origins of good and evil and how they impact our lives &#8230; and our eternities. UNSTOPPABLE will prompt audiences to consider the role that pain and suffering has in our lives, as they affirm their personal views on faith, and encourage conversation starters about God, suffering, and hope.In theaters for only two weeknights (Sept 24th and Oct 3th, 2013), UNSTOPPABLE: A Live Event with Kirk Cameron sold a staggering 260,000 tickets and reached a theatrical gross of over $3.2 million dollars. In just two nights this independent project sent a loud message &#8211; audiences want thought-provoking and meaningful entertainment.About the Author:Kirk Cameron is best known for his memorable role as &#8220;Mike Seaver,&#8221; a cultural icon of the 80's, with his mullet hairstyle, cool glasses, and wisecracking comebacks. More recently he enjoyed much success with the No. 1 grossing inspirational film of 2008, Fireproof, and his recent documentary, Monumental. Kirk and his wife, Chelsea, were on-screen sweethearts during their Growing Pains years and are the founders of Camp Firefly, where terminally and seriously ill children and their families are provided an all-expense paid retreat ([...]). Together, Kirk and Chelsea live in California with their six children.My Review:Life's greatest mystery is God. It seems we know so much about Him yet not enough. Kirk Cameron attacks this head on with his recently released documentary type DVD, UnStoppable. He takes a recent death of a family's friend teenage son and tries to go all the way back to creation to answer the question of why God lets death and tragedies take place when with His mighty hand he could actually prevent such things.Kirk takes the whole idea and expands on it but I don't think he really ever comes up with a concrete answer. I believe that it is so complex and so beyond our realm of understanding that the we will never understand this side of heaven. I also believe that sometimes God has to allow such things to happen to glorify Him in some way. Whether it be ultimate healing or a tragedy such as earthquakes or fires, He may use these terrible things to make good out of them in some way, but I refuse to believe that He would cause them to happen.**Disclosure** This product was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from FlyBy/Propeller.",5,I loved it!,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,2729,"['DVD', 'Inspired', 'death', 'Cameron', '8217', 'close', 'friend', 'who', 'succumbed', 'cancer', 'age', '15', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'viewers', 'inspiring', 'hope-filled', 'visual', 'journey', 'better', 'understand', 'biggest', 'doubt-raising', 'question', 'faith', '8220', 'Where', 'God', 'midst', 'tragedy', 'suffering', '8221', 'Going', 'back', 'beginning', '8212', 'literally', '8212', 'Kirk', 'origins', 'good', 'evil', 'how', 'impact', 'lives', '8230', 'eternities', 'UNSTOPPABLE', 'will', 'prompt', 'audiences', 'consider', 'role', 'pain', 'suffering', 'lives', 'affirm', 'personal', 'views', 'faith', 'encourage', 'conversation', 'starters', 'God', 'suffering', 'hope.In', 'theaters', 'only', 'two', 'weeknights', 'Sept', '24th', 'Oct', '3th', '2013', 'UNSTOPPABLE', 'Live', 'Event', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'sold', 'staggering', '260,000', 'tickets', 'reached', 'theatrical', 'gross', '3.2', 'million', 'dollars', 'just', 'two', 'nights', 'independent', 'project', 'sent', 'loud', 'message', '8211', 'audiences', 'want', 'thought-provoking', 'meaningful', 'Author', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'best', 'known', 'memorable', 'role', '8220', 'Mike', 'Seaver', '8221', 'cultural', 'icon', '80', 'mullet', 'hairstyle', 'cool', 'glasses', 'wisecracking', 'comebacks', 'More', 'recently', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'success', 'No', '1', 'grossing', 'inspirational', 'film', '2008', 'Fireproof', 'recent', 'documentary', 'Monumental', 'Kirk', 'wife', 'Chelsea', 'were', 'on-screen', 'sweethearts', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'years', 'are', 'founders', 'Camp', 'Firefly', 'where', 'terminally', 'seriously', 'ill', 'children', 'families', 'are', 'provided', 'all-expense', 'paid', 'retreat', '[', ']', 'Together', 'Kirk', 'Chelsea', 'live', 'California', 'six', 'children.My', 'Review', 'Life', 'greatest', 'mystery', 'God', 'know', 'so', 'much', 'Him', 'yet', 'not', 'enough', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'head', 'recently', 'released', 'documentary', 'type', 'DVD', 'UnStoppable', 'recent', 'death', 'family', 'friend', 'teenage', 'son', 'tries', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'creation', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'God', 'death', 'tragedies', 'take', 'place', 'when', 'mighty', 'hand', 'could', 'actually', 'prevent', 'such', 'things.Kirk', 'whole', 'idea', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'ever', 'up', 'concrete', 'answer', 'believe', 'so', 'complex', 'so', 'realm', 'understanding', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'side', 'heaven', 'also', 'believe', 'sometimes', 'God', 'allow', 'such', 'things', 'happen', 'glorify', 'Him', 'way', 'be', 'ultimate', 'healing', 'tragedy', 'such', 'earthquakes', 'fires', 'may', 'use', 'terrible', 'things', 'make', 'good', 'way', 'refuse', 'believe', 'would', 'cause', 'happen', '**Disclosure**', 'product', 'was', 'sent', 'free', 'charge', 'honest', 'review', 'FlyBy/Propeller']",N/A

1693021,A33ERCLW7K2NSC,B00HYFNT34,"Katie McCurdy ""Legacy of a Writer""","[24, 25]","I wasn't sure what to expect from Unstoppable  -- I only knew I was very curious how Kirk Cameron was going to answer the difficult and complex question of why God allows tragedy in our lives. He told the story of a young boy who died after battling cancer for 10 years. This is the story the movie opens with, and from there Kirk takes you an a journey to understand why God allows sufferings.I really enjoyed the movie. It was put together very well and in such a way that was really eye-catching and kept your attention till the very end. I wasn't a fan of all the music used in this film -- especially when they reenact Cain killing Abel. It got really loud and and hard. I'm not familiar with what rock music sounds like (don't listen to it), but it made me think of this music genre.I thought Kirk did a fabulous job at answering this unanswerable question. We can't know or understand some things -- like this question -- until we are with the Lord in heaven. There are some things that are just to vast and deep for our minds to wrap around. But in Unstoppable , Kirk took his viewers back to the beginning -- into the Garden of Eden -- and showed what a merciful God we serve and how much we, humans, have failed and do not deserve His grace.It was a really good, refreshing presentation of the gospel -- a great reminder of what a merciful and powerful God I serve! I really appreciate the way Kirk started from the beginning and went all the way to the Cross. If someone has never heard the true Gospel message before, they will get a very thorough presentation of it in Unstoppable .The movie had several special features, teasing at the projects that Kirk Cameron is currently working on. they all sound great and I can't wait to find out more information about them in the months ahead. If you've ever experienced a personal loss in your life or have pondered this age-old question before, I would highly encourage you to get this DVD. You won't regret watching it, and it may just change your outlook on things.I reviewed this DVD for FlyBy Promotions - special thanks to Laura for setting this up!

1693022,A3SD3E6FIS6CS9,B00HYFNT34,Marine Corps Nomad,"[5, 6]","Going into this movie, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but I&#8217;ve always been impressed by the films in which Kirk Cameron has been involved. I was also intrigued by the topic covered &#8211; &#8220;Where is God in the midst of tragedy and suffering?&#8221; &#8211; as I believe this is one of the most asked questions by people when it comes to God. Every time a tragedy strikes &#8211; especially on a large scale &#8211; this question seems to come to the forefront.Kirk Cameron&#8217;s young friend, Matthew Sandgren, finally lost his battle with cancer which cut Kirk to the core. Matthew&#8217;s family and friends knew that he was in a better place and no longer suffering. Yet, his death, his suffering beg the question as to why he had to get cancer in the first place and why he had to eventually succumb to it rather than defeat it. In other words, why do bad things happen to good people.Kirk takes us back to the beginning, the very beginning, to where the world was first created by God. We follow along as visually as sin enters the world through Adam and Eve. Kirk&#8217;s story is part documentary about Matthew, his family and friends, and it&#8217;s part dramatization of Biblical events. Some of the events are covered in a less than traditional way &#8211; such as Satan being shown as a man rather than a serpent, but the dramatization is very thought-provoking.There are some scenes that may not be suitable for young children &#8211; Cain killing Able and the resulting blood is one of them, but these topics are important to the information being presented. Parents may want to preview the video as they know their children best when it comes to what they can and can not handle.Unstoppable tackles the difficult topic of suffering and death within the domain of a living God. It does a nice job of laying out the reasons behind why there is suffering and death in this world. It also presents the salvation message within the telling of Matthew&#8217;s life and death. Kirk is very passionate about the topic, and his love for Christ and the Sandgrens is quite evident.Disclosure (in accordance with the FTC&#8217;s 16 CFR, Part 255: &#8220;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising): Many thanks to Propeller Consulting, LLC for providing a sample of the product in exchange for this review.

But when your whole world comes crashing down on you, the questions start:Where is God when I need him most?Why do bad things happen to good people?Unstoppable is a journey, based on a true story, that has become the most personal and transparent project I have ever made regarding my faith.&#34;In a nutshell Unstoppable was inspired by the death of 15 year old Matt who battled cancer for 10 years.Kirk Cameron had no idea where this particular journey would lead him when he decided to record the young football player's funeral in Bison, South Dakota - population 373 - but he knew in his heart he wanted to share with others this moment.Part documentary/memorial Unstoppable follows the family and close friends as they say goodbye to this brave young man, their pain and suffering incredibly dignified and their faith unequivocal.Kirk Cameron is at his best as he goes back to the very beginning, showing us the very origin of good versus evil beginning with the stories of Adam and Eve and then Cain and Abel.Unstoppable is unlike any other movie, alternating betwixt the memorial service and Kirk Cameron's firm belief that God is always with us despite unbearable trials.

It's very distracting and takes away from the movie.Secondly, the biblical scenes from the Bible such as Genesis, Noah, etc were rather dragged out. I'm growing frustrated that we're always hearing of these famous stories, but rarely on the REST of the stories in the Bible. They were included too for a reason. I understand where Kirk was going with it, but they were too dragged out and some of the music was off putting as well.Thirdly, the entire movie just felt choppy and while Kirk tries his best to answer the question, &#34;Why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?&#34;, I don't personally feel like he answered it well.",2,Not His Best Work,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",2014,974,"['Normally', ""'m"", 'movies', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', ""'re"", 'usually', 'good', 'one', 'left', 'others', 'feeling', 'needed', 'massive', 'work.For', 'starters', 'entire', 'movie', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kirk', 'talking', 'then', ""'ll"", 'see', 'blip', 'where', 'clearly', 'edited', 'scene', 'talking', 'onwards', 'very', 'distracting', 'away', 'movie.Secondly', 'biblical', 'scenes', 'Bible', 'such', 'Genesis', 'Noah', 'etc', 'were', 'rather', 'dragged', 'out', ""'m"", 'growing', 'frustrated', ""'re"", 'always', 'hearing', 'famous', 'stories', 'rarely', 'REST', 'stories', 'Bible', 'were', 'included', 'too', 'reason', 'understand', 'where', 'Kirk', 'was', 'going', 'were', 'too', 'dragged', 'out', 'music', 'was', 'off', 'putting', 'well.Thirdly', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'choppy', 'Kirk', 'best', 'answer', 'question', '34', 'Why', 'God', 'allow', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'feel', 'answered', 'well']",N/A

We have definitely both grown up a lot since then and I continued to follow his career and was thrilled as a fellow Christian when his life took the path that it did. Instead of focusing on the secular industry where he could make a lot more money, Cameron has dedicated his life and career to spreading the gospel and using his God given talents for God&#8217;s glory instead of his own.Unstoppable is a personal project inspired by the loss of a young life that brought into question the same one that we all have asked: &#8220;why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?&#8221; A high school friend recently lost a young child and my husbands cousin lost her husband at such a young age leaving behind four children. Holding my newborn baby and thinking of all the fears that mothers of little ones have, I have asked myself the same question over the past several weeks many times. This movie came at a time when I needed to see it.It is very raw and Cameron is extremely open and bears his heart and soul. The first fifteen minutes were very emotional and dark and drew me right into the story of his friends child that died. I wanted to hear the answers and know his version of why God allows these things to happen.He takes us back to the begin inning and the original sin. It is almost done like a documentary and there is a lot of imagery while he tells stories from the Bible. This would be great for new believers or non believers that don&#8217;t know all of the Bible stories. I will admit, I got a little bored at moments just because they are all stories I&#8217;ve heard a thousand times before. I can see the need for the history for those that don&#8217;t know it, but for those that do it was a bit dry, even if it was being told by Kirk Cameron!He goes through the history of the Bible and tells man of the stories about pain and suffering and God&#8217;s hand in it all. It&#8217;s very moving at times when dealing with the loss of his friend but slow at others with all of the history and imagery and music that relaxed me a little too much!Unstoppable is moving and has beautiful images that would be great for those that are new to faith or don&#8217;t believe at all. Cameron obviously knows his Bible and has wisdom to impart. He isn&#8217;t just another actor. He lives what he preaches and believes it to his core and his faith and heart shine through.",4,Answers Tough Questions about Faith,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2488,"['have', 'been', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'fan', 'tween', 'years', 'when', 'Mike', 'Seaver', 'was', 'man', 'dreams', 'have', 'definitely', 'grown', 'up', 'lot', 'then', 'continued', 'follow', 'career', 'was', 'thrilled', 'fellow', 'Christian', 'when', 'life', 'took', 'path', 'did', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'secular', 'industry', 'where', 'could', 'make', 'lot', 'more', 'money', 'Cameron', 'dedicated', 'life', 'career', 'spreading', 'gospel', 'using', 'God', 'given', 'talents', 'God', '8217', 'glory', 'instead', 'own.Unstoppable', 'personal', 'project', 'inspired', 'loss', 'young', 'life', 'brought', 'question', 'same', 'one', 'have', 'asked', '8220', 'why', 'God', 'allow', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people', '8221', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'recently', 'lost', 'young', 'child', 'husbands', 'cousin', 'lost', 'husband', 'young', 'age', 'leaving', 'four', 'children', 'Holding', 'newborn', 'baby', 'thinking', 'fears', 'mothers', 'little', 'ones', 'have', 'have', 'asked', 'same', 'question', 'past', 'several', 'weeks', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'came', 'time', 'when', 'needed', 'see', 'it.It', 'very', 'raw', 'Cameron', 'extremely', 'open', 'heart', 'soul', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'were', 'very', 'emotional', 'dark', 'drew', 'right', 'story', 'friends', 'child', 'died', 'wanted', 'hear', 'answers', 'know', 'version', 'why', 'God', 'things', 'happen.He', 'back', 'begin', 'inning', 'original', 'sin', 'almost', 'done', 'documentary', 'lot', 'imagery', 'stories', 'Bible', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'new', 'believers', 'non', 'believers', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'Bible', 'stories', 'will', 'admit', 'got', 'little', 'bored', 'moments', 'just', 'are', 'stories', '8217', 've', 'heard', 'thousand', 'times', 'can', 'see', 'need', 'history', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'do', 'was', 'bit', 'dry', 'even', 'was', 'being', 'told', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'history', 'Bible', 'man', 'stories', 'pain', 'suffering', 'God', '8217', 's', 'hand', '8217', 'very', 'moving', 'times', 'when', 'dealing', 'loss', 'friend', 'slow', 'others', 'history', 'imagery', 'music', 'relaxed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Unstoppable', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'images', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'are', 'new', 'faith', 'don', '8217', 'believe', 'Cameron', 'obviously', 'Bible', 'wisdom', 'impart', '8217', 't', 'just', 'actor', 'what', 'core', 'faith', 'heart', 'shine']",N/A
