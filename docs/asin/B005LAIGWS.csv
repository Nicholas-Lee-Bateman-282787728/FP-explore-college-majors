1465751,A2RFK1JEOAUQMB,B005LAIGWS,"Aaron Mills "".""","[1, 1]","It's not the worst super hero movie ever made, but it's still not very good. A lot of the two director's ideas for Ghost Rider are just lame. His skull is less flaming than it was in the first film, he walks oddly like he's drunk, his cheesy visual illusions are pointless & stupid, his demonic stair looks way less cool than it did in the first movie or in the comics. It was even better looking as a Super move in that crappy Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 game. Also, even with the cheap ability to now simply touch someone to set them on fire, it seems rather easy to kick this drunken Ghost Rider's butt.The only cool they added to Ghost Rider is an ability to touch & turn vehicles into demonic weapons that Ghost Rider can then control, but it doesn't save the movie. The plot isn't too bad by most comic book movie standards, but the writing is kind of dull & the film can be rather slow at times. The Ghost Rider's host, Johnny Blaze (played by Nicolas Cage), isn't a very interesting character to watch other than the ocassional & halarious mental break down.So far, I actually like the filming style of the film's two director's (Taylor & Neveldine) in other films like Crank & Gamer, but I think they could have done way better with Ghost Rider. Overall, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengence isn't the worst, but its not really good. Costing about $10 to stream it for rent on Amazon Instat Video, it's really hard to recommend this film as even a rental. I'd rather watch something else like, for example, even the first Ghost Rider movie. Maybe if Ghost Rider laid off the alcohol, this sequel would be a better movie.",2,Don't Be Fooled By The Trailer.

1465765,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B005LAIGWS,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[1, 4]","Ghost Rider has always been a niche character for Marvel Comics. The character was born out of an earlier Marvel character named Night Rider. After Marvel writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog had rein-visioned the character into Ghost Rider during the early 70's it has always remained on the extreme fringes of the Marvel Comics universe. This wouldn't stop Sony (which owned the film rights to the character) to go ahead and adapt it for the big-screen. 2007's Ghost Rider by Mark Johnson was the first and failed attempt to turn the character into a film franchise. It still made enough money despite a near-universal panning of the film by critics and audiences alike. This turn of profit is why Sony once again dipped into the Ghost Rider well and come up with 2012's Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.This ""sort of"" sequel ditches Mark Johnson and brings in the dynamic (and I'd say somewhat insane) directing duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor to helm the film. It brings back Nicolas Cage for the role of Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. Working from a script by Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer one would think the film had nowhere else to go but up especially with the wacky and frenetic filming style by Neveldine/Taylor. To say that this sequel failed to do anything but finally give this film franchise a final nail in it coffin would be an understatement.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance ditches pretty much most of what transpired with the first film and tries to retcon things for the sequel. I'd say this would've been a good idea seeing the first film was truly awful, but what the sequel ended up doing was confuse things even more. The film tries to turn the Ghost Rider persona from just a spirit of vengeance but an angelic being called the spirit of justice which had become corrupted. We get the Devil in the form of Roarke (played by Irish actor Ciaran Hinds) searching for the young boy Danny who is to be his perfect vessel.  Johnny Blaze comes into the picture after being recruited by a drunk French warrior-monk by the name of Moreau (Idris Elba whose performance was one of the lone highlights of the film) who promises to exorcise the demon from Blaze in exchange for finding and saving Danny.This would've been a good premise if it had several more drafts of it worked on. Though there's still a chance the film would've still sucked in the end. Even the direction from Neveldine/Taylor (Crank, Crank: High Voltage, Gamer) failed to add any heat to the proceedings. They come up with some unique camera angles and action sequences, but gone was the hyper-realistic and frenetic style they've become known for. Their previous films were not stuff to write to one's film critic circles about but they at least had a sense of fun built into them even if their stories defied any sort of logic.Even the performances by the cast seemed to be something that barely reached the level of one-dimensional. Nicolas Cage tries to channel his inner crazy by way of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, but it's too little too late to save the film which never found any sort of footing on the side of competent. Really, the only good thing worth of note was my previous mention of Idris Elba as Moreau who chews the scenery every time he shows up on the screen like it was his last meal. This performance alone wasn't enough to save the film or even make it somewhat entertaining.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was not worth seeing in the theater (especially in 3D though that part of the film was actually quite well done despite being a post conversion) and I'd be willing to admit that it's still not worth seeing on video unless it was for free. What could've been a restart to the series with the inclusion of Neveldine/Taylor instead gives this franchise it's death-knell and most likely help Marvel get the rights back from Sony.

CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see.

The director of the original Ghost Rider (Mark Steven Johnson) was out and the directors of Crank (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) were in. Now that it's been released it's been getting nothing but a barrage of negative reviews pretty much anywhere you can think of. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is practically a reboot and could serve as a full on reset of the franchise if Cage wasn't attached. With everything working against this requel (that's reboot + sequel combined) and every entertainment site on the planet practically guaranteeing its atrocity, I seem to be one of the few critics in existence who was actually entertained by this movie.Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has gone into seclusion in Eastern Europe. Johnny fights not only the urge to become The Rider, but fights to stay hidden from those who are hunting for him. That is until a man named Moreau (Idris Elba) shows up on his doorstep offering Johnny a second chance and a way to lift his curse. The offer gives Johnny a chance for revenge against Roarke (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) who's Lucifer himself in human form and the man Blaze made a deal with to become The Rider in the first place. The one catch is Johnny has to guard and protect a boy that Roarke is searching for to fulfill the prophecy of becoming the antichrist.The main attraction to this movie was how it looked. There's this featurette that highlights just how camera oriented Neveldine and Taylor are when they come to shooting their movies. Seeing Neveldine basically risk his life rollerblading on the back of a motorcycle or hanging off of a wire along with the stuntman just to get the shot was incredibly intriguing to me. Unique perspective and fascinating camera work is something I look for in movies and Spirit of Vengeance let you know it had that in the trailers. The flaw in this method though is that even though it gets you up close and personal with the action it also feels really shaky at times. It seems very rough in comparison to dolly tracks or tripods being used. The camera work also involves those slight zoom-ins at random intervals to make it seem like the camera wasn't in the right place when they started shooting.I'm hearing a lot of people complain about the special effects, but those are another high point. Ghost Rider's appearance is more charred in comparison to how he looked in the first movie. His skull looks scorched, his leather clothes are melted, and the steel on his motorcycle is noticeably red hot and altered thanks to his transformation. The fire looks pretty fantastic all around and there's plenty of it. Everything The Rider drives becomes engulfed in flames and the special effects crew has a ton of fun with that. Maybe it looks terrible in 3D? I was going to recommend seeing it in 2D anyway. Johnny Blaze's transformations into Ghost Rider are pretty sweet, too. Seeing his eyes sink in for the first time is a bit unsettling, but it becomes a trademark. As he holds off The Rider the majority of the movie, his eyes are the first thing to show the transformation. It was a bit reminiscent of the T-1000 being shot in the face in the steel mill at the end of Terminator 2.Nicolas Cage is exactly what you expect him to be here. The issue is that like always he's way too over the top during intense moments and not emotional enough during the quieter ones. The best example is when Johnny Blaze and Nadya (Violante Placido) are trying to catch up with the men who took Danny (Fergus Riordan) who's Nadya's son and the boy who's set to become the antichrist. Johnny and Nadya are interrogating a man named Vasil. Notice how twitchy Cage becomes here and how crazy he becomes during his ""bad man"" and ""scraping at the door"" speech. It's pretty insane in this so bad it's good kind of way. Cage's performance seems to evolve throughout the movie and he almost seems sincere by the end of it. Cage also modeled The Rider's movements off of his pet cobra and it's blatantly obvious. His performance as The Rider is full of rigid movements, swaying motions, and quick cuts. It's very bizarre, especially when it gets to the scene where The Rider is floating around in circles on his back as if he's duplicating Trent Reznor in the Nine Inch Nails video for ""Closer.""You'll wish Idris Elba's wine-loving Moreau had more screen time than he actually does as the Moreau character is generally pretty interesting, but doesn't really get a chance to shine. He does have a few really memorable scenes though. This will make more sense after you see it, but the ""decay vision"" gets a little bothersome. It's like looking at the action through a giant peephole or fishbowl. The evolution of the Carrigan character (played by Johnny Whitworth) is pretty awesome though.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is not as bad as people are making it out to be or maybe it is and it's just really entertaining anyway. The dialogue does get really cheesy at times (""You're the devil's baby mama.""), but the story and part of the screenplay were written by David S. Goyer so that should give you a little bit of hope. The special effects are fantastic, Cage's performance eventually grows on you, and Spirit of Vengeance is a huge step up from the original movie overall. In the end, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is explosively entertaining and just the type of brainless fun you need to forget about a hectic week.",3,Savor it like a fine wine. Moreau can vouch for it.,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,5592,"['think', 'everyone', 'had', 'urge', 'run', 'outside', 'kick', 'ugliest', 'puppy', 'neighborhood', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'second',

Even if you feel you take take anticipaton the prolonged event of transformation went on far too long and began to deflate the tension they were hoping to build.

It nearly becomes an insult.As mentioned in other reviews, the animation sequence seemed to be taken straight out of Harry Potter. I initially thought, ""So what, maybe they just like the way it looked"". The problem was that it was placed disjointedly, feeling as if it really didn't belong and one of the many producers insisted that they needed something like that and the director put it in just to shut him up.If you are going to watch this, rent it.

1465794,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B005LAIGWS,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","With the box office success of the 2007 film ""Ghost Rider"", a character based on the popular Marvel Comics supernatural anti-hero, there was no doubt that Columbia Pictures and Marvel would once again work on a sequel.But rather than work on a sequel, producers Ari Arad and Avi Arad wanted to go in a different direction, to focus more on a reboot of the character and showcase Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider.  So, for ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"", the producers decided to bring in ""Crank"" and ""Jonah Hex"" directorial team Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  Brought in to write the screenplay was David S. Goyer (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""FlashForward""), Scott M. Gimple (""Life"", ""The Walking Dead"", ""FlashForward"") and Seth Hoffman (""Prison Break"", ""House M.D."").Actor Nicolas Cage would reprise his role as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider and Ciaran Hinds as Roarke.  Starring in the film are Violante Placido (""The American, ""Che ne sara di Noi""), Idris Elba (""Thor"", ""28 Weeks Later"", ""The Wire""), Johnny Whitworth (""Limitless"", ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Empire Records"")  and Fergus Riordan (""Fragile"", ""I Want to be a Soldier"").VIDEO:""Ghost Rider: Spirits of Vengeance"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The great news is that the film looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Shot on digital, the film features wonderful detail from the CG work of Ghost Rider, to the clarity of details of Ghost Rider's jacket, Johnny Blaze's transformation, the use of fire and flame effects and much more!  The colors are vibrant and videophiles should be pleased by the detail of the film.  With that being said, the weakness which many people felt about the film is shooting the film via handheld.  Many disliked it, I personally was not too bothered by it.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the lossless audio, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 DTS-HD MA and an English-Audio Descriptive track plus Catalan 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from an action-driven film, this film is immersive.  The soundscape in you room is filled with audio from all over, thanks to its use of directional sound coming from the surround channels.  From the Ghost Rider taking control of various vehicles (including one behemoth vehicle), a chase scene with many crash scenes and explosions and windows and glass shattering, to the many guns being fired in the film, especially heavy artillery, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic!Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" comes with the following special features:Directors Expanded Video Commentary - A video commentary featuring filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  While the two are shown frequently during the commentary, we also see a video of the film but also a smaller video section in the corner featuring the actual filming of a certain scene.  There is no doubt that Neveldine and Taylor bring a lot of humor to the audio commentary, but depending on one's taste, some may find it funny and others may find it annoying.  But it's an informative but off-the-cuff type of commentary that you usually don't hear in a film.Deleted Scenes - (11:20) A total of six deleted scenes.The Path to Vengeance: Making Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance - (1:25:00)  A six-documentary which can be watched in full or by each part.  Featuring ""Blazing New Path"" (8:31, Discussion of not wanting to make a sequel but a new film/reboot), ""Patience is Not a Virtue: Pre-Production"" (25:31, working on the script, hiring the cast and more), ""We Will Burn This City to Bitter Ashes (8:50, about filming in Eastern Europe), ""To Hell and Back: Production"" (23:41, from shooting the film, makeup and more), ""Walking in Both Worlds: Post-Production"" (15:32, the digital effects of the film) and ""The Fires of Hell Will Purify You: Release"" (8:41, test screenings, promoting the film at Comic-Con and more).Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers.EXTRAS:A code is included with the Blu-ray release to watch and access the full-length movie  via the cloud through Ultraviolet.JUDGMENT CALL:As a comic collector during my child up to my college years, ""Ghost Rider"" was a title that I did purchase and collect.  And to tell you the truth, when this sequel came out, I was a bit excited because I thought the film would feature Danny Ketch and the character known as Vengeance.But instead, it was a film to showcase Ghost Rider, his powers (using newer technology than what was used in the first film) and showcase Johnny Blaze and the battle he faces each day with the demon inside him. And while I did like seeing the craziness of Johnny Blaze, thanks to Nicolas Cage's portrayal of the character, the film was all action with a storyline that seemed to be created around the action.We have the cool Idris Elba show up as the often inebriated priest Moreau, but unfortunately, his character was never fully developed.  We see the beautiful Violante Placido as Nadya, who was featured heavily in the first half of the film but yet she nearly disappears for the second half until the end.So, I was bit surprised because I expected a lot from David S. Goyer, who did a fantastic job with the screenplay of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begins"", but the film seems to embody more action as his previous screenplays that he did for films like ""Blade"" and ""Blade II"".  But I wouldn't be surprised if the screenplay was rewritten and retweaked for budgetary reasons and molded for the directorial style of filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.Personally, having read the ""Ghost Rider"" comic books, the film really needs to take a darker step forward.  While the visual effects of this film was good, having a story with Ghost Rider around a young boy, just doesn't seem right.  It reminds me of Marvel comic books of the '80s when Spider-Man, Captain America and other superheroes would hang out with children (which was understandable as the demographic targeted was children), but in today's superhero films, I definitely don't want to see a superhero film that revolves around a child, especially with a dark character such as Ghost Rider.While the popcorn action will definitely entice those who expect Ghost Rider to kick some ass, the step to a more darker Ghost Rider was cool to see visually, but the action and visual effects can only go so far.  Personally, they need to get out of the Roarke storyline and possibly consider focusing on a storyline featuring Ghost Rider vs. another Marvel hero (which usually happens in the comic books), a hero that possibly Marvel may want to look into giving the character its own film.  May it be the return of Blade or Iron Fist/Luke Cage, Dr. Strange or even Ghost Rider vs. Vengeance if need be.  And both working together in taking on a greater evil.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" does look and sound great on Blu-ray, that is a major plus!  And whether or not you enjoy the humorous video commentary by filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, at least the guys are able to defend the film and even have fun joking around about the film despite how many critics disapproved of the film.Overall, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" was a step forward in terms of visual effects and going for a more darker feel, but its storyline was taking several steps backward.  To have a bad ass character such as Ghost Rider featured in a screenplay that revolves around a kid... what a way to dampen the enthusiasm for fans expecting so much from an iconic Marvel Comics antihero!Ghost Rider deserves much better, as has the other Marvel superheroes have received in their own films.  A better storyline to balance out the incredible action.""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" will appeal to movie fans who love films (especially Blu-ray releases) with plenty of action.

1465816,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005LAIGWS,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 6]","Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, a sequel to the wretched 2007 movie Ghost Rider. I've never read a Ghost Rider comic and I despised the first film, but actually looked forward to this sequel for a number of reasons. First, this sequel boasts an entirely new creative team and delivered an impressive trailer. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I've become a huge Nicolas Cage fan. Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the creative minds behind the Crank films, the two are known for injecting their work with a lot of energy. It's with sadness that I report Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is an uneven, poorly written film only slightly better than its predecessor.Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe, struggling with the curse of being the Ghost Rider. He's approached by a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba) who wants Johnny to help protect Danny (Fergus Riordan), a young boy being hunted by the Devil (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds). Initially reluctant, Moreau promises Johnny that his assistance will give him the one thing he wants back most in the world; his soul.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a complete departure from the first film in tone and style; much darker, yet somehow taking itself less seriously. While Mark Steven Johnson (a very hit & miss writer/director) wrote and directed the first film, the sequel has Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman, and David S. Goyer handling writing duties. The latter had a hand in writing two terrific comic book-based sequels, Blade II and The Dark Knight. A deeper look into his filmography reveals he's quite the hit & miss writer himself, with films like Demonic Toys and The Crow: City of Angels under his belt. The script successfully strays from the tone of the first film, but is ultimately the film's greatest weakness. It's poorly conceived and ham-fisted, with a story that could serve as any run-of-the-mill, straight-to-video action flick.The manic direction of Neveldine/Taylor and the mania of the great Nicolas Cage keep the film watchable. Full disclosure; Neveldine/Taylor have never made a great film and some could argue they've never even made a good film. They've directed Crank, its sequel Crank: High Voltage, and Gamer. With the exception of the latter (unseen by me), these are fast-paced, over-the-top, mindless action movies that accomplish exactly what they intend to and are so ridiculously fast-paced and entertaining, I can harbor no ill-will towards them. Their last screenwriting credit was for Jonah Hex. Remember that movie? You don't need to. The Neveldine/Taylor name is not exactly synonymous with high-quality filmmaking, but they are high-energy filmmakers with talent. If they had a good script, they could pull off something spectacular. They do a better job on Ghost Rider than Mark Steven Johnson did, bringing their trademark ""action-movie on amphetamines"" style to it. The fun, animated sequences scattered throughout are a nice touch that I'm sure are entirely their creation.Then there's Nicolas Cage, a rare actor capable of elevating the worst material. It's easy to say that Cage's recent track record of bad movies is to blame for how ineffective this movie is, but this is likely the Ghost Rider film we'd get with or without him. With him, it's occasionally amusing trash. Without him, it would just be trash. Neveldine/Taylor can only do so much to make it trashy fun, but the amateurish script automatically relegates it to garbage-status. Cage, as usual, elevates it by going over-the-top and having fun with it. It's clear that Cage enjoyed making the film more than I enjoyed watching it, but his boyish, maniacal glee make passages of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance worth watching. Even Cage can't turn water into wine, but he's an actor that never fails to amuse.The special effects, including the design of the Ghost Rider are much better; grittier and more appropriate to the character. Hinds is a great actor who does what he can as the Devil, but the main villain is Ray Carrigan (played by Johnny Whitworth), who later becomes Blackout. Blackout may be an interesting villain in comic book form, but on film he's just a moderately amusing, inept villain with the power to decay anything he touches. In its brief running time, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance races through mildly entertaining action sequences and an uninteresting, predictable plot to eventually reach a disappointing anti-climax. The Ghost Rider character lacks enough depth to ever be a part of a film as impressive as The Dark Knight, but there is potential there for a bad-ass movie. This sequel, while much better than its predecessor, not only fails to live up to that potential but fails to live up to a standard of mediocrity.",2,"A Poorly Conceived Film, Much Better Than the

Johnny Blaze has made a deal with the Devil, and he is trying to figure out how he can save humanity from the Devil and not kill everyone in the process as he does it.To break this movie down and come up with a couple sentences or a paragraph to describe it was way more difficult for me then it was suppose to be. This movie is a mess! There were just too many things going on that had me confused. I, to a strong degree, almost didn't understand the plot to the movie. Granted I wasn't a big fan of Ghost Rider comics, there may be something's that I need to understand about the Ghost Rider. I don't think all the understanding in the world could have this film. There isn't a ""we are the world"" song we could sing to save this film. This could have been a movie that could have had a basic plot and my have been successful. This movie needed more action! People want to see what the Ghost Rider can do. There were very little action scenes and the one that they gave us wasn't really that great. There's moments in this movie were I'm still trying to figure out what is going on. Then they threw a kid in the mix. Not a good idea to me. Unfortunately, what ended up happening (that I saw coming) was the kid was getting to much attention in the movie. I think I could have come up with a plot better than this and I didn't even read Ghost Rider comics as a kid. It simply sucked and it even sucks more that Nicolas Cage had to be apart of this awfulness.Some things that I did like about the movie (besides the previews) were there were some cool scenes in the movie. Seeing Ghost rider on fire and a chain rapidly coming out of his mouth was awesome. There was one scene in the movie that I liked and thought was funny. It was the scene when Johnny Blaze was trying to get some guy in the hospital to corporate. Being though he was Johnny Blaze just started going crazy and transforming back and forth between Ghost Rider and himself. I also thought some of the camera views were nice. You could tell the director put a lot of work into that.My final rating for this movie is going to be a 4 out of 10. This is an extremely low rating for me. Its very rare I rate movies this low. That should tell you something right there. Don't see this movie on anything. If your super curious or a big Ghost Rider fan than you have my blessing to catch this on Netflix, or borrow it from one of your friends. That's if your friends collect enough nerve to purchase it.",2,"Nice try, but NO!!!!!",1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3162,"['movie', 'am', 'now', 'reviewing', 'called', 'Ghost', 'Rider', '2', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'starring', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Johnny', 'Whitworth', 'played', 'Limitless', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'February', '17', '2012', 'actually', 'got', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'theater', 'Honestly', 'thought', 'first', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Even', 'lot', 'people', 'talked', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'When', 'saw', 'previews', 'film', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'was', 'thinking', 'myself', 'have', 'see', 'thought', 'first', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'looked', 'second', 'coming', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'better.This', 'movie', 'dare', 'devil', 'named', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'made', 'deal', 'Devil', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'can', 'save', 'humanity', 'Devil', 'not', 'kill', 'everyone', 'process', 'it.To', 'break', 'movie', 'down', 'come', 'up', 'couple', 'sentences', 'paragraph', 'describe', 'was', 'way', 'more', 'difficult', 'then', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'movie', 'mess', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'had', 'confused', 'strong', 'degree', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'plot', 'movie', 'Granted', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'comics', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'need', 'understand', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'understanding', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'film', ""n't"", 'are', 'world', 'song', 'could', 'sing', 'save', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'basic', 'plot', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'movie', 'needed', 'more', 'action', 'People', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'can', 'do', 'were', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'scenes', 'one', 'gave', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'were', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Then', 'threw', 'kid', 'mix', 'Not', 'good', 'idea', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'happening', 'saw', 'coming', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'getting', 'much', 'attention', 'movie', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'plot', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'read', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'comics', 'kid', 'simply', 'sucked', 'even', 'more', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'had', 'be', 'apart', 'awfulness.Some', 'things', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'previews', 'were', 'were', 'cool', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'Ghost', 'rider', 'fire', 'chain', 'rapidly', 'coming', 'mouth', 'was', 'awesome', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'liked', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'guy', 'hospital', 'corporate', 'Being', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Blaze', 'just', 'started', 'going', 'crazy', 'transforming', 'back', 'forth', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'also', 'thought', 'camera', 'views', 'were', 'nice', 'could', 'tell', 'director', 'put', 'lot', 'work', 'that.My', 'final', 'rating', 'movie', 'going', 'be', '4', '10', 'extremely', 'low', 'rating', 'very', 'rare', 'rate', 'movies', 'low', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'right', 'there', 'Do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'anything', 'super', 'curious', 'big', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'fan', 'have', 'blessing', 'catch', 'Netflix', 'borrow', 'one', 'friends', 'friends', 'collect', 'enough', 'nerve', 'purchase']",N/A

Idris Elba is always welcome as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, the tone of this movie is much darker - less Disney-esque - and a tiny bit gruesome, but that is Ghost Rider!  It is based on a comic-book, but this is not a super-hero.  Vengeance is not optional.  Justice is preferred, but not mandatory.The most under-rated performance in the movie is Johnny Whitworth.  Perhaps best known for Empire Records, he plays against type as one of the villains, Ray Carrigan, and he is amazing.  He makes decisions with the role that makes him scarier than he is written.  There is a casual evil to his performance that was wildly successful.  It reminds me of Nick Cassavetes role of Packard in The Wraith plus a dash of Vincent Ventresca.Watch this.

They even nick cage to act in a most nutty way. This was a disaster for this franchise. The ghost rider is not a campy , nutty character.  I did like the explosive action in this though but you should never encourage nick cage to go over the top, unless it's a scene or two and not every line. In the really good 'vampires' kiss' movie it worked because the character was going mad. (That's a nick cage flick from the 80's). But not in this one. The first movie was played more serious. Now if the Ghost Rider was a character that is going mad then all the weird and wacky scenes might work, but he's not , he's tormented and dark. Well we got wacky here. still this is a high budget movie and not the worst movie ever made. Seriously , people who say that have not seen the many b movies I have, or c movies, or d movies. NOthing is as bad a d movie. (people with camera and no experience), this is rather a schlocky version of the ghost rider and that's a shame.  There is a documentary on this one and some previews. The villain here was a good one , a carrion man, but they did a strange bubble effect that wasn't needed when he attacks. This movie may have ended the careers of the filmmakers, It's happened before. But they do make some good action camp flicks. They just weren't real fans of the ghost rider probably. Comics are cool and these guys strayed into a rather comedic approach sometimes.  Buy this for the great 3d conversion. And it does look great. Unlike lets say 'I robot'.

I would ask and the answer was generally the same ( I don't sell enough of them ) . I have some of those comics and when comics became an investment I tried to cash them in . You know what, they were not worth anything. Some are retailed at two to three hundred now but that is only since the movies.Anyone who reads books and then watches a movie based on that literature will say it is not as good as the book. Screen plays are not books and movies have to appeal to a large audience to break even. They are supposed to make money and of course this franchise Does. This , a good movie visually and the 3- D is pretty good on my home screen works for me. The story is secondary to the action as it should be in this type of film. I enjoyed it as I did the first mostly because it is not the comic book which is in no way literature . The writers and illustrators never claimed they were. True to the character is fine by that characters fans but truth is Ghost rider has always had a limited fan base and I am sure there are those who see the movies , buy a comic and are disappointed .  I think old fans of the comic see or imagine ourselves as lone wolves like the Rider and probably should not criticize .

This movie should have had more ties to the first since that one had a much better story, and again...it really didn't.  Ultimately, if I wasn't a huge fan of Ghost Rider I would've never seen this in theater or bought the bluray (so I guess they win since I did still buy the bluray).Another disappointment was Best Buy had an exclusive steel book case if you reserved your copy early.  I reserved mine as soon as it was available and there was supposed to be combo disc sets as there are with most movies these days.  When I went to buy the movie I was told that it was a last minute change by the company to make more money by only selling individual discs...WTH?  My kids follow my lead and look up to me and they like most of the same things I do.  I am a huge Ghost Rider fan, so they follow suit.  How disappointed they were to see the bluray didn't come w/ a DVD copy for them to watch in their room.  Another disappointment since there is no way I would ever pay double the cost for this movie.  I will have to wait for it to join part 1 int he $5.00 DVD bin before they ever get a copy to watch on their DVD players...what a let down.",3,Ghost Rider is awesome!!!,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2442,"['Okay', 'am', 'going', 'try', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'parts', 'story', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'case', 'actually', 'buy', 'film.Ghost', 'Rider', 'best', 'comic', 'character', 'ever', 'being', 'said', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'am', 'huge', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'fan', 'movie', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Moreau', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'Carion', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'extreme', 'acting', 'jittering', 'around', 'even', 'mother', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Sony', 'screwed', 'movie', 'up', 'so', 'bad', 'changing', 'Danny', 'story', 'line', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'made', 'Spirit', 'Vengeance', 'comic', 'line', 'w/', 'Blaze', 'losing', 'most', 'power', 'still', 'helping', 'out', 'new', 'rider', 'Danny', 'becoming', 'new', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'lead', 'future', 'movies', 'instead', 'came', 'out', 'mixed', 'up', 'decayed', 'script', 'filming', 'was', 'ultimate', 'failure', 'Ghost', 'Rider', ""n't"", 'levitate', ""n't"", 'drive', 'crappy', 'looking', 'bike', 'biker', 'gear/clothes', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'burnt', 'marshmellows', 'would', 'direction', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'made', 'people', 'did', 'Crank', 'movie', 'Crank', 'love', 'Crank', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'do', 'comic', 'movie', 'too', 'jittery', 'way', 'too', 'often', 'movie', 'made', 'cheesy', 'lame', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'ties', 'first', 'one', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'again', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ultimately', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'would', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'theater', 'bought', 'bluray', 'guess', 'win', 'did', 'still', 'buy', 'bluray', '.Another', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Best', 'Buy', 'had', 'exclusive', 'steel', 'book', 'case', 'reserved', 'copy', 'early', 'reserved', 'mine', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'available', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'combo', 'disc', 'sets', 'are', 'most', 'movies', 'days', 'When', 'went', 'buy', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'change', 'company', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'only', 'selling', 'individual', 'discs', 'WTH', 'kids', 'follow', 'lead', 'look', 'up', 'like', 'most', 'same', 'things', 'do', 'am', 'huge', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'fan', 'follow', 'suit', 'How', 'disappointed', 'were', 'see', 'bluray', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'w/', 'DVD', 'copy', 'watch', 'room', 'disappointment', 'way', 'would', 'ever', 'pay', 'double', 'cost', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'join', 'part', '1', 'int', '5.00', 'DVD', 'bin', 'ever', 'get', 'copy', 'watch', 'DVD', 'players', 'what', 'let', 'down']",N/A

1465850,A3IYSIAKYOMKTO,B005LAIGWS,Renter,"[0, 1]","This sequel opens cold with several different groups trying to gain or retain custody of a special child. Why is he special? I don't think I'm spoiling it for you to state that he's the devil's child. Watch for Anthony Stuart Head in a cameo as one of the monks guarding the child. One of the factions, represented by Idris Elba as a renegade priest, decides that the best way to track and protect the child is to bring the Ghost Rider in on the scene. He finds Johnny Blaze in a depression spiral, and disappointingly there is no explanation provided as to how he wound up separated from his compadres in the first movie. Moreau (Elba) convinces Johnny to find and protect the child, both for the child's sake and his own - he promises Johnny that he knows how to remove the curse of the Ghost Rider for good. The rest of the flick is a series of chase scenes, battle scenes, back stabbing and bonding interludes. Cage hams it up, clearly having some fun with the B movie tropes and some of the more overwrought dialogue. Elba is excellent and gets plenty of screen time, and Johnny Whitworth provides plenty of comic relief and not a little menace as the secondary antagonist. Ciaran Hinds is woefully underused as the main antagonist. I understand you don't want to pull out that big gun until you're darn good and ready, but he really needed more to do. Violante Placido and Fergus Riordan are fine as the mother and child at the center of the action. There are a lot of amusing visual touches that remind the viewer that this movie is based on a comic book, and there's a bit of a revelation as to exactly what the Ghost Rider really is.

It had exactly what I wanted, a lot of action and it was fast paced and to me the Ghost Rider was a lot creepier in this movie than in the first. I get why people complained about the acting, I personally only had a problem with Ciaran Hinds who played the devil. His character was very corny, but Nicolas Cage's acting reminded me a lot of how he performed in Face Off which again did not personally bother me. I also agree the kid he is protecting and his mother were not interesting characters but I was glad not only was she not a love interest but the Ghost Rider wanted to kill her, interesting take on the female character in this movie.I hope as this comes out on video more people see it and enjoy it as much as I did. as I stated I do understand the critisizms but if you just watch it for an enjoyable action movie and some interesting humor it is pretty good.

They made Spirt of Vengeance!Okay, I saw this movie and it didn't make sense based from the first movie. The first movie ended with Johnny wanting to keep his powers and didn't want to give them up to the devil. The the devil wanted to take his powers away because he did a good job and he didn't need to have the curse anymore. Well, in this movie he is trying to get rig of his powers and is the exact opposite of what he wanted to do before? What? What a changed!If Johnny didn't want his power anymore, he could had just went to the devil and say, hey, I don't want the powers anymore, you can have them back! The devil will take them back with ease. The devils wants the powers back, it's not like he wants ghost rider to get in the way anyways. But, no that's doesn't come to mind in the writers mind at all huh.In the ending of the first movie it looked like Johnny had control over his powers and would only grow stronger with them. But that didn't come to the writers mind either. So, in this movie, he is losing control has loss control because he kept the ghost rider from coming out for so long. It just doesn't make sense.I really didn't like the fight scenes in this movie. They looked so lame. I actually like the first movie fights more and that is a under statement already.Spoiler Alert!!!If I get over the story from the beginning and totally forget it then it's okay after that. The Ghosts Riders trys to save a boy from bad men and if his does he will get his curse lifted from him. Johnny learns that the Ghost Rider gets his powers from an angel that got drag to hell and became a prisoner there. The angel grew more and more twisted the longer he was there. Then, the angel wasn't a angel anymore and become a spirt. That is, the spirt of vengeance. After some time, the devil will use this spirt powers to put into people and that person is the ghost rider. Johnny after losing powers of course needs his powers again because he not strong enough to fighter bad guys without his powers. So, it turns out that the boy he saved is the devil son and he gives johnny his powers back.One more thing I should point out.

A believable film about a guy with his head on fire.  Somehow, I don't think believable is what we should be looking for.Coherency would be admirable, and, unlike some other reviewers, I thought this installment of Ghost Rider made perfect sense within the logic of its own universe.  Cage as Blaze is enlisted to help protect the Devil's son, whom old Scratch needs as a new vessel for his powers; and the only ones that seem capable of stopping the transfer is an assembly of coven-like monks led by Christopher Lambert (Ha!) - but they need the help of the Ghost Rider to do it.  In exchange for his help, they'll exorcize the Ghost Rider demon for him, once the Devil gets his due.  As one might guess from thousands of other movies, that deal is probably not going to work out, and in the end, Blaze is forced to re-rent the spare room in his head to the demon in order to save the day.I get it.  In fact, I saw most of it coming once the parameters of the movie were established at about the thirty minute mark.  But there's a sort of manic energy about the whole thing that made it fairly entertaining.  That, and the fact that the film got such poor reviews that my expectations were flatlined.  Reading other reviews, it seems that either people don't like that this (sort of) sequel departs from the tone of the first, or that it doesn't conform to their idea of the source material, or that there's a kind of 'piling on' now that it seems safe to pan the flick.  I think the second reason is the only one that might hold water - if you've been following this character for years, I think you have a right to expect certain things.  You're the reason the franchise ever got off the ground in the first place.I never really got into the whole Blaze character before, and thought that the first flick really dumbed down a bare-bones (ha again!) concept in the first place.  This one goes darker, albeit at the expense of much character development.  I like the drunken priest Moreau (Idris Elba, also known as Heimdall in the Thor franchise) best here - everyone else is pretty much cardboard.  So, thread-bare characters, threadbare plot, lots of crazy energy.  Pretty much like any other empty-headed action flick.

1465882,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGWS,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[15, 20]","No other character in the Marvel Universe is more suited to the manic, bipolar antics of Nicolas Cage than the Ghost Rider, which is why the 2007 film turned out to be so disappointing. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson with all the flair of dry toast, all of Ghost Rider's most unique genre attributes were frittered away in a bland attempt to follow in the phenomenal success of Batman Begins. With Johnson mostly out of the picture, the rapidly produced sequel gets a much needed fuel injection with the twin duo of Neveldine/Taylor behind the camera, bringing with them the same chaotic energy that led them to success with both Crank movies.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a more complicated beast, and for the most part Neveldine/Taylor are up to the challenge.  More in tune with the character's dark, pulpy roots, the supernatural grindhouse feel will be a welcome reminder to fans of Cage's underrated Drive Angry.  After a brilliant, Mignola-esque animated sequence zipping us through Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil that transformed him into the Ghost Rider, we learn he's been hiding out from civilization out in eastern Europe. His hopes of keeping the demon inside him locked away are quickly dashed with the arrival of Moreau(Idris Elba), a gun toting, hard drinking warrior monk who warns him of the Devil's(Ciaran Hinds) plan to attain a new host body. To do it, he'll enlist another damned soul named Carrigan(Johnny Whitworth) to kidnap the son of Nadya(Violante Placido), a woman he also struck an ill pact with. The Devil is a hell of salesman, apparently. He's always closing. The promise of eternal redemption is all Blaze needs to sign on for his most dangerous mission yet, playing the unfamiliar role of protector.With a trimmed down budget, this version of Ghost Rider has a tougher, meaner look to it. The lack of polish makes the flame-headed biker all the more visceral and terrifying, especially when he's got some poor thug in the grip of his soul destroying ""Penance Stare"". The action scenes should be where the film really shines, but unfortunately the directors don't go far enough. While some of it is pretty awesome to behold, like when Ghost Rider jumps in a giant construction vehicle and lights it with hellfire, others are uninspiring.  Undoubtedly they've got a better grip on what makes the character tic, but you expect Neveldine/Taylor to go absolutely ape dump on a movie like this, and sometimes it feels like they held back.Essentially shot in exactly the same manner as Crank, it's when the Ghost Rider is on the open road that are the brightest spots. Sure it's a little dizzying with all the jump cuts, speed ramps and other crazy camera tricks the directors typically employ, but it works to give the film a distinctive look. Even during the rare times when the action slows down, there is rarely a dull moment. A self aware sense of humor, such as when Ghost Rider starts urinating hellfire, occasionally works but often feels a little forced.Cage gives the sort of performance you'd expect for a movie this insane. He's constantly ""on"", flashing his teeth at every opportunity and always looking as if he's about to snap and jump off the cliff or something. While that may not work as often as he employs it, that's exactly the mode Cage needed to be in for this role. What's more entertaining is Idris Elba, who appears to be trying to match Cage for scene chewing honors. His chatty, wobbly Moreau is a total 180 from the strong and silent guardian he played in Thor.While it's not a great movie, fans of Ghost Rider will leave the theater far happier than they did five years ago. There's still a better film to be made, and perhaps it'll happen in a few years with a slightly better script. Ghost Rider isn't ready to ride off into the sunset just yet.",3,Fans of the character will love it.

There is little action, and what there is is visually dull. The rest of the movie is sitting around and talking.All I wanted from this movie was some cool chase sequences, fights, and explosions. It turns out that all the good moments fit into the trailer. The car chases are dull. Ghost Rider mostly stands around rather than fights, and when he does fight it's not exciting.

1465884,A2N60VDBR10N18,B005LAIGWS,Tyler Johnson,"[2, 4]","I won't waste your time comparing this travesty to the even worse previous film. I'm just going to jump right into why this film isn't worth your time. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a total mess. The story is paper thin and poorly told. You won't know whats going on until well after the first hour, and even then whats happening isn't very interesting. Nicholas Cage is given a lot of crap for this performance and, while he is moderately terrible, it isn't entirely his fault. This movies dialogue is atrocious, sounding stiff and unnatural the entire way through. No one is given anything remotely interesting to say, so why is there so much talking?If all that wasn't bad enough the one reason anyone might want to see this film, the Rider itself, is terribly mishandled. Though the directors were clearly going for a darker, more brutal Rider, this one just comes off as spastic and goofy. Cheesy camera tricks, and the Riders laughable roaring kill any chance of the character actually being threatening. while the effects for the rider are greatly improved over the previous film, all it does is turn people to ash. While that may sound cool, it happens so quickly it loses any impact it might have had otherwise.Now for the few good parts: The fantastic Idris Elba is the only likeable character in the film, but unfortunately is not given nearly enough screen time. The main antagonist, not Roark but Carrigan, early on was very impressive as a villain. In the previous film, the antagonists were pasty emo nothings that put me to sleep, so I was very impressed to see the film give a plain old vanilla mortal the chance to show that he could take on the rider; and then half way through he is transformed into a pasty, emo villain.Nothing about this film works. The action is clunky and unsatisfying. The story is pitifully anemic and goes nowhere. Nick Cage hams it up for all he's worth, killing any chance at a mood, and the Rider is a twitchy, boring mess. Unless you are a die hard Ghost Rider fan, stay far away from this film. If you are a die hard Ghost Rider film, just read the comic, and stay far away from this film.

I really don't understand why this one is getting such bad reviews.  It has plenty of action, special effects and the same type humor as the first.  It is a sequel so it can't have the same story line as the first. I will admit I did like the first much better but usually sequels aren't as good as the first any way.  The character is still the same and at the end of the first he did say he was 'owning the power' so of course we expected a different story line.

This ""reboot"" (it's a reboot according to the directors not a sequel although if you've got the same actor playing the same role I'm a bit perplexed as to how it could be a reboot)""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" does have some moments of cheesy fun but it's mostly joyless compared to the first movie which at least had fun with the character (or at least more fun than what we see here).Johnny Blaze (Cage) gets roped into protecting the child of Satan with the promise that he will be cured of his afflication kissing the Ghost Rider goodbye. Predictably he finds that he needs the Ghost Rider just when he wants to get rid of him.""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" isn't the worst movie ever made but, like the ""Crank"" movies that these directors made, it isn't exactly a good movie or even decent. It IS fun seeing Nic Cage chew the scenery although it's almost to the point of badly overacting pushing the boundary even of the first film where he appears almost restrained by comparison.Some sequences take place (particularly the climax) during daytime and the Rider's only supposed to appear in darkness--I believe it's supposed to be dawn but it looks closer to late afternoon to me.Cage is matched for bad acting here by Ciran Hinds who is, well, just BAD. There's a lack of fun in his performance although it's clear he was trying to go for the cheesy over-the-top approach that Cage used, his role isn't quite as showy and he isn't given as much to work with which makes his portrayal as Satan  flatter by comparison.The Blu-ray looks quite nice--nice detail, sharp looking and the film which was shot digitally with a Red camera (I suppose you could call it beta testing since the camera hadn't even been released yet) gives the directors a bit more flexibility in shooting the movie. According to the featurette it allowed them to use traditional 35mm lens which probably complimented the look of the film.Audio is immersive and dialog is clear throughout. Subtitles are in English and Spanish and, like other Sony releases, the subtitles are placed on screen under the character saying the dialog which helps for those who are hard of hearing in keeping track of who is saying what.The special features include featurettes on the decision to reboot--the departure point was a David Goyer script that was written BEFORE the first ""Ghost Rider"" film. The directors liked the elements and it was rewritten by Goyer with a pair of writers that worked on ""Flash Forward"" the TV show. We also learn WHY the film was shot in Eastern Europe and the challenges (including the destruction of an abandoned factory that they were going to shoot at but were assured would still be there when they returned)of shooting on location including the disconnect between local government and their liaison). We also get behind-the-scenes footage that's quite interesting documenting the issues they faced (including shooting on a bridge that was supposed to be blocked off for a stunt but had heavy traffic during the entire shoot).We also get some deleted and extended scenes that wouldn't have added all that much to the movie but are interesting to see.""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" surely was one of the worst popcorn movies of this year. The film lacks the cheesy over-the-top badness of the first movie and the smaller production suffers by comparison compared to the firsts film (which was epic by comparison).

I can't really write a fair review of a character and franchise that Marvel seems to be putting enough money into but not enough heart. This movie suffers from Nick Cage delivery issues at the most. The plot is super predictable and the action is pretty contrived but, the movie looks amazing. The rider always looks menacing and powerful, which is a much needed improvement from the original.
