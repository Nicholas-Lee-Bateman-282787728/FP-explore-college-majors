I can't wait for June 11th to come.  Unfortunately I know I'll miss some of the later episodes, so I'll have to assume season 2 will appear on DVD, too.  This DVD transfer is given in wide-screen - it wasn't shown that way on Family channel.  Despite some quibbles from other reviewers, I don't find the slightly prominent sexual situations (shown or talked about in later episodes) to be done in anything other than a tasteful way.  Matt Dallas is wonderful as Kyle.  But then, he's surrounded by a whole cast of good actors.  Jean-Luc's libido seems to be going over time, and Olivero as Declan is really well carved out.  The ending definitely points to season two.  It was my second viewing (on DVD) that finally made me realize that ""Adam"" is the guy who visits Kyle in the church.Do I have ANY quibbles myself?  Yes.  I could have done without the constant introductions and endings of each episode.  I would also have liked to see the credits in something other than the teenee scrawl on the left of the screen.  For the record, ""extended"" final episode amounts to about one minute added footage.  The original pilot has mostly the same stuff, but with a few alternate scenes of interest.  Matt Dallas, who ""narrates"" the film, too, is not the narrator in the original pilot, and the jarring difference is troublesome.  Thenk goodness they changed that.

1059042,A2XS4FA5WGO5KR,B000NOKFGW,annonymous_man,"[8, 28]","I love Kyle XY -- I bought and downloaded all the season 1 episodes from the iTunes Store to my Mac Mini's iTunes Library (that's right I now use Mac computers after switching a few years back from Windows world and have an Intel compatible Mac Mini) and transfered over to my 80 GB video iPod. I am planning to buy an Apple TV in the near future and my first HDTV shortly afterward -- I bought it on iTunes because of convenience the store provides, I don't have to go to a video store to buy it on location and don't have to pay shipping and handling charges for ordering home delivery -- also up till now Kyle XY has only been available on iTunes -- no DVD (other shows I bought on iTunes because of cheaper pricing than DVDs or because DVDs released for such shows were theme DVDs with only few episodes -- imagine if Buena Vista Home Entertainment had released a theme DVD with only the first 5 episodes of Kyle XY but the entire first season all 10 episodes were on iTunes -- that's not fair to fans who want the DVD -- also if you buy the DVD you have more rights to the content -- can back up a copy of the videos to your hard drive, convert it for your video iPod etc or play it on your television via your DVD Player, whereas videos bought on the iTunes Store are copy protected with DRM restrictions that cannot be easily removed. Also if you buy the DVD you get bonus features not included in a video on demand (VOD based iTunes purchase) so downloaded video has less advantages than disadvantages but to some until they try video on demand downloads unless they have read the pros and cons in advance they won't know about these issues. Misinformation is the enemy of anti-DRM activists -- the more consumers are informed the less they will support such systems and support content that is not copy protected.Buying video on iTunes has some advantages but after a thorough analysis and comprehensive review of the situation I find buying the DVD to be a better choice.

1059043,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B000NOKFGW,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[0, 0]","I've been watching so many other ABC Family shows so I figured I'd give it a shot. Plus, the entire series is up on hulu, which is a huge plus.Kyle XY tells the story of a teenage boy who wakes up in the middle of the woods with no clothes and no memories. He's taken in by a psychologist, her husband, and two kids (Josh and Lori) who slowly teach him how to fit in with regular society (he lacks all semblance of social skills, originally even lacking speech, though he learns this quickly). The series follows Kyle as he adjusts to life as a regular teenager and tries to discover the secrets of his past.In the beginning, I was somewhat disappointed:As a general rule, I dislike voiceovers. For them to be worthwhile, they have to be both informative and used sparingly. otherwise they become irritating. A good example of well used VOs is Grey's Anatomy: they lead you in with cues of what the characters are struggling with and ends with what they've taken from the cases they've dealt with. A poor example of VOs would be Sex in the City where they continue throughout the show, are rarely informative, and are mostly redundant with exactly what you will see in a second. In Kye XY, the voiceover is mostly redundant. We can see that Kyle doesn't know how to answer the history questions, we don't need him to tell us that.The entire gimmick of the show is that Kyle is not normal (he has no navel, he woke up in the middle of nowhere with no clothes, he remembers nothing but feels most comfortable sleeping in a bathtub, he's freakishly smart). And while we do see a lot of Kyle being unfamiliar with the world around him, in five episodes we have yet to see or hear any possible hints towards his origins. Instead, the drama around him is learning to become part of high school (which because of his voiceover is less funny or more solemn) and worrying about a murder that he may or may not have witnessed.As far as a show about normal teenagers trying to navigate through high school goes, the show does a decent job. It's certainly nothing special. Just the standard teen issues of finding friends, dealing with ""the chill,"" and trying not to look stupid in front of friends...Though the first few episodes were slow and un""Kylie-history"" related, it really picked up from there. They began delving into Kyle's background, explaining Tom, the Professor, etc. In fact, I would argue it got a little ahead of itself since it basically solved all the mysteries by the end of the first season. And the last couple are answered quite casually (ie- lack of navel and lack of memories) by the end of the season two premier, leaving little else for us to wonder about.Not to say there isn't more happening, as we already know that Kyle is no longer one of a kind and depending where his ""sibling"" (taking a cue from Dark Angel here, where all the mutants consider each other siblings) ends up, their interaction could be a lot of fun. But unless they don't see each other for a while, Kyle and family should easily recognize someone whose story and behavior is just like his. But maybe the upgraded super-baby is smarter or learns faster? What if the ""sibling"" is taken in by someone who hates the Tagers?My other complaint would be that while Lori and Josh took center stage the first few episodes, they've taken a total back seat since, largely because Kyle doesn't include them in his mysteries and their social problems have resolved themselves. I hope one way or another the two get brought in more. Well, that and I don't care for the mother all that much. She doesn't really do anything but ignore her kids and obsess over Kyle (and not just when he leaves to go with his ""parents."")",4,A Slow Start But Builds Stronger,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,3694,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'ABC', 'Family', 'so', 'figured', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', 'entire', 'series', 'up', 'hulu', 'huge', 'plus.Kyle', 'XY', 'story', 'teenage', 'boy', 'who', 'up', 'middle', 'woods', 'clothes', 'memories', 'taken', 'psychologist', 'husband', 'two', 'kids', 'Josh', 'Lori', 'who', 'slowly', 'teach', 'how', 'fit', 'regular', 'society', 'semblance', 'social', 'skills', 'originally', 'even', 'lacking', 'speech', 'quickly', 'series', 'Kyle', 'life', 'regular', 'teenager', 'tries', 'discover', 'secrets', 'past.In', 'beginning', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'general', 'rule', 'dislike', 'voiceovers', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'be', 'informative', 'used', 'sparingly', 'otherwise', 'become', 'irritating', 'good', 'example', 'well', 'used', 'VOs', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'lead', 'cues', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'struggling', 'what', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'cases', ""'ve"", 'dealt', 'poor', 'example', 'VOs', 'would', 'be', 'Sex', 'City', 'where', 'continue', 'show', 'are', 'rarely', 'informative', 'are', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'second', 'Kye', 'XY', 'voiceover', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'can', 'see', 'Kyle', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'answer', 'history', 'questions', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'that.The', 'entire', 'gimmick', 'show', 'Kyle', 'not', 'normal', 'navel', 'woke', 'up', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'clothes', 'nothing', 'most', 'comfortable', 'sleeping', 'bathtub', 'freakishly', 'smart', 'do', 'see', 'lot', 'Kyle', 'being', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'five', 'episodes', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'hear', 'possible', 'hints', 'origins', 'Instead', 'drama', 'learning', 'become', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'voiceover', 'less', 'funny', 'more', 'solemn', 'worrying', 'murder', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'witnessed.As', 'far', 'show', 'normal', 'teenagers', 'trying', 'navigate', 'high', 'school', 'show', 'decent', 'job', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'special', 'Just', 'standard', 'teen', 'issues', 'finding', 'friends', 'dealing', 'chill', 'trying', 'not', 'look', 'stupid', 'front', 'friends', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'slow', 'un', 'Kylie-history', 'related', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'there', 'began', 'delving', 'Kyle', 'background', 'explaining', 'Tom', 'Professor', 'etc', 'fact', 'would', 'argue', 'got', 'little', 'ahead', 'basically', 'solved', 'mysteries', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'last', 'couple', 'are', 'answered', 'quite', 'casually', 'ie-', 'lack', 'navel', 'lack', 'memories', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'premier', 'leaving', 'little', 'else', 'wonder', 'about.Not', 'say', ""n't"", 'more', 'happening', 'already', 'know', 'Kyle', 'no', 'longer', 'one', 'kind', 'depending', 'where', 'sibling', 'taking', 'cue', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'here', 'where', 'mutants', 'consider', 'other', 'siblings', 'up', 'interaction', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'while', 'Kyle', 'family', 'should', 'easily', 'recognize', 'someone', 'story', 'behavior', 'just', 'maybe', 'upgraded', 'super-baby', 'smarter', 'faster', 'What', 'sibling', 'taken', 'someone', 'who', 'Tagers', 'other', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'Lori', 'Josh', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'total', 'back', 'seat', 'largely', 'Kyle', ""n't"", 'include', 'mysteries', 'social', 'problems', 'have', 'resolved', 'hope', 'one', 'way', 'two', 'get', 'brought', 'more', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'mother', 'much', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'ignore', 'kids', 'obsess', 'Kyle', 'not', 'just', 'when', 'go', 'parents']",Kyle XY: Season 1

It tastes wonderful, even if it isn't any good for you.Not that Kyle XY isn't good - it is. It's just not great, not by any standards. It can't be - not when a purportedly superb psychologist (Nicole Trager, played well and with loving sympathy by Marguerite MacIntyre) decides to leave her teenaged, irresponsible children in charge of watching someone she's just brought home from a juvenile detention center. Or any of the incredibly stupid decisions that Nicole and Stephen Trager (his ""foster"" parents) make that put Kyle in harm's way during the first few episodes.While watching all ten episodes, I was able to point to at least five things *per episode* that no reasonable person would have done regarding Kyle - and it's not limited to the Trager's. The involvement of the police is, well, just abominable.But there's a neat little mystery. Kyle woke up naked in the middle of a forest, and wandered into civilization, not remembering anything that happened to him prior to that point. He is the quintessential blank slate - except that he has remarkable ""powers"". He can read an entire set of encyclopedias in a day, solve impossibly difficult math problems in ten minutes, hit every basket he shoots, and fight/defend himself with a defense that Floyd Mayweather would envy (Mayweather's the guy who recently beat Oscar De La Hoya, mostly because Oscar couldn't find Mayweather, and had one heck of a time hitting someone who wasn't in the same place that he was when Oscar's punch launched). There seems to be no end to what Kyle can't do - other than remember anything about his past.One puzzle that should have drawn much more interest by doctors than it did is Kyle's lack of a bellybutton. It separates him from everyone else.But for all of Kyle's extraordinary talents, he is remarkably human. He seems to know the difference between right and wrong, and he can love and feel. In many ways, he is more human, and certainly more moral than most of the people his age.I've poked some fun at the show here, and that might belie the 4-star rating I gave it. For all of the shows ineptness, it's immensely watchable, and Kyle (played by Matt ""yes this is my real name"" Dallas) is so likeable. You have to root for the guy - he's a genius who walks around looking utterly clueless most of the time. I have to wonder, though, if that's Dallas's real expression, or if it's ""acting"". From photos I saw on imdb.com, it seems to be the former.Still, thumbs up.

The  similarities to John Doe seem rampant at this point, but it's only the beginning of the pilot episode and the similarities begin to diverge from there.  He cannot talk and doesn't know anything about ""acceptable"" social behavior.  (If you've seen John Doe you know that he discovers in the first episode that he can speak just about any language and knows perfectly well how to behave with other people.)Of course, Kyle ends up in a juvenile detention center of some kind and a child psychologist is called in.  Mrs. Trager immediately feels that Kyle requires full-time attention and gets permission to bring him into her home in a fostering situation.Kyle thrives in this environment - despite the two teenage children of Mrs. Trager, and the mild objections of Mr. Trager at the wife bringing her work home with her.  The kids believe him to be very strange, (not the least of which is his absence of a belly button) which is true, but we can see that Kyle has a basic goodness in him that is very endearing.

1059070,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000NOKFGW,Robert Moore,"[6, 7]","Warning!  Spoilers ahead!Kaspar Hauser was a sixteen year old boy who appeared out of nowhere in early 19th century Nuremberg, Germany, barely able to walk or use his hands and with virtually no ability to speak.  There are startling similarities between Kaspar and Kyle, who likewise is roughly sixteen and initially has limited control of his body and no ability to speak.  Unlike Kaspar Hauser, Kyle proves to have an extraordinary capacity to learn, quickly mastering both his body and huge bodies of human knowledge.  And also unlike Kaspar, who never learned the secret of his origins (because he was assassinated some speculate that he may have been the offspring of a royal house--why would people go through a great deal of trouble to kill a mere peasant?), Kyle eventually learns the secret of who he is and where he came from.  At that point, as viewers of the first season will be aware, the story starts to veer over more towards DARK ANGEL, both in the sense that like Max Guevera Kyle was made rather than born.  That is not really much of a spoiler.  One of the first things we learn about Kyle is that he does not possess a belly button, leading to the rather obvious conclusion that he was never born as humans normally are.  Other parallels to DARK ANGEL will emerge in Season Two, but the most obvious resemblance between the two shows, apart from a similarity in origins, is that both series are set in Seattle but filmed in Vancouver.The series begins with Kyle, covered with strange goo, waking up naked in the woods.  After he walks in a completely natural state into the nearby city and is placed in a juvenile detention center, the police contact a psychologist, Nicole Trager, to solicit her help in assessing Kyle.  Sensing that the juvenile center is not really appropriate for him she takes him to her home in order to serve as a temporary foster situation.  There he gets to know the other Tragers, including Nicole's husband Stephen and their two children Lori and Josh.  Much of Season One consists not only of Kyle learning to function in society but in establishing a home with the Tragers.  This continues a now-established tradition of focusing in series on what has come to be known as ""chosen families.""  It has appeared in series after series in the past decade or so.  Many have commented in regard to Admiral Adama's relationship to the various women in his command on his various ""daughters.""  But perhaps no series ever stated the theme so explicitly as BUFFY in the episode ""Family,"" in which Tara's father, brother, and cousin come to force her to return with them to their home.  When Buffy makes it known that she would not allow them to take Tara the father asks who they were to stand in the way of them, her blood kin.  ""We're family,"" she replies.  The ongoing theme through a number of shows is that the families we chose to be a part of are sometimes more important than mere blood ties.In terms of action, not a lot happens in Season One.  Most of the focus is on Kyle learning about himself, about the world, and exploring relationships with others.  Besides the Tragers, he nurses a crush on Amanda, the girl who lives just down the street from the Tragers, and Declan, Lori's bad boy boyfriend, who gradually throughout the season becomes both less bad and an increasingly important friend to Kyle.  We also get to see an ever-expanding number of oddities about Kyle.  For instance, his ability to master any physical activity in a matter of minutes, or his propensity for sleeping in a bathtub (we find out why in Season Two), or his off the chart mathematical ability, or his ability to read any book in seconds.  And through it all, we are conscious of a mysterious individual whom we see kill one person and suspect has killed another.  We eventually learn his name is Foss and that precisely who he is demands a more complex answer than we assumed.  Foss is, by the way, played by Nicholas Lea, best known for his role as Alex Krycek on THE X-FILES.Although the show has many strong positives, without the marvelous work of Matt Dallas in the title role the show simply wouldn't work.  Dallas manages to imbue Kyle with both a sense of wonder and a feeling of often being lost and at sea.  It is a part that would be easy to mess up, but luckily he strikes the right balance between odd and being brilliant.I have to confess a special love for shows made in Vancouver.  More and more in recent years Hollywood has chosen to film series in Vancouver.  Partly the reason is that it is cheaper to shoot there, partly it is because there is a different kind of terrain there than in Los Angeles, and partly it is because an enormous number of actors have moved there to support the ever growing television industry there.  But although there are a lot of fine actors there, sometimes it feels as if there is just one large theater troupe, and they merely shift from one series to another as needed.  For instance, taking just two examples from KYLE XY, Amanda's mother is played by Teryl Rothery.  She played a nurse in a memorable episode of THE X-FILES from the years it was filmed in Vancouver, as well as a real estate agent both in SMALLVILLE and in DEAD LIKE ME (I have to say, the house the Tragers live in feels like it has to be in the same neighborhood as the house George's family lived in on that show), and many other series such as DA VINCI'S INQUEST, COLD CASE, and THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW.  And she is certainly best known for having played Dr. Janet Fraiser for many seasons on STARGATE SG-1.  Eileen Pedde, who plays the professor Kyle, Lori, and Declan meet when he goes to the University of Washington, has a recurring role in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as a marine sergeant, but has appeared on a host of other Vancouver series, including SMALLVILLE, THE DEAD ZONE, STARGATE SG-1, DARK ANGEL, THE X-FILES, and MILLENNIUM.  If you watch SMALLVILLE, DARK ANGEL, THE L WORD, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, SUPERNATURAL, the STARGATE series, HOUSE, DEAD LIKE ME, THE 4400 and all the other Vancouver shows, you will see the same performers crop up with vastly more frequency than in those filmed in Hollywood.I highly recommend this series.  It tells a compelling story of a highly likable and sympathetic main character with finely scripted and executed stories.  The show may at times feel a bit familiar.  Certainly parts of the story bear similarities to any of a dozen or so shows of the past, but still they manage to blend all the elements together in a truly wonderful way.",5,If you combined the story of Kaspar Hauser with DARK ANGEL you'd get this,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,6539,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'Kaspar', 'Hauser', 'was', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'appeared',

""Kyle XY"" is about a mysterious guy that questions everything around him, as if he was a animal or a new born child. Even though he's very new to the world, he's already a adult, he also haves great gifts like jumping off tall buildings without getting hurt, playing Basketball better than a professional player does and swimming like dolphins. Kyle can also hear through walls & read people's lips from far away. That's just the beginning of the story, even though these things are impressive to the people around him including his adoptive family, nobody knows about his past, not even Kyle knows. After clues such as familiar people & symbols start popping up, his memory starts coming back. I'm not going to give to much away because I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen the show. I will say that ""Kyle XY"" answers questions while making more of them for the audience watching at home.

1059077,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000NOKFGW,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","Kyle XY was the first successful original show on ABC family. Featuring cute boys, which played right into their key demographic of teenage girls. Kyle woke up having no memory, like some big adorable baby. Not wanting the show to be some cutesy messed up version of the Brady Bunch, the producers actually gave the show a complicated storyline, which made it much better, but also led to it's downfall. The series starts when Kyle wakes up naked in the woods outside of Seattle. He has no memory and doesn't know how to do anything. He's quickly put into a group home, as a John Doe, where he gains the attention and admiration of the local psychologist, Nicole Trager (Marguerite MacIntyre). Trager knows that Kyle will never survive in that environment and decides to foster him. Once at the Trager house, Kyle doesn't need to just learn the basics of survival, but also the social norms associated with being part of a family. The series starts out with Kyle as a clean slate, having to learn everything from eating to using the bathroom, and to me this was the worst part of the show. It did however give the stations key demographic exactly what it demanded and lead to these episodes being the networks highest rated to date. Wanting to show off Kyle's abilities and not wanting him to be some loveable moron, the writers shifted the focus to Kyle's extraordinary abilities and how he uses them to try and find out who he is and where he came from. That's the point where the show started to get interesting to me and of course the point where the ratings started to decline. Show some trendy teenage girls, a bunch of cute boys being adorable and you've got high ratings, but show those same boys as part of a global conspiracy, that makes you think, and those girls want nothing to do with it. Half way through the first season, Kyle XY went from a lame family show to a terrific science fiction drama. Matt Dallas stars as Kyle and he has a lot going for him. Dallas is good looking, athletic, and intelligent, unfortunately he's not a very good actor and many times seemed like some emotionless robot, who was reading lines from a cue card. Thankfully the family and friends surrounding him were far better actors than he was. The Trager family is a terrific mix of wit and emotion that is centered on Kyle, but doesn't focus solely on him. There is a terrific storyline featuring the daughter Lori's (April Matson) entrance into sexual activity with her boyfriend Declin (Chris Olivero), who may be the single most talented person on this cast. The brother Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), gives much needed comic relief to the show, while teaching Kyle the things every teenaged boy needs to know. Kyle XY was a magically complex show that blended a great science fiction story with comedy and family drama, unfortunately it was on the wrong network. A show like this could have continued to grow and come out of nowhere to be a mix of the X-Files and 90210, that appealed to a huge audience, instead, it was geared toward teenage girls who just didn't want to think. The show was designed for a large audience on a network that has a very limited demographic. Ultimately the cute boys and the occasional comedy just wasn't enough to keep them interested and the show was canceled after 3 seasons. In my opinion this show was just starting to hit it's stride and should it have been on a network that appealed to a larger audience, it would probably still be on the air today.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,3482,"['Kyle', 'XY', 'was', 'first', 'successful', 'original', 'show', 'ABC', 'family', 'Featuring', 'cute', 'boys', 'played', 'right', 'key', 'demographic', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Kyle', 'woke', 'up', 'having', 'memory', 'big', 'adorable', 'baby', 'Not', 'wanting', 'show', 'be', 'cutesy', 'messed', 'up', 'version', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'producers', 'actually', 'gave', 'show', 'complicated', 'storyline', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'also', 'led', 'downfall', 'series', 'when', 'Kyle', 'up', 'naked', 'woods', 'Seattle', 'memory', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'anything', 'quickly', 'put', 'group', 'home', 'John', 'Doe', 'where', 'gains', 'attention', 'admiration', 'local', 'psychologist', 'Nicole', 'Trager', 'Marguerite', 'MacIntyre', 'Trager', 'Kyle', 'will', 'never', 'survive', 'environment', 'decides', 'foster', 'Once', 'Trager', 'house', 'Kyle', ""n't"", 'need', 'just', 'learn', 'basics', 'survival', 'also', 'social', 'norms', 'associated', 'being', 'part', 'family', 'series', 'out', 'Kyle', 'clean', 'slate', 'having', 'learn', 'everything', 'eating', 'using', 'bathroom', 'was', 'worst', 'part', 'show', 'did', 'however', 'give', 'stations', 'key', 'demographic', 'exactly', 'what', 'demanded', 'lead', 'episodes', 'being', 'networks', 'highest', 'rated', 'date', 'Wanting', 'show', 'off', 'Kyle', 'abilities', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'loveable', 'moron', 'writers', 'shifted', 'focus', 'Kyle', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'how', 'try', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'where', 'came', 'point', 'where', 'show', 'started', 'get', 'interesting', 'course', 'point', 'where', 'ratings', 'started', 'decline', 'Show', 'trendy', 'teenage', 'girls', 'bunch', 'cute', 'boys', 'being', 'adorable', ""'ve"", 'got', 'high', 'ratings', 'show', 'same', 'boys', 'part', 'global', 'conspiracy', 'think', 'girls', 'want', 'nothing', 'do', 'Half', 'way', 'first', 'season', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'went', 'lame', 'family', 'show', 'terrific', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'Matt', 'Dallas', 'Kyle', 'lot', 'going', 'Dallas', 'good', 'looking', 'athletic', 'intelligent', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'many', 'times', 'seemed', 'emotionless', 'robot', 'who', 'was', 'reading', 'lines', 'cue', 'card', 'Thankfully', 'family', 'friends', 'surrounding', 'were', 'far', 'better', 'actors', 'was', 'Trager', 'family', 'terrific', 'mix', 'wit', 'emotion', 'centered', 'Kyle', ""n't"", 'focus', 'solely', 'terrific', 'storyline', 'featuring', 'daughter', 'Lori', 'April', 'Matson', 'entrance', 'sexual', 'activity', 'boyfriend', 'Declin', 'Chris', 'Olivero', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'talented', 'person', 'cast', 'brother', 'Josh', 'Jean-Luc', 'Bilodeau', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'teaching', 'Kyle', 'things', 'teenaged', 'boy', 'needs', 'know', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'was', 'magically', 'complex', 'show', 'blended', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'comedy', 'family', 'drama', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'wrong', 'network', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'continued', 'grow', 'come', 'nowhere', 'be', 'mix', 'X-Files', '90210', 'appealed', 'huge', 'audience', 'instead', 'was', 'geared', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'designed', 'large', 'audience', 'network', 'very', 'limited', 'demographic', 'Ultimately', 'cute', 'boys', 'occasional', 'comedy', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'interested', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', '3', 'seasons', 'opinion', 'show', 'was', 'just', 'starting', 'hit', 'stride', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'network', 'appealed', 'larger', 'audience', 'would', 'probably', 'still', 'be', 'air', 'today']",Kyle XY: Season 1

But the promotional Campaign did its job correctly, because not only did `Kyle XY' because the most watched program to air on ABC Family, but was a rating powerhouse for ABC as well.From the very first moment when we meet Kyle, laying naked, scared, and alone in the middle of a Washington forest, till when he finds a family within the Tragger family and starts on his quest to find out where he came from - millions of people all around the World where hooked.Throughout the first season, the audience follows Kyle as he acclimates himself to a life without a memory in a foster-family in a new surroundings, to his discovery of just `how weird he is,' and initially to his quest to try and find his true parents and were he really came from, and why he is how he is.  But more than that Kyle is learning what it is like to be a teenager in the new millinum, going through all the same growing pains as his serogate siblings including crushes, puberty, school, and learning how to interact in a social world.""Kyle XY: The Complete First Season' comes with all 10 episodes on three discs with audio commentaries, deleted scenes, an alternate pilot, extended version of the season finale, and `secrets revealed' featurette, and is set to be released only a month prior to the second season premier.",5,Who is Kyle XY?,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1503,"['Kyle', 'XY', 'exploded', 'television', 'landscape', 'last', 'summer', 'months', 'singular', 'promotional', 'campaign', 'showing', 'naked', 'teen-age', 'boy', 'wondering', 'around', 'forest', 'tagline', 'who', 'kyle', 'xy', 'promotional', 'Campaign', 'did', 'job', 'correctly', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'most', 'watched', 'program', 'air', 'ABC', 'Family', 'was', 'rating', 'powerhouse', 'ABC', 'very', 'first', 'moment', 'when', 'meet', 'Kyle', 'laying', 'naked', 'scared', 'alone', 'middle', 'Washington', 'forest', 'till', 'when', 'family', 'Tragger', 'family', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'came', 'millions', 'people', 'World', 'where', 'hooked.Throughout', 'first', 'season', 'audience', 'Kyle', 'life', 'memory', 'foster-family', 'new', 'surroundings', 'discovery', 'just', 'how', 'weird', 'initially', 'quest', 'try', 'find', 'true', 'parents', 'were', 'really', 'came', 'why', 'how', 'more', 'Kyle', 'learning', 'what', 'be', 'teenager', 'new', 'millinum', 'going', 'same', 'growing', 'pains', 'serogate', 'siblings', 'including', 'crushes', 'puberty', 'school', 'learning', 'how', 'interact', 'social', 'world', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '10', 'episodes', 'three', 'discs', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'pilot', 'extended', 'version', 'season', 'finale', 'secrets', 'revealed', 'featurette', 'set', 'be', 'released', 'only', 'month', 'prior', 'second', 'season', 'premier']",Kyle XY: Season 1

That is what drives the show and a decent plot idea.  However, pay attention to the writing.Poor writing and implausible stories:A non-communicative teen shows up in the middle of downtown, naked.  He ends up in juvenile detention center in a few hours.  I do not think so - he would be in a hospital.  48 hours in the psyche ward minimum.A woman whose job, other than `teen counselor', has no definition - gets custody of same unknown, uncommunicative teen diagnosed as having `traumatic amnesia'.  Again, I do not think so.  At least, not on the planet I live on.Same uncommunicative traumatic amnesiac teen is identified as a possible material witness in a murder - and still, no city social worker, no hospital, no psychiatric evaluation or treatment.That is just the first couple of episodes.Fast forward to `Kyle Got Game' [Season 1 Episode 7].  I have two words for a `COMMUNITY CENTER' basketball coach that orders a teen player to play injured (or else) - `fired' and `lawsuit'.  (We are not talking about a high school football team in Texas - we are talking about a `Community Center' coach in suburban Seattle.)In between are six episodes of the same shoddy, implausible writing.Now, give reviewer `Dawn M. Christensen' - ""5 stars for adults 1 star for children"" a standing ovation - for calling it as it is.  Then I will apologize to `M, Compulsive Reader' - ""Wonder-child in an (un)Brave New World""I am sorry, but I do not want this to ""be required viewing in every middle-school in the land with discussion following.""Yes, the show discusses ""teenage sexuality, loyalty, truth, standing up for what's right.""How about:- Underage drinking until you throw up and pass out is OK.- Teenagers having sex (with no mention of consequences - other than it was not that great)- It is okay for teens to sneak out for the night, and to sneak opposite sex teens into their bedrooms at night.- Masturbation is a topic of dinner conversation- Mom's not `upset' that her 16 year old daughter is not a virgin - it is okay, - and we `know' that our `precious' 14 year old boy is still a virgin because he still keeps his porno collection hidden under his bed.- It is no big deal that our 14 year old is `making book' (taking sports bets).- It is okay for our 16 year old daughter to take an overnight road trip with her boyfriend and another guy without a chaperone (even if that guy is our foster son - the angelic `Kyle').- It is okay for kids to lie to their parents.- It is okay for kids to cheat on tests.- It is okay for parents to lie FOR their children - to each other and in front of their children.- The list goes on...The only consequences for these actions by our misfit teens are the nebulous `grounding' that does not stop these kids from anything and the `no video games or internet' curse.I must be from another planet because this is not the definition of acceptable or normal behavior OR family values.  It is certainly not something I want shown in middle school as a discussion `starter'.Even though its rating is TV14 - it is a Family Channel staple.  Yes, there are shows that are `worse' - but most of them do not claim to be `family oriented' or `family friendly'.",1,[I] must be from another planet...,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,3340,"['Josh', 'Kyle', 'foster', 'brother', 'claims', 'Kyle', 'must', 'be', 'planet', 'so', 'am', 'I.Forget', 'premise', 'Kyle', 'Supra-genius', 'unknown', 'origin', 'show', 'decent', 'plot', 'idea', 'However', 'pay', 'attention', 'writing.Poor', 'writing', 'implausible', 'stories', 'non-communicative', 'teen', 'up', 'middle', 'downtown', 'naked', 'up', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'center', 'few', 'hours', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'hospital', '48', 'hours', 'psyche', 'ward', 'minimum.A', 'woman', 'job', 'other', 'teen', 'counselor', 'definition', 'custody', 'same', 'unknown', 'uncommunicative', 'teen', 'diagnosed', 'having', 'traumatic', 'amnesia', 'Again', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'least', 'not', 'planet', 'live', 'on.Same', 'uncommunicative', 'traumatic', 'amnesiac', 'teen', 'identified', 'possible', 'material', 'witness', 'murder', 'still', 'city', 'social', 'worker', 'hospital', 'psychiatric', 'evaluation', 'treatment.That', 'just', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes.Fast', 'forward', 'Kyle', 'Got', 'Game', '[', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '7', ']', 'have', 'two', 'words', 'COMMUNITY', 'CENTER', 'basketball', 'coach', 'orders', 'teen', 'player', 'play', 'injured', 'else', 'fired', 'lawsuit', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'Texas', 'are', 'talking', 'Community', 'Center', 'coach', 'suburban', 'Seattle', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'same', 'shoddy', 'implausible', 'writing.Now', 'give', 'reviewer', 'Dawn', 'M.', 'Christensen', '5', 'stars', 'adults', '1', 'star', 'children', 'standing', 'ovation', 'calling', 'Then', 'will', 'apologize', 'M', 'Compulsive', 'Reader', 'Wonder-child', 'un', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'am', 'sorry', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'middle-school', 'land', 'discussion', 'following', 'Yes', 'show', 'teenage', 'sexuality', 'loyalty', 'truth', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'How', 'about', 'Underage', 'drinking', 'throw', 'up', 'pass', 'out', 'OK.-', 'Teenagers', 'having', 'sex', 'mention', 'consequences', 'other', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'okay', 'teens', 'sneak', 'out', 'night', 'sneak', 'opposite', 'sex', 'teens', 'bedrooms', 'night.-', 'Masturbation', 'topic', 'dinner', 'conversation-', 'Mom', 'not', 'upset', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'not', 'virgin', 'okay', 'know', 'precious', '14', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'still', 'virgin', 'still', 'porno', 'collection', 'hidden', 'bed.-', 'big', 'deal', '14', 'year', 'old', 'making', 'book', 'taking', 'sports', 'bets', '.-', 'okay', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'take', 'overnight', 'road', 'trip', 'boyfriend', 'guy', 'chaperone', 'even', 'guy', 'foster', 'son', 'angelic', 'Kyle', '.-', 'okay', 'kids', 'lie', 'parents.-', 'okay', 'kids', 'cheat', 'tests.-', 'okay', 'parents', 'lie', 'FOR', 'children', 'other', 'front', 'children.-', 'list', 'only', 'consequences', 'actions', 'misfit', 'teens', 'are', 'nebulous', 'grounding', 'not', 'stop', 'kids', 'anything', 'video', 'games', 'internet', 'curse.I', 'must', 'be', 'planet', 'not', 'definition', 'acceptable', 'normal', 'behavior', 'OR', 'family', 'values', 'certainly', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'shown', 'middle', 'school', 'discussion', ""starter'.Even"", 'rating', 'TV14', 'Family', 'Channel', 'staple', 'Yes', 'are', 'shows', 'are', 'worse', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'claim', 'be', 'family', 'oriented', 'family', 'friendly']",Kyle XY: Season 1

That is the premise behind the ABC Family show ""Kyle XY"" in this first season.For a basic plot summary, the ten episodes comprising this season focus on the young boy, eventually given the name ""Kyle"", who doesn't seem to remember anything about his past.  After being taken in by his social worker, Kyle must acclimate to home living all over again, being helped by his increased brain activity that allows him to process information, both physically and mentally, much faster than an ordinary person.  Along the way, the mystery of his past is slowly revealed.The most endearing portion of this show is the ability of viewers, through the character of Kyle, to witness/experience the world from a fresh, innocent perspective.  For the first 5-6 episodes, every sensory and emotional experience is new to Kyle, and it is very entertaining watching him comprehend those simple moments we all take for granted.Then, in the final few episodes, the mysteries of Kyle's past really start to heat up.  The plot and writing angles are very well done considering the ABC Family network, and the character of Tom Foss (Nicholas Lea of X-Files fame) really adds to the gravity of the show.  It's not quite LOST or X-Files, but still good enough to keep even serious sci-fi viewers tuning in.The only drag on this show whatsoever is that, because of the ABC Family audience, the ""teenage romance"" angle is played up a bit too much.  Though done well in an innocent way with Kyle's character, the rest of his family's romantic foibles are little more than attempts to draw in hormone-driven teens.  Luckily, these angles don't bog down the show all that much, unlike the middle seasons of Smallville, for instance.Thus, I highly recommend this show (at least so far!) to any and all viewers.  Some of the subject matter will be quite inappropriate for the kiddies, but teenagers on up can enjoy the mysteries and touching character moments.",5,Seeing The World From A New Perspective,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2054,"['Imagine', 'waking', 'up', 'out', 'middle', 'woods', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'matter', 'premise', 'ABC', 'Family', 'show', 'Kyle', 'XY', 'first', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'ten', 'comprising', 'season', 'focus', 'young', 'boy', 'eventually', 'given', 'name', 'Kyle', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'anything', 'past', 'being', 'taken', 'social', 'worker', 'Kyle', 'must', 'acclimate', 'home', 'living', 'over', 'again', 'being', 'helped', 'increased', 'brain', 'activity', 'process', 'information', 'physically', 'mentally', 'much', 'faster', 'ordinary', 'person', 'way', 'mystery', 'past', 'slowly', 'revealed.The', 'most', 'endearing', 'portion', 'show', 'ability', 'viewers', 'character', 'Kyle', 'witness/experience', 'world', 'fresh', 'innocent', 'perspective', 'first', '5-6', 'episodes', 'sensory', 'emotional', 'experience', 'new', 'Kyle', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watching', 'comprehend', 'simple', 'moments', 'take', 'granted.Then', 'final', 'few', 'episodes', 'mysteries', 'Kyle', 'past', 'really', 'start', 'heat', 'up', 'plot', 'writing', 'angles', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'ABC', 'Family', 'network', 'character', 'Tom', 'Foss', 'Nicholas', 'Lea', 'X-Files', 'fame', 'really', 'gravity', 'show', 'not', 'quite', 'LOST', 'X-Files', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'even', 'serious', 'sci-fi', 'viewers', 'tuning', 'in.The', 'only', 'show', 'whatsoever', 'ABC', 'Family', 'audience', 'teenage', 'romance', 'angle', 'played', 'up', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'done', 'well', 'innocent', 'way', 'Kyle', 'character', 'rest', 'family', 'romantic', 'foibles', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'attempts', 'draw', 'hormone-driven', 'teens', 'Luckily', 'angles', 'do', ""n't"", 'bog', 'down', 'show', 'that', 'much', 'middle', 'seasons', 'Smallville', 'instance.Thus', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'viewers', 'subject', 'matter', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'inappropriate', 'kiddies', 'teenagers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'mysteries', 'touching', 'character', 'moments']",Kyle XY: Season 1
