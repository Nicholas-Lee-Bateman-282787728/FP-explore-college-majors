This film is presented in Japanese with English subtitles.Synopsis: Set in the early years of the 1900's a young maiden named Riyo leaves Yokohama, Japan shortly after her parent's death in hopes to find a loving husband and new life in Hawaii. She is a ""picture bride"" meaning all they know of each other is based on a letter and an enclosed photograph.Unfortunately things take a turn for the worse when she arrives at her destination and discovers a much older man waiting for her than she had expected. Matsuji, her intended, had sent a photograph of himself at a much younger age and now the young bride-to-be finds herself about to marry someone older than her deceased Father. Her initial enthusiasm is quickly replaced by disappointment and the prospects of a loveless marriage and hard work in the sugar cane field is all that remains.As the days go by Riyo struggles to come to grips with the hard work in the sugar cane fields, the laundry work she takes on during the night and the presence of a man she doesn't love. Will Riyo ever be able to forgive Matsuji for his deception and transform disappointment into a fulfilling life in Hawaii? Only Riyo has the power to decide.Filmed in Hawaii, the '95 release `Picture Bride' scores the highest of marks in every category. The cinematography is gorgeous, the music haunting, the storyline tender and the dialogue meaningful and believable. Youki Kudoh is absolutely beautiful in the lead role as the picture bride Riyo and Akira Takayama delivers a superior performance as her husband Matsuji.

""Picture Bride"" is a terrific film that poignantly and accurately hits at the heart of the Japanese immigration to Hawaii in the early 1900's.  A young girl, Riyo, apprehensively leaves Japan for Hawaii in order to marry a man she only knows through an aged photograph.  Once there, she has to come to grips with the harsh reality that the man she is to marry is much older and the life in front of her is that of manual labor in the sugar cane fields.  But through this a life is forged and a new generation is started in the beautiful Hawaiian isles.  Having been born and raised in Hawaii, I can't begin to express how on-the-mark this film is.  This, in part, is the story of my grandparents and my family.The Hawaiian backdrop is wonderfully photographed.  The performances are authentic and outstanding.  Particularly impressive was the performance of Tamlyn Tomita who I had mistaken for a local (Hawaiian born) girl.  Her demeanor, speech syntax and use of local dialect were dead-on.

Other groups are seen as well, and the ethnic and class tensions between Japanese and Chinese immigrants, Filipinos, ""haole"" whites and Portuguese pianolo cowboys are explored with a light, honest touch.  This artful film unfolds at a relaxed, almost dreamlike pace, mirroring the whispering calm of the moonlit cane fields where almost all the action takes place.

383261,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,6303637582,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[4, 4]","This first-time effort by Hawaiian-born Kayo Hatta worked for me cuz it didn't have the depth that I'm sure she intended. It only skimmed the surface of the potential melodrama of the story and, so, avoided becoming soggy with emotion. What remained were glimpses of a lifestyle shockingly different than the paradise promised by planatation owners and bachelor laborers to ""picture brides"" across the sea.Fortune smiled on Hatta when she was talked into casting Japanese actress Youki Kudoh. Youki's in almost every scene and she easily carried the film with her nuanced, adorable performance. Her offbeat cuteness and delicacy enhanced the fish-out-of-water quality of the movie.Her famous countryman, Toshiro Mifune, only appeared briefly but vividly in his second-to-last film. Speaking of brief, you might recognize Jason Scott Lee in an uncredited appearance.This is a nice film to look at. Very colorful -- which is odd for an American film. While it took advantage of the magnificent Hawaiian scenery, it was mostly shot in the deep-green, almost claustrophobic cane fields. A clever atmospheric choice.I particularly liked the effort to present the language situation authentically rather than turn everything into American English. Probably more than half of the dialog is in Japanese (with subtitles). Most of the English is heavily accented pidgin (remember Hawaii Five-0?) with a wee bit of Scots English and American English. If you're alert, you'll notice a Filipino dialect.Sadly, Kayo Hatto -- who conceived, produced, co-wrote (with her sister), and directed -- did only a few film shorts since. Then, in 2005, she drowned accidently at age 47. So this is her feature film legacy. It's not deep dramatically, but it's wide in texture. Aloha, Kayo.

There were Chinese, Portugese, Japanese and Filipinos.  This movie is about the (then) fairly common practice of Japanese men working in Hawaii arranging to marry women still living in Japan, who would then move to Hawaii to marry.  The story is about an older Japanese man sending to Japan a photograph of himself that was taken when he was much younger.  A bride is arranged and travels to Hawaii to meet her fiancee.  When she arrives, she is horrified to find a man much older than she expected.  She determines that she will return to Japan.  But, work is hard and money difficult to come by.  Her husband cares for her and tries to dissuade her from her plans to leave.

383263,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6303637582,Lawyeraau,"[40, 40]","I had never heard of this film, but when I stumbled upon it in the video store, I found its premise fascinating. As the film explains, with the advent of photography, the Asian tradition of arranged marriages became modernized in the early twentieth century, allowing families and matchmakers to meet, using  photographs of the prospective brides and bridegrooms in lieu of face-to-face meetings. This was especially convenient, when the parties sought to be matched lived in far-flung parts of the country or even different parts of the world. This film explores this phenomena within the context of the so-called ""picture brides"" of Hawai'i. It is estimated that between 1907 and 1924,  approximately twenty thousand young Asian woman from Japan, Okinawa, and Korea,  became ""picture brides"", leaving their native country and journeying to Hawai'i to become the wives of men that they had never met. This film is a composite of their stories and experiences.The story begins in 1918 in Yokahama, where a beautiful, young, Japanese woman named Riyo Nakamura (Youki Kudoh) is left an orphan, having  just buried her father. It seems that both her parents have died of a disease that stigmatizes Riyo in terms of her marriage prospects. Shortly after, Riyo's Aunt Sode (Yoko Sugi) visits a matchmaker.  She then presents her niece with a photograph of a young, handsome man. She tells her niece that his name is Matsuji Kimura and that he is a sugar cane farmer in Hawai'i. Her aunt hopes that Hawai'i is far enough away so that Riyo's prospective husband  will not know how her parents died. With Riyo's assent, the marriage is arranged.When Riyo arrives in  Hawai'i, dressed in western style clothing, she gets the shock of her life. It seems that she is not the only one with secrets. It turns out that the photograph that Matsuji Kimura (Akira Takayama) had sent was one that had evidently been taken many years earlier, as the man who meets her at the dock turns out to be even older than Riyo's deceased father. A group marriage then takes place, as she is but one of many ""picture brides"" arriving. Shocked by the deception, which apparently was quite common at the time, with men routinely sending old photographs or substituting photographs of their better looking friend,  the reluctant Riyo accompanies her new husband to her new home. She is clearly not a happy camper.  Riyo, a city girl, is in for a further shock, discovering that her home is deep in the country and is nothing more than a tiny wooden shack in the middle of nowhere.The next day, she discovers the fate that awaits her. She is taken to a sugar cane plantation, where she is expected to work in the fields from morning til dusk for sixty-five cents a day. It is there that her husband also works. Riyo decides then and there that she will work as hard as she can to save money to return to Japan. She makes a friend, a beautiful, young, earthy woman named Kana (Tamlyn Tomita) with whom she bonds. Kana is married to a handsome, young man named  Kanzaki with whom she has a child. The hard working Kana is also a laundress, in addition to being a field worker, and Riyo joins Kana as a partner in her laundry business in order to be able to save more money and expedite her return to Japan.As her friendship develops with Kana, Riyo discovers that Kana and her husband have a tempestuous marriage. While passionate, it is also filled with violence, as Kanzaki is unmanned by his inability to provide for his wife and child in the way that he would wish. Meanwhile, Matsuji is a patient man, who has not forced himself on his wife, knowing her aversion to him. He is kind to her, despite knowing that she is working very hard to save money in order to return to Japan and be rid of him. Little by little, however, he grows on her, as a mutual affection begins to develop, and Riyo learns to appreciate his good qualities.The film tells the story of Riyo and the reality of her life in Hawai'i. It shows what life was like for her, as well as the development of her relationship with Matsuji. Hers is the story of many women who were ""picture brides"" at the time. It is a beautifully told tale on many levels. It captures much of the story of those who were actual ""picture brides"", from the singing in the fields, to the hardships sustained, and the despair sometimes felt at their lot in life, often juxtaposed with contentment.There is even a special treat in the film where the legendary and much revered Japanese actor, Toshiro Mifune, plays the role of a Benshi, which  was a silent picture narrator. In Japan, Benshis would often have their own following, depending upon their narrative skills,  with people flocking to hear a particular Benshi narrate a film.  This would be Toshiro Mifune's final film role, before succumbing to the ravages of Parkinson's disease in 1997.This is the first feature length film for filmmaker Kayo Hatta, and the first feature length film by an Asian-American woman. It won the coveted 1995 Sundance Film Festival Audience Choice Award. Having seen the film it is not surprising, as the film tells such a compelling story. Moreover, the cinematography is exquisite in this film, and the acting is first rate. It is hard to believe that the film was made on a shoe string budget by a first time feature film director. One would never know it from seeing the film, as it is a quality film directed with a seeming sure hand. I am only glad that Miramax Studio  had the good sense to pick up this film.

383264,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6303637582,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 2]","""Picture Bride"" is the first film by director Kayo Hatta.  It won the Audience Award @ the Sundance Film Festival in 1994.  Hatta has apparently remained inactive as a director until this year with a short film ""Fishbowl"" in 2005.  This film is gorgeously photographed with the landscape in Hawaii breathtakingly photographed by Claudio Rocha who also served as cinematographer on a film I enjoyed with Peter Fonda called ""The Maldonado Miracle.""  Yuki Kudoh who was so memorable in ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" and has ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" out this year plays Riyo, a young Japanese woman who becomes engaged to a man in Hawaii only by looking at his picture.  She does an excellent job of showing the character's inner strength as she works in the fields, brings in extra work doing laundry and eventually finds her place in her new home.  In his first & only film credit of which I'm aware, Akira Takayama plays Matsuji her husband who is 25 years older than his photograph.  Riyo's main friend becomes the worldly-wise Kana played by Tamlyn Tomita who has been in ""Karate Kid, Part 2,"" ""The Joy Luck Club"" & ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  Tomita brings out the strength and caring of the character and shows the tragedy of people who are not considered important as she perishes searching for her baby who has wandered when the sugar cane is set on fire.  Her husband is played by the dashing Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa whose long list of film credits include ""The Last Emperor,"" ""Mortal Combat,"" ""The Phantom,"" ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" & ""Elektra.""  As Kanzaki, he is not the most caring of husbands, inflicting bruises and abuse.  But his drunken misbehavior is also balanced by being a buddy to Matsuji and with a great grief scene as he realizes his wife & child have perished.  Legendary Toshiro Mifune from ""Rashomon"" (1950) & ""The Seven Samurai"" (1954) does a cameo as the Benshi, who narrates silent films.  Yoko Sugi who did 8 Japanese films in the 1950's gives a cameo performance as Aunt Sode who sets up the marriage.  While the episodic film doesn't climax with a great crescendo, it does paint the picture of those in the early 1900's who married strangers to find a life.

My Mother was one of these women, who travelled across the Pacific, to Hawaii, to marry men they had never seen, except in photographs. The depiction of turn of the century Hawaii is accurate. Life was hard for plantation workers (this being one of the very few jobs the unskilled could hope to have), and wages low, but many couples managed families, nonetheless.The story concerns a picture bride who, after meeting the man she has promised herself to, realizes that he is much older than the picture he sent. What follows is the journey she takes, in understanding that things could have been much worse, and that she is lucky to have found such a good man.The views of the island are absolutely beautiful!

This is the work of first time Director, Kayo Hatta, who, when she developed the idea and applied for funding, was still a student!  You would never have a clue about the difficulties she faced in making this film, or that it was crafted by anyone but a seasoned professional, if you did not listen to her interview on the DVD disk.  Produced on a shoestring budget, ""Picture Bride"" is only the second independent film to be made in Hawaii.The film focuses on two couples. Both  wives were ""Picture Brides"", meaning their husbands selected them based on photographs.  Photography was a new technology.  In fact, it is not unlike Internet dating services today, where images are conveyed on computer screens, but at the time this was totally new.  And like the Internet, no one was above deception.  Ultimately this meant that prospective brides/grooms were not always what were expected.Husbands and wives did grueling, dangerous work in the cane fields, marriages between total strangers so far from home were often harsh, and dreams and expectations often died along the way.  Twenty thousand such marriages took place in Hawaii between 1908 and 1924.  The stories were based on interviews conducted by the director with still-living ""Picture Brides"". The characters of the two women were based on the personalities of the director's grandmothers.This novice director is absolutely outstanding, the film is magnificent to watch in the incomparable setting of Hawaii, the actors are superb, and it has captured the authentic feel of what it must have been like to be a ""Picture Bride"" arriving in Hawaii from Japan in the early 20th century.

It particularly caught my eye, because Mifune was about 74 or 75 years old when he appeared in this movie, and I had only seen him as a robust, energetic and physical actor who could always command whatever scene he was in with just a look from his flashing dark eyes or booming deep voice.I was not aware of the ""picture brides"" who had basically been mail-order brides from Japan to Hawaii in the very early 1900's -- evidently around 20,000 of them.  The movie's premise is simple.  An older man sends a picture of himself as a young man to the matchmaker and receives a very young bride, who appears to be in her late teens.  The young girl is horrified when she sees her husband-to-be and refuses to have anything to do with him.  As the story unfolds, and the man wins her over, there are beautiful sweet scenes between the man and his new wife.  The new bride is taken under the wings of the other women she works side by side with in the cane fields.  In particuclar, she strikes up a friendship with a slightly older woman who helps to guide her along her way to happiness.  Unfortunately, tragedy strikes but serves as the final impetus for the young bride to accept and love her new husband.Toshiro Mifune makes a much too brief appearance as a benshi, a person whose job it is to narrate a silent film and explain exactly what is taking place.  One of these films is sometimes shown to the farm workers on Saturday nights as a reward or benefit for working hard in the fields all week.  Mr. Mifune was just as impressive playing this small role as he was in his earlier more athletic/dramatic roles.  His voice was still strong and booming.  His posture was still straight, erect and strong, and he still had those flashing dark eyes.  When he is first seen in this film, he is in a wagon with the other people who will be showing the movie that night to the farm workers.  There are two children playing at swordfighting.  Mr. Mifune shouts out to them and demonstrates to them the correct way to hold their swords.  The children's names were Toshiro and Akira.  It was an extremely poignant moment in the film as though Mr. Mifune were telling Mr. Kurosawa that he had not forgotten him and still remembered all the swordplay movies they had made together. I found the scene extremely emotional.The movie is cinematically beautiful as is the music.  The characters are well played and very believable.

This is a beautifully produced, beautifully photographed and beautifully acted independent film, featuring one of the final film appearances of the great actor Mifune Toshiro (Yojimbo).I first heard of the term ""picture bride"" in a much more lighthearted movie,Flower Drum Song.  I was only vaguely aware of the history, and while I new that Hawaii has a large second, third and fourth generation Japanese population, I never really knew why.  The men originally went over for work, slaving away in the sugar cane fields, and when they saved up they sent money back home for a wife to be arranged for them.""Picture Bride"" is essentially the story of two women, Riyo (Youki Kudoh fromMystery Train) and Kana (Tamlyn Tomita fromThe Karate Kid II).  16-year old Riyo is fresh off the boat, being brought over to Hawaii under false pretenses. Her new husband used a friend's photo, and is actually older than Riyo's father.  Kana, on the other hand, was pleased with her husband, but many years working the sugar plantation has made them hard, driving a wedge between them.  The two bond and become friends, while Riyo learns to live with the old man she is now married to, hoping to save enough money to return to Japan.I was deeply impressed with how director Kayo Hatta handled the characters.  It would have been so simple to take the easy road, to set whites against Asians, and plantation owners against the abused workers.  Or to make Riyo's husband a monster who lied to bring her far across the ocean.  But none of these things happen.  There is good and bad on all sides of the line, and most people are just trying to make the best out of their various situations.The cultural aspects are handled beautifully as well, and I really enjoyed the attention to detail such as in the appearance of a yurei, a Japanese ghost.  Some of the history may be a little difficult, such as why having a parent die of tuberculosis was such a great shame.""Picture Bride"" is mostly in Japanese with English subtitles, but some English is spoken as well. It is evident that Tamlyn Tomita does not speak Japanese very well, so her lines in that language are limited.  Mifune Toshiro's appearance is small, but wonderful.
