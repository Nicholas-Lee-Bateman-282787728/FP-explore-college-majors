Anttila ""SovereignII""","[0, 0]",I think this series was canceled because towards the end it felt rushed because it was so short and action packed.This is still a great series with one of my favorite openings too just feels like it needs a few more episodes to more cleanly rap things up. So Lost Universe needs to be revised and some of the voices could do with recasting.Still buy it because it is a good series even with it's imperfections.,4,Over all good series with a few problems.,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,410,"['think', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'because', 'end', 'felt', 'rushed', 'was', 'so', 'short', 'action', 'packed.This', 'still', 'great', 'series', 'one', 'favorite', 'openings', 'too', 'just', 'feels', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'more', 'cleanly', 'rap', 'things', 'up', 'So', 'Lost', 'Universe', 'be', 'revised', 'voices', 'could', 'do', 'recasting.Still', 'buy', 'good', 'series', 'even', 'imperfections']",N/A

The artwork can be a bit spotty, as it chages from drawn to computerised. It is the sort of mystery that you don't find out what it is about, or even that there is a unifying plot, until near the end.  Yet it does manage to be well enough written, have a happy ending, and have many funny spots.",3,more good than bad,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,426,"['One', 'two', 'female', 'voices', 'are', 'somewhat', 'irritating', 'times', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'obviously', 'copy', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'artwork', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'spotty', 'drawn', 'computerised', 'sort', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'about', 'even', 'unifying', 'plot', 'end', 'manage', 'be', 'well', 'enough', 'written', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'many', 'funny', 'spots']",N/A

I found this series to be on the same level as its parent show but I still enjoy slayers more.,5,It's Slayers in Space!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,228,"['fan', 'Slayers', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'Lost', 'universe', 'same', 'unique', 'storytelling', 'adventure', 'comedy', 'Slayers', 'found', 'series', 'be', 'same', 'level', 'parent', 'show', 'still', 'enjoy', 'slayers', 'more']",N/A
1102246,AFV2584U13XP3,B000VKL6RU,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[3, 3]","I have to say this is probably another gem I unknowingly found while looking for another series for myself and have not been disappointed with my choice.  The series is similar to the humor of the anime series Slayers and Ranma 1/2.  The series itself focuses mostly on the three main characters Millie Nocturne(An Under/Over achiever trying her best to be the best at what she wants to do with dubious results), Kane Blueriver(A captain of the starship SwordBreaker and while somewhat of a bumbler is actually a skilled fighter), and finally Canal(The SwordBreaker's holographic A.I. image with a smarmy attitude).  The series has you see the trio go on their zanny and humorous quests together and while there is fighting and action it's not done to be to dramatic or serious like Gundam Seed or Inuyasha. The last final episodes do seem a bit more dramatic than the rest of the series but I think it fits in nicely though for the storyline. The voice actors for the dubbed audio were pretty good and while there were some that could have done better all in all they weren't bad.  The Japanese voice actors did a terrific job as well no complaints there and the video for the series is clear with no blurriness or distortions to worry about.  So if you like the light-hearted sci-fi anime with a big touch of comedy this hidden gem might be for you and for those still unsure try watching a few episodes you might just be surprised at how much you enjoy it....",5,An Entertaining And Amusing Sci-Fi Collection Worth The Price,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1462,"['have', 'say', 'probably', 'gem', 'unknowingly', 'found', 'looking', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'disappointed', 'choice', 'series', 'similar', 'humor', 'anime', 'series', 'Slayers', 'Ranma', '1/2', 'series', 'mostly', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Millie', 'Nocturne', 'Under/Over', 'achiever', 'trying', 'best', 'be', 'best', 'what', 'do', 'dubious', 'results', 'Kane', 'Blueriver', 'A', 'captain', 'starship', 'SwordBreaker', 'somewhat', 'bumbler', 'actually', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'finally', 'Canal', 'SwordBreaker', 'holographic', 'A.I', 'image', 'smarmy', 'attitude', 'series', 'see', 'trio', 'go', 'zanny', 'humorous', 'quests', 'together', 'fighting', 'action', 'not', 'done', 'be', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'Gundam', 'Seed', 'Inuyasha', 'last', 'final', 'episodes', 'do', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'dramatic', 'rest', 'series', 'think', 'nicely', 'storyline', 'voice', 'actors', 'dubbed', 'audio', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'were', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'well', 'complaints', 'there', 'video', 'series', 'clear', 'blurriness', 'distortions', 'worry', 'about', 'So', 'like', 'light-hearted', 'sci-fi', 'anime', 'big', 'touch', 'comedy', 'hidden', 'gem', 'might', 'be', 'still', 'unsure', 'try', 'watching', 'few', 'episodes', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy']",N/A

The Japanese subtitling made Far more sense than the English voices. I never heard the voice actor of the female ship again and I'm grateful for it. Running nails across a blackboard is the only fair description. The story was fairly silly in the original Japanese and I'll be stopping near the beginning and restart with it in Japanese to judge the quality of the show at a later date.

It ran the spectrum from being rated G in places to PG-13 in others. Because of some alcohol use in a couple of the early scenes, it would be tough for a G-rated crowd and the story line is certainly more PG-13. However, for outer space combat and adventure, I recommend it.",3,More cartoony than I would have like,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,362,"['Overall', 'thought', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'More', 'cartoony', 'would', 'have', 'ran', 'spectrum', 'being', 'rated', 'G', 'places', 'PG-13', 'others', 'alcohol', 'use', 'couple', 'early', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'G-rated', 'crowd', 'story', 'line', 'certainly', 'more', 'PG-13', 'However', 'outer', 'space', 'combat', 'adventure', 'recommend']",N/A
