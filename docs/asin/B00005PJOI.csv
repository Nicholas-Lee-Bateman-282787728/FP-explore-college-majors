Each time you hear him, you hear something different.The crowning moments are the duets with singer Iris Dement, who with great pride joins him in some ""questionable lyrics"" as he puts it.  He didn't write all of the songs, but he chose some great ones.There was a time when we saw on television, the Sessions at West 54th, where we saw some great performances with singers who aren't always in the mainstream.  Sessions was great entertainment and you can search for more shows like this one.Included in this is an interview hosted by singer John Hiatt, who seemed in awe of John Prine.  Hiatt talks with Prine about his musicians, the record company, the movies Prine was in and of course his bout with neck cancer.This DVD is a keeper!  ....Rizzo",5,A real treat from one great storyteller!,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,868,"['John', 'Prine', 'type', 'singer', 'listen', 'lyrics', 'so', 'about', 'humorous', 'sad', 'entertaining', 'lyrics', 'time', 'hear', 'hear', 'something', 'different.The', 'crowning', 'moments', 'are', 'duets', 'singer', 'Iris', 'Dement', 'who', 'great', 'pride', 'questionable', 'lyrics', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'songs', 'chose', 'great', 'ones.There', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'saw', 'television', 'Sessions', 'West', '54th', 'where', 'saw', 'great', 'performances', 'singers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'mainstream', 'Sessions', 'was', 'great', 'entertainment', 'can', 'search', 'more', 'shows', 'one.Included', 'interview', 'hosted', 'singer', 'John', 'Hiatt', 'who', 'seemed', 'awe', 'John', 'Prine', 'Hiatt', 'talks', 'Prine', 'musicians', 'record', 'company', 'movies', 'Prine', 'was', 'course', 'bout', 'neck', 'cancer.This', 'DVD', 'keeper', '.Rizzo']",N/A

673469,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005PJOI,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Over the last several months I have done more musically-oriented reviews that I had expected. One of the themes that keep cropping up is that for some folk/blues-oriented musical artists like Bob Dylan my attachment was immediate, long time and on-going. For other artists like John Prine it has been more of a recently acquired taste. I had, obviously, heard Bonnie Raitt do his Angel From Montgomery but I never associated his name with that song. Then a couple of years ago I happened to listen to his Hello In There and Sam Stone. Yes, this guy has something to say that I wanted to (on some songs, needed to) hear.This concert represents a small selection of some of his work, although with the exception of Sam Stone, Lake Marie and Hello in There not much in the way of classics, at least that I am familiar with. This concert would thus only rate as a pretty fair performance except that on a few songs like When Two World Collide he is accompanied by Iris Dement (wife of the folksinger/songwriter Greg Brown). Iris is also a recent acquisition. I would travel very far to hear that voice of hers (and have done so). Incidentally, I have seen both these performers in person over the past couple of years- they still have it. Still this is not the DVD that YOU need to understand either talent, but you may want it.",4,John Prine Almost Primed,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,1324,"['last', 'several', 'months', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'musically-oriented', 'reviews', 'had', 'expected', 'One', 'themes', 'keep', 'cropping', 'up', 'folk/blues-oriented', 'musical', 'artists', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'attachment', 'was', 'immediate', 'long', 'time', 'on-going', 'other', 'artists', 'John', 'Prine', 'been', 'more', 'recently', 'acquired', 'taste', 'had', 'obviously', 'heard', 'Bonnie', 'Raitt', 'do', 'Angel', 'From', 'Montgomery', 'never', 'associated', 'name', 'song', 'Then', 'couple', 'years', 'happened', 'listen', 'Hello', 'Sam', 'Stone', 'Yes', 'guy', 'something', 'say', 'wanted', 'songs', 'needed', 'hear.This', 'concert', 'small', 'selection', 'work', 'exception', 'Sam', 'Stone', 'Lake', 'Marie', 'Hello', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'classics', 'least', 'am', 'familiar', 'concert', 'would', 'thus', 'only', 'rate', 'pretty', 'fair', 'performance', 'few', 'songs', 'When', 'Two', 'World', 'Collide', 'accompanied', 'Iris', 'Dement', 'wife', 'folksinger/songwriter', 'Greg', 'Brown', 'Iris', 'also', 'recent', 'acquisition', 'would', 'travel', 'very', 'far', 'hear', 'voice', 'hers', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'Incidentally', 'have', 'seen', 'performers', 'person', 'past', 'couple', 'years-', 'still', 'have', 'Still', 'not', 'DVD', 'YOU', 'need', 'understand', 'talent', 'may', 'want']",N/A

A fantastic young gitarist and a very good bass player complement John. There's not one boring moment. And then there's the duets with Iris DeMent (it's a shame she has only made three cd's till now). Iris is a very special, oldfashioned-sounding singer. I love her.What's more: there's no talking through songs or anything else that diverts from the music. There's just great music, beautifully filmed. A pure joy.

673472,A15Y2FQ5WNR63Y,B00005PJOI,"James D. DeWitt ""Alaska Fan""","[60, 60]","John Prine is one of those rare artists who both define and occupy a niche in pop music. I've been a fan of John since the mid-1970's in Chicago, where you could catch Prine and Steve Goodman on a double bill - or just sitting in on each other's acts - at The Quiet Knight for a two drink minimum. His catchy, eclectic and highly personal songs are always interesting and sometimes extraordinary.But not until this DVD have you been able to catch the spirit of a John Prine concert. I don't know why it has taken so long, but I'm grateful that it is here at last. It's not quite the same as being there, but it's a treat even so.I bought the DVD after a concert here in Fairbanks, just last week. Except for not having Iris Dement for the cuts from &quot;In Spite of Ourselves&quot; (John sang both parts himself), this DVD captures the spirit, the goofy sincerity and charm, of John Prine very well. The camera work is quite good, the editing is crisp and smooth, and his band, Jason Wilber and David Jacques, are nearly perfect.Life hasn't treated John all that well. He's had his woman problems (&quot;All the Best&quot; was written for his ex-wife's wedding), his best friend died, he's had a hip transplant and scary brush with cancer. But it hasn't affected his music or his evident joy in life. He seems to live his life and write his music with the message of &quot;Bruised Orange&quot; in mind: &quot;It don't do no good to get angry, believe me, I know.&quot;John Prine fans: this DVD belongs in your collection. You will savor it for years to come. For those who don't know John, get &quot;Souvenirs,&quot; his latest CD release, and this DVD, and see what the fuss is all about.And thanks, John. It was a great concert. It's a great DVD.
