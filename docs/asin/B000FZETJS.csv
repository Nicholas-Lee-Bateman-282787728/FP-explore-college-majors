These guys have mastered the art of genius-disguised-as-idiocy, and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end.  I guess I'm not surprised it didn't last; this kind of humor isn't for everyone.  But come on...we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include Mind of Mencia and Blue Collar Comedy, both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer.  These guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years, and I hope to see them in another show or movie soon.

Ho ho ho!The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  ""How long can this go on without being funny,"" one asks oneself.  ""Surely it will be funny next episode!""Nothin' doin'.If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a ""funny skit"" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.

I would like to thank Comedy Central personally for cancelling the show, even though I believe they owe us an apology for even putting it on the air. Just because a network cancels something it isn't automatically an ""artist vs. the big, bad corporation"" battle. A show can be really awful, like this one. I remember the episode Novel, where the boys write a novel and a famous writer (played by Janeane Garofalo, who looks bored and irritated through the whole thing) steals it, and laughed maybe twice, and they were light chuckles at best. Then I tried to watch office party, laughed maybe once, and I just gave up.  Sometimes when you think the sketch is going to work, Wain, Black, and Showalter just end up doing something really dumb and stupid, and it ends up ruining the whole thing.  Maybe that's the point.  That seems to be the running joke of the series.  The ""brains"" behind Wet Hot American Summer created this mess.  It grows very tiresome very quickly.

997297,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000FZETJS,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 0]","This show earns the highest possible praise for a comedy series: it compares favorably with ""Red Dwarf.""  Of course it's conceivable (though just barely) that not everyone considers ""Red Dwarf"" the standard against which all other comedys are to be judged.  So if you don't count ""Red Dwarf,"" then ""Stella"" becomes the gold standard of comedy.  The fact that it only lasted one season of ten episodes pretty much proves that Comedy Central is to comedy as SyFy is to science fiction - and believe me, that's no compliment. The show isn't just funny (almost any show can be funny); it's surreal, whimsical and absolutely absurd all at the same time.  ""Stella"" is definitely not for those who want their comedy doggedly ""true to life"" so they can glean little snippets of everyday wisdom from the situations presented while they laugh at the all-too-obvious story line; in a word, it's not a show to guide you through life's perils.  Just the opposite: it creates an endless array of perils for the characters where there needed to be none at all. And, best of all, there's no way on earth you can guess how everything resolves.  By far your biggest challenge watching the series is deciding which episode is your favorite; it seems almost obscene to call any one episode better than the rest.  Even so, I'm going to stick my neck out and call ""Vegetables"" my favorite. It took all the magic of the show to an even higher plateau - which I wouldn't have thought possible.

So many skits these days fall so flat, I just figured this would be full of 'groaners.'Happy to report this is much more like 'Strangers with Candy.'  It's total nonsense, but very clever and each episode follows a storyline, rather than just being isolated skits.Now for a very odd coincidence:  I'm actually only to the last episode of Disc One (but the fact I watched them all in a row in sheer delight tells me I will keep watching all through the night).  The show I really was going to compare this to is Chris Elliott's 'Get a Life.'  Then, as I'm starting to write my review, what do they do?  Become Paperboys!Gotta be a nod to Chris--Stella certainly takes his skewed view of reality, but nothing is stolen from that show.  Simply 'carrying the torch.'I freakin' love 'Get a Life,' and now I freakin' love 'Stella'.But no wonder it got cancelled.  Still too 'far out' for the masses.UPDATE:  Another 'Get a Life' nod:  Like I said, I was only through the first disc.  But another concept they borrow from Chris is when two of them get girlfriends--their relationships develop like 10 years (i.e. completely settling down in family life ruts, etc.) within ONE DAY.
