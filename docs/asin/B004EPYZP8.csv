1398816,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B004EPYZP8,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011 filmA man gets out of a car and enters a secured place. Another man talks to him about a criminal case. He talks to a bailiff about a defendant; the trial is held over. Lawyer Michael Haller stops his car to talk about that case. Haller visits his next client; ""it was a set-up"". The man is accused of beating a woman, but gets out on bail. Haller knows how to handle the press! He names his price to the family lawyer. A young woman is fingerprinted and processed. Haller arrives to advise her and learns what happened. Her customer paid in drugs not money, then she was caught. Haller talks to the prosecutor and makes a deal: his client will walk if she gives up this wanted man. Louis Roul&eacute; is out, Haller meets his mother. Roul&eacute; insists he is innocent, and tells his story. Note the differences in the point of view! Investigator Frank will check out the client's story. \Haller gets a ride home. Next morning Frank brings in a DVD about the event. Haller shows the DVD to the prosecutor. There is a discrepancy in the discovery file. [Prosecutors have to turn over their known facts to the defense counsel.] Haller tells his client to follow orders. A detective talks to Haller about the justice system. Later Haller meets a woman and they become very friendly. Haller studies the pictures of that woman. [Note the lack of bruises on her left side.] A prisoner insists he is innocent and won't take a deal. Haller visits a prisoner and hears his story. He reconsiders this case. Was a client really innocent? Haller has a dilemma. Can Frank find other cases like this one? Roul&eacute; makes a surprise visit to tell Mich something. The next day Haller learns his investigator was shot and killed at home! [Note the black blood from a body over an hour old.] Mick is upset and sees a man who could be involved.Later Mick talks to Maggie about ""pure evil"". Mick listens to his answering machine. Frank was killed by a Colt Woodsman (a .22 automatic). Did Mick have an unsecured pistol at home? The trial of Louis Roul&eacute; goes on. The police search Mick's home. They have old evidence on that Woodsman, it was a gift from Mickey Cohen. Regina Campo testifies and is cross-examined. The next day Louis Roul&eacute; testifies. ""I am innocent!"" There is a rebuttal witness, a man held in jail (a ""snitch""). Why do people talk to him in jail? Can an old newspaper report affect the trial? There is a surprise ending! ""Whose side are you on?"" But there's more to come. Where is he going? There is a final confrontation. Mick knows people who can help him. There is another surprise at the end! Call 911. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.] ""Martinez is free."" There is a repeat customer.This story starts out as an example of the practice of criminal law, then develops into a very interesting story about a murder.

There were many other great actors in this movie as well.  The lawyer role seems to fit Matthew perfectly.  It's like he doesn't even have to try.  Thank goodness for us ladies that he decided to be an actor instead of a lawyer.  This has a great plot, and story line.  I bought this movie after watching it a few times on Netflix because I wanted to own it.  I love having it on my computer so I can pull it up whenever I want and wherever I go without having to tote around DVDs.  This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, wondering who did what, who is lying, who is telling the truth, and what is going to happen next.  The music in the movie is pretty nice too.  It is different than what you would think but it is very fitting.  So sit back, relax and enjoy.  You are going to be very happy with this movie.

1398823,AGEIT17HENDIS,B004EPYZP8,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Yes, I know, everybody, everybody including Richard III, I think, who uttered some variation of that idea in William Shakespeare's play of the same name, hates lawyers. Hates them until old justice time comes along and everyone, including this writer, hopes to high heaven that their lawyer is up to the task of representing them zealously, and in some desperate cases more than zealously. And that combination of sentiments, that hate/love thing, is what drives this film which according to my usually reliable sources follows the Michael Connelly novel pretty closely.Needless to say, except for the thugs, pimps, dope dealers, hellish motorcycle angels, bail bondmen, public servant grifters and grafters and a bewitching lawyer ex-wife (played by Marissa Tormei) nobody, no viewer anyway, is suppose to like the Lincoln lawyer at the outset. (Named the Lincoln lawyer, by the way, not for his ethical resemblance to Father Abraham but because he rides around in a chauffeur-driven Lincoln.) His wheeling and dealing just this side of the law is what makes him the darling of that rogue's gallery of characters listed above (except, of course, the fetching ex-wife, and maybe her a little too) and the bane of the District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles Police Department establishment.That deft and ruthless maneuvering is what also draws him to the attention of a vicious killer of women, women of the night to use a quaint phrase, and a surefire way to commit the ""perfect murder"" and like so many before him said murderer thought he was scot-free as is the usual case once the Lincoln lawyer was on the case. But see, said Lincoln lawyer ""got religion"" along the way after he and those around him were slated to take the fall if that vicious killer (a mommy's boy to boot) got tripped up.So you know damn well pretty early on that our trusty Lincoln lawyer is not taking the fall and, moreover, is going to see that an actual piece of real justice occurs in the process by the freeing a framed man who was sitting in stir through his negligence (and disbelief in innocence) by seeing that that vicious killer gets his jolt up at Q. Therefore you see we had it all wrong. There is some rough justice in the world. And one had better not kill off all those lawyers if there is going to be even that amount. The twists and turns getting there, although fairly well-worn by now in movie-dom, are what make this film one to see.",4,"""First Let's Kill All The Lawyers""-Not",1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,2437,"['Yes', 'know', 'everybody', 'everybody', 'including', 'Richard', 'III', 'think', 'who', 'uttered', 'variation', 'idea', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'lawyers', 'old', 'justice', 'time', 'along', 'everyone', 'including', 'writer', 'high', 'heaven', 'lawyer', 'task', 'representing', 'zealously', 'desperate', 'cases', 'more', 'zealously', 'combination', 'sentiments', 'hate/love', 'thing', 'what', 'film', 'according', 'usually', 'reliable', 'sources', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'novel', 'pretty', 'closely.Needless', 'say', 'thugs', 'pimps', 'dope', 'dealers', 'hellish', 'motorcycle', 'angels', 'bail', 'bondmen', 'public', 'servant', 'grifters', 'grafters', 'bewitching', 'lawyer', 'ex-wife', 'played', 'Marissa', 'Tormei', 'nobody', 'viewer', 'anyway', 'suppose', 'like', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'outset', 'Named', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'way', 'not', 'ethical', 'resemblance', 'Father', 'Abraham', 'around', 'chauffeur-driven', 'Lincoln', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'just', 'side', 'law', 'what', 'darling', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'characters', 'listed', 'course', 'fetching', 'ex-wife', 'maybe', 'little', 'too', 'bane', 'District', 'Attorney', 'Office', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Police', 'Department', 'deft', 'ruthless', 'maneuvering', 'what', 'also', 'attention', 'vicious', 'killer', 'women', 'women', 'night', 'use', 'quaint', 'phrase', 'surefire', 'way', 'commit', 'perfect', 'murder', 'so', 'many', 'said', 'murderer', 'thought', 'was', 'scot-free', 'usual', 'case', 'once', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'was', 'case', 'see', 'said', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'got', 'religion', 'way', 'were', 'slated', 'take', 'fall', 'vicious', 'killer', 'mommy', 'boy', 'boot', 'got', 'tripped', 'know', 'damn', 'well', 'pretty', 'early', 'trusty', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'not', 'taking', 'fall', 'moreover', 'going', 'see', 'actual', 'piece', 'real', 'justice', 'occurs', 'process', 'freeing', 'framed', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'sitting', 'stir', 'negligence', 'disbelief', 'innocence', 'seeing', 'vicious', 'killer', 'jolt', 'up', 'Q', 'Therefore', 'see', 'had', 'wrong', 'rough', 'justice', 'world', 'one', 'had', 'better', 'not', 'kill', 'off', 'lawyers', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'amount', 'twists', 'getting', 'there', 'fairly', 'well-worn', 'now', 'movie-dom', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'see']",The Lincoln Lawyer

Matthew McConaughey plays a defense lawyer who cheerfully takes on guilty clients. In fact he relishes the guilty clients as he knows how to manipulate the system on their behalf and dreads ever having an innocent client as the weight of that responsibility would be unbearable.One day he is presented with a client accused of rape. The client is a typical spoiled rich kid, but McConaughey begins to suspect he is innocent and has his trusted investigator try and sort out exactly what happened. The journey to the truth is interesting and never over-wrought. Even the violence, when it comes feels organic and truthful. It is violence an actual person would commit in similar circumstances rather than heroic movie violence. The characters experience personal growth but no grand epiphanies with soaring music. Yet the movie is engaging throughout. Truly a balance between drama and realism.The acting is superb, even the smaller roles are well done and believable.

1398835,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004EPYZP8,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Walking into `The Lincoln Lawyer', I was well aware that the film itself would have to work extra hard to earn my respect.  I don't really care much for courtroom dramas, and I find Matthew McConaughey to be a really dull presence on screen.  I know that everyone swoons over him and talks about his `Southern Charm', but I just don't buy it.  On top of that, I just don't find him to be a convincing actor.  I don't see layers in his work; I merely see a lazy approach to telling the same character over and over.  There has been a lot of talk of the sudden upswing in his career, starting with this particular film and moving right on into his string of successful turns this year.  Much has been made of his Oscar chances for `Magic Mike' and he's getting career best notices for the savage drama `Killer Joe'.  Needless to say, I didn't care much.  I have yet to see any of his films from this year and I wasn't really anticipating them much to tell you the truth.  When I hear the name Matthew McConaughey I don't expect much.So, last night I settled in to catch up on my DVR recordings and I noticed that I had `The Lincoln Lawyer' on my DVR.  I didn't record it, must have been the wife, but I wasn't really in the mood to think and so I decided to give it a whirl, since I expected it to be `good' at best and hardly something I'd feel compelled to dissect.I have to learn to stop judging every book by its cover.As a film, `The Lincoln Lawyer' is riveting and kept me glued throughout.  I was stunned.  The plot twists are engaging, and while the obviousness of the `villain' is a little too on the nose from the start, it becomes an easily forgivable offence since they aren't really interested in keeping his innocence ambiguous for very long.  The progression of the plot is well done and expertly paced by director Brad Furman, who holds onto the tension efficiently.  The final courtroom scene is pulse-racing for sure, and basically exemplifies everything that a courtroom drama should be.  In fact, I loved the fact that I never knew what Mick's next move would be and why he was making it, but when it all fell into place it made perfect sense.And that brings me to Mick, or should I say, Matthew McConaughey.  Why do I call this a case of Oscar snubbery?  I don't know if I'd personally nominate him, considering that last year was ridiculously strong, but a very solid case can be made for McConaughey being a snub because this role is every bit a perfect one to garner a star their first Oscar nomination.  What McConaughey does here is actually quite remarkable, and I don't say there merely because he took me by surprise or because I expected him to fail.  Any other actor in the role doing what he does would have garnered the same response from me.  I am not one to shy away from eating crow, and that is what I must do here.Something that I have always accused Matthew of doing is giving us a surface performance, with no actual depth.  I understand that in the beginning of his career he tried the whole `soul searching drama' stuff, and he did do `A Time to Kill' and yet I didn't care much for what he did in that film and so it doesn't count for me.  I've never felt that he has ever gotten under the skin of the character much at all; until now.  As Mick Haller, McConaughey layers so much on this man it's ridiculous.  In fact, the more I think about it the more stunned I am by the scope of his performance.  Mick is suave and under control and possesses that `Southern Charm' and sheer confidence that makes him a firm presence in any room.  That is something that McConaughey should be able to handle in his sleep.  But it is the tiny layers of panic that ride through his face when no one is looking that took me by surprise.  Mick wasn't just a stone, and as this `case' took over his personal life and threatened him in the severest of ways, you saw those cracks.  McConaughey let us in to see the inner turmoil, but then batted an eyelash and firmed up his stance and delivered a `performance' for the rest of the room that read otherwise.  Mick is a showman, and McConaughey mastered that aspect of his persona with ease.  The way he plays his part in the courtroom or the way he betrays his own panic by laying a threat of confidence out on his `client' is compelling and 100% believable.  The anger that floods his motives is also stirring and he sells his biggest moments with such authenticity.  I appreciated that he never overacted here, and there was place for it.  Instead, he displayed an honest depiction of emotional outbursts that stayed true to the man he was portraying.When all is said and done, Mick Haller may be human, but he is one cool cat.So, I give this very high marks.  The film is intriguing and engrossing from start to finish.  It has the ability to veer into `television courtroom drama' territory, as do a lot of films in this genre, and yet it pulls back with a glossy treatment and a plot that thickens rather well.  It's more `CSI: Miami' than `Law & Order', but Matthew McConaughey delivers a star performance that puts David Caruso to shame.",5,Crimes in Oscar Snubbery...,1345766400,"08 24,

The extras explain that Matthew McConaghey's lawyer character works out of his Lincoln Continental car. Maybe I'm slow on the uptake but if the whole setup was this lawyer found it more convenient to work from his car, then I missed that. Even though there are lots of scenes of him going to and from court to wherever driven by his chauffeur, I just thought the open briefcase, the talking on the cell phone and the meeting up with the Hell's Angels clients on the road were all they were.In another scene you see McConaghey going through old files in his garage so I just assumed he worked out of his home. Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.The extras also pointed out by the book's author upon which the movie is based that the action occurs in this one justice area in Van Nuys, California, that houses various buildings such as a holding jail, courthouse and various bail bonds offices. In the movie I never figured that out as when they cut from scenes in each of these places you never really see McConaghey walk from one building to the next.So in this sense despite a terrific movie that has great characters, tremendous twists and turns, great supporting cast (Marisa Tomei and John Leguizamo are among the ""names"") a very evil Ryan Philippe, I don't think the director who converted the book to screen if it took the extras (which are all pretty terrific) really was able to give us a sense that much of the courtroom and prisoner-lawyer scenes were all within virtually the same block.The extras (and sorry to go on about them more than the actual movie but they really are terrific) also had the author Michael Connelly (a former LA Times crime reporter)take us on a drive around the LA of the Lincoln lawyer which was endlessly fascinating and very much Raymond Chandler-esque.",4,updated LA noir,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1888,"['First', ""'ll"", 'be', 'upfront', 'movie', 'never', 'got', 'title', 'saw', 'extras', 'extras', 'explain', 'Matthew', 'McConaghey', 'lawyer', 'character', 'Lincoln', 'Continental', 'car', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'slow', 'uptake', 'whole', 'setup', 'was', 'lawyer', 'found', 'more', 'convenient', 'work', 'car', 'then', 'missed', 'Even', 'are', 'lots', 'scenes', 'going', 'court', 'wherever', 'driven', 'chauffeur', 'just', 'thought', 'open', 'briefcase', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'meeting', 'up', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'clients', 'road', 'were', 'were.In', 'scene', 'see', 'McConaghey', 'going', 'old', 'files', 'garage', 'so', 'just', 'assumed', 'worked', 'home', 'Anyway', 'where', ""'m"", 'coming', 'from.The', 'extras', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'book', 'author', 'movie', 'based', 'action', 'one', 'justice', 'area', 'Van', 'Nuys', 'California', 'houses', 'various', 'buildings', 'such', 'holding', 'jail', 'courthouse', 'various', 'bail', 'bonds', 'offices', 'movie', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'when', 'cut', 'scenes', 'places', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'McConaghey', 'walk', 'one', 'building', 'next.So', 'sense', 'terrific', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'tremendous', 'twists', 'turns', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'are', 'names', 'very', 'evil', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'director', 'who', 'converted', 'book', 'screen', 'took', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'really', 'was', 'able', 'give', 'sense', 'much', 'courtroom', 'prisoner-lawyer', 'scenes', 'were', 'virtually', 'same', 'block.The', 'extras', 'sorry', 'go', 'more', 'actual', 'movie', 'really', 'are', 'terrific', 'also', 'had', 'author', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'former', 'LA', 'Times', 'crime', 'reporter', 'take', 'drive', 'LA', 'Lincoln', 'lawyer', 'was', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'very', 'much', 'Raymond', 'Chandler-esque']",The Lincoln Lawyer

He does a good job but I hope he gets another kind of role soon.My problem with this film is with the women and specifically the mother of the defendant, played by Frances Fisher. Fisher does a fine job.  However, I read the book years ago and I seem to remember that the mother's role is a lot more complex than the way it is presented in the movie. In fact, the mother's role in the book is a doozy.  So I did not like losing that aspect.I'm not sure how many more of these ex wife type of roles Marisa Tomei can play.  I think she may be reaching the end of the line with these roles and needs to start looking at more mature parts.Essentially in this film we have a client, Phillipe, taking over the case by taking one step after another to back his attorney into a corner. Worse yet, the lawyer has a small daughter and has to worry about his client using his daughter's safety to control him.If I had to choose between reading the book and watching the movie, it would be no contest.  I'd pick the book.

Macy, Michael Pena, John Leguizamo and Josh LucasWRITTEN BY: John Romano; based on the novel by Michael ConnellyDIRECTED BY: Brad FurmanRated: RGenre: Drama / ThrillerRelease Date: 18 March 2011Review Date: 18 March 2011The Lincoln Lawyer was a refreshing film for two paramount reasons: it's one of the top films of the year and its Matthew McConaughey's best performance to date. I generally like McConaughey movies but he's played a lot of goofballs.More often than not he's a buffoon or a slacker who has beautiful women flocking to him and we never question it because he's Matthew McConaughey. The ladies in his films never question it for this same reason and because he usually has his shirt off. But here he's charming, intelligent, slick, and meticulously perfect at everything; particularly the work he does from the back seat of his Lincoln. We'd believe any woman's attraction to him. Ironically, only one woman shows interest in him and it's an old flame.She's Maggie, played by the lovely Marisa Tomei. The two are lawyers who remain friends who may want a little more. The iceberg between them is that they are on either sides of the fence when it comes to the law. She wants bad guys behind bars; he couldn't care less if they're on the street so long as they can afford his hefty fees.McConaughey slides into the role of Mick Haller with great ease and does a tremendous job. Mick lives to be in a courtroom and finds great euphoria in winning and knowing that he will win without question. We love watching him in action. As good as this film was, I imagine the detail that went into the novel, of which it's based, was even more enticing. Even John Grisham is likely a fan.We spend the first several minutes of the film being acquainted with the big sleaze ball Mick is. He handles multiple cases at a time: hookers, drug dealers, whatever; and seems to have them settled in his head before he even steps foot in court.All that changes however with his latest client: a rich kid accused of a brutal rape (Ryan Philippe). All fingers point to his being guilty, but he insists otherwise. Ryan Philippe isn't as good here as he was as a similar rich snob in Cruel Intentions, but he's pretty close.To reveal what happens next would be inconceivable to anyone who's seen the film. It spirals out of control over and over and it's the kind of film that makes you think while entertaining the hell out of you. It's one of those rare movies that actually could happen yet still has us captivated. Oh, and McConaughey only removes his shirt once.",5,The Lincoln Lawyer Review,1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2647,"['LINCOLN', 'LAWYERSTARRING', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Josh', 'LucasWRITTEN', 'BY', 'John', 'Romano', 'based', 'novel', 'Michael', 'ConnellyDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Brad', 'FurmanRated', 'RGenre', 'Drama', '/', 'ThrillerRelease', 'Date', '18', 'March', '2011Review', 'Date', '18', 'March', '2011The', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'was', 'refreshing', 'film', 'two', 'paramount', 'reasons', 'one', 'top', 'films', 'year', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'generally', 'McConaughey', 'movies', 'played', 'lot', 'goofballs.More', 'often', 'not', 'buffoon', 'slacker', 'who', 'beautiful', 'women', 'flocking', 'never', 'question', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'ladies', 'films', 'never', 'question', 'same', 'reason', 'usually', 'shirt', 'off', 'here', 'charming', 'intelligent', 'slick', 'meticulously', 'perfect', 'everything', 'particularly', 'work', 'back', 'seat', 'Lincoln', ""'d"", 'believe', 'woman', 'attraction', 'Ironically', 'only', 'one', 'woman', 'interest', 'old', 'flame.She', 'Maggie', 'played', 'lovely', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'two', 'are', 'lawyers', 'who', 'remain', 'friends', 'who', 'may', 'want', 'little', 'more', 'iceberg', 'are', 'sides', 'fence', 'when', 'law', 'bad', 'guys', 'bars', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', ""'re"", 'street', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'afford', 'hefty', 'fees.McConaughey', 'role', 'Mick', 'Haller', 'great', 'ease', 'tremendous', 'job', 'Mick', 'be', 'courtroom', 'great', 'euphoria', 'winning', 'knowing', 'will', 'win', 'question', 'love', 'watching', 'action', 'As', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'imagine', 'detail', 'went', 'novel', 'based', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'enticing', 'Even', 'John', 'Grisham', 'likely', 'fan.We', 'spend', 'first', 'several', 'minutes', 'film', 'being', 'acquainted', 'big', 'sleaze', 'ball', 'Mick', 'multiple', 'cases', 'time', 'hookers', 'drug', 'dealers', 'have', 'settled', 'head', 'even', 'foot', 'court.All', 'however', 'latest', 'client', 'rich', 'kid', 'accused', 'brutal', 'rape', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'fingers', 'point', 'being', 'guilty', 'otherwise', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'here', 'was', 'similar', 'rich', 'snob', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'pretty', 'close.To', 'reveal', 'what', 'next', 'would', 'be', 'inconceivable', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'control', 'kind', 'film', 'think', 'entertaining', 'hell', 'one', 'rare', 'movies', 'actually', 'could', 'happen', 'yet', 'still', 'captivated', 'Oh', 'McConaughey', 'only', 'shirt', 'once']",The Lincoln Lawyer

1398910,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B004EPYZP8,DanD,"[1, 1]","Mick Haller is a street-smart lawyer with an ex-wife, a young daughter, and an ego.  His bondsman has just snagged him another case: Louis Roulet, accused of sexual assault and attempted murder.  Roulet professes innocence, and Haller, for once, believes him.  But the case is deeper and murkier than it appears on the surface, and Haller is about to be confronted with something even worse than an innocent client: true evil.Brad Furman's THE LINCOLN LAWYER hews fairly close to the Michael Connolly source novel for the first two-thirds, which presents some good things (suspense, an interesting lead character) and bad things (major plot holes and contrivances).  Matthew McConaughey is perfect for the role of Haller (apparently, Connolly himself wanted McConaughey for the role); he never truly sinks his teeth in, but he's sufficiently charming, troubled, and devious to keep you entertained.  The film features a great deal of talented actors (Bryan Cranston, John Leguizamo, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Shea Whigham, and Michael Pena) who never truly get their chance to shine, and other mediocre actors (Josh Lucas, Ryan Phillippe, even Trace Adkins for God's sake) who get stuck with two-dimensional characters.In it's final act, though, THE LINCOLN LAWYER diverges from the novel, and this presents a major problem: the moral ambiguity Connolly built up so effectively is utterly lost.  This doesn't completely ruin the movie--note the three stars--but it puts a damper on things.  Still, fans of the genre won't care.  If you want a slick thriller, with a touch of suspense, a charming lead, and a bit of intrigue, THE LINCOLN LAWYER is right up your (well-lit) alley.",3,"A slick, breezy, entertaining legal thriller.",1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,1683,"['Mick', 'Haller', 'street-smart', 'lawyer', 'ex-wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'ego', 'bondsman', 'just', 'snagged', 'case', 'Louis', 'Roulet', 'accused', 'sexual', 'assault', 'attempted', 'murder', 'Roulet', 'innocence', 'Haller', 'once', 'case', 'deeper', 'murkier', 'surface', 'Haller', 'be', 'confronted', 'something', 'even', 'worse', 'innocent', 'client', 'true', 'evil.Brad', 'Furman', 'THE', 'LINCOLN', 'LAWYER', 'fairly', 'close', 'Michael', 'Connolly', 'source', 'novel', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'good', 'things', 'suspense', 'interesting', 'lead', 'character', 'bad', 'things', 'major', 'plot', 'holes', 'contrivances', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'perfect', 'role', 'Haller', 'apparently', 'Connolly', 'wanted', 'McConaughey', 'role', 'never', 'truly', 'teeth', 'sufficiently', 'charming', 'troubled', 'devious', 'keep', 'entertained', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'talented', 'actors', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Shea', 'Whigham', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'who', 'never', 'truly', 'get', 'chance', 'shine', 'other', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'even', 'Trace', 'Adkins', 'God', 'sake', 'who', 'get', 'stuck', 'two-dimensional', 'characters.In', 'final', 'act', 'though', 'THE', 'LINCOLN', 'LAWYER', 'novel', 'major', 'problem', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Connolly', 'built', 'up', 'so', 'effectively', 'utterly', 'lost', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ruin', 'movie', 'note', 'three', 'stars', 'damper', 'things', 'Still', 'fans', 'genre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'want', 'slick', 'thriller', 'touch', 'suspense', 'charming', 'lead', 'bit', 'intrigue', 'THE', 'LINCOLN', 'LAWYER', 'right', 'well-lit', 'alley']",The Lincoln Lawyer

1398936,AU32ZJ0LGMBSA,B004EPYZP8,"dgdbear ""David""","[3, 5]","The MovieWhat we have here is a nice thriller about a lawyer named Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) taking a case that he will soon find out details and clues as to what he really has got himself involved in. Without giving anything away, the case he gets involved in is about a 32 year old male named Louis Roulet (played by Ryan Philippe) accused of beating up a prostitute. What Haller finds out throughout the case is clues about other cases he has took and all of this leads to frustration considering he finds out he is sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place (you will see why when you watch). The story does take time to evolve. Actually, things go quite slowly for the first 40 minutes or so and then things get going after that. There is a slow build up of suspense throughout, but for what its worth, the 2 hour run time does seem a bit longer considering how dragged out parts of the movie were. On the other hand, we have a good supporting cast around McConaughey including Ryan Philippe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, and even our buddy Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad makes a couple of brief appearances. I thought all the characters did a very good job in this film, however, The Lincoln Lawyer was all too predictable for the most part which made it less enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. Perhaps the end of the movie picked up too quickly and a lot of things happened at once, but overall this movie deserves a 4 rating which in my book is pretty good, but not great.Video QualityDepth is very strong and black levels are deep. This is a very detailed and impressive presentation for the most part. The views outside had quite a bit of depth to them. Palm trees, pavement, scenery, you name it, had high amounts of detail. The presentation was also nice and filmic. There were some scenes with some very light banding if I had one nitpick. Otherwise the video quality is pretty awesome.Audio QualityThis is not going to be your big budget action movie with explosions, but the DTS-HD MA track got the job done. It does contain a 7.1 mix so those of you with a 7.1 setup will surely be pleased. If you are renting the disc it looks like there is only a 5.1 mix which is really stupid if you ask. Lionsgate must have pressed different copies for the rental edition. Anyways, this is primarily a dialogue driven film and it is delivered very well. The surround speakers were used quite well too at times. You could pick up a lot of little things that were going on in and around the court room from time to time. Better yet was the hip hop tunes that would play and the scenes with the motorcycles. The sound stage came alive during these scenes.",5,Enjoyable,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2683,"['MovieWhat', 'have', 'here', 'nice', 'thriller', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Mickey', 'Haller', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'taking', 'case', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'details', 'clues', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'involved', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'case', 'involved', '32', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'named', 'Louis', 'Roulet', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'accused', 'beating', 'up', 'prostitute', 'What', 'Haller', 'out', 'case', 'clues', 'other', 'cases', 'took', 'frustration', 'considering', 'out', 'sort', 'stuck', 'rock', 'hard', 'place', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'when', 'watch', 'story', 'take', 'time', 'evolve', 'Actually', 'things', 'go', 'quite', 'slowly', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'going', 'slow', 'build', 'suspense', 'what', 'worth', '2', 'hour', 'run', 'time', 'seem', 'bit', 'longer', 'considering', 'how', 'dragged', 'out', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'McConaughey', 'including', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'even', 'buddy', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'couple', 'brief', 'appearances', 'thought', 'characters', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'however', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'was', 'too', 'predictable', 'most', 'part', 'made', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Perhaps', 'end', 'movie', 'picked', 'up', 'too', 'quickly', 'lot', 'things', 'happened', 'once', 'overall', 'movie', '4', 'rating', 'book', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great.Video', 'QualityDepth', 'very', 'strong', 'black', 'levels', 'are', 'deep', 'very', 'detailed', 'impressive', 'presentation', 'most', 'part', 'views', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'depth', 'Palm', 'trees', 'pavement', 'scenery', 'name', 'had', 'high', 'amounts', 'detail', 'presentation', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'filmic', 'were', 'scenes', 'very', 'light', 'banding', 'had', 'one', 'nitpick', 'Otherwise', 'video', 'quality', 'pretty', 'awesome.Audio', 'QualityThis', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'movie', 'explosions', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', 'track', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'contain', '7.1', 'mix', 'so', '7.1', 'setup', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'pleased', 'are', 'renting', 'disc', 'only', '5.1', 'mix', 'really', 'stupid', 'ask', 'Lionsgate', 'must', 'have', 'pressed', 'different', 'copies', 'rental', 'edition', 'Anyways', 'primarily', 'dialogue', 'driven', 'film', 'delivered', 'very', 'well', 'surround', 'speakers', 'were', 'used', 'quite', 'well', 'too', 'times', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'lot', 'little', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'court', 'room', 'time', 'time', 'Better', 'yet', 'was', 'hip', 'hop', 'tunes', 'would', 'play', 'scenes', 'motorcycles', 'sound', 'stage', 'came', 'alive', 'scenes']",The Lincoln Lawyer

He really is electric here, further bolstering his impressive portfolio of attorney roles; he's got that way of being slick and in command and approachable without coming across as a douchebag--vital ingredients to pulling the Haller character off. And though we may be deprived of a neck-twisting Primal Fear-like twist, the thrills are still potent and the payoff is rewarding.

While I haven't read the original novel, my wife and I figured ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" might be a good midweek flick, and we were right.McConaughey is Mickey Haller, a defense attorney who seems to do most of his business from the back of an old Lincoln. He's shrewd, wily, and fits right in with those he represents from the shadier side of the streets. As far as he's concerned, he doesn't ever have to feel bad if he loses a case because he knows all his clients are essentially guilty. It seems, though, that his father once warned him about the day he would represent an innocent client. Sure enough, his father's warning proves prescient when Haller ends up being retained by an ultra-wealthy L.A. client, a young man played by Ryan Philippe. This man has been accused of assaulting a hooker in the midst of a transaction, and indeed he was discovered with her blood on his hands, but he swears his innocence.Haller takes the case. He makes a lot of money from it. But he also uncovers some small lies by his client. What is his client trying to protect? Does it have something to do with a rich mother who suffered abuse of her own? Soon Haller is getting pulled back into an old case and is questioning his own judgment, even while trying to make amends with his ex-wife and his young daughter.It's pretty obvious early on that something is not right, but the manner in which this unfolds, both in the courtroom and on the streets, makes this a fast-paced and entertaining story. It has some lessons hidden in there about justice and the flaws in the legal system, particularly apropos after the Casey Anthony trial, but it never rises to greatness. There are some sloppy moments that may have worked better in book form. For example, I kept wondering how a Maserati managed to go unnoticed in slum areas, especially when the driver was supposed to be oh, so intelligent.In the long run, Haller lives up to his own tarnished and questionable character by meting out justice on his own terms. He doesn't prove himself above the law, but he does show that he has a penchant for wanting the truth and wanting justice at all costs, if it means protecting the truly innocent. It leads to some interesting ethical discussions without ever taking itself too seriously in the process.",4,In Light of Casey Anthony,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2361,"[""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'fan', 'did', 'like', 'Time', 'Kill', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'original', 'novel', 'wife', 'figured', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'midweek', 'flick', 'were', 'right.McConaughey', 'Mickey', 'Haller', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'do', 'most', 'business', 'back', 'old', 'Lincoln', 'shrewd', 'wily', 'fits', 'right', 'shadier', 'side', 'streets', 'As', 'far', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'feel', 'bad', 'case', 'clients', 'are', 'essentially', 'guilty', 'though', 'father', 'once', 'warned', 'day', 'would', 'represent', 'innocent', 'client', 'Sure', 'enough', 'father', 'warning', 'proves', 'prescient', 'when', 'Haller', 'up', 'being', 'retained', 'ultra-wealthy', 'L.A.', 'client', 'young', 'man', 'played', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'man', 'been', 'accused', 'assaulting', 'hooker', 'midst', 'transaction', 'indeed', 'was', 'discovered', 'blood', 'hands', 'innocence.Haller', 'case', 'lot', 'money', 'also', 'small', 'lies', 'client', 'What', 'client', 'trying', 'protect', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'rich', 'mother', 'who', 'suffered', 'abuse', 'own', 'Soon', 'Haller', 'getting', 'pulled', 'back', 'old', 'case', 'questioning', 'own', 'judgment', 'even', 'trying', 'make', 'amends', 'ex-wife', 'young', 'daughter.It', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'early', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'manner', 'unfolds', 'courtroom', 'streets', 'fast-paced', 'entertaining', 'story', 'lessons', 'hidden', 'justice', 'flaws', 'legal', 'system', 'particularly', 'apropos', 'Casey', 'Anthony', 'trial', 'never', 'greatness', 'are', 'sloppy', 'moments', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'book', 'form', 'example', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'Maserati', 'managed', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'slum', 'areas', 'especially', 'when', 'driver', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'oh', 'so', 'intelligent.In', 'long', 'run', 'Haller', 'up', 'own', 'tarnished', 'questionable', 'character', 'meting', 'out', 'justice', 'own', 'terms', ""n't"", 'prove', 'law', 'show', 'penchant', 'wanting', 'truth', 'wanting', 'justice', 'costs', 'protecting', 'truly', 'innocent', 'interesting', 'ethical', 'discussions', 'ever', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'process']",The Lincoln Lawyer

The film adaptation stays loyal to the novel, and is very entertaining.Matthew McConaughey portrays the main character Mickey Haller as a kind of lovable, bad boy. Haller is a lawyer who has made a career of representing criminals and outcasts. He runs his practice out of his old Lincoln, and drives around town looking for his next case. Early on in the film, we are introduced to his ex-wife, played by Marisa Tomei, with whom he has a young daughters. It is in these moments that we get to see the softer side of Haller.The story really gets moving when Haller is called to represent Roulet, a high profile, Los Angeles playboy who is accused of murdering a prostitute. Despite a bad gut feeling, Haller knows that this case could be the high point of his career. With the help of his own investigator Frank Levin, played by a show-stealing William H. Macey, Haller soon finds a connection to a previous case that has haunted him for years.Overall, the film is a great mix of action, intrigue and comedy. McConaughey's everyman persona really helps Haller to be relatable and an effective protagonist. Ryan Phillippe is surprisingly effective at staying in the grey area as Roulet. The real star of the movie is Macey, who's appearance is cut short way too soon. This movie effectively captures the essence of Connelly's novel while still adjusting to the new medium.

This is one of the stronger movies of the year, the kind of film that reminds us of the art of cinema.Mike Haller (Matthew McConaughey in a brilliant performance) is a money hungry smarmy defense lawyer whose brilliant mind is bent toward representing sleazy types who pay well.  He works out of his Lincoln automobile driven by his trusted ally Earl (Laurence Mason), lives in a dumpy apartment, works with a shoddy appearing detective Frank (William H Macy), and spars with the beautiful fellow lawyer Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei) with whom he has a daughter and an on again off again relationship. One of his fellow workers Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo) tips Mike on a case of  wealthy realtor Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of beating a prostitute: the case smells of lots of money so Mike of course takes it on - along with Louis, wealthy mother Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher) and the family lawyer Cecil Dobbs (Bob Gunton).  Mike's investigation turns up evidence that suggests his client is not the 'presumed innocent' he appears and there are connections between this case and an old case Mike handled - Jesus Martinez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) - and Mike's usual 'go for the money' attitude takes a turn toward actually seeking justice in the courtroom. A shady dealing lawyer does actually have a conscience and finds a way to prove the truth will out.There are many cameo roles worthy of mentioning - Josh Lucas plays the prosecuting attorney Ted Minton, Pell James is Mike's girl Friday Lorna, Margarita Levieva is the victim prostitute Reggie Campo, Trace Adkins plays the motorcycle gang head Eddie Vogel, and Shea Whigham inhabits the role of the jail snitch DJ Corliss.  But the major attraction here is Matthew McConaughey's Oscar worthy role: he is magnetic in his transformation from a lawyer you want to loathe to a victor you want to hail.

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Sometimes, a pretty boy actor doesn't get interesting until he's developed a few more wrinkles on his face, gravitas on his mug, suggesting a life having lived. Of late, Matthew McConaughey has been dismissed by naysayers as a good-looking huckster, grinning that toothy grin, flexing those ripped abs. And he hasn't done himself any favors with his recent cinematic outings (GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, really?). THE LINCOLN LAWYER, adapted from Michael Connelly's novel, should get his critics off his back some. It's a corker of a legal thriller, and McConaughey hasn't been this watchable in years.McConaughey plays Mick Haller, Los Angeles's slickest criminal defense attorney, the sort of sleazy legal practitioner that Atticus Finch longs to take behind the woodshed. Mick, who works out of the back seat of his classic Lincoln Town Car, has sold out a long time ago. He doesn't give an ef if a guy is guilty or not as long as the money's good. He lists on his rolodex some of L.A.'s shadiest lowlifes. Although, this time out, he's landed a posh client (Ryan Phillippe) accused of assault and attempted murder, except that this uppercrust young gent claims his innocence. But they all say they're innocent, ain't that so? Mick Haller regards this as a slam-dunk case. The rest of us know better. Strap in for a rollercoaster ride of ruses, runarounds, and reversals.It's a solid supporting cast. I am so glad Marisa Tomei got cast instead of some vapid model-type. Tomei is a real-looking woman and beautiful. She plays Mick Haller's fierce rival in court, a tough prosecutor as well as his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter. When the chips are down, she becomes Mick's most steadfast anchor. William H. Macy again makes lemonade out of lemon with his otherwise-would've-been-blah part of Mick's investigator. John Leguizamo does his usual squirrelly thing as a bail bondsman who tips off Mick to this plum case (but even that's a lie). In just a few short scenes Michael Pe&ntilde;a provides one of the film's most sobering moments as he transitions from Mick's weepy panic-struck client to a hardened, dead-eyed convict. Josh Lucas, whom I always regarded as something of a McConaughey look-alike, goes up against McConaughey in court and he's pretty workmanlike, but not bad.There's enough twisty material here to make you lean into the screen. As Mick unearths deception after deception, he begins to suspect that his rich client may well be guilty (but is he?). One knock against the plot is that it does seem a bit too contrived that one of Mick's old cases happens to tie into this new one. There's a nasty, low-down feel to this story, a scruffy edginess, and it grips you. McConaughey invests a measure of grit and slime into his performance, and I really enjoyed it. Check out his Mick Haller, sly as a serpent, fast-talking, deal-making, working all the angles, scruples gathering dust on the shelf. Except that there may be a twinge of righteousness still left in Mick Haller which might make him turn a corner. Or is that another red herring? THE LINCOLN LAWYER doesn't achieve the heights of THE VERDICT or A FEW GOOD MEN, but it does what it sets out to do. It is a ripping legal thriller and comes at you with attitude. It is hopefully the first in a film franchise. After all, Michael Connelly's written four novels starring our morally grey counselor. And McConaughey's got them wrinkles now. Take advantage of that, yo.",4,"McConaughey's best movie since, um... Reign of Fire? Edtv?

You have to reach back a way, but it was Time to Kill, where he played a lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a high profile case in which there are questions of the defendant's actual guilt.  It should come as no surprise then, that his role as Mick Haller - a slick-talking, deal-cutting, lowlife-defending criminal defense lawyer whose life gets turned upside down after taking a nearly identical case (at least outwardly) - produces a crisp, if somewhat unoriginal, movie high on intense legal thrills and unsolved mysteries.  The primary dissimilarity is rather than superb oratory skills used on a sympathetic jury, Haller uses the flaws and loopholes in the legal system to his advantage in an effort to correct wrongs as he sees them.  This does not gain him favor with the prosecuting attorneys who view Haller as bottom-feeding scum.  Secondary to lawyer differences is the client.  Instead of a poor black man it's a rich white man (Ryan Phillipe as Louis Roulet, perfect casting for the entitled WASP).  The two movies are so similar McConaughey even has a hot wife in this one (Marisa Tomei); although, she's not as hot as her film predecessor (Ashley Judd).  Speaking of Judd, this movie is believable, unlike the legal dramas she's been in.  Which is probably why it's so engrossing.When a man (Roulet) accused of beating a hooker (Hooker), a sleazy bail-bondsman (Leguizamo) gets Haller and his P.I. (Macy) the case.  Once the details begin to get exposed, mystery and truth is revealed.  As the shady deals, criminal informants, and plot twists unravel, The Lincoln Lawyer displays how a superb mystery can be crafted without a ton of extraneous fluff thrown in for no other reason than masturbatory screen-writing.An all around fine film that has very little room for improvement.

1399022,A2U94E760UDYMH,B004EPYZP8,"JKH ""JKH""","[2, 3]","This film is about a criminal defense lawyer who practices out of his Lincoln Towncar.  The movie embraces many of the lawyer stereotypes and shows Attorney Mickey Haller (played by McConaughey) wheeling and dealing with his clients to make a buck.  For instance, in several scenes, Haller is shown strong-arming his criminal clients into paying by delaying a trial or making up excuses about the costs of expert witnesses.  Much of what was shown would be unethical and violate the rules of professional responsibility applicable to all attorneys.  But, it makes for good drama.Without giving too much away, one underlying issue is the impact of the ""attorney-client privilege"" (a rule that forbids disclosure of confidential information about a client) as it relates to his representation of a present client while learning of information that could exonerate a former client.  Throughout the plot, the audience is given a few twists as Haller investigates the crime and learns what ""really"" happened.  In my opinion, most are predictable.  But, it is clever how they put it all together in this film.One of the most interesting parts, in my view, is how Haller gets around attorney-client privilege and cleverly obtains justice in the end.  When you watch it, notice when the detective asks ""why did you subpoena me"" to come to the trial.  The reason is obvious if you think back to the detective's asking about the client who was in San Quentin and the implication that the detective was familiar with that case.In the end, it is a great legal drama.",4,Pretty good courtroom drama,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,1554,"['film', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'who', 'practices', 'Lincoln', 'Towncar', 'movie', 'many', 'lawyer', 'stereotypes', 'Attorney', 'Mickey', 'Haller', 'played', 'McConaughey', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'clients', 'make', 'buck', 'instance', 'several', 'scenes', 'Haller', 'shown', 'strong-arming', 'criminal', 'clients', 'paying', 'delaying', 'trial', 'making', 'up', 'excuses', 'costs', 'expert', 'witnesses', 'Much', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'would', 'be', 'unethical', 'violate', 'rules', 'professional', 'responsibility', 'applicable', 'attorneys', 'good', 'drama.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'one', 'underlying', 'issue', 'impact', 'attorney-client', 'privilege', 'rule', 'disclosure', 'confidential', 'information', 'client', 'representation', 'present', 'client', 'learning', 'information', 'could', 'exonerate', 'former', 'client', 'plot', 'audience', 'given', 'few', 'twists', 'Haller', 'crime', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'opinion', 'most', 'are', 'predictable', 'clever', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'film.One', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'view', 'how', 'Haller', 'attorney-client', 'privilege', 'cleverly', 'obtains', 'justice', 'end', 'When', 'watch', 'notice', 'when', 'detective', 'why', 'did', 'subpoena', 'come', 'trial', 'reason', 'obvious', 'think', 'back', 'detective', 'asking', 'client', 'who', 'was', 'San', 'Quentin', 'implication', 'detective', 'was', 'familiar', 'end', 'great', 'legal', 'drama']",The Lincoln Lawyer

Rooney,"[5, 8]","""The Lincoln Lawyer"" with more twists and turns than a corkscrew reminded me of those classic L.A. crime thrillers like ""Chinatown,"" and the hardboiled school of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and James M. Cain. Mickey Haller is a shrewd lawyer who manipulates the law, but can't stand it when he gets set-up and framed. In this one there are multiple set-ups. It is very cleverly woven together. The acting is serviceable and effective, but not superb. It is filmed very neatly with a fast pace that adds to the suspense. It is partly courtroom histrionics, but much of the action takes place outside the courtroom.Mickey is played by Matthew McConaughey, and he is well-cast for the part as is Ryan Phillippe, his client who is accused of an assault upon a woman. Mickey is a scammer who even scams the stuffy family attorney with a videotaping scheme.At the beginning everything happens at a breakneck speed, and it is difficult to hear the rapid conversation. It settles down, and we catch our breath. Phillippe plays spoiled and wealthy Louis Roulet who fervently pleads his innocence. Haller has been dealing with the lower echelons of the accused, and he needs a financial break. He's represented a member of a biker gang, a mob that shows up regularly in the movie and comes in handy. Other unsavory clients and cases have been Haller's stock and trade. He gets chauffered around in a Lincoln limo by a man who owes Mickey money for handling his drug case.Get ready for layers of plot intrigue, ploys and mazes within mazes. Never try to scam a scammer, because he's probably going to catch on. I got pulled into this narrative, and the time flew by.Author Michael Connelly has consistently turned out the best American crime novels of anyone out there. His detective Harry Bosch is legendary. Mickey Haller is a good addition to the Connelly cast.

1399032,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004EPYZP8,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[13, 15]","Matthew McConaughey is a talented actor who has spent the last ten years making forgettable romantic-comedies that stunt his ability to show his range. While The Lincoln Lawyer does not have him stepping into Oscar-worthy territory, it's a role that renews faith in his ability as an actor. Additionally, it's a solid film with a tremendous supporting cast and confident direction from relative newcomer Brad Furman (whose IMDB picture, with his Good Charlotte T-shirt and sideways hat, would not lead you to believe he was capable of making a coherent film).McConaughey plays Mick Haller, a smooth-talking Los Angeles defense attorney who operates out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car, defending garden-variety criminals who can pay the right price. Mick is very good at his job and clearly fond of the luxuries it affords. When his driver, Earl, asks him if he can keep the job after Mick gets his license back, Mick replies ""I got my license back three months ago, Earl."" Out of the blue, a bail bondsman named Val (John Leguizamo) approaches Mick with an offer to defend a high-profile client; Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), the son of a wealthy real estate mogul, has been accused of brutally assaulting a prostitute. Louis vehemently professes his innocence and, although he is suspicious, Mick takes the job. Along with Frank Levin (William H. Macy), his investigator, Mick begins analyzing the evidence to build his case and finds discrepancies that only make his suspicions stronger...The Lincoln Lawyer starts with a strong script, no doubt adapted from a strong book. I am not familiar with the author of the novel, Michael Connelly, but the last film adapted from one of his books was the 2002 Clint Eastwood thriller Blood Work, which was well-received. Two solid films out of two ain't bad; I think it's a safe bet that he's got talent. The script follows the formula of including a twist at every opportunity and this twisty plot keeps the film surprising and interesting. There are elements that require you to suspend your disbelief a bit (nothing too extraordinary, just too convenient) and it does get contrived at times, but it's much smarter and fun than the average Hollywood legal thriller. There are really two types of films here, the first hour being a mystery while the second being a legal thriller. I was a bit taken aback when they spill the beans only an hour in, but found the courtroom drama just as engrossing as what came before it. The mystery element is effectively intriguing, while the courtroom stuff is well-played, with intensity and snappy dialogue.It's been a long time since McConaughey was in such fine form. This is a role with real bite and he reminds us that he's a movie star with genuine acting ability. Mick Haller is a suave, charismatic, arrogant, crafty, and manipulative character that McConaughey really sinks his teeth into. As an actor, he naturally exudes charisma and he takes to this character in the same natural way a Jazz musician takes to their instrument. Marissa Tomei as the L.A. prosecutor, and Mick's ex-wife, has a natural chemistry with McConaughey and a likeability and natural warmth that brightens up a film just by having her walk on-screen. Macy doesn't have much screen-time, but has the unique ability as an actor to bring a distinct quirkiness to his role and effectively steal all of his scenes. As the comic relief of sorts, he does just that here. The stunning supporting cast is not short on big names and big talent, consisting of Josh Lucas, Frances Fisher, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Bryan Cranston, and Trace Adkins (!?).The Lincoln Lawyer is consistently entertaining and suspenseful while it moves at a brisk, clever pace. It has structural similarities to recent films (one that comes immediately to mind is 2007's Fracture), but what it lacks in freshness it makes up for in execution. This is not a film that tries to reinvent the wheel, but merely keep its audience entertained while they watch the wheel spin. It's well-acted and addictive. It's nice to see a film that that aspires only to entertain, but doesn't disregard intelligence completely in doing so. It's not a great film, but it's great entertainment.GRADE: B",4,Consistently Entertaining,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,4218,"['Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'making', 'forgettable', 'romantic-comedies', 'stunt', 'ability', 'show', 'range', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'not', 'have', 'stepping', 'Oscar-worthy', 'territory', 'role', 'faith', 'ability', 'actor', 'Additionally', 'solid', 'film', 'tremendous', 'supporting', 'cast', 'confident', 'direction', 'relative', 'newcomer', 'Brad', 'Furman', 'IMDB', 'picture', 'Good', 'Charlotte', 'T-shirt', 'hat', 'would', 'not', 'lead', 'believe', 'was', 'capable', 'making', 'coherent', 'film', '.McConaughey', 'Mick', 'Haller', 'smooth-talking', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'backseat', 'Lincoln', 'Town', 'Car', 'defending', 'garden-variety', 'criminals', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'right', 'price', 'Mick', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'clearly', 'fond', 'luxuries', 'affords', 'When', 'driver', 'Earl', 'can', 'keep', 'job', 'Mick', 'license', 'back', 'Mick', 'got', 'license', 'back', 'three', 'months', 'ago', 'Earl', 'blue', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'named', 'Val', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Mick', 'offer', 'defend', 'high-profile', 'client', 'Louis', 'Roulet', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'son', 'wealthy', 'real', 'estate', 'mogul', 'been', 'accused', 'brutally', 'assaulting', 'prostitute', 'Louis', 'vehemently', 'innocence', 'suspicious', 'Mick', 'job', 'Frank', 'Levin', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'investigator', 'Mick', 'analyzing', 'evidence', 'build', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'only', 'make', 'suspicions', 'stronger', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'strong', 'script', 'doubt', 'adapted', 'strong', 'book', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'author', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'last', 'film', 'adapted', 'one', 'books', 'was', '2002', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'thriller', 'Blood', 'Work', 'was', 'well-received', 'Two', 'solid', 'films', 'two', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bad', 'think', 'safe', 'bet', 'got', 'talent', 'script', 'formula', 'including', 'twist', 'opportunity', 'twisty', 'plot', 'film', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'are', 'elements', 'require', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'bit', 'nothing', 'too', 'extraordinary', 'just', 'too', 'convenient', 'get', 'contrived', 'times', 'much', 'smarter', 'fun', 'average', 'Hollywood', 'legal', 'thriller', 'are', 'really', 'two', 'types', 'films', 'here', 'first', 'hour', 'being', 'mystery', 'second', 'being', 'legal', 'thriller', 'was', 'bit', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'spill', 'beans', 'only', 'hour', 'found', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'just', 'as', 'engrossing', 'what', 'came', 'mystery', 'element', 'effectively', 'intriguing', 'courtroom', 'stuff', 'well-played', 'intensity', 'snappy', 'dialogue.It', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'McConaughey', 'was', 'such', 'fine', 'form', 'role', 'real', 'bite', 'movie', 'star', 'genuine', 'acting', 'ability', 'Mick', 'Haller', 'suave', 'charismatic', 'arrogant', 'crafty', 'manipulative', 'character', 'McConaughey', 'really', 'teeth', 'actor', 'naturally', 'charisma', 'character', 'same', 'natural', 'way', 'Jazz', 'musician', 'instrument', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'L.A.', 'prosecutor', 'Mick', 'ex-wife', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'McConaughey', 'likeability', 'natural', 'warmth', 'up', 'film', 'just', 'having', 'walk', 'on-screen', 'Macy', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen-time', 'unique', 'ability', 'actor', 'bring', 'distinct', 'quirkiness', 'role', 'effectively', 'steal', 'scenes', 'comic', 'relief', 'sorts', 'just', 'here', 'stunning', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'short', 'big', 'names', 'big', 'talent', 'consisting', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Frances', 'Fisher', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Trace', 'Adkins', '.The', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'brisk', 'clever', 'pace', 'structural', 'similarities', 'recent', 'films', 'one', 'immediately', 'mind', '2007', 'Fracture', 'what', 'freshness', 'up', 'execution', 'not', 'film', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'merely', 'keep', 'audience', 'entertained', 'watch', 'wheel', 'spin', 'well-acted', 'addictive', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'entertain', ""n't"", 'disregard', 'intelligence', 'completely', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'entertainment.GRADE', 'B']",The Lincoln Lawyer

It got a lot of praise by the high brow crowd but I understand why they love this movie. It is making my favorite films of 2011. Directed by Brad Furman he directed The Lake.  Stars Matthew McConaughey as Mick Haller, Marisa Tomei as Maggie McPherson, William H Macy as Frank Levin, John Leguizamo as Val, Ryan Phillippe as Louis Roulet &  you have Country Singer Trace Adkins in there in for a small role as a leader of a biker gang. The story is you have a Defense Attorney Mick Haller he is defending this guy Louis Roulet. He & his friend Frank are going through the case on Roulet & he is talking to a previous client Jesus in prison. When he shows him a photo of Roulet he gets upset which Haller starts to believe that Jesus wasn't response for the murder of a woman. Haller has an ex wife Maggie who works as a Prosecutor she's never liked he has defended criminals. He also has a daughter. He only tells Frank what's really  going  down. Roulet breaks into Haller's house & threatens him & his family. The next morning he is told Frank has been killed. Later he finds his gun missing. He also got a voice message from Frank before he was killed. Haller goes through with The trial & go through with defending Roulet. Great back & forth between The Prosecution & The Defense. The Prosecution brings in a snitch from prison Haller makes them look like idots. Roulet gets off but is arrested for murder based on information that he got out of the prison snitch. Haller is given a gun by his driver when he gets home Maggie calls him & tells him that Roulet was set free Haller tells Maggie to get out of the house. He goes there waits for Roulet & I love this cene cause I don't really like Ryan Phillipe the biker gang lead by Trace Adkins beats Ryan Phillipe's a  s  s. Haller says ""Hospital not the mourge boys!"" When he gets home Roulet's mother broke into the house she confesses to murdering Frank Levin. She shoots him Haller takes his brand new gun shoots & kills her. Haller is released the next day from the hospital. The DA will seek the The Death Penalty against Roulet & Jesus was found innocent. Trace Adkins tells Haller 1 of our guys was found with drugs & they want a discount. He tells them he will do it for free. This was great movie good directing by Brad Furman.

1399035,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B004EPYZP8,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[11, 21]","This film is entertaining and well-acted, but in the end I give a mere 3 stars, because it is so unreal in certain important ways.The Story:Matthew McConaughey plays a street-wise, prison-wise lawyer (Mickey Haller) who works the system to make a living.  In some ways he's a sleazy guy, representing biker gangs, bribing clerks for info etc, but he's also got a kind heart for his daughter, his ex and his friend Frank (Bill Macy, a private investigator).  I think it's good role for McConaughey, and like a lot of other Hollywood ""pretty boys"" (e.g. Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio) his acting gets better as he ages and plays more serious parts.  If you'd ever gotten accused of a crime, his Mickey Haller character would be the guy you'd hire to battle the system!Haller comes upon a case of a snobby rich young man (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of a nasty assault on a prostitute, and takes over the case from the family's clueless ""blue-blood"" lawyer.  Then the story gets intriguing, as you wonder if the rich kid is ""playing"" Haller.  Then you realize that he is, big time, especially when Macy gets killed, and Haller seems like he's in a deep hole that's impossible to get out of.  It's when he's in this impossible-seeming situation that McConaughey's acting skills come out.  Is he a cool lawyer with the whole world at his feet, or a lonely, angry, divorced drunk who is barely clinging on without losing it?  It's this time of desparation & suffering that gives the movie a little more depth than your typical formulaic film noir.All Haller has to do is lose the case and the rich snob will be jailed for a long, long time.  But he's set on winning the case for his client and simultaneously getting his client booked for murder. How he does this is a little too slick for me to believe, but I admit it's good escapism.  Also, as many viewers say, the movie has well acted characters.So WHAT'S WRONG with this movie (SPOILER ALERT BELOW!)?  It took me a while of contemplation to figure this out.  What's wrong with its message? Why doesn't it resonate with me?  It's because it is a total warping of reality.  This movie, while it PURPORTS to be realistic, is total BS reality-wise.  A sleazy defense lawyer who is amoral and works the system for money, is the hero?  A white, handsome, upper-class, Ferrari-driving real-estate salesman and his well-dressed successful Mother are evil Bad Guys, like the Joker and the Riddler?  Biker gangs are other heros who are on the side of the hero?  Of course, we HAVE TO BE PC.  SO ... can't have Blacks or Hispanics, who are 95% of the gang population in LA, be the criminals!  No!  The gang-looking latino who was put in jail for murder, was framed!  He even says ""My Mom is going to die when she knows I'm going to jail!""  He says it so well, you think you're going to cry!  Forget about all those other gangbangers who aren't innocent (like the guys who beat the Giants fan into a coma), this movie tells you that you just can't generalize!So the movie (& I assume the book) depicts a flipped reality in which the population that is probably responsible for &lt;1% of the violent crime in the US (rich, white, USC-educated real-estate selling golfers, AND their mothers) are the evil-doers.  And everyone else in the non-upper-class world: prostitutes, ex-hippies, minorities, bikers, sleaze-bags, are just fine ... i.e. they're GOOD PEOPLE.  Who we should really hate are those rich golfing bastards, not only because we're jealous of their money, and they're not taxed enough of course, but they are evil serial killers to boot and guarded by their homicidal 65 year-old Armani-clothed mothers.In other words, what passes for a thriller on the surface is also very manipulative class warfare and PC propaganda.  But I guess it's worth a few bucks for some temporary escapism.",3,"Slick legal escapism, well-acted characters -- so WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

It's a throwback to the days of classic courtroom dramas and police procedurals, with enough interesting twists and turns to keep eyeballs glued to the screen. Matthew McConaughey is superbly cast as the smooth operator lawyer. The rest of the casting is also exceptional, down to some of the bit parts like the bail bondsman, the jailhouse snitch, the biker, and the busted hooker. (I especially appreciated William H. Macy as the private investigator; I do wish that Marisa Tomei had a meatier role that allowed her to shine as she did in ""My Cousin Vinny."") Michael Connelly is one of the best current authors in the hard-boiled police procedural genre, and the adaptation stays pretty true to his spirit. As someone who works in the criminal justice system, I appreciated the realism. Money, connections, backroom wheeling and dealing, and simple twists of fate often trump justice.

When the public thinks of them, they mostly think of good looking, alright watchable actors.  In this film I was pleasantly surprised to find that they actually do more than act as pretty boys on a screen, they get into their roles with high calibre intensity.  They don't just act, they disappear into these characters.  I was reminded that they are in fact talented when given the right material to work with and push themselves into.  It certainly doesn't hurt to throw them in the shot with some fantastic supporting players like Marisa Tomei who is always a brilliant performer and William Macy who does an amazing job as a washed up hard working private investigator.  The movie is a crime thriller and a good one with many angles.Matthew plays a lawyer who more or less works in the backseat of his Lincoln car.  He's got a driver now since he's got a DUI pinned to the vehicle.  Yeah his character has a bit of a drinking problem, but he still manages to get criminals off the legal way.  His world is turned upside down when he's hired by Ryan Phillippe's character to defend him from being accused of murder.

On the plus side, the story is interesting, a justice system whodunit with a fair number of unexpected twists. Matthew McConaughey plays a hustling defense attorney who at first seems to possess no scruples, but who soon emerges as much more complex. Ryan Phillipe is his rich playboy client, who initially proclaims his innocence, but of course doubt prevails. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife who is also a prosecutor, and William Macy as his investigator.The main problem with the movie for me was the writing, particularly the dialogues. Most of the conversations feel very artificial, and rushed - the story is at pains to fit in all the twists I think, and so each scene revolves around the information it is meant to convey, as opposed to being driven by character or realism. In that it felt a bit like an extended Law and Order episode, rather than a high- level feature film. The characters felt thin for the same reason, particularly the Marisa Tomei and William Macy characters - both fine actors who are completely under/mis- used here. Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillipe both felt a bit wooden to me, even when they were angry, also probably partly due to the writing.So story is OK, writing and acting so-so, just a 3-star film for me.",3,"Found This Just So-So -- Story Good, Writing and Performances Uneven",1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1306,"['found', 'overall', 'be', 'just', 'so-so', 'plus', 'side', 'story', 'interesting', 'justice', 'system', 'whodunit', 'fair', 'number', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'hustling', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'first', 'possess', 'scruples', 'who', 'soon', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'rich', 'playboy', 'client', 'who', 'initially', 'innocence', 'course', 'doubt', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'co-stars', 'McConaughey', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'also', 'prosecutor', 'William', 'Macy', 'investigator.The', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'writing', 'particularly', 'dialogues', 'Most', 'conversations', 'feel', 'very', 'artificial', 'rushed', 'story', 'pains', 'fit', 'twists', 'think', 'so', 'scene', 'information', 'meant', 'convey', 'opposed', 'being', 'driven', 'character', 'realism', 'felt', 'bit', 'extended', 'Law', 'Order', 'episode', 'rather', 'high-', 'level', 'feature', 'film', 'characters', 'felt', 'thin', 'same', 'reason', 'particularly', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'William', 'Macy', 'characters', 'fine', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'under/mis-', 'used', 'here', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'felt', 'bit', 'wooden', 'even', 'when', 'were', 'angry', 'also', 'probably', 'partly', 'due', 'writing.So', 'story', 'OK', 'writing', 'acting', 'so-so', 'just', '3-star', 'film']",The Lincoln Lawyer

However, I don't think it really warrants 4 stars.  As a fledgling attorney, I wasn't all that happy with the way the justice system is portrayed here (particularly the star attorney).  I know he is meant to be a ""hero"" as he is lashing out at the bad guy and helping to free the innocent man, but I had a hard time liking him because of his methods.  NOTE: I know this is probably a minority viewpoint, so if you don't think this will bother you, I would recommend it as a good watch.As as I said to my husband after the first 45 minutes or so ""oh so many ethical violations""; whether he thinks he is doing the right thing or not, the main character commits numerous ethical violations at the beginning, and again at the end after he realizes what is really going on - I am tempted to play a game and see how many I can spot the next time I watch it. While this is not a bar to enjoying the movie (as I said I did enjoy the plot), I found it hard to like the main character because of it, and as an attorney I didn't appreciate the portrayal, particularly - and I find myself hoping there are very few attorneys like him.Furthermore, the story would have (in my opinion) been even more interesting if it had delved into how the legal system ACTUALLY handles such situations; it has happened in real life, and there are cases out there that the author could have utilized.  ""Truth is stranger than fiction"", and has the benefit of being truth.  While I don't think inaccuracy or ""fluffing"" of a character necessarily detracts from a movie or book, I think it did so here, at least for me.

It's difficult to translate books to the silver screen, and this is no exception. Based upon the novel by John Connelly, the movie lacks the heart that enlivened the written version. It does do justice, however, to the character of Mickey Haller, a smart, fast-talking defense attorney who knows all the tricks and doesn't hesitate to play them. Kind of a conman with a conscience, if you can picture that. I wondered about the choice of Mcconaughey to play Mick, but I'm happy to report that he captured the Haller essence. His client, a rich boy accused of assaulting a working girl, will pay very well indeed if exonerated, but Mick senses there's more to these accusations than meets the eye. A mature Marisa Tomei portrays Mickey's ex, and while she handles well the material she's given, the nature of their relationship (still loving each other) does not come through. William H. Macy shines as Haller's investigator, as does Laurence Mason, the chauffeur with a keen mind. Michael Pena, a now-incarcerated former client (you can't win 'em all) makes the most of the few key scenes in which he appears, forwarding the momentum of the plot.  But this is McConaughey's show, and if his performance here is anything to go by, his career should be taking off from here on out.

It also helps that the entire cast is top notch - Francis Fisher plays the ruthlessly determined mum (of the accused), Bob Gunton (of The Shawshank Redemption) plays the defendant's family lawyer and employee of mum - a man who is all too willing to bend a few rules for his rich clients. Marisa Tomei plays Matt's long-suffering ex-wife and a prosecution lawyer in her own rite, William H. Macy plays Frank - Matt's equally long-suffering private detective partner and best friend. Josh Lucas plays the earnest but nave prosecuting lawyer, Laurence Mason plays Earl - Matt's savvy chauffeur (he drives The Lincoln) while both John Leguizamo and Michael Pena are exceptional as Latino hustlers and hoods.But the film belongs to the two principal leads - Ryan Phillippe brilliantly portraying the accused - a convincing weeper on the stand who may indeed be innocent - or may be a an artic-cold slasher monster who needs to be put down like a rabid dog and not just put away. Add to this a central performance from the all-too-often underrated Matthew McConaughey shining like a diamond throughout (a sleazy lawyer forced to face up to his questionable legal tactics and outcomes) - and the whole thing feels like a really well-made movie - because that's exactly what it is (dialogue above).The BLU RAY print is immaculate throughout and accentuates the gritty sweatiness of so many scenes.It's not all genius of course, but ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a hugely enjoyable watch - when such things seem to be in short supply these days.Put it high on your 'must watch' rental list...",4,"""...What If I Can't Recognize Innocence Anymore...""",1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1990,"[""'ve"", 'doubt', 'worked', 'out', 'slew', '4', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'Brad', 'Furman', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'superlative', 'legal', 'thriller', 'very', 'much', 'vein', 'twisting', 'John', 'Grisham', 'screen', 'adaptations', 'Client', 'Time', 'Kill', '.Adapted', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'book', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'written', 'John', 'Romano', 'hooks', 'early', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'also', 'entire', 'cast', 'top', 'notch', 'Francis', 'Fisher', 'ruthlessly', 'determined', 'mum', 'accused', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'defendant', 'family', 'lawyer', 'employee', 'mum', 'man', 'who', 'too', 'willing', 'bend', 'few', 'rules', 'rich', 'clients', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Matt', 'long-suffering', 'ex-wife', 'prosecution', 'lawyer', 'own', 'rite', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Frank', 'Matt', 'equally', 'long-suffering', 'private', 'detective', 'partner', 'best', 'friend', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'earnest', 'nave', 'prosecuting', 'lawyer', 'Laurence', 'Mason', 'Earl', 'Matt', 'savvy', 'chauffeur', 'Lincoln', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'are', 'exceptional', 'Latino', 'hustlers', 'hoods.But', 'film', 'belongs', 'two', 'principal', 'leads', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'brilliantly', 'portraying', 'accused', 'convincing', 'weeper', 'stand', 'who', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'innocent', 'may', 'be', 'artic-cold', 'slasher', 'monster', 'who', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'rabid', 'dog', 'not', 'just', 'put', 'away', 'Add', 'central', 'performance', 'all-too-often', 'underrated', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'shining', 'diamond', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'forced', 'face', 'up', 'questionable', 'legal', 'tactics', 'outcomes', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'really', 'well-made', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'dialogue', '.The', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'print', 'immaculate', 'gritty', 'sweatiness', 'so', 'many', 'scenes.It', 'not', 'genius', 'course', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'hugely', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'when', 'such', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'short', 'supply', 'days.Put', 'high', ""'must"", 'watch', 'rental', 'list']",The Lincoln Lawyer
1399105,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EPYZP8,Mark Turner,"[11, 14]","Have you ever watched a movie thinking before hand it would be a good movie only to discover that it was just so so once it finished? A movie that just leaves you feeling a bit bland, as if had you not watched it you wouldn't notice it but that you thought was entertaining enough anyway? Such is the case with THE LINCOLN LAWYER.Based on the best seller by Michael Connelly it tells the tale of slick lawyer Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a stereotypical lawyer who will do most anything to get his client off be he guilty or not. Mick is also likely to take his client for as much as he can get while the getting is good. Not the most loveable character you'll find in a movie.Things get odd when Mick takes on a case for bail bondsmen/friend named Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo). He has a client in need of an attorney, a young and wealthy guy named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillipe) accused of attempting to rape and beat a young woman. Roulet claims innocence from the start and Mick is willing to take him at his word. Refusing money from his mother to differentiate the client from the witness base, Mick sets out to discover all he can about the case and all involved.Using his best friend and investigator Frank Levin (William H. Macy), he sets out building an alibi for his client. But when he has Frank look into something different, Frank ends up dead and the most likely suspect in Mick's eye is Roulet. The problem is being his attorney Roulet is protected by the lawyer/client privilege. And when ties to a case that didn't set well with Mick years ago start to form, he begins to wonder just who this young man really is.Along the way we meet an assortment of characters to round out the film. Marisa Tomei stars as Maggie McPherson, Mick's ex-wife who works in the D.A.'s office. There are several policemen who don't care for Mick's way of doing things, especially helping criminals evade justice headed by Bryan Cranston. And then there's Earl (Laurence Mason), Mick's chauffer, the man who drives the Lincoln town car that connects to the movie's title. Mick doesn't use an office you see, he spends most of his time in his car.The mystery involved doesn't offer an incredibly difficult plot to follow nor puzzle to solve. Who did what to whom becomes pretty evident early on. The best part of the film deals with Mick's trying to find a way to not break the law by turning in his client and at the same time finding a way to get him convicted of the crime.The performances here are for the most part pretty standard. There is no break out performance to be seen but everyone does a fine job. The cinematography is well done with a few hand held shots that aren't so obnoxious as to get in the way. The direction feels more by the book than anything. As I said, this movie offers a decent mystery but for the most part feels sort of bland. Still, when it comes to a rental its better than a number of movies out there and you just might enjoy it.",3,STEREOTYPICAL LAWYER,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,2966,"['Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'thinking', 'hand', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'only', 'discover', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'so', 'finished', 'movie', 'just', 'feeling', 'bit', 'bland', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'would', ""n't"", 'notice', 'thought', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'anyway', 'Such', 'case', 'THE', 'LINCOLN', 'LAWYER.Based', 'best', 'seller', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'tale', 'slick', 'lawyer', 'Mick', 'Haller', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'stereotypical', 'lawyer', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'most', 'anything', 'get', 'client', 'off', 'be', 'guilty', 'not', 'Mick', 'also', 'likely', 'take', 'client', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'getting', 'good', 'Not', 'most', 'loveable', 'character', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie.Things', 'get', 'odd', 'when', 'Mick', 'case', 'bail', 'bondsmen/friend', 'named', 'Val', 'Valenzuela', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'client', 'need', 'attorney', 'young', 'wealthy', 'guy', 'named', 'Louis', 'Roulet', 'Ryan', 'Phillipe', 'accused', 'attempting', 'rape', 'beat', 'young', 'woman', 'Roulet', 'innocence', 'start', 'Mick', 'willing', 'take', 'word', 'Refusing', 'money', 'mother', 'differentiate', 'client', 'witness', 'base', 'Mick', 'out', 'discover', 'can', 'case', 'involved.Using', 'best', 'friend', 'investigator', 'Frank', 'Levin', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'out', 'building', 'alibi', 'client', 'when', 'Frank', 'look', 'something', 'different', 'Frank', 'up', 'dead', 'most', 'likely', 'suspect', 'Mick', 'eye', 'Roulet', 'problem', 'being', 'attorney', 'Roulet', 'protected', 'lawyer/client', 'privilege', 'when', 'ties', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'set', 'well', 'Mick', 'years', 'ago', 'start', 'form', 'wonder', 'just', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'really', 'is.Along', 'way', 'meet', 'assortment', 'characters', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Maggie', 'McPherson', 'Mick', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'D.A', 'office', 'are', 'several', 'policemen', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Mick', 'way', 'doing', 'things', 'especially', 'helping', 'criminals', 'evade', 'justice', 'headed', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'then', 'Earl', 'Laurence', 'Mason', 'Mick', 'chauffer', 'man', 'who', 'Lincoln', 'town', 'car', 'movie', 'title', 'Mick', ""n't"", 'use', 'office', 'see', 'most', 'time', 'car.The', 'mystery', 'involved', ""n't"", 'offer', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'plot', 'follow', 'puzzle', 'solve', 'Who', 'did', 'what', 'whom', 'becomes', 'pretty', 'evident', 'early', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'deals', 'Mick', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'not', 'break', 'law', 'turning', 'client', 'same', 'time', 'finding', 'way', 'get', 'convicted', 'crime.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'pretty', 'standard', 'break', 'out', 'performance', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'fine', 'job', 'cinematography', 'well', 'done', 'few', 'hand', 'held', 'shots', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'obnoxious', 'get', 'way', 'direction', 'feels', 'more', 'book', 'anything', 'said', 'movie', 'decent', 'mystery', 'most', 'part', 'feels', 'sort', 'bland', 'Still', 'when', 'rental', 'better', 'number', 'movies', 'there', 'just', 'might', 'enjoy']",The Lincoln Lawyer

Moore,"[3, 5]","Brad Furman's ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a slick, fast-moving, outstandingly entertaining legal thriller about a defense attorney burdened with the client from Hell. Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey)--known as ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" because his office is the back seat of his chauffeured Lincoln Town Car--is an arrogant hotshot who prides himself on being able to play the legal system like Jimi Hendrix played his guitar. After several plot twists and turns, however, Mickey suddenly finds the system playing him. He's even being framed to look like the perpetrator of capital crimes, and because of attorney-client privilege he faces disbarment--or worse--if he tells what he knows.To say anything more about the plot of ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" would be a capital crime in itself. Let's just say that the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat literally to the last minute, and that even the savviest thriller fan won't guess all the surprises Furman has in store. Matthew McConaughey hasn't been this good since he played another, very different lawyer in ""A Time to Kill,"" and he is matched by an impeccable supporting cast including Marisa Tomei as his prosecutor ex-wife, Ryan Philippe as a rich kid accused of rape, Frances Fisher as Philippe's imperious mother, William H. Macy as a scruffy P.I. and John Leguizamo as a sleazy bail bondsman.

Matthew MaConaughy is the titular purveyor of legal expertise, which he does not from an office of leather topped desks and imposing shelves full of legal tomes, but rather from the back seat of his Lincoln.  It soon becomes clear that he is quite happy to represent anyone at all, indeed that this may even come from his conscience - his greatest fear being that he might have the responsibility of defending someone who is actually innocent.  It's an interesting and satisfyingly explored twist on the usual moral-high-ground style lawyers we usually see in these movies.  However his next case defending the rich Ryan Phillippe character, turns out to be challenging both to his sense of what he knows is right, and a challenge to his skills in out-manipulating.All this leads to some satisfying courtroom scenes, and perhaps does not hold too many genuine surprises.  Except perhaps for the biggest surprise of the movie - a remarkable return to form for Maconaughy, after years in sub-par rom-coms, his first return to the courtroom sinceA Time to Kill [Blu-ray] makes you wish he'd never left. He certainly holds the movie together, far outshining the lesser role given to Ryan Phillips.  Which is not to say his is the only good performance, surrounded by an assortment of top notch character actors (Marisa Tomei, John Leguizamo, William Macy and others) adding a real sense of reality and grittiness to the movie.I liked it, and I recommend it.

It's the most efficient, solidly crafted courtroom thriller since PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. It has so many twists and turns that it's likely that the popular mystery writer would be giving it her approval.It also reignites the career of Matthew McConaughey as an actor, not just a charismatic star. He manages to be smoothly appealing despite playing a corrupt lawyer who has no scruples in defending guilty clients as long as they provide the cash flow he demands. It's only after defending RYAN PHILLIPPE from a charge of murder and rape that he realizes he does have a few scruples left. And the plot twists provided by the screenwriter John Romano from the novel by Michael Connelly, are deftly handled for maximum shock effect. Brad Furman keeps the direction tight and forceful.The cast surrounding McConaughey has been selected with care and all of them offer realistic performances. Marisa Tomei is appealing as his ex-wife who knows his shortcomings but is still attracted to him, and William H. Macy delivers a solid performance as his investigator friend. Ryan Phillippe is excellent as the client whose surface appearance belies the fact that he's as street smart as his sleazy lawyer, and FRANCES FISHER is outstanding in a small but pivotal role as the young man's protective mother.Not since the days of PRIMAL FEAR and WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION has there been a more intelligent script than this one, designed to baffle and blindside the viewer in the course of unraveling some startling surprises.By all means, highly recommended for fans of this genre.",5,Solid courtroom thriller with excellent work from Matthew McConaughey...,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,1718,"['Agatha', 'Christie', 'would', 'be', 'proud', 'five-twist', 'ending', 'THE', 'LINCOLN', 'LAWYER', 'film', 'clearly', 'top-notch', 'street', 'smart', 'most', 'efficient', 'solidly', 'crafted', 'courtroom', 'thriller', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'WITNESS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'likely', 'popular', 'mystery', 'writer', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'approval.It', 'also', 'career', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'actor', 'not', 'just', 'charismatic', 'star', 'be', 'smoothly', 'appealing', 'playing', 'corrupt', 'lawyer', 'who', 'scruples', 'defending', 'guilty', 'clients', 'as', 'long', 'provide', 'cash', 'flow', 'only', 'defending', 'RYAN', 'PHILLIPPE', 'charge', 'murder', 'rape', 'have', 'few', 'scruples', 'left', 'plot', 'twists', 'provided', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Romano', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'are', 'deftly', 'handled', 'maximum', 'shock', 'effect', 'Brad', 'Furman', 'direction', 'tight', 'forceful.The', 'cast', 'surrounding', 'McConaughey', 'been', 'selected', 'care', 'offer', 'realistic', 'performances', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'appealing', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'shortcomings', 'still', 'attracted', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'solid', 'performance', 'investigator', 'friend', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'excellent', 'client', 'surface', 'appearance', 'fact', 'street', 'smart', 'sleazy', 'lawyer', 'FRANCES', 'FISHER', 'outstanding', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'young', 'man', 'protective', 'mother.Not', 'days', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'WITNESS', 'FOR', 'THE', 'PROSECUTION', 'there', 'been', 'more', 'intelligent', 'script', 'one', 'designed', 'baffle', 'blindside', 'viewer', 'course', 'unraveling', 'startling', 'surprises.By', 'means', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre']",The Lincoln Lawyer

Connelly should be very pleased and ready to sign on for a series of Mickey Haller films.  This is smooth, effective filmmaking: a strong plot, exceptional actors, top production values and just enough sex and violence to earn the R without distracting us unnecessarily.Matthew McConaughey plays Mickey Haller to a fare-thee-well.  He is defending a decadent sleazeball and, in return, pocketing a tidy fee.  At the same time his heart is breaking over the fact that he struck a plea deal for a former client who, he now knows, was innocent.  The man is rotting in San Quentin and will likely spend 15 years of his life there.  Suddenly it hits him: the sleazeball he is currently defending may well have perpetrated the murder for which his other, falsely-accused client, took the fall.  This guy likes to kill women and then watch others serve time for it.  He also likes to entrap his lawyer, who is bound by attorney-client privilege rules.  Mick has to get the sleazeball off but, simultaneously, he has to also see him convicted and his prior client freed.How will he do that?  That&#8217;s the nub of the mystery.  In the process he will be supported by his ex-wife Maggie (Marisa Tomei), his investigator (William H. Macey) and the head of a biker gang (Trace Adkins).  This is delicious L.A. crime narrative.

1399230,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B004EPYZP8,S. Schell,"[3, 5]","*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review ""not helpful"", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*A crime thriller adapted from Michael Connelly's best selling novel of the same name, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is a solid and entertaining film that is easy to follow.  It is rife with noteworthy performances and events that offer its main character a new outlook on himself and the law.Mick Haller (McConnaughey) is a high-profile defense attorney in LA who is known for his good looks, devil-may-care persona and fetish for Lincoln towncars.  His ex-wife and fellow attorney Maggie (Tomei) is immune to the facade, decrying his sensibilities as a lawyer (""I'm trying like hell to keep scumbags off the street while you're busy putting them right back on it"") right along with local law enforcement (""Where does someone like you sleep at night?  With all the scum you represent?"").  Haller laughs it off but his good humor is stifled when he offers to defend Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) against a rape charge. When his client's self-proclaimed innocence doesn't mesh with the facts and things get sinister and dangerous, Haller ends up fighting for his life to render a verdict he doesn't believe in.Though this movie was enjoyable, it takes one too many liberties for my liking.  First, when Roulet is on the stand, he directly addresses the jury to once again proclaim his innocence while giving them a sob story (this would never fly in a real courtroom).  Then, towards the film's end, Mick calls in a ""favor"" and exacts some justice of his own.  I just can't see him getting away with this one considering the circumstances: he represents the people who perform said ""favor"", his victim is able to place him at a specific location at a specific time, and there is property damage and assault involved.  Far-fetched, in my opinion, but I guess at this point the audience is only supposed to care about seeing a scumbag get what he deserves.  And let's not even mention the unlicensed firearm he uses to defend himself during a skirmish.What viewers can fathom is Mick's dilemma in defending a man whose innocence is either questionable or false, and McConnaughey renders his character's tribulation splendidly.  Though I don't think it equals his performance in ""A Time To Kill"", it comes fairly close.  Phillippe is passable as the arrogant Roulet.  He doesn't come off as menacing as the character could be - all I saw was a Machiavellian pipsqueak but perhaps this is the interpretation the director wanted.

I enjoyed the novel on which this movie was based, and now, about 4 years later, I've gotten round to the movie.  It does justice to the tone, spirit and much of the detail of the movie.  The cast is absolutely up to the job -- McConaughy, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Ryan Philippe, and, in a small role, Bryan Cranston -- all are fine, as are the less well-known supporters.  If I had to pick one out, I would say that Macy brings something -- maybe just his look -- that you remember in a quite small role that is nonetheless important to the plot.

Roulet(Philippe) broke into his house, threatened his family, stole his gun (of course, that isn't proven, but circumstantial is strong), and his friend/investigator is murdered and he is being framed for it... and still, Mick has no options other than to keep quiet? The whole point of the film is the way Haller dealt with the problem. He outplayed Roulet. It wasn't very realistic but it was entertaining! You also have the fact that his current case was connected to another one of his client's cases.Not sure how that would complicate things but he also has a responsibility to that client.His current client actually confessed to a murder involving that client:the sight of Michael Pe&ntilde;a, as one of Mick's old clients,going from freaked-out innocent to stone-cold lifer in a few short scenes.Ms. Tomei plays a character and not just the love interest. She isn't the star, of course, but without her and the other exceptionally well-cast supporting players, Mr. McConaughey would have a tougher time making you believe that he was to the sleaze born. After his breakthrough in A Time To Kill, either he or his management team fell into the familiar Hollywood trap of following the money rather than following the talent. Here, he infuses life into a wonderfully seedy character, a lived in quality. Mick's confidence about his place in the social food chain is upended by a building sense of doubt and guilt, culminating in telling moment when he says, ""There's no client as scary as an innocent man."". Mick's descent into self-questioning limbo ends up tainting the lives of his straggly haired investigator (William H. Macy) and his district attorney ex-wife (Marisa Tomei), the few fledgling branches making up his hollow family tree. and Furman can't help but drench the film in unnecessary lens flares, split screens, and jump cuts.

Matthew McConaughey is great as Mick Haller. This guy is unbelievably smart, charming, and refreshing. McConaughey takes the brains from a Time To Kill, throws in the swagger of Sahara, and adds in the stellar writing of Connelly, (who mixes old school wit and modern ideals), to create a character that is easily the best of his career. It honestly seems to me like the role was written for McConaughey, it is that good of a match. Ryan Phillippe plays Haller's client in the film and continues to blossom from the shy southern boy in White Squall to a guy who will one day be a major player in Hollywood. It's hard to review a film like this without spoilers, all I can tell you is this. The Lincoln Lawyer is one of the smartest movies I've seen in a long time.

1399256,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004EPYZP8,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Based on a Michael Connelly bestselling novel, ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" follows the story of Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey), the ""Lincoln Lawyer"" of the title, who defends a wealthy family's son Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), accused of beating up a prostitute Reggie Campo (Margarita Levieva). As the story unfolds, however, Mickey realizes - maybe too late - that the case is not what it at first appears to be.Admittedly, the central mystery of the legal thriller is not as engaging as the character McConaughey plays, a criminal defense lawyer whose ""office"" is the backseat of a Lincoln continental. Clever and witty, Mickey is a capable lawyer, always knows what he is doing, and though he is not infallible (just like any of us), he knows what he should do, having his own code of ethics.The script is overlong (sometimes it feels like watching a pilot episode for a TV series), but is populated with interesting characters played by the talented cast including Frances Fisher, Bob Gunton, John Leguizamo, William H. Macy, Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Marisa Tomei. Josh Lucas also appears as a state prosecutor, who gives a nice contrast to McConaughey's character.The courtroom drama in the film's second half will keep you interested with some surprises, though you know that this hardly happens in real life.

1399257,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B004EPYZP8,Turfseer,"[5, 8]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***RATING: 3.5 out of 5.0Based on the Michael Connelly novel, 'The Lincoln Lawyer' pulls you in right away with its intriguing title. Will it be about an attorney who's known for his honesty just like our legendary 16th President? Not quite. The Lincoln Lawyer is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conducts most of his business inside his aging Lincoln Continental town car. But in a sense, the parallels between Haller and 'Honest Abe' are not completely off base. Like President Lincoln, Haller has an incredible command of the law. And more importantly, he's cultivated the right connections which enables him to call in favors at crucial moments, guaranteeing his success.Haller is one of those characters that may be a little too cool to be believable. Nonetheless, film audiences will identify with Haller as a man who is never intimidated. Consider how he's not afraid to demand more money from his client, a member of a motorcycle gang who's now in trouble with the law. And when he meets up with the head of the gang to demand payment, he has no trouble asking for an additional $10,000. There's also humor to be found here, when Haller is granted a continuance from the Judge for his biker client, after advising the Court that he needs more time to question a new witness: a ""Mr. Green"" (Green of course being the additional funds owed to him by the biker gang).The film's neo-noir narrative, conveys a heady verisimilitude of the California criminal justice system. For example, when Haller meets with a former drug addict client who's now been re-arrested (again for drugs), he advises her that she's going to have to do some jail time (as she's already been through pre-trial rehab). When the addict agrees to give up a confederate, Haller gets her back in pre-trial rehab (an event which later figures prominently in the plot).We break into the second act when Haller is introduced by a bail bondsman to a new client, Louis Roulet, a young Blueblood from a rich, Beverly Hills family who turns out to be a psychopath and possible serial killer. Roulet (played menacingly well by Ryan Phillippe) has been charged with beating up a prostitute but claims he's been set up by her along with a sleazy associate. Haller soon establishes a link between a former client, Martinez, who was accused of murdering a prostitute, Donna Renteria, in the same way the current victim was assaulted (both had wounds on only one side of their face). When he visits Martinez at San Quentin and shows him a photograph of Roulet, Martinez won't even look at it, as he's bitter at Haller for not believing in his innocence at the time of trial and forcing him to accept a plea bargain which sent him up the river for at least fifteen years (I was not entirely convinced that Martinez wouldn't have entertained Haller's offer to at least listen to what he had to say, in an attempt to ""make things right"").Haller conscripts an investigator who he works with, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), a former police officer who looks like an aging hippie, to see if there's a connection between Roulet and the earlier victim. Haller is murdered after leaving a cryptic message on Haller's voice mail, indicating he was on to something. Roulet breaks into Haller's home and admits that he's guilty of murdering Renteria but invokes attorney-client privilege to keep Haller quiet.Roulet goes beyond the usual serial killer routine (murdering prostitutes), when he threatens to harm Haller's wife Maggie (played by an underutilized Marisa Tomei) and their daughter. While it may have been a stretch to believe that most serial killers such as Roulet would include his own attorney as one of his targets, the way in which Haller figures out how to undermine Roulet without losing the case, is quite ingenious.Haller calls in Favor #1 from his drug addict client who he got into pre-trial rehab. She fills jail house snitch Corliss in on the fact that Renteria had a sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have known. The assistant DA puts Corliss on the stand, but Haller discredits him by citing a case in which Corliss's testimony resulted in an innocent man being convicted. Roulet's case is dismissed but he's detained for questioning due to Corliss's testimony about Renteria's special tattoo.Haller enrages Roulet by implying that he was responsible for setting up Corliss's testimony. Once Roulet is temporarily detained, Haller figures that's enough time to get to Maggie's sister's house (where Maggie and the daughter are hiding) so he can intercept the now out of control Roulet and call in favor #2 from the biker gang honcho. The once calculating but now impulsive Roulet shows up at Maggie's right on schedule and the gang members end up beating him up in broad daylight. Not likely, but again entertaining.When Haller figures out that Levin had discovered Roulet's parking ticket put him near the scene of Renteria's murder, along with Martinez's possible ID and Corliss's testimony about the spider tattoo, that may be enough to put Roulet away for good.I wasn't very surprised by Roulet's mother admitting to killing Levin and also shooting Haller, as it was pretty obvious from the get go that the mother-son relationship wasn't very kosher.'The Lincoln Lawyer' may be nothing more than an extended Law & Order episode, but it's still highly entertaining. I didn't buy all of it, especially the rather easy way in which Haller prevents the killer from doing harm to his family. I also wasn't entirely convinced that the DA really had enough evidence to convict Roulet at a second trial. Nonetheless, 'The Lincoln Lawyer', with its realistic atmosphere and excellent performances, proves to be a notch above many of films in wide release today.",3,"Not always believable but highly

There is no way he could represent client A, ethically, and should have withdrawn from the case. Plus, you cannot represent a client in a way that ultimately causes that client detriment.  And he breached the duty of confidentiality to do it by getting the information to the jailhouse snitch (and ruining the career of the prosecutor in the process).  Not to mention that he committed a crime himself by getting the fake snitch to commit perjury.Aside from the ethics, the plot, though twisted, was contrived.  Why would Louis Roulet hire him?  Plus, what exactly was the set up?  A parking ticket near where the girl was murdered?  And what else?  Oh, yeah, there was the kind of surprise trick ending that the mother killed the Investigator, Levine, I guess to protect her spoiled rich son, although that relationship never got even a slight probing, probably because we had to probe the oddly untroubled former marriage of Haller and Margaret.

1399265,A2BDQQ39DJ826Y,B004EPYZP8,viewer,"[9, 11]","The film critics I've read have done an unusually good job discussing The Lincoln Lawyer, as I saw it.  I will just hit the main points about the movie, pro and con, that made an impression on me.  Overall, I thought the movie was well-acted, well-produced, and entertaining, even if limited by what might be called a good TV-caliber screenplay.The movie drew me in at the very start when the Lincoln town car of the title and its driver turned out not to be the phony Hollywood glitz I had expected but a seedy image that fit the movie perfectly.  (One amateur review's complaint that the car somehow failed to serve its purpose simply because the title character drove around in other vehicles at various points is silly.)  The well-acted characters and unusually dingy L.A. settings generally felt authentic, as far as they went.  Matthew McConaughey fit naturally, smoothly, and effectively into the lead character of Mick Haller.  Haller is a slick, shady L.A. criminal defense lawyer who gets results for his low-life clients, even if things do not always turn out for the best.  Haller runs into serious problems, suffers blows from them, does not act always and mindlessly cocky (unlike the annoying, one-note young prosecutor-on-the-make in the movie Fracture), yet draws on enough strength, ingenuity, and resourcefulness that his confidence rarely fails him.  This made him fun to watch.  Sometimes, he stepped over the line, but not so far as to throw believability to the winds.  The story was basically interesting and tied up fairly neatly.  In fact, it is quite an accomplishment to make a mystery thriller that was generally this entertaining and satisfying without going completely over the top, the way so many of these kind of movies do (such as The Firm, Final Analysis, Just Cause, Guilty as Sin, General's Daughter, and the Ashley Judd films Double Jeopardy and High Crimes).  Lincoln Lawyer was refreshingly free of exploitative, sensational scenes used to gin up cheap shock value, horror, suspense, or titillation.At the same time, I have to agree with the critics that the movie's story and characters do seem familiar.  Although workmanlike, including the courtroom scenes, well-handled by McConaughey, the movie lacked the sparks of imagination, originality, intricacy, and electricity that can sometimes come from films like this.  It did not really hit the high notes that make watching not just enjoyable but exciting.  The writing, while good, seemed more like a script for a high-quality TV show than theatrical film.  And some of the supporting characters, especially Haller's ex-wife and the bail bondsman, were badly under-developed and pasted on, wasting talented actors in nothing or contrived roles.  Haller's interactions with his ex-wife were not convincing.  Similarly unconvincing was the degree to which he felt a crisis of conscience about the way he represented a past client in light of newly discovered information from representing his current, rich-boy client, accused of trying to beat to death a woman he met at a bar.  Haller had more practical and selfish reasons for resolving the current case the way he did, without delving so deeply into soul-searching and noble motives, which seemed ill-suited to the rest of the movie.",4,"Good TV-caliber plot in a well-acted, well-produced feature film",1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,3280,"['film', 'critics', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'done', 'unusually', 'good', 'job', 'discussing', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'saw', 'will', 'just', 'hit', 'main', 'points', 'movie', 'pro', 'con', 'made', 'impression', 'Overall', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'well-acted', 'well-produced', 'entertaining', 'even', 'limited', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'good', 'TV-caliber', 'screenplay.The', 'movie', 'drew', 'very', 'start', 'when', 'Lincoln', 'town', 'car', 'title', 'driver', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'phony', 'Hollywood', 'glitz', 'had', 'expected', 'seedy', 'image', 'fit', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'One', 'amateur', 'review', 'complaint', 'car', 'somehow', 'failed', 'serve', 'purpose', 'simply', 'title', 'character', 'drove', 'around', 'other', 'vehicles', 'various', 'points', 'silly', 'well-acted', 'characters', 'unusually', 'dingy', 'L.A.', 'settings', 'generally', 'felt', 'authentic', 'as', 'far', 'went', 'Matthew', 'McConaughey', 'fit', 'naturally', 'smoothly', 'effectively', 'lead', 'character', 'Mick', 'Haller', 'Haller', 'slick', 'shady', 'L.A.', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'who', 'results', 'low-life', 'clients', 'even', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'best', 'Haller', 'serious', 'problems', 'suffers', 'blows', 'not', 'act', 'always', 'mindlessly', 'cocky', 'annoying', 'one-note', 'young', 'prosecutor-on-the-make', 'movie', 'Fracture', 'yet', 'draws', 'enough', 'strength', 'ingenuity', 'resourcefulness', 'confidence', 'rarely', 'made', 'fun', 'watch', 'Sometimes', 'stepped', 'line', 'not', 'so', 'far', 'throw', 'believability', 'winds', 'story', 'was', 'basically', 'interesting', 'tied', 'up', 'fairly', 'neatly', 'fact', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'make', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'was', 'generally', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'going', 'completely', 'top', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'kind', 'movies', 'do', 'such', 'Firm', 'Final', 'Analysis', 'Just', 'Cause', 'Guilty', 'Sin', 'General', 'Daughter', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'films', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'High', 'Crimes', 'Lincoln', 'Lawyer', 'was', 'refreshingly', 'free', 'exploitative', 'sensational', 'scenes', 'used', 'gin', 'up', 'cheap', 'shock', 'value', 'horror', 'suspense', 'titillation.At', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'agree', 'critics', 'movie', 'story', 'characters', 'do', 'seem', 'familiar', 'workmanlike', 'including', 'courtroom', 'scenes', 'well-handled', 'McConaughey', 'movie', 'lacked', 'sparks', 'imagination', 'originality', 'intricacy', 'electricity', 'can', 'sometimes', 'come', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'make', 'watching', 'not', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'exciting', 'writing', 'good', 'seemed', 'more', 'script', 'high-quality', 'TV', 'show', 'theatrical', 'film', 'supporting', 'characters', 'especially', 'Haller', 'ex-wife', 'bail', 'bondsman', 'were', 'badly', 'under-developed', 'pasted', 'wasting', 'talented', 'actors', 'nothing', 'contrived', 'roles', 'Haller', 'interactions', 'ex-wife', 'were', 'not', 'convincing', 'Similarly', 'unconvincing', 'was', 'degree', 'felt', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'way', 'represented', 'past', 'client', 'light', 'newly', 'discovered', 'information', 'representing', 'current', 'rich-boy', 'client', 'accused', 'trying', 'beat', 'death', 'woman', 'met', 'bar', 'Haller', 'had', 'more', 'practical', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'resolving', 'current', 'case', 'way', 'did', 'delving', 'so', 'deeply', 'soul-searching', 'noble', 'motives', 'seemed', 'ill-suited', 'rest', 'movie']",The Lincoln Lawyer
