Daniel Webster (Aidan Quinn) His name clearly evokes the American classic ""The Devil and Daniel Webster."" In this case,Daniel's personal demons are his pill-popping,his alcoholic wife, his gay son, his pot-addicted daughter, and the fact that his father is cheating on his Alzheimer's-stricken mother with a female bishop (Ellen Burstyn,a matriarch again after the Wicker Man disaster)""The Book of Daniel"" relies on soap opera cliches (alcoholism/adultery/homosexuality) that are piled up at once. NBC stacked its deck with controversy. There's adultery and homosexuality on ""Desperate Housewives"" too,but it doesn't have the sensationalism. On top of that, Jesus appears in visions to Fr. Daniel to give him pep talks.Aidan Quinn is a talented actor; unfortunately,he's been a has-been since the '90s. This four episode series did not help his career. It was a disappointment. With its sappiness and heavy-handedness,""The Book of Daniel"" was doomed from the start.

That series was notorious for having some of the sharpest comedic actors playing eccentric villagers, where social life revolved around the church and their new vicar, Dawn French.  This show is a lot more somber than that.  It is pleasant and it tries to be both a comedy and a drama with Aidan Quinn as the reverend.  He is married, with children, adopted and biological, gay and straight.  Plus he has a father who is a bishop.  I think it is trying to be a little bit of everything, sort of a Jack of all trades.  Normally I like Aidan Quinn and I love Ellen Burstyn.  But this show just does not have the dramatic scripts and sharp conflicts they need in order to shine. As a series this just tries too hard.  I can't say it is terrible.  It is pleasant and a bit boring. There is one aspect I do not like at all.  Jesus appears to Aidan Quinn and they have conversations.  That is just too over the top for me.  I realize I am in a minority reviewing this show.  Most people like it.

And if you strip away all of the family problems, you are left with a priest who is a loving, caring man. This series gives us a peek inside the demanding life of a priest, from having to attend a socially mandatory golf outing to offering comfort to a family whose loved one is dying and counseling parishioners in crisis. I adored the portrayal of Jesus - he seemed to offer Father Daniel a realistic view of his actions with a bit of humor and some surprisingly insightful comments (I mean surprising for a television show - not for Jesus).

I had not realized how quickly attached I had become to the characters; it was like seeing old friends.  As one other reviewer noted, I too watched it all in one sitting.Though the DVD contains only the seven episodes filmed prior to its getting the axe by NBC network execs due to protests from the Dominionistic-minded Christian Right, I am grateful for what there is.  I had hoped that the episodes might contain cast or director commentaries, maybe even scripts and a photo gallery.  Still, I am not complaining.  My only complaint is that some other cable giant (like HBO or Showtime) has not found the nerve to pick up on this wonderful portrait of a not-so-perfect Christian world and placed it into the safer environment of cable television.

1002840,AF3L7GVC6T94P,B000GFLEKY,Geminiguy,"[10, 11]","Honestly, the controversy surrounding this little TV epic was just to bigger than what it should have been. In essence this is a family drama and it just happens to involve the father being a minister and the fact that he happens to have sporradic conversations with Jesus. The other sub-plots... a daughter sellingg pot, a gay son, a son bedding a girl younger than him who comes from a family full of ""racist"" tension, a pill popping minister, a bishop who is engaged in an adulterous (yet, oddly enough... understandable...) affair. Some of the story arcs are never fully realised but there are others that get full on attention. for example, the daughters momentary slip into selling pot actually comes back later with a positive spin to it; it is a moment both humerous and heartbreaking.This is a powerful, character driven mini-series. The fact that the church is even involved is really window dressing as the real meat of the program happens during the ""family"" time. Ever actor is solid in this and to single any out would be rather redundant. They all got their chance to shine in the episode ""God's Will"" as each got to explore different emotional moments with their characters. That episode is also a very powerful one... another tear jerker that has a (thankfully) 7th Heaven ending... well, kind of.I am disapointed that the controversy killed the remaining episodes air time... but people are so thin skinned these days it is a wonder this show even got made.

I am truly a God fearing man.And in spite of this (or maybe because of it) I found 'The Book of Daniel' to be a lovely change of pace.

He struggled with everyday issues -- a gay son, a drug abusing daughter, et cetera -- but at the end of the day it was apparent that Daniel was a caring, loving man.The show's portrayal of Jesus flows against what many might be comfortable with, but I enjoyed it. He was funny, warm, and he comes across as shockingly human (of course to my mind, this interpretation of Jesus is wholly Daniel's -- I don't think the show means to insinuate that this is what Jesus is really like).The show has been accused of deliberately trying to offend, but I agree with Reverend Susan Russell's examination of the show:""How cool is it that a progressive Episcopal priest has a shot at being a prime-time drama protagonist. How surprising might it be to many who tune in to find out there actually is a church where women can be bishops - clergy can be human - and there's enough good news around to extend to everybody?""However, the show proved to have more detractors than supporters in the religious community, and so NBC relented, dropping the show after only three episodes.'The Book of Daniel' was a breath of fresh air.

Gawlitta ""Coolmoan""","[79, 95]","I'm so pleased that this wonderful show will be available to enjoy again; I only saw a few episodes because our affiiate in Milwaukee bowed to the protests of a small few, and it was taken off. It's been a while, but I remember Aidan Quinn giving a fine interpretation of a conflicted man; a just and right and Christian man, facing issues that affect all of society. Also, a family man, with those profound concerns as an added challenge. As I recall, Jesus Christ had conversations with him, and this seemed to offend some closed-minded fundamentalist types. What I found intriguing was that we all like to think of our own clergymen as having some kind of connection to the Lord. Clergymen pray, and all this show portrayed was a clergyman's converations with the Lord, and his interpretation. Apparently, anyone who didn't appreciate ""The Book of Daniel"" are those who don't believe in prayer or their clergymen. Anyone who thinks that Jesus Christ isn't with us all the time shouldn't call himself a Christian. If the fundamentalists are offended by this show, then I'm offended by their idiot, closed-minded approach to spirituality. This show must have been especially interesting to the agnostics, if only for it's soft approach to a touchy subject matter. I write this with absolute respect to other religions, but encourage them to witness a well-written show, rife with humor as well as serious subject matter, to know that no one, even a clergyman, has all the answers, and that the Lord, whatever you may call him, is always there and it's comforting to know that we're not alone.

1002863,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000GFLEKY,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 5]","When I borrowed this DVD set from my library, I thought it was one of those British shows about a parrish priest who has to deal with the whacky members of his community in sometimes funny but mostly painful set pieces. Instead it was a forgotten NBC show that caused controversy for being all about an episcopalian minister with a drunk wife and a gay son and a lot of speechifying about how gays are people too. It was tailor made for Don Wildmon to stage a boycott because it was anti-Christian.Everyone else boycotted it because it sucked.For all its attempts at edginess, the execution is sorely lacking. This show is utterly tone deaf in the way it handles characters and plot development. For the most part it's a dippy soap opera that strives to be the urbane version of7th Heaven - The Complete Fifth Seasonbut with a little less gay subtext (some gay context but of the ""I'm gay, so...um...yeah...go gays"" variety). There's also the self conscious Six Feet Under imitation with the ""artistic but messed up"" little sister and the gay brother and the utter self-involvement of everyone.Beyond that, it feels like a Very Special Episode of an 80s sit com. Father Daniel is a pill popper but he never seems to have any withdrawal symptoms or euphoria. THe mother is a drunk, but she never slurs her words, has a hangover or well anything. THe gay son is gay but not too gay to have sex with a girl. THe daughter is dealing pot to keep her interweb venture going (even though this is an obviously wealthy family that could buy her a computer and programs). They have an black old lady as a servant (and like most black characters in predominantly white shows, she is a spring of sage advice and smiles and cookies. She also smokes pot but that's for her diabetes). When the adopted son is caught sleeping with the daughter of another character, they send the daughter away because they don't want to have ""Oriental grandchildren"". When the mother visits the grandmother the grandmother talks about how girls don't need to get into man things (like computers) and should just look pretty. The sister becomes a lesbian but then gets over it. New York is full of mobster contractors who randomly beat up homosexuals and the friendly Catholic priest friend is a way of communicating with the mafia.To make matters worse, the writing is incredibly lazy even when you get past the broad stereotypes. Everyone seems to be conveniently positioned to spy on everyone else. The mother is always a jerk. Everyone has a sermon. Jesus keeps showing up to impart wisdom straigh fromAll I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.However, there is a rather stockholm syndrome factor working where the more you watch, the less you care about the dopy bits. THe ""oh you're mobsters! I thought you were the gay couple!"" double take and spit take scene doesn't seem quite as stupid as it did the first time. The problem is that even if you are watching it for a dumb thrill, it's not nearly as dumb as it could be so even the ""bad cultural stereotype"" drinking game will wear on you (and kill you with alcohol poisoning).",2,Awful.

While it didn't attack faith -- Aiden Quinn's Daniel Webster is nothing if not devout & caring -- it did raise plenty of questions. And that's what did it in, of course.It's a sad irony that those who claim to be true followers of any belief often seem to have the least amount of faith in it -- a single question, a single doubt, can bring the whole glittering but fragile structure tumbling down around their ears. So rather than take the risk of testing their faith, they choose to attack those who do ask the difficult questions. Unfortunately, it's not only a loss for them, it's a loss for the rest of us as well.So it's a pleasure to see that all completed episodes of this promising series, including the unaired ones, are available on DVD. As previous reviewers have noted, you don't necessarily have to be a believer to enjoy the fine writing & acting offered here. Daniel's family could be many American families, religious or not, dealing with a world that runs at an increasingly faster pace, threatening to sweep us all up in its frantic rush forward -- to where?That last question, ""to where?"", is the one that matters, the question that we all must ask ourselves. Shows like this one are an attempt to grapple with that question & all of its implications. What's it all about? Isn't there more to life than reality TV, endless & mindless consumption, a smirking fratboy attitude toward sex & everything else? Isn't there some deeper meaning to be found? How do we live in this imperfect & often confusing world? That's what ""The Book of Daniel"" tried to address, with warmth, humor, and plenty of smarts.
