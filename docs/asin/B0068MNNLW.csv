1513354,ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B0068MNNLW,Fred Adelman,"[0, 0]","INKUBUS (2011) - Interesting horror film that is somewhat marred by its shot-on-HD-video look (filmed using Canon 5D Mark II cameras). Most of the film is shown in flashback, as we watch seemingly disturbed ex-Detective Tom Caretti (Joey Fatone; ex-member of the boy band NSYNC and one of this film's many Executive Producers), who is in a strait-jacket in a rubber room, telling his psychiatrist what happened to him and his wife Erin (Michelle Ray Smith), also a cop, on a fateful day in the near past. Tom believes his wife gave birth to a demon baby and he explains why. He was on duty at a soon-to-be-closed police station (shades of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 - 1976) when a man known simply as Inkubus (Robert Englund, in one of his largest roles in recent memory) walks into the station holding the decapitated head of a recently murdered girl (the police already have a suspect in custody for her murder and didn't believe his story when he told them that someone mysteriously appeared out of thin air and cut off his girlfriend's head with a large retractable blade while they were making love). Inkubus instantly begins playing heads games with the skeleton crew after they arrest and handcuff him, starting with Officer Tech (Jonathan Silverman; WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S - 1989). While Tech begins typing his report (Inkubus insists his name be spelled with an inverted &#34;k&#34;, which Tech does on his computer with a simple keystroke!), Inkubus effortlessly slips out of the cuffs, disappears, reappears this time with his hands cuffed in front of him and seemingly makes Tech's gun disappear and reappear. Tom and the rest of the small crew check out Inkubus' van, where they find a whole bunch of blood and human body parts. Inkubus demands his one phone call and makes the phone dial by itself; the call being to retired Detective Gil Diamante (a white-haired William Forsythe; THE RIG - 2010), who nearly caught Inkubus thirteen years earlier after he killed Gil's wife and his young son disappeared. He wants Gil to come to the station, but first Gil needs to bring along his personal psychiatrist, Dr. Emily Winstrom (Dyan Kane), who has to accompany Gil everywhere since his wife was slaughtered. Meanwhile, Inkubus tells the stationhouse residents that he was responsible for most of the unsolved (and some that were thought to have been solved) murders throughout history (including the Jack The Ripper murders), but he needs to be reborn every hundred years. Since he is very near that date, I guess you can already determine what is about to happen. None of the cops believe his story, thinking that he is just some crazy serial killer, except Gil, who shows up with Dr. Winstrom. Their minds are about to be blown. Inkubus disappears and begins to slowly force everyone to face their most personal demons, killing some by himself with his large retractable blade and making others believe they are killing Inkubus when they are, in fact, killing each other. At the end of the day, only Tom and Erin are left alive, which leads to the birth of the demon baby. Or was it all in Tom's mind?  The screenplay (by Carl V. Dupre; HELLRAISER: HELLWORLD - 2003), effects and acting are basically above par for such a low-budget effort (Even Joey Fatone, who in flashbacks is bearded and is clean-shaven in the rubber room, is somewhat effective), but since director/co-producer Glenn Ciano (INFECTED - 2013, also starring Forsythe) decided to film it using HD cameras, it gives the movie a washed-out cheap look which detracts from some of the film's more scary moments. Some of the gory effects push the film's R-rating, especially the death of Dr. Winstrom, who is cut in half by Inkubus using his handy blade. When he pulls her two halves apart and her guts and intestines spill out, you'll be wondering if the MPAA was asleep at the wheel when they viewed this. Robert Englund is very effective in his role and seems to throw himself into it. The delivery of his dialogue and his overall acting here doesn't make it seem like he's phoning it in, like some of his roles in other recent horror films (like HEARTSTOPPER - 2006; although he was pretty funny in ZOMBIE STRIPPERS - 2008). Overall, besides the muddy photography, this is a halfway decent horror flick that should satisfy genre fans. Filmed in Rhode Island. Also starring Tom Paolini, Tom DeNucci, Mike Cerrone, Aubie Merrylees, Kevin DeCristofano and Fred Sullivan Jr. A Screen Media Films DVD Release.

INKUBUS is possibly the closest he's come to finding a similarly insidious character as Krueger.  Too bad the film itself is not as convincing as Englund.  Newcomer writer/director Greg Ciano offers little cinematically and the script is contrived and muddled.  Unfortunately, there is some potential here:  the premise of the Inkubus being responsible for classic unsolved murders, e.g. the Black Dahlia, is intriguing.  However, the film's too talky and its barebone setting is yawn-inducing.  There are some gory, albeit not frightening, scenes.  Joey Fatone from N'Sync is woefully miscast and the usually dependable William Forsythe is bland as the retired detective.

A creature that should only inhabit Sigourney Weaver is performing its own c-section. After the credits we see Detective Tom (Joey Fatone) who is in a straight jacket telling us about what happened that night at the police station...even the stuff that happened when he wasn't present. Tom makes love to fellow officer Erin Cole (Michelle Ray Smith) a woman who keeps her bra on while love making, apparently something she learned from watching Natalie Portman films. During the course of a homicide investigation, the Inkubus (Robert Englund) shows up with the victim's head and confesses to gruesome crimes that date back 100's of years.He tells us the In>lubus story and why he is there. Then things get weird, but not intense or frighting.  If you have enjoyed the cocky supernatural bad guy Robert Englund before, by all means check it out. What is unfortunate is that the supporting cast really didn't have any decent lines or personality. William Forsythe plays a near lifeless man, which was his role, but it made things a bit boring.

Let me tell you it can be one of the most original and fun horror films you can see in years. The film revolves around Robert's character who has just walked into a police station carrying a severed head. This happens in the first 10 minutes. It gets much much better from there. The amazing dynamic is seeing Robert go toe to toe with William Forsythe who portrays a retired police officer chasing after Robert from the old days. Well written and sharply acted (even by Fatone), this is one of those horror gems that comes once in a great while. Robert is hasn't been this sadistic since the first Nightmare on Elm Street.

While working at a police station on it's last day the few cops that are left begin to question a young teen on his girlfriend's murder. When a stranger walks in holding her severed head the night takes a wicked turn and they wonder if the stranger is an Inkubus out for revenge. This is a movie that will very much appeal to horror fans, and that may be it. The movie is just one step above a movie made for cable TV and if it weren't for the cast it would have been that. I'm not saying that the cast and acting are great but the fact that Freddy Kruger is in this adds a level of creepy that actually helps the movie. The budget is very very low and the film quality is blurry at times. 95% of the movie takes place in a very plain and boring station but that actually helps the movie I think. Overall, not really impressed at all but worth watching for the cast or if you are a huge horror movie fan. I give it a C+.",3,A very low budget but watchable horror movie that is only that way because of the cast. Freddy Kruger makes it OK.
