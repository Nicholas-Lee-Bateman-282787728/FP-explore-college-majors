If I had to hear one more time about her sobriety and the fact she is a recovering addict my head would explode.There were other problems with season five.  First and foremost was the loss of her best friend O'Hara, played by Eve Best, who has left NYC to be able to be with her new baby year round in the U.K.  It was a big loss as she was an integral part of the ensemble.  Next, Jackie finds a new boyfriend who is actually more boring than her ex-husband and not nearly as good-looking.  He comes across as a know-it-all and they don't seem to have the right chemistry.  We also have a new woman doctor in the ER who can't act and perform medicine at the same time.I sadly miss the Jackie who snuck pain medication, led a double life, cheated on her husband, but was quick, intelligent and witty with all her patients.  This season her personality is lacking its usual vitality and she has become someone the old Jackie would dislike, a whiner and a cranky one at that.On the good side, Zoey, played to perfection by Merritt Wever, just gets better with every season and this one is no exception, and the other regulars Eddie, Cooper, Thor, and Gloria are back and still as eccentric and well played as past seasons.  I still enjoyed the show.  It had its moments but they were just fewer and farther in-between then past seasons.  Jackie is a great character and Edie Falco does a wonderful job portraying her.  I believe that with a bit of work on the story-lines, some snappier dialogue and, some interesting developments that occurred late in the season, I have high hopes for a better season six.",4,Nurse Jackie's One Year of Sobriety,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,1776,"['One', 'thing', 'recovering', 'addicts', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'year', 'sobriety', 'true', 'season', 'five', 'Nurse', 'Jackie', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'hear', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'sobriety', 'fact', 'recovering', 'addict', 'head', 'would', 'explode.There', 'were', 'other', 'problems', 'season', 'five', 'First', 'foremost', 'was', 'loss', 'best', 'friend', ""O'Hara"", 'played', 'Eve', 'Best', 'who', 'left', 'NYC', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'new', 'baby', 'year', 'round', 'U.K', 'was', 'big', 'loss', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'ensemble', 'Next', 'Jackie', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'actually', 'more', 'boring', 'ex-husband', 'not', 'nearly', 'good-looking', 'across', 'know-it-all', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'right', 'chemistry', 'also', 'have', 'new', 'woman', 'doctor', 'ER', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'perform', 'medicine', 'same', 'time.I', 'sadly', 'miss', 'Jackie', 'who', 'snuck', 'pain', 'medication', 'led', 'double', 'life', 'cheated', 'husband', 'was', 'quick', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'patients', 'season', 'personality', 'lacking', 'usual', 'vitality', 'become', 'someone', 'old', 'Jackie', 'would', 'dislike', 'whiner', 'cranky', 'one', 'that.On', 'good', 'side', 'Zoey', 'played', 'perfection', 'Merritt', 'Wever', 'just', 'better', 'season', 'one', 'exception', 'other', 'regulars', 'Eddie', 'Cooper', 'Thor', 'Gloria', 'are', 'back', 'still', 'eccentric', 'well', 'played', 'past', 'seasons', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'just', 'fewer', 'farther', 'in-between', 'then', 'past', 'seasons', 'Jackie', 'great', 'character', 'Edie', 'Falco', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'believe', 'bit', 'work', 'story-lines', 'snappier', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'developments', 'occurred', 'late', 'season', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'better', 'season', 'six']",Nurse Jackie: Season 5

I have only one criticism, the plot lines from last season are too blithely wrapped up in the premier episode. Dr. O'Hara played so well by Eve Best leaves rather abruptly, and I would have loved to see Jackie and Zoey (Emmy winning Merritt Ever) play out longer as roomates, she and Edie Falco as Jackie have a priceless dynamic with Falco's straight man to Merritt's zaniness. But that said both new and old characters provide great comedy. It is hard to picture comedy amongst the chaos and tragedy of an urban emergency room but, having worked in one myself it is completely possible. Another new character is a self centered and vacuous Dr. Carrie Roman who meets her match in equally vain golden boy Dr. Cooper. Jackie is well Jackie, even after giving up the OxyContin, adderal, and Percocet, she is as blunt and irritable as ever. She has a lot to be annoyed about a divorce and custody battle, two daughters acting out, and an unexpected new romance. But she faces everything as usual head on and in her own way.
