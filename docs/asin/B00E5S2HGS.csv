1664834,A3NXYUBU3KIQ9,B00E5S2HGS,Boddicker,"[1, 1]","This one surprised the hell out of me because the only reason I heard to own this collection was to get &#34;The Outing&#34; (aka The Lamp) on DVD for the first time.  The Outing was without a doubt the weakest movie in this collection!!!!!!!!  On to the individual reviews:What's the Matter with Helen:  This was quite a bit more watchable than I had really supposed.  I figured I would be in for a slow burner with the &#34;big shock&#34; at the end, I was right, but I fully enjoyed the journey there.  Well acted.  4 out of 5.The Vagrant:  Wow, I can't believe I had never heard of this film.  I was expecting something straight horror, not trippy surrealistic horror.  It's got Bill Paxton (Game Over, Man!!!!!!), the always great Michael Ironside, and Marshall Bell (Kuato's twin brother) as the titular Vagrant.  Definitely a hidden gem.  I was a little torn over the ending though.  4 out of 5.The Godsend:  Hmmm, I'll say this about this movie; I didn't yawn once, but I was never fully entertained either.  This is your standard creepy kid movie like The Omen.  Thing is The Omen's Damien was actually somewhat unnerving while Godsend's &#34;Bonnie&#34; isn't.  Well acted.  3 out of 5.The Outing:  What a waste of potential.  The genie looked great, a pity it didn't appear till the last 15 minutes of the movie.  When a movie uses possessed people and telekinetically flying objects as the main baddie for most of the film you know you're in trouble.  The weakest of the set.  2 out of 5.",4,Surprisingly better than Vol 2,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,1500,"['one', 'surprised', 'hell', 'only', 'reason', 'heard', 'own', 'collection', 'was', 'get', '34', 'Outing', '34', 'Lamp', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'Outing', 'was', 'doubt', 'weakest', 'movie', 'collection', 'individual', 'reviews', 'What', 'Matter', 'Helen', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'watchable', 'had', 'really', 'supposed', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'slow', 'burner', '34', 'big', 'shock', '34', 'end', 'was', 'right', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'journey', 'there', 'Well', 'acted', '4', '5.The', 'Vagrant', 'Wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'straight', 'horror', 'not', 'trippy', 'surrealistic', 'horror', 'got', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Game', 'Over', 'Man', 'always', 'great', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'Kuato', 'twin', 'brother', 'titular', 'Vagrant', 'Definitely', 'hidden', 'gem', 'was', 'little', 'torn', 'ending', '4', '5.The', 'Godsend', 'Hmmm', ""'ll"", 'say', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'yawn', 'once', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'entertained', 'either', 'standard', 'creepy', 'kid', 'movie', 'Omen', 'Thing', 'Omen', 'Damien', 'was', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'unnerving', 'Godsend', '34', 'Bonnie', '34', ""n't"", 'Well', 'acted', '3', '5.The', 'Outing', 'What', 'waste', 'potential', 'genie', 'looked', 'great', 'pity', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'till', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'When', 'movie', 'possessed', 'people', 'telekinetically', 'flying', 'objects', 'main', 'baddie', 'most', 'film', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'weakest', 'set', '2', '5']","Scream Factory: All Night Horror Marathon (Whats the Matter with Helen, The Vagrant, The Godsend & The Outing)"

1664839,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00E5S2HGS,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","Scream Factory offers up an entertaining DVD compilation of forgotten and underrated cult classics with its &#34;4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon&#34; 2-disc set. The combination is made up of films which span three decades and come in a variety of different levels of quality when it comes to production. It truly is a perfect blend of genre flicks for a fun evening in with friends and family.1971's &#34;What's the Matter with Helen?&#34; is a great thriller that constantly reminds the viewer of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford's &#34;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&#34; Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds take the lead spinster roles that Davis and Crawford made famous and mold them into their own. Two women move to California to get a fresh start after their sons are indicted for murder in their small hometown. Just as they are settling into their new glamorous lives, the past comes back to haunt them in the form or mysterious calls and shadowy figures following them.&#34;The Vagrant&#34; stars Bill Paxton in the role of a yuppie that is haunted by a deformed homeless man after he moves into his new house. Talk about a fun 1990's black comedy with some nice thrills and chills. Paxton is fabulous as the anxiety-driven suit being terrorized by the deliciously vile Marshall Bell playing the vagrant.1980's &#34;The Godsend&#34; is the British equivalent of &#34;The Bad Seed.&#34; It's obviously not as well-executed as the 1958 original, but the creepy little girl (Wilhelmina Green ) causing all the commotion is effective and gives you goose bumps at the proper times throughout its run time. Playing out a bit like &#34;The Omen,&#34; the Marlowes adopt the baby girl a strange woman gives birth to in their home. Suspicions arise when the couple's other children begin dying from freak accidents that occur when little Bonnie is around.&#34;The Outing&#34; is the edited and shortened version of 1987's &#34;The Lamp.&#34; Filled with idiotic teens doing even more idiotic things in a closed museum, it revolves around an evil genie released from its bottle to wreak havoc. There are some great scenes in the film, which is basically your typical teen slasher flick with supernatural elements added in. You can't help but feel like this would make a brilliant companion for a double feature with &#34;Leprechaun.&#34;All the films included in the &#34;4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon&#34; 2-Disc set are rated R except &#34;What's the Matter with Helen.&#34; The rating is understandable for &#34;The Vagrant&#34; and &#34;The Outing&#34; as there are some scenes of nudity and gore. However, &#34;What's the Matter with Helen?&#34; and &#34;The Godsend&#34; are both tame by today's standards and have violence and some language but not much else to find offensive.Although there's no extras included with &#34;4 Movie All Night Horror Marathon&#34; 2-Disc set, it lives up to its name and is worth every penny you'll spend on it. If I were younger and surrounded by genre-loving friends, I could see doing a six hour binge of these movies.

1664842,AYMZTWBG0V53W,B00E5S2HGS,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[1, 1]","Too many reviewers have given you their two cents on the picture and sound, so I'll just put in my say quickly about these films:&#34;What's the Matter with Helen?&#34; I understand was added in place of an Italian horror film that was supposed to fill its slot, so I am disappointed that it's included here. However, I probably wouldn't have ordered the &#34;Who Slew Auntie Roo?&#34; disc from Midnite Movies either, and the picture/sound is good on this one. A fairly obvious, but creepy, shocker involving a clearly deranged Shelley Winters.&#34;The Vagrant&#34; I could not sit through, but I didn't put much effort into it. A silly film from Chris Wallis, whom we should demand more from considering all of his great work on the &#34;The Fly&#34; and &#34;The Fly II.&#34; An idiotic time waster.&#34;The Godsend&#34;--while I have yet to read the novel that this film is allegedly based upon, I have to say that the film is ripe to be rediscovered by historians. One view posits that the film is boring and pointless, not to mention slow. I think the filmmakers tried to make a serious drama (for the most part) and sold their film as &#34;horror&#34; which ultimately did not do the film a service. The performances are interesting, but there is not much else here to recommend the film--&#34;The Bad Seed&#34; this is not, but I think there may be a more interesting film here than most people have posited.&#34;The Outing&#34;--Okay, another disappointment. I was hoping for &#34;The Lamp&#34; to get a proper, special features-packed U. S. DVD release. What a dreamer, right? If you Wikipedia Warren Chaney you will be floored by the amount of work and productions that this guy has been associated with, and I'm not just talking films/movies. This guy is obviously smart and a hard worker, to put it mildly. However, this junky script is not his best work, and the cast/crew (including Chaney himself) obviously didn't put much thought or effort into the effects or into the (weak) story. For a church-going man of commitment, Chaney's work here is trashy and too much involved with playing to the teen/silly nudity/gory scares crowd. But what upsets me is the lack of story development. Geez. The picture and sound appeared okay to me, but the other complaints on here on not without merit. But apparently &#34;The Lamp&#34; is a better edit (not to mention a better film, that allegedly makes more sense) so maybe some day we will get a Warren Chaney film set...won't we?

I will also think twice before ordering another dvd from SHOUT FACTORY.",1,This is CRAP !!!!!!!,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,544,"['TERRIBLE', 'TERRIBLE', 'TERRIBLE', 'ordered', '4th', 'movie', 'OUTING', 'surprise', 'dark', 'black', 'picture', 'can', 'get', 'vhs', 'looks', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'i', 'also', 'have', 'import', 'dvd', 'original', 'title', 'LAMP', 'just', 'step', 'vhs', 'i', 'actually', 'thought', 'people', 'SHOUT', 'FACTORY', 'was', 'better', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'crap', 'release', 'buy', 'bootleg', 'someplace', 'i', 'promise', 'quality', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'will', 'also', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'ordering', 'dvd', 'SHOUT', 'FACTORY']","Scream Factory: All Night Horror Marathon (Whats the Matter with Helen, The Vagrant, The Godsend & The Outing)"
