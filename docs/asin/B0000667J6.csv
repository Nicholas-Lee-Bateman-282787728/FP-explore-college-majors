701028,A1MIB8NFBT6EC2,B0000667J6,"Beatles Examiner Steve ""I love music""","[1, 1]","We had the honor and privilege of interviewing Henry Diltz a few years ago. It was a pleasure to hear his stories and many of them are recounted here in this DVD. Diltz has worked with just about anyone you can name, including Crosby Stills and Nash, the Doors, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Monkees (he was their primary photographer), Paul McCartney and a million others. His stories are a fountain of information. My favorite story is the creation of the Morrison Hotel cover, which he recounts here. A great bargain with a treasure trove of information and background into the music of the '60s and '70s from someone who played an integral role.",5,Behind the lens of '60s rock,1194220800,"11 5, 2007",2007,644,"['had', 'honor', 'privilege', 'interviewing', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'stories', 'many', 'are', 'recounted', 'here', 'DVD', 'Diltz', 'worked', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'name', 'including', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'Doors', 'Lovin', 'Spoonful', 'Monkees', 'was', 'primary', 'photographer', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'million', 'others', 'stories', 'are', 'fountain', 'information', 'favorite', 'story', 'creation', 'Morrison', 'Hotel', 'cover', 'here', 'A', 'great', 'bargain', 'treasure', 'trove', 'information', 'background', 'music', ""'60s"", ""'70s"", 'someone', 'who', 'played', 'integral', 'role']",Under the Covers - A Magical Journey: Rock N Roll in L.A. in the 60's - 70's

Read on...One of my favorite movies featuring a Porsche Speedster is ""Under the Covers - A Magical Journey: Rock N Roll in L.A. in the 60's - 70's"".  You can find it at Amazon.com, ebay or a used DVD store.  Its well worth looking for.The film follows rock photographer Henry Diltz and album cover designer Gary Burden as they tool around LA in Henry's 356 Porsche ""bathtub"" Speedster, visiting locations like the Morrison Hotel and Venice Beach, recounting the adventures they had with the Doors, Cass Eliot of the Mamas and Papas, Joanie Mitchell, CSN, Richard Prior, the Eagles...You get the picture.

Finally found it and was able to watch the whole thing this week.  It is great and I highly recommend it.A couple of old hippies just tooling around and reminiscing with some good old friends.  For those of us of a certain age and a certain life style, back in the day, it brings back wonderful memories.  Not that I was there at the time, but there were I suspect little enclaves all over the U.S. where people were living the same life style. Even if we were not quite as talented and lucky as those in this movie.The two guys were very talented and their record album covers are still around to attest to that(as were the people who made the albums the covers went over).  They were clearly serious about their work and with reason, the results were often amazing.  It was neat to watch them go over all the photos the one guy had saved from the 60s & 70s, many of which I suspect have not seen the light of day since they were taken.The people in this movie seemed to understand that they had this charmed life.  Also, one thing I really like is that none of them are particularly embarrassed about what they did in terms of drugs and such.  Sex, drugs and rock and roll was more than a slogan it was a way of life and no one really expresses any regret.In fact they all seem to think that if they could get away with it now they wouldn't mind doing it again.  Well me to.Watch it if you can.",5,Oh to Have Been There,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,1479,"[""'d"", 'seen', 'part', 'TV', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'been', 'looking', 'Finally', 'found', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'week', 'great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'it.A', 'couple', 'old', 'hippies', 'just', 'tooling', 'around', 'reminiscing', 'good', 'old', 'friends', 'certain', 'age', 'certain', 'life', 'style', 'back', 'day', 'back', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'Not', 'was', 'there', 'time', 'were', 'suspect', 'little', 'enclaves', 'U.S.', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'living', 'same', 'life', 'style', 'Even', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'talented', 'lucky', 'movie.The', 'two', 'guys', 'were', 'very', 'talented', 'record', 'album', 'covers', 'are', 'still', 'attest', 'were', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'albums', 'covers', 'went', 'were', 'clearly', 'serious', 'work', 'reason', 'results', 'were', 'often', 'amazing', 'was', 'neat', 'watch', 'go', 'photos', 'one', 'guy', 'had', 'saved', '60s', '70s', 'many', 'suspect', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'were', 'taken.The', 'people', 'movie', 'seemed', 'understand', 'had', 'charmed', 'life', 'Also', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'none', 'are', 'particularly', 'embarrassed', 'what', 'did', 'terms', 'drugs', 'such', 'Sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'was', 'more', 'slogan', 'was', 'way', 'life', 'one', 'really', 'regret.In', 'fact', 'seem', 'think', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'again', 'Well', 'to.Watch', 'can']",Under the Covers - A Magical Journey: Rock N Roll in L.A. in the 60's - 70's
701034,A2792QUVUEP74U,B0000667J6,Shred,"[7, 7]","I really enjoyed this movie. It's the story of Henry Diltz, and Gary Burden the designers of some very famous album covers by Crosby Stills, and Nash, Joni Mitchell, The Eagles, Jackson Browne, The Doors etc.  These guys are a couple of old happy hippies.This movie is a loose documentary with some very funny stories. They also go and talk to the Eagles and others with whom they made their famous album covers for.Glenn Frey of The Eagles is looking over the pictures shot for their first album cover. Apparently everyone, including Diltz and Burden, were high on peyote for a long day and night in the desert. My favorite line in the movie is when Glenn Frey says ""These pictures aren't history, they're EVIDENCE!""They also tell the story of how Diltz crash landed with Jimmy Webb in a glider and almost died. The also include a lot of old 8mm film footage taken while they were actually filming the album covers so you really feel like you are there.These guys really changed the art of the album cover which is all but gone today because we have these miniature picture books in CD's.  I found myself wanting to be there when they were making these covers. I'd love to hang with these guys for an afternoon.All in all a great movie worth seeing for any old hippie.",5,Excellent classic rock documentary,1118966400,"06 17, 2005",2005,1269,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'story', 'Henry', 'Diltz', 'Gary', 'Burden', 'designers', 'very', 'famous', 'album', 'covers', 'Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'Joni', 'Mitchell', 'Eagles', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Doors', 'etc', 'guys', 'are', 'couple', 'old', 'happy', 'hippies.This', 'movie', 'loose', 'documentary', 'very', 'funny', 'stories', 'also', 'go', 'talk', 'Eagles', 'others', 'whom', 'made', 'famous', 'album', 'for.Glenn', 'Frey', 'Eagles', 'looking', 'pictures', 'shot', 'first', 'album', 'cover', 'Apparently', 'everyone', 'including', 'Diltz', 'Burden', 'were', 'high', 'peyote', 'long', 'day', 'night', 'desert', 'favorite', 'line', 'movie', 'when', 'Glenn', 'Frey', 'pictures', 'are', ""n't"", 'history', ""'re"", 'EVIDENCE', 'also', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'Diltz', 'crash', 'landed', 'Jimmy', 'Webb', 'glider', 'almost', 'died', 'also', 'include', 'lot', 'old', '8mm', 'film', 'footage', 'taken', 'were', 'actually', 'filming', 'album', 'so', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'there.These', 'guys', 'really', 'changed', 'art', 'album', 'cover', 'gone', 'today', 'have', 'miniature', 'picture', 'books', 'CD', 'found', 'wanting', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'were', 'making', 'covers', ""'d"", 'love', 'hang', 'guys', 'afternoon.All', 'great', 'movie', 'seeing', 'old', 'hippie']",Under the Covers - A Magical Journey: Rock N Roll in L.A. in the 60's - 70's
