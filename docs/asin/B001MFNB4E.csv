1217000,A16XRPF40679KG,B001MFNB4E,,"[0, 1]","This flick is a gory horror b movie. It has a higher budget than many b movies though and looks pretty good. It's not a great movie but it does deliver on gore and other monster movie standards.  This one can trace it's roots back to a short story by Clive Barker and even farther back to the classic works of H.P. Lovecraft.  The blu ray print looks great and it is grainy as are many movies shot with this aspect. Blu ray can really bring this out but it's not distracting at all.  I won't go into the plot other than to say their is a killer and a conspiracy that revolves around a subway train set up as a 'meat train'.  To say anymore would ruin any surprises that you might enjoy watching this movie.  Some of the gore effects are done by cgi and this should have been done by standard effects because a eye flying out of a head done by cgi (computer generated effects) doesn't look as real as using the old fashioned methods of making a fake head etc, unless of course they had the money to do it with a higher cgi budget.  Sometimes the old methods are still the best unless you have the big cgi bucks to make it look real.  However to enjoy this movie you should first off be a b movie horror  fan and second enjoy a over the top movie with gore scenes.  This movie is NOT for preteen children; some horror movies are ok for that but this isn't one of them.",3,blu ray edition really hands out the gore.,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,1366,"['flick', 'gory', 'horror', 'b', 'movie', 'higher', 'budget', 'many', 'b', 'movies', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'deliver', 'gore', 'other', 'monster', 'movie', 'standards', 'one', 'can', 'trace', 'roots', 'back', 'short', 'story', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'even', 'farther', 'back', 'classic', 'works', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'blu', 'ray', 'print', 'great', 'grainy', 'are', 'many', 'movies', 'shot', 'aspect', 'Blu', 'ray', 'can', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'not', 'distracting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'other', 'say', 'killer', 'conspiracy', 'subway', 'train', 'set', 'up', ""'meat"", 'train', 'say', 'anymore', 'would', 'ruin', 'surprises', 'might', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'cgi', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'standard', 'effects', 'eye', 'flying', 'head', 'done', 'cgi', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', ""n't"", 'look', 'as', 'real', 'using', 'old', 'fashioned', 'methods', 'making', 'fake', 'head', 'etc', 'course', 'had', 'money', 'do', 'higher', 'cgi', 'budget', 'old', 'methods', 'are', 'still', 'best', 'have', 'big', 'cgi', 'bucks', 'make', 'look', 'real', 'However', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'should', 'first', 'off', 'be', 'b', 'movie', 'horror', 'fan', 'second', 'enjoy', 'top', 'movie', 'gore', 'scenes', 'movie', 'NOT', 'preteen', 'children', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'ok', ""n't"", 'one']",N/A

1217010,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B001MFNB4E,A Customer,"[0, 0]","I remember reading this short story by Clive Barker and was looking forward to this. Vinnie Jones is great and it must have been a right result getting an acting job with no lines to learn! His characters name 'Mahogany' is very appropriate, I'm sure I'll spot it soon as someone's gamertag on Xbox Live.Bradley Cooper, known for his role in `The Hangover' films and the excellent `Limitless' is the photographer trying to make a name for himself. He's advised to make improvements in order to gain serious interest in his photography art, so he starts shooting pictures of everything at night. Late one night in a subway station he saves a stranger from assault and then his whole world takes an unexpected turn...I won't go into further plot because this is a real surprising thrill movie to watch. It has put me off from travelling late on any of the worlds underground travel networks, just the same reaction when I couldn't take a bath after watching 'Jaws'! The Blu - ray version I watched did have some salt and pepper distortion, so I plan to return it and request a replacement. I love the films atmosphere and the feeling of raw panic and dread. The director; Ryuhei Kitamura has done a terrific job here, this film seems to be his first major project. He is definitely another talented director to look out for.Bradley Cooper is a popular guy casting directors use at the moment. I saw him in 'Hangover 2'. He's cool, the ladies adore him and he is a good actor. His work journey is like the guy who starred in 'Avatar'; Sam Worthington. You don't know them and suddenly they seem to be in many films. My only niggle with this film is that some of the violence is so over the top special effects, almost crossing the terror line over to comedy town, but it's not a major problem...I had a word with myself and rolled with it. I hope this film will have cult status with horror collectors and enthusiasts. It's a lot better than it's marketing suggests; Yes it has the gore content and incredibly violent murders, but the thread of the story and how it builds up is it's strength.Clive Barker is a genius. He gave us 'Hellraiser', he can do no wrong....similar to Stephen Kings stories that are made into film, Clive has had some hits and misses as well. However, I can assure you that MMT is a big hit for me. The problem with some horror films like 'Clive Barkers The Plague' is that they are good creative ideas, but their straight to 'sci-fi channel curse' is due to bad acting and awful production. Luckily a sensible amount of money was invested into 'The Midnight Meat Train'.As a sideline comment Clive Barkers 'Books of Blood' short stories are simply brilliant and I intend to read both volumes again. 'Candyman' was another one of his efforts as a writer, which was not bad at all back in 1992. My wife had a market stall at some spook festival, she noticed that a bloke was leaning, with his back towards her, resting on her table far too close to her gorgeous work. She told him off in a polite manner....it was only Clive bloody Barker!He is a great talent and this film is scary, thrilling and clever.

A chance encounter with a pack of muggers on the subway gives him the break he's been looking for, but it also jump starts his obsession with a silent, intimidating man nicknamed ""Mahogany"", played with just the right touch of menace by Vinnie Jones.Leon, in true horror movie fashion, begins following Mahogany around, and learns that he is a butcher by trade, working in a meat packing plant.  Coincidentally, or maybe not, Mahogany always seems to be on the subway whenever people go missing, and soon Leon's obsession consumes him completely, much to the dismay of his intended fianc&eacute;e Maya (Leslie Bibb)The plot moves along nicely, and as the other characters are developed, you learn that not everybody is who they appear to be.  The movie ends with three individual cinematic moments.  The first is a no-holds-barred fight scene aboard the ""meat train"" which really works, the second is the ""explanation"" for the disappearances which doesn't work at all, and the third is the defining moment which you knew was going to happen from around midway in the movie.Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1.

It was supposed to open theatrically on Aug. 1 but was buried by the distributor, appearing not at mainstream cinemas but at second run theaters, which are known by many as ""dollar theaters."" Having seen the film, I don't know why this was done because ""Midnight"" easily appeals to all kinds of horror fans, including those who are gorehounds, slasher lovers, and of course followers of Clive Barker's strange mind. The film focuses on a photographer who is told by an art dealer that he needs to do more to get the best pictures. He takes her advice and starts staying out after dark. In the subway system, he meets a silent man who seems to be up to no good. The film plays with concepts of good and evil, corruption, ""seeing,"" and more. I was actually impressed by its depth, given its subject matter. I sought it out because 1) I'm a huge horror buff and 2) it's directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, and stylishly so.

The last commuters of the evening are being butchered by Vinnie Jones. This is never in doubt. The question the film presents is why?TMMT is based on a short story by Clive Barker, and they did well to stretch a decent film length from it. The sets are amazing as expected. It doesnt take a huge leap of imagination to make a train carriage at night seem menacing. The hammer is the main weapon of choice and plenty of heads roll and eyes pop. Not a film for the faint hearted.Storyline wise you need to accept a lot of pretty big coincidences which allow things to progress during the build ups. Assuming you do, the storyline works.Vinnie Jones is excellent as Mahogany. The perfect choice. I found the couple annoying pretty much the whole time. Brooke Shields gives a great performance as the cougar type gallery owner, but I think they missed a trick in not bumping her off along the way.

It establishes the presence of a serial killer, it gives us decent characterization of the main cast, and the story is intriguing.  Something evil is happening on a certain subway train at 2:06 AM, and we want to know what it is.  Unfortunately the entire films falls apart during the second half.During the second act, the film changes focus and become the stereotypical torture-porn Lion's Gate is notorious for with their other ""goreno"" films.  It's as if the film was split down the middle between Clive Barker's original short story and Jeff Buhler's screenplay.  To add insult to injury (no pun intended), every primary plot point that was hinted upon is thrown aside, every seeming truth to the narrative is sunk, and the four or five revelations as to what is going on are nothing but gaping, nonsensical plot holes that the film does not even attempt to answer.  It will just throw out a ridiculously bizarre situation, but it will take no means to explain or even placate us as to what the heck is happening.  What was that scarification committed upon on the main character?  What was killing people?  Where did It come from?  What is It?!I haven't read the original material, so I have no idea if the plot is revealed in the short story or not.  But as for a film, it doesn't work for me because midway through it stops being a character driven thriller and it devolves into near mindless exposition, ""The Matrix"" inspired scenes, and CGI gore without any intent to deliver anything except this.  It wastes the otherwise good performances by the principal  cast, and it throws aside any redeeming qualities it could have offered.  I'm not sure what Buhler was trying to say in his film, but to me it didn't work.

1217021,A18D0R137EYS6C,B001MFNB4E,Clinton Enlow,"[1, 1]","No doubt if you're a fan of three things (Horror fiction, Clive Barker and Ryuhei Kitamura) you've heard the unfortunate bungling The Midnight Meat Train recieved concerning its theatrical release. I won't go into detail as that shouldn't pertain to a review of the finished product. I will say however that even after the considerable wait, the stupid release, and the Fear Net showing it as at least nice to have some kind of DVD with at least some special features worth mentioning.In Junior High I was a huge fan of Clive Barker but none more so than with The Midnight Meat Train from the Books of Blood, one of his stories that has stayed with me over the years. I haven't read the story in over twenty years so I can't compare the two works but I will say the movie is good in presenting a fairly cool concept story of two men destined to fight to the death. If you haven't read the story the plot concerns Leon Kaufmann, a photographer who one night looking to get photos of nocturnal city life rescues a girl from a group of thugs as She's getting on a train. The girl of course gets on the train with Mahogany, a killer who is butchering people on certain trains for undisclosed purposes. Leon seeing that the girl has gone missing becomes interested in finding out what happened coming upon Mahogany who in turn starts stalking him. If you read my previous statement concerning the duel to the death then you know how the movie must end.I will admit that the movie isnt the perfect horror film, but then what is. For the first hour or so you have an atmospheric vicious thriller then a plot twist occurs which asks the audience to go in a different direction than a simple slasher film but thats probably something to be left up to the audiences decision. Personally I loved the film for being a decent adaptation of Barkers work and for what Kitamura wrings out of his budget. Say what you will about slick looking productions but the images Kitamura frames from slow motion shots of eyeballs popping out of heads, POV shots from a decapitated victim to a final 360 spin around a moving train car I never actually found myself becoming bored with the trickery. There is even a bit of suspense to be had which seems to pop up less and less for me when I watch a horror film so kudos to the filmmakers for achieving that. Another comment I suppose on the film should be about the use of CGI in the movie. On the commentary Kitamura says He tried heavilly not to rely on too much computer work but it does exist in the film and has drawn a bit of criticsm. Trutfully while its glarinly obvious for some reason I reminded of the same criticsm hurled at Takeshi Kitanos adaptation of Zatoichi with the same feeling from me that oddly I found the bad CGI to be beautiful in a way. Not everyone will think so but thats my opinion.As for the DVD the image and sound quality are great for a standard definition DVD which is good. The extras we're given though are somewhat lacking including a few featurettes on a murder scene in the film, Clive Barker and backstory on Mahogany. What more than makes up for this though is a commentary from both Kitamura and Barker. I don't listen to many commentaries as they can range from banal to interesting to really good. This one thankfully fits in the later as both Barker and Kitamura are chatty through the entire film referencing influences and the way they tried to steer the film. They both share a love of film which shows and in the end discuss the sad state of the films release through Lionsgate which Barker seems to have gotten over- Kitamura still seemed a bit upset in his tone, and in the end thank Guillermo Del Toro who championed a large theatrical release for the film in Mexico.In the end the Disc gets a hearty recommendation from me. It may not be the worlds greatest horror movie but it didn't deserve the fate it recieved.",4,Midnight Meat Train,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,3890,"['doubt', ""'re"", 'fan', 'three', 'things', 'Horror', 'fiction', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Ryuhei', 'Kitamura', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'unfortunate', 'bungling', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'recieved', 'concerning', 'theatrical', 'release', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'should', ""n't"", 'pertain', 'review', 'finished', 'product', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'even', 'considerable', 'wait', 'stupid', 'release', 'Fear', 'Net', 'showing', 'least', 'nice', 'have', 'kind', 'DVD', 'least', 'special', 'features', 'worth', 'mentioning.In', 'Junior', 'High', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'Books', 'Blood', 'one', 'stories', 'stayed', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'story', 'twenty', 'years', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'works', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'good', 'presenting', 'fairly', 'cool', 'concept', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'destined', 'fight', 'death', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'story', 'plot', 'concerns', 'Leon', 'Kaufmann', 'photographer', 'who', 'one', 'night', 'looking', 'get', 'photos', 'nocturnal', 'city', 'life', 'girl', 'group', 'thugs', 'getting', 'train', 'girl', 'course', 'train', 'Mahogany', 'killer', 'who', 'butchering', 'people', 'certain', 'trains', 'undisclosed', 'purposes', 'Leon', 'seeing', 'girl', 'gone', 'missing', 'becomes', 'interested', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'coming', 'Mahogany', 'who', 'turn', 'starts', 'stalking', 'read', 'previous', 'statement', 'concerning', 'duel', 'death', 'then', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'must', 'end.I', 'will', 'admit', 'movie', 'perfect', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'what', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'have', 'atmospheric', 'vicious', 'thriller', 'then', 'plot', 'twist', 'audience', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'simple', 'slasher', 'film', 'thats', 'probably', 'something', 'be', 'left', 'up', 'audiences', 'decision', 'Personally', 'loved', 'film', 'being', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'Barkers', 'work', 'what', 'Kitamura', 'budget', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'slick', 'looking', 'productions', 'images', 'Kitamura', 'frames', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'eyeballs', 'popping', 'heads', 'POV', 'shots', 'decapitated', 'victim', 'final', '360', 'spin', 'moving', 'train', 'car', 'never', 'actually', 'found', 'becoming', 'bored', 'trickery', 'even', 'bit', 'suspense', 'be', 'had', 'pop', 'up', 'less', 'less', 'when', 'watch', 'horror', 'film', 'so', 'kudos', 'filmmakers', 'achieving', 'comment', 'suppose', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'use', 'CGI', 'movie', 'commentary', 'Kitamura', 'tried', 'heavilly', 'not', 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'computer', 'work', 'exist', 'film', 'drawn', 'bit', 'criticsm', 'Trutfully', 'glarinly', 'obvious', 'reason', 'reminded', 'same', 'criticsm', 'hurled', 'Takeshi', 'Kitanos', 'adaptation', 'Zatoichi', 'same', 'feeling', 'oddly', 'found', 'bad', 'CGI', 'be', 'beautiful', 'way', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'think', 'so', 'thats', 'opinion.As', 'DVD', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVD', 'good', 'extras', ""'re"", 'given', 'though', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'including', 'few', 'featurettes', 'murder', 'scene', 'film', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'backstory', 'Mahogany', 'What', 'more', 'up', 'though', 'commentary', 'Kitamura', 'Barker', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'many', 'commentaries', 'can', 'range', 'banal', 'interesting', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'thankfully', 'later', 'Barker', 'Kitamura', 'are', 'chatty', 'entire', 'film', 'referencing', 'influences', 'way', 'tried', 'steer', 'film', 'share', 'love', 'film', 'end', 'sad', 'state', 'films', 'release', 'Lionsgate', 'Barker', 'have', 'gotten', 'over-', 'Kitamura', 'still', 'seemed', 'bit', 'upset', 'tone', 'end', 'thank', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'who', 'championed', 'large', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'Mexico.In', 'end', 'Disc', 'hearty', 'recommendation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'worlds', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'fate', 'recieved']",N/A
1217022,A4O0L1OAJM6I2,B001MFNB4E,C. Lockwood,"[2, 2]","I have been waiting to see this film in what seems like forever. Based on a story from Books Of Blood by Clive Barker, and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Which is an asian director behind Versus, if you like asian fantasy fighting films that one is a great watch. So how could the film possibly go wrong? Lets start with the characters. The main character Bradley Cooper is from movies like Wedding Crashers, He's Just Not That Into You, and Failure To Launch. While those films are not bad, he really should just stick to the romance comedies. He is pretty much a joke when it comes to being taken serious. I didn't hate him, but he lacked in his role. His girlfriend Maya was kind of the same. She is not a terrible actress, but you couldn't make the connection with her. However the main bad guy played by Vinnie Jones, did a wonderful job. He was mean and creepy just like he was supposed to be. Second of all the film itself was inadequate as far as being scary. While it's nice to have lots of blood and gore, it doesn't always mean better. Particularly when a guy is spiraling into madness you should feel for him and be terrified at the realism of the situation. Instead the film went into two different directions. It was sort of like a mix between a Friday The 13th and Session 9. They shorted us on both accounts. While a movie that presents itself in those two ways could and should be fantastic, it just wasn't. I am not a big fan of CGI, but they did pretty good job at not making it so cheesy. The film presented style, some originality, good gore, some tension and a great bad guy, but was missing character development, a whole plot, scares, and basically the direction was lacking in some areas.Leon a New York photographer that is barely getting by with his current job. He soon gets a chance to become something more with being made to take photographs of the city and the people in it. Critized by leaving the scene before anything ever happens, he decides to remain late at night to capture everything on his camera. In the subway he takes pictures of a woman almost getting raped and he stops the gang from hurting her. The next day he sees in the paper that the woman has dissappeared. Trying to show the police the photos and what happened he realizes they do not believe him. So Leon sets out to find the mysteries of the subway and why so many individuals have ended up missing without a trace. He soon discoveries how horrific and unknown life can truly become.With all of the bad and lacking parts of the movie. It still delivers a pretty descent outcome. I enjoyed all of the blood and gore for sure. The bad guy Mahogany is definately who makes the film good. It had some creepy atmosphere to it being in a subway and all.

1217024,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B001MFNB4E,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","I think the biggest question is how this movie would live up to the short story with the same name. I was a huge fan of not only the Midnight Meat Train short story, but The Books of Blood as well. So my expectations were a little high. Ryuhei Kitamura, the director best known for directing the foreign horror film Versus, had the huge task of this being his first American film. So, long story short, my expectations were high since I was a fan of the source material. Needless to say, I wound up being quite pleased with the film.Midnight Meat Train wasn't exactly a scary film, in my eyes. It was more of a bloody, thrill ride to me that just wound up being a lot of fun. The gore in it is really exceptional and Kitamura's cinematography really adds to the film. There's a scene where Mahogany knocks off a woman's head with that mallet he's always carrying around. The cool thing is you see everything from her perspective. You see her putting up her hands as a last defense before the final blow, the room spinning, the camera being on Mahogany and the headless corpse, he lowers his mallet as she blinks a few times, and the camera pans out from her eyeball to show her severed head. The film is just filled with a lot of shots like that that'll wind up catching any viewer's eye.Midnight Meat Train is a gorefest that stays true to its source material and is worth the watch for any fan of Clive Barker's or bloody horror films in general. My biggest worry was the ending staying in tact as I couldn't see how it could be done without terrible CGI or suits that just looked terrible. I don't want to say too much, but I will say this. Nothing was changed and I was completely satisfied with the ending. This is the best horror film I've seen in a long, long time.Rating: 9/10",5,A Ride Any Horror Fan Should Take,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,1784,"['think', 'biggest', 'question', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'live', 'up', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'not', 'only', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'short', 'story', 'Books', 'Blood', 'as', 'well', 'expectations', 'were', 'little', 'high', 'Ryuhei', 'Kitamura', 'director', 'best', 'known', 'directing', 'foreign', 'horror', 'film', 'Versus', 'had', 'huge', 'task', 'being', 'first', 'American', 'film', 'So', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'was', 'fan', 'source', 'material', 'Needless', 'say', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'quite', 'pleased', 'film.Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'scary', 'film', 'eyes', 'was', 'more', 'bloody', 'thrill', 'ride', 'just', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'lot', 'fun', 'gore', 'really', 'exceptional', 'Kitamura', 'cinematography', 'really', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Mahogany', 'off', 'woman', 'head', 'mallet', 'always', 'carrying', 'around', 'cool', 'thing', 'see', 'everything', 'perspective', 'see', 'putting', 'up', 'hands', 'last', 'defense', 'final', 'blow', 'room', 'spinning', 'camera', 'being', 'Mahogany', 'headless', 'corpse', 'mallet', 'few', 'times', 'camera', 'out', 'eyeball', 'show', 'severed', 'head', 'film', 'just', 'filled', 'lot', 'shots', ""'ll"", 'wind', 'up', 'catching', 'viewer', 'eye.Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'gorefest', 'true', 'source', 'material', 'worth', 'watch', 'fan', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'bloody', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'biggest', 'worry', 'was', 'ending', 'staying', 'tact', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'terrible', 'CGI', 'suits', 'just', 'looked', 'terrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'say', 'Nothing', 'was', 'changed', 'was', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'ending', 'best', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time.Rating', '9/10']",N/A

With constant installments of ""Saw"", the travesty that was ""Hostel"", torture porn, and Asian horror film remakes (I'll admit I liked the new Ring better than the Japanese version), I have had a hard time finding a horror movie that actually grips me. I'm a huge horror movie buff, I love any and all, but I hate the constant disappointment when the scares are cheap or the american remakes seriously ""Americanize"" the films to the point where they lose what made them so atmospheric and scary in their foreign counterparts (I'm referring specifically to ""The Uninvited"", an upcoming remake of the Korean film ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", the highest grossing horror film to ever hit S. Korean theaters). I had read the short story that this movie is based on a few years ago, and when I found out that the movie was being made I was at first a little dubious - mainly because the title seemed to be so off-putting, worse on a movie screen than it was for the short story. But it never came to my city, so I never was able to see it. When I was home for the holidays where there is a cable box it was offered for free on demand by [...], so I decided to watch it. And... I loved it. The film was perfectly grainy, the suspense was built well, and the gore had a reason for being there - it wasn't just thrown in Hostel style. Though I had read the short story I was glued to the screen, finding that I actually cared for the protagonist (played by Bradley Cooper) and whatever secret the ""Meat Train"" was hiding. His acting was something to write home about. But the cinematography, the sound effects, even the visual effects, were all amazing. I can't wait until February when I can buy this on DVD.

1217026,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B001MFNB4E,David Girod,"[2, 2]","I remember reading this Clive Barker story years ago, but somehow got it tangled up in my mind with another subway horror tale called ""The Light at the End"". What is it about Subways that make them such a great horror setting? I've rarely ridden on a subway, living in a rural part of America, I would actually have to drive a considerable distance to ride a subway, actually the drive to the station would make the train ride pointless. Still I'm fascinated by films set in and around subways. Maybe it's because they roll around underground through those long dark tunnels, but films and novels set in and around subways and the tunnels have also struck a chord with me. ""The Warriors"" cruising to Coney, the subway attack in ""An American Werewolf in London"", the original ""Taking of Pelham 1-2-3"", getting pinned in the subway car at the end of ""Mimic"", hell the only memorable scene in that flick ""The Church"" occured underground with the subway car splattering that dude like a bug on the windsheild. So yes for some reason subways in films have always struck a chord with me.Well welcome to THE subway horror film. ""The Midnight Meat Train"" was simply fantastic. The basic plot is that a freelance crime photographer gets the chance to showcase some of his photographic artwork, if he can capture the ""heart"" of the city on film. The photography journeys out into the night looking to capture the city at it's most raw....and finds it with a mysterious and sinister butcher that he becomes obsessed with.The gore and special effects are top notch, this is definately not a movie for the squeemish. The blood flows freely, but it's not gratuitous. Ryuhei Kitamura's direction is AMAZING. Some of the point-of-veiw shots from the victims' perspective are mind-blowing, the lighting is extremely eerie, almost as if the entire film were lit with the blue lighting found in butcher freezers or deli-counters. The film is very raw as well, you can almost smell the blood onscreen.If you want something original, not a remake or ""re-imagining"", give this movie a try.",4,A Fun and Bloody Ride,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2067,"['remember', 'reading', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'story', 'years', 'ago', 'somehow', 'got', 'tangled', 'up', 'mind', 'subway', 'horror', 'tale', 'called', 'Light', 'End', 'What', 'make', 'great', 'horror', 'setting', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'ridden', 'subway', 'living', 'rural', 'part', 'America', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'drive', 'considerable', 'distance', 'ride', 'subway', 'actually', 'drive', 'station', 'would', 'make', 'train', 'ride', 'pointless', 'Still', ""'m"", 'fascinated', 'films', 'set', 'subways', 'Maybe', 'roll', 'around', 'underground', 'long', 'dark', 'tunnels', 'films', 'novels', 'set', 'subways', 'tunnels', 'have', 'also', 'struck', 'chord', 'Warriors', 'cruising', 'Coney', 'subway', 'attack', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'London', 'original', 'Taking', 'Pelham', '1-2-3', 'getting', 'pinned', 'subway', 'car', 'end', 'Mimic', 'hell', 'only', 'memorable', 'scene', 'flick', 'Church', 'occured', 'subway', 'car', 'splattering', 'dude', 'bug', 'windsheild', 'yes', 'reason', 'subways', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'struck', 'chord', 'me.Well', 'welcome', 'THE', 'subway', 'horror', 'film', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'was', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'basic', 'plot', 'freelance', 'crime', 'photographer', 'chance', 'showcase', 'photographic', 'artwork', 'can', 'capture', 'heart', 'city', 'film', 'photography', 'journeys', 'night', 'looking', 'capture', 'city', 'most', 'raw', '.and', 'mysterious', 'sinister', 'butcher', 'obsessed', 'with.The', 'gore', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'definately', 'not', 'movie', 'squeemish', 'blood', 'freely', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'Ryuhei', 'Kitamura', 'direction', 'AMAZING', 'point-of-veiw', 'shots', 'victims', 'perspective', 'are', 'mind-blowing', 'lighting', 'extremely', 'eerie', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'were', 'lit', 'blue', 'lighting', 'found', 'butcher', 'freezers', 'deli-counters', 'film', 'very', 'raw', 'well', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'blood', 'onscreen.If', 'want', 'something', 'original', 'not', 'remake', 're-imagining', 'give', 'movie', 'try']",N/A
1217027,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B001MFNB4E,David J. Brown,"[1, 2]","Okay, let me admit up front that I'm a huge fan of Clive Barker's written work and his paintings.  I enjoyed his first two Hellraiser films and I loved Bernard Rose's brilliant adaption of Candyman, and I do have a soft spot for Nightbreed(Cabal is probably my favorite Barker story).  Midnight Meat Train is one of his better and most odd, funny, creepy, and truly original stories from his Books Of Blood vol. 1.  I've been hoping for an adaption of this story forever!  Well, here it is and I got my wish...Well, not entirely.  Sure, changes were made from the original text,but all were sensible and smart based on the obviously visual nature of films.  Our hero, so to speak, is no longer an loner accountant, but a photographer on the hunt for the real city, the dark heart of the big city.  The film has also given Leon a girlfriend, a very close and beautiful relationship of support.  Basically, instead of starting with a completely dark man who goes further we get a man hungry for success and suppressing his darkness.  And of course if you know your horror then you know what part of his personality will take over his life and cause problems for all around him.  All good stuff and appropriate changes.So what's my beef with this film?  Well, it's poorly directed over-the-top to the point that it's no longer scary but rather funny, silly, and totally void of supsnse.  All the train murders use heavy CGI effects to  perform trick shots that wouldn't be possible without them, and it totally takes you out of the film.  Instead of being shocking or gross it just comes off as a nifty demo real for a future visual effects artist.  Not good in horror.  Horror doesn't need good, great or any in-your-face special effects to work.  There's a fight at the end of the film where the camera zips out of the train car and around to the other side, in and out of the windows like a low rent Matrix clone.  Why is this in my horror film?  It might sound slight to you, but this really takes some of the terror out of scenes that depict something terrible in a 'KEWL' way.  I don't want to be awed by death, I want it to bother me and make me uncomfortable and, well...um, HORRIFIED!  The bottom line, is that Barker's tale is already an over-the-top, screwy and weird tale with a larger Lovecraftian mythology at its core and a more stark, down-to-earth and gritty style would have been more applicable for this film.On the plus side the acting is all good and convincing.  You do care about the main two protagonists.  Sure, a more subtle director would have eased Leon's obssession with darkness on the audience instead of sledgehammering it to us like he was Mohageny himself(the villain of said midnight meat train).  Barker's forementioned Lovecraftian mythology is in tact, which less daring producers and screenwriters would have totally removed from this film adaption.  Plus, it's left thankfully ambiguous.  I can't stand that American metnality to over explain the supernatural.  This film leaves it in the dark and in the unknown where it belongs.  Vinnie Jones is perfect as Mohageny.  Can't think of anyone better to come off as imposing and who could do more with simple body language and stares.Basically, the screenwriter did right by Barker, but failed by an overzealous visual director, and by Barker himself who was one of the film's producers.  This film may work more for some....",3,"Good story to film translation, but unfortunately over-directed at every turn.",1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,3410,"['Okay', 'let', 'admit', 'up', 'front', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'written', 'work', 'paintings', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'two', 'Hellraiser', 'films', 'loved', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'brilliant', 'adaption', 'Candyman', 'do', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Nightbreed', 'Cabal', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Barker', 'story', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'one', 'better', 'most', 'odd', 'funny', 'creepy', 'truly', 'original', 'stories', 'Books', 'Blood', 'vol', '1', ""'ve"", 'been', 'hoping', 'adaption', 'story', 'forever', 'Well', 'here', 'got', 'wish', 'Well', 'not', 'entirely', 'Sure', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'original', 'text', 'were', 'sensible', 'smart', 'based', 'obviously', 'visual', 'nature', 'films', 'hero', 'so', 'speak', 'no', 'longer', 'loner', 'accountant', 'photographer', 'hunt', 'real', 'city', 'dark', 'heart', 'big', 'city', 'film', 'also', 'given', 'Leon', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'close', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'support', 'Basically', 'instead', 'starting', 'completely', 'dark', 'man', 'who', 'further', 'get', 'man', 'hungry', 'success', 'suppressing', 'darkness', 'course', 'know', 'horror', 'then', 'know', 'what', 'part', 'personality', 'will', 'take', 'over', 'life', 'cause', 'problems', 'good', 'stuff', 'appropriate', 'changes.So', 'what', 'beef', 'film', 'Well', 'poorly', 'directed', 'over-the-top', 'point', 'longer', 'scary', 'rather', 'funny', 'silly', 'totally', 'void', 'supsnse', 'train', 'murders', 'use', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'effects', 'perform', 'trick', 'shots', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'possible', 'totally', 'film', 'Instead', 'being', 'shocking', 'gross', 'just', 'off', 'nifty', 'demo', 'real', 'future', 'visual', 'effects', 'artist', 'Not', 'good', 'horror', 'Horror', ""n't"", 'need', 'good', 'great', 'in-your-face', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'fight', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'camera', 'train', 'car', 'other', 'side', 'windows', 'low', 'rent', 'Matrix', 'clone', 'Why', 'horror', 'film', 'might', 'sound', 'slight', 'really', 'terror', 'scenes', 'depict', 'something', 'terrible', ""'KEWL"", 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'awed', 'death', 'want', 'bother', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'well', 'um', 'HORRIFIED', 'bottom', 'line', 'Barker', 'tale', 'already', 'over-the-top', 'screwy', 'weird', 'tale', 'larger', 'Lovecraftian', 'mythology', 'core', 'more', 'stark', 'down-to-earth', 'gritty', 'style', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'applicable', 'plus', 'side', 'acting', 'good', 'convincing', 'do', 'care', 'main', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Sure', 'more', 'subtle', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'eased', 'Leon', 'obssession', 'darkness', 'audience', 'instead', 'sledgehammering', 'was', 'Mohageny', 'villain', 'said', 'midnight', 'meat', 'train', 'Barker', 'forementioned', 'Lovecraftian', 'mythology', 'tact', 'less', 'daring', 'producers', 'screenwriters', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'removed', 'film', 'adaption', 'left', 'thankfully', 'ambiguous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'American', 'metnality', 'explain', 'supernatural', 'film', 'dark', 'unknown', 'where', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'perfect', 'Mohageny', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'better', 'come', 'off', 'imposing', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'more', 'simple', 'body', 'language', 'stares.Basically', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'right', 'Barker', 'failed', 'overzealous', 'visual', 'director', 'Barker', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'film', 'producers', 'film', 'may', 'work', 'more']",N/A

1217031,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B001MFNB4E,Edmonson,"[1, 1]","""The Midnight Meat Train"" is directed by Ryuchei Kitamuri. What struck me initially with this film was how beautifully produced, directed, and lighted it is. Each and every frame is exquisite, and I found myself watching with fascination as each sequence of events unfolded. Anyone who enjoys the paintings of Francis Bacon might find this film particularly enjoyable.Initially we are introduced to Leon (Bradley Cooper) who is a photographer looking to enter the art world. He's looking for those special, one of a kind photos of riveting moments. This leads him to take more and more chances in the subways photographing often dangerous confrontations. By chance he photographs a man, Mahogany (Vinne Jones), who appeared around the time he saw a woman who was later murdered. He thinks there might be a connection, and begins to follow this strange man who waits in the the subway and then boards the trains at a specific time every night.One night Leon goes too far and boards the train with Mahogany and discovers the dreadful secret of the murders. This story seems flawed though. Leon is spared, but why? We're told by the train driver that Mahogany is no longer able to do the job, though he seemed to be doing a commendable job right up until he met Leon. The transformation of Leon to murderer seems unbelievable, but it does add an interesting twist to the story nonetheless. There are other aspects of the story that seem to come out of nowhere for dramatic effect, such as the beasts that are fed these corpses. What are these creatures, and where do they come from, and how have they managed to stay hidden from the general public for so long? Why do they have to enlist a man in order to do the murders. Why is the train driver and other humans working for these creatures? Who is the train driver? The ending leaves more questions than answers, but the ride is nevertheless thrilling and fascinating to watch.",4,A dark secret beneath the surface...,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,1925,"['Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'directed', 'Ryuchei', 'Kitamuri', 'What', 'struck', 'initially', 'film', 'was', 'how', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'directed', 'lighted', 'frame', 'exquisite', 'found', 'watching', 'fascination', 'sequence', 'events', 'unfolded', 'Anyone', 'who', 'paintings', 'Francis', 'Bacon', 'might', 'find', 'film', 'particularly', 'enjoyable.Initially', 'are', 'introduced', 'Leon', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'who', 'photographer', 'looking', 'enter', 'art', 'world', 'looking', 'special', 'one', 'kind', 'photos', 'riveting', 'moments', 'take', 'more', 'more', 'chances', 'subways', 'photographing', 'often', 'dangerous', 'confrontations', 'chance', 'man', 'Mahogany', 'Vinne', 'Jones', 'who', 'appeared', 'time', 'saw', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'later', 'murdered', 'might', 'be', 'connection', 'follow', 'strange', 'man', 'who', 'subway', 'then', 'boards', 'trains', 'specific', 'time', 'night.One', 'night', 'Leon', 'too', 'far', 'boards', 'train', 'Mahogany', 'dreadful', 'secret', 'murders', 'story', 'flawed', 'Leon', 'spared', 'why', ""'re"", 'told', 'train', 'driver', 'Mahogany', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'do', 'job', 'seemed', 'be', 'doing', 'commendable', 'job', 'right', 'up', 'met', 'Leon', 'transformation', 'Leon', 'murderer', 'unbelievable', 'add', 'interesting', 'twist', 'story', 'nonetheless', 'are', 'other', 'aspects', 'story', 'seem', 'come', 'nowhere', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'such', 'beasts', 'are', 'fed', 'corpses', 'What', 'are', 'creatures', 'where', 'do', 'come', 'how', 'have', 'managed', 'stay', 'hidden', 'general', 'public', 'so', 'long', 'Why', 'do', 'have', 'enlist', 'man', 'order', 'do', 'murders', 'Why', 'train', 'driver', 'other', 'humans', 'working', 'creatures', 'Who', 'train', 'driver', 'ending', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'ride', 'nevertheless', 'thrilling', 'fascinating', 'watch']",N/A

1217033,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B001MFNB4E,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 3]","THE MIDNIGHTMEAT TRAINThere were two reasons for me to get this movie when it came out, well there were many but the two big ones were that it is a Clive Barker film and Ted Raimi is in it [not for long]. I have always been a fan of Barker's from his writing to his films I enjoy the man's work, same can be said for Mr. Raimi who I think is one of the most underused and underrated actors of all time. Any way the time came for this movie to be released and I could not have been happier I mean with a name like that how could you not want to see it. The end product is some what disappointing but it is not as bad as some say, I think it is good at least for a rental.For those who don't know this film isn't so much about the train and the murders being committed on it as it is about a man's obsession to look into it more a find ""the truth"". The film follows a photographer who one night when looking for something to shoot he comes across a young woman that is being robbed. After doing the responsible thing of taking pictures of the event he steps in to help, nice guy I guess. After helping her out he notices a big guy lurking around on the train, the girl is never seen again. He takes his pictures and story and tries to run with it, he may be onto something. He starts to follow the man thinking that he may have had something to do with it and it turns out one night when he gets on the train he was very right. Aside from a close encounter at the meat factory he is now witnessing first hand what this man is all about. So the film follows this pattern from this point on the man after the killer and vice versa.Director Ryhei Kitamura who is very well known for his films like Azumi, Aragami, Versus, and Godzilla: Final Wars does a great job keeping the film moving and as usual his expertise with the camera and editing shows through out the entire film. This is actually both an advantage to the film as well as a flaw, I know it doesn't make sense as of yet. The deal is this film is very stylized and that makes the film look really good and clear with some nice effects like eyes popping out and such. But that also takes away from what could have been a really creepy film, don't get me wrong it has its moments but over all this is just a good looking Slasher flick [at least until the end, wow]. Still if you were not expecting this to be as creepy as the short story then this is an excellent film.Vinnie Jones was cast perfectly as the killer on the train who smashes people's heads in once the train goes off track. He is tall strong and very creepy looking in that suit with that weird attitude he has got going on. Bradley Cooper did a good job as Leon the obsessive photographer who just can't leave it alone, he gets what he deserves.  Leslie Bibb and Brooke Shields each turn in good performances as did the great Ted Raimi for the very limited amount of time he was on screen. The dude who played the train driver was great as well and rivaled Vinnie as creepiest character.Screen writer Jeff Buhler did a good job adapting the short story into a feature length film, he added a lot to it. Still it feels like something is missing maybe in the dialogue department or something but something is a miss. Still Mr. Barker gave his seal of approval as they discus with each other on the excellent commentary track for the film. But this is a good enough film that most will enjoy, watch for that ending though, some may not see it coming",4,STYLIZED SLASHER PICK BASED ON BARKER-TED RAIMI,1236297600,"03 6, 2009",2009,3467,"['MIDNIGHTMEAT', 'TRAINThere', 'were', 'two', 'reasons', 'get', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'well', 'were', 'many', 'two', 'big', 'ones', 'were', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'film', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'not', 'long', ']', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Barker', 'writing', 'films', 'enjoy', 'man', 'work', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Mr.', 'Raimi', 'who', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'underused', 'underrated', 'actors', 'time', 'way', 'time', 'came', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'mean', 'name', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'product', 'what', 'disappointing', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'think', 'good', 'least', 'rental.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'train', 'murders', 'being', 'committed', 'man', 'obsession', 'look', 'more', 'find', 'truth', 'film', 'photographer', 'who', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'looking', 'something', 'shoot', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'robbed', 'doing', 'responsible', 'thing', 'taking', 'pictures', 'event', 'help', 'nice', 'guy', 'guess', 'helping', 'big', 'guy', 'lurking', 'around', 'train', 'girl', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'pictures', 'story', 'tries', 'run', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'follow', 'man', 'thinking', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'out', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'train', 'was', 'very', 'right', 'Aside', 'close', 'encounter', 'meat', 'factory', 'now', 'witnessing', 'first', 'hand', 'what', 'man', 'about', 'film', 'pattern', 'point', 'man', 'killer', 'vice', 'versa.Director', 'Ryhei', 'Kitamura', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'films', 'Azumi', 'Aragami', 'Versus', 'Godzilla', 'Final', 'Wars', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'film', 'moving', 'usual', 'expertise', 'camera', 'editing', 'shows', 'entire', 'film', 'actually', 'advantage', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'flaw', 'know', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'yet', 'deal', 'film', 'very', 'stylized', 'film', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'clear', 'nice', 'effects', 'eyes', 'popping', 'out', 'such', 'also', 'away', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'creepy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'moments', 'just', 'good', 'looking', 'Slasher', 'flick', '[', 'least', 'end', 'wow', ']', 'Still', 'were', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'as', 'creepy', 'short', 'story', 'then', 'excellent', 'film.Vinnie', 'Jones', 'was', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'killer', 'train', 'who', 'people', 'heads', 'once', 'train', 'track', 'tall', 'strong', 'very', 'creepy', 'looking', 'suit', 'weird', 'attitude', 'got', 'going', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Leon', 'obsessive', 'photographer', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'what', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'turn', 'good', 'performances', 'did', 'great', 'Ted', 'Raimi', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'dude', 'who', 'played', 'train', 'driver', 'was', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'rivaled', 'Vinnie', 'creepiest', 'character.Screen', 'writer', 'Jeff', 'Buhler', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'adapting', 'short', 'story', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'added', 'lot', 'Still', 'something', 'missing', 'maybe', 'dialogue', 'department', 'something', 'something', 'miss', 'Still', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'gave', 'seal', 'approval', 'discus', 'other', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'film', 'most', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'ending', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'coming']",N/A

Clive Barker's had much better movie adaptations of his work than Stephen King has had.Unfortunately that stops with Midnight Meat train.The beginning is TERRIFIC. The stuff that was added to flesh outClive Barker's short storyworked pretty well. There was a nice cameo by Ted Raimi. But then it gets too convoluted, switches primary characters and falls apart. In the end this movie even manages to bungle the City Fathers.The thing is, the movie had *so much* going for it. It could have been a classic.Atmosphere? Check.Creepy settings? Check.Interesting story? Check.Decent actors? Check. (Well, they're good for a low budget horror film.)Good direction? Usually. The 'action movie' direction (and fight scenes) seem out of place with the horror story and the CGI is pretty cheesy. I wonder what Marcus Nispel who did the respectableTexas Chainsawremake or Alexandre Aja who did the excellentHills Have Eyesremake could have done with this one.Good screenplay? Not so much. Too bad Clive didn't write this script himself. The direction could have been better but was serviceable. It's the screenplay that fails here.

Taking a wild guess here, whatever you'd imagine would probably be close enough to right to tell you if this is the kind of movie for you.If I also tell you that it is inspired by a short story byClive Barker, it would probably clear up any hesitations you might have either way.  I've never read the short story in question, but based on what I saw, I'd imagine it comes close enough to count.The story follows, without a trace of irony, Leon, a photographer (Bradley Cooper, he ofAliasandWedding Crashersfame) who is on the search for a truly artistic photo of The City in which he lives.  When he is introduced to a big player in the Art Scene, he is told that his work shows too much fear to truly capture the heart of The City.  His work, you see, is vivid but meaningless.  This phrase is said almost verbatim.How delightful, then, that the same phrase unabashedly fits the movie in which it is uttered.  Fans of gore will love this thing, as there are several brutal scenes filmed in lush, slo-mo.  The violence is saturated with a winky nod to the CGI that spawns it, and many of the film's most grotesque moments are almost overdone in their swerving, nauseating effectiveness.  If you happen to get off on watching people be dispatched in a subway car streaked and puddled with blood, prepare to be pleased.Too bad that this blood-soaked sensibility is partnered up with the slow and predictable plight of our idealistic photog.  Flaunting his fear, Leon drives further into the scabby underbelly of The City in search of the perfect photo, and when he stumbles upon The Midnight Meat Train, he becomes obsessed with what it must mean.  There's really no trick to figuring out basic elements of the plot, although the ending -- to people unfamiliar with Barker -- might prove stupidly short.My guess is that if THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN had followed to a T the contours of Barker's short story, it would've been a tighter film, although perhaps forty minutes shorter.  Instead, the makers decided to pad out the extra bits with a few pointless chase scenes, some protracted moments of angst, and Leon's urgent search for True Art.  In a film that's all about blood and guts, that poorly placed idealism proves to be the final killing blow.",2,The Killing Blow,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,2380,"['So', 'tell', 'horror', 'movie', 'called', 'THE', 'MIDNIGHT', 'MEAT', 'TRAIN', 'few', 'images', 'expectations', 'might', 'run', 'mind', 'Taking', 'wild', 'guess', 'here', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'close', 'enough', 'right', 'tell', 'kind', 'movie', 'you.If', 'also', 'tell', 'inspired', 'short', 'story', 'byClive', 'Barker', 'would', 'probably', 'clear', 'up', 'hesitations', 'might', 'have', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'short', 'story', 'question', 'based', 'what', 'saw', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'close', 'enough', 'count.The', 'story', 'trace', 'irony', 'Leon', 'photographer', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'ofAliasandWedding', 'Crashersfame', 'who', 'search', 'truly', 'artistic', 'photo', 'City', 'When', 'introduced', 'big', 'player', 'Art', 'Scene', 'told', 'work', 'too', 'much', 'fear', 'truly', 'capture', 'heart', 'City', 'work', 'see', 'vivid', 'meaningless', 'phrase', 'said', 'almost', 'verbatim.How', 'delightful', 'then', 'same', 'phrase', 'unabashedly', 'movie', 'uttered', 'Fans', 'gore', 'will', 'love', 'thing', 'are', 'several', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'lush', 'slo-mo', 'violence', 'saturated', 'winky', 'nod', 'CGI', 'many', 'film', 'most', 'grotesque', 'moments', 'are', 'almost', 'overdone', 'swerving', 'nauseating', 'effectiveness', 'happen', 'get', 'off', 'watching', 'people', 'be', 'dispatched', 'subway', 'car', 'streaked', 'puddled', 'blood', 'prepare', 'be', 'pleased.Too', 'bad', 'blood-soaked', 'sensibility', 'partnered', 'up', 'slow', 'predictable', 'plight', 'idealistic', 'photog', 'Flaunting', 'fear', 'Leon', 'further', 'scabby', 'underbelly', 'City', 'search', 'perfect', 'photo', 'when', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'obsessed', 'what', 'must', 'mean', 'really', 'trick', 'figuring', 'out', 'basic', 'elements', 'plot', 'ending', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'Barker', 'might', 'prove', 'stupidly', 'short.My', 'guess', 'MIDNIGHT', 'MEAT', 'TRAIN', 'had', 'followed', 'T', 'contours', 'Barker', 'short', 'story', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tighter', 'film', 'perhaps', 'forty', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'Instead', 'makers', 'decided', 'pad', 'out', 'extra', 'bits', 'few', 'pointless', 'chase', 'scenes', 'protracted', 'moments', 'angst', 'Leon', 'urgent', 'search', 'True', 'Art', 'film', 'blood', 'guts', 'poorly', 'placed', 'idealism', 'be', 'final', 'killing', 'blow']",N/A
1217051,A17BUUBOU0598B,B001MFNB4E,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","The Midnight Meat Train [Theatrical Release] is a surprisingly effective horror movie.  It really deserved a better title, better marketing and a better fate.  It can best be described as a *slasher* movie, but it blends in a lot of other styles.  I normally am very picky with slasher movies.  But this movie is filmed very well and has interesting characters.The film is shot in a dark shadowy way.  Most of the scenes take place on a subway train, covered in clean chromed metal.  In an older theatre or on a regular TV it may be difficult to see all the nuances due to this dark palette.  But watch this on a high quality TV with the lights out and you will see how well shot this is. I can only imagine how good this will look in an up-converted DVD or high definition.The darkness is clearly used to set an ominous mood.  During many of the kill sequences, we see tons of technical details from reflections in blood to panoramic floating shots.  Based upon the resources that they had to work with, this film is a technical achievement that they should be proud of.Bradley Cooper is probably best known for his role as the jerk boyfriend inWedding Crashers.  Here he is very well cast in the lead role of Leon, a photographer trying to break into the art world.  He helps a woman while shooting in the subway late at night, and is intrigued when she ends up missing.  Eventually he discovers Mahogany, played by Vinnie Jones.  He is also well cast as the silent imposing killer.  He's probably most memorable for his silent role as Sphinx inGone in 60 Seconds.  Here again he is mostly without lines, but the close ups and his harsh cold stares are enough to communicate plenty.Leon soon becomes obsessed with following Mahogany and finding out what he is up to and why he is doing it.  We see his obsession slowly changing him, and it also affects his relationship with his girlfriend, played by Leslie Bibb ofIron Man.The story has many predictable turns and a violent ending with a few curveballs thrown in.  While I'm not crazy about the ending, the movie is executed so well that it mostly overcomes the predictable story line and emphasis on gore.  You also get the voyeuristic pleasure of watching our protagonist as he follows the killer hoping to learn more about him and catch a great picture in the process.Granted there were a few things I would have changed with the movie.  I personally would have dropped the opening sequence, though it's not bad.  So much of the pleasure is in watching the main character *discover* more about the killer.  The opening sequence kind of desensitizes you to that.  Several aspects to the ending are also not as good as they could have been, but you'll have to see it to know what I mean about that.  In context though, those are minor complaints.ConclusionDespite the flaws, this is an entertaining movie that is worth watching. Perhaps the recent string of stinkers I have seen has made me a little more lenient on this movie.

1217052,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B001MFNB4E,Matthew King,"[4, 4]","For fans of horror literature, the origins of Midnight Meat Train are well known.  Included in the ""Books of Blood"" collection, it has long been a favorite amongst Clive Barker's many fans.  Despite being a classic, not many (myself included) would have expected a film adaptation of this, the reason being the entire short story takes place in a subway train and well, how could you make a movie of this?  Well it is here and Ryuhei Kitamura, a cult director from Japan known for over-the-top films like ""Versus"", has done an admirable job of adapting Barker's story to film format.In a large unnamed American city, midnight subway commuters are being slaughtered by a strange, mute, imposing figure with a cleaver.  He is somehow able to carry on his deeds without the police or anyone noticing as his victims' bodies are promptly disposed of and are usually reported as ""disappearances"" in the media.  That is until the killer catches the attention of a young photographer who likes to shoot strange, disturbing urban landscapes.  The photographer will soon realize that his intrusions could cost him a lot more than just his job.  Much, much more...This film starts off very strange, with a definite aura of mystique to it.  Why is nobody noticing the killings?  Who is this enigmatic killer, and what are his motives?  It takes a while, but these things do eventually get unraveled.  Throughout the film, there are some very powerful suspense scenes, and not all in the train either.  As a matter of fact, most of the film takes place outside of the subway station, which is somewhat of a relief because otherwise it probably would have a stretched a thin concept a little too far.  The subway scenes themselves are expertly done, maximizing the sense of claustrophobia: where can you go, or possibly hide, inside a subway car?As for the gore, it is extremely graphic and gratuitous, almost to the point of being comical, but those who have seen Kitamura's other films would expect no less from him.  Although my star rating might seem a little low, I do think ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a good horror film.  What it came down to for me is that it was a rather unpleasant viewing experience because of how dark, grimy, despairing and without hope it is.  I realize this is probably what the director was going for though.  A good renter, and certainly one of the better Barker film adaptations, which I would rank third right behind Hellraiser and Candyman.",3,Punishing and bleak,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2460,"['fans', 'horror', 'literature', 'origins', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'Included', 'Books', 'Blood', 'collection', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'amongst', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'many', 'fans', 'being', 'classic', 'not', 'many', 'included', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'film', 'adaptation', 'reason', 'being', 'entire', 'short', 'story', 'place', 'subway', 'train', 'well', 'how', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'Well', 'here', 'Ryuhei', 'Kitamura', 'cult', 'director', 'Japan', 'known', 'over-the-top', 'films', 'Versus', 'done', 'admirable', 'job', 'adapting', 'Barker', 'story', 'film', 'format.In', 'large', 'unnamed', 'American', 'city', 'midnight', 'subway', 'commuters', 'are', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'strange', 'mute', 'imposing', 'figure', 'cleaver', 'somehow', 'able', 'carry', 'deeds', 'police', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'victims', 'bodies', 'are', 'promptly', 'disposed', 'are', 'usually', 'reported', 'disappearances', 'media', 'killer', 'attention', 'young', 'photographer', 'who', 'shoot', 'strange', 'disturbing', 'urban', 'landscapes', 'photographer', 'will', 'soon', 'realize', 'intrusions', 'could', 'cost', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'job', 'Much', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'off', 'very', 'strange', 'definite', 'aura', 'mystique', 'Why', 'nobody', 'noticing', 'killings', 'Who', 'enigmatic', 'killer', 'are', 'motives', 'while', 'things', 'do', 'eventually', 'get', 'unraveled', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'suspense', 'scenes', 'not', 'train', 'either', 'matter', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'place', 'subway', 'station', 'somewhat', 'relief', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'stretched', 'thin', 'concept', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'subway', 'scenes', 'are', 'expertly', 'done', 'maximizing', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'possibly', 'hide', 'subway', 'car', 'gore', 'extremely', 'graphic', 'gratuitous', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'comical', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Kitamura', 'other', 'films', 'would', 'expect', 'less', 'star', 'rating', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'low', 'do', 'think', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'What', 'came', 'down', 'was', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'viewing', 'experience', 'how', 'dark', 'grimy', 'despairing', 'hope', 'realize', 'probably', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'good', 'renter', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'Barker', 'film', 'adaptations', 'would', 'rank', 'third', 'right', 'Hellraiser', 'Candyman']",N/A

Sad.Clive Barker is one of the best writers of our generation, and his work deserves better attention than it gets. This one, produced by Barker (along with the upcoming ""book of blood"" -- look of it) was the first in what he hopped would be a 2 film / year adaptation of his books of blood stories. Previous adaptations include the b-movie monster yawn Rawhead Rex, Candyman and Barker's own Lord of Illusions (based on elements of ""the last illusion"")The Midnight Meat Train reminds us of Barker's Hellraiser days, in a good way. While the plot is similar to Candyman -- person stumbles upon murder / urban legend, find out it's real and tries to fight it while being sucked in by it -- this is not Candyman.For one, it's beyond gory and not in the ultra-glitzy Hollywood horror way. Which explains the limited release, Hollywood doesn't like independents, that's why they keep buying up small studios. But Barker was tired of Hollywood telling him how to make films and limiting him or cutting huge chunks out (see: Nightbreed). So this is Barker against the systemSynopsis: Photographer witness brutal subway murders, investigates while trying to promote career by taking sordid photographs of crime and debauchery, but feels a need to act, only to find himself sucked in.The movie is fresh, different and worth the time for real horror fans. The character arch is a little hard to swallow, but that's the only real flaw.A good, solid, blood splattering of a horror flick by one of the genres greatest minds.

1217055,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B001MFNB4E,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","Clive Barker must be a vegetarian.How else to explain the fact that villain Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) in Midnight Meat Train is a butcher of livestock by day, butcher of men by night?If Midnight Meat Train was merely about killing people, it would be another long entry in lame murder movies like Terror Train.  But it's actually about voyeurism - how we the audience can't tear our eyes away from gore - and director Ryhei Kitamura pounds that point home with a mallet.Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a budding photographer trying to capture the spirit of the city.  But art patron Susan Hoff (Brooke Shields, all severe curves) pushes for more - more visceral, more dangerous, more real. She doesn't want the anticipation of the moment, she wants to SEE the moment - in the same way modern horror movies now shower us with gore that was hinted at in older films.  Hoff wants less PG-13 and more hard R.And she gets it when Leon discovers a terrible secret in Mahogany. Changing clothes from his butcher apron to a suit and tie, the blue-collar master of meat becomes a white-collar killing machine.  You can dress up a killer, Barker seems to say, but he's still a killer.  All the while Leon clicks away with his camera, drawn into a cesspool of death and sacrifice.The gore is inventively shot, which results in the occasionally goofy kill (see Ted Raimi's eyeball fly at the camera!).  The movie is relentlessly dreary with its blue lens, which is a bit (pardon the pun) overkill. If Se7en has taught us anything it's that all beautiful things in blue-lensed movies must suffer, so its no surprise when that's precisely what happens to just about everyone involved.But Midnight Meat Train is something different. I'm not fond of films based on Barker's work, including the bookend to his series of short stories, The Book of Blood.  Midnight Meat Train is actually a retelling of H.P. Lovecraft's Pickman's Model, and that it manages to end with a punch worthy of Lovecraft is high praise indeed.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 0]","Clive Barker adaptations being good are a dime a dozen, which is why I didn't look too forward to The Midnight Meat Train, especially after Lion's Gate quietly dumped it into discount theaters before disappearing and recently premiering on FearNet.  Upon viewing however, The Midnight Meat Train proves to be surprisingly good, and is definitely the best Barker adaptation since Barker adapted his own work with the original Hellraiser.  Bradley Cooper stars as Leon, an up and coming photographer who inadvertantly ends up discovering a murderer dubbed Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) that travels via subway, and slaughters his victims like cattle.  As Leon learns more, his following of Mahogany becomes an obsession that is slowly changing him, and frightening his suffering girlfriend (Iron Man's Leslie Bibb).  This all eventually leads to a bloody showdown, and an ending that is simply dynamite.  The performances are solid (Jones is actually surprisingly scary) and the gore is aplenty, and the overall tone of the film retains the spirit of many of Barker's best works.  The only real flaws with The Midnight Meat Train lie within some of the gore effects.  A number of them suffer from the fact that they are obviously CGI-based, meaning sometimes they just look laughably fake.  Besides this however, The Midnight Meat Train is a surprisingly good and frightening ride that will definitely hold your interest, and is a film that deserved a better fate than what Lion's Gate gave it, and will hopefully find a deserved following now that it's making it's way to DVD.",4,Surprisingly good,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,1569,"['Clive', 'Barker', 'adaptations', 'being', 'good', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'forward', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'especially', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'quietly', 'dumped', 'discount', 'theaters', 'disappearing', 'recently', 'premiering', 'FearNet', 'viewing', 'however', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'definitely', 'best', 'Barker', 'adaptation', 'Barker', 'adapted', 'own', 'work', 'original', 'Hellraiser', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Leon', 'up', 'coming', 'photographer', 'who', 'inadvertantly', 'up', 'discovering', 'murderer', 'dubbed', 'Mahogany', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'subway', 'slaughters', 'victims', 'cattle', 'Leon', 'more', 'following', 'Mahogany', 'obsession', 'slowly', 'changing', 'frightening', 'suffering', 'girlfriend', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'eventually', 'bloody', 'showdown', 'ending', 'simply', 'dynamite', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'Jones', 'actually', 'surprisingly', 'scary', 'gore', 'aplenty', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'spirit', 'many', 'Barker', 'best', 'works', 'only', 'real', 'flaws', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'lie', 'gore', 'effects', 'number', 'suffer', 'fact', 'are', 'obviously', 'CGI-based', 'meaning', 'sometimes', 'just', 'look', 'laughably', 'fake', 'however', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'frightening', 'ride', 'will', 'definitely', 'hold', 'interest', 'film', 'deserved', 'better', 'fate', 'what', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'gave', 'will', 'hopefully', 'find', 'deserved', 'following', 'now', 'making', 'way', 'DVD']",N/A
1217061,A14GUG0O427F5U,B001MFNB4E,Nikki,"[2, 3]","I started this movie only because it reminded me of a book, ""Acceleration"", that was about a boy who discovers the existence of a serial killer on the subway and has to wrestle with his own mind about what to do.  Sounds familiar right?  Well I figured ""The Midnight Meat Train"" couldn't be that bad since I liked the book's story.  In that department, for me at least, the movie was a hit and miss.I'll start with the pros and that was the first half (NOT including the bloody beginning intro scene).  The main character, Leon, is a photographer and has prospects to sell his photos to a high to-do art lady.  She poo-poos on his latest work and says that Leon was just too late in trying to capture ""the heart of the city"" on film.  So he accepts her challenge and decides to work the city AT NIGHT BY HIMSELF.  Long story short he captures a mugging/rape moment before stepping in and thus gets wrapped up in the underground subway murders by tracking a butcher throughout the city.What I liked about this first part was, ironically, the camera shots and scene setups.  The pace of the first half is actually really slow with Leon walking carefull through each scene like a photographer looking at the world.  To amplify this idea all the shots are stunning, as if the movie is 'capturing the heart of the city' through Leon's actions.  My favorite shot has got to be the subway's escalators that seem to pop up like some sci-fi alien before the audience can figure out what they are.  The music is so subtle that I could just solely focus on the scenery that was filled with eye candy such as shadows and long shots of buildings.  The best eye candy had to be when Leon gets back from the subway train and is just standing in the middle of the meat plant.  While the camera's focused on him a worker is in the background slowly counting hanging meat hooks that sound in time with the quiet sounds of the music.  Pure horror beauty (if such a thing exists).Now unfortunately onto the cons, which is the story and second half of the movie.  By the second half the director apparently figured out the viewers needed a little more substance than just pretty shots.  Instead of a proper escalation of the psychology battle, we get extremely intense blood sequences.  Now even I was a little squeamish during some of these scenes.  I don't know too much about anatomy, but a human can't possible get bloody as quickly as this movie depicted.  Blood by the buckets was literally thrown across the train floor.  I have a hard time believing that the killer and his cohorts were able to clean all of it for every morning.Speaking of cohorts, I had a big problem with the final plot.  I won't be a spoiler, but what seems as an intense psychological showdown between two people turns into this conspiracy thing...just didn't work with the great pacing of the first half.All in all I guess I didn't mind the movie that much.  I think the amount of gore was unnecessary and even cheapened what the director had going for him in the beginning.  This movie isn't for everyone, but I at least found something interesting about it.",3,Sci-fi camera shots bloodied with iffy plot and extreme gore,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,3119,"['started', 'movie', 'only', 'reminded', 'book', 'Acceleration', 'was', 'boy', 'who', 'existence', 'serial', 'killer', 'subway', 'wrestle', 'own', 'mind', 'what', 'do', 'Sounds', 'familiar', 'right', 'Well', 'figured', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'liked', 'book', 'story', 'department', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'hit', 'miss.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'pros', 'was', 'first', 'half', 'NOT', 'including', 'bloody', 'beginning', 'intro', 'scene', 'main', 'character', 'Leon', 'photographer', 'prospects', 'sell', 'photos', 'high', 'to-do', 'art', 'lady', 'poo-poos', 'latest', 'work', 'Leon', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'late', 'trying', 'capture', 'heart', 'city', 'film', 'challenge', 'decides', 'work', 'city', 'AT', 'NIGHT', 'BY', 'HIMSELF', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'mugging/rape', 'moment', 'stepping', 'thus', 'wrapped', 'up', 'underground', 'subway', 'murders', 'tracking', 'butcher', 'city.What', 'liked', 'first', 'part', 'was', 'ironically', 'camera', 'shots', 'scene', 'setups', 'pace', 'first', 'half', 'actually', 'really', 'slow', 'Leon', 'walking', 'carefull', 'scene', 'photographer', 'looking', 'world', 'amplify', 'idea', 'shots', 'are', 'stunning', 'movie', ""'capturing"", 'heart', 'city', 'Leon', 'actions', 'favorite', 'shot', 'got', 'be', 'subway', 'escalators', 'seem', 'pop', 'up', 'sci-fi', 'alien', 'audience', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'music', 'so', 'subtle', 'could', 'just', 'solely', 'focus', 'scenery', 'was', 'filled', 'eye', 'candy', 'such', 'shadows', 'long', 'shots', 'buildings', 'best', 'eye', 'candy', 'had', 'be', 'when', 'Leon', 'back', 'subway', 'train', 'just', 'standing', 'middle', 'meat', 'plant', 'camera', 'focused', 'worker', 'background', 'slowly', 'counting', 'hanging', 'meat', 'hooks', 'sound', 'time', 'quiet', 'sounds', 'music', 'Pure', 'horror', 'beauty', 'thing', '.Now', 'unfortunately', 'cons', 'story', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'second', 'director', 'apparently', 'figured', 'out', 'viewers', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'just', 'pretty', 'shots', 'Instead', 'proper', 'escalation', 'psychology', 'battle', 'get', 'extremely', 'intense', 'blood', 'sequences', 'Now', 'even', 'was', 'little', 'squeamish', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'too', 'much', 'anatomy', 'human', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possible', 'get', 'bloody', 'as', 'quickly', 'movie', 'depicted', 'Blood', 'buckets', 'was', 'literally', 'thrown', 'train', 'floor', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'killer', 'cohorts', 'were', 'able', 'clean', 'morning.Speaking', 'cohorts', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'final', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'spoiler', 'what', 'intense', 'psychological', 'showdown', 'two', 'people', 'conspiracy', 'thing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'great', 'pacing', 'first', 'half.All', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'much', 'think', 'amount', 'gore', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'even', 'cheapened', 'what', 'director', 'had', 'going', 'beginning', 'movie', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'least', 'found', 'something', 'interesting']",N/A

Films like Saw 5 and Quarantine get big releases while this is released into cheap theatres and then on Commercial Cable TV and then video. Very sad.I just watched The Midnight Meat Train and I must say it's a great horror movie. It's certainly a fun ride that is gruesome, brutal, and hard to watch. It has beautiful visuals, and the gore is eye pleasing! The acting is great (Especially Jones, he freaked me out), and is a breath of fresh air. So I'll try something different with my review here:1. Yes the title is pretty cheesy, but it didn't distract me from the movie at all. It does indeed sound like the name of a porno. But looking past the cheesy title, it actually relates to the events in the movie.2. It does stay faithful to the short story, and is the best CB adaptation.3. Vinnie Jones is the bomb in this. He IS Mahogany. He really just pours himself into the role here. No effort required- he even looks like the last guy you'd wanna run into.4. This movie is VERY gory. I was actually squirming in a few scenes, but in other places the gore was obviously CGI, but that didn't detract from the movie. I'm a gore hound and I even cringed at a few bits.5. Ted Raimi makes a short cameo in this.6. This film takes a VERY unexpected twist at the end. I, for one, was completely gob-smacked and did NOT see it coming. It was a well-done twist that you'll be shocked by when you see it.7. The only thing I disliked is that at 100 minutes it actually felt longer, perhaps more like 2 hours and 15 minutes. I thought the fight scene on the train was the ending, but nope, I was wrong.8. It has an excellent one-liner: ""Please, step away from the meat.""9. And did I mention I totally did NOT see that twist at the end?Anyways this is an excellent movie, and one of the best horror/thriller movies Ive seen. It's gruesome, brutal stuff that's hard to watch.

1217064,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001MFNB4E,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","Clive Barker is a very skillful writer.  He's capable of some beautiful and evocative narratives.  He can create moods almost effortlessly.  His imagination is boundless.  HOWEVER, he puts these considerable talents to use in creating some of the most disturbing stories and novels ever.  His work is called ""horror"", which puts him into the same category as the likes of Stephen King.  But where King and his contemporaries try to terrify or scare, Barker wants to give you a case of, for lack of a better term, icky creeps.  Not just the ""regular"" creeps, but he wants you to feel tangibly dirty.  After reading one of his darkly effective tales, you're not to have a moment of shuddery catharsis.  You want to take a shower and do just about anything to get your mind off what you've just experienced.  Over the years, I've enjoyed much of his work, admired much and regretted reading much of it (and in most cases, I had all these feelings about the exact same work).  This guy knows no depths of depravity or grotesqueness to which he will not stoop.MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN is based on one of Barker's stories.  It follows a fairly frequent track.  An innocent person, often a person of no great personal courage, is drawn into or compelled by a series of every more mysterious events and clues and suddenly finds himself/herself in the thick of something dangerous, bloody and deeply disturbing.  In the case of this story, a photographer named Leon (Bradley Cooper), while trying to photograph the gritty underbelly of nighttime life in a major city, stumbles onto what appears to be a rather serious serial killer who dispatches his victims on subway trains.  The method of death and what happens afterwards I will not share...but let's just say it's brutal and hard to watch.Leon becomes obsessed with this mystery, and the impact on his own psyche is actual integral to the story.  Leon does some pretty stupid things, but unlike most lousy horror/slasher movies, we understand what he's doing because we sense the dark compulsion that drives him.  He's even somewhat complicit, one might argue.  His girlfriend (Leslie Bibb) becomes more and more concerned with Leon's behavior and becomes drawn into events as well.That's all I'll share about the plot.  The ""bad guy"" in this film is impressively (and silently) played by British character actor Vinnie Jones, most known for playing gangsters and thugs.  His demeanor in this film is memorable and effective.  If you're looking for a movie that isn't quite horror yet doesn't stoop to the completely mindless torture of movies like SAW or HOSTEL...you will appreciate MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN.  But don't misunderstand this...this is not a movie that's fun to watch.  Many of Barker's stories have made poor movies because his imagination is so unhinged that when not corralled by a master director, the plots come across as utterly silly on screen.  This film avoids most of those traps, but as the secrets of the story are slowly revealed, an element of laugh ability DOES slip in.  And the dialogue of the film is barely serviceable.  Director Ryuhei Kitamura does well at creating atmosphere and in translating that icky creepiness.  But he fails at creating believable humans.  Cooper is actually not terrible in this film, but he's just too lightweight to be believed in the more physical scenes.  He unravels well...but he doesn't fight as convincingly.  Bibb struggles because her character frequently does things of dubious logic.  Also on hand are Roger Bart (utterly miscast as a friend of the lead couple) and Brooke Shields (generic as an art dealer).In the end, the film is only for fans of Clive Barker and those with a strong tolerance for the icky.  If you like your horror to stay within boundaries of good taste...stay away.  I give the film three stars, because it gets a lot of Barker right.  But I cannot actually recommend it, because 90% of the movie-going public will rightfully run out of the path of the MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN.",3,"Often effective, sometimes silly and certainly for a niche audience only",1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,4004,"['Clive', 'Barker', 'very', 'skillful', 'writer', 'capable', 'beautiful', 'evocative', 'narratives', 'can', 'create', 'moods', 'almost', 'effortlessly', 'imagination', 'boundless', 'HOWEVER', 'considerable', 'talents', 'use', 'creating', 'most', 'disturbing', 'stories', 'novels', 'ever', 'work', 'called', 'horror', 'same', 'category', 'likes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'where', 'King', 'contemporaries', 'try', 'terrify', 'scare', 'Barker', 'give', 'case', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'icky', 'creeps', 'Not', 'just', 'regular', 'creeps', 'feel', 'tangibly', 'dirty', 'reading', 'one', 'darkly', 'effective', 'tales', ""'re"", 'not', 'have', 'moment', 'shuddery', 'catharsis', 'want', 'take', 'shower', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'get', 'mind', 'off', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'experienced', 'years', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'much', 'work', 'admired', 'much', 'regretted', 'reading', 'much', 'most', 'cases', 'had', 'feelings', 'exact', 'same', 'work', 'guy', 'depths', 'depravity', 'grotesqueness', 'will', 'not', 'stoop.MIDNIGHT', 'MEAT', 'TRAIN', 'based', 'one', 'Barker', 'stories', 'fairly', 'frequent', 'track', 'innocent', 'person', 'often', 'person', 'great', 'personal', 'courage', 'drawn', 'compelled', 'series', 'more', 'mysterious', 'events', 'clues', 'suddenly', 'thick', 'something', 'dangerous', 'bloody', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'case', 'story', 'photographer', 'named', 'Leon', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'trying', 'photograph', 'gritty', 'underbelly', 'nighttime', 'life', 'major', 'city', 'what', 'be', 'rather', 'serious', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'victims', 'subway', 'trains', 'method', 'death', 'what', 'afterwards', 'will', 'not', 'share', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'brutal', 'hard', 'watch.Leon', 'becomes', 'obsessed', 'mystery', 'impact', 'own', 'psyche', 'actual', 'integral', 'story', 'Leon', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'things', 'most', 'lousy', 'horror/slasher', 'movies', 'understand', 'what', 'doing', 'sense', 'dark', 'compulsion', 'even', 'somewhat', 'complicit', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'girlfriend', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', 'more', 'more', 'concerned', 'Leon', 'behavior', 'drawn', 'events', 'well.That', ""'ll"", 'share', 'plot', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'impressively', 'silently', 'played', 'British', 'character', 'actor', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'most', 'known', 'playing', 'gangsters', 'thugs', 'demeanor', 'film', 'memorable', 'effective', ""'re"", 'looking', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'horror', 'yet', ""n't"", 'stoop', 'completely', 'mindless', 'torture', 'movies', 'SAW', 'HOSTEL', 'will', 'appreciate', 'MIDNIGHT', 'MEAT', 'TRAIN', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'not', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'Many', 'Barker', 'stories', 'have', 'made', 'poor', 'movies', 'imagination', 'so', 'unhinged', 'when', 'not', 'corralled', 'master', 'director', 'plots', 'come', 'utterly', 'silly', 'screen', 'film', 'most', 'traps', 'secrets', 'story', 'are', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'element', 'laugh', 'ability', 'DOES', 'slip', 'dialogue', 'film', 'barely', 'serviceable', 'Director', 'Ryuhei', 'Kitamura', 'well', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'translating', 'icky', 'creepiness', 'creating', 'believable', 'humans', 'Cooper', 'actually', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'lightweight', 'be', 'believed', 'more', 'physical', 'scenes', 'well', ""n't"", 'fight', 'convincingly', 'Bibb', 'character', 'frequently', 'things', 'dubious', 'logic', 'Also', 'hand', 'are', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'utterly', 'miscast', 'friend', 'lead', 'couple', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'generic', 'art', 'dealer', 'end', 'film', 'only', 'fans', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'strong', 'tolerance', 'icky', 'like', 'horror', 'stay', 'boundaries', 'good', 'taste', 'stay', 'away', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'lot', 'Barker', 'right', 'can', 'not', 'actually', 'recommend', '90', '%', 'movie-going', 'public', 'will', 'rightfully', 'run', 'path', 'MIDNIGHT', 'MEAT', 'TRAIN']",N/A

Sure, it's not the story (few things could be), but some perfect casting touches combined with Kitamura's distinctive directorial style, showcased in earlier hits like Versus and Alive, make this one into a creepy winner.Mahogany (Guy Ritchie regular Vinnie Jones) is a serial killer who prowls the New York City subway system looking for victims. Leon (The Hangover's Bradley Cooper) is a photographer who catches Mahogany on film in the act of taking one. Leon quickly becomes obsessed with catching Mahogany in the act of actually killing in order to turn him over to the cops (who say they can't do anything until he's actually caught in the act), to the point of straining his relationship with his girlfriend Maya (Popular's Leslie Bibb). The closer Leon gets, though, the more he suspects that there's a method to Mahogany's seeming madness. And the more he finds out, the more he wonders just how far over his head he's actually in.Jeff Buhler (Insanitarium) delivers a script that almost fires on all cylinders; the characters are well-done and their reactions are believable. Meanwhile, the casting is top-notch; every actor here feels as if he were born to play his role. Kitamura sets everything in an atmosphere that's almost palpable, even when you watch this flick on the small screen. Factor in enough competency in the editing room to ensure a good pace, and you've got yourself a winner. Not a classic for the ages (I don't think), but a solid horror flick that's well worth watching.

1217066,A24K6KR7RHW7XB,B001MFNB4E,Ron,"[1, 1]","I had high hopes for this movie with all the rave reviews and its interesting concept, but it doesn't take long for the story to morph into a implausibly absurb story with equally implausible and absurb actions taken by most if not all the characters. This would have been so...so much better if it wasn't so predictable and if they would have backed off a step or two from the preposterious storyline and not insult the intelligence of their adult audience. The movie is geared for the young adult crowd while trying to bridge the gap somewhat for the maturer audience and their more developed need for good writing, acting and direction instead of CGI effects to carry the movie. The movie delivers for the most part on two of those accounts, but fails with the writing and somewhat on the direction. Maybe they tried to hard to appeal to the younger crowd and went with the gore and special effects and didn't spend as much time on the writing? After all thats where most of the money is generated from. I won't get into any detais to spoil the movie before you've seen it. The acting is very good especially for the genre and the lead couple Leon (Bradley Cooper) and Maya (Leslie Bibb) are believable as a loving couple. Maya works as a waitress and Leon as a photographer struggling to get noticed. Maya sets up his big chance through a mutual friend named Jurgis (Roger Bart) who has connections with Susan Hoff (Brooke Shields) a gallery owner. Hoff cirtiques Leons work and advises him to shoot more raw and visceral images of the city. He gets several shots of a model being accosted on a subway staircase before he intervenes. Shields character is quite impressed with the life and death moments captured on film and offers Leon a showing if he can get two more shots of breathtaking photos. Long story shortened he captures a partial image of a possible killer when he shoots the photos of the model. Instead of pursuing the images needed for the show Leon sets out to tail and photograph the butcher (his occupation) /killer named Mahogany (Vinney Jones) who plays his role quite well. This is where the story derails for me and what follows only reinforces my beliefs of the implausibility of the story and absurb actions taken by the characters. If I go into a detailed description I will be giving away to much of the story. Is this movie worth the time to watch? Yes.  Is it predictable? Yes, from early on. Is it entertaining? Yes, just don't expect a thought provoking thriller and you will be fine. 3+ StarsRating 0 to 5 StarsStory = 3  Concept is very good, but delivery is average.Acting = 4+Direction =3- Fails to control scenes and allows for way to much over the top story and action that ruins plausibility. To many loose ends that aren't addressed for me.Creepy/Scary = 3 It has a supernatural element that most will pick up on fairly early in the movie and is totally reveled at the end if you haven't figured it out before.Gore = 4+ Copious amounts of blood interesting array of weapons and tools of his trade. Plus a whole lot more that you will just have to see for yourselves.Violence = 4+ Kill scenes are violent and graphic with copious amounts of blood.Sex/Nudity = Yes/Yes With a couple of sex scenes between the two leads and four + nude scenes during and after kill scenes.Foul Language = Yes it covers most of the spectrum, but is not used in every sentence or scene.Entertainment Value = 3- This is an good movie with a great concept/premise and acting, but with average writing and direction it looses its ""WOW"" Factor and misses its mark. I am hoping for a rewrite with the same cast and as soon as I win the lottery I'll make it happen!Ps.

We live in an age where direct to video horror flicks are far more enjoyable than theatrical releases. I find myself checking the DVD/Bluray new releases more so than the theater dates. When I first saw the theatrical trailer for Clive Barker's The Midnight Meat Train, I couldnt wait. I was so excited that there was a new film adapted after a Clive Barker story. I was not disappointed.Firstly, lets talk about how the flick was treated by Dimension executives. I saw 1 theatrical trailer for this flick, and that was it. No kind of advertisement whatsoever. No TV spots, no posters or billboards, and finally, no release date. I kept waiting for this flick to play at the theater, but the day never came.The Midnight Meat Train was a victim of office politics, and nothing more. Dimension had to ensure that ""The Strangers"" did as good as possible at the box office, that TMMT was essentially shelved. Later, released quietly to a handful of dollar theaters across the country.This flick, is honest to god, one of the best horror experiences i've had since our calendars rolled over to the 00's. Everything about it feels like an old school horror flick. Beautiful scenery, and art direction, outstanding gore effects, superb acting(especially by vinnie jones, whom only says 3 words in the entire movie, but still pulls a stellar performance.) I've said before, that after the credits rolled on this film, I felt a way that I hadn't felt since the first viewing of ""Lord Of Illusions."" The atmosphere, and setting plays a big role in this film. Being a little bit of a claustrophobic in the first place, the thought of being attacked in such a personal, and enclosed area sent shivers down my spine.The Midnight Meat Train is the horror event of the decade, so do not even think about missing it. Don't let the fact that it was screwed over at the theater detract you from seeing the flick, as I said before, it was all office politics, and in no way a representation of the quality of this film.Check Clive Barker's The Midnight Meat Train out on FEARnet ON-Demand in high definitioin, or visit Fearnet.com on October 30th for the internet VOD premiere.9.5/10",5,THE must see horror flick of the decade.

Hoppock""","[8, 9]","I remember first seeing a preview for ""Midnight Meat Train"" when I went to see ""Rambo"" (which by the way was a great movie) in the theater earlier this year.  It would make sense that ""Midnight Meat Train"" was promoted before ""Rambo"" since both movies displayed graphic violence and were distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.  I recall thinking ""This movie looks rather interesting"".  However I never saw the movie in any of the theaters in my neighborhood, so I forgot about it.One night last month I found that ""Midnight Meat Train"" was playing on ""Demand TV"" so I watched it.  I have to say that this movie is quite bizarre and creepy but fits very well in the horror genre.  I suppose a movie that has the Clive Barker name attached to it is a good thing.  I must admit I felt this Brian De Palma or Alfred Hitchcock (with added gore) thing going on while I watched this movie. I would recommend this movie to horror movie enthusiasts; I don't think it would disappoint them.The movie follows an aspiring photographer played by Bradley Cooper.  Now had I not been a fan of the television series ""Nip/Tuck"" I wouldn't know who Bradley Cooper is.  He played a supporting character in season five of ""Nip/Tuck""; well here he plays the lead.  I must say he does a good job.  Anyway, Cooper's character is able to get a meeting with a big wig art/photo promoter played stylishly by Brooke Shields (who also was in ""Nip/Tuck"" season 4...hmmm).  Shield's character states that Cooper's work isn't ""edgy"" enough for the city that is New York and tells him to keep trying.So this takes our protagonist to the shadowy and dark parts of the New York City nights in order to capture ""edgy"" still life.  In the process he follows an attractive female model on the subway and takes her photo.  Then the next day finds out via newspaper that this same model has gone missing.  This leads our protagonist to again visit the subway and this time as he is taking photographs he witnesses a murder.Now mind you he take photos of the murder and after lots and lots of developing realizes that the murderer is more than likely responsible for the disappearance (and likely death) of the model our protagonist followed the first night he was shooting ""edgy"" photography.  Now to really make matters strange, the murder (Vinnie Jones) is a butcher by day, serial killer by night.  This leads to our protagonist becoming obsessed with piecing the puzzle of this mystery together and being pushed to the edge of insanity in the process.I will not give anything away, because this truly was a ""different"" type of horror movie.  I will admit there were a couple of ridiculous parts (some dubious CGI and a part where our ""hero"" successfully jumps on the ""Meat Train"" when it is traveling at full speed), but I was able to forgive them because this really was a good horror film, with many twits and turns.I do think the one thing that might have hurt this movie was the title, ""Midnight Meat Train"".  Now the title was appropriate to the content of the film, but it sounds a lot like a porno movie, honestly.  I don't know what else the movie could have been called, maybe ""Subway Slaughter"" or ""Murder on the Metro"".  Perhaps my movie titles are just as bad; it doesn't omit the fact that ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a daft name for a horror movie.",4,"Good movie, daft title",1228262400,"12 3, 2008",2008,3326,"['remember', 'first', 'seeing', 'preview', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'when', 'went', 'see', 'Rambo', 'way', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'theater', 'earlier', 'year', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'was', 'promoted', 'Rambo', 'movies', 'displayed', 'graphic', 'violence', 'were', 'distributed', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'Entertainment', 'recall', 'thinking', 'movie', 'rather', 'interesting', 'However', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'neighborhood', 'forgot', 'it.One', 'night', 'last', 'month', 'found', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'was', 'playing', 'Demand', 'TV', 'so', 'watched', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'quite', 'bizarre', 'creepy', 'very', 'well', 'horror', 'genre', 'suppose', 'movie', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'name', 'attached', 'good', 'thing', 'must', 'admit', 'felt', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'added', 'gore', 'thing', 'going', 'watched', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'enthusiasts', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'disappoint', 'them.The', 'movie', 'aspiring', 'photographer', 'played', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Now', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'television', 'series', 'Nip/Tuck', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'played', 'supporting', 'character', 'season', 'five', 'Nip/Tuck', 'well', 'here', 'lead', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'job', 'Anyway', 'Cooper', 'character', 'able', 'get', 'meeting', 'big', 'wig', 'art/photo', 'promoter', 'played', 'stylishly', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'who', 'also', 'was', 'Nip/Tuck', 'season', '4', 'hmmm', 'Shield', 'character', 'Cooper', 'work', ""n't"", 'edgy', 'enough', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'keep', 'trying.So', 'protagonist', 'shadowy', 'dark', 'parts', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'nights', 'order', 'capture', 'edgy', 'still', 'life', 'process', 'attractive', 'female', 'model', 'subway', 'photo', 'Then', 'next', 'day', 'out', 'newspaper', 'same', 'model', 'gone', 'missing', 'protagonist', 'again', 'visit', 'subway', 'time', 'taking', 'photographs', 'murder.Now', 'mind', 'take', 'photos', 'murder', 'lots', 'lots', 'developing', 'realizes', 'murderer', 'more', 'likely', 'responsible', 'disappearance', 'likely', 'death', 'model', 'protagonist', 'followed', 'first', 'night', 'was', 'shooting', 'edgy', 'photography', 'Now', 'really', 'make', 'matters', 'strange', 'murder', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'butcher', 'day', 'serial', 'killer', 'night', 'protagonist', 'becoming', 'obsessed', 'piecing', 'puzzle', 'mystery', 'together', 'being', 'pushed', 'edge', 'insanity', 'process.I', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'truly', 'was', 'different', 'type', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'admit', 'were', 'couple', 'ridiculous', 'parts', 'dubious', 'CGI', 'part', 'where', 'hero', 'successfully', 'Meat', 'Train', 'when', 'traveling', 'full', 'speed', 'was', 'able', 'forgive', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'many', 'twits', 'turns.I', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'hurt', 'movie', 'was', 'title', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'Now', 'title', 'was', 'appropriate', 'content', 'film', 'lot', 'porno', 'movie', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'maybe', 'Subway', 'Slaughter', 'Murder', 'Metro', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'titles', 'are', 'just', 'bad', ""n't"", 'omit', 'fact', 'Midnight', 'Meat', 'Train', 'daft', 'name', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A
1217073,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001MFNB4E,trashcanman,"[41, 47]","""Life is just a murdertrain a-comin'."" -DethklokJapanese cult cinema prodigy Ryuhei Kitamura has done it again.  But this time he has taken his anarchic genius and tossed us Westerners a bone by directing this American film based on ashort storyby Clive Barker.  The result is spectacular at times and entertaining throughout.  Kitamura is best known for his B-classicVersusand best loved by me for his modern samurai masterpieceAzumi.  He has never made a bad film and remains a director whose latest works I anticipate with baited breath. In the past, the biggest problems with his films have been budget-related, though he proved he can make a decent flick with only two real cast members in a single room with almost no special effects inAragami: The Raging God of Battle.  Well, with a modest (but large for him) American budget and a damn fine cast including Brooke Shields and Vinnie Jones (he's STILL the Juggernaut, b!+ch!), Kitamura has staked his claim in Western horror and I like what I see. A lot. In fact, there are shades ofThe Texas Chainsaw Massacrethroughout.  This may never be quite the classic that one is, but it is almost guaranteed to gather a cult following of its own.Our protagonist is Leon, a photographer on the verge of success with a beautiful girlfriend.  One night he happens upon a dizzying beauty being assailed by a group of thugs in the subway.  After bravely confronting the gang and using his head to escape harm while getting some outstandingly menacing photos in the process, he watches the girl get onto the late night train.  She is never seen again.  The girl turns out to be a popular model, and when her disappearance is noted by the paper, Leon becomes obsessed with the case.  Turns out folks have been disappearing along that route since at least the 1800's.  What follows is a riveting mystery with plenty of violence, a classic villain, and a twist that is genius even if the foreshadowing for it comes on too strong and gives it away.Vinnie Jones is intimidating in his no-lines performance as Mahogany, the towering meathead of a butcher who rides the late train and cleans house before the last stop with a disturbingly shiny hammer in one hand and a meathook in the other. His carnage is something to behold and Kitamura's unparalleled eye for jaw-dropping shots that astound with their creativity and downright coolness is put to use on several occasions.  One victim's head goes flying after taking a particularly brutal hammer blow and it is shot entirely with what I'm going to call a decapi-cam.  This is my shot of the year.  The other contenders are also from this film.  The climactic battle aboard the train could have been another typical bad-guy-vs-good-guy slugfest, but Kitamura has the camera swooping 360 degrees around the train as we view the fight through the windows and it comes to a stop just as the combatants bust through the glass right in front of it.  This is the kind of creativity American filmmakers are lacking these days.  There's another fight early on where what has to be the most militant-looking black man I've ever seen steps aboard and mocks Mahogany with a gut-busting quote fromForrest Gumpthat had me afraid I was going to wake up my wife across the house.  ""Midnight Meat Train"" may have a corny-sounding name, but it delivers the goods big-time.  There's less nudity than I would have liked considering what a sexpot Leon's woman is, but I'll trade some brief nude shots for hammer decapitations any day.Aside from some obvious filler, a few cutaway shots when I was screaming for more gore, and the excessive foreshadowing -which starts pretty early as genius but begins pounding you in the face as the film approaches critical mass- there is little not to love about this film if you are a horror fanatic.  Craven, Carpenter, Romero, and the other horror directors have got to be shaking in their boots right now because Kitamura is coming on strong with this film.  It's an absolute disgrace that this didn't get a wide theatrical release when so much garbage and so many remakes by so many hacks get millions spent on promotion and become big successes even if you can't find a single person who will admit to enjoying them.  Here's an excerpt from an article that illustrates my point:""Clive Barker was angry with the LionsGate's treatment, believing that Lionsgate president Joe Drake is essentially shortchanging other people's films in order to focus more attention on movies likeThe Strangers, where he received a producing credit: ""The politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all. This is all about ego, and though I mourn the fact that `Midnight Meat Train' was never given its chance in theaters, it's a beautifully stylish, scary movie, and it isn't going anywhere.

I won't go into the details of the plot, as it's already been very well elaborated on by other reviewers, but I will just add that as a piece of modern day horror/terror, I found it rewarding; it was both moody and menacing and though I'm not familiar with Clive Barker's short story, I really didn't feel that it suffered from excessive padding, at least, not so much that it proved to be too detrimental to either the story line or characters.  It's dark and deliberate pace may prove taxing for those that like their films delivered at breakneck speed but if you're looking for a more languid exploration of violence and obsession, MMT, I feel, fills that bill quite nicely.  Mind you, it's hardly a perfect movie, with some lukewarm performances and a few overly dark set pieces that obscure the action considerably, but overall it's a unnerving shocker that satisfies those interested society's grittier and darker side.  The direction, cinematography and art direction were really first rate, as everything seem to take on this shade of dread with subway trains racing through dark tunnels with a frenzied clatter, cameras pulling back along entire length of darkened multi-car trains at hyper speed, yielding shadowy glimpses of the brutality seething in that subterranean slaughterhouse and the omnipresent interchange between shadow and light, especially effective as the characters ascend up from and descend down into the subway stations.  For those who want to know, the gore factor is very much present and is, without question, a principal character.  As I get older and experience death more often, I find that I don't really enjoy that aspect of horror as much as I used to.  Mind you, it's done extremely well, with some very elaborate and original sequences, but, personally, I would have enjoyed the movie a great deal more if it hadn't been quite as graphic as it was.  I know for some, gore and splatter are their number one pre-requisite in a movie and that's cool, but I prefer a bit more subtlety and nuance as I no longer equate horror with blood and gut buts rather with a more unnerving sense of doom.",4,Works more often than not,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,2315,"['someone', 'who', 'public', 'transportation', 'daily', 'basis', 'sometimes', 'find', 'train', 'car', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'MMT', 'creeped', 'out', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'was', 'expecting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'plot', 'already', 'been', 'very', 'well', 'elaborated', 'other', 'reviewers', 'will', 'just', 'add', 'piece', 'modern', 'day', 'horror/terror', 'found', 'rewarding', 'was', 'moody', 'menacing', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'short', 'story', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'suffered', 'excessive', 'padding', 'least', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'proved', 'be', 'too', 'detrimental', 'either', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'dark', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'may', 'prove', 'taxing', 'like', 'films', 'delivered', 'breakneck', 'speed', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'languid', 'exploration', 'violence', 'obsession', 'MMT', 'feel', 'bill', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Mind', 'hardly', 'perfect', 'movie', 'lukewarm', 'performances', 'few', 'overly', 'dark', 'set', 'pieces', 'obscure', 'action', 'considerably', 'overall', 'unnerving', 'shocker', 'interested', 'society', 'grittier', 'darker', 'side', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'were', 'really', 'first', 'rate', 'everything', 'seem', 'take', 'shade', 'dread', 'subway', 'trains', 'racing', 'dark', 'tunnels', 'frenzied', 'clatter', 'cameras', 'pulling', 'back', 'along', 'entire', 'length', 'darkened', 'multi-car', 'trains', 'hyper', 'speed', 'yielding', 'shadowy', 'glimpses', 'brutality', 'seething', 'subterranean', 'slaughterhouse', 'omnipresent', 'interchange', 'shadow', 'light', 'especially', 'effective', 'characters', 'ascend', 'up', 'descend', 'down', 'subway', 'stations', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'gore', 'factor', 'very', 'much', 'present', 'question', 'principal', 'character', 'get', 'older', 'experience', 'death', 'more', 'often', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'aspect', 'horror', 'as', 'much', 'used', 'Mind', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'very', 'elaborate', 'original', 'sequences', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'quite', 'as', 'graphic', 'was', 'know', 'gore', 'splatter', 'are', 'number', 'one', 'pre-requisite', 'movie', 'cool', 'prefer', 'bit', 'more', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'no', 'longer', 'equate', 'horror', 'blood', 'gut', 'buts', 'rather', 'more', 'unnerving', 'sense', 'doom']",N/A
1217077,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001MFNB4E,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 0]","Based on Clive Barker's short story in the ""Books of Blood"" series in 1984, ""MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN"" is directed by Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura in his Hollywood film debut. Those who are familiar with Kitamura's works know that the man is excellent in visuals and editing tricks--the man is renowned for the terrific Jidai Geki hit ""Azumi"", shot an excellent film in a measly seven days with ""Aragami"", gave us the genre-bending cult hit ""Versus"" and thrilled us with the Yakuza occult short film ""The Messenger"". The man knows his stuff and has an impressive resume in Asia. However, this time around, he adapts a sub-par Barker story to the big screen, which restrains the man's visionary style.Leon (Bradley Cooper) is an aspiring ""art"" photographer who moonlights as a photo journalist. He walks around this urban city in the hopes of capturing something significant to a gallery owner (played by Brooke Shields). During his rounds, Leon chances upon a potential mugging of a beautiful Japanese model named Nora (Erika Sakaki) by street thugs and scares the thugs away. Nora boards the train and disappears. By chance, the following night, Leon spies upon a huge, intimidating man named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) and he is intrigued. Leon is hooked and he witnesses Mahogany murder the remaining passengers on a late subway train. Terrified, yet oddly drawn to this killer, Leon finds himself in the middle of this mystery and drags his sexy girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb) along with him.Ryuhei Kitamura is an excellent director. He knows his stuff, and knows how to edit and make his shots look very cool. The gore and blood in the film are nicely executed--freeze frames, gorged eyes popping out, limbs hacked off, hammered heads, splattering arterial spray, quick zooms and close ups with the usual darkly lit cinematography and gloomy cinematography. It is quite stylish, visceral and the shots look very pretty. Director Kitamura is utilizing the best from what is available to him, a butcher-killer who stalks late subway trains has a very limited concept, so Kitamura uses style to cover up its very limited plot. There is a lot of brutal violence in the film, admittedly it isn't anything we haven't seen before, so what can ace director Kitamura do? He does what he does best, he shoots and sticks to his style.The film does have very obvious limits to its narrative. The screenplay by Jeff Buhler seems  stretched out, he depends on Leon's visions and flashbacks to try to go into the depths of his mind and imminent psychosis. The rest of the script is pretty routine, relying on melodrama and insipid metaphor, the two leads does have their moments of intimacy to generate sympathy (it would`ve helped if it had abundant scenes of sex and nudity). Kitamura's skill is stretched to the limit in trying to find a good foothold on the film`s premise. The monstrous images utilizes the use of prosthetics and assisted by CGI, there are some legitimate attempts at scares but the problem is, what is meant to be gory and disquieting, looks too pretty--how can a scene supposed to be alarmingly frightening become mere eye candy? All the CGI blood feels a little out of place.Alright, I know what you are wondering about--does ""Midnight Meat Train"" have an iconic antagonist? Well, this killer is an impeccably dressed psychotic individual and he does what he does very meticulously. He carries a briefcase based on a veterinarian's bag that holds his ""butcher"" tools. Vinnie Jones is rightly cast in the role of the mad killer and he does give off a  creepy, intimidating presence. Unlike, Jason or Freddy, Mahogany seems rather normal and does have certain complexities to his character. He is hinted as dying, and he doesn't want to give up his work in serving his twisted masters. Apparently, Mahogany has a disturbing purpose--to separate the human world from something evil, a task he believes needs to be done.Most of the blame would have to fall on the adaptation of its source material. Barker's short story does have a very limited concept. The filmmakers would have done well to have just adapted the idea and evolved a plotline more fitting for movie scares; I would have loved to see a film about Mahogany's masters and they should've stuck to the basics of an old-fashioned gory, exploitive, horrific experience. ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a typical Clive Barker film; full of plot holes, usual descent into madness and an ending on the ""fantasy train"". The film's plot sure feels more aimed at a literary style and not as a film experience; it proved too flimsy and stretched out. It's just that when you've seen one Barker flick--it feels like you've seen them all. The main issue is, this film didn't scare me or gave me suspense at all--the impression it left was just how cool the movie looked.Recommended with caution, rent it first [3 Stars]",3,A Great New
