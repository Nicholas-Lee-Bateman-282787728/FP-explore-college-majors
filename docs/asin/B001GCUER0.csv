1193886,A36QOKGQK2DG8V,B001GCUER0,Adventure Fan,"[1, 5]","BLU-RAY vs HDTV vs DVD vs TVThe picture quality on the blu-ray is the best version of the show. But it's not life-altering. It's very film-grainy. If that's the intent, that's fine, it looks cheap, maybe ""artistic,"" and its not distracting, but the texture is obvious in almost every shot. I watch on a 50"" plasma, and it's nice, but the blu-ray isn't a huge leap over the dvd, not to me. And the third disc had two episodes where the disc froze. This is the first blu-ray that has ever froze on me. Maybe it's a fluke. But it happened.THE STORYTELLINGI remember the first three episodes of season 1 of Mad Men. It was glorious. The main character, Don, was a genuine force. A fantastic protagonist. I loved him, unconditionally, untill the end of the season when the writers started giving him flashbacks. Trying to use shortcuts to explain him, to turn him from a larger-than-life force, into an average screwed-up guy. Now, I still like Don, and I still like the show, and maybe I stand alone here, but they did the flashback thing again at the end of season 2. I don't regret spending my free time watching this show, but it's starting to get that episodic-tv-bad-soap-opera-effect. The plot twists are starting to add up, bleeding the character out. Next year, when season 3 hits blu-ray, I'll netflix it, to give it another chance... But I find myself becoming a bit indifferent to this show. I still reccomend people try it, because it's good, and maybe I'm too picky. Lot's of people love this show, and can embrace the particular qualities that have turned me cool. This may sound like a ""downer"" review, but we're talking about a show with a downer tone and a downer plot, so it's kind of symmetric.",4,"Good Show, So-So Blu-Ray",1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1709,"['BLU-RAY', 'vs', 'HDTV', 'vs', 'DVD', 'TVThe', 'picture', 'quality', 'blu-ray', 'best', 'version', 'show', 'not', 'life-altering', 'very', 'film-grainy', 'intent', 'fine', 'cheap', 'maybe', 'artistic', 'not', 'distracting', 'texture', 'obvious', 'almost', 'shot', 'watch', '50', 'plasma', 'nice', 'blu-ray', ""n't"", 'huge', 'leap', 'dvd', 'not', 'third', 'disc', 'had', 'two', 'episodes', 'where', 'disc', 'froze', 'first', 'blu-ray', 'ever', 'froze', 'Maybe', 'fluke', 'STORYTELLINGI', 'remember', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'Mad', 'Men', 'was', 'glorious', 'main', 'character', 'Don', 'was', 'genuine', 'force', 'A', 'fantastic', 'protagonist', 'loved', 'unconditionally', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'writers', 'started', 'giving', 'flashbacks', 'Trying', 'use', 'shortcuts', 'explain', 'turn', 'larger-than-life', 'force', 'average', 'screwed-up', 'guy', 'Now', 'still', 'Don', 'still', 'show', 'maybe', 'stand', 'alone', 'here', 'did', 'flashback', 'thing', 'again', 'end', 'season', '2', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'spending', 'free', 'time', 'watching', 'show', 'starting', 'get', 'episodic-tv-bad-soap-opera-effect', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'starting', 'add', 'up', 'bleeding', 'character', 'Next', 'year', 'when', 'season', '3', 'hits', 'blu-ray', ""'ll"", 'netflix', 'give', 'chance', 'find', 'becoming', 'bit', 'indifferent', 'show', 'still', 'reccomend', 'people', 'try', 'good', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'too', 'picky', 'Lot', 'people', 'love', 'show', 'can', 'embrace', 'particular', 'qualities', 'have', 'turned', 'cool', 'may', 'sound', 'downer', 'review', ""'re"", 'talking', 'show', 'downer', 'tone', 'downer', 'plot', 'kind', 'symmetric']",Mad Men: Season 2

Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[6, 8]","This series still provides compelling viewing but some of the edge of the first season has worn off.We are back in the heart of Madison Ave in 1962 but the action in this series spreads out into the characters' lives outside the office. It's become a soap opera. What made the first season so enjoyable was seeing the ad men at work, creating their products. Now we get a lot of marital strife, affairs, breakups, a weird back-story and other stuff that's way less interesting.One plus is the way the writers depict the frustrations of women. You see the roots of women's liberation before it even has a name.

1193898,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B001GCUER0,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[3, 4]","Before I watched MAD MEN,  I thought it was a pretty crazy idea to set the series back in the 1960s.  I grew up in that era and didn't particularly want to experience a tv show set in it.  Then I saw it and kept seeing it and changed my mind. MAD MEN is about the advertising industry beginning in USA 1960 but it is so much more than that.  It brings back the way we lived then, forcing us to look back and then compare it with the way we live now.  In so many ways that is a shocking experience on a continual basis.  When I first saw pregnant women smoking and drinking on the show, I was aghast, considerably more aghast than when I saw it in real life back in that time era.  This is because NO ONE is seen (in public at least) smoking and drinking while pregnant, especially if one is upwardly mobile.  Another shock was to see racism and sexism flaunted on a daily basis in both the work place and socially as something that was totally ok and legal. MAD MEN works on so many levels and is so well layered in meaning largely because it is so well written.  That writer is former SOPRANOS' writer, Matthew Weiner.  He depicts the Sterling Cooper advertising agency on the surface of the show but the lies and deceit, which are the daily business of the agency, are also the stuff of the characters' personal lives as well. Weiner hand picked the lead for his show, Jon Hamm, playing Don Draper, the creative director and junior partner of Sterling Cooper.  Draper leads a wholly manufactured life as he took over another man's identity during the war.  He is not the real Don Draper, the real one having died by his side in the war.  The best moment of the show is when his boss (Bertram Cooper played by Robert Morse) is told of this deception by an underling and his response is that it doesn't matter.  He sees that the artifice and facade of Draper works for his agency and he could care less about Draper's ""truth"" just like he could care less about the truth of the products he advertises. Jon Hamm is outstanding as Draper.  He is absolutely the lead of the show and his continual crisis of identity and living a life of complete falsehood continues to unravel in him in Season Two.  A business trip out to California is the springboard and his time spent there is fascinating.  The other characters continue to develop too.  Betty Draper, Don's wife, is continually fascinating as the beautiful, perfect trophy wife with a completely placid surface and an underneath of tsunami level suppressed rage.  I remember this era best by all the women whom Betty Draper represents. Don and Betty are my favorite characters but the other characters intrigue me as well.  Pete Campbell and Peggy Olsen come together yet again this season, rediscovering one another after their disastrous coming together in season one.  Pete remains the biggest thorn in Don's side while Peggy represents his best help in all crises.  Joan Holloway as the buxom, red headed chief secretary seems to be putting a perfect life together for herself with a doctor fiance yet she conceals his sexual brutality towards her from everyone.  On the surface she uses her sexuality to advance herself but at every other level it undermines her. I could go on and on about the other characters and plotlines on the show but this is fascinating stuff that you need to discover fresh for yourselves. I would watch the series in order, first season one and then season two.  For me, season three begins in just a few weeks and I will be parked in front of the screen taking it in.",5,Mad Men Takes Us Back and Forward,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,3552,"['watched', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'crazy', 'idea', 'set', 'series', 'back', '1960s', 'grew', 'up', 'era', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'want', 'experience', 'tv', 'show', 'set', 'Then', 'saw', 'kept', 'seeing', 'changed', 'mind', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'advertising', 'industry', 'beginning', 'USA', '1960', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'back', 'way', 'lived', 'then', 'forcing', 'look', 'back', 'then', 'compare', 'way', 'live', 'now', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'shocking', 'experience', 'continual', 'basis', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'pregnant', 'women', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'show', 'was', 'aghast', 'considerably', 'more', 'aghast', 'when', 'saw', 'real', 'life', 'back', 'time', 'era', 'ONE', 'seen', 'public', 'least', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'pregnant', 'especially', 'one', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'shock', 'was', 'see', 'racism', 'sexism', 'flaunted', 'daily', 'basis', 'work', 'place', 'socially', 'something', 'was', 'totally', 'ok', 'legal', 'MAD', 'MEN', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'so', 'well', 'layered', 'meaning', 'largely', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'writer', 'former', 'SOPRANOS', 'writer', 'Matthew', 'Weiner', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', 'advertising', 'agency', 'surface', 'show', 'lies', 'deceit', 'are', 'daily', 'business', 'agency', 'are', 'also', 'stuff', 'characters', 'personal', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'Weiner', 'hand', 'picked', 'lead', 'show', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'playing', 'Don', 'Draper', 'creative', 'director', 'junior', 'partner', 'Sterling', 'Cooper', 'Draper', 'wholly', 'manufactured', 'life', 'took', 'over', 'man', 'identity', 'war', 'not', 'real', 'Don', 'Draper', 'real', 'one', 'having', 'died', 'side', 'war', 'best', 'moment', 'show', 'when', 'boss', 'Bertram', 'Cooper', 'played', 'Robert', 'Morse', 'told', 'deception', 'underling', 'response', ""n't"", 'matter', 'artifice', 'facade', 'Draper', 'works', 'agency', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'Draper', 'truth', 'just', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'truth', 'products', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'outstanding', 'Draper', 'absolutely', 'lead', 'show', 'continual', 'crisis', 'identity', 'living', 'life', 'complete', 'falsehood', 'unravel', 'Season', 'Two', 'business', 'trip', 'California', 'springboard', 'time', 'spent', 'fascinating', 'other', 'characters', 'continue', 'develop', 'too', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'Don', 'wife', 'continually', 'fascinating', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'trophy', 'wife', 'completely', 'placid', 'surface', 'underneath', 'tsunami', 'level', 'suppressed', 'rage', 'remember', 'era', 'best', 'women', 'whom', 'Betty', 'Draper', 'Don', 'Betty', 'are', 'favorite', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'intrigue', 'well', 'Pete', 'Campbell', 'Peggy', 'Olsen', 'come', 'together', 'yet', 'again', 'season', 'rediscovering', 'one', 'disastrous', 'coming', 'together', 'season', 'one', 'Pete', 'biggest', 'thorn', 'Don', 'side', 'Peggy', 'best', 'help', 'crises', 'Joan', 'Holloway', 'buxom', 'red', 'headed', 'chief', 'secretary', 'be', 'putting', 'perfect', 'life', 'together', 'doctor', 'fiance', 'yet', 'sexual', 'brutality', 'everyone', 'surface', 'sexuality', 'advance', 'other', 'level', 'could', 'go', 'other', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'show', 'fascinating', 'stuff', 'need', 'discover', 'fresh', 'yourselves', 'would', 'watch', 'series', 'order', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'then', 'season', 'two', 'season', 'three', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'will', 'be', 'parked', 'front', 'screen', 'taking']",Mad Men: Season 2
1193899,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B001GCUER0,Carolyn Paetow,"[0, 0]","(Spoilers refer to Season One only)Season Two of the ad-biz saga shows a marked improvement as the series' creators leave off most of the ponderous lampooning of previous times and concentrate on the in-office and out-of-office interactions of the principal players.  Female characters are more credibly drawn, and a few black portrayals are fleshed out into more than menial window dressing.  Even the smoking is not quite so frantic and widespread.Don Draper now has more screen competition from the intriguing Peggy Olson, whose home life provides a basis for condemnation of the mores of post-Fifties society and the beliefs of the Catholic Church.  Compared to the first season, this criticism is subltle and implicit, though a good deal of air time is consumed by it.In Season One, Peggy has become pregnant even though she has started taking birth control pills.  Despite a significant weight gain, she fails to realize she is with child until labor pains drive her to an emergency room.  The script never explains why she became pregnant despite The Pill or even why she believes she did.  A knowledgeable viewer might assume she was not told that the medication must be taken for a month to assure effectiveness.  It is difficult to believe, however, that the smart, savvy Peggy failed to read the instructions or took the pills incorrectly or haphazardly.  And, as for her lack of pregnancy realization, this also can scarcely be related to a lack of intelligence or common sense.  The phenomenon has occurred with other women, usually due to irregular or almost non-existent periods.  Probably, it is supposed that the audience will blame a pre-sexual-revolution society, implying that Peggy is ignorant of the symptoms of pregnancy.  It cannot reasonably be a thing of guilt with her, since she took so readily to the  give-the-boys-whatever-they want attitude instructed by office-manager Joan.  As the second season makes abundantly clear, though, the Catholic Church has and continues to have an impact on her life.The worst thing about the second season is the sex, which has become more sordid, anonymous, and perverse.  Draper's episodes of adultery, as well as other hollow time-fillers, often seem to be little more than tiresome opportunities to showcase him in undershirts, shorts, swim trunks, or sheets.  One scene involving a lead female is so unlikely and surrealistically staged that many viewers probably expect to ultimately find it to be presented as fantasy.  For the series' creators, it probably represented the ultimate in toilet-stall sex.",4,Getting Down to Business,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,2574,"['Spoilers', 'refer', 'Season', 'One', 'only', 'Season', 'Two', 'ad-biz', 'saga', 'marked', 'improvement', 'series', 'creators', 'leave', 'off', 'most', 'ponderous', 'lampooning', 'previous', 'times', 'concentrate', 'in-office', 'out-of-office', 'interactions', 'principal', 'players', 'Female', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'credibly', 'drawn', 'few', 'black', 'portrayals', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'menial', 'window', 'dressing', 'Even', 'smoking', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'frantic', 'widespread.Don', 'Draper', 'now', 'more', 'screen', 'competition', 'intriguing', 'Peggy', 'Olson', 'home', 'life', 'basis', 'condemnation', 'mores', 'post-Fifties', 'society', 'beliefs', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Compared', 'first', 'season', 'criticism', 'subltle', 'implicit', 'good', 'deal', 'air', 'time', 'consumed', 'it.In', 'Season', 'One', 'Peggy', 'become', 'pregnant', 'even', 'started', 'taking', 'birth', 'control', 'pills', 'significant', 'weight', 'gain', 'realize', 'child', 'labor', 'pains', 'drive', 'emergency', 'room', 'script', 'never', 'why', 'became', 'pregnant', 'Pill', 'even', 'why', 'did', 'knowledgeable', 'viewer', 'might', 'assume', 'was', 'not', 'told', 'medication', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'month', 'assure', 'effectiveness', 'difficult', 'believe', 'however', 'smart', 'savvy', 'Peggy', 'failed', 'read', 'instructions', 'took', 'pills', 'incorrectly', 'haphazardly', 'lack', 'pregnancy', 'realization', 'also', 'can', 'scarcely', 'be', 'related', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'common', 'sense', 'phenomenon', 'occurred', 'other', 'women', 'usually', 'due', 'irregular', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'periods', 'Probably', 'supposed', 'audience', 'will', 'blame', 'pre-sexual-revolution', 'society', 'implying', 'Peggy', 'ignorant', 'symptoms', 'pregnancy', 'can', 'not', 'reasonably', 'be', 'thing', 'guilt', 'took', 'so', 'readily', 'give-the-boys-whatever-they', 'want', 'attitude', 'instructed', 'office-manager', 'Joan', 'second', 'season', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'though', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'have', 'impact', 'life.The', 'worst', 'thing', 'second', 'season', 'sex', 'become', 'more', 'sordid', 'anonymous', 'perverse', 'Draper', 'episodes', 'adultery', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'hollow', 'time-fillers', 'often', 'seem', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'tiresome', 'opportunities', 'showcase', 'undershirts', 'shorts', 'swim', 'trunks', 'sheets', 'One', 'scene', 'involving', 'lead', 'female', 'so', 'unlikely', 'surrealistically', 'staged', 'many', 'viewers', 'probably', 'expect', 'ultimately', 'find', 'be', 'presented', 'fantasy', 'series', 'creators', 'probably', 'represented', 'ultimate', 'toilet-stall', 'sex']",Mad Men: Season 2
1193900,A1NZRSRYA1WGPO,B001GCUER0,Cayuga,"[1, 2]","My sister is a fan, so I decided to check out Mad Men. So far, I've viewed seasons One & Two.I was expecting something different. As many reviewers have noted, the sets and decor are relatively true to the era.  However, the behavior is not.  It's as if the writers were trying to superimpose a 21st century hip irony on to the early 1960s.  The characters are repeatedly snarky and cruel, out-of-character for an era when one's social face had to have at least a semblance of graciousness.  The era was a time when social bonds were stronger, and despite many dysfunctions, there seemed to be more caring of one another. In the world of the show, none of the adults has any real loyalty to anyone else.  Each character is self-interested almost to the point of sociopathy.  I haven't yet found a character with a heart, except perhaps the 12-yr-old boy, Glen, who is the Drapers' neighbor.  There's no one to root for or even care about. It reminds me of Nip/Tuck.The depiction of casual sexual mores is also anachronistic.  Yes, there were adulterers in early 1960's, but the amount of sleeping around that happens in this show is a figment of present Hollywood imagination.  The sexual revolution did not occur until the late 1960s, and didn't impact social behavior on a wide scale until the 1970s.  And even THEN, in the pre-AIDS, disco era, the adultery was not taking place as often as it does on this show.  In a Season One episode, we have Roger Sterling asking 20-year-old twin sisters to kiss each other. Like that would have happened then! The whole lesbian chic thing dates from the early 1990s-onward.Yes, the show is enjoyable for the visual immersion into the styles of the time.  Some of the differences in risk/regulation between that era and today are depicted in high relief. Being reminded of ""the way it was"" has entertainment value.  People smoked literally everywhere back then, tossed litter like it was nothing, didn't use seatbelts, and consumed alcohol while pregnant. The show does provide a stylistic window into the early 1960s, but the writers get the attitudes all wrong.",3,Gives visual pleasure but lacks compelling characters,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,2104,"['sister', 'fan', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Mad', 'Men', 'So', 'far', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'seasons', 'One', 'Two.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'sets', 'decor', 'are', 'relatively', 'true', 'era', 'However', 'behavior', 'not', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'superimpose', '21st', 'century', 'hip', 'irony', 'early', '1960s', 'characters', 'are', 'repeatedly', 'snarky', 'cruel', 'out-of-character', 'era', 'when', 'one', 'social', 'face', 'had', 'have', 'least', 'semblance', 'graciousness', 'era', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'social', 'bonds', 'were', 'stronger', 'many', 'dysfunctions', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'caring', 'one', 'world', 'show', 'none', 'adults', 'real', 'loyalty', 'anyone', 'else', 'character', 'self-interested', 'almost', 'point', 'sociopathy', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'found', 'character', 'heart', 'perhaps', '12-yr-old', 'boy', 'Glen', 'who', 'Drapers', 'neighbor', 'one', 'root', 'even', 'care', 'Nip/Tuck.The', 'depiction', 'casual', 'sexual', 'mores', 'also', 'anachronistic', 'Yes', 'were', 'adulterers', 'early', '1960', 'amount', 'sleeping', 'show', 'figment', 'present', 'Hollywood', 'imagination', 'sexual', 'revolution', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'late', '1960s', 'did', ""n't"", 'impact', 'social', 'behavior', 'wide', 'scale', '1970s', 'even', 'THEN', 'pre-AIDS', 'disco', 'era', 'adultery', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'place', 'as', 'often', 'show', 'Season', 'One', 'episode', 'have', 'Roger', 'Sterling', 'asking', '20-year-old', 'twin', 'sisters', 'kiss', 'other', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'then', 'whole', 'lesbian', 'chic', 'thing', 'dates', 'early', '1990s-onward.Yes', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'visual', 'immersion', 'styles', 'time', 'differences', 'risk/regulation', 'era', 'today', 'are', 'depicted', 'high', 'relief', 'Being', 'reminded', 'way', 'was', 'entertainment', 'value', 'People', 'smoked', 'literally', 'everywhere', 'back', 'then', 'tossed', 'litter', 'was', 'nothing', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'seatbelts', 'consumed', 'alcohol', 'pregnant', 'show', 'provide', 'stylistic', 'window', 'early', '1960s', 'writers', 'get', 'attitudes', 'wrong']",Mad Men: Season 2

If you ever wondered about or wanted to ""relive"" the early 1960's, this is your series - it may be slightly exaggerated here and there, but I think it captures things pretty well. This was a very interesting time for America.Lots of things happen in this season. Draper and his wife are going through a split, and Draper heads to California for a while. The California interlude is pretty wild - he meets some jet setters for one thing. We also learn something about his past that was not really shown before. I thought the scene with Draper going into the water with the old country/gospel song about Jesus playing in the background was pretty awesome - even if you don't believe in baptism, it is still powerfully symbolic of change and renewal to come in Draper's life, I think.Mrs. Draper has some adventures too. Really wild there.Peggy is moving up. She even tells about her baby at one point.The ad agency is sold near the end of the season, and this will make for some interesting drama next season I am sure.

Well, it begins with two episodes that are barely coherent. I guess this is what passes for &#34;intrigue.&#34; At any rate, many things are simply dropped on the viewer, leaving one to &#34;figure it out.&#34; Further into the season, things became more clear, but there was no reason to confuse or obfuscate so many major plot points, such as what happened to someone's newborn baby. There is still plenty of innuendo, drinking, and smoking, to the point of distraction. While researching the show, I learned the actors are not permitted to smoke tobacco cigarettes on set, so they use herbal ones. This explains why the cigarettes don't seem to burn correctly, which becomes a distraction only because there is so much smoking. Then there is the incessant misogyny, racism, and browbeating. While this may be appropriate for the time, many characters, especially Don Draper (the lead) have practically NO redeeming qualities. With Draper it got to the point where I didn't care about his messed up childhood or his inability to relate to his wife or anyone else. He became a cardboard place holder that needed to do something other than say, &#34;What do you want me to say?&#34; Lame and annoying. Peggy, Roger, and Joan are the characters with more arc and interesting development. Finally, the show hit it's stride near the end, albeit with a few clunky interruptions. I'm left wondering if this whole season needed a re-write. I'm also left wondering if I should go further into this show, or cut my losses.

I find most television boring and stupid, but this show is head and shoulders above the rest.Update 09-08-09.  Just watched most of Season 2 with commentary.  There are two commentary tracks, one with Matt, people behind the scenes and the actors and another without Matt Weiner with actors such as Christina Hendricks, Elisabeth Moss, etc. I found the the commentary by series creator Matt Weiner, along with the director, and the lovely voice of Jon Hamm, fascinating.  Matt gives the viewers so much information about the scene set ups, the filming process, casting, character motivation, stuff that's going on behind the scenes and its as if he's talking directly to you.

Far more a version of ""Sex and the City"" with much cooler clothes and cars and music (and girls), what's left out of this piece of plastic is everything we truly know about the time, which is everything its smarmy Yuppie audience has had a major hand in exterminating in our current culture: earnestness, optimism, a sense of community, grace, complexity, self-deprecation, hatred of the rich and big business, a refusal to demonize others and puff up ourselves, and (perhaps most important) the assumption that people are basically good.Not only were slick and shiny dime-a-dozen ad-men no one's idea of a role model in the early 1960s, they became the embodiment of everything repulsively corporate, compromised, materialistic and oh-so-1957. ('Course one of the wonderful things about that time is no one thought along the lines of ""oh-so-1957"".) Take a look: ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""Lilies of the Field"", the Beach Boys, Stanley Elkin, David Janssen, Jasper Johns, the 1962 Dual-Ghia, Steve Allen, Ornette Coleman, Rosemary Clooney, ""The Hustler"", ""The Ladies Man"", the TWA Terminal at Idlewild, and of course Jack Kennedy himself.What we get here, rather, is the same old campy, self-referential ""I gotta go right out and buy that tie!"" mutant elite ass-kissing. Creator Matt Weiner tries very hard (and very successfully) to pull the wooly over the eyes of the self-enchanted mind-travelers who read/watch/listen in order to feel even more self-enchanted, for this glamorama soap opera has all the ""subtlety"" of a Bloomingdale's store window. (Come to think of it, ""Mad Men"" is the ultimate Bloomingdale's store window.)Just take the role models. We have the ubercompetent corporate drone. The hysterectical stay-at-home worthy of ""Desperate Housewives"". The frail, tremulous heroine buried under an avalanche of agency problems. (With the coming gravy of sexual harassment ladled over her. Abortion anyone?) The porcine connected jerk invulnerable to retribution because of his seniority. The burnt-out case, with bad job, bad marriage, stacks of unpaid bills. And everyone always chirp-chirp-chirping at those oh-so-important client meetings. (My kingdom for a cell phone!)Sure smells like 1963 to me. Or is that the Starbucks down the block?What's most repulsive about ""Mad Men"" is how this time (the ""last time before America became a slave to anxiety,"" as Mailer put it) is seen through the Weiner-ish prism of contemporary Yuppoid self-congratulation. Yeah, sure they had the music and the cars and a real man as President. But we're so much smarter now! So much more dedicated to our work, our appearance, our health, our environment. So much more civilized about race, and gender, and sexual preference. So much more educated with so much more knowledge right at our fingertips. And how `bout that clunky & pathetic old technology?!An incredibly stupid show for its appropriately stupid audience. How is it possible to make a series about a time that seems more golden as the years go by, especially from the POV of the emotional & cultural cesspool America has now become, without so much as a glimmer of regret, sadness, or melancholy toward what's been lost?

Having worked in the sixties for Shell Oil Corp. in the Sperry-Rand building on Sixth & 51st -- where the politics, camraderie, martini lunches, humiliations, & male chauvinism -- marvelously evoked by the writers of 'Mad' -- were in evidence. I spent 18 hours (with breathers for coffee & breakfast) watching all 13 episodes of the first season over the course of an all-nighter -- and tonight I am compelled to re-view the last three episodes. It's like a blend of Delillo's first novel 'Americana', Yates' 'Revolutionary Road', with the decor of 'Desk Set' and the bitter comedy of Billy Wilder's 'The Apartment' (which is referenced in an early episode of 'Mad'), with vintage 'Playboy' ambience thrown in for good measure. These were the last years when women wore petticoats, merry widows, stockings, and suspender belts. The only weakness I could detect was the flimsily produced Korean War sequence illuminating Don Draper's secret origins. As far as I can see that part could have been explained in dialogue -- a la Greek tragedy -- without using the cheesy old M.A.S.H. set. All in all it's the best adult soap I've ever seen. I can only hope the season continues for as long as 'Sopranos'. Lastly kudos for the music composer and the animators that created the opening credits sequence -- it's fabulous -- This HBO product is a work in which every participant should derive a lifetime's worth of pride. Great! And writers: withold, withold, withold the easy character explanations.

Season 1 did a very good job in laying the foundation for Season 2.  We start to see that all these characters are complex and three-dimensional, not the cookie cutter people we see from Season 1.  Although this show is slow paced it is definitely thought provoking and still fascinating to watch.  Many symbols and parallels are cleverly incorporated into the script.

A Bowen ""tabithajab""","[4, 5]","*Spoilers ahead!*Having just finished watching my boxed set, I would like to add my opinion to those who have already boldly stated theirs.Compulsively watchable in Season One, ""Mad Men"" in Season II is even more so, for it is here that we explore the relationships between the characters in depth, and watch as the plot lines set forth become more involved and fascinating.  I felt that Season II was the season of Betty Draper, although we also saw Peter Campbell's relationships both weaken and explode, Peggy grow into a more confident part of the team, and Joan Holloway give away her smoldering sexuality to a man who looks like the perfect match but who has sexual hangups that are hard to watch.As played by the stunning January Jones, Betty in Season One seemed like a beautiful ice maiden, always perfect down to her manicured nails, never out of control, able to withstand her suspicions of Don's infidelity without cracking her veneer.  In Season II all comes unravelled, and it is mesmerizing to watch as Betty's fragile hold on normalcy comes unglued.  I found myself cheering her on as she finally took hold of her life and wrested from it the shreds of her dignity.  I'm still not sure I like her, but I started to respect her.Don, as always mysterious, inscrutable, and morally bankrupt, undergoes a sea change as well.  Jon Hamm owns this part just as Michael C. Hall owns the part of ""Dexter"".  I watched enthralled as he went from a defensive, combative, egocentrically ambitious man to one floundering for the meaning of his life.  Without giving too much away, I can say that this was handled well by the writers, as they had to work within a time frame and could not accomplish everything by use of flashback without dragging Season II out too long.  What makes Don Draper a fascinating character is the way, just when he seems like the coldest cad imaginable, he then becomes a loving father or a caring mentor.  The writing in this series is truly fine.All of the supporting characters are excellent and have an essential part to play, as it should be with a series of this caliber.  John Slattery is always a favorite, so quick-witted and shamelessly lecherous, and the frat boy club of Ken Cosgrove, etc. are always fun and interesting to watch.History itself is a star of the show, as we watch the sixties simmer and explode, much as Betty Draper herself.  To those of us who lived through those years, the backdrop is every bit as interesting as the characters themselves.

1193921,A106016KSI0YQ,B001GCUER0,Jay Dickson,"[3, 4]","The second season of MAD MEN is even better the first, which already established it as perhaps the best series to debut on American television in this decade. The pleasures are not simply in the plot (although it moves quickly and constantly surprises you) or in the acting (though it is also topnotch), but in the details: in some ways this series is the early 21st-century equivalent of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, in that it brings us back to a more conservative time among some very privileged and powerful New Yorkers, and immerses us completely in the precisely observed anthropological details of their lives. (The attention given to the clothes, hairstyles, design, and mores of the early Sixties period is, as in the previous season, breathtaking.) But here the top of the heap are not marked out as in the Wharton novel by familial connections (though those too are represented here--and shown to be largely dying out) but, as fitting the Kennedy era, by capitalistic endeavor.The series's central characters, by the beginning of the season, have achieved certain prizes for themselves, but all at a price. Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the creative head of the Madison Avenue agency Sterling Cooper, has been promoted to the position of partner. His beautiful blonde wife Betty (January Jones), has worked out some sort of arrangement with her husband after the first season's finale that he will no longer stray from her or be away for long unexplained periods. Roger Sterling (John Slattery), Don's  arrogant and entitled boss, has overcome two coronaries and is back in the office. His former mistress, the office manager Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks), finally has landed the handsome man with a bright career she's dreamed of finding, while her former charge in the secretarial pool, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) has climbed her way to become Sterling Cooper's first woman copywriter. Even the slimy Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), whom Don vanquished at the end of the previous season, is married to a woman who adores him and enjoys a Park Avenue apartment. But no one is happy, or willing to settle for what they have; they all feel they could somehow do better. Their ability to jeopardize everything they have for what more they might get is what makes the series so brilliant a commentary on the America of 1962. The best of the actors, Hamm, Slattery, and Holloway (and also Melinda McGraw as a new character, a Borscht Belt comedian's tough and sexy wife), disappear so into their characters you would be able to recognize them walking down the street just by their postures; the writers are up to the same high level, and most every gesture or line of dialogue has layers of meanings. (Pay attention, for example, to the multiple subtexts of a bit of business in the season's second episode, when Pete Campbell's mother, during the midst of a family crisis, insists on giving her daughter-in-law Trudy a porcelain elephant tchotchke.)One of the pleasures of this beautiful DVD set is that the series creator Matt Weiner provides commentary for almost all the episodes; he has such a firm sense of what he wanted to do with every scene that his commentary is terrific and tells you how almost everything you caught the first time round was intentional.

This season focuses on fleshing out the characters introduced in Season 1, so there is little new material.Don Draper/Dick Whitman seems to have come too far up the food chain to be a partner at Sterling Cooper before the age of 36 (even though John Hamm actually was 36 in 2007, when Season 1 was aired). Pitch him at 40, and I'll buy it. However, he does carry off his air of authority convincingly.

1193935,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B001GCUER0,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[13, 53]","The first season of Mad Men reached for greatness but was pulled down by its flaws. The second season is an embarrasing train wreck. All the flaws of the first season have now become the heart of the show. The premise has degenerated to a bunch of baby boomers telling us how great they are through a melodramatic story full of one-dimensional characters whose only purpose is to tell morality tales.The most telling scene is a picnic set-piece done in one episode. We have the idealic family picnic in the woods. But at the end of the picnic, the family simply shakes off their blanket dumping their trash on the ground and walking away. The scene is very dramatic but at same time completely inaccurate and almost unreal. The US had a little problem in that era, but it wasn't a litter problem involving rich families who didn't know what trash cans were. The typical litter problem of the era was people throwing things out of cars and treating roads like landfills. In every era there are of course people with no class who would dump picnic trash right on the ground, but that behavior carried through to the rest of their lives. It did end (as in the show) at the picnic grounds.  But thats the real problem. The picnic isn't about storytelling or building characters, its simply another set-piece ""morality moment"" in the show that ends up being untrue to the characters and the history of the era.Jon Hamm's brilliant portrayal of Don Draper in the first season has decended into self-parody. Where in most of the previous season he was a window into business of the era, in the second season he is nothing more than a pathetic punching bag. ""Betty"" is just pathetic. She is nothing more now than a collection of tired ""helpless women"" stereotypes. The relentless logic of the show is generally that men are evil and must be punished....while women are helpless victims of the world who we should cry endless tears of pity over.Elizabeth Moss's character Peggy is in many ways even more pathetic than Betty. After the stupidity of her giving birth without even knowing she was pregnant, what we get is more unreal melodrama. Peggy is supposed to be the 1960s uber-woman ushering in change. But the writers were utterly disinterested in making a real character out of her or trying to understand what such a person would be like. Peggy is supposed to be the rising star, but she is written as the classic affair secretary in the office complete with married man who really loves her and love-child. I mean in one breath we are supposed to believe that she is this smart and ultra-talented women who rises in advertising because she is so good. But at the same time she is supposed to be so thick that she is unaware of being pregnant up to the moment of giving birth.As for the rest, we get an office rape. We get a bunch of one-dimensional gay characters doing their piece of the morality play. We get another stereotype to show us how we should all eat right and exercise so we can successfully chase younger women when we are older. Its like they have a chart and every character has a ""problem"", a victim event and a path to redemption through a childish interpretation of the 1960s.What sad is that it could have all been so much better.

The second season feels very similar, and very different than the first.  The first season was fresh and something with great style.  However, when it ended I felt the story was complete.  As if they weren't sure if they would get a second season, and as such ended the story (though left it open if need be).  The second season greatly felt far more like it was done with the knowledge of a third and on season.  Really, it felt more like a set up for the third season than its own independent story.  New characters were introduced toward the end of the series, and large changes occured at the very end of the series, as if they were aware that the show would go on.That being said, the show improves in a lot of areas.  The characters certainly continue down whatever path they had, be it one of self discovery or instead finding status in a world that doesn't want to provide status to them.  I enjoyed some of the twists, and especially was impressed watching the disentegration of January Jones throughout the season.

The shockers (are they supposed to be shockers?) don't have the same impact as in the first season; in fact, as the finale drew to a close, I simply acknowledged it and moved on to buying season three.Don't get me wrong: it's a quality show, and very engaging. The writing and the characters are slick -- in fact, I'm sure a portion of the *lack* of shock is that I am getting such a feel for the characters that 'what happens next' feels very organic, rather than forced-for-shock-value.On another note: one of the things I like best from the first season to second, is that some of the sexism has mellowed out a bit. I'm not saying that I want to close my eyes to how bad it may or may not have been... but from an entertainment perspective, I started hating EVERYBODY because they're just all bad people. Season two brings it down to a level where I can like/dislike people without having my face ground into it, and I'm curious to see what happens next!O, and be sure to peruse the extras!

The attention to detail is stunning, the depth of character allows for repeated rewatchings, the topics dealt with still resonate today.The cast is a miracle. Jon Hamm is brilliant as Don Draper. You watch him in amazement when he acts and reacts in such a compelling way -- subtle changes in expression convey volumes. Season 2 was also a great year for January Jones, and it's shocking that she didn't receive an Emmy nomination as a reward for her convincing portrayal of a woman on the edge. Christina Hendricks and Elisabeth Moss also did a fabulous and memorable job. John Slattery is perfection as the smarmy, entitled jerk who you can't help but like. Vincent Kartheiser has also come a long way from his turn as Connor on Angel, playing to perfection the emotionally stunted character of Pete Campbell.The show doesn't have a lot -- or any -- explosions, except emotional ones. The interest is in the rich psychological lives of these people, most of whom are trying to hide their true identities in some way. Mad Men is for people who want a show that engages them and makes it worthwhile to pay close attention. It doesn't spoon feed answers, which makes it extra fun to analyze and interpret -- and your conclusions say a lot about you and your experiences.The extras here, and the same can be said of season 1, include an average of 2 commentaries per episode, and that's a boon for people who want to get behind the creative process of a show that rewards people who watch carefully. As always, some people are better at commentaries than others, but -- fortunately -- Matt Weiner and/or Elisabeth Moss are present on the majority of the tracks, and they always have good stuff to share.This show is a legend in the making and it's not too late for new-comers to catch up!",5,We're Very Lucky To Have This Show on TV!,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,1904,"['Mad', 'Men', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'could', 'stand', 'head-to-head', 'best', 'shows', 'era', 'attention', 'detail', 'stunning', 'depth', 'character', 'allows', 'repeated', 'rewatchings', 'topics', 'dealt', 'still', 'resonate', 'today.The', 'cast', 'miracle', 'Jon', 'Hamm', 'brilliant', 'Don', 'Draper', 'watch', 'amazement', 'when', 'reacts', 'such', 'compelling', 'way', 'subtle', 'changes', 'expression', 'convey', 'volumes', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'year', 'January', 'Jones', 'shocking', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'Emmy', 'nomination', 'reward', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'edge', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'also', 'did', 'fabulous', 'memorable', 'job', 'John', 'Slattery', 'perfection', 'smarmy', 'entitled', 'jerk', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'like', 'Vincent', 'Kartheiser', 'also', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'turn', 'Connor', 'Angel', 'playing', 'perfection', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'character', 'Pete', 'Campbell.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'explosions', 'emotional', 'ones', 'interest', 'rich', 'psychological', 'lives', 'people', 'most', 'whom', 'are', 'trying', 'hide', 'true', 'identities', 'way', 'Mad', 'Men', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'show', 'worthwhile', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', ""n't"", 'spoon', 'feed', 'answers', 'extra', 'fun', 'analyze', 'interpret', 'conclusions', 'say', 'lot', 'experiences.The', 'extras', 'here', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'season', '1', 'include', 'average', '2', 'commentaries', 'episode', 'boon', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'creative', 'process', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'carefully', 'always', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'commentaries', 'others', 'fortunately', 'Matt', 'Weiner', 'Elisabeth', 'Moss', 'are', 'present', 'majority', 'tracks', 'always', 'have', 'good', 'stuff', 'share.This', 'show', 'legend', 'making', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'new-comers', 'catch', 'up']",Mad Men: Season 2

Judging from the first two seasons, Matthew Weiner and the rest of the ""Mad Men"" crew are putting in a strong bid for the title of Greatest Television Program of All Time. As some previous reviewers have remarked, a lot of sins from Season 1 are coming home to roost in Season 2. We see the already troubled marriage of Don and Betty Draper (Jon Hamm, January Jones) turn rockier still; the struggles of Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) with her family and her Catholic faith; the continuing workplace humiliation of the shrewd, unflappable Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks); the increasing cold-bloodedness of Roger Sterling (John Slattery), Peter Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser), ""Duck"" Phillips (Mark Moses), and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse). The characters are endlessly fascinating, the dialogue subtle and sharp, the period recreation of the early 1960s miraculous. The storyline takes surprising yet completely believable turns, and the cast is so great that my favorite actor on the show tends to be the one I happen to be watching at the time.My only caveat: ""Mad Men,"" like ""Deadwood,"" is not a show you can pick up by watching a random episode. To know what's going on and get the show's full impact, you need to begin at the beginning and progress in a completely orderly fashion.

As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 5 seasons now.Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on the real life ad men Draper Daniels and Rosser Reeves). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones as Don's wife), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the 50's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes season 2. There are three more. Season 6 is eminent whereas season 7 has already been green-lighted. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it.

This series won Emmy's for best actor and best dramatic series and a ton of other awards. Deals with Madison Avenue account executives at fictitious Sterling Cooper, first year covers 1960, second 1962. For those who remember, this series is astoundingly accurate in it's depiction of mores, attitudes, clothing styles of the time, perhaps more so than any other movie or series  I've ever seen. Ad guys swill liquor in their offices, shoot around ad ideas, flirt with and occasionally diddle secretaries in the office. Company Men in grey flannel suits, and women in red lipstick, full dresses with yards of crinolines, stockings and spike heels. It's a man's world! The Ad men smoke like proverbial chimneys. Everyone smokes. Women are housewives or sexy secretaries. Blacks are elevator operators, and maids. Gays don't exist. There is a great deal of insight into how Madison Avenue did (and still does) use our desires for happiness to manipulate and distort products thru advertizing. The Lucky Strike ""toasted"" ads (in season one)are a great example.I have read where reviewers, younger ones, don't believe Mad Men. Well, if it's an exaggeration, it isn't an exaggeration by much. Some things are done for dramatic effect, to emphasis the difference between then and now - but this really was the times! In the second season, Peggy Moss, the plucky secretary who breaks into the all male account execs, gets invited to hear a Bob Dylan concert. The backdrop of historical events, racial problems, freedom riders, the space race, Marilyn Monroe, Kennedy and Nixon, sets off the action. Even the extra feature time capsules are fascinating. Jon Hamm, who my wife tells me is really handsome, plays Don Draper, the beleaguered, mysterious, complex, womanizing head of Creative at Sterling Cooper and won best actor. January Jones plays Betsy, his Barbie Doll wife. She appears in a swanky restaurant looking like a goddess, Don gazes at her and Rimsky Korsakov's lush ""Song of India"" starts playing (repeatedly in following episodes). When Betsy finds her young daughter smoking cigarettes in the closet, she diciplines her, not for taking a dangerous addictive drug, but because she might burn the house down being careless!""The Times, They are a Changin'"",  and this is a remarkable look at how things were just before they did!This series, can't be too highly recommended in a time when many movies are disappointing!  It's really the best thing out there, by a mile. Start from the beginning, season one, or it won't make sense. Very complex plots with a hundred plot lines at once.

This season spends it's thirteen episodes expanding upon what has already been established at the same time as it balances sudden new story devices and taking things to their next logical (or sometimes illiogical based on the character) extensions. I found it very enjoyable and while it may not be a full reflection of life in the sixies it truly shows the aspects that it aspires to quite well and shows flawed characters who are full of unfortunate parallels with people in the world today.This is a show that is telling a specific story while exploring specific character's in an attempt to disect certain issues within our world today. I look at this show as a reflection of recent times, the issue of never being happy with what you have and looking for happiness in the wrong places and feeling lost and unsure of your place in the world is something I see a lot of people dealing with in the world around me. The setting of the sixties is almost the perfect era to pair with such seemingly lost and depressed character's because of it's ironic nature at the same time as the literal sense of reinvention and change that occured in that time.I feel the first season did a fantastic job of setting up this series. The second season acheived it's goal of expanding, elaborating and extending upon the world and character's we were introduced to. The third season is set up, like most shows, to take the best from the first and second seasons and finally show us a complete vision of the show without being tied down by these mandatory practices.The second season contains the following 13 Episodes:1 For Those Who Think Young2 Flight 13 The Benefactor4 Three Sundays5 The New Girl6 Maidenform7 The Gold Violin8 A Night to Remember9 Sixth Month Leave10 The Inheritance11 The Jet Set12 The Mountain King13 Meditations in an EmergencyThis DVD release will be a 4-disc set presented in Anamorphic Widescreen Video, English Dolby 5.1 Audio, with Subtitles in English & Spanish along with closed captioning for the hearing impaired.The Packaging for both the DVD and Blu-Ray is described as being ""available as a limited-edition sleek shirt box with see through window"".Special Features Announced So Far Include:-Audio Commentaries With Cast & Crew on all 13 Episodes-""Birth Of An Independent Woman Parts 1 & 2"" - Featurette examining the rise of female independence in the 60's.-""An Era Of Style"" - Featurette exploring the fashion of the 1960's and it's lasting influence on designer's today.-""Time Capsule"" - Interactive featurettes paying homage to historic events on the 1960's and the daring generation that lived through them.I will update my review when/if any more special features or information are given closer to July, when this will be released.

1193957,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001GCUER0,Robert Moore,"[102, 117]","Update (1/11/09):  MAD MEN just won the Golden Globe for the second straight year for Best Drama.  Well deserved.Frankly, I'm pretty despondent about the future of quality TV on the major four networks.  The recent cancellation by ABC of the breathtakingly brilliant PUSHING DAISIES was the first major blow.  When a show this great can get cancelled for weak (not genuinely bad, merely weak) ratings, you feel that something has gone wrong with commercial television.  For one thing, TV history is resplendent with shows that started off weakly and then succeeded a couple of years into their run.  THE X-FILES, SEINFELD, THE OFFICE, and 30 ROCK all started off with weak ratings, only to build an audience later.  The second horrific piece of news undermining my confidence in commercial TV was NBC's announcement that starting next year Jay Leno will get FIVE HOURS (!) of prime time for a more politically oriented version of his talk show.  First, why would we want Leno when we already have Stewart and Colbert? Second, this means losing FIVE HOURS (!!!!) of scripted programming on NBC each week.  This is a recipe for disaster.  And an act of despair.  NBC clearly doesn't think it can produce 15 hours of quality TV a week, so it is trying to produce only 10 and then take the super cheap option with Leno.  NBC, I have news for you:  you get what you pay for.MAD MEN could well be the model for successful quality TV shows in the future.  Although it gets very low ratings, on AMC it is safe from cancellation because of its widespread critical acclaim.  More and more, niche cable networks seem to be the place where quality TV series manage to thrive and avoid the constant threat of cancellation.  AMC in fact has two superb series, MAD MEN and the very promising BREAKING BAD (which was seriously truncated by the writers' strike last year) and they've announced a new Sci-fi series based upon Kim Stanley Robinson's acclaimed Mars trilogy, about the settling of colonies on Mars.  The series is taking its title from the first of Robinson's novels, RED MARS.So, while I'm on the verge of giving up on ABC, NBC, and FOX (though under new head of programming Kevin Reilly its shows have become more interesting and he has so far resisted to kill shows prematurely as his predecessors did).  CBS I gave up on years ago, since the network seems content to churn out an endless number of bland police procedurals.  AMC, F/X, Showtime, HBO, ABC Family, the Sci Fi Channel, and similar networks may be where we all go in the future for the best shows.MAD MEN became the first show not on one of the big four networks or HBO to win the Emmy for Best Drama this past summer.  It will almost certainly win again this coming summer, since Season Two was even better than Season One.  Moreover, during Season Two the show started building a buzz, culminating with a great appearance by Jon Hamm on SNL, including a skit with some of his MAD MEN guest stars.  The show became part of our cultural sensibility, inspiring magazine photo spreads.  I still think the show is one that people tend to know about rather than know.  Thankfully people who do not have access to AMC can catch up on DVD (I watch it as it comes out, but my cable company shows AMC in low-def rather than high-def, so much of the show's physical beauty can only be recaptured on DVD or Blu-ray).As good as the show was in Season Two, the sophomore season was even more brilliant.  In my review of Season One, I mentioned that Jon Hamm's character Don Draper exemplifies Thoreau's statement that most people live ""lives of quiet desperation.""  In Season Two, Hamm and his carefully constructed existence gradually begins coming apart at the seams.  His Stepford Wife Betty begins to come apart at more than the seams.  I really enjoyed January Jones in Season One, but primarily she was a beautiful manikin.  In Season Two the human being inside is psychically rebelling against the roles she is being forced to play and the result is someone who is on the verge of collapse.  One scene in particular was compelling.  As she prepares for a dinner party she notices that one of the dining room chairs is wobbly.  Moving the chair back and forth gives way to anger, as she displaces the stress of her life onto the chair and she begins to destroy and obliterate it.  Indeed, the many moments where Betty loses control are among the season's finest.January Jones's amazing performance as Betty gets a bit less acclaim than she deserves in part because of Elizabeth Moss's job as Peggy Olson.  I think many people watching MAD MEN began in Season Two to realize that Peggy, as much as Don Draper, was central to the meaning of the show.  I have very little evidence for this, but I believe that the show will end with Peggy Olson heading Sterling Cooper.  The show started with her first day as an employee of the company, working as Don Draper's secretary.  We've seen her become a successful copywriter for the company and at the end of Season Two even has the office next to Don's.  I believe that a logical ending of the series, mapping al the changes that took place in national sensibilities in the sixties, would be for Peggy to become head of the company that at the start of the year was so completely male dominated.  This does not mean, however, that Peggy's personal life has kept pace with her professional life.  In fact, Peggy remains a bit of a mess.  The season did end, however, with perhaps the best scene in the entire run of the show so far.  Peter tells Peggy that he hates his marriage and that he loves her.  Shockingly, Peggy tells him that she had had his baby and given it away.  My feeling was that in telling Peter she was not trying to be cruel so much as she was trying to definitively close the door on one part of her life and open another.  Peggy is one of the most wonderfully complex characters on TV.  While Don Draper has artfully created a public self, Peggy has not.  She has primarily resisted the roles that people have tried to provide for her.  She has not yet become her own person, but you feel that she might.  I also find her and Don Draper's relationship to be delightful.  They are not close friends or perhaps not even friends.  But a flashback in which Don visits her in the hospital when she is suffering from post-partum depression (intensified by the fact that she didn't even know she was pregnant) and essentially orders her to get her act together and get out of the hospital.  Don is not always presented as a good person, but he has his moments, and the tough love he gives Peggy at the moment helps her turn her life around.I mention Don, Betty, and Peggy, but one of the delights of MAD MEN is the very deep cast of characters.  Joan Holloway (played by the beautiful Christina Hendricks) has a new fianc&eacute;, but it doesn't appear to be the healthiest of relationships (one of the most shocking moments in Season Two occurs when he rapes her in Sterling Cooper offices).  The deeply closeted Salvatore starts gradually to confront his own sexuality and his attraction to men, including a coworker, while his ""beard"" marriage struggles.  Roger Sterling struggles to overcome health problems in order to marry a much, much younger woman.But at the heart of the show Don Draper remains the dominant character.  Jon Hamm's performance as Don has been brilliant from the very beginning.  On ""Fresh Air with Terry Gross"" series creator Matthew Weiner explained that Hamm instantly stood out in auditions, but the network wanted an established actor in the role.  They were adamant that they did not want an unknown actor in the show's central role.  Weiner finally issued an ultimatum, that without Jon Hamm as Don Draper, he was unwilling to proceed with the series.  Weiner's wisdom in casting Hamm has been proven many times over.  It is almost impossible to imagine this show without him.  Don is one of the most artificial and complex characters in the history of TV.  Just as he creates ad campaigns, so he has created the persona Don Draper.  Season Two shows Draper having serious doubts about whether he wants to persist in playing the character he has created for himself.I read a bit over a year ago that the plan for the show was to move a couple of years into the future with each ensuing season.  If so, Season Three should pick up sometime past the Kennedy assassination, perhaps with the early part of the Vietnam War.  Clearly the show intends to reflect the enormous social upheaval that took place in the decade.  It also represents many of the now almost comic aspects of the pre-sixties world.  For instance, in one scene Don, Betty, and their kids are enjoying a picnic on a blanket in a lovely country locale.  As they finish, Don stands up and shakes all of their trash off the blanket and onto the ground.  This was very definitely before Lady Bird Johnson's attempt to beautify America by picking up trash.  I'm sure that Season Three will show many new changes.This is easily one of the 3 or 4 best shows on TV.  I put it up there with my own favorites PUSHING DAISIES, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and LOST.  Notice that of those shows PUSHING DAISIES was on ABC and has been cancelled, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was on DirecTV in the fall and will be on NBC in the winter and spring, and LOST begins its penultimate season on ABC.  I think in the future fewer and fewer of my favorite shows will be originating on the big four.  AMC, with MAD MEN leading the way, is one of the last, best hopes for television",5,One of TV's best shows gets even better,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",2009,9575,"['Update', '1/11/09', 'MAD', 'MEN',

1193960,A6FIAB28IS79,B001GCUER0,Samuel Chell,"[3, 4]","This is the first television series I've seen that feels like a theatrical movie rather than another jittery, overly busy, manipulative made-for TV video, with frequently good acting wasted on formulaic, or non-existent plots relying upon sensation, violence, and cheap digital effects to hook and maintain the viewer's interest.  Moreover, the characters are not cardboard stereotypes but multidimensional and complex.  Women viewers need not feel guilty about watching it on the basis of qualities that will undeniably attract a large female audience: the compelling if not magnetic quality of the flawed but strong and reassuringly attractive lead, John Hamm, who plays the ultra-cool ad man Don Draper (he's got the right charisma to anchor an entire James Bond movie series); the representation of women in the 1960's, a period that requires a woman to be at once a ""toy doll,"" a ""perfect housewife,"" and of course an absolutely competent secretary, who has nothing but time on her hands to perform her duties with mechanical precision, never failing with the proper smile or facial expression at the proper time.The primary subject of Season Two continues to be Madison Avenue and the ruthless world of selling and buying.  The game of ""programming"" consumers to consume intensifies, with the spoils going to the winner (who now faces the challenge of not being consumed by his own success).  But the stakes are now higher, deepened and made more complex by company mergers and staff turn-overs.  And while ""age-ism"" becomes the source of character biases and motivation, the series continues to focus most heavily on one exploited group. While people of every race, religion, and status are subject to failure in the ruthlessly competitive, Darwinian struggle, the series suggests (and increasingly less subtlely) that if one group has suffered the most unfairness--to the point of being excluded from the free-enterprise game itself--it's women. By the 1980s, the protests concerning injustices suffered by women were too loud and frequent to be ignored, especially in the academic world. But ""Mad Men"" probes deeper, exposing the very sources of unrest among women in the 1960s--not on college campuses but in the more ""mature"" world of Madison Avenue professionals. Without resorting to propaganda or sensationalism, the series makes it possible for any attentive viewer, whether female or male, to experience a startling wake-up call, a revelation made all the more powerful by the filmmakers' artistry, which allows viewers to make the discovery for themselves, or to ""construct"" an interpretation that consequently becomes the viewer's own understanding rather than a didactic finger-pointing lesson (the approach of the majority of shows that continually scapegoat child-molesters, internet child predators, sexual deviants, serial killers, drug lords and other ""safe"" objects of blame).This theme of the objectification and belittlement of women (nothing so obvious as ""harassment"") culminates in a chilling episode, appropriately titled ""A Night to Remember""--episode 8 from the 2nd season (2008), The episode is a cinematic tour deforce, thus far the most ambitious chapter in a series that seems to be reinventing itself as it goes along, always improving. This particular segment is like vintage Robert Altman in its cross-cutting among the three women who have received the most attention. The time, historically, is the days immediately following news of Marilyn Monroe's suicide, and each of the three women--Joan, the queen-secretary who is herself a combination of keen intelligence in an hour-glass figure; Betty, the manipulated, blonde showgirl/perfect housewife/showcase trophy of Don Draper; Peggy, the innocent ""country girl"" who has wised-up sufficiently to the ways of men to play their game, attaining power to make decisions that will influence consumers throughout the nation--each of the three will receive potentially shattering epiphanies, showing them the emptiness of their programmed existences in a male-run world that expects of them only compliance along with adoration beyond any they themselves might receive for their physical attributes. The realizations of all three occur in a breath-taking ""tour de force"" of characterization. The potent mix of minimalist but thoughtful script-writing, artful directing, and ""parallel"" editing allows the viewer to receive the full force of three separate ""actions"" (actually, internal ""epiphanies"") occurring simultaneously.Needless to say, the women who ""succeed"" are those who are, by definition, academy-award winning actresses, either landing a man who is a paid ticket to a suburban castle with earning children (and servants to help out) or, miraculously, carving out a place where they are recognized for their actual abilities, talents and potential.Episode 8 of the 2nd season (2008) is, thus far, the most ambitious single episode of a series that seems to be reinventing itself as it goes along, always improving.  This particular episode is like vintage Robert Altman in its cross-cutting between the three women who have received most of the viewer's attention.  The time, historically, is the days immediately following news of Marilyn Monroe's suicide, and each of the three woman--Joan, the queen-secretary who is keen intelligence in an hour-glass figure; Betty, the manipulated, blonde showgirl/perfect housewife/trophy of Don Draper; Peggy, the innocent ""country girl"" who has wised-up sufficiently to the ways of men to be omitted to some of their decisions that will influence consumers throughout the nation--each of the three will receive potentially shattering epiphanies, showing them the emptiness of their programmed existences in a male-run world that expects of them only compliance along with adoration beyond any they themselves might receive.  The impact at this point is least felt by Joan but numerous subtleties expose her gradual awakening; Peggy's comes as a result of the hypocritical, self-serving actions of her Parish Priest, who doesn't even know how to play the man's game that she has by now mastered; Betty's is the most disturbing of all--to her as well as the viewer.  She is at this moment no less than Nora Krogstad from Ibsen's ""A Doll's House."" She has been shattered by the discovery of Don's philandering, his lies, his use of her as a means to his own career ends.  At first we see the life literally drained from her former color, a ghostly apparition about to follow Marilyn Monroe to a similar dark place.  But then the sight of a particular television ad and actor triggers her dramatic action: she calls her husband Don at work and, in a reversal of Nora's slamming the door of her ""doll house,"" tells Don never to come home.  She no longer has any use for this stranger.Most of the above occurs in a mere five minutes--a tour de force of characterization through script-writing, directing and ""parallel editing"" (cross-cuts).  It's only the last 20-30 seconds of the episode that become a bit didactic, or over-done, as the Priest's picking up a guitar and singing a song about salvation, felt by the viewers as his release from his own sexual frustrations, dominates the soundtrack, segueing into a ""production number"" as the episode fades to black.The series represents the early '60s with stunning verisimilitude, not only in its portrayal of male-female relationships in and outside the workplace but in the continuous gauzy veil of smoke thrown off by the chain-smoking characters along with the ubiquitous portable bar in the office of each hard-drinking executive.  Most of the ""action"" is internal yet riveting, occurring on a large office stage that seems both capacious and capable of showing the viewer surprises and new discoveries with each episode.  The colors are richly saturated--a technicolor effect representative of movies of the day (not the faded, irridescent reds, blues, and greens that would replace the slower technicolor process beginning in the late '60s with ""Easy Rider"" and continuing throughout the 1970s), the resolution has a sharpness that will score heavily with big screen viewers at home; the camera work--striking angles but a steady camera with shots of sufficient duration to allow the spectator to see each crucial detail--has the professional quality of a bonafide filmmaker ""auteur"" such as Douglas Sirk.I had given up on television--turning for relief to the talking heads on MSNBC or mindless reality shows like ""Pawn Stars"" and ""American Pickers.""  But this series, sponsored appropriately enough by the American Movie Classics channel, is the most refreshing television drama since ""All in the Family."" We should all hope that it represents a new beginning rather than an anomaly, as unique and distinguished as it is.",5,"Artful filmmaking meets the flat-screen, hi-def wasteland: Ibsen's ""A Doll's

While the roster of hits may not be as deep as HBO's, ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Mad Men"" belong on the short list of Great TV Series from the last two decades.With Season Two, ""Mad Men"" builds on the stellar foundation laid by Season One.  I'll leave the recapping of the tale to others, but I will say that the deeper exploration of the characters of ""Mad Men"" is a worthwhile enterprise.""Mad Men"" starts and stops with Don Draper - just who the heck is he?  The perfection of the man's profile is only exceeded by his life - gorgeous dutiful wife, the requisite number of kids, the ability to bag almost any woman he sees, and command of his job.  What more can a man in the early 60s ask for?  But it's clear that behind that stoic demeanor and clenched jaw there is a seething mass of rage and uncertainty - Don is not as ice-cold as his icy stare would indicate.Sure, there's lots of fun to be had with the time period - we get to see ""new"" products such as Clearasil and the Kodak slide carousel along with the period-appropriate womanizing, boozing, and fashion.  But ""Mad Men"" is far more than an observant time capsule of a bygone era.  It is an exploration of the men and women who lived seemingly perfect lives but were all too flawed and human inside the armor of their movie-star looks and their Manhattan cool.Season Two wanders pretty far afield as we learn the Story of Don, and it's a fun wandering.

Although the title is explicitly in reference to Don's new secretary, Jane, it is his relationship with his former secretary and pioneering woman copywriter Peggy that is the centerpiece of this episode.  It is Peggy who Don calls to bail him out of a drunk driving arrest while out with the wife of comic and client Jimmy Barrett.  Don's falling back on his standard and signature modus operandi of ""forgetting"" troubling past events, evokes an illuminating flashback in which Don visits Peggy in the hospital after she gives birth to the illegitimate child fathered by Pete Campbell.  As he sits by her bedside Don strongly urges a traumatized Peggy to ""forget"" what had happened and move forward.  This scene, more than any other that I can call to mind, evokes a caring side of Don that one might never expect to see.

Not much other than if you loved the quality of shows like Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Big Love, and others of that caliber, you will not be disappointed.Set in early 1960's NYC at a mid-sized advertising agency, the show explores a very seminal time in our recent history when so many things were called into question and so much of our culture was shifting away from 1950's conformity-- toward civil rights, woman's rights, a deep distrust of government, loss of innocence, and a growing social and political instability. The way it treats the realities of business (then and now) is also about as honest and accurate as anything I've ever seen in a TV series. All of this history is woven into highly charged dramatic stories that develop and explore these shifts through incredibly well-drawn characters that reflect these ideas-- and without ever losing site of their basic humanity. Never boring or irrelevant, and amazingly well-produced, there are few shows that have ever come to television that can match this. It is worth every minute of your time. This show was filmed in HD and the Blu-ray release is pure joy to watch-- unlike HDTV broadcasts and standard def versions blu-ray reveals details in lighting (some of the best I've ever seen) and texture (the clothes in particular) that are just not visible under any other format.",5,"Unique, important, and rivoting-- few shows have ever reached this level",1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1413,"['What', 'can', 'add', 'many', 'already', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'series', 'Not', 'much', 'other', 'loved', 'quality', 'shows', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Sopranos', 'Big', 'Love', 'others', 'caliber', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.Set', 'early', '1960', 'NYC', 'mid-sized', 'advertising', 'agency', 'show', 'very', 'seminal', 'time', 'recent', 'history', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'called', 'question', 'so', 'much', 'culture', 'was', 'shifting', 'away', '1950', 'conformity', 'civil', 'rights', 'woman', 'rights', 'deep', 'distrust', 'government', 'loss', 'innocence', 'growing', 'social', 'political', 'instability', 'way', 'realities', 'business', 'then', 'now', 'also', 'about', 'honest', 'accurate', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'history', 'woven', 'highly', 'charged', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'develop', 'explore', 'shifts', 'incredibly', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'reflect', 'ideas', 'ever', 'losing', 'site', 'basic', 'humanity', 'Never', 'boring', 'irrelevant', 'amazingly', 'well-produced', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'come', 'television', 'can', 'match', 'worth', 'minute', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'filmed', 'HD', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'pure', 'joy', 'watch', 'HDTV', 'broadcasts', 'standard', 'def', 'versions', 'blu-ray', 'reveals', 'details', 'lighting', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'texture', 'clothes', 'particular', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'visible', 'other', 'format']",Mad Men: Season 2

This second season, while not becoming totally irrelevant by any means, severely lacks the ""punch"" of that original slate of episodes.In terms of the overall plot, this second season focuses on pretty much the same characters as the first.  Donald Draper (Jon Hamm) is always at the center of things, while secretary-turned-copywriter Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) gets a lot more screen time in this season.  Up-and-comer Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) and dutiful (but frustrated) Draper wife Betty (January Jones) also garner major plotlines of their own.  The usual supporting cast is present, augmented by new ad man Duck Phillips (Mark Moses).The trouble with this season is that whereas the previous season emphasized the period (1960s) and the location (Madison Avenue ad agency), this season focuses almost exclusively on the characters themselves.  That first season was just so slick and allowed the viewer to feel as if they truly were living in that 1960s time period.  In this second season, though, that period luster seems to wear off in the face of almost a soap-operatic slew of plotlines.Though disappointed by the sophomore effort of ""Mad Men"", I'm not giving up on this interesting show quite yet.  It still intrigues me just enough to keep clicking the ""PLAY"" button again and again.
