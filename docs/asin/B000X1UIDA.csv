The subtitles are great accept for the last episode the camera changes (the picture is still good) and the subs are a bit slack....which is a little piss off cause the rest of the episodes are so good.,4,Hana Kimi,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,293,"['tv', 'series', 'are', 'amazingly', 'funny', 'recommend', 'japanese', 'drama', 'one', 'top', 'ones', 'subtitles', 'are', 'great', 'last', 'episode', 'camera', 'changes', 'picture', 'still', 'good', 'subs', 'are', 'bit', 'slack', '.which', 'little', 'piss', 'cause', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'good']",Japanese Drama : Hanazakari No Kimitachi E w/ English Subtitle

1112981,AA14STLBMT82U,B000X1UIDA,Elizabeth,"[0, 0]","This is a lovely show. The Taiwanese adaptation is horrible; this Japanese one is way better! The plot is heart-warming; the story and acting plays out like a manga come to life; its humorous and cute and contains drama that is not too over the top. I highly recommend it also for those of us who are interested in the Japanese culture and who are trying to learn the language. (Those who are familiar with the manga it was based off of will find more than a few things that are different.) The subbing was well recieved except for episode 12 (the final episode) which does seem like it was translated by a Chinese student who is barely learning english. I say Chinese because when one character refers to another by name, the subtitles spell out a chinese name such as Lu Rui Xi instead of Mizuki (the name of the main character). The only thing that saddens me is that it does not include the special episode (episode 13 if you will). Overall, its worth buying!",4,Satisfied,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,963,"['lovely', 'show', 'Taiwanese', 'adaptation', 'horrible', 'Japanese', 'one', 'way', 'better', 'plot', 'heart-warming', 'story', 'acting', 'plays', 'out', 'manga', 'come', 'life', 'humorous', 'cute', 'drama', 'not', 'too', 'top', 'highly', 'recommend', 'also', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'learn', 'language', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'manga', 'was', 'based', 'will', 'find', 'more', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'subbing', 'was', 'well', 'recieved', 'episode', '12', 'final', 'episode', 'seem', 'was', 'translated', 'Chinese', 'student', 'who', 'barely', 'learning', 'english', 'say', 'Chinese', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'refers', 'name', 'subtitles', 'spell', 'out', 'chinese', 'name', 'such', 'Lu', 'Rui', 'Xi', 'instead', 'Mizuki', 'name', 'main', 'character', 'only', 'thing', 'not', 'include', 'special', 'episode', '13', 'will', 'Overall', 'worth', 'buying']",Japanese Drama : Hanazakari No Kimitachi E w/ English Subtitle

It was extremely comical just watching how much mischief the three dorms were getting into all the time. It was probably one of the goofier shows I've seen in awhile.
