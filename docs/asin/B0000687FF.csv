It has an actual plot with a shinning moral fiber that the bulk of movies and tv have been lacking for several years. At it's core, this tale is about family and life lessons. It is heart-warming yet serious.Maxwell and Decker, the two mentoring elders for the spoiled teen are my favorite characters--because they both have steel-coated convictions but gentle hearts. Decker's son was a nice touch because due to being a youngling he found it a bit easier to relate to the 'city kid'.I loved the culture contrast, the horses, and the emphasis on heart this film exemplifies.

704216,A1LCCW8M6F5TJU,B0000687FF,"L. Pacheco ""BHOC""","[37, 44]","Teen actor, Chris Olivero, and Hollywood legend, Richard Crenna, deliver outstanding and believable performances in this coming of age movie about a bratty, California kid, Mike Lewis (Olivero), who is shipped off to visit his grandfather, Ben Maxwell (Crenna), in Colorado.  While there, the argumentative and often smart-aleck Lewis, stirs up enough trouble for the town and his kindhearted grandfather.  After several confrontations, the disrespectful grandson decides he wants to return to his spoiled lifestyle in Los Angeles.  His grandfather agrees, but decides the two will travel to California by way of horseback.  A disgruntled Lewis, tries his hardest to come up with every excuse to avoid the trek to the Pacific coast, but finds himself on the losing end of the battle.  Shortly after their journey begins, they meet up with a group of Ben Maxwell's longtime friends, who together, take Maxwell's grandson on the journey of a lifetime by exposing him to down-to-earth western values and hard-working morals.  After many trials along the trail, lessons are learned and Lewis and his grandfather discover something about each other they never expected.  The film is laced with thought-provoking topics, incredible chemistry, outstanding performances, and certainly the greater values in life that founded our nation.  Just short of Oscar caliber for Crenna, this film is highly recommended for all!

704221,A3PU7FTXV8MSC4,B0000687FF,Tom From Pgh,"[1, 1]","The last starring role of Richard Crenna's career (although he had a supporting role in 2003 Out Of The Ashes and made several guest appearances on the TV show Judging Amy afterwards), this family film is a perfect spotlight for his talents, as he plays an ageing grandfather trying to re connect with his adult daughter and get to know his only grandson.Taking the grandson in for the summer seems like a nice way to make good with his daughter but it doesn't take long for the quiet, conservative, horse riding cowboy Grandfather to clash with his troubled, spoiled, teen age grandson. Exhausting his patience, he decides to take the boy and a trip back home - by horseback, hoping the long trip from COL to CA will give them a chance to connect and grow close.  Along the way they meet up with some of grandfather's old friends, and slowly the youngster starts to appreciate his grand dad, especially given the level of respect and esteem everyone seems to hold him in. It doesn't happen over night, but kid does slowly start to come around, admitting some of the problems he has relating to his mom and dad as his grandfather relates why he and the boy's mom spent so long on the outs.Later in the film the drama kicks up a bit when we realize Crenna's character is dying (something he has known all along but hidden from everyone else), but by then the audience is hooked waiting to see if he can truly get through to his good hearted, but immature grandson before they finish their trip (if he can stay healthy enough to make it).The supporting cast is strong but Crenna is the most engaging, this is a movie that can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages. There is some humor thrown in periodically to keep the film from getting too dark or down, overall a highly recommended family film and a definite &#34;Must Have&#34; for any Richard Crenna fan.",5,Richard Crenna Scores With Late Career Role,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1854,"['last', 'starring', 'role', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'career', 'had', 'supporting', 'role', '2003', 'Ashes', 'made', 'several', 'guest', 'appearances', 'TV', 'show', 'Judging', 'Amy', 'afterwards', 'family', 'film', 'perfect', 'spotlight', 'talents', 'ageing', 'grandfather', 'trying', 're', 'connect', 'adult', 'daughter', 'get', 'know', 'only', 'grandson.Taking', 'grandson', 'summer', 'nice', 'way', 'make', 'good', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'quiet', 'conservative', 'horse', 'riding', 'cowboy', 'Grandfather', 'clash', 'troubled', 'spoiled', 'teen', 'age', 'grandson', 'Exhausting', 'patience', 'take', 'boy', 'trip', 'back', 'home', 'horseback', 'hoping', 'long', 'trip', 'COL', 'CA', 'will', 'give', 'chance', 'connect', 'grow', 'close', 'way', 'meet', 'up', 'grandfather', 'old', 'friends', 'slowly', 'youngster', 'appreciate', 'grand', 'dad', 'especially', 'given', 'level', 'respect', 'esteem', 'everyone', 'hold', ""n't"", 'happen', 'night', 'kid', 'slowly', 'start', 'come', 'around', 'admitting', 'problems', 'relating', 'mom', 'dad', 'grandfather', 'why', 'boy', 'mom', 'spent', 'so', 'long', 'outs.Later', 'film', 'drama', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'realize', 'Crenna', 'character', 'dying', 'something', 'known', 'hidden', 'everyone', 'else', 'then', 'audience', 'hooked', 'waiting', 'see', 'can', 'truly', 'get', 'good', 'hearted', 'immature', 'grandson', 'finish', 'trip', 'can', 'stay', 'healthy', 'enough', 'make', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong', 'Crenna', 'most', 'engaging', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'wide', 'range', 'ages', 'humor', 'thrown', 'periodically', 'keep', 'film', 'getting', 'too', 'dark', 'down', 'highly', 'recommended', 'family', 'film', 'definite', '34', 'Must', 'Have', '34', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'fan']",By Dawn's Early Light
