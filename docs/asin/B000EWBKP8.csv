It would begin at 7:00 and run until 2 AM. This is how I fell in love with ALF. Every Sunday I put this dvd series in and try to remember how good it was before they wrecked the line-up. That lineup had it all, for us classic tv fans; everything from WKRP to Bewitched and The Honeymooners, to name a few. I have never been able to convince the managers to start this up again. There was always the lame excuse of it coming down to decisions from the supplier. WHAT?? Since when does a buyer not call the shots. It's like me going into a store and the manager tells me I'm going to buy a SPEEDO or else. I wanted a pair of Levi's. I only wish that enough of us readers here could get together and insist that they bring back the classic line-up.ALF has become one of my favorite shows and I'm hoping that they find some lost episodes. The acting ranges from so-so to excellent. I have to give the parents and the son a two star rating, as well as the neighbors, the Oggmonicks? Five star ratings go out to Andrea Elson, whom I never remembered as being such a ""babe"". Aside from that, try to catch her expressions of impatience and mild anger. Those looks are authentic.

979512,A3OTPC2QV17093,B000EWBKP8,J. Bongiorno,"[7, 8]","Season 3 sees the show reach its peak as it begins to weave in more complex storylines amidst the comedic situations.  With two seasons behind them, Paul Fusco and the actors hit their stride and are completely comfortable with their characters.  Thus, there's a naturalness to everyone's performances.  Alf is for all intents and purposes real.  Also, with Alf's clumsiness and general mayhem more subdued (after being the focus for two seasons), the show is able to actually touch upon far more serious fair without sacrificing the traditional Alf style of humor.  Concepts such as losing (or clinging to)moral integrity (My Back Pages), fear of absolesence (Baby Love, Stairway to Heaven), abject loneliness (Alone Again Naturally, Standing in the Shadows of Love), catastrophic expectation (Shake, Rattle and Roll), and even grief and death (funeral for a friend).  Even those episodes that aren't as weighty have more complex and intresting elements, eg., ""Like an Old Time Movie"" which has Alf and Jake constructing a script starring the Tanners that plays out like an old silent movie (and brilliantly so); ""Have You Seen My Mother Baby"" has Jake confront his mother who he discovers is a thief; ""Running Scared"" deals with a blackmailer inside the FBI...  There's a lot of really good writing going on this season!ALF was a show that always mixed somewhat childlike (or childish depending on your POV) low-brow humor with heart, but with the third season and the onset of far more somber themes, the show actually transcends its premise and becomes something much more affecting.  And as a result, the humor is that much funnier, emerging as it does from human emotions and situations.  Alf's fears of being the only one of his kind is genuinely moving; his concerns that we should savor life because we all might ""croak"" tomorrow is touching because it's real; his sorrow at the fact that a new infant in the house will leave him without any attention or love is understandable (it's also a great thematic continuity nod to the second season's episode about the lost dog.)Some will complain because all they want out of the show are the more crass elements (Alf burping and breaking things), while others will deride the fact that the producers and writers even attempt to rise above the show's ""station"" as basically junk TV.  But what the critics fail to see is that ALF is essentially escapist entertainment -- and there is a place for that -- but not one without heart, and not one that can't at times touch upon the human condition.  And when the show does rise to more complex themes, it works and it works well, becoming funnier and more memorable.The bottom line is that ALF is great family entertainment that won't leave you feeling brain-dead or like you've ingested too many sugar substitutes.  The only criticism is the DVD release itself which presents the edited syndicated versions (which had to cut some scenes to make room for more commercials.)  The show is still great, but it's unfortunate to not have the full versions.",4,Best Season of Alf!  -1 star for syndicated cut versions,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,3049,"['Season', '3', 'show', 'peak', 'weave', 'more', 'complex', 'storylines', 'comedic', 'situations', 'two', 'seasons', 'Paul', 'Fusco', 'actors', 'hit', 'stride', 'are', 'completely', 'comfortable', 'characters', 'Thus', 'naturalness', 'everyone', 'performances', 'Alf', 'intents', 'purposes', 'real', 'Also', 'Alf', 'clumsiness', 'general', 'mayhem', 'more', 'subdued', 'being', 'focus', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'able', 'actually', 'touch', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'fair', 'sacrificing', 'traditional', 'Alf', 'style', 'humor', 'Concepts', 'such', 'losing', 'clinging', 'moral', 'integrity', 'My', 'Back', 'Pages', 'fear', 'absolesence', 'Baby', 'Love', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'abject', 'loneliness', 'Alone', 'Again', 'Naturally', 'Standing', 'Shadows', 'Love', 'catastrophic', 'expectation', 'Shake', 'Rattle', 'Roll', 'even', 'grief', 'death', 'funeral', 'friend', 'Even', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'weighty', 'have', 'more', 'complex', 'intresting', 'elements', 'eg.', 'Old', 'Time', 'Movie', 'Alf', 'Jake', 'constructing', 'script', 'starring', 'Tanners', 'out', 'old', 'silent', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'so', 'Have', 'Seen', 'Mother', 'Baby', 'Jake', 'confront', 'mother', 'who', 'thief', 'Running', 'Scared', 'deals', 'blackmailer', 'FBI', 'lot', 'really', 'good', 'writing', 'going', 'season', 'ALF', 'was', 'show', 'always', 'mixed', 'somewhat', 'childlike', 'childish', 'depending', 'POV', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'heart', 'third', 'season', 'onset', 'far', 'more', 'somber', 'themes', 'show', 'actually', 'premise', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'affecting', 'result', 'humor', 'much', 'funnier', 'emerging', 'human', 'emotions', 'situations', 'Alf', 'fears', 'being', 'only', 'one', 'kind', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'concerns', 'should', 'savor', 'life', 'might', 'croak', 'tomorrow', 'touching', 'real', 'sorrow', 'fact', 'new', 'infant', 'house', 'will', 'leave', 'attention', 'love', 'understandable', 'also', 'great', 'thematic', 'continuity', 'nod', 'second', 'season', 'episode', 'lost', 'dog', 'will', 'complain', 'want', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'crass', 'elements', 'Alf', 'burping', 'breaking', 'things', 'others', 'will', 'deride', 'fact', 'producers', 'writers', 'even', 'attempt', 'rise', 'show', 'station', 'basically', 'junk', 'TV', 'what', 'critics', 'fail', 'see', 'ALF', 'essentially', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'place', 'not', 'one', 'heart', 'not', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'times', 'touch', 'human', 'condition', 'when', 'show', 'rise', 'more', 'complex', 'themes', 'well', 'becoming', 'funnier', 'more', 'memorable.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'ALF', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'brain-dead', ""'ve"", 'ingested', 'too', 'many', 'sugar', 'substitutes', 'only', 'criticism', 'DVD', 'release', 'edited', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'had', 'cut', 'scenes', 'make', 'room', 'more', 'commercials', 'show', 'still', 'great', 'unfortunate', 'not', 'have', 'full', 'versions']",N/A

However, I have a complaint against Lionsgate (aside from the whole syndication issues) - the last disc of this season, they screwed up the order of the shows. Kate is pregnant, the baby is born, and then in the next episode they appear to have shoved the baby back in because she's pregnant again. Apparently when they edited this DVD, they didn't notice the discrepancy. I was only six when this season would have aired, so I have no idea if the shows were actually in that order, but I'm pretty sure the person making the collaboration put them in the wrong order. Otherwise it's a great set.",4,Good for another set of laughs,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,726,"['now', 'officially', 'own', 'ALF', 'seaons', 'DVD', 'love', 'love', 'love', 'show', 'will', 'happily', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'years', 'come', 'However', 'have', 'complaint', 'Lionsgate', 'aside', 'whole', 'syndication', 'issues', 'last', 'disc', 'season', 'screwed', 'up', 'order', 'shows', 'Kate', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'born', 'then', 'next', 'episode', 'appear', 'have', 'shoved', 'baby', 'back', 'pregnant', 'again', 'Apparently', 'when', 'edited', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'discrepancy', 'was', 'only', 'six', 'when', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'aired', 'have', 'idea', 'shows', 'were', 'actually', 'order', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'person', 'making', 'collaboration', 'put', 'wrong', 'order', 'Otherwise', 'great', 'set']",N/A
