The quality of this dvd is not as good as it could've and should be but I'm haunted by this veteran group's disrespect for their audience when the former engaged in this sort of lowlife profanities.  Some may think I am too sensitive in relating these facts but whether or not a performer is 'ghetto' or not, it is imperative that performers from the ghetto maintain a higher professionalism than their roots would mandate.
