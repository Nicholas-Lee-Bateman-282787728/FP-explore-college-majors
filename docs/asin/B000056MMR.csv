569709,A2R4LM60ZHIDIF,B000056MMR,Amber Dowd,"[4, 5]","After recovering from having my first child and rebounding from a relatively fit pregnancy, I hoped to find a workout routine I could do at home that would strengthen my weak spots and firm up my abs and stomach that softened over nine months of modified activity.  This is not the workout to achieve that.  This workout is meant for someone who is extremely flexible with an innate sense of grace and balance that I just do not possess.  Even some of the simplest leg lifts seem unnatural to a non-professional dancer.  Rotating the foot completely to one side and lifting the leg offers a strain I wasn't ready for, and my right leg now suffers a severe strain in the hip joint.Some of the exercises are really challenging and offer a good workout for muscles that have gone unused in many people, but I was looking for a more all-body workout, and this one concentrates mostly on the lower body.  The abdominals and leg darts are great exercises, and I get the most out of those and the floor barre, but there are so few of them, and I feel that once I really start feeling the burn and effects of the exercises, we've moved on to the plies and unintentional acrobatics.The warm-up took me a week and a half to get down, having done it every day and messing up a lot of the moves, and I still stumble through the third section.  I laugh at the same point in the video every day when the instructor tells you not to sacrifice the form in order to get the most out of the exercise...meanwhile, I'm doing a balancing act, twisting my ankle, and straining my back in order to simply regain my balance, let alone do the exercise correctly and ""emulate the proper form"".Perhaps it's me, and I was never meant to train like a dancer trains, but this workout requires maximum balance, maximum coordination, and maximum flexibility, and if you don't possess each of these qualities in perfect capacity, you're screwed.  Many of the exercises seem impossible, and you wonder if you're getting anything out of them because you can't perfectly mimic the form of the sculpted dancer on the screen.  Losing your balance and twisting your leg or foot make it difficult to focus on the workout, and you need a shaman's focus and patience in order to get through it.  It also seems long for an hour, probably due to the repetition of exercises and muted colors.As a DVD, it is terrible.  I should have saved the extra few dollars and gone for the VHS.  There are certain sections I need to skip now because of the strain in my right leg (that becomes inflamed immediately once the warm-up starts), and in order to skip to the next section, you have to fast forward through the moves in the current section.  There are no clean cut chapters unless you go to the Exercises section, and once you complete one given section, you are taken back to the menu and have to repeat the process again and again in order to get the workout that fits you.  That breaks your focus and motivation, and it makes the process that much longer and more frustrating.There are a couple of sections where the audio is a little off, so the instructor is telling you to do something you've either already completed or haven't gotten to yet.  Also, there is a stretching section where there seems to be a glitch.  One minute, the dancer is stretching her right leg into the air.  You blink, and her left leg is in the air.  You hurry to catch up, and ultimately only one leg ends up getting the most out of the stretching routine.  Most frustrating.As a plus, though, my four month old gets a good laugh out of my balancing act, so at least it keeps her entertained while I work out.I will look for a more complete workout that an average individual can properly perform (hopefully without injury), and I will certainly seek a better quality DVD format.

The first time I did this DVD was when I rented it and I could NOT get through the abs section.Since then I am not doing ballet currently (due to injuries) but I am doing a lot of exercise at home.  Currently I've been doing a daily 15 min. with Yourself Fitness and also alternating daily Denise Austin pilates dvds.So, because I've been doing pilates for a while on my abs I could get through the abs part of this, and it was still killer.This DVD is what the ballet dancers do as a warm up to their 6-8 hour day of ballet training.  A warmed up body is excellent in order to do a full day of ballet training, as they do.  Which is why this DVD works every single muscle group.  And, I would say it's the most difficult exercise DVD I have in my current collection.  It's well worth it.  It is a little advanced for people that are really out of shape, but I bet if you are out of shape and did this daily for several months you'd be IN shape!I did this last night, I could only get through 41 minutes of it, and I lost a pound of weight this morning!

569711,A30OGYCJM4B10S,B000056MMR,atisheh,"[13, 15]","Disclosure: I rented this video around the same time that I started a ""Ballet Body"" class at my local gym. Also, I've been doing Callanetics, which is ballet-inspired.Other people here have mentioned that ballet terms are not explained (annoying, but you can deal with it), or that the narrator often does not give proper cues (actually very annoying, since he sometimes gives them, but at the wrong time, making it confusing even if you know what to do). Here are my problems with it:1. I found the warmup horribly insufficient. That was not a warmup. That was barely a stretch.2. As others here have mentioned, the long and unskippable pauses between sections make sure that any warmup will be useless.3. The beautiful, artsy dark background and shots make it really difficult sometimes to see what the dancers are doing. How about some bright lighting, like the kind they have in their actual studios?4. There really aren't enough repetitions of each move. Not even the crunches. I'm sorry, sixteen crunches is not going to do anything for anyone's abs. I really wish they hadn't tried to fit in so many different moves and combinations, and had just chosen a few good ones and made the most of them -- and by that I mean explaining proper technique, showing modifications, and doing them enough times to get the muscles to work a little.I guess that any exercise is better than no exercise at all, but I have a hard time imagining seeing any physical improvement from this DVD. My class at the gym has more repetitions and more of an aerobic component, which allows for more of a workout. Meanwhile, Callanetics (or yoga) is much better at building flexibility and muscle tone. I think the NYC Ballet Workout would be lovely for someone who wanted to see different ballet moves, and I loved the extras, but there are better dance-inspired workout videos.",2,Pretty disappointing.,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,1858,"['Disclosure', 'rented', 'video', 'same', 'time', 'started', 'Ballet', 'Body', 'class', 'local', 'gym', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Callanetics', 'ballet-inspired.Other', 'people', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'ballet', 'terms', 'are', 'not', 'explained', 'annoying', 'can', 'deal', 'narrator', 'often', 'not', 'give', 'proper', 'cues', 'actually', 'very', 'annoying', 'wrong', 'time', 'making', 'confusing', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Here', 'are', 'problems', 'it:1', 'found', 'warmup', 'horribly', 'insufficient', 'was', 'not', 'warmup', 'was', 'barely', 'stretch.2', 'others', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'long', 'unskippable', 'pauses', 'sections', 'make', 'sure', 'warmup', 'will', 'be', 'useless.3', 'beautiful', 'artsy', 'dark', 'background', 'shots', 'make', 'really', 'difficult', 'sometimes', 'see', 'what', 'dancers', 'are', 'doing', 'How', 'bright', 'lighting', 'kind', 'have', 'actual', 'studios', '4', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'repetitions', 'move', 'Not', 'even', 'crunches', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'sixteen', 'crunches', 'not', 'going', 'do', 'anything', 'anyone', 'abs', 'really', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'fit', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'moves', 'combinations', 'had', 'just', 'chosen', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'made', 'most', 'mean', 'explaining', 'proper', 'technique', 'showing', 'modifications', 'doing', 'enough', 'times', 'get', 'muscles', 'work', 'little.I', 'guess', 'exercise', 'better', 'exercise', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'seeing', 'physical', 'improvement', 'DVD', 'class', 'gym', 'more', 'repetitions', 'more', 'aerobic', 'component', 'more', 'workout', 'Meanwhile', 'Callanetics', 'yoga', 'much', 'better', 'building', 'flexibility', 'muscle', 'tone', 'think', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'Workout', 'would', 'be', 'lovely', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'see', 'different', 'ballet', 'moves', 'loved', 'extras', 'are', 'better', 'dance-inspired', 'workout', 'videos']",New York City Ballet Workout
569712,A26KYDJOAGI05S,B000056MMR,Audiaa,"[1, 1]","This workout is fun.  However it is like coming into a class in the middle where everyone else knows that moves so there is little instruction.  The narrator seems like he has a script but doesn't really know when to say what.  At one point he just says, ""rather than listening to me watch the dancers.""  The dancers start doing a cool down routine where it is hard to watch what they are doing and do it at the same time.  I'm sure that it won't be too hard after doing it a few times though, and it is fun to do ballet steps and act like a dancer.There is a pretty good warm up and toning section at the beginning that includes abs and leg exercises done while lying on the floor.  Then there are short exercises that each introduces a new move (the moves aren't really introduced in the sense that you are told how to do them correctly, though).  The whole workout is done in short segments that are put together in different ways at the end for specific types of sports workouts, but I found that the whole workout isn't really that strenuous, so doing less than the whole thing isn't really that useful",4,Ballet Class,1069891200,"11 27, 2003",2003,1107,"['workout', 'fun', 'However', 'coming', 'class', 'middle', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'moves', 'so', 'little', 'instruction', 'narrator', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'when', 'say', 'what', 'one', 'point', 'just', 'rather', 'listening', 'watch', 'dancers', 'dancers', 'start', 'doing', 'cool', 'down', 'routine', 'where', 'hard', 'watch', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'do', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'doing', 'few', 'times', 'fun', 'do', 'ballet', 'steps', 'act', 'dancer.There', 'pretty', 'good', 'warm', 'up', 'toning', 'section', 'beginning', 'abs', 'leg', 'exercises', 'done', 'lying', 'floor', 'Then', 'are', 'short', 'exercises', 'new', 'move', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'introduced', 'sense', 'are', 'told', 'how', 'do', 'correctly', 'whole', 'workout', 'done', 'short', 'segments', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'different', 'ways', 'end', 'specific', 'types', 'sports', 'workouts', 'found', 'whole', 'workout', ""n't"", 'really', 'strenuous', 'doing', 'less', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'really', 'useful']",New York City Ballet Workout
569713,A1LF1VMH9YCTLE,B000056MMR,"AussieGal ""Kylie""","[0, 0]","I took a star off this one as I found that although the camera work is beautiful to look at - a spotlight with dancer in middle - the spotlight isn't quite big enough and the feet end up in the shadows so you can't see if the toes are pointing, flexed or turned out (especially in the floor work) added to this they are wearing dark shoes so hard to see at times.The workout itself is fabulous and I don't understand the criticism from other reviewers.  If you are after a ballet dancing class that you can dance along with, this isn't for you (try NYCB 2 - I own this too and have reviewed it) - but this never claims to be a ballet class - it clearly states it is the workout the NYC ballet dancers use to get into shape and allow them to dance.  Ballet dancers do cross-train - they go to gym and do crunches and weights! (check out the video diaries in the 'extras' if you don't agree).The workout is very user-friendly - split into 17 parts so you can do any/all with great floor and standing work for toning and balance.  I guess many of us who are used the constant cueing and counting of reps with conventional aerobics tapes find not being spoon-fed the routine a little frustrating. I think the cueing is a little lacking in parts here, but the routines are fairly short and the movements repetitive so they do become much easier each time you work out.  If you have prior pilates experience you will pick it up very easily.If you only have the money to buy one ballet workout, I'd choose NYCB 2 over this one as the cueing is better, it has the end dance routine that is so much fun and there is more explanation of the moves (especially with the glossary).Someone said Peter (he narrates) is snobbish and the dvd too arty.... I disagree! Peter speaks beautifully and has a lovely soothing accent, perhaps people interpret it as snobbish? and as for the dvd being arty - isn't ballet an art?  It is beautiful to look at and listen to.  It will leave you feeling taller and more toned (like pilates), but not exhausted.",4,"not as good as NYC Ballet 2, but still a worthwhile purchase",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2029,"['took', 'star', 'one', 'found', 'camera', 'work', 'beautiful', 'look', 'spotlight', 'dancer', 'middle', 'spotlight', ""n't"", 'quite', 'big', 'enough', 'feet', 'end', 'up', 'shadows', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'toes', 'are', 'pointing', 'flexed', 'turned', 'out', 'especially', 'floor', 'work', 'added', 'are', 'wearing', 'dark', 'shoes', 'so', 'hard', 'see', 'times.The', 'workout', 'fabulous', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'criticism', 'other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'ballet', 'dancing', 'class', 'can', 'dance', 'along', ""n't"", 'try', 'NYCB', '2', 'own', 'too', 'have', 'reviewed', 'never', 'be', 'ballet', 'class', 'clearly', 'workout', 'NYC', 'ballet', 'dancers', 'use', 'get', 'shape', 'allow', 'dance', 'Ballet', 'dancers', 'do', 'cross-train', 'go', 'gym', 'do', 'crunches', 'weights', 'check', 'out', 'video', 'diaries', ""'extras"", 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', '.The', 'workout', 'very', 'user-friendly', 'split', '17', 'parts', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'floor', 'standing', 'work', 'toning', 'balance', 'guess', 'many', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'constant', 'cueing', 'counting', 'reps', 'conventional', 'aerobics', 'tapes', 'find', 'not', 'being', 'spoon-fed', 'routine', 'little', 'frustrating', 'think', 'cueing', 'little', 'lacking', 'parts', 'here', 'routines', 'are', 'fairly', 'short', 'movements', 'repetitive', 'so', 'do', 'become', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'work', 'out', 'have', 'prior', 'pilates', 'experience', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'very', 'easily.If', 'only', 'have', 'money', 'buy', 'one', 'ballet', 'workout', ""'d"", 'choose', 'NYCB', '2', 'one', 'cueing', 'better', 'end', 'dance', 'routine', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'more', 'explanation', 'moves', 'especially', 'glossary', '.Someone', 'said', 'Peter', 'snobbish', 'dvd', 'too', 'arty', 'disagree', 'Peter', 'beautifully', 'lovely', 'soothing', 'accent', 'perhaps', 'people', 'interpret', 'snobbish', 'dvd', 'being', 'arty', ""n't"", 'ballet', 'art', 'beautiful', 'look', 'listen', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'taller', 'more', 'toned', 'pilates', 'not', 'exhausted']",New York City Ballet Workout

I've done yoga for quite a while I found this video to be much too advanced.  Section 1, the four dancers stand prepared, even spaced, feet parallel with their arms in position (port de bras) ready, against a blue backdrop. Martin's soft, warm voice begins to talk us through the exercises as the classical music begins. The first problem becomes instantly apparent: the technical ballet terms are not always explained. It is left to the person watching to figure it out for themselves if the do not already know. If you're co-ordinated and can follow what somebody else does easily then you'll work out pretty quickly that plie means knee bend. This part of the exercise involves mainly the upper body and an awful lot of bending sideways.You then move on to the main part of the exercise video and the simplicity ends here.  This is probably the most difficult and painful part. A dancer lies on her back with her legs raised at a right angle to her body then moves her legs out sideways, toes pointing towards the ever nearing floor, until she has lowered them into the splits!

The workout is divided into 17 segments, which can be viewed all at once, one at a time, or as part of four sections.  Exercises 1-4 are warm ups, includes some dance steps that get your blood pumping and some nice stretching.  5 &amp; 6 work your abdominals.  7-9 are &quot;floor barre,&quot; which means you lie on your back and keep everything stable except the moving leg -- very effective.  10-16 are leg work, such as degagees, tendus, and grand battements.  Finally, 17 is a cooldown with some stretching.  Note that there is no instructor-led dance segment after all that barre/center work, as there is in a dance class.There is one main thing I don't like about this DVD -- the verbal cuing is terrible.  At the very end, the narrator says, &quot;Rather than follow my instructions, follow the dancers, the music, and listen to your body.&quot;  Yeah, well, tell me how to follow the dancers with my face in my knees.  A few viewings should make this much less of a problem, but the first times through may be frustrating, especially during the (almost silent) cooldown, when your neck is craned around to see what's going on.I don't know if someone with no ballet experience would find this DVD very rewarding.  Although no special equipment is required, there is no explanation of technique, and the narrator makes frequent use of ballet terminology.

The New York City Ballet workout presents exercises in a formal ballet style setting. For minutes at a time you forget you are not a ballerina as you work through the warm-up with first and second position.Fluid movements follow as you move from side to side and then put a spring in your step. A floor routine follows with leg stretches and then you work your abs in every possible way, although each movement is so precise you are getting double the workout in half the time.The unique and challenging postures and dance steps are explained as you are doing them, although at times the choreography takes center stage as the narration lessens and you focus more on the dancers instead of following the cueing.This is a well structured, intermediate to advanced workout that requires a sense of determination, some experience with Pilates and possibly Yoga. The jumps are the most challenging and the entire workout fine tunes your balance. There are 17 exercise sessions and bonus programs including video diaries, behind the scenes footage and interviews.Back exercises appear during the floor workout, but you are using your entire body at all times because most of the workout requires you to be super focused and keep your balance so you may feel this the most in your back after the workout.

569731,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000056MMR,Sheri in Reho,"[21, 22]","The New York City Ballet Workout has more in common with a film playing at your local art house theatre than the average workout DVD.  It is artistically masterful--a work of art in light and shadow and movement of the human body.  But is it a good workout?Once you get past the fact that this workout is filmed and formatted like a movie, and the fact that its artfulness sometimes means the workouts are a little dark, you are ready to enjoy a sublimely serene workout that combines real ballet moves with some Pilates moves.  While the menu doesn't offer you the option to build a custom workout from its various parts (a real shame), you do have the option of either performing the entire workout (just over an hour) or picking and choosing from sections of the workout when you have less time.The workout, which is narrated by Peter Martins, Director of the New York City Ballet Company, is done to light classical music and performed by two male and two female dancers who are part of the NYC Ballet Company.  It includes:Sections 1-4:  Three standing warm-up segments (#2 is my favorite) and one stretching segment on the floor prepare your body for the workout.Sections 5-8:  One segment of abs and three segments of Floor Barre for toning the legs, back, abs and buns.  This section will be somewhat familiar to fans of Pilates.Sections 9-12:  Pli&eacute;s, Tendu, Degag&eacute;, Pass&eacute;Sections 13-17:  Arabesque Raises, Reverence, Grand Battement Front, Front Attitude, Little Jumps (There is no segment called ""Cool down"" but the narration indicates that Reverence is what ballet dancers use to cool down, so that is what I used.)You need no previous ballet training to do this workout.  I had none, but had previously used another ballet workout that gave me a ""leg up"" in doing this workout.  If you are discouraged by seeing people who are in peak physical condition---whose bodies can do things yours probably can't---this may not be the workout for you.  It's necessary to go into this realizing that you probably will never be able to match these dancers in terms of flexibility.  That doesn't mean the workout is undoable for a non-dancer---they have simplified the movements to make them doable for ""real people"" (but they still offer a challenge).If your goal is a tighter toned body, I recommend this workout.

I had more tone after, no problem following it even though I have NO ballet experience & no dance expreince. I am not in great shape, but not too bad with years of yoga & dance DVDs workouts a couple times a week for several years. I felt much more graceful after.I have really tight tendons at the knee area that makes it hard for me to do leg lifts, etc. without feeling my joint has to go to unstable position to compensate for the restrictiviness of the tendons not allowing the joint to move correctly. The pliets really do stretch the area & the tendons/muscles by my knee feel much more loose/free after. This workout may even help cure my tightness problem.I love doing this workout, with the ab & back floor work as well, I get a real full-body workout that's not boring at all.

I kept waiting for it to really begin and it never did:(  It was close to an hour and the only work I felt was during the 10 pushups and 10 crunches.  Needless to say, the dvd is beautifully produced, and worth watching.  However, you will outgrow it very quickly if you're using it as a work-out.  I enjoyed the music, despite the fact that I never listen to classical music.  The gripes that people have with the cool-down having no narration can be easily remedied by watching it once before you do it.  Outside of the cool-down, the rest of the dvd is easy to follow because of the music and you feel the change in movements about to come; though there is no explanation of how to do the movements.  (If you really want to know prior to viewing, just look at a book or quick video online of - first position, fifth position, tendu, plie, battement, coupe, attitude and arabesque).  There is a 5 minute section on ""Dance in the City"" on the dvd.  It's a really cool piece to watch.I recommend this dvd if you are a beginner, but you may need to use a high chair for a couple of parts if you have any balance issues.  Again, you will outgrow it fairly quickly though.  If you are beyond beginner, I recommend it only if you are using it prior to a cardio workout because there is an element of stretch in there.  But who has an extra hour for that???  Borrow it from someone to watch and do it once.  You will see what I mean by my review.  I will check out volume 2 and review that next :)",3,"Pretty much a ballet warm-up, not a work-out.",1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,1606,"['First', 'am', 'not', 'trained', 'dancer', 'However', 'dvd', 'what', 'warm-up', 'ballet', 'work-out', 'would', 'be', 'kept', 'waiting', 'really', 'begin', 'never', 'did', 'was', 'close', 'hour', 'only', 'work', 'felt', 'was', '10', 'pushups', '10', 'crunches', 'Needless', 'say', 'dvd', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'worth', 'watching', 'However', 'will', 'outgrow', 'very', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'using', 'work-out', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'fact', 'never', 'listen', 'classical', 'music', 'gripes', 'people', 'have', 'cool-down', 'having', 'narration', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'remedied', 'watching', 'once', 'do', 'cool-down', 'rest', 'dvd', 'easy', 'follow', 'music', 'feel', 'change', 'movements', 'come', 'explanation', 'how', 'do', 'movements', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'prior', 'viewing', 'just', 'look', 'book', 'quick', 'video', 'online', 'first', 'position', 'fifth', 'position', 'tendu', 'plie', 'battement', 'coupe', 'attitude', 'arabesque', '5', 'minute', 'section', 'Dance', 'City', 'dvd', 'really', 'cool', 'piece', 'watch.I', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'are', 'beginner', 'may', 'need', 'use', 'high', 'chair', 'couple', 'parts', 'have', 'balance', 'issues', 'Again', 'will', 'outgrow', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'are', 'beginner', 'recommend', 'only', 'are', 'using', 'prior', 'cardio', 'workout', 'element', 'stretch', 'there', 'who', 'extra', 'hour', 'Borrow', 'someone', 'watch', 'do', 'once', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'review', 'will', 'check', 'out', 'volume', '2', 'review', 'next']",New York City Ballet Workout
