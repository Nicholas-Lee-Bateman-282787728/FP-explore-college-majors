1202019,A12C9UDG5AV1TA,B001HQ6ZC8,Chris Aldrighetti,"[0, 0]",One of the things I really love about this DVD is that it's only the two of them playing. They don't bring their buddies out to play keyboards and bass. I really dig that it's just the two of them. If you like The Black Keys... You'll love this!!,5,Love this!!,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,246,"['One', 'things', 'really', 'love', 'DVD', 'only', 'two', 'playing', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'buddies', 'play', 'keyboards', 'bass', 'really', 'dig', 'just', 'two', 'like', 'Black', 'Keys', ""'ll"", 'love']",N/A

It's two guys that live in Akron Ohio, and make a ton of outstanding rock sound. I made the same mistake earlier on, they are a rock band, not blues. The mistake is easy to make, their early ""hit"" was on Fat Possum records, a blues compilation.This DVD is head and shoulders 1000 times better than the first live concert releaseThe Black Keys Live. In Crystal Ballroom, the sound is perfection. There's real camera work. The lighting is very good. This is a better polished concert video.I certainly have to agree, why there aren't more reviews of this disc? This group and this DVD are incredible. If you like the Black Keys, this is a must have addition. If you aren't as familiar with them, close your eyes and pick any album (might want to veer away from Catch and Release, it's a bit different), and then come back and buy this DVD.",5,AWESOME,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,937,"['Black', 'Keys', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'far', 'found', 'DVD', 'know', 'Black', 'Keys', 'are', 'amazing', 'two', 'guys', 'live', 'Akron', 'Ohio', 'make', 'ton', 'outstanding', 'rock', 'sound', 'made', 'same', 'mistake', 'earlier', 'are', 'rock', 'band', 'not', 'blues', 'mistake', 'easy', 'make', 'early', 'hit', 'was', 'Fat', 'Possum', 'records', 'blues', 'compilation.This', 'DVD', 'head', 'shoulders', '1000', 'times', 'better', 'first', 'live', 'concert', 'releaseThe', 'Black', 'Keys', 'Live', 'Crystal', 'Ballroom', 'sound', 'perfection', 'real', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'very', 'good', 'better', 'polished', 'concert', 'video.I', 'certainly', 'have', 'agree', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'more', 'reviews', 'disc', 'group', 'DVD', 'are', 'incredible', 'like', 'Black', 'Keys', 'must', 'have', 'addition', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'close', 'eyes', 'pick', 'album', 'might', 'want', 'veer', 'away', 'Catch', 'Release', 'bit', 'different', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'buy', 'DVD']",N/A

It has it all.The sound is powerful and clear.  Dan's voice is in top form.  He sings with real commitment and passion.  His guitar tone is thick, aggressive and prominently featured in the mix.  Patrick plays with all of the energy he is known for.The show has a great set list with a mix of songs from throughout their career.  Some real thought went into the pacing of this show.  Everything rolls along energetically yet there is still time reserved for some truly soulful moments (especially You're The One, and All You Ever Wanted).  All of your favorites may not be accounted for here, but believe me, you won't mind in the least.Set List:Same Old ThingGirl Is On My MindSet You FreeThickfreaknessStack Shot BillyBusted (w/ extended outro jam)You're The OneRemember When (Side B)Your TouchOceans And Streams (played on electric keyboard to great effect)Strange TimesPsychotic Girl10 AM AutomaticNo TrustI Got MineAll You Ever WantedTill I Get My WayThe camera work and stage light show compliments and reflects the high energy of the band.  In contrast to many music DVDs out there, this one does not have constant camera cuts that come at you like a strobe light.  The camera actually lingers a resonable amount of time before changing angles.  It makes for a very enjoyable viewing experience and it won't make you seasick.The venue and crowd are perfect for the band.  Visually it has classic theater character.  It's big enough to avoid the small club atmosphere of their last DVD, but intimate enough that you can see and feel the energy of the crowd.Lastly there are some video extras about the recording of Attack And Release as well as some behind the scenes footage of making the music videos.  Of course the videos themselves are here as well.  And yes, the packaging is typically understated.When I was at TBK show in my town over the summer, the demographics of the crowd appeared to be very diverse (age as well as social status).  The band has so many elements in their music that it naturally appeals to a wide range of music fans.  This DVD is a great document of that appeal.  I very highly recommend this DVD.",5,The Black Keys at Their Very Best.,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,2273,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'are', 'only', '3', 'reviews', 'fantastic', 'concert', 'DVD', 'own', 'around', '300', 'music', 'DVDs', 'one', 'easily', 'top', '10', 'all.The', 'sound', 'powerful', 'clear', 'Dan', 'voice', 'top', 'form', 'real', 'commitment', 'passion', 'guitar', 'tone', 'thick', 'aggressive', 'prominently', 'featured', 'mix', 'Patrick', 'energy', 'known', 'for.The', 'show', 'great', 'set', 'list', 'mix', 'songs', 'career', 'real', 'thought', 'went', 'pacing', 'show', 'Everything', 'along', 'energetically', 'yet', 'still', 'time', 'reserved', 'truly', 'soulful', 'moments', 'especially', ""'re"", 'One', 'All', 'Ever', 'Wanted', 'favorites', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accounted', 'here', 'believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'least.Set', 'List', 'Same', 'Old', 'ThingGirl', 'My', 'MindSet', 'FreeThickfreaknessStack', 'Shot', 'BillyBusted', 'w/', 'extended', 'outro', 'jam', ""'re"", 'OneRemember', 'When', 'Side', 'B', 'TouchOceans', 'Streams', 'played', 'electric', 'keyboard', 'great', 'effect', 'Strange', 'TimesPsychotic', 'Girl10', 'AM', 'AutomaticNo', 'TrustI', 'Got', 'MineAll', 'Ever', 'WantedTill', 'Get', 'WayThe', 'camera', 'work', 'stage', 'light', 'show', 'compliments', 'high', 'energy', 'band', 'contrast', 'many', 'music', 'DVDs', 'there', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'constant', 'camera', 'cuts', 'come', 'like', 'strobe', 'light', 'camera', 'actually', 'resonable', 'amount', 'time', 'changing', 'angles', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'seasick.The', 'venue', 'crowd', 'are', 'perfect', 'band', 'Visually', 'classic', 'theater', 'character', 'big', 'enough', 'avoid', 'small', 'club', 'atmosphere', 'last', 'DVD', 'intimate', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'energy', 'crowd.Lastly', 'are', 'video', 'extras', 'recording', 'Attack', 'Release', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'footage', 'making', 'music', 'videos', 'course', 'videos', 'are', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'yes', 'packaging', 'typically', 'understated.When', 'was', 'TBK', 'show', 'town', 'summer', 'demographics', 'crowd', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'diverse', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'social', 'status', 'band', 'so', 'many', 'elements', 'music', 'naturally', 'appeals', 'wide', 'range', 'music', 'fans', 'DVD', 'great', 'document', 'appeal', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

Primarily, because the band isn't in an arena. It's the Black Keys in their prime..again..in my opinion. Saw them in arena, and, it just didn't feel right. That said...Go, Black Keys! Make the money! But, in reviewing THIS show, I say, ""Buy it!"". Plays well at parties. I, personally, like to entertain my friends with my extensive collection of concert DVDs. People love it! I set up a 'line up', and, rock it. This a great addition to the rock collection. Buy it. Enjoy it.

1202024,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B001HQ6ZC8,M. Oleson,"[4, 4]","Although this DVD concert film has the Nonesuch and Warner label on it, you might guess that it was bootlegged.  As it were, it is a hell-bent-for-leather 65 minute performance by drummer Patrick Carney and everything else Dan Auerbach.  They don't stop.  They don't drink water.  They don't wipe away sweat.  They just motor on from song to song.  The Portland, Oregon location is dark as you might expect, but this DVD looks pretty decent in the up-converted mode.  The sound unfortunately is only 2.0 stereo which may be what the boys intended.  Dunno, but kind of a disappointment in this day and age.  One thing is certain.
