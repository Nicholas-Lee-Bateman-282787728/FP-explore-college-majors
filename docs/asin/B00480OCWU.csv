1388992,A23JNLBAE18XO0,B00480OCWU,Frank R. Schoonover,"[9, 9]","Goober and the Ghost Chasers ran on the ABC network on Saturday mornings during the 1973-1974 season and was later repeated on CBS on Saturday mornings as the same network also had Partridge Family 2200 AD running on Saturday morning during the 1974-1975 TV season. It was also repeated in serialized form on the syndicated cartoon show Fred Flintstone and Friends and shows up occasionally on Boomerang. The cartoon was similar to it's predecessor Scooby Doo Where Are You?, but with a few differences. The gang went after mostly real ghosts, although they did run into those disguised as ghosts on occasion.Goober and the Ghost Chasers were a gang that had it's own magazine, also called Ghost Chasers, that investigated spirits, ghosts and haunted houses and islands of all kinds. They were always hungry for anything new on that horizon. Whenever they got a call, from either the Partridge Kids, who guest starred on half the episodes or from other sources, the gang went after these things so they could have a new story for the next issue of their magazine. Ted was the gang's leader. Tina was the writer and Gilly was the photographer. Last but not least, we have Goober. A wise cracking dog that has an unusual talent for disappearing when least expected, especially when a ghost appears. Goober only talked to the home audience watching the program and never to any of the gang. The gang always wound up in situations when they desperately were trying to seek the spirits that they were investigating as Tina was always desperate to interview the spirits in question and Gilly always trying to get pictures only to be carried away by a really scared Goober, which always frustrated Gilly. Not only that, the chemistry between the gang and the Partridge Kids, in particular, Gilly and Danny, was wonderful. Danny and Goober were both afraid of ghosts and they always had to drag Gilly away when Gilly stayed behind to try and get a picture. Also, when Ted was matched up with Tina and Laurie, Ted was like a protector for the girls whenever the spirits appeared and at times, Ted would have a hard time getting the spector detector to work. There were also guest appearances by basketball great Wilt Chamberlain(May he rest in peace)and one time teen idol Michael Gray, who had starred on Shazam as Billy Batson and on The Brian Keith Show at the time as student doctor Ronnie Collins as The Brain Keith show was set in Hawaii as the Goober episode that he guest starred in was also set in Hawaii. All of that actually made the show work in many ways as the show was always funny, unpredictable and really kept you guessing. As for the youngest Partridge kids, Chris and Tracy, they never really were allowed to have a share in the gang's ghost hunts, but at times, they unintentionally wound up in the middle of the whole thing. This cartoon show has always been a load of laughs and can be watched more than once without it ever going dull or stale. The adventures are very comical and are never boring.The DVD set, an on demand styled DVD set by Warner Brothers, has the complete 16 episode series that ran on ABC on Saturday mornings during the 1973-1974 TV season. There aren't really any special features on this DVD, but the episodes are very colorful and the audio is well restored and it sounds great. Most of the episodes did have a ""canned laughter"" track, but there were only two or three that didn't have that.In my humble opinion, I felt that Goober was funnier than Scooby Doo was. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoy Scooby Doo and I always will, but I felt that Goober had at least two advantages over Scooby Doo. Goober could disappear when least expected and also, he made wise cracks about the whole thing of spirit chasing and also made cracks about himself in a very self mocking manner. IMHO, that is why I think that Goober was funnier than Scooby Doo. Those traits of Goober were what made the show and him funnier than Scooby Doo IMHO.Overall, this is a wonderful DVD set that is worth owning by any fans of the series and also for those who love classic animation. If you love Goober and the Ghost Chasers and want to rediscover it again, by all means buy this DVD set and watch the episodes. It should be in any fans DVD library.",5,Wonderful Cartoon Series Finally On DVD!,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,4262,"['Goober', 'Ghost', 'Chasers', 'ran', 'ABC', 'network', 'Saturday', 'mornings', '1973-1974', 'season', 'was', 'later', 'repeated', 'CBS', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'same', 'network', 'also', 'had', 'Partridge', 'Family', '2200', 'AD', 'running', 'Saturday', 'morning', '1974-1975', 'TV', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'repeated', 'serialized', 'form', 'syndicated', 'cartoon', 'show', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', 'Friends', 'up', 'occasionally', 'Boomerang', 'cartoon', 'was', 'similar', 'predecessor', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'few', 'differences', 'gang', 'went', 'mostly', 'real', 'ghosts', 'did', 'run', 'disguised', 'ghosts', 'occasion.Goober', 'Ghost', 'Chasers', 'were', 'gang', 'had', 'own', 'magazine', 'also', 'called', 'Ghost', 'Chasers', 'investigated', 'spirits', 'ghosts', 'haunted', 'houses', 'islands', 'kinds', 'were', 'always', 'hungry', 'anything', 'new', 'horizon', 'Whenever', 'got', 'call', 'Partridge', 'Kids', 'who', 'guest', 'starred', 'episodes', 'other', 'sources', 'gang', 'went', 'things', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'new', 'story', 'next', 'issue', 'magazine', 'Ted', 'was', 'gang', 'leader', 'Tina', 'was', 'writer', 'Gilly', 'was', 'photographer', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'have', 'Goober', 'A', 'wise', 'cracking', 'dog', 'unusual', 'talent', 'disappearing', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'especially', 'when', 'ghost', 'Goober', 'only', 'talked', 'home', 'audience', 'watching', 'program', 'never', 'gang', 'gang', 'always', 'wound', 'up', 'situations', 'when', 'desperately', 'were', 'trying', 'seek', 'spirits', 'were', 'investigating', 'Tina', 'was', 'always', 'desperate', 'interview', 'spirits', 'question', 'Gilly', 'always', 'trying', 'get', 'pictures', 'only', 'be', 'carried', 'away', 'really', 'scared', 'Goober', 'always', 'frustrated', 'Gilly', 'Not', 'only', 'chemistry', 'gang', 'Partridge', 'Kids', 'particular', 'Gilly', 'Danny', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Danny', 'Goober', 'were', 'afraid', 'ghosts', 'always', 'had', 'drag', 'Gilly', 'away', 'when', 'Gilly', 'stayed', 'try', 'get', 'picture', 'Also', 'when', 'Ted', 'was', 'matched', 'up', 'Tina', 'Laurie', 'Ted', 'was', 'protector', 'girls', 'whenever', 'spirits', 'appeared', 'times', 'Ted', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'spector', 'detector', 'work', 'were', 'also', 'guest', 'appearances', 'basketball', 'great', 'Wilt', 'Chamberlain', 'May', 'rest', 'peace', 'one', 'time', 'teen', 'idol', 'Michael', 'Gray', 'who', 'had', 'starred', 'Shazam', 'Billy', 'Batson', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Show', 'time', 'student', 'doctor', 'Ronnie', 'Collins', 'Brain', 'Keith', 'show', 'was', 'set', 'Hawaii', 'Goober', 'episode', 'guest', 'starred', 'was', 'also', 'set', 'Hawaii', 'actually', 'made', 'show', 'work', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'funny', 'unpredictable', 'really', 'kept', 'guessing', 'youngest', 'Partridge', 'kids', 'Chris', 'Tracy', 'never', 'really', 'were', 'allowed', 'have', 'share', 'gang', 'ghost', 'hunts', 'times', 'unintentionally', 'wound', 'up', 'middle', 'whole', 'thing', 'cartoon', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'load', 'laughs', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'more', 'once', 'ever', 'going', 'dull', 'stale', 'adventures', 'are', 'very', 'comical', 'are', 'never', 'boring.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'demand', 'styled', 'DVD', 'set', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'complete', '16', 'episode', 'series', 'ran', 'ABC', 'Saturday', 'mornings', '1973-1974', 'TV', 'season', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'colorful', 'audio', 'well', 'restored', 'great', 'Most', 'episodes', 'did', 'have', 'canned', 'laughter', 'track', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'that.In', 'humble', 'opinion', 'felt', 'Goober', 'was', 'funnier', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'always', 'will', 'felt', 'Goober', 'had', 'least', 'two', 'advantages', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Goober', 'could', 'disappear', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'also', 'made', 'wise', 'cracks', 'whole', 'thing', 'spirit', 'chasing', 'also', 'made', 'cracks', 'very', 'self', 'mocking', 'manner', 'IMHO', 'why', 'think', 'Goober', 'was', 'funnier', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'traits', 'Goober', 'were', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'funnier', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'IMHO.Overall', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'set', 'owning', 'fans', 'series', 'also', 'who', 'love', 'classic', 'animation', 'love', 'Goober', 'Ghost', 'Chasers', 'want', 'rediscover', 'again', 'means', 'buy', 'DVD', 'set', 'watch', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'fans', 'DVD', 'library']",N/A

It's actually crazy how much it costs on Amazon when you can go to WB and get it for $24.95 + S&H.;  Amazon needs to come down on their prices.  I had trade-in credit so that ruled where I got my copy.  Amazon has been good to me, but pricey sometimes.  Ok, i'm through griping. lolIf you enjoy the old Scooby Doo type shows, then this is for you.  It's not as good as Scooby Doo by no means, but it's a really enjoyable show.  It has a similar feel to it with a group of kids and a dog and ghosts.  They work for Ghost Chasers magazine and they investigate ghosts.  The Partridge Kids are present on many of the episodes and help them investigate the ghosts.  Also, the Ghost Chaser gang drives around in a really neat 6-wheel van.Summary, if you already have all the old Scooby Doos, then this is a good next step if you can get it at a reasonable price.",4,"Really like it, but expensive",1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,915,"['title', 'really', 'expensive', 'actually', 'crazy', 'how', 'much', 'Amazon', 'when', 'can', 'go', 'WB', 'get', '24.95', '+', 'S', 'H', 'Amazon', 'come', 'down', 'prices', 'had', 'trade-in', 'credit', 'ruled', 'where', 'got', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'been', 'good', 'pricey', 'sometimes', 'Ok', 'i', ""'m"", 'griping', 'lolIf', 'enjoy', 'old', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'type', 'shows', 'then', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'means', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'show', 'similar', 'feel', 'group', 'kids', 'dog', 'ghosts', 'work', 'Ghost', 'Chasers', 'magazine', 'investigate', 'ghosts', 'Partridge', 'Kids', 'are', 'present', 'many', 'episodes', 'help', 'investigate', 'ghosts', 'Also', 'Ghost', 'Chaser', 'gang', 'drives', 'around', 'really', 'neat', '6-wheel', 'van.Summary', 'already', 'have', 'old', 'Scooby', 'Doos', 'then', 'good', 'next', 'step', 'can', 'get', 'reasonable', 'price']",N/A
