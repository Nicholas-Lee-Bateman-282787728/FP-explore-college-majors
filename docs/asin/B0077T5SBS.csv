Me and Mikey McCluskey (aka as O U) would watch this show as kids and fantasize about Hazel. We loved how she wore those sexy maid outfits and strutted around dusting and whatnot. Mikey loved how she used to bend over to clean the toilets and show a little undergarment knicker in the process. We all know that Hazel sure packed that maid's outfit tightly, with curves in all the right places. Yep, this show got Mikey and I through our puberty years, didn't it Mikey? It sure beats watching Leave it to Beaver reruns, especially if you are erotically obsessed with Eddie Haskell and are from Michigan.In fact, when you think about it, I am amazed that network TV showed something this racy and provocative in the 60s.

1527971,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B0077T5SBS,Kasey G,"[37, 37]","So here I am once again singing the praises of Shout Factory--and for good reason. They've managed to do in three months what Sony could not do in nearly six years--release two consecutive seasons of ""Hazel"" on DVD.Obviously there IS a market for this 50-year-old TV show when Season 3 is announced weeks before Season 2 hits stores.Here are the 32 episodes included on this set:Pot Luck A La Mode (9/19/1963)An Example For Hazel (9/26/1963)Dorothy Takes A Trip (10/3/1963)You Ain't Fully Dressed Without A Smile (10/10/1963)Cheerin' Up Mr. B.

Also, one episode titled ""The Campaign Manager"" on Disc Four is the syndicated cut version which only runs 22 minutes. These factors are what prevent this from being a Five-Star release IMO.The Season-premiere features a different opening with the cast preparing for Hazel to take a family portrait; the last episode of the season features yet another alternate opening with Harold pretending to be a toll-booth operator as Hazel is seated in a bright-red Ford convertible. The remainder of the episodes feature the opening with everyone piling into the car with Hazel smiling behind the wheel. Purists will be glad to know the original Screen Gems ""dancing sticks"" logo appears at the end of the closing credits.At this rate, we may see the remaining two seasons out by the end of 2012 or early 2013. I certainly hope so, while Season 5 wasn't the best, it features a teenage Ann Jillian as a semi-regular and I rarely saw many of those episodes in syndication.

The surviving quality of the early Pathe color film (Hazel was the first color sitcom) has been questionable over the years, but Shout Factory has done a pretty good job with the material that they were given for this Season 3 set.  Not only have they restored the original ""dancing sticks"" Screen Gems logo at the end of each episode (which was deleted long ago), but they have inserted two more of the original Ford-sponsored closing credits sequences (a previous one on ""Hazel's Nest Egg"" was restored in the '80s).  Someone at Shout Factory is definitely a Hazel fan.  Even though one episode is the 22-minute syndicated version (""Campaign Manager""), the rest are all the uncut 25.5 minute versions, and it's a pleasure seeing them that way after several decades.

For such an old series, the episodes look fantastic. A few of them have some dirt and grime but for a 50-year old show, ""Hazel"" has probably never looked better.As sitcoms age, it is common to notice weaknesses in the writing but that isn't the story with Season Three of ""Hazel."" There are a few clunkers here, but most of the stories are creative and we see more and more of Hazel Burke interacting with neighbors and the community at large. Shirley Booth continues to be amazing, and it really seems the award-winning actress was just hitting her stride. Seldom can an actress bring such a wide range of emotions to a viewer, but when her lips tremble and she breaks into tears, I found myself also feeling sad for her. But there are way more laughs here than tears; her relationship with Mr. B. is explored more, especially on the first disk, in a three-episode arc when Whitney Blake was noticeably absent. If anyone knows the background story behind her absence during those first few episodes of this third season, I'd be curious to know the details.There are also a few guest-starring roles of note, most notcieably a very, very young Diane Ladd as an annoying family cousin that will have viewers saying to themselves that she looks just like her daughter, Laura Dern.I can't laud Shout Factory! enough for releasing the second and third seasons of this sitcom...and hope they will release the remaining two seasons.
