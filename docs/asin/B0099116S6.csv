I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.Percy is a handsome (once he shaves) royal prince who is having an arranged marriage and is therefore engaged to a woman he doesn't love. After being beat up in the park by two men, he gets amnesia.  Zoe, a young girl who loves romantic fairytales, comes across Percy and believes that she has turned a frog that she kissed into the prince (who has webbed toes) from the fairy tales in her books and promptly brings him home.  Before her dad died he told her that he wanted her and her mom to someday have another someone special, so she helps Flynn (the frog-prince) by giving him a total makeover and trains him to become her male nanny (a difficult position when your employer is obsessed with detail, lists and organization) and hopefully allow the prince to rescue her mother.  However, Zoe's Mom, Gwen, being a single Mom and owner of the family restaurant is too busy to think about anything other than providing for her and her daughter and also can't let go of the memory of her husband to allow herself to be happy again and have fun.  Despite Gwen not believing in &#34;magic&#34; Flynn disarms Gwen.  He is charming she sees the relationship that he has with her daughter, the love that he has for her and that makes Gwen feel so comfortable with letting him into their lives.  And then once he is in their lives she can't help but fall in love with him.  Zoe really wants a father figure, which Flynn/Percy becomes, and they become a wonderful family, even after they (including Flynn) find out who he really is.I love how even though this family isn't a perfect family, it all comes together.

1587516,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0099116S6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","More or less, it starts like this: One evening, in San Francisco, when Percival (Simon Kassianides), the spoiled Marques of Summerland, flashes his wad of cash in a bar and then wanders off to Golden Gate Park in a drunken stupor, he's just asking to get rolled. And he gets rolled. He absorbs a, um, royal beating.The next morning 11-year-old Zoe Cole (Kiernan Shipka) ditches school. She arrives at the very same park to set free the frog she'd rescued from a science class dissection. It's like this: Zoe frequently inhabits an inner world in which she indulges her fascination with the fairy tale of The Frog Prince. By the pond in the park, she gives the frog a farewell good luck kiss. Moments later she glimpses an addled man folded into a boat. She eyeballs the royal sash on him and the webbed toes and comes to the only conclusion that a girl with big imagination could.I don't know that SMOOCH is the best film ever produced by Hallmark. But, hopefully, my even bringing it up gives an idea of just how much I enjoyed it. It's wonderfully whimsical. Young Kiernan Shipka is delightful. In raising her acting creds, I'll try not to bring up that she's a two-time SAG Award-winning actor (oops!). She anchors the film as Zoe whom she plays as lively and wistful and fanciful. Zoe has a great hope. She's targeting the upcoming Valentine's Day as when her widowed mom, Gwen (Kellie Martin), meets her mystery knight. But Zoe isn't contemplating that one bit when she manipulates her mom into hiring as her new nanny him what she mistakes for her Frog Prince. Zoe dubs him ""Flynn Stewart,"" after the frog hero of her favorite book. Percy, the English Royal now stricken with amnesia, plays along. I got a grin out of reading one of the papers Zoe works up to validate his nanny position. It read: ""Flynn Stewart, Nanny and Man Servant to Royal and Diginifed Society"" (yes, ""Diginifed"").Simon Kassianides is terrific. I imagine the ladies will eat up the way he delivers his lines. There's nothing like an Englishman to roll off the eloquent dialogue. There's a sense of satisfaction derived from watching his character's growth from vain nobleman to charming, caring nanny. Kassianides makes it an effortless transition. Kellie Martin is solid in a less showy role, playing Zoe's guarded mom who shies from opening her heart. She and Kassianides strike up some sparks, but, honestly, it's the chemistry between Kassianides and Kiernan Shipka that lights up the screen. The plot contrives this and that obstacle, as it must, but neither Percy's impending arranged marriage nor his debilitating vertigo nor a mother's seeming inflexibility can work up enough traction to derail this fractured Frog Prince fairy tale. I loved SMOOCH. I plan to watch it many times with my nieces. Watching it, you know that there's a happily ever after in store. But it's the getting there that's so much fun. Again, Kiernan Shipka makes an impression. I may start watching MAD MEN.",5,"""Why can't you be like other girls your age and just be obsessed with werewolves and vampires?""",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2969,"['More', 'less', 'One', 'evening', 'San', 'Francisco', 'when', 'Percival', 'Simon', 'Kassianides', 'spoiled', 'Marques', 'Summerland', 'wad', 'cash', 'bar', 'then', 'wanders', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Park', 'drunken', 'stupor', 'just', 'asking', 'get', 'rolled', 'rolled', 'um', 'royal', 'beating.The', 'next', 'morning', '11-year-old', 'Zoe', 'Cole', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'school', 'very', 'same', 'park', 'set', 'free', 'frog', ""'d"", 'rescued', 'science', 'class', 'dissection', 'Zoe', 'frequently', 'inner', 'world', 'fascination', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Frog', 'Prince', 'pond', 'park', 'frog', 'farewell', 'good', 'luck', 'kiss', 'Moments', 'later', 'addled', 'man', 'folded', 'boat', 'royal', 'sash', 'webbed', 'toes', 'only', 'conclusion', 'girl', 'big', 'imagination', 'could.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'SMOOCH', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'produced', 'Hallmark', 'hopefully', 'even', 'bringing', 'up', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'wonderfully', 'whimsical', 'Young', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'delightful', 'raising', 'acting', 'creds', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'bring', 'up', 'two-time', 'SAG', 'Award-winning', 'actor', 'film', 'Zoe', 'whom', 'lively', 'wistful', 'fanciful', 'Zoe', 'great', 'hope', 'targeting', 'upcoming', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'when', 'widowed', 'mom', 'Gwen', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'mystery', 'knight', 'Zoe', ""n't"", 'contemplating', 'one', 'bit', 'when', 'mom', 'hiring', 'new', 'nanny', 'what', 'Frog', 'Prince', 'Zoe', 'dubs', 'Flynn', 'Stewart', 'frog', 'hero', 'favorite', 'book', 'Percy', 'English', 'Royal', 'now', 'amnesia', 'along', 'got', 'grin', 'reading', 'one', 'papers', 'Zoe', 'up', 'validate', 'nanny', 'position', 'read', 'Flynn', 'Stewart', 'Nanny', 'Man', 'Servant', 'Royal', 'Diginifed', 'Society', 'yes', 'Diginifed', '.Simon', 'Kassianides', 'terrific', 'imagine', 'ladies', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'way', 'lines', 'nothing', 'Englishman', 'roll', 'off', 'eloquent', 'dialogue', 'sense', 'satisfaction', 'derived', 'watching', 'character', 'growth', 'vain', 'nobleman', 'charming', 'caring', 'nanny', 'Kassianides', 'effortless', 'transition', 'Kellie', 'Martin', 'solid', 'less', 'showy', 'role', 'playing', 'Zoe', 'guarded', 'mom', 'who', 'opening', 'heart', 'Kassianides', 'strike', 'up', 'sparks', 'honestly', 'chemistry', 'Kassianides', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'up', 'screen', 'plot', 'obstacle', 'must', 'Percy', 'impending', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'debilitating', 'vertigo', 'mother', 'seeming', 'inflexibility', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'enough', 'traction', 'derail', 'fractured', 'Frog', 'Prince', 'fairy', 'tale', 'loved', 'SMOOCH', 'plan', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'nieces', 'Watching', 'know', 'happily', 'ever', 'store', 'getting', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Again', 'Kiernan', 'Shipka', 'impression', 'may', 'start', 'watching', 'MAD', 'MEN']",Smooch

The girl hauls him off in a grocery cart taking him home to hide in her closet- yes, one must suspend reality quickly in this movie- with the plan to matchmake with her lonely, overly organized, widowed mother(Kellie Martin, still alive after ""ER"").There's a lot to swallow here.  The daughter convinces the mom to keep the man as a nanny- shades of ""Family Affair"".  He is handsome and very properly polite. So, no big deal.  Right. And the predictable romance ensues.  The problem pops up with his past, and that he is already engaged and of nobility.  Will love out?Kiernan Shipka steals and carries the show; I found the chemistry somewhat lacking between the mom and the prince.  Perhaps, the way Kellie Martin plays the mom with such severity dampened it for me.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.It's fun enough and does what's expected of it.  I'd give it 3 stars, but for Shipka's energy and the fact, my young daughters like it-> OK, OK 4 stars.
