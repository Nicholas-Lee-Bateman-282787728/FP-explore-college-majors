Movies also require a script, believable dialog and characterization. And if you think there is hot sex here, you should also look elsewhere. There are two gay sex scenes in the movie, one which only hints at the act and is interspersed with closeups of James character talking about semen and sucking on a lime. The other was filmed from behind in a stairwell with photography that reminded me of Mapplethorpe. Both are short and lacking in much erotic appeal. In another scene he bangs away at a girl in a bed surrounded by an ample bedspread as we see a picture of her boyfriend in uniform fall off a table. No idea why that was in the film because there is not one ounce of humor anywhere else. You also see lots of backsides, especially floating in one of the executive's pools. But if you were hoping to at least see someone's junk for the pain of enduring this disaster, forget it. Hokey facial expressions completely replace graphic eroticism.This writer has NO idea how to tell a story. The film is a sloppy mess of vignettes whose attempts at dialog convey either strange bits of poetry, dry information or terrible cliches. This torture tries to be an Art Film, by totally replacing characterization with poetry and one liners. It comes closest photographically to being Film Noir. Unfortunately, the script is so bad it can't sustain even one emotion, much less advance the non-existent plot. You end up not understanding or caring about one person. Even Dean's neglected boyfriend works your last nerve as his constant literary references completely replace normal human emotions.Forget learning anything more about James Dean here. You find out more about James Dean from the written epilogue at the end of the film than from the entire movie....and no it doesn't end with the car crash it ends when he goes to New York. Yes you learn (not see) that he is sleeping with two movie executives, but you aren't even told who they are.

The script tries hard to be poetic but often comes off as stilted instead. And some of the acting feels memorized rather than felt and thought.That being said, there is still a lot going for it. The scenes in the desert are almost alarmingly beautiful, nearly overshadowing the little drama taking place between the characters. Some of the acting is quite good. I especially enjoyed watching Dalilah Rain, who brings a real sense of lived life to her role as an actress who never found her fame in Hollywood. Also good is James Preston who plays James Dean. By that I don't mean that he's a good actor, but like so many stars from the old days of Hollywood, he's someone you like to look at, is intriguing and charismatic and hints at depths he withholds just enough to make you want more of him. So, he's not James Dean, but then, who is?Even with it's faults, this is a haunting film that creates and maintains - for the most part - a mood of darkness and sorrow, too cool to be noir, but blessedly free of irony or condescension. This is a gay indie film with a small budget and not a lot of time to rehearse or shoot. Still it manages to achieve something - a feeling, a mood, a sense of life slipping away - that makes this a film I'd recommend to others.",4,Haunting But Disappointing,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1409,"['Joshua', 'Tree', '1951', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'set', 'costumed', 'more', 'curated', 'effort', 'living', 'story', 'James', 'Dean', 'early', 'days', 'script', 'hard', 'be', 'poetic', 'often', 'off', 'stilted', 'instead', 'acting', 'feels', 'memorized', 'rather', 'felt', 'being', 'said', 'still', 'lot', 'going', 'scenes', 'desert', 'are', 'almost', 'alarmingly', 'beautiful', 'nearly', 'overshadowing', 'little', 'drama', 'taking', 'place', 'characters', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Dalilah', 'Rain', 'who', 'real', 'sense', 'lived', 'life', 'role', 'actress', 'who', 'never', 'found', 'fame', 'Hollywood', 'Also', 'good', 'James', 'Preston', 'who', 'James', 'Dean', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'good', 'actor', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'old', 'days', 'Hollywood', 'someone', 'look', 'intriguing', 'charismatic', 'hints', 'depths', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'more', 'So', 'not', 'James', 'Dean', 'then', 'who', 'Even', 'faults', 'haunting', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'mood', 'darkness', 'sorrow', 'too', 'cool', 'be', 'noir', 'blessedly', 'free', 'irony', 'condescension', 'gay', 'indie', 'film', 'small', 'budget', 'not', 'lot', 'time', 'rehearse', 'shoot', 'Still', 'achieve', 'something', 'feeling', 'mood', 'sense', 'life', 'slipping', 'away', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'others']","A Portrait of James Dean: Joshua Tree, 1951"

This is not a linear narrative but a collage of moments and thoughts that form a picture. You have to be willing to wait and listen and search for the meanings.  The cinematography is superb.  Dean is less an enigma but a person who made his own way, who constantly searched for an anchor.  He was not a naf crushed by fame, rather he knew what he wanted and how to get it.  He seemed to be a seductive personality, one of those people who seduce everyone around him.  It's a nice balance of dialogue and visual themes, sometimes brainy, sometimes visceral.  I found myself hooked from the beginning, sort of lulled into it and once in I couldn't escape. I don't know that the film really explains Dean so much as explains why he was unexplainable.

And why is Dan Glenn billed as simply The Roommate and not Bill Bast who he is really supposed to be?  And why does Bast's - er, The Roommate, sorry - why does his Mom not translate the longish French poem she reads to us, the audience?  And James Preston looks and acts not a lick like the Little B.  Actually, in some scenes and especially in profile he looks more like the young Bud Brando and full on much like Ty Hardin.  But who gives a fig about Ty Hardin anymore, even though Preston would probably do much better in a biopic of that actor.  Vocally, he sounds uncannily like Toby McGuire - and, again, he projects naught of the character and charisma of the Real ""Dean"" Deal.  Stephen McHattie nailed so very much of Dean's quicksilver personality in the 1976 TV movie JAMES DEAN - and, scripted by Bill Bast, The Roommate goes by his God-given name!  Now there was a darn good movie if you want to learn miles and miles more about Jimmy.  That fine flick covered it all, from UCLA to the lean and hungry hustling days rooming with the Roommate, I mean Bill Bast, and it took its viewers to Fairmount to explore Jimmy's Hoosier roots some and then on to Broadway where it touched on Dean's bisexuality with bravery, back to Hollywood and stardom and then we're taken on that final trip in the Porsche Spyder.  ""The Little Prince"" is also in that earlier take (ending with it, as does this current film) but in the '76er it is used to such poetic, incredibly tear-producing effect accompanied by a truly great musical score by Billy Goldenberg and... Wait!  I was reviewing this ""Joshua Tree"" rendition.  Heck, a comparison was inevitable, however - and after writing this I think I'll pop in that earlier effort and enjoy a fairly remarkable film indeed.The trouble with A PORTRAIT OF JAMES DEAN is simply that it is way too sketchy and barely informative and pretty poorly acted all over and too preoccupied with butt and despite some artsy photography the movie misses the mark by miles and miles.  If you watched this movie and didn't know it was ostensibly about James Dean, you'd probably never realize that it was supposed to be about him at all!

1641435,A1REL11SYBDAJI,B00C1LIZI0,RMK,"[3, 4]","While Mishory's film moves slowly and has little to no plot, he creates a beautifully impressionistic film that gives what is likely the most accurate impression of James Dean ever rendered.  Instead of going in a biographical direction - most of which Dean fans know anyway - Mishory creates the essence of Dean in the way Monet, for example, created the essence of water lilies, using bits and pieces, sometimes seemingly unconnected, to provide an overall more realistic impression.  I think Mishory asked, How do I present a portrait of James Dean that reveals a more truthful or close-to-home vision of him than a strictly biographical film would?  And I think he answered this question exceptionally well with ""Joshua Tree, 1951"" - by using, with film, the techniques used by the great painters of Impressionism.I've never been fascinated by Dean himself (though I think he was brilliant in the three films by which we know him), but more by the iconic aura that developed around him after his death.  This aura remains today, in the same way it remains around Monroe or Garland.  So I AM fascinated by the reasons behind this status given to the three of them and a very few others.  Why these few?  Untimely death, perhaps.  But Monroe and Garland didn't die as young as Dean did.  River Phoenix died young, but he still hasn't gained an equally iconic aura.  The only conclusion I've come to at this point is that the reason we cast this aura on so few actors - which we do; we GIVE them the aura --- has to do with a combination of things.  One is our knowledge of their personal lives, true or false; all the tabloid guesses and theories, the stresses and strains, the peccadilloes, the misfit quality of them.  Another is the vision of them provided by the camera.  We often hear that Monroe, especially, made love, in a way, to movie cameras, as though she had a direct and very strong understanding of cameras, almost a relationship with them, and always knew instinctively how to appear in front of them to put across her beauty, her talent, and large parts of her personality and persona: her innocence, her vulnerability.  Watching all three of them in their films, we the audience feel that we KNOW them, very personally.  We feel that they're talking to us, to each of us individually.  We connect to them in a way we don't often connect to most actors.  Gloria Swanson, I think, achieves this in ""Sunset Boulevard"" - and we'd likely cast a similar aura around her had she done this in a greater number of films.  Garland was able to do this even in brief moments.  Watch ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""The Man That Got Away"" again - really WATCH them - and ask yourself to whom she's singing.  It's to you, isn't it?  It IS!  But guess what?  It's to every other person sitting in that theater, too, and each of them would answer this question the same way: she's singing to me.So, again, how do you make a film about any of these icons that, instead of presenting a dry biography with no sense of the person behind the icon, instead presents the person behind the icon?  You head in the direction of Impressionism.I came away from this film feeling that I'd met and had a beer or a glass of wine with Dean, and that I'd gotten to know HIM as opposed to the iconic image of him on the movie screen.
