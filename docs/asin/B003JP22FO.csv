What he finds has him going in circles as he tries to uncover the truth about what actually happened and the cause of the disappearance of the scientist. Pretty soon he cannot tell the truth from the lies much less reality from delusion. The movie keeps you guessing and becomes intense during the last 30 minutes of the movies. It is certainly worth watching if only for the mystery and discovering what is really going on.

1347701,A3W3RX6IVRQNZG,B003JP22FO,Bureau,"[1, 1]","This was, first off, not a terrible movie.  The cinematography was pretty good, the mine had some genuine atmosphere, the effects (while corny) weren't terrible, the plot had definite possibilities, the acting was pretty when it wasn't weighed down by campy writing.  It's just that this movie itself felt like it had no idea what it wanted to be; like they started off with one script writer who wanted to make a B Horror movie about a mining crew finding hell, then midway through switched to another writer who wanted to go for more of a pretentious and mildly preachy psychological thriller.Let's talk about the B-Movie side of 9 Miles Down first.  Throughout the film you will encounter numerous familiar horror movie tropes  like the walls that squirt blood or the spoooooky old witch lady.  If you've never seen a horror movie before, you may be frightened.  If not, you will find them about as disturbing as a Charlie Brown sheet ghost rattling plastic chains and making woo-woo noises.  These could be written off as build-up.  If they'd stepped up their game, pumped the originality in the third act and, say, taken us, I dunno, nine miles down to Hell as the title and cover of this movie would suggest, there would have been some pay-off.  Instead we end up with a climax that makes the Burger King seem disturbing in comparison.Because, you see, this movie is really not a horror film.  It's a psychological thriller that's really more of a philosophical debate between Thomas Jackman, a security guard who believes (albeit nominally) in the supernatural, and Doctor Christianson, who believes that everything has a logical explanation... even the screams and demonic presences that seem to be emanating from a shaft her crew dug nine miles into the earth's crust.  Sadly, this turned into a lot of squandered potential.Why?  Because the director tries to sell the supernatural side of the plot with the same conviction most Disney puts into convincing us the villain is really just trying to help the princess out by giving her that apple.  Every time something spooky happens, someone immediately shows up to debunk it.  There is an entire subplot concerning Christianson possibly being the devil that is debunked with such regularity that when Jackman continues to believe it we think he's a moron and a psychopath.  Any feeling of suspense or build-up is immediately squashed, which makes this not so much of a debate or discussion, but a straw-man argument against the possibility of ghosts or hell or any of the supernatural crap they're trying to sell us on the cover.When it comes down to it, this film was, at best, pretentious, stupid, and mildly silly, and at worst a slap in the face to whomever they were aiming this nonsense at.",2,"Not Terrible, but Rather Pretentious and Silly",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,2755,"['was', 'first', 'off', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'mine', 'had', 'genuine', 'atmosphere', 'effects', 'corny', 'were', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'plot', 'had', 'definite', 'possibilities', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'weighed', 'down', 'campy', 'writing', 'just', 'movie', 'felt', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'started', 'off', 'one', 'script', 'writer', 'who', 'wanted', 'make', 'B', 'Horror', 'movie', 'mining', 'crew', 'finding', 'hell', 'then', 'midway', 'switched', 'writer', 'who', 'wanted', 'go', 'more', 'pretentious', 'mildly', 'preachy', 'psychological', 'thriller.Let', 'talk', 'B-Movie', 'side', '9', 'Miles', 'Down', 'first', 'film', 'will', 'encounter', 'numerous', 'familiar', 'horror', 'movie', 'tropes', 'walls', 'squirt', 'blood', 'spoooooky', 'old', 'witch', 'lady', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'horror', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'frightened', 'not', 'will', 'find', 'about', 'as', 'disturbing', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'sheet', 'ghost', 'rattling', 'plastic', 'chains', 'making', 'woo-woo', 'noises', 'could', 'be', 'written', 'off', 'build-up', ""'d"", 'stepped', 'up', 'game', 'pumped', 'originality', 'third', 'act', 'say', 'taken', 'dunno', 'nine', 'miles', 'down', 'Hell', 'title', 'cover', 'movie', 'would', 'suggest', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pay-off', 'Instead', 'end', 'up', 'climax', 'Burger', 'King', 'seem', 'disturbing', 'comparison.Because', 'see', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'really', 'more', 'philosophical', 'debate', 'Thomas', 'Jackman', 'security', 'guard', 'who', 'nominally', 'supernatural', 'Doctor', 'Christianson', 'who', 'everything', 'logical', 'explanation', 'even', 'screams', 'demonic', 'presences', 'seem', 'be', 'emanating', 'shaft', 'crew', 'dug', 'nine', 'miles', 'earth', 'crust', 'Sadly', 'turned', 'lot', 'squandered', 'potential.Why', 'director', 'sell', 'supernatural', 'side', 'plot', 'same', 'conviction', 'most', 'Disney', 'convincing', 'villain', 'really', 'just', 'trying', 'help', 'princess', 'out', 'giving', 'apple', 'time', 'something', 'spooky', 'happens', 'someone', 'immediately', 'up', 'debunk', 'entire', 'subplot', 'concerning', 'Christianson', 'possibly', 'being', 'devil', 'debunked', 'such', 'regularity', 'when', 'Jackman', 'believe', 'think', 'moron', 'psychopath', 'feeling', 'suspense', 'build-up', 'immediately', 'squashed', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'debate', 'discussion', 'straw-man', 'argument', 'possibility', 'ghosts', 'hell', 'supernatural', 'crap', ""'re"", 'trying', 'sell', 'cover.When', 'down', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'pretentious', 'stupid', 'mildly', 'silly', 'worst', 'slap', 'face', 'whomever', 'were', 'aiming', 'nonsense']",N/A
