While the characters are the same and some of the actors are the same, Gildy just didn't make it on the big screen.  The stories and acting are pretty forced and actually hard to watch.  In two of the movies they even brought in Richard LaGrange to play his Mr. Peevey character and after a while his &#34;Well, I wouldn't say that&#34; gets old and tiring.

A few years ago, I bought The Great Gildersleeve Movie Collection from another site. I was disappointed when I saw the packaging; one thin case with one DVD. I played the disc and part way through each of the four movies, the audio and picture got out of sync. This was very annoying and distracting. I paid about $9 for it, and so I just decided to keep it,thinking that thats probably as good as it gets since that was the only site even advertising this movie collection. When I saw this collection offered by Amazon the other day, I just had to take a chance and Im glad I did! This DVD is much better, the audio and picture are in sync and stay that way throughout each movie, and the picture is better quality than the other DVD I bought years earlier. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and I recommend it to any Gildersleeve fan.",5,The Great Gildersleeve!,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",2013,985,"['Im', 'OTR', 'fan', 'Im', 'especially', 'fond', 'Great', 'Gildersleeve', 'own', 'lot', 'Gildersleeve', 'episodes', 'cd', 'even', 'audio', 'cassette', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'Great', 'Gildersleeve', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'site', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'saw', 'packaging', 'one', 'thin', 'case', 'one', 'DVD', 'played', 'disc', 'part', 'way', 'four', 'movies', 'audio', 'picture', 'got', 'sync', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'distracting', 'paid', 'about', '9', 'so', 'just', 'decided', 'keep', 'thinking', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'only', 'site', 'even', 'advertising', 'movie', 'collection', 'When', 'saw', 'collection', 'offered', 'Amazon', 'other', 'day', 'just', 'had', 'take', 'chance', 'Im', 'glad', 'did', 'DVD', 'much', 'better', 'audio', 'picture', 'are', 'sync', 'stay', 'way', 'movie', 'picture', 'better', 'quality', 'other', 'DVD', 'bought', 'years', 'earlier', 'Overall', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'purchase', 'recommend', 'Gildersleeve', 'fan']",The Great Gildersleeve Movie Collection
