1379908,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B0041ETK0M,Amit Talpade,"[1, 3]","This coming of age story by debutant director is a must watch. The movie is about a young student (Rajat  Barmecha) who has recently been expelled from his school. He returns home to meet his father whom he has not met for 8 years and 6 year old half brother. His father (Ronit Roy, a superstar on Indian TV) is an authoritarian and at best communicative only when he had a few drinks. His Uncle (Ram Kapoor) is the only one who tries to understand and bond with him. Against his wishes he has to enroll in an engineering college and work in his father's workshop. Things soon come to a boiling point between this young man and his father.I thought this was a great film especially given the young unknown cast, the locations in Jameshedpur are spectacular, and the music is okay.

I had not heard anything about Udaan, but I ordered it on Netflix.  I found this to be as good as any of theabove mentioned films.  The performances of the entire cast, and the script and story were exceptional.  The ending broughttears to my eyes.  A terrific film, in my opinion better than &#34;Khan&#34;, which won the Filmfare award the same year as best picture,as I felt the ending of that film betrayed the first 2 hours.",5,Ranks With The Best of India Cinema,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,568,"['being', 'awed', 'TZM', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'Outsourced', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'My', 'Name', 'Is', 'Khan', 'started', 'watching', 'moreBollywood', 'films', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'anything', 'Udaan', 'ordered', 'Netflix', 'found', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'theabove', 'mentioned', 'films', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'script', 'story', 'were', 'exceptional', 'ending', 'broughttears', 'eyes', 'terrific', 'film', 'opinion', 'better', '34', 'Khan', '34', 'won', 'Filmfare', 'same', 'year', 'best', 'picture', 'felt', 'ending', 'film', 'betrayed', 'first', '2', 'hours']",Udaan

His father, an abusive factory owner, decides Rohan needs to become an engineer (""Yes, sir,"" Rohan replies).  But Rohan wants to be a writer.  He's already a great storyteller.  Meanwhile, Rohan struggles to develop a relationship with his younger half-brother, who wasn't even born when he left for boarding school.This is a story of a dysfunctional family.  Udann is a movie that would work even if it wasn't centered in India, since the issues - physical abuse, parental love, abandonment, conflicting goals - occur worldwide.  Indeed, if this was a story centered in, say, Detroit, it would still work.In this subtitled version, the color of the subtitling was such that there were many occasions, particularly at the end of the movie, when the light background made it very difficult to read.  That's a real production problem.The India presented here was not the noisy, crowded, impoverished India featured in many other India-centered movies that make it to the United States.  It focuses on relationships.The actors, and the acting, were perfect for this movie.

This story of a severely dysfunctional family with a teenage boy tugging hard at the last remaining strings that hold the family in place is full of heart and soul. The unblemished performances of the actors take it to another level.Udaan is peppered with some hilarious moments but at times the artiness catches up and you have a dragging moment. This is one of those movies which once you watch you sort of feel empowered ...like maybe you can do anything you want if you put your heart into it! If the father shown in the film is anywhere close to yours you'll feel happy that there's some hope for you to get over it all.
