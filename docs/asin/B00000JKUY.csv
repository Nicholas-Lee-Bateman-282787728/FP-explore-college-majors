They get fired from their job and kicked out of their apartment, so Feldman's uncle that is an ex-pirate actor magically warps them to his island to become scuba instructors, but his uncle's old on screen nemesis tries to take over the island and blah blah blah. I would like to meet the guy that wrote this script and thougth he had something special. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the two Corey's are in it, and both of them rule, they just got caught in a very bad movie.",2,WOW!

Ronthi ""TheGreatSwindle""","[2, 3]","1.5/5When they made this flick, the National Lampoon series was pretty much outta funds, outta time, and not nearly as popular as it was during the 70's and 80's. They had literally done everything; hence, the title.No, the joke was squarely on the two Corey's.I think it is unfortunate that they did this to their careers. They were talented until they started thinking they didn't have to work in quality films. You have to take small rolls sometimes...it's the truth.Look at their resumes pre-'90 in comparison to anything post. It is aweful.
