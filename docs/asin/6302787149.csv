Alec Baldwin plays a cadet who gets set up during the trial of his fellow cadet. The movie is fast as the miltary is trying to avoid a media frenzy on the base.  This movie also deals with gays and the miltary. There is a slight hint that maybe the cadet was killed by a gay lover. Of course the miltary back then would not like this stuff out to the media. The movie is a very suspenseful thriller in the 1960's! This video features an an all star cast Alec Baldwin(The Hunt For Red Ocober,Mecury Rising),Lane Smith(Superman TV series)Lloyd Bridges(the hot shot movies) and others! look for some up and coming stars in this video as well!",5,A suspensful miltary thriller set in the 1960's!,954028800,"03 26, 2000",2000,770,"['video', 'miltary', 'school', '1960', 'cadethas', 'died.The', 'miltary', 'are', 'looking', 'matter', 'Everyone', 'issuspect', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'cadet', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'trial', 'fellow', 'cadet', 'movie', 'fast', 'miltary', 'trying', 'avoid', 'media', 'frenzy', 'base', 'movie', 'also', 'gays', 'miltary', 'slight', 'hint', 'maybe', 'cadet', 'was', 'killed', 'gay', 'lover', 'course', 'miltary', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'stuff', 'media', 'movie', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', '1960', 'video', 'star', 'cast', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Hunt', 'Red', 'Ocober', 'Mecury', 'Rising', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Superman', 'TV', 'series', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'hot', 'shot', 'movies', 'others', 'look', 'up', 'coming', 'stars', 'video', 'as', 'well']",Dress Gray VHS

A cadet's body has been found dead by drowning.  The protagonist (Alex Baldwin, in a bravo performance, one of his best) learns that there is more to the death than meets the eye, and that a cover-up is in progress.  The story develops quickly, and it is a powerful story of military politics, gays in the military, and other controversial topics.  The film has a gothic feel to it, and constitutes first-rate entertainment.
