861670,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00066FBQQ,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[49, 60]","Last year, when this show came on, I dismissed as yet another trendy crime show.  I chose not to watch it, but my dad really got into it.  Every now and then, I'd see bits and pieces of the show, and for the most part, I liked what I saw, whether it was actual plot, beautiful women, or great panoramic views of Las Vegas.  Eventually, I started watching the show, and here is my final conclusion: my first assumption was not far off, but maybe that's not such a bad thing.The series centers around the security team of the fictional Monticeto Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.  The team is headed by Ed Deline (James Caan), an ex-CIA operative who apparently can make grown men cry using nothing but a fork.  Ed's right-hand man is Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel), a former Marine.  And he isn't an actual part of the security team, valet Mike Cannon (James Lesure) often lends a helping hand to investigations due to his engineering degree (even though he could be doing other things, he prefers to be a valet).  The rest of the main cast includes the Entertainment Director (and possibly ex-escort) Mary Connell (Nikki Cox), Casino Host Samantha Jane Marquez (Vanessa Marcil), pit boss Nessa Holt (Marsha Thompson), and Ed's sexually active daughter Delinda (Molly Sims), who eventually becomes the host of the Monticeto's main restaurant, Mystique.  Each character brings something different to the casino.  Sam is a cold and calculating woman who can get almost anything done for a client.  Nessa is one of Vegas' best and most intelligent pit bosses.  Mary has a good eye for talent and is the softie of the group.  And Delinda's ""knowledge"" of what is hip transformed Mystique into one of Vegas' most popular restaurants.The stories are pretty episodic.  For the most part, plots involve cheaters, murders, thieves, and scams from other casinos, but that doesn't mean that things are limited to those events.  One of my favorite episodes involves a power loss throughout the city.  In addition to the episodic plots, there are a few mini-arcs that develop throughout the season.  Ed and Danny's relationship is put to the test when, in the first thing that happens in the entire series, Ed catches Danny sleeping with Delinda.  Danny and Mary's ""relationship troubles"" is probably the most developped arc.  Danny and Mary grew up together in Vegas, and they have a very special bond (I won't say what it is).  This storyline is both a strength and a weakness for the show, because it is an interesting story, but at the same time, the writers have trouble giving the actors good dialogue in which to tell the story.  In the episode where a lot of their history is revealed, I both liked and hated the scenes with the two of them going through the events (they were stuck in an elevator, so they had a lot of time to talk).For a first season show, Las Vegas must have had a HUGE budget.  Not only did they have James Caan as a regular, but they got some very famous, and probably very expensive guest stars, such as Wayne Newton, Jean Claude Van Damme, Sugar Ray and Mark McGrath, Penn and Teller, Paul Anka, Blue Man Group, and Alec Baldwin.  Other guest stars of note include Jon Lovitz (who probably would have been in the first category a few years ago), Sean Astin, Elliot Gould, and Harry Groener (the guy who played the Mayor on Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  Furthermore, since the show was only filmed in Vegas for the pilot, they had to reconstruct the casino they used for all subsequent shows.  The set is a very loyal adaptation of the interior of the Mandalay Bay, and it looks very expensive.A few of the biggest surprises that I found with this show dealt with its crew.  The creator, Gary Scott Thompson, is responsible for some of my most hated movies ever, yet, not only do I enjoy this show, I find it leagues ahead of said films.  Also, one of the producers/writers is Rebecca Rand Kirchner, who worked on a few of my all-time favorite shows, so when I saw her name, I was really excited.Ok, having gone over the good stuff, it is time to address the negatives.  A lot of things that happen seem very unrealistic, such as Jon Lovitz's winning streak, Mike's ability to beat an expert poker player after a huge absence from the game, or Sam coming in second place in a competitive eating contest (the girl looks like she weighs 100 pounds, and in the context of the episode, I think it would have been much funnier for her to have to lose).  Also, in the first few episodes, events were narrated by Danny, which was not very insightful.  Fortunately, the inner monalogue was quickly phased out.  Speaking of Danny, there were some times when my belief in him as an ex-Marine was called into question, but for the most part, I'm willing to accept that backstory.  There were some other character problems.  In my opinion, Delinda's intelligence levels seemed to fluctuate.  She was never stupid by any means, yet sometimes, she seemed to be of normal intelligence and at other times, she seemed to be above average.The good aspects of this show far outweigh the bad, and while this show is nothing new or special, I find myself liking it a lot due to its setting, eye candy, and guest list.  This is definitely not for everyone, but I think that many people can find something that they like about it.",4,A Fun Guilty Pleasure,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,5316,"['Last', 'year', 'when',

Bowling,"[10, 15]","I'm a big fan of Las Vegas - both the city and the television show - so I was ecstatic to hear that a first-season DVD was ready for release so soon. Now I can watch it without annoying commercials and at a more convenient time.Imagine how disappointed I was to start the second episode and hear what sounded like a terrible audio problem where I should be hearing Elvis' booming baritone!I'm not a musically inclined person; I'm one of those people for whom music videos were invented. It's often the case that a song doesn't even reach my ears until it's paired with a great visual. It's likely I've heard Elvis' ""Little Less Conversation"" many times but never paid attention until it was played over the opening to this show.To me, a show's theme song is a character in the program. It's the greeter at a casino or the warm-up band at a concert. Imagine, for example, if the theme to Green Acres had been performed by a screaming heavy metal band. Having that lumpy, draggy replacement tune open for Las Vegas when I was expecting the Elvis number had the same effect as if Josh Duhamel were replaced by lame, uninspiring Josh Hartnett in each of the episodes.Regardless of the opening song problem, this DVD set is great for fans of the show. There are so many reasons to like this show: authentic sets, quick pacing, eye candy (for both sexes, I'm told, but catering more to us men) and Danny's cool yellow '69 Camaro. As many times as I've been to the city of Las Vegas, I can imagine its behind-the-scenes dramas and stories being similar to those in the show.My only criticism of the show since episode one is that the scripts seem like first drafts that never go through revision. They have some real gems in them, but no one takes the time to polish them and arrange them in a quality manner. Changes in plot are manhandled like a drunk getting escorted from the blackjack tables.I hope more attention is paid to the writing in future episodes. Maybe the studio will hire more staff so scripts don't have to be rushed into production now that the show is a success.",4,One more gripe about that stupid new theme song!,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,2075,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'city', 'television', 'show', 'so', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'hear', 'first-season', 'DVD', 'was', 'ready', 'release', 'so', 'soon', 'Now', 'can', 'watch', 'annoying', 'commercials', 'more', 'convenient', 'time.Imagine', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'start', 'second', 'episode', 'hear', 'what', 'sounded', 'terrible', 'audio', 'problem', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'hearing', 'Elvis', 'booming', 'baritone', ""'m"", 'not', 'musically', 'inclined', 'person', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'whom', 'music', 'videos', 'were', 'invented', 'often', 'case', 'song', ""n't"", 'even', 'reach', 'ears', 'paired', 'great', 'visual', 'likely', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Elvis', 'Little', 'Less', 'Conversation', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'paid', 'attention', 'was', 'played', 'opening', 'show.To', 'show', 'theme', 'song', 'character', 'program', 'greeter', 'casino', 'warm-up', 'band', 'concert', 'Imagine', 'example', 'theme', 'Green', 'Acres', 'had', 'been', 'performed', 'screaming', 'heavy', 'metal', 'band', 'Having', 'lumpy', 'draggy', 'replacement', 'tune', 'open', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'when', 'was', 'expecting', 'Elvis', 'number', 'had', 'same', 'effect', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'were', 'replaced', 'lame', 'uninspiring', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'episodes.Regardless', 'opening', 'song', 'problem', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'fans', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'reasons', 'like', 'show', 'authentic', 'sets', 'quick', 'pacing', 'eye', 'candy', 'sexes', ""'m"", 'told', 'catering', 'more', 'men', 'Danny', 'cool', 'yellow', 'Camaro', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'been', 'city', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'can', 'imagine', 'behind-the-scenes', 'dramas', 'stories', 'being', 'similar', 'show.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'show', 'episode', 'one', 'scripts', 'seem', 'first', 'drafts', 'never', 'go', 'revision', 'have', 'real', 'gems', 'one', 'time', 'polish', 'arrange', 'quality', 'manner', 'Changes', 'plot', 'are', 'manhandled', 'drunk', 'getting', 'escorted', 'blackjack', 'tables.I', 'hope', 'more', 'attention', 'paid', 'writing', 'future', 'episodes', 'Maybe', 'studio', 'will', 'hire', 'more', 'staff', 'so', 'scripts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'rushed', 'production', 'now', 'show', 'success']",N/A

Hell, they were even going to cancel Scrubs with no Series finale after that was on even more years than Las Vegas, ""too bad ABC didn't pick up Las Vegas as well"". That goes to show just how un-loyal NBC is to the fans of their shows. Strike, or no writers strike, it was still a pretty dumb decision. The re-runs are even doing well on TNT. There's not many shows that aren't Law and Order that are on 2 hours each day. It's doing much better than Alias re-runs did on the network.I miss the Las Vegas atmosphere as well as the cast. James Caan was great as Ed, the head boss of the casino. Sure, he was gone the last season and I missed him then but the show still had some life in it with Tom Sellack taking his place. Josh Duhamel also is good as Danny, the top security guy who made the mistake of sleeping with Ed's daughter Delinda (Molly Sims) in the series premiere. James Lesure is fun as Danny's partner who's in charge of security cameras. While all the women are sexy and entertaining. Nikki Cox plays Mary, Danny's childhood best friend who secretly loves him.I always thought that Vanessa Marcil was the sexiest though as Sam who's ahead of making sure the guests are happy. However, after seeing the first seasons on TNT, my favorite would have to be Marsha Thomason  as Nessa Holt who Ed raised since childhood. She has a sexy voice and to me she's the most likable. Too bad she was only  in 2 seasons. Mary could whine sometimes and be overly confrontational with Danny in some episodes. While Delinda lives off her daddies money and wouldn't even have a job without him.The cameos in the first season were great as well. Jean-Claude Van Damme makes a funny appearance as himself and the episode takes a turn that you don't expect it to. You also get an appearance by Alec Baldwin as a long time friend of Ed's. Jon Lovitz also appears as a suicidal guest that Ed and Danny cheer up by getting him into gambling. His 2nd appearance in the show is a little better than his first though. He's more serious in his first appearance. He's funnier the 2nd time around. Which isn't until the 2nd season I think.

As far as the ""uncensored"" part is concerned, I've only found two scenes that were probably cut for TV.  The couple in the elevator in the pilot episode, and the wet-t-shirt contest in ""New Orleans"" (networks hate nipples, ya' know).  The extras are okay, although I saw the ""Rumble in the Montecito"" AFL promo when NBC ran it during halftime of the Gator Bowl.  The Las Vegas history lesson looks too much like things I've seen on other DVDs, like the original Ocean's Eleven, ""The Rat Pack's Las Vegas"", etc. I like GST's description of ""The Night The Lights Went Out in Vegas"" as a ""bottle show""...just the main cast, no unusual exteriors, the main sets (that aren't fully lit) and a few extras who don't have lines (another cost saver).  By the way, for the trivia buffs, the blonde that winks at Danny is Christa Sauls, the computer specialist from ""Acapulco H.E.A.T"".But, since the big gripe everyone has is about ""A Little Less Conversation"" (for the record, this IS the version that was going to be used in Elvis' 68 special, but not the JXL remixed version), hopefully I can clear something up.  The average cost to clear a song for TV is $2,500 per minute, per use.  For home video, it's $1,000. So, for this package, at the low end, it would have cost $23,000 to have this in every episode in the package. But that is a low figure, as I am sure that an Elvis song goes for much more.  So we get it for the pilot, and that's it.

The served up is the flash and flavor of Vegas, with a peek at the goings on in the back of the house of a major casino.The cast is headed by veteran James Caan, as Ed Deline, head of operations.  Caan has the charisma to be the show's driving force, and elevate the performances of the younger ensemble cast.  His character ranges from ruthless tough guy to worried daddy, and Caan's performance is one that you'll buy almost all the time.Unlike CSI, this show is about having a good time while in Sin City.  Predictably, the Mondiceto is staffed by beautiful members of both genders, with the ladies having an edge.  Josh Duhamel is Danny McCoy, Deline's right hand man.  Through not perfect, the guy is just so damn likeable, with appeal to both sexes.  James Lesure, is Mike, a valet with an electrical engineering degree.The women of the Mondecito are striking.  Voluptuous Nikki Cox is an experienced actress with some talent.  Exotic Marsha Thomason is Nette, a casino dealer.  She looks so youthful that it's hard to believe that she's 28.  Molly Sims, who plays Deline's daughter Delinda, lacks the acting experience of some of the others, but shows improvement as the season progresses.  Best for last, ex-General Hospital star Vanessa Marcil at 35, is one of the sexiest women currently on TV.  As Sam the casino's head of hospitality, she deals with idiosyncratic patrons and the much-coveted `whales'.  Cheryl Ladd adds class whenever she guests as Mrs. Deline.The plots travel various roads, some predictable and some not so.  As long as you don't take matters too seriously, things are just fine.  Technology is a major component, though at times the reliance on video replay and video enhancement seems a bit overused.  Big name guest stars are not as common as one would expect for a show of this type.  Alec Baldwin does makes a big splash though, as an old friend of Deline's, and Jean Claude Van Damme guests in one of the season's more obscure episodes.  Extras include a few commentary tracks, better than nothing but pretty lightweight and mostly for laughs.`Las Vegas' is more eye candy, than must see TV.  There aren't enduring characters with great depth, but that doesn't keep it from being a fun distraction from the cares of the day.  And for those familiar with the place, it provides a superficial reminder of the hustle and bustle that is Sin City.",3,Glitzy fun . . .,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,2553,"['Centered', 'staff', 'operations', 'Monticeto', 'fictional', 'casino', 'located', 'strip', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'light', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'take', 'matters', 'too', 'seriously', 'served', 'up', 'flash', 'flavor', 'Vegas', 'peek', 'goings', 'back', 'house', 'major', 'casino.The', 'cast', 'headed', 'veteran', 'James', 'Caan', 'Ed', 'Deline', 'head', 'operations', 'Caan', 'charisma', 'be', 'show', 'driving', 'force', 'elevate', 'performances', 'younger', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'character', 'ruthless', 'tough', 'guy', 'worried', 'daddy', 'Caan', 'performance', 'one', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'almost', 'time.Unlike', 'CSI', 'show', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'Sin', 'City', 'Predictably', 'Mondiceto', 'staffed', 'beautiful', 'members', 'genders', 'ladies', 'having', 'edge', 'Josh', 'Duhamel', 'Danny', 'McCoy', 'Deline', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'not', 'perfect', 'guy', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'likeable', 'appeal', 'sexes', 'James', 'Lesure', 'Mike', 'valet', 'electrical', 'engineering', 'degree.The', 'women', 'Mondecito', 'are', 'striking', 'Voluptuous', 'Nikki', 'Cox', 'experienced', 'actress', 'talent', 'Exotic', 'Marsha', 'Thomason', 'Nette', 'casino', 'dealer', 'so', 'youthful', 'hard', 'believe', '28', 'Molly', 'Sims', 'who', 'Deline', 'daughter', 'Delinda', 'acting', 'experience', 'others', 'improvement', 'season', 'Best', 'last', 'ex-General', 'Hospital', 'star', 'Vanessa', 'Marcil', '35', 'one', 'sexiest', 'women', 'currently', 'TV', 'Sam', 'casino', 'head', 'hospitality', 'idiosyncratic', 'patrons', 'much-coveted', 'whales', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'class', 'whenever', 'Mrs.', 'Deline.The', 'plots', 'travel', 'various', 'roads', 'predictable', 'not', 'so', 'As', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'matters', 'too', 'seriously', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'Technology', 'major', 'component', 'though', 'times', 'reliance', 'video', 'replay', 'video', 'enhancement', 'bit', 'overused', 'Big', 'name', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'common', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'show', 'type', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'big', 'splash', 'though', 'old', 'friend', 'Deline', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'guests', 'one', 'season', 'more', 'obscure', 'episodes', 'Extras', 'include', 'few', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'better', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'mostly', 'laughs.', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'more', 'eye', 'candy', 'must', 'see', 'TV', 'are', ""n't"", 'enduring', 'characters', 'great', 'depth', ""n't"", 'keep', 'being', 'fun', 'distraction', 'cares', 'day', 'familiar', 'place', 'superficial', 'reminder', 'hustle', 'bustle', 'Sin', 'City']",N/A
861705,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B00066FBQQ,Veil_Lord,"[0, 0]","First thing, the DVD set does not have the Elvis music that opened the show when it aired in the US.  That really takes me out of the feeling of the show to be honest with you.  It's not a deal breaker, but it isn't good.The show focuses on a fictitious Las Vegas casino and the main characters are all employees.  The biggest focus is on the security angle, but there are other angles to it as well such as problems with the entertainment, trying to keep high-stakes gamblers happy, etc.  The show is fast paced and very well put together.If I had to pick out some things to complain about, at times they get a little too happy just showing this or that celebrity that I really couldn't care much less about.  There are also a couple stinkers of episodes, but I mean with what 23 in a season that's bound to happen.  I also think ""Big Ed"" is a bit old to be the physical tough guy they put him as in a few episodes.Even with minor nitpicks, the show is great and I'd highly recommend.
