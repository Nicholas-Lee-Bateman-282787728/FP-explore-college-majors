1155893,A2QNQMFKSL09DO,B0017600EW,"David Alterman ""whatwhome?""","[4, 6]","I liked this documentary.  There were a number of really great ideas touched here, but there were problems with it as well.First the good.This is a topic that is not talked about too much yet to me is very fascinating. I really enjoy looking behind the scenes of the standup comic world.The documentary in a blunt way gave the critics a little bit of ""the golden rule"".There were numerous interviews with comedians that I really admire who said some very interesting and insightful comments, such as Lewis Black, David Cross, Dave Atell, and Patton Oswalt to name a few.There were psychologists and other professionals interviewed who also made interesting points.The bad..This documentary did not really make its points clearly and concisely.  There were many good ideas touched on, but not investigated as they should have been. Such as the egos in both performers and in critics.  If Mr. Kennedy is sad about being Heckled than maybe he should consider another field of work, obviously his ego is really tied into showbiz and showbiz is not for the thin skinned.Yet, much of the heckling and criticism is very mean spirited, cruel and self-serving. Heckling is just rude.  There is usually just a drunk person who wants attention or has a personality disorder.Criticism, in my opinion, should explain why one does not like something.  Though critics are often correct in their assessments, it is not fair just to say that one does not like something, then get mean spirited about it. If one is not able to give a good reason for not liking something, then one should not be a critic.  A critic has to know what makes things good or bad, not just be intuitive about it and being mean spirited seems to be the replacement for that knowledge and it is self-serving to the critic only and does nothing to change or improve the entertainer.There were also some of the interviews which were pointless and did not add to the documentary or were redundant or tangential.",4,"interesting, but problematic in parts",1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,1965,"['liked', 'documentary', 'were', 'number', 'really', 'great', 'ideas', 'touched', 'here', 'were', 'problems', 'well.First', 'good.This', 'topic', 'not', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'yet', 'very', 'fascinating', 'really', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'scenes', 'standup', 'comic', 'world.The', 'documentary', 'blunt', 'way', 'gave', 'critics', 'little', 'bit', 'golden', 'rule', 'were', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'comedians', 'really', 'admire', 'who', 'said', 'very', 'interesting', 'insightful', 'comments', 'such', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'David', 'Cross', 'Dave', 'Atell', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'name', 'few.There', 'were', 'psychologists', 'other', 'professionals', 'interviewed', 'who', 'also', 'made', 'interesting', 'points.The', 'bad..This', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'make', 'points', 'clearly', 'concisely', 'were', 'many', 'good', 'ideas', 'touched', 'not', 'investigated', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Such', 'egos', 'performers', 'critics', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'sad', 'being', 'Heckled', 'maybe', 'should', 'consider', 'field', 'work', 'obviously', 'ego', 'really', 'tied', 'showbiz', 'showbiz', 'not', 'thin', 'skinned.Yet', 'much', 'heckling', 'criticism', 'very', 'mean', 'spirited', 'cruel', 'self-serving', 'Heckling', 'just', 'rude', 'usually', 'just', 'drunk', 'person', 'who', 'attention', 'personality', 'disorder.Criticism', 'opinion', 'should', 'explain', 'why', 'one', 'not', 'something', 'critics', 'are', 'often', 'correct', 'assessments', 'not', 'fair', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'not', 'something', 'then', 'get', 'mean', 'spirited', 'one', 'not', 'able', 'give', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'liking', 'something', 'then', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'critic', 'critic', 'know', 'what', 'things', 'good', 'bad', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'intuitive', 'being', 'mean', 'spirited', 'be', 'replacement', 'knowledge', 'self-serving', 'critic', 'only', 'nothing', 'change', 'improve', 'entertainer.There', 'were', 'also', 'interviews', 'were', 'pointless', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'documentary', 'were', 'redundant', 'tangential']",Heckler
1155894,A11STAIF0BFAXG,B0017600EW,Eveline McKinney,"[5, 14]","Ok, my bias is upfront. I have had the displeasure of watching multiple movies 'starring' Jamie Kennedy and all are the same. He plays a white man who thinks he's black who is either mentally retarded or is 'young in his mind' (not naive, but stupid). Each movie he makes is faced is a barrage of bad reviews (because they are bad) and this is his triumphant battle call....Of ""shut up!"".The gull Kennedy has is amazing. He compares critics with hecklers as if they are the same. Hecklers halt performances whereas critics write about an item AFTER the performance is done. Not only that, he seems to think that critics have nothing good to say. The fact of the matter is that the general public has a set amount of funds and have to decide whether or not to see a movie. One good place to find info is rottentomatoes or other sites with multiple reviews, highlighting the good and bad opinions. Jamie is just pissed that his page holds a miserable rating because he makes miserable movies. Rather than learn from the critics, like many wiser comedians (I can't morally call Jamie a comedian though) and many film makers. The last scene shows it all. Rather than take constructive criticism, Jamie lights his reviews on fire and dances like a moron around them.What's even more horrible is that the heckler in Jamie's audience is FUNNIER than Jamie is. Here, right in the trailer with no shame...Heckler - ""Why don't you make like a Kennedy and drop dead!""Kennedy - ""You know the difference between you and me? I came here in a limo.""How is that funny, Jamie? How did that put him in his place? But this is coming from an untalented, unfunny, liar. (On his personal youtube he claims he punk'd Penn and Teller on their own show by providing a short clip. If one is to watch the whole episode Penn clearly calls Kennedy and his pal out as performance artists....but hey, if you fail constantly I guess you need to create a mystical word of fantasy to think you matter)Great Job, Kennedy.

1155896,A3872KCBJEPK57,B0017600EW,"Gryphon X ""Gryphon""","[3, 4]","A good documentary could have been made on this subject, but you can get the only parts that are worth seeing by looking for heckler clips and Uwe Boll beat-down footage on YouTube. In fact, you can probably get better clips than what made it into the film. It starts off promisingly enough, with interviews and clips of comedians dealing with hecklers, but it becomes clear as the thing goes on and the focus begins to shift to critics that the filmmakers are part of their own problem. In fact, I'm pretty sure this sad excuse for a ""documentary"" was only made because somebody got their feelings hurt while hanging around a kitchen that was way too hot for them in the first place.The comedians and other interview subjects are given short shrift in favor of dwelling on some seriously embarrassing and masochistic/exhibitionistic (and exteeeeeennndeeeeeeed) misery-wallowing by Jamie Kennedy (who I'd never heard of before this, and who seems to be desperately trying to extend a fifteen minutes that ran out some time ago with this rather painful appearance), and when the ""filmmakers"" decide to bring in an expert to talk about the heckler mindset it's... Dr. Drew. (And his contributions are as glib and superficial as ever.) But what really marks this piece of work as a big time loser is the way it quickly shifts focus from hecklers to critics as if they were the same thing, demonstrating that the people who made this don't even know, or really even care, what their subject is -- they're just making the film in order to whine, which is a complete waste of the audience's time.A sad feature of contemporary culture is that most people, especially among the younger generation, seem to be unable to distinguish between criticism and abuse -- and that's on both the giving and receiving ends. Say you don't like McDonald's online and prepare for the barrage of voices demanding that you and all the food-phobic haters just shut up, as if you'd launched a vicious personal attack that demanded retaliation in kind. If you really want to see a meltdown, criticize the latest superhero movie. Just be careful -- Rotten Tomatoes had to disable comments when some critics received death threats for disliking a Batman movie. Such reactions are infantile and extreme enough to be depressing and creepy -- all the more so when you consider how many of them come from ""adults."" It's revealing to go on IMDb and see what users have to say about critics. Bad criticism seems to be criticism that disagrees with one's own opinion, and to simply have a difference of opinion is tantamount to a vicious attack. The function of criticism in many people's minds seems to be to tell people what to think, not to express one's own opinion, hopefully in a way that allows a reader to get some idea of whether or not they would like the film in question regardless of whether the critic did or not. Especially amusing is the way non-professional critics typically can't articulate what they don't like about the critics they despise, falling back on such declarations as, ""Ebert was a stupid fat pig!"" or, ""Pauline Kael was a cow!"" Granted, there's a lot of very poor criticism out there now, especially with the advent of the internet, but any discussion of what constitutes good or bad criticism, or the difference between criticism and abuse, is perfunctory in this film.Does it seem like I've gone off topic? I haven't. Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is about hecklers. (It's easy to do, with a title like 'Hecklers'.) I'm simply addressing the content of a ""documentary"" that purports to be about one thing, and then quickly reveals itself to be about something else altogether, ultimately treating neither subject in a substantial, intelligent or honest way. The focus of this already unfocused film devolves into abject whining and poorly staged reality TV-style encounters, and what we are left with is a squandered opportunity (there are some substantial interview subjects here who were ready to contribute something IF ONLY THEY HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO) because the filmmakers were more interested in indulging in some pathetic public wound-licking instead of actually making the film they claim to have set out to make. If that's the level of the filmmaking talent involved here (and my heart goes out to the genuinely talented people who agreed to take part in this project in good faith) it's no wonder they've had to take it on the chin.After having had my time wasted on such self-indulgent nonsense, I have no sympathy.",1,HEY!

1155897,AKMEY1BSHSDG7,B0017600EW,J. Arena,"[3, 5]","I have only a fleeting knowledge of Jamie Kennedy's films, and this review of Heckler is based solely on that film's content. Apparently, there is something about Kennedy that inspires outrage in an audience that is simultaneously attracted to his comedy, yet bitterly resentful of his success.  Some of these detractors are marginally in the public eye and devote way too much effort and time to heaping criticism on something they allegedly care so little about.The subject of Heckler goes way beyond the experiences of Jamie Kennedy and shows endless samples of moronic audience behavior leveled at other entertainers. The examples cover a broad range, but some are no more than playground obscenity with no real commentary offered. To balance it all out, however, we're even treated to the sight of a guitar-playing comic who went out of control and bashed a heckler over the head with his instrument. (God only knows how much he had endured before he was driven to that lapse in judgement.)But it's always the attacks against Kennedy that are the most fascinating. Watching him read some of these viscous ""reviews"" out loud to their authors was fabulous. Their floundering efforts to justify gross personal insults were laughable and adolescent.  However, in another case the intense smirking of a relentlessly insulting ""critic"" was disturbingly flirtatious and, frankly, nauseating. Mr. Kennedy is obviously a man with tremendous self-control. A lesser man would have knocked him out of his chair.Mere hecklers shout out whatever they can to instantly take attention away from the performer and put it on themselves. Are so-called professional ""critics"" any different from hecklers? In an era of sound bites, critical analysis with real content has been replaced by the clever quip with the potential to destroy the prospects of a project that took years to complete.Heckler is tremendously thought-provoking and provided real insight into the world of performers subject to this abuse.

1155898,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B0017600EW,JGC,"[1, 5]","""Heckler"" is a look behind the velvet rope, but it's an uncensored, unattractive, blunt and blatant look that some may even find shocking because it's really a topic that has never been taken so seriously; until now.Until I saw Jamie Kennedy's awesome flick, ""Heckler"" I didn't know that there are some critics who consider him unfunny. I have always been a huge Jamie Kennedy fan because he's original and so relatable. He's also a very talented writer, actor and is great with slapstick. Why someone would want to tear him down is a question that I am sure we will never get a lucid answer to.This film is about the man behind the laughs. And it's not just about Jamie, he takes a step back and we see the entire view. ""Heckler"" is a very real film that is both funny and even somewhat tragic because it shows how far our society will go to both raise people up and then tear them down out of a devious pleasure.The film includes interviews with some of the biggest entertainers including: Arsenio, Rob Zombie, Henry Winkler, Roseanne Barr and George Lucas. The film even includes rare and archival clips of President Reagan (of all people, being heckled) and even Barbra Streisand responding to a heckler at an '06 concert.There is also a lot of comedy mixed in for good measure (I love the joke Ron Jeremy said that one critic once said he had an ugly penis.) The basic message of this film is that we all have a responsibility; be it at a concert, a sporting event, a comedy show or in the anonymous world of the Internet (where it seems that the claws are sharpening just as fast as the axes are grinding), and that is to show respect to others. Because words can hurt.Included are some fascinating and informative interviews with some of comedies best men, including: Andrew 'Dice' Clay, Tom Green, Paul Rodriguez, a very unabashed and rather prolific Louie Anderson, and Jon Lovitz. I also especially enjoyed Carrot Top (the reigning poster boy for the hecklee). Carrot Top was able to provide a real prospective on what it's like to be drug through the trenches for years on end, for no other reason than viciousness. To me, someone like Carrot Top, (like Jamie Kennedy) is a true survivor because he's able to let his talent stand alone without letting the haters/hecklers/critics/bloggers/reviewers affect his art adversely.""Heckler"" is for anyone who enjoys comedy or true-to-life films that have an extraordinarily comprehensive message. Right now the film is in rotation on Showtime (good luck trying to find anything halfway decent on Home Box), but you may just want to pick up the DVD since it's priced so low (and well worth it).I never realized how sensitive Jamie Kennedy is; it must have taken a lot of courage to show this side of himself because I am sure there are some haters out there looking to sink their fangs into anything he does (no matter how artistic and creative it is). Jamie even interviews some ""professional critics"" who have gone out of their ways to bring him down. It was fascinating because all he wanted to know was ""why"" do they do it?

Driscoll,"[2, 4]","If I were ever provoked to write reviews about Jamie Kennedy's widely criticized work in film (e.g.Son of the Mask,Malibu's Most Wanted) I'm really not sure I would've been so hateful and intentionally provocative.  Maybe that is what separates a guy like me, who writes as a hobby and simply because I love movies, from guys who write to make their employers money and get attention.  That however does not excuse the fact that his films are solid examples of how to make a movie that the mainstream will most likely ridicule.Heckler is Kennedy's reaction to his own failures and the backlash that he has suffered for finding a niche in entertainment just large enough to afford him the opportunity to capitalize further on his fame. That isn't to say Kennedy deserves to be attacked as a person.  Heckler covers three groups of hecklers and interviews moderately famous comedians that all react to the dynamic of public criticism.  The first group is the classic comedy heckler, which is the least controversial simply because most of the time the average person will find themselves rooting against the heckler who is ruining a live stand-up routine.  The second group is the film critic, and that segment shows examples of film critics perhaps going a bit too far and taking their reviews into very personally insulting territory.  The third segment covers internet criticism, which in my humble view can be a most vile domain for hatred and dishonesty.  Kennedy goes from scene to scene in a very self-deprecating way and in the end I found myself actually laughing right along.  There is some irony there of course, as I only finally find Kennedy's strengths as he attempts to direct fire at those who criticize almost every other move he has made throughout his career.The moments with celebrity personalities range from genuinely eye-opening and fresh, to incredibly blunt and humorous, and finally to shockingly egotistical and hypocritical; even for Hollywood.  One scene has Kennedy with fellow heckler target and prop-comedian Carrot Top.  Kennedy reads something to Carrot Top about his film,Chairman of the Board.  The blurb is insulting and personal and Kennedy, both frustrated and empathetic, asks Carrot Top how he should respond to someone like that.  Carrot Top simply says that he would ask them to come see his show.  I was actually impressed because I then realized that Carrot Top does his thing and people go and pay to see him, for better or worse.  On the other hand, celebrities like Bill Mahr and Roseanne coming out to attack critics as unqualified or untalented ego-maniacs, and voicing their opposition with rage and personal attacks was so transparently hypocritical that I had to think Kennedy and the others behind the scenes were playing both sides.

They talk about how some critics go beyond just criticizing the movie and sink to personal attacks instead just to be sensational.  And this is a completely valid point.  But then these same people who made that complaint do the exact same things to these critics.  Jamie Kennedy personaly attacks one critic saying that he's a nerd because he enjoys watching star trek and that he must go to comic book conventions all the time.  Others talk about how these critics must be losers who never get laid and live in their parents basement etc.When they try to make more valid arguments against critics they don't do any better.  There is one part where they go off on how focus groups are pointless.  John Luvitz tried to use the analogy to explain what focus groups are like: if someone watched every lakers game for the last 20 years that doesn't qualify them to coach the lakers.  That's true but these focus groups aren't saying they can know direct and star in their own movies.  A focus group is when a studio wants to see how the target market for a certain movie will react so they go get this demographic, show them the movie and ask them what they think.

1155906,AIJ0DEHA822CS,B0017600EW,"Ricky Pooski ""cool""","[4, 6]","The difference between a poetry reading and a comedy show is that a poetry reading is supposed to be a ""safe and supporting"" show where everyone comes out and helps the artist to achieve his potential and people actually pay to see a comedy show. Why do people actually watch comedy shows? Because theoretically, only the bravest and best survive in a continual battle with audience's expectations. Comedians need to make people laugh and sometimes they not only make the audience hate them but they also get hecklers.This movie should have been a great examination of the relationship between comics and the people who hate them. Instead its a whine fest starring Jaime Kennedy as the nastiest human being on the planet. Did you think that he was merely a mediocre comic, the dumbed down equivalent of Seth Green? Guess what. He's a terrible loathsome human being and he is out to punish everyone. The comics who talk about hecklers begin to take a second seat to Jaime Kennedy complaining and turning it around on the hecklers. He invites the hecklers backstage and he yells at them. However, if he wanted sympathy maybe he shouldn't have shown them heckling him when he was telling a lame joke about how country music sucks. There's even a comedian telling a ""she had it coming"" joke about the woman that Robert Blake killed and then just as you think he can't get any less funny, he screams at the audience.Even better, the movie quickly abandons the conceit of talking about actual hecklers and moving on to movie critics. And then just to make matters more pathetic, he has a cartload of talking heads saying that critics don't know anything. Sure, Perez Hilton and TMZ are awful and terrible creeps but every actor and director is out to get most of the critics as know nothing idiots. In fact, the critics are even saying hateful things about each other (Chud.com and Leonard Maltin take turns hating on each other) and the directors can be even more ironic since Joel Schumacher is saying that no one wants to be a critic and that Batman Forever shouldn't be criticized so much because it's a comic book and what do the critics want anyhow? Gone with the Wind? No, the critics want a movie that doesn't plod along like a glacier.Of course, the saddest part about this movie is the fact that Jaime Kennedy brings upSon of the Mask (New Line Platinum Series)over and over again. He even invites over movie critics (online or otherwise) in order to complain about their hostile reviews of his terrible terrible movies. He's nasty and hostile and full of himself. He claims that he's ""talented"" and he quickly goes to the ad hominem jokes like ""You live at Comic-Con"" (because I guess he thinks that the critic is a nerd or something). He keeps asking the question ""why are you being so mean to me?"" as if they didn't force themselves to sit through his awful movies. He should be apologizing to these critics, not trying to get them to apologize to him. He even tries to make a case for critics being terrible human beings because a movie that his friend made starring him was never released and his friend hasn't made a movie since 1998. THen he undercuts his point by showing a scene from that movie and it's even worse than The Son of Mask.If you want to know how pathetic this movie is just note that Dr. Drew is the resident ""mental health expert"" because apparently Jaime Kennedy telling people that he has feelings isn't proof enough that Kennedy is hurting. He needs Dr. Drew to make him sound like less of a creep.THe only good points of the movie are when Jaime interviews critics who hate Son of the Mask and they don't back down. That's pretty awesome. But it's not awesome to give this movie any more than one star since the next scene is a comedian comparing critics who give bad reviews to Lee Harvey Oswald.Only watch this movie if you want to go on a killing spree and target stand up comedians and you need inspiration.",1,Jaime Kennedy's personal whine fest,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,3943,"['difference', 'poetry', 'reading', 'comedy', 'show', 'poetry', 'reading', 'supposed', 'be', 'safe', 'supporting', 'show', 'where', 'everyone', 'out', 'artist', 'achieve', 'potential', 'people', 'actually', 'pay', 'see', 'comedy', 'show', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'actually', 'watch', 'comedy', 'shows', 'theoretically', 'only', 'bravest', 'best', 'survive', 'continual', 'battle', 'audience', 'expectations', 'Comedians', 'need', 'make', 'people', 'sometimes', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'audience', 'hate', 'also', 'get', 'hecklers.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'examination', 'relationship', 'comics', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'Instead', 'whine', 'fest', 'starring', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'nastiest', 'human', 'being', 'planet', 'Did', 'think', 'was', 'merely', 'mediocre', 'comic', 'dumbed', 'down', 'equivalent', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Guess', 'what', 'terrible', 'loathsome', 'human', 'being', 'out', 'punish', 'everyone', 'comics', 'who', 'talk', 'hecklers', 'begin', 'take', 'second', 'seat', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'complaining', 'turning', 'hecklers', 'hecklers', 'backstage', 'However', 'wanted', 'sympathy', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'shown', 'heckling', 'when', 'was', 'telling', 'lame', 'joke', 'how', 'country', 'music', 'sucks', 'even', 'comedian', 'telling', 'had', 'coming', 'joke', 'woman', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'killed', 'then', 'just', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'less', 'funny', 'audience.Even', 'better', 'movie', 'quickly', 'conceit', 'talking', 'actual', 'hecklers', 'moving', 'movie', 'critics', 'then', 'just', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'pathetic', 'cartload', 'talking', 'heads', 'saying', 'critics', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Sure', 'Perez', 'Hilton', 'TMZ', 'are', 'awful', 'terrible', 'creeps', 'actor', 'director', 'out', 'get', 'most', 'critics', 'know', 'nothing', 'idiots', 'fact', 'critics', 'are', 'even', 'saying', 'hateful', 'things', 'other', 'Chud.com', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'take', 'turns', 'hating', 'other', 'directors', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'ironic', 'Joel', 'Schumacher', 'saying', 'one', 'be', 'critic', 'Batman', 'Forever', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'criticized', 'so', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'do', 'critics', 'want', 'anyhow', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'No', 'critics', 'want', 'movie', ""n't"", 'plod', 'glacier.Of', 'course', 'saddest', 'part', 'movie', 'fact', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'upSon', 'Mask', 'New', 'Line', 'Platinum', 'Series', 'over', 'again', 'even', 'movie', 'critics', 'online', 'otherwise', 'order', 'complain', 'hostile', 'reviews', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'movies', 'nasty', 'hostile', 'full', 'talented', 'quickly', 'ad', 'hominem', 'jokes', 'live', 'Comic-Con', 'guess', 'critic', 'nerd', 'something', 'asking', 'question', 'why', 'are', 'being', 'so', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'force', 'sit', 'awful', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'apologizing', 'critics', 'not', 'trying', 'get', 'apologize', 'even', 'make', 'case', 'critics', 'being', 'terrible', 'human', 'beings', 'movie', 'friend', 'made', 'starring', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'friend', ""n't"", 'made', 'movie', '1998', 'point', 'showing', 'scene', 'movie', 'even', 'worse', 'Son', 'Mask.If', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'pathetic', 'movie', 'just', 'note', 'Dr.', 'Drew', 'resident', 'mental', 'health', 'expert', 'because', 'apparently', 'Jaime', 'Kennedy', 'telling', 'people', 'feelings', ""n't"", 'proof', 'enough', 'Kennedy', 'hurting', 'Dr.', 'Drew', 'make', 'sound', 'less', 'creep.THe', 'only', 'good', 'points', 'movie', 'are', 'when', 'Jaime', 'critics', 'who', 'hate', 'Son', 'Mask', 'do', ""n't"", 'back', 'down', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'not', 'awesome', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'star', 'next', 'scene', 'comedian', 'comparing', 'critics', 'who', 'give', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Lee', 'Harvey', 'Oswald.Only', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'go', 'killing', 'spree', 'target', 'stand', 'up', 'comedians', 'need', 'inspiration']",Heckler

At 49:02 minutes a woman comic flashed her self (topless) I don't need to see nudity to understand heckling.The language starts off bad and gets much worse. (I'm tried of swearing and vulgarity).There are many short interviews - with many well known celebrities - and it seems Everyone gets dumped on and heckled at some point in their careers.I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon - and now that I have seen this documentary - I'm thinking - well Duh!! - Of course it highlights Jamie Kennedy - He Made this video!! - Do you expect him to make a video and Not highlight himself!This video shows highlights (or should I say lowlights?)Early in the film - it shows Jamie being pelted by like water balloons or drinks - and there is NO explanation as to what is going on. I'm still curious.Louie Anderson has a great line in here, and I can only paraphrase it at the moment:""Resentment is the only product - that consumes it's own container."" I love that.Again, the swearing and vulgarity - and brief nudity - are what brouht this film down from a 5 star to a 4 star. And I would give the swearing a Minus 5 star.I do stand-up and over all I highly recommend this DVD to all performers and would be interesting to non-performers as well.

The interviewees include everyone from the Fonz to Princess Leia to Doctor Drew to Andrew Dice Clay to Bill Maher to Andy Kindler to Craig Feguson. And all of the above have interesting opinions on the subject of hecklers.It was a bit of a stretch comparing film criticism to heckling, and the only way Kennedy could make the point work was by ignoring film criticism that celebrates good filmmaking.  There's still plenty of that around, and presumably Kennedy is well aware of this, as he's been associated with a number of films that have gotten good reviews.  Also, his point about critics giving snider reviews than necessary is a valid one, but it's nothing new.

I like comedy, and I appreciate the challenges of maintaining control of a room, and the genius required to spontaneously control a room.

You're a performer who people pay to see make fun of others...  You can't be so thick skinned when it turns on you.The video briefly starts with hecklers, and then moves on to critics who didn't like his B movies.  (How can you be offended when people like the Mask better than a cut-rate sequel?)  It starts with a bunch of folks calling critics people who have never done anything relevant in their lives.  Then it moves on to accuse critics of trying to be performance artists on their own.  Umm...  For the same reason that comedians have to shock as entertainers, critics have to also...One appeal of the movie was that it was short.  Even then I couldn't finish it.
