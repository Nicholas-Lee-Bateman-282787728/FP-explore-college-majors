A Matador's Mistress is a dramatic film about the life of torrero known as Manolete.  He fell in love with a prostitute despite the advice of the people who care for him.  It was a volatile relationship where he was being pulled back and forth.  Adrien Brody played the role of Manolete really well, sober, dignified, gallant.  Penelope Cruz was impressive as Lupe, a seemingly disturbed woman who doesn't think she deserves his love.  With the demands of his profession, the constant hostility between Lupe and his handlers, his leeching family, and the rise of other torreros, Manolete becomes emotionally distraught and puts himself in unnecessary danger.  He dies trying to show he is better than the young upstart Luis.  While he is dying, he kept calling for Lupe, who he named Mamita but people thought he was calling for his mother and she was never allowed to go near him.

1381881,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0041KW6RA,Grady Harp,"[29, 30]","Probably of all the matadors of history Manuel Laureano Rodr&iacute;guez S&aacute;nchez (4 July 1917 - 28 August 1947) known as ""Manolete"" is the most famous. 'He rose to prominence shortly after the Spanish Civil War and is considered by some to be the greatest bullfighter of all time. His style was sober and serious, with few concessions to the gallery, and he excelled at the 'suerte de matar'--the kill. Manolete's contribution to bullfighting included being able to stand very still while passing the bull close to his body and, rather than giving the passes separately, he was able to remain in one spot and link four or five consecutive passes together into compact series. He popularized a pass with the muleta called the ""Manoletina,"" which is normally given just before entering to kill with the sword. In addition to all of the major bullrings of Spain, he had very important triumphs in Plaza Mexico. He died following a goring in the right upper leg as he killed the fifth bull of the day, the Miura bull Islero, an event that left Spain in a state of shock. Manolete received his fatal goring in the town of Linares where he appeared alongside the up-and-coming matador Luis Miguel Domingu&iacute;n, who, after Manolete's death, proclaimed himself to be number one. In response to Manolete's death, General Francisco Franco, then dictator of Spain, ordered three days of ""national mourning"", during which only funeral dirges were heard on the radio.'Writer/Director Menno Meyjes ('Max', 'Foreign Student', 'Empire of the Sun', 'The Color Purple', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', etc) seems to have taken that fact that all the world knows of Manolete and instead of creating a biographical account of the man's life he instead opted to provide a sensitive meditation about love and obsession and death.  For many this film will not work as it is not a recreation of facts, either about Manolete or his lover Lupe Sino or the historical atmosphere of Spain at the time of the story, but for those who appreciate the music and the scents and the passion of Spain, this film will satisfy.The film begins with the decision of Manolete (Adrien Brody, who looks very much like the character Manolete!) leaving his peasant life to go to learn bullfighting under the tutelage of Pepe Camar&aacute; (Juan Echanove).  Despite the fears of those who consider the young man not fit to enter the realm of Toreros, Pepe convinces Manolete to persevere - and to become a Torero he must avoid drugs, alcohol and women.  But as Manolete enters the bullrings of Cordova and Madrid and Mexico he gains the status of a star and becomes infatuated with the beautiful Lupe Sino (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz).  Despite Pepe's warnings the two become lovers, have moments of profound passion as well as moments of infidelity on the part of Lupe.  Manolete is conflicted between the love of his mother and the love of Lupe and Lupe is afraid Manolete flirts with death each time he enters the ring. Finally in Linares in 1947 he competes with Luis Miguel Domingu&iacute;n (Nacho Aldegue), is gored and dies from his wounds.  The film ends with the famous march of the pallbearers bearing Manolete beneath a rain of red rose petals as the world mourns the death of a hero - and Lupe disappears into nothingness. No spoilers here because this all is a documented history that everyone knows.The performance by Adrien Brody is subtle and underplayed adding to the dignity of a memory.  Cruz is an exotic if overplayed Lupe.  The cinematography by Robert D. Yeoman is breathtakingly beautiful and the mournful music by Gabriel Yared and Dan Jones is pitch perfect for the effect director Meyjes has created.  As the credits roll at the end there is a hauntingly beautiful Canto Jundo sung by an unnamed female singer. It is a perfect ending to this meditative remembrance of a hero.

This is as good asEvitaand confirms in my own mind Penelope Cruz, who awed inSpanglish, as the Greta Garbo of our time.  It took me some time to realize it was her, as her role, both through facial and body language as well as costume and design, was completely opposite that of the role she played in Spanglish.  The male star, Adrien Brody, was himself phenomenal, and one has to give enormous credit to every side of this production from script and casting to settings, supporting actors at all levels, and the over-all framing of the story.  This could easily become a cult classic to be enjoyed over and over again.  I personally found it head and shoulders above just about every film I have watched these past five or six years.  Penelope Cruz's face is a work of art in constant motion, and I was absolutely fascinated by the choreography of her eyes and mouth and the entire setting both up close and personal and in the larger cultural landscape that the producer and director captured to perfection.I certainly hope this becomes available in USA standard (still incredible that there is not one global standard for DVDs, digits are digits) because when it does I will buy and keep this particular DVD for recurring viewing.Writing this review has exposed me to the enormous body of work of Penelope Cruz, and caused me to explore the work of Adrian Brody.  Below are a few DVDs that I have selected from a very large--a surprisingly large--selection, all of which, in combination with the two performances by Penelope Cruz I have actually seen, cause me to feel she is truly one of the most diverse, nuanced, beautiful, and downright plain TALENTED actresses of our time.VolverOpen Your EyesElegyand many othersThe PianistLove the Hard Wayand many othersCORRECTION with thanks to alert reader who pointed out that Paz Vega is not Penelope Cruz.CarmenSpanglish",5,Six Star Instant Classic--Now Available in US DVD,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2012,"['UPDATE', '19', 'July', '2011', 'point', 'US', 'DVD', 'version', 'A', 'Matador', 'Mistress.If', 'are', 'Latino', 'have', 'grasp', 'Latino', 'culture', '6', 'as', 'good', 'asEvitaand', 'confirms', 'own', 'mind', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'awed', 'inSpanglish', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'time', 'took', 'time', 'realize', 'was', 'role', 'facial', 'body', 'language', 'as', 'well', 'costume', 'design', 'was', 'completely', 'opposite', 'role', 'played', 'Spanglish', 'male', 'star', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'one', 'give', 'enormous', 'credit', 'side', 'production', 'script', 'casting', 'settings', 'supporting', 'actors', 'levels', 'over-all', 'framing', 'story', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'over', 'again', 'personally', 'found', 'head', 'shoulders', 'above', 'just', 'film', 'have', 'watched', 'past', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'face', 'work', 'art', 'constant', 'motion', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fascinated', 'choreography', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'entire', 'setting', 'close', 'personal', 'larger', 'cultural', 'landscape', 'producer', 'director', 'captured', 'perfection.I', 'certainly', 'hope', 'available', 'USA', 'standard', 'still', 'incredible', 'not', 'one', 'global', 'standard', 'DVDs', 'digits', 'are', 'digits', 'when', 'will', 'buy', 'keep', 'particular', 'DVD', 'recurring', 'viewing.Writing', 'review', 'exposed', 'enormous', 'body', 'work', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'caused', 'explore', 'work', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Below', 'are', 'few', 'DVDs', 'have', 'selected', 'very', 'large', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'selection', 'combination', 'two', 'performances', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'have', 'actually', 'seen', 'cause', 'feel', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'diverse', 'nuanced', 'beautiful', 'downright', 'plain', 'TALENTED', 'actresses', 'time.VolverOpen', 'Your', 'EyesElegyand', 'many', 'othersThe', 'PianistLove', 'Hard', 'Wayand', 'many', 'othersCORRECTION', 'thanks', 'alert', 'reader', 'who', 'pointed', 'out', 'Paz', 'Vega', 'not', 'Penelope', 'Cruz.CarmenSpanglish']",N/A

A true story about the love between Matador Manolete (Brody) and the woman he falls in love with Lupe Sino (Cruz).  When aging bullfighter Manolete is told that a younger matador is as good or better then he is, he begins to try and cheat death even more.  Will the love of Lupe help him in the ring, or endanger him?  This is another very slow moving movie. The acting is very good and the scenery and bullfights are fun to watch and look at, but it just doesn't really seem to go anywhere sometimes.

There is actual footage of the real Manolete mixed in with the filmed scenes that is a very nice touch and adds to the experience.  Not knowing anything about the real people or story I have no idea how accurate this is, but the love at times is tested to the limits.  Overall I would say this is more of a movie that women will enjoy more then men, but it's not a horrible thing to have to sit through. I have sat through much, much worse.

Penelope Cruz is amazing as always, and Adrian Brody looks so much like the real Manoleto, it's uncanny ... It's their love story, set against the struggles of being a bullfighter ... She wanted him to give it up, but he resisted, and of course, lost his life. I actually had a hard time watching the culminating scene ending in Manoleto's fatal injury ... though I knew how it would turn out. It was cool to see a film based on such an interesting and beloved man/bullfighter. He's certainly captured the hearts of so many, and this film gave us a peek into his love and world.",4,"Cool, interesting film",1334620800,"04 17, 2012",2012,668,"['film', 'cool', 'interesting', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'el', 'stinko', 'someone', 'else', 'wrote', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'amazing', 'always', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'Manoleto', 'uncanny', 'love', 'story', 'set', 'struggles', 'being', 'bullfighter', 'wanted', 'give', 'up', 'resisted', 'course', 'lost', 'life', 'actually', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'watching', 'culminating', 'scene', 'ending', 'Manoleto', 'fatal', 'injury', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'film', 'based', 'such', 'interesting', 'beloved', 'man/bullfighter', 'certainly', 'captured', 'hearts', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'gave', 'peek', 'love', 'world']",N/A
