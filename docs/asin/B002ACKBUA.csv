Note: The individual series set releases have picture discs that are NOT the same as the 16 DVD complete set release.The GI Joe mini-series introduction DVD, for those interested, has a completely different picture on the disc that's not the same as the season 1.1 disc, picturing three fighter jets with the jetstream smoke forming the red white and blue colors behind it; which I was excited to add to my collection, even if it's repeat content.",3,Slightly Different Picture Disc,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,1073,"['DVD', 'first', 'mini', 'series', 'kick-started', 'phenomenon', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'season', '1', 'complete', 'collection', 'probably', 'more', 'worth', 'while', 'money', 'as', 'far', 'introduction', 'DVDs', 'go', 'quite', 'nice', 'newbies', 'who', 'want', 'get', 'feel', 'cartoon', 'research', 'it.It', 'nice', 'see-through', 'jewel', 'case', 'as', 'far', 'completists', 'are', 'concerned', 'picture', 'disc', 'slightly', 'different', 'season', '1', 'first', 'disc', 'picture', 'disc', 'different', 'background', 'color', 'DVD', 'cover', 'possible', 'find', 'DVD', '8.27', 'elsewhere', 'Note', 'individual', 'series', 'set', 'releases', 'have', 'picture', 'discs', 'are', 'NOT', 'same', '16', 'DVD', 'complete', 'set', 'release.The', 'GI', 'Joe', 'mini-series', 'introduction', 'DVD', 'interested', 'completely', 'different', 'picture', 'disc', 'not', 'same', 'season', '1.1', 'disc', 'picturing', 'three', 'fighter', 'jets', 'jetstream', 'smoke', 'forming', 'red', 'white', 'blue', 'colors', 'was', 'excited', 'add', 'collection', 'even', 'repeat', 'content']",Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye

This, plus the addition of two extra episodes, would make for a nice introduction for those just discovering the Transformers animated series. However...I got this DVD from a different store, and even though the cover and disc image say ""More Than Meets the Eye,"" it actually contains the first half of Transformers Season One. It is in fact Disc One from the Season One DVD with new packaging. This means that anyone who buys it might actually be getting EIGHT episodes.That, my Transformers-loving friends, is truly excellent.",5,Indeed More Than Meets the Eye...,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,731,"['According', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'disc', 'included', 'original', 'three-episode', 'arc', 'More', 'Than', 'Eye', 'opened', 'season', 'one', 'first', 'Transformers', 'series', 'addition', 'two', 'extra', 'episodes', 'would', 'make', 'nice', 'introduction', 'just', 'discovering', 'Transformers', 'animated', 'series', 'However', 'got', 'DVD', 'different', 'store', 'even', 'cover', 'disc', 'image', 'say', 'More', 'Than', 'Eye', 'actually', 'first', 'half', 'Transformers', 'Season', 'One', 'fact', 'Disc', 'One', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'new', 'packaging', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'getting', 'EIGHT', 'episodes.That', 'Transformers-loving', 'friends', 'truly', 'excellent']",Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye
