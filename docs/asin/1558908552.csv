Personally, I experienced Swingers on a whim. No background, history, or reviews cluttered my mind as  I sat and watched this movie. If someone were able to experience Swingers  like that now I would be very surprised as it seems that every person has  one line from the movie in their repetiore. Everyone needs to try swingers,  to be enraptured by it. I would only dissuade those who are sensitive to  vulgarity and sexual situations from seeing this film.

They achieve a relationship in this film like nothing else (not even in the later movie &quot;Made&quot; or in their not-entirely-related work in &quot;Rudy&quot;).  In addition, my good friend Alex Desert (from the incredible ska band HEPCAT and the seemingly forgotten Fox TV show &quot;The Heights&quot;), plays a fantastic role as well.Second is the subject matter.  Who hasn't gone through this?  Who hasn't had the rug pulled from under them (relationship wise), to be left to start all over again...initially a shell of your former self, but then growing to love and trust once more.  Much like any Sinatra recording, this movie lets you know, &quot;fella, you ain't in this alone.&quot;  There are so many scenes that speak to this so beautifully, that it almost escapes description.  One would be when Mikey is checking his answering-machine and it starts talking back to him.  Another would be when Mikey finally sees the girl as the &quot;bunny rabbit.&quot;  I could go on and on, but I don't want to give too much away.Yet another basis is direction and cinematography.  There is a ton of film-insider humor here that gets missed if you don't pay attention.

181272,A2PBV1899CX3TE,1558908552,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 6]","Trent Walker (Vince Vaughn), Sue (Patrick Van Horn), Rob (Ron Livingston), Charles (Alex D&eacute;sert), and Mike Peters (Jon Favreau) are all struggling actors. Their social scene and lifestyle is totally retro, based on the days when Frank, Sammy, and Dean ruled Vegas. They have their own style of dress, lingo, and attitude--but all recycled from the days of Frank, Sammy, and Dean-O. Their scene, The Cocktail Nation, flourished for a while in the mid 90's. The script was written by Jon Favreau, who plays Mikey, and it was based on their own struggles in Hollywood. Some of Vince Vaughn's best lines were things he said verbatim in real life that were transcribed by Jon Favreau, who wrote the script. Like, there is a great scene where Trent Walker regales some Vegas waitresses with tales of his auditions. It is a bravura performance, where he describes a casting call where he tried out for the part of the 11-year old big brother in an after school special. Though he had everyone in tears with his dramatic reading, they rejected him because of his age. This was something Vince Vaughn came up with spontaneously, a story of his own trials and tribulations, but Jon Favreau had the good sense to write it all down, and somehow they were able to get the script shot with themselves in it. How money is that?$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent: All I do is stare at their mouths and wrinkle my nose, and I turn out to be a sweetheart.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent Walker is a very smooth talker, and he plays the part of Frankie Baby for their erstwhile Rat Pack to a T. Mikey is broken hearted about the girl he left back in New York. They went out for 6 years, but when Mikey went to California, they broke up. Six months ago, and he is still waiting for her to call. If Trent/Vince is Frankie Baby, then Mike/Jon is definitely Dean-O. Because, did you know that in spite of his image of constant inebriation, Dean Martin was a real square who never wanted to paint the town after their shows. While Frank wanted to party all night, Dean just wanted to go back to his hotel room and sleep. One time Dean Martin was eating a bowl of spaghetti in his room and Frank Sinatra tried to get him to go out. He wouldn't budge, they got into a fight, and Dean-O wound up wearing the bowl as a fedora, with all the sauce and pasta dripping down. In [Swingers] Trent is also always trying to drag a reluctant Mike out to parties, out to Las Vegas. Anything to get his mind off the girl he left behind. In his own way, Trent cares about his pal, Mike.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent: Um... a malt Glen Garry for me and my friend here. And if you tell that bartender to go extra easy on the water, this 50 cent piece has your name on it.[Waitress smiles and goes off to get their drinks]Trent: Baby, that was money! Tell me that wasn't money.Mike: That was so demeaning.Trent: She smiled, baby.Mike: I can't believe what an $$$$$$$ you are.Trent: Did she, or did she not smile.Mike: She was smiling at what an $$$$$$$ you are.Trent: She was smiling at how money I am, baby.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Mike's problem is he won't stop talking about his ex girlfriend. Whenever Trent sets him up with a beautiful baby who should be ready to party, Mike squelches the dealy-O by talking about his ex girlfriend. Though the girls are vastly sympathetic, and like him--actually more like pity to be honest--he doesn't stir their libidos. In fact, just the opposite. But Trent and the boys don't give up on him. They keep offering what they think is helpful advice:$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Mike: So how long do I wait to call?Trent: A day.Mike: Tomorrow.Sue: Tomorrow, then a day.Trent: Yeah.Mike: So two days?Trent: Yeah, I guess you could call it that, two days.Sue: Definitely, two days is like industry standard.Trent: You know I used to wait two days to call anybody, but now it's like everyone in town waits two days. So I think three days is kind of money. What do you think?Sue: Yeah, but two's enough not to look anxious.Trent: Yeah, two's enough not to look anxious. But I think three days is kind of money. You know because you...Mike: Yeah, but you know what; maybe I'll wait 3 weeks. How's that? And tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and I just happened to run into her number.Charles: Then ask her where you met her.Mike: Yeah, I'll ask her where I met her. I don't remember. What does she look like? And then I'll ask if we $$$$$$. Is that... would that be... T, would that be the money?Trent: You know what. Ha ha ha Mike, laugh all you want but if you call too soon you might scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.Mike: Well how long are you guys gonna wait to call your babies?Trent, Sue: Six days.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$It was at this point that my brother called me. Can you spell synchronicity? Of the many brothers and sisters of my huge family, he is the only one that I can really open up to. I told him that I had a crush on a girl who was on MySpace, who was semi-famous, and she had written me a personal response to my email. He warned me not to act like the guy in [Swingers]. It was uncanny, because I was watching a video of [Swingers] right then, and had paused it to talk to him, at that precise spot. My little brother Kevin is so money. He was telling me to hold back a little, not answer right away. Don't frighten the quarry. He referred to [Swingers] like it was the Code of Conduct for guys. And this is how much this little independent film has entered the fabric and zeitgeist of our culture. Then he offered this final bit of caution, warning me of what was to come for the hapless Mikey who didn't heed the advice of the Rat Pack. Careful, 'cause you know what happens next? I won't spoil it for you by telling what happens next, but suffice it to say that Mikey should have heeded the advice of Trent and Sue.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent: You're so money and you don't even know it!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Anywhat, though in this story, it's boy loses girl, it's never boy gets girl back. It switches to a different narrative in midstream. If this is a Rite of Passage story, then the young acolyte never really learns his lesson--or perhaps the lesson is that sensei is not as wise as he thinks he is. Instead of learning the lesson proposed by the sagely master, he learns a different lesson. He even regains his sense of humor. Well, perhaps humor is not his bag, he shouldn't quit his day job for a career in stand-up, but at least he can laugh a wistful chuckle at himself,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Mike: Hi.Lorraine: Hi.Mike: I'm Mike.Lorraine: Hi Mike, I'm Lorraine.Mike: Like the quiche.Lorraine: Like the quiche? That's a really original joke.Mike: I like quiche.Lorraine: I thought real men didn't like quiche?Mike: Well, it seems my reputation had preceded me here.Lorraine: You not a real man?Mike: Not lately.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If this is the story of struggling young actors in Hollywood, they never get their big break. The movie doesn't end with them making it big in Hollywood, living in big mansions and sipping champagne. Unless you count [Swingers] itself, the movie you are watching, and the movie they ARE in. If you look at it that way, and their career trajectories after [Swingers] came out, perhaps, like a Thai massage, the movie really does have a happy ending...ESSENTIAL RAT PACKIAN CINEMA:Trent, Mikey, Sue, Rob, and Charles represent the five members of the original Rat Pack: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop, and 'Sammy Davis Jr' .The Rat Pack Ultimate Collectors Edition (Oceans 11 / Robin and the 7 Hoods / 4 for Texas / Sergeants 3): (1960) Frank Sinatra made this film as an excuse to get his ""Rat Pack"" friends to Las Vegas to party and hang out with him. The Rat Pack is Frank, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford. George Clooney copied the whole concept and remade the film, and had so much fun that they made two sequels--so far.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent: Vegas, baby. Vegas.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Sergeants Three: (1962) This is definitely a Rat Pack movie, with all of the charter members present. Unfortunately, it might be unavailable on DVD or Video even.4 for Texas: (1963) This is kind of a Rat Pack movie, but with just Frank and Dean and it isn't really up to the high standards of the rest. Notice that all Rat Pack movies have numbers in their titles.Robin and the Seven Hoods: (1964) This movie features Frank, Sammy and Dean, but no Bishop, and Peter Lawford was banished by this time because of his relation to Kennedy. Frank helped elect JFK but then was snubbed afterwards due to his rumored Mafia connections. Therefore, Peter Lawford was out. Bing Crosby replaced Lawford.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$[on the way to Las Vegas]Trent: They're gonna give daddy the Rainman suite, you dig that?Mike: Do you think we'll get there by midnight?Trent: Baby, we're going to be up five hundy by midnight!Mike: Yeeeeaaaaahhhhhh!Trent: Vegas baby! Vegas!Mike: Vegas!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$TWO MAIN FOCAL POINTS OF [SWINGERS], OF WHICH IT IS SOMEWHAT DERIVATIVE:GoodFellas: (1990) Martin Scorsese directed this classic gangster film. [Swingers] pays it homage, by copying a scene where a Steadicam pans continuously while they enter a restaurant. They discuss the shot at length during a poker game, and later, they mimic it when they are forced to sneak into a nightclub through the kitchen, calling all the cooks, waiters, waitresses, and janitors by name. The scene is so money. The sequence where Trent, Mike, and Sue enter the club through a side entrance closely resembles the way Henry and Karen enters a club in Goodfellas (1990), which the group refers to earlier in the film, calling it one of the best shots ever. The now-legendary Steadicam trip through the nightclub kitchen was serendipity - Scorsese had been denied permission to go in the front way and had to improvise an alternative.Reservoir Dogs: (1992) Quentin Tarantino is totally derivative of Scorsese but then again, Swingers is derivative of both Tarantino and Scorsese, not to mention the whole Cocktail Nation lifestyle is derivative of Ocean's Eleven and Robin and the Seven Hoods. A [Reservoir Dogs] poster can also be seen in one of the scenes. The shot of the 'dogs' all waking purposefully is mimicked in another [Swingers] scene. There is a reference to Reservoir Dogs (1992) while the actors are playing poker. They refer to the scene in the beginning when they walk in slow motion as ""a great scene"". As the characters in Swingers leave the poker game to go to a party, they are shown walking in slow motion in a similar fashion to the scene in Reservoir Dogs.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$Trent: Everybody steals from everybody, that's Hollywood.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$CAREER TRAJECTORY PRE-[SWINGERS]:Seinfeld: (1994) Jon Favreau played Erik the Clown, who is working at a kiddy birthday party where George panics about a fire, pushing kids out of his way to escape.The Larry Sanders Show: (1995) Favreau has a part on this Gary Shandling vehicle.THE MAIN EVENT:Swingers: (1996) Note that while the [Swingers] cast are not exactly neophytes--TV shows here and there, the occasional after school special for Vaughn--their careers really careened Post-[Swingers]. Favreau as director is the biggest surprise since Opey and Meathead (Ron Howard and Rob Reiner. respectively). When Trent Walker lies to the waitresses they've picked up in Vegas, telling them that he is a producer, who would dream that even that would come to pass?POST [SWINGERS] CAREER TRAJECTORY:Friends: (1997) Favreau played Pete Becker, a software millionaire who dates Rachael Green (Jennifer Aniston) and then later wants to become an Ultimate Fighter.

Besides listening to Mike Peters moan about his break up, Rob's running gag is that he's up for the ""part"" of Goofy at Disneyland, but he doesn't get it.

""Daniel""","[3, 13]","The plot of director Doug Liman's SWINGERS is one of the thinnest I've seen in months : Jon &quot;Mike&quot; Favreau cannot forget his girlfriend of six years so his pals, lead by Vince &quot;Trent&quot; Vaughn, take him  for a wild ride inside L.A. bars in order to make him enjoy life again. And  that's all.So SWINGERS is more a collection of atmospheres than a study  about the life of out-of-work actors in Hollywood. One understands soon  that Hollywood is the Kingdom of Dreams, the dream being an attitude, a lie  or appearances. Mike is going to feel better only once he leaves his mask  to be himself. Well, it's not the most original idea of the century but, at  least, it's an idea.The big reproach deserved by SWINGERS is that all  the characters depicted are empty, shallow and superficial. There isn't any  life at all in a Trent or a Sue. They are walking into life with a girl in  one arm and a cocktail in the other. And worst of all : nor the  screenwriter, nor the director express a single opinion about this  situation ; it is always more difficult to judge oneself or one's own  actions.*A touristic DVD.* the movie relates the screenwriter's own  experiences.",3,CALIFORNIAN  GRAFFITI,957052800,"04 30, 2000",2000,1183,"['plot', 'director', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'SWINGERS', 'one', 'thinnest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'months', 'Jon', 'quot', 'Mike', 'quot', 'Favreau', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'girlfriend', 'six', 'years', 'so', 'pals', 'lead', 'Vince', 'quot', 'Trent', 'quot', 'Vaughn', 'take', 'wild', 'ride', 'L.A.', 'bars', 'order', 'make', 'enjoy', 'life', 'again', 'all.So', 'SWINGERS', 'more', 'collection', 'atmospheres', 'study', 'life', 'out-of-work', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'One', 'soon', 'Hollywood', 'Kingdom', 'Dreams', 'dream', 'being', 'attitude', 'lie', 'appearances', 'Mike', 'going', 'feel', 'better', 'only', 'once', 'mask', 'be', 'Well', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'idea', 'century', 'least', 'idea.The', 'big', 'reproach', 'deserved', 'SWINGERS', 'characters', 'depicted', 'are', 'empty', 'shallow', 'superficial', ""n't"", 'life', 'Trent', 'Sue', 'are', 'walking', 'life', 'girl', 'one', 'arm', 'cocktail', 'other', 'worst', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'express', 'single', 'opinion', 'situation', 'always', 'more', 'difficult', 'judge', 'one', 'own', 'actions', 'touristic', 'DVD', '*', 'movie', 'screenwriter', 'own', 'experiences']",N/A

181276,A35UNON2GI8C0R,1558908552,David Kusumoto,"[12, 15]","Being above the targeted age demographic for this gloriously original and exhilarating comedy, I was expecting another inane &quot;twenty something&quot; slag of dung, filled with crude language, falsely profound  statements and promiscuity galore.It's great to be dead wrong.I now  think &quot;Swingers&quot; is one of the great comedy sleepers of the  1990s.From its opening musical bars of a 1950s Rat Pack tune to its  frequent homages to great films made during the past 15 years --  &quot;everything is retro&quot; hipness in &quot;Swingers&quot; -- truly,  in my opinion, a near comedic masterpiece, filled with brio, gusto and  non-stop intelligence.This is the story of a young man's woe of a  break-up that comes too soon and his delusional efforts to escape his past  by &quot;going west, young man&quot; -- as if a change in scenery -- will  be just the thing to mend a broken heart.But while Vince Vaughn steals  the show, it is Jon Favreau's acting in the lead role and his screenplay  that makes &quot;Swingers&quot; perhaps the most mis-titled great film of  1996.What we learn in &quot;Swingers&quot; is what we already know,  but brilliantly realized on film in the form of a laugh-a-minute and  ultimately touching comedy that illustrates most vividly that even moving  yourself thousands of miles away doesn't make things easier when you've  been dumped by the love of your life.  You are incapable of breaking out of  a funk to find a replacement girl -- that you believe -- simply doesn't  exist.After the sixth or seventh viewing, this old codger in his 40s is  convinced that &quot;Swingers&quot; is a film that should be seen by people  of all ages, filled with bittersweet observations, hilarious confrontations  and an eternally joyous feeling of vicariously watching others go through  that critical period when finding the &quot;right person&quot; seems as  elusive as finding the missing sock in a clothes dryer.  From beginning to  end, &quot;Swingers&quot; is filled with smart dialogue and an undercurrent  of nostalgia that rings true and familiar for every viewer regardless of  whether you're a baby boomer, a Generation X'er, Y'er, whatever.  Its  themes of searching for &quot;the right one&quot; and their associated pain  and embarrassment have been done before, but never with such cutting humor  and a sense of urgency that asks aloud whether the storybook way our  parents found love can be brought to today's sensibilities.  And the  big-band music and classic crooner soundtrack is a constant reminder of our  parent's past.  These elements, bringing the past to the present and vice  versa, makes &quot;Swingers&quot; accessible to every generation and still  wildly entertaining after multiple viewings.&quot;Swingers&quot; is a  five-star mix of gin and tonic for the soul, boasting a drop-dead funny,  hilariously timed ending that leaves you smiling from ear to ear, and a  resolution that, while satisfying, doesn't come cheap.  Without giving it  away, when Favreau's character utters the line, &quot;it just didn't occur  to me,&quot; one is dumbstruck by the ringing bell of common sense that  dictates that despite all adversity, life does go on, and all that was  wrong with the world can suddenly be made right when it's your turn in the  spotlight.Not everyone can reach the goals Favreau's character reaches  by the end of &quot;Swingers,&quot; but the intelligence and thought  processes Favreau's script brings to the screen makes everything not only  plausible, but familiar to anyone who's gone through the up and down  machinations of true romance.And what about Vince Vaughn?  He's more  than just a pretty boy, more than just comic relief in this, his breakout  role.  He's the childish but fun-loving guy who carries the &quot;I could  die tomorrow so let's have fun today&quot; torch, and he carries it with  hilarity while still displaying genuine affection for the trials and  tribulations of his aggrieved best friend, played by Favreau.  This is the  heart of &quot;Swingers&quot; success.  Great script, great acting, great  production values.  I urge everyone who has yet to see this film, to do so  immediately.  The &quot;R&quot; rating is for language, nothing else.  This  one's a winner, a treasure, one of the best films of 1996 or for any year,  for that matter.",5,"Don't be put off by the title, this one's a keeper!",962841600,"07 6, 2000",2000,4343,"['Being', 'targeted', 'age', 'demographic', 'gloriously', 'original', 'exhilarating', 'comedy', 'was', 'expecting', 'inane', 'quot', 'something', 'quot', 'slag', 'dung', 'filled', 'crude', 'language', 'falsely', 'profound', 'statements', 'promiscuity', 'galore.It', 'great', 'be', 'dead', 'wrong.I', 'now', 'think', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'one', 'great', 'comedy', 'sleepers', '1990s.From', 'opening', 'musical', 'bars', '1950s', 'Rat', 'Pack', 'tune', 'frequent', 'homages', 'great', 'films', 'made', 'past', '15', 'years', 'quot', 'everything', 'retro', 'quot', 'hipness', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'truly', 'opinion', 'near', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'filled', 'brio', 'gusto', 'non-stop', 'intelligence.This', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'woe', 'break-up', 'too', 'soon', 'delusional', 'efforts', 'escape', 'past', 'quot', 'going', 'west', 'young', 'man', 'quot', 'change', 'scenery', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'mend', 'broken', 'heart.But', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'show', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'acting', 'lead', 'role', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'most', 'mis-titled', 'great', 'film', '1996.What', 'learn', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'what', 'already', 'know', 'brilliantly', 'realized', 'film', 'form', 'laugh-a-minute', 'ultimately', 'touching', 'comedy', 'most', 'vividly', 'even', 'moving', 'thousands', 'miles', 'away', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'when', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dumped', 'love', 'life', 'are', 'incapable', 'breaking', 'funk', 'find', 'replacement', 'girl', 'believe', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist.After', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'viewing', 'old', 'codger', '40s', 'convinced', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'people', 'ages', 'filled', 'bittersweet', 'observations', 'hilarious', 'confrontations', 'eternally', 'joyous', 'feeling', 'vicariously', 'watching', 'others', 'go', 'critical', 'period', 'when', 'finding', 'quot', 'right', 'person', 'quot', 'as', 'elusive', 'finding', 'missing', 'sock', 'clothes', 'dryer', 'beginning', 'end', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'filled', 'smart', 'dialogue', 'undercurrent', 'nostalgia', 'true', 'familiar', 'viewer', 'regardless', ""'re"", 'baby', 'boomer', 'Generation', ""X'er"", ""Y'er"", 'themes', 'searching', 'quot', 'right', 'one', 'quot', 'associated', 'pain', 'embarrassment', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'never', 'such', 'cutting', 'humor', 'sense', 'urgency', 'aloud', 'storybook', 'way', 'parents', 'found', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'today', 'sensibilities', 'big-band', 'music', 'classic', 'crooner', 'soundtrack', 'constant', 'reminder', 'parent', 'past', 'elements', 'bringing', 'past', 'present', 'vice', 'versa', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'accessible', 'generation', 'still', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'multiple', 'viewings.', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'five-star', 'mix', 'gin', 'tonic', 'soul', 'boasting', 'drop-dead', 'funny', 'hilariously', 'timed', 'ending', 'smiling', 'ear', 'ear', 'resolution', 'satisfying', ""n't"", 'come', 'cheap', 'giving', 'away', 'when', 'Favreau', 'character', 'line', 'quot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'quot', 'one', 'dumbstruck', 'ringing', 'bell', 'common', 'sense', 'adversity', 'life', 'go', 'was', 'wrong', 'world', 'can', 'suddenly', 'be', 'made', 'right', 'when', 'turn', 'spotlight.Not', 'everyone', 'can', 'reach', 'goals', 'Favreau', 'character', 'reaches', 'end', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'intelligence', 'thought', 'Favreau', 'script', 'screen', 'everything', 'not', 'only', 'plausible', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'who', 'gone', 'up', 'machinations', 'true', 'romance.And', 'what', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'boy', 'more', 'just', 'comic', 'relief', 'breakout', 'role', 'childish', 'fun-loving', 'guy', 'who', 'quot', 'could', 'die', 'tomorrow', 'let', 'have', 'fun', 'today', 'quot', 'torch', 'hilarity', 'still', 'displaying', 'genuine', 'affection', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'aggrieved', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Favreau', 'heart', 'quot', 'Swingers', 'quot', 'success', 'Great', 'script', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'urge', 'everyone', 'who', 'yet', 'see', 'film', 'do', 'so', 'immediately', 'quot', 'R', 'quot', 'rating', 'language', 'nothing', 'else', 'one', 'winner', 'treasure', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1996', 'year', 'matter']",N/A

It holds a special place in the hearts of many young men. The guys in this movie are pretty much what we are all like.Mike is a young, struggling actor trying to make his way in LA. He's also still trying to get over the girl that dumped him six months ago. He has a group of friends with pretty much identical issues. They go to bars. They go to nightclubs. They go to parties. They go to Vegas. They try to pick up girls, with varied degrees of success. They lie about how successful they are, both to their parents and to the girls. They can tell each other the truth, though. At the end of the film Mike is marginally better off than when he started.The substance of 'Swingers' is not the action but the talking and the situations. Moments of humiliation and triumph, cheesy catchphrases and bad advice, fights over nothing - this is how guys talk to each other and how they show they care. There are a number of gifted actors on display here - not so much Jon Favreau as Mike, but Vince Vaughan is outstanding as his manic best friend Trent. The guys are part of the 'swing revival' scene of the early nineties, a movement which I remember with great fondness (if I could have had hair like Trent's, I would have), and the movie captures the cheeky nostalgia and desire for elegance that it represented.As is obligatory in discussing 'Swingers' I must say that this film is so money, and it doesn't even know it.",5,"This movie is like a bear, man!

Its about a guy (Favereau) who just broke up/dumped (same thing) with his long time girlfriend and yearns to get back together with her (you know, you been there, he's checking his phone messages, praying that she leaves a message). This was filmed before cell phones were ubiquitous. His best friend (Vaughn) encourages him to go out on the ""game"", partly to help Favereau forget about his girlfriend but also partly for his own selfish reasons, as he wants a ""wingman"" to help him score.They decide to go Vegas to gamble and to pick up women but all Favereau can think about is his ex girlfriend. He has a chance to get laid with some cocktail waitress but ends up talking to her about his ex-girlfriend. Its so bad that he even uses the phone in her friends trailer to call her and in the meantime, cockblocks Vaughn. Anyway you get jist, the guy can't let go. He's talking about her non-stop, because he is still in love with her. While playing golf he tells his other friend, Livingston that he hasn't mentioned her once today.Vaughn together with Livingston persists in trying to get Favereau to get over his girlfriend, playing videogames, going to parties and bars. One hilarious moment is when Favereau tries to pick up this girl at a party and the first thing she asks him ""is what car he drives"".Favereau's reluctance to let go ultimately annoys one of Vaughn's friends who speaks the truth and calls him a ""whiny little bitch who hasn't got laid in a year"". Favereau then plucks up the courage to call a girl (on the same night, ignoring the 2 days industry standard) whom he picks up in a bar, only to be cut off by her answering machine many times. He continues to leave messages, telling her about his relationship and even at one point breaking up with the girl he just picked up. The girl ultimately picks and tells him not to ever call again.Favereau then slips into despair and spends 2 days in his apartment reminiscing about his girlfriend.

Remember, this was a low budget flick.Audio is in English 2.0 surround and sounds pretty darned good.  Dialogue is clear and understandable, and lets face it, that's what matters in this kind of film.In terms of supplements you get two commentaries.  The first by director Doug Liman and the film's editor.  It is an interesting and lively track that you should enjoy listening to.  The second commentary is with stars Jon Favreau &amp; Vince Vaughn and is hugely entertaining.  I have to beleive this is the first DVD commentary to utilize Telestrator technology!  This is a good, fun commentary track.  Next up is a well put togethere 45 minute documentary on the making of Swingers featuring a bunch of cast interviews.  The Cutting Room Floor feature includes 5 alternate and extended takes including some great ad-libbing from Vince Vaughn during the video game hockey scene.  Swingers Mania Gallery shows somes stills and promotional items from the film and isn't really very interesting.

And who are the boys and their scene? Well, for starters the boys dress like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin; they soak up martini's in smokey &quot;lounges&quot;; pick-up &quot;honies&quot; and &quot;babies&quot;; and support each other with a demented but ultra-loyal mix of a 4th-grade mentality and grown-up drama.

181299,A3KUUII2GSHN7T,1558908552,"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon""","[5, 5]","Jon Favreau (the writer and director of Swingers, Iron Man, Elf, etc.), is basically me. He's semi-geeky, witty, and likes to place himself in the false reality of thinking he's more of a ladies man than he truly is. It's all over his films, and Swingers is no exception.In Swingers, we have a group of late-twenties friends, led by their alpha-male chieftain Trent (played by Vince Vaughn in perhaps his greatest role to date), who is in the process of trying to get ""Mikey"" (played by Favreau) back in the game relationally after a bad breakup with his girlfriend six months before. Mikey is resistant at first, and drops the ball multiple times in some of the funniest attempted land-a-date sequences I've ever witnessed, but eventually and predictably for the silver-lining Favreau, comes around with in the finale of the film.But my bone to pick lies here, as it did with Favreau's role in 'Love and Sex', is that he has almost delcared himself the ""lovable underdog"" type. We get it, Jon-boy, you're the sweetest little tool in town and the woman, once they get to know you, adore you. I mean, look at women he ends up with in the two romantic comedies he's done...Heather Graham * SwingersFamke Janssen * Love and SexI'll just come right out and say it: his films, while they are hilariously witty, leave me depressed during those aftertaste portions a few hours after the credits roll on. Why you ask? Simple: because guys like me and Favreau DO NOT end up with Heather Grahams or Famke Janssens. We end up with the nut jobs of the world, sociopath women like Juliette Lewis and overbearing motherly-types like Katie Couric. Favreau, I think, should somehow incorporate those two in his next film. Until that day, I'm not buying it, Jon-Jon, I'm not buying your little ""I'm the lovable loser who ends up with the hottie"" routine.That doesn't mean I won't stop watching or laughing.",5,"I'll get you Favreau, if it's the last thing I do!!!!!!!!",1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,1889,"['Jon', 'Favreau', 'writer', 'director', 'Swingers', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Elf', 'etc', 'basically', 'semi-geeky', 'witty', 'likes', 'place', 'false', 'reality', 'thinking', 'more', 'ladies', 'man', 'truly', 'films', 'Swingers', 'exception.In', 'Swingers', 'have', 'group', 'late-twenties', 'friends', 'led', 'alpha-male', 'chieftain', 'Trent', 'played', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'role', 'date', 'who', 'process', 'trying', 'get', 'Mikey', 'played', 'Favreau', 'back', 'game', 'relationally', 'bad', 'breakup', 'girlfriend', 'six', 'months', 'Mikey', 'resistant', 'first', 'ball', 'multiple', 'times', 'funniest', 'attempted', 'land-a-date', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'eventually', 'predictably', 'silver-lining', 'Favreau', 'around', 'finale', 'film.But', 'bone', 'pick', 'lies', 'here', 'did', 'Favreau', 'role', ""'Love"", 'Sex', 'almost', 'delcared', 'lovable', 'underdog', 'type', 'get', 'Jon-boy', ""'re"", 'sweetest', 'little', 'tool', 'town', 'woman', 'once', 'get', 'know', 'adore', 'mean', 'look', 'women', 'up', 'two', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'done', 'Heather', 'Graham', '*', 'SwingersFamke', 'Janssen', '*', 'Love', 'SexI', ""'ll"", 'just', 'come', 'right', 'say', 'films', 'are', 'hilariously', 'witty', 'leave', 'depressed', 'aftertaste', 'portions', 'few', 'hours', 'credits', 'roll', 'Why', 'ask', 'Simple', 'guys', 'Favreau', 'DO', 'NOT', 'end', 'up', 'Heather', 'Grahams', 'Famke', 'Janssens', 'end', 'up', 'nut', 'jobs', 'world', 'sociopath', 'women', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'overbearing', 'motherly-types', 'Katie', 'Couric', 'Favreau', 'think', 'should', 'somehow', 'incorporate', 'two', 'next', 'film', 'day', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'Jon-Jon', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying', 'little', ""'m"", 'lovable', 'loser', 'who', 'up', 'hottie', 'routine.That', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'laughing']",N/A
181300,A36HBE2C5SQ2E6,1558908552,"Jordan Appel ""thedudeman""","[4, 5]","Doug Liman's smash cult hit written by Jon Favreau isabout a  man that leaves his girlfriend and New Yorkbehind for the glitz and glamor of the L.A. scene. Heis shown the ropes by a local that is quite the manwith the ladies and he gets taught the rules of how tobe a Swinger. He finds out that the game isn't as easyas it looks because of his thoughts constantly on hisgirlfriend and her life back in New York, he is afraidto move onto better things because of that lasting relationship.Doug Liman has taken Jon Favreau's hilarious andheartfelt script and made it a solid comedy that keepsyou laughing. Liman's style of direction was perfectlysuited for this film. Although there was somechoppiness in the shots, he really pulled some amazingperformances out of the actors. Especially the starmaking performance of Vince Vaughn as Trent.Sometimes, the camera shaking got on my nerves, othertimes I felt that the camera had captured some greatmemorable shots that could be studied by futurefilmmakers. He isn't as great as some other directorsbut he can really hold his own to the fact that hepays to tribute to some of the directors of all timewith his shots.Jon Favreau has written one of the most funny,original and emotional scripts that I have ever seen.He takes himself and makes the character that he playsto be absolutely pathetic, but eventually redeems thecharacter towards the end with a woman with the sametype of personality. He creates a personal triumph forhis character and makes the film so touching andenjoyable that you basically root for his characterall through out the movie. He had also written somevery memorable scenes like for instance, the ""DoubleDown on 11"" scene, that was so insanely hilarious,that it is brilliant. Also, He has taken otherinfluences (Scorsase, Tarantino) and worked them intothe movie. He makes so many references to pop culture,that you feel that you are living and breathing withthe characters.What can I say about Vince Vaughn's legendary starmaking performance that hasn't been said? He reallytook the character written by Jon Favreau and made ithis own. He coined the phrases ""You're money!"" and""Beautiful babies"". He was hysterically all over theplace, he was making you laugh so hard that youstarted crying at the same time. That is how muchfunny he has in his system. I feel like that he islike Robin Williams without the wildness. Every actorand actress wishes to have a breakout performance in afilm. Vince Vaughn got his early with this. He hasmade a fantastically brilliant portrayal of what JonFavreau was trying to get across in his writing.In closing, I had a experience watching this smart andemotional comedy. I was impressed by the direction andthe writing of Jon Favreau, who also gave a solidperformance. The film was a great cult hit and in myeyes, will be watched by generations to come becausethe filmmakers will see how a comedy should be doneand done well. Hollywood need more of what Doug Liman,Jon Favreau, and Vince Vaughn had back in 1996, whenthey had made this highly original, and fresh facedfilm.

The reality of their emotions and humor and of seeing so deeply into the male psyche made the movie sometimes almost painful to watch in some bittersweet way.The music was great!  The atmosphere was real!  The locations were interesting and the method used to shoot the film really made you feel like you were there on location.  I am having a difficult time expressing exactly the feelings that the film evoked, but they were all enjoyable on varying levels.Vince Vaughn, who looks so young and innocent, displayed all the positive traits he brings to his films today.  It was just a shock to see him look so fresh-faced.  I felt like I was watching a younger 'Jeremy Grey' with the staccato speech patterns, the high energy, and the great charisma.  I assume that is because Vaughn always seems to bring so much of himself to his characters.Being a huge fan of Vegas and a dedicated Blackjack player, I loved their trip to Vegas, baby.  Watching their time at the tables unfold was a humorous surprise that had me laughing out loud.Seeing Alex D&eacute;sert (from Becker) was interesting as I had not seen him in any other role.  All the supporting roles to Jon Favreau were dead-on as characters most women (and guys, of course) really know.  Favreau wrote just an excellent script and these gentlemen presented it like the beautiful babies they are.On the Collector's Series edition the extras were very informative.  The inside information on the writing of the story and creating of the film just lent more intimacy to the realistic flavor of the film.I particularly was amused by the 'Swing Blade' short, being Billy Bob's #1 fan (too bad Karl was played by Chris Cox rather than Billy Bob Thornton himself).  I would recommend if you haven't seen ""Swingers"", to watch this edition so you can get all the background information on this great film that is surely destined to be a cult classic for years and years to come.This is a must see film for guys (who can relate), woman (who can recognize), fans of Vince Vaughn (who must see all his work, old and new), and just anyone who loves a great movie....it is so money!",5,So Real - and So Real..ly MONEY,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2510,"['so', 'loved', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'being', 'guy', 'were', 'important', 'parts', ""'did"", ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'missing', 'anything.The', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'Swingers', 'unique', 'was', 'feeling', 'was', 'actually', 'following', 'bunch', 'young', 'guys', 'secretly', 'listening', 'conversations', 'watching', 'interactions', 'one', 'girls', 'reality', 'emotions', 'humor', 'seeing', 'so', 'deeply', 'male', 'psyche', 'made', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'bittersweet', 'way.The', 'music', 'was', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'real', 'locations', 'were', 'interesting', 'method', 'used', 'shoot', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'were', 'there', 'location', 'am', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'expressing', 'exactly', 'feelings', 'film', 'evoked', 'were', 'enjoyable', 'varying', 'levels.Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'so', 'young', 'innocent', 'displayed', 'positive', 'traits', 'films', 'today', 'was', 'just', 'shock', 'see', 'look', 'so', 'fresh-faced', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'younger', 'Grey', 'staccato', 'speech', 'patterns', 'high', 'energy', 'great', 'charisma', 'assume', 'Vaughn', 'always', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'characters.Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Vegas', 'dedicated', 'Blackjack', 'player', 'loved', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'baby', 'Watching', 'time', 'tables', 'unfold', 'was', 'humorous', 'surprise', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.Seeing', 'Alex', 'D', 'eacute', 'Becker', 'was', 'interesting', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'role', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'were', 'dead-on', 'characters', 'most', 'women', 'guys', 'course', 'really', 'know', 'Favreau', 'wrote', 'just', 'excellent', 'script', 'gentlemen', 'presented', 'beautiful', 'babies', 'are.On', 'Collector', 'Series', 'edition', 'extras', 'were', 'very', 'informative', 'inside', 'information', 'writing', 'story', 'creating', 'film', 'just', 'lent', 'more', 'intimacy', 'realistic', 'flavor', 'film.I', 'particularly', 'was', 'amused', ""'Swing"", 'Blade', 'short', 'being', 'Billy', 'Bob', '1', 'fan', 'too', 'bad', 'Karl', 'was', 'played', 'Chris', 'Cox', 'rather', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'would', 'recommend', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Swingers', 'watch', 'edition', 'can', 'get', 'background', 'information', 'great', 'film', 'surely', 'destined', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'years', 'come.This', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'guys', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'recognize', 'fans', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'must', 'see', 'work', 'old', 'new', 'just', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'movie', '.it', 'so', 'money']",N/A

It's okay, but as my tag line says, it just didn't live up to all the hype. I'd also grown up in L.A. so the setting had some hometown resonance, but even that wasn't enough to enliven it much for me.None of the male characters manages to engage your sympathy, and the dialog, which I guess is supposed to be some sort of 90s era ultra-cool L.A. argot, doesn't sound like anything I've ever heard. And even if it was, it doesn't add much to the movie, which would have been more effective if the dialog was written with more normal-sounding speech. If you want to hear great inner-city dialog, try ""The Sweet Smell of Success,"" written by the great Clifford Odets, which takes place in New York City, and was written way back in the 50s.After a trip to Las Vegas gets the movie going, the story mainly involves a hapless bunch of unsuccessful and out of work twenty-something guys who wander from one L.A. party or pickup joint to the next as they try to get laid, desperately looking for downwardly mobile girls who will basically take pity on them. None do, at least none of the attractive or pretty ones. No surprise there.Too much of the movie is taken up with the main character's pining away for his lost love, which would have been fine for 5 or 10 minutes, but to continually dwell on it for most of the movie again doesn't add much to the story and after a while just becomes tedious and boring. While we have all been through periods like this in our lives, I don't need to see it again in a move that I'm paying my hard earned bucks for.The comradery shown in the movie between the friends is one of the few things that did strike a sympathetic cord, as the friends of the lovelorn Favreau character try to snap him out of his romantic funk with their rapid-fire tour of L.A.'s storied singles scene. Other than that, I didn't find a whole lot that grabbed me in the movie.If you're a Vince Vaughn fan this movie might be worth your while as an example of his earlier work, or if the youth culture and singles scene of 90s-era L.A. interests you.

Swingers has gone on to become an incredibly popular movie.  It made Vince Vaughn's career as an actor and defined Jon Favreau's career both as an actor and as a writer.This is the kind of movie that every man can relate to on at least one level.  Most men can probably relate to both of the main characters: each representing one side of us in our dealings with women.  On the one hand, the sensitive man who isn't afraid to reveal himself - and on the other hand, the player, who doesn't have any pretentions and makes no apologies for his brash behavior. Both are real and both have their pros and cons. They are both well-represented in Swingers.I first saw this movie when I was about 17 years old.  I loved the characters and I loved the flow of the movie, but I find that when I watch it now (in my mid-20s), I appreciate it on a whole different level. For those of us who are shy and reserved, this movie almost makes you want to come out of your shell. It can almost be called ""inspirational"" in how it will goad you to get the hell out there are let it all hang out. Great lines are delivered throughout the script.

Naturally he has some heartbreak and is still very awkward in the social scene of single life. Luckily, his buddy Trent (Vince Vaughn) is there to offer him advice and coach him up on his skills.Mike is so bad and awkward with the ladies that it is painful to watch as a guy. You feel so bad for the guy as he ruins girl after girl and is hung up on his old lady back east. With each passing scene you see how devastated Mike is and you realize that it isn't easy to get over heartbreak.Swingers is an L.A. classic with scenes shot around around the city. There are also some very accurate interpretations of the shallowness of people in L.A., in particular, some of the ladies.

Yes, the movie is of high quality, that is, if you are able to look deep enough into why it was made, and discover the various themes imbedded throughout the story.The main theme is that people have expectations regarding certain events or people in their life.  Typically, the expectation is larger than life and can consume much of our thinking.  This happens quite often when the theme involves love:  who is rational when in love?  Very few.

181315,A27PSZX2SE0B51,1558908552,Mike Stone,"[12, 15]","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this movie really has nothing to do with the early-`90's L.A. lounge revival.  Frankly, it could have been set in Disneyland, while the characters were really dressed up as Goofy, Pluto and Donald Duck.  Sure the hipster dialogue would have to be adjusted some, but it really wouldn't have mattered much to the overall story.Writer/Star Jon Favreau (Mikey) has created an entertaining and -- dare I say it? -- educational look at one man coping with a recent breakup, and how to best get back up on the dating horse.  His script gets most of its recognition for the creation of memorable catchphrases (I still hear people calling each other ""money"" or ""beautiful babies""), and that's all well and good.  But it also contains tremendous insights into how we as men and women meet and get to know each other.  There are some wonderful scenes here of heartache and joy.The cast is, for the most part, amateurish.  Obviously, this is a function of the film's meager budget.  Everyone gives a gung-ho effort, but most fail to hit their marks dead on.  Favreau himself comes off as little more than an actor playing an actor.  Even his walk feels forced at times.  Thankfully, it doesn't hinder his likability, or the rest of the cast's.  The one standout, of course, is Vince Vaughn as ""best friend"" Trent.  Vince has charisma to spare here, taking his role as the smooth-talking Don Juan to the outer limits.  He embodies Trent completely.  It's one of those parts where whenever he's not in the scene, you find yourself wondering: ""I wonder when Trent's coming back!""  I'm sitting here thinking of all his great scenes, and frankly, they're too numerous to mention.Director Liman does a good job with what he's been given.  I suppose he had no choice but to shoot the film as a self-conscious, ""hey we're making a movie over here"" kind of documentary.  At times he resorts to gimmickry to catch the audience's attention (like the cognizant answering machine giving Mikey dating tips, or a blatant slo-mo Tarantino rip-off that follows a scene where the characters talk about Tarantino's tendency to employ blatant Scorsese rip-offs), but for the most part he's quite laid back, letting the camera catch the conversations quite naturally.  The music, however, is in your face, and justly so.  And don't go in thinking that's it's all going to be `50's swing.  There's a particularly effective scene where Trent does some nifty seduction work while Heart's `Magic Man' plays in the background.But by far the most memorable scene in the movie is Heather Graham's.  Her dance number with Favreau is very visceral, and beautiful.  There's a moment in there when the song ends, and she is in the middle of a dip, looking up at Mikey with those big eyes, and she's just divine.  I dare you not to fall in love with her.So if you're skeptical of the whole swingers scene, not into the Frank Sinatra mystique, and have never had a Glenlivet, a Glenfiddich, or a Glengarry, don't worry.  There's still much about ""Swingers"" that you'll find enjoyable.",5,Much more than just &quot;you're money&quot; and &quot;beautiful babies&quot;,976233600,"12 8, 2000",2000,3086,"[""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'out', 'limb', 'here', 'say', 'movie', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'early-', '90', 'L.A.', 'lounge', 'revival', 'Frankly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'Disneyland', 'characters', 'were', 'really', 'dressed', 'up', 'Goofy', 'Pluto', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'Sure', 'hipster', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'adjusted', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'mattered', 'much', 'overall', 'story.Writer/Star', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Mikey', 'created', 'entertaining', 'dare', 'say', 'educational', 'look', 'one', 'man', 'coping', 'recent', 'breakup', 'how', 'best', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'dating', 'horse', 'script', 'most', 'recognition', 'creation', 'memorable', 'catchphrases', 'still', 'hear', 'people', 'calling', 'other', 'money', 'beautiful', 'babies', 'well', 'good', 'also', 'tremendous', 'insights', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'meet', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'are', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'here', 'heartache', 'joy.The', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'amateurish', 'Obviously', 'function', 'film', 'meager', 'budget', 'Everyone', 'gung-ho', 'effort', 'most', 'fail', 'hit', 'marks', 'dead', 'Favreau', 'off', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'actor', 'playing', 'actor', 'Even', 'walk', 'feels', 'forced', 'times', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'likability', 'rest', 'cast', 'one', 'standout', 'course', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'best', 'friend', 'Trent', 'Vince', 'charisma', 'spare', 'here', 'taking', 'role', 'smooth-talking', 'Don', 'Juan', 'outer', 'limits', 'Trent', 'completely', 'one', 'parts', 'where', 'whenever', 'not', 'scene', 'find', 'wondering', 'wonder', 'when', 'Trent', 'coming', 'back', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'here', 'thinking', 'great', 'scenes', 'frankly', ""'re"", 'too', 'numerous', 'mention.Director', 'Liman', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'been', 'given', 'suppose', 'had', 'choice', 'shoot', 'film', 'self-conscious', 'hey', ""'re"", 'making', 'movie', 'here', 'kind', 'documentary', 'times', 'gimmickry', 'catch', 'audience', 'attention', 'cognizant', 'answering', 'machine', 'giving', 'Mikey', 'dating', 'tips', 'blatant', 'slo-mo', 'Tarantino', 'rip-off', 'scene', 'where', 'characters', 'talk', 'Tarantino', 'tendency', 'employ', 'blatant', 'Scorsese', 'rip-offs', 'most', 'part', 'quite', 'laid', 'back', 'letting', 'camera', 'catch', 'conversations', 'quite', 'naturally', 'music', 'however', 'face', 'justly', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', '50', 'swing', 'particularly', 'effective', 'scene', 'where', 'Trent', 'nifty', 'seduction', 'work', 'Heart', 'Magic', 'Man', 'plays', 'background.But', 'far', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'dance', 'number', 'Favreau', 'very', 'visceral', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'when', 'song', 'middle', 'dip', 'looking', 'up', 'Mikey', 'big', 'eyes', 'just', 'divine', 'dare', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'her.So', ""'re"", 'skeptical', 'whole', 'swingers', 'scene', 'not', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'mystique', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'Glenlivet', 'Glenfiddich', 'Glengarry', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'still', 'much', 'Swingers', ""'ll"", 'find', 'enjoyable']",N/A

No matter how hard he tries, he cannot seem to get out of the depressive state that he is in. So his smooth, fast-talking friend Trent (Vince Vaughn)decides he will do whatever it takes to show Mike a good time. Trent's vast array of cheering up techniques is filled with everything from laughing over martinis in a cocktail lounge, to picking up beautiful babies on their way to Las Vegas. Whatever it may be, these young &quot;Swingers&quot; are determined to re-write the rules on dating.&quot;Swingers&quot; is without a doubt one of the funniest films to come out of the 90's, and it truly captures the dating scene of today. Jon Favreau wrote the amazing script. It provides for tons of killer dialogue which includes one of the most memorable lines of all time &quot;You are so money, and you don't even know it.&quot; This film made me laugh harder than I ever have before. The most memorable scene is when Jon Favreau repeatedly calls the answering machine because it keeps hanging up on him. It goes on for about five minutes, until the woman finally picks up, and tells him to never call her again. It had me in tears from laughing so hard. The performances are what make this film succeed. Jon Favreau is amazing as Mike. He will make you feel sorry for him, and make you laugh at the same time with how bad his luck is. Vince Vaughn obviously gives the best performance as Trent. His advice on dating, and his smooth, player-like nature is the reason he became one of my all time favorite characters. Heather Grahm, Ron Livingston, Patrick Van Horn, and Alex Desert are all outstanding as the supporting cast.All I can say is thank you Miramax for releasing the Collector's Series DVD!! The DVD is simply amazing, and lets you see the film in a whole new light. My favorite special feature is the illustrated action commentary with Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn.

The best scene was probably when Mike and this girl he meets at a club start dancing. It must be really sad to realize that a short dance scene could be the best this movie could offer. Why the 3 starts then? because deep inside I realized that some of us could deff relate to some of the characters from the movie. Whether you are ( or were) that little whinny B... who couldn't stop talking to your friends about your ex or whether you were the playa who couldn't keep their hands off the honey or simply the goofy friend who's always trying to have a good time without taking life too serious. I think all of us could see a little of ourselves in one or even all of  these characters. As for myself, I deff felt that I could see my life through the eyes of each one of them. I feel that there have always been times when I have felt like the playa, or the goofy kid and even sadly and unfortunately like Mike ( but I assure you it was never that bad).So why did I take away 2 stars?The movie has a slow pace to it. Most of the movie involves conversation between friends and I wouldn't have mind this if it wasn't for the fact that I found these conversations to be boring.There aren't many scenes that stood out. I think that 3 scenes stand out in my mind right now. A scene where Mike interrupts his best friend while he is preparing to have sex. The dancing scene described above . And lastly, the scene where Mike ruins his chances of being with a girl he just met by calling here as soon as he got home leaving repeatedly voice mails.That's pretty much the highlights of this movie.I would recommend that you watch it but don't buy into the hype of some people calling this movie ""hilarious.""",3,"Do you need a mirror?

If you've never seen this film, which packs a bevy of memorable scenes and spawned several catch phrases (""You're so money!""), it's high time you checked it out.""Swingers"" follows the ups and downs (mostly downs) of Mike (Jon Favreau), a struggling actor who has recently moved to Los Angeles from New York. When he moved, he left behind a girlfriend of six years, and he hasn't been able to get her off his mind, a problem that's exasperated by his lack of success on the L.A. singles scene.Fortunately for Mikey, he's got some buddies who are bent on cheering him up, most notably the smooth-talking Trent (Vince Vaughn), who convinces Mike to make an impromptu trip to Vegas to wash away his problems with gambling, women and booze. It's the first of many unsuccessful (and roaringly funny) forays into the singles scene for Mikey, who is alternately too nice, too nervous, and too neurotic to achieve any level of success with the ladies.This sort of material has been mined with much less success by many movies, but ""Swingers"" has three noteworthy forces working for it: star Favreau's superb script, a great cast and Liman's top-notch direction.The witty screenplay delivers enough laughs and memorable lines to reward repeat viewings, from Trent's boast that he's going to ""Find me two cocktail waitresses and pull me a Fredo"" to a hilarious conversation between Mike, Trent and the rest of the crew about how long you should wait before calling a girl whose ""digits"" you got.Liman, who also directed the excellent ""Go,"" throws in a a number of deft touches that add to the script. Check out the slo-mo walking scene that's an amusing homage to Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs."" Or the unusual imagery complete with ""Jaws"" music to illustrate Trent's growing discomfort with a girl he just met.The ensemble cast is terrific, with special kudos to the two leads, Favreau and Vaughn. Favreau is outstanding as the lovable nice-guy loser Mike, giving a deeply funny and even touching performance. Case in point: Mike's ill-advised attempt to leave a message on the answering machine of a hottie he met just a few hours before. As the womanizing Trent, Vaughn exudes star charisma, delivering his lines with flair without falling into cartoonish excess.Despite its low budget and unknown (at the time) director and cast, ""Swingers"" became a modest indie hit. Now, a decade after its release, great word-of-mouth buzz has transformed it into a deserving cult classic.",5,"Go, Daddy-O!",1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,2589,"['Few', 'films', 'have', 'explored', 'pain', 'being', '20-something', 'single', 'as', 'hilariously', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'classic', 'Swingers', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'bevy', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'spawned', 'several', 'catch', 'phrases', ""'re"", 'so', 'money', 'high', 'time', 'checked', 'out', 'Swingers', 'ups', 'downs', 'mostly', 'Mike', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'struggling', 'actor', 'who', 'recently', 'moved', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'New', 'York', 'When', 'moved', 'left', 'behind', 'girlfriend', 'six', 'years', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'get', 'off', 'mind', 'problem', 'exasperated', 'lack', 'success', 'L.A.', 'singles', 'scene.Fortunately', 'Mikey', 'got', 'buddies', 'who', 'are', 'bent', 'cheering', 'up', 'most', 'notably', 'smooth-talking', 'Trent', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'Mike', 'make', 'impromptu', 'trip', 'Vegas', 'wash', 'away', 'problems', 'gambling', 'women', 'booze', 'first', 'many', 'unsuccessful', 'roaringly', 'funny', 'singles', 'scene', 'Mikey', 'who', 'alternately', 'too', 'nice', 'too', 'nervous', 'too', 'neurotic', 'achieve', 'level', 'success', 'ladies.This', 'sort', 'material', 'been', 'mined', 'much', 'less', 'success', 'many', 'movies', 'Swingers', 'three', 'noteworthy', 'forces', 'working', 'star', 'Favreau', 'superb', 'script', 'great', 'cast', 'Liman', 'top-notch', 'direction.The', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'delivers', 'enough', 'laughs', 'memorable', 'lines', 'reward', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Trent', 'boast', 'going', 'Find', 'two', 'cocktail', 'waitresses', 'pull', 'Fredo', 'hilarious', 'conversation', 'Mike', 'Trent', 'rest', 'crew', 'how', 'long', 'should', 'wait', 'calling', 'girl', 'digits', 'got.Liman', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'excellent', 'Go', 'number', 'deft', 'touches', 'add', 'script', 'Check', 'out', 'slo-mo', 'walking', 'scene', 'amusing', 'homage', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'unusual', 'imagery', 'complete', 'Jaws', 'music', 'illustrate', 'Trent', 'growing', 'discomfort', 'girl', 'just', 'met.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'terrific', 'special', 'kudos', 'two', 'leads', 'Favreau', 'Vaughn', 'Favreau', 'outstanding', 'lovable', 'nice-guy', 'loser', 'Mike', 'giving', 'deeply', 'funny', 'even', 'touching', 'performance', 'Case', 'point', 'Mike', 'ill-advised', 'attempt', 'leave', 'message', 'answering', 'machine', 'hottie', 'met', 'just', 'few', 'hours', 'before', 'womanizing', 'Trent', 'Vaughn', 'star', 'charisma', 'delivering', 'lines', 'flair', 'falling', 'cartoonish', 'excess.Despite', 'low', 'budget', 'unknown', 'time', 'director', 'cast', 'Swingers', 'became', 'modest', 'indie', 'hit', 'Now', 'decade', 'release', 'great', 'word-of-mouth', 'buzz', 'transformed', 'deserving', 'cult', 'classic']",N/A

The script is brimming with sharply observant humor which never feels like it's been pre-meditated, and everything is balanced just right with touches of pathos. I was actually quite surprised with the depth of the film's vignettes regarding how swingers aren't even in tune with the sterility of their lives.

Where most movies that try this end up being drug and sex romps with wild parties and unrealistic plot lines, Swingers hits every subtle nuance of the time.  It is hard for any guy to watch the golf scene and think, ""yeah, that's exactly how I add up my strokes.""  And the movie was the first film I remember that show guys sitting around playing video games that end up in blood both on and off the television.The film is at its best when the guys are sitting around arguing about the most absurd things like how long you should wait to call a girl after getting her number (Industry Standard became an integral part of my vocabulary after the film).  And they even nail the heartbreak of the end a long relationship and the buddies helping him get back on the horse again.  Even the new dictions and the addiction to swing they invent for the film eventually doesn't stand out while watching.  Speaking of swing, I think this may be the last time a movie effectively shift pop music after its release, albeit for a short time.Swinger also launched the careers of Jon Favreau, who also wrote the film, and Ron Livingston (Office Space).  But the film really belonged to Vince Vaughn who, after trying to transition into a serious actor with range (seriously, the Psycho remake?) has finally embraced Trent and now only plays slight variations of him.  C'mon, like you weren't watching Wedding Crashers and thinking that was Trent a decade later.

But whatever tag you wish to stick on it, this honest, low-budget humdinger from Liman is very very ""money""!Top 10 reasons to get your hands on this movie now:(1) It's fast-paced, well edited (not one wasted scene) and frequently laugh-out-loud funny. If you hear people dismiss this as an inconsequential narrative about a ""bunch of losers trying to get laid"", I'm afraid they just have not watched the entire movie. I am not into the ""Spy who shagged me"" genre of humor, but this movie will truly grow on you.(2) It'll ring a bell with almost anyone, particularly guys. Mike -- a crestfallen loverboy (Jon Favreau) is in the throes of a breakup, and his confidence has hit rock bottom. (Sidenote: Favreau is a very ordinary looking guy, which in fact imho is the power of his character.) Under the aegis of his friend Trent (Vince Vaughn, in top form, a lot better than his controlled acting in, gulp, The Psycho) Mike re-learns how to get back up on his feet and take reins of his life/emotions again. While this happens, we are treated to a bunch of every-day faux pas that we all can identify with in a blink. Interested yet?(3) The boys' camaraderie is infectious. If you watch this movie with friends -- and this indeed is the best way to watch it! -- you'll know what I mean. This has to be one of the most honest portrayals of relationships between friends -- both the lover and the platonic variety.(4) Call me weird but I loved the sound track, a delectable blend of underground jazz and triphop.(5) Some of the ""get back on your feet"" dialogue for Mike is truly marvellous, and makes for better, more down-to-earth, more inspiring advice about life and relationships than Dr. Ruth and Oprah put together.(6) An interesting look at the Los Angeles we never see in films, the underground life of the struggling actors and writers and less glamorous people, not living in Malibu opulence as seen in other weaker films.(7) Some great Sega Genesis NHL ice-hockey ""footage"" (to use a dignified term) and an unusual preview of seeing Gretzky's head knocked.(8) This is to men what ""Sex and the City"" is to women. (Ok, SATC has had a lot more time than Swingers to entice us with the workings of the Modern Woman, but you get the idea)(9) A wide assortment of one-liners for you to conveniently plagiarize from. Not seen in a single movie since Roxanne with Steve Martin.(10) Oh, and it's so laid back, its horizontal. No spiffy visual FX, no crash boom bang, no cheap frills.

181340,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,1558908552,Steve,"[8, 25]","I had been curious to view ""Swingers"" for many years but never got around to it until I found it for a few bucks at a local re-sale store. Being a fan of Vince Vaughn, I figured he would be worth the three dollars I dropped for this highly acclaimed indie flick. Man, do I want my money back!For starters, is there a main character less likable than Jon Favreau's weak Mikey? The pinnacle of dislike was the maddening scene where Mike calls a girl he just met about a dozen times, leaving more and more paranoid and desperate messages. What adult does this? I might expect this from a thirteen year old, but an adult? Thankfully, the girl bluntly asks him to never call again and we are relieved that the universe has taken its pound of flesh from this most disagreeable moron. Perhaps, in a better actor's care, this unlikeable character might've had a chance to engender some empathy, but in the hands of writer Favreau, he is an expressionless clod, schlepping his way through his purposeless life. As the writer of this mess, one can only assume that this was some vanity piece extraordinaire with the writer/lead envisioning himself as the hard-talking mug dealing with heartbreak over some dame....or words to that effect.Secondly, the dialogue is painfully ridiculous. While it's possible that people talked like this during the very brief retro movement in the nineties, I sincerely doubt they used their secret-club phrases as inexplicably often as they do here. I honestly began to wonder if there wasn't some drinking game associated with this movie wherein you chugged every time you heard the word ""money"" or a derivation of the word ""baby,"" It's the only sensible explanation.Lastly, the movie gave me no reason to like any character in the movie. There were some brief moments when the character played by Office Space's Robert Livingston had something worthwhile to say and the character Lorraine (replete with her 40s name and 40s coif - one of the frequent and pandering tips of the fedora to the hip days of yore) seems to have potential, but that's it. Oddly enough, the one movie that this reminds me of as an example of how well you can do anti-heroes and periphery-dwelling people is Napoleon Dynamite. I almost wish that he would've appeared in this movie and replaced some of their painfully cool Scotch drinks with some bleach-tainted milk. It would've been the only funny thing in the movie. Maybe I could tolerate the utter lack of concern for anything beyond the next night's adventures if these were high school kids, but these are supposed to be men making their way in life and all they do is puff up their chests, try way too hard to be cool, and piss and moan about their love lives. They are little more than insipid male stereotypes.What about Vince Vaughn you ask? Well, try as he may to breathe life into his two dimensional role, he falls flat. The high point of the movie is his drunken take in the diner and that's only because you realize that you hate his character equally as much as the other self-indulgent stupid male clich&eacute;s. Guys get drunk. Guys scam on women. Guys play video games. Money, Baby! Ugh!!In summary, Favreau attempts to make a hip version of the Guys Being Stupid buddy movie. It's certainly a sub-genre full of possibilities but in ""Swingers"" it is little more than a boring, un-funny waste of time. It borrows unapologetically from many movies, from the Rat Pack vibe to the Woody Allen love-angst and through the ""Diner"" self-examinations, but skims only the surface and fails to support it with characters of interest, witty dialogue, or social/cultural observations. A bunch of guys go drinking in and around L.A., looking for sex, and talking about their job-less lives. How am I supposed to feel anything towards a bunch of guys who sponge off their parents while they waste their days playing Pitch n' Putt and ordering expensive drinks at Hollywood watering holes?

Such is the lounge lizard lifestyle of the early 1990s that quickly went into vogue, disappeared just as fast, and is sure to return again. A lot of time movies that revolve around such pictures in time become dated rapidly and are no longer entertaining to watch. SWINGERS is NOT such a movie.Though SWINGERS revolves around a modern struggling Rat Pack that spend their evenings as lounge lizards, this is a movie that has not gone out of style. The Swingers spend their days looking for work in the entertainment business intraspersed with games of golf and late night drives to Las Vegas. The plot is rather simple. Jon Favreau plays Mike, a guy moved out west to further his career as a comic. However, his girlfriend broke up with him shortly after he left and he still hasn't moved on six months later. The film follows Mike as his buddies help him get back in the game and find a new baby.SWINGERS is a great guy movie. It's a film about guys, written by guys, for guys. However, girls seem to enjoy the movie as well, but don't seem to understand it very much. The movie has some great acting (after all most of the cast was basically just playing themselves), a awesome soundtrack, and some of the most memorable movie lines in recent history (this film ranks up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE and TOMMY BOY in quotability).

181349,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,1558908552,Wheelchair Assassin,"[4, 5]","There aren't many movies that belong in any respectable DVD collection, but Swingers should be an no-brainer of a pick, especially for those of the male persuasion.  This movie was made ten years ago for the staggeringly low sum of about $250,000 (more than Clerks, but about a quarter percent of what Terminator 2 cost), but it ended up being yet another of Miramax's independent success stories, and even now it's easy to see why.  This may not be the ultimate guy movie, but it's close, as it packs a heavy emotional punch without ever becoming schmaltzy or manipulative.  It's paced at breakneck speed, edited and directed with ruthless efficiency, and utterly unpolished in appearance (in their commentary track, the director and editor basically admit they barely knew how to make a movie at the time), but that's all part of Swingers's relaxed, almost improvised charm.While it may breeze by in a mere 95 minutes, Swingers is successfully largely because it's packed almost to bursting with brilliant dialogue.  This is, simply put, one of the most quotable movies of the 1990's, right up there with Goodfellas, The Big Lebowski, and Office Space (in fact, a couple years ago Bill Simmons, aka ESPN.com's Sports Guy, used quotes from this movie for his team-by-team NFL preview).  The characters basically use their own language, which may well be how L.A.-area lounge-lizard types actually talk for all this reviewer knows (""Dude, you are so f***ing money"" being a typical line), but the central ideas of the movie come across easily regardless of the lingo they're conveyed in.  In sharp contrast to the generally loathsome teen dramedies that started coming out just a couple years after this movie's release, Swingers is that rare comedy that never takes the low road and panders to its audience; instead it plays it cool throughout and offers up plenty of humanity to go with its humor.  It is hysterically funny, but like great comedies from Better Off Dead to Clerks to Sideways, it's funny partly because it's rooted in a reality that's often no laughing matter.  There's one scene in particular that sums up the movie, when Jon Favreau's protagonist Mike keeps leaving increasingly uncomfortable early-morning phone messages for a woman he's just met in a bar until she eventually gets on the phone and tells him never to call her again.  Sparsely lit and painfully drawn-out, it's hilarious and agonizing to watch all at the same time.  It's one of several scenes throught the movie where I felt somewhat guilty about laughing but laughed just the same.At bottom, Swingers has such enduring appeal because of the contradiction at its core: it's a movie about serious subjects (lost love, male friendship, the struggle to find oneself), but it never really lets on that it's about anything serious, instead letting the viewers figure it out for themselves.  Beneath all the humor, of which there is a great deal, Swingers is about people who have hit their mid-20's and found that everything isn't quite as they thought it would be.  In another telling segment, the movie's two main characters hop in the car for an impromptu trip to Vegas, but their excitement gradually fades on the long drive from L.A., and the situation doesn't improve when their casino experience turns out to be far less glamorous than anticipated.  This scene (actually about a quarter of the movie) provides a neat metaphor for the overarching theme of Swingers: we all have big dreams at one point or another, but reality often fails to measure up.  There are legions of such people out there, and my guess is most can find something to relate to in Mike (played note-perfectly by Favreau, who also wrote the movie).  The movie's opening finds Mike struggling to get over his ex-girlfriend six months after their breakup, going nowhere in his standup career, and deep into a spiral of despair and desperation.  Sadly, we've all known at least one guy like Mike, the sensitive type who eventually winds up retreating into negativity and self-pity when things aren't going their way.While Mike is ultimately the central figure, Swingers is nothing if not an ensemble movie, and it's populated by a cast of well-drawn, believable, and decidedly funny characters.  Mike is joined in his personal and professional struggles by Trent (Vince Vaughn), Rob (Ron Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn), and Charles (Alex Desert), all of whom have found themselves in basically the same boat.  They hit a series of trendy clubs and parties throughout the movie, but remain virtual nobodies on the fringe of the local scene.  These guys are, for lack of a better word, a bunch of tools, but they're likeable for precisely that reason.  Beneath their hip exteriors, they're just struggling actors with no girlfriends, and the cast obviously has a lot of fun playing characters who aren't to be taken in any way seriously.  Vaughn is especially indelible in the role of Trent, the ultimate wannabe hipster, right down to his dapper appearance and frequent use of Rat Pack-era slang.  In lesser hands, Trent might come off as a laughable poser, but here he's given an undeniable depth and humanity because his overwhelming good intentions are always clearly visible.As I've already mentioned, this movie was made for next to nothing, and it does show a great deal.  The commentary tracks on this DVD (one with director Doug Liman and editor Steve Mirrione, the other with Favreau and Vaughn) highlight the myriad corners that were cut and cinematic ""rules"" that were broken due to budget constraints, but in the end it all works anyway.  Swingers is wisely limited to a small scale, examining the immense difficulties and occasional victories that are a part of daily life, no matter where you live or what age you are.  This fact, along with its hilarious script and sharp acting, combine to make a movie that's still utterly relevant ten years after its release.  The term ""classic"" is thrown around way too often, but Swingers is one movie that definitely deserves the label.",4,Small budget + big heart=Swingers,1113868800,"04 19, 2005",2005,6053,"['are',

You follow the guys around town and hanging out drinking but there also more drama about getting over an EX.Just watch the scene where Vince Vaughn and the guys are have a meal after a heavy night of drinking. Haaa it was very &quot;Saturday Night Liveish&quot;.... It is a dry pan comedy,it has many classic lines in the movie and Heather Graham is in it. What more can I say..Very under rated movie but tons of fun.",5,Mickey 's the Winner.....,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,505,"['Very', 'funny', 'movie', 'basic', 'concept', 'movie', 'lots', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'actors', 'just', 'party', 'follow', 'guys', 'town', 'hanging', 'out', 'drinking', 'there', 'also', 'more', 'drama', 'getting', 'EX.Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'where', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'guys', 'are', 'have', 'meal', 'heavy', 'night', 'drinking', 'Haaa', 'was', 'very', 'quot', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Liveish', 'quot', 'dry', 'pan', 'comedy', 'many', 'classic', 'lines', 'movie', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'say..Very', 'rated', 'movie', 'tons', 'fun']",N/A

I'd heard lots of good word-of-mouth about this movie, but never had the opportunity to see it.  Now that I have, I find myself equally pleased and disappointed with this film--perhaps to a contradictory degree.  On the one hand, I look to the extent of &quot;swinger&quot; bedlam that this could have displayed and feel like the filmmakers missed a beautiful opportunity.  On the other hand, I can't help but applaud them for NOT succumbing to the stereotype I have appropriated to it.Regardless, from a comedic standpoint this film achieves what it set out to do.  I wish that the script had detailed the lives of the other characters a little more intensely.  We find the idiosyncrasies of John Favreau?s and Vince Vaughn's character, but the other's seem rather stale, not to mention the fact that they could have proved to have very interesting back stories.  Otherwise, though, this film is very, very fun--sometimes digressing into some extreme examples of humor that don't perfectly flow with the remainder of the film (the answering machine), but it never depletes from the experience.  Most of the time, the film stays true to the slacker, party boys of LA, and all the sloth, Sega Ice Hockey, and TV pilot auditions in between the parties.One aspect that cannot be praised highly enough, however, is that this film does not fall pray to the bane of most slacker comedies: a sappy, melodramatic climax.  Swingers shuns this, and for that I praise it.  When John Favreau's character does finally come around, and the audience witnesses his development and the catalysts that spur it, there is never a feeling of hokey, sentimentalism--and that, perhaps, is why this film has achieved such cult status.  It can be enjoyed by all demographics, without concern for gender, age, or interest.And so with this honest, cringe-free, and hilarious interpretation of the party boys of LA, one can't help but fall in love with almost everything this film has to offer.  There are a lot of turns, interesting situations, and peculiar incidents that maintain the light-hearted side of the film, but there is also enough attention to the labor of love, without going over the top with theatrical rhetoric on the subject. The film may not stand as your favorite in life, but most out there will probably find a lot to enjoy in this little film--and a lot to relate to.",4,Makes You Want To Be A &quot;Swinger&quot; Yourself,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",2001,2455,"[""'ll"", 'spare', 'quot', 'money', 'quot', 'quotes', 'resolve', 'simply', 'say', 'good', 'movie', ""'d"", 'heard', 'lots', 'good', 'word-of-mouth', 'movie', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Now', 'have', 'find', 'equally', 'pleased', 'disappointed', 'film', 'perhaps', 'contradictory', 'degree', 'one', 'hand', 'look', 'extent', 'quot', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'displayed', 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'missed', 'beautiful', 'opportunity', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'applaud', 'NOT', 'succumbing', 'stereotype', 'have', 'appropriated', 'it.Regardless', 'comedic', 'standpoint', 'film', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'detailed', 'lives', 'other', 'characters', 'little', 'more', 'intensely', 'find', 'idiosyncrasies', 'John', 'Favreau', 's', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'character', 'other', 'seem', 'rather', 'stale', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'could', 'have', 'proved', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'back', 'stories', 'Otherwise', 'though', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'fun', 'sometimes', 'digressing', 'extreme', 'examples', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'flow', 'remainder', 'film', 'answering', 'machine', 'never', 'experience', 'Most', 'time', 'film', 'true', 'slacker', 'party', 'boys', 'LA', 'sloth', 'Sega', 'Ice', 'Hockey', 'TV', 'pilot', 'auditions', 'parties.One', 'aspect', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'praised', 'highly', 'enough', 'however', 'film', 'not', 'fall', 'pray', 'bane', 'most', 'slacker', 'comedies', 'sappy', 'melodramatic', 'climax', 'Swingers', 'shuns', 'praise', 'When', 'John', 'Favreau', 'character', 'finally', 'come', 'audience', 'development', 'catalysts', 'spur', 'never', 'feeling', 'hokey', 'sentimentalism', 'perhaps', 'why', 'film', 'achieved', 'such', 'cult', 'status', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'demographics', 'concern', 'gender', 'age', 'interest.And', 'so', 'honest', 'cringe-free', 'hilarious', 'interpretation', 'party', 'boys', 'LA', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'almost', 'everything', 'film', 'offer', 'are', 'lot', 'turns', 'interesting', 'situations', 'peculiar', 'incidents', 'maintain', 'light-hearted', 'side', 'film', 'also', 'enough', 'attention', 'labor', 'love', 'going', 'top', 'theatrical', 'rhetoric', 'subject', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'stand', 'favorite', 'life', 'most', 'there', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'little', 'film', 'lot', 'relate']",N/A
