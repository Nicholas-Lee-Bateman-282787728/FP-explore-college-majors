There was absolutely no reason for everyone to be running around in only their drawers, except for Mr DeCourteou to let us know of his sexual preference. It added absolutely nothing to the story. He could have invited the actors over to his house and paid them to strip.It would have had the same amount of relevance to this movie. The fight scenes could have been better.The movie, as a whole though is quite good. I still think this directors best film is ""Final Stab"", but this is a close second. Some of the acting, specifically the fraternity king, could have been better, but it passed. This is definatley a keeper. I also like the fact that not too much attention was given to the vampire aspect, instead of the interpersonal relationships.

The DVD case and VHS box lead you to believe that you are to be excited by seeing some really hot young male vampires just light up the screen and frighten the bejesus out of you.The boys may be attractive, but as soon as they open their mouths all sense of attractiveness dissipates.  These guys couldn't act their way out of a wet paper sack.  And the script....can you say P U?

675283,A30R6HEYBNOJX8,B00005QIVO,J. Edkin,"[14, 16]","Producer/Director David DeCoteau is trying to create a new genre of movie. I'm not sure what it is. &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; has elements of a horror movie, yet is not scary; it has elements of suspense, but does not raise any tension; it has elements of homoeroticism, but the one sexual scene is pretty darn straight (or bi, at best, featuring two guys and one girl, although the guys are focused on the girl and not each other). The genre seems to be built around young man in various states of undress (but never seen completely undressed) and is being marketed to gay audiences. Feh. Gay men would be better served by renting or buying any number of softcore movies out there from the likes of Bel Ami than pay for this lame bait and switch.The plot is your relatively standard T&amp;A (in this case, P&amp;A--and I'm thinking pecs) horror movie, but without the sex or any significant amounts of blood. It takes place at a college where one frat is high above the others. What is it about the frat and its members that make it so special? (Read the other reviews, and you'll know. I won't spoil the plot, such as it is.) The college seems to exist in a time and place of its own with no real town nearby.Into this setting come two freshmen roommates, Chris (Nathan Watkins) and Dan (Josh Hammond). Chris is your standard issue jock and Dan is your standard issue geek. If you've seen any horror movies from the 80s or 90s, you know the pair. There is an air of sexual tension in the filmmaking, but the movie takes great care to establish that the boys are straight and both interested (kinda) in Megan (Elizabeth Bruderman), one of the few girls on campus. Dan desperately wants to belong, Chris has no interest in being part of the crowd. Chris becomes seduced by Devon, the charismatic president of the top frat. (I base the assessment of the character solely on the mechanics of the plot and not on Bradley Stryker's self-conscious acting.) It is up to Dan to save his friend/roommate. It's a by-the-numbers affair with nothing to make to stand out.Nathan Watkins is attractive (DeCoteau's camera lingers on his scantily-clad body many times) and his acting is adequate. Josh Hammond gives an animated performance, perhaps too lively. His eyes dart about constantly and his head always seems to be in motion. At least he looks alive, which is more than can be said of some of the other performers. Of the lot, his is the most appealing and interesting performances. He could have a solid future in sitcoms and light comedies if he keeps working.The script is perfunctory at best. The filmmaking matches the script step-for-step. (That's not a compliment.) There were many cases where I wanted DeCoteau to pull his camera back. He seems to favor close ups, not giving his actor much room within the frame to move. It becomes very claustrophobic, and when combined with some choppy editing, there are times when it becomes very difficult to follow the action.The DVD offers no extras and the film is presented in 1.33:1 screen aspect ratio. As this was probably shot for direct-to-video, I don't know if there was a version with a wider screen aspect ratio.All-in-all, if you are considering purchasing this DVD because you are looking for a thriller with gay elements or a cheesy guilty pleasure, look elsewhere. The gay audience should put there money into movies with true gay content rather than settle for this weak tease.(c)2001 Joe Edkin",1,Lame,1007337600,"12 3, 2001",2001,3455,"['Producer/Director', 'David', 'DeCoteau', 'trying', 'create', 'new', 'genre', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'quot', 'elements', 'horror', 'movie', 'yet', 'not', 'scary', 'elements', 'suspense', 'not', 'raise', 'tension', 'elements', 'homoeroticism', 'one', 'sexual', 'scene', 'pretty', 'darn', 'straight', 'bi', 'best', 'featuring', 'two', 'guys', 'one', 'girl', 'guys', 'are', 'focused', 'girl', 'not', 'other', 'genre', 'be', 'built', 'young', 'man', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'never', 'seen', 'completely', 'undressed', 'being', 'marketed', 'gay', 'audiences', 'Feh', 'Gay', 'men', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'renting', 'buying', 'number', 'softcore', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'likes', 'Bel', 'Ami', 'pay', 'lame', 'bait', 'switch.The', 'plot', 'relatively', 'standard', 'T', 'amp', 'A', 'case', 'P', 'amp', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'pecs', 'horror', 'movie', 'sex', 'significant', 'amounts', 'blood', 'place', 'college', 'where', 'one', 'frat', 'high', 'others', 'What', 'frat', 'members', 'make', 'special', 'Read', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'plot', 'such', 'college', 'exist', 'time', 'place', 'own', 'real', 'town', 'setting', 'come', 'two', 'freshmen', 'roommates', 'Chris', 'Nathan', 'Watkins', 'Dan', 'Josh', 'Hammond', 'Chris', 'standard', 'issue', 'jock', 'Dan', 'standard', 'issue', 'geek', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'horror', 'movies', '80s', '90s', 'know', 'pair', 'air', 'sexual', 'tension', 'filmmaking', 'movie', 'great', 'care', 'establish', 'boys', 'are', 'straight', 'interested', 'kinda', 'Megan', 'Elizabeth', 'Bruderman', 'one', 'few', 'girls', 'campus', 'Dan', 'desperately', 'belong', 'Chris', 'interest', 'being', 'part', 'crowd', 'Chris', 'becomes', 'seduced', 'Devon', 'charismatic', 'president', 'top', 'frat', 'base', 'assessment', 'character', 'solely', 'mechanics', 'plot', 'not', 'Bradley', 'Stryker', 'self-conscious', 'acting', 'Dan', 'save', 'friend/roommate', 'by-the-numbers', 'affair', 'nothing', 'make', 'stand', 'out.Nathan', 'Watkins', 'attractive', 'DeCoteau', 'camera', 'scantily-clad', 'body', 'many', 'times', 'acting', 'adequate', 'Josh', 'Hammond', 'animated', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'too', 'lively', 'eyes', 'dart', 'constantly', 'head', 'always', 'be', 'motion', 'least', 'alive', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'performers', 'lot', 'most', 'appealing', 'interesting', 'performances', 'could', 'have', 'solid', 'future', 'sitcoms', 'light', 'comedies', 'working.The', 'script', 'perfunctory', 'best', 'filmmaking', 'script', 'step-for-step', 'not', 'compliment', 'were', 'many', 'cases', 'where', 'wanted', 'DeCoteau', 'pull', 'camera', 'back', 'favor', 'close', 'ups', 'not', 'giving', 'actor', 'much', 'room', 'frame', 'move', 'very', 'claustrophobic', 'when', 'combined', 'choppy', 'editing', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'very', 'difficult', 'follow', 'action.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'film', 'presented', '1.33:1', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'was', 'probably', 'shot', 'direct-to-video', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'version', 'wider', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio.All-in-all', 'are', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'are', 'looking', 'thriller', 'gay', 'elements', 'cheesy', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'gay', 'audience', 'should', 'put', 'money', 'movies', 'true', 'gay', 'content', 'rather', 'settle', 'weak', 'tease', 'c', '2001', 'Joe', 'Edkin']",The Brotherhood

I bought this movie along with its ""sequels"" (I use the word ""sequels"" in its loosest context) believing that the storyline as described sounded intriguing, a little mystical, a little horror-thriller-scary, and good entertainment.  My opinion?  Don't waste your time if you're seeking any in-depth plots or *any* mystical-horror-thriller-suspense experiences.  I actually sat through it, intently waiting for it to get better.  It didn't.  I sat through the second movie thinking it couldn't be any worse than the first and I was dead wrong.  I turned the third one off about twenty minutes into it (that over-the-top sword-wielding dude replete with covered head and face -- Darth Vader meets Michael Jackson -- decked out in black with glittering adornments had me rolling my eyes).  The fourth was the most interesting plot-wise as far as I watched it, but I didn't finish watching it before passing the whole 4-DVD series on to my 21-year old niece.Why did I pass it on to her?  Because of the series' all-pervasive theme of showcasing young male bodies clad in boxer briefs accompanied by swelling music during the many close-ups.  There were some shows of excess testosterone, some shows of weird male bonding, some shows of over-sensitive types screwing with the works, and a great deal of head-tripping follow-the-leader games.  Idiocy in abundance.And the write-up on the back of the first movie's box says this became a cult favorite.  I'd absolutely *love* to know who in his/her right mind would enjoy this ridiculous series.By all means, buy this movie and its sequels if you're into yawning through nonsense while waiting for the music to swell and the clothes to come off ... there's lots of rippling muscles and caressing by the camera of body lengths to see if that's your thing.This series is supposed to contain some sort of gay connotation?  *Where?*  None of the guys moved on each other, only some half-witted groping of a few idiot women.I think I'm too old for such ... ummm ... silliness.

Finally, a cast of beautiful boys become the centerpiece in a genre that stereotypically has &quot;big on the breasts and small on the grey matter&quot; teenage girls as victims.Decidedly homoerotic (as is the sequel, Brotherhood II), but never crossing the line where one could say that this is a &quot;gay horror film&quot;, The Brotherhood is unique in that while being highly erotic (lots of scenes in &quot;whitie tighties&quot; for the male leads), and definately an homage to the male form, the film never becomes gratuitously sexist, nor does it contain nudity.Even more remarkable, the acting is superb! Nathan Watkins, as the male lead, Chris, is not only extremely handsome, and a delight to watch on screen, but he has talent as an actor.Refreshing to see this new genre, which DeCoteau refers to as &quot;horror films for girls&quot; (though admits freely the homoeroticism is intentional), newcomers to DeCoteau will find that it *is* quite possible to have stunningly visual actors, great acting talent, decent plot and dialogue in a genre of films that often times just stoops to mindless &quot;sexploitation&quot; and formula.Well done! Teenage girls and gay men who like the horror genre will find this DVD well worth it... and, news is that DeCoteau has heard loud and clear from his fans how much we appreciate it. The Brotherhood III and IV are already in production, and for those who find this film an enjoyable one (for whatever reason) will like the sequel as well, and should also check out DeCoteau's &quot;Voodo Academy&quot; (be warned though... make sure you get the DIRECTORS CUT of Voodo Academy as Full Moon initially released the film with a full 20+ mins. cut out, because of the homoerotic nature of the film.)",5,Refreshingly different take on the horror genre!,1006992000,"11 29, 2001",2001,1841,"['David', 'DeCoteau', 'traditional', 'mold', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'films', 'BrotherHood', 'Finally', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'boys', 'become', 'centerpiece', 'genre', 'stereotypically', 'quot', 'big', 'breasts', 'small', 'grey', 'matter', 'quot', 'teenage', 'girls', 'victims.Decidedly', 'homoerotic', 'sequel', 'Brotherhood', 'II', 'never', 'crossing', 'line', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'quot', 'horror', 'film', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'unique', 'being', 'highly', 'erotic', 'lots', 'scenes', 'quot', 'tighties', 'quot', 'male', 'leads', 'definately', 'homage', 'male', 'form', 'film', 'never', 'gratuitously', 'sexist', 'contain', 'nudity.Even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'superb', 'Nathan', 'Watkins', 'male', 'lead', 'Chris', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'handsome', 'delight', 'watch', 'screen', 'talent', 'actor.Refreshing', 'see', 'new', 'genre', 'DeCoteau', 'refers', 'quot', 'horror', 'films', 'girls', 'quot', 'admits', 'freely', 'homoeroticism', 'intentional', 'newcomers', 'DeCoteau', 'will', 'find', 'quite', 'possible', 'have', 'stunningly', 'visual', 'actors', 'great', 'acting', 'talent', 'decent', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'genre', 'films', 'often', 'just', 'stoops', 'mindless', 'quot', 'sexploitation', 'quot', 'formula.Well', 'done', 'Teenage', 'girls', 'gay', 'men', 'who', 'horror', 'genre', 'will', 'find', 'DVD', 'well', 'news', 'DeCoteau', 'heard', 'loud', 'clear', 'fans', 'how', 'much', 'appreciate', 'Brotherhood', 'III', 'IV', 'are', 'already', 'production', 'who', 'find', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'reason', 'will', 'like', 'sequel', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'DeCoteau', 'quot', 'Voodo', 'Academy', 'quot', 'be', 'warned', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'DIRECTORS', 'CUT', 'Voodo', 'Academy', 'Full', 'Moon', 'initially', 'released', 'film', 'full', '20+', 'mins', 'cut', 'out', 'homoerotic', 'nature', 'film']",The Brotherhood
