That's more than I can say for most people.  Now, I've never been the brightest bulb in the bunch, but during the last fifteen years I've detected a very real hollow feeling somewhere internally.  I speculated that the empty feeling I sensed was simply a gigantic void of ignorance, one whose existence depended on my being fed lies for a number of years straight.  I literally couldn't bear to not know, whatever it was that I had to know, any longer.  I began soul-searching and it led to my having a thousand questions which I knew would not be easily answered.  And in the last five years all of the questions that I had about world events have finally been, and are being, answered.  You have to realize that we've been in a depression that started sometime in between September of 2008 and February of 2009.  You wont hear that word ""depression"" being used in the news media on the television, but if you talk to economics professors at your local college, they will tell you that yes, the GDP shows that we've been in a depression since at least last February.  And it's only getting worse.  Real unemployment is at least 21% nationwide right now, and to give you something with which you can compare that number to, unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s was 25% nationwide.Automobile accidents do not just happen, they have a cause, and are caused.  Likewise, world events do not just happen by accident or mere chance.  If you want to learn how economic depressions are caused, and why they are caused, then watch this DVD.  That's all you have to do, 3 1/2 hours of your time to watch a video is nothing when you consider how it'll save you a whole lot of reading you would have otherwise had to do.  Personally though I yearn to learn more about the real history of this country and of the world, and to do that I have to study the bank.  Might not be fun but it has to be done, and there's nothing to it but to do it.  So the next book I plan on reading is the Creature from Jekyll Island by G. Edward Griffin.  And I trust that that book will be even much more of a wakeup-call than this excellent documentary is.  It takes work to accomplish anything worthwhile; we have to see the wall, and acknowledge its existence, in order to move beyond it into better terrain.  End the Federal Reserve, and maybe then our world can have a chance to exist in peace.

167582,A2A1XYSB692L6J,0979238013,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[9, 11]","There are TWO almost similar DVDs called ""The Money Masters"" for sale on Amazon.One has many reviews -- this one, (with the same title and just about the same cover), has NO reviews....except this one, which I am writing.  The other DVD has a slightly darker background to the light blue currency facimilies in the background -- but that's about all the difference I can see.  The other DVD is said to run for three and a half hours.  NO running-time is given for this DVD.What are the REAL differences between the two DVDs?  Is this, perhaps, even a conspiracy of sorts?  Is all the REAL information on THIS DVD?  Or is all the REAL information on the OTHER DVD?  Or are they both essentially the very SAME DVD, and ""the money masters"" who PRODUCED this DVD, (very different from ""The Money Masters"" of the title), just want people to buy both versions, to be sure, so that they, (the producers of this DVD), can have...........................more money?This has happened at least one other time to me on Amazon.  A book I wanted was on two separate pages.  One cost $100, the other, about $12.  Stupidly, I bought the $100 book.  I later searched for the same book on Ebay.  Several copies were listed....none above $20.  It was the same book!  PLEASE Amazon and publishers....if there IS a difference between two versions of ANYTHING, tell us would-be buyers what, if any, those differences are?  In this DVD, running time and copyright date would be the most important bits of information. Especially here, (and with the TITLE that this DVD has!), the suspicion that presently remains in my mind....that of possible gouging of customers -- is ironic, and very, very sad.  Although it is particularly irksome with THIS DVD, I believe firmly that ALL differences between ALL similar items showuld be given on Amazon.Amazon is an intelligent website, which intelligent people visit!

Renamed ""Money Masters - How Banks Create the World's Money"" ([..]) and is a real education about how how the money supply has been created in the U.S.through the fractional reserve system since 1913.This video traces the history of how the goldsmiths of old gradually got into the business of loaning money, and eventually even creating it. This practice led to the use of ""fractionalized reserves,"" in which money is created by the Federal Reserve (a private, profit-based company...not ""Federal"" at all) as it is loaned to banks, and multiplied by a factor of 10 as they loan it out. This is a ""debt-based"" system of creating the money supply for a country, and loaded with dangers! Much better than this debt-based ""Federal Reserve Note"" money system is the ""United States Note"" money system, which involves printing our own money (in limited amounts, of course).This video points out that these nations did not need to go to these intl bankers for money, as they could print their own, and thereby avoid interest payments, inflation, lengthy recessions and depressions. Our country has done it in the past, and it worked amazingly well. Washington, Madison, Jackson, Lincoln, and many others understood the danger any nation who deals with private bankers faces, and warned of the consequences.A great video for getting to understand the ins and outs of our financial system, and its inherent dangers.",5,Great video on how the money supply is created,1215302400,"07 6, 2008",2008,1438,"['Great', 'DVD', 'very', 'enlightening', 'Renamed', 'Money', 'Masters', 'How', 'Banks', 'Create', 'World', 'Money', '[', '..', ']', 'real', 'education', 'how', 'how', 'money', 'supply', 'been', 'created', 'U.S.through', 'fractional', 'reserve', 'system', '1913.This', 'video', 'traces', 'history', 'how', 'goldsmiths', 'old', 'gradually', 'got', 'business', 'loaning', 'money', 'eventually', 'even', 'creating', 'practice', 'led', 'use', 'fractionalized', 'reserves', 'money', 'created', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'private', 'profit-based', 'company', 'not', 'Federal', 'loaned', 'banks', 'multiplied', 'factor', '10', 'loan', 'out', 'debt-based', 'system', 'creating', 'money', 'supply', 'country', 'loaded', 'dangers', 'Much', 'better', 'debt-based', 'Federal', 'Reserve', 'Note', 'money', 'system', 'United', 'States', 'Note', 'money', 'system', 'printing', 'own', 'money', 'limited', 'amounts', 'course', 'video', 'points', 'out', 'nations', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'go', 'intl', 'bankers', 'money', 'could', 'print', 'own', 'thereby', 'avoid', 'interest', 'payments', 'inflation', 'lengthy', 'recessions', 'depressions', 'country', 'done', 'past', 'worked', 'amazingly', 'well', 'Washington', 'Madison', 'Jackson', 'Lincoln', 'many', 'others', 'understood', 'danger', 'nation', 'who', 'private', 'bankers', 'warned', 'consequences.A', 'great', 'video', 'getting', 'understand', 'ins', 'outs', 'financial', 'system', 'inherent', 'dangers']",N/A
