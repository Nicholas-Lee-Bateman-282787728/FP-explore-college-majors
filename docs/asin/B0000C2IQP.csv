But if you want a movie that isn't a fairy take, and one that forces you to think, Sweet Sixteen is a good choice.I see no reason this film shouldn't have been made. I don't think Sweet Sixteen's purpose is to introduce or represent Scottish culture.  It's about a youth, Liam, facing the dissapointments of life, and how cruel life can be.It also is not heart-warming, and it was misleading for the packaging to include that word.In Sweet Sixteen, I found myself hoping that once Liam's mother came out of prison that his life would get better: instead, the dissapointments kept coming.

When will they  ever learn??We don't need to be Scottish to know the portrayal here is hauntingly true, for human nature is all the same everywhere at least for the last thousand years or so.Liam has not just broken his sister's heart but has obviously upset the hearts of all those seeing this film. It's not just because of his pain endurance capacity, nor his stubborn courage, but rather his legitimate or even noble idea to rebuild his family. His boundage with his mother is understandably strong: his bigger sister, being a young single mother herself and obviously a victim herself,  knew more about life and has learn not to expect anything from her mother. But Liam was still in his puberty, barely 15...Do we blame him for the fact that he didn't have any proper unbringing save some vivious beatings on and off, or that he doesn't know enough about morals and values when his hunger for the love of his mother and a normal family takes precedence?  Well, the film is not saying that is the norm, or that all  lower class folks there are all like him. Far from it, quite a proportion of them as depicted in the film are charmingly decent, which in balance makes this movie so convincing and so moving. Even Liam himself possess some nobility that is apt to make most of us feel ashamed; even his best pal, another victim of similar cirsumstances--so real and so vulnerable and mischivious-- is not evil at all...The violence, though punchingly real, is not really excessive. Everything occassion serves a point.  And as a matter of fact, it's the realistic approach that make this film so real and so absorbing and as such a huge success.The views from this quiet part of Scotland by the seaside are great. The cast is excellent, not just because of good acting and good directorship but also due the fact that there isn't any big name or familiar faces here that would distract us from seeing what is being depicted in this quiet quarter of the world or from the events which are gnawing your heart. The rhythm of the movie is fast and yet neither the trees nor the forest have got out of the hand: there isn't a minute that you are likely to get bored.This is defintely one of the best films one can come across recently.

772722,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B0000C2IQP,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[3, 3]","In Ken Loach's stark but richly rewarding ""Sweet Sixteen"", we follow events leading up to the sixteenth birthday of the resilient but reckless Liam as he tries to prepare a life and a home in anticipation of his incarcerated but soon-to-be-released mother's return.Liam is portrayed by the perfectly cast Martin Compston, whose emotive face can seem so youthfully vibrant yet at the same time so weathered and world-weary.  And apt visage aside, this first-time actor here proves himself to be one of the great young performers emerging in the cinematic world of late - his pitch-perfect portrayal of Liam is right up there with recent starmaking roles turned in by the likes of Ryan Gosling and Joseph Gordon-Leavitt.Liam is joined in this film by his best friend and literal partner-in-crime Pinball (who's certainly no wizard, although is perhaps so named because of the way he careeningly drives the ""borrowed"" vehicles in which he joyrides).  Pinball is ably portrayed by William Ruane, another previously unknown local who is also quite a find.  Together the two boys try to find ways to survive and thrive amidst an environment in which the odds are greatly stacked against them.The film is actually shot in Greenock, just down the Clyde river from Glasgow, a town where almost all the jobs have moved elsewhere, leading to few ""legitimate"" ways to earn money.  A place where once-lovely but now dilapidated tower blocks are inhabited in equal measure by junkies and families.  As Loach himself states in the appropriately spare commentary track (where long silences abound), it's a location where the visually spectacular scenery ""contrasts rather sadly with the quality of life of many of the people who live there.""In ""Sweet Sixteen"", we find the legendary director's usually strident political overtones to be toned down a tad, his muted message blending in nicely with the drab browns, greys and greens of the bleak and beautiful Glaswegian cityscape.  The film shows us, subtly yet firmly, how the most promising and gifted attributes in souls young and old alike can sometimes be squelched and squandered by systemic and structural societal inequities.  And though it can be depressing to take in at times, this film is ultimately breathtaking to behold, and the most remarkable thing about Compston's performance is that he portrays Liam so winningly that you actually root for him to be successful in even the most questionable of deeds.  All of which makes for a highly recommended viewing experience.",5,A House Doesn't Make A Home,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,2518,"['Ken', 'Loach', 'stark', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'follow', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'sixteenth', 'birthday', 'resilient', 'reckless', 'Liam', 'prepare', 'life', 'home', 'anticipation', 'incarcerated', 'soon-to-be-released', 'mother', 'return.Liam', 'portrayed', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Martin', 'Compston', 'emotive', 'face', 'can', 'seem', 'so', 'youthfully', 'vibrant', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'so', 'weathered', 'world-weary', 'apt', 'visage', 'aside', 'first-time', 'actor', 'here', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'young', 'performers', 'emerging', 'cinematic', 'world', 'late', 'pitch-perfect', 'portrayal', 'Liam', 'right', 'there', 'recent', 'starmaking', 'roles', 'turned', 'likes', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Leavitt.Liam', 'joined', 'film', 'best', 'friend', 'literal', 'partner-in-crime', 'Pinball', 'who', 'certainly', 'wizard', 'perhaps', 'so', 'named', 'way', 'borrowed', 'vehicles', 'Pinball', 'ably', 'portrayed', 'William', 'Ruane', 'previously', 'unknown', 'local', 'who', 'also', 'quite', 'find', 'Together', 'two', 'boys', 'try', 'find', 'ways', 'survive', 'thrive', 'amidst', 'environment', 'odds', 'are', 'greatly', 'stacked', 'them.The', 'film', 'actually', 'shot', 'Greenock', 'just', 'Clyde', 'river', 'Glasgow', 'town', 'where', 'almost', 'jobs', 'have', 'moved', 'elsewhere', 'leading', 'few', 'legitimate', 'ways', 'earn', 'money', 'place', 'where', 'once-lovely', 'now', 'dilapidated', 'tower', 'blocks', 'are', 'inhabited', 'equal', 'measure', 'junkies', 'families', 'Loach', 'appropriately', 'spare', 'commentary', 'track', 'where', 'long', 'silences', 'abound', 'location', 'where', 'visually', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'rather', 'sadly', 'quality', 'life', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'find', 'legendary', 'director', 'usually', 'strident', 'political', 'overtones', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'tad', 'muted', 'message', 'blending', 'nicely', 'drab', 'browns', 'greys', 'greens', 'bleak', 'beautiful', 'Glaswegian', 'cityscape', 'film', 'subtly', 'yet', 'firmly', 'how', 'most', 'promising', 'gifted', 'attributes', 'souls', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'squelched', 'squandered', 'systemic', 'structural', 'societal', 'inequities', 'can', 'be', 'depressing', 'take', 'times', 'film', 'ultimately', 'breathtaking', 'behold', 'most', 'remarkable', 'thing', 'Compston', 'performance', 'Liam', 'so', 'winningly', 'actually', 'root', 'be', 'successful', 'even', 'most', 'questionable', 'deeds', 'highly', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'experience']",N/A

Liam is destined to repeat the same mistakes that he is fighting so hard against, and all we can do is sit back and watch him struggle with the rock-and-a-hard-place decisions with which he is faced.This may sound like your typical &quot;good boy falls in with the wrong crowd&quot; film, but it is far from predictable, and the story and acting are excellent.

Can anyone, let alone the poor, ever achieve a goal of shattering that progression? Are we all destined to be what we are? And can family history and your past be left behind? I enjoyed this film immensely, reminded often of how people may change, but situations remain the same. Liam (played wonderfully by the handsome, athletic and very natural Martin Compston) knows his destiny. And, like his sister, knows there is a better life. But unlike Chantelle, Liam is willing to sell his soul to get it. While Chantelle studies hard at school, bring up her adorable son Calum, Liam will risk his own life to make his imprisoned mothers life better when she gets out in a few months, a day before his sweet 16 Birthday. But, reality sets in when he realizes what he must do to get that life. And while he's willing to do it, it is slowly killing his soul.The films coldness works, as the sun is never seen. It reminds us that Liam, and the life of many in Glasgow (and really, this could be any town in any country), are not what movies are made about. It shows with laser point accuracy for some, the only way to ""move on up"" is to sell what little humanity you have left. Liam's sister knows the true way to succeed, but that's not for Liam. He loves his sister, his nephew and his mom, but Chantelle is disappointed that Liam cannot see the forest for the trees.And, like so many, he learns too late that maybe his sister is right. Maybe her bitterness at her mother is justified (as Jean proves it by going back to her hateful boyfriend, Stan) and maybe there is away out of the hell you born into.The cast is wonderful, led my Compston's Liam. Annmarie Fulton is the sister who must protect her son and brother, but feels she is losing him. Michelle Coulter is the mother you've seen on every episode of COPS and who continues to return to the one place that is perhaps, the worse place to be. Gary McCormack is the typical villain of sorts. His Stan is filled with so much hate, that you can understand why Liam would not want to be near him. But William Ruane stands out as Liam's best friend Pinball. He too is a lost soul, but finds himself on the short end of the stick. He tries to be like Liam, but finds that his destiny is no where near his best bud.Finally, if you rent or buy this film, watch it with the captions on. The thick Scottish accent almost makes this film a foreign language contender. Still, it's a brilliant film that demands you to watch. It may last only 108 minutes, but you'll be thinking about it long after the credits have rolled.",4,The Destiny of Souls,1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,2645,"['Cold', 'depressing', 'realistic', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'bitter', 'tale', 'cycle', 'unbroken', 'Can', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'poor', 'ever', 'achieve', 'goal', 'shattering', 'progression', 'Are', 'destined', 'be', 'what', 'are', 'can', 'family', 'history', 'past', 'be', 'left', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'reminded', 'often', 'how', 'people', 'may', 'change', 'situations', 'remain', 'same', 'Liam', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'handsome', 'athletic', 'very', 'natural', 'Martin', 'Compston', 'destiny', 'sister', 'better', 'life', 'Chantelle', 'Liam', 'willing', 'sell', 'soul', 'get', 'Chantelle', 'studies', 'hard', 'school', 'bring', 'up', 'adorable', 'son', 'Calum', 'Liam', 'will', 'risk', 'own', 'life', 'make', 'imprisoned', 'mothers', 'life', 'better', 'when', 'out', 'few', 'months', 'day', 'sweet', '16', 'Birthday', 'reality', 'sets', 'when', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'get', 'life', 'willing', 'do', 'slowly', 'killing', 'soul.The', 'films', 'coldness', 'sun', 'never', 'seen', 'Liam', 'life', 'many', 'Glasgow', 'really', 'could', 'be', 'town', 'country', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'laser', 'point', 'accuracy', 'only', 'way', 'move', 'sell', 'what', 'little', 'humanity', 'have', 'left', 'Liam', 'sister', 'true', 'way', 'succeed', 'not', 'Liam', 'sister', 'nephew', 'mom', 'Chantelle', 'disappointed', 'Liam', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'forest', 'trees.And', 'so', 'many', 'too', 'late', 'maybe', 'sister', 'right', 'Maybe', 'bitterness', 'mother', 'justified', 'Jean', 'going', 'back', 'hateful', 'boyfriend', 'Stan', 'maybe', 'away', 'hell', 'born', 'into.The', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'led', 'Compston', 'Liam', 'Annmarie', 'Fulton', 'sister', 'who', 'must', 'protect', 'son', 'brother', 'feels', 'losing', 'Michelle', 'Coulter', 'mother', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'COPS', 'who', 'return', 'one', 'place', 'perhaps', 'worse', 'place', 'be', 'Gary', 'McCormack', 'typical', 'villain', 'sorts', 'Stan', 'filled', 'so', 'much', 'hate', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Liam', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'William', 'Ruane', 'out', 'Liam', 'best', 'friend', 'Pinball', 'too', 'lost', 'soul', 'short', 'end', 'stick', 'be', 'Liam', 'destiny', 'where', 'best', 'bud.Finally', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'watch', 'captions', 'thick', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'almost', 'film', 'foreign', 'language', 'contender', 'Still', 'brilliant', 'film', 'watch', 'may', 'last', 'only', '108', 'minutes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'thinking', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled']",N/A

It revolved around the life of a boy who loved his mother immensely and who would do anything just to bring the family back together once again.  The mother was in jail for a crime that she didn't commit.  The father was a small-time drug-dealer and she took the fall for him.  The son hated the father for what he did to his mother.  As he was brought up in a social estate housing, he was forced to grow up very quickly and street-smart too.  He had a best friend that was also his partner in crime selling cheap cigarettes.  Suddenly, he had a bright idea of getting his mother an after-prison gift and he concocted a business strategy of selling drugs, drugs he actually stole from his estranged father.  As his ambition got wider, he started to tread on the toes of established drug-dealer.  Subsequently, it spiralled out of control.  In the end, we would come to understand the poignant meaning of sweet sixteen.  The movie touched on the inability of running away from the vicious cycle, family violence and early parenting.

Committed to raising the 6000 pounds to buy a caravan for his mother, once she gets out of prison, he and a car-thieving friend ramp up their entrepreneurial efforts from flogging contraband cigarettes to punters at the local pub to something that pays more - drug dealing - all of which gets them involved with some thugs who have other plans for them. Ken Loach gives us his usual slice-of-life view of working-class struggles to just make a go of it, this time at a place where the best hope for a paying job is manning the phones at a call center.Martin Compston as the young Liam is wonderful, and so is his red-headed colleague and partner in crime, Pinball, played by William Ruane. Together they represent a generation abandoned by parents and left to drift in a world without sanctuary. While the arc of the story is from youthful aspirations to crushing disillusionment, Loach says in his director's commentary that we are meant to see the ending as hopeful. Liam and his sister, who looks after him and her own young son, have the kind of resilience and determination, Loach says, to keep to a road that will lead them eventually to independence from their unpromising beginnings. It's a stretch, but you cling to that hope because you've come to care so much about these very real characters.The performances in the film are captivating, and the kinetic camera work and editing are appropriate for the range of feelings aroused in its young protagonists, from playfulness to terror, rage, and sorrow.

Sweet Sixteen is refreshing change, then, as a very in-depth look at the situation of one young Scotsman.There is a romantic idea about Great Britan, at least in my circles, that posits some sort of dreamworld in which the peoples of the Isles are living happily ever after.  Various films spotlighting the Ireland of today have, in recent years, discredited such ideas.  Nonetheless, what is Scotland but sheep and kilts and idyllic castle scenes?  It is a place much like the one in which Americans live as well.  Young Liam, the protagonist of Sweet Sixteen, is trying to put his really messed up family back together.  To do so, he chooses to accept a life of crime to secure the funds necessary to buy his small family's independence from his horrid grandfather and his mother's boyfriend.Crime doesn't pay after all, for Liam, however.  Through his struggles to find an equilibrium at the expense of others, he tarnishes his noble Scots soul with petty theft, brawls, drug-dealing, and even an attempted murder.  It becomes very difficult to sympathize with the likable young  man who catches our attention at the beginning of the film.  Sadly, our look at Liam does not leave him in a state any happier than he was when we found him.  It is not a new idea or theme that is introduced in Sweet Sixteen, but the moral is one which America seems to often forget: the youth are noble and will do nobly if we give them the opporutunity.  Liam was not given the opportunity, left to the care of two abusive men who provided a predilection to crime.  The world shamefully failed Liam, though his responsibility was not ingnored in the film.Sweet Sixteen offers the Western world a chance to reconsider the way we raise children, operate social services, and the frequency and ease of divorce.",4,Striking Look At Scotland,1067385600,"10 29, 2003",2003,1943,"['Many', 'films', 'available', 'Western', 'markets', 'regarding', 'culture', 'customs', 'struggles', 'British', 'peoples', 'leave', 'Scotland', 'quite', 'picture', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'refreshing', 'change', 'then', 'very', 'in-depth', 'look', 'situation', 'one', 'young', 'Scotsman.There', 'romantic', 'idea', 'Great', 'Britan', 'least', 'circles', 'sort', 'dreamworld', 'peoples', 'Isles', 'are', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'Various', 'films', 'spotlighting', 'Ireland', 'today', 'have', 'recent', 'years', 'discredited', 'such', 'ideas', 'Nonetheless', 'what', 'Scotland', 'sheep', 'kilts', 'idyllic', 'castle', 'scenes', 'place', 'much', 'one', 'Americans', 'live', 'as', 'well', 'Young', 'Liam', 'protagonist', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'trying', 'put', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'do', 'so', 'accept', 'life', 'crime', 'secure', 'funds', 'necessary', 'buy', 'small', 'family', 'independence', 'horrid', 'grandfather', 'mother', 'boyfriend.Crime', ""n't"", 'pay', 'Liam', 'however', 'struggles', 'find', 'equilibrium', 'expense', 'others', 'noble', 'Scots', 'soul', 'petty', 'theft', 'brawls', 'drug-dealing', 'even', 'attempted', 'murder', 'very', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'likable', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'attention', 'beginning', 'film', 'Sadly', 'look', 'Liam', 'not', 'leave', 'state', 'happier', 'was', 'when', 'found', 'not', 'new', 'idea', 'theme', 'introduced', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'moral', 'one', 'America', 'often', 'forget', 'youth', 'are', 'noble', 'will', 'do', 'nobly', 'give', 'opporutunity', 'Liam', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'opportunity', 'left', 'care', 'two', 'abusive', 'men', 'who', 'provided', 'predilection', 'crime', 'world', 'shamefully', 'failed', 'Liam', 'responsibility', 'was', 'not', 'ingnored', 'film.Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'Western', 'world', 'chance', 'reconsider', 'way', 'raise', 'children', 'operate', 'social', 'services', 'frequency', 'ease', 'divorce']",N/A

772734,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0000C2IQP,Wheelchair Assassin,"[13, 14]","Despite its title, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; is one decidedly sour film.  This movie isn't based on an Irvine Welsh novel, but with its gritty examination of tough Scottish street life, it might as well be.  The movie centers around a fatherless high-school dropout who expects his family to become whole again when his mother finally gets out of prison.  In the role of the teenaged protagonist Liam, Martin Compston turns in a brilliant performance that belies his youth.  In the opening scene, we see what kind of situation Liam is dealing with: going to visit his mother in prison, her slimy father and her even slimier boyfriend Stan want Liam to pass her drugs to hook up her fellow inmates so that Stan can make a killing off their boyfriends.  And when Liam refuses to do it, he winds up getting the hell beaten out of him by the side of the road.  This is obviously a kid who's had the odds stacked against him from the beginning.Through Liam's story, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; makes the rather depressing point that street life can claim even the best-intentioned among us.  What makes the movie work is the ambiguity that Compston brings to his character, aided by a first-class script and some very dreary cinematography.  Liam is neither a hero nor a villain; he's just a kid doing his best to live a normal life amid highly unenviable circumstances.  And he'll do anything to achieve that normal life, even if it means selling heroin to afford a trailer for himself and his family.  Of course, it should be obvious to most that drug-dealing is not the best path to normalcy and stability, but Liam's misguided nature is the very quality that makes him such a tragic and sympathetic figure.Throughout the movie, Liam paves the way to hell with his good intentions, as his naivete constantly puts him in over his head.  He continually invests his time and money trying to provide for his mother and keep her away from Stan, even as it becomes increasingly apparent that she's a lost cause.  He sticks by his best friend Pinball even as Pinball's dim wit threatens them both.  Meanwhile, he alienates his sister Chantelle, who's the only person around him he can actually trust.  You can't help but root for Liam, even as you're slapping your forehead at some of the things he does.  He wants to be better than the likes of Stan and his grandfather, but he doesn't even know how.Although it does have its moments of humor, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; is mostly a down note right until the bitter end.  There's a sense of foreboding througout the film, as you can just tell that Liam is going to screw up in a big way.  Still, if you're not averse to a little depression, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
