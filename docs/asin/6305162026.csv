Although it's an interesting picture, the whole of the movie couldn't be held together for some reasons. I wasn't convinced about the desire of Daryl, played by Michael Keaton, for the girl. Neither was I convinced if Daryl was really addicted to drugs. The boyfriend of the girl was incredibly stoic and one-dimensional. A couple of twists in Clean and Sober elevates the film slightly, and then, it is a long winding down. The film just had to have everything in place in order for Clean and Sober to be a success, but it was too superficial for me.

451887,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,6305162026,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[0, 0]","And I got this thing for Michael Keaton and I also have a thing for self destructive characters so maybe this review might be a little impartial.This is one of Michael Keaton's finest films. There are a litany of films about drug addiction and substance abuse and although most of them can be depressing this one left me quite invigorated and refreshed. Without exaggerating, I felt reborn again.Daryl Poynter (Michael Keaton) is a Philadelphia real estate salesman who is on a path to self destruction. His driven but self absorbed personality exposes what lies beneath, which is an acute addiction to cocaine. That is the least of his worries when he wakes up next to a dead woman who apparently over dosed on cocaine and suffered a major heart attack the night before. Daryl has been subsidizing his addiction by embezzling money from an escrow account. He also used these funds to play the stock market which doesn't quite pan out the way he planned. In short, he burns through almost $92,000. Now, the police are involved and make it clear that they know Daryl is responsible for the woman's heart attack.As a result, he checks himself into a drug rehabilitation program to lay low and remain completely anonymous. This is where he meets a tough counselor, Craig (Morgan Freedman). He also meets and falls in love with another fellow patient in the program who goes by the name of Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker).The acting all around is superb. Michael Keaton is captivating and convincing as a salesman completely on the brink of collapse. We observe how ignorant he is of his apparent drug addiction. His immediate problems are only the result of a larger and deeper problem, denial and self absorption. It's very easy to identify with Daryl and like him too because there is something inherently good and wholesome about him. His deep emotional struggles are brought to surface through his counselor Craig and his sponsor Richard Dirks (Michael Emmet Walsh) He is rehabilitated and he is lured into temptation but it is the chip that leaves the viewer hopeful, invigorated, and emotionally touched. Despite Daryl's behavior, one cannot help but to route for him during the film's entirety.And so I got this chip, and this chip belongs to Michael Keaton for making a believable film about the perils and consequences of a drug addiction.",5,"""And I got this Chip""",1368230400,"05 11, 2013",2013,2344,"['got', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'also', 'have', 'thing', 'self', 'destructive', 'characters', 'so', 'maybe', 'review', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'impartial.This', 'one', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'finest', 'films', 'are', 'litany', 'films', 'drug', 'addiction', 'substance', 'abuse', 'most', 'can', 'be', 'depressing', 'one', 'left', 'quite', 'invigorated', 'refreshed', 'exaggerating', 'felt', 'reborn', 'again.Daryl', 'Poynter', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Philadelphia', 'real', 'estate', 'salesman', 'who', 'path', 'self', 'destruction', 'driven', 'absorbed', 'personality', 'what', 'beneath', 'acute', 'addiction', 'cocaine', 'least', 'worries', 'when', 'up', 'next', 'dead', 'woman', 'who', 'apparently', 'dosed', 'cocaine', 'suffered', 'major', 'heart', 'attack', 'night', 'Daryl', 'been', 'subsidizing', 'addiction', 'embezzling', 'money', 'escrow', 'account', 'also', 'used', 'funds', 'play', 'stock', 'market', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pan', 'out', 'way', 'planned', 'short', 'almost', '92,000', 'Now', 'police', 'are', 'involved', 'make', 'clear', 'know', 'Daryl', 'responsible', 'woman', 'heart', 'result', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'program', 'lay', 'low', 'remain', 'completely', 'anonymous', 'where', 'tough', 'counselor', 'Craig', 'Morgan', 'Freedman', 'also', 'love', 'fellow', 'patient', 'program', 'who', 'name', 'Charlie', 'Standers', 'Kathy', 'Baker', '.The', 'acting', 'around', 'superb', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'captivating', 'convincing', 'salesman', 'completely', 'brink', 'collapse', 'observe', 'how', 'ignorant', 'apparent', 'drug', 'addiction', 'immediate', 'problems', 'are', 'only', 'result', 'larger', 'deeper', 'problem', 'denial', 'self', 'absorption', 'very', 'easy', 'identify', 'Daryl', 'too', 'something', 'inherently', 'good', 'wholesome', 'deep', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'are', 'brought', 'surface', 'counselor', 'Craig', 'sponsor', 'Richard', 'Dirks', 'Michael', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'rehabilitated', 'lured', 'temptation', 'chip', 'viewer', 'hopeful', 'invigorated', 'emotionally', 'touched', 'Daryl', 'behavior', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'route', 'film', 'entirety.And', 'so', 'got', 'chip', 'chip', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'making', 'believable', 'film', 'perils', 'consequences', 'drug', 'addiction']",Clean & Sober

Walk in his shoes as he tries to escape life's troubles by hiding out in rehab, which we see with celebs today is all too common, only for Keaton's character to find out that it may be just the place he needed to go, to really sort out who he is and how he got there.

Most people today know Keaton as someone who does dramatic films, not remembering he always did comedies and standup.  He did Mr. Mom,  Beetlejuice, the Dream Team, Night Shift, etc.  Taken in light of this,  Clean and Sober is a very depressing film, and one of the better films to  handle the often overly-used storyline on drug addiction.  I was stunned at  Keaton's acting ability in this film.  You genuinely hated him, but  throughout the film, you learn to accept him and give him the thumbs up as  he tries to build his life back together.  Not a family flick, nor a  rousing &quot;I'm glad I'm alive&quot; film.  It's a dark and realistic  film.  And, hey, it's got Morgan Freeman in a stellar supporting role, too.

451898,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,6305162026,Pork Chop,"[4, 4]","CLEAN AND SOBER, starring MICHAEL KEATON (MK), MORGAN FREEMAN, KATHY BAKER, is a movie that will potentially raise as many questions as the answers that is gives out, considering that it touches upon the subjects of narcotics addiction, alcoholism, and the disorder and chaos that is felt in many people's personal lives.Not knowing MK personally, the work suggests an almost invisible line between the character that is played by MK in the film, and MK himself, as an actor, such is the realistic feel  of the flow of events.The story starts out with MK snorting cocaine with the daughter of a client, from whom heembezzles $92,000 to speculate on the stock market with high risk derivatives and options, albeit only being a realtor or real estate agent. This puts his job in jeopardy at his employer, obviously, and the substance abuse is coupled with alcoholism, temper tantrums,deafness in aspects of social skills with those surrounding him, the loss of control overhis over destiny and the annhiliation of his own reputation, that is actually crucialfor any salesperson to survive in a highly competitive field, where trust is paramountwith the clients, before any deal can close successfully.The value of this work, is not the cinematography (merely TV box-sized release), as the colors seem to lack luster, or  the  bland and unimaginative music.  Rather, the uniqueness of the film, is the attempt to educate the viewer in how a de-tox program unfolds.The program begins with a  48 hour cold turkey cessation of substances, often in bed. The withdrawal symptoms (vomiting, cold sweats) disappear between 2 to 5 days later, at which point the coordinator (played by Morgan Freeman) urges participants to exert an intense athletics and exercise program (pushups, etc) so as to help the mind focus on the desired end and tasks at hand.The next phase, is a sequence of town hall meetings, to naturally satisfy the natural impulse of participants to discuss their lives, what led up to their addiction in drugs and alcohol,and to hear others do the same, taking and learning while they go along.Next, a so-called ""Family Room"" is occupied, apparently signaling that a  psychologicalintimacy has been achieved, and a total honesty among all heretofore, with a continuation of physical activity, exercise which turns into ""probations"" under which, the individualsare allowed to communicate with the outside world for the first time since they started (the phone, and travel from the detox center being isolated since day 1.)Morgan's character is well trained in reading people's faces in terms of whether they are being totally honest and upfront about how clean they are and to what degree they've adhered to the program thus far, and actually kicks out several people for not sticking with it,or lying about deviation from the process. Eventually, a graduation is held, that is appropriately celebrated with music and dance.The film shows that the completion of the detox, is not a destination, or an end in itself, but a fresh starting point, or motivator to being sorting out the anarchy, or disorder that is present in each of the participant's personal and professional lives. For some, as with MK's character, this is easier said than done, as was the case with cleaning his own addiction, as he's admittedly become dependent on a married woman for his own romanticimpulses, herself struggling with a husband with a substance problem and a shaky marriage.The lesson to be drawn is difficult to discern. Are financially troubled people, with bruised ego's and low self-esteem from professional and / or personal success more susceptible and prone to substance abuse and alcoholism? Or does addiction occur more frequently among those suffering from OCS (obsessive compulsive disorder) for example, as MK's character seems to show ? Do the problems relate to a biological inability to happily grow older as the years pass? Kathy Baker's and MK seem to revert to a teenage romance with its corresponding joy despite their actual ages, with a nostalgic trip in time to the JFK years of 1962 hit songs.At the end of the day, there is only so much that any given individual can expect, whether before or after the detox program, from friends, family, employer, which is that nobody wants to pull the weight of another person who refuses to do so.  Life isn't perfect, but one cannot give up on life under the excuse of those imperfections ( not being well connected,  others are allowed to get away with financial schemes, etc.)A questionable decision, in the editing room, was exposing several times the behinds of several actors, messy arm pits, and long dialogs in the urinal while taking samples.The most remarkable is the finding of a sponsor, during the detox program, who is the addict's  personal life-line to curing their problem, and clearing the way to a more probable successful outcome, by carrying out emotional discussions, flushing pills, hard liquor and substances down the toilet, etc.Be advised that a  healthy liver weighs only 3.5 lbs, and can grow to weigh 4 times heavier when abused.",3,Serious topic affecting 70

451899,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305162026,Reviewer,"[79, 82]","One of the toughest things about drug and alcohol addiction is owning up to the fact of that addiction; being able to say, ""I'm an addict.""  Because until that happens, the addiction will continue and the prospect of getting any help will lessen with each passing day.  And the important thing is getting that help before it's too late, regardless of how it comes about.  It's being able to recognize the opportunity and having the gumption to take advantage of it, which is what happens to a young man on the brink of disaster in ""Clean and Sober,"" directed by Glenn Gordon Caron.  Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a high power real estate broker with a couple of problems:  He's appropriated some $90,000 from an escrow account to play the stock market (which quickly took a nose-dive on him, leaving him about $52,000 short), but that's not even his biggest problem; his biggest problem is that he's a cocaine addict, as well as an alcoholic-- and he doesn't even know it.  All he knows is that his life is in turmoil and he can't fathom why.  And when a girl picks up at a mall ODs in his bed one morning, his life really begins to fall apart.  He needs some time to sort things out and he needs to get away-- to hide for awhile-- and he comes up with a brilliant idea; he'll hide out in a rehab center where they guarantee anonymity and confidentiality.He checks in, and it works.  Nobody knows where he is, and the rules of the house prevent him from having any contact with the outside world.  But Daryl-- a born hustler-- has hustled himself into a corner this time.  Because he can't stay in if he doesn't play the game, which precipitates taking a long, hard look at himself.  So for the first time in his life he gets caught up in his own scam; and it just may be his salvation.  But before he can come back, he's going to have to hit rock bottom first, which he does-- in a pivotal scene involving a phone call to his mother.  And it's only when he's faced with total collapse that he finally begins to look inward, and to take stock of how he measures up against the others he meets at the facility; when he starts to realize that he's not the only person on the planet.Working from a tightly written screenplay by Tod Carroll, director Caron delivers a hard-hitting film that takes an uncompromising look at the effects of addiction, without relying or dwelling upon the physical aspects of the problem to illustrate the depths of despair to which it can lead.  To be sure, Daryl looks strung out; but that aside, the story relentlessly chronicles how swiftly drugs and alcohol can wreck a life in all regards.  It's a powerful statement, unflinchingly delivered in a concise and straightforward manner.  Caron approaches the subject head-on, avoiding any melodramatics while keeping it grounded in reality, which enhances the impact of the drama as it plays out.  And it clearly demonstrates how far-reaching the problem is, in that it touches so many others-- friends and family-- any and all who come into contact with Daryl.  It gives a personal perspective on the issue that is even more pronounced, in fact, than that of Sandra Bullock's ""28 Days"" or the more recent ""Blow,"" and is more emotionally involving as well, on the level of Steven Soderbergh's affecting drama, ""Traffic.""  This is an Oscar-worthy film on any number of levels, but 1988 was the year of ""Rain Man,"" and the Academy was clearly looking in another direction, leaving this film without even a nomination.  And it's a shame.As Daryl, Michael Keaton gives a performance that had Oscar written all over it; that he failed to receive even a nomination for his work here is a travesty, as this is without question the best he's ever done and on a par with any of the best of that year, including Hoffman's Oscar-winner.  Whenever an actor can disappear within a character so completely-- as Keaton does here-- it speaks volumes about the performance and the believability of that character; and there's no sign of Keaton when Daryl is on screen.  Keaton has a very definitive persona, but as you watch Daryl, there's not so much as a fleeting glimpse of Billy Blaze in ""Night Shift,"" Carter Hayes in ""Pacific Heights,"" Jack in ""Mr. Mom,"" or even ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Batman.""  With Daryl, Keaton has created a unique character, so real and presented with such intensity, that even a passing thought that this is an actor playing a role is impossible.  And that's a performance that deserves much more than a passing nod of acknowledgement.Also turning in an extremely affecting performance is Kathy Baker, as Charlie Standers, a fellow addict Daryl meets in rehab.  Baker has an alluring quality that works perfectly for the blue-collar character of Charlie, whose vulnerability quickly gains the sympathy of the audience and helps to draw you into the story emotionally.  There's an obvious softness beneath Charlie's rough-hewn exterior that is becoming, a down-to-earth aspect of the character that Baker conveys quite nicely.  This is a very real person she puts up on the screen, and it's easy to believe that she operates a crane in a steel mill, because there's nothing in the way Charlie is presented that is false or pretentious.  It's a solid performance, and one of the strengths of the film.The supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, who gives an understated, impressive performance as Craig, Daryl's counselor; Claudia Christian (Iris); M. Emmet Walsh (Richard), Tate Donovan (Donald), Brian Benben (Martin) and Henry Judd Baker (Xavier).  A realistic examination of a problem that affects virtually everyone either directly or indirectly, ""Clean and Sober"" is a sobering film that, while at times is emotionally draining, is nevertheless a worthwhile and entirely satisfying experience.",5,"Sobering, Thought-Provoking Film",1008288000,"12 14, 2001",2001,5792,"['One', 'toughest', 'things', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'owning', 'up',

451901,A1ZNVCLWAR2SJM,6305162026,Sabine,"[4, 33]","As it seems I contradict most of the reviews so far. I read some of them before I bought this DVD and I was completely disappointed. I usually do like movies about everyday people with everyday problems who could be your neighbors. (Instead of the alien, murder and life-is-so-funny type of movies). The plus about the movie is that the actors are really great - that is true. But the plot is completly dumb if not obvios. Keatons character is supposed to be an addict who gets into a clinic more by accident then by purpose and then the miracle happens and he becomes clean and sober. This movie suffers from a severe absence of stoned people, drugs (except for cigarrets) and all the downs of  addicts.  The main character (sorry, forgot name) does not seem to have any liquor frieds, no dealer except for one Spencer who is never available and so he does rarely struggle to stay clean. Instead he starts a love affair (or at least tries to). This movie has excactly one message: you have to admit to yourself that you are an addict before anyone or anything can help you.  This DVD is probably useful as a present for an alcoholic whom you want to see that he can get out of this if only he would see he has a problem, but you dont dare talking to him because he might immediadly agree and give you all his liquor instead.

I've attended many AA and NA meetings myself, and the portrayal here is somewhat cliched and not  completely accurate.  I've also been through several treatments, and the  portrayal here is also &quot;off&quot; somehow.  Modern treatment centers  don't really operate in the way things are portrayed here.  If you want to  know what most AA meetings are really like, find an &quot;open&quot;  meeting in your area and attend it.  However, this movie was entertaining  and the performances are good.  It was a bit over-long, and there was too  much focus on the romance between Keaton and Baker.  More realism, less  sentimentality and a little more cutting-room time, and this movie could  have been better.

Despite the depressing nature of addiction, Keaton (and the screenwriter and director) play it with a certain amount of sardonic humor which contrasts nicely with the pathetic life Keaton is living.  The Keaton character finds that he can no longer avoid the consequences of his behavior and just quitting the dope and booze doesn't guarantee a smooth return to a good life.

I just finished watching Clean and Sober and I am giving it FIVE stars only because, I am unable to give it fifty.  Clean and Sober was everything DRUNKS was NOT!  Clean and sober had a nice tight script that made you follow really close to keep up.Clean and sober taught me more than a few things about drunks and druggies.  The prices on Drunks and Clean and Sober should be switched. Drunks is no where near good as Clean and Sober yet Drunks cost's a bit more. I would have gladly forked over 3 times the $7 price for Clean and Sober compared to the $21.99 for Drunks that was not worth its prenium price.  Both are fine movies but Clean and Sober was just so much better.Clean and Sober made me think.  Clean and Sober was an emotional roller coaster.  I started out hating the main character in the movie. He started out a mean self absorbed trite nasty worthless no-account of the first order.  As the DVD progressed to the middle point he was no better.  The supporting actors in the movie were awesome, lending a sense of beleivability to the movie I liked.  Everybody seemed to have mastered those seedy loathesome scamming natures druggies and drunks have when they are seconds away from hitting rock bottom.Slowly almost impreceptablyI started liking the main character.  I started thinking awe sweet he is going to hook up with his nice lady friend and then her beast of a boyfriend returns.  Then she leaves her boyfriend's house supposedly to get a pack of smokes and I figured she was heading back to see the main character mushy ending lots of kissing and gurgling noises as the credits rolled.  I won't tell you what happened but I was wrong again big time.  The ending rather shocked me and by the time the credits rolled, I was almost holding back tears. Vile thing was by the time the movie ended I honestly liked the title character.I have never been a dope addict or alcoholic but I learned something from both Drunks and Clean and Sober.  I learned you can't really help a dope addict because, the help they need comes from within themselves.  Once an alcohohic or druggie starts cleaning up their lives and picking up the peices.  I learned you can give people in recovery opportunities but only once they have shown the commitment needed to rebuild their lives.  The hardest thing in the world is to stand by and watch some one you love fall into drugs or booze knowing the only one who can pull them out of that early grave is themselves.  Thats why I buy movies, because I learn things better when I can see them play out in front of me.This movie left me with a great Joy and sorrow but, the funniest thing is I only really remember the joy.  As Clean and Sober and drunks teach addicted people make their own choices and their ain't a damn thing all the love in the world can do about it.  This is one of my A List Movies.  One last funny thing I almost did not buy this movie.  I only ended up buying it because, I needed like 4 bucks to hit the $25 minimum required to get Free super saver shipping so I tossed it in.  After seeing it I can not imagine my huge DVD collection without Clean and Sober in it.Clean and Sober I think is a must have DVD.",5,I Liked Drunks But I LOVED!
