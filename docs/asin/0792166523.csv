132643,A1A4DEENGHK51T,0792166523,Alan Attebery,"[3, 4]","The two previous ""Naked Gun"" movies were two of the funniest slapstick comedy movies ever made. On the outside, there was no reason to think that this third installment would be any different. Unfortunately, it was.Through much of the movie, you get the feeling the writers were having to reach for some of the gags. Many of the jokes and sight gags this time around felt forced and contrived, whereas in the previous two movies they just flowed right on through. This is not to say that the movie isn't a laugh riot, you just won't laugh as hard this time.Leslie Nielsen is back as Lt. Frank Drebin, who is now retired and married to Jane (Priscilla Presley). Home life doesn't really suit this bumbling detective. A visit from his old Police Squad buddies gets Frank back into the game, which causes Jane to leave him and go off on a ""Thelma and Louise"" trip.Although this movie was meant to be the last ""Naked Gun"" when it was made in 1994, it's fate was sealed the next year when O.J. Simpson was arrested for murder. Though never a major star in any of the three movies, he was as much a part of them as any of the others.If you are a ""Naked Gun"" fan, then you will want to add this movie to complete your collection. If you have never seen one of these movies before, don't start with this one. It is not as good as the other two and you will be disappointed.",4,The Last Insult,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,1365,"['two', 'previous', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movies', 'were', 'two', 'funniest', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'outside', 'was', 'reason', 'think', 'third', 'installment', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'Unfortunately', 'was.Through', 'much', 'movie', 'get', 'feeling', 'writers', 'were', 'having', 'reach', 'gags', 'Many', 'jokes', 'sight', 'gags', 'time', 'around', 'felt', 'forced', 'contrived', 'whereas', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'just', 'flowed', 'right', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'riot', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'as', 'hard', 'time.Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'back', 'Lt.', 'Frank', 'Drebin', 'who', 'now', 'retired', 'married', 'Jane', 'Priscilla', 'Presley', 'Home', 'life', ""n't"", 'really', 'suit', 'bumbling', 'detective', 'visit', 'old', 'Police', 'Squad', 'Frank', 'back', 'game', 'Jane', 'leave', 'go', 'off', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'last', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'when', 'was', 'made', '1994', 'fate', 'was', 'sealed', 'next', 'year', 'when', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'was', 'arrested', 'murder', 'never', 'major', 'star', 'three', 'movies', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'others.If', 'are', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'fan', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'movie', 'complete', 'collection', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'one', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Naked Gun The Final Insult

The third entry of the series, ""The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - The Final Insult"" was relased three years after the previous installment, ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2 - The Smell Of Fear"", in 1994.This third venture finds bumbling Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) retired from Police Squad and finally married to Jane (Prisicilla Presley). Frank seems to be happily settling into retired life when he is suddenly brought back in by old friends Ed (George Kennedy) and Nordberg (O.J. Simpson, just months before he killed his wife and her lover). They want him to investigate a bomb threat organizd by notorious terroist Rocko Dylan (Fred Ward). He is sent a fertility clinic to find out the address of Rocko's girlfriend Tanya Peters' (Anna Nicole Smith, pre - Trimspa) house. Jane becomes suspicious, and leaves Frank when she learns that he's back on the job. Frank, meanwhile, is assigned to pose as an inmate in the prison where Rocko is at. He becomes friends with Rocko, who lets him on the plan and lets him be apart of it. They spend the night at Tanya's house. Jane also winds upt here and is held hostage. They soon learn that Rocko is planning to blow up the Academy Awards. So Jane and Frank now must sneak in and stop Rocko from destroying the most important annual motion picture event. The result is several celebrity cameos and one uproarious dance number that goes sout thanks To Frank.

132646,A2N84VEBTQFDSU,0792166523,"C.J. Roger ""C.J. Roger""","[4, 6]","I love the Naked Gun series. All 3 movies have a certain charm and wit to them that just isn't matched in other satire series.The first Naked Gun movie is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen hands down. The second was good but for some reason it just never seemed to come into its own. This one is a strange movie in that only one of the original writers (David Zucker) did the script while the other two were just producers this time around. It has parts that are better then the second one but other parts that just aren't funny as they want to be. It's a strange movie in that you will find parts that were well done and creative but then you will see things that are just stretching and well to put it plainly, just not funny.The story continues right where the second left us. Frank Dreben and Jane finally tie the knot and settle down to become a family. Dreben has to give up his police job as he promised. Of course things aren't as easy as that, the couple seems to be having some marital problems as Jane wants a kid and for some reason Frank just can't make it happen. To make matters worse Ed and Nordburg need Frank to come back for one more mission and when Jane finds out she leaves him. Dreben winds up going into prison undercover to find out the plans of the would be terrorist who wants to target the Oscars with a bomb that will go off once the evelope is opened revealing the best actor.The opening and ending sequences are the best part of the movie. We have an Untouchables spoof at the start which was quite amusing and in classic Naked Gun humor and we have the whole situation at the Oscars that will remind you a bit of the baseball sequence at the end of the first movie. This alone ranks this better then the second movie but its everything in between that slows the movie down and makes it a little boring at times. Frank in Jail, Jane running away in a Thelma and Louise type spoof, a visit to the sperm hospital.. all fill up the middle and while they have their slight chuckles they are no where near the humor and wit and non stop laughs that we had previously. The second one still seemed to flow correctly within the series, popping out situations and running gags that were constant. This one just seems to be missing that extra umph to put it over the top.The movie is fun and enjoyable though and a worthy addition to the Naked Gun series. Leslie Nielson still has it and probably always will. He plays his character flawlessly and as you would expect. There are a lot of cameos in this one like Weird Al and Vanna White and Mary Lou to name a few that make for some interesting moments. The rest of the cast from the previous are intact except there is no mayor or commish this time to call the shots.When I first saw the movie in theaters I didn't laugh as much as I should have but after seeing it again on DVD I found myself laughing at things that probably were just over my head when I saw it 10 years ago.Bottom line, Its not as good as the first and has its moments with being on the same level as 2 1/2 but overall its a great way to end a great series and I do recommend this to everyone, but I would also say buy the other two as well to get the full flavor. This on its own just won't work as well if you have not seen the others to reference to and get the complete picture of how this series works. This definitely could have been better and perhaps if the original 3 writers did it it would have been but its still quite amusing at points and gets a big A for effort.",3,Dreben is back again to save the day..,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,3538,"['love', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', '3', 'movies', 'have', 'certain', 'charm', 'wit', 'just', ""n't"", 'matched', 'other', 'satire', 'series.The', 'first', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'movie', 'probably', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'hands', 'down', 'second', 'was', 'good', 'reason', 'just', 'never', 'seemed', 'come', 'own', 'one', 'strange', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'original', 'writers', 'David', 'Zucker', 'did', 'script', 'other', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'producers', 'time', 'around', 'parts', 'are', 'better', 'then', 'second', 'one', 'other', 'parts', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'want', 'be', 'strange', 'movie', 'will', 'find', 'parts', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'creative', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'stretching', 'well', 'put', 'plainly', 'just', 'not', 'funny.The', 'story', 'right', 'where', 'second', 'left', 'Frank', 'Dreben', 'Jane', 'finally', 'tie', 'knot', 'settle', 'down', 'become', 'family', 'Dreben', 'give', 'up', 'police', 'job', 'promised', 'course', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'couple', 'be', 'having', 'marital', 'problems', 'Jane', 'kid', 'reason', 'Frank', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'happen', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Ed', 'Nordburg', 'need', 'Frank', 'come', 'back', 'one', 'more', 'mission', 'when', 'Jane', 'out', 'Dreben', 'up', 'going', 'prison', 'undercover', 'find', 'out', 'plans', 'would', 'be', 'terrorist', 'who', 'target', 'Oscars', 'bomb', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'once', 'evelope', 'opened', 'revealing', 'best', 'actor.The', 'opening', 'ending', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'Untouchables', 'spoof', 'start', 'was', 'quite', 'amusing', 'classic', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'humor', 'have', 'whole', 'situation', 'Oscars', 'will', 'remind', 'bit', 'baseball', 'sequence', 'end', 'first', 'movie', 'alone', 'better', 'then', 'second', 'movie', 'everything', 'movie', 'down', 'little', 'boring', 'times', 'Frank', 'Jail', 'Jane', 'running', 'away', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'type', 'spoof', 'visit', 'sperm', 'hospital..', 'fill', 'up', 'middle', 'have', 'slight', 'chuckles', 'are', 'where', 'humor', 'wit', 'non', 'stop', 'had', 'previously', 'second', 'one', 'still', 'seemed', 'flow', 'correctly', 'series', 'popping', 'out', 'situations', 'running', 'gags', 'were', 'constant', 'one', 'just', 'be', 'missing', 'extra', 'umph', 'put', 'top.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'though', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', 'Leslie', 'Nielson', 'still', 'probably', 'always', 'will', 'character', 'flawlessly', 'would', 'expect', 'are', 'lot', 'cameos', 'one', 'Weird', 'Al', 'Vanna', 'White', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'name', 'few', 'make', 'interesting', 'moments', 'rest', 'cast', 'previous', 'are', 'intact', 'mayor', 'commish', 'time', 'call', 'shots.When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have', 'seeing', 'again', 'DVD', 'found', 'laughing', 'things', 'probably', 'were', 'just', 'head', 'when', 'saw', '10', 'years', 'ago.Bottom', 'line', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'moments', 'being', 'same', 'level', '2', '1/2', 'overall', 'great', 'way', 'end', 'great', 'series', 'do', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'would', 'also', 'say', 'buy', 'other', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'full', 'flavor', 'own', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'others', 'reference', 'get', 'complete', 'picture', 'how', 'series', 'definitely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'perhaps', 'original', '3', 'writers', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'quite', 'amusing', 'points', 'big', 'A', 'effort']",The Naked Gun The Final Insult

This is not a bad film by any means; it's just not as good as its predecessors. The problem with this movie is that of the three it has the most time sensitive gags. Most notably when they go to the Oscars in LA, and the city behind them is on fire. The LA Riots are not a common discussion nearly a decade after the fact, in fact it seems like an event that is all but forgotten. I already had to explain this gag to a 19 year old friend of mine who didn't like the movie because of having to have so many of the time sensitive jokes explained to her. Because of this I must issue the critique that having more special features dedicated to the history surrounding the gags would have been nice. Comedy that pokes fu of something you know about is so much funnier than the comedy that you know nothing about. Never the less, if you are familiar with the history and the culture of that era (essentially if you're my age or older, or only a few years younger) you'll love this movie.

132657,AWAXS66YMHMNW,0792166523,"J. Thomason ""Movie Family""","[0, 1]","The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult Bowling for Movie Score: 184.875 of 300Where here at the Thomason Society for Movie Goodness have sat and pondered what we consider the Ultimate Question... after much time spent eating popcorn and variously flavored candies we came up with the Ultimate Answer - and didn't understand it.  What has this to do with The Naked Gun 33 1/3?  Well nothing really, except this - that ""didn't understand it"" moment started us on an unforeseen journey of further contemplations which resulted in a little something we like to call The Big Brain Flower (brain flower being a term I just invented today to describe a new flowering idea) and Bowling for Movies was born - a simple and easy to interpret score, awarded to movies, and based a super-secret formula created by, well, us - and loosely based on bowling score computational tables.  While movies and bowling only share an ""o"" and ""i"" respectively, the scoring system works the same.  A score of 108 would be a good middle of the movie, not great but good.  A 192 would step that up to a really good movie - one I'd like recommend to friends.  Break 200 and WOWIE ZOWIE, you have a real gem on your hands.  At the time of this writing only two movies have been so stellar they've earned the illustrious honor of bowling a perfect 300 - they're rare and frankly, that's the way it should be.The Naked Gun 33 1/3 - we own the DVD as part of a 3 pack combo with the first two... GREAT value!What's the movie's facts, and just the facts:This final entry in The Naked Gun trilogy of movies which were originally adapted from a failed T.V. show, Police Squad, finds our bumbling police hero finally retired and living out a domesticated life with his special lady friend.  It's not long until he is pressed back into service (which causes a serious hiccup in his marriage) but who else would be able to break up a terrorist plot to blow up The Academy Awards... Frank Drebin to the rescue (or is it send in the rescue FOR Frank Drebin - in The Naked Gun movies, it's often one and the same).We watched these three movies right in a row over the last two days and I have to tell you - the first movie was certainly the best and received a blazing hot score of 217.313, the second movie was still good but felt a little too familiar only earning 171 - it would seem movie makers got the hint and just as advertised (literally), this movie had ""mostly all new jokes"" in addition to a better developed and nearly new script making this movie better than the second.  Personally, I was quite happy since I had vouched for these flicks with Little Miss Movie Dude based on 20 year old memories.  While 33 1/3 certainly shared the same laugh a minute pace of the previous movies - special attention should be paid to the many spoofs including The Untouchables, Thelma and Louise, and Shawshank Redemption (to name a few).What you'll like:*  If you were awake in the 1990's this movie is a great trip down memory lane and I doubt it was intended to be but it's a time capsule of sorts - the gags and spoofs may cause you to add some other once great but forgotten movies in your Amazon cart*  Seriously improved over the last movie the movie comes across smoother, the characters are better developed, and the laughs come easierIf you liked this movie consider these:*  Airplane and Airplane 2: The Sequel - Both good comedies in the same style from the same people (go figure)*  Murder by Death and The Cheap Detective - two great spoof-ish movies which already grace our shelves :]Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

If there's anyone to blame for this not being quite as good as its predecessors, it could be the director Peter Segal.

But Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley are so delightfully hammy and they carry the movie.  Fred Ward and Kathleen Freeman are quite good too as the bomber and his ma.

No matter how silly a scene is there is always a seriousness about the way the jokes are being presented that to me is a  more classy style than acting entirely goofy for 90 minutes or so. For  example, in the hilarious &quot;Sperm Bank&quot; scene in &quot;Naked Gun  33 1/3&quot; Frank(Leslie Nielsen) is told by the woman working at the desk  that Frank would need to take a number. Naturally, Frank asks whether it  has to be between 1 and 10 and she just, I believe, hands him the ticket  with his number. The &quot;Naked Gun&quot; style of comedy is much more  subtle than other comedies like &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;. You  really have to think for a second or two before you bust out laughing in  some of the scenes. I'm a fan of laughing at what people say and do and not  so much a fan of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; type comedy where you  laugh at funny people's expressions and/or body movements instead of funny  writing or circumstances. That style of poker faced comedy that is typical  of &quot;Naked Gun 33 1/3&quot; combined with one-liners like,&quot;Like a  midget at a urinal, I was going to have to stay on my toes,&quot;(And the  title of my review) is what makes for great entertainment. The plot seems  to determine the jokes in &quot;Naked Gun 33 1/3&quot; instead of the jokes  determining the plot.

There is little to distinguish this from the tons of other gag-a-minute spoofs that ape the ZAZ style.  In fact, this wasn't even directed by one of the ZAZ guys- Peter Segal directed from a script co-written by David Zucker.Many spoof-comedies simply send-up specific scenes from other movies.  How many times has the interrogation scene from &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; been parodied?  More than I care to remember.  Early ZAZ classics, including the first Naked Gun, managed to avoid that trap by first crafting a structured screenplay before piling on the gags.  The third Naked Gun film is very far from the early days of ZAZ, and closely resembles the many uninspired spoofs that have killed the sub-genre.The DVD features a nice group commentary (with lots of welcoming skewering of the film from it's creators).",1,Scraping bottom,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,938,"['third', 'film', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'series', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Police', 'Squad', 'quot', 'near', 'complete', 'wash-out', 'little', 'distinguish', 'tons', 'other', 'gag-a-minute', 'spoofs', 'ZAZ', 'style', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'directed', 'one', 'ZAZ', 'guys-', 'Peter', 'Segal', 'directed', 'script', 'co-written', 'David', 'Zucker.Many', 'spoof-comedies', 'simply', 'send-up', 'specific', 'scenes', 'other', 'movies', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'quot', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'quot', 'been', 'parodied', 'More', 'care', 'remember', 'Early', 'ZAZ', 'classics', 'including', 'first', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'managed', 'avoid', 'trap', 'first', 'crafting', 'structured', 'screenplay', 'piling', 'gags', 'third', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'film', 'very', 'far', 'early', 'days', 'ZAZ', 'closely', 'many', 'uninspired', 'spoofs', 'have', 'killed', 'sub-genre.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'group', 'commentary', 'lots', 'welcoming', 'skewering', 'film', 'creators']",The Naked Gun The Final Insult

132672,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,0792166523,Zoe Paris,"[1, 3]","This was my least favorite Naked Gun movie. These were funny when they were hot, the others are still funny. This one however I thought was corny and overdone. The expression ""It jumped the shark"" is usually used when a TV show goes overboard and gets corny and tired. This movie jumped the shark and was indeed the 'final insult' to what was a pretty funny series. There were a few laughs but nothing really earth shattering. Anna Nicole is just an awful actress and looks like a cartoon character. She's ditzy and artificial looking and totally unfunny. The thing with slapstick humor like this is; it's falling-down-funny the first time, can be funny even years later but if it gets over-played it's just like that great song that the radio stations played to death. It's just not the same anymore. I guess the writers thought there can never be too much of a good thing but they were wrong. It wasn't a good thing and it was far too much for me. However, I will always enjoy the other two Naked Gun movies and I really liked Airplane and other similar movies.
