639571,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOBU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","So, I finally got around to seeing this film last weekend.  I must admit, it was far different than I was expecting.  I really expected this to have something to do with aliens or science fiction of some sort because of the name and the hype regarding Woodward's performance.  Talk about walking into something blind.  There is nothing fantastical or supernatural or what-have-you here.  This is just straight, in your face human drama.Joanne Woodward (delivering a knockout performance) plays Beatrice Hunsdorfer, a middle aged widow raising her two daughters in a crummy home in a small town where she is known by her peers as Betty the Loon.  Her daughters are very different.  Matilda is reserved, quiet and seemingly depressed and Ruth is loud and rebellious and prone to seizures.  Throughout the course of the film, Beatrice takes in an elderly woman (she's somewhat of a caretaker as way of work) and fights with her daughters about various things from money to rabbits to school.  When Matilda is selected as one of the finalist in the Science Fair, Beatrice is asked to attend the school.  This is a pivotal moment in the film and one that ties together a lot of loose ends left regarding Beatrice's real feelings towards her daughters and of her life in general.  As a semi-monster of a woman, Beatrice is painted as a non-mother almost, but in the film's climax her mental state and the weariness of her soul is beautifully depicted with staggering results.The entire cast is wonderful, including Woodward's own daughter (who plays Matilda).  I also want to note that Paul Newman directs this film with a restrained sense of awareness.  He really underscores the darkness in every frame and allows his wife (Woodward) to chew the scenery in a way that benefits, not hinders, the film.  Newman had previously directed his wife to an Oscar nomination in `Rachel, Rachel', another softly lit drama that benefited Newman's skill behind the camera.",5,It affects you tremendously...,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1955,"['So', 'finally', 'got', 'seeing', 'film', 'last', 'weekend', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'far', 'different', 'was', 'expecting', 'really', 'expected', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'aliens', 'science', 'fiction', 'sort', 'name', 'hype', 'regarding', 'Woodward', 'performance', 'Talk', 'walking', 'something', 'blind', 'nothing', 'fantastical', 'supernatural', 'what-have-you', 'here', 'just', 'straight', 'face', 'human', 'Woodward', 'delivering', 'knockout', 'performance', 'Beatrice', 'Hunsdorfer', 'middle', 'aged', 'widow', 'raising', 'two', 'daughters', 'crummy', 'home', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'known', 'peers', 'Betty', 'Loon', 'daughters', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Matilda', 'reserved', 'quiet', 'seemingly', 'depressed', 'Ruth', 'loud', 'rebellious', 'prone', 'seizures', 'course', 'film', 'Beatrice', 'elderly', 'woman', 'somewhat', 'caretaker', 'way', 'work', 'fights', 'daughters', 'various', 'things', 'money', 'rabbits', 'school', 'When', 'Matilda', 'selected', 'one', 'finalist', 'Science', 'Fair', 'Beatrice', 'asked', 'attend', 'school', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'film', 'one', 'together', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'left', 'regarding', 'Beatrice', 'real', 'feelings', 'daughters', 'life', 'general', 'semi-monster', 'woman', 'Beatrice', 'painted', 'non-mother', 'almost', 'film', 'climax', 'mental', 'state', 'weariness', 'soul', 'beautifully', 'depicted', 'staggering', 'results.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'including', 'Woodward', 'own', 'daughter', 'who', 'Matilda', 'also', 'want', 'note', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'film', 'restrained', 'sense', 'awareness', 'really', 'darkness', 'frame', 'wife', 'Woodward', 'chew', 'scenery', 'way', 'benefits', 'not', 'hinders', 'film', 'Newman', 'had', 'previously', 'directed', 'wife', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Rachel', 'Rachel', 'softly', 'lit', 'drama', 'benefited', 'Newman', 'skill', 'camera']",N/A
639572,AIE9VQPM8UHPH,B00005JOBU,Arcadia Ranch,"[0, 0]","This has been a favorite movie of mine for many, many years. It's one of those that you never seem to get used to or bored with. It's a quiet, well-acted story about three people, a single mother and her two daughters. By the end of the movie you know them so well you could write their biographies, and you feel the pain of each one so deeply that you can't help shedding a tear. Joanne Woodward turns in a stunning performance as Beatrice Hunsdorfer, a tough, lonely, embittered woman trapped in the lower-middle-class with two daughters in high school and no hope of finding any real happiness. ""Don't you hate the world, Mathilda?"" she mutters at one point to her youngest daughter. She takes her frustrations out on her daughters and Mathilda's pet rabbit yet, in unguarded moments, reveals how much she loves her girls. Oldest daughter Ruth is very much like her mother from hair color to brash behavior to her hunger for friends and social contact. She suffers from occasional terrifying dreams and fits. It is during these moments that you see her mother throwing protecting arms around her and comforting her. As the movie progresses, you see in Ruth the dawning realization that her life will be a repeat of her mother's, and the dread that thought invokes. Mathilda, the younger daughter, is different in almost every way from her mother and sister. From her blond hair to her love of science, she is surely a reflection of the father, never seen, who died years before. She is shy but very intelligent, maintaining a dignified, quiet, unsmiling demeanor all the way through. Her school science project, which involves growing marigold seeds that have been exposed to gamma rays and observing any resulting mutations, wins first place. This is a source of pride for her science teacher, who recognizes her potential, and utter confusion for her mother. In the profoundly moving final scene, Mathilda is sitting alone on a back porch after having been humiliated at the science fair when her mother showed up drunk. She is holding her limp pet rabbit that has been killed by Beatrice during the venting of more frustrations. The movie ends with a voice over as Mathilda is remembering her project and the applause from the audience. Staring up at a starry night, she muses about atoms and how beautifully mysterious they are. Finally, this wondrous, indomitable child answers Beatrice's earlier question. ""No, Mama,"" she thinks to herself, ""I don't hate the world."" The movie's title has a wider meaning as the audience observes the effect of Beatrice's constantly radiating sadness and frustration on her two young marigolds.",5,Lives Revealed,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,2636,"['been', 'favorite', 'movie', 'mine', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'one', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'used', 'bored', 'quiet', 'well-acted', 'story', 'three', 'people', 'single', 'mother', 'two', 'daughters', 'end', 'movie', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'could', 'write', 'biographies', 'feel', 'pain', 'one', 'so', 'deeply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shedding', 'tear', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Beatrice', 'Hunsdorfer', 'tough', 'lonely', 'embittered', 'woman', 'trapped', 'lower-middle-class', 'two', 'daughters', 'high', 'school', 'hope', 'finding', 'real', 'happiness', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'world', 'Mathilda', 'one', 'point', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'frustrations', 'out', 'daughters', 'Mathilda', 'pet', 'rabbit', 'yet', 'unguarded', 'moments', 'how', 'much', 'girls', 'Oldest', 'daughter', 'Ruth', 'very', 'much', 'mother', 'hair', 'color', 'brash', 'behavior', 'hunger', 'friends', 'social', 'contact', 'occasional', 'terrifying', 'dreams', 'fits', 'moments', 'see', 'mother', 'throwing', 'protecting', 'arms', 'comforting', 'movie', 'see', 'Ruth', 'dawning', 'realization', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'repeat', 'mother', 'dread', 'thought', 'invokes', 'Mathilda', 'younger', 'daughter', 'different', 'almost', 'way', 'mother', 'sister', 'blond', 'hair', 'love', 'science', 'surely', 'reflection', 'father', 'never', 'seen', 'who', 'died', 'years', 'shy', 'very', 'intelligent', 'maintaining', 'dignified', 'quiet', 'unsmiling', 'demeanor', 'way', 'school', 'science', 'project', 'growing', 'marigold', 'seeds', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'gamma', 'rays', 'observing', 'resulting', 'mutations', 'wins', 'first', 'place', 'source', 'pride', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'potential', 'utter', 'confusion', 'mother', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'final', 'scene', 'Mathilda', 'sitting', 'alone', 'back', 'porch', 'having', 'been', 'humiliated', 'science', 'fair', 'when', 'mother', 'showed', 'up', 'drunk', 'holding', 'limp', 'pet', 'rabbit', 'been', 'killed', 'Beatrice', 'venting', 'more', 'frustrations', 'movie', 'voice', 'Mathilda', 'remembering', 'project', 'applause', 'audience', 'Staring', 'up', 'starry', 'night', 'atoms', 'how', 'beautifully', 'mysterious', 'are', 'Finally', 'wondrous', 'indomitable', 'child', 'answers', 'Beatrice', 'earlier', 'question', 'No', 'Mama', 'herself', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'world', 'movie', 'title', 'wider', 'meaning', 'audience', 'effect', 'Beatrice', 'constantly', 'radiating', 'sadness', 'frustration', 'two', 'young', 'marigolds']",N/A

Like more recent films such as The Ice Storm, Affliction, and Brokeback Mountain, Marigolds shows ordinary people struggling against problems that are beyond their ability to solve, sometimes winning a little, sometimes losing a little - or a lot. The film is all the more heartbreaking because those who struggle and, perhaps, lose are young people as well as adults. But even in their defeat, they endure, and that in itself is a kind of victory.My VHS copy, taped 20 years ago off cable TV, is about at the end of its useful life.

639574,A1JJM6COMQOO4Y,B00005JOBU,Jeff N,"[2, 2]","Wow.  I did not know that this movie was Not on DVD yet.  I guess I'm lucky that TCM showed it recently, and with very clear sound and picture as usual.  I saw it last night (on the DVR) for the first time in about 30 years or more.  I'm sure that the last time I saw it, about half of it was cut for time, commercials, and content.After seeing all of it, totally uncut, I can see what a Powerful Drama it really is.  It's one of those things that you want to tell people they should see at least once, but at the same time warn them that it is NOT Pretty!!!SPOILER ALERT (SORT OF):Joanne Woodward is absolutely spectacular as a sad, angry, slightly crazy widow and mother of two sweet girls who are being gradually ruined by her extreme negativity.  She just can't get anything right.  For example:  She wants what's best for her girls, and desperately wants to improve their situation, but she tries to keep them home from school all the time, and can't say enough things against the teachers and everything they try to do.Fascinating all the way through (ought to be since it's from a Pulitzer Prize winning Play) - the movie starts out with some really funny lines, hilarious in parts.  The mom and girls have enough to eat.  Everything seems just fine.  And then, very gradually, emotional weights start to pile up on the mom, and she takes her 2 girls and the audience down a rabbit hole of despair, hopelessness, and insanity, from which there seems no escape.This is one of the most realistic looks at an average urban family with a mentally ill parent ever put on film.  It's so well done, that even though you can easily tell it's 1972, you know that everything in the movie could be happening somewhere right now, but hopefully not, because it's a desperately dark situation, although portrayed in a brilliant way.",5,This movie has to be seen at least once.

It is one of my favorites, and this must be out on DVD soon. There is no excuse whatsoever for it to not be out!!! Joanne Woodward shines as Mrs. Beatrice Hunsdorfer, a woman who is unhappy about a lot of things. Her husband dies in a war, and she is on her own to raise her two daughters. She is also unhappy about the issues that the kids are facing: her eldest daughter suffers from epileptic seizures and her younger daughter is growing some marigolds that were exposed to radioactivity. She is obviously unhappy about other things, but this list could go on and on. Mrs. Hunsdorfer has no job outside the home, so her only source of income is taking in elderly people who are sick in her home (which is so filthy from top to bottom). The movie is a drama, but if you ask me, there is also some comedy blended in as well. Any person who loves this movie as well as I do would love to see it come out on DVD. To whoever is out there putting these great films out on DVD: put it in widescreen, make the clarity of the video and audio the way it should be on DVD--sharp and clear (remastered would be excellent!!!); never mind about the special features.

639578,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JOBU,Only-A-Child,"[31, 32]","""This is an adaptation of Paul Zindel's wonderful but tormented play. This play itself is compelling and has a kind of Tennessee Williams flavor; especially ""The Glass Menagerie"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". The adaptation is very successful as the production designer (Gene Callahan) manages to transfer the book's psychologically oppressive ambiance to film; ""shame hangs in the air of this house"" like a cloud of poison gas.Director Paul Newman gets performances from his cast that pull together parallel stories of how a ""strong, strange, and beautiful"" flower can unexpectedly spring from an environmental wasteland. His most difficult task is restraining or masking Joanne Woodward's earthy likability so that we waste little sympathy on her character. But using Woodward as the mother allowed him to get a once-in-a-lifetime performance from their daughter (Nell Potts as Matilda-Tillie in the play). Potts abandoned acting after this movie but her ethereal take on Matilda is right on the money and a big reason why the film works so well.This is really just a story about Matilda's science fair project in which marigold seeds are subjected to varying amounts of gamma ray radiation (the independent variable in her experiment). Those flowers receiving a moderate amount of radiation bloom in amazing and wonderful ways. However, those flowers subjected to additional radiation either have their growth stunted or whither and die.Meanwhile Tillie and her older sister Ruth are living an analogous story with their mother Beatrice in an extremely emotionally abusive household. In the play it is stated that Beatrice is insane but not how or why she became this way. In the movie the viewer soon reaches this same conclusion. Older daughter Ruth (an amazing performance by Eli Wallach's daughter Roberta) maintains a fairly normal lifestyle at school, she is a majorette and popular but is very selfish and demanding of attention. Notably she is also an epileptic, which is subtly significant because it is analogous to receiving an excessive amount of radiation. Tillie is very different (analogous to receiving a moderate amount of radiation), seemingly shy and withdrawn, she is actually very independent and has found an outlet from the family in her science projects. This outlet serves as a protective niche in which she can bloom.A truly great scene is Matilda's acceptance speech at the science fair. She explains the results of her project and really lays out the main theme of the story for the viewer. Watch as she mentions how excessive radiation causes dwarf plants, at that point they cut to a closeup of Ruth in the audience.  Both the experiment and the family illustrate that while a reasonable degree of adversity can actually be beneficial, too much of the same adversity will poison life.While this would be a good film if focused solely on Matilda, it is elevated to extraordinary because Newman chooses to also make Ruth a central part of the story. The conventional ""movie-way"" to tell this story would be to make it an inspirational tale of triumphing over adversity; of free-will overcoming destiny. But fortunately Newman elects to show both sides of the story, in Ruth he shows someone who never has a chance, who cannot recognize her destiny or ever hope to overcome it.Then again, what do I know?

639580,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,B00005JOBU,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[20, 21]","Joanne Woodward starred as Beatrice Hunsdorfer (""Betty the Loon""), a loud, vulgar, gum-chewing, beer-drinking, unattractive middle-aged woman...Living in a dilapidated house in a rundown town, abandoned by her husband, unable to face the responsibility of raising her two teenaged daughters' she is disgusted with life... She covers her despair with sarcasm, outrageous jokes and a tough, insensitive treatment of the girls... But she's also pathetic, as she checks the classified ads for business opportunities, and dreams of opening dignified teashops, even though her house is filled with garbage and she's a frightful mess...The film focuses on the way Beatrice's savage, cynical, often self-deprecating humor and her embittered outlook have affected her daughters. Ruth, the older girl, is a typical adolescent boy-chaser and baton-twirler, who, like Beatrice, employs a tough, sarcastic manner to hide her fears and frustration... Shattered by nightmares and epileptic fits, she sinks hopelessly into defeat...Matilda is shy, sensitive and introverted... Although it seems that she should succumb, she overcomes her environment and emerges strongest... An extremely intelligent science student, Matilda wins a prize for her experiment on mutated flowers that gives the drama its symbolic title; and she becomes a mutant herself--a delicate flower growing out of arid waste...The play is transformed from a lyrical mood-piece into a naturalistic slice-of-life in the tradition of the fifties television drama Newman admires... This makes the symbolism somewhat obtrusive, and the emphasis on external squalor--the filthy house, for example--is overdone and superficial...Newman's attempts to open up the play are largely successful--scenes of Matilda's science teacher explaining the mysteries of the universe, Ruth's accurate imitation of Beatrice in a school skit, and a teenaged mad scientist explaining with sadistic relish how she skinned a cat, are especially memorable...As in ""Sometimes a Great Notion,"" there's a real feeling for family life, although the emphasis is reversed: here it's a world of women in which men play a marginal role... Newman expertly handles the shifts from vigorous burlesque to black humor to terror to pathos... And as before, he uses the camera functionally, bringing it close to his actresses to achieve intimacy and character revelation...Woodward again displays remarkable range... As the shrewish, noisy woman, she's at once horrifying and humorous, but her suggestion of underlying vulnerability arouses our compassion... There's even the familiar inner radiance, indicating a beautiful woman beneath the flamboyance... As Ruth, Roberta Wallach is a perfect amalgam of the tough, shallow teenager and the pathetic, defenseless baby...The standout performance is by Nell Potts, the Newmans' thirteen-year-old, who played Rachel as a child, and here plays a Rachel-like character... As Matilda, she's a model of understatement, with her soft, fragile voice, subtle expressions of nervousness, and luminous blue eyes that, like her father's, seem to be quietly assimilating everything--sometimes disapproving but more often understanding...The film did reconfirm Newman's stature as a director... In his three features he has shown an ability to work with a wide range of material, and if he lacks an original style, he does have a feeling for constructing powerful images and scenes... Above all, he was one of today's finest directors of performers, which has become almost a lost art...",3,This film did reconfirm Newman's stature as a director...,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3533,"['Joanne', 'Woodward', 'starred', 'Beatrice', 'Hunsdorfer', 'Betty', 'Loon', 'loud', 'vulgar', 'gum-chewing', 'beer-drinking', 'unattractive', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'Living', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'rundown', 'town', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'unable', 'face', 'responsibility', 'raising', 'two', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'disgusted', 'life', 'despair', 'sarcasm', 'outrageous', 'jokes', 'tough', 'insensitive', 'treatment', 'girls', 'also', 'pathetic', 'classified', 'ads', 'business', 'opportunities', 'dreams', 'opening', 'dignified', 'teashops', 'even', 'house', 'filled', 'garbage', 'frightful', 'mess', 'film', 'way', 'Beatrice', 'savage', 'cynical', 'often', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'embittered', 'outlook', 'have', 'affected', 'daughters', 'Ruth', 'older', 'girl', 'typical', 'adolescent', 'boy-chaser', 'baton-twirler', 'who', 'Beatrice', 'tough', 'sarcastic', 'manner', 'hide', 'fears', 'frustration', 'Shattered', 'nightmares', 'epileptic', 'fits', 'hopelessly', 'defeat', 'Matilda', 'shy', 'sensitive', 'introverted', 'should', 'succumb', 'environment', 'strongest', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'science', 'student', 'Matilda', 'prize', 'experiment', 'mutated', 'flowers', 'drama', 'symbolic', 'title', 'mutant', 'herself', 'delicate', 'flower', 'growing', 'arid', 'waste', 'play', 'transformed', 'lyrical', 'mood-piece', 'naturalistic', 'slice-of-life', 'tradition', 'fifties', 'television', 'drama', 'Newman', 'symbolism', 'somewhat', 'obtrusive', 'emphasis', 'external', 'squalor', 'filthy', 'house', 'example', 'overdone', 'superficial', 'Newman', 'attempts', 'open', 'up', 'play', 'are', 'largely', 'successful', 'scenes', 'Matilda', 'science', 'teacher', 'explaining', 'mysteries', 'universe', 'Ruth', 'accurate', 'imitation', 'Beatrice', 'school', 'skit', 'teenaged', 'mad', 'scientist', 'explaining', 'sadistic', 'relish', 'how', 'skinned', 'cat', 'are', 'especially', 'memorable', 'Sometimes', 'Great', 'Notion', 'real', 'feeling', 'family', 'life', 'emphasis', 'reversed', 'here', 'world', 'women', 'men', 'play', 'marginal', 'role', 'Newman', 'expertly', 'shifts', 'vigorous', 'burlesque', 'black', 'humor', 'terror', 'pathos', 'before', 'camera', 'functionally', 'bringing', 'close', 'actresses', 'achieve', 'intimacy', 'character', 'revelation', 'Woodward', 'again', 'remarkable', 'range', 'shrewish', 'noisy', 'woman', 'once', 'horrifying', 'humorous', 'suggestion', 'underlying', 'vulnerability', 'compassion', 'even', 'familiar', 'inner', 'radiance', 'indicating', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'flamboyance', 'Ruth', 'Roberta', 'Wallach', 'perfect', 'amalgam', 'tough', 'shallow', 'teenager', 'pathetic', 'defenseless', 'baby', 'standout', 'performance', 'Nell', 'Potts', 'Newmans', 'thirteen-year-old', 'who', 'played', 'Rachel', 'child', 'here', 'Rachel-like', 'character', 'Matilda', 'model', 'understatement', 'soft', 'fragile', 'voice', 'subtle', 'expressions', 'nervousness', 'luminous', 'blue', 'eyes', 'father', 'seem', 'be', 'quietly', 'assimilating', 'everything', 'sometimes', 'disapproving', 'more', 'often', 'understanding', 'film', 'did', 'reconfirm', 'Newman', 'stature', 'director', 'three', 'features', 'shown', 'ability', 'work', 'wide', 'range', 'material', 'original', 'style', 'have', 'feeling', 'constructing', 'powerful', 'images', 'scenes', 'was', 'one', 'today', 'finest', 'directors', 'performers', 'become', 'almost', 'lost', 'art']",N/A

While I came from a comparatively normal family, I could immediately identify with the young science enthusiast Tillie.  In a social world that seems to be without order or reason, a fortunate young person can derive solace from an evolving understanding of natural science.  Coincidentally, I conducted an independent high school biology project similar to Tillie's.  In my case, I studied the effect of ultraviolet radiation on yeast.I loved Nell Newman's presentation of her science project!  What a wonderful description of the wonder of science as seen from a young mind.  I found the comments of other reviewers quite interesting regarding how this soliloquy referenced Tillie's dysfunctional sister and mother.  I hope to see this movie again and look carefully for Paul Newman's direction.  It is also interesting that Nell Newman went to study Human Ecology at Atlantic University and found Newman Organic Foods.",5,A girl finds solace and wisdom in her scientific endeavors,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1036,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'high', 'school', 'came', 'comparatively', 'normal', 'family', 'could', 'immediately', 'identify', 'young', 'science', 'enthusiast', 'Tillie', 'social', 'world', 'be', 'order', 'reason', 'fortunate', 'young', 'person', 'can', 'derive', 'solace', 'evolving', 'understanding', 'natural', 'science', 'Coincidentally', 'conducted', 'independent', 'high', 'school', 'biology', 'project', 'similar', 'Tillie', 'case', 'studied', 'effect', 'ultraviolet', 'radiation', 'yeast.I', 'loved', 'Nell', 'Newman', 'presentation', 'science', 'project', 'What', 'wonderful', 'description', 'wonder', 'science', 'seen', 'young', 'mind', 'found', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'quite', 'interesting', 'regarding', 'how', 'soliloquy', 'referenced', 'Tillie', 'dysfunctional', 'sister', 'mother', 'hope', 'see', 'movie', 'again', 'look', 'carefully', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'direction', 'also', 'interesting', 'Nell', 'Newman', 'went', 'study', 'Human', 'Ecology', 'Atlantic', 'University', 'found', 'Newman', 'Organic', 'Foods']",N/A
