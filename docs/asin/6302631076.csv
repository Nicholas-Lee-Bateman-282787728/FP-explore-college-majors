323716,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,6302631076,Brett Johnson,"[5, 9]","""Live Wire"" wasn't able to make it into the theaters.  That's because this is strictly second rate.  The storyline alternates between being laughable and being predictable.  Pierce Brosnan portrays a bomb expert who usually works for the FBI but also does some side work for the local police.  His marriage is on the rocks because he allowed their young daughter to drown in the pool.  How nice.  The incident is shown only in flashback and seems almost trivial the way in which it is presented.  Brosnan ends up becoming involved with an investigation into exploding politicians.  Yup...that's right.  Certain senators end up combusting in a big way after drinking what appears to be water.  The end of the movie borrows more than a little inspiration from the TV show ""MacGyver"".  This movie never really finds its place and contains your standard action sequences and rather poor special effects.

It does so.Anyone who likes action without deep thinking or higher purposes will find it  in this film. For the younger set, Brosnan should appeal to males and females alike.

Ron Silver plays the part of the fourth Senator inquestion, Frank Traveres, who is having an affair with O'Neill's wife. Ben Cross is Mikhail Rashid and does a great job at being a bad guy.The movie is filled with great action, the plot is interesting, and the scenes well done. At some point, the creativity of Danny O'Neill reminded us of MacGyver, for he knows how to turn every house item into a powerful weapon.

323722,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,6302631076,"""iriley1979""","[11, 13]","This movie is very underated, I happen to think it is better than every James Bond movie Bronson has made except for Golden Eye. Bronson's character in this movie has more depth than Bond's character which allowes Bronson to show of his acting talents and a wider range of emotions. In this movie he plays a capable, resoursful, tough, independent, bomb specialist. However, he is also a haunted drunk with a temper. Bronson's child drowned in a pool at their home while he was supposed to be watching her. The guilt has turned him into a hollow shell of the man he was. His wife has seperated from him and is now dating a senator who she works for. The senator, played by Ron Silver, is a great character. Silver does a supreb job of being sleazy and arrogant in this movie. The plot of this movie is unrealistic but intriguing nonetheless. Somehow a middle eastern terrorist/arms dealer has succeded in developing an explosive that exists in liquid form. For instance it looks like water but if you drink it you explode. The scenes where people explode are CRAZY!!! People get it really bad in this movie. The villian in this film is great, I have never heard of Ben Cross before and have never seen him in anything since this film and I do not know why since he plays such a great villian. His screen presence is astounding, he has even more presence than Brosnon. I lot of people gave this movie bad reviews but from reading what they wrote it seems to me that they had trouble following the plot. A lot happens in this movie very quickly and the plot involves a United States governent sponsored arms deal gone bad. In truth the movie could have spent more time detailing exactly what went wrong between the senators and the arms dealer (Ben Cross). Ben Cross's assistant is the guy who played the father on Ressecurtion Boulvd. (the Showtime orginal series about boxing) and he is good as a terrorist. I liked the fact that Bronson is pretty much the only good guy in the film, the senators are bad, and so is the arms dealer. Lots of intense action scenes, horrible death, etc. Good direction, script, acting, etc. The evil people in this movie get what is coming to them in the end, the senator especially.",4,Brosnon is electrifying as a loose cannon with brains.,1057104000,"07 2, 2003",2003,2214,"['movie', 'very', 'underated', 'happen', 'think', 'better', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'Bronson', 'made', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'Bronson', 'character', 'movie', 'more', 'depth', 'Bond', 'character', 'Bronson', 'show', 'acting', 'talents', 'wider', 'range', 'emotions', 'movie', 'capable', 'resoursful', 'tough', 'independent', 'bomb', 'specialist', 'However', 'also', 'haunted', 'drunk', 'temper', 'Bronson', 'child', 'drowned', 'pool', 'home', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'guilt', 'turned', 'hollow', 'shell', 'man', 'was', 'wife', 'seperated', 'now', 'dating', 'senator', 'who', 'senator', 'played', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'great', 'character', 'Silver', 'supreb', 'job', 'being', 'sleazy', 'arrogant', 'movie', 'plot', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'intriguing', 'nonetheless', 'Somehow', 'middle', 'eastern', 'terrorist/arms', 'dealer', 'succeded', 'developing', 'explosive', 'liquid', 'form', 'instance', 'water', 'drink', 'explode', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'explode', 'are', 'CRAZY', 'People', 'get', 'really', 'bad', 'movie', 'villian', 'film', 'great', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'great', 'villian', 'screen', 'presence', 'astounding', 'even', 'more', 'presence', 'Brosnon', 'lot', 'people', 'gave', 'movie', 'bad', 'reviews', 'reading', 'what', 'wrote', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'plot', 'lot', 'movie', 'very', 'quickly', 'plot', 'United', 'States', 'governent', 'sponsored', 'arms', 'deal', 'gone', 'bad', 'truth', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'detailing', 'exactly', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'senators', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'assistant', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'father', 'Ressecurtion', 'Boulvd', 'Showtime', 'orginal', 'series', 'boxing', 'good', 'terrorist', 'liked', 'fact', 'Bronson', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'good', 'guy', 'film', 'senators', 'are', 'bad', 'so', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Lots', 'intense', 'action', 'scenes', 'horrible', 'death', 'etc', 'Good', 'direction', 'script', 'acting', 'etc', 'evil', 'people', 'movie', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'end', 'senator', 'especially']",N/A

323724,A25JH6CO4DVINS,6302631076,Junglies,"[7, 9]","My wife suggested this movie while browsing in the local video store mainly because of her fascination for all things Brosnan whom she has liked since she first saw Remington Steele.Very reminiscent at the outset of Blown Away, the premise suggests that the US, so long immune from terrorist threat, may be subject to internal terroism. As the plot proceeds, one is reminded of the storyline of Die Hard where a supposed terrorist is nothing but a robber.Themeans by which the terror is spread is an explosive which is detonated by the human body itself and thus leaves no trace. Brosnan appears as an explosives expertwith a personal life in turmoil instigated in the first instance by the accidental drowning of his young daughter in the family swimming pool and an estranged wife allegedly in the midst of a relationship with a senator.It is clear from the start that there is no terorist in the sense of a freedom fighter but there is a ruthless murderer who uses a terrorist approach to secure a ten million dollar payoff which he has been swindled out of.The story proceeds at a good pace with hardly any time to draw breath but really does not carry the viewer with it. The scenes are all shot in glorious sunshine which shows off the Washington tourist attractions to good effect but which also serves to reduce the impact of the story. Similarly the extensive inclusion of insiders in the senate reduces the plausibilty of the plot. I was disturbed too by the focus on the ease by which Brosnan's character concocts explosives using highly visible ingredients in order to defeat the baddies. Although I do not like the idea of censorship I do question the judgement of film producers to educate the weak minded in this way.In the end the bad guys get their comeuppance, the good guy gets thegirl and we all live happily everafter.Brosnan had not yet aquired the gravitas that he would eventually bring to Bond and in many ways his character is an extension of the Remington Steels one where he is basically a good looking model. At times the character resembles that of an earlier movie, Taffin, where he falls into a depressive state but pulls himself out although the character there is much more interesting and dark.This is not a bad movie but an OK movie. I would not put it into the same class as Blown Away or the Devil's Own or In the Name of the Father but nevertheless it is a slient reminder of the dangers we face from within. It does not take much for one person to terrorise anyone and we should always be on our guard for that eventuality.On a final note. As I drew this review to a close I realised why the third senator in the story is so recognisable. It is because it is essentially the same part that the same actor plays in Timecop.Ha.",3,he's an urban guerilla...,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,2765,"['wife', 'suggested', 'movie', 'browsing', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'mainly', 'fascination', 'things', 'Brosnan', 'whom', 'liked', 'first', 'saw', 'Remington', 'Steele.Very', 'reminiscent', 'outset', 'Blown', 'Away', 'premise', 'US', 'so', 'long', 'immune', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'may', 'be', 'subject', 'internal', 'terroism', 'plot', 'proceeds', 'one', 'reminded', 'storyline', 'Die', 'Hard', 'where', 'supposed', 'terrorist', 'nothing', 'robber.Themeans', 'terror', 'spread', 'explosive', 'detonated', 'human', 'body', 'thus', 'trace', 'Brosnan', 'expertwith', 'personal', 'life', 'turmoil', 'instigated', 'first', 'instance', 'accidental', 'drowning', 'young', 'daughter', 'family', 'swimming', 'pool', 'estranged', 'wife', 'allegedly', 'midst', 'relationship', 'senator.It', 'clear', 'start', 'terorist', 'sense', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'ruthless', 'murderer', 'who', 'terrorist', 'approach', 'secure', 'ten', 'million', 'dollar', 'payoff', 'been', 'swindled', 'out', 'of.The', 'story', 'proceeds', 'good', 'pace', 'hardly', 'time', 'draw', 'breath', 'really', 'not', 'carry', 'viewer', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'glorious', 'sunshine', 'Washington', 'tourist', 'attractions', 'good', 'effect', 'also', 'reduce', 'impact', 'story', 'Similarly', 'extensive', 'inclusion', 'insiders', 'senate', 'plausibilty', 'plot', 'was', 'disturbed', 'too', 'focus', 'ease', 'Brosnan', 'character', 'using', 'highly', 'visible', 'ingredients', 'order', 'defeat', 'baddies', 'do', 'not', 'idea', 'censorship', 'do', 'question', 'judgement', 'film', 'producers', 'educate', 'weak', 'minded', 'end', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'good', 'guy', 'thegirl', 'live', 'happily', 'everafter.Brosnan', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'aquired', 'gravitas', 'would', 'eventually', 'bring', 'Bond', 'many', 'ways', 'character', 'extension', 'Remington', 'Steels', 'one', 'where', 'basically', 'good', 'looking', 'model', 'times', 'character', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Taffin', 'where', 'depressive', 'state', 'pulls', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'dark.This', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'OK', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'put', 'same', 'class', 'Blown', 'Away', 'Devil', 'Own', 'Name', 'Father', 'nevertheless', 'slient', 'reminder', 'dangers', 'face', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'one', 'person', 'terrorise', 'anyone', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'guard', 'final', 'note', 'drew', 'review', 'close', 'realised', 'why', 'third', 'senator', 'story', 'so', 'recognisable', 'essentially', 'same', 'part', 'same', 'actor', 'plays', 'Timecop.Ha']",N/A
