Loaded with potential, and a decent (albeit odd) story line, I watched from start to finish, hoping the film would finally come through with shining colors - it did not.The film is told in flashbacks. When done well, this can be a tremendous asset and make the film standout.  In this case however, the viewer is left trying to piece together a puzzle (with too many pieces missing).  Right up until the very end, I waited (hoped and prayed) it would come together).  Having watched the last 20 or so minutes a second time the next day, my friend and I were able to connect a few of the dots, but at the end, we were very disappointed.  The acting and direction are good, but the flow is slow, and often choppy.  By far, not the worst I have seen, and certainly no where near the best.Soundless Wind Chime has elements that are caring and compassionate, but filled too often with elements that seem loosely if at all connected to the overall story.",2,So Much Potential Never Realized,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",2011,1063,"['many', 'art', 'house', 'foreign', 'films', 'most', 'seem', 'gloriously', 'succeed', 'fail', 'one', 'kept', 'missing', 'mark', 'Loaded', 'potential', 'decent', 'odd', 'story', 'line', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'hoping', 'film', 'would', 'finally', 'come', 'shining', 'colors', 'did', 'not.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'When', 'done', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'tremendous', 'asset', 'make', 'film', 'standout', 'case', 'however', 'viewer', 'left', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'puzzle', 'too', 'many', 'pieces', 'missing', 'Right', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'waited', 'hoped', 'prayed', 'would', 'come', 'together', 'Having', 'watched', 'last', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'second', 'time', 'next', 'day', 'friend', 'were', 'able', 'connect', 'few', 'dots', 'end', 'were', 'very', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'good', 'flow', 'slow', 'often', 'choppy', 'far', 'not', 'worst', 'have', 'seen', 'certainly', 'where', 'best.Soundless', 'Wind', 'Chime', 'elements', 'are', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'filled', 'too', 'often', 'elements', 'seem', 'loosely', 'connected', 'overall', 'story']",N/A
1346631,A1A3ZFTFW2SY1M,B003IJS4DK,chromo_man,"[1, 5]","This film is not for everyone.  It moves slowly and has multiple settings and a fractured timeline that makes it not always clear the ""who, what, when and where"" of the scenes we are viewing.  Part of the story concerns a sort of quest, and that is what watching this film may feel like.  Yes, we do care about these characters and the situation they are in, but we may not understand them, and sitting through to the end may be our quest for that understanding.  While the production values and acting are fine, the film is ultimately not well-enough crafted to clearly guide us to a successful result of our quest.

Let's face it, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, and as the opening titles flashed on-screen I was already wondering if I'd have any trouble understanding this art film.And wouldn't you know.... the moment it was over, my reaction was ""What the heck?! What just happened?"" Man, I was confused---the narrative isn't linear at all, containing flashbacks, flashforwards, and everything in-between. I often had no idea exactly when the events depicted on-screen were supposed to be taking place---or where. (The film is set in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Beijing. The languages used are English, Swiss, German, Mandarin, and Cantonese---but there are English subtitles throughout.)Oh, the picture is beautifully shot and acted, but by the end I had no idea what was going on. So, I headed over to IMDB to check out the boards, and was surprised to find almost no discussion for the film there. However, I did read a few posts that quickly let me know that the scenario I had concocted in my mind (after I had finished viewing the film and mused about it a bit) was pretty much TOTALLY WRONG. Yep---I utterly and completely misunderstood what the message of the piece was, and got the gist of the plot wrong as well.So, I'm tempted to watch this one again---as I said, in many ways it is a beautiful and touching little film. But I'm kind of ticked off at the director for making this so opaque, so I don't know that I'll bother.",3,"Man, I'm so confused",1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,1556,"['Well', 'little', 'plot', 'summary', 'furnished', 'Amazon', 'only', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'far', 'plot', 'film', 'Let', 'face', ""'m"", 'not', 'sharpest', 'knife', 'drawer', 'opening', 'titles', 'flashed', 'on-screen', 'was', 'already', 'wondering', ""'d"", 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'art', 'film.And', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'moment', 'was', 'over', 'reaction', 'was', 'What', 'heck', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'Man', 'was', 'confused', '-the', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'linear', 'containing', 'flashbacks', 'flashforwards', 'everything', 'in-between', 'often', 'had', 'idea', 'exactly', 'when', 'events', 'depicted', 'on-screen', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'taking', 'place', '-or', 'where', 'film', 'set', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Switzerland', 'Beijing', 'languages', 'used', 'are', 'English', 'Swiss', 'German', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese', '-but', 'are', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Oh', 'picture', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'acted', 'end', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'So', 'headed', 'over', 'IMDB', 'check', 'out', 'boards', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'almost', 'discussion', 'film', 'there', 'However', 'did', 'read', 'few', 'posts', 'quickly', 'let', 'know', 'scenario', 'had', 'concocted', 'mind', 'had', 'finished', 'viewing', 'film', 'mused', 'bit', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'TOTALLY', 'WRONG', 'Yep', '-I', 'utterly', 'completely', 'misunderstood', 'what', 'message', 'piece', 'was', 'got', 'gist', 'plot', 'wrong', 'well.So', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'watch', 'one', 'again', '-as', 'said', 'many', 'ways', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'little', 'film', ""'m"", 'kind', 'ticked', 'off', 'director', 'making', 'so', 'opaque', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'bother']",N/A
