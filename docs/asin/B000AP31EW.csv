Cannova,"[0, 1]",The story line isnt as strong as in most anime at times its is confusing and tough to understand it dont even really make sense even with the ending this is one you can buy or be best to check out as a rental due to how the story line lags and you dont know where or what the charaters are doing and why or how everything came to be it still dont really explain what when where or why questions.it is different and will give your mind a run for its money on trying to understand the plot of the story.I can say I got it because Id not seen anything like it n decided to take a risk its not a long seris but not a bad one either the writers could have tweeked the charaters and story line alot better to answer the questions and not go all over the place,5,interesting one,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,753,"['story', 'line', 'isnt', 'as', 'strong', 'most', 'anime', 'times', 'confusing', 'tough', 'understand', 'dont', 'even', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'even', 'ending', 'one', 'can', 'buy', 'be', 'best', 'check', 'out', 'rental', 'due', 'how', 'story', 'line', 'lags', 'dont', 'know', 'where', 'what', 'charaters', 'are', 'doing', 'why', 'how', 'everything', 'came', 'be', 'still', 'really', 'explain', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'questions.it', 'different', 'will', 'give', 'mind', 'run', 'money', 'trying', 'understand', 'plot', 'story.I', 'can', 'say', 'got', 'Id', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'n', 'decided', 'take', 'risk', 'not', 'long', 'seris', 'not', 'bad', 'one', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'tweeked', 'charaters', 'story', 'line', 'alot', 'better', 'answer', 'questions', 'not', 'go', 'place']",N/A
930554,A3B8DR4BWZJBQQ,B000AP31EW,SR9,"[24, 27]","This DVD collection is nice, well-priced, and looks great. I was able to watch this with a friend, and not have to purchase it myself. For any relatively well-versed anime fan, this series is a walk through a colorful but extremely familiar park. The characters are certainly easy to like.The main issue I had with this anime is that it is packaged as one thing in many places... a story about supernatural factions fighting for domination in the mundane world, with an aspiring pop-singer as the key character... when the truth is that this story is about 85% relationship-oriented. It's a romance with some supernatural elements thrown in. The struggle and rivalry between the factions are a serious backdrop, often more hinted at than played out, and they leave the viewer boggled about who belongs to what until six or seven episodes in. By the end, I was feeling that I wished they had done much more with some of that great story potential.It has a feel-good, gentle, know-thyself kind of message, but the story, character design and setting are a little cliche. They throw in as many standard anime bits as they can, but all of these pieces have been fleshed out far better in other series. Summarized all together: It's a nice rental, looks good, and for the less finicky anime geek, it's certainly mellow and fun. As another reviewer has advised, I recommend giving some other titles a viewing before spending your money here.",2,2.5 Stars for an enjoyable but forgettable anime.,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1435,"['DVD', 'collection', 'nice', 'well-priced', 'great', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'friend', 'not', 'have', 'purchase', 'relatively', 'well-versed', 'anime', 'fan', 'series', 'walk', 'colorful', 'extremely', 'familiar', 'park', 'characters', 'are', 'certainly', 'easy', 'like.The', 'main', 'issue', 'had', 'anime', 'packaged', 'one', 'thing', 'many', 'places', 'story', 'supernatural', 'factions', 'fighting', 'domination', 'mundane', 'world', 'aspiring', 'pop-singer', 'key', 'character', 'when', 'truth', 'story', '85', '%', 'relationship-oriented', 'romance', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'thrown', 'struggle', 'rivalry', 'factions', 'are', 'serious', 'backdrop', 'often', 'more', 'hinted', 'played', 'out', 'leave', 'viewer', 'boggled', 'who', 'what', 'six', 'seven', 'episodes', 'end', 'was', 'feeling', 'wished', 'had', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'great', 'story', 'potential.It', 'feel-good', 'gentle', 'know-thyself', 'kind', 'message', 'story', 'character', 'design', 'setting', 'are', 'little', 'cliche', 'throw', 'as', 'many', 'standard', 'anime', 'bits', 'can', 'pieces', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'series', 'Summarized', 'together', 'nice', 'rental', 'good', 'less', 'finicky', 'anime', 'geek', 'certainly', 'mellow', 'fun', 'reviewer', 'advised', 'recommend', 'giving', 'other', 'titles', 'viewing', 'spending', 'money', 'here']",N/A
930555,A187O4M7CZMTDB,B000AP31EW,T. Hunter-Selbrede,"[2, 6]","I liked the Juvenile Orion manga, though it was ridiculously short and mainly used to bolster a card game.  I liked the various artwork collected in a book on Juvenile Orion which included artwork from the card series as well.  Every once in awhile I'd do a search to see if something, anything, else would come along to fill in the gaps.I was second guessing myself from the first time I found this product.  The reviews were split.  The characters weren't from Juvenile Orion.  Even so, it was set in that universe and I gave it a go.  Last night we tried watching the first disc and I actively began stating, ""Oh, this was a mistake..."" while the other person said, ""Well, give it a chance.""I gave it a chance.  Four episodes worth.  By then there was a universal, ""Oh, this was a bad mistake,"" echoing through the house.  Four episodes of a 13 episode series and they haven't even began to get to the basic plot of the Aquarian Age universe, which I had been miserably trying to explain for the last two episodes.  Oh, there was a time or two where you'd get a random glimpse with no real ties or depth, but they never really seemed to latch onto the main characters, who were trying to be a rock band and somewhat succeeding.  According to the description of this Anime, the protagonist is supposed to be agonizing over his responsibilities and powers vs. his music.Again, four episodes in and his career is doing fairly well, and nobody seems to really want to point out his alleged abilities (I say alleged because, really, other than being a really good harmonica player, you aren't seeing anything of a supernatural nature).So, there's $40 down the drain.  I don't even have anybody who I would give this to in my group of anime watching friends - they would lynch me.  I'm afraid it's going straight into the trash bin unless I meet a feeble minded anime fan in the next day or two.",1,Bad... so bad...,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,1892,"['liked', 'Juvenile', 'Orion', 'manga', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'short', 'mainly', 'used', 'bolster', 'card', 'game', 'liked', 'various', 'artwork', 'collected', 'book', 'Juvenile', 'Orion', 'included', 'artwork', 'card', 'series', 'well', 'once', 'awhile', ""'d"", 'do', 'search', 'see', 'something', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'come', 'fill', 'gaps.I', 'was', 'second', 'guessing', 'first', 'time', 'found', 'product', 'reviews', 'were', 'split', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'Juvenile', 'Orion', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'set', 'universe', 'gave', 'go', 'Last', 'night', 'tried', 'watching', 'first', 'disc', 'actively', 'began', 'stating', 'Oh', 'was', 'mistake', 'other', 'person', 'said', 'Well', 'give', 'chance', 'gave', 'chance', 'Four', 'episodes', 'worth', 'then', 'was', 'universal', 'Oh', 'was', 'bad', 'mistake', 'echoing', 'house', 'Four', 'episodes', '13', 'episode', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'began', 'get', 'basic', 'plot', 'Aquarian', 'Age', 'universe', 'had', 'been', 'miserably', 'trying', 'explain', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Oh', 'was', 'time', 'two', 'where', ""'d"", 'get', 'random', 'glimpse', 'real', 'ties', 'depth', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'latch', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'rock', 'band', 'somewhat', 'succeeding', 'According', 'description', 'Anime', 'protagonist', 'supposed', 'be', 'agonizing', 'responsibilities', 'powers', 'music.Again', 'four', 'episodes', 'career', 'doing', 'fairly', 'well', 'nobody', 'really', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'alleged', 'abilities', 'say', 'alleged', 'because', 'really', 'other', 'being', 'really', 'good', 'harmonica', 'player', 'are', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'anything', 'supernatural', 'nature', '.So', '40', 'drain', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'anybody', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'group', 'anime', 'watching', 'friends', 'would', 'lynch', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'going', 'straight', 'trash', 'bin', 'meet', 'feeble', 'minded', 'anime', 'fan', 'next', 'day', 'two']",N/A
