If you haven't seen &#34;The Odyssey&#34; I highly recommend it. Men, women and teens will enjoy this movie. It's long, full of action, love and mythology. It is, of course, based on Homer's classic &#34;The Odyssey&#34; so it brings the characters, gods, people, places and events of Greek Mythology to life, and does it very well.I watched Gulliver's Travels years ago with my children.. It was entertaining and done well. Ted Danson did the part of Gulliver justice. I loved the book as a child, though, so I already had the characters set in my mind...

1382174,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B0041SI78O,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","These are wonderful TV mini-series of 2 great classics.  My kids are studying them - my daughter even had the Odysseus film as background images for a musical production she was in - and this is a review of their readings and works of art in their own right.  I am sure that we will watch them both many times and discuss them (their questions, observations, and arguments - the greatest treat of all!).Gulliver does not follow the traditional film versions.  In the first part, the lilliputians and giants are already done.  Gulliver goes on to other adventures that I didn't remember (I am not even sure I read it in high school), such as the floating city of ineffectual intellectual Indians, the horse society, etc. It gets one to question the Enlightenment nostrums while keeping us laughing.  What is most interesting of all is that he remembers all of this in an ongoing drama taking place in the present, when he has returned home to discover he has been ruined by a man who took over his practice and wants his wife.  The man (Foxx) argues that he is insane and his wife fears it is true and has him committed.  I do not know if this is faithful to the book, but now I must read it.  That - the desire to learn more - is the greatest form of artistic success, imho.Odysseus, which I know much better as a literary source, is wonderfully evoked.  Though it does not follow the version by Homer all that closely, which to my delight my son keeps pointing out with his (French) schoolbook in hand, it most definitely is faithful to the spirit of it, with all the worldview of a polytheistic universe (scornful gods whom Odysseus cannot trust and with whom he maintains a scornful and sometimes playful debate as the ""first thinking man, who knows there always something  to learn"").  This is a first rate production and well worth the most of admission.  THere is also much about the ""meaning"" in it of Odysseus as a hero, i.e. that as a trickster, he is the first man to use his mind, to think on his own.Warmly recommended.
