It was actually quite good!  (for a Tv Movie).  It was REALLY sad!  I cried about 8 times during it!!  Kimberly Williams was FANTASTIC!  Rob Lowe's character was really jerky (was hard to like his character, even at the end).  But overall, it is a keeper and reminds you how much family is important.

It turns out that Nathan, the boy is the lawyer's wife's pupil.  Nathan wants to buy his dying mother shoes so she will look nice when she goes to see Jesus.  If that ain't sad enough, the part where Nathan listens to her heart to see if she is still alive was just too hard for me.  I had to leave the room on that part.  It hammers you over the head with what is really important in life, but still, as other reviewers on the US boards have said, I, too prefer something more upbeat and cheery for the holidays.

That doesn't make it a bad movie.  Any number of stars in a mistake.  You just got the wrong movie.If you throw up at the thought of tender, affirmative feelings, this movie is not for you.  That doesn't make it a bad movie.  There a millions of hostile movies out there.  Pick one.News flash: there really ARE towns in the U.S. like the one in the movie (which was in Nova Scotia).  If you hate small, friendly towns, then stay away from them.  They probably wouldn't like you either.On the other hand, if you like the feelings that are supposed to be associated with Christmas, this movie is a rare find.  It's very easy to flub on tragic scenes.  This movie doesn't.  The acting by Kimberly Williams is just right.  The timing and the scripting of the scenes is just right.  As Maria Del Mar said in the special feature, these people act the way people really act.  They don't throw things or rant the way most movie scripts have it.  Maria, by the way, played her part very effectively.I'm no fan of Rob Lowe, but his lawyer convinced me.  Maybe I've known too many like him.  They really are like this.  If this strikes you as stiff, get over it.  You want a lawyer, this is a lawyer.I'm as easily depressed as the next guy, but I did not find this movie depressing.  Tragic, yes.  Depressing, no.  Not sure why.  The fact that the husband and son were going to go on, going to make it and be okay.  The reformation of Robert was credible.

The additional characters in the movies such as the store owner, the neighbor to Rob Lowe's character's mother, etc. are all nicely added.While I agree that this movie could have been done in a shorter amount of time, it is still done very well.

Perhaps, some connection of the present with the past that makes the existence of the shoe special and leads to some special future event. What occurred was far less than this.The impact of the christmas shoes did not even begin to occur until an hour of the movie was gone. So what was so special about 'them shoes"". Not much.The dying mother/choir director stated she had some christmas shoes that she loved, etc, and this did something for her that was important. what was that? Not really sure. So I kept hoping and hoping to see something begin to develop, grow out of this entire issue of shoes. Nothing came except for one small anecdotal event. Lowe helped pay for the shoes the boy gave to his dying mother. Lowe had an epiphany from this event, but we are not sure how it came about to be honest. At the end he sees the young man at the cemetary and then see he had put the shoes on his mother's grave. This was the only poignant moment, I felt, that involved the special shoes.I recommend seeing this movie once, maybe twice, if you desire, but as for buying it.

1008525,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000GYIPPW,Kathy W,"[1, 1]","Inspired by the award winning song of the same name, this is a beautiful story and well worth watching.  Although it deals with death and grieving, it is done with an acceptance and beauty that is so very loving.  Yes, even the big macho guy named Bubba will need tissues to watch this one, because it touches the heart and the soul.  The movie is 94 minutes in length, slightly more than 1  hours.  Although the story line takes place in a small town in Boston, Massachusetts during Christmas time, it was actually filmed in a small town in Nova Scotia, Canada in July!  (BTW - I've been to Nova Scotia and it is beautiful there!).  There's lots of real-looking snow in this movie, too.  Special added features include interviews and a video of the hit song by the group New Song.  Note that I have NOT read the book, so this review is based strictly on seeing the movie.The movie begins with Robert Layton (Rob Lowe) visiting a grave.  The snow is everywhere.  He mentions that if we are open to it, the smallest of miracles can change our lives.  (So true.)Then we jump back a little in time and we meet Robert Layton, his wife Kate (Maria del Mar) and daughter Lily (Amber) as he is rushing to get to work.  Robert is a workaholic lawyer who is looking for the material side of life (big house on snob hill).  It's all about money with Robert.  He is even pushing his wife to get a job so they can achieve all that money can buy even quicker.  The Layton's have reached a time in their marriage where they are not communicating very well: Robert has stopped listening and stopped caring about the touchy-feely things in life.  As Robert leaves the local coffee shop, a box of red shoes falls off a truck.  He picks them up, intending to deliver them to the store they are addressed to.  To Robert's defense, he is trying to help the local farmers keep their land from being taken away due to alleged environmental issues.Driving down the street, Robert meets Maggie Andrews (Kimberly Williams) and son Nathan as she accidentally bounces a football off his car.  Mr. Andrews is the local car mechanic.  In school, Nathan's teacher Dalton Gregory (Dorian Harewood) reads a story about magic shoes.  Wives Kate and Maggie meet at a school function, where Maggie is a volunteer working with the children's chorus in the music program.  We soon find out that Maggie has progressive congestive heart failure.Another really cool thing about this movie is that it illustrates synchronicity in life.  It is amazing to observe how all the little puzzle pieces of life come together to intertwine these two families and events and bring about love and support at a time when it is needed the most.I believe you will love this beautiful little movie.  It would also make a nice Christmas stocking stuffer or addition to a gift basket, or a little ""I'm thinking of you"" gift for someone.  It illustrates beauty and love in so many ways.  If you are familiar with the song, it follows and expands on the story within the song.Peace and love.",5,A Beautiful Story About Love,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,3031,"['Inspired', 'award', 'winning', 'song', 'same', 'name', 'beautiful', 'story', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'death', 'grieving', 'done', 'acceptance', 'beauty', 'so', 'very', 'loving', 'Yes', 'even', 'big', 'macho', 'guy', 'named', 'Bubba', 'will', 'need', 'tissues', 'watch', 'one', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', '94', 'minutes', 'length', 'slightly', 'more', '1', 'hours', 'story', 'line', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'Boston', 'Massachusetts', 'Christmas', 'time', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'small', 'town', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'Canada', 'July', 'BTW', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'beautiful', 'there', 'lots', 'real-looking', 'snow', 'movie', 'too', 'Special', 'added', 'features', 'include', 'interviews', 'video', 'hit', 'song', 'group', 'New', 'Song', 'Note', 'have', 'NOT', 'read', 'book', 'review', 'based', 'strictly', 'seeing', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'Robert', 'Layton', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'visiting', 'grave', 'snow', 'everywhere', 'are', 'open', 'smallest', 'miracles', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'So', 'true', 'Then', 'jump', 'back', 'little', 'time', 'meet', 'Robert', 'Layton', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Maria', 'del', 'Mar', 'daughter', 'Lily', 'Amber', 'rushing', 'get', 'work', 'Robert', 'workaholic', 'lawyer', 'who', 'looking', 'material', 'side', 'life', 'big', 'house', 'snob', 'hill', 'money', 'Robert', 'even', 'pushing', 'wife', 'get', 'job', 'can', 'achieve', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'even', 'quicker', 'Layton', 'have', 'reached', 'time', 'marriage', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'communicating', 'very', 'well', 'Robert', 'stopped', 'listening', 'stopped', 'caring', 'touchy-feely', 'things', 'life', 'Robert', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'box', 'red', 'shoes', 'truck', 'up', 'intending', 'deliver', 'store', 'are', 'addressed', 'Robert', 'defense', 'trying', 'help', 'local', 'farmers', 'keep', 'land', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'due', 'alleged', 'environmental', 'issues.Driving', 'down', 'street', 'Robert', 'Maggie', 'Andrews', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'son', 'Nathan', 'accidentally', 'football', 'car', 'Mr.', 'Andrews', 'local', 'car', 'mechanic', 'school', 'Nathan', 'teacher', 'Dalton', 'Gregory', 'Dorian', 'Harewood', 'story', 'magic', 'shoes', 'Wives', 'Kate', 'Maggie', 'meet', 'school', 'function', 'where', 'Maggie', 'volunteer', 'working', 'children', 'chorus', 'music', 'program', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'Maggie', 'progressive', 'congestive', 'heart', 'failure.Another', 'really', 'cool', 'thing', 'movie', 'synchronicity', 'life', 'amazing', 'observe', 'how', 'little', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'life', 'come', 'together', 'intertwine', 'two', 'families', 'events', 'bring', 'about', 'love', 'support', 'time', 'when', 'needed', 'most.I', 'believe', 'will', 'love', 'beautiful', 'little', 'movie', 'would', 'also', 'make', 'nice', 'Christmas', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'addition', 'gift', 'basket', 'little', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'gift', 'someone', 'beauty', 'love', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'familiar', 'song', 'story', 'song.Peace', 'love']",N/A

It is a very poignant story about a mother dying of heart failure and her son wanting her to meet Jesus with a special pair of red shoes ""The Christmas Shoes"", that he wants to buy her for Christmas. His mission is to make sure she does, so not to give too much of the story away go out and buy this excellent tearjerker and make sure you have a box of tissues handy, you'll need them. I brought this DVD last year after seeing it on Sky Movies in 2004 in the UK. It is also part one of a trilogy of films and books, the others are The Christmas Blessing and The Christmas Hope. The song at the end of this film which is just so lovely is by Newsong and I have just managed to get it on two different CD's from the USA, the first CD contains The Christmas Shoes and other christmas songs and the other again by Newsong called The Christmas Hope contains a new version of The Christmas Shoes and adds the final two songs of the trilogy, The Christmas Blessing and The Christmas Hope to it with more new christmas songs. So go out and buy them too, you won't regret it I promise. I have brought a copy of this version of The Christmas Shoes from Amazon.com as it has extras on the DVD that the UK version does not. This is also part of my review that I used on Amazon.uk which has been published on the website over here, but felt I just had to do a review for Amazon.com too.",5,THE CHRISTMAS SHOES - ROB LOWE (DVD),1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,1465,"['one', 'favourite', 'films/Christmas', 'Films', 'time', 'what', 'tearjerker', 'very', 'poignant', 'story', 'mother', 'dying', 'heart', 'failure', 'son', 'wanting', 'meet', 'Jesus', 'special', 'pair', 'red', 'shoes', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'buy', 'Christmas', 'mission', 'make', 'sure', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'away', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'excellent', 'tearjerker', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', ""'ll"", 'need', 'brought', 'DVD', 'last', 'year', 'seeing', 'Sky', 'Movies', '2004', 'UK', 'also', 'part', 'one', 'trilogy', 'films', 'books', 'others', 'are', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'Christmas', 'Hope', 'song', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'lovely', 'Newsong', 'have', 'just', 'managed', 'get', 'two', 'different', 'CD', 'USA', 'first', 'CD', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'other', 'christmas', 'songs', 'other', 'again', 'Newsong', 'called', 'Christmas', 'Hope', 'new', 'version', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'final', 'two', 'songs', 'trilogy', 'Christmas', 'Blessing', 'Christmas', 'Hope', 'more', 'new', 'christmas', 'songs', 'So', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'promise', 'have', 'brought', 'copy', 'version', 'Christmas', 'Shoes', 'Amazon.com', 'extras', 'DVD', 'UK', 'version', 'not', 'also', 'part', 'review', 'used', 'Amazon.uk', 'been', 'published', 'website', 'here', 'felt', 'just', 'had', 'do', 'review', 'Amazon.com', 'too']",N/A
