1541656,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B008220AGC,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[2, 2]","""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" opens with a landscape of hardscrabble poverty that could be many places: I was totally unfamiliar with the plot, and thought perhaps it was set in Africa). Gradually the story is developed, centered on the lives of six-year old Hushpuppy, the introspective and often isolated daughter of Wink. They live on what most would consider the wrong side of a Louisiana levee, in an isolated community known as ""The Bathtub"".Wink and Hushpuppy are both struggling with abandonment (Hushpuppy's mom left the family under circumstances never fully explained), and Wink also suffers from other maladies. His drinking (and that of many of The Bathtub's adults that are his peers) is evident from the beginning. It's also clear that he has other medical issues. Eventually, after a hurricane has come and gone and profoundly disrupted The Bathtub's residents way of life, Wink has to tell Hushpuppy about the leukemia that is killing him.Throughout this movie, Hushpuppy is influenced by other adults, some that come and go and some that stay: the Bathtub's regulars, the women who populate a floating catfish restaurant and nightclub, the folk healer who teaches her and her and other Bathtub kids some of the hard truths about the world (""we are all meat...""). She is also aligned with the natural world around her, the rhythms of rural livestock, and their eventual role in placing food on the table.The beasts of the title are aurochs, symbolic of fear and loss that appear in Hushpuppy's visions of the world. And make no mistake about it: it is a world that is wet and dirty, with adults streaked with violence, devoid of true warmth or connection (""I can count the number of times I've been picked up"" she says at one point).For a PG-13 movie, the subject matter is serious and intense; tread carefully before exposing younger viewers to this movie.But by all means, watch it. It's far afield from the usual offerings on the big screen, and will take you to surprising places at the end.",5,Incredible break from the usual formulas...,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2012,"['Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'landscape', 'hardscrabble', 'poverty', 'could', 'be', 'many', 'places', 'was', 'totally', 'unfamiliar', 'plot', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'was', 'set', 'Africa', 'Gradually', 'story', 'developed', 'centered', 'lives', 'six-year', 'old', 'Hushpuppy', 'introspective', 'often', 'isolated', 'daughter', 'Wink', 'live', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'consider', 'wrong', 'side', 'Louisiana', 'levee', 'isolated', 'community', 'known', 'Bathtub', '.Wink', 'Hushpuppy', 'are', 'struggling', 'abandonment', 'Hushpuppy', 'mom', 'left', 'family', 'circumstances', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'Wink', 'also', 'other', 'maladies', 'drinking', 'many', 'Bathtub', 'adults', 'are', 'peers', 'evident', 'beginning', 'also', 'clear', 'other', 'medical', 'issues', 'Eventually', 'hurricane', 'come', 'gone', 'profoundly', 'disrupted', 'Bathtub', 'residents', 'way', 'life', 'Wink', 'tell', 'Hushpuppy', 'leukemia', 'killing', 'him.Throughout', 'movie', 'Hushpuppy', 'influenced', 'other', 'adults', 'come', 'go', 'stay', 'Bathtub', 'regulars', 'women', 'who', 'populate', 'floating', 'catfish', 'restaurant', 'nightclub', 'folk', 'healer', 'who', 'other', 'Bathtub', 'kids', 'hard', 'truths', 'world', 'are', 'meat', 'also', 'aligned', 'natural', 'world', 'rhythms', 'rural', 'livestock', 'eventual', 'role', 'placing', 'food', 'table.The', 'beasts', 'title', 'are', 'aurochs', 'symbolic', 'fear', 'loss', 'appear', 'Hushpuppy', 'visions', 'world', 'make', 'mistake', 'world', 'wet', 'dirty', 'adults', 'streaked', 'violence', 'devoid', 'true', 'warmth', 'connection', 'can', 'count', 'number', 'times', ""'ve"", 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'one', 'point', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'serious', 'intense', 'tread', 'carefully', 'exposing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'movie.But', 'means', 'watch', 'far', 'afield', 'usual', 'offerings', 'big', 'screen', 'will', 'take', 'surprising', 'places', 'end']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541660,ASZGADJQT6ET4,B008220AGC,Adam Gagnon,"[0, 1]","[...]Depressingly optimistic and beautifully ugly. Beasts of the Southern Wild makes contradictions work to its extreme benefit. Beasts of the Southern Wild is a movie that audiences experience more than simply watch. The truly amazing thing is not only do they experience a unique story with interesting visuals but they experience it all through the eyes of a child.One of the most unique stories of 2012 Beasts takes place in a small island separated by the mainland by a man made levee. The residents of this small island affectionately call it the Bathtub. The residents have a unique sense of community and feel that this place is not only their rightful home but is true freedom. Newcomer Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis plays Hushpuppy a little girl growing up rough with only her angry father as a guide. Hushpuppy is a strangely optimistic child when the audience first meets her despite her tough upbringing. Wink (Dwight Henry) is Hushpuppy&#8217;s father. He is a harsh man but he loves his daughter in his own unique way. Wink teaches Hushpuppy how to cope in their limited scope of the world and his life lessons are harsh and strange to outsiders but seem to be what Hushpuppy needs for life in the Bathtub. Hushpuppy&#8217;s life gets turned upside down by massive events out of anyone&#8217;s control and Beasts becomes a story about children in extreme circumstances.Saying the movie is depressingly optimistic is very literal. Hushpuppy leads a hard life and she is surrounded by hard ship. When things look grim they somehow always get worse. The optimism comes from the purity and innocence of childhood. Part of Hushpuppy being able to cope with the hardships she faces is her unique education and rough upbringing. The other part is how a child&#8217;s mind perceives and processes things differently from an adult. The scenes with Hushpuppy and her father coming to grips with things together are spectacular. Hushpuppy also has her own unique way of seeing the world. Much of the movie is shot at very low angles so the child&#8217;s point of view is quite literal. There are also scenes that are real enough to be believable but also skewed just enough to be seen through her eyes.The audience never questions whether any of the actors are actually from the Bathtub. The movie could almost be a documentary instead of a Drama with the realism portrayed in all of the characters. Hushpuppy was Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis&#8217; first job acting. Having to lie about her age to be old enough to tryout she won the part and showed that she truly earned it. In a year full of astounding performances from some of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest names one of the most impressive performances in any movie was that of a six year old who had never acted professionally before. As the story progresses you are not only engaged enough to see how it all turns out but you truly care for the future and well being of the child. Almost equally as impressive is Dwight Henry as Wink, Hushpuppy&#8217;s father. Another new comer to acting, Henry had to play abrasive and rash while still showing immense love for Wallis. Playing mean opposite a small child can never be easy and playing mean opposite a child with kind and caring undertones has to be even harder. Both Wallis and Henry deliver flawless performances. The rest of the cast is two-dimensional. Witty nicknames and some long established inside jokes between the characters show them as staples in the community but no one is really given material to dive into since the story focuses on Hushpuppy.Beasts of the Southern Wild is a must see. Some of the best acting in any movie in recent memory is showcased in this original story. Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis may be the best child actor of all time and her career will be very interesting to watch develop.

The humanity displayed by the characters is 100% engrossing. Words can barely express how moved I am with this movie. I actually shed a tear during the end of the movie not out of sadness but because if was so compelling that a father would be so committed to putting his daughter mentally and spiritually in the best place to live life.

1541664,A3DZ2907IDX7ME,B008220AGC,A Forest Fan,"[0, 2]","I struggled to understand the perspective(s) of the movie. We were seeing Hurricane Katrina from the perspective of a little girl. Or is it an apocalyptic tale in the distant future, like The Hunger Games? The plot was so unconnected that it made The Phantom Menace look like a tightly-scripted masterpiece. Watching the adults celebrate the incoming storm (by everyone shouting ""Yeah!!!"" for absolutely no reason while spraying dangerous fireworks all over the tinderbox woods), it's hard to see why the kids should not be taken away to shelters away from these brain cell free morons in their ""community"".The community that Hushpuppy lives in does not produce anything, does not build anything, does not repair anything, does not maintain anything. They seem completely isolated from the outside world, yet somehow have an economy that supplies them with fireworks shipped from distant China, and bottled label beer from outside their community. There is a small plot of Hushpuppy's Dad having some sort of plague, or is it the symptoms of his 24/7 alcohol diet? From the adults in the movie, this story goes a long way towards showing what happens when people become so dependent on a benevolent government that they are unable to think for themselves when a hurricane is looming. That's the only factual connection with Hurricane Katrina, where mayor Ray Nagin and Lousiana governor Kathleen Blanco were criminally incompetent and clueless and failed to evacuate people or follow their own state guidelines and procedures.Back to the movie, we are shown giant boars unleashed for the next Ice Age by a vengeful nature. At first I thought only Hushpuppy saw them, a symptom of her father feeding her wood alcohol I presume. But all the kids scream and the adults run when the boars show up to acknowledge Hushpuppy as their Queen of the new age. The boars disappear as the surviving community marches to the civilized land, waving flags and apparently giving up to return to the land of Wal-mart. If all the drunken idiots in this movie drowned while drinking their 5th bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, I doubt they'd notice.

It was painful to watch this child being bullied by her drunken father. She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive.

1541680,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008220AGC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","One of the biggest highlights of the movie year that was 2012, `Beasts of the Southern Wild' burst onto the scene with so much hype and buzz and pretty much floated all year on great reviews and word of mouth until it stunned at the Oscars and nabbed four nominations, none of which were sure things before the announcement was made.So richly deserved!I first saw `Beasts of the Southern Wild' while in flight to Europe.  I was hovering over London when the film ended and I remember struggling to process everything as I was hustling to get from one terminal to another and I had planned on watching it a second time while on my second flight only to find out that there were no inflight movies going forward.  I had to wait another month before I could get my hands on the film a second time, but it was that second viewing that cemented all I thought I knew and actually helped grow the film in my personal esteem.  It is a beautiful work of art; a film that is so special and so unique that little else I can even think of compares the strength with which it propels its prose.  Saddled on the shoulders of two non-actors, and prodded along by a first time director, `Beasts of the Southern Wild' is a film that could and probably should have failed and yet every minute detail feels so richly uncovered and it is one of those films that certainly grows with each repeat viewing.It is beautiful.`Beasts of the Southern Wild' tells the story of Hushpuppy, a young girl living with her alcoholic father in the Louisiana bayou.  Hushpuppy's home life is less than desirable.  Her mother is absent and her father is not only dependent on the drink, but he is emotionally unstable and thus reacts in ways that shun and alienate Hushpuppy.  Still, the Bathtub (the area in which they live) is her home and all she knows and so when her life is threatened by an impending storm, things take a drastic change of pace and thrust Hushpuppy and her father into a new adventure.While some may balk at the progression of the film, I have to stand back and say that this film NEEDS to be considered as a whole, because it is in the rapturous finale (yes, tears were rolling down my face) that the whole thing comes together in such a beautiful way.  In a way, `Beasts of the Southern Wild' reminds me of `Where the Wild Things Are' from 2009.  It finds such complex and adult ways of addressing childhood and the necessity (sadly) of growing up so fast.  Hushpuppy is such an insightful young child growing up in a dark and scary place and yet it is home for her and it is something she knows and understands.  The heartbreak of childhood is explored with such depth, yet it is never heavy handed (Zeitlin's Oscar nomination is so richly deserved).  The search for Hushpuppy's mother and the connection with her father Wink is done so beautifully, and the organic performances by Wallis and Henry are such beautiful centerpieces for this fantastic film.Honestly, the more I think about this movie the more I'm convinced it is a masterpiece.",5,Where the wild things roam...,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,3030,"['One', 'biggest', 'highlights', 'movie', 'year', 'was', '2012', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'burst', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'buzz', 'pretty', 'much', 'floated', 'year', 'great', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'stunned', 'Oscars', 'nabbed', 'four', 'nominations', 'none', 'were', 'sure', 'things', 'announcement', 'was', 'made.So', 'richly', 'deserved', 'first', 'saw', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'while', 'flight', 'Europe', 'was', 'hovering', 'over', 'London', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'remember', 'struggling', 'process', 'everything', 'was', 'hustling', 'get', 'one', 'terminal', 'had', 'planned', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'second', 'flight', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'inflight', 'movies', 'going', 'forward', 'had', 'wait', 'month', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'was', 'second', 'viewing', 'cemented', 'thought', 'knew', 'actually', 'helped', 'grow', 'film', 'personal', 'esteem', 'beautiful', 'work', 'art', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'so', 'unique', 'little', 'else', 'can', 'even', 'think', 'compares', 'strength', 'prose', 'Saddled', 'shoulders', 'two', 'non-actors', 'prodded', 'along', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'film', 'could', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'failed', 'yet', 'minute', 'detail', 'feels', 'so', 'richly', 'uncovered', 'one', 'films', 'certainly', 'repeat', 'viewing.It', 'beautiful.', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'story', 'Hushpuppy', 'young', 'girl', 'living', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Louisiana', 'bayou', 'Hushpuppy', 'home', 'life', 'less', 'desirable', 'mother', 'absent', 'father', 'not', 'only', 'dependent', 'drink', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'thus', 'reacts', 'ways', 'shun', 'alienate', 'Hushpuppy', 'Still', 'Bathtub', 'area', 'live', 'home', 'so', 'when', 'life', 'threatened', 'impending', 'storm', 'things', 'take', 'drastic', 'change', 'pace', 'thrust', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'new', 'may', 'balk', 'progression', 'film', 'have', 'stand', 'back', 'say', 'film', 'NEEDS', 'be', 'considered', 'whole', 'rapturous', 'finale', 'yes', 'tears', 'were', 'rolling', 'down', 'face', 'whole', 'thing', 'together', 'such', 'beautiful', 'way', 'way', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'reminds', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', '2009', 'such', 'complex', 'adult', 'ways', 'addressing', 'childhood', 'necessity', 'sadly', 'growing', 'up', 'so', 'fast', 'Hushpuppy', 'such', 'insightful', 'young', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'dark', 'scary', 'place', 'yet', 'home', 'something', 'heartbreak', 'childhood', 'explored', 'such', 'depth', 'never', 'heavy', 'handed', 'Zeitlin', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved', 'search', 'Hushpuppy', 'mother', 'connection', 'father', 'Wink', 'done', 'so', 'beautifully', 'organic', 'performances', 'Wallis', 'Henry', 'are', 'such', 'beautiful', 'centerpieces', 'fantastic', 'film.Honestly', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'more', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'masterpiece']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

But he doesn't show you the mechanics and the politics of it. He show's you it's HEART. He shows you it's spirit. The audience is drawn right into a beautiful, fragile world in the deep American South, as seen through the innocent eyes of the young girl Hushpuppy.Quevenzhane Wallis - a brilliant 9 year old actress, was nominated for an Oscar for her perfect, incredible role as Hushpuppy - a young girl &#34;who lives with her Daddy in the Bathtub.&#34; Critic Roger Ebert described her as &#34;a nine-year old force of nature.&#34; And he's completely right. Quvenzhane's incredible performance as Hushpuppy - an equally incredible character- is worthy of any and all praise you can give it! It's acting that equals the best that I've seen an adult do.And let's not forget Dwight Henry as Wink. Now this is a man that has no previous acting experience - a family man who owns a bakery, who plays a difficult, meaty, scene-stealing, complex role as Hushpuppy's wild father Wink. His is a character that at is at one moment violent and alcoholic, and at the next a strong and fiercely loyal father. In my opinion, he IS one of the beasts of the Southern wild. The film is populated with brilliant, incredible characters such as these.I would also like to mention the amazing cinematography, score, and CGI. The Aurochs look perfectly realistic, and, while they're obviously CGI, don't detract from the film one iota, one atom! The cinematography is beautiful!Colourful, real, magical, beautiful, haunting, stirring, incredibly vivid...all these and more describe the cinematography of Beasts of the Southern Wild.And the score was one of my favourite parts of the film. It complements the film perfectly: enunciating but not detracting from the more emotional scenes, and used to great, heart-rousing effect in the closing scenes. It's really worth a listen.!The combination of all these amazing elements is a movie that is sometimes hard to watch, sometimes sad, but always magical, always original, always brilliant and beautiful. I didn't really like the story all that much - it's pretty straightforward and it could be better, but man does this movie pack a wallop!There is so so much more to cinema then Hollywood. Beasts of the Southern Wild is the future - an independent film with an unknown star that dazzled audiences worldwide, and transported them to another world of beauty, fragility, and magic.Watch Beasts of the Southern Wild - the arthouse film of the year! 5 Stars!",5,The beasts inside.

Two AMAZING actors beautifully played that indomitable human spirit.  Quvenzhane Wallis, the little girl who plays the daughter, certainly deserved to be nominated for Oscar, but where was the nomination for Dwight Henry, the actor who plays her father?

(Did I mention that she was 6 years old?)

1541700,A1JXE27STRRE0H,B008220AGC,"Beardyjin ""beardyjin""","[178, 190]","A good film is a confluence of many variables. A good director orchestrates these variables into a finished form. Beasts of the Southern Wild is such a film and Behn Zeitlin is such a director. And the brilliance of Zeitlin is that he manages to take all manner of seemingly contradictory elements and make them,as a nameless boat captain says in the film, cohesive.One such variable is story. Hushpuppy is a six-year-old girl who lives with her father on the wrong side of a levee in a fictitious Southeast Louisiana town called The Bathtub. The film follows her point of view, and the world of her active imagination and the real world around her often intertwine on screen. The film is your standard coming of age story, but it is this unique perspective of Hushpuppy and her understanding of the world around her that is the foundation of the film and its magic.Another variable is music. The director worked closely with his friend and composer Dan Romer in creating the score for the film. The result is one of the best scores in modern cinema. Just like the film, the music is a beautiful blend of contradictions. It's uplifting yet tinged with sadness, vast yet intimate, wise and noble yet naive and playful.And the final variable I'll mention is performance. Other reviewers have made mention of the non-actors that occupy this film. This is another example of the director taking the contradictory and making it cohesive. It would seem unlikely that those untrained in the craft of acting would be able to aptly portray such subtlety, humor, love and pathos yet there it is, captured on film for all to see.Beasts of the Southern Wild is a film that will simultaneously break, mend, and uplift your heart.

These people live in a surreal sort of world where they seem to not only survive but thrive on their natural surroundings and the trash of civilization. Their lifestyle is actually fairly reminiscent of many takes on post-apocalyptic storylines. So really, anyone reading this review should have access to a computer and, therefore, be light years ahead of the good people of this movie and be largely unable to relate. Or so I assume.I've stated before that I'm pretty good at watching movie trailers, and I'll still stand by that claim. But every once in a while, my skills will fail me, and various other factors will lead to my expectations of a movie being fairly different from the movie itself. This is one of those occasions. Specifically, the trailer and synopsis for Beasts lead one to believe that it is a much more fantastical film than it ends up being. With the exception of one part of the story, nearly every bit of it ends up being pretty firmly grounded in (a somewhat harsh) reality. It didn't help my opinion of the movie much that I thought the acting of 9-year-old Quvenzhane Wallis didn't strike me as any better than ""decent"" for a girl of her age, despite all of the rave reviews I had heard to the contrary.Why you should see it:While I don't anticipate any one of you being able to empathize all that strongly with the living squalor in which the protagonist of this film finds herself, I do imagine some of you can relate to her loss of a parent. Though I hope for your sake that you can't relate to her losing a parent and then having to deal with the other parent becoming seriously ill.The metaphorical nature of the storytelling upon which Beasts is built is fairly evocative, with the world of a little girl literally coming apart while she has to deal with her father's illness. I can only imagine what it would be like to go through such a situation, but I don't believe it would be much different from how it is portrayed in the movie. In figurative terms, at least. I rather doubt that if I had, at any point, lost my parents, it would have been in the shambles that these people consider their homes.In Short:Beasts of the Southern Wild is as straightforward a coming of age tale as you can get while still involving the backward people of the Louisiana Bayou and mythological prehistoric beasts. The metaphor is effective, if not terribly complex, and it results in a quaint tale of a little girl's struggle with her particular lot in life. I rated it a 7 out of 10 for its successes despite its relative simplicity, and will recommend it as worth watching once, though I don't expect it to leave any powerfully lasting impressions.Exceptions to the recommendation:- if thick accents lead would lead you to turning on subtitles if only you didn't hate reading your movies;- if you suffer from hydrophobia;- if you suffer from cryptozoophobia;- if you suffer from parthenophobia;- or, more simply, if you prefer your women (particularly your pre-pubescent women) to be of the more passive variety;- people who struggle enough with the parents who haven't left them.",3,"Pleasant, If Less Fantastical Than Expected",1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3994,"['Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'relating', 'poor', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'might', 'struggle', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'poor', 'people', 'can', 'only', 'afford', 'feature', 'phone', 'instead', 'smart', 'phone', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'poor', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'shop', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'Wal-mart', ""'m"", 'talking', 'poor', 'people', 'sense', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'feature', 'phones', 'Wal-mart', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'were', 'taught', 'other', 'language', 'tykes', ""'m"", 'talking', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'are', 'physically', 'incapable', 'getting', 'words', 'English', 'horribly', 'creole', 'lips.The', 'setting', 'film', 'place', 'called', 'Bathtub', 'fictional', 'neighborhood', 'just', 'levees', 'protect', 'New', 'Orleans', 'flooding', 'people', 'live', 'surreal', 'sort', 'world', 'where', 'seem', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'thrive', 'natural', 'surroundings', 'trash', 'civilization', 'lifestyle', 'actually', 'fairly', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'post-apocalyptic', 'storylines', 'So', 'really', 'anyone', 'reading', 'review', 'should', 'have', 'access', 'computer', 'therefore', 'be', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'good', 'people', 'movie', 'be', 'largely', 'unable', 'relate', 'so', 'assume.I', ""'ve"", 'stated', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'good', 'watching', 'movie', 'trailers', ""'ll"", 'still', 'stand', 'claim', 'once', 'while', 'skills', 'will', 'fail', 'various', 'other', 'factors', 'will', 'lead', 'expectations', 'movie', 'being', 'fairly', 'different', 'movie', 'one', 'occasions', 'Specifically', 'trailer', 'synopsis', 'Beasts', 'lead', 'one', 'believe', 'much', 'more', 'fantastical', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'exception', 'one', 'part', 'story', 'nearly', 'bit', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'somewhat', 'harsh', 'reality', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'opinion', 'movie', 'much', 'thought', 'acting', '9-year-old', 'Quvenzhane', 'Wallis', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'better', 'decent', 'girl', 'age', 'rave', 'reviews', 'had', 'heard', 'contrary.Why', 'should', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'one', 'being', 'able', 'empathize', 'strongly', 'living', 'squalor', 'protagonist', 'film', 'do', 'imagine', 'can', 'relate', 'loss', 'parent', 'hope', 'sake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'losing', 'parent', 'then', 'having', 'deal', 'other', 'parent', 'becoming', 'seriously', 'ill.The', 'metaphorical', 'nature', 'storytelling', 'Beasts', 'built', 'fairly', 'evocative', 'world', 'little', 'girl', 'literally', 'coming', 'apart', 'deal', 'father', 'illness', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'go', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'different', 'how', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'figurative', 'terms', 'least', 'rather', 'doubt', 'had', 'point', 'lost', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shambles', 'people', 'consider', 'homes.In', 'Short', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'as', 'straightforward', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'can', 'get', 'still', 'involving', 'backward', 'people', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou', 'mythological', 'prehistoric', 'beasts', 'metaphor', 'effective', 'not', 'terribly', 'complex', 'results', 'quaint', 'tale', 'little', 'girl', 'struggle', 'particular', 'lot', 'life', 'rated', '7', '10', 'successes', 'relative', 'simplicity', 'will', 'recommend', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'leave', 'powerfully', 'lasting', 'impressions.Exceptions', 'recommendation', 'thick', 'accents', 'lead', 'would', 'lead', 'turning', 'subtitles', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'reading', 'movies', 'suffer', 'hydrophobia', 'suffer', 'cryptozoophobia', 'suffer', 'parthenophobia', 'more', 'simply', 'prefer', 'women', 'particularly', 'pre-pubescent', 'women', 'be', 'more', 'passive', 'variety', 'people', 'who', 'struggle', 'enough', 'parents', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'left']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541716,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008220AGC,Brian Driver,"[0, 1]","At some point, anyone who watches this wonderful film is going to have to make a decision: what part of this is straightforward storytelling, and what part of this is fantasy?""The Beasts of the Southern Wild"" cannot really be said to be 100 percent one or the other.To simply suggest it is an allegory of how some of the extremely rural Louisiana bayou people (prophetically called ""The Bathtub"") survived a massive storm would be simplistic.  But to think that it tells a literal story would be just as incorrect.  The answer lies in young nine-year old Hushpuppy's visions--are they fantasies?  Are they prophetic?  And what part of what we are viewing is supposed to be ""real""?For it is Hushpuppy (played flawlessly by Quvenzhane Wallis, the youngest person ever nominated for an Oscar) who forms the nucleus of ""Beasts,"" and it is her visions that create strange diversions from the narration.  Spurred on by the words of a Bathtub woman named Miss Bathsheba--who taught them about cave drawings of prehistoric man, and mysterious, marauding beasts called the Aurochs--these fantasies were as much inspiration as they were a retreat from fear.On one hand it can be inferred that these visions denote a vast, End Time-like destruction--coming at the hands of global warming, the melting of the ice caps, and the release of these fearsome, wild Aurochs (giant, tusked boar-like creatures the size of elephants), or it may simply be that they represent childhood fantasies at work in her overactive imagination, a mental counterpart to the destruction of not only ""The Bathtub,"" but perhaps the place of her father in her world as well.To be sure, Hushpuppy spends a lot of her life on her own, cradled by her supra-natural bond with the creatures of the bayou.  That she is constantly looking for her much-absent father is interesting, as she is evidently frightened of him as well.  Her father Wink (played by Dwight Henry) is a mess, less often helpful than he is abusive, and prone to drunken rage: ""Don't yo look at me!  Don't yo look at me! How m'I `posed to sleep yo lookin at me!"" Though he often says, ""I got it under control,"" there is rarely a time where anything he does makes the least amount of sense--at one point, as a peace offering, he actually makes his daughter drink alcohol with him.One can understand the mixture of emotions he evokes in her: at one point she screams at him, ""I hope you die, and when yo die I go to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself""Spurred on by the teachings of a Bathtub woman named Miss Bathsheba--who taught them about cave drawings of the prehistoric man (as well as the Aurochs)--Hushpuppy is frequently seen creating her own ""cave drawings"" as well.  This by itself is not surprising...she is an impressionable child, after all.  But it is of interest that Hushpuppy draws them because she has visions of the demise of the Bathtub (at least): ""One day I see the things I made flyin all around,"" she says.  ""When I die, the scientists of the future, they can find it all.""In fact, one wonders if the community isn't also a bit delusional, given their destitute lives and garbage-can homes they cling to like a second skin.  Their impoverishment is monumental, but they manage, and to them this world of theirs is their Eden, the life they want. One might argue that the impoverishment of these people is monumental, but ""Beasts"" paints them as citizens of their form of Utopia, living their own particular Life of Plenty.  Whether this, too, is a fantasy--this time on the part of the whole community--is also up for grabs.What IS true, though, is that this magical, mystical movie is both moving and interpretive, and will mean many things to many people.  Certainly, one thing that most will agree on is the remarkable performance of Quvenzhane Wallis, an amazing find who will move you with her haunting eyes and manner, as piercing and unforgettable as her scream.

The Oscar nominated(Best Actress) Quvenzhane Wallis who played the girl is superb, as well as his father played by a local shopkeeper.The script, the direction, the production design, the music and the acting (by mostly non-professionals) are of the highest order.It is obvious that the finished film is a labor of love by all of those involved.Arguably one of the best if not the best film of 2012/13.",5,"Magical, Lyrical, Poetic-An Amazing Film",1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1309,"['group', 'young', 'filmmakers', 'technicians', 'lead', 'young', 'film', 'director', 'named', 'Benh', 'Zeitlin', 'gathered', 'coastal', 'area', 'Louisiana', 'spent', 'months', 'film', 'pre-production', 'works', 'searching', 'right', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'local', 'non-professionals.The', 'result', 'astonishing', 'slightly', 'mind', 'blowing', 'independent', 'film', 'highest', 'quality.The', 'story', 'tells', 'band', 'ragtag', 'yet', 'proud', 'residents', 'Louisiana', 'coastal', 'region', 'living', 'ramshackle', 'living', 'quarters', 'levee', 'government', 'warnings', 'subsisted', 'meager', 'daily', 'group', 'was', '6', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'nicknamed', ""'Hushpuppy"", 'living', 'ailing', 'half', 'crazed', 'father.Her', 'mother', 'was', 'long', 'gone/disappeared', 'was', 'girl', 'quest', 'seek', 'out', 'wayward', 'mother.The', 'film', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'stage', 'play.The', 'result', 'magical', 'lyrical', 'poetic', 'amazing', 'film', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Quvenzhane', 'Wallis', 'who', 'played', 'girl', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'played', 'local', 'shopkeeper.The', 'script', 'direction', 'production', 'design', 'music', 'acting', 'mostly', 'non-professionals', 'are', 'highest', 'order.It', 'obvious', 'finished', 'film', 'labor', 'love', 'involved.Arguably', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'film', '2012/13']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

It has immediate impact as the viewer is engaged in the life of a little African American girl in what are probably the swamplands of Louisiana. The story can certainly be taken on several levels as it reveals a rich tapestry of experiences on the edge of civilization. It is the story of little Hushpuppy and her marginally sane father. But it is the brilliance of the production that it is simultaneously the story of the end of coastal towns due to global warming and the story of little Hushpuppy facing the fear of abandonment, symbolized by giant beasts that have emerged from the thawing glaciers of the far north. The film is engaging from start to finish and is an excellent family film despite some slight sexual suggestions. The reason I recommend this film to families is that it deals with a very real fear of most children, the fear of losing parents and being alone in the world. Any parent would want to prepare their child to survive in the event of the tragic loss of a parent or a natural disaster. Hushpuppy's father is far from the ideal father but he does the best he can, which in the end is all we can ask of any parent.

However, as the film progressed the plot emerged. Seen through the eyes of a six year old girl named Hushpuppy, the viewer enters her environment that is primitive and hidden from mainstream society. She and her father Wink live in a coastal area known as the Bathtub. They play a waiting game with nature; the inevitability of flooding is always with them. They and their neighbors live in severe poverty, but communally they are tied to the only home they have ever known and shun the ugliness of society and progress. A monumental storm with the ferocity of Katrina hits and they see their home destroyed as well as the homes of their neighbors. Compounding an already dire situation, Wink is sick and plagued with seizures. Hushpuppy's mother is not with the family, but is present to her daughter as a distant light. Hushpuppy manages to survive a multitude of adversities as the movie plays with themes such as a vanishing way of life, resilience, and determination.The way this film is photographed shifts between an almost bitter reality and a dreamlike state. Nature is portrayed at its cruelest but is also seen as beautiful and wild. The film also portrays the mistrust the residents of the wild have for traditional society which they see as the interloper taking away their way of life and their existence.Hushpuppy drives the film as everything is perceived from her point of view. She deals with the inevitable death of her father with a child's stoicism while she yearns for the mother she has never known.Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis portrays Hushpuppy and delivers an astonishishing performance that is deep and heartbreaking.

1541742,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B008220AGC,CriticNic,"[1, 3]","The opening scene of Beasts of the Southern Wild is one of the best I've seen lately. Immediately we're introduced to Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis), a curious and adventurous 6 year old who plays with animals around her shack within a bayou community. Her father, Wink (Dwight Henry) yells ""Put your pants on man!"" to her, and soon after calling her in for ""feed up time."" Later on the whole community takes part in a party full of music, grub, and fireworks. It's a strange yet beautiful opening scene that shows a different world, but one that we suddenly want to know more about.The rustic and fascinating community is soon shaken up as a giant storm threatens their livelihoods. Having seen Katrina, and more recently Sandy, the storm as well as the theories for its cause, is all too familiar to today's society. The writers put a unique spin on the tragedy however, most notably the arrival of aurochs (ancient giant cattle) who begin to emerge after the melting ice caps come crashing down with the storm.As if the storm wasn't enough, Hushpuppy comes to the realization that her father has become quite ill. This forces her to become ""the man"" as her father puts it, and she does so fearlessly. The six year old, though scared of what lies ahead, takes it all head-on. Through the storm and the journey thereafter, she put through a series of events that test her strength and prepare her for the world. Through love she finds that she can handle anything.The film had me sucked in from the get-go. The scenes were almost magical at times, while being emotional, funny, and serious all at the same time. Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis steals the show with her powerhouse performance as Hushpuppy. If you forget for a moment that you're watching a movie, you'd believe she is Hushpuppy. The supporting cast is just as fantastic and make the community seem all the more real.I did feel, however, that the film drifted off a little towards the end. The runtime may have been a little too long for the story material, but even so there was always something interesting happening on screen. There are a few strange scenes that push the boundaries between imagination and reality that really get the viewer thinking, and there are plenty of colorful characters to observe. Then towards the ending there are some very powerful and moving scenes that bring back the same magic that the introduction brought.Though I had the fear of losing interest during at least one point of the film, I give high praise to this film for its unique manner of storytelling and tragic yet beautiful atmosphere. I ended up loving this movie, everything from the world it depicts to its characters. The feeling a film gives you is much more important than how much it entertains you, and this film gave me a lot to feel as well as think about.Source: criticnic.com 27 November 2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",4,Very unique experience,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,2904,"['opening', 'scene', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'Immediately', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Hushpuppy', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'curious', 'adventurous', '6', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'animals', 'shack', 'bayou', 'community', 'father', 'Wink', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'Put', 'pants', 'man', 'soon', 'calling', 'feed', 'up', 'time', 'Later', 'whole', 'community', 'part', 'party', 'full', 'music', 'grub', 'fireworks', 'strange', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'scene', 'different', 'world', 'one', 'suddenly', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'about.The', 'rustic', 'fascinating', 'community', 'soon', 'shaken', 'up', 'giant', 'storm', 'livelihoods', 'Having', 'seen', 'Katrina', 'more', 'recently', 'Sandy', 'storm', 'as', 'well', 'theories', 'cause', 'too', 'familiar', 'today', 'society', 'writers', 'put', 'unique', 'spin', 'tragedy', 'however', 'most', 'notably', 'arrival', 'aurochs', 'ancient', 'giant', 'cattle', 'who', 'begin', 'emerge', 'melting', 'ice', 'caps', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'storm.As', 'storm', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Hushpuppy', 'realization', 'father', 'become', 'quite', 'ill', 'become', 'man', 'father', 'so', 'fearlessly', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'though', 'scared', 'what', 'ahead', 'head-on', 'storm', 'journey', 'thereafter', 'put', 'series', 'events', 'test', 'strength', 'prepare', 'world', 'love', 'can', 'handle', 'anything.The', 'film', 'had', 'sucked', 'get-go', 'scenes', 'were', 'almost', 'magical', 'times', 'being', 'emotional', 'funny', 'serious', 'same', 'time', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'show', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'Hushpuppy', 'forget', 'moment', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'believe', 'Hushpuppy', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'fantastic', 'make', 'community', 'seem', 'more', 'real.I', 'did', 'feel', 'however', 'film', 'drifted', 'off', 'little', 'end', 'runtime', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'story', 'material', 'even', 'so', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'interesting', 'happening', 'screen', 'are', 'few', 'strange', 'scenes', 'push', 'boundaries', 'imagination', 'reality', 'really', 'get', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'are', 'plenty', 'colorful', 'characters', 'observe', 'Then', 'ending', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'moving', 'scenes', 'bring', 'back', 'same', 'magic', 'introduction', 'had', 'fear', 'losing', 'interest', 'least', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'give', 'high', 'praise', 'film', 'unique', 'manner', 'storytelling', 'tragic', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'atmosphere', 'ended', 'up', 'loving', 'movie', 'everything', 'world', 'characters', 'feeling', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'gave', 'lot', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'about.Source', 'criticnic.com', '27', 'November', '2012Disclosure', 'Film', 'sent', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox']",Beasts of the Southern Wild
1541743,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008220AGC,C. Sawin,"[5, 9]","Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis makes ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" her film. You follow her right from the very beginning and her narration instantly captures the thought process of the average little boy or girl. ""Average"" isn't the right word for it though. Hushpuppy's life is pretty extraordinary given the circumstances. The way she has to listen to every creature's heartbeat was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire film. Her explanations, quandaries, and conclusions that she makes throughout the film hit you much harder than you expect a six-year-old's demeanor to.Dwight Henry delivers a great performance, as well. Wink is very selfish, angers easily, and is out of control for most of the picture despite claiming otherwise. He has this tough love thing going on with Hushpuppy and he only wants what's best for his daughter even if his actions in the meantime seem to suggest otherwise. Their chemistry is the foundation of the film.The score is spectacular, as well. It's so minimal most of the time and is usually just a combination of strings, piano, and a simple drum beat but it throws in banjos, washboards, and whatever else you'd expect from New Orleans type music. It just captured the tone of the film perfectly.Many of the film's issues seem like they could've been resolved so simply if the characters weren't so stubborn, especially when it comes to whether or not to leave ""The Bathtub"" and Wink's illness. Obviously that more than likely would've altered the message the film was trying to give, but it's incredibly frustrating seeing characters in a film struggle with something when the solution is lingering right under their noses.The camera work was also distracting more often than not, especially in the first half of the film. Shots are purposely blurry and out of focus for long periods of time and while it was probably done to add some sort of artistic value to the film, that inner voice of yours will be screaming, ""FOCUS!"" after the first few times you experience it.The message the film gives is an incredible one; facing your fears, overcoming difficult odds, accepting death, something along those lines. The way ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" goes about portraying that message is a bit off-kilter. The Aurochs mostly come off as unnecessary and their final scene is a bit of a letdown. What they represent is one of the driving factors of the film, but they just feel out of place more often than not. Here's a sequence of people struggling to survive a flooded environment where all their sources of food have died out and here's a contrasting shot where giant, mutant boars are running across the countryside and eating each other.""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" features some exceptional, layered characters the likes of which film rarely sees, strong performances from its lead actors, an impressive score, and has a pretty powerful message. The down side is it's portrayed in this really askew and artistic light that you'll either love or hate. Whether or not you enjoyed ""The Tree of Life,"" will probably be a factor. There are definitely things to enjoy in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" but overall it just comes off as bittersweet.

1541744,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B008220AGC,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[2, 2]","An independent film that burst on the scene, Beasts of the Southern Wild is a harrowing depiction of life in an impoverished, deep southern community.  It focuses on how an isolated town responds to a disaster and, in particular, one little girl who sees the world through a prism.  A little gem of a film, it boasts superior performances by an amateur cast.In the Bayou country (and narrated from her point of view), a rebellious, young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis), has a very personalized vision of life in her world where there is a natural order of humans and wild, prehistoric beasts who rule the land.  Abandoned by her mother, her angry and sometime abusive father, Wink (Dwight Henry), is the only family who is there to care for her.  When not drinking to excess, he encourages her to hone her survival skills in the wild.  The two share an extremely poor existence living in rundown shacks and sharing camaraderie with other locals.  As a prophesied, destructive flood uproots everyone's lives, she must learn to survive and grow up fast.  When personal tragedy strikes, she must come to terms with her family and her place in the world.Shooting on location in the rural south has a colorful flavor and adds to the film's realism.  Using amateurs in the key roles makes the film authentic, and Wallis is the revelation here.  In a role that would be challenging for a teenager, she shines, and never once do you think that this is a performance by an actor.  Henry interacts wonderfully with her as the troubled father, and his was perhaps an overlooked, award worthy role.It shows how a way of life can be changed forever when disaster strikes and how people respond to the major changes in their lives.  The tight knit community has character and a closeness that transcends natural disasters and personal loss.  They come together to help one another.  Although Wink is stern and an alcoholic, he still teaches Hushpuppy the lessons in life and the art of survival in the wild.  His rage and health problems are belied by the love for his daughter.  Perhaps that's the only way he can show her his love until the bittersweet end.There is a surreal sequence where Hushpuppy and her friends make a trek to a distant bar where they meet a gregarious collection of seafarers, barflies and hookers.  It is there she is befriended by a woman who cooks her a meal.  Could this be her mother?  The final scene between Hushpuppy and Wink is a touching moment of truth that distills all that has transpired before and reinforces their relationship. Despite all the hardships and conflict, there is ultimately the love of a father and daughter.With mythical and allegorical overtones, this is a spiritual film that must be experienced to appreciate its unique take on a slice of the world as seen through the eyes of a girl whose fascination with how the universe works and her desire to leave her mark on the world is only exceeded by her love for her father and `family'.",4,A Child's Bond in BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,2995,"['independent', 'film', 'scene', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'harrowing', 'depiction', 'life', 'impoverished', 'deep', 'southern', 'community', 'how', 'isolated', 'town', 'responds', 'disaster', 'particular', 'one', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'world', 'prism', 'little', 'gem', 'film', 'superior', 'performances', 'amateur', 'cast.In', 'Bayou', 'country', 'narrated', 'point', 'view', 'rebellious', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Hushpuppy', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'very', 'personalized', 'vision', 'life', 'world', 'where', 'natural', 'order', 'humans', 'wild', 'prehistoric', 'beasts', 'who', 'rule', 'land', 'Abandoned', 'mother', 'angry', 'sometime', 'abusive', 'father', 'Wink', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'only', 'family', 'who', 'there', 'care', 'When', 'not', 'drinking', 'excess', 'hone', 'survival', 'skills', 'wild', 'two', 'share', 'extremely', 'poor', 'existence', 'living', 'rundown', 'shacks', 'sharing', 'camaraderie', 'other', 'locals', 'prophesied', 'destructive', 'flood', 'everyone', 'lives', 'must', 'learn', 'survive', 'grow', 'up', 'fast', 'When', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'family', 'place', 'world.Shooting', 'location', 'rural', 'south', 'colorful', 'flavor', 'film', 'realism', 'Using', 'amateurs', 'key', 'roles', 'film', 'authentic', 'Wallis', 'revelation', 'here', 'role', 'would', 'be', 'challenging', 'teenager', 'never', 'once', 'do', 'think', 'performance', 'actor', 'Henry', 'wonderfully', 'troubled', 'father', 'was', 'perhaps', 'overlooked', 'award', 'worthy', 'role.It', 'how', 'way', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'forever', 'when', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'how', 'people', 'respond', 'major', 'changes', 'lives', 'tight', 'knit', 'community', 'character', 'closeness', 'natural', 'disasters', 'personal', 'loss', 'come', 'together', 'help', 'one', 'Wink', 'stern', 'alcoholic', 'still', 'Hushpuppy', 'lessons', 'life', 'art', 'survival', 'wild', 'rage', 'health', 'problems', 'are', 'belied', 'love', 'daughter', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'show', 'love', 'bittersweet', 'surreal', 'sequence', 'where', 'Hushpuppy', 'friends', 'make', 'trek', 'distant', 'bar', 'where', 'meet', 'gregarious', 'collection', 'seafarers', 'barflies', 'hookers', 'there', 'befriended', 'woman', 'who', 'meal', 'Could', 'be', 'mother', 'final', 'scene', 'Hushpuppy', 'Wink', 'touching', 'moment', 'truth', 'transpired', 'reinforces', 'relationship', 'hardships', 'conflict', 'ultimately', 'love', 'father', 'daughter.With', 'mythical', 'allegorical', 'overtones', 'spiritual', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'experienced', 'appreciate', 'unique', 'take', 'slice', 'world', 'seen', 'eyes', 'girl', 'fascination', 'how', 'universe', 'works', 'desire', 'leave', 'mark', 'world', 'only', 'exceeded', 'love', 'father', 'family']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541747,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B008220AGC,David Baldwin,"[3, 4]","I think those who dismiss this film as another film about poverty are missing the point.  This film demonstrates that one can be happy and strong despite living in less than ideal surroundings.  The film focuses on a six year old girl, Hushpuppy(Quvenzhane Wallis) who lives in a ramshackle shack with her father on an island in the Louisiana gulf called the Bathtub.  It isn't really explained but Hushpuppy's mother is absent and her father (Dwight Henry), though hardworking, likes to tip the bottle.  This requires resilliance and strong intestinal fortitude for Hushpuppy to perservere and she is up to the challenge.  A hurricane hits the region putting the residents of the Bathtub in chaos and Hushpuppy is forced to dip even further into her reserve but also tend to her sick father.  ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a wonderful film with a central performance by Wallis that is monumental not just for her tender age but for an actress of any age.

1541748,A391RY3TA1MCVM,B008220AGC,David Ljunggren,"[8, 14]","Beasts of the Southern Wild shows us what happens to the isolated rundown community called the Bathtub, which sits precariously in the waters off New Orleans. Society has pretty much forgotten the area and its inhabitants, who live in slum-like shacks, appear never to wash and also drink far too much. Right away we have the first challenge for the director: these folk are not particularly attractive or interesting. Why should we care what happens to them? We see most of the action through the ideas of six-year-old Hushpuppy, who lives in squalor with her increasingly sick father. She is for some reason fascinated by the giant and extinct auroch, a cow-like beast which lived in prehistoric times and an animal she associates with great and unpleasant changes.Talking of which ... a great Katrina-like storm pounds the area and the flood waters start to rise. In desperation Hushpuppy and her father set off in their ramshackle boat and look for other survivors. It's at this moment the movie slips off into a state bordering on incoherence. Even though we're clearly watching a fable-cum-fantasy, it still has to obey the basic rules of film-making, one of which is ""Try to make sense at least some of the time"". A stuffed crocodile packed with dynamite makes an appearance, and then a crazy man on an even more ramshackle boat takes Hushpuppy and a few young pals to a bizarre dance club where scantily-dressed women pirouette with the kids. Fellini might have got away with this but that's because he was Fellini. Handled by another lesser director, it only serves to irritate and confuse.The authorities intervene and take the Bathtub's survivors to a high-school cum hospital, where they feel miserable and soon manage to escape. By now the film is really making little sense and we are not helped when the aurochs make an appearance. The aurochs were cows, yet the film maker uses dressed up Vietnamese pigs instead, and this adds to the confusion. Pigs are not cows, people. This film was a disappointment. Yes, I know it's meant to be an allegory and a fantasy, but even so, it needed a better script and a more interesting set of characters.",3,"Interesting idea, but lapses into incoherence",1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,2157,"['Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'what', 'isolated', 'rundown', 'community', 'called', 'Bathtub', 'precariously', 'waters', 'off', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Society', 'pretty', 'much', 'forgotten', 'area', 'inhabitants', 'who', 'live', 'slum-like', 'shacks', 'appear', 'never', 'wash', 'also', 'drink', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Right', 'away', 'have', 'first', 'challenge', 'director', 'folk', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'interesting', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'what', 'see', 'most', 'action', 'ideas', 'six-year-old', 'Hushpuppy', 'who', 'squalor', 'increasingly', 'sick', 'father', 'reason', 'fascinated', 'giant', 'extinct', 'auroch', 'cow-like', 'beast', 'lived', 'prehistoric', 'times', 'animal', 'great', 'unpleasant', 'changes.Talking', 'great', 'Katrina-like', 'storm', 'area', 'flood', 'waters', 'start', 'rise', 'desperation', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'set', 'off', 'ramshackle', 'boat', 'look', 'other', 'survivors', 'moment', 'movie', 'off', 'state', 'bordering', 'incoherence', 'Even', ""'re"", 'clearly', 'watching', 'fable-cum-fantasy', 'still', 'obey', 'basic', 'rules', 'film-making', 'one', 'Try', 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'time', 'stuffed', 'crocodile', 'packed', 'dynamite', 'appearance', 'then', 'crazy', 'man', 'even', 'more', 'ramshackle', 'boat', 'Hushpuppy', 'few', 'young', 'pals', 'bizarre', 'dance', 'club', 'where', 'scantily-dressed', 'women', 'pirouette', 'kids', 'Fellini', 'might', 'have', 'got', 'away', 'was', 'Fellini', 'Handled', 'lesser', 'director', 'only', 'irritate', 'confuse.The', 'authorities', 'intervene', 'take', 'Bathtub', 'survivors', 'high-school', 'cum', 'hospital', 'where', 'feel', 'miserable', 'soon', 'manage', 'escape', 'now', 'film', 'really', 'making', 'little', 'sense', 'are', 'not', 'helped', 'when', 'aurochs', 'make', 'appearance', 'aurochs', 'were', 'cows', 'yet', 'film', 'maker', 'dressed', 'up', 'Vietnamese', 'pigs', 'instead', 'confusion', 'Pigs', 'are', 'not', 'cows', 'people', 'film', 'was', 'disappointment', 'Yes', 'know', 'meant', 'be', 'allegory', 'fantasy', 'even', 'so', 'needed', 'better', 'script', 'more', 'interesting', 'set', 'characters']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541756,A144BX2IT6AQAL,B008220AGC,Desdimona,"[2, 2]","This film is well made: the visuals are awesome, the soundtrack good, the props perfect, the acting stellar, the pace pitch perfect, it kept my interest, and the overall vision of the filmmaking process is sound.  And yet, I don't like this film.  I don't believe the lives depicted.  I think the characters come right out of someone's imagination and that those characters are alien to the people who live in any kind of place or way in reality, which is depicted as ""the bathtub"" in this film.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't read past here.  Spoiler Alert!!!!!!!!!  I'm about to critique serious plot pieces to this film.The squalor and lack of pride of place that is depicted strikes me as how an outsider would see a world ""off the grid"" and in poverty, such as the Bathtub.  For example the film has a scene where food is just poured on the floor for children to eat who are under a table.  Being from the South I have seen a lot of ""casual"" dining.  Not everyone turns to Martha Stewart for tips.  If there is a pit or grill folks get it going without a lot of fuss, but no paper laid on the floor first, not even a paper bag?  This is my point.  The film shows us foreigners to our cultivated society in America, foreigners who are unquestionably American.  But how it depicts these foreign folks turns them into ""beasts of the southern wild,"" and in the process minimizes their humanity, which absolutely exists even in ""off the grid"" communities that are different from the mainstream.Of course those folks would lay paper down for their children to eat off of, especially after a disaster like Katrina.  But what if there was no paper around?  Then the eating place for those children would have been prepared as best they could.  Even if these folks are ""beasts"" like the beautiful beasts of this world, beasts still have pride of place.  You may see a cat nest and think it is squalor, but believe it, those cats do not think so.  They have prepared, with care I would stress, that place.  And a film about ""beasts"" that really gets them, unless the film is purposely showing a breakdown in the inner workings of these ""beasts,"" has to show that care, that pride of place, even as it simultaneously shows us pride of place which is different from our accepted version.  But this film doesn't.  It keeps a foreigner's eye.  It depicts the Bathtub inhabitants ""lacking"" pride of place in order to show ""difference"" in pride of place.  This is repeated throughout the film in shocking ways.And a scene where the Bathtub inhabitants blow up the levee is simply gross.  Why is that in this film?  It would HAVE to be seven years (by DVD release date) since Katrina for a film to take a bold, hurtful, and fanciful step like suggesting that poor people, the same ones by demographic that the systems and norms of our country left to die (it's true), are actually the ones that caused those levees to break in the first place.  This is irresponsible to the point of being monstrous.  The work that this depiction does is to lay most of Katrina's damage at the feet of the population most killed by Katrina.  This is the exact opposite of real life.  The breaking of those levees caused, some say, the majority of the filth and disease and damage from Katrina.  And there was bureaucratic and political breakdown that caused the levees to be as unstable and inadequate as they were.  And that Bureaucratic and political breakdown was as far removed from the populations that the Bathtub depicts as you can get because those populations didn't have any power, bureaucratic or political.So when this film depicts that event, and then LAYS IT at the feet of the very population the Bathtub residents would be a part of in real life, I wonder why and how the filmmakers could or would do that.The filmmakers seem to be telling a myth about the human experience.  But the issues I have described cause that myth to get bogged down in the mud of our very real American culture with its blindnesses and fear of telling the truth.  This film has many merits, but it is also painful in many ways.",3,I Don't Like This Movie,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,4095,"['film', 'well', 'made', 'visuals', 'are', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'good', 'props', 'perfect', 'acting', 'stellar', 'pace', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'kept', 'interest', 'overall', 'vision', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'sound', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lives', 'depicted', 'think', 'characters', 'come', 'right', 'someone', 'imagination', 'characters', 'are', 'alien', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'kind', 'place', 'way', 'reality', 'depicted', 'bathtub', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'past', 'here', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', ""'m"", 'critique', 'serious', 'plot', 'pieces', 'film.The', 'squalor', 'lack', 'pride', 'place', 'depicted', 'strikes', 'how', 'outsider', 'would', 'see', 'world', 'grid', 'poverty', 'such', 'Bathtub', 'example', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'food', 'just', 'poured', 'floor', 'children', 'eat', 'who', 'are', 'table', 'Being', 'South', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'casual', 'dining', 'Not', 'everyone', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'tips', 'pit', 'grill', 'folks', 'get', 'going', 'lot', 'fuss', 'paper', 'laid', 'floor', 'first', 'not', 'even', 'paper', 'bag', 'point', 'film', 'foreigners', 'cultivated', 'society', 'America', 'foreigners', 'who', 'are', 'unquestionably', 'American', 'how', 'foreign', 'folks', 'beasts', 'southern', 'wild', 'process', 'humanity', 'absolutely', 'even', 'grid', 'communities', 'are', 'different', 'mainstream.Of', 'course', 'folks', 'would', 'lay', 'paper', 'children', 'eat', 'especially', 'disaster', 'Katrina', 'what', 'was', 'paper', 'around', 'Then', 'eating', 'place', 'children', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'best', 'could', 'Even', 'folks', 'are', 'beasts', 'beautiful', 'beasts', 'world', 'beasts', 'still', 'have', 'pride', 'place', 'may', 'see', 'cat', 'nest', 'think', 'squalor', 'believe', 'cats', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'have', 'prepared', 'care', 'would', 'stress', 'place', 'film', 'beasts', 'really', 'film', 'purposely', 'showing', 'breakdown', 'inner', 'workings', 'beasts', 'show', 'care', 'pride', 'place', 'even', 'simultaneously', 'place', 'different', 'accepted', 'version', 'film', ""n't"", 'foreigner', 'eye', 'Bathtub', 'inhabitants', 'lacking', 'pride', 'place', 'order', 'show', 'difference', 'pride', 'place', 'repeated', 'film', 'shocking', 'scene', 'where', 'Bathtub', 'inhabitants', 'blow', 'up', 'levee', 'simply', 'gross', 'Why', 'film', 'would', 'HAVE', 'be', 'seven', 'years', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'Katrina', 'film', 'take', 'bold', 'hurtful', 'fanciful', 'step', 'suggesting', 'poor', 'people', 'same', 'ones', 'demographic', 'systems', 'norms', 'country', 'left', 'die', 'true', 'are', 'actually', 'ones', 'caused', 'levees', 'break', 'first', 'place', 'irresponsible', 'point', 'being', 'monstrous', 'work', 'depiction', 'lay', 'most', 'Katrina', 'damage', 'feet', 'population', 'most', 'killed', 'Katrina', 'exact', 'opposite', 'real', 'life', 'breaking', 'levees', 'caused', 'say', 'majority', 'filth', 'disease', 'damage', 'Katrina', 'was', 'bureaucratic', 'political', 'breakdown', 'caused', 'levees', 'be', 'unstable', 'inadequate', 'were', 'Bureaucratic', 'political', 'breakdown', 'was', 'far', 'removed', 'populations', 'Bathtub', 'can', 'get', 'populations', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'bureaucratic', 'political.So', 'when', 'film', 'event', 'then', 'LAYS', 'IT', 'feet', 'very', 'population', 'Bathtub', 'residents', 'would', 'be', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'wonder', 'why', 'how', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'would', 'do', 'that.The', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'be', 'telling', 'myth', 'human', 'experience', 'issues', 'have', 'described', 'cause', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'mud', 'very', 'real', 'American', 'culture', 'blindnesses', 'fear', 'telling', 'truth', 'film', 'many', 'merits', 'also', 'painful', 'many', 'ways']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541763,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B008220AGC,Doug Anderson,"[1, 4]","Beasts of the Southern Wild is a meditation on outsider status. At least it wants to be that, I think. Both the first-time director (Benh Zeitlin) and the six-year-old star are relative outsiders who will remain outsiders so long as they remain uncommitted to any single cosmic, social, or political vision. This is the unique power and vantage point of the first-time artist: he/she is unaffiliated with any one vision and so open to all. Its a compelling place to be. This film delivers you back to that very primitive and very sophisticated frame of mind, that ground where formative and transformative imagination are as essential to survival as, well, the survival instinct itself.The director sets this tale of primitive/instinctual survival in (or at least near) New Orleans for its there perhaps more than anywhere else in the US that ""outsider status"" is so integral to a place's creative identity and practices. He also sets the tale there because this city is a place that is currently re-orienting itself in regards to its relation to the mainland/mainstream society that it both courts and rejects (in equal measures). The film itself is a saavy eclectic blending of commercial and underground elements/styles/themes/characters. One of the thrills of viewing this film is that the filmgoer feels like he/she has been given access to a world/reality (or set of worlds/realities) that has heretofore been viewed by mainstream culture as inaccessible. The casting of unknowns was essential. Had the film starred Will and Willow Smith, for instance, it would not truly feel ""independent"" and ""outsider."" But even if the film had starred Will and Willow Smith there is nothing mainstream about this story of an absent mother and sometimes present, sometimes absent father trying to raise a young girl with nothing but his own sometimes inventive, sometimes self-destructive habits of body and mind. The father is no hero (by independent or mainstream standards) and, to his credit, director Zeitlin is not afraid to show the father's many failings but Zeitlin's also imaginative enough not to judge him too harshly and to provide the viewer with a glimpse of what makes such a man tick. This father is no model parent but he has plenty of imagination/spirit and a single-minded desire to live by his own terms and make his own sense of and peace with the universe (he is someone readers of William Faulkner and Toni Morrison novels will recognize). His enemy is anyone who stands in the way of his sense of place and self which are inextricably intertwined, thus some people read a political message in the film, but, to me anyway, its more a cosmic vision than a social or political one--the ""message"", if there is one, is not reducible to a commercial or campaign slogan, its more about man's attempt to belong to a place that often feels inhospitable and overhwelming. At times the father seems to thrive in the heap of chaos that he has built and calls home, at other times he seems to be losing both his battle to remain independent (its a battle every film director knows well) and his battle to tame the chaos within and without. What the father conveys to his daughter is that she must be tough enough to survive but that survival alone is meaningless unless one does so with a certain level of dignity (independence) even though the father does not always display that level of dignity.The film very much wants to be a statement of artistic independence. It both is and isn't that. The comparisons of this film to Terence Malick's Days of Heaven and Tree of Life make sense because both directors make use of young narrators whose views are largely unfiltered by ideology (or reason for that matter). Malick and Zeitlin's naive narrators still view the world with a sense of awe (which is what these directors are interested in capturing and conveying) but neither Malick nor Zeitlin tell coming-of-age stories in any conventional sense because the enemy of artistic vision/poetry, according to their respective world views, is ""coming of age."" The key to artistic vision/poetry for both directors is retaining contact with those pre-rational processes that inform a much more instinctual connection to the world/universe than the one afforded by ideology/reason/mainstream currents of thought. But this is where both Malick and Zeitlin divide audiences: They both assume that children (and animals) are purer than adults and more in touch with awe and wonder and the sublime (which is most accessible by those least indoctrinated by civilization). This assumption/cliche annoys (some) critics but appeals to mainstream audiences. Its an idea with a long history and its more than a little suspect. The films of both directors work only if you buy this central conceit. If you buy the conceit and the sublime naivete of the narrators rings true for you, the films of Malick and Zeitlin stand as authentic documents by independent, even maverick, directors who stand their own ground no matter what. If you find this central conceit unconvincing, you will not be quite as impressed.The films of Malick and this first feature by Zeitlin are attempting (with varying degrees of success) to create film poetry (using naive narrators as bridges to and deliverers of awe and wonder and ultimately the sublime) but I also suspect that both Malick and Zeitlin are populists at heart and that they want to create poetry that sells. Each director courts that popular audience in a very distinct way. Malick has the clout to attract stars (Pitt and Penn in the case of Tree of Life) and thus guarantee critical and popular attention even when his material is not commercially viable and divides both critical and popular audiences. Zeitlin, on the other hand, relies on heavy doses of humor delivered by a charismatic child actor as well as a resonant setting (a pertinent and appealing setting in the current popular imagination) to make his film commerically viable. Arguably Malick's film would have been better had it contained a bit more humor (or any sense of humor at all) for humor is what makes Beasts so much more palatable to both the critical and the general public.To me, Malick and Zeitlin are interesting because their work is compelling even though we suspect its built on untenable ground/assumptions and takes place in a largely imaginary literary space. After all Faulkner and Morrison are still considered great artists even though their own naive narrators sound more like their author than real people.Compelling cinema!",4,The Naive

1541771,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008220AGC,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","I was naturally curious to see how a nine-year-old could have landed an Oscar nomination as Best Leading Actress, and clearly director Benh Zeitlin found a gifted child in Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis, who was actually only five during filming. As Hushpuppy, she provides the precocious voice of this fascinating 2012 film that mixes a stream-of-consciousness narrative with elements of magical realism, the combination of which can be both jarring and moving at the same time. Although the story is steeped in the harsh poverty of the coastal parishes of Louisiana, the movie comes across as a fanciful parable because Zeitlin, along with co-writer Lucy Alibar (whose one-act play ""Juicy and Delicious"" provides the basis of the plot), has effectively captured something celebratory about the struggles of a community who subsists on a bayou island cut off by a levee, appropriately dubbed the ""Bathtub"".In sharp contrast to the unconditionally loving spirit shown by her neighbors, Hushpuppy's father Wink is alternately abusive and protective toward her. As it turns out, he is gravely ill and preparing her for life without him. For a novice filmmaker, Zeitlin does a surprisingly dexterous job of melding the fantastical with the realistic, although I have to admit that the periodically stampeding appearance of the long-extinct Aurochs, a primitive and much larger ancestor of today's cattle, comes across as increasingly contrived. There are similarly anomalous passages throughout the film, but what grounds the fantasy is the volatile relationship between Hushpuppy and Wink. Wallis is a captivating presence that packages a unique blend of innocence and fearlessness into a preternaturally wise child.Another non-professional, Dwight Henry, a baker by trade, turns in an unexpectedly powerful performance as Wink, bringing out the desperation of a broken man with little time to sort out his anger and fear. Credit should be given to cinematographer Ben Richardson, who brings a unity of vision in an otherwise chaotic whirl of activity, even if taking Hushpuppy's perspective means the handheld camera brings a wobbly intensity that can get a bit nerve-racking. A versatile talent, Zeitlin also co-wrote the stirring, evocative soundtrack with composer Dan Romer. Despite a handful of flaws, including a nagging similarity to Terrence Malick'sThe Tree of Life, Zeitlin has made quite a poetic allegory that could have easily missed had he not presented Hushpuppy's world the way she sees it as an adventure marked by a tenuous search for both adventure and purpose.",4,One Child's Conquest of Life's Fiercely Unpredictable Turns,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,2573,"['was', 'naturally', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'nine-year-old', 'could', 'have', 'landed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Leading', 'Actress', 'clearly', 'director', 'Benh', 'Zeitlin', 'found', 'gifted', 'child', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'five', 'filming', 'Hushpuppy', 'precocious', 'voice', 'fascinating', '2012', 'film', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'narrative', 'elements', 'magical', 'realism', 'combination', 'can', 'be', 'jarring', 'moving', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'steeped', 'harsh', 'poverty', 'coastal', 'parishes', 'Louisiana', 'movie', 'across', 'fanciful', 'parable', 'Zeitlin', 'co-writer', 'Lucy', 'Alibar', 'one-act', 'play', 'Juicy', 'Delicious', 'basis', 'plot', 'effectively', 'captured', 'something', 'celebratory', 'struggles', 'community', 'who', 'bayou', 'island', 'cut', 'off', 'levee', 'appropriately', 'dubbed', 'Bathtub', '.In', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'unconditionally', 'loving', 'spirit', 'shown', 'neighbors', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'Wink', 'alternately', 'abusive', 'protective', 'out', 'gravely', 'ill', 'preparing', 'life', 'novice', 'filmmaker', 'Zeitlin', 'surprisingly', 'dexterous', 'job', 'melding', 'fantastical', 'realistic', 'have', 'admit', 'periodically', 'stampeding', 'appearance', 'long-extinct', 'Aurochs', 'primitive', 'much', 'larger', 'ancestor', 'today', 'cattle', 'increasingly', 'contrived', 'are', 'similarly', 'anomalous', 'passages', 'film', 'what', 'fantasy', 'volatile', 'relationship', 'Hushpuppy', 'Wink', 'Wallis', 'captivating', 'presence', 'unique', 'blend', 'innocence', 'fearlessness', 'preternaturally', 'wise', 'child.Another', 'non-professional', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'baker', 'trade', 'unexpectedly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Wink', 'bringing', 'out', 'desperation', 'broken', 'man', 'little', 'time', 'sort', 'out', 'anger', 'fear', 'Credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'cinematographer', 'Ben', 'Richardson', 'who', 'unity', 'vision', 'otherwise', 'chaotic', 'whirl', 'activity', 'even', 'taking', 'Hushpuppy', 'perspective', 'handheld', 'camera', 'wobbly', 'intensity', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'nerve-racking', 'versatile', 'talent', 'Zeitlin', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'stirring', 'evocative', 'soundtrack', 'composer', 'Dan', 'Romer', 'handful', 'flaws', 'including', 'nagging', 'similarity', 'Terrence', ""Malick'sThe"", 'Tree', 'Life', 'Zeitlin', 'made', 'quite', 'poetic', 'allegory', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'missed', 'had', 'not', 'presented', 'Hushpuppy', 'world', 'way', 'adventure', 'marked', 'tenuous', 'search', 'adventure', 'purpose']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541791,A328S9RN3U5M68,B008220AGC,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Watching or rather experiencing BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD is `like looking in on another universe through a keyhole.' The film is visual poetry, illuminating a unique corner of the world and making it a mystical magic message. It could not come at a better time when all the media is FINALLY paying attention to the fact that we are destroying our planet and that we may be closer to the last days of life as we know it than we even imagine. But before this film was made there was a play by Lucy Alibar called JUICY AND DELICIOUS about a boy in Georgia who feels like the whole world is collapsing as his father is dying. Alibar and director Benh Zeitlin adapted the play to a screenplay, carrying through the same themes of loss and strength, all set in a mythical world that's as brutal as it is beautiful: it is now related through the eyes of a small girl in Bathtub, Louisiana and is about people having the courage to love and defend the people and place they call home.Hushpuppy (Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis), an undauntable six-year-old girl, lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), in the Bathtub, a southern Delta community at the edge of the world. Wink's tough love prepares her for the unraveling of the universe; for a time when he's no longer there to protect her. Real-world villains (terminal illness, indifferent authorities) and folkloric foes (an apocalyptic storm, a rampaging herd of mytho-prehistoric creatures or aurochs) prove no match for Hushpuppy, Wink, and a ragtag bunch of bayou dwellers. When Wink contracts a mysterious illness, nature flies out of whack, temperatures rise, and the ice caps melt, unleashing an army of prehistoric creatures called aurochs. With the waters rising, the aurochs coming, and hot-tempered Wink's fading health fading, Hushpuppy goes in search of her lost mother, learning the ways of the 'civilized world' beyond the intrepid levees and learns the way of courage and love.While most of the talk about this film is about the performance of Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis as Hushpuppy, though most of her `acting' is reading lines off screen with only a few moments of actually interacting with the visual story an the characters about her, The true magic of the film lie in the brilliant metaphors of the script: that is what makes this film important. Yes, the story as it unfolds before our eyes is unique and touching  and Director Zeitlin has managed to gain authoritative performances form an untrained cast (too little is written about the extraordinary performances by Dwight Henry (a pastry shop owner) and Gina Montana as Miss Bathsheba and the other actors who give the story credence by their simple honesty.  Does Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis deserve an Academy Award for this first venture by a child in a film in which she is only a part of the mission? No more so than nominating the cast as an ensemble effort.  But instead of concentrating on `the youngest actor to ever be nominated for an Oscar', best to approach this film as a prediction, more than an omen.  And for that reason it deserves high praise.

1541802,A1A535W556ROBQ,B008220AGC,James Ferguson,"[0, 1]","Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis proves that great things do come in small packages, as she delivers a bravura performance that elevates this small budget film to epic proportions.  There is a lot one could quibble over in the way of story, but the natural acting and visceral situations more than make up for the strange turns and plot holes in the script.  Benh Zeitlin and Lucy Aliber have given us a wonderful post-Katrina parable.The idea of a ""Bathtub"" community riding out Katrina and relishing the momentary embarrassment of riches that came in the way of fish is soon belied by the fact that there is no fresh water to sustain this bountiful new world.  Hushpuppy soon realizes this and seeks to find an answer to the dilemma while her father plots to blow up a levee to end their drought.The confrontations that ensue are pretty much what you would expect, but the writers keep this film floating between fantasy and reality like a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novella.  Hushpuppy and the girls go in search of their mothers, a scene that poignantly sums up their sense of desolation while at the same time giving them renewed hope.  It really is remarkable how Zeitlin was able to draw so much from these first time actors, making the story all the more compelling.The aurochs are a bit too much like Terrence Mallick's dinosaurs in The Tree of Life, but work within the world of Hushpuppy's feverish imagination, as she tries to make sense of what Miss Bathsheba has been telling her.  I found the scenes where the community is rescued and takien to a shelter a bit incongruous and hard to figure how they all so easily ended up back at the ""Bathtub,"" but I suppose Zeitlin and Aliber felt it necessary to make a connection with the outside world.

1541808,A18D87U8CUN0F9,B008220AGC,"Jason Harrington ""Trucker Hater Magazine""","[1, 3]","I hate to be a part of the over-hype squad, so I tried to wait for my enthusiasm to simmer-down, but no luck. I can't stop myself from saying this was hands-down the film of the year, for me, and possibly the greatest movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry if that makes you defensive or overly hopeful for something else, but this movie truly fired on all pistons.It is wonderful to go into a movie so blind to what I can expect. All I had heard was that there was a very young girl at the eye of a tornado of hype. I was neither prepared to love nor hate her. Neither the director nor the cast seemed to have any reputation at all beyond the center star and the controversy about her award nominations.So, we got this DVD in the mail from Netflix, and I was excited to see what all the chatter was about. We pressed play, and went on a wild ride. In the opening scenes I was still getting my bearing on the look of the Super-8 film, and what kind of genre I was experiencing. It looks like vintage Disney nature show footage, and initially you may be expecting a slower pace more typical of these up-close gritty films like Take Shelter. In many ways this was similar to that film with emotional highs and lows, except Beasts has a clearer fantasy element to it's plot, and the central character propels the film with her hopefulness like the tiniest Skywalker in the dingiest spaces imaginable.But, as I eased into the first hour, I felt increasingly drawn in and mesmerized by the story and the performances that propelled it, until I could hardly blink for fear of missing something.This movie is far from the slow crawl of most low-budget quirky indie films, as evidenced by the small group of critics calling it irresponsibly violent, etc. That perspective was more valid for the movie Drive (also a film I really liked), but while Drive collected together all the greatest scene elements from multiple classic suspense, gangster, and horror films, Beasts seems to rather break away completely and establish a new sub-genre, that pays homage to no other specific film.As far as the violence, critics are obviously referring to the abusive father, who slaps her, punches a catfish, etc. Although I had a fantastic father, two people very close to me had abusive fathers, that would leave to get wasted and show back up whenever they wanted with their hearts full of a passion for God-knows-what and a fleeting concern for everyone else, placing ridiculous people and priorities above the welfare of their family. His very real portrayal combined with the Super-8 camera look gave the film a slight documentary/reality-show/biopic quality.The presence of the giant pigs pushes the film into fantasy territory with a mostly subtle use of special effects. Some of the images of the pigs traveling were not as natural as I wanted, but when they arrived then they didn't seem quite so mechanized. That is truly the only negative I have to say about it.The plot had that George Lucas type effect of creating such an elaborate sense of purpose and symbolism to this alternate world, built out of very humanistic elements, feelings and ideas. It's easy to forget that sort of Ray Bradbury style sci-fi that is less focused on futurism, and more focused on turning a mirror to humanity with a ""what if"" scenario used to amplify and exaggerate reality until we can see it with new eyes.That being said, and despite all those great parts, this entire film is largely carried on the back of one amazingly hypnotic six year old girl. From the second she enters the frame, my eyes followed her like a cat to a laser pointer. The director was so good at getting out of her way, and keeping the camera angles shifting at a natural pace. With a script this poetic, a six year old actress this captivating, and a wildly belligerent supporting actor, it's hard to give the director the credit he deserves for stringing it all together, but he deserves all the future offers I anticipate he will receive, as will the rest of the prominent people involved, I hope.This is a masterclass in film making, script writing, acting, and plot design. I hesitate to say this, but right now I feel this may be the greatest movie of all time. It's poetry is pure and hope-filled, it's talent comes out of nowhere, and it's story design is so rich. For my tastes, this is as close to perfection as I could ever hope for.",5,Movie of the year,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,4388,"['hate', 'be', 'part', 'over-hype', 'squad', 'tried', 'wait', 'enthusiasm', 'simmer-down', 'luck', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'saying', 'was', 'hands-down', 'film', 'year', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'defensive', 'overly', 'hopeful', 'something', 'else', 'movie', 'truly', 'fired', 'pistons.It', 'wonderful', 'go', 'movie', 'so', 'blind', 'what', 'can', 'expect', 'had', 'heard', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'girl', 'eye', 'tornado', 'hype', 'was', 'neither', 'prepared', 'love', 'hate', 'director', 'cast', 'seemed', 'have', 'reputation', 'center', 'star', 'controversy', 'award', 'nominations.So', 'got', 'DVD', 'mail', 'Netflix', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'chatter', 'was', 'about', 'pressed', 'play', 'went', 'wild', 'ride', 'opening', 'scenes', 'was', 'still', 'getting', 'bearing', 'look', 'Super-8', 'film', 'what', 'kind', 'genre', 'was', 'experiencing', 'vintage', 'Disney', 'nature', 'show', 'footage', 'initially', 'may', 'be', 'expecting', 'slower', 'pace', 'more', 'typical', 'up-close', 'gritty', 'films', 'Take', 'Shelter', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'similar', 'film', 'emotional', 'highs', 'lows', 'Beasts', 'clearer', 'fantasy', 'element', 'plot', 'central', 'character', 'film', 'hopefulness', 'tiniest', 'Skywalker', 'dingiest', 'spaces', 'imaginable.But', 'eased', 'first', 'hour', 'felt', 'increasingly', 'drawn', 'mesmerized', 'story', 'performances', 'propelled', 'could', 'hardly', 'blink', 'fear', 'missing', 'something.This', 'movie', 'far', 'slow', 'crawl', 'most', 'low-budget', 'quirky', 'indie', 'films', 'evidenced', 'small', 'group', 'critics', 'calling', 'irresponsibly', 'violent', 'etc', 'perspective', 'was', 'more', 'valid', 'movie', 'Drive', 'also', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'Drive', 'collected', 'together', 'greatest', 'scene', 'elements', 'multiple', 'classic', 'suspense', 'gangster', 'horror', 'films', 'Beasts', 'rather', 'break', 'away', 'completely', 'establish', 'new', 'sub-genre', 'homage', 'other', 'specific', 'film.As', 'far', 'violence', 'critics', 'are', 'obviously', 'referring', 'abusive', 'father', 'who', 'catfish', 'etc', 'had', 'fantastic', 'father', 'two', 'people', 'very', 'close', 'had', 'abusive', 'fathers', 'would', 'leave', 'get', 'wasted', 'show', 'back', 'up', 'whenever', 'wanted', 'hearts', 'full', 'passion', 'God-knows-what', 'fleeting', 'concern', 'everyone', 'else', 'placing', 'ridiculous', 'people', 'priorities', 'welfare', 'family', 'very', 'real', 'portrayal', 'combined', 'Super-8', 'camera', 'look', 'gave', 'film', 'slight', 'documentary/reality-show/biopic', 'quality.The', 'presence', 'giant', 'pigs', 'film', 'fantasy', 'territory', 'mostly', 'subtle', 'use', 'special', 'effects', 'images', 'pigs', 'traveling', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'natural', 'wanted', 'when', 'arrived', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'so', 'mechanized', 'truly', 'only', 'negative', 'have', 'say', 'it.The', 'plot', 'had', 'George', 'Lucas', 'type', 'effect', 'creating', 'such', 'elaborate', 'sense', 'purpose', 'symbolism', 'alternate', 'world', 'built', 'very', 'humanistic', 'elements', 'feelings', 'ideas', 'easy', 'forget', 'sort', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'style', 'sci-fi', 'less', 'focused', 'futurism', 'more', 'focused', 'turning', 'mirror', 'humanity', 'what', 'scenario', 'used', 'amplify', 'exaggerate', 'reality', 'can', 'see', 'new', 'eyes.That', 'being', 'said', 'great', 'parts', 'entire', 'film', 'largely', 'carried', 'back', 'one', 'amazingly', 'hypnotic', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'second', 'frame', 'eyes', 'followed', 'cat', 'laser', 'pointer', 'director', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'getting', 'way', 'keeping', 'camera', 'shifting', 'natural', 'pace', 'script', 'poetic', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'captivating', 'wildly', 'belligerent', 'supporting', 'actor', 'hard', 'give', 'director', 'credit', 'stringing', 'together', 'future', 'anticipate', 'will', 'receive', 'will', 'rest', 'prominent', 'people', 'involved', 'hope.This', 'masterclass', 'film', 'making', 'script', 'writing', 'acting', 'plot', 'design', 'hesitate', 'say', 'right', 'now', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'poetry', 'pure', 'hope-filled', 'talent', 'nowhere', 'story', 'design', 'so', 'rich', 'tastes', 'as', 'close', 'perfection', 'could', 'ever', 'hope']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

I didn't really know quite what to expect from Beasts, other than it was supposedly fanciful and whimsical, at least that's what Oprah said about it. Oprah Winfrey profiled this film, the director, as well as the actors on her new talk show; on her new network. Since I like Oprah, I thought Beasts would be worth my time. Let me say that this film is so awful and amateurish, so ugly and disgusting, that I will NEVER watch another film that is recommended by Ms. Winfrey again; not without checking with other reviewers first. This film is so terrible that it makes me wonder how or why so many people could give it good reviews, and this is a well reviewed movie! The film depicts poverty and squalor, alcoholism and child abuse in a way that seems to condone these awful conditions. The acting is unprofessional, and never convincing. At no time did I believe in or care about the characters. At no point in the movie could I even buy the premise that this was anything more than a effort to manipulate the audience with a cute little 5 year old in something that was, at best, a home movie. I was scratching my head the entire time wondering to myself, HOW DID THIS CINEMATIC CATACLYSM EVER GET MADE? Did Oprah finance this train-wreck? Is that why she recommended it?

1541811,A140XH16IKR4B0,B008220AGC,Jean E. Pouliot,"[11, 17]","On the surface, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is a movie about an assortment of misfits and rejects living in ""The Bathtub"" a flood-prone outlying section of New Orleans. The film is seen through the eyes of Hushpuppy, a nine-year-old girl living with her alcoholic dad, whose heart is one the verge of giving out. The pair live in a Mad Max house trailer - a concoction of junk and scrap metal that barely holds together. Their boat is made of an old Chevy pickup bed lashed to some plastic barrels. Their neighbors are the local drunks and nuts who refuse to budge when a hurricane comes barreling down on them. This collection of fools and madmen is unsympathetic, to say the least. Being a young girl in the care of these well-meaning loons is frightening.But the movie also operates on a deeper level that parallels the surface story. Hushpuppy has grown up without a mother, and longs for a presence other than her loving, violence-prone, sometimes-absent Dad. Her day-dreams involve her child's version of aurochs, those fabulous beasts of the Paleolithic, which she sees briefly as a tattoo on a woman's leg. The aurochs, frozen in ice, break loose and provide a visual symbol of her burgeoning need for female connection.Truth be told, these conclusions came long after seeing the film. While watching, I was physically ill - whether due to some bad nachos, the deliberately shaky camerawork or the unending parade of unsettling food - overflowing baskets of crawdads, greasy fried gator, wriggling things in glass jars and dead animals fished out of swamps. But the mythic aspect of the film continues to fascinate. BOSW was hero's quest of mythology, transferred to the bayou. Princesses and wounded kings were projected onto Hushpuppy and her father. A distant lighthouse stood in for the siren's song, drawing the hero to wholeness. Some fried gator meat was the priceless medicine that would bring healing.

So much depends on the performance of young Quvenzhane Wallis, a child who is not a trained actress- and yet she more than holds her own compared to seasoned actors.She shines, brightly,  in her role as 6 year old Hushpuppy.The film focuses on life in ""The Bathtub"" , a poor section of Louisiana. Surviving  there is precarious and everything can be swept away if water overflows the levee system.Hushpuppy has a world view which helps create order amidst chaos but it is about to be severely tested.The Bathtub community, so vividly seen through Hushpuppy's eyes, is one layer of this film- the words and soundtrack add depth and resonance which result in a film poetic enough to take your breath away. And the images...from Hushpuppy's expressive face to a homemade boat floating on water...they are also hypnotic.I urge you not to focus only on what is literal or seems true to life in this film. Watching it is often like dreaming while awake. This is not to say that Beasts of the Southern Wild is too artsy.

1541842,A1CYV655X6LBVK,B008220AGC,Kendrick,"[0, 1]","Beasts of the Southern Wild has taken top prizes at Sundance and Cannes and has now racked up nominations at the Oscars. The talk of the town is Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis. A six year old at the time of filming, and now eight, the young actress plays Hushpuppy, a girl who lives with her father, Wink, in a Louisiana bayou town. The town is dubbed The Bathtub and is a fictionalized, self-enclosed village, separated from the modern world by a levee. In their solipsistic existence, the residents of The Bathtub live life fishing, drinking, and having a good time, living in houses constructed from debris and waste, perfectly content to live day-to-day without the complexities (or ugliness?) of contemporary society.Hushpuppy wants to be a man. Or at least wants to be her father; or at least that's what her father wants. This is to prepare her for the uncertain future ahead of her as Wink is slowly wasting away from a health condition. Hushpuppy screams ferociously to assert herself, tries to belch like a grown man who's had too much beer, and is not afraid to punch Wink.The Bathtub's children all go to a small school taught by Miss Bathsheba, who tells them about the village's folk religion about the Aurochs--these large prehistoric, tusked hogs that are preserved in the arctic ice--and how they may be released due to the melting ice caps. As the film progresses, the Aurochs break free of their cold bondage and rush toward The Bathtub as a hurricane begins to form. The hurricane's course trajectory includes The Bathtub, but the residents refuse to evacuate.I will leave the rest of the story for you to find out for yourself on your home televisions. Beasts of the Southern Wild is one of those films you can't get out of your head because of its sheer ingenuity and novelty. In many ways, it's sui generis in the world it creates in Louisiana. With magical realism that will remind viewers of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novels, Hushpuppy has what A. O. Scott has called ""juvenile narcissism"" at the New York Times. It is through this lens of juvenile narcissism that the whole movie is cast. The Auorchs, the magical world of The Bathtub, the desire to be a grown man that can take on the world--these are building blocks of a Hushpuppy-centric world. Beyond this, there isn't much of an anchor to the story other than her relationship with Wink, her father. The rest of the narrative swirls around them almost spasmodically in a most charming fashion.Reviews of Beasts of the Southern Wild have been divided, with most praising it, while a significant minority have found it uninteresting both in its storyline and its character development. I am personally torn about how to react to the film, and would say that it's a film of art that is to be savored and appreciated, more than to be enjoyed. I would not watch it again for its entertainment value. I think audiences are more engrossed by the world of The Bathtub as strange and curious, rather than attached to the characters or intrigued by the plotline.As with many films, we can read into the symbols the director has provided us with. Is the hurricane and the melting ice caps a platform for an environmentalist message? Are the Aurochs a personification of Hushpuppy's coming-of-age as a frightening prospect? How much of the film is a commentary on Hurricane Katrina and the government's response (there is a mandatory evacuation imposed on The Bathtub by a government agency)? All these are discussion points raised by Beasts of the Southern Wild, but I personally found the tension between youth and maturity, embodied in Hushpuppy, to be the most compelling theme.Hushpuppy is a young girl that's expected to act as a grown up, but what her father teaches her about being mature fall along the lines of being bold and acting like a man (burping, drinking, feeding yourself). These ideals derive from Wink's overarching goal of making Hushpuppy fit for survival after his imminent death. I'm not making a judgment call as to the morality of the film, but merely pointing out the reason for the fascination with Hushpuppy and how it drives the movie. Within our psyches, there's an attraction to coming-of-age stories, where children confront the ""real world"" and become adults as they adapt to it. Hushpuppy, on the other hand, appears to conquer her fears, not by casting away the magic of her youth, but persisting in her faith in The Bathtub world and its surrealism.So what exactly are the beasts of the southern wild? I haven't actually read anywhere anyone addressing this question. I'm inclined to say that the beasts are the residents of The Bathtub, but the word ""beasts"" here is not derogatory. Rather, in a Rousseauan turn of phrase, they are the independent, noble savages, who are left untarnished. As a soon-to-be-independent resident of The Bathtub, Hushpuppy is not required to throw off the magical realism of her younger years, but can remain in it as something noble.Beasts of the Southern Wild is already on DVD and you can watch it on Amazon, rent it from Netflix, or get it from whatever source of cinematic goodness you so desire. I recommend watching it, not for entertainment, but for the art of being transported to another kind of universe.[This review was published previously on Schaeffer's Ghost ([...]",5,What are the

It has a surreal fable-like quality  and is unlikely to be similar to much else that you have seen.  Little girl Hushpuppy lives in the bayou backwater with her single-parent Dad and a host of colorful, down-and-out characters.  Melting ice caps and global warming trigger severe weather and flooding of their idyllic backwater refuge, ""The Bathtub.""  Their cup (and island) runneth over, but they are nevertheless reluctant to abandon it.  As Dorothy said in The Wizard of Oz, ""There's no place like home.""What follows is a Homeric quest by Hushpuppy to reunite with her mother, who apparently abandoned her earlier -- and to return with Daddy and neighbors to their sodden path of ground at The Bathtub.Residents of the Bathtub are depicted as noble savages -- partying and having a good time despite the squalor of their conditions.  The film posits a tiresome dichotomy between their life and the presumed life of the more developed world across the levees.  Poor people = Good.  Developed society = Bad.This Rousseau-like depiction breaks down for me somewhat, as the ""noble savages"" on the Bathtub isle seem to largely pass the time drinking, groping and passing out.  (Plus, they are in dire need of dental work.) The denizens of the developed world have their helicopters and megaphones, ordering the determined residents of the mud patch to evacuate, scheming to place them in shelters where they would receive a clean environment, food and medical care.  Why would anyone want to leave their muddy squalor for features like that?Meanwhile, some menacing/mythical creatures called Aurucs are unleashed by the melting polar caps and swim to the Gulf to menace the populace of the Bathtub.What will happen during the face-off between these beasts and Hushpuppy?  Will Hushpuppy reunite with her mother?  Will her father survive his illness?No spoilers here.""Beasts"" is a head-scratcher that marches to the beat of a different cinematic drummer.

1541857,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B008220AGC,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","This film has several things to commend it, starting with the acting, which is outstanding. Also, the idea of a place like the Bathtub, a vibrant community where everyone seems happy despite almost surreal poverty, is compelling. I could not help liking Hushpuppy, who is introduced to us as a child who is always picking up animals and listening to their heartbeat or &#34;code;&#34; this is amusing when she does it to a crab. I also liked the idea of leaving pictures for the &#34;scientists of the future,&#34; who would know &#34;there was a Hushpuppy who lived with her father in the Bathtub.&#34; The aurochs was a nice touch, although they were hardly the meanest and most dangerous animals of their time (or whatever the lady with the tattoo called them); they were a large type of cattle. The saber-tooth tiger or the cave bear would have made more sense, although the scene with Hushpuppy facing what looked like a gigantic hog with bull's horns was powerful enough. The problem is the atrocious camerawork (I've seen home movies that were steadier) and the director's failure to capture the beauty of the place. This film would have been vastly improved if it looked like &#34;Scent of Green Papaya.&#34; Some reviewers said it moved too slowly, but this is the fault of the meandering, directionless script. What the film really needed was to move even more slowly, to linger over this strange environment and show us its details. In the hands of another director, it could have been great. As it is, it has nothing to recommend it other than the exotic locale, the exceptional acting, and the independent, &#34;artsy,&#34; non-Hollywood presentation that will automatically endear it to many people. And before anyone gets offended, I mean someone such as myself that wanted to like the film as soon as I heard about it.One cannot help but wonder if the lead actress' unique name (she pronounces it &#34;Kwa-VEN-ja-nay&#34;) contributed to her being selected for the role. &#34;Quvenzhane Wallis&#34; definitely adds a level of interest that &#34;Betty Smith&#34; doesn't have. Her sister's name, Qunyquekya, is even better.* * SPOILER ALERT * *Everything I heard about this film pointed to the little girl leaving to search for her mother.

This is in no way a film of ""improbable joy"" nor is it truly uplifting. It took me a bit to figure out that ""The Beasts of the Southern Wild"" were not the giant boars Hushpuppy imagines, but the people themselves. They are wild, not good or bad, but a people in an entirely separate and completely lawless world of their own. You figure out after a while that her father is not all there and certainly should not be raising a child - you also figure out later on that the reason he's behaving so erratically is because he's deathly ill, so in his messed up way he's trying to toughen up Hushpuppy to get her ready for life without him. And I do mean messed up, since he disappears and leaves her to eat dog food, and slaps her around. He is seriously insane.While I cannot personally understand why on earth all those people would fight (literally kicking and screaming) to go back to a place they would almost certainly die in, I can at least understand why the father wanted to go back, as he was dying and made it clear he did not want to die in a hospital. That at least makes sense.And I suppose you could say that Hushpuppy has an indomitable spirit because she doesn't let any of the things she experiences break her. The actress playing her really does a great job.But this is hands down one of the most depressing and soul crushing movies I've ever seen. Children living in horrendous poverty with parents who all seem half crazed, desperate to separate themselves from society they feel only wants to lock them up.So, if you want to see a really really depressing movie about a kid who survives all manner of horrible things, watch this.

She plays Hushpuppy, a young girl living in ""The Bathtub"", which appears on a map as an island just south of mainland Louisiana, and is a community living on the fringe.Hushpuppy's mom is gone, and her Dad, who is well meaning, doesn't quite cut it as a parent.

This tale of a completely unplugged society is better than OK, though, so four stars.Six-year-old Hushpuppy lives in a waterlogged, racially mixed Louisiana Bayou community called ""The Bathtub"" with her father Wink. Hushpuppy's mother ""swam away"" shortly after Hushpuppy's birth. The inhabitants of The Bathtub all seem to have eccentric names, drink a great deal of moonshine, live in houses made of scrap metal and other junk, travel around on the water in odd vessels (Wink's boat appears to be a converted pickup truck) and live off the land and water. Wink feeds Hushpuppy chickens he raises, kills and cooks himself on a gas barbecue, and crayfish he catches. Hushpuppy rips the meat off the bones with her teeth, ""like a beast."" At school, instead of a typical curriculum, Miss Bathsheba teaches the Bathtub children survival skills and warns that because of global warming, the waters will rise and the community will wash away. In spite of this looming danger, or perhaps because of it, every day is a holiday in the Bathtub, Hushpuppy says. The tough residents of The Bathtub like their independent, slow-paced, free and easy way of life--""beasts"" and proud of it. No crying allowed, Wink tells Hushpuppy.In response to government hurricane warnings, most residents evacuate, but Hushpuppy, Wink and a few other stubborn holdouts remain in The Bathtub, fortifying their homes and moving themselves and their possessions onto their roofs. The storm subsides and the high waters recede, but the storm's mixing of the salt water with the fresh has killed all the fish, making the old ways of survival impossible. At the same time, Wink becomes terribly ill. The drama centers around how Hushpuppy and the other Bathtub dwellers will weather these crises.Quvenzahne Wallis, in her first role, lights up the screen as the fiercely independent Hushpuppy. The other performers, mostly residents of Terrebonne Parish in Louisiana rather than professional actors, do pretty well considering their lack of experience.While I liked the settings, I tired of the jittery handheld camerawork in a hurry. The fantasy elements did not appeal to me.  The Hushpuppy character struck me as impossibly precocious and the Hushpuppy name as impossibly precious. I kept wondering why nobody had a name like Anne or Joe. I found the parallel between Wink's health and the health of the Bathtub too obvious and heavy-handed. I could not figure out where the people in the Bathtub got the money for fuel for their boats and barbecues and their obviously factory-made clothes.  Overall there were enough irritants to keep me from giving the movie five stars.Still, this sweet film celebrates people who live in the present. It held my attention and I expect it will hold most people's. Worth seeing.

1541908,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008220AGC,M. Oleson,"[17, 19]","This remarkable film was shot with a first time director and a cast of amateurs that is a story in and of itself.  Benh Zeitlin directed and co-wrote, with Lucy Alibar.  They create this fantasy/drama based on Ms. Alibar's one act play called ""Juicy and Delicious.""  The movie was filmed in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana which is essentially the marshland south and west of New Orleans.  The story takes place in an area known as ""The Bathtub"" which is land surrounded by water.  These are a cluster of small islands.They are inhabited by a hearty self-sufficient population who live off the land and the water.  Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) is the six year old daughter of Wink (Dwight Henry).  The mother left shortly after Hushpuppy was born.  Hushpuppy stays in a trailer that was originally occupied by her mother.  Wink lives ""next door"" in his own shack.  Wink isn't a perfect father but clearly cares for his daughter.  He has a medical disorder and insists that Hushpuppy learn to provide for herself.  Wink is also a stubborn man and like most of the residents, insists on staying put rather than relocate to civilization, even with an approaching tropical storm.Somehow this unlikely cast and crew (aided by a great score) create a believable world but add some fantastical creatures known as ""aurochs"" from the imagination of Hushpuppy.  As the storm (very realistic thanks to some nice sound work) creates havoc and a life-threatening aftermath, the small community must pull together to survive.  This terrific film was shot in 2009 when young Quvenzhane was only 5.  Her performance is exceptional as the catalyst and narrator throughout the film.  She should be on an Oscar short list.  Dwight Henry is also noteworthy as the tough love father.  The actor's real day job is a baker!  The film premiered at Sundance in January, 2012 and won the Grand Jury Prize and later 4 awards at Cannes.

1541925,A12FLZREV32JOP,B008220AGC,Noelle Eiram,"[6, 12]","""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" tries not to romanticize the heroine's wild world of poverty and primal freedom. The six year old Hushpuppy lives in the Bathtub, a bayou community that lives off the grid. Trained by her father Wink to be self-sufficient, they live separately, surviving off of fish and a livestock, including chickens, goats, and pigs. The alcoholic, occasionally abusive Wink sometimes disappears for days on end, and Hushpuppy misses her long absent mother.Still, like many children, Hushpuppy loves her father and revels in the Bathtub's independence. She is told they are better off than those in the ""civilized"" world. The jubilant opening scenes feature unconstrained revelry. These citizens would rather live and die on their own terms than submit to the regulations of modern life. The plot itself involves melting icecaps, ancient creatures, and a tremendous storm.Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis plays the adorable, strong, and sympathetic Hushpuppy. Her performance is perhaps the film's greatest asset.  The rest of the actors are also excellent, including Dwight Henry as her father. Few films examine a messy father-daughter relationship, in which anger and love go side by side. Very few focus on characters who aren't white and upper-middle class.There are several very funny moments and imaginative scenes of whimsy. Hushuppy's quiet yearning for a mother figure and the sense of community spirit powerfully pervade the film. Though sometimes distracting, the soundtrack conveys a sense of wonder. The beautiful environment is shot mostly with a shaky camera. (Why does destitution often call for a shaky camera?)However, the film's loyalties ultimately lie too obviously with the poor and rough heroes. The difference between their world and that of most American moviegoers is demonstrated in a scene in which they gleefully escape from a sterile, prison-like hospital to the bright colors of the Delta. In one troubling sequence, the Bathtub dwellers blow up a levy to reset nature's equilibrium. How many people did this act kill? The film never addresses this.The characters express a typical New Orleanian desire to expel sadness with celebration. But, as tough as their lives are, is repression really the best way to live? The idea of dying before being beholden to others is a very American ideal. But ""Beasts"" doesn't address the more dangerous, long-term aspects of isolating children from the rest of society, teaching them to fear and loathe the outside world. Hushpuppy's father has flashes of violence, but this plays into another stereotype about poverty: disadvantaged people tend to be violent.Many viewers will either ignore or admire these undertones. This is understandable, as the movie is a coming of age tale rather than a political statement. As such, the movie is an original fantasy. But some will find the movie's messages uncomfortable and ultimately unfulfilling.",3,"Beautiful, but not for everyone",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,2918,"['Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'not', 'romanticize', 'heroine', 'wild', 'world', 'poverty', 'primal', 'freedom', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'Hushpuppy', 'Bathtub', 'bayou', 'community', 'grid', 'Trained', 'father', 'Wink', 'be', 'self-sufficient', 'live', 'separately', 'surviving', 'fish', 'livestock', 'including', 'chickens', 'goats', 'pigs', 'alcoholic', 'occasionally', 'abusive', 'Wink', 'sometimes', 'days', 'end', 'Hushpuppy', 'long', 'absent', 'mother.Still', 'many', 'children', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'revels', 'Bathtub', 'independence', 'told', 'are', 'better', 'civilized', 'world', 'jubilant', 'opening', 'scenes', 'feature', 'unconstrained', 'revelry', 'citizens', 'would', 'rather', 'live', 'die', 'own', 'terms', 'submit', 'regulations', 'modern', 'life', 'plot', 'melting', 'icecaps', 'ancient', 'creatures', 'tremendous', 'storm.Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'adorable', 'strong', 'sympathetic', 'Hushpuppy', 'performance', 'perhaps', 'film', 'greatest', 'asset', 'rest', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'including', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'father', 'Few', 'films', 'examine', 'messy', 'father-daughter', 'relationship', 'anger', 'love', 'go', 'side', 'side', 'Very', 'few', 'focus', 'characters', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'white', 'upper-middle', 'class.There', 'are', 'several', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'imaginative', 'scenes', 'whimsy', 'Hushuppy', 'quiet', 'yearning', 'mother', 'figure', 'sense', 'community', 'spirit', 'powerfully', 'pervade', 'film', 'sometimes', 'distracting', 'soundtrack', 'sense', 'wonder', 'beautiful', 'environment', 'shot', 'mostly', 'shaky', 'camera', 'Why', 'destitution', 'often', 'call', 'shaky', 'camera', 'However', 'film', 'loyalties', 'ultimately', 'lie', 'too', 'obviously', 'poor', 'rough', 'heroes', 'difference', 'world', 'most', 'American', 'moviegoers', 'demonstrated', 'scene', 'gleefully', 'escape', 'sterile', 'prison-like', 'hospital', 'bright', 'colors', 'Delta', 'one', 'troubling', 'sequence', 'Bathtub', 'dwellers', 'blow', 'up', 'levy', 'reset', 'nature', 'equilibrium', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'act', 'kill', 'film', 'never', 'this.The', 'characters', 'express', 'typical', 'New', 'Orleanian', 'desire', 'expel', 'sadness', 'celebration', 'as', 'tough', 'lives', 'are', 'repression', 'really', 'best', 'way', 'live', 'idea', 'dying', 'being', 'beholden', 'others', 'very', 'American', 'ideal', 'Beasts', ""n't"", 'address', 'more', 'dangerous', 'long-term', 'aspects', 'isolating', 'children', 'rest', 'society', 'teaching', 'fear', 'loathe', 'outside', 'world', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'flashes', 'violence', 'stereotype', 'poverty', 'disadvantaged', 'people', 'tend', 'be', 'violent.Many', 'viewers', 'will', 'either', 'ignore', 'admire', 'undertones', 'understandable', 'movie', 'coming', 'age', 'tale', 'rather', 'political', 'statement', 'such', 'movie', 'original', 'fantasy', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'messages', 'uncomfortable', 'ultimately', 'unfulfilling']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541927,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B008220AGC,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[4, 6]","Beasts of the Southern Wild is an eccentric, non-linear tale which is hard to fathom but is held together by utterly absorbing performances from its two leads, most notably six year old Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis who gives a striking, powerful and heart warming performance reminiscent of Anna Paquin's Flora in The Piano. That earned Paquin (then 11) a best supporting actress Oscar: Wallis is 6, and a leading role, and Beasts is sufficiently unconventional a picture that that would be expecting a bit much here, but nevertheless mark it that, how little else you get out of this film, the relationship between Hushpuppy (Wallis) and her Dad Wink (Dwight Henry, also a first-time actor) is a remarkable and wondrous thing. Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis is, as Roger Ebert puts it, simply a force of nature.Hushpuppy's mother is gone: Wink says she swam away. Hushpuppy expects her back sometime. Until that day, she and Wink live in a pair of ramshackle sheds - one each - connected by a cowbell on a rope, filled with totems and items from their lives. These sheds are somewhere between shantytown shacks and found object assemblages, and I believe are among the pieces credited as artworks of Elizabeth Behl, a New York sculptor credited as ""Scenic Artist""). All reside together with a rag tag collection of other oddballs the won't side of the levee on a fictional island on a fictional bayou, but it's a lot like Louisiana and the gathering storm - foretold by Wink - is a lot like Hurricane Katrina. Before it arrives we revel in the madcap, but vibrant, life all live within the ""Bathtub"", disconnected from the Grid and set free of the corporate constraints of the rest of the planet, glumly symbolised by a giant energy plant hulking in the distance beyond the levee.Hushpuppy has a vivid imagination - or perhaps is a swamp sprite - and battles doggedly with the disrupting forces in her life, which also happen to be the stabilising ones. Her mother is gone and her father ails, from we know not what, but is preparing hushpuppy for a time where he isn't there. We have no doubt she's ready for it. She imagines the arrival of the ""aurochs"", mythical beasts which draw ever nearer and threaten calamity.Calamities arrive in the shape of the Hurricane, which floods the bathtub and lays waste to much of the locals' life, but doesn't seem unduly to bother them, and in the deterioration of her Wink's health. Hushpuppy scans the horizon for signs of her mother, and in the winking light of a distant lighthouse, sees one. If mum won't swim back, Hushpuppy will swim out to her. So she does.There are large stretches of Beasts of the Southern Wild which didn't seem to have an obvious purpose: it felt rather like a assemblage of collected footage rather than a linear composition of deliberately shot and acted passages which the director aimed to capture in the first place. This didn't awfully matter as long as the relationship between Wink and Hushpuppy was progressing, and Wallis and Henry were sufficiently captivating that was never in doubt.This is a remarkable, unforgettable piece of film making.Olly Buxton",4,Non linear tale held together by an extraordinary 6 year old,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3123,"['Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'eccentric', 'non-linear', 'tale', 'hard', 'fathom', 'held', 'together', 'utterly', 'absorbing', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'most', 'notably', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'who', 'striking', 'powerful', 'heart', 'warming', 'performance', 'reminiscent', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Flora', 'Piano', 'earned', 'Paquin', 'then', '11', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'Oscar', 'Wallis', '6', 'leading', 'role', 'Beasts', 'sufficiently', 'unconventional', 'picture', 'would', 'be', 'expecting', 'bit', 'much', 'here', 'nevertheless', 'mark', 'how', 'little', 'else', 'get', 'film', 'relationship', 'Hushpuppy', 'Wallis', 'Dad', 'Wink', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'also', 'first-time', 'actor', 'remarkable', 'wondrous', 'thing', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'simply', 'force', 'nature.Hushpuppy', 'mother', 'gone', 'Wink', 'away', 'Hushpuppy', 'back', 'sometime', 'day', 'Wink', 'live', 'pair', 'ramshackle', 'sheds', 'one', 'connected', 'cowbell', 'rope', 'filled', 'totems', 'items', 'lives', 'sheds', 'are', 'somewhere', 'shantytown', 'shacks', 'found', 'object', 'assemblages', 'believe', 'are', 'pieces', 'credited', 'artworks', 'Elizabeth', 'Behl', 'New', 'York', 'sculptor', 'credited', 'Scenic', 'Artist', 'reside', 'together', 'rag', 'tag', 'collection', 'other', 'wo', ""n't"", 'side', 'levee', 'fictional', 'island', 'fictional', 'bayou', 'lot', 'Louisiana', 'gathering', 'storm', 'foretold', 'Wink', 'lot', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'revel', 'madcap', 'vibrant', 'life', 'live', 'Bathtub', 'disconnected', 'Grid', 'set', 'free', 'corporate', 'constraints', 'rest', 'planet', 'glumly', 'symbolised', 'giant', 'energy', 'plant', 'hulking', 'distance', 'levee.Hushpuppy', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'perhaps', 'swamp', 'sprite', 'battles', 'doggedly', 'disrupting', 'forces', 'life', 'also', 'happen', 'be', 'stabilising', 'ones', 'mother', 'gone', 'father', 'ails', 'know', 'not', 'what', 'preparing', 'hushpuppy', 'time', 'where', ""n't"", 'there', 'have', 'doubt', 'ready', 'arrival', 'aurochs', 'mythical', 'beasts', 'draw', 'ever', 'nearer', 'threaten', 'calamity.Calamities', 'arrive', 'shape', 'Hurricane', 'bathtub', 'waste', 'much', 'locals', 'life', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unduly', 'bother', 'deterioration', 'Wink', 'health', 'Hushpuppy', 'horizon', 'signs', 'mother', 'winking', 'light', 'distant', 'lighthouse', 'one', 'mum', 'wo', ""n't"", 'swim', 'back', 'Hushpuppy', 'will', 'swim', 'out', 'are', 'large', 'stretches', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'felt', 'rather', 'assemblage', 'collected', 'footage', 'rather', 'linear', 'composition', 'deliberately', 'shot', 'acted', 'passages', 'director', 'aimed', 'capture', 'first', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'awfully', 'matter', 'as', 'long', 'relationship', 'Wink', 'Hushpuppy', 'was', 'progressing', 'Wallis', 'Henry', 'were', 'sufficiently', 'captivating', 'was', 'never', 'doubt.This', 'remarkable', 'unforgettable', 'piece', 'film', 'making.Olly', 'Buxton']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

Their fragile existence is uprooted by a flood, which makes their place uninhabitable. And on top of that, ""Daddy"" becomes ill.

1541956,A4FX5YCJA630V,B008220AGC,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 2]","It was Quvenzhane Wallis' Academy Award nomination that drew me to ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"", as well as the stunning soundtrack that played over the trailer, two reasons which are as good as any to sit down and watch a film. The best part was that I had absolutely no idea what to expect, since the promotional material portrayed the film as being anything from a serious family drama to a post-modern fairytale. As it turns out, it's a bit of both.The story is set in Southeast Louisiana, specifically a small settlement known as the Bathtub. Far from the usual romanticized portrayal of the Old South, this is a region where the swamps are filled with death and decay, where hurricanes and floods are devastating, where outsiders are well-meaning but unwelcome, and where the Gulf Sea is slowly but surely encroaching upon the land. The Bathtub is separated from ""the dry world"" by a levee, and its residents live in poverty - some might even say squalor. It's unclear whether any of these people actually work, they just live, and as is established early on in the film, the place enjoys ""more holidays than the whole rest of the world"".Most of their food seems to come straight from the sea or swamp, there's always plenty of alcohol on hand, and during their night time revelries adults fire guns into the air while children run around with lit fireworks in their bare hands.If this sounds like it's hedged with negative connotations, it shouldn't be, because all of the above is portrayed in a hugely positive light.  This is the truth about how these people live, and as the movie progresses it becomes clear that the Bathtub's residents are all exactly where they want to be, and nothing is going to keep them from their homes and lives for very long.This is where six year old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) lives with her father Wink (Dwight Henry), her mother having walked out on them. Well, not lives ""with"" him exactly, as she has her own ramshackle house of her own, joined to her father's only by a bell rope. Most of the time she's left to her own devices, wandering around the area in her gumboots and underwear, talking to her mother's clothing, sharing her food with the dog, and using a flamethrower to light the gas cooker. It takes a while to get a proper fix on the father/daughter relationship, and for the first twenty minutes or so I had Wink pegged as a deadbeat abuser. He gives his daughter a slap early on and then disappears for a period of time, only to turn up again in a hospital gown with no other explanation as to where he's been.But the relationship deepens, and it's soon apparent that Wink is not only unwell, but deeply concerned with the need to make his daughter self-sufficient. In this he's a hard taskmaster, teaching her to kill a fish by hitting it on the head, verbally goading her into various challenges, and insisting that she never cry. He's clearly trying to prep her for his imminent death, even as he attempts to withhold the truth about the seriousness of his condition from her, and it results in this tiny six year old being forced into some very intense situations.(But also some very funny ones. At times Wink seems to forget that he has a daughter, and has her yelling ""I'm the man!"" and declaring her the king - not queen - of the Bathtub. Plus Quvenzhane Wallis has this little high-pitched squeal that's just adorable, particularly since it's meant to be her equivalent of a war-cry).As a consequence of her father's illness and the impending storm that floods the Bathtub with salt water, Hushpuppy's life is filled with fear and anxiety. Her voiceovers demonstrate that she's acutely aware of her own mortality and of time passing, of unstoppable natural forces and the grim realities of death, and she's determined to leave evidence of her existence so that future scientists might know of her. She's full of the little quirks and idiosyncrasies that make up childhood - like the way she puts almost everything to her ear as though it's a seashell, whether it be baby birds or dead crabs or fallen leaves, in the hopes of hearing what any of it has got to say.Her teacher tells her of creatures known as the aurochs: giant prehistoric boars that are released from their icy prison thanks to the melting polar icecaps, and which gradually make their way across land and sea to Hushpuppy's door - though whether these creatures are real or just an elaborate fantasy derived from the mind of a traumatized girl is a matter of debate. What really matters is that the story is very much told from her perspective, not only in regards to the voiceover narration, but in the filming techniques that convey a child's point-of-view. Most of the time the camera angles are low, and the conversations of the adults are nearly impossible to discern due to the muted sound (surely you remember when you were a kid and the discussions of the adults around you were little more than gibberish - that's the atmosphere that's captured here).It results in a particularly vivid rendering of Hushpuppy's perception of the world, keeping her the focus of the film no matter what unexpected directions it takes. About halfway through the action moves to the mainland once officials have rounded up the Bathtub residents and placed them in a shelter, a place that Hushpuppy describes as ""a fish tank with no water"". In the third act, the film suddenly veers into magic realism, in which Hushpuppy and her cohorts swim out to sea to find her mother, get picked up by a vessel whose captain tells them it'll take them where they need to go, and are dropped off at a brothel where Hushpuppy meets a woman that is assumed to be her missing mother.But the most remarkable thing about the film is the performances, particularly since neither Quvenzhane Wallis nor Dwight Henry had any prior acting experience. I believe this was also a first time effort from director Behn Zeitlin, and perhaps it's the raw and unpolished simplicity that all three bring to the project that give it its unique flavour, topped off by the truly extraordinary score. I find it impossible to describe music, being entirely without any musical talent myself; suffice to say that this is one of those soundtracks that carries such resonance you feel as though you've been hearing it throughout your entire life.Many films try to portray poverty as an ugly thing, or as a worthy thing by projecting it through a lens of false sentimentality. ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" depicts death and destruction and squalor as beautiful by being as truthful about it as possible: showing that though it may be tough and uncompromising, it's all part of the way these people chose to live. One striking scene in which this attitude shines is when the children arrive at the brothel. Your heart initially sinks, assuming that they're in a terrible place where their innocence is about to be ripped away from them by what they find there. But instead there is a soft, dreamy scene in which the prostitutes and the girls slow dance together, very gently and lovingly, each child as safe as they would be with their own mothers.So there is kindness and wisdom amidst the destruction and sordidness, and though Hushpuppy suffers great loss, by the end of the film she has become like a little Moses figure, leading her people - children and adults alike - back to the swamplands of the Bathtub, even as the watermark spills up and over the road they walk on.It's a challenging film, and often a very strange one, but I think it'll stay with me for a while.",4,"""Everyone Loses the Thing That Made Them...""",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,7560,"['was', 'Quvenzhane', 'Wallis', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'drew', 'Beasts', 'Southern',

1541961,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008220AGC,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","Little Hushpuppy and her papa, Wink, live in a place called The Bathtub, a fictional marshy island that is fast becoming one of the early casualties of a rapidly warming planet. It is a world of great poverty, but also one where the people live in harmony with the environment and each other. They are generally a happy people, quick to party and to find joy in life and in each other's company, but there's a dark side too, for the residents appear to be living on borrowed time, as the sea gradually rises, threatening to submerge their land and destroy their homes.Hushpuppy, however, has more immediate problems of her own to deal with, including a father whose mercurial temperament may mask a more serious health issue, and a mother who left years ago and whom Hushpuppy expects to return any day now. Hushpuppy believes that she has a gift for communicating with animals, which is a very important power to have in a place where beasts are celebrated and cherished for the sustenance they provide the community. Though still a little girl, Hushpuppy already has a guiding philosophy for her life: &#34;The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right&#8230;if you can fix the broken piece, everything can go right back.&#34; And indeed, throughout the course of the story, she spends a lot of time trying to fix broken pieces. And while sometimes broken things just remain broken, Hushpuppy also learns that true power can only come when one recognizes that all elements of nature are inextricably linked to one another in some vast cosmic web, each part having its own unique role to play. It's an insight that indigenous peoples, i.e., those who live closest to the land, have always seemed to have had a better grasp of than those who boast of a more &#34;civilized&#34; style of life.The village faces an existential challenge, a possible prelude to what lies ahead, when a huge storm floods the island, making it virtually impossible for the community to continue sustaining itself there. But they are determined to try, despite the well-meaning government officials who have orders to evacuate them to a shelter back on the mainland.The movie has a gauzy, hallucinatory quality to it at times, as Hushpuppy has dreams and visions of both her absent mother and some exaggeratedly large marauding beasts that may or may not hold the key to her understanding of the universe.Based on a one-act play by Lucy Alibar, adapted by both her and director Ben Zeitlan, &#34;Beasts of the Southern Wild&#34; serves as the vehicle for Quvenzhane Walllis , whose work here earned her the distinction of being the youngest person ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Wallis is transcendent as she embodies all the wide-eyed innocence and shrewd comprehension of a young girl intensely in touch with the world around her. A nonprofessional, Dwight Henry is also excellent as her irascible but loving father who's trying his best to raise a child despite all the physical and emotional struggles he himself is going through.Replete with a soaring score by Zeitlan and Dan Romer, &#34;Beasts of the Southern Wild&#34; offers a lyrical and life-affirming glimpse into a fascinating, exotic world.",4,Mystical and magical,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,3221,"['Little', 'Hushpuppy', 'papa', 'Wink', 'live', 'place', 'called', 'Bathtub', 'fictional', 'marshy', 'island', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'early', 'casualties', 'rapidly', 'warming', 'planet', 'world', 'great', 'poverty', 'also', 'one', 'where', 'people', 'live', 'harmony', 'environment', 'other', 'are', 'generally', 'happy', 'people', 'quick', 'party', 'find', 'joy', 'life', 'other', 'company', 'dark', 'side', 'too', 'residents', 'appear', 'be', 'living', 'borrowed', 'time', 'sea', 'gradually', 'threatening', 'submerge', 'land', 'destroy', 'homes.Hushpuppy', 'however', 'more', 'immediate', 'problems', 'own', 'deal', 'including', 'father', 'mercurial', 'temperament', 'may', 'mask', 'more', 'serious', 'health', 'issue', 'mother', 'who', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'whom', 'Hushpuppy', 'return', 'day', 'now', 'Hushpuppy', 'gift', 'communicating', 'animals', 'very', 'important', 'power', 'have', 'place', 'where', 'beasts', 'are', 'celebrated', 'cherished', 'sustenance', 'provide', 'community', 'Though', 'still', 'little', 'girl', 'Hushpuppy', 'already', 'guiding', 'philosophy', 'life', '34', 'entire', 'universe', 'everything', 'fitting', 'together', 'just', 'right', '8230', 'can', 'fix', 'broken', 'piece', 'everything', 'can', 'go', 'right', 'back.', '34', 'indeed', 'course', 'story', 'lot', 'time', 'trying', 'fix', 'broken', 'pieces', 'sometimes', 'broken', 'things', 'just', 'remain', 'broken', 'Hushpuppy', 'also', 'true', 'power', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'when', 'one', 'elements', 'nature', 'are', 'inextricably', 'linked', 'one', 'vast', 'cosmic', 'web', 'part', 'having', 'own', 'unique', 'role', 'play', 'insight', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'i.e.', 'who', 'live', 'closest', 'land', 'have', 'always', 'seemed', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'grasp', 'who', 'boast', 'more', '34', 'civilized', '34', 'style', 'life.The', 'village', 'existential', 'challenge', 'possible', 'prelude', 'what', 'ahead', 'when', 'huge', 'storm', 'floods', 'island', 'making', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'community', 'continue', 'sustaining', 'there', 'are', 'determined', 'try', 'well-meaning', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'have', 'orders', 'evacuate', 'shelter', 'back', 'mainland.The', 'movie', 'gauzy', 'hallucinatory', 'quality', 'times', 'Hushpuppy', 'dreams', 'visions', 'absent', 'mother', 'exaggeratedly', 'large', 'marauding', 'beasts', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'key', 'understanding', 'universe.Based', 'one-act', 'play', 'Lucy', 'Alibar', 'adapted', 'director', 'Ben', 'Zeitlan', '34', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', '34', 'serves', 'vehicle', 'Quvenzhane', 'Walllis', 'work', 'here', 'earned', 'distinction', 'being', 'youngest', 'person', 'ever', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Wallis', 'transcendent', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'shrewd', 'comprehension', 'young', 'girl', 'intensely', 'touch', 'world', 'nonprofessional', 'Dwight', 'Henry', 'also', 'excellent', 'irascible', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'best', 'raise', 'child', 'physical', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'going', 'through.Replete', 'soaring', 'score', 'Zeitlan', 'Dan', 'Romer', '34', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', '34', 'lyrical', 'life-affirming', 'glimpse', 'fascinating', 'exotic', 'world']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

1541966,AYIHIIOO7Z6P0,B008220AGC,Ruth Henriquez Lyon,"[3, 6]","This is the fantasy story of an impoverished African American girl (HushPuppy, played by Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis) living in a Louisiana bayou community with an abusive, alcoholic father (Dwight Henry).  Their community gets hit by a hurricane, and, as a result of global warming, ice chunks containing frozen beasts (aurochs) from the ancient past float toward the Louisiana coast, where they thaw and release the now live animals. The movie follows the girl's life as the fabric of her community unravels, and as she ultimately faces the beasts.This movie has great cinematography, and both Wallis and Henry do an excellent job portraying their characters. But I found that the film fell short of the critical acclaim that has greeted its release.  The main problem for me, a person who grew up in the South near a very poor community, is that the movie was written by white middle-class people, and it shows.  There are many fanciful notions about how the poor live. The animals are better fed and cared for than the children. The squalor the film's characters inhabit is depicted as more of a Rousseauesque state of innocence than the public health hazard it truly is.  Images of caked dirt and mud are supposed to show us that these people are ""close to the earth;"" however, most of us who've spent much time in homes like the ones in this film would certainly not romanticize the experience.  There is also racial stereotyping, as the ""words of wisdom"" that come out of this precocious girl's mouth are variants of the sort of folk wisdom uttered in general by people of color in films done by college educated whites.Also problematic is that the adults in this community are alcoholics and completely unable to properly care for their kids or anything else.  The movie portrays this ""happy-go-lucky"" community as being colorful, indeed whimsical -- but it is not.  Communities like this in real life can be terribly hard on their young, and they don't generally produce wise, saintly, healthy and good-looking children like the main character in this film. Furthermore, the filmmakers heavy-handedly portray the middle class ""squares"" who come to take the residents to a post-storm shelter as evil ""mainstreamers"" who don't respect the poor folks' superior, more natural, mode of life.  This is plain silliness.Finally, the ending does not ring true.  Hush Puppy and her father share a moment that drips with sentimentality, such that all the preceding abuse now becomes thickly crusted with treacle. Thus the authors completely sidestep the ambiguities of the pair's troubled relationship in their quest for a climactic tear-jerk moment.Beasts of the Southern Wild exemplifies the cloying side of postmodernist filmmaking.  The emotional excesses that Norman Rockwell used to champion the plain vanilla goodness of the bourgeois classes are here employed to promote the moral authenticity of the poor. But whereas Rockwell grew up in the class whose virtues he extolled, this movie's makers seem to have had little experience of the milieu which they portray.  Thus they give us a culture that has been bent by artsy caprice into an exotic experience that the viewer can enjoy safely, voyeur-like, from his uninfested living room armchair.In this way it is exploitative, using the poor as entertainment props in a film for viewers who will never have to live in an unplumbed shack.  And in the service of political correctness, it fails to criticize the flaws in the culture it explores.  Instead, by minimizing the effect of the community's problems on its children, the film applies a feel-good patina over dirt, disorder, ignorance, drunkenness, neglect, and abuse.

Melvin,"[0, 0]","Beasts of the Southern Wild didn't strike me as a movie I would enjoy watching or even purchase - however, after some very insistent prodding from my better half, I rented this movie from Amazon video and then promptly purchased it after finishing.Why did I purchase it?  Well, this movie is told from the mind of a small female child, whose life is modeled after that of a person living in the southern bayou of Louisiana (I do not believe the state is every directly mentioned, but it paints a vivid and candid picture).  This child and her father live in an old mobile home like structure and survive off the land and the good graces of their neighbors and friends.  Each person in their community looks out for the others.  While this sounds lovely - there is some heavy drinking going on and some less than stellar parenting (no judgement, just what the movie attempts to portray).Throughout the movie the viewers are treated with glimpses of some larger than life wild beast rampaging towards the little piece of bayou that this young girl calls home.  These beasts seem to be the young girls method of coping with the realities that are her life - poverty, a less than attentive father, and her premature need to grow up to fend for herself.Overall, all these facets of the movie lend to a very entertaining and worthy performance.  Unlike some other recent &#34;glimpses into the mind of children&#34; films, this film captures your emotions, depicts the wonder that is a child's mind, and shows a part of American life that not so many of her citizens are truly aware of.

1541992,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,B008220AGC,S. Morales,"[1, 10]","Beasts of Southern Wild is a film that was more or less hailed at the Sundance film festival, as well as receiving some important Academy Award nominations for both Best Actress as well as Best Film of the Year. None of which were deserved. In a nutshell, Beasts of Southern Wild is really just a 90 drudging minutes of mentally unbalanced poor people doing nothing interesting and making stupid decisions the entire time, which illicits no sympathy from the audience, but tries to at some points, failing completely in the end. So what makes this film such an overrated disappointment? Well, let's see.The film opens by introducing us to a very small community of poverty stricken and from what can be seen as mentally unbalanced people living on the forgotten bayous of what I can assume is the southern United States. The main character being a little 9 year old girl who has no mother but only lives with her dad in a small shack mess of a house, where their relationship isn't exactly close but the father does randomly try to have fun with her (it really happens about twice in the movie). Right off the bat you can tell he is somewhat ill, and though he does care for his daughter, he only does so out of obligation, not because he actually enjoys her as a person in any real way. Then a far-fetched scene of a party ensues with this small community of people who seem to have a decent amount of things to live on, but are only surviving by their skin of their teeth (you wonder where they get the stuff they do live on, perhaps the garbage, because it appears they all have zero dollars to their names). Nothing is sanitary and you wonder the entire time if any of them actually work for a living, or have ever tried to. Given that they express opinions of never wanting to be a part of real society, you get the impression that there is something mentally wrong with them, yet also don't feel the least bit sorry for them, as it seems their poverty is really their own fault. What can turn some people off completely is that there are infant babies within this community, and the fact that these people are left to take care of a bunch of kids who will eventually grow up to only go to no real place in life is enough to make you not only not care for these characters, but to also outrightly dislike them.The girl and her father don't say much, but the father does most of the talking in the movie, whereas the girl just narrates a lot. Lots of the film is just them sort of living day by day. In one scene a girl attempts to make herself a real meal by cooking cat food, and then almost breaking out a fire and almost burning their shack down. Surprisingly enough, nobody seems to care about the fact that they almost died. The father then is inexplicably missing for a while (at which point we are made to feel like an actual plot will begin), but then is found by his daughter wandering the marshes in a... hospital gown? He seems to not recognize her, yells at her to leave and then is suddenly back at home doing his normal routine. ...yea, I don't know, just a random attempt at characterization that builds no character. The two go back to this small tent they need to temporarily stay in due to the fire, and on a technical level the film's cinematography just looks uglier than you really want. The characters ""bond"" a little more by just doing random junk like arm wrestling, and you keep wondering to yourself - you people don't have to live this way!! It only becomes irritating because the movie at about a half hour in still has done nothing to make us care. The movie goes on.We are then introduced to a junkyard ""school"" where one woman who looks like she's on crack/cocaine is given a group of about 6 kids who ""educate,"" which really comes down to her giving them her opinions on life. It is at this point where we learn about how the world is ending because the drunk lady tells of how the world will be drowned due to the water rising. Now we begin what is perhaps the most purposeless, senseless, tacked-on attempt at a running parallel in movie history. We get flashes of ice caps melting and giant prehistoric beasts surviving and floating away in ice blocks (get it? Beasts? Like, because the movie title has the world beasts in it? ...yea, exactly).Next there is talk of a storm coming, so then again we feel like a plot will ensue. We see our main characters build a boat once this rainstorm does come and things are later shown underwater. As the movie drudges on we see the small community band together elsewhere as well as the father showing symptoms of some skin illness. He even randomly falls over early in the film, so we have major hints of an ending that we've seen 100 times before. The girl shares thoughts of her missing mother, as well as more scenes of the small community drinking together. All this done of course by your typical dark Sundance indie film cinematography and cliche shaky cam. It's really a method of filmmaking you have already seen done a billion times, it's a wonder these filmmakers couldn't think of another way to do it.The movie you start to feel is almost a combination of documentary and actual film. Why? Because NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET! At least not anything in a vain of character appreciation, suspense, conflict, etc. By this point we are almost an hour into the film and you sit there wondering when the movie is actually going to get on it's feet, this elongated introduction will end and something will finally HAPPEN.Finally we see pieces of a normal society as the people are caught by authorities due to a mandatory evacuation of the area. Since the people have no televisions or way of contacting the real world, the real world authorities are almost made to look like evil alien types, just wanting to destroy their ""harmonious"" way of life, although any person with any sense will just be grateful that these poor idiots can finally be helped. Due to the hillbilly community's insistence on never being part of the real world, the filmmakers failingly try to use this part of the film to make the authorities look like the bad guys, when in fact we know they aren't, and that these poor people are just a bunch of stubborn morons.Anyway, so the group is now at a help rescue center, where there are nurses and doctors treating people, and the little girl is actually dressed up and cleaned, and it is again, at THIS point in the film where we are made to believe the real plot will finally being (an entire HOUR into the film). But guess what? Any sort of attempt is then thwarted because these inane poor people choose to ""rebel"" and escape the rescue center they are being treated at (even the father decides to escape and refuses to take medicine, even though it is clearly seen that he is dying of whatever illness he has... gee, I WONDER what will happen to him? hmmm.... *eye roll*). So they go away yelling and screaming, and again this is an implication by the filmmakers that it is the real world that are the ""bad guys"" and these poor people are the ones who have it right because they are not tied down by societal norms, but instead can be free in all their sloppy, unsanitary, unhealthy, dangerous, and foolish independence.The last 20 minutes of the film takes the focus away from the adults, and focuses on the kids, um, wandering around for some reason, as we see that the little girl's father is laying on his deathbed (wow! didn't see THAT one coming!) So this running parallel of the beasts have broken out of their ice cubes and are making their way towards these people, in a small lot of about 5. We don't know whether these beasts are real or imaginary, or even if they are within the girl's mind, but it is safe to assume they are not real and have some sort of parallel to these people; although absolutely NO parallel or explanation is made known to us as the audience, thus we see this as just dumb filler. The raggedy kids talk to a few other adults who say nothing memorable, and then make their way back to the dying father. It is here that these beasts are shown coming right up to the people (although it seems only the girl can see them), and the big pigs just kinda lay down and do nothing after staring at her. Whatever sort of point or moral these pigs are supposed to represent is completely negligible, as there really is none. The whole parallel was a huge waste of time (plus the special effects look terrible anyway, but since this is indie, it's forgivable). So the father dies (don't worry about this being a spoiler, you really see this one coming from the first 10 minutes of the movie) and the girl and kids are then taken by the remaining adults to a bayou bordello where some women and their male clients are dancing. The girl sees a person who she assumes is her mother (and it only took the ENTIRE movie for anything relevant to finally happen, since this assumed reunion happens with about 5 minutes left of movie time). We are never told whether this is the girl's mother or not, but if the girl thinks it is... well, I guess she thinks it is. Although due to this kid's crappy performance, she shows no sort of excitement at all about her discovery. Credits roll, the end, thank God.In summation, what makes this movie such a failure is the fact that there is no real relevance to anything. There is no conflict between any characters, no sort of real tension, and we are never made to care for these characters because they are all so stupid and mentally unbalanced that it is very difficult for any real logical person to feel sympathy towards their situation; especially since they are endangering the lives of their children throughout, and don't care in the name of their own selfish idiotic freedom. Their poverty and living situation is really their own fault, so even as a characterization aesthetic, the movie does nothing. Next, there is no real plot to speak of, this film seems to tease at moments where an intriguing plot is to take place, but nothing even does.Just cause I'm a nice guy, here are some suggestions to what COULD'VE happened to make this film, well, not suck so much: 1. The dad goes missing entirely and the girl must learn to survive on her own 2. the dad is abusive (this is hinted by never happens) and the girl must escape or learn to grow 3. The girl disagrees with the community's choice of lifestyle and insistence on their poverty and must break free and help them (no, this girl is just as dumb as the rest of them) 4. a tension or conflict between the kids and adults of any kind 5. beasts are real and threaten the lives of these people 6. the people TRY to get out of poverty but the real world shuns them, and then the real world can ACTUALLY be displayed as the bad guy in all their materialistic political superficiality, etc. 7. The little girl tries to create a closer relationship with her dying father...These are just some suggestions, but they could've been used to make this film even mildly interesting. But no, what we have is just 90 minutes of poor people doing dumb things with no relevance, no underlying points, no morals, no plot, no anything. The fact that this film was so hailed by critics just once again proves that art-house critics are the most pompous people in the world and like believing they are smart enough to see things that normal movie lovers don't see. Even as a piece of filmmaking art this thing fails. The little girl's performance does not warrant an oscar nomination in any way whatsoever.So in closing my point is pretty clear. Avoid this film. If you have to rent it, do so, but don't make the mistake I did and purchase it at full price.

I'm ok with less than ideal living conditions and elements of a dark theme.  But one always hopes that there will be a silver lining, a positive message that shines through.  No dice with this flick.  Its one of those experiences where 1/2 of the way through, you are saying &#34;Surely this is going get a lot better soon.&#34;  Then 2/3 of the way through you begin to think that isn't going to happen, but you hang on and keep watching even though your depression is increasing every 5 minutes.  At that point, you think that you've invested so much time in the film that you will stick it out.  I've seen a lot of movies and know that some of the BEST movies are those that really make you think and involve symbolism with a profound meaning.  The two of us struggled to find it.  Perhaps one has to have grown up in abject poverty in the south to understand and enjoy certain nuances.  If there is a greater meaning, someone please tell us!!  What were the prehistoric hogs about anyway?  How did they get all the way to the Bayou?  Too many questions.  It would seem that they represented the little girl's fears and strengths !??!

When her tough but loving father Wink (Dwight Henry) succumbs to a mysterious malady, the fierce and determined girl bravely sets out on a journey to the outside world. But Hushpuppy's quest is hindered by a ""busted"" universe that melts the ice caps and unleashes an army of prehistoric beasts.""That description, coupled with the picture of the girl on the front makes you think its a interesting movie about a child for children that adults would enjoy.

Her mother is a prostitute that abandoned her. Her father is a drunk, possibly mentally slow individual who suffers from seizures and seems to be dying of blood poisoning.Periodically you see these huge boars with tusks that are traveling towards the shanty town.

1542016,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B008220AGC,Tom Birkenstock,"[5, 8]","Ah, the joys of poverty.  It's really a load off when you don't have to worry about being shackled to a job, or having to please your boss, or accumulating an excess of money.  The fortunate poor can spend their days getting in tune with nature or drinking with a few of their best friends.  Who needs money when mother earth seems so willing to spontaneously generate grains, potable water, and livestock?At least this seems to be the message of Beasts of the Southern Wild, the type of movie about a poor community in the South that could only have been made by a member of the bourgeois from Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Beasts of the Southern Wild is an insidious film.  It purports to be about people struggling to make it in the world, but it's actually about the urban elite's desire to take a camping trip, get away from the hustle of the city, and maybe go canoeing.The movie doesn't take place in our world, not exactly.  Instead the movie attempts to craft a world of magical realism where a large scale ecological disaster can unfreeze giant boars and where crushing poverty is a choice rather than a failure of the economy.  And yet at the same time the film wants to be about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans's underclass.  It would be easy to claim that the movie can't have it both ways--that it can't be a fantasy world that also grapples with difficult real world problems.  But of course that's just not true.  Plenty of movies have delved into the world of make believe in order to get a better perspective on real world events.  The problem is that Beasts just doesn't do this very well.Beasts's protagonists is Hushpuppy, a girl about nine years old who lives with her drunken abusive father in a place called the Bathtub.  In what's assuredly one step removed from images of the noble savage, the movie portrays the denizens of the Bathtub as self-sufficient people who love drinking, dancing, and fireworks.  Their world is eventually upended when some sort of environmental catastrophe ends up flooding the Bathtub and everything else below a series of levees.  While a number of people choose to pack up and leave before they get hit with the flood, Hushpuppy and her father decide to face the storm head on, and they eventually hold up with several other men women and children who also refused to leave their homes.  Even after the flood they appear to manage pretty well until, that is, a group of faceless government agents apparently borrowed from E.T. come across these survivors.  The last residents of the Bathtub are taken to a hospital where they are forced to get medical attention and Hushpuppy even has to wear a dress.  But Hushpuppy and her folks haven't given up yet.  They organize a prison break of sorts, which, as far as I can tell, consists mostly of pushing over several doctors and nurses who seemed uninterested in chasing them down in the first place.If we are going to read this narrative as a corollary to New Orleans after Katrina (and the film seems to invite this reading), then there are a number of problems.  Where the film shows Bathtub residents choosing either to flee or wait out the storm, a large majority of New Orleans residents had no such choice.  Many people stayed in New Orleans prior to the storm because they did not have the money, the transportation, or the accommodations to get out of the city.  To represent this as a clear choice, and, furthermore, to suggest that those who left were running away like wimps (not the film's preferred choice of words), is at best lunkheaded and at worst offensive to those who died during Hurricane Katrina.  Later the film suggests that Hushpuppy, her father and the rest would have been fine if the ""gul' dern gov'ment"" hadn't gotten into their business.  The central problem after Hurricane Katrina wasn't too much government--it was that the government had essentially disowned an entire city.  In fact, the people of New Orleans had difficulty getting any substantive assistance from their own government for a number of days.I could go on about the film's uneven handling of alcohol, its narrative failures, and total lack of characterization beyond Hushpuppy.  But because my mother taught me right, I'll end by pointing out a few things I liked.  The visuals are at times striking (even if a little too reminiscent of those pretentious Levi's ads).  Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis turns in a great performance in the lead role, especially considering that she has to pretty much carry the entire movie.  I admit that I enjoyed watching her run around and yell like an animal.  And the giant boars were pretty cool.  Maybe next time the director should include more giant boars.",2,Discover the Joys of Poverty,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,4708,"['Ah', 'joys', 'poverty', 'really', 'load', 'off', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'being', 'shackled', 'job', 'having', 'please', 'boss', 'accumulating', 'excess', 'money', 'fortunate', 'poor', 'can', 'spend', 'days', 'getting', 'tune', 'nature', 'drinking', 'few', 'best', 'friends', 'Who', 'money', 'when', 'mother', 'earth', 'so', 'willing', 'spontaneously', 'generate', 'grains', 'potable', 'water', 'livestock', 'least', 'be', 'message', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'type', 'movie', 'poor', 'community', 'South', 'could', 'only', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'member', 'bourgeois', 'Williamsburg', 'Brooklyn', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'insidious', 'film', 'be', 'people', 'struggling', 'make', 'world', 'actually', 'urban', 'elite', 'desire', 'take', 'camping', 'trip', 'get', 'away', 'hustle', 'city', 'maybe', 'go', 'canoeing.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'world', 'not', 'exactly', 'Instead', 'movie', 'craft', 'world', 'magical', 'realism', 'where', 'large', 'scale', 'ecological', 'disaster', 'can', 'unfreeze', 'giant', 'boars', 'where', 'crushing', 'poverty', 'choice', 'rather', 'failure', 'economy', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'be', 'effects', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'New', 'Orleans', 'underclass', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'claim', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fantasy', 'world', 'also', 'difficult', 'real', 'world', 'problems', 'course', 'just', 'not', 'true', 'Plenty', 'movies', 'have', 'delved', 'world', 'make', 'believe', 'order', 'get', 'better', 'perspective', 'real', 'world', 'events', 'problem', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'protagonists', 'Hushpuppy', 'girl', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'drunken', 'abusive', 'father', 'place', 'called', 'Bathtub', 'what', 'assuredly', 'one', 'step', 'removed', 'images', 'noble', 'savage', 'movie', 'denizens', 'Bathtub', 'self-sufficient', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'drinking', 'dancing', 'fireworks', 'world', 'eventually', 'upended', 'when', 'sort', 'environmental', 'catastrophe', 'up', 'flooding', 'Bathtub', 'everything', 'else', 'series', 'levees', 'number', 'people', 'choose', 'pack', 'up', 'leave', 'get', 'hit', 'flood', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'decide', 'face', 'storm', 'head', 'eventually', 'hold', 'up', 'several', 'other', 'men', 'women', 'children', 'who', 'also', 'refused', 'leave', 'homes', 'Even', 'flood', 'appear', 'manage', 'pretty', 'well', 'group', 'faceless', 'government', 'agents', 'apparently', 'borrowed', 'E.T', 'come', 'survivors', 'last', 'residents', 'Bathtub', 'are', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'get', 'medical', 'attention', 'Hushpuppy', 'even', 'wear', 'dress', 'Hushpuppy', 'folks', 'have', ""n't"", 'given', 'up', 'yet', 'organize', 'prison', 'break', 'sorts', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'mostly', 'pushing', 'several', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'who', 'seemed', 'uninterested', 'chasing', 'down', 'first', 'place.If', 'are', 'going', 'read', 'narrative', 'corollary', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Katrina', 'film', 'invite', 'reading', 'then', 'are', 'number', 'problems', 'Where', 'film', 'Bathtub', 'residents', 'choosing', 'flee', 'wait', 'out', 'storm', 'large', 'majority', 'New', 'Orleans', 'residents', 'had', 'such', 'choice', 'Many', 'people', 'stayed', 'New', 'Orleans', 'prior', 'storm', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'money', 'transportation', 'accommodations', 'get', 'city', 'represent', 'clear', 'choice', 'furthermore', 'suggest', 'who', 'left', 'were', 'running', 'away', 'wimps', 'not', 'film', 'preferred', 'choice', 'words', 'best', 'lunkheaded', 'worst', 'offensive', 'who', 'died', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'Later', 'film', 'Hushpuppy', 'father', 'rest', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'gul', 'dern', ""gov'ment"", 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'business', 'central', 'problem', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'government', 'was', 'government', 'had', 'essentially', 'disowned', 'entire', 'city', 'fact', 'people', 'New', 'Orleans', 'had', 'difficulty', 'getting', 'substantive', 'assistance', 'own', 'government', 'number', 'days.I', 'could', 'go', 'film', 'uneven', 'handling', 'alcohol', 'narrative', 'failures', 'total', 'lack', 'characterization', 'Hushpuppy', 'mother', 'taught', 'right', ""'ll"", 'end', 'pointing', 'out', 'few', 'things', 'liked', 'visuals', 'are', 'times', 'striking', 'even', 'little', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'pretentious', 'Levi', 'ads', 'Quvenzhan', 'eacute', 'Wallis', 'great', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'especially', 'considering', 'pretty', 'much', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'run', 'around', 'yell', 'animal', 'giant', 'boars', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', 'director', 'should', 'include', 'more', 'giant', 'boars']",Beasts of the Southern Wild

The film also has a message about the way we live, most obviously seen in the crab-eating scene.

1542025,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008220AGC,Turfseer,"[31, 51]","***This review may contain spoilers***Every year, the critics seem to fall in love with one horribly overrated film. Last year it was 'The Artist', a derivative tale filmed in the long defunct style of a silent movie. At least 'The Artist' won points for capturing a certain style of filmmaking, but this year's candidate for most pretentious and overrated film, 'The Beasts of the Southern Wild', almost defies description.Anyway, I'll try. Don't expect any attempt here to create characters that have any relation to real people. 'Beasts' is designed to enter the realm of myth. We're taken to a mythical land dubbed 'The Bathtub', a Louisiana Bayou community cut off from the rest of the world by a levee. The houses (if you can call them that), appear to be nothing more than ramshackle shelters, in what appears to be a post-Katrina environment.Almost every critic seems to be taken in by the youngest actor ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar: six-year-old (now nine) Quevenzhan&eacute; Wallis. Wallis (in the role of 'Hushpuppy') really should be nominated for best acting in a horror film as she plays an emotionally distant, pyromaniac who is the victim of child abuse on the part of her father, Wink, who actually slaps the child, causing her to fall violently to the ground. If you can believe this, the rambunctious Hushpuppy retaliates in kind, by striking Wink, who briefly appears to lose consciousness.Director Benh Zeitlin attempts to mitigate Wink's violent demeanor, by depicting him as some kind of 'tough love' saint, who saves the child through a raging Katrina-like storm, after constructing a floating shelter out of flood debris. At one point, Crazy Wink fends off the storm by shooting at the clouds, reassuring the now scared child. Later, he hatches an ill-advised plan to drain salt water brought in by the storm surge, by dynamiting the levee. The bottom line is that Zeitlin wants it both ways: Wink is both a violent child abuser but underneath, a self-sacrificing and devoted father. How touching!If this isn't ridiculous enough, the townspeople are all dysfunctional with drinking problems. After everyone is evacuated by FEMA-like stooges, Hushpuppy's comrades all make a beeline back to their ruined, condemned community. These salt of the earth are particularly good at sucking the heads of craw-fish. David Edelstein in New York Magazine puts it best when describing the denizens of the mythical Bathtub: ""Late in the film, Hushpuppy's surrogate family is absurdly romanticized, their drunken dysfunction ennobled, as if living below sea level puts you on a higher spiritual plane.""Don't ask me to explain the meaning of the actual 'beasts' of the film's title. In the beginning of the film, we learn that melting polar ice caps are releasing prehistoric creatures called 'Aurochs'. During a screening, I learned that a separate camera crew took ten days to film five month old pigs dressed up with horns, to suggest giant wild boars. Hushpuppy later bonds with the creatures after she returns to the 'Bathtub' with her drunken, salt of the earth friends.Wouldn't you know it that Wink has contracted a terminal illness and Hushpuppy is there for a grand send-off at the funeral pyre. That, dear friends, is 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' in a nutshell. Everyone turns out to be wonderful in the end, including the former child abuser but now lovable (but terminally ill), Wink.

1542033,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008220AGC,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[15, 31]","I have to say that I went into this film very much prepared to like it.  The trailer looked promising, it had gotten abundant critical praise, and had won the Camera d'Or prize at Cannes for best first film and the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival.  Within the first five minutes though, I found myself regretting it.  So in preface I must say that my opinion is almost certainly a minority one and I would recommend reading other reviews before making a decision on whether or not to see this film.It's very difficult to attempt to describe Beasts of the Southern Wild.  On the one hand, it has as its biggest positive a remarkable performance by newcomer Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis as Hushpuppy, the young girl who serves as the film's central character.  And there are moments in the film where you have these beautifully framed shots - usually around Hushpuppy - that give it a certain almost mystical grace.  As do the occasional moments of poetic clarity delivered in the form of Hushpuppy's inner narrative, in lines like this one:""The whole universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If one piece busts, even the smallest piece... the whole universe will get busted.""But then there's the rest of the film, which unfortunately consists of a rambling, chaotic and largely incoherent mess.  And therein lies my problem with Beasts of the Southern Wild.The plot - as near as I can tell - begins with a little girl named Hushpuppy who lives with (well, next to, actually) her father, a man named Wink (Dwight Henry) who seems mentally disturbed half the time and dying the other half, as part of a sort-of community called The Bathtub which exists somewhere along the Gulf Coast, most probably Louisiana (where the film was shot) though it's never made clear.  Their home consists of two ramshackle hovels - with a small intervening space left to separate the two - seemingly made from pieces of mobile homes and vehicles apparently scavenged and salvaged from somewhere.  As does the rest of The Bathtub, whose residents seem to either lay about in a vaguely social stupor or else get agitated about someone possibly coming to move them out of their squalor and into a shelter.Then, in what feel like random sequences, we learn that Hushpuppy has an almost mystical attachment to living things.  That her father always seems to have a plucked chicken ready to cook up that he gets from a beat-up cooler that never has any ice.  That somewhere ice-caps and glaciers (footage of same inserted) are breaking up. That sometimes her father suddenly turns up in a hospital gown with a tag on his wrist even though we never saw him leave, never saw the hospital he went to or how he got there and back.  That Hushpuppy for some reason starts a fire that burns up her residence.  Oh, and that it starts raining and the water suddenly starts to flood the area, though whether this is because of the rain, or the melting ice, or a levee that exists nearby is never made clear.  Nor is it made clear why suddenly there are these creatures called aurochs - think giant hairy hogs with elephant tusks sticking out of their mouths and foreheads - wandering around.Is it set in the present or the future?  I don't know.  Is it fantasy? Science-fiction? Magical realism?  An ecological cautionary parable?  I don't know.  Does Hushpuppy get reunited with her mother?  Do we even figure out who her mother is?  I don't know.  Does anything that happened in this film have any point or make any sense at all?  Sadly, I do not know.I did say ""rambling, chaotic and largely incoherent"", yes?  It's like there were two vastly different people involved in making this movie.  One - the one who came up with the occasional beautifully-framed shots and Hushpuppy's moments of inner narrative - who knew what they were doing.  And one - the one responsible for the rest of the film - who didn't.It is probably worth noting some of the background to Beasts of the Southern Wild as it may offer some possible explanations for why the film is the way it is.  The film is director Benh Zeitlin's first feature film after having previously directed three short films.  The script was written by Zeitlin and Lucy Alibar, adapted from Alibar's one-act play Juicy and Delicious.  It is her first writing credit.  (Note: although Beasts of the Southern Wild is also the title of a short-story written by Doris Betts in the 1990's, there is no connection between that story and this one.)  The film was shot in 16mm by a professional film crew on a comparative shoestring budget of $1.8M in Louisiana with a cast of mostly locals, so it's the very definition of a small indie film.  But quite frankly, most small indie films I've seen were more coherent and better made, a prime example for contrast being Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed, another small indie film released at about the same time that had an even smaller budget of $750K but which I enjoyed much more.  Without knowing more of the background, the only possible explanation for the problems with Beasts of the Southern Wild seems to be the relative inexperience of the writers and director.  And almost certainly the editors, Crockett Doob and Affonso Gonalves as well.If Beasts of the Southern Wild is worth seeing at all, it is for Quvenzhan&eacute; Wallis's performance.  With a remarkably expressive face and genuine screen presence, particularly for a six or seven year-old, she is truly a natural and the camera loves her.  It would be inaccurate to say she steals every scene she's in.  Any cute child actor can do that.  Wallis _owns_ every scene she's in.  Or at least she does when the chaos isn't overwhelming the scene and the camera will stop jumping around long enough to let her.As I said, my opinion definitely seems to be in the minority, but in all honesty I cannot recommend Beasts of the Southern Wild on its own merits.  The only reason I could recommend it would be if you're willing to put up with its serious flaws in order to see the first performance of a truly remarkable young actress who probably has great things ahead of her.",2,A brilliant new discovery and moments of poetic beauty get lost in an incoherent mess,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,6127,"['have', 'say', 'went', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'prepared',
