There is none of the bluster, bad language and naughty wardrobe malfunctions of &#34;Immortal Beloved&#34; or the earthiness of Ed Harris's &#34;Copying Beethoven (which is also a wonderful film); rather, this is a film produced for children, but older kids and adults will like it, too!

The actor portraying Beethoven so well embodies the genius and personality of the composer, that it is impossible to believe it isn't really he.  The story centers around a young boy who resents having to open his house up to borders.  Especially one with such a difficult personality as Beethoven.  Eventually, however, he learns to appreciate the genius of the man.  And by the end of the film, you will find yourself wanting to watch the 9th Symphony scene over and over and over again!  The music all throughout the film is Beethoven's and it includes some especially lovely selections of his.  As always with the David Devine films, we are treated to both history, genius, and delightful entertainment all in one.  It is appropriate for family viewing and will definitely inspire one to both listen and play Beethoven's pieces with a much deeper appreciation than before.",5,Entertaining and Delightful!,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",2012,950,"['checked', 'local', 'library', 'were', 'fascinated', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Beethoven', 'so', 'well', 'genius', 'personality', 'composer', 'impossible', 'believe', ""n't"", 'really', 'story', 'centers', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'having', 'open', 'house', 'borders', 'Especially', 'one', 'difficult', 'personality', 'Beethoven', 'Eventually', 'however', 'appreciate', 'genius', 'man', 'end', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', '9th', 'Symphony', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'music', 'film', 'Beethoven', 'especially', 'lovely', 'selections', 'always', 'David', 'Devine', 'films', 'are', 'treated', 'history', 'genius', 'delightful', 'entertainment', 'one', 'appropriate', 'family', 'viewing', 'will', 'definitely', 'inspire', 'one', 'listen', 'play', 'Beethoven', 'pieces', 'much', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'before']",N/A

322443,A2XUXEYN4QMH0K,6302598834,"L. Jones ""History Fan in LV""","[5, 5]","First, kudos to the reviewers of ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs"" who understand the difference between entertainment and a biography. They, as I, appreciated:*  how the creators of this fine movie were faithful to Beethoven -- his music, his tantrums with the maid (REALLY DID HAPPEN), his ""half nudity"" (REALLY DID HAPPEN) and his explosive temperament (REALLY DID HAPPEN).*  the creators applied snippets of his beautiful music to illustrate the drama, comedy et al of not only Beethoven's personality, but the movie's plot as well.*  Neil Munro's uncanny characterization of Beethoven. Of the Beethoven movies out there (Immortal Beloved, Copying  Beethoven), Munro's Beethoven was spot-on. His body type, face, expressions, personality, all were as if he lifted them from Beethoven biographies.*  the creators' full respect for Beethoven. Beethoven himself took pride in being ""fiery"". And yes, he was a cool guy: He loved kids and animals, all of nature. He despised the aristocracy ('though he needed them) and anyone who didn't appreciate music as art.Now, a slap on the head to the detractors. THE MOVIE IS ENTERTAINMENT. It is NOT a biography. It has just so much time to tell one-tenth of Beethoven's story that will appeal to kids and not lose their interest. The movie cannot possibly contain all of Beethoven's works!  And  if you don't like the ""maid violence"" and his so-called nudity, I gotta say: It must be tough living with your head in the sand. This movie has all the drama, comedy and APPROPRIATE realism that's suitable for kids. If you don't like the bare-minimum reality of his life, scrub your kids' eyeballs clean and crawl back into your hole. Sheesh.As a Beethoven researcher of more than 20 years, I must say that ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs"" is the MOST accurate portrayal of Beethoven that I have ever seen. The other movies mentioned are embarrassments to a sublime composer and gifted man. (His sister-in-law as his lover??? When he really despised her for taking his brother away from him and called her a slut in court? Yeah, Ok).And by the way: ""Beethoven Lives Upstairs"" entertains the adults as well! You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it.

I was a little bit disappointed in the first part of the movie, because it shows quite a bit of negativity. At the beginning the little boy only complains about Beethoven living with them ,but then he becomes his friend. So that development of thier relationship is positive. The interactions between the maid and him are very negative also some of the conversations and Beethovens anger outbursts are extreme. I would not buy the movie, bec I don't want my children be exposed to that negativity. It also shows Beethoven a few times w/upper part nudity. The whole movie only portrays a small part of Beethovens live. But it did create more desire to learn about the composer.
