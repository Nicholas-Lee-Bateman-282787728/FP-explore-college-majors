Bouardi,"[6, 11]","I have to say...of the reviews I've read and the few people I've spoken with, I seem to be the only one who was completely disappointed with the story in Mohabbatein.  I have been encouraged to watch this film since 2 years ago and had eagerly looked forward to it, but didn't like a thing about it.  I found myself more eager to hit the fast forward button.  All of the actresses in the film, except Aishwariya Rai, were quite unattractive and scantily-dressed...which for me was a big turn-off to whatever depth the film was trying to offer.  I didn't enjoy any of the big dance numbers or the songs included.  I found the dancing to be very average and the love stories (with the exception of the widow) all seemed to lack depth...and looked more like teenage crushes rather than meaningful romances.  I found myself siding more and more with Amitabh Bachchan's character in regards to discipline and focus, and felt betrayed when the director had his character do a moral 180.  I also found the character of Aishwariya's to be annoyingly stupid...as I couldn't understand the justification for suicide, unless she was being forced to marry another boy. I never cared for any character in the film...and I only enjoyed the few references to Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.",2,Am I the only one?,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,1263,"['have', 'say', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'few', 'people', ""'ve"", 'spoken', 'seem', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'completely', 'disappointed', 'story', 'Mohabbatein', 'have', 'been', 'encouraged', 'watch', 'film', '2', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'eagerly', 'looked', 'forward', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'thing', 'found', 'more', 'eager', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'actresses', 'film', 'Aishwariya', 'Rai', 'were', 'quite', 'unattractive', 'scantily-dressed', 'was', 'big', 'turn-off', 'depth', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'offer', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'big', 'dance', 'numbers', 'songs', 'included', 'found', 'dancing', 'be', 'very', 'average', 'love', 'stories', 'exception', 'widow', 'seemed', 'lack', 'depth', 'looked', 'more', 'teenage', 'crushes', 'rather', 'meaningful', 'romances', 'found', 'siding', 'more', 'more', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'character', 'regards', 'discipline', 'focus', 'felt', 'betrayed', 'when', 'director', 'had', 'character', 'do', 'moral', '180', 'also', 'found', 'character', 'Aishwariya', 'be', 'annoyingly', 'stupid', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'justification', 'suicide', 'was', 'being', 'forced', 'marry', 'boy', 'never', 'cared', 'character', 'film', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'references', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai']",N/A

The film is 3.5 hours long which might have put off some of the viewers.At the heart of this story is the battle of fear versus love and centers around 4 young men (3 students and one former student) whose lives intertwined and were affected at India's most prestigious mens college, Gurukul.  For 25 years, headmaster Narayan Shankar, ran his college with strict protocol based in Gurukul's unshakeable pillars of tradition, honor, and discipline.  Should any student tarnish Gurukul's impeccable reputation by breaking any of its rules, he would be immediately expelled from the school, in turn affording him no opportunity to enter any other university or receive employment.Along comes Mr. Raj Aryan, the one known student in Gurukul to have been expelled because of his love for the headmaster's daughter.  The manner of his dismissal was so abrupt that the headmaster expelled Raj without even having met him, an action which prompted the distraught daughter to take her own life.  Raj is back to teach the headmaster a lesson and is determined to change the ways of Gurukul forever.  Thus the battle of fear versus love begins.  Taking cues from their teacher, our three young students are inspired to take risks in love and life.The songs and dance were colorful and beautiful, and the movie is well editted when brining Aishwarya Rai's spirit character into the storyline.

As violin teacher at an all-boy boarding school, he tries to instill some fun and allow the boys to learn the value of love, which puts him at odds with the headmaster of the school who is more interested in success and discipline.  This leads inevitably to a ""showdown.""  In this movie, Shahrukh's character does not have a lot of range, and he is not necessarily the character with the most screen time, but there are some good dance numbers and songs, and there is an air of mystery that lingers around his ""lost love.""  I bought the video because of the scene where Shahrukh challenges Amitabh for the hearts and minds of the students during a thunder storm, and for the scene where Shahrukh beats the drum in the square when Amitabh finds the students dancing when they were forbidden to do so.

My daughter read the back cover and decided not to watch it with me. It is for this reason I am writing this review. She missed something here and I throughly enjoyed a movie that was nothing  like the cover suggested really.It is thoughtful in many ways but it is very much about the triumph of love-not really a clash of wills.There really is only one stubborn man who, as a principal, rules his university with fear and rules. There is another man who persists with trying to change him to open up the love within him.There are also developed subplots about love stories with 3 of the young men from the university. These were all engaging. The length of Bollywood movies I've found I now like (as long as you arent sitting in a cinema all this time and can take an intermission from your DVD- or watch over several nights like a miniseries!) The longer movie gives more time for character development so I find I care a lot more about the fate of the protagonists.I really enjoyed this movie and suspect it will reign as one of my favorites. The performances are excellent. I cant recall any particularly memorable songs or dances - though both were fine and plenty of them. But the story and the performances were what did it for me.Bollywood of course is dripping with romance. However there are some deeper thoughts from this one that stayed with me to think about e.g. being able to maintain an open heart and enjoyment of your love whether of not it is returned by the other person (ie that love is about your feelings and the gift they give to YOU and this isnt conditional on whether they are returned or someone dies and exits your life); questions about love and fear and which is the greatest force- and the question it poses about what is life really about (love and openheartedness, or being shutdown and just achievement focused).The calibre of the actors and the scripting means these questions feel of a different quality to romantic one-liners we are used to (or at least for me).The legacy of this movie is about joy not about a clash of 2 stubborn people.",5,Different to advertised story on DVD cover -and terrific!,1226448000,"11 12, 2008",2008,2231,"['When', 'read', 'DVD', 'cover', 'two', 'stubborn', 'men', 'grim', 'pictures', 'front', 'cover', 'version', 'thought', 'was', 'be', 'serious', 'drama', 'daughter', 'read', 'back', 'cover', 'decided', 'not', 'watch', 'reason', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'missed', 'something', 'here', 'throughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'cover', 'suggested', 'really.It', 'thoughtful', 'many', 'ways', 'very', 'much', 'triumph', 'love-not', 'really', 'clash', 'wills.There', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'stubborn', 'man', 'who', 'principal', 'rules', 'university', 'fear', 'rules', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'change', 'open', 'up', 'love', 'him.There', 'are', 'also', 'developed', 'subplots', 'love', 'stories', '3', 'young', 'men', 'university', 'were', 'engaging', 'length', 'Bollywood', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'found', 'now', 'like', 'as', 'long', 'arent', 'sitting', 'cinema', 'time', 'can', 'take', 'intermission', 'DVD-', 'watch', 'several', 'nights', 'miniseries', 'longer', 'movie', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'find', 'care', 'lot', 'more', 'fate', 'protagonists.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'suspect', 'will', 'reign', 'one', 'favorites', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'cant', 'recall', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'songs', 'dances', 'were', 'fine', 'plenty', 'story', 'performances', 'were', 'what', 'did', 'me.Bollywood', 'course', 'dripping', 'romance', 'However', 'are', 'deeper', 'thoughts', 'one', 'stayed', 'think', 'e.g', 'being', 'able', 'maintain', 'open', 'heart', 'enjoyment', 'love', 'not', 'returned', 'other', 'person', 'ie', 'love', 'feelings', 'gift', 'give', 'YOU', 'isnt', 'conditional', 'are', 'returned', 'someone', 'dies', 'exits', 'life', 'questions', 'love', 'fear', 'greatest', 'force-', 'question', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'love', 'openheartedness', 'being', 'shutdown', 'just', 'achievement', 'focused', '.The', 'calibre', 'actors', 'scripting', 'questions', 'feel', 'different', 'quality', 'romantic', 'one-liners', 'are', 'used', 'least', '.The', 'legacy', 'movie', 'about', 'joy', 'not', 'clash', '2', 'stubborn', 'people']",N/A

I wanted to see it because it had Aishwarya Rai (yes, I'm a big fan of hers) and because I find Mr. Sharukh Khan watchable: He's got something, some ""it"" factor, even if he's not the best actor you'll come across. The surprise for me was the older gentleman. I found he had great charisma, Mr. Amitab Bachan--tall, distinguished looking, that terrifically deep voice. It was interesting to see the younger, more physical Mr. Khan in his confrontations with the elegant Mr. Bachan.Basically, this is a story of four loves--three current, one past. The teacher of a renowned school has very strict rules. He's an unyielding man, strict and humorless. To his school come three young men who become pals and one man to join the faculty as a music teacher. Through the interaction of the Older School Head and the music teacher, we learn of the old love story and see how confrontation and mercy can bring about a salutatory change in even the hardest of hearts. Through the interaction of the music teacher and the three students, we see how a teacher can influence his pupils. Through the love stories, we see how difficulties cannot stamp out true love. Eventually, even a past tragedy is redeemed in the present, and wounded hearts heal.The film is worth buying just for the Holi festival musical/dance number. It's just fabulous--the white clothing, the tinted powders that are strewn and begin to color every participant. The joyfulness and emotion. A terrific Bollywood number.My favorite of the ""young"" love stories was the one with the widow, very moving. My least favorite was the one with the ""hip athletic"" couple. Kinda annoying. The ""middling"" one had a very immature heroine who, although ""quite cute"" according to my husband, was not the brightest bulb in the box. Then again, these ARE young folks, so my expectations may be too high.As usual, Bollywood flicks offer good-looking actors, nifty costumes, and good music.

575391,ACVFTS9X2MKJ8,B000059Z92,"Rykre ""The Rogue Scholar""","[4, 5]","I like many Yash Raj films. The others are ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", ""Khabhi Khushie Kabhie Gham,"" ""Veer-Zaara,"" and maybe ""Kal Ho Naa Ho.""  Outside of Yash Raj Bollywood films, my favorite is still ""Lagaan.""  And I could go on and on about great Bollywood films.  But anyway....Once in a while, even great Bollywood films have dumb lines, or they try to be funny and really, it just comes off as childish.  Like in this movie, Vicram is teasing Sameer by saying: ""Sameer's got a girlfriend!  Na-na-na-na-Na!""But what really annoys me about many Bollywood films (especially love stories), is when two people first meet each other, there's this wash of vocal orchestration that just sounds so stupid, and comes off so loud, like we wouldn't know that these two people are going to have a connection with each other unless this loud wash of vocal orchestration gives us this obvious hint.  We see the girl, and then the background music comes on loudly: ""Do-do-do-Dooooo"", Ahh, ah, ah, ah, Ahhhh.""  God, I hate it when movies do that. I can kinda understand why some Indians hate to watch their own Bollywood films, and would rather watch more American movies that don't make you feel like you have to be led to understand what's happening. Honestly, I'm hearing more Indian people tell me that they hate Bollywood films for this reason.  Plus, some Bollywood films have so much music, it makes you wanna throw up!  Even I can get to that point.  All that d*mn music is what makes a Bollywood movie run for nearly three hours or more.Anyway, ""Mohabbatein"" has a serious all-star cast.  The ever popular Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, and world beauty Aishwarya Rai. Anapham Kher is here as well.  He's never really been the main character in films, but he sure manages to get in many big box office features. Plus, the beautiful Preeti Jianjiani, Shamita Shetty, and Kim Sharma.Anyway, this movie is a story of about five or six little sub-stories all weaved together, extending from the main purpose of the story.  Gurukul (an all-male school) is headed by a stern headmaster named Narayan Shankar, played by Amitabh Bachchan, who is a hard and bitter man who doesn't believe in love.  Only independent intelligence.  He believes love is a means of weakness of a man. His bitterness comes from when his own daughter committed suicide after her father forbids her from seeing a student of the school, of whom he never even allowed himself to meet.  And, without meeting him, he was expelled from the school immediately.So, a musician comes to the college to offer his services as a teacher of fine music.  With a little resistance from the headmaster, he eventually convinces the headmaster to employ him.  Not, only does he teach the students to play music, he also shares his story of his lost love.  For he was the student that was in love with the headmaster's now dead daughter.The story focuses also on three other students and the three girls who enter their lives in the city off campus. Their stories start to unfold with resistance of their pursuit of love even though the headmaster forbids any interaction of his students with the outside girls.  It is the music teachers goal to penetrate the headmaster's icy cold heart and to let him know and learn that love is what life is all about.  What's the point of living, if you've lost everything worth living for?I've only given a small introduction to this wonderful three and a half hour movie, but, as you watch it, you will get to know and understand every character and the struggles they endure in a world of forced mind sets, hard-headed traditions, and the willingness to accept defeat and learn to appreciate life.And, believe it or not, this movie is available on Blu-ray (sold by an independent source through Amazon) such as I have recently ordered.  This is great, because I almost have all five of my top favorite Bollywood films on Blu-Ray.  I'm still waiting for ""Lagaan.""UPDATE: What's really a great thing about this Blu-ray edition of ""Mohabbatein"": It doesn't force you to have to watch a bunch of other movie previews before the movie starts.  Sometimes we're stuck having to watch previews that we can't skip or fast-forward through.  You pop this Blu-Ray disc in, and you can start the movie right away.  Yeah, I really do appreciate that.  I'd rather watch other movie previews AFTER I've watched the movie.",5,This is one of my Top Five favorite Bollywood films,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,4388,"['like', 'many', 'Yash', 'Raj', 'films', 'others', 'are', 'Kuch', 'Kuch', 'Hota', 'Hai', 'Khabhi', 'Khushie', 'Kabhie', 'Gham', 'Veer-Zaara', 'maybe', 'Kal', 'Ho', 'Naa', 'Ho', 'Yash', 'Raj', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'favorite', 'still', 'Lagaan', 'could', 'go', 'great', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'anyway', '.Once', 'while', 'even', 'great', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'have', 'dumb', 'lines', 'try', 'be', 'funny', 'really', 'just', 'off', 'childish', 'movie', 'Vicram', 'teasing', 'Sameer', 'saying', 'Sameer', 'got', 'girlfriend', 'Na-na-na-na-Na', 'what', 'really', 'many', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'especially', 'love', 'stories', 'when', 'two', 'people', 'first', 'meet', 'other', 'wash', 'vocal', 'orchestration', 'just', 'so', 'stupid', 'off', 'so', 'loud', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'connection', 'other', 'loud', 'wash', 'vocal', 'orchestration', 'obvious', 'hint', 'see', 'girl', 'then', 'background', 'music', 'loudly', 'Do-do-do-Dooooo', 'Ahh', 'ah', 'ah', 'ah', 'Ahhhh', 'God', 'hate', 'when', 'movies', 'do', 'can', 'kinda', 'understand', 'why', 'Indians', 'hate', 'watch', 'own', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'more', 'American', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'be', 'led', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'hearing', 'more', 'Indian', 'people', 'tell', 'hate', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'reason', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'wan', 'throw', 'up', 'Even', 'can', 'get', 'point', 'd*mn', 'music', 'what', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'run', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'more.Anyway', 'Mohabbatein', 'serious', 'all-star', 'cast', 'ever', 'popular', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'world', 'beauty', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Anapham', 'Kher', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'films', 'sure', 'get', 'many', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'features', 'beautiful', 'Preeti', 'Jianjiani', 'Shamita', 'Shetty', 'Kim', 'Sharma.Anyway', 'movie', 'story', 'about', 'five', 'six', 'little', 'sub-stories', 'weaved', 'together', 'extending', 'main', 'purpose', 'story', 'Gurukul', 'all-male', 'school', 'headed', 'stern', 'headmaster', 'named', 'Narayan', 'Shankar', 'played', 'Amitabh', 'Bachchan', 'who', 'hard', 'bitter', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'love', 'Only', 'independent', 'intelligence', 'love', 'means', 'weakness', 'man', 'bitterness', 'when', 'own', 'daughter', 'committed', 'suicide', 'father', 'seeing', 'student', 'school', 'whom', 'never', 'even', 'allowed', 'meet', 'meeting', 'was', 'expelled', 'school', 'immediately.So', 'musician', 'college', 'offer', 'services', 'teacher', 'fine', 'music', 'little', 'resistance', 'headmaster', 'eventually', 'headmaster', 'employ', 'Not', 'only', 'teach', 'students', 'play', 'music', 'also', 'shares', 'story', 'lost', 'love', 'was', 'student', 'was', 'love', 'headmaster', 'now', 'dead', 'daughter.The', 'story', 'also', 'three', 'other', 'students', 'three', 'girls', 'who', 'enter', 'lives', 'city', 'off', 'campus', 'stories', 'start', 'unfold', 'resistance', 'pursuit', 'love', 'even', 'headmaster', 'interaction', 'students', 'outside', 'girls', 'music', 'teachers', 'goal', 'penetrate', 'headmaster', 'icy', 'cold', 'heart', 'let', 'know', 'learn', 'love', 'what', 'life', 'about', 'What', 'point', 'living', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'everything', 'worth', 'living', ""'ve"", 'only', 'given', 'small', 'introduction', 'wonderful', 'three', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'watch', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'character', 'struggles', 'endure', 'world', 'forced', 'mind', 'sets', 'hard-headed', 'traditions', 'willingness', 'accept', 'defeat', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'life.And', 'believe', 'not', 'movie', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'sold', 'independent', 'source', 'Amazon', 'such', 'have', 'recently', 'ordered', 'great', 'almost', 'have', 'five', 'top', 'favorite', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'Blu-Ray', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'Lagaan', 'UPDATE', 'What', 'really', 'great', 'thing', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'Mohabbatein', ""n't"", 'force', 'have', 'watch', 'bunch', 'other', 'movie', 'previews', 'movie', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'having', 'watch', 'previews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'fast-forward', 'pop', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', 'can', 'start', 'movie', 'right', 'away', 'Yeah', 'really', 'do', 'appreciate', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'other', 'movie', 'previews', 'AFTER', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie']",N/A

If you are looking for him to be the center of attention in this movie, you will be disappointed as this is one of the very few, that he is not. It is mainly about 3 students at a college in India, who become best friends and what happens while they are there. Where SRK comes in, is he is one of their teachers who kinda bombards his way into a job on the campus as a music teacher, where the stern Amitabh Bachchan is President and Lord over all and certainly shows it in no uncertain terms. He (SRK) then starts to slyly change certain rules and traditions at the college, that Bachchan has had in place for ages and irritates him to no end. But SRK has a secret of his own that ties in with Bachchan and in the end, has to force his hand. However, this is side story to the students but ties in as well, with what is happening in their love lives and school. To me, SRK can do no wrong, no matter how cheesy or happy-ending the movie (unless he dies and then I am mad) and this did not disappoint me. Some people say his acting is self promoting but if it is so, it is only because it is the wish of the nation of India that makes it so, considering he is the absolutely undisputed King of Bollywood and life to them. Having seen him play in so many roles, I can say, he truly deserves his ranking.
