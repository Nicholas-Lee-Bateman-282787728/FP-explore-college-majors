The film is that but it is also much more. It is a testement to the power of music and the power of Jerry Garcia to hold it all together.Shot during the final tour of 1995, Meeske followed the band and its nomadic followers on both the spring and summer legs of the tour that would end three months later with Garcia's death from heart failure. If there is a point to all of this is that the fans may change over the years, sometimes admittedly for the worse but the spirit of the community createed by the bad was a lifestyle that was worth preserving. The film ends with the memorial service for Garcia held in Golden Gate Park. The service was not only for Garcia and his music it was for a time  period that would never rise again.The film is shot on handheld DV. The image is raw but never hard to watch. The picture comes across as home movie like. The sound is Dolby 2.0 and was recorded a little too low for my liking. There are ample special features including bonus footage, the complete memorail service and some interviews.This is one for the fans or for those who want to relive a lifestyle that is now sadly gone forever.",3,Deadheads Unite,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1271,"['Brent', 'Meeske', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'End', 'Road', 'billed', 'tribute', 'fans', 'who', 'followed', 'band', 'tour', 'thirty', 'years', 'film', 'also', 'much', 'more', 'testement', 'power', 'music', 'power', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'hold', 'together.Shot', 'final', 'tour', '1995', 'Meeske', 'followed', 'band', 'nomadic', 'followers', 'spring', 'summer', 'legs', 'tour', 'would', 'end', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'Garcia', 'death', 'heart', 'failure', 'point', 'fans', 'may', 'change', 'years', 'sometimes', 'admittedly', 'worse', 'spirit', 'community', 'createed', 'bad', 'was', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'worth', 'preserving', 'film', 'memorial', 'service', 'Garcia', 'held', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Park', 'service', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'Garcia', 'music', 'was', 'time', 'period', 'would', 'never', 'rise', 'again.The', 'film', 'shot', 'handheld', 'DV', 'image', 'raw', 'never', 'hard', 'watch', 'picture', 'home', 'movie', 'sound', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'was', 'recorded', 'little', 'too', 'low', 'liking', 'are', 'ample', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'bonus', 'footage', 'complete', 'memorail', 'service', 'interviews.This', 'one', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'relive', 'lifestyle', 'now', 'sadly', 'gone', 'forever']",The Grateful Dead: The End of the Road - The Final Tour '95

This documentary concerns itself with the Deadheads only, and then only the most road damaged tour rats at that. Little of the band, in fact none of the band or its music is shown or played, instead you are treated to a walk through the wilderness of Shakedown Street, ie the vendor, hard core tour parasite, parking lot scene and it is not pretty. Call it an adventure in extreme hippiedom if you will, if rambling, loaded halfwits could be considered hippies. This is the dark side of the counterculture, the self serving and drug addled side. The living in the park with no money side. Most of these folks interviewed seem to be there for the party and not the music.  This is not complete story of the Grateful Dead fans and the scene, rather it is a depressing view of the dregs of the worst tour of the Dead's worst year: 1995. We see the deterioration of the scene, the gate crashing at Deer Creek, the righteous indignation of some older deadheads and a lot of chaos. The movie ends on the very sad note of Jerry's memorial at Golden Gate Park where Bill, Mickey, Bobby and Phil give short eulogies for their fallen comrade coupled with some more interviews with fans. Many of these interviews are quite moving, and articulate, for example Merl Saunders' interview is touching and the interview with a young man whose face is obscured by his hat and monstrous beard is a thoughtful reflection on some of the best of the Deadhead culture. Other interviews touch on the sense of loss at Jerry's death and the changed nature of the Grateful Dead fan base. I suppose this section was for me the highlight. Or low light cause its really a bummer.One could enjoy this movie as a biased view in cultural anthropology of a unique sub-culture. Just don't expect to get more than 10 percent of the whole picture because this movie only shows you a small slice of the pie during the worst year in the band's long long history. This was not my experience of the Grateful Dead. This movie is all about the surface and not the substance and never explains what made the Grateful Dead a compelling band to its fans. Then again this movie isn't about the band but the most stereotypical of its followers.",2,"The good, the bad and the ugly",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,2288,"['Unfortunately', 'very', 'little', 'good', 'whole', 'lot', 'bad', 'freaking', 'raft', 'ugly', 'documentary', 'concerns', 'Deadheads', 'only', 'then', 'only', 'most', 'road', 'damaged', 'tour', 'rats', 'Little', 'band', 'fact', 'none', 'band', 'music', 'shown', 'played', 'instead', 'are', 'treated', 'walk', 'wilderness', 'Shakedown', 'Street', 'vendor', 'hard', 'core', 'tour', 'parasite', 'parking', 'lot', 'scene', 'not', 'pretty', 'Call', 'adventure', 'extreme', 'hippiedom', 'will', 'rambling', 'loaded', 'halfwits', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'hippies', 'dark', 'side', 'counterculture', 'self', 'serving', 'drug', 'addled', 'side', 'living', 'park', 'money', 'side', 'Most', 'folks', 'interviewed', 'seem', 'be', 'there', 'party', 'not', 'music', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'fans', 'scene', 'rather', 'depressing', 'view', 'dregs', 'worst', 'tour', 'Dead', 'worst', 'year', '1995', 'see', 'deterioration', 'scene', 'gate', 'crashing', 'Deer', 'Creek', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'older', 'deadheads', 'lot', 'chaos', 'movie', 'very', 'sad', 'note', 'Jerry', 'memorial', 'Golden', 'Gate', 'Park', 'where', 'Bill', 'Mickey', 'Bobby', 'Phil', 'give', 'short', 'eulogies', 'fallen', 'comrade', 'coupled', 'more', 'interviews', 'fans', 'Many', 'interviews', 'are', 'quite', 'moving', 'articulate', 'example', 'Merl', 'Saunders', 'interview', 'touching', 'interview', 'young', 'man', 'face', 'obscured', 'hat', 'monstrous', 'beard', 'thoughtful', 'reflection', 'best', 'Deadhead', 'culture', 'Other', 'interviews', 'touch', 'sense', 'loss', 'Jerry', 'death', 'changed', 'nature', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'fan', 'base', 'suppose', 'section', 'was', 'highlight', 'low', 'light', 'cause', 'really', 'bummer.One', 'could', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'biased', 'view', 'cultural', 'anthropology', 'unique', 'sub-culture', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'more', '10', 'percent', 'whole', 'picture', 'movie', 'only', 'small', 'slice', 'pie', 'worst', 'year', 'band', 'long', 'long', 'history', 'was', 'not', 'experience', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'movie', 'surface', 'not', 'substance', 'never', 'what', 'made', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'compelling', 'band', 'fans', 'Then', 'again', 'movie', ""n't"", 'band', 'most', 'stereotypical', 'followers']",The Grateful Dead: The End of the Road - The Final Tour '95

905379,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B0009GX2K0,stoic,"[2, 2]","End of the Road is an odd documentary that starts with an account of The Grateful Dead's final tour in summer 1995. Then the filmmakers abruptly shift tack. The film ends with a 20-minute segment on Jerry Garcia's death and the ceremonies that were held in his honor afterward.I liked the first part of the film. The filmmakers had no access to concert footage or to the Dead's songs. So, they focused on the Deadheads who followed the band around the country. The filmmaking is amateurish, but the `heads entertained me by explaining why they felt connected to the band and what it is like to live in on the road.Several reviewers have complained that the film focuses ""hardcore"" hippies and not typical `heads. I think that is a fair criticism. Most of the interviewees are ""way out."" I think, however, that hardcore hippies have some great stories to tell.Unfortunately, the film unravels with Jerry's death. The last 20 minutes are slow and uninteresting. We get the usual platitudes about Jerry, but little insight.End of the Road is mildly entertaining, but I don't recommend it.",2,A Mishmash,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,1085,"['End', 'Road', 'odd', 'documentary', 'account', 'Grateful', 'Dead', 'final', 'tour', 'summer', '1995', 'Then', 'filmmakers', 'abruptly', 'shift', 'tack', 'film', '20-minute', 'segment', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'death', 'ceremonies', 'were', 'held', 'honor', 'afterward.I', 'liked', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'access', 'concert', 'footage', 'Dead', 'songs', 'So', 'focused', 'Deadheads', 'who', 'followed', 'band', 'country', 'filmmaking', 'amateurish', 'heads', 'entertained', 'explaining', 'why', 'felt', 'connected', 'band', 'what', 'live', 'road.Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'hardcore', 'hippies', 'not', 'typical', 'heads', 'think', 'fair', 'criticism', 'Most', 'interviewees', 'are', 'way', 'out', 'think', 'however', 'hardcore', 'hippies', 'have', 'great', 'stories', 'tell.Unfortunately', 'film', 'unravels', 'Jerry', 'death', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'get', 'usual', 'platitudes', 'Jerry', 'little', 'insight.End', 'Road', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend']",The Grateful Dead: The End of the Road - The Final Tour '95
