A little goes a long way and he was totally one dimensional but when handled  right - aka Frank Capra - he was very funny. The Strong Man is one of the funniest silent conedies ever made and showcases his talents. His scene with moll Gertrude Astor is hilarious. Tramp Tramp Tramp is also good- Joan Crawford helps - but a plateau lower than the first film. Long pants is the of the unfunniest films ever made and Langdon's fingerprints are all over it showing why his career collapsed so quickly. It is unwatchable and his character is so underwhelming that it is impossible to feel anything but contempt for him.

561314,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B00004Z4W3,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[0, 0]","Harry Langdon is known today mostly by hardcore slapstick comedy and silent film fans. He was/is indeed an acquired taste that will either repel or amuse. I saw him with Al Jolson in the sound musical ""Hallelujah I'm a Bum"" as a Communist trash collector (yes, its as strange as it sounds) and found him intriguing and amusing, so I thought I'd see him at he's peak.Harry only occasionally makes me bust a gut guffawing and he was often more interesting than funny. His shtick was as a Stan Laurelesque baby faced child man, befuddled by the world around him, whose talens were his amusing, confused reactions to what took place around him.THE STRONG MAN  late 1926) is quite charming and funny. Harry is a Belgian soldier in WW1 who tries to track down his pen-pal sweetheart ""Mary Brown"" in America, not realizing how common that name is in this country. Some funny comedy of errors stuff which switches gear as the story segues into a tale of bootleggers who try to corrupt a small town. The vaudeville show and finale is one of the classics of film comedy and even if you don't roll on the floor in laughter, you enjoy the creativity that went into this film. Worth repeated viewing.TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP (earlier in 1926) has is moments as Harry goes on a cross country footrace to win money to save his impoverished father (while falling in love with a young and unrecognizable Joan Crawford in the process). This tale is quite funny in spots, including the Harold Lloyd-type cliffhanger, the chain gang segment, and the famous cyclone scene that presages Buster Keaton's STEAMBOAT BILL 2 years later. Unfortuantely, a VERY weak ending and deep holes in the story take some luster off of this one, but its still worth seeing.LONG PANTS (1927) is often reviled for the infamous attempted murder scene. Personally, this struck me as more absurdist than offensive, since its clear from the beginning that Harry's character is too soft and unlikely to pull this off. More Snidley Whiplash than Charles Manson here. However, I found the film as a whole quite interesting and comical in parts. Essentially, this is where Harry's mom overprotects him and refuses to let him wear long pants, even though he is (chronologically) an adult. Therefore, Harry gets his fantasies of romance from bad, cheap novels at the library. Finally, the pappy gets Harry some Long Pants and he tries to woo a vampirish dope dealer instead of the nice girl next door. The gist is that Harry is so detached from reality that he tries to kill the nice girl so that he could run off with the vamp. The notorously controversial attempted murder scene (to me) is too ridiculous to take seriously, more like something out of a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. This is followed by some amusing and clever bits involving a policemen mannequin that Harry mistakes for the real thing, and an attempt to get the vamp out of prison. This film is not as bad as some make it out to be, and I found it amusing and clever after repeated viewings.While these films are admittedly not for all tastes, give them a chance and Harry might possibly appeal to you.",4,"Often more interesting than funny, but still worthwhile",1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,3108,"['Harry', 'Langdon', 'known', 'today', 'mostly', 'hardcore', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'silent', 'film', 'fans', 'was/is', 'indeed', 'acquired', 'taste', 'will', 'either', 'repel', 'amuse', 'saw', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'sound', 'musical', 'Hallelujah', ""'m"", 'Bum', 'Communist', 'trash', 'collector', 'yes', 'as', 'strange', 'found', 'intriguing', 'amusing', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'peak.Harry', 'only', 'occasionally', 'bust', 'gut', 'guffawing', 'was', 'often', 'more', 'interesting', 'funny', 'shtick', 'was', 'Stan', 'Laurelesque', 'baby', 'faced', 'child', 'man', 'befuddled', 'world', 'talens', 'were', 'amusing', 'confused', 'reactions', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'him.THE', 'STRONG', 'MAN', 'late', '1926', 'quite', 'charming', 'funny', 'Harry', 'Belgian', 'soldier', 'WW1', 'who', 'track', 'down', 'pen-pal', 'sweetheart', 'Mary', 'Brown', 'America', 'not', 'realizing', 'how', 'common', 'name', 'country', 'funny', 'comedy', 'errors', 'stuff', 'gear', 'story', 'tale', 'bootleggers', 'who', 'try', 'corrupt', 'small', 'town', 'vaudeville', 'show', 'finale', 'one', 'classics', 'film', 'comedy', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'roll', 'floor', 'laughter', 'enjoy', 'creativity', 'went', 'film', 'Worth', 'repeated', 'viewing.TRAMP', 'TRAMP', 'TRAMP', 'earlier', '1926', 'moments', 'Harry', 'cross', 'country', 'footrace', 'win', 'money', 'save', 'impoverished', 'father', 'falling', 'love', 'young', 'unrecognizable', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'process', 'tale', 'quite', 'funny', 'spots', 'including', 'Harold', 'Lloyd-type', 'cliffhanger', 'chain', 'gang', 'segment', 'famous', 'cyclone', 'scene', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'STEAMBOAT', 'BILL', '2', 'years', 'later', 'Unfortuantely', 'VERY', 'weak', 'ending', 'deep', 'holes', 'story', 'take', 'luster', 'one', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing.LONG', 'PANTS', '1927', 'often', 'reviled', 'infamous', 'attempted', 'murder', 'scene', 'Personally', 'struck', 'more', 'absurdist', 'offensive', 'clear', 'beginning', 'Harry', 'character', 'too', 'soft', 'unlikely', 'pull', 'off', 'More', 'Snidley', 'Whiplash', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'here', 'However', 'found', 'film', 'whole', 'quite', 'interesting', 'comical', 'parts', 'Essentially', 'where', 'Harry', 'mom', 'let', 'wear', 'long', 'pants', 'even', 'chronologically', 'adult', 'Therefore', 'Harry', 'fantasies', 'romance', 'bad', 'cheap', 'novels', 'library', 'Finally', 'pappy', 'Harry', 'Long', 'Pants', 'woo', 'vampirish', 'dope', 'dealer', 'instead', 'nice', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'gist', 'Harry', 'so', 'detached', 'reality', 'kill', 'nice', 'girl', 'so', 'could', 'run', 'off', 'vamp', 'notorously', 'controversial', 'attempted', 'murder', 'scene', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'take', 'seriously', 'more', 'something', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote', 'cartoon', 'followed', 'amusing', 'clever', 'bits', 'involving', 'policemen', 'mannequin', 'Harry', 'mistakes', 'real', 'thing', 'attempt', 'get', 'vamp', 'prison', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'make', 'be', 'found', 'amusing', 'clever', 'repeated', 'films', 'are', 'admittedly', 'not', 'tastes', 'give', 'chance', 'Harry', 'might', 'possibly', 'appeal']","Harry Langdon… The Forgotten Clown: (The Strong Man / Tramp, Tramp, Tramp / Long Pants)"
561315,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00004Z4W3,Anyechka,"[11, 12]","It's important to remember that not only is Harry Langdon an acquired taste for some people, but that the modern-day assessment of the greatest silent clowns is something people make in hindsight.  For example, Harry was never considered one of the great silent clowns (except, probably, during his all too brief heyday) the same way Buster Keaton, now considered one of the big three, never was ranked that high either back then (he wasn't recognised as one of the greats until the 1950s).  In the Teens and early Twenties, a number of now-forgotten comedians were routinely #2 on the lists of the best comedians, some (such as Roscoe Arbuckle and Larry Semon) even beating out Chaplin as the #1 clown in some areas.  If it hadn't been for the unfortunate scandal in 1921, it's almost certain that Arbuckle would still be considered one of the top silent clowns.  And so after various events like that occurred, not just the scandal but other silent clowns who are generally largely forgotten today diminishing in popularity, critics came up with other names to make up a new list.  Harry Langdon was just one of those names.During Harry's own brief original heyday, he was considered the fourth great silent clown, but it appears as though he was always a distant fourth, not someone held in as high or consistent regard as a Lloyd or Chaplin.  He was already a veteran of vaudeville when he transitioned to film in 1923, and this move from stage to screen led to a meteoric rise and some quite good shorts and features, many of them directed by the better-remembered legend Frank Capra.  The two of them had a falling-out during the making of the disastrous 'Long Pants,' with Harry siding with the writer and not the director of this film, and due to this the picture lost money.  After this he fired Capra and began directing all of his own movies from then on out, which basically sealed his fate; most of his movies from then on out (the majority of the films he starred in were actually sound pictures) were financial disasters, driving people away as quickly as they had flocked to see this shining original new comedic star.The three films on this disc are a mixed bag.  'The Strong Man' is easily the best of the three-fold sample, and even only having seen these three, it can easily be apparent to the first-time viewer just why it is considered to be Langdon's best feature film.  Harry plays hapless Belgian soldier Paul Bergot, who is captured during WWI and brought back to America with the other soldier, as part of his circus act.  Paul however is more interested in tracking down his American penpal Mary, who happens to be the daughter of the local preacher in one of the towns they end up having to perform in, a town rife with corruption and out of control seedy elements.  There are a lot of good creative gags and scenes in this film, getting better and stronger as it goes along.  The second film, 'Tramp, Tramp, Tramp,' is also pretty good and entertaining, but not quite as fine as the first film.  This one is about the son of a poor shoemaker, determined to raise enough money to save his wheelchair-bound father from bankruptcy, who ends up in a cross-country walk that will easily earn him enough money, if he's the winner, to save the day.  The daughter of the man whose company is sponsoring this walk (Joan Crawford in a very early role) also happens to be the girl Harry is smitten with.  The final film, 'Long Pants,' is just bizarre, some good moments but overall really painful and unfunny to watch.  I agree with people who have noticed how creepy it is to see fortysomething Harry wearing a short pair of pants, up in the attic, eavesdropping on his parents arguing over whether he should get a chance to wear long pants.  His mother is convinced wearing short pants has kept him out of trouble, and although this probably wasn't intentional, the way all of this is portrayed and played out, one can get the impression that Harry is ""special,"" and this impression gets even stronger as the film wears on.  He seems more than just childlike and sheltered, he seems more infantile and moronic.  And the business of him trying to shoot his would-be bride in the woods is more disturbing than funny.  I didn't get a single laugh out of this film, and can see why he fell from grace so quickly when this film was released.  He was only great when he was being handled by the right people; when he was directing himself he no longer had anyone around for quality control and ego checking.I wanted to like Harry, and I liked 'The Strong Man' enough to want to see some of his earlier two-reelers, where perhaps he seems more funny and likeable, but I just didn't personally connect with his character enough to root for him and sympathise with him.  I wouldn't say I found him irritating and annoying as others have done, just more like clueless, passive, and infantile, not the sweet endearing kind of stupidity and childlikeness other comedians who played similar characters (such as Stan Laurel and Curly Howard) displayed.  And he did co-write some of Laurel and Hardy's best feature films, so it's not like he totally lost a sense of funnyness in his later years.  I guess I'm just one of those people who feels Langdon is an acquired taste as opposed to instantly becoming a fan.",4,Why Harry was forgotten,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,5319,"['important',

Having recently purchased a Laurel and Hardy DVD, Amazon made the recommendation of this disc, and I decided to give it a try.The Strong Man (1926) Directed by Frank Capra has Harry as a Paul, clueless Belgian solider who gets captured and carried away by an enemy soldier.  After the war is over, we see the two of them arrive in America, and the soldier that captured Harry is none other than The Great Zandow, a strong man by profession.  Seems The Great Zandow has made Harry his personal assistant.  Was this common practice back in the day?  Making captured prisoners indentured servants?  No matter...Harry is more concerned with finding a romantic pen pal who sent him uplifting letters during the war.  This leads a particularly funny sequence involving a case of mistaken identity, a gangster's moll, and a wad of illicit cash.  Later we see Zandow and Co. (Paul) travel to Cloverdale, a small, wholesome town that has suffered an invasion of hooligans.  Seems they have taken over the main city building and turning it into a beer and dance hall, much to the dismay of the more pious members of the community.  Well, The Great Zandow has been booked to perform in the hall, and on their arrival, Paul finds his female pen pal, but their meeting is cut short as the strongman gets drunk and Paul is forced to perform in his place, with disastrous results.  This one, in my opinion, is the funniest of the three presented here, and also the best looking in clarity and definition.The next feature, Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926) has Harry as the son of a shoemaker and we find that they are having difficultly paying their rent and will be thrown out in the street in three months unless they come up with the money.  Harry decides to go out and find a way to come up with the money, and stumbles into a major shoe manufacturers' promotional cross country walking race that will net the winner $25,000.  Also, Harry becomes smitten with the president of the major shoe company's daughter, played by Joan Crawford.  The race starts, and this leads to a number of comedic sequences, one involving a fence and a cliff, another involving stolen fruit and a prison chain gang, and so on.  As the race comes to an end, watch for the cyclone scene, a truly inspired bit.  The picture quality on this feature is not as good as the first, as there are some more noticeable flaws, but overall it's quite good, considering the age of the material.The third and last feature on this disc, Long Pants (1927), directed by Frank Capra, is kind of an odd, sometimes creepy feature with spots of comedy.  This one seems to put people off, and it's understandable.  This one has Harry living with his parents, and shows him in short pants (knee length).  He's taken an interest in women romantically, but, being that he's still in short pants, the women consider him still a boy.  For Harry's birthday, his father wants to give him a pair of long pants, but his mother objects as she thinks it will be some sort of corrupting influence on their son.  In the end, she relents, and Harry gets his long pants.  I have to say, it seemed really creepy seeing a 40ish man in short pants.  Anyway, it seems Harry is betrothed to a local girl, but becomes smitten with another woman, one who is in trouble with the law for smuggling 'snow', among other things.  She ends up getting jailed, much to Harry's dismay.  On the day of Harry's wedding, he concocts a scheme to get out of the wedding, and here's where it really gets creepy.  His scheme involves taking his fianc&eacute; out into the woods and shooting her dead.  He attempts this, but comic mishaps ensue.  The bear trap gag was truly a great bit.  In the end, he's not successful, and basically ditches his family to goes to rescue this other woman.  She manages to escape, hides in a crate, and Harry tries to get her out of town.  I thought this whole sequence was quite funny, and made up somewhat for the earlier creepiness.  Everything works out in the end.  I read another review on this feature, and I think it hit the nail on the head in that the reviewer stated that some of the situations played out in this feature are out of Langdon's character, as we want to like him, but a fantasy about killing his fiance' doesn't really make for a likeable character.  This feature has the worst picture quality of the three, especially at the beginning, when the picture seems very bleached and washed out.  The quality does improve marginally throughout the movie, but never matches the clarity of the other two.  Again, given the age of the material, all three are actually in pretty good shape.There are no extra features, but there are chapter stops for each film, and the total run time is around three hours (one hour for each film), so I feel I received a really good value, and was enlightened to a lesser-known comedic talent of a bygone period.  Laurel and Hardy will always be my favorite, but there is always room for more.Cookieman108",4,Classic silent slapstick films,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,5097,"[""'m"", 'not', 'especially', 'big',

The prints are really clean (though it seems they've been sepia-toned?, they may very well have been that way originally. I haven't seen them like that), and the scoring is decent. Nothing fantastic, but it certainly doesn't distract from the film.The Strong Man is a very good outing from Langdon as an actor. One of his best. Hi pantomime is second to none, and the gags are just plain hilarious.Tramp, Tramp, Tramp is another of his better features. The visuals (gags and otherwise) are brilliant. It's extremely well shot, but not to the point where you forget you're watching a comedy.Long Pants, in my opinion is Langdon's best work. Both as an actor, and director. Some of the directing choices made show Langdon knew how to shoot Langdon. While some of his efforts by others seem to move the film too fast to get the full effect of his deadpan, Harry chose to hold shots until you really 'got it'. That shouldn't be taken as the movie dragging; quite the contrary. The movie zips by, and I found myself having to rewind in a few places because I missed scenes from laughing so hard at the previous ones. The sequence where Harry is trying to murder his wife, as far as I'm concerned is one of the greatest comedic bits ever filmed.Basically, it's a great collection at a great price.

Like most of Langdon's features starting with ""His First Flame"", this film needs re-editing, and the story is full of holes. Nevertheless, it is a funny movie with a lot of pure, idiosyncratic ""Langdon"" in it (which you'll either love or hate).  The cyclone is hilariously ridiculous, and awesomely filmed.  It's worth the price of the DVD just to see this scene.LONG PANTS:This is one weird film.  I, like so many others, felt repulsed at the turn of events where Harry sets out to KILL his fianc&eacute;(!!!), but then all is redeemed when that scene turns out to be the funniest sequence in the movie.  The controversy will never end over whether or not Langdon should have included this scene; just forget about it and be amused.THE STRONG MAN:Great film, and Harry proves himself not only quirky, but clever, which is how I like my picturesque comedians to be characterized.  If there ever was ANY reason to believe that Capra was the man behind the genius, this film is it.PRODUCT QUALITY--PICTURE AND SOUND:If these movies were printed specially (recently) from film-negatives, it doesn't look it.  From negatives, you could certainly improve the consistency of the lighting by toning down the over exposures, and even work with the contrast, but... no.  The film with the best quality is ""The Strong Man"", which looks very good.  ""Tramp..."" is not as good but pretty good, and ""Long Pants"" is quite bad most of the way through, although still watchable (this may be the best print available).THE MUSIC makes or breaks a non-talking film.  This is my particular interest and probably the only real reason to read this review:  All three movies have excellent composer-performers.  Unfortunately, as so often happens with Kino DVDs, the sound is not always in sync with the picture. ""Tramp..."" fares the worst: For a while the sound is about a second late, then it's early, then there's a few seconds of blank soundtrack, then it's in sync, then it's late.  Carli's piano playing is homogeneous enough that it still makes for quite decent background music, but ALL of his little nuances that fit Harry jumping up, Harry doing a double-take, Betty's picture unfolding off the wall, Harry's eyes popping open, and countless other sweet musical emphases are utterly lost to the viewer.  I know they exist because some are obvious, and upon playing with the sound for my own edification, I found multitudes of these little synchronies which would, if they matched the film, make the movie an absolute joy to watch.  I would think that these composers would be tearing out their hair to see their work so stupidly used, and would put it in future contracts that they get to oversee the sync-up of their music to the film.The music for ""The Strong Man"" is synthesized (there is no ""Palace Music Hall Orchestra""), but it's not as bad as you'd expect.  I do wish that the composer had a BETTER synthesizer (some such devices can sound very realistic), but even being a little annoying at times, he does a fine job of providing good solid background music that suits the tempo of the scene he's playing for.I do recommend this purchase because these prints are probably as good as you'll be getting on DVD for a long time to come, maybe forever.  The music is good, even when it's out of sync.  But because of Kino's quality-non-assurance and because ""Tramp..."" is a lesser film, I'm rating the product at 3 stars out of 5.

561320,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00004Z4W3,Mr Peter G George,"[19, 20]","Harry Langdon is generally considered to be the fourth great silent comedian. Considering that the other three are Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, this assessment is high praise indeed. The three films on this DVD show Langdon at his best and are the reason why briefly, during 1926-27, he was very popular indeed. After this his decline into obscurity was swift, not least because he chose to leave one of the people most responsible for nurturing and developing his talent, a person by the name of Frank Capra. It is already apparent that Capra was a talented director, for the two films he directed The Strong Man and Long Pants are much better than the one he only co-wrote Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.Langdon is something of an acquired taste. His comic persona of a bewildered childlike man is such that he is rarely the agent of the events that happen to him. He is rather the passive recipient and the humour lies in his reaction to the circumstances which unfold around him. This reaction is often absurdly slow with Langdon reacting to something after it has already happened. He is thus a completely different sort of comic to, for example, Keaton whose behaviour is active, quick witted and in control. But this difference makes Langdon all the more of a pleasure to watch for he is a true original. Much of what makes Langdon so funny is the contrast between his style of comedy and that of Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd. His difference from them is one of the reasons why he was once so popular.This DVD is really great value lasting more than three hours and including the three best feature films of an important comedian. The colour-tinted prints of all three films are in good condition. There is some occasional damage and sometimes, especially on Long Pants, the print has become rather bleached and over-exposed, but for the most part these films have survived in a near mint condition. Each film is well scored with music which fits the action, adding to the atmosphere and aiding the comedy.

The master prints may have some wear but they are still in decent shape.My only disappointment is that the original Laserdisc set included three 20-30 minute shorts from Harry's Mack Sennett films.  Fortunately two of these missing shorts have been issued on DVD as part of the SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA DVD set.So defenately BUY THIS collection and buy the SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA DVD set to get the best of Harry Langdon.I just wish more of the early Langdon - Mack Sennett comedies would find their way to DVD.  Sadly, just after making these three features Harry made the biggest mistake of his life and fired his director Frank Capra.  Harry let his popularity go to his head and thought he knew better than his director.  Harry just did not understand what made his comedy funny and over stretched the pathos when he tried to direct his own films.  By 1929 Harry Langdon would be bandrupt because of his bad decision.  Sound would ad further problems for Harry's film career as this diminished his mute boyish persona.But enjoy Harry at his best with these three features.",5,This great presentation leaves you wanting more.,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,1297,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'Kino', 're-issued', '1997', 'Laserdisc', 'collection', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'Forgotten', 'Clown', 'DVD', 'more', 'fans', 'discover', 'Harry', 'enjoy', 'best', 'three', 'films', 'film', 'transfers', 'are', 'great', 'sharp', 'clear', 'master', 'prints', 'may', 'have', 'wear', 'are', 'still', 'decent', 'shape.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'original', 'Laserdisc', 'set', 'included', 'three', '20-30', 'minute', 'shorts', 'Harry', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'films', 'Fortunately', 'two', 'missing', 'shorts', 'have', 'been', 'issued', 'DVD', 'part', 'SLAPSTICK', 'ENCYCLOPEDIA', 'DVD', 'set.So', 'defenately', 'BUY', 'THIS', 'collection', 'buy', 'SLAPSTICK', 'ENCYCLOPEDIA', 'DVD', 'set', 'get', 'best', 'Harry', 'Langdon.I', 'just', 'wish', 'more', 'early', 'Langdon', 'Mack', 'Sennett', 'comedies', 'would', 'find', 'way', 'DVD', 'Sadly', 'just', 'making', 'three', 'features', 'Harry', 'made', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'life', 'fired', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'Harry', 'let', 'popularity', 'go', 'head', 'thought', 'knew', 'better', 'director', 'Harry', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'what', 'made', 'comedy', 'funny', 'stretched', 'pathos', 'when', 'tried', 'direct', 'own', 'films', '1929', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'would', 'be', 'bandrupt', 'bad', 'decision', 'Sound', 'would', 'ad', 'further', 'problems', 'Harry', 'film', 'career', 'diminished', 'mute', 'boyish', 'persona.But', 'enjoy', 'Harry', 'best', 'three', 'features']","Harry Langdon… The Forgotten Clown: (The Strong Man / Tramp, Tramp, Tramp / Long Pants)"
561322,A22BL7L1Y40VPE,B00004Z4W3,Robert Morris,"[2, 2]","This collection contains three solid feature length films from Harry Langdon, who is often listed with the ""big three"" (Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd) as the greatest of the silent comedy stars. These films are surely among the best of Langdon's output. Fans of director Frank Capra will also enjoy these early writing and directing efforts, and connections can be made between the Harry Langdon persona of these films and some of Capra's later cast of innocent, idealistic heroes (John Doe, Mr. Smith, Harry Bailey). Also interesting to note is how the 4 comedians seemed to take material from one another and develop it in their own way. Some of the gags in these films invite comparisons with past and future gags of the other comedians; for example, the war scenes in ""The Strong Man"" resemble Chaplin's ""Shoulder Arms"", while the vaudeville scenes resemble ""The Circus"".Harry Langdon's character, in both appearance and behavior, resembles that of a child. The obstacles he faces are those of a child in an adult world: confronting physical and emotional abuse by adult bullies of both genders, trying to make sense of and control inner feelings, especially feelings of attraction to women, and surviving in a world without having developed a strong sense of right and wrong. This amorality is aptly illustrated in a scene from ""Long Pants"". Harry wishes to dump his bride-to-be on their wedding day so that he can flee to his true love, a cocaine dealer, who is in prison. He concocts a plan whereby he takes his bride to the woods (in full wedding apparel) and, during a game of hide-and-seek, tries to shoot her in the back with a shotgun! The concept, of course, is not funny (although his ineptitude at executing the plan has funny moments) but it's somewhat typical of watching a Langdon movie -- his character's antics often invoke a response that is laughter combined with disbelief in his lack of a sense of morality.This is an extreme example, and most of the themes are of a more innocent sort. Indeed, there is a sweetness in the tone of much of the films, especially Tramp Tramp Tramp, which mostly involves a coast to coast walking race that Harry has entered in order to save his father's business.  One laughter technique that Langdon uses often is to evoke a prolonged sequence of conflicting emotional responses to a situation that he can't fully grasp. In Tramp Tramp Tramp, for example, there is a scene in which he is staring at a picture of a woman on a billboard whom he has fallen for. Suddenly, by chance, the woman (Joan Crawford) appears in front of him. His confused response, alternating various states of joy and confusion, is quite funny, and becomes more funny as the response is prolonged. Sometimes, however, this technique falls flat, as in a scene in the same movie involving a taxi cab driver.In general, I recommend this DVD to Capra fans or Langdon fans, or those wishing to extend their appreciation of silent screen comedy.",4,Mature Langdon + Early Capra = Good stuff,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2965,"['collection', 'three', 'solid', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'who', 'often', 'listed', 'big', 'three', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'Lloyd', 'greatest', 'silent', 'comedy', 'stars', 'films', 'are', 'surely', 'best', 'Langdon', 'output', 'Fans', 'director', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'early', 'writing', 'directing', 'efforts', 'connections', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'persona', 'films', 'Capra', 'later', 'cast', 'innocent', 'idealistic', 'heroes', 'John', 'Doe', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Harry', 'Bailey', 'Also', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', '4', 'comedians', 'seemed', 'take', 'material', 'one', 'develop', 'own', 'way', 'gags', 'films', 'invite', 'comparisons', 'past', 'future', 'gags', 'other', 'comedians', 'example', 'war', 'scenes', 'Strong', 'Man', 'resemble', 'Chaplin', 'Shoulder', 'Arms', 'vaudeville', 'resemble', 'Circus', '.Harry', 'Langdon', 'character', 'appearance', 'behavior', 'child', 'obstacles', 'are', 'child', 'adult', 'world', 'confronting', 'physical', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'adult', 'bullies', 'genders', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'control', 'inner', 'feelings', 'especially', 'feelings', 'attraction', 'women', 'surviving', 'world', 'having', 'developed', 'strong', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'amorality', 'aptly', 'illustrated', 'scene', 'Long', 'Pants', 'Harry', 'dump', 'bride-to-be', 'wedding', 'day', 'can', 'flee', 'true', 'love', 'cocaine', 'dealer', 'who', 'prison', 'plan', 'whereby', 'bride', 'woods', 'full', 'wedding', 'apparel', 'game', 'hide-and-seek', 'tries', 'shoot', 'back', 'shotgun', 'concept', 'course', 'not', 'funny', 'ineptitude', 'executing', 'plan', 'funny', 'moments', 'somewhat', 'typical', 'watching', 'Langdon', 'movie', 'character', 'antics', 'often', 'invoke', 'response', 'laughter', 'combined', 'disbelief', 'lack', 'sense', 'morality.This', 'extreme', 'example', 'most', 'themes', 'are', 'more', 'innocent', 'sort', 'Indeed', 'sweetness', 'tone', 'much', 'films', 'especially', 'Tramp', 'Tramp', 'Tramp', 'mostly', 'coast', 'coast', 'walking', 'race', 'Harry', 'entered', 'order', 'save', 'father', 'business', 'One', 'laughter', 'technique', 'Langdon', 'often', 'evoke', 'prolonged', 'sequence', 'conflicting', 'emotional', 'responses', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'grasp', 'Tramp', 'Tramp', 'Tramp', 'example', 'scene', 'staring', 'picture', 'woman', 'billboard', 'whom', 'fallen', 'Suddenly', 'chance', 'woman', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'front', 'confused', 'response', 'alternating', 'various', 'states', 'joy', 'confusion', 'quite', 'funny', 'more', 'funny', 'response', 'prolonged', 'Sometimes', 'however', 'technique', 'flat', 'scene', 'same', 'movie', 'involving', 'taxi', 'cab', 'driver.In', 'general', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Capra', 'fans', 'Langdon', 'fans', 'wishing', 'extend', 'appreciation', 'silent', 'screen', 'comedy']","Harry Langdon… The Forgotten Clown: (The Strong Man / Tramp, Tramp, Tramp / Long Pants)"

It includes three of his best silents in excellent prints with great soundtracks.The Strong Man is perhaps the best Harry Langdon film to watch to see the genius of the comedian. Many trademark jokes are included in the film including his climbing the stairs bit. Also, we get to see the best of his humor, some of the more wholesome jokes (as opposed to finding comedy in attempted murder like in Long Pants).This is the story of a meek and mild Frenchman (Langdon) who travels to America as part of a strong man act with a man who captured him in the war. He decides to go on a quest to meet the woman who wrote to him in the war and professed her love for him, Mary Brown (Priscilla Bonner). This leads to some very funny run-ins, especially that with a jazz baby with ties to gangsters. Eventually, he is led to a town divided into the hooligans who run things with their bootlegged liquor and loose women and the straight-laced Christians who have faith that the sin will stop eventually. Langdon finds Mary in the town, the daughter of a preacher. The climax of the film happens when Langdon's partner gets too drunk to perform, forcing Langdon to go on in his place. Lets just say he brings the house down.If you don't find yourself laughing out loud constantly, just remind yourself that Langdon was much slower with his delivery than some of the other comics of the era. Some do not believe in his talent, but others feel quite strongly about it. It seems to be most evident here in one of his most universally popular films.Another wonderful aspect of this film is the music score. It is peppered with familiar tunes of the era and contributes a whole other dimension of humor to the film.Tramp, Tramp, Tramp is a sweet film that has not been previously released on VHS. It is an exciting film because of the presence of Joan Crawford in an early role. She plays the mascot of a shoe company which is having a race cross country to advertise. Some of the best atheletes are planning to run. Somehow, a lovestruck fan of Crawford's enters and experiences a series of hilarious mishaps including one particularly amusing scene with a fence. This film is short and sweet, a great way to put a smile on your face.Long Pants is certainly not the film you want to see to fall in love with Langdon. However, it is a sweet movie on its own merits. The story concerns a young man (Langdon) whose family has kept him in short pants for his whole life. They believe it will keep him innocent and out of trouble. It seems they were right; when he gets long pants he falls in love with a troublesome but beautiful girl (Alma Bennett). Although he is engaged to another (Priscilla Bonner) (who he is willing to do anything to get rid of), he follows the beauty everywhere including to jail and out again in a crate.There are some classic gags utilized, some belly laughs to be had, but also a rather disturbing scene of comedy rooted in murder. This is one silent comedy you might want to ban your children from.",4,Horray!

561324,A2D63RN5LF14R2,B00004Z4W3,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[4, 4]","*Long Pants is the film in which that annoying breed known as ""slapstick lovers"" start their crusade against the ""weird"" Harry Langdon. Long Pants  is also the film that the collaboration between Langdon and Frank Capra came to a crashing halt, due to aesthetic differences which involved the development of Langdon's character. Langdon and writer Arthur Ripley wanted to take the character into darker territory. Capra vehemently objected and was fired by Langdon, with Langdon anonymously finishing up directorial duties.Slapstick, as an art form, dates badly and frequently induces more groans than laughs today. Chaplin`s more ambitious efforts, with (balanced) pathos and dramatic story, telling are of far more interest than his earlier straight-up slapstick efforts for Sennett. Keaton`s inventiveness and occasional forays into surrealism hold up as his best work and can, up to a point, prove fuel for those arguing for his superiority. Seen today, Langdon was right in his endeavor to make his on-screen characterization darker, more idiosyncratic, more unique, even if naive critics whine that Langdon simply ""ceased to be funny"" and just ""got weird."" It is Langdon's weirdness that set him apart from the beginning and, while I would probably not, overall, place him in the ranks of a Chaplin or Keaton, I would argue that Langdon etched an influential persona that secures his position as one of the great silent clowns and defies the ""forgotten"" label often attached to him.Contemporary audiences, unable to relate to 1927 mores and customs, will certainly find the initial premise of Long Pants unintentionally bizarre in itself. Harry's father (Alan Roscoe) feels it is time for his boy to grow up and buys him his first pair of long pants, initiating Harry into manhood. Harry's mother (Gladys Brockwell) is very weepy eyed over the prospect, feeling her little Harry is far too young for long pants and wearing them will only bring trouble. She is correct, as Harry is, psychologically, still a boy. Once Harry loses his short pants (and stockings--an amusingly `creepy' image) and then dons his long pants, he spies a beautiful, exotic woman in a broken down car outside. Mother's predicted ""big trouble"" begins its course.Actually, this is a bad boy habit already formed in Harry, even before his initiation into long pants status, which mama must have sensed. In the opening scene, Harry is lustfully looking at girls from his attic window.Harry jumps on his bicycle to get a closer look at this woman in the car, who is in fact the wanted criminal Bebe Blair (Alma Bennett). Bebe is temporarily stranded due to a flat tire. Her chauffeur is fixing the problem when Harry arrives. Unknown to Harry, Bebe is smuggling nose powder for her criminal boyfriend. Harry wheels around Bebe's car, showing off his newly acquired long pants along with his considerable bike riding skills. Bebe is equally annoyed and amused by this man-child stranger. She gives Harry a kiss in an effort to get rid of him, but, of course, Bebe's wet lips have the opposite effect on poor Harry. Bebe vamps him and he is now convinced that he must marry Bebe.Harry's mother and father have different plans. They want Harry to marry Priscilla (Priscilla Bonner, who starred with Langdon in Capra's popular Strong Man from the previous year). Indeed, Priscilla is the type of gal to bring home to mama; the only problem is, compared to Bebe, Priscilla seems to be a bit dull. Priscilla and Harry's parents are insistent on the wedding taking place despite Harry's new-found infatuation for Bebe. When Harry finds out that his ""true love"" Bebe has been caught and imprisoned, Harry decides the only thing left to do is kill Priscilla. Here, Langdon foreshadows dark hued man-child types such as Steve Martin (when he counted) and Pee Wee Herman (Stan Laurel, often compared to Langdon, was simply a neutered version). Watching little Harry fantasize about murdering his bride in the woods on their wedding day can be as disconcerting as amorous little boy Pee Wee looking up girls' skirts with a mirror tied to his shoe.It is the contrasted imagery and characterization that is disturbing and hilarious. Harry's screen persona went further into the dark side with the 1928 film, The Chaser, directed by Langdon (in that film, Harry's man-child could be seen attempting suicide in drag).Of course, nothing turns out as Harry hopes, but all still ends happily ever after for the Boy. Despite the happy conclusion, Long Pants ranks as one of the most authentically strange comedies of early cinema. In less than a year, Langdon would go several steps further, lose the up-beat ending, and propel his character into a total loser, Charlie Brown-type territory. Consequently, he would lose his too-easily shocked audience as well. Langdon was certainly ahead of his time and lost everything in his battle for individuality. However, the passage of time indicates little Harry won his standout war after all. He remains unique.*Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926), directed by Harry Edwards, was slapstick comedian Harry Langdon`s first feature for First National. The star was at the height of his meteoric rise and, unknown to him, was a mere year away from his sudden fall. Tramp, Tramp, Tramp is probably the least of Langdon's silent features, but its merits are considerable.A dastardly Snidely Whiplash-type landlord has given Harry's wheelchair bound pappy three months to come up with the rent: "" Son, I hadn't told you--we don't own this place--we'll be put out soon.""""Does that mean I don't get my new bicycle?""Harry can't keep his mind off Betty, the Burton Shoes billboard girl (Joan Crawford). ""Stop dreaming of that girl. The money must be raised in three months--it's up to you.""""I'll get the money in three months if it takes me a year.""Oh, but wait, which way to go? Primrose Street or the Easiest Way? Which way indeed? Hmmm. Harry ponders, makes a step, steps back, ponders some more. It's the type of scene that will inspire love of Langdon or pure hate. I opt for the former. As for the Landon haters, unenlightened to the Tao of Langdon--they serve as proof that uninformed opinions simply do not count.Harry gets and loses a job working for a celebrity cross-country walker. Lo and behold, Burton Shoes is currently sponsoring a cross-country race. If Harry met Betty becomes when Harry met Betty. Hmmm. Billboard girl picture of girl looks like girl on bench. Oh my, let me look see under your hat, Betty. Oh my. Oh my. Same girl. Oh my.Langdon was, and remains, an acquired taste. The subtextual idea of a Pee Wee Herman/Stan Laurel hybrid lusting after the future Mommie Dearest is the equivalent of nails meet chalkboard for suburbanites, soccer moms, and Curly Howard fans: reason enough for kudos.Harry enters the race, hoping for the $25,000 grand prize, and putting Ma's wedding ring on Betty's finger. His trusty scissors come in handy: Harry's hotel room is plastered with cutouts of billboard Betty. Harry sleeps with a billboard Betty, much to the chagrin of his competitor, his former boss.Naturally, there's trouble along the way, including a few days hard labor for poaching blueberries.While influences of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton abound in some of the set-piece vignettes, most importantly Langdon perfects his set-apart persona. Langdon's wide-eyed innocence, sleepy smile, and surreal pathos probably had a longer lasting latent influence than most of the silent clowns. Stan Laurel, Jacques Tati, Steve Martin, Andy Kaufman, and Paul Ruebens are among those indebted to Langdon's screen persona.*For 1920s audiences, The Strong Man (1926) showed the quintessential appeal of Harry Langdon`s idiosyncratic child-man persona. It is easy to see why. Langdon was radically different than the hyperkinetic antics associated with high profile silent clowns such as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd. Today, he is considered the ""Forgotten Clown."" This is partially because Langdon died prior to 1950&#8242;s revival of interest in silent comedians. Another reason is his later ventures into blacker arenas: Long Pants (1927) and Three's a Crowd (1927) which made (and still make) audiences uncomfortable. Still, Langdon's risky choices were defensible. With sound around the corner, his stardom would most certainly have been short-lived anyway.Frank Capra, in his directorial debut, invests his signature stylized charm onto Strong Man. It begins with cannon fire. Paul (Langdon) is a soldier on the WWI war front. Needless to say, he is an atypical soldier. He can't even knock over a tin can with a machine gun. But, put a slingshot in his hand and he can make the big guy cry (yes, David and Goliath references abound). He gets letters from his penpal, Mary Brown (Priscilla Bonner), who swears love to her long distance Belgian soldier.After the war, Paul is employed by the German Strong Man, Zandow the Great (Arthur Thalasso). As they enter several American cities, Paul looks for the elusive ""Mary Brown."" He thinks he has found her in a gold digging pickpocket (Gertrude Astory). This ""Mary Brown"" is actually ""Lily of Broadway."" When she tries to retrieve a stolen wad of cash, stashed in Paul's jacket pocket, it foreshadows several Stan Laurel scenes to come in which a child-man resists being undressed by an aggressive female.When Paul finds the real Mary Brown, he discovers she is a blind, saintly preacher's daughter in a modern day Dodge City. Paul is no Errol Flynn version of Wyatt Earp. Instead, he dons the Strong Man persona and entertains the rowdy crowd.Meanwhile, Mary's pappy is playing the part of Joshua and soon, the walls of Jericho come a tumbling down, the movie ending just as it began: in cannon fire.  The Strong Man is an episodic film with a second half loaded with saccharine. The real climax of the film is in the interaction between Paul and Lily.Capra clearly preferred the Langdon persona to be innocent. Langdon's child man was the only one of the major silent clowns who actually sported face powder. That, combined with chipmunk cheeks, sleepy eyes emerging from the face of a pear, ill-fitting clothes, and a toddler's gait supported Capra's vision of the character. It was putting that character in an awkward, pre-code erotic situation, however, that gave impetus to the film. In this vignette, director and actor work together beautifully. An endless, staircase, imagined rape, and a shocking eyeful of a nude model sends Paul exit, stage left.After this, the film often succumbs to a children's book version of Biblical storytelling. Still, we do see the Capra touch in its genesis. Likewise, we witness the flowering of Langdon's big risk. Buster Keaton took a similar risk with a film; not quite as edgy, but his loss was almost as dramatic, resulting in his contract being sold to MGM. MGM, seeing the ""failure"" of The General (1926), denied Keaton future creative control.Of course, time declared Keaton the victor. Langdon also, seems to have exerted considerable influence, especially for someone still tagged with that underground, ""forgotten"" moniker.* MY REVIEWS WERE ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED AT 366 WEIRD
