I found myself enjoying the story of his character's son and the people he is there to inadvertently help. This is a traditional western in the vein of land rights and crooked con men trying to steal the homestead. Pleasingly, this is one the entire family can enjoy. Those who consider this sort of story 'cheesy' are better off watching the latest $300 million dollar CGI blockbuster.I knock a point off for the deceptive box, Kevin Sorbo is acceptable as the patriarch of the family, but the star billing of he and Meredith Baxter (in a five minute walk-on at the start) was badly handled. Whomever was the media marketing genius for the cover should be fired and find another line of work. They were just as shifty as the villainous crime boss!

1668746,AIH35QDMJEJK0,B00EU8RBXW,J Book,"[6, 6]","I've liked most of Sorbo's flicks.  I never cared for him and his Hercules series...not my style..  But his family oriented western movies are really something to be proud of.  There is good measures of realism.  There is constraint on how much blood is needed to make a scene authentic.  The acting is a good 85 to 95 on a 100 scale.  And there is no reason to shield any of the family from what shows on the screen.  Sorbo's movies are praise-worthy in that gore and sex are NOT the main points of interest.  This movie shows wholesomeness, justice, family values for that period and a great world view that reflects honor.Sorbo was doing a lot of sitting around in this flick.. something wrong with his leg.I kinda hated to see that... but the young stud they used as the action hero figure did a very good, if not quietly subdued job.  He, wisely, didn't have a lot of lines...but his stare into the bad guys could drill holes into granite!  He might be a bit similar to Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns in a very younger time, sans cigar.A man of few words, a hard stare and a dead-aim.I am continually amazed at how good and exciting and entertaining a movie can be when you don't have to &#34;stimulated&#34; by T&A;, all the F-words that most folks don't use and know that there are consequences to bad actions.This is an enjoyable, relaxed, movie with a realistic, and good world-view.",4,It's nice to see a hero play second fiddle.....,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,1397,"[""'ve"", 'liked', 'most', 'Sorbo', 'flicks', 'never', 'cared', 'Hercules', 'series', 'not', 'style..', 'family', 'oriented', 'western', 'movies', 'are', 'really', 'something', 'be', 'proud', 'good', 'measures', 'realism', 'constraint', 'how', 'much', 'blood', 'needed', 'make', 'scene', 'authentic', 'acting', 'good', '85', '95', '100', 'scale', 'reason', 'shield', 'family', 'what', 'screen', 'Sorbo', 'movies', 'are', 'praise-worthy', 'gore', 'sex', 'are', 'NOT', 'main', 'points', 'interest', 'movie', 'wholesomeness', 'justice', 'family', 'values', 'period', 'great', 'world', 'view', 'honor.Sorbo', 'was', 'doing', 'lot', 'sitting', 'around', 'flick..', 'something', 'wrong', 'leg.I', 'kinda', 'hated', 'see', 'young', 'stud', 'used', 'action', 'hero', 'figure', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'quietly', 'subdued', 'job', 'wisely', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'lines', 'stare', 'bad', 'guys', 'could', 'drill', 'holes', 'granite', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'similar', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'spaghetti', 'very', 'younger', 'time', 'sans', 'cigar.A', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'hard', 'stare', 'dead-aim.I', 'am', 'continually', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'exciting', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '34', 'stimulated', '34', 'T', 'A', 'F-words', 'most', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'know', 'are', 'consequences', 'bad', 'actions.This', 'enjoyable', 'relaxed', 'movie', 'realistic', 'good', 'world-view']",Shadow on the Mesa

He seeks revenge, pursuing answers from his unmet, lost father, Ray(Sorbo).  Meantime, there's a range war going on between Sorbo's character and a greedy landowner.This is a slow developing Western with the hero saying very little, often staring without a blink.  They want an old fashioned hero who doesn't waste words but  speaks with his actions and gun.  Sorbo's pretty much stuck crutchbound most of the movie until the grand shoot-out at the end.There are several, typical gunplays here, usually, rider facing rider, lined up, and a shoot-out from the homestead at the finale.  The bad guys are bad, greedy and don't play fair.  They feature a few women, including Meredith Baxter(sans Birney) who has a short role at the start, and somewhat of a romance but not much.We watch a lot of Gaiam's DVD's. and, in general, enjoy their offerings.  This one's well-made with lots of outdoor western shots and good production values.  We like Kevin ""Hercules"" Sorbo.  They picture him on the cover with two six shooters, a publicity shot only.
