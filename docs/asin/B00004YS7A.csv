It was pushing boundaries at the time and my folks lamented having taken me along (but I wasn't all that young). Bob Hope is always somewhat of a dope (in a good way) and all the surrounding characters are fun. Jackie Gleason is his main foil.,4,Film aptly titled in a 1968 sort of way.,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",2013,308,"['Good', 'copy', 'DVD', 'saw', 'movie', 'kid', 'drive-in', 'was', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'time', 'folks', 'lamented', 'having', 'taken', 'was', ""n't"", 'young', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'always', 'somewhat', 'dope', 'good', 'way', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'main', 'foil']",How to Commit Marriage

However, it is only presented in a full screen version.  Probably the most notable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see the only film appearance I know of for the folk-rock group The Comfortable Chair.",5,FOR THE MUSIC!!!!!,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,341,"['Interesting', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'film', 'DVD', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'release', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Film', 'Collection', 'However', 'only', 'presented', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'Probably', 'most', 'notable', 'aspect', 'film', 'opportunity', 'see', 'only', 'film', 'appearance', 'know', 'folk-rock', 'group', 'Comfortable', 'Chair']",How to Commit Marriage

Having seen Jackie Gleason in Smokey and the Bandit II and III, it's not hard to see how he was involved in such an awful movie. But I was surprised to see Bob Hope making a fool of himself as well.About the only redeeming factor is seeing the decor, cars, etc. of the era. But you can get that in many much better 60's films. Pass on this one...unless you want to see the ""other"" side of Bob Hope.Additionally, the transfer is awful. It is a pan & scan, cutting off valuable information on both sides. It is comparable to something AMC might show...except without the commercials.",1,The Bob Everyone Forgets,1064275200,"09 23, 2003",2003,693,"['who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'bad', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'watch', 'movie', 'Utterly', 'unfunny', 'sometimes', 'distasteful', 'Having', 'seen', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Smokey', 'Bandit', 'II', 'III', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'involved', 'such', 'awful', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'making', 'fool', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'seeing', 'decor', 'cars', 'etc', 'era', 'can', 'get', 'many', 'much', 'better', '60', 'films', 'Pass', 'one', 'want', 'see', 'other', 'side', 'Bob', 'Hope.Additionally', 'transfer', 'awful', 'pan', 'scan', 'cutting', 'off', 'valuable', 'information', 'sides', 'comparable', 'something', 'AMC', 'might', 'show', 'commercials']",How to Commit Marriage
