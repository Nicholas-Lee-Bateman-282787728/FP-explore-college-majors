382574,A1S3C5OFU508P3,630362815X,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This is a historical recapitulation of the facts and legends that have been modified and combined to create what we now know as Santa Claus. There have been many names for the creature that embodies the holiday spirit. Some of them are Saint Nicolas (Nick), Kris Kringle, Father Christmas and Santa Claus.The legend began in Turkey with the life of a priest called Nicolas. He was a kindly man that worked hard to improve the lives of children and the unfortunate. One legend that I found interesting was based on a man that was too poor to provide a dowry for his daughter. At the time, that meant that she would almost certainly be sold into prostitution or slavery. Taking pity on her, Nicolas wrapped some gold in cloth and dropped it through a window. At the time, people commonly hung their socks on the fireplace overnight to dry and the gold happened to land in a sock. Hence was born the custom of hanging socks on the fireplace so that they will be filled by Santa.It was fascinating to follow the descriptions by historians and experts in folklore as they describe how the legend of Saint Nicolas was expanded and modified to conform to local legends. Most of the development of the legend was evolutionary, yet there were a few times when single events revolutionized how Santa was perceived. One of the most interesting was the origin of the phrase, ""Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.""",5,A great historical recapitulation of the legends that evolved into that of Santa Claus,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1402,"['historical', 'recapitulation', 'facts', 'have', 'been', 'modified', 'combined', 'create', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'names', 'creature', 'holiday', 'spirit', 'are', 'Saint', 'Nicolas', 'Nick', 'Kris', 'Kringle', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'Santa', 'Claus.The', 'legend', 'began', 'Turkey', 'life', 'priest', 'called', 'Nicolas', 'was', 'kindly', 'man', 'worked', 'hard', 'improve', 'lives', 'children', 'unfortunate', 'One', 'legend', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'based', 'man', 'was', 'too', 'poor', 'provide', 'dowry', 'daughter', 'time', 'meant', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'sold', 'prostitution', 'slavery', 'Taking', 'pity', 'Nicolas', 'wrapped', 'gold', 'cloth', 'dropped', 'window', 'time', 'people', 'commonly', 'hung', 'socks', 'fireplace', 'overnight', 'dry', 'gold', 'happened', 'land', 'sock', 'Hence', 'was', 'born', 'custom', 'hanging', 'socks', 'fireplace', 'will', 'be', 'filled', 'Santa.It', 'was', 'fascinating', 'follow', 'descriptions', 'historians', 'experts', 'folklore', 'describe', 'how', 'legend', 'Saint', 'Nicolas', 'was', 'expanded', 'modified', 'conform', 'local', 'legends', 'Most', 'development', 'legend', 'was', 'evolutionary', 'yet', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'single', 'events', 'revolutionized', 'how', 'Santa', 'was', 'perceived', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'was', 'origin', 'phrase', 'Yes', 'Virginia', 'Santa', 'Claus']",Biography - Santa Claus VHS

It showed him a little bit but things need to be explained to him in a different kind of way. This movie basically just kept saying &#34;Maybe Santa is real and maybe he's not.&#34; My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe. Everything needs to be proven too him) so this movie just wasn't for him.
