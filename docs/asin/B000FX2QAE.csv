Only showed half her breast in one and the others were shot in the dark and can barely make out anything.The shots that just showed her cleavage was much better.Anyways, the real gem in this movie was her red-haired girlfriend that looked almost as hot as Lynda Carter especially in the scene where they are eating mushrooms it was amazing to see what she was hiding under her top!",3,move along nothing to see,1397520000,"04 15, 2014",2014,556,"['only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'bare', 'became', 'famous.Movie', 'was', 'worse', 'expected', 'even', 'nude', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'Only', 'showed', 'half', 'breast', 'one', 'others', 'were', 'shot', 'dark', 'can', 'barely', 'make', 'out', 'anything.The', 'shots', 'just', 'showed', 'cleavage', 'was', 'much', 'better.Anyways', 'real', 'gem', 'movie', 'was', 'red-haired', 'girlfriend', 'looked', 'almost', 'as', 'hot', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'are', 'eating', 'mushrooms', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'hiding', 'top']",N/A
