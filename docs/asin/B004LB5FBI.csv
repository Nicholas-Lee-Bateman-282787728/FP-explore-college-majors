Anyone who may have read the book upon which this film is based will see the stories original plotlines including the stories most important thread about the Stevenson character, played by Richard Widmark, and how he finally overcomes self destructive memories. This dvd has apparently come from a film copy in which the scenes, depicting how Stevenson finally overcomes the ghosts of his past and comes to accept a brighter future, have been deleted. By removing these scenes the film really loses most of its best qualities.The Yul Brynner character was not in the original book but takes the place of two other people in the story.

1413045,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B004LB5FBI,Donald M. Bishop,"[13, 14]","This 1964 film about the Air Rescue Service has more drama (and melodrama) than aviation.  Richard Widmark, Yul Brynner, and George Chakiris crew an Air Force rescue bird out of Japan, and as the plot unfolds -- a rescue of Japanese sailors after the loss of their ship -- each man is dealing with issues from World War II and an earlier ARS assignment in Germany.The aircraft starring in the film are the HU-16 Albatross flying boat and the HH-19 Chickasaw helicopter, with a DC-3 as a supporting actor.  Actual footage of the birds are mixed with special effects.  Specialized equipment (JATO bottles, rafts), use of checklists, and crew coordination -- not thrilling in themselves -- convey the need for technical mastery in flying the dangerous air rescue missions.I remember that in Air Force ROTC summer training in 1966 we spent some time in the water learning how to get into an inflated rescue raft -- it's not as easy as it looks!

Making movies about Governmental Agencies, with the help of those directly involved.This usually helped finance such movies and guaranteed full cooperation of such authorities.Unfortunately, at the same time, movie crews had to submit to some of the requirements that these authorities demanded.So, all in all, as said, this is not a bad movie, just a bit biased.Yet, this said, who could pass on an occasion to watch Yul Brynner, Richard Widmark and George Chakiris in action?The DVD is plainly just filled with the movie itself. No extras here, just in case you were looking for some.The picture though is in Widescreen, pristine and clean (no restoring here, but exceptionally good quality). The sound is plain Dolby Digital Mono,although on my system I have it on two stereo channels and not just out in the Center channel. Quality of this is also exceptionally clear and well-rounded.By well-rounded, I mean full sound, not that kind of ""tinny"" Mono sound one is usually receiving out of purely Mono tracks in his speakers.If you like adventure movies, then this one is for you.

1413049,A2BT2ZZYMU6JBQ,B004LB5FBI,"Rebecca H. Augustine ""falcargenta""","[0, 0]","Years ago I saw this movie, which was actually 4 movies in one.  There is the central story about Americans in post-war Japan now rescuing the people they were fighting only a few years earlier; then there are 3 stories about the central characters on the rescue mission and the personal tragedies they previously endured and how they were still dealing with them.  Captain Gregg, played by George Chakiris, seemed to have the weakest role in the movie.  The book demonstrated better how a perfectionistic chopper pilot could be so devastated by a failed rescue mission and then just exist from day to day, numbly &#34;going through the motions.&#34; Chakiris' &#34;sensitive man&#34; would surely have been quickly drummed out of the service.  When I first saw this movie, I loved the segment with Yul Brynner the best.  He has a great line concerning religion in it -- which I won't reveal -- that doesn't appear in the book.  Again, the book did not portray his character as an American with a Japanese father and American mother, just a former band drummer in a jazz band -- really a 1950s beatnik originally from middle American who hadn't fit in anywhere -- until he became a medic in the Air Force.  How the medic &#34;lost&#34; his love was more believable in the book than in the movie.  Finally, Richard Widmark portrayed a colonel who was &#34;along for the ride&#34; on the mission.  His story was truest to the book, yet incomplete.  He had lost his wife in an internment camp in the Phillipines and was working through his hatred for the Japanese.  I hate to keep harping on how much better the book was, yet the movie did not -- perhaps could not -- show that he had a love interest, a young Japanese woman who was adapting quite well to post-war Japan, still retaining the traditions yet in touch with the modern western currents.  Evidently, the movie intended to show this rescue mission as a kind of catalyst for ultimately making the men what they became, which really isn't great psychology.  I appreciate that a 2-hour (or 100 minute) movie cannot be as in-depth as a novel can be, so I will refrain from further criticism concerning development of the three main characters.  Just one more comparison/contrast of a more minor character:  Suzy Parker portrayed Yul Brynner's &#34;current&#34; (for the late 1950s/ early 1960s) love interest.  She was shown more or less as a &#34;secretary&#34; type.  In the book, her character was actually an Air Force captain.  I really don't see why she couldn't have been shown as an officer.  In any event, I really will cease and desist now.",3,Good Post-War Movie (but the book was better!),1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2604,"['Years', 'ago', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', '4', 'movies', 'one', 'central', 'story', 'Americans', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'now', 'rescuing', 'people', 'were', 'fighting', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'then', 'are', '3', 'stories', 'central', 'characters', 'rescue', 'mission', 'personal', 'tragedies', 'previously', 'endured', 'how', 'were', 'still', 'dealing', 'Captain', 'Gregg', 'played', 'George', 'Chakiris', 'seemed', 'have', 'weakest', 'role', 'movie', 'book', 'demonstrated', 'better', 'how', 'perfectionistic', 'chopper', 'pilot', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'devastated', 'failed', 'rescue', 'mission', 'then', 'just', 'exist', 'day', 'day', 'numbly', '34', 'going', 'motions.', '34', 'Chakiris', '34', 'sensitive', 'man', '34', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'been', 'quickly', 'drummed', 'service', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'loved', 'segment', 'Yul', 'Brynner', 'best', 'great', 'line', 'concerning', 'religion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', ""n't"", 'appear', 'book', 'Again', 'book', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'character', 'American', 'Japanese', 'father', 'American', 'mother', 'just', 'former', 'band', 'drummer', 'jazz', 'band', 'really', '1950s', 'beatnik', 'originally', 'middle', 'American', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'fit', 'anywhere', 'became', 'medic', 'Air', 'Force', 'How', 'medic', '34', 'lost', '34', 'love', 'was', 'more', 'believable', 'book', 'movie', 'Finally', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'portrayed', 'colonel', 'who', 'was', '34', 'ride', '34', 'mission', 'story', 'was', 'truest', 'book', 'yet', 'incomplete', 'had', 'lost', 'wife', 'internment', 'camp', 'Phillipines', 'was', 'working', 'hatred', 'Japanese', 'hate', 'keep', 'harping', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'book', 'was', 'yet', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'perhaps', 'could', 'not', 'show', 'had', 'love', 'interest', 'young', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'adapting', 'quite', 'well', 'post-war', 'Japan', 'still', 'retaining', 'traditions', 'yet', 'touch', 'modern', 'western', 'currents', 'Evidently', 'movie', 'intended', 'show', 'rescue', 'mission', 'kind', 'catalyst', 'ultimately', 'making', 'men', 'what', 'became', 'really', ""n't"", 'great', 'psychology', 'appreciate', '2-hour', '100', 'minute', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'in-depth', 'novel', 'can', 'be', 'will', 'refrain', 'further', 'criticism', 'concerning', 'development', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Just', 'one', 'more', 'comparison/contrast', 'more', 'minor', 'character', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'portrayed', 'Yul', 'Brynner', '34', 'current', '34', 'late', '1950s/', 'early', '1960s', 'love', 'interest', 'was', 'shown', 'more', '34', 'secretary', '34', 'type', 'book', 'character', 'was', 'actually', 'Air', 'Force', 'captain', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'officer', 'event', 'really', 'will', 'cease', 'desist', 'now']",Flight From Ashiya

A co-production between Harold Hecht and Japan's Daiei Studios, its focused on the U.S. Air Force Rescue Team and three men who work together carrying out the missions.  The three played by Yul Brynner, Richard Widmark, and George Chakiris are sent to save Japanese survivors bobbing on flimsy ship debris in the middle of a storm ravaged sea and we, the viewers, must partake of flashback sequences explaining our heroes quirky qualities.  Chakiris must cope with his guilt at leaving survivors behind to face death, Widmark must overcome his hatred for the Japanese in causing the demise of his true love played by Shirley Knight, and Yul Brynner has to cope with his guilt of accidentally killing his love played by the hauntingly beautiful French actress Daniele Gaubert. Actress/model Suzy Parker is wasted in the role of Yul's new inamorata and is required to just stand around ,get kissed or get coffee.  All this as they strive to rescue the survivors at sea.  The production design is credited to Eugene Lourie, a film director in his own right and responsible for one of the best monster movies of the fifties 'THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS'-1953 and its relatives 'THE GIANT BEHEMOTH'-1958 and 'GORGO'- 1961 but you can see the beautiful miniatures are from the Daiei studios who gave Toho Productions a run for their money in their own giant monster forays.  You will also spot actor Tetsu Nakamura who played the crazy mad scientist in 'THE MANSTER'-1962 as a cold blooded Japanese commander who refuses medication to Knight. You'll also hear the immortal voice of actor Paul Frees over the end credits. Unfortunately, the soap opera interludes written by Elliot Arnold and Waldo Salt slow down the film causing the viewer to head scratch at what type of film their watching.  Anderson would go on to direct the excellent actioner 'OPERATION CROSSBOW' a few years later.  But the one key element of the film that stands out is the ethereal beauty and haunting presence of Daniele Gaubert who would perform five years later in Director Radley Metzger's 'CAMILLE 2000' and steal that film as well.  Her performance shatters the screen and makes you forget everything about 'FLIGHT FROM ASHIYA'.
