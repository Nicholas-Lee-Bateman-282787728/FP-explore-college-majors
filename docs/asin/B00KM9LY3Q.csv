I was right!  It's definitely not a movie you have to see in theaters.  Honestly, I'll enjoy it far more sitting on my couch rewatching it 100 times.  The acting is all top notch and the little Easter Egg with Doc Brown makes it THAT much more awesome!  Liam Neeson really is a brilliant actor.  He can go from tough &#34;good&#34; guy (Taken) to tough &#34;bad&#34; guy with the snap of a finger.  Add him with Charlize Theron's looks and Seth MacFarlane's humor and you can't get much better, IMO.I'm not going to delve into the story too much.  Basically after Albert (Seth MacFarlane) is dumped by his girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried), he attempts to win her back by challenging her new boyfriend, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) to a duel.  He quickly realizes his mistake but luckily meets Anna (Charlize Theron).  They become friends and she agrees to teach him how to be a gunfighter.As stated before it's REALLY funny and the added dialogue from both Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman make it hard not to laugh.  I will warn you, it is EXTREMELY filthy at certain parts, but those are pretty few and far between. (most come from Sarah Silverman).Final Verdict:  BUY IT!

1697318,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00KM9LY3Q,C. Sawin,"[6, 10]","MacFarlane's follow-up to &#34;Ted&#34; isn't nearly as good as his feature film debut. While the two films are very different, &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; fails to have any big laughs and is worth nothing more than a chuckle or two at best.The highlight of the film is the amount of cameos this western comedy is able to cram into its nearly two hour duration; Dennis Haskins from &#34;Saved by the Bell,&#34; Gilbert Gottfried, Bill Maher, Alex Borstein, Ryan Reynolds, Patrick Stewart, and even Jamie Foxx appear in small roles. There's even a nod to &#34;Back to the Future&#34; that is hands down the best part of the film.Albert's freak out sequence after the pot cookie is fairly entertaining and the mustache song is catchier than it has any right to be. The slavery shooting gallery is sure to be a talking point for the film, but aside from the cameos Neil Patrick Harris is the funniest member of the cast. His corny jokes followed by his ridiculous laugh are pretty funny at times and his love for his mustache just sends the Foy character completely into outrageous territory.The biggest mistake &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; makes is the same mistake &#34;Family Guy&#34; tends to make on a weekly basis; most of the jokes go on much longer than they should. &#34;Family Guy&#34; has made it a point to drag certain jokes out for several minutes, entire episodes, and sometimes even having jokes that are stretched out over several weeks and spanning a number of episodes. &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; takes the same approach, but it results in the setups to the jokes revealing way too much causing the execution and follow-up humor to be almost painful.Being R-rated and using gross out humor is one thing, but Seth MacFarlane skips putting that protective toilet seat cover down and decides to just spread urine and fecal matter all over his audience without remorse. &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; covers every bodily fluid including urine, feces, and semen and that doesn't even cover the amount of farts in the film.What's unfortunate is that the Edward and Albert characters are very easy to relate to. Edward is a different spin on the nice guy character and like all nice guys he finishes last by being the last guy in town to finally have sex. Meanwhile Albert can't seem to catch a break even though he's a good guy living in a town that kills its inhabitants with absolutely everything under the sun. Albert is screwed so he kind of just gives up on life until he meets the girl of his dreams.Speaking as someone who enjoys toilet humor, it's a sad day when you have to come into a theater with moist towelettes, determine if the toilet seat is in fact down, and exclaim that enough is enough. &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; spends more time trying to push the buttons of its audience rather than entertaining it. The comedy is amusing in small doses, but as a whole it's about three horseshoes away from being an atrocity to the comedy genre.",2,Beating farts out of a dead horse,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",2014,3040,"['MacFarlane', 'follow-up', '34', 'Ted', '34', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'different', '34', 'Million', 'Ways', 'Die', 'West', '34', 'fails', 'have', 'big', 'laughs', 'worth', 'nothing', 'more', 'chuckle', 'two', 'best.The', 'highlight', 'film', 'amount', 'cameos', 'western', 'comedy', 'able', 'cram', 'nearly', 'two', 'hour', 'duration', 'Dennis', 'Haskins', '34', 'Saved', 'Bell', '34', 'Gilbert', 'Gottfried', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'Alex', 'Borstein', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'even', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'appear', 'small', 'roles', 'even', 'nod', '34', 'Back', 'Future', '34', 'down', 'best', 'part', 'film.Albert', 'freak', 'sequence', 'pot', 'cookie', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'mustache', 'song', 'catchier', 'right', 'be', 'slavery', 'shooting', 'gallery', 'sure', 'be', 'talking', 'point', 'film', 'aside', 'cameos', 'Neil', 'Patrick', 'Harris', 'funniest', 'member', 'cast', 'corny', 'jokes', 'followed', 'ridiculous', 'laugh', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'times', 'love', 'mustache', 'just', 'Foy', 'character', 'completely', 'outrageous', 'territory.The', 'biggest', 'mistake', '34', 'Million', 'Ways', 'Die', 'West', '34', 'same', 'mistake', '34', 'Family', 'Guy', '34', 'tends', 'make', 'weekly', 'basis', 'most', 'jokes', 'go', 'much', 'longer', 'should', '34', 'Family', 'Guy', '34', 'made', 'point', 'drag', 'certain', 'jokes', 'out', 'several', 'minutes', 'entire', 'episodes', 'sometimes', 'even', 'having', 'jokes', 'are', 'stretched', 'out', 'several', 'weeks', 'spanning', 'number', 'episodes', '34', 'Million', 'Ways', 'Die', 'West', '34', 'same', 'approach', 'results', 'setups', 'jokes', 'revealing', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'causing', 'execution', 'follow-up', 'humor', 'be', 'almost', 'painful.Being', 'R-rated', 'using', 'gross', 'humor', 'one', 'thing', 'Seth', 'MacFarlane', 'skips', 'putting', 'protective', 'toilet', 'seat', 'cover', 'down', 'just', 'spread', 'urine', 'fecal', 'matter', 'audience', 'remorse', '34', 'Million', 'Ways', 'Die', 'West', '34', 'covers', 'bodily', 'fluid', 'including', 'urine', 'feces', 'semen', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'amount', 'farts', 'film.What', 'unfortunate', 'Edward', 'Albert', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'relate', 'Edward', 'different', 'spin', 'nice', 'guy', 'character', 'nice', 'guys', 'last', 'being', 'last', 'guy', 'town', 'finally', 'have', 'sex', 'Meanwhile', 'Albert', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'even', 'good', 'guy', 'living', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'sun', 'Albert', 'screwed', 'so', 'kind', 'just', 'up', 'life', 'girl', 'dreams.Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'toilet', 'humor', 'sad', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'come', 'theater', 'moist', 'towelettes', 'determine', 'toilet', 'seat', 'fact', 'exclaim', 'enough', 'enough', '34', 'Million', 'Ways', 'Die', 'West', '34', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'push', 'buttons', 'audience', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'amusing', 'small', 'doses', 'whole', 'three', 'horseshoes', 'away', 'being', 'atrocity', 'comedy', 'genre']",N/A

1697321,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00KM9LY3Q,D. S. Thurlow,"[1, 1]","""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" shovels jokes, sight gags, riffs on old Westerns, and crude humor as fast as it can, figuring everything will be funny to someone in the audience.  It's a good bet, and this Western comedy works, although the humor is all over the map, not PC, and sometimes pretty gross.  This reviewer saw the movie with an audience that laughed out loud at some of the jokes and sight gags, and groaned at some of the cruder humor.Seth MacFarlane stars as sheep farmer Albert Starks, a nice guy who hates the old West and who as the movie opens gets dumped by his girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) because he chickens out of a gun fight.  Louise takes up with the insufferable Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) who runs the local moustachery.  The lonely Albert runs into Anna (Charlize Theron), the runaway wife of mean gunfighter Clinch Leatherwood (Liam Neeson), who takes him under her wing and trains him to fight the inevitable duels, first against Foy and then against Clinch.The opening segments of the movie feature a lot of modern breakup humor, nicely done by Albert and his best friends Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) and Ruth (an hilarious Sarah Silverman as a prostitute).  The movie really picks up steam as it drops into a more traditional western storyline, complete with barn dances, gunfights, barroom brawls, Indians, chases on horseback, and a predictable but enjoyable romance.  There are a ton of cameos and the magnificent scenery is right out of a John Huston Western.

Bristol ""bibliophile""","[18, 24]","In ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" Seth MacFarlane (who also directed and produced the movie), stars as Albert, a milquetoast sheep farmer in 1882 who gets dumped by the town beauty (Amanda Seyfried) for a foppish guy who runs the town ""mustachery"" (Neil Patrick Harris).  Albert isn't very good at sheep farming, still lives with his grim perpetually rocking chair bound parents, and hasn't murdered anyone, which is unusual in that time and place.  His friend, Edward (Giovanni Ribisi) is equally passive, and his main problem is that he can't get his fianc&eacute;e (Sarah Silverman) to have premarital sex, as she's a devout Christian who believes in saving herself for marriage - though she has  a day job in a whorehouse.  Still, Albert is determined to win his former girlfriend back and winds up challenging her new boyfriend to a shooting duel.  When a mysterious beauty (Charlize Theron) rides into town and befriends Albert, he's surprised but quickly falls for her, as she starts coaching him.  Trouble is that she's married to the meanest sharpshooter in the West, only in one of those classic Hollywood rom-com moves, forgets to inform Albert of this, until it's too late.  With two guys out for blood, plus threats from all the other ways to accidentally die in the West, can he finally win the girl of his dreams, even if she's not originally what he expects?The plot is predictable, but the audience I saw it with (mostly over 55) pretty much all loved it and chuckled/giggled/howled throughout.

1697323,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00KM9LY3Q,FNDNreview,"[5, 9]","The talent of Seth MacFarlane is undeniable, and to call him anything less than a modern comedy marvel would be insulting.  His notable creations include the popular primetime animated comedy, Family Guy, along with the Family Guy spin-off, The Cleveland Show.  The success of Family Guy alone has propelled MacFarlane&#8217;s career, culminating in hosting duties of the Academy Awards, a feature film, Ted, and even a jazz album, titled Music is Better than Words.  Now, his latest creation, A Million Ways to Die in the West, has him challenging gun-fighters, raising sheep, and basically loathing anything and everything associated with the old west.Seth MacFarlane directs, writes (along with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild), and stars in A Million Ways to Die in the West as a cowardly sheep farmer, Albert Stark.  Upon first meeting Albert, it&#8217;s clear he has a way with words &#8211; talking himself out of a gunfight he&#8217;s obviously unable to win (since he&#8217;s never fired a gun in his life).  His girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried), also takes issue with Albert&#8217;s cowardly demeanor, and after a year and a half relationship, dumps him.  Emotionally distraught, he turns to his friends, Edward (Giovanni), and his promiscuous girlfriend, Ruth (Sarah Silverman), for comfort.At the same time, the infamous outlaw, Clinch Leatherwood (Charlize Theron), is up to no good &#8211; and instructs his heavily irritated and defiant wife, Anna (Charlize Theron), to wait for him in the small Arizona town that Albert can&#8217;t wait to leave.  After a bar brawl, Anna and Albert meet, and eventually run into Louise and her new boyfriend, Foy (Neil Patrick Harris) &#8211; at which point Albert challenges him to a gun duel.  Lucky for Albert, Anna is quite skilled with a gun and takes to teaching him, while surprisingly falling for him.  Unfortunately, Albert knows little about her past or the gigantic problem that will arise when her husband returns.In typical MacFarlane fashion, this film quickly sets a &#8220;gutter&#8221; tone, and does not shy away from vulgar language, sexual banter, or racist stereotypes.  A substantial amount of violence is noticeably present, too.  Like the movie title says, there&#8217;s a million ways to die in the west &#8211; and over the course of the two-hour flick, death is a rather frequent occurrence.  Death comes in the form of a giant ice block, a rambunctious bull, getting a picture taken, and the obvious use of gunplay.  Still, there&#8217;s nothing here that&#8217;s overly interesting or that stands out as a moment that definitively &#8220;makes&#8221; the film.Coming as no surprise, the cast is rightfully pleasing and entertaining.  Seth MacFarlane, who dominates the screen time, is not your typical leading actor, but he has endless dramatic potential should he choose to embrace it &#8211; and his most mesmerizing scenes come at the least suspecting moments.  In one particular scene, he&#8217;ll be attempting to outrun angry outlaws, and the next he&#8217;ll be in a drug induced haze full of music, animation &#8211; all randomly concluding with an unsuspecting (and hilarious) version of Abraham Lincoln giving a speech.  No, you really can&#8217;t dream up this kind of spontaneity and absurdity.The supporting cast, including Charlize Theron, Sarah Silverman, and especially Neil Patrick Harris, help mold this flick into a tolerable, yet rocky adventure.  Astonishingly, the chemistry between the characters is well received &#8211; including a barb-filled rivalry between MacFarlane and Neil Patrick Harris.  As you might suspect, Patrick Harris has just as much entertainment potential as MacFarlane and they compliment each other nicely, especially in the film&#8217;s musical number (taking place during a barn dance), which is best referred to as the &#8220;mustache&#8221; interaction.Unfortunately, for all the ingenious ideas that come from MacFarlane&#8217;s mind, you also have to swallow the tasteless misses, as well.  In this case, there is a multitude of jokes that simply fail to muster any sort of desired reaction (and after some jokes, you can hear crickets).  You could certainly say this film is one big joke about sheep farmers, which never completely resonates from the get-go.  Plus, there&#8217;s a barrage of Indian remarks that never feel appropriate, and then another scene where white people are shooting black figurines at a carnival. Obviously, MacFarlane thrives on being controversial with his imagination, but there are just certain moments within this film that simply cross the line far too much to ignore.Overall, A Million Ways to Die in the West is a completely clich&eacute;d comedy that pays homage to old western films, while at the same time, incorporating Seth MacFarlane&#8217;s unique sense of unfiltered humor and imagination.  Still, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to recommend a film of this nature, since it&#8217;s full of needless vulgarity, not to mention overly offensive displays of bigotry, and borderline embarrassing interpretations of the way people lived in the mid 19th century.  Regardless, for those wondering, there are plenty of clever jokes, meaning if you&#8217;re a fan of MacFarlane, you&#8217;ll want to waste little time in seeing this film.  For everyone else, though, be forewarned of this brand of shameful humor &#8211; as this wouldn&#8217;t be the first time, nor will it be the last, that someone sat down to watch a MacFarlane production and either walked out of it offended, or simply refused to see it through to its conclusion.GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",3,Exactly what you'd expect from a MacFarlane western...,1401580800,"06

As a comedy though it drags on way too long. And speaking of dragging on, the jokes that are funny drag on too long as well. While Seth MacFarlane is okay as the lead, he doesn't seem 100% comfortable on camera yet to be a leading man. Still, he sort of pulls off a Woody Allen in a Western kind of role. While the film is stronger when he is on screen with Charlize Theron.Everyone else kind of has one dimensional roles. Neil Patrick Harris is probably only in the film since he gets to dance in one scene. And when he isn't doing that is talking about his mustache. When he's not doing that.....he has a dragged out potty humor scene.While Sarah Silverman plays a whore ""sorry think that's what hookers were called back then lol"" who won't sleep with her b/f (Giivanni Ribisi) due to her religion and saving herself for marriage. Meanwhile she has sex with over 10 guys a day. That is funny but would be funnier if it didn't drag on through most movie. Spoiler: but when the film is half way over she of course out of nowhere agrees to have sex with him with no good reason given.So pretty much MacFarlane and Theron are the only ones who have character build-up. Since MacFarlane has to learn not to be a coward. And Theron learns there's a better man out their than the vicious outlaw she was with since she 9. Who is played by the badass Liam Nieson. Nieson is good as the villain but I guess you can say his character is one dimensional too. But when does a villain in a Western ever want to do more than drawer or kill innocents anyway ?In closing A Million Ways to Die in the West isn't awful like some have said but I found myself taking it more seriously as a Western than a Comedy at some points.

I should begin by saying if you liked MacFarlane's directorial debut via &#34;Ted&#34; then you'll love &#34;A Million Ways to Die in the West&#34; or as the kids are calling it &#34;AMWTDITW.&#34; This time you get to see Seth as well as here him and he's taken over as leading man, a pacifist sheep herder Albert but a leading man nonetheless. The rest of the cast is just as fun Amanda Seyfried is the ex-girlfriend Albert is trying to win back with the help of Charlize Theron as outlaw's wife Anna and her distracting wig. Neil Patrick Harris and Sarah Silverman are a hysterical supporting cast and Liam Neeson is flippin' perfect as the gunslinging antagonist  and Anna's husband. Some amazing celeb cameos include: Ryan Reynolds, Patrick Stewart,  Jamie Fox, Ewan McGregor, Gilbert Gottfried, Christopher Lloyd, Alex Borstein (a.k.a. Lois Griffin)... but some you'll miss if you blink or leave before the credits roll. Sadly Mila Kunis only appears in the dialogue.

I haven&#8217;t laughed this hard out loud for a long time and &#8220;A Million Ways To Die In The Old West&#8221; was literally one laugh, shock or surprise after another.This is definitely an adult orientated film do to the language, sexual references, &#8216;poopy&#8217; humor and lots of inferred innuendos that you really need to pay attention because you could miss some very funny stuff. Seth McFarlane does a wonderful job of staging and coordinating both the visual and verbal jokes throughout the film with a wonderful cast playing everything as real and as straight forward as they can. (The outtakes on this film must be amazing!)It&#8217;s the story of a sheep farmer (yes, there are tons of very funny sheep jokes, sight gags and references), who is Seth, who is dating a not-so-nice girl played by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Les Miserable) and then in the process of trying to propose to her, she dumps him.Enter an unhappy and unfulfilled wife of a villain who happens to be a very kind soul and wonderful sharp shooter herself, Charlize Theron (Monster, Prometheus) who learns who and what Seth&#8217;s character is all about. They have a nice genuine friendship that grows into something more by the end of the film and the resulting circumstances are so much fun to watch.Enter the husband of Charlize who is the territory&#8217;s most notorious and deadly killer played by Liam Neeson (Schindler&#8217;s List, Taken). Liam&#8217;s humor comes from the real evil nature he portrays as the villain. You really end up disliking who he is with some very funny scenes that he is put in.Then there is the always funny and quick-witted Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, The Smurfs) who plays the hysterical mustache twirling, cocky attitude wielding, mustache grooming shop owner who wrongfully swoons Amanda&#8217;s character over to his whims. Neil plays comedy so well that just his looks, gleam in his eye or a wildly crazy pratfall &#8211; because he was just given a super laxative - will figuratively keep you in stitches.Special note and bow to the wonderful performances of Sarah Silverman (There Something About Mary, Wreck-It Ralph) playing a prostitute who is always &#8216;working&#8217; and her &#8216;boyfriend&#8217; played by Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Ted) who is a softer, quieter Christian of man about to propose to her too. Now, the both agree not to have sex with each other until after they are married. (Boing!) They have too many funny scenes to describe, but they have some great chemistry on screen and there are always jokes within jokes with these two characters.With such an amazing score by Joel McNeely (American Dad, Flipper), some very surprising and funny cameos by Patrick Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lloyd and Gilbert Gottfried (all good friends with Seth because of Family Guy) along with some of the cleverest special effects built around some very funny sight gags, &#8220;A Million Ways To Die In The Old West&#8221; was a very funny movie for adults and older teens &#8211; definitely not a kids film.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 9]","Although I think Seth McFarlane quite talented, I am not a follower nor am I inclined to compare this apple to the orange named Ted.  I am far more a follower of Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron, and even Amanda Seyfried who make up the ensemble in this movie.We have seen many attempts at comedy westerns before and they can be hit or miss affairs.  Anyone remember Wild Wild West?  Me neither.  I loved Three Amigos though with its silly parody of The Magnificent Seven and  Tarantino's Django Unchained.This however is a worthy effort by MacFarlane who ably plays the main character Albert and is ably supported by Amanda Seyfried, and Neil Patrick Harris,  Giovanni Ribisi, and that great method actress Sarah Silverman who plays his prostitute girlfriend.  I think she has been preparing for this role all her life.My takeaway from this movie may be different than yours.  For me, cowboys represent the ultra masculine, and Albert a humble shepherd, is masculine but not manly, and shrinks from confrontation.  His girlfriend Louise, disappointed in how he shirks a fight, even though he successfully gets a nonviolent solution, this excites not her female regions, and she breaks up with him.Pretty soon, perhaps too soon, she starts dating a mustachioed lothario played by Neil Patrick Harris, whose comedic skills are effortlessly brilliant.Meanwhile, a beautiful stranger (Charlize Theron) with a dark past rides into town, and Albert's best friend dates a prostitute with whom sex is off the table, an interesting dichotomy which sets up some amusing scenes. Liam Neeson plays a mean gunslinger. The movie is quite funny in places, full of sight gags and running jokes.  Much of the humor is unsophisticated, by the  numbers scatological references for example but there are some really good bits, and some people in the audience were laughing throughout the movie.  I particularly loved a shamanic dream sequence which was visually imaginative and quite funny.  And one gunfight scene involving Neil Patrick Harris and a cowboy hat was quite amusing.Our beautiful stranger helps our hero find his manhood, and you might think as a woman she might also feel the same way about the lacking masculinity, but she has had too much manhood, and needs a break, a lifestyle change with a decent man, although she does have certain skills which help Albert to man up, so for Albert there is a metamorphosis but if you're like me you sense that her dark past will create complications, because there are a million ways to die in the west, and another one can ride into town at any minute.The audience liked this movie a lot and gave it a decent round of applause at the end.  I think most people will like the  movie.  What I liked best perhaps was Charlize Theron's performance, she simply has a great presence, and I loved the comment about Louise's eyes.What I liked about MacFarlane's performance was that he was true to the good nature of his character.  It must have been so tempting to go on a comedic rampage, and overstep the boundaries of the character, but he managed to rein it in and craft a relatable and likable underdog that we root for.  I probably won't run out to see the next  Seth MacFarlane movie but I may amble at a brisk pace.

1697336,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B00KM9LY3Q,M. Bullions,"[6, 8]","Seth MacFarlane, whose infamous &#8220;Family Guy&#8221; is an affair of jokes that sometimes hit a perfect note, but the jokes of which are really all over the place. His 2012 feature debut &#8220;Ted&#8221; shocked me because it was good - like an above-average really good comedy. While some directors and writers have an ability to top themselves every outing, I&#8217;m sorry to say MacFarlane is not one of those people.&#34;A Million Ways to Die In the West&#34; is an updated re-telling of &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; basically, which seems like a perfect fit for MacFarlane. I think the script simply needed another draft.MacFarlane plays Albert, recently dumped by his girlfriend (a tragically underused Amanda Seyfried) who goes on a quest with Anna (a good Charlize Theron,) a mysterious new woman in town who is full of secrets, but seems pretty cool generally, to win back his girlfriend and prove his own worth.MacFarlane, as an actor, does well enough here, but he shouldn&#8217;t attempt to do any more acting parts that are even vaguely more serious than this film. He doesn&#8217;t nail the serious moments, but the audience goes along with it for the most part. Theron is great in comedies, as evidenced in &#8220;Young Adult,&#8221; and she has lots of fun here.Supporting characters played by Giovanni Ribisi and Sarah Silverman are quite funny as well. Neil Patrick Harris and Liam Neeson round out the cast as the surprisingly not miscast villains. MacFarlane, as a director, made the wise choice to give the supporting people enough room to make their own characters, which is a good thing.However, the film itself isn&#8217;t quite the riot it should be. It&#8217;s sporadically very very funny, but some jokes are duds while others are home runs. If I had to speak generally, I would say more of the jokes work than not, but MacFarlane has an affinity for fart jokes, which get really old after awhile. &#8220;A Million Ways To Die In The West&#8221; has some golden moments in it - including a hilarious musical number and a grand hallucination scene.

1697338,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00KM9LY3Q,M. Oleson,"[8, 9]","Theatrical review.A film comedy should be evaluated mostly for how many times you laugh, or at least smile uncontrollably.  In this over-long feature film by Seth MacFarlane, I found the jokes sometimes hilarious and other times, death bombs.  In addition to directing, MacFarlane co-wrote the screenplay and stars as Albert, a rather meekly mannered sheep rancher.  Early in the film, Albert's girlfriend, Louise (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him for the more manly and mustachioed Foy (Neil Patrick Harris).  Anna (Charlize Theron) rides into town and strikes up a friendly relationship with Albert.  What Albert doesn't know is that Anna is in a bad marriage with the meanest hombre around, Clinch (Liam Neeson).Supporting the film are Sarah Silverman as Ruth, a prostitute who is engaged to Edward (Giovanni Ribisi), a virgin.  He's OK with Ruth's job (servicing 10-15 men per day) but wants to wait until they are married to do the nasty.  One of the better scenes, and not shown in the trailers, involves Albert's meeting with Cochise (Wes Studi) and his tribe.

1697340,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00KM9LY3Q,Paul Allaer,"[2, 3]","""A Million Ways To Die In the West"" (2014 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Albert, who hates it in the west but somehow ended up in a frontier place called Old Stump, Arizona (in 1882, as we are reminded at the beginning). Albert is a loveable loser-nerd, and as the movie opens we see his girlfriend Louise break up with him after he (again) wimped out of a gun fight. Not long thereafter, a beautiful woman Anna and her brother arrive in town. Anna strikes up a friendship with Albert, and decides to teach him how to shoot and train him for a gun duel with Foy, Louise's new boyfriend. To tell you much more might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the Seth MacFarlane show from start to finish, as he stars, co-wrote, produced and directed this movie. Second, the only thing anyone really cares about: how funny is the movie? The answer: it is very funny at times (""you shouldn't drink and horse"", ha!, the ""mustache"" song-and-dance; when Albert trips on drugs, etc.), yet misfires just as much. In that sense, this movie is wildly uneven, and frankly not nearly as consistently funny as ""Ted"" was. Third, keep an eye out for the multiple cameos throughout the movie, up to the very, very end! Fourth, this movie reminds me why Charlize Theron is such a great leading actress, as she oozes charm from start to finish (and outshines MacFarlane on the screen). Last but certainly not least, there is a fantastic musical score for the movie, very much in the classical western sense, composed by Joel McNeely, and I can't wait to check out the soundtrack.Bottom line: ""A Million Ways To Die In the West"" is not bad but certainly not great. Quite honestly, I can't understand how people can give this 5 stars (as in: this is a perfect movie!). The late matinee screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati today was poorly attended (I counted all of 5 people, including myself, in a HUGE theater), but you may wish to check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusions, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,"3.5 stars...

1697343,A2699XUDZ8RFNL,B00KM9LY3Q,Some dude...,"[0, 1]","There is too much misguided criticism of this movie. It is a comedy that is funny, from a mind that is outstanding with delivery. Seth McFarlane's humour is crude, and unconventional, but that's what makes it great. The key to comedy is surprise, and unlike most of the other comedies out there, it's hard to see his jokes coming. His humour is his own making, so there are not imitations. Most comedies are formulaic, and McFarlane hasn't followed a path that allows that. He's making it up as he goes, so it's almost always new.Family guy was his effort to take gags from popular media, and deliver them better. TED was his effort to take his well earned success, and make something original. This is his effort to freshen up western comedy.It doesn't matter whether or not you like his humour. This movie is original, and well done. Top shelf actors are just about all there is in the cast, and some of them are disposable characters. That only works, because the best in the industry recognize that McFarlane is head and shoulders better than the competition, in that he knows who to hire, and can handle the work alone. As a director, he's fun to work with, and that gets the best from his actors. The fact that the most famous actors there are will take any role he gives them is enough to convince all but the most blinded consumer that his work is worth noting.Most noteworthy of all, is that he is the only one willing to write a SAG movie. That's why Hollywood movies have gotten so cliche lately. All of the good writers refuse to work on SAG movies anymore. This movie deserves praise, simply by being original.
