The manufacturer appeared to have just taken an old copy of the film and slapped it on a DVD.  The colors were faded and the sound track was fuzzy--almost garbled.And to make matters worse, the film wasn't as good as I had remembered, but if it was a favorite, the poor quality of reproduction makes it worthless.",1,Rip Off!,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,409,"['Saw', 'movie', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'copy', 'give', 'watch.So', 'much', 'quality', 'manufacturer', 'appeared', 'have', 'just', 'taken', 'old', 'copy', 'film', 'slapped', 'DVD', 'colors', 'were', 'faded', 'sound', 'track', 'was', 'fuzzy', 'almost', 'garbled.And', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'had', 'remembered', 'was', 'favorite', 'poor', 'quality', 'reproduction', 'worthless']",N/A

This movie is about four Americans that are broke and tired of being poor Steve is the ring leader and gets the other three guys to tell there wives and girl friends that there going on a fishing trip. So they put the usually things in Steve's truck like sleep bags, fishing poles, nets, and tackle boxes. So Steve and his three friends head down the road until they come to and open field and stops. Along comes Clint who's a side winder who deals in anything from rifles, guns, knifes, machine guns and anything else you can use if you're going to drop in on someone. When Steve's three friends find out what kind of fire power there going to need they start to have second thoughts. Steve talks them out of leaving and so they sit and wait until the plane arrives. The plane that there waiting for is going to take them to Mexico where a man named Serrano lives who has millions of dollars in his safe with high walls and guards to watch the place. So Steve and friends hold up outside of the walls where Serrano hides waiting for the right moment to attack the place. One of Steve's friends has a white female poodle that they lower over the wall to attract the guard dogs in which it does. So the men go over the walls, sneak in the building, downstairs to where the safe is only to found out that the combination was changed. So Steve and another man go up stairs to get Serrano to bring him down to open the safe. Steve and his men get the money but while on there way out they get into s shootout not only with Serrano army but the Mexican Army also and end up in a Mexican Bull Ring with a real live bull.  As the men are on the run two of them get caught while Steve and another get away. The two that where caught ended up in one of Serrano cells. Along comes Olivia who has been in one of Serrano cells for along time. Meanwhile Steve and the man that's with him get caught up by a bunch of bandits. Along comes Marino who's a poor Mexican along with there people who track Steve down and take there money. Will Steve and the man survive these Bandits? What about the two men that is in Serrano custody? What happens to Olivia and does she ever get out of Serrano cuffs? Some thoughts of my own on this movie. I thoughts this was a good movie because it did have adventure, action and drama. I bought this movie because Lindsay Wagner was in it. I wasn't disappointed with here acting or how beautiful she is, I was disappointed that it took almost 30 minutes before we saw her. Her talents were wasted in this movie and someone that looks like she does she be the leading actress. On Lindsay Wagner I give her 10 weasel stars because I could watch her all day. The movie itself I give 7 weasel stars",3,Lindsay Wagner Got Ripped Off,1233446400,"02 1, 2009",2009,2928,"['picture', 'opened', 'theaters', 'country', 'May', '1981', 'starring', 'James', 'Brolin', 'Steve', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Marino', 'Beautiful', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'Olivia', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Serrano', 'Ernest', 'Borgine', 'Clint', 'movie', 'four', 'Americans', 'are', 'broke', 'tired', 'being', 'poor', 'Steve', 'ring', 'leader', 'other', 'three', 'guys', 'tell', 'wives', 'girl', 'friends', 'going', 'fishing', 'trip', 'put', 'usually', 'things', 'Steve', 'truck', 'sleep', 'bags', 'fishing', 'poles', 'nets', 'tackle', 'boxes', 'Steve', 'three', 'friends', 'head', 'road', 'come', 'open', 'field', 'stops', 'Clint', 'who', 'side', 'winder', 'who', 'anything', 'rifles', 'guns', 'knifes', 'machine', 'guns', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'use', ""'re"", 'going', 'drop', 'someone', 'When', 'Steve', 'three', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'kind', 'fire', 'power', 'there', 'going', 'need', 'start', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'Steve', 'leaving', 'so', 'sit', 'wait', 'plane', 'plane', 'waiting', 'going', 'take', 'Mexico', 'where', 'man', 'named', 'Serrano', 'lives', 'who', 'millions', 'dollars', 'safe', 'high', 'walls', 'guards', 'watch', 'place', 'Steve', 'friends', 'hold', 'up', 'walls', 'where', 'Serrano', 'waiting', 'right', 'moment', 'attack', 'place', 'One', 'Steve', 'friends', 'white', 'female', 'poodle', 'lower', 'wall', 'attract', 'guard', 'dogs', 'So', 'men', 'go', 'walls', 'sneak', 'building', 'downstairs', 'where', 'safe', 'only', 'found', 'out', 'combination', 'was', 'changed', 'Steve', 'man', 'go', 'up', 'stairs', 'get', 'Serrano', 'bring', 'down', 'open', 'safe', 'Steve', 'men', 'get', 'money', 'way', 'get', 's', 'not', 'only', 'Serrano', 'army', 'Mexican', 'Army', 'also', 'end', 'up', 'Mexican', 'Bull', 'Ring', 'real', 'live', 'bull', 'men', 'are', 'run', 'two', 'get', 'caught', 'Steve', 'get', 'away', 'two', 'where', 'caught', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'Serrano', 'cells', 'Olivia', 'who', 'been', 'one', 'Serrano', 'cells', 'along', 'time', 'Meanwhile', 'Steve', 'man', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'bunch', 'bandits', 'Marino', 'who', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'people', 'who', 'track', 'Steve', 'down', 'take', 'money', 'Will', 'Steve', 'man', 'survive', 'Bandits', 'What', 'two', 'men', 'Serrano', 'custody', 'What', 'Olivia', 'ever', 'get', 'Serrano', 'cuffs', 'thoughts', 'own', 'movie', 'thoughts', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'adventure', 'action', 'drama', 'bought', 'movie', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'here', 'acting', 'how', 'beautiful', 'was', 'disappointed', 'took', 'almost', '30', 'minutes', 'saw', 'talents', 'were', 'wasted', 'movie', 'someone', 'be', 'leading', 'actress', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'give', '10', 'weasel', 'stars', 'could', 'watch', 'day', 'movie', 'give', '7', 'weasel', 'stars']",N/A

Borgnine is amusing as usual in a bit part but Quinn and Coburn are wasted in their roles, and the weak tv-grade actors like Brolin and Davison match the script for ineptness; the whole thing looks and feels like a weak tv movie from the late '70s.The plot has endless holes, the direction is spotty, and this is just like the sort of thing you'd watch on late night tv for five minutes and then give up on. But, cinematic masochist that I can sometimes be, I stuck it out to the end and was rewarded with one of the lamest, most laughable and least plausible denouements imaginable. Or rather unimaginable. Ridiculous; they should have just made this a satire and ran.
