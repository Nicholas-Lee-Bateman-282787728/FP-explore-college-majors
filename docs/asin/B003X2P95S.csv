W.,"[17, 19]","This ""series"" is really just a collection of History Channel series episodes bundled together to create the impression that it is a comprehensive history series covering the empires of the ancient world. The set includes individual episodes come from HC's ""Engineering An Empire""(e.g., Greece, Age of Alexander, The Aztecs, etc.), HC's ""Rome: Rise and Fall of an Empire"", ""Ancients Behaving Badly"", and ""Barbarians"". If you are expecting a presentation of even a good historical survey of each of the major empires of the world, you will be disappointed.

Walker did a pretty good review of the basicmegaset, so I won't restate his points.Currently at under a dollar per episode/program for $29.95 I think itwould be very hard to beat the bargain this set is - especially consideringhow expensive the individual sets and bonus programs were originally.They vary considerably in quality, and I personally wouldn't buy a couple of theseries singley, but the best ones are worth more individually than thetotal cost of the Megaset alone.",4,The Best Value I've Ever Seen for History Channel Series,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",2011,499,"['think', 'Alexander', 'M.', 'Walker', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'review', 'basicmegaset', 'wo', ""n't"", 'restate', 'points.Currently', 'dollar', 'episode/program', '29.95', 'think', 'itwould', 'be', 'very', 'hard', 'beat', 'bargain', 'set', 'especially', 'consideringhow', 'expensive', 'individual', 'sets', 'bonus', 'programs', 'were', 'originally.They', 'vary', 'considerably', 'quality', 'personally', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'couple', 'theseries', 'singley', 'best', 'ones', 'are', 'more', 'individually', 'thetotal', 'cost', 'Megaset', 'alone']",N/A

However, for those who are not a big fan of the History Channel this is a good deal both in the form of price and amount of educational information contained within this collection. You are getting 14 disks with over 32 hours of documentary material at a cost of about $2.50 per disk, tough to beat that price. I had already purchased some of the individual series from the History Channel so I will probably give them away to those who can use them as an educational tool in a teaching environment.
