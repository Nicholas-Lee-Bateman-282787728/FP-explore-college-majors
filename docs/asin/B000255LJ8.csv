Not only do we get the full cast returning from season one, but there's John Byner as lovestruck Detective Donahue, and Donnely Rhodes as Chester's partner-in-crime, Dutch. Billy Tate finally gets a chance to shine. And Chuck and Bob's &quot;mindreading&quot; act has to be one of the most inspired bits of nonsense ever dreamed up by the writers in 4 years of...well, inspired nonsense.But...I don't want to give away too much. You just have to see for yourself the sidesplitting, often absurb moments...and the occasional heart-tugging ones. Robert Guillame picked up an Emmy. But my favorite actor, and character, is still Richard Mulligan's Burt Campbell.Confused? You won't be, after watching the 20-minute featurette, &quot;Creators Come Clean.&quot; Witness Soap creators Susan Harris, Tony Thomas, and the impossibly chatty Paul Witt wax nostalgic about casting the landmark sitcom. My only complaint about this welcome insight into the show is that NONE of the actors appear to offer comments. Still, you may recall that Season One had absolutely NO supplemental features, so it's still a welcome treat.Now...for the sake of Soap fans everywhere (and poor Burt Campbell...oops!

The slapstick scenes are impeccable, the comedy is brilliant and sharp, and the heartwrenching scenes are so well done! It's the story of two sisters and their respective families - Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell. In true soap opera form in this second season someone is convicted of murder wrongly, everyone seems to have an affair, several people have near nervous breakdowns, somebody gets kidnapped by aliens, impossible love rears its head several times, and somebody forgets who they are! This doesn't even BEGIN to cover all that happens!SOAP moved at lightning speed doing what most soap operas take years to develop. I watched it back in the days it was on, and I was afraid it would not hold up well. Guess what? It does! SOAP was funny because of the characters not topical discussions. Sure there are plenty of 70s touches - the costumes, the way the show looks, but it's still funny and moving. The ensemble was unbeatable!The DVD gives you 23 episodes spread out over 3 discs. You also get an unaried PILOT, and a featurette with the creators.  It was the FIRST show to have a content warning before it aired, the first show with an openly gay character (Billy Crystal as Jody Dallas), and it's soooooo irreverant and politcally incorrect! Black jokes, gay jokes, veteran jokes, talk about orgasms, talk about infidelity, talk about impotence, mental health issues, hookers, politicians -- I could go on and on with the tabboos this show broke! It seems a little less sensational here in 2004, but it's still something special. Too bad they didn't put more on the discs - COMMENTARY FOR SEASON 3 PLEASE!, but the show itself is well worth the price! Is the picture quality poor? Not too bad but you do see some flaws, but that may be because of the way networks taped shows back then. SOAP was never high on production values, just high on its own giddy satire!

824951,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B000255LJ8,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[2, 3]","Nominated for 17 Emmys in its short four-year run, Soap premiered in the Fall of 1977 as one of the most controversial shows in American television history (and all before a single episode ever aired). The show was opposed by many groups who thought its subject matter would be too mature for a prime-time audience. But Soap never overstepped its bounds, and the show became an instant smash hit with its brilliant and satirical spoofs of classic daytime programming. Sporting an all-star cast and talented producers, the show spawned successful spin-off Benson in 1979, a series that launched Robert Guillaume's career to a whole new level...Set in suburban Connecticut, Soap follows the lives of two sisters - Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond), a wealthy yet dim elitist, and Mary Campbell (Cathryn Damon), a housewife in a more traditional blue-collar atmosphere. But regardless of their social station in life, neither woman manages to escape the scandal and intrigue surrounding a typical soap opera family. Jessica's daughter Corrine (Diana Canova) is smitten with a priest, yet they are both having an affair with the same tennis pro. Meanwhile, Jessica and her husband Chester (Robert Mandan) incessantly cheat on one another. As for the other side of the family, Mary's husband Burt (Richard Mulligan) is certifiably insane, her son Danny (Ted Wass) is a mobster, stepson Jodie (Billy Crystal) is an out-of-the-closet homosexual, and all of them are caught up in a family filled with promiscuous infidelities and quite possibly murder! Throw in the insubordinate and sarcastic Tate butler Benson (Guillaume), and Soap holds its own as one of the funniest sitcoms in TV history...The Soap (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Jodie and Carol move in together, and Carol learns that she's pregnant with Jodie's baby. Meanwhile, Father Tim and Corrine announce their wedding, and Chester goes to prison when he confesses to killing Peter, following Jessica's conviction... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include Episode 32 in which Carol's father strenuously objects to his daughter's impending marriage to Jodie, and Episode 47 in which the two families work together to perform an exorcism on Corrine's baby while Burt is apparently abducted by aliens...The DVD Report",5,Absolutely hilarious!,1114646400,"04 28, 2005",2005,2338,"['Nominated', '17', 'Emmys', 'short', 'four-year', 'run', 'Soap', 'premiered', 'Fall', '1977', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'shows', 'American', 'television', 'history', 'single', 'episode', 'ever', 'aired', 'show', 'was', 'opposed', 'many', 'groups', 'who', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'mature', 'prime-time', 'audience', 'Soap', 'never', 'overstepped', 'bounds', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'smash', 'hit', 'brilliant', 'satirical', 'spoofs', 'classic', 'daytime', 'programming', 'Sporting', 'all-star', 'cast', 'talented', 'producers', 'show', 'spawned', 'successful', 'spin-off', 'Benson', '1979', 'series', 'launched', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'career', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Set', 'suburban', 'Connecticut', 'Soap', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'wealthy', 'yet', 'dim', 'elitist', 'Mary', 'Campbell', 'Cathryn', 'Damon', 'housewife', 'more', 'traditional', 'blue-collar', 'atmosphere', 'regardless', 'social', 'station', 'life', 'woman', 'escape', 'scandal', 'intrigue', 'surrounding', 'typical', 'soap', 'opera', 'family', 'Jessica', 'daughter', 'Corrine', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'smitten', 'priest', 'yet', 'are', 'having', 'affair', 'same', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Meanwhile', 'Jessica', 'husband', 'Chester', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'incessantly', 'cheat', 'one', 'other', 'side', 'family', 'Mary', 'husband', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'certifiably', 'insane', 'son', 'Danny', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'mobster', 'stepson', 'Jodie', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'out-of-the-closet', 'homosexual', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'family', 'filled', 'promiscuous', 'infidelities', 'quite', 'possibly', 'murder', 'Throw', 'insubordinate', 'sarcastic', 'Tate', 'butler', 'Benson', 'Guillaume', 'Soap', 'own', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', 'TV', 'history', 'Soap', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Jodie', 'Carol', 'move', 'together', 'Carol', 'pregnant', 'Jodie', 'baby', 'Meanwhile', 'Father', 'Tim', 'Corrine', 'announce', 'wedding', 'Chester', 'prison', 'when', 'killing', 'Peter', 'following', 'Jessica', 'conviction', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Episode', '32', 'Carol', 'father', 'strenuously', 'daughter', 'impending', 'marriage', 'Jodie', 'Episode', '47', 'two', 'families', 'work', 'together', 'perform', 'exorcism', 'Corrine', 'baby', 'Burt', 'apparently', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A
824952,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000255LJ8,Byron Kolln,"[11, 12]","The second season of SOAP picks up the story right after the cliffhanger ending of season one.  Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) has been convicted of murdering Peter, and now is about to be sent to prison.  But as we know, she is innocent.  Her husband Chester (Robert Mandan) confesses his guilt and Jessica is a free woman.This season has many many plots going at once (much more than season one which mainly focused on establishing the relationships and the dominating storyline of Peter's murder and the subsequent trial).Chester's incarceration and escape from prison sets up the main story for season two.  He hides out in the Tate cellar with fellow escapee Dutch (Donnelly Rhodes) who later becomes the unlikely love interest of Eunice (Jennifer Salt).  Corrine's (Diana Canova) marriage to `fallen priest' Timothy Flotski ( Sal Viscuso) and Danny's (Ted Wass) marriage to Mob boss' daughter Elaine (Dinah Manoff) are the 2 big weddings of the season.A dissatisfied Mary (Cathryn Damon) goes back to college, which sets up her marriage to Burt (Richard Mulligan) to have a complete breakdown.  After he finds her in a compromising position with her teacher, he gets drunk and spends the night with secretary Sally (Caroline McWilliams), who is actually being blackmailed by the one and only Ingrid (Inga Swenson)!Confused?  That's the idea!  SOAP is a complete send-up of the convuluted plots and subplots of soap-operas.Other choice moments, like Corrine's baby from hell and Elaine's kidnapping, only add to the zaniness and sheer genius that Susan Harris created in SOAP, which can be hilariously funny and yet deeply moving.  By this time we have really come to care about these characters.  SOAP does indeed walk the line between comedy and drama, which is why the show is still timeless and recommended viewing.  And of course there's the trademark season cliffhanger (Burt being abducted by aliens!).Unlike the bare-bones release of season one, the second set of SOAP contains interviews with Susan Harris as well as the other producers, and an `encore presentation' of the first episode.Roll on Season Three!",5,even better than the first season!,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,2125,"['second', 'season', 'SOAP', 'up', 'story', 'right', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'season', 'one', 'Jessica', 'Tate', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'been', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'Peter', 'now', 'be', 'sent', 'prison', 'know', 'innocent', 'husband', 'Chester', 'Robert', 'Mandan', 'guilt', 'Jessica', 'free', 'woman.This', 'season', 'many', 'many', 'plots', 'going', 'once', 'much', 'more', 'season', 'one', 'mainly', 'focused', 'establishing', 'relationships', 'dominating', 'storyline', 'Peter', 'murder', 'subsequent', 'trial', '.Chester', 'incarceration', 'escape', 'prison', 'up', 'main', 'story', 'season', 'two', 'out', 'Tate', 'cellar', 'fellow', 'escapee', 'Dutch', 'Donnelly', 'Rhodes', 'who', 'later', 'unlikely', 'love', 'interest', 'Eunice', 'Jennifer', 'Salt', 'Corrine', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'marriage', 'fallen', 'priest', 'Timothy', 'Flotski', 'Sal', 'Viscuso', 'Danny', 'Ted', 'Wass', 'marriage', 'Mob', 'boss', 'daughter', 'Elaine', 'Dinah', 'Manoff', 'are', '2', 'big', 'weddings', 'season.A', 'dissatisfied', 'Mary', 'Cathryn', 'Damon', 'back', 'college', 'up', 'marriage', 'Burt', 'Richard', 'Mulligan', 'have', 'complete', 'breakdown', 'compromising', 'position', 'teacher', 'drunk', 'night', 'secretary', 'Sally', 'Caroline', 'McWilliams', 'who', 'actually', 'being', 'blackmailed', 'one', 'only', 'Ingrid', 'Inga', 'Swenson', 'Confused', 'idea', 'SOAP', 'complete', 'send-up', 'convuluted', 'plots', 'subplots', 'soap-operas.Other', 'choice', 'moments', 'Corrine', 'baby', 'hell', 'Elaine', 'kidnapping', 'only', 'add', 'zaniness', 'sheer', 'genius', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'created', 'SOAP', 'can', 'be', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'yet', 'deeply', 'moving', 'time', 'have', 'really', 'come', 'care', 'characters', 'SOAP', 'indeed', 'walk', 'line', 'comedy', 'drama', 'why', 'show', 'still', 'timeless', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'course', 'trademark', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'Burt', 'being', 'abducted', 'aliens', 'bare-bones', 'release', 'season', 'one', 'second', 'set', 'SOAP', 'interviews', 'Susan', 'Harris', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'producers', 'encore', 'presentation', 'first', 'episode.Roll', 'Season', 'Three']",N/A

Tim and Corinne get married; and Jodie moves in with Carol. These events give rise to a new series of story arcs, including Eunice falling in love with an escaped convict, Corinne giving birth to a demonically possessed baby, and Chester losing his mind and running away from home.I bought the first two seasons of ""Soap"" after spending most of my childhood hearing, from my parents (who saw it when it was first on TV), just how funny it was. It took me a while to get around to watching it, because I was convinced that it could not possibly live up to what my parents had told me, but when I did finally get around to seeing it, over 30 years after it was first aired, I realized that everything my parents had told me was true. ""Soap"" is, without a doubt, one of the funniest TV shows I have ever seen, and it holds up extremely well after all of these years.The story lines in the second season of ""Soap"" are sillier than those in the first, and whether this is a good thing or a bad thing will largely depend on your point of view. I, personally, liked the ""out there"" story lines. Aliens, evil babies, cults, all of these things are great as far as I'm concerned. However, my mother preferred the more reality-based plots of the first season. The best thing about Season two is that it allowed some of the characters who were in the background in Season one to become more developed. Eunice (Jennifer Salt), for example, whom I considered to be essentially a ""non-character"" in Season one, now gets a major story arc and proves that she is just as funny as her fellow cast members, although Jodie (Billy Crystal), who had a major part in Season one, slips into the background. Finally, as with Season one, Season two also ends on a cliff-hanger (or three).

824957,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B000255LJ8,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 4]","In the annals of television history, ""Soap"" ranks as one of the most outrageous sitcoms ever aired on an American network. Ribald, over the top, whimsical, and with the potential to offend large segments of society, ""Soap"" handily lived up to each of these elements and more. But most importantly the show about two wacko families living lives of utter weirdness was incredibly hilarious. I was a mere seven years old when the program appeared in the late 1970s, but I did remember bits and pieces of the show since my parents let me watch it with them. I know; I can't believe they let a youngster view a program like this one, either, but they rightly figured that my tender age prevented me from understanding the adult themes behind the comedy. Of course, you didn't need to understand much to laugh at the physical machinations of Richard Mulligan. When I finally saw a few episodes on cable a few years back, I finally understood the ruckus. I usually avoid watching television nowadays, but I put ""Soap"" right up there with ""The Rockford Files"" as my two favorite network shows. It's great to see the former arrive on DVD.In true soap opera fashion, the second season of ""Soap"" picks up right where the prior season ended. The shocking denouement of Jessica Tate's (Katherine Helmond) murder trial ends with a startling revelation, one that sees someone very close to her confess to the crime. He goes off to jail only to meet a hardened con named Dutch (Donnelly Rhodes). The two eventually escape from prison, which leads to a romantic relationship between Dutch and Jessica's spoiled daughter Eunice (Jennifer Salt). Chester receives a head injury and suffers a bout of amnesia. Jessica faces a dilemma when she falls in love with Detective Donahue (John Byner) and must decide whether to stay with him or remain faithful to her husband. The second season also provides more information concerning the problematic marriage of Corinne and Tim Flotsky (Diana Canova and Sal Viscuso). The two have the typical problems a couple might encounter when the wife is a reformed tart and the husband a former priest. Billy (Jimmy Baio) has several memorable adventures. The Major engages in his usual antics, and Benson remains a hilarious island of sanity.Then we have the Campbells and their wacky problems. Mary (Cathryn Damon) decides to enroll in college, much to the chagrin of Burt (Richard Mulligan) when he discovers his wife and a college professor might be engaging in more than cracking the books. His disgust over this possible affair leads him to the arms of Sally (Caroline McWilliams) and, by extension, the evil Ingrid (Inga Swenson). Jodie (Billy Crystal) has his own problems, including a baby on the way with a woman as well as continuing problems explaining his sexual orientation to outsiders. Danny (Ted Wass) and Elaine (Dinah Manoff) must deal learn to deal with each other, which they do, right before a tragedy involving their respective backgrounds in organized crime throws their relationship into jeopardy. Expect to see more hilarious hijinks from Chuck and Bob Campbell (Jay Johnson). The high point of the season involves a series of episodes that sees Burt dealing with extraterrestrials. The aliens abduct him, he meets a 4000-year-old man, and he struggles to return to earth. Whew! That's a lot of ground to cover, and even then I'm leaving out a bunch of minor story arcs.Susan Harris and company deliver the goods once again in the second season of this fantastic television series. Only in the 1970s could you put this much wackiness on the air and get away with it. Alien abductions and demonic babies mixed with murder trials and romantic entanglements sure don't sound like the formula for a winning television series, but the creators of ""Soap"" make it all come together in fine fashion. As in the first season, the cast has amazing chemistry, and they possess the chops to pull off the most insane scenarios imaginable. Once again Richard Mulligan works his frenetic magic as the high-strung Burt Campbell. He's my favorite character by far in this show, and it's always a pleasure to see him in action. If I had to critique the second season in any way, I would say that we're already starting to see a softening in the format that would eventually lead to the show's demise a couple of years later. I suspect Harris didn't write as many of the scripts from this point on, although I can't prove it. I did notice that we got a lot fewer of those great Jessica Tate speeches, the ones where she rambles on and on following an internal logic only she understands. I missed those speeches, and I always suspected Harris wrote them.I'm just trying to find something to complain about at this point. The second season of ""Soap"" will keep you entertained for hours and hours. It's great to revisit this show once again, and it's great that they're releasing them on DVD. The episodes on these discs look and sound better than the ones we saw on the first season, although the quality still leaves a lot to be desired. Even better, the people releasing the DVDs included the pilot episode as a bonus (I thought this was on the first season but maybe I'm mistaken) and a featurette containing an interview with Susan Harris and producers Tony Thomas and Paul Junger Witt. Aside from the fact that Harris hardly says a word during this interview, we still learn a lot about the show and its history. They explain how they kept track of the various story arcs and how they confronted the criticism aimed at the show before it even aired. Good stuff. Season two gets five stars from me. I can't wait to move on to the next!",5,Great stuff!,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,5658,"['annals', 'television', 'history', 'Soap', 'ranks', 'one', 'most', 'outrageous', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'aired',

Pretty much all the same characters returned (with a few new characters) in the continuting story of two sisters: Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell. The excellent cast once again provided big laughs in every episode (just as in season 1). But one major cast member would famously depart after season 2. Robert Guillaume, who stole scene after scene in his role as Benson, left after the second season of Soap to go on to his own spin-off show Benson (which was a good show, though not as good as Soap). Just as Benson made its debut in 1979, Guillaume won Soap's first acting Emmy (Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series). That was a well-deserved honor and a wonderful way to go out. It'll be interesting to see how seasons 3 and 4 of Soap play out without Benson.

If you can get past that, you will find that 'Soap' can be hysterical, even in the midst of tragedy.  The most sympathetic character in 'Soap' is Jessica Tate, and when something bad comes her way, you can't help but feel for her, in spite of the many comic bits that lighten the situation.At the end of season one, something bad indeed came Jessica's Way: she had been found guilty for the murder of Peter Campbell.  But wait, poor Jessica is innocent!  At the beginning of season two's first episode, the commentator teases: ""Who really killed Peter Campbell?""  He lists five suspects:Corinne Tate  (Jessica's adopted daughter):  She allowed Peter - a bed-hopping tennis instructor - to move in.  She expected him to be faithful.  When she learned he continued giving bedroom lessons, she threatened to kill him.Chester Tate  (Jessica's husband):  He had been having one affair after another, but when Jessica told him that - in a moment of weakness - that she had an affair, Chester became enraged.The remaining suspects have no obvious motive, but then ...  Each of them have - in a fit of irritation - attempted to kill the annoying little ventriloquist doll named Bob.Benson  (Jessica's butler):  During the first scene of season two, Benson throws Bob out the window; it was a good thing it wasn't a second story window or Bob could have fallen to his death!Burt Campbell  (Jessica's sister's husband and Peter's father):  During season one, Burt tried to strangle Bob; Bob nearly choked to death!Jodie Dallas  (Jessica's sister's son from a previous marriage):  During season one, Jodie crammed Bob into a refrigerator; Bob nearly froze to death!This not your typical whodunnit!DVD picture: fair.
