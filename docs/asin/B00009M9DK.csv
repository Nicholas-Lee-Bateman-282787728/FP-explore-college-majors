He's the only music I play in my car or on my home stereo and I even bought a code-free, region-free DVD player so I could buy the Region 2 version of this particular DVD. I can't understand why America remains unimpressed with his talent. The Robbie Williams Show depicted on this DVD was a manufactured event but well worth the effort. The Robster sings some of his most memorable music including tracks from the recently-released ""Escapology,"" a disc that has broken worldwide records everywhere but the United States. This guy can do it all and he's still under 30. All of Rob's CDs have hidden tracks; and all of his DVDs have games that when played correctly give you bonus footage. I hate these. The game on the Robbie Williams Show is impossible! I don't have the hand-eye coordination necessary to win. Apart from that, he can do no wrong in my book. Williams just completed a record-breaking tour in Europe in which he played to sell out crowds totalling 600,000 people. Since he is probably never going to tour the United States, this DVD is the only way I'll ever get to see him perform.",5,The greatest entertainer of our age,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,1154,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'obsessed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'RW', 'only', 'music', 'play', 'car', 'home', 'stereo', 'even', 'bought', 'code-free', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player', 'so', 'could', 'buy', 'Region', '2', 'version', 'particular', 'DVD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'America', 'unimpressed', 'talent', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'Show', 'depicted', 'DVD', 'was', 'manufactured', 'event', 'well', 'effort', 'Robster', 'most', 'memorable', 'music', 'including', 'tracks', 'recently-released', 'Escapology', 'disc', 'broken', 'worldwide', 'records', 'everywhere', 'United', 'States', 'guy', 'can', 'do', 'still', '30', 'Rob', 'CDs', 'have', 'hidden', 'tracks', 'DVDs', 'have', 'games', 'when', 'played', 'correctly', 'give', 'bonus', 'footage', 'hate', 'game', 'Robbie', 'Williams', 'Show', 'impossible', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hand-eye', 'coordination', 'necessary', 'win', 'Apart', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'book', 'Williams', 'just', 'completed', 'record-breaking', 'tour', 'Europe', 'played', 'sell', 'out', 'crowds', 'totalling', '600,000', 'people', 'probably', 'never', 'going', 'tour', 'United', 'States', 'DVD', 'only', 'way', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'get', 'see', 'perform']",N/A

754152,AR7PMKAE1I3T8,B00009M9DK,"Juan Sanchez ""Juan""","[2, 3]","I bought this DVD yesterday, I went home to watch it... and I saw it twice! I had already seen his show at Knebworth, whit 600 thousand people screaming and singing and now, he's with an attendance of nearly 300 people, something more private, but never less impressive. Maybe the thing I like the most of this guy, is the way he's all the time smiling, making jokes, showing his teeth... that's something very important in a popular person: Seem to be pleasant all the time.This show starts with a genial ROCK DJ, Robbie's transmiting all his energy to the stage, dancing, singing and playing with those lucky people. Following that comes STRONG and SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL, at that time, a new song for everyone and he notices that a girl is trying to sing the song without knowing the lyrics...FEEL is strangely played twice (the first one as a rare part of the concert, due to Robbie's shirt -at first white but suddenly turned to black!- and the last one in the Special Features). Many other new songs: MONSOON, COME UNDONE and HOT FUDGE! (a real HOT Fudge!). He also includes some of his swing performances (remember Live at The Albert). This shows finishes with ANGLES (a classic to close his shows). Masterly played and sang by this idol of our ages. Do you need more to convince that we're in front of a genius?The only think I felt dissapointed with, was the absence of MILLENNIUM, SHE'S THE ONE, KIDS, BETTER MAN and SUPREME. But...

754156,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,B00009M9DK,William,"[3, 3]","One glimpse of this DVD and you will notice that it is not a 'real' concert such as a stadium performance.  This DVD is a copy of a television performance that Williams did in 2002 to promote his then new album ESCAPOLOGY.  The concert therefore feels very rehearsed and scripted.  Nevertheless, it is just as enjoyable as watching a proper concert because WIlliams is so engaging. However, I am yet to work out if he is lip synching.  I realise the songs performed aren't the recorded versions, but I have a sneeking suspicion that he recorded them before this TV concert then lip-synched.
