The special effects, which are the strongest elements in the film, are stunning to watch and they really help with the story (which is pretty weak at times). There are plenty of silly moments and some impressive sets and effects shots. The music is also good. However, there are two problems I have with this movie. One is that the kid characters are terribly dull. They was nothing distinctive or interesting about them. The other flaw I find in this movie is that the journeys that the kids take when they're tiny aren't very adventurous. I mean, the adventures aren't very imaginative. It's not really exciting to see this kids wandering around in the grass.

This version is also not in HD or Blu-Ray so your wider screen TVs will more than likely fuzz the details a little.  However, unlike some reviews, this does not ruin the movie which is, by far, a cult classic of the Rick Moranis generation and for kids that grew up during the time.Rick Moranis plays an inventor with two kids next to the polar opposite family next door, also with two kids.  When a freak baseball accident gets Wayne's (Moranis) shrinking machine to work, it also accidentally fires off and shrinks a chair, a couch, and the four kids.  They get displaced by Wayne cleaning up the area after taking his aggressions on his supposedly not working machine.  This displacement puts them in a trash bag at the other end of the backyard.

Zarco,"[0, 0]","In the Summer of 1989, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989) played in movie theaters while I was forced to spend time at a family member's house as my mom worked. Life threw me a bone when my mom's friend rented it on VHS and treated us all to ice cream in 1990. Local TV stations showed the film during Thanksgiving in the late 1990's. I would enjoy the film with a plate of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. ILM special effects artist Joe Johnston directs Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989). This sci-fi-family-comedy is an homage to sci-fi B movies such as The Incredible Shrinking Man and The Amazing Colossal Man. Rick Moranis plays Wayne Szalinski, an eccentric inventor who creates a machine that shrinks ojbects.Szalinski's children and two boys from next door are accidentally exposed to the shrinking ray and reduced to a 1/4 inch high!The kids struggle to get back inside the house and restored to their normal size. They're attacked by bees, scorpions, and lawnmowers. They also make friends with a baby ant.James Horner(Battle Beyond the Stars, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Krull) composed the music score for the film. Matt Frewer(Supergirl, Max Headroom) is quite good as Wayne's macho neighbor, Russ. The dog who plays Quark gives an earnest performance. The special effects are superb and they were crafted before CGI dominated Hollywood movie making. Marcia Strassman plays Wayne Szalinski's wife, Diane. She's the ""honey"" in the title. Amy O' Neill is lovely and charming as Wayne's daughter...Amy. Robert Oliveri is convincing as Wayne's intelligent son, Nick. He also acted in Edward Scissorhands(1990).Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton play Russ' kids. Horner's music score has an homage to Raymond Scott's Powerhouse B tune. The scene where the baby ant is killed by a scorpion is one of the most ""tearjerking"" scenes that I've ever seen in a movie! This film spawned two sequels, a campy TV show, and a theme park attraction called Honey, I Shrunk the Audience. It was spoofed on The Critic(""Honey, I Laminated the Kids"").

It works great on paper, but he can't make it work in real life.  While he's at a conference presenting his ideas, the machine accidentally shrinks his and his neighbor's kids.  When they get thrown out with the trash, they must journey across the backyard, avoiding bugs, sprinklers, and lawnmowers.  Meanwhile, Wayne and his wife try to fix the machine and find the kids.  Will they find them before it's too late?  Can Wayne figure out how to make the machine work to reverse the process?This is one of my favorite movies.  It combines a great story and great characters with great special effects.  All the characters grow because of their experiences, even both sets of parents.

During a summer of blockbusters (""Batman"", ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", ""Ghostbusters 2""), I was impressed with the scope & creativity of this seemingly small film (no pun intended) which held its own admirably against the other box office juggernauts. Seeing it now, the special effects seem pretty artificial in comparison to the miracle-working CGI stuff today. No matter; it's the imaginative script & acting talent onscreen that's the real deal. Rick Moranis brings his own goofy comedic charm to the role of inventor Wayne Szalinski, who's created a shrink ray machine; trouble is, he can't quite figure out how to perfect it. That is, until a baseball whacked through the upstairs cellar window somehow solves the laser's problems & activates the machine as it randomly shrinks objects such as the furniture. The focus shifts back & forth between the Szalinski family & their neighbors, the Thompsons, headed by thick-headed matriarch Matt Frewer (yep, Max Headroom himself). The ""baseball"" altercation brings the Szalinski & Thompson kids together in the cellar...conveniently in range for the machine to shrink them. Being the preoccupied inventor that he is, Wayne tidily sweeps the kids up, bags them, and drops them off just outside the back yard. Thus, the film presents its main conflict: the kids need to get back to the house; except now, they face the insurmountable task of crossing the yard which has now become a miles-long jungle of giant blades of grass & giant flowers. It's here where the film really excels on imagination as the kids encounter bees, giant cookies, lawn mowers, toys & even make a lone ant a ""pet"". Finally, Wayne realizes what happened to the kids (and what he's done) & has to break the news to his wife (Marcia Strassman, resurfacing after TV's ""Welcome Back, Kotter""). And so, the Thompson parents watch in dumbfounded awe & comment on ""how weird the Szalinski's are"" as Wayne & wife use bizarre contraptions to search for the kids without treading on the lawn. Eventually, through all kinds of unusual obstacles, the kids do make it back into the house, Wayne restores them back to normal size, and the neighbors, through this strange ordeal, actually become ""good"" neighbors.I was rather disappointed that Disney didn't bother to create some DVD extras--at least a ""making of"" featurette--considering this was one of its biggest live-action hits.

It's original and unique - followed by two [HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID and HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES] just as good sequels. This film is about a wacky scientist named Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) who knows all about science and nothing about family or the &quot;real world&quot;. When Wayne creates a shrinking machine, in hopes that it will shrink matter, it actually ends up shrinking his kids, Amy and Nicky (Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri), and his next door neighbor's kids, Russell and Ron Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton). They escape from the trash bag and end up entering what appears to be a jungle but is actually the Szalinskis' own backyard! Now, just a few inches tall, the kids must find a way to get to the house and get their parents' attention so they can deshrink them and turn them back to their normal sizes.This is a very funny comedy, and there are some excellent visual effects, too.

This movie is very freaky, nightmarish and dull.

Now in the backyard they face one  terrifying danger after another. people walk trough the yard and almost squash them. one girl falls in to a mud puddle and nearly drowns. one boy almost gets carried away by a bumble bee.

After an unfortunate baseball-through-the-window accident, the two Selinsky children (and two neighbor pals) are shrunk down and thrown out with the trash.  The rest of the film focuss on their quest back home through a grass jungle, swarms of bees, giant ants, and teh dreaded lawnmower.There are few movies that can be enjoyed by both old and young simultaneously.  Usually, the jokes either use childish situations as a conduit to adult humor, or pander to the kiddies with enough syrupy sap to make adults nearly wretch.  Fortunately, this film succeeds in both areas.  The characters and drama are children fare, but the crazy adventures and touch of heart are enough to keep seasoned viewers tuned in for the duration.Is this little adventure flick an all-time family classic?  Not necessarily...I don't know if anything starring Moranis truly can be.  What it is, however, is a fun, quirky, 93-minutes filled with laughs, thrills, and even a bit of emotion thrown in.
