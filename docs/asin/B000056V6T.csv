570931,AF1VHA7BVWLO1,B000056V6T,Alexia Komaux,"[5, 8]","The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone ""I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them.""Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist.To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn't.",5,Greatest injustice since Sacco and Vanzetti,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,2856,"['question', 'hand', 'film', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'three', 'teenagers', 'commit', 'heinous', 'act', 'rather', 'was', 'enough', 'evidence', 'convict', 'murders', 'answer', 'presented', 'material', 'film', 'unflinching', 'was', 'only', 'speculation', 'rumor', 'convict', 'three.The', 'film', 'strengths', 'are', ""n't"", 'preach', 'least', 'not', 'overly', 'wrought', 'narrative', 'intimate', 'moments', 'accused', 'families', 'as', 'well', 'families', 'victims', 'can', 'understand', 'pain', 'confusion', 'victim', 'families', 'What', 'hard', 'understand', 'bloodlust', 'need', 'revenge', 'retribution', 'immediately', 'hold', 'victims', 'families', 'are', 'most', 'terrifying', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'mother', 'Byrnes', 'child', 'hateful', 'spiteful', 'tone', 'hate', 'hate', 'mother', 'bore', 'anything', 'wrong', 'being', 'hellishly', 'angry', 'someone', 'who', 'butchered', 'child', 'No', 'quite', 'natural', 'really', 'point', 'film', 'judgment', 'was', 'passed', 'kids', 'long', 'trial', 'even', 'started', 'imagine', 'Bible', 'belt', 'very', 'scary', 'place', 'be', 'raised', ""'ll"", 'have', 'ask', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'what', 'time.On', 'issue', 'prosecution', 'had', 'next', 'nothing', 'very', 'questionable', 'confession', 'terrified', 'kid', 'Jessie', '72', 'IQ', 'hearsay', 'couple', 'kids', 'who', 'claim', 'heard', 'Damien', 'bragging', 'murder', 'have', 'proof', 'knife', 'found', 'Damien', 'house', ""n't"", 'match', 'wounds', 'bodies', 'assertion', 'Damien', 'read', 'Wicca', 'must', 'be', 'Satanist.To', 'look', 'three', 'kids', 'also', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'Jessie', 'very', 'small', 'slow', 'kid', 'bit', 'lost', 'world', 'IQ', 'low', 'previous', 'records', 'type', 'behavior', 'would', 'associate', 'murder', 'Jason', 'short', 'breathless', 'words', 'also', 'suffer', 'low', 'IQ', 'Damien', 'key', 'everything', 'film', 'defense', 'made', 'key', 'mistake', 'letting', 'Damien', 'take', 'stand', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'reason', 'Damien', 'have', 'ADD', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'questioning', 'sort', 'fades', 'away', 'answers', 'bland', 'yes', 'second', 'reason', 'most', 'important', 'Damien', 'obviously', 'extremely', 'bright', 'Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'problem', 'judging', 'single', 'person', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'camera', 'smart', 'people', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'area', 'world', 'Damien', 'scared', 'them.All', 'up', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'put', 'kids', 'away', 'were', 'other', 'more', 'sinister', 'shocking', 'needed', 'be', 'pursued', 'war', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', 'indeed', 'frightening', 'think', 'did', 'terrifying', 'think', 'did', ""n't""]",N/A

But I don't agree with those viewers and reviewers who express conviction that there was a gross miscarriage of justice; that the three boys found guilty of the murders are in fact innocent.  To be sure, they may well be; ""Paradise Lost"" certainly offers one ample cause to have reasonable doubt.  It's important to note, however, that the juries didn't render their verdicts based on the documentary, but on the evidence presented at the trials.  While I'm inclined to believe that the boys aren't guilty, that inclination is based on the documentary.  It's impossible to know with certainty what verdict I would have rendered had I been a juror at one of the trials.

But everyone in it had similar accents (although some thicker than others), this did not prejudice me on the main topic. That is, were the so-called West Memphis Three guilty of the horrible murders of three little boys?Warning: the movie starts with video footage the police shot at the scene, and so you will see the bodies of the victims. However, they could be a whole lot worse, so once you get over the fact that you are seeing actual dead bodies and not some special effects trick of wax or resin, it's not that bad.Three teenagers were soon arrested, and we follow the case against them from beginning to end. You will have to decide for yourself whether the boys are guilty or not, because even the very end of the movie doesn't make it definite. What you will get is a chilling look at the way the prosecution, the press, the TV news, and just about everyone else in the town simply assumed they were guilty, in large part because one of them was a pagan, interested in Wicca, and they liked the music of Metallica. The other thing is the hard, cold, almost demonic hate the families and neighbors of the victims feel toward the accused long before the trial begins. Also, how the police never followed up any possible leads to any other suspects.It's very grim, but it's also an important slice of American life.",3,Dramatic Documentary of Brutal Murder,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1451,"['Let', 'state', 'prejudice', 'outset', 'story', 'place', 'Arkansas', 'accents', 'grated', 'nerves', 'whole', 'time', 'everyone', 'had', 'similar', 'accents', 'thicker', 'others', 'did', 'not', 'prejudice', 'main', 'topic', 'were', 'so-called', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', 'guilty', 'horrible', 'murders', 'three', 'little', 'boys', 'Warning', 'movie', 'video', 'footage', 'police', 'shot', 'scene', 'so', 'will', 'see', 'bodies', 'victims', 'However', 'could', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'so', 'once', 'get', 'fact', 'are', 'seeing', 'actual', 'dead', 'bodies', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'trick', 'wax', 'resin', 'not', 'bad.Three', 'teenagers', 'were', 'soon', 'arrested', 'follow', 'case', 'beginning', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'boys', 'are', 'guilty', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'end', 'movie', ""n't"", 'make', 'definite', 'What', 'will', 'get', 'chilling', 'look', 'way', 'prosecution', 'press', 'TV', 'news', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'town', 'simply', 'assumed', 'were', 'guilty', 'large', 'part', 'one', 'was', 'pagan', 'interested', 'Wicca', 'liked', 'music', 'Metallica', 'other', 'thing', 'hard', 'cold', 'almost', 'demonic', 'hate', 'families', 'neighbors', 'victims', 'feel', 'accused', 'long', 'trial', 'Also', 'how', 'police', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'possible', 'leads', 'other', 'suspects.It', 'very', 'grim', 'also', 'important', 'slice', 'American', 'life']",N/A

You won't be able to forget it.Have you ever been in a plane when, just for second, it abruptly loses some altitude, and your stomach seems like it dropped through the floor?  You're gonna feel like that for a couple of days or so after seeing this movie.Without telling you too much, here's what you need to know:  there has been a murder in rural Arkansas, and some local boys who don't quite fit in (i.e., they have been dressing in black and listening to Metallica) are fingered for it.  The film, a gut-wrenching documentary, follows them through their trial and analyzes the evidence for and against their innocence.  The film is especially recommended if you enjoy documentaries that get into forensic evidence.I'm sure this happens a lot, but in this particular case the three boys had the good fortune of having HBO make a documentary about the trials while they were happening.  Ever since then, they've had a big following of people who -- while perhaps not saying the three are innocent -- at least insist they were given capital sentences on some rather flimsy evidence.  If you love stories of where the American justice system really goes off the rails -- not in one aspect or incident but systematically -- this film will be hard to match.But I would like to point out that those baying for the blood of Byers or Hobbs should stop to reflect that, if the tables were somehow turned and THOSE GUYS had wound up in the slammer, in theory the same outrage would obtain:  man locked up on flimsy evidence.  Yet something tells me that, since neither of those guys are Wiccans or listen to Metallica, there wouldn't have been such a brou-ha-ha about a horrendous miscarriage of justice.What I'm saying is that one's anger should be directed at the justice system, not against those against whom there is still -- even now -- rather slender evidence.  If Byers were thrown in prison on nothing more than what they currently have against him, would you be equally outraged?  I doubt it.I point this out to suggest that much of the outrage over this case is not actually outrage at the justice system malfunctioning, but rather a way of signalling support for a trio of young goth-dressing misfits.There was, in addition, a direct-to-video followup film:  Paradise Lost 2:  Revelations.No connection, incidentally, with the Milton epic.UPDATE:  These guys have finally been released.

570936,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,B000056V6T,Charles J. Rector,"[23, 94]","Paradise Lost is an exercise in historical revisionism. Its producers aimed at spinning history with the hope that a trio of clearly guilty murderers would be released. This alleged documentary plays fast and loose with the facts that it presents while leaving inconvenient facts on the cutting room floor to present a false picture of three innocent lads being railroaded for crimes that they did not commit.Paradise Lost is a dishonest documentary in that while the producers never state their opinions directly, they deliberately omit certain facts while twisting other facts so that they can present a distorted version of what really happened. For instance, the producers want you to believe that the convicted killers were really innocent, that there was no real evidence against them. The makers of this documentary want you to believe that the 3 teenagers were convicted due to their love of heavy metal, the works of Stephen King, the fact they wore black T-shirts and because there was a ""satanic panic"" in the community.The documentary producers also use John Mark Byers, the stepfather of one of the victims, as a red herring. They insinuate that Byers should have been the top suspect instead of the 3 convicted punks. They conveniently leave out the fact that Byers had an airtight alibi and was cleared of suspicion following an intensive police investigation. This so-called documentary implies that since Byers is mentally slow, then he could have been the real murderer.Paradise Lost was made along the lines of a Michael Moore documentary sans the comedy. Like a Moore documentary, Paradise Lost shows some of both sides of an issue, but upon further examination, it is clearly one sided. In this case, the bias is on the side of the convicted criminals. Facts that point towards guilt are either glossed over or entirely left out. Contrary to the movie, the trio were not convicted just because they wore black or liked heavy metal music. That is a gross distortion of the evidence against them.Paradise Lost is one of those documentaries where if you do not know much about the subject, your response likely will be that what happened to the 3 convicts was a horrible miscarriage of justice. However, if you actually know a good deal about what really happened, your reaction is that the documentary itself was nothing but a sham and a fraud.Paradise Lost is a sham and a fraud that is not worth either your time or your hard earned money.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 3]","PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT ROBIN HOOD HILLS (1996) is an interesting HBO Films documentary, the first of two, with a third and final part on the way (on HBO in January 2012).This tells a most heartrending story, in case you've not heard all about it lately on the news. This is the story of three innocent 8-year-old boys who were brutally tortured, murdered then dumped near a stream in a section of West Memphis, Arkansas, known as the Robin Hood Hills. Three local teens were targeted and arrested for this crime - they were tried and found guilty.The most disturbing attitude about this documentary is the fact that the boys were targeted for allegedly following their 'ringleader', the now-famous ""Damien"" Echols, in a Satanic murder ritual. Echols was actually originally named by another of the accused boys, and everyone descended on him because he was a self-professed Wiccan and something of a Goth at the time. Echols said before his trial that his hometown was ""another Salem"", since any and all crime was immediately attributed to Satanic witchcraft.The documentary then sets out to expose a lousy law enforcement, terrible work by the prosecution and lack of real evidence against the three accused boys, who have become known as the ""West Memphis Three"". While it does a great job and is riveting, I found this documentary to be confusing at certain points while at other times it struck me as rather ridiculous. The boys are not fairly profiled at all, yet we are supposed to feel some connexion to them. Same goes for the local law enforcement.Still this is a documentary that was clearly going to be followed up by the filmmakers. Echols received the death sentence and went directly to Death Row. The other two boys, if I am not in error, received a life-sentence-plus-forty.There are several things to which I direct the newcomers' attention: watch the interesting stepfather of one of the murdered children, John Mike Byers by name. If you react to him the way my wife and I did, well, be ready for the sequel documentary, REVELATIONS PARADISE LOST 2 (a/k/a PARADISE LOST 2: REVELATIONS, see my review and note: there is a DVD set with both titles available now).But I must say you have to be living under a rock if you haven't heard of this yet. In any event it is a fantastic indictment of a lousy justice system, police incompetence and in one case defense incompetence. This will make you understand once and for all time how the justice system in America will either be fixed or will one day completely break down - and that will cost lives.",5,"A witch-hunt at ""the second Salem""?

Perhaps in no other situation than a true crime will we see people in their starkest form, confronted with situations that they would never face no matter what their value systems, socioeconomic background, religious beliefs, etc.  This was a true horror story unlike anything.In 1996, three teenage boys were arrested for the brutal murder and mutilation of three second grade boys in a small town in Arkansas.  They were found in creek bed, near an area known for some ""strange things"".  The three teenagers wore heavy metal T shirts, listened to metal music, and were into Satan worship.  They were the subject of a witchhunt, with the whole town after them.Having watched this, I see this in so many lights.  Perhaps the most horrifying was the fact that we see the videotaped evidence of the children at the creekbed.  Who killed these children and why?  Maybe they saw something they weren't supposed to see, or maybe they were just there at the wrong time.  One of the teenagers relented, after 12 hours of grilling, saying that he and the other two murdered the kids.Having lived through a lot of this nonsense growning up, I know that all this foolishness about Satanism and black masses and sacrificing virgins is just a bunch of baloney.  Yes, these things have happened in the past, but they have not happened as often as we have been lead to believe that they have.  Most of that is all hype, urban angst and paranoia.  That being said, there are teenagers who (although these days are about 20 years outdated) are trying to make their statements of ""I want attention"" by dressing outlandishly and acting out.  Most of it is about how you dress and what music you listen to.  There is also wicca religion, which is not indicative of Satanism or metal music, but popular opinion says that it's the same.Jessie is the turncoat, the one who said that the three of them killed the boys.  He has an IQ of 71 and confessed after being held under police pressure for 12 hours.  Taking this into account, despite his low IQ, I think he was telling the truth.  Eventually people cannot keep a secret.  Jason, the second fiddle to the leader, comes off as passive and showing some regret in his blank face.  We see the leader of the three, Damian, as the master of the plan.  He is the boogeyman we are all to fear.  He comes off as being an ""average guy"" type in interviews, but, I don't trust him.  I don't trust him because we are looking at the kinder, gentler Damian and not the man who committed a murder.  We meet about three quarters of the way through the movie his girlfriend and mother of his son, who he will not get to raise as he will be behind bars.  Parenthood changes a person to the point that they are softer and less angry.  Prison life as well has probably made him look at things before as being ridiculous to what he was so angry about.  They were dangerous people before they came under the gun for these murders.That being said, did one or all of these teenage boys murder these children?  The answer is a resounding YES in my mind.  They would have murdered these children if they were upper class yuppies or trailer trash, which they just happened to be.  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe they did it because they could.A true horror story that shows you what happens to families and communities with tragedy.  Truly weird and shocking.

They had been brutally murdered; to this date their killer(or killers have not been brought to justice. Paradise Lost is a startling film about this tragic case, which focuses on the so-called West Memphis Three, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelly, and the terrible miscarriage of justice that their trials represent.What happened in this case could be called a modern day Witch hunt that was fueled by paranoia, lurid rumor, wild speculation and rush to judgment that led to the convictions of three innocent youth simply because they happened to be different from those in their community. So while this is also the story of three young boys who were murdered, which is tragic enough in itself, it is also one of three others that are being murdered by a legal system corrupted by ignorance, prejudice and hate.  That there is absolutely no physical evidence of any kind linking any of the three to the murders should be alarming in itself to anyone who has any faith in the American legal system, and considering that the three were convicted solely on the weight of a coerced confession, which was later recanted, these facts should make any reasonable person seriously question what happened here. Not surprisingly, the same police officers who coerced a confession from Jessie Misskelly, a person who also suffers from mild retardation, have totally ignored the possibility of any other suspects and have deliberately destroyed evidence that contradicts the story they concocted. In addition, it is obvious to any observer of the case that even the judge seemed to have a preconceived opinion of the defendant's guilt and decided against them time and time again to ensure their convictions. Am I saying this is some vast police conspiracy carried out to wreck the lives of three young men, whose only crime was being different? No, but what I am saying is that when law enforcement officials adhere to a win at all cost mentality the first victim of such tactics is always truth and after that is dispensed with justice always follows, piling injustice upon injustice, tragedy upon tragedy, while the real murderer or murderers remains free. Doesn't the innocent victims of these heinous crimes deserve better than this? Where is their justice?What can we really say about our precious freedoms and are great legal code when people who are different from us are still being persecuted for no other reason than their differences, just as they were in Salem in 1691? Is it a crime to listen to Metallica and wear black clothes? Is it a crime to read books written by Anne Rice and Aleister Crowley? Is it a crime to be interested in Wicca? As this case sadly illustrates, in some parts of this country apparently it is, and if new trials or clemency is not granted soon, the penalty for their deviations from the accepted ""norms"" will be death for Damien Echols, while Jessie Misskelly and Jason Baldwin will most likely spend the rest of their lives in prison.

570957,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000056V6T,OverTheMoon,"[3, 3]","Paradise Lost is not an uneventful documentary to say the least. The backdrop is West Memphis during the early to mid 1990s and concerns the disappearance and murder of three children and the sensational media blitz that followed in the wake of the arrest, trial and conviction of two teenagers and one young adult on the bases of a confession that many doubt the authenticity of, the circumstances of the extraction and the low-IQ of the confessor.What makes this documentary so interesting is the lack of evidence and demonizing of the accused because of how they dress and the music they listen to and how one of them read books about Wicca. The prosecutors present a satanic panic case in order to make up for being short on the proof they need to agree with the confession to create a solid case. In this respect Paradise Lost does not say that the `West Memphis 3' are innocent, or even if justice has been served, but has the case been properly handled. What you mostly see during the trial is that the prosecutors terrify a fundamentalist Christian community with accusations and hearsay of satanic ritual killings accompanied by very dubious evidence to support that view.The film makers focus on the lives of the families of the accused, the accused and especially the lawyers, but eventually turn their attention to one particular family member of a victim who eventually has to take the stand after blood stains are discovered on his hunting knife. The blood evidence however is inconclusive.Even though the documentary is very popular, it does have some failings. It doesn't explain everything about the case and sometimes just jumps right into the events as they unfold without explaining how they got there. That is not to say that the documentary doesn't do a job of putting forward a good argument for injustice, but at the same time it's not just a lynching as some viewers may expect given the notoriety this material has in promoting the innocence of the West Memphis 3. There are certain aspects of the accused behavior that don't always add up, on and off the camera. It is really very hard to come away thinking that the West Memphis 3 are completely innocent, but there is enough oddities to warrant further investigation into how this case was handles. To this extent viewers will probably want to also watch Paradise Lost 2 to discover what else has come to light since this documentary brought the attention of the world to what could be a 20th century witch hunt.*Note* This documentary contains graphic images some of which is video from the actual crime scene itself.",4,A 20th Century Witch hunt?,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2597,"['Paradise', 'Lost', 'not', 'uneventful', 'documentary', 'say', 'least', 'backdrop', 'West', 'Memphis', 'early', 'mid', '1990s', 'concerns', 'disappearance', 'murder', 'three', 'children', 'sensational', 'media', 'blitz', 'followed', 'wake', 'arrest', 'trial', 'conviction', 'two', 'teenagers', 'one', 'young', 'adult', 'bases', 'confession', 'many', 'doubt', 'authenticity', 'circumstances', 'extraction', 'low-IQ', 'confessor.What', 'documentary', 'so', 'interesting', 'lack', 'evidence', 'demonizing', 'accused', 'how', 'dress', 'music', 'listen', 'how', 'one', 'read', 'books', 'Wicca', 'prosecutors', 'present', 'satanic', 'panic', 'case', 'order', 'make', 'up', 'being', 'short', 'proof', 'need', 'agree', 'confession', 'create', 'solid', 'case', 'respect', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'not', 'say', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'are', 'innocent', 'even', 'justice', 'been', 'served', 'case', 'been', 'properly', 'handled', 'What', 'mostly', 'see', 'trial', 'prosecutors', 'terrify', 'fundamentalist', 'Christian', 'community', 'accusations', 'hearsay', 'satanic', 'ritual', 'killings', 'accompanied', 'very', 'dubious', 'evidence', 'support', 'view.The', 'film', 'makers', 'focus', 'lives', 'families', 'accused', 'accused', 'especially', 'lawyers', 'eventually', 'turn', 'attention', 'one', 'particular', 'family', 'member', 'victim', 'who', 'eventually', 'take', 'stand', 'blood', 'stains', 'are', 'discovered', 'hunting', 'knife', 'blood', 'evidence', 'however', 'inconclusive.Even', 'documentary', 'very', 'popular', 'have', 'failings', ""n't"", 'explain', 'everything', 'case', 'sometimes', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'events', 'unfold', 'explaining', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'not', 'say', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'do', 'job', 'putting', 'forward', 'good', 'argument', 'injustice', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'lynching', 'viewers', 'may', 'expect', 'given', 'notoriety', 'material', 'promoting', 'innocence', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'accused', 'behavior', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'add', 'up', 'camera', 'really', 'very', 'hard', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'West', 'Memphis', '3', 'are', 'completely', 'innocent', 'enough', 'oddities', 'warrant', 'further', 'investigation', 'how', 'case', 'was', 'handles', 'extent', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'also', 'watch', 'Paradise', 'Lost', '2', 'discover', 'what', 'else', 'come', 'light', 'documentary', 'brought', 'attention', 'world', 'what', 'could', 'be', '20th', 'century', 'witch', 'hunt', '*Note*', 'documentary', 'graphic', 'images', 'video', 'actual', 'crime', 'scene']",N/A

And in this, they succeed beyond their wildest dreams. Paradise Lost is less a story of a murder and a trial than it is-- and this is the case whether the West Memphis Three are guilty or not-- the devastating power, and stupidity, of mindless prejudice.The movie opens with the brutal slayings of three second-graders in the backwater town of West Memphis, Arkansas (across the river from Memphis, TN), and the arrest of three teenagers for the crime. The main reason these teenagers were picked up, as far as we can see, is that they don't fit in with the society around them. We are then treated to a host of interviews with the victims' families. Perhaps their pain and rage is understandable. Perhaps you can even identify with their desire for vengeance, and their willingness to express it in the most unintelligent (and often unintelligible) terms. But we get the feeling that these are people who couldn't care less where they vent this vengeance; if the neighbor's pet hamster had been picked up for the crime, they'd be on the phone with Richard Gere, paper towel roll in hand, without needing a shred of evidence other than ""my, that hamster was a different sort, weren't he?"".Given that, the movie does raise the question of whether, as one of the victims' relatives so eloquently states, our system sucks, though certainly not in the manner they mean. One has to wonder whether sometimes the families of the victims wouldn't be better off put out of their-- and our-- misery. One has to wonder why it is that reproductive-rights advocates believe in reproductive rights at all when people like this have been allowed to breed. One has to wonder whether it's possible for anyone in a place like West Memphis, Arkansas, to get a fair trial if that person doesn't wear a camouflage hunting jacket and have a gun rack in the back of the car window.This is why I say the trial itself may have been of less interest to the filmmakers; it seems obvious to me that their intent was to raise in the viewer a virulent hatred for the people of West Memphis. They certainly succeeded in my case. And I guess that makes it a good documentary in that it seems to have done what it set out to do. I did wish, however, that I had gotten to see more of the trial itself, kangaroo court though it may have been; it couldn't have raised any more offense and outrage in me than did the scores of interviews with idiots. ***",3,"Disappointing, but that's no fault of the filmmakers.",1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,2860,"['Paradise', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Murders', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Hills', 'Joe', 'Berlinger', 'Bruce', 'Sinofsky', '1996', 'relatively', 'obvious', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hour', 'so', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Murders', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Hills', 'chronicling', 'case', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', ""'ve"", 'come', 'be', 'known', 'less', 'goal', 'Berlinger', 'Sinofsky', 'Brother', 'Keeper', 'making', 'general', 'populace', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'look', 'blithering', 'morons', 'succeed', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'less', 'story', 'murder', 'trial', 'case', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Three', 'are', 'guilty', 'not', 'devastating', 'power', 'stupidity', 'mindless', 'prejudice.The', 'movie', 'brutal', 'slayings', 'three', 'second-graders', 'backwater', 'town', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'river', 'Memphis', 'TN', 'arrest', 'three', 'teenagers', 'crime', 'main', 'reason', 'teenagers', 'were', 'picked', 'up', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'society', 'are', 'then', 'treated', 'host', 'interviews', 'victims', 'families', 'Perhaps', 'pain', 'rage', 'understandable', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'even', 'identify', 'desire', 'vengeance', 'willingness', 'express', 'most', 'unintelligent', 'often', 'unintelligible', 'terms', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'where', 'vent', 'vengeance', 'neighbor', 'pet', 'hamster', 'had', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'crime', ""'d"", 'be', 'phone', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'paper', 'towel', 'roll', 'hand', 'needing', 'shred', 'evidence', 'other', 'hamster', 'was', 'different', 'sort', 'were', ""n't"", '.Given', 'movie', 'raise', 'question', 'one', 'victims', 'relatives', 'so', 'eloquently', 'states', 'system', 'certainly', 'not', 'manner', 'mean', 'One', 'wonder', 'sometimes', 'families', 'victims', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'put', 'misery', 'One', 'wonder', 'why', 'reproductive-rights', 'advocates', 'believe', 'reproductive', 'rights', 'when', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'breed', 'One', 'wonder', 'possible', 'anyone', 'place', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', 'get', 'fair', 'trial', 'person', ""n't"", 'wear', 'camouflage', 'hunting', 'jacket', 'have', 'gun', 'rack', 'back', 'car', 'window.This', 'why', 'say', 'trial', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'interest', 'filmmakers', 'obvious', 'intent', 'was', 'raise', 'viewer', 'virulent', 'hatred', 'people', 'West', 'Memphis', 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'case', 'guess', 'good', 'documentary', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'did', 'wish', 'however', 'had', 'gotten', 'see', 'more', 'trial', 'kangaroo', 'court', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'raised', 'more', 'offense', 'outrage', 'did', 'scores', 'interviews', 'idiots', '***']",N/A

After watching Paradise Lost, I'm not sure that one wants to see laws enforced, either. The film concerns the murder and mutilation of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, in 1993. Paradise Lost focuses on the trial of the three boys accused of the murders. I came away with many questions about ""what really happened.""The filmmakers had access to the defendants, the defendants' families, and the families of the murdered boys. One of the defendants has an IQ of only 72. Another is largely inarticulate. The scenes with the families of the murdered boys are particularly intense; each family copes with the murders in a very different manner.After the murders, a rumor started that the murders were part of a satanic ritual. The publicity and anger surrounding the case were intense. The filmmakers focus on the fact that the defendants were ""white trash"" kids who did not ""fit"" well in West Memphis. Could ""goth"" kids get a fair trial? The prosecutors made much of one defendant's interest in Aleister Crowley and magic.I think that a few aspects of the film could have been better. We do not learn enough about the defendants. I wanted to know more about what their lives were like before the murders.Paradise Lost is an interesting, if depressing, film. There is a sequel and I look forward to seeing that film as well.",4,Was Justice Done?,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,1416,"['Bismarck', 'famously', 'said', 'two', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'made', 'were', 'laws', 'sausages', 'watching', 'Paradise', 'Lost', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'see', 'laws', 'enforced', 'film', 'murder', 'mutilation', 'three', 'boys', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Arkansas', '1993', 'Paradise', 'Lost', 'focuses', 'trial', 'three', 'boys', 'accused', 'murders', 'came', 'away', 'many', 'questions', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'access', 'defendants', 'defendants', 'families', 'families', 'murdered', 'boys', 'One', 'defendants', 'IQ', 'only', '72', 'largely', 'inarticulate', 'scenes', 'families', 'murdered', 'boys', 'are', 'particularly', 'intense', 'family', 'murders', 'very', 'different', 'manner.After', 'murders', 'rumor', 'started', 'murders', 'were', 'part', 'satanic', 'ritual', 'publicity', 'anger', 'surrounding', 'case', 'were', 'intense', 'filmmakers', 'focus', 'fact', 'defendants', 'were', 'white', 'trash', 'kids', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'West', 'Memphis', 'Could', 'goth', 'kids', 'get', 'fair', 'trial', 'prosecutors', 'made', 'much', 'one', 'defendant', 'interest', 'Aleister', 'Crowley', 'magic.I', 'think', 'few', 'aspects', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'enough', 'defendants', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'lives', 'were', 'murders.Paradise', 'Lost', 'interesting', 'depressing', 'film', 'sequel', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'as', 'well']",N/A

""NightOwl""","[3, 5]","This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see--it draws you into the world of the West Memphis 3 Case, a true story which is not over yet. One young man is on death row &amp; 2 others doing life sentences because of a modern day witch hunt called &quot;satanic panic&quot; very similar to the Salem witch trials of history. If you ever thought Salem can't happen again in this day &amp; age--see this film! Basically, these kids were railroaded for the brutal murder of 3 young boys  because they wore black clothes &amp; liked Metallica (who let the filmmakers uas their songs as a soundtrack for free). Its also amazing because its all the REAL people, the real trial, everything is real, no actors. To top that, the guy who probably DID do it is the dad of one of the victims &amp; is featured prominently in BOTH films! (There is a sequel to this that continues the story further, just shown on HBO.) There is also an excellent website, overflowing with actual documents, huge amounts of data to wade through: &quot;Free The West Memphis 3&quot;..
