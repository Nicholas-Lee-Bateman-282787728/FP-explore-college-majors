We just saw him at around 5 years old playing a ragtime piano piece with extreme proficiency on the Leno show.  We really enjoy his personality and his music ability.  He is like a grownup in a boy's body!,5,great dvd,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",2014,271,"['Ethan', 'extremely', 'talented', 'been', 'very', 'early', 'age', 'just', 'saw', '5', 'years', 'old', 'playing', 'ragtime', 'piano', 'piece', 'extreme', 'proficiency', 'Leno', 'show', 'really', 'enjoy', 'personality', 'music', 'ability', 'grownup', 'boy', 'body']",Anything is Possible

I wish I could put into words how it made me feel.  I loved what the little girl said, &#34;Anyone can be a Father, but not everyone could be a Dad.&#34;  Life can change in an instant.  Always tell the people you love how much you love them because at the end of the day they could not be there, God could want them back.  God worked a miracle in the life of this little boy.  He is amazing.  This movie had some of the most incredible actors in it I have ever seen.  You have to see this movie to believe it.  Thank You God for letting them make such an inspirational movie.

While not specifically a Christian film, scriptural principles are the basis of this movie.  Jesus said to His disciples that we needed to become like children in order to enter the kingdom of heaven.  Why?  Children have not yet been tainted by the world and instinctively believe that anything is possible.  This young man is remarkable and his willingness to move beyond his fears to help others, even while he is in the midst of his own pain and situation, will bring you to tears!  There is specifically one scene in the movie where the innocence of a child is so clearly demonstrated when the young man is hiding in the basement and asks where he can sleep.  You need to be alert to not miss it, but I  found it to be priceless.
