When their marriage becomes mundane and sexless, domesticity leaves him ""bored"". Brenda is an active mother and a school teacher, and Richard is a formidable player on the corporate Manhattan ladder. Fantasy creeps all over him as he tries to find an outlet to his desires laying dormant in his wife. He meets his friend's old flame, Nikki Tru, who needs and uses Richard for her own interests. Always ambivalent about consummating his fantasy, fellow worker George (Steve Buscemi) gives him food for thought as Richard tries to juggle his longing, his marriage, and his career.Ponderous, yet philosophical at times, the comical execution is done with maturity--in admirable aspects other than the free flow of f-bombs. Even if after the first two-thirds, the movie takes a necessary, but over long time-out, 'I Think I Love My Wife' is a thoroughly likable movie. (When it does get philosophical, Chris Rock delivers expertly in ways that aren't overdone.) The trailer led me to expect less, but I thought if Chris Rock showed up, it had to be good. At least I was right with my latter instinct.

If the combination sounds strange to you, ""I Think I Love My Wife"" doesn't disagree. French New Wave director Rohmer defined his career making movies about conflicted, morally shaky men, and it's interesting to report that Chris Rock has managed to maintain some of the integrity of his film. Co-writing (with Louis C.K.) and directing ""Wife,"" Rock is looking for a break from the broad comedies he's normally associated with, including his last directorial effort, the amusing 2003 political lampoon,Head of State (Widescreen Edition)This, the second film that Rock has directed, registers as a bigger squandering of his talent than all of the priorBad Company (2002) (Ws),Dogma (Special Edition), andMadagascar (Widescreen Edition)combined.""I Think I Love My Wife"" tells the story of Richard Cooper (Rock), his wife Brenda (Gina Torres) and the other woman, Nikki Tru (Kerri Washington), who starts showing up at Richard's Wall Street office in clothes more suitable for a nightclub. We know right off the bat that Richard and Brenda, who enjoy a comfortable lifestyle with their two children in a New York City suburb, are not having sex anymore because Brenda is tired and disinterested. And we know that because Richard is bored and frustrated in his relationship. So, once hot Nikki enters the picture, we know that the plot will revolve around Richard. Will he or won't he (become another philandering husband)? This main point of the plot is one that may be viewed differently by men and women. The subtexts of the plot include, for me, the higher incidence of divorce in the Black community, the now-famous 42.4 percent of Black women who do not marry, whether single women respect the marriages of other women, many new narratives that make sex the central point and tool in relationships, and factors that make a man (or woman) leave their spouse and children. Others may think that Brenda needs to get with the program or definitely lose her husband, and that Richard is well within his rights to seek intimacy elsewhere since it is not provided at home.This is obviously a lot of social context for a romantic comedy but Rock carries it off well, with stinging jokes, including ones about male fantasies, the sizes of women's panties and Viagra. The story is primarily told from Richard's male perspective, though, so we empathize most with him and see the women in his life through his eyes. We don't really get to know Brenda or Nikki for that matter, in the way that we get to know, for example, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's character inJerry MaguireWe don't hear Brenda's side of the story. She just seems wrong and probably playing herself.Unlike Rohmer, Rock is more interested in a happier ending of sorts, but leaves the relationships in a semi-unfinished state. Had the film contained more layering up to this point, it wouldn't feel as blindsiding as it actually does. Rock sets up ""I Think I Love My Wife"" as something much more dangerous and insightful than it ends up being, and he seems unwilling to settle on a tone that would allow the film a chance to relax and gel in its own way. Despite its missing pieces, ""I Think I Love My Wife"" is an enjoyable, human flick. It reminds us that, as adults, our decisions are ours alone, and that we can't blame anyone--even our spouses or the spouses of other people--for what we decide to do with our lives.",3,[3.5]--Insightful honesty to the married man's dilemma,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,3457,"['Well', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'together', 'last', 'Wait', 'minute', 'Rock', 'Rohmer', 'combination', 'strange', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'director', 'Rohmer', 'defined', 'career', 'making', 'movies', 'conflicted', 'morally', 'shaky', 'men', 'interesting', 'report', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'managed', 'maintain', 'integrity', 'film', 'Co-writing', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'directing', 'Wife', 'Rock', 'looking', 'break', 'broad', 'comedies', 'normally', 'associated', 'including', 'last', 'directorial', 'effort', 'amusing', '2003', 'political', 'lampoon', 'Head', 'State', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'second', 'film', 'Rock', 'directed', 'registers', 'bigger', 'squandering', 'talent', 'priorBad', 'Company', '2002', 'Ws', 'Dogma', 'Special', 'Edition', 'andMadagascar', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'combined', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', 'story', 'Richard', 'Cooper', 'Rock', 'wife', 'Brenda', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'other', 'woman', 'Nikki', 'Tru', 'Kerri', 'Washington', 'who', 'showing', 'up', 'Richard', 'Wall', 'Street', 'office', 'clothes', 'more', 'suitable', 'nightclub', 'know', 'right', 'bat', 'Richard', 'Brenda', 'who', 'enjoy', 'comfortable', 'lifestyle', 'two', 'children', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'suburb', 'are', 'not', 'having', 'sex', 'anymore', 'Brenda', 'tired', 'disinterested', 'know', 'Richard', 'bored', 'frustrated', 'relationship', 'So', 'once', 'hot', 'Nikki', 'picture', 'know', 'plot', 'will', 'revolve', 'around', 'Richard', 'Will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'become', 'philandering', 'husband', 'main', 'point', 'plot', 'one', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'differently', 'men', 'women', 'subtexts', 'plot', 'include', 'higher', 'incidence', 'divorce', 'Black', 'community', 'now-famous', '42.4', 'percent', 'Black', 'women', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'marry', 'single', 'women', 'respect', 'marriages', 'other', 'women', 'many', 'new', 'narratives', 'make', 'sex', 'central', 'point', 'tool', 'relationships', 'factors', 'make', 'man', 'woman', 'leave', 'spouse', 'children', 'Others', 'may', 'think', 'Brenda', 'get', 'program', 'definitely', 'lose', 'husband', 'Richard', 'well', 'rights', 'seek', 'intimacy', 'elsewhere', 'not', 'provided', 'home.This', 'obviously', 'lot', 'social', 'context', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Rock', 'off', 'well', 'stinging', 'jokes', 'including', 'ones', 'male', 'fantasies', 'sizes', 'women', 'panties', 'Viagra', 'story', 'primarily', 'told', 'Richard', 'male', 'perspective', 'though', 'empathize', 'most', 'see', 'women', 'life', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'Brenda', 'Nikki', 'matter', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'example', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'character', 'inJerry', 'MaguireWe', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Brenda', 'side', 'story', 'just', 'wrong', 'probably', 'playing', 'herself.Unlike', 'Rohmer', 'Rock', 'more', 'interested', 'happier', 'ending', 'sorts', 'relationships', 'semi-unfinished', 'state', 'Had', 'film', 'contained', 'more', 'layering', 'up', 'point', 'would', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'blindsiding', 'actually', 'Rock', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'insightful', 'up', 'being', 'unwilling', 'settle', 'tone', 'would', 'allow', 'film', 'chance', 'relax', 'gel', 'own', 'way', 'missing', 'pieces', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', 'enjoyable', 'human', 'flick', 'that', 'adults', 'decisions', 'are', 'ours', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'anyone', 'even', 'spouses', 'spouses', 'other', 'people', 'what', 'decide', 'do', 'lives']",N/A

1079219,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B000R5OFNG,Justin G.,"[5, 6]","Wow, there's not a lot of love here for Chris Rock's latest film ""I Think I Love My Wife"", which is surprising considering just how much the movie has going for it. The basic story focuses on Richard Cooper (Rock), a devoted family man whose marriage has lost all passion. An old crush resurfaces to lead Richard into the proverbial valley of temptation, though how well she succeeds is a spoiler I'm not going to give away.Rock, along with fellow comedian Louis C.K., adapted the main story from the French film ""Chloe in the Afternoon"", adding their own signature brand of humor, which, like Rock's comedy specials, is laced with profanity and racial humor. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who has seen the show ""Everybody Hates Chris"", but I was still impressed at how well Rock blended the emotional with the absurd. This isn't a chick flick by any means, but it's more than just another comedy-by-numbers.Aside from Richard's wife, who comes off as a bit too two-dimensional, the characters are complex and compelling. Rock's character is the best example. You can totally sympathize with his predicament while at the same time cringing at the choices he makes. Even when he's making a decision that he knows is wrong, you can still understand how that particular guy in that particular situation could make that choice. By the end of the movie even Nikki (the other woman) becomes more than just a free-spirited temptress. You never really feel for her, but you at least come to accept that despite her utter disregard for the consequences of her actions, she's really not trying to hurt anyone.Rock's performance is fantastic, and shows that he can handle a (mostly) serious role just as well as a full-on comedic role. Kerry Washington plays Nikki perfectly, and while Brenda (the wife) wasn't fully developed as a character, Gina Torres did a great job with what she had to work with. Steve Buscemi was great as Richard's boss, but he's pretty much great in everything (with the possible exception of Airheads).I Think I Love My Wife is part comedy and part cautionary tale. I laughed and cringed in equal amounts, and more than a few times found myself saying ""Don't do it, man!"" out loud. The ending was too cheesy/borderline absurd for my taste, but overall I was quite pleased with this movie. Hopefully this will not be the last time we see Chris Rock in the director's chair.DVD Extras: The DVD features the standard bonus material, including some deleted scenes, audio commentary, documentary footage, and an all too brief blooper reel.",4,Great example of what Chris Rock brings to a movie,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,2570,"['Wow', 'not', 'lot', 'love', 'here', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'latest', 'film', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', 'surprising', 'considering', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'going', 'basic', 'story', 'focuses', 'Richard', 'Cooper', 'Rock', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'marriage', 'lost', 'passion', 'old', 'crush', 'resurfaces', 'lead', 'Richard', 'proverbial', 'valley', 'temptation', 'how', 'well', 'spoiler', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away.Rock', 'fellow', 'comedian', 'Louis', 'C.K.', 'adapted', 'main', 'story', 'French', 'film', 'Chloe', 'Afternoon', 'adding', 'own', 'signature', 'brand', 'humor', 'Rock', 'comedy', 'specials', 'laced', 'profanity', 'racial', 'humor', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'as', 'much', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'show', 'Everybody', 'Chris', 'was', 'still', 'impressed', 'how', 'well', 'Rock', 'blended', 'emotional', 'absurd', ""n't"", 'chick', 'flick', 'means', 'more', 'just', 'comedy-by-numbers.Aside', 'Richard', 'wife', 'who', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'two-dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'complex', 'compelling', 'Rock', 'character', 'best', 'example', 'can', 'totally', 'sympathize', 'predicament', 'same', 'time', 'cringing', 'choices', 'Even', 'when', 'making', 'decision', 'wrong', 'can', 'still', 'understand', 'how', 'particular', 'guy', 'particular', 'situation', 'could', 'make', 'choice', 'end', 'movie', 'even', 'Nikki', 'other', 'woman', 'more', 'just', 'free-spirited', 'temptress', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'least', 'come', 'accept', 'utter', 'disregard', 'consequences', 'actions', 'really', 'not', 'trying', 'hurt', 'anyone.Rock', 'performance', 'fantastic', 'can', 'handle', 'mostly', 'serious', 'role', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'full-on', 'comedic', 'role', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Nikki', 'perfectly', 'Brenda', 'wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'was', 'great', 'Richard', 'boss', 'pretty', 'much', 'great', 'everything', 'possible', 'exception', 'Airheads', '.I', 'Think', 'Love', 'Wife', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'laughed', 'cringed', 'equal', 'amounts', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'found', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'man', 'out', 'loud', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'cheesy/borderline', 'absurd', 'taste', 'overall', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'see', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'director', 'chair.DVD', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'standard', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'documentary', 'footage', 'too', 'brief', 'blooper', 'reel']",N/A

I think that if the title was narrowed down to something a bit shorter that wouldn't take the complete DVD cover when translated into German might've been a better idea. A title centered on Kerry Washington, who plays Nikki -- the goddess/seductress and menace/heroine in Richard's (Chris Rock) boring life. How about Lingerie Wars or Tempted by Lust? Better yet: Maneater. That'll get people to see the movie, not Chris Rock. And that's just too bad, because C. Rock did a great job with this movie. I don't know if people are wary of his stand-up language, but the language is definitely not at the same level in this movie. While I didn't laugh hysterically throughout, I thought Chris nailed the role of a bored and frustrated husband with children, where he didn't appreciate what he really had -- a beautiful family. The temptations of a successful businessman (key word man) with the ultimate chick magnet (a wedding ring). I also thought this film nailed the direction a man's mind goes when he sees a beautiful woman. But it's not just the sexual tension, it's the boredom: Nikki is fun! Is he going to go for it? Is the grass greener on the other side, or is it even being watered? If you're married, divorced, or plan to be married...watch this movie.

Very few things will make you feel like you're on the top of the world then having a wife and kids to take care of.  The problem with marriage is that at one point it's going to get old, and you'll wake up one morning and wonder if you made the right choice or not.  This is the situation Richard Cooper (Chris Rock) finds himself in at the beginning of ""I Think I Love My Wife.""  He opens the movie describing the great life he has.  He has a beautiful wife, two wonderful kids, and a job that pays well.  There's just one problem: He's bored out of his %&#^!^@ mind!  He and his wife, Brenda (Gina Torres), used to have sex all the time.  Nowadays though there is always an excuse to not have sex.  Either it's not his birthday, she doesn't feel like it, or her face hurts.Whatever the reason is, the two aren't as romantically involved as Richard would like them to be, and with so much temptation in the world, Richard is finding it hard to stay faithful.  I know the feeling, seeing as how I used to have a dog that used to love to play, but once he got older my goldfish was becoming far more interesting then he was.  Richard's life gets a little bit of a jolt when an old flame of his, Nikki Tru (Kerry Washington), comes into his office asking for a favor.  The two then begin a non-sexual affair where she is obviously flirting with him, and he feels guilty about spending time with her, but he has to admit that he's having some fun again.  His co-workers are worried about Richard though.  Not only does he cost the company a multi-million dollar deal, but they fear he will destroy his marriage if he keeps going on like this.Richard's friend George (Steve Buscemi) warns him that ""[Nikki] is nothing but trouble.""  When Richard points out that George has had multiple affairs with other women, George responds ""I can have an affair and sleep like a baby.  You on the other hand have morals.""  Yes, despite the fact that Richard goes through an entire movie checking out other women, he is likable.  In one of the funniest scenes in the movie, Richard takes his wife out to dinner with a couple of their friends to get away from the temptation of Nikki.  When his waitress proves to be showing some heavy cleavage, Richard tells the manager of the restaurant ""Is this a Hooters?  Because if it is, then I think you owe me some buffalo wings.""Chris Rock, who seems to be reaching a turning point in his own life, seems to be letting go of some of his own real life frustrations in this movie.  He not only wrote a good portion of the movie, but he also directs the movie.  In the movie itself, he is the narrator as well as protagonist.  It's not a perfect film.  There are several scenes that feel weirdly out of place.  An argument Richard has with his wife about eating chicken every night comes off as unrealistic, and regardless of the circumstance that lead up to that fight, I doubt the wife would have taken the argument as seriously as she did.  A scene involving a viragra pill that goes screwy is certainly funny, but again, feels rather forced in the actual movie.What the movie does have in it's favor is a likable lead character who loves his wife but is frustrated with his marriage.  He doesn't always make the best choices in the movie, but I think what's important is that he makes the right choices when the time comes.  There is some social commentary about how women go out of their way to make themselves look sexy, and how it can be frustrating for a man going through a marriage crisis to walk the streets and have to look at all these women, most of which who walk around half naked.  ""I Think I Love My Wife"" is going to make you laugh a lot, but it will also make you look at your own life and what you feel is really important to you.  After a string of bad movies it's nice to see Chris Rock revive his movie career in a very interesting way.

So why is the film so under-appreciated? Expectations. The problem with Chris Rock is he's the best stand-up comedian working today. He has honed his craft to appeal to almost everyone. So no two audience members will see him in the same light. This works well in stand up. The imagination is fully engaged to assist every callback, and one liner that Rock acts out. Our minds literally re-create Rock in our own image. But it's harder to achieve onscreen.However one might interpret Rock's material onstage is over ruled by the visual images in the movie. One person sees him as a defjam comedian and expects an extension of that in the theatre. Another sees a more politically astute persona and anticipates that to play out onscreen. And someone else figures he will be an edgier Bill Cosby type.This movie contradicts all those expectations. It certainly includes elements of Rock's stand-up, but it's not bound by them. Rather, Rock has made a film for adults about adult relationships! In reality, marriage gets boring. Family life gets to be monotonous and sexy women are always a temptation. Chris Rock, nevertheless, did a commendable job of reminding us of the big picture. If you watch this film with an open mind, you will enjoy it.

""I Think I Love My Wife"" is a ridiculously incongruous take on the French classic ""Chloe in the Afternoon"" and attempts to delve into subjects such as love and temptation, but fails miserably at nearly everything it sets out to achieve. A laugh-less comedy, an unmoving drama, and a ragtag assemblage of pathetic dialogue fused with feeble characters, ""I Think I Love My Wife"" is an absolute wreck in every conceivable way.Richard Cooper (Chris Rock) is married and has two adorable children. But he is bored with his generic family life and senselessly deprived of sex with his wife Brenda (Gina Torres). Despite a bank job that he enjoys, and meaningless sessions with an unmarried marriage councilor, he can't help but ogle every attractive woman he passes. When an old friend, Nikki, (Kerry Washington) shows up to his office one day, looking absolutely gorgeous and making not-so-subtle passes at him, he must decide whether a passionate affair might solve some of his problems or increase them tenfold...after all, he does love his wife...or so he thinks.Dealing with interesting topics of promiscuity, desire, true love and temptation, ""I Think I Love My Wife"" somehow failed to evoke any emotion, relation or even pity-laughs from the audience. Loosely based on Eric Rohmer's ""Chloe in the Afternoon"", this new adaptation is a despicable jumble of genres, none decidedly prominent. At first it feels as though with his exclusive creative control, Chris Rock, who writes, produces and directs, will sculpt the film into a showcase for his offbeat and loudmouthed standup comedy routines, but this is quickly superseded by scene after scene of uninspiring drama. What would normally play out as a form of dramedy is overly pocked by soap opera antics and asinine scenarios. While most of it is all done in the hopes of stirring up a few laughs, the humor is blas&eacute; and alternates between bland standup one-liners and arid TV sitcom situations.It's a little misleading to see the likes of Chris Rock in a film like this. From the trailers and the familiarity of his style of comedy, I would have figured this film to be a no-holds barred comedy riot. And frankly that's all I want to see him in. When Jim Carrey and Robin Williams crossed into the realm of serious acting, I couldn't imagine appreciating their roles and most of them failed to be successful. Similarly with Rock, I really only want to watch him do what he does best; and that certainly isn't directing a classic drama rehash. Could anyone else have pulled off an ambitious attempt like this? Maybe not, but poor Rock makes his attempt look premature, ill-planned and disastrous.At several points throughout the film the plot drags and feels like it is avidly driving down the road to nowhere. This was one of the longest 90 minute films I have ever seen. So many scenes and characters felt out of place; the only noteworthy performance was that of Steve Buscemi. One of the most popular character actors of our time, Buscemi has popped up in countless films and is always recognizable, unique and memorable. Most of his characters are offbeat and bizarre, but always appealing. Almost no other characters are present for comedy relief, which was greatly lacking in a film with such a humorless premise and lead characters who couldn't squeeze any laughter from the viewers. When the conclusion involves breaking out into farcical lip syncing to a familiar song, you'll have wished you walked out an hour earlier.It's funny that only a few years ago Chris Rock heckled Jude Law at the Oscars for making too many movies. With this film it appears Rock has made one too many. Unworthy tributes, ill-conceived gags, and confusingly juxtaposed genres force ""I Think I Love My Wife"" to play out like a mid-life crisis that will strain the fragile threads of audiences' attention spans and decency meters, while simultaneously urging the contemplation ""I Think I Should Walk Out Of This Movie.""
