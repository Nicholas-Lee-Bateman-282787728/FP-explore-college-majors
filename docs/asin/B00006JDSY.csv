717722,A1LH7YTNTWP6MT,B00006JDSY,Andrew Furst,"[5, 7]","I actually thought the sound and picture quality were fine on this DVD, no complaints from me there.  But I was disappointed in the performance, in that instrument-wise the songs are mostly performed by unknown outside musicians, rather than the Monkees themselves.  Actually Peter really does play a variety of instruments here (and quite well), but otherwise it's mainly a Monkee sing-along to the sounds of a large generic backup band.  There is one song where Micky plays the drums - ironically it's one written by Mike (the only missing Monkee at this show), ""Mary, Mary"".  And Micky's drumming is great on that song, for me it's one of the highlights of this DVD.  I'd have loved to have Micky playing drums on all or most of the songs here, rather than just the one.  Also the band is too big with all the outsiders, turning the traditional crisp Monkee sound into more of a ""Las Vegas style"" revue.I realize that on most of the Monkees albums, the Monkees just sang and outside musicians did the instrumentation.  So in putting on a show like this, the Monkees may have felt they were performing in similar fashion to the albums.  However, my favorite Monkees album is ""Headquarters"", and there the Monkees themselves play virtually all the instruments, sounding great.  Also, when the four Monkees performed live together in 1997 in the UK, they showed that they sound fine with only the four of them (there they did about 1/2 of their songs with just the 4 Monkees, the other 1/2 with the aid of backup musicians).  In fact, I prefer the more ""spare"" sound they get with just the four alone, than the bloated sound they have with the big band of slick professionals.  It's more of a clean, crisp, jangly ""Monkees"" sound, very much like the albums they put out in the 60's.  So other than Peter's instrumental role, and Micky drumming on one song, this DVD is more like a ""tribute to the Monkees"" than the real thing, even though it's obviously the real Monkees singing.  Would have been so great to have the original 4 Monkees (only) on this DVD, but if Mike wasn't going to be here then I'd rather have Micky on drums, Peter on bass/guitar/keyboards, Davy on tambourine/acoustic guitar/keyboards(?), and just one more musician to fill in for the absent Mike.As to the Monkees singing here...it's ok.  They can do better.  Peter again does really well with his vocal role; he doesn't have the voice of Micky or Davy, but he's very much up to the task here and gives fans a good show.  But Micky, who's a truly great rock/pop singer, basically walks through this show without the passion we know he can give.  Very disappointing there, and very different from some of his other live performances.  Ok he does well on some songs, so you do get something there. As for Davy, his voice is fine, though he seems to be trying too hard to be ""cool"" or something.  He even does some lame dancing on a song or two (just be yourself Davy, no need to dance).So on this DVD you mainly get the Monkees singing in front of an overly large, overly slick backup band, ""Las Vegas revue"" style.  That may appeal to some people, but it's not what I wanted.  However, you do get to hear Peter playing on most of the songs, and Micky drumming on one song, a little bit of tambourine and guitar from Davy, so for those portions this DVD was enjoyable to me, along with most but not all of the singing.  Whether that's worth the asking price is up to the individual fan, but again this could have been so much better.  Maybe some day the 4 will re-unite for one more show, do it right, and put it on film.  Meantime there's this, inadequate though it may be for fans like myself.",3,"Not enough Monkees, too many outsiders",1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,3666,"['actually', 'thought', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'were', 'fine', 'DVD', 'complaints', 'was', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'instrument-wise', 'songs', 'are', 'mostly', 'performed', 'unknown', 'outside', 'musicians', 'rather', 'Monkees', 'Actually', 'Peter', 'really', 'play', 'variety', 'instruments', 'here', 'quite', 'well', 'otherwise', 'mainly', 'Monkee', 'sing-along', 'sounds', 'large', 'generic', 'backup', 'band', 'one', 'song', 'where', 'Micky', 'drums', 'ironically', 'one', 'written', 'Mike', 'only', 'missing', 'Monkee', 'show', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'Micky', 'drumming', 'great', 'song', 'one', 'highlights', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'Micky', 'playing', 'drums', 'most', 'songs', 'here', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'Also', 'band', 'too', 'big', 'outsiders', 'turning', 'traditional', 'crisp', 'Monkee', 'sound', 'more', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'style', 'revue.I', 'realize', 'most', 'Monkees', 'albums', 'Monkees', 'just', 'sang', 'outside', 'musicians', 'did', 'instrumentation', 'So', 'putting', 'show', 'Monkees', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'were', 'performing', 'similar', 'fashion', 'albums', 'However', 'favorite', 'Monkees', 'album', 'Headquarters', 'there', 'Monkees', 'play', 'virtually', 'instruments', 'sounding', 'great', 'Also', 'when', 'four', 'Monkees', 'performed', 'live', 'together', '1997', 'UK', 'showed', 'sound', 'fine', 'only', 'four', 'did', '1/2', 'songs', 'just', '4', 'Monkees', 'other', '1/2', 'aid', 'backup', 'musicians', 'fact', 'prefer', 'more', 'spare', 'sound', 'get', 'just', 'four', 'alone', 'bloated', 'sound', 'have', 'big', 'band', 'slick', 'professionals', 'more', 'clean', 'crisp', 'jangly', 'Monkees', 'sound', 'very', 'much', 'albums', 'put', 'out', '60', 'other', 'Peter', 'instrumental', 'role', 'Micky', 'drumming', 'one', 'song', 'DVD', 'more', 'tribute', 'Monkees', 'real', 'thing', 'even', 'obviously', 'real', 'Monkees', 'singing', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'great', 'have', 'original', '4', 'Monkees', 'only', 'DVD', 'Mike', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'here', 'then', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'Micky', 'drums', 'Peter', 'bass/guitar/keyboards', 'Davy', 'tambourine/acoustic', 'guitar/keyboards', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'musician', 'fill', 'absent', 'Mike.As', 'Monkees', 'singing', 'here', 'ok', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'Peter', 'again', 'really', 'well', 'vocal', 'role', ""n't"", 'have', 'voice', 'Micky', 'Davy', 'very', 'much', 'task', 'here', 'fans', 'good', 'show', 'Micky', 'who', 'truly', 'great', 'rock/pop', 'singer', 'basically', 'show', 'passion', 'know', 'can', 'give', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'there', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'live', 'performances', 'well', 'songs', 'do', 'get', 'something', 'there', 'Davy', 'voice', 'fine', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'something', 'even', 'lame', 'dancing', 'song', 'two', 'just', 'be', 'Davy', 'need', 'dance', '.So', 'DVD', 'mainly', 'get', 'Monkees', 'singing', 'front', 'overly', 'large', 'overly', 'slick', 'backup', 'band', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'revue', 'style', 'may', 'appeal', 'people', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'However', 'do', 'get', 'hear', 'Peter', 'playing', 'most', 'songs', 'Micky', 'drumming', 'one', 'song', 'little', 'bit', 'tambourine', 'guitar', 'Davy', 'so', 'portions', 'DVD', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'most', 'not', 'singing', 'asking', 'price', 'individual', 'fan', 'again', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Maybe', 'day', '4', 'will', 're-unite', 'one', 'more', 'show', 'do', 'right', 'put', 'film', 'Meantime', 'inadequate', 'may', 'be', 'fans']",N/A

They've still got that old magic! Every time I watch this concert I am almost dancing and singing along by the end.A lot of people say that Peter left the group after this concert because the Monkees fought a lot. But let me remind people that the Monkees would not have lasted so long if they didn't argue, or have big egos, or whatever. The Monkees started out as a television show back in the 1960s, but not your standard t.v. show. By the end of the first season the Monkees had used their arguing abilities and large egos to take over everything. Like sailors on a ship that threw the captain over board. By the second season they were writing episodes, directing episodes, writing and recording the soundtrack, and so forth. They had knocked hollywood for a loop! Now, other actors from other shows have protested, but only for more money. The Monkees just wanted to perfect their craft and inhance their art, they never really made very much from the show itself. So what if Peter yelled at Davy, or Davy yelled at Mike, who cares? They've given us forty years, and beyond, of great comedy and music!The Beatles were successful because they were edgy but still had a great sense of humor. The Monkees top that, easily! In the original show, the Monkees romped around like the Beatles but lived on the beach like the Beach Boys.Beatles/Beach Boys with a little Monkee magic thrown in. What could be better?!

Watching it will bring back memories of past Monkees show for many viewers.  Filmed August 31, 2001 at the Sun Theatre in Anaheim, California, many fans know that this show has an interesting backstory.This tour date was originally scheduled for August 24th but was cancelled when Micky Dolenz came down with laryngitis.  After being rescheduled for August 31, the show was filmed and Peter Tork was let go from the group two days later.  Many speculated that Peter would've been dropped earlier if it hadn't been for the contract to have this concert filmed.  It will be hard for many Monkee fans not to think of this story as they watch this DVD.Backstory aside, the concert was nicely filmed and has good picture quality.  The camera focuses on everyone from the Monkees to the back up band, as well as the three annoying male backup dancers/musicians.All of the standard Monkees hits are featured, although this DVD appears to not include every song that was recorded that night (use the zoom button on your DVD remote and you can see a playlist on Peter's keyboard that includes songs such as &quot;No Time&quot; that aren't on the DVD).  The overal sound quality of the songs is excellent.There is some bonus interview footage with all three Monkees but the quotes they give have all been heard by fans in other interviews through the years.  There are also two songs that have been turned into Karaoke songs.  The video footage for these songs is the same as if you were watching the concert with the sound on.  The booklet doesn't offer much except for track listings and three pictures.In a nutshell, this is a nicely-done DVD.
