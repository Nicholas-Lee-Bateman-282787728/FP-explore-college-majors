The PAL version includes an small B/W documentary as well and has a more functional  menu, but the quality of the image is slightly inferior, it seems that the NTSC version was equalized for a better video, audio is the same in both, not audiophile quality, but good enough...Hope this help you guys, this s a must for any TYA fan...Here is the track list for your information:1. Love like a man2. I may be wrong (but I won't be wrong always)3. Good morning little schoolgirl4. Help me.5. Woodshoppers Ball6. Slow Blues7. Going HomeBTW Stephen, the review section is not a place to ask questions, and even less rate a top notch concert with one star, which is not accurate at all from your side. If you are interested in knowing what is written on the artwork, or what songs are included, quality of the video, etc...Just an email to any of the sellers may give you far better results, or simply Goggle it...",5,Top notch concert!!!,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,1030,"['Alvin', 'Lee', 'best', 'same', 'concert', 'known', 'Live', 'Marquee', 'was', 'released', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'VHS', 'PAL', 'version', 'small', 'B/W', 'documentary', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'functional', 'menu', 'quality', 'image', 'slightly', 'inferior', 'NTSC', 'version', 'was', 'equalized', 'better', 'video', 'audio', 'same', 'not', 'audiophile', 'quality', 'good', 'enough', 'Hope', 'help', 'guys', 'must', 'TYA', 'fan', 'Here', 'track', 'list', 'information:1', 'Love', 'man2', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'wrong', 'always', '3', 'Good', 'morning', 'little', 'schoolgirl4', 'Help', 'me.5', 'Woodshoppers', 'Ball6', 'Slow', 'Blues7', 'Going', 'HomeBTW', 'Stephen', 'review', 'section', 'not', 'place', 'ask', 'questions', 'even', 'less', 'rate', 'top', 'notch', 'concert', 'one', 'star', 'not', 'accurate', 'side', 'are', 'interested', 'knowing', 'what', 'written', 'artwork', 'what', 'songs', 'are', 'included', 'quality', 'video', 'etc', 'Just', 'email', 'sellers', 'may', 'give', 'far', 'better', 'results', 'simply', 'Goggle']",N/A

Garaguso ""progressive sounds""","[9, 9]","For what little footage there is available on the original Ten Years After, (the great Woodstock performance and the shameful footage at the Isle of Wight festival), this is defnitely enjoyable to watch.  While it's certainly not Alvin during his heyday of the late 60's and early 70's, Alvin and the band still rocked out.  Though at times Alvin appeared tired and bored to me, being a TYA fan since 1969 it was still a genuine thrill to see them perform in a small club setting doing their classic hits from the old days.  It's a real tragic shame that Alvin and the rest of the original band members must be struggling with some type of falling out, as Ten Years After did not have any music from their legendary set at Woodstock included in the newly released 6 disc Woodstock box set due to licensing restrictions.  The only other 2 also not included were The Band and The Keef Hartley Band.  It would have been awesome to have something other than ""Going Home"" from their Woodstock set.",4,Great DVD,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,992,"['what', 'little', 'footage', 'available', 'original', 'Ten', 'Years', 'great', 'Woodstock', 'performance', 'shameful', 'footage', 'Isle', 'Wight', 'festival', 'defnitely', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'certainly', 'not', 'Alvin', 'heyday', 'late', '60', 'early', '70', 'Alvin', 'band', 'still', 'rocked', 'out', 'times', 'Alvin', 'appeared', 'tired', 'bored', 'being', 'TYA', 'fan', '1969', 'was', 'still', 'genuine', 'thrill', 'see', 'perform', 'small', 'club', 'setting', 'doing', 'classic', 'hits', 'old', 'days', 'real', 'tragic', 'shame', 'Alvin', 'rest', 'original', 'band', 'members', 'must', 'be', 'struggling', 'type', 'falling', 'out', 'Ten', 'Years', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'music', 'legendary', 'set', 'Woodstock', 'included', 'newly', 'released', '6', 'disc', 'Woodstock', 'box', 'set', 'due', 'licensing', 'restrictions', 'only', 'other', '2', 'also', 'not', 'included', 'were', 'Band', 'Keef', 'Hartley', 'Band', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awesome', 'have', 'something', 'other', 'Going', 'Home', 'Woodstock', 'set']",N/A
