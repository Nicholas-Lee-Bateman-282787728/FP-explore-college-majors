1334619,A1UL0FO9AGP4LS,B003A0T8BO,"Daniel Putkowski ""novelist, pilot, world trav...","[0, 0]","Paola Mendoza gives us a hard look at the immigrant story, one told from her personal perspective. Her character arrives in New York City after following her husband to various cities in Colombia, her native land. Soon enough, he departs and disappears, leaving her with two young children, no money, and soon no place to live. This is a story we've seen before. However, what puts this one above the rest is Mendoza's acting. She gives the sincerity without becoming maudlin. She survives, learns, and to some extent prospers, albeit in a smile while. The direction is not flashy. It hones in on the characters, especially the young boy who manages to retain his dignity throughout the hard times. Life is never easy for people like these characters, however, Mendoza shows us how they make the best and most of what they have, especially their love.

The movie made us more aware than ever of what might be contributing circumstances of the people we see on the streets.  Our thanks to the movie makers who did this with an apparent grief and not an accusing stance.

1334622,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003A0T8BO,Haunted Flower,"[4, 4]","1 Disc Widescreen, released July 20, 2010""Entre Nos"" is based on a true story in which Paola Mendoza makes her amazing debut as writer/director/star of this film with the help of writer/director Gloria La Morte. Mariana has to find ways to provide for her family of two young children, Gabriel played by Sebastian Villada Lopez and Andrea played by Laura Montana Cortez after their father abandons them after they immigrate from Colombia to the U.S. where she barely speaks the language.Years earlier, Mariana's husband immigrated to New York and she rejoins him with the kids to reunite the family. Two weeks later, he announces he is taking a new job in Miami and move there alone for a few months sending them money and then return. After a while, she figures out he will not be coming back and with rent due has to find a way to fend for herself and the children in a strange country starting with making empanadas and later collecting cans.Mendoza's struggle and emotional endurance in this film is masterful. The two children are endearing and very honest in their characters. They try their best to help their mother but also need to have fun once in a while in order to keep the balance since they work all the time. This is a very well-done film that is inspiring to see what a person can accomplish when their back is to the wall.Mendoza and fellow writer Gloria La Morte flawlessly capture the desperation of the family's situation, but even more importantly their closeness, desire to be together, and love for each other that manages to keep their spirits up even in the darkest of times. One of the saddest moments for me was Mariana's daughter, Andrea turning to her and saying ""You're not funny anymore"" and the dawning realization on Mariana's face that she quickly turned into a tickle fight challenge to ease Andrea's worries. Small moments like that abound in this film which consequently break your heart and warm it at the same time.If you enjoyed Will Smith's journey in ""The Pursuit of Happyness "", you'll want to check this out because this is another case of everything being taken away gradually and trying to keep your family alive and together and rising to the occasion. Most of it is in Spanish with English subtitles.Bonus Features:There is commentary by Paola Mendoza who is the director, writer, and star of the film so she gives insight on all angles of the process one rarely gets in a commentary track. What is most amazing about this film is that it is actually Paola's mother's journey and she WAS the character of Andrea making this very personal for her.Behind the Scenes actually gives a great inside look at the open call auditions, discussions with casting directors, and character directions that you don't see every day. She spent a lot of time playing with the children and getting more comfortable together so they would be loose enough for acting and did a lot in the rehearsal process. The production was made in about twenty days.""How to make Empanadas"" is a cute little extra on the disc revealing that Paola Mendoza does not actually know how to cook and needs the help of director/writer Gloria La Morte as Master Chef to learn how to actually make these. If you have trouble following the process, the recipe is also available on their website. There is a PSA on Immigration Reform and it's easy to see why this movie ended up on Michael Moore's 20 ""Best Pictures"" of 2009 and the receipient of an Honorable Mention at the Tribeca Film Festival. If you enjoy Mendoza's work, another great extra is her short film ""Still Standing"" also on this disc.",5,"A beautiful, emotional journey of one woman's fight for her family's survival in the face of our immigration hurtles",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3603,"['1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'released', 'July', '20', '2010', 'Entre', 'Nos', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Paola', 'Mendoza', 'amazing', 'debut', 'writer/director/star', 'film', 'help', 'writer/director', 'Gloria', 'La', 'Morte', 'Mariana', 'find', 'ways', 'provide', 'family', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'Gabriel', 'played', 'Sebastian', 'Villada', 'Lopez', 'Andrea', 'played', 'Laura', 'Montana', 'Cortez', 'father', 'abandons', 'immigrate', 'Colombia', 'U.S.', 'where', 'barely', 'language.Years', 'earlier', 'Mariana', 'husband', 'immigrated', 'New', 'York', 'kids', 'reunite', 'family', 'Two', 'weeks', 'later', 'taking', 'new', 'job', 'Miami', 'move', 'there', 'alone', 'few', 'months', 'sending', 'money', 'then', 'return', 'while', 'out', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'rent', 'due', 'find', 'way', 'fend', 'children', 'strange', 'country', 'starting', 'making', 'empanadas', 'later', 'collecting', 'cans.Mendoza', 'struggle', 'emotional', 'endurance', 'film', 'masterful', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'endearing', 'very', 'honest', 'characters', 'try', 'best', 'help', 'mother', 'also', 'need', 'have', 'fun', 'once', 'while', 'order', 'keep', 'balance', 'work', 'time', 'very', 'well-done', 'film', 'inspiring', 'see', 'what', 'person', 'can', 'accomplish', 'when', 'back', 'wall.Mendoza', 'fellow', 'writer', 'Gloria', 'La', 'Morte', 'flawlessly', 'desperation', 'family', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'closeness', 'desire', 'be', 'together', 'love', 'other', 'keep', 'spirits', 'up', 'even', 'darkest', 'times', 'One', 'saddest', 'moments', 'was', 'Mariana', 'daughter', 'Andrea', 'turning', 'saying', ""'re"", 'not', 'funny', 'anymore', 'dawning', 'realization', 'Mariana', 'face', 'quickly', 'turned', 'tickle', 'fight', 'challenge', 'ease', 'Andrea', 'worries', 'Small', 'moments', 'abound', 'film', 'consequently', 'break', 'heart', 'warm', 'same', 'time.If', 'enjoyed', 'Will', 'Smith', 'journey', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', ""'ll"", 'want', 'check', 'out', 'case', 'everything', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'gradually', 'trying', 'keep', 'family', 'alive', 'together', 'rising', 'occasion', 'Most', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles.Bonus', 'Features', 'commentary', 'Paola', 'Mendoza', 'who', 'director', 'writer', 'star', 'film', 'insight', 'angles', 'process', 'one', 'rarely', 'commentary', 'track', 'What', 'most', 'amazing', 'film', 'actually', 'Paola', 'mother', 'journey', 'WAS', 'character', 'Andrea', 'making', 'very', 'personal', 'Scenes', 'actually', 'great', 'inside', 'look', 'open', 'call', 'auditions', 'discussions', 'casting', 'directors', 'character', 'directions', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'day', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'playing', 'children', 'getting', 'more', 'comfortable', 'together', 'would', 'be', 'loose', 'enough', 'acting', 'did', 'lot', 'rehearsal', 'process', 'production', 'was', 'made', 'twenty', 'days', 'How', 'make', 'Empanadas', 'cute', 'little', 'extra', 'disc', 'revealing', 'Paola', 'Mendoza', 'not', 'actually', 'know', 'how', 'cook', 'help', 'director/writer', 'Gloria', 'La', 'Morte', 'Master', 'Chef', 'learn', 'how', 'actually', 'make', 'have', 'trouble', 'following', 'process', 'recipe', 'also', 'available', 'website', 'PSA', 'Immigration', 'Reform', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'Michael', 'Moore', '20', 'Best', 'Pictures', '2009', 'receipient', 'Honorable', 'Mention', 'Tribeca', 'Film', 'Festival', 'enjoy', 'Mendoza', 'work', 'great', 'extra', 'short', 'film', 'Still', 'Standing', 'also', 'disc']",Entre Nos

It is the story of a young mother and her two children surviving their first summer in the USA after her husband abandons them. The movie is a lesson on solidarity as the two children cooperate with their mother even tough they are still very young. It is also a lesson in parenting as the mother never loses her mind or charges on her children as most stressed out parents do. The unconditional love among the three of them is a constant, the stability of this story. It is a movie with a happy ending because they managed to survive anyway, against all odds.
