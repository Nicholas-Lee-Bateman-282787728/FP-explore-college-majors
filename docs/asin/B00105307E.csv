I don't know if my daughter was simply craving new episodes, but the DVD arrived yesterday.  I played it for her and then it was bedtime.  The end... ha!  I found out that her big sister found her awake this  morning at 6am and turned on her tv (with this DVD, and put it on) and when I did not hear from my daughter by 10am I decided to go wake up the sleepy head.  And there she was, in her ""Diego coma"" laying in bed still.  Happy as could be, did not want to come downstairs --- just wanted to stay there and watch Diego.  So, while I've only half heartedly watched it once, I'll give it five stars from my devoted Diego fan.",5,My 2 year old LOVES this new video,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,686,"['child', 'Diego', 'think', 'must-have', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'daughter', 'was', 'simply', 'craving', 'new', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'arrived', 'yesterday', 'played', 'then', 'was', 'bedtime', 'end', 'ha', 'found', 'out', 'big', 'sister', 'found', 'awake', 'morning', '6am', 'turned', 'tv', 'DVD', 'put', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'daughter', '10am', 'decided', 'go', 'wake', 'up', 'sleepy', 'head', 'was', 'Diego', 'coma', 'laying', 'bed', 'still', 'Happy', 'could', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'come', 'downstairs', 'just', 'wanted', 'stay', 'there', 'watch', 'Diego', 'So', ""'ve"", 'only', 'half', 'heartedly', 'watched', 'once', ""'ll"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'devoted', 'Diego', 'fan']",N/A
