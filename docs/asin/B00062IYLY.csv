857213,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B00062IYLY,Amanda Pike,"[1, 1]","I was watching the Dracula the series DVD set and I realized there is a pretty big mistake and this mistake dates back to the series' original air dates.The final episode of the series is Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.  This ends with the semi-cliff hanger of Gustav Helsing following Lucard (Dracula) and Klaus through a portal in Dracula's castle.  And the boys Christopher and Max preparing to return to America with all of Gustav's notes.  Yet someone made the mistake of airing the episode My Dinner with Lucard after Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind.My Dinner with Lucard is a clips episode of all the previous episodes (leading up to Klaus Encounters of the Interned Kind) and turned out to be a dream of Gustav Helsing.  This is clearly set BEFORE he followed Lucard through the portal.  I do not know why it was aired in the wrong order or why the DVD set maintains this misorder.Otherwise it's a great DVD set of a fun TV series in the vein (if you pardon the pun) of shows like Goosebumps.  The show focuses on the adventures of sixteen-year-old Christopher Townsend and his ten-year-old brother Max Townsend.  They take up residence with their Uncle Gustav Helsing who lives with a local student, Sophie.  Chris and Max soon learn that their uncle is actually a vampire hunter from a long line of vampire hunters and their biggest thread is Alexander Lucard, a highly successful and corrupt corporate mogul (sort of like David Xanatos of Gargoyles) who turns out to be Dracula himself.  It's a fun show but jut be wary of the mistake in the episode order.",3,Fun show but episodes are in the wrong order,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,1580,"['was', 'watching', 'Dracula', 'series', 'DVD', 'set', 'realized', 'pretty', 'big', 'mistake', 'mistake', 'back', 'series', 'original', 'air', 'dates.The', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'Klaus', 'Encounters', 'Interned', 'Kind', 'semi-cliff', 'hanger', 'Gustav', 'Helsing', 'following', 'Lucard', 'Dracula', 'Klaus', 'portal', 'Dracula', 'castle', 'boys', 'Christopher', 'Max', 'preparing', 'return', 'America', 'Gustav', 'notes', 'someone', 'made', 'mistake', 'airing', 'episode', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Lucard', 'Klaus', 'Encounters', 'Interned', 'Kind.My', 'Dinner', 'Lucard', 'clips', 'episode', 'previous', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'Klaus', 'Encounters', 'Interned', 'Kind', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'dream', 'Gustav', 'Helsing', 'clearly', 'set', 'followed', 'Lucard', 'portal', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'aired', 'wrong', 'order', 'why', 'DVD', 'set', 'misorder.Otherwise', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'fun', 'TV', 'series', 'vein', 'pardon', 'pun', 'shows', 'Goosebumps', 'show', 'adventures', 'sixteen-year-old', 'Christopher', 'Townsend', 'ten-year-old', 'brother', 'Max', 'Townsend', 'take', 'up', 'residence', 'Uncle', 'Gustav', 'Helsing', 'who', 'local', 'student', 'Sophie', 'Chris', 'Max', 'soon', 'learn', 'uncle', 'actually', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'long', 'line', 'vampire', 'hunters', 'biggest', 'thread', 'Alexander', 'Lucard', 'highly', 'successful', 'corrupt', 'corporate', 'mogul', 'sort', 'David', 'Xanatos', 'Gargoyles', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Dracula', 'fun', 'show', 'jut', 'be', 'wary', 'mistake', 'episode', 'order']",Dracula: The Series
857214,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00062IYLY,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Dracula: The Series"" is an underrated Canadian masterpiece. Yes, Canada brought us theJagged Little Pill,The Best Damn Thing, andNickelback the Ultimate Video Collection DVD, but let's not forget that ""Dracula"" is excellent. ""Dracula"" is gloriously campy. Geordie Johnson stars as Dracula, the corporate raider who goes by the name Alexander Lucard. He's not an incredibly menacing vampire- he basically befriends the boy leads- it's Van Helsing who opposes him openly. The story arc about Van Helsing's nephew's relationship with Dracula is as homoerotic as later on when Sophia (Mia Kirshner, beforeThe L Word: Complete Series Pack) meets the Countess who promises her a musical career. The vampires are fabulous. Did this Canadian series pave the way forInterview with the Vampire: The Vampire ChroniclesandTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)?""Dracula: The Series"" is at its best when it has stand-alone episodes. The Van Helsing's nephew/Dracula romance is an exception. There's plenty of humor and horror!

I forgot how funny  and fun this show was, so i when to amazon and there it was. i bought a copy for myself and got it today , as many of the reviewers have stated  it  has  a decent transfer i can say that is true. but i would call it very good crystal clear with minor pixels here and there, but all and all a very good transfer for the price you pay, you get alot. the show has really held up every kid and adult with imangination can enjoy this campy fun  show. If you enjoyed the nick shows of the 90's you'll like this series. it's suitable of all ages except very young kids 7 and under the fights and bites,plus seeing the glowing eyes and fangs might give them nightmares.

Bernard Behrens, Jacob Tierney,Mia Kirshner, and Joe Roncetti, did a prettygood job, as vampire hunters, though in oneepisode, they actually accepted a dinnerinvitation, at the castle of Alexander Lucard,the same vampire, they were trying to eliminatein the other 20 episodes. I like how they usedthe name Lucard, which spells Dracul backwards.The scenery, and color in all 21 episodes, isbeautiful, the acting pretty good, and thehumor, that was added to the script, is quiterefreshing.
