It's shown on a Swedish channel immediately before ""Torchwood"" (a sci-fi series about a bisexual hit squad in Cardiff fighting aliens).""Torchwood"" is great fun watching. ""The District"" is just plain boring. The actors look bored, too. Do the United States have the most boring federal capital in the world? A couple of UFOs might do the trick, though.

I found most of them honest and really felt they came from the heart of the reviewer.  My favorite was written by CAMMY who gave just about the best review.  I, too, am an avid fan of this TV series.  I also tried to contact the airing networks and the makers of the series to no avail.  I purchased one of the bad copy deals (I wanted the series so badly).  However, if it were to come out on DVD or BLU-RAY I'd buy it in a hot minute.  The story lines were always great, the acting superb, the morals were beyond compare.  ""THE DISTRICT"" and ""COLD CASE"" are both wanted on DVD by many.  Fans, I'm sure, would all want to purchase the real thing, not pirated copies of them.  Still hoping!!",5,"""The DISTRICT"" TV series",1365292800,"04 7, 2013",2013,766,"['read', 'previous', '26', '27', 'reviews', 'THE', 'DISTRICT', '2008', '2013', 'found', 'most', 'honest', 'really', 'felt', 'came', 'heart', 'reviewer', 'favorite', 'was', 'written', 'CAMMY', 'who', 'gave', 'just', 'best', 'review', 'too', 'am', 'avid', 'fan', 'TV', 'series', 'also', 'tried', 'contact', 'airing', 'networks', 'makers', 'series', 'avail', 'purchased', 'one', 'bad', 'copy', 'deals', 'wanted', 'series', 'so', 'badly', 'However', 'were', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'BLU-RAY', ""'d"", 'buy', 'hot', 'minute', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'always', 'great', 'acting', 'superb', 'morals', 'were', 'compare', 'DISTRICT', 'COLD', 'CASE', 'are', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'many', 'Fans', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'want', 'purchase', 'real', 'thing', 'not', 'pirated', 'copies', 'Still', 'hoping']",The District

It starred among others: Craig T Nelson as a chief of police willing to shake things up to see things change for the better.  His supporting cast included the wonderful Lynne Thigpen, Jonathan La Paglia, Sean Patrick Thomas and quite a few other talented actors.Why is it in this day and age of shallow, shlock reality drivel that a show this good remains unavailable on DVD?  Many inferior offerings are available, yet this show which is worth watching again and again is not.  I think that's a shame.I hope this will be remedied soon...
