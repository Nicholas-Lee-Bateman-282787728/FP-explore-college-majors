1085942,A1CZAMELERRIKR,B000SE6VXS,"Barbra Madejczyk ""state theatre qualifier""","[1, 1]","Tell them Willie Boy is hereRobert Redford stars in a film based on historical facts, sharing billing with a young and virile Robert Blake who portrays the character of the title. It is the story of a manhunt in the American West. The time is the very beginning of the 20th century, when the culture of the United States starts to evolve toward tolerance and equality of all its citizens, and, like any birth, it is bloody and painful. The old ways have a death grip, and they won't go down without a vicious fight. Willie Boy (Blake) is a young Pauite who returns to his place of birth to claim his bride (Katharine Ross). Her family resents him, so he uses the custome of bridal capture--he kills her father and brothers and the two run away to join his relatives in another village. Redford plays the sherrif who tracks him down. The sheriff is a hard-living man, in the mold of sheriffs of the privious century. He serves out justice with his fists--and his gun if he has to. There is a woman with a PhD. in anthropology(Susan Clark) living among the Pauites. Her goal is to bring them education so they may  get off the reservation. She is beautiful. The sheriff uses her sexually. She finds she cannot refuse him, as she is as sexually hungry as he is. She is angry with him, because she cannot stop his use of her, and she is angry with herself for using such a crude man to fulfill her own needs. The sheriff forms a posse to catch Willie Boy, but early into the chase, decides to let the boy get away and returns to town, telling his posse to return in the morning. The posse acts on its own, and they are systematically and cleverly slaughtered by the young Pauite. The survivors can't believe this is the work of one lone native and word gets back to town that this is an Indian revolt. The sheriff is forced to accept the responsibility of hunting down the young lovers. What follows is an intense manhunt, where old and new ways clash as the sheriff seeks a  just ending. This is a unique role for Robert Redford, as he protrays a character with more negative than positive qualities. It is one of his earlier films, made when he was beginning to get noticed as a leading man of talent, and before any of the films that made him big box office began to limit his choices of roles. His character is brutal and selfish, and still believes in the old codes of justice. New ways of thinking are forced upon him, and in the end he finds he must bow to them to get the job done. This is a strong, realistic film, with fine acting by all involved. If you enjoy the tough, violent westerns of the late 1960's and early 1970's, you will find this movie compelling.",4,Redford As The Bad Guy . . .

The movie runs semi-slow, but, after it's over, you realize it was a worthwhile journey rather than a pure shoot 'em up, fast-paced western.  It's a real good character study, and each of the characters acts with professionalism and offers an interesting depth.  Nobody is a hero.  Redford, Blake, Susan Clark and several character actors are each very finely tuned for their parts.  Katherine Ross was exceptional as well, but, her skin color makeup was probably the biggest flaw in the entire movie.

1085945,A7Y6AVS576M03,B000SE6VXS,gobirds2,"[15, 16]","1969's  TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE is a forgotten but great film. Robert Blake is excellent as the Paiute Indian, Willie Boy, who is the object of a manhunt for a killing he committed in self-defense. The press gets hold of the story and turns it around into an Indian upraising circa 1909. President Taft is the object of the uprising on his trip out west according to the press. Robert Redford, the sheriff leading a posse knows better as he attempts to bring in Blake alive. It is a great study on misinformation by the press and racism. The direction by Abraham Polonsky methodically unfolds this simple yet powerful tale and remains captivating throughout. Conrad Hall's starkly beautiful cinematography enhances the solemn energy of this parable-like tale. Robert Redford, Robert Blake and Katharine Ross all give sincere performances. There is a strange enigmatic quality between the relationships of Blake and Ross and Blake and Redford. There is the hunter and the hunted contrasted against the loss of personal freedoms for a way of life and the loss of the very landscape unto which the story unfolds. Both Redford and Blake remain stoic characters but each manages to give a glimpse of humanity as they exude an aura of their true feelings for a way of life forever lost.

I can't get enough.""Willie Boy"" is a tightly crafted little gem revolving around an event which normally would never have raised an eyebrow.  In accordance with Paiute Indian tradition, Willie Boy takes a willing bride by capture, inadvertently killing his antagonistic father-in-law in the process.  This murder would be considered tribal business were it not for an impending Presidential visit to the territory, a news-hungry reporter with a bent to sensationalism, an iron-willed female Indian Agent with an aculturating agenda for the fugitive bride, a band of nostalgic and aging Indian killers, and a conscientious sheriff caught in the middle.The movie has a lot to say about changing and not-so-changing roles and attitudes in the culture of 1909.  It has an ending I didn't anticipate, and both the sheriff and the Indian Agent experience an awakening of awareness.Beautifully photographed and wonderfully paced, this is a true western classic.
