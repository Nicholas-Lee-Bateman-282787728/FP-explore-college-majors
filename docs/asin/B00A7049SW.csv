1606152,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00A7049SW,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","Several reviewers of HEARTBREAK LIBRARY have lamented that this film suffers from excessive slow pacing and a static plot. This is true enough but I think that in this case the pacing and static plotting are purposeful in that the director wished to parallel the external trappings of a diminished real time with the internal workings of a mind that has suffered a cruel loss and must work haltingly to regain his moral rebalancing. Lee Dong Wook is a man who goes to a library ripping out page 198 from books at random to find a message from a woman who has dumped him. Yoo Jin is a librarian who initially takes offense at what she sees as pure vandalism. Little by little she causes him to open up and she determines to help him even as she cannot help herself with her own breakup from her lover. The middle part of HEARTBREAK LIBRARY gradually reveals a growing closeness between them, but unlike most Korean romance dramas, there is no overt passion brewing. Instead she helps him as a way to help herself. Lee Dong Wook reveals himself to Yoo Jin as he does to the viewer. This film takes a daring tack in that the audience is invited to peek into the workings of a tortured mind. Not all viewers are comfortable with interacting with any lead but I found the process exhilarating. HEARTBREAK LIBRARY reminds us that the memory of pain may (or may not) lessen the grief of one's soul.",4,Sometimes Life is Meant to be Slow,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,1391,"['Several', 'reviewers', 'HEARTBREAK', 'LIBRARY', 'have', 'lamented', 'film', 'suffers', 'excessive', 'slow', 'pacing', 'static', 'plot', 'true', 'enough', 'think', 'case', 'pacing', 'static', 'plotting', 'are', 'purposeful', 'director', 'wished', 'parallel', 'external', 'trappings', 'diminished', 'real', 'time', 'internal', 'workings', 'mind', 'suffered', 'cruel', 'loss', 'must', 'work', 'haltingly', 'regain', 'moral', 'rebalancing', 'Lee', 'Dong', 'Wook', 'man', 'who', 'library', 'ripping', 'out', 'page', '198', 'books', 'random', 'find', 'message', 'woman', 'who', 'dumped', 'Yoo', 'Jin', 'librarian', 'who', 'initially', 'offense', 'what', 'pure', 'vandalism', 'Little', 'little', 'open', 'up', 'help', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'own', 'breakup', 'lover', 'middle', 'part', 'HEARTBREAK', 'LIBRARY', 'gradually', 'growing', 'closeness', 'most', 'Korean', 'romance', 'dramas', 'overt', 'passion', 'brewing', 'Instead', 'way', 'help', 'Lee', 'Dong', 'Wook', 'Yoo', 'Jin', 'viewer', 'film', 'daring', 'tack', 'audience', 'invited', 'peek', 'workings', 'tortured', 'mind', 'Not', 'viewers', 'are', 'comfortable', 'interacting', 'lead', 'found', 'process', 'exhilarating', 'HEARTBREAK', 'LIBRARY', 'memory', 'pain', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'grief', 'one', 'soul']",Heartbreak Library
