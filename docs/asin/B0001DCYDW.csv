I was happy to hear that they are making Trancers 6.  But, no Tim Thomerson?  They put him on the box cover, but he is not in this film.  They use old footage from the other movies and cut and paste.This time is Jill Deth.  Jack Deth goes ""down the line"" and into his daughter (supposed to be the daughter he had with the character Lena (played by Helen Hunt in parts 1  and 2).I wouldn't say Trancers of the past are well written, great special effects Sci Fi.  Trancers was a very solid B movie.  What made Trancers work was star of Tim Thomerson.Jill Deth character is not going to work for future movies.  What this franchise needs is the return of Tim Thomerson.  If you want to pass the torch to somebody else, you are going to have find someone who can carry it.  Not many people can.  They are out there, but this girl who played Jill Deth is not going to cut it.",1,Don't watch if you are a TRUE fan of Trancers series,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,969,"['am', 'big', 'fan', 'Trancers', 'series', 'last', 'one', 'Trancers', '5', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 'are', 'making', 'Trancers', '6', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'put', 'box', 'cover', 'not', 'film', 'use', 'old', 'footage', 'other', 'movies', 'cut', 'paste.This', 'time', 'Jill', 'Deth', 'Jack', 'Deth', 'line', 'daughter', 'supposed', 'be', 'daughter', 'had', 'character', 'Lena', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'parts', '1', '2', '.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'Trancers', 'past', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Trancers', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'B', 'movie', 'What', 'made', 'Trancers', 'work', 'was', 'star', 'Tim', 'Thomerson.Jill', 'Deth', 'character', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'future', 'movies', 'What', 'franchise', 'return', 'Tim', 'Thomerson', 'want', 'pass', 'torch', 'somebody', 'else', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'carry', 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'are', 'there', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Jill', 'Deth', 'not', 'going', 'cut']",N/A

800936,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B0001DCYDW,Paul Jutras,"[1, 1]",I have been a fan of Trancers series since the first one but when Trancers 4 was made had wish they had ended it at 3 since the alternate dimension world in Trancers 4 and 5 just felt totally out of place in this time travel series with connection between the past and future.  Trancers 6 felt like the series was getting back on track as the council up the line relocate him into his daughter Jill who needs protection from a group using a meteor's energy source to create a new breed of Trancer.  Having Jack turn into a girl isn't something is new to series since Jack's contact with his friend from 2247 in first two Trancer films was through his friend's female ancestor. Course the woman holding a gun on the DVD cover was a warning that this would be a different Trancer than we previously have had.,4,Jack is back,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,806,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Trancers', 'series', 'first', 'one', 'when', 'Trancers', '4', 'was', 'made', 'had', 'wish', 'had', 'ended', '3', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'world', 'Trancers', '4', '5', 'just', 'felt', 'totally', 'place', 'time', 'travel', 'series', 'connection', 'past', 'future', 'Trancers', '6', 'felt', 'series', 'was', 'getting', 'back', 'track', 'council', 'up', 'line', 'relocate', 'daughter', 'Jill', 'who', 'protection', 'group', 'using', 'meteor', 'energy', 'source', 'create', 'new', 'breed', 'Trancer', 'Having', 'Jack', 'turn', 'girl', ""n't"", 'something', 'new', 'series', 'Jack', 'contact', 'friend', '2247', 'first', 'two', 'Trancer', 'films', 'was', 'friend', 'female', 'ancestor', 'Course', 'woman', 'holding', 'gun', 'DVD', 'cover', 'was', 'warning', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'Trancer', 'previously', 'have', 'had']",N/A

Sullivan is convincing and enoyable in the role, but the movie fails to get five stars because, unlike the other Trancers movies, there are no other characters to care about.  The ending implies the possibility of further sequels, but, after five years, these seem unlikely.

I heard that Yvette Sullivan was cute, which does not do her justice, and I kind of like the idea of switching over from one actor to another to play the same role -- kind of like in Dr. Who.
