735681,A1A4DEENGHK51T,B000089739,Alan Attebery,"[14, 16]","When we last saw Kelly, Ozone, and Turbo, they were starring in a Broadway show called ""Street Jazz.""Fast forward an amount of time (we are never told how much time has passed) and we find that our trio has parted ways. Kelly is now an in-demand Broadway star and Ozone and Turbo are back home volunteering at their community recreation center. Once again, Kelly tires of her life and heads back to the street to see Ozone and Turbo. Eventually, the three of them put together a dance show they hope will save the community center from being demolished to make room for a new shopping center.""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"" was released just 7 months after the first movie. Unfortunately, that short time span shows in this sequel.Like the original ""Breakin'"" movie, ""Electric Boogaloo"" is full of 80s style dancing, mainly break dancing as well as poppin' and lockin'. And also like the original, this movie shines brightest when the focus is on the dancing.Unfortunately for the movie, and for us, the plot line was expanded this time around. The writing has an awkward feel to it. Every time the dancing pulls you into the movie, the lines that are uttered pull you right back out. In addition, the increased plot highlights the acting inexperience of the stars.If I was to base the rating for Breakin' 2 only on the plot, writing, and acting, it would only receive one-star. However, once again the dancing is the main star of the show. And if I was to base the rating only on the dancing, it would receive five-stars (it's really that good). So a good compromise is in order here, hence the three-star rating.",3,More Street Jazz!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,1614,"['When', 'last', 'saw', 'Kelly', 'Ozone', 'Turbo', 'were', 'starring', 'Broadway', 'show', 'called', 'Street', 'Jazz', 'Fast', 'forward', 'amount', 'time', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'find', 'trio', 'parted', 'ways', 'Kelly', 'now', 'in-demand', 'Broadway', 'star', 'Ozone', 'Turbo', 'are', 'back', 'home', 'volunteering', 'community', 'recreation', 'center', 'Once', 'again', 'Kelly', 'life', 'heads', 'back', 'street', 'see', 'Ozone', 'Turbo', 'Eventually', 'three', 'put', 'together', 'dance', 'show', 'hope', 'will', 'save', 'community', 'center', 'being', 'demolished', 'make', 'room', 'new', 'shopping', 'center', 'Breakin', '2', 'Electric', 'Boogaloo', 'was', 'released', 'just', '7', 'months', 'first', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'short', 'time', 'span', 'sequel.Like', 'original', 'Breakin', 'movie', 'Electric', 'Boogaloo', 'full', '80s', 'style', 'dancing', 'mainly', 'break', 'dancing', 'as', 'well', 'poppin', 'lockin', 'also', 'original', 'movie', 'brightest', 'when', 'focus', 'dancing.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'expanded', 'time', 'around', 'writing', 'awkward', 'feel', 'time', 'dancing', 'pulls', 'movie', 'lines', 'are', 'uttered', 'right', 'back', 'out', 'addition', 'increased', 'plot', 'highlights', 'acting', 'inexperience', 'stars.If', 'was', 'base', 'rating', 'Breakin', '2', 'only', 'plot', 'writing', 'acting', 'would', 'only', 'receive', 'one-star', 'However', 'once', 'again', 'dancing', 'main', 'star', 'show', 'was', 'base', 'rating', 'only', 'dancing', 'would', 'receive', 'five-stars', 'really', 'good', 'good', 'compromise', 'order', 'here', 'hence', 'three-star', 'rating']",N/A

However, the follow up ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"" was just straight up wack to the max, the most pathetic dancing movie I had ever seen in my life. Michael Jackson's full version of ""Bad"" was way better than this movie with a decent story line, good acting, good music, as well as hot dance movies. The writers of ""Breakin' 2""- Jan Ventura and Julie Reichert- took the characters from the first movie and decided to turn the second movie into some type of 94 minute mainstream episode of Sesame Street meets Los Angeles, filled with too many cute children, rainbow colored buildings, and fluorescent colors galore.

When they find out that Miracles (the local youth center) is about to be shut down by evil businessmen, they decide to take matters into their own hands... and heads... and backs... and can't-stop-till-you've-had-enough beat-shuffling feet.The talent of the dancers in this movie is undeniable, and the fact that they hold their own in the acting department, as well -- speaks volumes.  Some might consider this movie to be horribly dated and even preposterous, but for those of us that have ever break danced in the street for a meal, you know that there is nothing preposterous about it.  If you want something bad enough, you'll do everything you can to get it.Yes, even break dancing to prevent bulldozers from knocking down your neighborhood youth center.Break dancing may have been a short-lived fad, but like all good things, the time will come when it will be part of the mainstream again. And I'm sure I speak for all three members of the C.B.D.R.T. when I say the resurrection can't come soon enough.This movie is for anybody that has ever underestimated the power of break dancing.

This is a sequel to the Breakin' movie, which is the better of the two.  But if you like corny movies or 80s dance, you have to watch the second one just to experience it.  Except for the 3 main characters that come back, the movie is very different from the first.  Both movies focus more on dancing rather than story or acting, and that's just fine.  This movie serves up plenty.  Even though I think the first one is the better movie, I've actually watched this one more often.  It just never gets boring.The first movie felt more realistic, even though it had a Hollywood ending.  The second seems to throw any sense of realism out the window and does it's best to entertain, bringing lots of dance and music in.  It is extremely cheesy and corny, but very funny.  Whether it's intentional or not, there are a lot of funny scenes.  There is a dance or music sequence every five minutes, a lot of bright colored clothes, 80s hairstyles, a dancing on the ceiling scene, a dance-off ""battle"", even a mime mysteriously named ""Magician""...now that's entertainment.  Turbo and Ozone bring Kelly to Miracles, their local community center, to teach dance to street kids.  Everyone is having a great time until the villain comes along and wants to tear down the building to put up a shopping center.  Everyone bands together to try to save Miracles.  The story is very predictable, but it doesn't matter because the movie moves along with rarely a dull moment.  There are a few scenes in the middle of the film that aren't as great-like when they go to meet Kelly's parents.  I usually just skip to the next one.  One of the best is the bulldozer scene-you'll know it when you see it.  Hilarious, but the music is cool too.I know a lot of people compare it to the first.  No it isn't as good if you are going to take it seriously...the first is okay for that...you just *can't* take this one seriously.  It is just fun to watch, for laughs and for the dancing.
