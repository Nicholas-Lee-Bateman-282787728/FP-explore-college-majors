I just can't get enough of season 4, even Courteney Cox said her favorite season is this one right here! Every episode is so good and that's not an easy task to achieve, the writers were truly gifted. Ross and Rachel finally decide NOT to get back together, Ross moves on to bossy brit Emily who decides to marry her in London in the hilarious season finale. Phoebe is asked by her half brother if she would be the surrogate to his and his wife's babies. Lisa Kudrow won an Emmy this season and rightly so. Also in this season there's a love triangle between Joey, Chandler, and Kathy. Rachel and Monica want the boys to get rid of the chick and duck and they want their apartment. I love, love, love this show.

The brilliant writing, the chemistry and comedic talents of the actors, and the outrageous and irresistible characters add up to such an enjoyable viewing experience.Season four is notable for the continuation of the Ross and Rachel saga, which ultimately culminates in Ross's marrying Emily but saying Rachel's names during his vows.  The season serves to show how out of sync Rachel and Ross are and how really deluded they can be when they each try to convince themselves that they no longer feel anything for the other.The gem of this season, though, is Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife.  This means that we get to see more of Giovanni Ribisi as her hilarious brother and it is the season that had quite possibly one of the funniest lines in television, in which Frank Jr. exults in the news that his sister is pregnant with his baby.  It also provides fodder for some very funny pregnancy gags, such as watching Rachel and Monica's well-intentioned shower for Phoebe go horribly awry.This season also grants us some conflict between Joey and Chandler and especially helps to develop Chandler's character a bit further.  When Chandler crosses the line with Joey's girlfriend Kathy, we see just how angry Joey can be--and also how generous and concerned for his friend's happiness.  It's never been a secret that Chandler is afraid of commitment but his relationship with Kathy shows just how neurotic Chandler can be.Perhaps best of all, this season really ends with a bang when Monica and Chandler finally get together.  There had been hints throughout the series up to that point but the revelation that the two of them slept together is still a big surprise.",5,Still one of the best,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1844,"['Friends', 'admittedly', 'getting', 'bit', 'dated', 'watching', 'seasons', 'once', 'again', 'am', 'reminded', 'just', 'why', 'loved', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'chemistry', 'comedic', 'talents', 'actors', 'outrageous', 'irresistible', 'characters', 'add', 'up', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'experience.Season', 'four', 'notable', 'continuation', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'saga', 'ultimately', 'Ross', 'marrying', 'Emily', 'saying', 'Rachel', 'names', 'vows', 'season', 'show', 'how', 'sync', 'Rachel', 'Ross', 'are', 'how', 'really', 'deluded', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'try', 'convince', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'anything', 'other.The', 'gem', 'season', 'though', 'Phoebe', 'becoming', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'brother', 'wife', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'hilarious', 'brother', 'season', 'had', 'quite', 'possibly', 'one', 'funniest', 'lines', 'television', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'exults', 'news', 'sister', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'also', 'fodder', 'very', 'funny', 'pregnancy', 'gags', 'such', 'watching', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'well-intentioned', 'shower', 'Phoebe', 'go', 'horribly', 'awry.This', 'season', 'also', 'conflict', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'especially', 'develop', 'Chandler', 'character', 'bit', 'further', 'When', 'Chandler', 'line', 'Joey', 'girlfriend', 'Kathy', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'angry', 'Joey', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'how', 'generous', 'concerned', 'friend', 'happiness', 'never', 'been', 'secret', 'Chandler', 'afraid', 'commitment', 'relationship', 'Kathy', 'shows', 'just', 'how', 'neurotic', 'Chandler', 'can', 'be.Perhaps', 'best', 'season', 'really', 'bang', 'when', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'had', 'been', 'hints', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'revelation', 'two', 'slept', 'together', 'still', 'big', 'surprise']",Friends: Season 4

Ross breaks up with Bonnie and decides for sure that Rachel is the one he still wants to be with. Rachel has written Ross an 18-page letter, front and back, for Ross to read before they make their reunion official.

752887,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0000996IS,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 5]","To be sure, there is a lot to like about the 4th Season of Friends.  Unfortunately, contrary to most of the Amazon reviews posted here, I feel it's also one of the silliest (and not in a god way) seasons.  There are a number of multi-episode storylines that were so forgettable that watching some of these episodes on DVD was like seeing them for the first time.  To wit: the love triangle between Joey, Chandler, and Kathy; and Rachel's new boyfriend Joshua.  Of course, Pheobe acting as host mother for her brother's babies is unforgettable, but ultimately annoying and silly as well.Having said that, there are some outstanding individual moments and episodes.  My second-favourite episode in the whole series is probably ""The One With the Embryos,"" in which Ross builds a quiz game to determine if the girls know the boys better, or vice versa.  As a result, Joey and Chandler (and the birds!) get to take over Monica's apartment.  Another ongoing storyline that I liked was the Ross-Emily courtship.  Of course, it is ultimately doomed to failure (as all of Ross's marriages are), but the Rachel's jealousy sometimes takes the jokes to some fun places.  And, of course, no review could truly be complete without some reference to Ross's ""Sound"" that he debuts for the public - basically a random collection of synthesiser sounds accompanied by free-verse poetry.Season 4 does set up the form that the rest of the series will take, and in that sense it is a pivotal season.  Chandler and Monica's pairing starts here, as does the running joke of Ross and his divorces, Phoebe's mellowing into a sympathetic character, and the basic Rachel-Ross dynamic for the rest of the series.  Many fans were very upset by Season 5, when Rachel apparently has a complete change of heart in her feelings for Ross, but for this season, her performances are consistent and believable (that she is in denial about her continuing feelings for Ross).  Of course, all the actors are very good this season, as they have settled into their characters and know them intimately.It's just too bad that the ongoing stories are mostly forgettable.  Otherwise, Season 4 really would have been the best season.",3,"Some of the greatest Friends moments, but some of the worst ongoing stories",1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2185,"['be', 'sure', 'lot', 'like', '4th', 'Season', 'Friends', 'Unfortunately', 'contrary', 'most', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', 'feel', 'also', 'one', 'silliest', 'not', 'god', 'way', 'seasons', 'are', 'number', 'multi-episode', 'storylines', 'were', 'so', 'forgettable', 'watching', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'was', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'wit', 'love', 'triangle', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'Kathy', 'Rachel', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Joshua', 'course', 'Pheobe', 'acting', 'host', 'mother', 'brother', 'babies', 'unforgettable', 'ultimately', 'annoying', 'silly', 'well.Having', 'said', 'are', 'outstanding', 'individual', 'moments', 'episodes', 'second-favourite', 'episode', 'whole', 'series', 'probably', 'One', 'Embryos', 'Ross', 'quiz', 'game', 'determine', 'girls', 'know', 'boys', 'better', 'vice', 'versa', 'result', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'birds', 'get', 'take', 'over', 'Monica', 'apartment', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'liked', 'was', 'Ross-Emily', 'courtship', 'course', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Ross', 'marriages', 'are', 'Rachel', 'jealousy', 'sometimes', 'jokes', 'fun', 'places', 'course', 'review', 'could', 'truly', 'be', 'complete', 'reference', 'Ross', 'Sound', 'public', 'basically', 'random', 'collection', 'synthesiser', 'sounds', 'accompanied', 'free-verse', 'poetry.Season', '4', 'set', 'up', 'form', 'rest', 'series', 'will', 'take', 'sense', 'pivotal', 'season', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'pairing', 'here', 'running', 'joke', 'Ross', 'divorces', 'Phoebe', 'mellowing', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'basic', 'Rachel-Ross', 'dynamic', 'rest', 'series', 'Many', 'fans', 'were', 'very', 'upset', 'Season', '5', 'when', 'Rachel', 'apparently', 'complete', 'change', 'heart', 'feelings', 'Ross', 'season', 'performances', 'are', 'consistent', 'believable', 'denial', 'continuing', 'feelings', 'Ross', 'course', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'season', 'have', 'settled', 'characters', 'know', 'intimately.It', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'ongoing', 'stories', 'are', 'mostly', 'forgettable', 'Otherwise', 'Season', '4', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'season']",Friends: Season 4

752896,ARX984I8G47K5,B0000996IS,friendsfan,"[1, 1]","The fourth season of the show represents Friends at the top of its game. The writers are at their hysterical best here and the cast continues to explore their characters with increasing depth, humor, and heart. The majority of the characters face some huge character arcs in this season and all the actors step up their game, even Cox, who isn't given too much to do this year. Monica's biggest story this season is changing jobs and eventually finding some success at a fancy resturant, but not before having to win over some hostile staff members. Cox is hsyerical as Monica, who always has to be liked, tries to win over her angry waiters. Schwimmer's  Ross is at his earnest, neuortic best this season, as he bickers with Rachel the majority of the year, before eventually finding ""love"" with Emily. As much as I like Ross and Rachel together, I also love them apart, since Schwimmer and Aniston are so funny to watch when they are fighting and trying to make each other jealous, which they do a lot of during the season. Chandler faces some unwanted romantic feelings for one of Joey's girlfriend, and Perry takes the opporunity to show a different side to Chandler. The first three seasons, Chandler was mainly a go to the joke type character full of one-liners and quirks. However, his budding relationship with his roommate's girl allows him to show Chandler's softer side and because of Perry's honest portrayal Chandler becomes a much more relatable character. LeBlanc's Joey finds himself facing betrayal by his best friend, and the actor manages Joey's hurt and conflict well. It will still be a few seasons before LeBlanc hits his mark as Joey, but he continues to grow as an actor here and shows that Joey is not just a dense womanizer and that he lives by a strict code of morals. While all the actors are incredible this season, it is Aniston and Kudrow who steal the show. Aniston's Rachel continues her growth as a complex character, and at the same shows some of the self-centered, b***** Rachel that was around during the first season. Aniston is so good at playing a character who can be so self-involved, while still making her vulnerable and likeable. Aniston is both funny and vulnerable as Rachel tries to win Joshua's attention and also deals with the realization that Ross is moving on. This season should've at least garnered her an emmy nod, if just for her performance in ""TOW the Wedding Dresses."" Kudrow, who won an Emmy for this season, is also on fire here and is given the biggest character arc, as Phoebe agrees to be a surrogate for her brother's babies. Kudrow plays Phoebe with a hysterical off-centredness and has a real warmth and heart that comse through in her portrayal. Only Phoebe would agree to carry her brother's children knowing how hard it is going to be once the pregnancy ends, and Kudrow is a real comic pro here. She manages to let Phoebe show some real heart, without losing the comedic aspect of the story or her character. Standout episodes from this season include ""TOW Chandler Crosses the Line,"" ""TOW Chandler in a box,"" ""TOW the Girl From Poughkeepsie,"" ""TOW Phoebe's Uterus,"" ""TOW Rachel's Crush,"" ""TOW All the Rugby,"" ""TOW the Fake Party,"" ""TOW the Free Porn,"" ""TOW All the Haste,"" ""TOW the Wedding Dresses,"" ""TOW the Worst Best Man Ever,"" ""TOW Ross's Wedding,"" and of course ""TOW the Embryos,"" which features the now infamous girls v. guys trivia game that results in the loss of Monica and Rachel's apartment.

752908,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000996IS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","I have not been enamored of television situation comedies in recent years, which would explain why I never watched &quot;Friends&quot; until I caught the cliffhanger at the end of the fourth season when Ross says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his wedding in London.  Then it was a question of getting caught up with the reruns and syndicated episodes to understand why this was not only funny but apparently a scene of some pathos.  In looking back at &quot;Friends: The Complete Fourth Season&quot; in the grand scheme of things, it seems clear that the reason this was the best season of &quot;Friends&quot; to that point was not just because all six of the cast members have their characters done but because the bottom was so high.  There is nothing as grand in this season as the endings of &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; or &quot;The One with the Proposal,&quot; but the only really bad average in the bunch is &quot;The One with the Worst Best Man Ever,&quot; which combines Phoebe's pregnant mood swings with Joey's idea of the ideal bachelor's party (watching most of the cast fly to Europe would have been more fun).Once again, Ross and Rachel provide the season defining story arc, which begins with the ramifications of their being &quot;on a break&quot; and ends with Ross about to marry another woman.  However, in retrospect what stands out equally as much is how we begin with Chandler having to pee on Monica's jellyfish sting and ends with their jumping into bed together on the eve of the big wedding in London.  Lisa Kudrow's pregnancy forced the show to come up with the idea of Phoebe serving as a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife, which carries over to the next year, while the success the previous system with having Joey move out of the apartment spawns another roommate conflict when Chandler actually takes Kathy away from Joey.  Actually, the four episodes dealing with the Joey-Kathy-Chandler triangle are probably my favorites from season four.Best episodes from the fourth season: &quot;The One with the Jellyfish,&quot; just to watch Monica, Chandler and Joey confessing what happened on the beach; &quot;The One with the Cat&quot; because it has Joey locked in an entertainment center; &quot;The One with the Cuffs&quot; because it has Chandler in cuffs but without pants; &quot;The One With Chandler in a Box&quot; because it has Chandler in a box (notice a theme here?); &quot;The One with the Emryos&quot; just for the final question in Ross' high-stake trivia contest that stumps Rachel and Monica; and &quot;The One with Ross's Wedding Part 1 &amp; 2,&quot; not just for the cliffhanger but for the hired English cast highlighted by Fergie and Tom Conti.  You may or may not be impressed by the ability of the show to milk out more twists and turns from the Ross and Rachel traveling show, but the ability to take the gag about Chandler and Monica jumping into bed together and have that romance supplant the other one during the next two seasons is certainly impressive.",5,Things get really interesting when &quot;Friends&quot; goes to London,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,3041,"['have', 'not', 'been', 'enamored', 'television', 'situation', 'comedies', 'recent', 'years', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'never', 'watched', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'caught', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'fourth', 'season', 'when', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'name', 'instead', 'Emily', 'wedding', 'London', 'Then', 'was', 'question', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'reruns', 'syndicated', 'episodes', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'funny', 'apparently', 'scene', 'pathos', 'looking', 'back', 'quot', 'Friends', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'quot', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'clear', 'reason', 'was', 'best', 'season', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'six', 'cast', 'members', 'have', 'characters', 'done', 'bottom', 'was', 'so', 'high', 'nothing', 'grand', 'season', 'endings', 'quot', 'One', 'Prom', 'Video', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'Proposal', 'quot', 'only', 'really', 'bad', 'average', 'bunch', 'quot', 'One', 'Worst', 'Best', 'Man', 'Ever', 'quot', 'Phoebe', 'pregnant', 'mood', 'swings', 'Joey', 'idea', 'ideal', 'bachelor', 'party', 'watching', 'most', 'cast', 'fly', 'Europe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', '.Once', 'again', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'provide', 'season', 'defining', 'story', 'arc', 'ramifications', 'being', 'quot', 'break', 'quot', 'Ross', 'marry', 'woman', 'However', 'retrospect', 'what', 'out', 'equally', 'as', 'much', 'how', 'begin', 'Chandler', 'having', 'pee', 'Monica', 'jellyfish', 'sting', 'jumping', 'bed', 'together', 'eve', 'big', 'wedding', 'London', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'pregnancy', 'forced', 'show', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'Phoebe', 'serving', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'brother', 'wife', 'next', 'year', 'success', 'previous', 'system', 'having', 'Joey', 'move', 'apartment', 'roommate', 'conflict', 'when', 'Chandler', 'actually', 'Kathy', 'away', 'Joey', 'Actually', 'four', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'Joey-Kathy-Chandler', 'triangle', 'are', 'probably', 'favorites', 'season', 'four.Best', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'quot', 'One', 'Jellyfish', 'quot', 'just', 'watch', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'Joey', 'confessing', 'what', 'happened', 'beach', 'quot', 'One', 'Cat', 'quot', 'Joey', 'locked', 'entertainment', 'center', 'quot', 'One', 'Cuffs', 'quot', 'Chandler', 'cuffs', 'pants', 'quot', 'One', 'Chandler', 'Box', 'quot', 'Chandler', 'box', 'theme', 'here', 'quot', 'One', 'Emryos', 'quot', 'just', 'final', 'question', 'Ross', 'high-stake', 'trivia', 'contest', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'quot', 'One', 'Ross', 'Wedding', 'Part', '1', 'amp', '2', 'quot', 'not', 'just', 'cliffhanger', 'hired', 'English', 'cast', 'highlighted', 'Fergie', 'Tom', 'Conti', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'impressed', 'ability', 'show', 'milk', 'out', 'more', 'twists', 'turns', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'traveling', 'show', 'ability', 'take', 'gag', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'jumping', 'bed', 'together', 'have', 'romance', 'supplant', 'other', 'one', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'certainly', 'impressive']",Friends: Season 4

The storylines are absolutely brilliant.  I feel that one of the best storylines of the series is Phoebe becoming a surrogate for her half-brother and wife.  When the writers were faced with the daunting task of deciding what to do with Lisa Kudrow's real-life pregnancy, they could have decided to ignore it (like Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Seinfeld) or come up with some lame storyline.  However, they delivered something that not only is true to her character, but it's totally believable.  Kudos to the writers for coming up with such a great storyline!Also, I gotta say that Jennifer Aniston shines in this season.  Rachel experiences many different emotions throughout the season, and Jennifer did an excellent job conveying these emotions.Of course, I end my reviews with a rundown of my favorite episodes during the season, and here they are:The One With the JellyfishThe One With the CuffsThe One With the Ballroom DancingThe One With the Dirty GirlThe One With Chandler in a BoxThe One With the Girl from PoughkeepsieThe One With Phoebe's UterusThe One With the EmbryosThe One With the Fake PartyThe One With the Free PornThe One With All the HasteThe One With All the Wedding DressesThe One With the InvitationThe One With Ross's WeddingYes, it seems like I listed a lot of the episodes, but they are just so good that it's hard to pick which ones to list!

Leading off the list of great guest stars who join our six friends is a cat apparently possessing the spirit of Phoebe's dead mother.  Then there's Chip Matthews, the jock of Monica and Rachael's high school days, who has either never left those days behind him or he's seen ""Fast Times At Richmont High"" a few too many times.  Speaking of the past, an old friend of Ross and Chandler's from their college days, known only as ""Gandalf"", had planned to stop by but had to cancel at the last minute...this makes me wonder, based on the stories the guys share about him, what would have happened if he had shown up (still wondering, by the way.)  Joey proves himself an impressive ballroom dancer, passing these skills on to the building's super who's looking to impress a woman.  And we get a romantic situation that could perhaps be spicier than Ross and Rachael when Chandler falls for Joey's girlfriend, who becomes more than a one-night-stand for the latter.  But let's not forget the relationship that everyone remembers.  Ross meets a woman, Emily, and a whirlwind romance cullminates with a wedding that will leave everyone speechless.

They got off the silliness of the 1st and 2nd seasons and matured as most people in their mid to late 20s do between the 4th and 10th.  The producers and writers wanted to keep them single all the time and date people, but real life doesn't go like that.  That's why several of them got married and had babies later on.  But I watched that funny season finale, which is still my favorite out of their 236 shows.  Watched it on NBC in May 1998 when Ross was getting married to longtime girlfriend Emily. Ross says the WRONG girl's name at the altar!!!!!  When he said ""Rachel"", I rolled off laughting!!!! Rachel was whom Ross went with before. They still show that show in past clips!  I noticed Emily's shocking look on her face.  Easily the series' funniest moment and shows why Central Park's six characters are known for their aloofness.  I have more respect for this show because of this hilarious wedding episode.  It wasn't the typical tired wedding show that network sitcoms or dramas love to make to pull in 20 to 25 million viewers for the season finale. Wedding themed shows pull in big ratings every time. It showed a common thing in weddings, the nervousness of bride and groom forgetting their own companion's names. And this show succeeded on all levels.

Foster,"[3, 3]","This series to me was always one of the more difficult series of Friends in that sometimes the emotional pull of the series overshadowed the comic edge that made Series 3 so awesome depsite the dramas that the Friends encountered.  That is not to say it isn't funny because it most definitely is, but at times it just lacks that punch for me.  Phoebe's birth of her brother's (!) triplets makes for some wonderful comedy of misunderstanding and a very touching 'goodbye' scene.  However it is Chandler's growing love for Joey's actress girlfriend, Kathy which commands the most respect in terms of the Friends' acting ability......but the most difficulty for this discerning viewer in terms of getting the comedy out of J & C's ailing friendship.  Rachel's aims to move up the career ladder are also cut short with the death of Joanna and Chandler's relationship with her doesn't make for the most convincing comedy of obstacles when Rachel objects, handcuffed to the filing cabinet or not!  There are some genuinely terrifik scenes and classic Friends moments however, my favourite being Phoebe's 'sexy phlegm' as she discovers a torch-song-singer vocal prowess, and also her home-made shoes.  Elsewhere the comedy just doesn't catch - see Ross trying to play football to impress Emily and Rachel's attempted cheerleading......funny yes, but not Friends funny.  Series 3 was so strong that perhaps it was hard to follow up, but when watching Series 5 after this one, you realise there were a few too many inadquacies, mainly driven by the more hard-hitting emotional dramas, the series ending with Rachel's realisation of her love for Ross as he's about to marry.

752921,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B0000996IS,Thayer,"[1, 1]","This season is regarded by many as the Friends strongest ever, and this is also my choice for the show's best season ever. It's just I love the whole feel of this season, very settling and ""homy"" but also fresh in terms of the storylines they did. This is the season where Phoebe became the surrogate mother of her brother's baby, Chandler and Joey fight over a girl, Ross wedding to Emily and of course the genesis of Monica and Chandler's romance. It's just pure perfection.Standouts episodes are TOW the Embryos (one of the very best episodes of the series), TOW the Fake Party (Aniston's comic highlight of the season), TOW Chandler in a Box (memorable for Le blanc and Perry), TOW Joey's New Girlfriend (Lisa Kudrow's storyline was hilarious, she stole the episode), Tow the Jellyfish, TOW the Cuffs, and the London finale TOW Ross' Wedding (London baby!!!)My favorite Friends storyline of all time is Phoebe getting pregnant. I know that it was done to accommodate Lisa Kudrow's real life pregnancy at that time but the surrogate storyline is just pure genius because the idea of it screams PHOEBE. It's just something Phoebe would do, that storyline add depth to her character. Chandler and Joey also had a character growth moment when the fought over a girl. Even though it had hilarious interludes, one cannot deny the true emotions some of those scenes brought.Grade: A+",5,Friends Season 4: A Wedding and The Surrogate Woman,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1380,"['season', 'regarded', 'many', 'Friends', 'strongest', 'ever', 'also', 'choice', 'show', 'best', 'season', 'ever', 'just', 'love', 'whole', 'feel', 'season', 'very', 'settling', 'homy', 'also', 'fresh', 'terms', 'storylines', 'did', 'season', 'where', 'Phoebe', 'became', 'surrogate', 'mother', 'brother', 'baby', 'Chandler', 'Joey', 'fight', 'over', 'girl', 'Ross', 'wedding', 'Emily', 'course', 'genesis', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'romance', 'just', 'pure', 'perfection.Standouts', 'episodes', 'are', 'TOW', 'Embryos', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'TOW', 'Fake', 'Party', 'Aniston', 'comic', 'highlight', 'season', 'TOW', 'Chandler', 'Box', 'memorable', 'Le', 'blanc', 'Perry', 'TOW', 'Joey', 'New', 'Girlfriend', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'storyline', 'was', 'hilarious', 'stole', 'episode', 'Tow', 'Jellyfish', 'TOW', 'Cuffs', 'London', 'finale', 'TOW', 'Ross', 'Wedding', 'London', 'baby', 'favorite', 'Friends', 'storyline', 'time', 'Phoebe', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'know', 'was', 'done', 'accommodate', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'real', 'life', 'pregnancy', 'time', 'surrogate', 'storyline', 'just', 'pure', 'genius', 'idea', 'PHOEBE', 'just', 'something', 'Phoebe', 'would', 'do', 'storyline', 'add', 'depth', 'character', 'Chandler', 'Joey', 'also', 'had', 'character', 'growth', 'moment', 'when', 'fought', 'girl', 'Even', 'had', 'hilarious', 'interludes', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'true', 'emotions', 'scenes', 'brought.Grade', 'A+']",Friends: Season 4
