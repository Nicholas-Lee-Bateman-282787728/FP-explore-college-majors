One interview is from around 1991 and the other was taped in 2001.  Both are very good and an eye-opening look at anti-social personality disorder...You get to hear Richard Kuklinski giving first hand accounts of life story and contract killings over the years. He describes in a very matter of fact way about his childhood and career as a contract murderer.This basically covers it all. We hear from him about his dysfunctional early home life, his murders, his family and his life with the mafia. We also get to hear about the friend Kuklinski trusted who ended up setting him up and aiding in his capture.This is the better of the iceman DVD's because it features the interview with the psychologist which was very interesting.

772477,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B0000C23T4,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[4, 12]","There is so much that is scary about these interviews that I hardly no where to start. Since I have reviewed another version of this DVD, I will restrict my comments on this one to the larger meaning of Richard Kuklinski's life in the context of American culture.Yesterday, the Oprah show showcased the life of a 40ish divorcee from the Atlanta area, with two pre-teen children. She was sinking fast into financial quicksand and grabbed onto a job as a ""stripper"" as a last resort lifeline. ""Stripping"" rescued her from the brink of social and financial death, and gave her and her family an entirely new outlook on life without the need for a husband or a father. She appeared on the show looking unusually fit and tan for a 40-year old woman -- and with money in the bank to boot. The show of course was the typical ""Oprah style rationalizations for why whatever a woman does morally is okay."" That is Oprah's place in American culture, to confirm to us that any moral standards that women reduce down to nothing, is okay. Societal morality after all is a consensus affair, relative, right? Oprah proves that there are no moral absolutes -- at least when it comes to American women, anyway. By working just two nights a week, this mother had more time with her kids, kept her body in shape, and for the first time in her life, was free of the need to depend on a man and had money left over. Without the life-saving job of ""stripping"" her life was a sure dead end. Seems like a real American success story, right?When I saw the show, I immediately thought about this interview of Richard Kuklinski being on the equivalent of a show slanted in the opposite direction towards males, only his interviewers were not the male equivalent of Oprah, but police investigators and establishment Psychiatrists:Kuklinski, at 17 was a skinny kid, who all the bullies picked on. He got tired of taking their ""crap"" and took an iron rod from the closet of his ""project"" apartment and beat one of them to death. No one reported him to the authorities. Thus we are left to assume that it was considered ""justified street homicide"" (just like what the police do). Plus, ""poor old Richard"" only had an eighth-grade education and both of his parents also beat the crap out of him every chance they got.So, what to do? Well, Richard carried a chip on his shoulder so big that he became a predator: That was his job. He could kick butt, anytime, anywhere. That was all he could do; the only thing that gave him an edge in a cruel world. He just learned to enjoy his talents a bit too much. The mob got wind of his reputation as a ""mad dog predator"" and quickly recruited him by making him an offer he could not refuse: You show us you can kill reliably and keep your mouth shut, and we'll pay you at least $50k per hit. Richard passed the job interview with flying colors, by killing under instruction, a random person in broad daylight in a residential neighborhood on the streets of New York City. From there the rest is history. One-hundred and fifty, to two-hundred murders later, and upward of $50 million that bankrolled a lavish upper crust New Jersey life style for his family, Richard was caught, after having eliminated all of his closest friends, but one: the one who fingered him. The moral of this story from Richard's point of view (and directly from his mouth): ""I had one friend too many.""But there are other morals to this Oprah-like expose of America's most cold-blooded, most productive, and most well-paid serial killer and predator: How does a 17-year old who kills a man on the street with many onlookers including the five who fled from his attack, avoid being arrested or being tried for murder #1, of 200 to come? Especially in a culture where being caught with one $10 rock of cocaine can get you 10 to 20 years in prison, no matter the age?Another moral to this story is Kuklinski's wife, who now sees herself as a victim, after the fact. But she was unconvincing when she claimed that she did not know what Richard did to provide her the lavish life style she was living. She just lived lavishly off the fruit of his murders without thinking to ask questions about where the hell all that money was coming from? One does not need to know everything to know something: We all have a sixth sense about these things. For 30 years, she put her sixth sense to sleep, because she did not want to know the truth. Passive lying is lying no less.And in what other nation on earth can a person make $50 million dollars as a hired killer and not be caught for over 30 years? Like Kuklinski's wife, there are a lot of people turning to Oprah in order to learn how to put their sixth sense to sleep: There is a lot of collective denial going on in New Jersey and in the U.S.Morality is relative anyway right? It is the ""O.J.s"" of the world that Americans really fear, not the Richard Kuklinskis, right?

772489,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0000C23T4,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[55, 57]","The Iceman Interviews is a 45 minute collection of interviews with Richard Kuklinski and uses pretty much all the same footage as another DVD called Confessions of a Mafia Hitman. Although both DVDs are interesting and offer a peek into the mind of a hitman, arguably a serial killer, although he got paid for it at times, this one has a section titled The Iceman and The Psychologist. That makes all the difference.This 15 minute interview that Richard Kuklinski has with a psychologist is very eye-opening and really delves into how and why Kuklinski would 1. perform these heinous acts, and 2. be able to perform these heinous acts. It's very interesting to see Kuklinski talk about how these actions made him feel, as well as talking about his childhood and the way his father treated him.If you're at all interested in psychology or the psychology of serial killers and other abnormalities in the human psyche, this section will keep you enthralled. I only wish it were longer.The rest of the DVD contains footage and interviews that the other DVD contains as well. In these sections Kuklinski talks about how he went about his career as a hitman, and describes different murders that he committed.",5,The better of the two interview compilations,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1203,"['Iceman', 'Interviews', '45', 'minute', 'collection', 'interviews', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'footage', 'DVD', 'called', 'Confessions', 'Mafia', 'Hitman', 'DVDs', 'are', 'interesting', 'offer', 'peek', 'mind', 'hitman', 'arguably', 'serial', 'killer', 'got', 'paid', 'times', 'one', 'section', 'titled', 'Iceman', 'Psychologist', 'difference.This', '15', 'minute', 'interview', 'Richard', 'Kuklinski', 'psychologist', 'very', 'eye-opening', 'really', 'how', 'why', 'Kuklinski', 'would', '1.', 'perform', 'heinous', 'acts', '2.', 'be', 'able', 'perform', 'heinous', 'acts', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'Kuklinski', 'talk', 'how', 'actions', 'made', 'feel', 'as', 'well', 'talking', 'childhood', 'way', 'father', 'treated', 'him.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'psychology', 'psychology', 'serial', 'killers', 'other', 'abnormalities', 'human', 'psyche', 'section', 'will', 'keep', 'enthralled', 'only', 'wish', 'were', 'longer.The', 'rest', 'DVD', 'footage', 'interviews', 'other', 'DVD', 'contains', 'as', 'well', 'sections', 'Kuklinski', 'talks', 'how', 'went', 'career', 'hitman', 'describes', 'different', 'murders', 'committed']",N/A
