Simply amazing. One of the hardest ab workouts I've ever done. Buy this dvd for that alone - it's SO worth it!I'm a Bob Harper fan so I thought it would be just great fun having him take me through a 15 minute ab workout ... boy was I wrong! Bob is great! - the 15 minutes are pure hell on earth. The morning that this portion of the dvd are in my workout rotation are the scariest mornings of the week! - Just like Jaws has forever changed how we think of swimming in the ocean - these 15 minutes will forever change the way you look at your DVD player!Best ab workout ever! - again, buy this DVD just for that - you wont regret it! - you may never be able to look at Bob or you DVD player the same way, but you'll LOVE the workout and more importantly - the results!YOGA FOR THE WARRIOR""Yoga For The Warrior"" - is ""good"", it's not great, but it's good - and if you're a Bob Harper fan (like myself) you'll love having him in your living room putting you through a workout.I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has never done Yoga, but if you've been to like 3 classes and are somewhat familiar with posses and concepts, then you're good to go.This DVD is not a ""purist"" Yoga practice - so if you're looking for that, that spiritual, flowing, life-energy vibe type of practice then this is not for you - this is more about the 'work out' aspect of Yoga - the muscles flexing, sweat inducing, fun yet tough work outSide note - a bridge between that traditional practice (as best as it can be on a DVD) and a workout for the sake of working out would beCrunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout: The Joy of Yoga & Fat-Burning Yoga(taught by Sara Ivanhoe) - that's a great Yoga dvd/workout (one of the best out there) and makes this dvd ""Yoga For The Warrior"" a great dvd to add into rotation as a compliment or switching up 2nd tier type of practice.In the end - the ""Yoga For The Warrior"" section I give 3 stars - the 15 minute ab part - I give 5 stars ... and a reminder ... buy this DVD! ... but you've been warned ...

1382544,AUKDOB4DXLZD7,B00429C1VQ,Cheryl Deal,"[0, 1]","I bought this at BJ's for $10, because I like Bob on Biggest Loser but I've never tried any of his DVD's.  I figured $10 was a good price to try one out and since I've done yoga, on and off, for years, this was a good fit for me.  I have feet problems, so I can't do a lot of the jumping around videos that he (and others) make.One of the reasons I enjoy yoga so much is the spiritual side of it, which this video has none of...but I don't seem to miss it here.  Bob's no-nonsense approach works, and the workout is pretty thorough. You will get a full body burn on this DVD.If you are a beginner, there is a ""modifier"" you can watch (a person that does the moves at a lower level of intensity).  For those that are more advanced, there are two others to watch.  But, like others have said, it would be best if you already know how to do most of the moves properly, because his attention to form is a bit lacking.  If you don't already know the moves, please just go slowly and don't try to push too hard or you may end up with a pulled muscle or ten.All in all, though...after over two months, I still enjoy doing this DVD every few days.",4,Great Workout,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,1139,"['bought', 'BJ', '10', 'like', 'Bob', 'Biggest', 'Loser', ""'ve"", 'never', 'tried', 'DVD', 'figured', '10', 'was', 'good', 'price', 'try', 'one', 'out', ""'ve"", 'done', 'yoga', 'off', 'years', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'have', 'feet', 'problems', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'jumping', 'around', 'videos', 'others', 'make.One', 'reasons', 'enjoy', 'yoga', 'so', 'much', 'spiritual', 'side', 'video', 'none', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'miss', 'here', 'Bob', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'works', 'workout', 'pretty', 'thorough', 'will', 'get', 'full', 'body', 'burn', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'beginner', 'modifier', 'can', 'watch', 'person', 'moves', 'lower', 'level', 'intensity', 'are', 'more', 'advanced', 'are', 'two', 'others', 'watch', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'most', 'moves', 'properly', 'attention', 'form', 'bit', 'lacking', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'moves', 'please', 'just', 'go', 'slowly', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'push', 'too', 'hard', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'pulled', 'muscle', 'ten.All', 'two', 'months', 'still', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'DVD', 'few', 'days']",N/A

I like it because it has some challenging poses, it keeps on flowing, it works strength, balance, flexibility. I am comfortable with the instructor's style - I don't particularly like him nor do I find him annoying or in any way objectionable. He's there to instruct, and for me, his instruction works. The hour went by too quickly doing this workout. I really liked it. There was not a single boring moment.This is one of my favourite workouts. I was apprehensive that it might be too difficult as my heart was beating all the way up to my mouth when I first did Harper's Cardio Rev. Yoga for the Warrior was challenging, a focussed workout, but manageable. Due to a wrist injury, I can't do too many plank push ups, so I drop to my knees when the wrist starts to protest. That wrist also can't get into position for the wheel, so I don't push it. I either to a lower wheel, or stay with the bridge. Besides those, I could pretty much do everything else. There was a heart-stopping moment when he had the ladies transition from triangle pose to bird of paradise, however the guy was doing a less advanced pose which was a relief. To my surprise, I was also able to go from triangle to bird of paradise. I think by the time we got there in the DVD, the body was warmed up and limber enough. The fit and well-built guy doing the less advanced versions is also perspiring; it makes a point to me that we get a workout doing the level which suits us, not necessarily the advanced version.Not for beginners.There's a separate 15min abs workout in this DVD. It is pretty good, not so very tough but it does challenge the core.",5,One of my favourite workouts,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,1654,"['good', 'workout', 'challenging', 'poses', 'flowing', 'strength', 'balance', 'flexibility', 'am', 'comfortable', 'instructor', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'do', 'find', 'annoying', 'way', 'objectionable', 'there', 'instruct', 'instruction', 'hour', 'went', 'too', 'quickly', 'doing', 'workout', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'not', 'single', 'boring', 'moment.This', 'one', 'favourite', 'workouts', 'was', 'apprehensive', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'heart', 'was', 'beating', 'way', 'mouth', 'when', 'first', 'did', 'Harper', 'Cardio', 'Rev', 'Yoga', 'Warrior', 'was', 'challenging', 'focussed', 'workout', 'manageable', 'Due', 'wrist', 'injury', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'many', 'plank', 'push', 'ups', 'drop', 'knees', 'when', 'wrist', 'protest', 'wrist', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'position', 'wheel', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'either', 'lower', 'wheel', 'stay', 'bridge', 'could', 'pretty', 'much', 'do', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'heart-stopping', 'moment', 'when', 'had', 'ladies', 'transition', 'triangle', 'pose', 'bird', 'paradise', 'however', 'guy', 'was', 'doing', 'less', 'advanced', 'pose', 'was', 'relief', 'surprise', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'go', 'triangle', 'bird', 'paradise', 'think', 'time', 'got', 'there', 'DVD', 'body', 'was', 'warmed', 'up', 'limber', 'enough', 'fit', 'well-built', 'guy', 'doing', 'less', 'advanced', 'versions', 'also', 'perspiring', 'point', 'get', 'workout', 'doing', 'level', 'suits', 'not', 'necessarily', 'advanced', 'version.Not', 'beginners.There', 'separate', '15min', 'abs', 'workout', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'tough', 'challenge', 'core']",N/A
1382547,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B00429C1VQ,Colleen M. Schneider,"[2, 2]","I do yoga at home a couple times a week and was interested in seeing what Bob Harper's take on it would be.  I have tried his Inside Out Cardio Series, and it was tough (I mean, seriously, when the exercisers look like they are going to cry you know you are in for it).  I would say I am an intermediate practicer of yoga and this dvd would fall in the intermediate to more advanced category.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros: good form and good cuing on the moves, also there is one person who is not Gumby's cousin doing the moves, so for those less flexible you can watch the guy in the back.  You are still getting a good workout but the modifications will help you if you are not quite up to the moves. Bob does have a good warm-up and also a nice cool down with my favorite...Shavasana...or corpse pose.  I was born to lay on the floor like that....man, after sweating up a storm it felt incredible.  I liked the length of the dvd, 1 hour for the full yoga program and a bonus yoga abs workout for 15 minutes.  The moves are classics that you've done before, up dog, down-dog, triangle, warrior one & two, half moon pose, chair pose, bridge, etc.  Nothing really new there, but there is one called ""bird of paradise"" that was quite challenging.  In yoga though challenging is good.  Just don't push, let your body go to where it feels good.  Yoga is about breathing and working through a difficult position while still keeping yourself calm and keeping your breath even. I felt he was bringing me a challenging program but it was a little more toned down than the instruction for the cardio, which was fitting.Cons: The music was ok....a bit of a driving rock beat, which I would normally love, but not necessarily when I am doing yoga. As far as being completely different, I don't really think so.  I have lots of yoga dvds, Bryan Kest, Yoga Zone, Sara Ivanhoe, Shiva Rea, and Rodney Yee.  I felt he did make some of the poses more like doing reps which did tend to exhaust my muscles a little more, kind of in the same vein as Jillian Michaels's Yoga dvd, but new?  Eh, not so much.Overall, surprisingly good yoga dvd. I definitely got a workout and also did the abs workout, which is focused and tough (in a good way).  If you like Bob's teaching style and are already familiar with yoga this might be a nice addition to your collection.  If you are looking for a more basic dvd to start out with I would choose something else until you have mastered the poses and want to expand your practice.",4,Yoga to make you sweat.....,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,2503,"['do', 'yoga', 'home', 'couple', 'week', 'was', 'interested', 'seeing', 'what', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'take', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'tried', 'Inside', 'Out', 'Cardio', 'Series', 'was', 'tough', 'mean', 'seriously', 'when', 'exercisers', 'look', 'are', 'going', 'cry', 'know', 'are', 'would', 'say', 'am', 'intermediate', 'practicer', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'would', 'fall', 'intermediate', 'more', 'advanced', 'category', 'Here', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'Pros', 'good', 'form', 'good', 'cuing', 'moves', 'also', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'Gumby', 'cousin', 'doing', 'moves', 'so', 'less', 'flexible', 'can', 'watch', 'guy', 'back', 'are', 'still', 'getting', 'good', 'workout', 'modifications', 'will', 'help', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'moves', 'Bob', 'have', 'good', 'warm-up', 'also', 'nice', 'cool', 'down', 'favorite', 'Shavasana', 'corpse', 'pose', 'was', 'born', 'lay', 'floor', '.man', 'sweating', 'up', 'storm', 'felt', 'incredible', 'liked', 'length', 'dvd', '1', 'hour', 'full', 'yoga', 'program', 'bonus', 'yoga', 'abs', '15', 'minutes', 'moves', 'are', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'done', 'before', 'up', 'dog', 'down-dog', 'triangle', 'warrior', 'one', 'two', 'half', 'moon', 'pose', 'chair', 'pose', 'bridge', 'etc', 'Nothing', 'really', 'new', 'there', 'one', 'called', 'bird', 'paradise', 'was', 'quite', 'challenging', 'yoga', 'challenging', 'good', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'push', 'let', 'body', 'go', 'where', 'good', 'Yoga', 'breathing', 'working', 'difficult', 'position', 'still', 'keeping', 'calm', 'keeping', 'breath', 'even', 'felt', 'was', 'bringing', 'challenging', 'program', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'toned', 'down', 'instruction', 'cardio', 'was', 'fitting.Cons', 'music', 'was', 'ok', '.a', 'bit', 'driving', 'rock', 'beat', 'would', 'normally', 'love', 'not', 'necessarily', 'when', 'am', 'doing', 'yoga', 'As', 'far', 'being', 'completely', 'different', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'so', 'have', 'lots', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Sara', 'Ivanhoe', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'felt', 'did', 'make', 'poses', 'more', 'doing', 'reps', 'did', 'tend', 'exhaust', 'muscles', 'little', 'more', 'kind', 'same', 'vein', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'Yoga', 'dvd', 'new', 'Eh', 'not', 'so', 'much.Overall', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'yoga', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'got', 'workout', 'also', 'did', 'abs', 'workout', 'focused', 'tough', 'good', 'way', 'like', 'Bob', 'teaching', 'style', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'yoga', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'addition', 'collection', 'are', 'looking', 'more', 'basic', 'dvd', 'start', 'out', 'would', 'choose', 'something', 'else', 'have', 'mastered', 'poses', 'want', 'expand', 'practice']",N/A

1382549,A1YS5EZCF21PBS,B00429C1VQ,F. Ali,"[5, 5]","To start off, I'm a fitness + yoga instructor and an advanced exerciser who's kind of on the fence about Bob Harper. I have a couple of his other dvds and I like that he does challenging workouts; however, I'm not a fan of his queuing in terms of form/safety/modifications.Being an instructor I have taught/taken my share of yoga classes and have tried several dvds in the past and am pretty picky about which ones I use, though I definitely try to be open about different yoga styles. I'm definitely not a purist about yoga! Still, I was hesitant to get Bob Harper's dvd mainly because that's not his area of expertise (at least to my knowledge)...I generally like to get yoga dvds with reputable yoga instructors, not from instructors/trainers who are perhaps experts of other areas in the fitness industry. That's just me.Still, I heard a lot of good buzz about this, and the other dvds I have by him are pretty rough, so I figured I'd give this one a shot. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the moves done in this dvd (wheel, binding poses...very advanced) and it was generally a nice mix and a nice flow to the whole thing. I was also interested in the background music -- it was kind of rock, which I've never experienced in a yoga class/dvd, but it was surprisingly not distracting, and I thought it worked.As for the cons, I had expected this dvd to be a lot tougher, but I think I've actually sweated more during my own classes, so that was a little disappointing. Also, I think he could have done a bit more queuing in terms of proper form and alignment, as well as shown more modifications for those who are absolute beginners. Finally, this might not be an issue for some people, but I have a thing about dvds/classes where the instructor doesn't do any of the moves with you, and they have a sort of trainer approach to teaching. (or at least with my experience with trainers, they don't do the exercises with their clients) and for some reason that irks me a bit. I can't help but wonder if they'd be all cocky and self-assured if they were dripping in sweat like everyone else. But it's a small thing, I can overlook it. :PSo, on the whole, I think this dvd is alright.

This is not a bad workout, its just that there are so many power yoga workouts that are so very similar to this and many have better instruction (for example, Bryan Kest's 3 workout DVD series is a better bargain and has better instructions and a better price).  If you already some good power yoga workouts, this workout will not really add anything new to your collection.The level of this workout is pitched towards the intermediate/advanced exerciser.  The demonstration of proper form is pretty minimal so this is best for someone who knows how to properly execute the moves.  The workout also has some fairly advanced moves such as binds (moves in which one part of the body holds onto another part of the body or when two parts of the body are intertwined.  These are great but you can injure yourself if you do not have good form).There are three people going through this workout.  Like the other workouts in this series, there is a timer counting down how much of the workout is left.  The workout starts with basic stretching and then works into the sun salutation series (flat back stretch with palms to ground, downward dog, plank, chatkuranga, upward dog).The workout coves all the basic power yoga poses: tree, triangle, reversed triangle, warrior 1,2, and 3, half moon, triangle, reversed triangle, chair pose, lunges, wheel, seated twists, bridge.The first portion of the workout is standing poses, the last workout is seated work.All in all, this is a solid power yoga workout that will work the entire body.  However, there is nothing in this workout that really differentiates it from other power yoga workouts.

Not sure I'll get to the point of the woman who did the Bird of Paradise move, but maybe that's something I will aspire to :-)  The best part was the relaxation at the end, Bob did a great job with that part, my heart rate went down super fast and lower than it usually does which was a nice surprise.  I'm one of those people Bob talks about on this dvd who has a hard time truly relaxing.  I can see doing this every other day.",5,"Legs burning, love the relaxation at the end",1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,898,"['just', 'did', 'workout', 'first', 'time', 'been', 'eons', ""'ve"", 'done', 'yoga', 'really', 'had', 'figure', 'out', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'yoga', 'being', 'sweaty', 'love', 'burned', '460', 'calories', 'knees', 'are', 'unhappy', 'right', 'now', 'hopefully', 'continue', 'do', 'dvd', 'will', 'improve', 'hope', 'have', 'balance', 'issues', 'due', 'meds', ""'m"", ""'m"", 'hoping', 'doing', 'yoga', 'will', 'help', 'used', 'have', 'extremely', 'good', 'balance', 'Not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'get', 'point', 'woman', 'who', 'did', 'Bird', 'Paradise', 'move', 'maybe', 'something', 'will', 'aspire', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'relaxation', 'end', 'Bob', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'part', 'heart', 'rate', 'went', 'super', 'fast', 'lower', 'usually', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'Bob', 'talks', 'dvd', 'who', 'hard', 'time', 'truly', 'relaxing', 'can', 'see', 'doing', 'other', 'day']",N/A

About the product specifically, this is a HARD workout. But you feel amazing afterward. The 60-minute yoga spends the first half wearing you out completely and then calms down a bit so that by the end, you feel brand new. Dead ... but new. Lol.I also love the 15-minute ab workout. You should be warned that 15 minutes with Bob Harper is NOT phoning in a workout for the day.

He keeps the flow moving--there are not a lot of 2-minute holds here. The pace keeps the workout interesting and also increases your heart rate.I like Bob's mannerisms in the DVD. His voice is peaceful enough to be appropriate for Yoga, while still challenging the kids on the video and the people at home.I also appreciate that there is no &#34;ohhm&#34; ing, ujjayi breathing or chanting. I respect these aspects of Yoga, and when I take a live class, the instructors include these elements and I do participate. I'll admit feel a little odd chanting in a live class, but there's just no way I'm going to do it at home in my living room, and I am glad that Bob skips that part.I have been taking Yoga for several years, practicing at home and in live classes. I tried this DVD out the first day I got it just because I wanted to see it. It was supposed to be a rest day for me, so I didn't do it full-out. I was still sore the next day! I do have a lot of room to grow with this DVD, as I used some of the modifications and it would take a while to move into the full expression of some of the poses, but I could participate in some way with all of the poses. The poses were not so completely impossible that all I could do was sit and watch.I also like that a very big, muscular, extremely fit-looking guy is the one doing the simpler modifications, and the women are doing the full-out expressions of the poses. So when I have to adjust downward, I am still following a very strong, athletic man, which is way better than when a DVD choses, say, a sort of out-of-shape-looking person for their modification model.Bob does a good job of giving instructions that you can mostly follow when you are upside-down or turned away from the TV. I appreciate that he counts down how much longer you have in a pose, and that the timer at the bottom of the screen tells you how much of the workout remains.All in all, a great DVD for days I can't make it to the studio!",5,A kick-butt workout that requires a good basic fitness level,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,2369,"['Thus', 'excellent', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'good', 'level', 'fitness', 'would', 'be', 'comfortable', 'level-2', 'Yoga', 'class.Bob', 'modifications', 'less', 'advanced', 'students', 'moves', 'chaturanga', 'pushup', 'full', 'side', 'plank', 'are', 'high-risk', 'beginners', 'not', 'say', 'DVD.If', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'Yoga', 'very', 'challenging', 'fast-moving', 'workout', 'flow', 'moving', 'are', 'not', 'lot', '2-minute', 'here', 'pace', 'workout', 'interesting', 'also', 'heart', 'rate.I', 'Bob', 'mannerisms', 'DVD', 'voice', 'peaceful', 'enough', 'be', 'appropriate', 'Yoga', 'still', 'challenging', 'kids', 'video', 'people', 'home.I', 'also', 'appreciate', '34', '34', 'ing', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'chanting', 'respect', 'aspects', 'Yoga', 'when', 'take', 'live', 'class', 'instructors', 'include', 'elements', 'do', 'participate', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'feel', 'little', 'odd', 'chanting', 'live', 'class', 'just', 'way', ""'m"", 'going', 'do', 'home', 'living', 'room', 'am', 'glad', 'Bob', 'part.I', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'Yoga', 'several', 'years', 'practicing', 'home', 'live', 'classes', 'tried', 'DVD', 'first', 'day', 'got', 'just', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'rest', 'day', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'full-out', 'was', 'still', 'sore', 'next', 'day', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'room', 'grow', 'DVD', 'used', 'modifications', 'would', 'take', 'while', 'move', 'full', 'expression', 'poses', 'could', 'participate', 'way', 'poses', 'poses', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'completely', 'impossible', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'sit', 'watch.I', 'also', 'very', 'big', 'muscular', 'extremely', 'fit-looking', 'guy', 'one', 'doing', 'simpler', 'modifications', 'women', 'are', 'doing', 'full-out', 'expressions', 'poses', 'when', 'have', 'adjust', 'downward', 'am', 'still', 'following', 'very', 'strong', 'athletic', 'man', 'way', 'better', 'when', 'DVD', 'choses', 'say', 'sort', 'out-of-shape-looking', 'person', 'modification', 'model.Bob', 'good', 'job', 'giving', 'instructions', 'can', 'mostly', 'follow', 'when', 'are', 'upside-down', 'turned', 'away', 'TV', 'appreciate', 'down', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'have', 'pose', 'timer', 'bottom', 'screen', 'how', 'much', 'workout', 'remains.All', 'great', 'DVD', 'days', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'studio']",N/A
