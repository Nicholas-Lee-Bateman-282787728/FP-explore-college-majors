921972,A21279TEPJ8YJ9,B000A59PNI,"Diaspora Chic ""diaspora_chic""","[7, 8]","""Black Girl"" and ""Borom Sarret"" depict Senegal after independence. ""Black Girl"" tells the story of Diuoanne, an African, with dreams of going to France to escape her poor neighborhood in Dakar. When she arrives in France, her dreams of the beautiful city Antibes is a nightmare. Madame is a plantation mistress who treats her like property rather than an adult. She finds fault with everything she does. Diouanne is a prisoner in another country with no chance of exploring the city. Feeling deprived of her self-worth, she takes the mask that she has given to them because it is the only thing that reminds her of her homeland.""Borom Sarret"" is a story of a family man who earns a living driving a cart. Life is rough where he lives, but he is proud of who he is and where he comes from. On the other side, the city is filled with buildings and cars on the street. It is more modern than where he is living. However, modernity has its price and he sees it for what it is.Both short films portray the optimism and disappointment post-colonial independence for the African people. Sembene gives a riveting picture of intra- and interracial relations; the economic struggle; and social expectations of Africa and Africans. This is a great movie to watch and discuss with among peers as to how it has changed for the better or for the worse.",5,Excellent Cinematography and Dialogue,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1338,"['Black', 'Girl', 'Borom', 'Sarret', 'depict', 'Senegal', 'independence', 'Black', 'Girl', 'story', 'Diuoanne', 'African', 'dreams', 'going', 'France', 'escape', 'poor', 'neighborhood', 'Dakar', 'When', 'France', 'dreams', 'beautiful', 'city', 'Antibes', 'nightmare', 'Madame', 'plantation', 'mistress', 'who', 'like', 'property', 'rather', 'adult', 'fault', 'everything', 'Diouanne', 'prisoner', 'country', 'chance', 'exploring', 'city', 'Feeling', 'deprived', 'self-worth', 'mask', 'given', 'only', 'thing', 'homeland', 'Sarret', 'story', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'driving', 'cart', 'Life', 'rough', 'where', 'proud', 'who', 'where', 'other', 'side', 'city', 'filled', 'buildings', 'cars', 'street', 'more', 'modern', 'where', 'living', 'However', 'modernity', 'price', 'what', 'short', 'films', 'portray', 'optimism', 'disappointment', 'post-colonial', 'independence', 'African', 'people', 'Sembene', 'riveting', 'picture', 'intra-', 'interracial', 'relations', 'economic', 'struggle', 'social', 'expectations', 'Africa', 'Africans', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'discuss', 'peers', 'how', 'changed', 'better', 'worse']",N/A
921973,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B000A59PNI,Doug Anderson,"[0, 0]","The opening shot is of a long white luxury liner gracefully gliding into a French port. The liner slices through black seas in what looks to be an obvious colonial/postcolonial metaphor albeit a beautifully photographed one. Probably the most fascinating thing about the film though is its refusal to offer any easy simplistic white/black discourses. In fact, essentialist and existentialist notions of identity (for both whites and blacks) seem to exist side by side throughout the film. In the second shot, Diouana, the black girl, exits the liner and wonders (on voiceover) if there will be anyone there to pick her up. We then watch as she adjust to her new life as a live-in housemaid in France. In flashback we learn what led her there. Diouana lived in a Senegalese shantytown with her extended family and everyone in her extended family works to feed and clothe and educate the family so Diouana seeks work as a maid. She is soon hired by a family that lives in Dakar. Money is one of her motivations but its not her sole motivation. You can tell that she likes wearing the French dresses she is given to wear. The other blacks in her shantytown seem suspicious of whites and protective of their black culture/heritage but Diouana is kind of carefree and even though one of her family members is a schooteacher she never bothers to learn to read. In her spare time she looks at fashion magazines. She is surrounded by blacks who value their culture and family but she wants something else for herself--so when the opportunity comes for her to move to France she jumps on it and even dances barefoot on a statue that commemorates those who gave their lives in the struggle for independence. The camera lingers on the word ""independence"" long enough to allow us to realize that for Diouana independence doesn't mean the same thing it does to her countrymen. In the flashbacks she seems happy as she anticipates her new life, but once in France she likes nothing about her life and feels like little more than a slave. Director Sembene is careful not to lay the blame solely on the whites. Some of the French whites do treat her like an exotic object (one guy even asks to kiss her since he's never kissed a black girl) but her unhappiness seems to stem from her own confusions about who she is as much as they do from her working conditions. I won't reveal the ending just in case you decide to watch it, but suffice it to say that Sembene does not really judge Diouana, in fact he seems to sympathize with her but also with the whites esp her male employer who does not seem to like his life either. Although we don't get much information about him, he seems to just waste away for many of the same reasons that Diouana does (he's unsatisfactorily integrated into any social world). I suppose you could read this as a didactic film (a pro class and race and nationalist allegiance film) but what makes the characters interesting is the ways that they resist integration into any simple grouping. So to me anyway the film feels like a New Wave film insofar as it analyzes unmoored modern beings (even though a marxist would prob look at the film and say the characters problems would be solved if only they were less selfish and more selflessly allied with their class, race, nation....). I don't know that Sembene thinks that politics offer any easy answers for the things that plague modern beings and that is this films unique power.",5,"Modern Beings Unmoored to Class, Race, or Nationhood",1382486400,"10 23, 2013",2013,3442,"['opening', 'shot', 'long', 'white', 'luxury', 'liner', 'gracefully', 'gliding', 'French', 'port', 'liner', 'black', 'seas', 'what', 'be', 'obvious', 'colonial/postcolonial', 'metaphor', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'one', 'Probably', 'most', 'fascinating', 'thing', 'film', 'though', 'refusal', 'offer', 'easy', 'simplistic', 'white/black', 'discourses', 'fact', 'essentialist', 'existentialist', 'notions', 'identity', 'whites', 'blacks', 'seem', 'exist', 'side', 'side', 'film', 'second', 'shot', 'Diouana', 'black', 'girl', 'liner', 'wonders', 'voiceover', 'will', 'be', 'anyone', 'there', 'pick', 'up', 'then', 'watch', 'new', 'life', 'live-in', 'housemaid', 'France', 'flashback', 'learn', 'what', 'led', 'there', 'Diouana', 'lived', 'Senegalese', 'shantytown', 'extended', 'family', 'everyone', 'extended', 'family', 'feed', 'clothe', 'educate', 'family', 'so', 'Diouana', 'work', 'maid', 'soon', 'hired', 'family', 'Dakar', 'Money', 'one', 'motivations', 'not', 'sole', 'motivation', 'can', 'tell', 'wearing', 'French', 'dresses', 'given', 'wear', 'other', 'blacks', 'shantytown', 'seem', 'suspicious', 'whites', 'protective', 'black', 'culture/heritage', 'Diouana', 'kind', 'carefree', 'even', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'schooteacher', 'never', 'bothers', 'learn', 'read', 'spare', 'time', 'fashion', 'magazines', 'surrounded', 'blacks', 'who', 'value', 'culture', 'family', 'something', 'else', 'so', 'when', 'opportunity', 'move', 'France', 'even', 'dances', 'barefoot', 'statue', 'who', 'gave', 'lives', 'struggle', 'independence', 'camera', 'word', 'independence', 'long', 'enough', 'allow', 'realize', 'Diouana', 'independence', ""n't"", 'mean', 'same', 'thing', 'countrymen', 'flashbacks', 'happy', 'new', 'life', 'once', 'France', 'nothing', 'life', 'feels', 'little', 'more', 'slave', 'Director', 'Sembene', 'careful', 'not', 'lay', 'blame', 'solely', 'whites', 'French', 'whites', 'do', 'treat', 'exotic', 'object', 'one', 'guy', 'even', 'kiss', 'never', 'kissed', 'black', 'girl', 'unhappiness', 'stem', 'own', 'confusions', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'working', 'conditions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'ending', 'just', 'case', 'decide', 'watch', 'say', 'Sembene', 'not', 'really', 'judge', 'Diouana', 'fact', 'sympathize', 'also', 'whites', 'esp', 'male', 'employer', 'who', 'not', 'seem', 'like', 'life', 'either', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'information', 'just', 'waste', 'away', 'many', 'same', 'reasons', 'Diouana', 'unsatisfactorily', 'integrated', 'social', 'world', 'suppose', 'could', 'read', 'didactic', 'film', 'pro', 'class', 'race', 'nationalist', 'allegiance', 'film', 'what', 'characters', 'interesting', 'ways', 'resist', 'integration', 'simple', 'grouping', 'So', 'anyway', 'film', 'feels', 'New', 'Wave', 'film', 'insofar', 'unmoored', 'modern', 'beings', 'even', 'marxist', 'would', 'prob', 'look', 'film', 'say', 'characters', 'problems', 'would', 'be', 'solved', 'only', 'were', 'less', 'selfish', 'more', 'selflessly', 'allied', 'class', 'race', 'nation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sembene', 'politics', 'offer', 'easy', 'answers', 'things', 'plague', 'modern', 'beings', 'films', 'unique', 'power']",N/A

I loved many aspects like the photography and the african sound - track in the backround,  in much of the film,  was haunting. I thought the actress who played the black maid was charming because her black skin made an elegant silhouette against the white decor of the apartment and which ever way she moved was like a sculpture; it was so aesthetic and a nice example of how beautiful black women can be. Her expressions were lovely too in a natural, understated way. She did not do much acting. She did not have a chance. Instead her voice and thoughts were dubbed in by a shrill ' very french and definitely white woman.  This was a serious disjunct. In its own way, maybe this was the film's way to teach white 'middle-class french women to empathise with the black race and not be nasty racists. Who knows but the actress playing the maid was wasted as a prop; pleasing though she was to watch; pleasing as the film was to watch despite being no more than moaning about her lot, cleaning and some evocative flasbacks of life before she left. Towards the last 1/4 she goes on strike. "" "" Ata girl "" I thought "" Now they will have to send you home"" Although it would have been quicker to pee over over their nice couch.Then Bam  !!! The film goes from that to an incredibly stupid suprise because there is  suddenly a frame of her naked in a bloody bath-tub with shot of a raser. Nothing in that monotone narration or her facial expressions indicated anything more than going on strike. That silly narration was on another planet when it came to any dramatic sensitive or serious hint or build-up to suicide.This film resonates with something appealing and hauntingly African but is marred by intense shallow,invasive Frenchness. It's like a great painting but someone painted graffitti on it.( Ontop of the suicide, the expression on her mother's face when she refuses her dead daughter's wages was inane.

921979,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000A59PNI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","&lt;strong>La Noire de...&lt;/strong> (Ousmane Sembene, 1966)&lt;em>La Noire de...&lt;/em>, released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>Black Girl&lt;/em>, was the first feature released by Senegalese director Ousmane Sembene, and is considered to be the first feature released by a black director from sub-Saharan Africa. (Whether it's a feature or a short is debatable; IMDB lists the running time at sixty-five minutes, but the print I saw was fifty-seven.) As such, it has come under intense scrutiny in the almost half-decade since its release. It is also, I doubt coincidentally, often mentioned as one of the best movies ever made (I don't have access to my collection of thousand-best lists at present, though I can tell you with a quick Internet search it appears on Rosenbaum's 1000 Essential Films list and Piero Scaruffi's 1000 Best Films of All Time). From what I've seen, it may be the most contentious film to appear on such a list. I have an hypothesis on that, which I'll get into later.Plot: Diouana (Mbissine Th&eacute;r&eacute;se Diop, in her only film role) is a young Senegalese woman hired by a French family (known in the film only as Madame, played by Anne-Marie Jelinek in her only film appearance, and Monsieur, the first role for &lt;em>Emita&lt;/em>'s Robert Fontaine) as a caretaker for their children. They are satisfied enough with her performance that they invite her to continue in that capacity in France. She goes with them, and pretty much as soon as they step off the plane, attitudes change: they begin treating her more as a maid than as a nanny, which leads to understandable resentment on Diouanna's part. This leads to an escalating cycle of tensions between Madame and Diouanna.Putting aside the objections of those who somehow didn't get that Diouanna's role changes when she gets to France (which seems an oddly sizable group of commenters on the film), its critics, in the sense of those who loathe it, point out mostly that it's boring as all hell. I wouldn't go that far, but I think it is very much a product of its time and place. It is obviously a look at colonialism, and Sembene has a great deal to say about the subject. I think the problem is that as the film gets older, and the people who are watching it get younger, Sembene's topicalism is likely to work to the film's disadvantage; how many college students in 2012 in any country other than Senegal or France even remember that Senegal was once a French colony? (And I'm not entirely sure about the ""and France"" part.) The farther a distance we get from the events, the less a good deal of Sembene's specific symbolism is going to mean to the average film student; I think we're already long past the days of the movie having relevance to the average film&lt;em>goer&lt;/em>. Movies like this can certainly be made universal, and I've little doubt Sembene knew this, which leads me to believe that he treated this film as an intensely personal document, not necessarily personal to himself, but personal to Senegal, to the country's history and culture at the point in time where it had just recently achieved emancipation from its colonial oppressors. As such, almost by definition, the film is not immortal. While I can't say those who mindlessly slag the film are in any way justified in doing so--it's quite obvious most of them weren't paying enough attention to pick up on even the unsubtle changes in the French family's attitude towards Diouanna when they all arrive in France--I do think that the film is becoming more a document of a time and place than it is a huge, sweeping tale of social injustice. Which makes it no less worth watching, but may decrease its ""importance"", whatever that may mean, as time goes on. ***",3,"So far, a review of Black Girl only.",1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3748,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'La', 'Noire', 'lt', '>', 'Ousmane', 'Sembene', '1966', 'lt', '>', 'La', 'Noire', 'lt', '>', 'released', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'lt', '>', 'Black', 'Girl', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'released', 'Senegalese', 'director', 'Ousmane', 'Sembene', 'considered', 'be', 'first', 'feature', 'released', 'black', 'director', 'sub-Saharan', 'Africa', 'feature', 'short', 'debatable', 'IMDB', 'running', 'time', 'sixty-five', 'minutes', 'print', 'saw', 'was', 'fifty-seven', 'such', 'come', 'intense', 'scrutiny', 'almost', 'half-decade', 'release', 'also', 'doubt', 'coincidentally', 'often', 'mentioned', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'access', 'collection', 'thousand-best', 'lists', 'present', 'can', 'tell', 'quick', 'Internet', 'search', 'Rosenbaum', '1000', 'Essential', 'Films', 'list', 'Piero', 'Scaruffi', '1000', 'Best', 'Films', 'All', 'Time', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'contentious', 'film', 'appear', 'list', 'have', 'hypothesis', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later.Plot', 'Diouana', 'Mbissine', 'Th', 'eacute', 'r', 'eacute', 'Diop', 'only', 'film', 'role', 'young', 'Senegalese', 'woman', 'hired', 'French', 'family', 'known', 'film', 'only', 'Madame', 'played', 'Anne-Marie', 'Jelinek', 'only', 'film', 'appearance', 'Monsieur', 'first', 'role', 'lt', '>', 'Emita', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Robert', 'Fontaine', 'caretaker', 'children', 'are', 'satisfied', 'enough', 'performance', 'invite', 'continue', 'capacity', 'France', 'pretty', 'much', 'as', 'soon', 'step', 'plane', 'attitudes', 'change', 'begin', 'treating', 'more', 'maid', 'nanny', 'understandable', 'resentment', 'Diouanna', 'part', 'escalating', 'cycle', 'tensions', 'Madame', 'Diouanna.Putting', 'aside', 'objections', 'who', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Diouanna', 'role', 'changes', 'when', 'France', 'oddly', 'sizable', 'group', 'commenters', 'film', 'critics', 'sense', 'who', 'loathe', 'point', 'out', 'mostly', 'boring', 'hell', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'think', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'time', 'place', 'obviously', 'look', 'colonialism', 'Sembene', 'great', 'deal', 'say', 'subject', 'think', 'problem', 'film', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'get', 'younger', 'Sembene', 'topicalism', 'likely', 'work', 'film', 'disadvantage', 'how', 'many', 'college', 'students', '2012', 'country', 'other', 'Senegal', 'France', 'even', 'remember', 'Senegal', 'was', 'once', 'French', 'colony', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'France', 'part', 'farther', 'distance', 'get', 'events', 'less', 'good', 'deal', 'Sembene', 'specific', 'symbolism', 'going', 'mean', 'average', 'film', 'student', 'think', ""'re"", 'already', 'long', 'days', 'movie', 'having', 'relevance', 'average', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'goer', 'lt', '>', 'Movies', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'made', 'universal', ""'ve"", 'little', 'doubt', 'Sembene', 'knew', 'believe', 'treated', 'film', 'intensely', 'personal', 'document', 'not', 'necessarily', 'personal', 'personal', 'Senegal', 'country', 'history', 'culture', 'point', 'time', 'where', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'achieved', 'emancipation', 'colonial', 'oppressors', 'such', 'almost', 'definition', 'film', 'not', 'immortal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'who', 'mindlessly', 'slag', 'film', 'are', 'way', 'justified', 'doing', 'so', 'quite', 'obvious', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'paying', 'enough', 'attention', 'pick', 'up', 'even', 'unsubtle', 'changes', 'French', 'family', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Diouanna', 'when', 'arrive', 'France', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'becoming', 'more', 'document', 'time', 'place', 'huge', 'sweeping', 'tale', 'social', 'injustice', 'less', 'worth', 'watching', 'may', 'decrease', 'importance', 'may', 'mean', 'time', '***']",N/A
921980,A2H387XJ67U0CA,B000A59PNI,Zia Haider,"[2, 2]","Note: This review only covers ""Borom Sarret"". Ousmane Sembene creates a sympathetic character who is down on his luck in post-Colonial Senegal. The donkey-cart driver simply wants to earn enough money to feed his family at the end of the day but customers who are too poor to pay him and parasitic foreigners and their colonial collaborators cause him to lose his cart and all his money over the course of a day. Even the little he has left, his pride in his heritage and ancestors, cause him nothing but financial ruination. The donkey cart driver himself speaks in the voice over narration with a dripping cynicism about the current state of Senegal and the effect modernization has had on the country and its people. The ending is left open to interpretation. Overall this is a realistic and cynical portrait of Senegal just after colonization and should not be missed.",4,Borom Sarret- A day in the life of a village donkey cart driver,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,872,"['Note', 'review', 'only', 'Borom', 'Sarret', 'Ousmane', 'Sembene', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'post-Colonial', 'Senegal', 'donkey-cart', 'driver', 'simply', 'earn', 'enough', 'money', 'feed', 'family', 'end', 'day', 'customers', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'poor', 'pay', 'parasitic', 'foreigners', 'colonial', 'collaborators', 'cause', 'lose', 'cart', 'money', 'course', 'day', 'Even', 'little', 'left', 'pride', 'heritage', 'ancestors', 'cause', 'nothing', 'financial', 'ruination', 'donkey', 'cart', 'driver', 'voice', 'narration', 'dripping', 'cynicism', 'current', 'state', 'Senegal', 'effect', 'modernization', 'had', 'country', 'people', 'ending', 'left', 'open', 'interpretation', 'Overall', 'realistic', 'cynical', 'portrait', 'Senegal', 'just', 'colonization', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A
