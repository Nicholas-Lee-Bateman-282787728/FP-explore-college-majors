The documentary starts with Mr. Tunick getting ready for a five month cross country tour at his family home in New York and follows him on his journey as he photographs individuals and groups of people nude, sometimes in very public places.I'll never know how the guy can keep avoiding jail time for his efforts but they are really interesting, some of them quite good. I found him to be a little whiny at times but my biggest complaint is that the film maker just seemed to zip through many of the scenes, some of them I couldn't get any real sense of what the resulting photographs would look like. I can understand how he was able to get one or two people to pose in some small town out of the way places at an early morning hour but New York City with a street full of nude people, now that was really something. Young (only one or two babies, no children), Old, mostly white but some black, slender or very large, all are represented by Tunick and seemed happy to do it for him, even those who didn't know the guy.  The main program ends with a showing in a New York gallery, some of his subjects were there still proud of his efforts, and several magazines formerly not interested were paying attention to Tunick's work now.The film and short film were good, the short perhaps helped by being so brief. I didn't have much use for the photo gallery, some of the stuff done in the documentaries was better.Some of the photo subjects talked about how liberating it felt to pose nude, wonder how many of them have participated in anything nudist since that time?",4,"Very interesting, could've been better",1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,1651,"[""'d"", 'give', '3', '1/2', 'rating', 'was', 'possible', 'thought', 'needed', 'something', 'documentary', 'starts', 'Mr.', 'Tunick', 'getting', 'ready', 'five', 'month', 'cross', 'country', 'tour', 'family', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'journey', 'individuals', 'groups', 'people', 'nude', 'sometimes', 'very', 'public', 'places.I', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'how', 'guy', 'can', 'keep', 'avoiding', 'jail', 'time', 'efforts', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'quite', 'good', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'whiny', 'times', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'film', 'maker', 'just', 'seemed', 'zip', 'many', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'real', 'sense', 'what', 'resulting', 'photographs', 'would', 'look', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'pose', 'small', 'town', 'way', 'places', 'early', 'morning', 'hour', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'street', 'full', 'nude', 'people', 'now', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'Young', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'babies', 'children', 'Old', 'mostly', 'white', 'black', 'slender', 'very', 'large', 'are', 'represented', 'Tunick', 'seemed', 'happy', 'do', 'even', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'main', 'program', 'showing', 'New', 'York', 'gallery', 'subjects', 'were', 'still', 'proud', 'efforts', 'several', 'magazines', 'formerly', 'not', 'interested', 'were', 'paying', 'attention', 'Tunick', 'work', 'now.The', 'film', 'short', 'film', 'were', 'good', 'short', 'perhaps', 'helped', 'being', 'so', 'brief', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'use', 'photo', 'gallery', 'stuff', 'done', 'documentaries', 'was', 'better.Some', 'photo', 'talked', 'how', 'liberating', 'felt', 'pose', 'nude', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'have', 'participated', 'anything', 'nudist', 'time']",Naked States

674471,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00005QBYT,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[10, 12]","NAKED STATES is a fascinating documentary about New York photographer/artist Spencer Tunick as he embarks on his ""Naked States"" tour, getting people from every state to shed their clothes all for the sake of art. Tunick just picks regular people off the street to model for his photos. You've got to admire these people; figuratively speaking, I wouldn't have the balls to do something like that. Not surprisingly the moralists manage to get him arrested in several states for ""aiding and abetting disorderly conduct"". Ironically, Tunick is listed on the DVD profile as being ""notoriously private""! And despite his hunger for publicity he doesn't want the tabloids to cover his art as he feels they will cheapen its merit!Even just seeing the different backgrounds and personalities of his subjects is fascinating. There's an amusing scene of a tough biker guy getting aggro at Tunick when Tunick asks his daughter to pose for him, and another subject is a rape victim being photographed as part of her healing process. One photo even shows the twin towers of the WTC in the background (Yes, I DO notice other things when there are naked women in view!). It's also good to see that Tunick is willing to strip too to get his work done, as we see when he photographs several thousand people at a Phish concert. The finished pictures look amazing. I found it funny how the news item on the doco censored the nudity- especially when on any other day you see gruesome war footage and the like. This would probably never happen in NZ (Unless the artist was Maori, Helen Clark just can't say ""No"" to them). NAKED STATES is highly recommended.

674472,A34PAZQ73SL163,B00005QBYT,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[14, 34]","It says a great deal about how tone deaf our culture is that a charlatan artist like Spencer Tunick is actually a legitimate subject for a documentary. Nudity is his cause celebre, but its being culturally risqu&eacute; after 1970 is simply a joke. It was certainly was wild, crazy, and verboten back in 1910, but today? Heck, now it's practically a civic requirement. Believing that taking one's clothes off in public is somehow avante garde is merely a reflection of just how clueless and insolated pseudo-intellectuals like Tunick are. They think that people in America are out banning Ulysses in their spare time and that the mass of us are extras from the movie Footloose. Tunick is woefully nave about the general population's attitude towards sex. Pornography has entered the mainstream in this new millennium and cannot easily be separated from the rest of entertainment. One has to feel sorry for the confused individuals who actually buy the idea that stripping is liberating. It certainly would be if you're an exhibitionist, but for the average person it is merely a sign of a pathetic longing for attention. When one subject states (in all seriousness): ""this shoot is 90 percent of my self-therapy,"" it is hard not to laugh out loud; although, perhaps Tunick will dub his next film, ""Taking it all off for Freud.""

This HBO documentary that runs a little over an hour records his journey. The photographs range all the way from single individuals and a few  people together to as many as a thousand nudes in one photo shoot. Mr. Tunick takes in a biker rally, a Burning Man celebration, a meeting of naturalists-- apparently the group that was the least cooperative-- and a Phish concert.Some of the photographs are quite good; others are trite and far too cute and gimmicky. What is so interesting about a naked very pregnant white woman standing with a poor black man, fully clothed, beside his grocery cart full of cans and other things he has collected? Or two women embracing while they stand on a large American flag? And does a rape victim need to let me see her naked? She tells the documentary maker that doing these shots was great therapy for her. Not everyone's lives have to be made public.The photographs that work best are the ones where hundreds of people are lying down in open spaces. They become something else besides naked people and call to mind some of the photographs of Edward Weston when he shot nudes that look like vegetables and/or fruit. Sometimes they take on the quality of the masterful work of Sebastiao Salgado, no small feat.People, particularly Americans with our Puritan heritage, will always be fascinated by the naked body in any way it is presented to them. Mr. Tunick says in this documentary that he wanted to do something new and different with photographing nudes-- although I read that he wants to be called an artist rather than a photographer. Okay. Certainly the German photographer Henning von Berg did something similar on a smaller scale when he photographed nude men in Berlin in 1999. Of course he didn't get arrested for his actions as has Mr. Tunick several times in New York. And while this artist may photograph a nude woman in a pubic place with a snake on her head for its shock value, Joel-Peter Witkin many years ago established himself as the grand master of the macabre as it relates to the naked body.Apparently most of the models get quite a kick out of baring it all. One man interviewed described the phenomenon as giving the third finger to oppressive society. The artist, as I understand it, has also attempted to make statements about both HIV/AIDS (by photographing people who are HIV positive without clothes) and keeping the planet green.These photographs would work best either seen in a gallery or in a catalogue, and some of them are worth seeing again and again.",4,Overexposure,1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,2635,"['Spencer', 'Tunick', 'set', 'out', 'photograph', 'naked', 'people', '50', 'states', 'completed', 'mission', 'five', 'months', 'HBO', 'documentary', 'little', 'hour', 'records', 'journey', 'photographs', 'range', 'way', 'single', 'individuals', 'few', 'people', 'together', 'as', 'many', 'thousand', 'nudes', 'one', 'photo', 'shoot', 'Mr.', 'Tunick', 'biker', 'rally', 'Burning', 'Man', 'celebration', 'meeting', 'naturalists', 'apparently', 'group', 'was', 'least', 'cooperative', 'Phish', 'concert.Some', 'photographs', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'others', 'are', 'trite', 'far', 'too', 'cute', 'gimmicky', 'What', 'so', 'interesting', 'naked', 'very', 'pregnant', 'white', 'woman', 'standing', 'poor', 'black', 'man', 'fully', 'clothed', 'beside', 'grocery', 'cart', 'full', 'cans', 'other', 'things', 'collected', 'two', 'women', 'embracing', 'stand', 'large', 'American', 'flag', 'rape', 'victim', 'need', 'let', 'see', 'naked', 'documentary', 'maker', 'doing', 'shots', 'was', 'great', 'therapy', 'Not', 'everyone', 'lives', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'public.The', 'photographs', 'work', 'best', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'hundreds', 'people', 'are', 'lying', 'down', 'open', 'spaces', 'become', 'something', 'else', 'naked', 'people', 'call', 'mind', 'photographs', 'Edward', 'Weston', 'when', 'shot', 'nudes', 'look', 'vegetables', 'and/or', 'fruit', 'take', 'quality', 'masterful', 'work', 'Sebastiao', 'Salgado', 'small', 'feat.People', 'particularly', 'Americans', 'Puritan', 'heritage', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'fascinated', 'naked', 'body', 'way', 'presented', 'Mr.', 'Tunick', 'documentary', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'different', 'photographing', 'nudes', 'read', 'be', 'called', 'artist', 'rather', 'photographer', 'Okay', 'Certainly', 'German', 'photographer', 'Henning', 'von', 'Berg', 'did', 'something', 'similar', 'smaller', 'scale', 'when', 'photographed', 'nude', 'men', 'Berlin', '1999', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'arrested', 'actions', 'Mr.', 'Tunick', 'several', 'times', 'New', 'York', 'artist', 'may', 'photograph', 'nude', 'woman', 'pubic', 'place', 'snake', 'head', 'shock', 'value', 'Joel-Peter', 'Witkin', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'established', 'grand', 'master', 'macabre', 'naked', 'body.Apparently', 'most', 'models', 'get', 'quite', 'kick', 'baring', 'One', 'man', 'interviewed', 'described', 'phenomenon', 'giving', 'third', 'finger', 'oppressive', 'society', 'artist', 'understand', 'also', 'attempted', 'make', 'statements', 'HIV/AIDS', 'photographing', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'HIV', 'positive', 'clothes', 'keeping', 'planet', 'green.These', 'photographs', 'would', 'work', 'best', 'either', 'seen', 'gallery', 'catalogue', 'are', 'worth', 'seeing', 'again', 'again']",Naked States
