His pantomimes of events are comedy classics and demonstrate that one can be extremely funny without saying a word.The three episodes in this DVD are:*) Freddie and the Spies - Freddie is given what is supposedly a powerful invention and is to hold it for safekeeping. It is a ruse designed to expose a ring of foreign spies, so Freddie is caught in the middle of international intrigue.*) Cauliflower goes Hollywood - Skelton plays an ex-fighter (Cauliflower) with a glass jaw who is auditioning for a part in a movie. Cauliflower's opponent in the movie is played by Vincent Price and they ""battle"" over the love of a Hollywood starlet.*) The U. N. show - Skelton does a series of pantomime sketches in front of a crowd of United Nations delegates and their families.This DVD is Skelton at his best and you can clearly see his comedic genius as he also ad-libs and plays to the crowd when things don't go according to the script. Several years ago, Skelton made news by criticizing modern comics for relying on swearing to get laughs rather than proper setups and timing. In many ways he is right, you appreciate his acts for his movements, expressions and he genuinely seems to be having fun. Many modern comics just seem angry.",5,The genius of Skelton whose facial expressions and timing will always be classic comedy,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,1469,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'variety', 'show', 'remembered', 'characters', 'such', 'Clem', 'Kadiddlehopper', 'Freddie', 'Freeloader', 'had', 'forgotten', 'effectiveness', 'smooth', 'choreography', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Skelton', 'pantomimes', 'events', 'are', 'comedy', 'classics', 'demonstrate', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'funny', 'saying', 'word.The', 'three', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', '*', 'Freddie', 'Spies', 'Freddie', 'given', 'what', 'supposedly', 'powerful', 'invention', 'hold', 'safekeeping', 'ruse', 'designed', 'expose', 'ring', 'foreign', 'spies', 'Freddie', 'caught', 'middle', 'international', 'intrigue', '*', 'Cauliflower', 'Hollywood', 'Skelton', 'ex-fighter', 'Cauliflower', 'glass', 'jaw', 'who', 'auditioning', 'part', 'movie', 'Cauliflower', 'opponent', 'movie', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'battle', 'love', 'Hollywood', 'starlet', '*', 'U.', 'N.', 'show', 'Skelton', 'series', 'pantomime', 'sketches', 'front', 'crowd', 'United', 'Nations', 'delegates', 'families.This', 'DVD', 'Skelton', 'best', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'comedic', 'genius', 'also', 'ad-libs', 'crowd', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'script', 'Several', 'years', 'ago', 'Skelton', 'made', 'news', 'criticizing', 'modern', 'comics', 'relying', 'swearing', 'get', 'laughs', 'rather', 'proper', 'setups', 'timing', 'many', 'ways', 'right', 'appreciate', 'acts', 'movements', 'expressions', 'genuinely', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'Many', 'modern', 'comics', 'just', 'seem', 'angry']",N/A

886479,A1BMKEJ61X57EU,B0007PCD6W,"Dr. W. G. Covington, Jr.","[1, 2]","To be straightforward, I was going to rate this DVD a 3 until I heard Red Skelton's concluding remarks before his audience at the United Nations. That caused me to realize his heart was in the right place. In essence he said if he'd offended anyone it wasn't his intent, that he thought that everyone was put here for a purpose and his was to make people laugh.The first two of these episodes are from his regular CBS television show, with the third being a special UN appearance. In ""Freddie and the Spies"" Red is the target of a manipulation plot by an attractive blonde spy. He is the hero and I won't spoil the ending by giving you the details.In the second episode, Vincent Price is a ""Hollywood"" type antagonist who confronts Cauliflower, played by Red. The plot unfolds in a boxing ring. Again, I'll refrain from giving details.The UN show is largely pantomine routines. There's a French narration to accompany the English version. My reason for originally thinking it only deserved a 3 rating was that some of the skits didn't seem to be as funny as I thought they'd be. Perhaps it was me. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind and need to loosen up.",4,Classic Comedy,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1162,"['be', 'straightforward', 'was', 'going', 'rate', '3', 'heard', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'concluding', 'remarks', 'audience', 'United', 'Nations', 'caused', 'realize', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place', 'essence', 'said', ""'d"", 'offended', 'anyone', 'was', ""n't"", 'intent', 'thought', 'everyone', 'was', 'put', 'here', 'purpose', 'was', 'make', 'people', 'laugh.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'regular', 'CBS', 'television', 'show', 'third', 'being', 'special', 'UN', 'appearance', 'Freddie', 'Spies', 'Red', 'target', 'manipulation', 'plot', 'attractive', 'blonde', 'spy', 'hero', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'giving', 'second', 'episode', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Hollywood', 'type', 'antagonist', 'who', 'Cauliflower', 'played', 'Red', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'boxing', 'ring', 'Again', ""'ll"", 'refrain', 'giving', 'details.The', 'UN', 'show', 'largely', 'pantomine', 'routines', 'French', 'narration', 'accompany', 'English', 'version', 'reason', 'originally', 'thinking', 'only', 'deserved', '3', 'rating', 'was', 'skits', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'as', 'funny', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'need', 'loosen', 'up']",N/A
886480,AY12DBB0U420B,B0007PCD6W,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","When I was a kid (in the late 40s) I used to just love Red Skelton movies. The ones I mean were ""shorts"" that came along with the showing of the regular theater movie. They were SO funny! He was by far my favorite comedian. I used to laugh until I cried. I know he had a later TV program, but we didn't have a TV and later, when we did, we couldn't get the right channel. In any case, I loved the old Red Skelton skits and I hope kids these days have such comic heroes. One day when I was browsing through the bargain bins in a video store, I found and bought ""Three Classic Episodes: The Red Skelton Show"" DVD. I have no idea how long I've had this DVD, perhaps on the order of five or six years. I re-found it in my DVD storage area while cleaning and viewed it last night for the first time.The three TV episodes consist of ""Freddie and the Spies,"" ""Cauliflower Gone Hollywood"" and ""The UN Show."" The DVD is crudely put together with intermixed black and white plus some color in between the skits. The sound quality is so-so and the picture quality is not particularly good. But, remember, these are old pre-color TV shows and high quality should not be expected. I did not particularly care for the skits. They were mildly amusing, but that's about it. A good single word review might be ""corny."" I doubt if I could bear to watch many more. Alas, nostalgia isn't what it used to be. These skits, and probably most of the others were great fun at the time, but just simply wouldn't go over with today's audiences. However, items like this are a ""blast from the past"" and may be of great interest and value to nostalgia collectors. I always think of my wife who just has to have everything that Shirley Temple ever turned out. Well, I feel apologetic to nostalgia buffs, especially since I really did love Red Skelton as a comedian, but I could not rate this DVD any higher than three stars.Gary Peterson",3,Great Fun At The Time.,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1907,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'late', '40s', 'used', 'just', 'love', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'movies', 'ones', 'mean', 'were', 'shorts', 'came', 'along', 'showing', 'regular', 'theater', 'movie', 'were', 'SO', 'funny', 'was', 'far', 'favorite', 'comedian', 'used', 'cried', 'know', 'had', 'later', 'TV', 'program', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'TV', 'later', 'when', 'did', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'channel', 'case', 'loved', 'old', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'skits', 'hope', 'kids', 'days', 'have', 'such', 'comic', 'heroes', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'browsing', 'bargain', 'bins', 'video', 'store', 'found', 'bought', 'Three', 'Classic', 'Episodes', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Show', 'DVD', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'order', 'five', 'six', 'years', 're-found', 'DVD', 'storage', 'area', 'cleaning', 'viewed', 'last', 'night', 'first', 'time.The', 'three', 'TV', 'episodes', 'consist', 'Freddie', 'Spies', 'Cauliflower', 'Gone', 'Hollywood', 'UN', 'Show', 'DVD', 'crudely', 'put', 'together', 'intermixed', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'skits', 'sound', 'quality', 'so-so', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'remember', 'are', 'old', 'pre-color', 'TV', 'shows', 'high', 'quality', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'did', 'not', 'particularly', 'care', 'skits', 'were', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'good', 'single', 'word', 'review', 'might', 'be', 'corny', 'doubt', 'could', 'bear', 'watch', 'many', 'more', 'Alas', 'nostalgia', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'skits', 'probably', 'most', 'others', 'were', 'great', 'fun', 'time', 'just', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'today', 'audiences', 'However', 'items', 'are', 'blast', 'past', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'interest', 'value', 'nostalgia', 'collectors', 'always', 'think', 'wife', 'who', 'just', 'have', 'everything', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'ever', 'turned', 'out', 'Well', 'feel', 'apologetic', 'nostalgia', 'buffs', 'especially', 'really', 'did', 'love', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'comedian', 'could', 'not', 'rate', 'DVD', 'higher', 'three', 'stars.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

It must have been great working on television in those early days when things were live and not taped. Red Skelton was one of America's great comedians and the greatest American pantomimist. He came from an era of entertainment so different from our current pop culture. It's so refreshing to watch these shows and see how much better sketch comedy used to be (the current Saturday Night Live crew could learn a lot from watching Red). Red always kept the audience laughing and he didn't mind breaking the fourth wall to talk to the audience or break out of character to get the extra laugh. He was a treasure and this DVD is one great way to preserve his memory and our cultural heritage.",5,Classic Television Comedy At It's Best.,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,821,"['Lucille', 'Ball', 'may', 'have', 'paved', 'way', 'set', 'standard', 'sitcom', 'television', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'set', 'standard', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'working', 'television', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'live', 'not', 'taped', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'was', 'one', 'America', 'great', 'comedians', 'greatest', 'American', 'pantomimist', 'came', 'era', 'entertainment', 'so', 'different', 'current', 'pop', 'culture', 'so', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'shows', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'used', 'be', 'current', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'crew', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'watching', 'Red', 'Red', 'always', 'kept', 'audience', 'laughing', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'talk', 'audience', 'break', 'character', 'get', 'extra', 'laugh', 'was', 'treasure', 'DVD', 'one', 'great', 'way', 'preserve', 'memory', 'cultural', 'heritage']",N/A
