272584,A2S166WSCFIFP5,6301928334,"adead_poet@hotmail.com ""adead_poet@hotmail.com""","[1, 2]","What this movie is most famous for is Nick Cage eating a live cockroach (actually, he ate two, but only one appears in the film), when what it should be known for is the fact that it was so far ahead of its time. It's a black comedy that appeared before the big run on dark comedies (had it appeared a mere five years later, it wouldn't have been cutting edge). Peter Loew (Cage) is such a bad person, that we can't help but laugh at what he says and the things he does, as horrible as they may be. On the surface the film appears to be about madness, but really, loneliness is at its core. We can identify with what Loew feels, if not what he does. The dvd contains a commentary track with Cage and director Robert Bierman, who hadn't gotten together to talk about the film in 11 years. And as great as the movie is, the commentary is just as wonderful. You get insight into the making of the film (and an understanding of the horrible accent Cage uses in the film), and hearing them laugh along with you at the horridness of Loew just adds to the experience. It's a great film, and though sparse, a great dvd.",4,would you eat a roach?,1043366400,"01 24, 2003",2003,1111,"['What', 'movie', 'most', 'famous', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'eating', 'live', 'cockroach', 'actually', 'ate', 'two', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'when', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'known', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'black', 'comedy', 'appeared', 'big', 'run', 'dark', 'comedies', 'had', 'appeared', 'mere', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Peter', 'Loew', 'Cage', 'such', 'bad', 'person', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'what', 'things', 'as', 'horrible', 'may', 'be', 'surface', 'film', 'be', 'madness', 'really', 'loneliness', 'core', 'can', 'identify', 'what', 'Loew', 'feels', 'not', 'what', 'dvd', 'commentary', 'track', 'Cage', 'director', 'Robert', 'Bierman', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'together', 'talk', 'film', '11', 'years', 'as', 'great', 'movie', 'commentary', 'just', 'as', 'wonderful', 'get', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'understanding', 'horrible', 'accent', 'Cage', 'film', 'hearing', 'horridness', 'Loew', 'just', 'experience', 'great', 'film', 'sparse', 'great', 'dvd']",N/A
272585,A3G7WL27MW8QXI,6301928334,Alfred Viola,"[2, 3]","I saw this film back when it was released theatrically.  It was written by Joseph Minion, the writer of After Hours and Motorama and I was already a huge fan of his!  After Hours and Motorama were both filled with references to Kafka, and I knew this one would be no different.I was a bit disappointed with some of the production elements...  I think the lighting and coverage are very unimaginative and stagey, and they don't seem to be that way on purpose.  Just a bit amateurish really.  And some of the performances also seem a bit misguided (Jennifer Beals awkwardly overacts in a few scenes.  Some of the extras also stick out like sore thumbs.)But what absolutely redeems the film, aside from the totally brilliant screenplay, is the phenomenal, gutsy performance by Nicholas Cage.  I was both in awe and in stitches!  There are so many sequences in the film that have retained classic status to me, such as when he is petulantly pouting about his assistant's terrible work, and he goes through the whole alphabet, A, B, C... leading up to an insane climax.Somebody wrote that it was fascinating to watch his madness and I absolutely agree!  This is such an odd and eclectic film; it's at once an extremely dark comedy, a fascinating character study and a tragedy.  I do wish that it had been directed by somebody with a little more flair.  Man, if the Coen Brothers could have done this one, it would have been absolutely fabulous!But again, for the wildly brilliant performance by Cage and the imaginative, moving screenplay this film gets five stars from me!",5,one of Nicholas Cage's very best performances...,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,1568,"['saw', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'was', 'written', 'Joseph', 'Minion', 'writer', 'Hours', 'Motorama', 'was', 'already', 'huge', 'fan', 'Hours', 'Motorama', 'were', 'filled', 'references', 'Kafka', 'knew', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'different.I', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'production', 'elements', 'think', 'lighting', 'coverage', 'are', 'very', 'unimaginative', 'stagey', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'way', 'purpose', 'Just', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'really', 'performances', 'also', 'seem', 'bit', 'misguided', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'awkwardly', 'few', 'scenes', 'extras', 'also', 'stick', 'out', 'sore', 'thumbs', 'what', 'absolutely', 'film', 'aside', 'totally', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'phenomenal', 'gutsy', 'performance', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'was', 'awe', 'stitches', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'sequences', 'film', 'have', 'retained', 'classic', 'status', 'such', 'when', 'petulantly', 'pouting', 'assistant', 'terrible', 'work', 'whole', 'alphabet', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'leading', 'up', 'insane', 'climax.Somebody', 'wrote', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'madness', 'absolutely', 'agree', 'such', 'odd', 'eclectic', 'film', 'once', 'extremely', 'dark', 'comedy', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'tragedy', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'somebody', 'little', 'more', 'flair', 'Man', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'again', 'wildly', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Cage', 'imaginative', 'moving', 'screenplay', 'film', 'five', 'stars']",N/A
272586,A1SSA0MF161794,6301928334,Ava Barbi,"[1, 2]","Peter Loew is the tormented protagonist of Vampire's Kiss, the 1988 cult classic from director Robert Bierman that combines quirky comedy with Kafkaesque neo-noir.  Loew is a Philly-born literary agent in the foreign-distribution division of an unnamed Manhattan publishing house, who's obsessed about an old contract.  Despite his yuppified money and status, he simply wants to be loved and to experience a long-lasting relationship.  Prince of the one-night stand, perhaps, but he doesn't want to become the Prince of Darkness!  He isn't searching for an eternal bond.The irony of Vampire's Kiss is that Loew desires love - and sees a therapist for help with that emotion - but is too shallow.  Each time, he winds up only boasting to his therapist (portrayed by Elizabeth Ashley) about his nighttime sexual exploits.  Therefore, love eludes him.  For example, he's seen engaging in a promising romantic relationship with an attractive, culture-loving woman (portrayed by Kasi Lemmons, a decade before she transitioned from acting to brilliant directing), but moments after getting very amorous, he becomes transfixed and turned on by a bat that is circling the room.  Paradoxically, while it takes deep puncture wounds from a vampire to render him immune to love's salvation, those very bites turn him batty.Nicolas Cage as Peter Loew is a sight to behold, and he eerily embodies his eccentric, vulnerable character.  From his spazzed-out gesticulations and manic speech delivery to his bizarre spurts of rage, Cage's Loew is a case study of the lack of meaningful human connection and its contribution to escalating insanity.  The setup of Vampire's Kiss presents him as a man who's antisocial, arrogant, stingy and misogynistic down to the bone, and only in the light of day can the deep bites inflicted upon him blind his superficial view of women and of life in general.Jennifer Beals deserves special mention for sinking her fangs into a delectable role.  Vamping it up for the camera, a post-Flashdance Beals portrays a bloodthirsty barfly (make that ""barbat"") who manipulates Loew into her object of desire.  Obsessive and bicuspid, she alters his destiny in measured erotic doses that are at turns gratifying and gross to watch.An absorbing subplot in Vampire's Kiss concerns sexual harassment. How the movie delves into the issue is not only disturbing but also disarming.  The protagonist's predatory behavior with his secretary, portrayed by the versatile actress Maria Conchita Alonso, is delivered in an absurdly repetitious and hilarious manner.  I've read reviews that indicate Alonso's character, Alva, was raped by Cage's Loew, but after watching Vampire's Kiss too many times to admit here, I totally disagree.  Loew tore off her clothing, and, yes, that was violent.  However, considering how depersonalized and despairing he becomes as the film further develops, I believe that he was trying to provoke an assisted suicide.I also don't believe that the storyline involving the worksite tension between Loew and Alva is a distracting subplot.  That storyline runs parallel to Loew's descent into utter derangement, and his repetitious - and abusive - demand to see the contract is a device that writer Joseph Minion employs to reveal Loew's expanding insanity.  For comparison, recall how Jack Nicholson's writer in The Shining gradually slipped into madness by having to repeatedly stop composing the beginning of his novel because his wife continually interrupted his concentration.  In that sense, Loew's loss of patience with Alva's incompetence (i.e., it's not as though the ""contract"" doesn't exist) and its violent consequences are similar to the Nicholas character's verbal abuse of his wife, to whom he frighteningly demands, ""Give me the bat, Wendy.""In Vampire's Kiss, prior to Loew developing his supernatural condition, he was behaving erratically at the office.  Now, however, his actions -- and the film's humor - veer deeper into dark territory, to the point that the viewer isn't so sure whether to laugh or turn sympathetic.  For example, he starts wearing shades by day inside the workplace, performs an existential monologue in front of mirrors in the men's restroom, and -- after he grows impatient waiting for his fangs to develop -- purchases a set of plastic fangs in Chinatown instead of expensive fiberglass prosthetics.  After fully accepting his new bad-boy image, he forces his new identity on anyone willing to notice.  In one scene in a diner, he disparages a patron who is bragging to her girlfriend about a hansom cab marriage proposal.  In another scene he runs through the streets of Manhattan, lisping through fake fangs and yelling at the top of his lungs:  ""I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!""However, being a vampire isn't all that it's hyped to be.  Sure, he's got the '80s metrosexual look and a job in a skyscraper, but he's afraid of flying - that is, of fully living his life.  He's so emasculated that he can't manage to metamorphose into a bat.  Later on, he carries a big stick but doesn't have the level of testosterone required to work it.  What remains human about him is a tortured being reduced to chasing cockroaches in his brownstone apartment and pigeons on the sidewalk in order to satiate his newfound appetite.As Loew's character transforms more dramatically with the plot, he finds that the greatest conflict is within himself because no matter how hard he tries to fit into society, he fails.  That his fake, plastic fangs don't fit comfortably into his mouth was a brilliant metaphor.  Fated to be alienated, ever the outsider, he learns what it really means to be a vampire.When modern life sucks, a vampire's kiss leads to eternal suffering.P.S.  For those who are nostalgic for New York City's 1980s club scene, you'll want to pay attention to the band jamming at the beginning of Vampire's Kiss.  It's the minimalist funk band ESG performing ""Moody,"" which is not only a classic dance song but also a ""puntastic"" clue to Peter Loew's inevitable journey into madness.",5,"When Love's at Stake,

And he does a terrible accent in this movie. His acting has gotten better because in here it's just lousy. He plays crazy well but in here it could have been better.He is a man named Peter Loew who is a publishing executive and he's bit by a vampire (or so he thinks) one night while he takes this woman Rachel (played by Jennifer Beals) home to his apartment for what he thinks will be casual sex, but while they are making out on his bed she bites him on the neck and then basically through out the film he terrorizes Alva when he's at work and he basically goes nuts. Rachel is not even real, she's a figment of his imagination. He finally gets to the point where he truly believes he's a vampire so he goes to a store and buys cheap fangs. Hmmm, okay.

272590,A18NB6VKNXHV7O,6301928334,"Chris D. Bates ""Dave, the Man!!!""","[3, 5]","This was one of the first five DVDs a friend of mine bought after he got a player, and so I was curious about his choice. The things he chooses may not be perfect, but are invariably very interesting, as it turned out with this one. The only thing I knew about this movie beforehand was that it's supposed to be a 'comedy,' and that Nicholas Cage eats a cockroach in it. So it was hard for me to understand why someone would be so passionate about what seemed like a goofy 80s comedy, but it turns out that this film is much more than that.Nicholas Cage, back when he was young and adventurous and before he fully committed himself to his strict ""Bad Movies Only"" policy, plays a socially retarded man with serious issues toward woman and more than a little inadequacy as he slowly descends into utter insanity. Interestingly, the way he conceives of his problem is that really he is turning into a vampire.The opening photography is wonderful, silhouetted spires and gothic details of Manhattan against a blood red sky, that seem to reveal the city as a place of dark supernatural horrors within the regular city we know, which was a great start.I was surprised in reading the reviews on the IMDb that no one talks about the place that misogyny plays in Cage's dementia... he's lonely and isolated and sees women as objects, so as he goes insane he thinks he's a vampire, someone who picks up young women, rapes [bites] and kills them... and is cursed by this. In this movie, the main character HATES women, and a lot of the audience's discomfort comes from how horrible he is to them. I thought it was also ingenious how all the women; his therapist, the imaginary vampire woman, the woman he jilts near the beginning, and his secretary all look vaguely alike. The director could easily have thrown in a bit of psychoanalytic depth by having a photo of the character's mother looking similar as well.There are things in this movie that are vaguely funny on their own, but in the context of the movie are not really funny at all. I mean yeah, people do goofy things as they are mentally breaking apart, but is that funny? All the actors do a great job, but I love the therapist, who seems so engaged and curious. I like how Cage's character assumes the movements of movie vampires, because in his lunacy movie vampires are probably exactly what he is imitating.There are only two problems I think the film has. The film goes out of its way to show how Alva, the abused secretary, needs her job and is not supported by her family, but Cage's behavior is SO over the top that ANYONE would know that she has a lot of reason to go to the police. That she remains so passive is a little frustrating and unrealistic to the point where it detracts from the film.The big problem, I think, is that ramping up so quickly to high insanity in the first hour, there's really nowhere for the film to go in it's last 45 minutes. The scenes of Cage humiliating his secretary become repetitive, as do other aspects, tarnishing what started out exceedingly well.I was shocked to learn that this was the director's first full feature, as it is very assured and well-done.

272591,A1G0EBQYLN6STU,6301928334,Cinephiliac,"[12, 15]","I tend to view Nicolas Cage's film career as split somewhat down the middle.  There is 'interesting and edgy young Nicolas Cage' who turned in odd--if not downright weird--performances in minor films.  Sometimes these performances worked against the grain of the film, however, they were always riveting.  Then there is 'mainstream Nicolas Cage' who, after winning his Academy Award, tended to make safer choices as a leading man or a heroic figure.  Cage's work has always been solid and intelligent, but his acting choices have lost much of their original maverick appeal.Cage plays Peter Loew, an elitist and pretentious literary agent at a publishing house.  Loew fancies himself a ladies' man, but in fact leads a rather cold and lonely life.  Loew also speaks with a strange and completely contrived accent, which he feels will make him more interesting to people.  Unfortunately, most people only find this annoying--virtually guaranteeing Loew's inability to connect with anyone in a meaningful way.  One night, after picking up a beautiful woman (Jennifer Beals), Loew brings her home for what turns out to be a rather violent sexual encounter.  When the woman delivers a savage bite to his neck, Loew becomes convinced that she is a vampire and that he will now become a vampire as well.  Thus begins Loew's spiral into madness.Alva (played to perfection by Maria Conchita Alonso) is Loew's beleaguered and bullied secretary, who finds herself becoming the focus of Loew's escalating and alarmingly inappropriate behavior.  He rages at her over the smallest error, verbally abusing her as no other boss has ever abused his secretary.  He chases her down the hall, even following her into the ladies' bathroom.  Even after Alva completes the petty Herculean task Loew had assigned her, he responds by telling her ""It's too late,"" and then brutally assaulting her.  (Possibly my favorite scene in the film is where Loew leaps up onto a table, points his finger at Alva in a wildly exaggerated gesture, and shouts ""THERE YOU ARE!"" while she cringes in absolute terror.  Although there is nothing intrinsically funny about bullies or mental illness, Cage's over-the-top performance imbues the film with the surrealistic qualities of a Max Fleischer cartoon.)As Loew completely unravels mentally, Cage still allows you to see glimpses of the frightened man behind the madness.  Cage conveys Loew's complete despair at his inability to stop himself.  In many ways, Loew is a distant cousin to Patrick Bateman, the psychotic protagonist in American Psycho.  As Loew devolves into his paranoid fantasies and delusional behavior, he becomes increasingly dangerous to everyone around him.Whether he is chasing couples down the street screaming ""I'M A VAMPIRE!"" or attacking and killing a girl in a night club with a pair of ludicrous novelty vampire teeth, this is Cage at his most bizarrely entertaining.  I loved this darkly satirical tale of insanity, but I realize it is not for everyone.  However, if you are up for a walk on the weird side, this film just might be a perfect fit.",4,And you thought your boss was bad!,1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,3085,"['tend', 'view', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'film', 'career', 'split', 'somewhat', 'down', 'middle', ""'interesting"", 'edgy', 'young', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'turned', 'odd', 'not', 'downright', 'weird', 'performances', 'minor', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'performances', 'worked', 'grain', 'film', 'however', 'were', 'always', 'riveting', 'Then', ""'mainstream"", 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'who', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'tended', 'make', 'safer', 'choices', 'leading', 'man', 'heroic', 'figure', 'Cage', 'work', 'always', 'been', 'solid', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'choices', 'have', 'lost', 'much', 'original', 'maverick', 'appeal.Cage', 'plays', 'Peter', 'Loew', 'elitist', 'pretentious', 'literary', 'agent', 'publishing', 'house', 'Loew', 'fancies', 'ladies', 'man', 'fact', 'rather', 'cold', 'lonely', 'life', 'Loew', 'also', 'strange', 'completely', 'contrived', 'accent', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'interesting', 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'people', 'only', 'find', 'annoying', 'virtually', 'guaranteeing', 'Loew', 'inability', 'connect', 'anyone', 'meaningful', 'way', 'One', 'night', 'picking', 'up', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Beals', 'Loew', 'home', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'violent', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'When', 'woman', 'savage', 'bite', 'neck', 'Loew', 'convinced', 'vampire', 'will', 'now', 'become', 'vampire', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', 'Loew', 'spiral', 'madness.Alva', 'played', 'perfection', 'Maria', 'Conchita', 'Alonso', 'Loew', 'beleaguered', 'bullied', 'secretary', 'who', 'becoming', 'focus', 'Loew', 'escalating', 'alarmingly', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'smallest', 'error', 'verbally', 'abusing', 'other', 'boss', 'ever', 'abused', 'secretary', 'down', 'hall', 'even', 'following', 'ladies', 'bathroom', 'Even', 'Alva', 'petty', 'Herculean', 'task', 'Loew', 'had', 'assigned', 'her', 'telling', 'too', 'late', 'then', 'brutally', 'assaulting', 'Possibly', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'where', 'Loew', 'up', 'table', 'finger', 'Alva', 'wildly', 'exaggerated', 'gesture', 'THERE', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'absolute', 'terror', 'nothing', 'intrinsically', 'funny', 'bullies', 'mental', 'illness', 'Cage', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'film', 'surrealistic', 'qualities', 'Max', 'Fleischer', 'cartoon', 'Loew', 'completely', 'unravels', 'mentally', 'Cage', 'still', 'see', 'glimpses', 'frightened', 'man', 'madness', 'Cage', 'conveys', 'Loew', 'complete', 'despair', 'inability', 'stop', 'many', 'ways', 'Loew', 'distant', 'cousin', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'psychotic', 'protagonist', 'American', 'Psycho', 'Loew', 'paranoid', 'fantasies', 'delusional', 'behavior', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'everyone', 'around', 'him.Whether', 'chasing', 'couples', 'down', 'street', 'screaming', ""'M"", 'VAMPIRE', 'attacking', 'killing', 'girl', 'night', 'club', 'pair', 'ludicrous', 'novelty', 'vampire', 'teeth', 'Cage', 'most', 'bizarrely', 'entertaining', 'loved', 'darkly', 'satirical', 'tale', 'insanity', 'realize', 'not', 'everyone', 'However', 'are', 'up', 'walk', 'weird', 'side', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'perfect', 'fit']",N/A

This is not about vampires at all; its a psychological analysis of one man's descent into complete insanity.  The vampire bit is just there to remind us that he has lost his marbles.As the lead guy who goes insane, Cage is incredible!  He starts out a sophisticated and eccentric book editor.  By the end of the movie he's a blubbering and foaming maniac.  His conversation with the cement stairway railing endpost on the streets of New York is one of the funniest and strangest scenes ever.

Although his character really believes he's a vampire and gives it the old ""college try"", his pathetic effort fails moronically and laughably.  Obviously, his character never read an Anne Rice novel.Cage is not a sympathetic character and in the end he gets exactly what he wants and justly deserves.Cages' acting is wonderful!

Even though it is from the late eighties, it's a timeless gem, and when I need a good laugh, it's there. Just like New Yorker character yuppie literary genius, Peter says, ""It never goes away"".Mind you, this is not a vampire movie, but a satirical view on a lonely young man that has ""everything"" falling apart. It all begins when he's getting ready to go to work and cuts himself shaving, and somehow he distortedly begins to think sex vixen Jennifer Beals who's supposedly a vampire bit him. From that point on it's a steady downward spiral of peculiar and weird scenarios to come; his personality becomes more erratic and his actions unpredictable and bizarre to say the least. He begins showing up to work in a suit, but no socks, becomes photophobic, and begins picking on his Cuban secretary played by Maria Conchita Alonso.One of my favorite scenes is when he is at the psychiatrist office and he is standing on the ledge of the high-rise window holding a wooden stick, and he tells her he's going to go out there and find real love. The infamous scene when he eats the cockroach is a little disturbing, but you know they paid him good money to do so, but that's a good one too. I don't want to give the movie away since you must see it.At times while watching the movie, or at least the first time, you wonder what's real and what isn't, and it's a pit perturbing however at the end you can figure it out.Vampire's kiss is a satire about psychosis, and as you see, it doesn't care if you have a prestigious job or if you're a genius.Every time I see a N.

272615,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6301928334,Only-A-Child,"[2, 6]","Most movies can be described as mixes of other movies, as most everything has been done before and it often appears that the only way to appear original is to cross the same elements in different ways. Of course there are a lot of possible outcomes depending largely on who is doing the mixing. ""Vampire's Kiss"" is one of the less appealing outcomes of mixing Polanski's ""Repulsion"" and Kubrick's ""The Shining"".It was one of the a few perfect roles in Jennifer Beals' career. Beals is physically attractive in a kind of misaligned way, making her perfect for this role, as well as for ""Flashdance"" and ""The Bride"". Her features seem at war with each other, they do not quite fit making her a walking-talking prop for dissidence. Which means she is ideal for characters that are not quite right, like a dancer-welder or a man-made woman, or in this case a fabricated vampire. I'm not sure if the directors of her three successful performances instinctively picked up on this feature when she was cast. If so, and if there were more of these perceptive directors out there, she would have been used more and used better.The ""trailer"" leads you to believe that this is a horror film/dark comedy, and this deception is one of the reasons for its poor box office showing. There is some humor in Peter Loew's (Nicholas Cage) gradual decent into madness; particularly his rant to his psychiatrist (Elizabeth Ashley) about the misfiling of contracts. And his scenes berating his secretary Alva (a great performance by Maria Conchita Alonso) are excessive enough to be funny; if you laughed at Jack Nicholson's self-parodying performance in ""The Shining"" you should enjoy Cage's antics here. But it will be a major disappointment for those looking to see a horror film and a minor one for those expecting a lot of comedy.In its favor, ""Vampire's Kiss"" looks far better than its less than $2 million budget. Director Robert Bierman did some first-rate directing, got fine performances from everyone in his cast, made creative use of a variety of NYC locations, and kept things in a unifying style. It's very nice work. The problem is the film has no substantial message to convey to its audience and is a little too intellectual to be just a suspense film (remember it is NOT supposed to be a horror film or a dark comedy).Bierman borrowed a lot from Polanski to set up increasingly discordant images and sounds to help advance the story. While much like ""Repulsion"", including the ambiguous question of whether madness causes or is caused by hallucinations/nightmares, ""Vampire's Kiss"" fails to convey any substantive basis for Peter's susceptibility to madness. So Cage's character only manages to convince us that he knows how to act mad-not that he is actually going mad. Although ""Repulsion"" did not disclose much about the root cause of the madness (at least not until the end), Polanski was able to get a performance out of Catherine Deneuve that convinced you her madness was real.Bottom line, this is well made film with excellent performances but the story could have been a lot better, could have been told more effectively, and could have been promoted more honestly.Then again, what do I know?

272622,A1VQ4V2I0VIJA4,6301928334,"""songlife""","[31, 35]","This movie is a must-see for those who appreciate black comedy done well, and superbly acted.Cage carries the entire movie on his shoulders, and it's one of the rare times you'll see someone do that comedically with 100% success. His portrayal of Peter Loew, one of the weirdest characters in movie history, is truly a tour-de-force. There's a scene near the end that knocks me out every time: he carries on a delusional conversation with a wall, hallucinating other people and their reactions. The scene uses surrealism  perfectly. Reminds me somewhat of Lindsay Anderson's classic films, like ""If..."" or ""O Lucky Man"", in which bizarre surrealism would often be injected into otherwise normal scenes - and it always worked because there were never any clear explanations for it written into the script. Viewers have to figure it out for themselves. (Although, as DVD commentary often reveals, usually the directors have no idea what it means either!) That's why I like well-done allegories - they require thought. Anyway, the part where Cage talks to the wall is a masterpiece. It's sidesplittingly funny as he mumbles his crazy responses to his own ghosts, yet sad and frightful at the same time, considering he's just killed a person and has blood all over his face and clothes. It works equally as well as he thereafter walks down the streets of New York with a wooden stake in his hand, screaming at his nonexistent girlfriend, while real sidewalkers (not extras) walk by, not even paying attention this babbling, insane man who is in fact Nicholas Cage performing what was perhaps the best scene of his career! This, as well as many of his other scenes in the film (such as his crazed recitation of the alphabet), were Oscar material in my opinion. It just doesn't get any better than that. His performance runs circles around Jack Nicholson's similar man-going-insane role in ""The Shining"". Jack, too, went over the top, but the difference is, he went way overboard, and too quickly, so it doesn't work. Compare Jack's phony-sounding ""Here's Johnny!"" remark at the height of his insanity to Nick's realistic rantings in the latter part of the film.Unfortunately, too many people saw it as hammy overacting, and criticized this film. To them I say, ""How good could YOU have done in this role?!"" They missed the point. It IS overacting, but it was done intentionally and successfully, and to pull that off requires tremendous talent. To run down a street shouting ""I'm a vampire!"" over and over may not seem like Oscar material, but it's the hammy way he does it that actually makes it work. It, and the many scenes like it in which Cage goes WAY over the top, are signs of true comedic genius, which, sadly, seems to have remained unexplored as his career has gone on. Forget the infamous cockroach-eating scene, that's just incidental and not worthy of all the bad press it got. There are far too many treasures in the film to focus on that brief scene.This movie was done when black comedies were not in fashion, and way too many people never 'got it'. This film won't work for people who demand the typical mainstream fodder. It works as both a comedy and an allegory (the allegory being vampirism for loneliness and alienation). There's barely a scene when Cage is not doing something very funny, especially in the scenes where he improvised totally nonscripted quirks for Peter Loew. But because there are some harsher scenes of murder, violence, mental torture, psychic sadism, and rape, viewers feel afraid to laugh - even though those darker parts are pretty tame. Primarily, this movie is a comedy. It's okay to laugh, because that's why Cage was jumping on desks, smashing furniture, and talking in a very affected accent - to make us laugh! That same weird accent that grates on some people's nerves just cracks me up. There's not too many movies you'll see where it's actually hilarious when a guy puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. That's just not funny, but Cage somehow made it humorous. (His strange cry of ""boohoo"" there is my favorite line in the movie).The supporting cast is also superb; dedicated actors who gave spot-on performances, like Kasi Lemmons and Maria Conchita Alonso. When you see a quirky, unusual, well-made film like this, it's easy to realize just how bad the mainstream movies. It's not tired cliches and hackneyed jokes that are funny, it's the *delivery* of lines that aren't normally considered funny. Nick doesn't have a single 'joke' per se in this movie, yet he's hilarious every second.This DVD is a real treat. It contains a few scenes that were not in the final cut, so although it's not advertised as being a 'director's cut', it really is. The commentary with Cage and the director is consistently funny and interesting. They noth chuckle frequently at Cage's antics. Cage reveals that most of what he was doing was either improvised before the cameras, or thought up in his hotel room the night before. The director imparts various tidbits about the filming. The one negative thing about the commentary is that the director talks nonstop throughout, rudely interrupting Cage constantly in mid sentence. I'd rather hear what Nick has to say, but he can barely get a word in as the director rambles on as each scene unfolds. Fortunately, Nick is a patient, polite person and the crosstalk is little.I hope someday, perhaps with this release, and considering the commercial direction Cage's career has gone, the film will get the recognition it deserves.",4,"A classic, and Cage's best performance",1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,5520,"['movie', 'must-see', 'who', 'appreciate', 'black', 'comedy', 'done', 'well', 'superbly',
