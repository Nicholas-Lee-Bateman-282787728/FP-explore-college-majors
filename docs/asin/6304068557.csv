The only other possible reason is being a Broncos fan and seeing all that classic Broncos merchandise with their best emblem. Brought back some good memories of old Mile High Stadium. You really appreciate Denver's old uniforms with this movie. After all, the Broncos have had the worst uniforms in any sport since 1997. It's a decent family movie. Most of all for kids. After all, that's their target audience, kids from 3-12 years of age.",3,Good movie to watch with my 3 year old,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,516,"['son', '3', 'watching', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'see', 'only', 'other', 'possible', 'reason', 'being', 'Broncos', 'fan', 'seeing', 'classic', 'Broncos', 'merchandise', 'best', 'emblem', 'Brought', 'back', 'good', 'memories', 'old', 'Mile', 'High', 'Stadium', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Denver', 'old', 'uniforms', 'movie', 'Broncos', 'have', 'had', 'worst', 'uniforms', 'sport', '1997', 'decent', 'family', 'movie', 'Most', 'kids', 'target', 'audience', 'kids', '3-12', 'years', 'age']",Bingo VHS

Although I agree with some of the reviewers about the profanity in the movie I would like to point out that it is no more than many other so-called kids' movies these days---which says a lot about the state of society today. If you were to remove the profanity, I think that most reviewers would give this a five star rating, it was that funny.",4,Heel!,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,429,"['liked', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'had', 'lot', 'original', 'gags', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'profanity', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'more', 'many', 'other', 'so-called', 'kids', 'movies', 'days', '-which', 'lot', 'state', 'society', 'today', 'were', 'remove', 'profanity', 'think', 'most', 'reviewers', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'funny']",Bingo VHS
399147,A30CZB6BX494JG,6304068557,"blackturtle ""blackturtle.us""","[1, 1]","I purchased ""Bingo"" and ""My Dog Skip"" at the same time. Both movies seemed sort of episodic, but both were fairly entertaining. I wound up liking ""Bingo"" a lot more though since it was funny. Some of the comedy was a little outlandish (sort of like something you'd expect from movies like ""Naked Gun,"" ""Airplane,"" or ""Scary Movie.""), but some of the gags were downright hillarious. At times this movie seemed to be a movie about a boy and his dog and at other times it was more like the dog was the main focus. Since comedy was actually the main focus of this movie, this is forgiveable, but the movie seemed somewhat incoherent at times. While ""My Dog Skip"" erred on the side of the corny and sentimental, ""Bingo"" was filled with lots of strong comedy (and a few lame jokes too). So, if you want to have fun and see a movie about a boy and a dog, see ""Bingo"" and skip the other movie!",4,Funny Dog Movie,1147564800,"05 14, 2006",2006,885,"['purchased', 'Bingo', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'same', 'time', 'movies', 'seemed', 'sort', 'episodic', 'were', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'wound', 'up', 'liking', 'Bingo', 'lot', 'more', 'was', 'funny', 'comedy', 'was', 'little', 'outlandish', 'sort', 'something', ""'d"", 'expect', 'movies', 'Naked', 'Gun', 'Airplane', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'gags', 'were', 'downright', 'hillarious', 'times', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'movie', 'boy', 'dog', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'more', 'dog', 'was', 'main', 'focus', 'comedy', 'was', 'actually', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'forgiveable', 'movie', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'incoherent', 'times', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'erred', 'side', 'corny', 'sentimental', 'Bingo', 'was', 'filled', 'lots', 'strong', 'comedy', 'few', 'lame', 'jokes', 'too', 'So', 'want', 'have', 'fun', 'see', 'movie', 'boy', 'dog', 'see', 'Bingo', 'skip', 'other', 'movie']",Bingo VHS

Unfortunately, it isn't as great as the other films that I've watched when I was a kid (like The Land Before Time & Flight of the Navigator). It's very average for an animal flick.
