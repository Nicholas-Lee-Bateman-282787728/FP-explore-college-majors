788136,A3CSNLAVBM2E87,B0000WN15O,"Claud E. Morris ""CEM, Flickerfan""","[0, 0]","Two sisters escape from foster homes and live vagabond lives after the death of their mother.  The older girl has a habit of meeting teenage boys at playgrounds and under bleachers.  She puts off admitting that she has become pregnant just as long as she can.  The sisters find it natural to kidnap a woman who clerks at a maternity shop, thinking they have found someone whose expertise they need.  Wrong on that point, they [u]do[/u] have a person with a capacity for giving care that works to their advantage.  She, in turn, benefits because she has a need to be needed.  By the time a baby boy is born on a blanket beside a car in the woods, they have merged into something like a family.  Some fun, and a demonstration of the best of possibilities when people need people.  MVP of the story is 11-year-old Scarlett Johansson, at the beginning of her career, as the younger sister.  Sometimes serving as narrator, she is actually the most level-headed of the three main characters.",5,Orphaned Sisters Kidnap Themselves a Mother.,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,985,"['Two', 'sisters', 'escape', 'foster', 'homes', 'live', 'vagabond', 'lives', 'death', 'mother', 'older', 'girl', 'habit', 'meeting', 'teenage', 'boys', 'playgrounds', 'bleachers', 'admitting', 'become', 'pregnant', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'sisters', 'find', 'natural', 'kidnap', 'woman', 'who', 'maternity', 'shop', 'thinking', 'have', 'found', 'someone', 'expertise', 'need', 'Wrong', 'point', '[', 'u', ']', 'do', '[', '/u', ']', 'have', 'person', 'capacity', 'giving', 'care', 'advantage', 'turn', 'benefits', 'need', 'be', 'needed', 'time', 'baby', 'boy', 'born', 'blanket', 'car', 'woods', 'have', 'merged', 'something', 'family', 'fun', 'demonstration', 'best', 'possibilities', 'when', 'people', 'need', 'people', 'MVP', 'story', '11-year-old', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'beginning', 'career', 'younger', 'sister', 'Sometimes', 'serving', 'narrator', 'actually', 'most', 'level-headed', 'three', 'main', 'characters']",N/A
788137,A1HEX4P1LFSZ1M,B0000WN15O,Dame Derevko,"[0, 0]","Manny and Lo is an endearing independent film that at it's core is also an unconventional ""family"" film where two orphaned girls on the lam from the foster system named Amanda and Laurel or Manny and Lo who are wonderfully played by the very young Scarlett Johansson and Aleksa Palladino respectively  decide to ""borrow"" a family's vacation home after being weary from their many travels on their mother's old car, sleeping where ever they deem fit, even model homes. The girls then decide to kidnap a lonely baby supply shop clerk named Elaine played by Mary Kay Place after Lo discovers she's unexpectedly pregnant. Elaine at first tries to escape her constraints, but it soon becomes apparent that she's warming up to the girls ensuring they eat healthy meals etc. and after a while quits trying to escape, even willing to protect them as well when the owner of the house shows up out of the blue, there the hostage takes her own hostage... Manny is warmed by this rare display of loyalty on Elaine's part, but when Lo finds out she is quite freaked as she was considering making Elaine her baby's adoptive mother. Things seem to go bleak from there, but fortunately it all works out for the best and maybe just maybe all three will find the happiness, fulfillment and family they need and want in life. The DVD is seemingly out of print and has only trailers as special features, but nonetheless I was glad to find it at a great price courtesy of Noram International Partners Inc. where the service has been excellent.",5,A Sweet And Unconventional Family Film,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,1522,"['Manny', 'Lo', 'endearing', 'independent', 'film', 'core', 'also', 'unconventional', 'family', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'orphaned', 'girls', 'lam', 'foster', 'system', 'named', 'Amanda', 'Laurel', 'Manny', 'Lo', 'who', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Aleksa', 'Palladino', 'respectively', 'decide', 'borrow', 'family', 'vacation', 'home', 'being', 'weary', 'many', 'travels', 'mother', 'old', 'car', 'sleeping', 'where', 'ever', 'deem', 'fit', 'even', 'model', 'homes', 'girls', 'then', 'decide', 'kidnap', 'lonely', 'baby', 'supply', 'shop', 'clerk', 'named', 'Elaine', 'played', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Lo', 'unexpectedly', 'pregnant', 'Elaine', 'first', 'tries', 'escape', 'constraints', 'soon', 'apparent', 'warming', 'up', 'girls', 'ensuring', 'eat', 'healthy', 'meals', 'etc', 'while', 'trying', 'escape', 'even', 'willing', 'protect', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'owner', 'house', 'up', 'blue', 'hostage', 'own', 'hostage', 'Manny', 'warmed', 'rare', 'display', 'loyalty', 'Elaine', 'part', 'when', 'Lo', 'out', 'quite', 'freaked', 'was', 'considering', 'making', 'Elaine', 'baby', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Things', 'seem', 'go', 'bleak', 'there', 'fortunately', 'out', 'best', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'three', 'will', 'find', 'happiness', 'fulfillment', 'family', 'need', 'want', 'life', 'DVD', 'seemingly', 'print', 'only', 'trailers', 'special', 'features', 'nonetheless', 'was', 'glad', 'find', 'great', 'price', 'courtesy', 'Noram', 'International', 'Partners', 'Inc.', 'where', 'service', 'been', 'excellent']",N/A

They kidnap a lady to help them with the child's birth.  I wasn't really a fan of the movie but it was nice watching Scarlett Johansson in her younger years.  I just did not like the story line.

They kidnap a nurse-type (Mary Kay Place) to help them with Lauren's pregnancy. The movie is a bit quirky and the dialog is quite good. The movie did not have any Oscar-caliber aspects to it, but it was entertaining, however.The DVD itself has a good image quality, but there were no features other than scene selection, and a trailer to 3 other movies.

The title characters are sisters who have no parents and are doing what it takes to survive. Manny is the younger sister who tries to see the good in things. Lo is the older sister who is pregnant and is in denial. I don't want to give the movie away, but anyone who enjoys a good Indie film will enjoy this film. Scarlett Johansson deliveries a heart-warming performance as Manny, while Aleksa Palladino gives a credible performance as the tough, street-smart Lo, and Mary Kay Place is excellent as a lonely nurse who the girls come in contact with.",5,Indie film at its best,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,647,"['looked', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'finally', 'found', 'purchased', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'title', 'characters', 'are', 'sisters', 'who', 'have', 'parents', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'survive', 'Manny', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'see', 'good', 'things', 'Lo', 'older', 'sister', 'who', 'pregnant', 'denial', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'movie', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'Indie', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'heart-warming', 'performance', 'Manny', 'Aleksa', 'Palladino', 'credible', 'performance', 'tough', 'street-smart', 'Lo', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'excellent', 'lonely', 'nurse', 'who', 'girls', 'come', 'contact']",N/A
