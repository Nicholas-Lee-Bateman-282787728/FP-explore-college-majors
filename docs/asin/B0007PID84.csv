886721,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B0007PID84,Alex Udvary,"[6, 8]","One of the characters early on in the film calls Walter ""damaged goods"". We can sense that Walter (Kevin Bacon) has some demons in his closet. We know he has just been released from prison after serving 12 years, for what we do not know yet. That is of course assuming you have not heard about the film in advance. I had, but, it's important to try and forget, otherwise you'll be two steps ahead of the film.Walter rapped little girls. But, here is the amazing thing Kevin Bacon does with this role, he made me feel sympathy towards him. We may not like Walter's past but somehow, there are scenes when we like Walter. The beauty of the screenplay, which was written by Steven Fechter and first time director Nicole Kassell, is we never see the acts committed by Walter. Why is this good? Because one of the reason we feel anything towards Walter is due to the fact we cannot identify him with the act. There are celebrities who get in trouble with the law, some even face the same charges Walter does, and people stand by these celebrities, why? Because they can't believe these celebrities are capable of such acts, therefore, we cannot believe Walter, who seems like such a nice guy, is capable of such acts.Kevin Bacon is someone I've never thought too highly of. But here in ""The Woodsman"" I have to admit he handles the role quite well. It's difficult playing this kind of role and making an audience feel sorry for him because it goes against everything we believe. Having seen Bacon in the role I'm having difficulty thinking of someone else whom could have played the part.The director of the film Nicole Kassell is someone I hope continues to make films. Her previous work included a short film called ""The Green Hour"" about a married woman with childern who must come to term with her sexuality. Kassell seems to like movies where characters have dark secrets and must go on living with these demons. She likes soul searching films, luckily so do I. This also leads me to wonder why there are not more female directors. Yes we have Jane Campion (""The Piano""), Jill Spreecher (""13 Conversations About One Thing"") and Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") but none of them are well known. I'm a film major and my classes are dominated with male students. Usually we have at most 5 females in a 25 student class. Why aren't there more women directors?The movie co-stars Kyra Sedgwick (Bacon's real life wife), Eve, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt and David Alan Grier.""The Woodsman"" does a wonderful job dealing with a controversial subject. It doesn't take sides and tell us what to think. We never suggest we should forgive Walter nor does it suggest we should condemn him. It merely shows us the struggle he goes through to try and balance his life and move on. Some of the scenes more harrowing moments deal with Walter and a young girl named Robin. Here we can see the battle going on inside Walter. These are some of the most gripping moments I have seen in a movie because we don't want to see Walter fail. When was the last time we could say we cared so much about such an unlikeable character? Bravo Kevin Bacon!Bottom-line: Well paced, well acted, wonderfuly directed film about tough issues. Never preachy. Straight forward and honest, and that's why I like it.",4,"Bad Things Happen In The ""Woods""",1113609600,"04 16, 2005",2005,3268,"['One', 'characters', 'early', 'film', 'Walter', 'damaged', 'goods', 'can', 'sense', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'demons', 'closet', 'know', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'serving', '12', 'years', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'yet', 'course', 'assuming', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'film', 'advance', 'had', 'important', 'try', 'forget', 'otherwise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'film.Walter', 'rapped', 'little', 'girls', 'here', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'role', 'made', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Walter', 'past', 'somehow', 'are', 'scenes', 'when', 'like', 'Walter', 'beauty', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Steven', 'Fechter', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Nicole', 'Kassell', 'never', 'see', 'acts', 'committed', 'Walter', 'Why', 'good', 'one', 'reason', 'feel', 'anything', 'towards', 'Walter', 'due', 'fact', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'act', 'are', 'celebrities', 'who', 'get', 'trouble', 'law', 'even', 'face', 'same', 'charges', 'Walter', 'people', 'stand', 'celebrities', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'celebrities', 'are', 'capable', 'such', 'acts', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'Walter', 'who', 'nice', 'guy', 'capable', 'such', 'acts.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'someone', ""'ve"", 'never', 'thought', 'too', 'highly', 'here', 'Woodsman', 'have', 'admit', 'role', 'quite', 'well', 'difficult', 'playing', 'kind', 'role', 'making', 'audience', 'feel', 'sorry', 'everything', 'believe', 'Having', 'seen', 'Bacon', 'role', ""'m"", 'having', 'difficulty', 'thinking', 'someone', 'else', 'whom', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'part.The', 'director', 'film', 'Nicole', 'Kassell', 'someone', 'hope', 'make', 'films', 'previous', 'work', 'included', 'short', 'film', 'called', 'Green', 'Hour', 'married', 'woman', 'childern', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'term', 'sexuality', 'Kassell', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'dark', 'secrets', 'must', 'go', 'living', 'demons', 'soul', 'searching', 'films', 'luckily', 'so', 'do', 'also', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'female', 'directors', 'have', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'Piano', 'Jill', 'Spreecher', '13', 'Conversations', 'One', 'Thing', 'Catherine', 'Hardwicke', 'Thirteen', 'none', 'are', 'well', 'known', ""'m"", 'film', 'major', 'classes', 'are', 'dominated', 'male', 'students', 'Usually', 'have', 'most', '5', 'females', '25', 'student', 'class', 'Why', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'women', 'directors', 'movie', 'co-stars', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Bacon', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'Eve', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Woodsman', 'wonderful', 'job', 'dealing', 'controversial', 'subject', ""n't"", 'take', 'sides', 'tell', 'think', 'never', 'suggest', 'should', 'forgive', 'Walter', 'suggest', 'should', 'condemn', 'merely', 'struggle', 'try', 'balance', 'life', 'move', 'scenes', 'more', 'harrowing', 'moments', 'deal', 'Walter', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Robin', 'Here', 'can', 'see', 'battle', 'going', 'Walter', 'are', 'most', 'gripping', 'moments', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Walter', 'fail', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'could', 'say', 'cared', 'so', 'much', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'Bravo', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Bottom-line', 'Well', 'paced', 'well', 'acted', 'wonderfuly', 'directed', 'film', 'tough', 'issues', 'Never', 'preachy', 'Straight', 'forward', 'honest', 'why']",The Woodsman
886722,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B0007PID84,Alistair McHarg,"[10, 12]","By treating them like adults, able to witness unsentimental reality with open eyes and minds, this film pays viewers the ultimate compliment.  The Woodsman is a searing character study certain to prompt serious, troubling, and important questions.  Unlike so many movies that treat sexuality, even grotesque sexuality, like a commodity, tinsel to be casually strewn about the set, there is absolutely nothing sexual about The Woodsman.  It is one man's tale, told calmly, deliberately, and without prejudice.The director, Nicole Kassell, does not invite sympathy or contempt; she simply lets Walter's life unfold through a series of small, carefully constructed scenes, each giving way to the next with the minimalist precision of a play.  Newly out of prison, having served his sentence for a crime involving pedophilia, Walter is now faced with the unimaginably difficult challenge of finding a way back into society.  Bacon is a consistently workmanlike actor who is never bad, usually good, and almost never great.  (His porcine nose, ironically appropriate considering his name, makes him inappropriate for leading man roles reliant on good looks.)  However, The Woodsman finds Bacon delivering the performance of a lifetime, made palpable because his craft is almost completely invisible.All of Walter's rage, self-loathing, fear of the outside world, fear of himself, shame, pain, regret, and sorrow boil beneath his desperately controlled persona, deceptively shy and laconic.  Vickie, real life wife Kyra Sedgwick, is excellent as the one person who slips through the veneer and touches this damaged, and damaging, human soul.  Mos Def is equally on point as Walter's parole officer, casually expressing the contempt every viewer feels, inviting us to speculate just how vigorously we might express that contempt.That Walter vents his self-hatred by acting out and terrorizing another of his kind, that his secret is discovered at work leading to cruel repercussions, that he must face his inner darkness once more (in the movie's most heartbreaking and spellbinding scene); these are merely plot points.  There's very little story here, very little action, not even much in the way of resolution.  What there is in its place is genius, on so many levels.  Script, acting, directing, even cinematography.The Woodsman is a blunt and quiet picture about a difficult subject relayed with an austere sensibility.  This is what movie making could be - if movies were made by adults, for adults.

886727,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0007PID84,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","THE WOODSMAN is a real tough luck story.Walter (Kevin Bacon) is a convicted child molestor released on probation after serving 12 years of a life sentence. After returning to his hometown, Walter's rehired at a lumberyard based on a previous good work record there. Even living across the street from a nmiddle school, Walter keeps out of trouble. Things seem to be going well until this overly nosy secretary, played by one-named ""Eva,"" finds out Walter's secret, prints his rap sheet off the internet and hands out copies to everyone at work. ""They have a right to know"" is her justification.Naturally he becomes the target of threats, violence and in one instance, an act of sabotage that could've seriously injured Walter if he didn't notice the nail driven into a board he was making slices in with a radial arm saw. Enraged, Walter leaves his job after this near incident.Walter's life isn't totally bleak. He's got a girlfriend (Kyra Sedgwick) who wants Walter to move in with her. Vickie has her own reasons: three older brothers who ""poked"" her (to used the character's words), ""in chronological order."" She just wants to understand what makes guys behave inappropriately with young girls. So perhaps these two complete each other.He's also keeping an eye on a molester of young boys. An eventual confrontation with this guy is the story's dramatic highlight.For anyone concerned with the unsavory background of this film's main character, the only genuinely repulsive moment is when Walter has Vickie sit on his lap, just like he did with all those sweet young things in the old days. You get a non-explicit idea of how he pleasured himself-- apparently via auto-eroticism, nothing that involved intimate contact with the child's body. Vickie however, is sickened at the thought that her boyfriend may still be ""that way."" It's an issue they have to immediately sort out.""The Woodsman"" ultimately makes us sympathetic to the plight of an ex-con trying to put his life straight, a man that going in you'd never imagine caring one whit about.

The subject of pedophelia is seldom dealt with, and when it is, the perpetrator is usually portrayed as an evil sicko. ""The Woodsman"" follows the life of a released pedophile (Kevin Bacon), and though he is sick the movie never really passes any judgement and simply lets the viewer in on his mundane life and his attempts at intimacy, normalcy and rehabitulation.Kevin Bacon has been extremely effective in quite a few movies; ""The Stir of Echoes"", ""Murder in the First"" and ""JFK"", but never has his thin pursed lips and blank expression been used so effectively. He sometimes appears like a walking time-bomb and maybe that's what it's like to not be in control of one's obsessions, and you wonder if he is.His crimes are never really explained but his habit of following young girls and his discussions with his shrink fill in some gaps. Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as his tough girlfriend, who has some secrets of her own, and the rest of the cast is uniformally good, particularly Mos Def (his parole officer), who somehow manages to be compassionate despite his understandable disgust.The movie is not for every taste and there is one squirm inducing scene, but its' view of humanity and the struggles of people to hang on to it is quite rewarding.Kevin Bacon can be an intense actor, but I'm beginning to miss his lighter comedic side. He's got such a winning smile but appropriately, in this movie, it only emerges when he appears the most comfortable, and that's when he's talking to a lonely young girl.",5,"Rewarding, but not for everyone.",1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,1757,"['year', 'when', 'big', 'controversy', 'was', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'courage', 'actors', 'filmmaker', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'truly', 'was', 'controversial', 'contained', 'one', 'bravest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'performances', 'year', 'subject', 'pedophelia', 'seldom', 'dealt', 'when', 'perpetrator', 'usually', 'portrayed', 'evil', 'sicko', 'Woodsman', 'life', 'released', 'pedophile', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'sick', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'judgement', 'simply', 'viewer', 'mundane', 'life', 'attempts', 'intimacy', 'normalcy', 'rehabitulation.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'been', 'extremely', 'effective', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Murder', 'First', 'JFK', 'never', 'thin', 'pursed', 'lips', 'blank', 'expression', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'effectively', 'sometimes', 'walking', 'time-bomb', 'maybe', 'what', 'not', 'be', 'control', 'one', 'obsessions', 'wonder', 'crimes', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'habit', 'following', 'young', 'girls', 'discussions', 'shrink', 'fill', 'gaps', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'excellent', 'tough', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'secrets', 'own', 'rest', 'cast', 'uniformally', 'good', 'particularly', 'Mos', 'Def', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'somehow', 'manages', 'be', 'compassionate', 'understandable', 'disgust.The', 'movie', 'not', 'taste', 'one', 'squirm', 'inducing', 'scene', 'view', 'humanity', 'struggles', 'people', 'hang', 'quite', 'rewarding.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'can', 'be', 'intense', 'actor', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'miss', 'lighter', 'comedic', 'side', 'got', 'such', 'winning', 'smile', 'appropriately', 'movie', 'only', 'when', 'most', 'comfortable', 'when', 'talking', 'lonely', 'young', 'girl']",The Woodsman
886730,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,B0007PID84,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[3, 5]","Other reviews have synopsized this unnerving film already, so I will skip to why this movie is recomended viewing for everyone, especially parents. The point being made is that pedophiles and sexual predators exist in all of our neighborhoods, and these creeps are not necessarily the weirdo who jumps out of a bush in a raincoat. They could be your next-door neighbor, your co-worker, or even the guy who seems to like hanging out in front of the elementary school talking to little boys.Perhaps most people already know this, and just don't want to think about the frightening ramifications. Others may not want to see such disturbing subject matter because they go to the movies to be ""entertained."" Reality is unavoidable, no matter how much we may want to bury our heads in the sand. These people do exist, and they do horrible things to children. While we don't have to ponder this reality until we're paranoid, knowledge and awareness are powerful tools we can use to keep our children safe.This movie does not try to elicit sympathy for Kevin Bacon's character, a convicted child molester. In fact, he is quite a despicable individual. Rather, the filmmakers want to show you that he is not a monster, but a human being who may live in your neighborhood, which is of course more terrifying. The scenes depicting the child predator called ""Candy"" tempting and setting up little boys was illuminating and horrifying at the same time. The more we know how these people function, the better equipped we can be in protecting our children.The scene with Bacon and the little girl in the park is heartbreaking. Bacon gives one of his best perfomances portraying such a loathsome character. Mos Def is very credible in his portrayal of the police sergeant who keeps dropping in on Bacon to ""keep an eye on him."" His sentiments are true to most police officers and having him speak these feelings, no matter how cruel or hateful, is a fine touch of realism.A bleak, fascinating film that needs to be seen.",4,Hiding In Plain Sight,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,2004,"['Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'synopsized', 'unnerving', 'film', 'already', 'will', 'skip', 'why', 'movie', 'recomended', 'viewing', 'everyone', 'especially', 'parents', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'pedophiles', 'sexual', 'predators', 'exist', 'neighborhoods', 'creeps', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'weirdo', 'who', 'bush', 'raincoat', 'could', 'be', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'co-worker', 'even', 'guy', 'who', 'like', 'hanging', 'out', 'front', 'elementary', 'school', 'talking', 'little', 'boys.Perhaps', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'frightening', 'ramifications', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'such', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'matter', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'Reality', 'unavoidable', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'may', 'want', 'bury', 'heads', 'sand', 'people', 'do', 'exist', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'children', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'ponder', 'reality', ""'re"", 'paranoid', 'knowledge', 'awareness', 'are', 'powerful', 'can', 'use', 'keep', 'children', 'safe.This', 'movie', 'not', 'try', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'convicted', 'child', 'molester', 'fact', 'quite', 'despicable', 'individual', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'show', 'not', 'monster', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'may', 'live', 'neighborhood', 'course', 'more', 'terrifying', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'child', 'predator', 'called', 'Candy', 'tempting', 'setting', 'up', 'little', 'boys', 'was', 'illuminating', 'horrifying', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'know', 'how', 'people', 'function', 'better', 'equipped', 'can', 'be', 'protecting', 'children.The', 'scene', 'Bacon', 'little', 'girl', 'park', 'heartbreaking', 'Bacon', 'one', 'best', 'perfomances', 'portraying', 'such', 'loathsome', 'character', 'Mos', 'Def', 'very', 'credible', 'portrayal', 'police', 'sergeant', 'who', 'dropping', 'Bacon', 'keep', 'eye', 'sentiments', 'are', 'true', 'most', 'police', 'officers', 'having', 'speak', 'feelings', 'matter', 'how', 'cruel', 'hateful', 'fine', 'touch', 'realism.A', 'bleak', 'fascinating', 'film', 'be', 'seen']",The Woodsman
886731,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0007PID84,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 7]","If ever there was a film to make you squirm, both internally and externally, this is it.While watching this amazing little flick (90 minutes), my moral compass was spinning around as if I were standing at the North Pole - that's an acutely direct compliment to the acting and production of this movie but not necessarily its subject matter: the redemption of a pedofile.As many of us would want, if we ever caught up with a child molester, we'd love to beat the cr@p out of him. Beat him to a pulp for stealing away the innocence of a child. Try to pound some moral sense into him (even in prison child molesters are held as subhuman and often beaten or killed.) But can we be judge, jury, and executioner - in any personal moral sense - because of what we ""think we know"" about a person and their serious societal flaws? These are tough questions which are all thrown at the viewer of ""The Woodsman"". Notice I said ""thrown at"" and not ""forced upon"". That's an important distinction. For not once did I feel that the script was trying to be sympathetic to criminals, police, or our society. The film shows you the good AND the bad of all of these.The story flows around a recently paroled child molester, Walter (Kevin Bacon), who now lives in a dumpy apartment in ""anywhere"" USA. But problems immediately arise for Walter: his apartment, the only one that would allow him in, is directly across from a grade school playground; a cop comes by to harass him and tell him what a scumbag he still is; someone at his job finds out about his past and begins distributing flyers about him; and a child stalker (nicknamed ""Candy"") is prowling near the playground while Walter watches him with both disgust and anguish.Throughout the film we also see Walter visiting his court appointed therapist, who asks tough questions, and Walter replies with equal brusqueness. He continually asks his therapist ""When will I be normal?"", feeling the weight of his ""illness"" every minute of every day. And this is an important set of narratives, because we see Walter wanting to be normal, we can feel the internal battle within him as he struggles with his past and his more uncertain future.Added to the film is an attractive co-worker, Kyra Sedgwick (Kevin Bacon's real life wife), who becomes a strange kind of girlfriend that Walter MUST confide in at some point. And when he finally does tell her why he was in prison, you could cut the tension surrounding both of them with a knife. I found myself holding my breath, waiting for her to respond to his history.But if I held my breath for a moment there, I literally stopped breathing when Walter follows a young girl into a park and begins speaking with her. By this time in the film, most viewers probably are cheering for Walter to succeed in becoming a normal member of his community. We've felt the terrible pedofile lust trying to move away from this flawed man, and we're happy for him. But society won't leave him alone, and now he seems to be slipping back into some horrible old habits. Or is he? Can this child he follows into the park help ""The Woodsman"" be redeemed? It's amazing to me, too, that the title of the film is ""The Woodsman"". This is the tale of Little Red Riding Hood who is cut from the Wolf's belly and removed unscathed. And the little girl Walter follows into the park, if you watch closely, is wearing a little red cape.I'm going to leave my review here, as I don't want to give away too much more about what happens in the park (the pivotal moment of the film). But I will say that this is a terribly uncomfortable film to watch, which is why you should. If you want to feel challenged in any real moral sense, this movie is your best bet.",5,Spinning Our Moral Compass,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,3706,"['ever', 'was', 'film', 'make', 'squirm', 'internally', 'externally', 'it.While', 'watching', 'amazing', 'little', 'flick', '90', 'minutes', 'moral', 'compass', 'was', 'spinning', 'around', 'were', 'standing', 'North', 'Pole', 'acutely', 'direct', 'compliment', 'acting', 'production', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'subject', 'matter', 'redemption', 'pedofile.As', 'many', 'would', 'want', 'ever', 'caught', 'up', 'child', 'molester', ""'d"", 'love', 'beat', 'cr', '@', 'Beat', 'pulp', 'stealing', 'away', 'innocence', 'child', 'Try', 'pound', 'moral', 'sense', 'even', 'prison', 'child', 'molesters', 'are', 'held', 'subhuman', 'often', 'killed', 'can', 'be', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'personal', 'moral', 'sense', 'what', 'think', 'know', 'person', 'serious', 'societal', 'flaws', 'are', 'tough', 'questions', 'are', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'Woodsman', 'Notice', 'said', 'thrown', 'not', 'forced', 'important', 'distinction', 'not', 'once', 'did', 'feel', 'script', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'criminals', 'police', 'society', 'film', 'good', 'bad', 'these.The', 'story', 'around', 'recently', 'paroled', 'child', 'molester', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'now', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'anywhere', 'USA', 'problems', 'immediately', 'arise', 'Walter', 'apartment', 'only', 'one', 'would', 'allow', 'directly', 'grade', 'school', 'playground', 'cop', 'harass', 'tell', 'what', 'scumbag', 'still', 'someone', 'job', 'out', 'past', 'distributing', 'flyers', 'child', 'stalker', 'nicknamed', 'Candy', 'prowling', 'playground', 'Walter', 'disgust', 'film', 'also', 'see', 'Walter', 'visiting', 'court', 'appointed', 'therapist', 'who', 'tough', 'questions', 'Walter', 'replies', 'equal', 'brusqueness', 'continually', 'therapist', 'When', 'will', 'be', 'normal', 'feeling', 'weight', 'illness', 'minute', 'day', 'important', 'set', 'narratives', 'see', 'Walter', 'wanting', 'be', 'normal', 'can', 'feel', 'internal', 'battle', 'past', 'more', 'uncertain', 'future.Added', 'film', 'attractive', 'co-worker', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'who', 'strange', 'kind', 'girlfriend', 'Walter', 'MUST', 'confide', 'point', 'when', 'finally', 'tell', 'why', 'was', 'prison', 'could', 'cut', 'tension', 'surrounding', 'knife', 'found', 'holding', 'breath', 'waiting', 'respond', 'history.But', 'held', 'breath', 'moment', 'there', 'literally', 'stopped', 'breathing', 'when', 'Walter', 'young', 'girl', 'park', 'speaking', 'time', 'film', 'most', 'viewers', 'probably', 'are', 'cheering', 'Walter', 'succeed', 'becoming', 'normal', 'member', 'community', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'terrible', 'pedofile', 'lust', 'trying', 'move', 'away', 'flawed', 'man', ""'re"", 'happy', 'society', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'now', 'be', 'slipping', 'back', 'horrible', 'old', 'habits', 'Can', 'child', 'park', 'help', 'Woodsman', 'be', 'redeemed', 'amazing', 'too', 'title', 'film', 'Woodsman', 'tale', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'who', 'cut', 'Wolf', 'belly', 'removed', 'unscathed', 'little', 'girl', 'Walter', 'park', 'watch', 'closely', 'wearing', 'little', 'red', 'cape.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'leave', 'review', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'park', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'terribly', 'uncomfortable', 'film', 'watch', 'why', 'should', 'want', 'feel', 'challenged', 'real', 'moral', 'sense', 'movie', 'best', 'bet']",The Woodsman
886732,A2MUD2VY9HWFXQ,B0007PID84,Boggman!,"[4, 5]","Bravo, Bravo, Bravo! ""The Woodsman"" is a great human drama! I had read so many reviews that this movie was ""disturbing"" and that it ""sympathized with child molesters""??? What a load of garbage!Some people just don't know how to interpret a film in the way it is meant to be represented. It seems like every time a film is made that tackles ""real life issues""; people duck and cover-or worse, they start criticizing and tearing it down.Simply put, this movie is brilliant...and I will explain why:""The Woodsman"" is about ADDICTIONS, not pedophiles. A pedophile is used as a metaphor in this film, but the underlying message of the movie is all about addiction.A lot of people have addictions that may not be good for them or for others that surround them. In fact, everyone has at one point succumbed to temptation of one sort or another.  Some people have addictions that hurt themselves or the people around them, and others have ""healthier"" addictions that don't hurt anybody. But we all have them. Some smoke, drink, steal, compulsively lie, or even abuse others. Some people get in trouble for not being able to resist their temptations; and therefore may pay the heavy and well deserved price. People who DO succumb to their not-so-healthy addictions often find a way to learn to cope with them. However; some people NEVER learn to resist their addictions-and pay throughout their lives without ever learning the meaning of self control.Keep that in mind while watching ""The Woodsman"". Because that is what this film is REALLY about-a man who is trying to resist his addictions and the temptation he feels after regaining a chance to join society after being released from prison.I'm not going to tell the story of ""The Woodsman"" in this review, because no matter what could be said in writing, this is a movie that should be watched and experienced for yourself.This is not a film for children, or people looking for mindless action or comedy. This is a REAL drama. An adult, honest, and fantastic movie that just soars.Kevin Bacon is such a brilliant actor. Here is a movie star millionaire who could do any kind of movie he wants. The fact that he will work for NOTHING and take on such roles as this- just proves his dedication to the craft of acting and of film making. Kevin and his wife Kyra Sedgwick also helped to finance this little film and get it off the ground.""The Woodsman"" is the best movie I have ever seen with a husband and wife team acting together. Normally, two married (or even dating) actors is a recipe for disaster in a movie. These two play SO well off each other in these gritty roles that as the viewer you will completely forget that they have been married for years and that they are very successful Hollywood movie stars.This movie should have gotten some Oscars, or at least some nominations. The ""Academy"" just really sucks sometimes! To nominate such movies as ""Finding Neverland"" or ""The Aviator"" and their male leads and to have ignored Kevin Bacon and ""The Woodsman"" only goes to show how far Hollywood has NOT come in recognizing fantastic works of art.I loved this movie. It was captured beautifully. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended for people who consider themselves intelligent movie goers that like honest, well written, and extremely well acted films.",5,Skeletons in the closet.....,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,3294,"['Bravo', 'Bravo', 'Bravo', 'Woodsman', 'great', 'human', 'drama', 'had', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'disturbing', 'sympathized', 'child', 'molesters', 'What', 'load', 'garbage', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'interpret', 'film', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'represented', 'time', 'film', 'made', 'real', 'life', 'issues', 'people', 'duck', 'cover-or', 'worse', 'start', 'criticizing', 'tearing', 'down.Simply', 'put', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'will', 'explain', 'why', 'Woodsman', 'ADDICTIONS', 'not', 'pedophiles', 'pedophile', 'used', 'metaphor', 'film', 'underlying', 'message', 'movie', 'addiction.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'addictions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'others', 'surround', 'fact', 'everyone', 'one', 'point', 'succumbed', 'temptation', 'one', 'sort', 'people', 'have', 'addictions', 'hurt', 'people', 'others', 'have', 'healthier', 'addictions', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'anybody', 'have', 'smoke', 'drink', 'steal', 'compulsively', 'lie', 'even', 'others', 'people', 'get', 'trouble', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'resist', 'temptations', 'therefore', 'may', 'pay', 'heavy', 'well', 'deserved', 'price', 'People', 'who', 'DO', 'succumb', 'not-so-healthy', 'addictions', 'often', 'find', 'way', 'learn', 'cope', 'However', 'people', 'NEVER', 'learn', 'resist', 'addictions-and', 'pay', 'lives', 'ever', 'learning', 'meaning', 'self', 'control.Keep', 'mind', 'watching', 'Woodsman', 'what', 'film', 'REALLY', 'about-a', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'resist', 'addictions', 'temptation', 'regaining', 'chance', 'join', 'society', 'being', 'released', 'prison.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'story', 'Woodsman', 'review', 'matter', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'writing', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'experienced', 'yourself.This', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'people', 'looking', 'mindless', 'action', 'comedy', 'REAL', 'drama', 'adult', 'honest', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'just', 'soars.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'such', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'Here', 'movie', 'star', 'millionaire', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'kind', 'movie', 'fact', 'will', 'work', 'NOTHING', 'take', 'such', 'roles', 'this-', 'just', 'dedication', 'craft', 'acting', 'film', 'making', 'Kevin', 'wife', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'also', 'helped', 'finance', 'little', 'film', 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'Woodsman', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'acting', 'together', 'Normally', 'two', 'married', 'even', 'dating', 'actors', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'movie', 'two', 'play', 'SO', 'well', 'other', 'gritty', 'roles', 'viewer', 'will', 'completely', 'forget', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'years', 'are', 'very', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'stars.This', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'Oscars', 'least', 'nominations', 'Academy', 'just', 'really', 'sometimes', 'nominate', 'such', 'movies', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'Aviator', 'male', 'leads', 'have', 'ignored', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Woodsman', 'only', 'show', 'how', 'far', 'Hollywood', 'NOT', 'come', 'recognizing', 'fantastic', 'works', 'art.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'captured', 'beautifully', 'HIGHLY', 'HIGHLY', 'recommended', 'people', 'who', 'consider', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'goers', 'like', 'honest', 'well', 'written', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'films']",The Woodsman

886739,A231ZCJGWZA38A,B0007PID84,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[5, 5]","It's absolutely consternating to read how other reviewers get important details of the story wrong or don't get the gist of it at all.  Have they really seen this film, or are they just writing reviews based on their personal disgust of the subject matter?  The point of the story is that it's just a story.  It wasn't made to promote pedophilia.  It doesn't directly condemn, but it certainly doesn't condone.  It doesn't preach, but then, it doesn't have to.  You and I know that what Walter did is wrong; even Walter knows what he did is wrong.  He hates himself for what he did and he's trying to change.The reviewer who complains that there are no ""normal"" men in the film obviously has not watched this film.  Walter's brother-in-law is clearly depicted as a model father who loves his children and who would protect them at all cost.  And Walter's coworkers certainly don't celebrate him when they find out about his past.  And later, when Robin cries at the thought of her father making her sit on his lap, it reminds us that child abuse is unfortunately everywhere; it is not always the result of an encounter with a trenchcoat-wearing stranger.  Finally, there's really no justifying the same reviewer's idiotic comment about Vicki taking in Walter so they can live happily ever after and subsequently have children that Walter can molest.  Where did THAT come from?  Some people just like to bitch, I guess.First, I have to give my most heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kevin Bacon.  After his truly wretched and idiotic ""Hollow Man"", I had dismissed him as just a two-bit actor.  He has redeemed himself a hundredfold with his amazing performance as Walter.  It can't be easy to give such a tortured performance, especially with a subject matter that most of us don't want to think about, let alone deal with.  I, too, am stunned that his performance was never, ever mentioned at Oscar time.Other reviewers here have given detailed synopses of the plot including, unfortunately, giving away some of the more important story details, so I won't do that here.  I will, however, clarify one reviewer's erroneous comment that Walter raped young girls.  He did not.  He specifically states that he never hurt them.  No, that's not supposed to make us feel better about him, but this is a very important distinction for him.  In his mind, he knows he's a bad man, but he's not THAT kind of bad man.Well worth watching, this film will remain with you long after you've put the DVD back in its case.  Also worthy of note, check out the featurette on how the film was made to see what the producers and filmmakers had to go through to get this film financed and made.  Truly a labor of love from all involved: even the actors worked for practically nothing.It's not often that you actually get to see an intelligent American film that is so rich in thought and emotion.

Slipman,"[1, 1]","Kevin Bacon is extremely effective in evoking empathy for one of the most despicable criminal types, the child molester, in the film he produced, ""The Woodsman"".Paroled after 12 years in prison, Bacon playing the pedophile Walter, is trying to reconstitute his decimated life.  He is scorned by his family with his brother in law Carlos, played by Benjamin Bratt being the only exception.  He manages to find employment in a lumberyard where he had previously worked for the sympathetic present owner's father.  He keeps to himself and eventually becomes involved with tough shelled but compassionate fellow worker Vicki played by his real life wife Kyra Sedgewick. We learn that she also has some repressed issues.Amazingly, Bacon lives in an apartment overlooking a schoolyard where temptation is within his view.  Even after 12 years he must battle to keep his everpresent internal demons at bay.  He is checked on periodically by police sergeant Lucas played nicely by Mos Def.  He peers through his window at the children playing while writing in a journal as suggested by his shrink.  While ruminating he becomes aware of a guy who he believes in stalking the children, plying them with goodies.Just as he begins to establish a life with some normalcy, lumberyard office worker Mary Kay played by rap star Eve finds out his secret while surfing the web.  She spills the beans via a flyer to her fellow co-workers causing conflict at the job.  This causes Bacon to become unsettled.  He follows a young girl who he had previously met in a park while she was birdwatching.In the most poignant scene in the film, Bacon who feels the need to accost the young girl, is using his smoothest lines to get over on the 11 year old girl Robin played well by Hannah Pikes.In the course of conversation it becomes apparent that the unfortunate child has already been subjected to abuse by her pathetic father.  This tear jerking scene snaps Bacon out of his pedophilic funk getting him back on track to the restoration of his life.Bacon went far out on a limb making a movie with such sensitive subject matter.

886741,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B0007PID84,Cubist,"[2, 2]","Kevin Bacon has had an interesting career to the say the least. In the `80s, he was being groomed as a leading man with Footloose but ended up rejecting these kinds of films in favour of memorable supporting roles in the `90s with the likes of JFK. In recent years, Bacon has gone back and forth from high profile gigs like Mystic River to meatier roles in independent films like The Woodsman.Kevin Bacon delivers a sensitive, intensely internalized performance. When we see him looking at the school grounds it doesn't take much to figure out what he's thinking about. The veteran actor does an excellent job of showing Walter's internal struggle as he tries to suppress the old urges and temptations. Walter is sick and he knows it. He asks his psychiatrist, ""When will I be normal?"" This could so easily be his mantra throughout the movie. All he wants is to lead a normal life and finally defeat his inner demons.There is a theatrical trailer.""Getting it Made"" is not exactly a Making Of featurette but rather an interview with the film's producer, Lee Daniels. He candidly reveals his aversion to the screenplay at first but after meeting with Kassell he agreed to make the movie.Also included are three deleted scenes, including one where Vickie proposes that she and Walter live together. Another one tries to define the attraction of little girls for Walter. There is some good footage here that shouldn't have been cut.Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Nicole Kassell.  This is a very knowledgeable and informative track as Kassell clearly did her homework and it shows in every frame of this movie.The characters are well-drawn, fully realized with smart dialogue and a deft touch at how the film's sensitive subject matter is depicted. Director Nicole Kassell gives it the proper amount of respect and seriousness that it deserves. There is never a false moment or feeling of mindless sensationalism. The film does a good job of getting inside Walter's head, showing us the world through his eyes and yet it gives insights into both sides: the perpetrator and the victim. It shows how both sides feel and the effects of physical abuse on them. The Woodsman doesn't try to judge Walter; leaving that up to the audience, but it does try to understand him and his sickness.

The film begins when Walter is released from serving 12 years in prison for his conviction as a sex offender, and he tries to make a new life for himself. He takes an apartment across the street from an elementary school (yes, a bad choice), and rides the bus to his job at a lumber yard. Except for his therapist, all those outside of and around Walter ostracize him as a monster and a freak. His sister refuses to talk to him or allow him to see his niece, a detective monitors his every move, and when his work colleagues discover his past they ""out"" him in a most bizarre way. Within himself another war rages. Neither Walter nor the viewer really knows to what extent he has moved beyond his past and is, therefore, safe. Involuntary hallucinations plague him, and poor choices born of habit implicate him. Three important sub-plots, all revolving around child molestation, contribute to Walter's unfolding narrative. Watching this film I was reminded of Faulkner's unnerving observation that ""the past isn't gone; it isn't even past.""

886745,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0007PID84,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","I was hesitant to watch this movie.  Especially given the seemingly nonstop litany of violent crimes committed by pedophiles in the past couple of years, one doesn't naturally gravitate toward a movie based upon a pedophile's attempt to reenter society.  Most of us don't want to have and most likely cannot possibly have the least bit of sympathy for any child molester, but this issue is more complex than I for one would like it to be - and The Woodsman gives evidence to this fact.  This is a movie people need to watch - it doesn't offer any real solutions, but it is extremely thought-provoking and can help us try to better understand the depths of what has become an epidemic preying on our children - and you can't solve a problem without understanding it first.  It is important to note that the main character here is not a level-three sex offender; he's not a monster, just a man with a very severe problem - one that he is trying to overcome.Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from prison, having served twelve years for molesting young girls.  We are never told exactly what his crimes involved, although he says he never hurt any of his victims.  He was fortunate to find a job at a lumber mill and a place to live (although, most troublingly, his apartment is across the street from an elementary school).  He sees a therapist every week and receives regular visits from a police detective, both of which are necessary because, no matter how much he wants to be normal, he still has terrible urges to fall back into his old ways.  Society doesn't make it easy for him, as those who learn of his past shun him or threaten him with violence - everyone except Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), who eventually comes to accept him as he is.  Everyone else treats him like a monster - and, when his emotional crisis hits its crescendo, he is driven to the brink of becoming exactly the kind of monster everyone already thinks he is.  There's no solution to this; society has to know about these people living amongst them, yet that widespread knowledge represents a brick wall in the subject's road to reform.  Again, I'm talking about understanding, not sympathy, here.  For any pedophile truly wanting to escape his urges and become normal, society as a whole offers an almost insurmountable challenge - that's just a fact.Kevin Bacon does an incredible job here - as does young Hannah Pilkes, whose acting in a pivotal scene is on par with Bacon's own.  Walter's problems are internalized for the most part, yet so much of what he goes through inside his own head communicates itself to the viewer through Bacon's nuanced performance.  Walter does want to be normal, but it is incredibly difficult for him to get to that point when he is basically left completely on his own.  His moments of weakness lead to some emotionally disturbing scenes (nothing graphic, of course - not even close); if you're not uncomfortable watching this movie, I would hope our paths never cross.  Don't avoid the film just because it makes you uncomfortable, though.  It's really a powerful story that culminates in an excellent ending - I won't describe it at all, but I must say it is really a fitting conclusion that builds upon the main character's struggles throughout the film.As someone who feels all sex offenders should be permanently removed from society at large, I can recommend the film even to those who - like me - see the problem in black and white terms.  This movie hasn't changed my way of thinking, but it has certainly made me think about the complexities of the problem and compelled me to look at someone such as Walter as a sick yet still very human individual.

Even murder  is deemed less heinous by comparison. This film is very interesting in that it shows what few of us could imagine, the twisted life and twisted mindset of a convicted child molester. He can no longer count on friends, family, the correctness of police, or even the neutrality of strangers; the entire world is his enemy. Kevin Bacon delivers an excellent performance, communicating the inner conflict and tension by grimace and body language alone, his character being ""a man of few words."" I like the sparse but effective script and the grim realism, totally devoid of phony, syrupy ""solutions to the problem"".If you're prepared for realistic drama, this is a really good one. Probably could be classified almost as a horror movie without special effects or supernatural junk. The thought that kept coming to mind is that this man would stick a gun in his mouth and just end it all. I am glad that did not happen, because suicide is the easy way out and does not do anyone any good.

886752,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B0007PID84,Erica Anderson,"[8, 9]","I have been anticipating to see ""The Woodsman"" for sometime now. I finally caught the afternoon matinee and loved it. This film was very subtle and didn't adhere to your typical introduction, suspenseful build-up and climatic ending. The film was intense yet subtle.Kevin Bacon puts in an amazing performance as Walter, a pedophile who was recently released from prison. He is trying to start a new life after serving 12 years for molesting a few young girls (I was under the impression that it was three but I could be wrong). Unfortunately the only apartment that he could get was across the street from a elementary school. This alone tests Walter and his inner demons. Real-life spouse Kyra Sedgewick puts in a equally wonderful performance as Walter's girlfriend/co-worker Vickie. Despite knowing Walter's past, she still wants to be with him and eventually opens up to him about her troubled past.The cameo appearances by Eve, Mos Def, David Alan Grier, and Benjamin Bratt were excellent. I wish that there was a bit more of David Alan Grier as Walter's boss but otherwise their presence in the film were just as compelling as the lead characters. I wasn't too impressed by the cameo appearance by Madonna's ex-boyfriend Carlos Leon as Pedro. His acting abilities is something to be left desired. The stand out performance by the following actors had to be Mos Def. Mos Def's performance as Sgt. Javert who is constantly up Walter's grill, especially when something bad happens in the neighborhood.I have to give major points to director Nicole Kassell for tackling a very uncomfortable, if not ugly subject which is pedophilia. The subject matter is definitely not for the squeamish. The cinematography was very gritty which matched well with the subject. The way the film was edited was excellent and conveyed to this moviegoer the torment that Walter was experiencing.My only flaw I found with the film is the way that Walter's past was handled. I did not like being given snippets of a young girl and the red rubber ball that I used to play dodgeball with in elementary school. I understood that it was part of Walter's past but I think I would have liked to have known a little more or had just left it out altogether.The best qualities about this film is how Nicole treated her lead characters Walter and Vickie. They were flawed, wounded souls to say the very least but at the same time they were human and trying to make their way through life . By all means, Nicole certainly doesn't paint pedophilia in a positive light. She makes it very clear that pedohpilia is wrong but she at the same time wants to show the moviegoer what a convicted pedophilia goes through when he is re-integrated with society after serving prison time. It ain't a pretty picture but it certainly gave me some insight to what a convicted child molester goes through in society.After Kevin's stunning performance in 2003's ""Mystic River"", I didn't think he could put in an even better performance but he did here in ""The Woodsman"".

886753,ACVNA57PI4DLV,B0007PID84,Francois Tremblay,"[3, 4]","There is a psychological reason why child rape - even statuatory rape - molestation is considered by far the most heinous crime. In Western society, we see children not as human beings with their own needs and feelings, but as abstract symbols of innocence. When that innocence is broken, people feel personally violated.In this movie, Kevin Bacon plays the role of a newly-released ""child rapist"" trying to live a quiet life, struggling against his desires for children. His family has disowned him, and he doesn't want to relate to anyone, for fear of being found out.This is a very intelligent and honest movie. The first thing it shows us, is that we like to brand child molestors ""monsters"" - but as his co-workers learn the truth about his crimes and assault him, it becomes harder to figure out who's the monster, if any. In a society where so-called ""normal"" people demand someone, anyone, to be jailed or die when a crime occurs, it becomes hard to make the difference.Many reviewers are perhaps stubbornly ""normal"", or have no empathy, but they seem to have missed the point. Bacon's character is not a scumbag, but a pedophile who gave into his sexual desires and got caught. He truly believes that he is not hurting anyone. Perhaps this concept is too hard to accept for many people.It also, perhaps tangentially, drives the point home that our children are not protected by the arbitrary and coercive family structure we have today... merely made servants of, oftentimes, evil or negligeant parents.The cast is solid, but Bacon's performance is especially right on spot. The ending is depressing and bleak, but it only adds to the content. There is no way for a person like that to win in our society.

886754,ANMFFCVZ3KM81,B0007PID84,"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[5, 40]","Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick star in this very disturbing and dismal film. The movie begins with Walter (Bacon) being released from prison, moving into an apartment, and resuming a job he'd had prior to imprisonment. Walter is a quiet individual who minds his own business, which fascinates the warehouse's receptionist played by hip-hop artist Eve. Though her advances are ignored by Walter, she becomes irate when Walter becomes interested in Vickie (Sedgwick), a fellow employee. And as the old saying goes, hell has no fury as a woman scorned......As it turns out, Walter is a pedophile; for which he has just completed a twelve-year sentence. To make matters worse, the only apartment that he could find to rent is adjacent to an elementary school, in which he leers constantly and wanders nightly. To make matters really worse, Walter is still attracted to little girls. This attraction / sickness continues to overwhelm Walter throughout the film to the point where he begins to follow random girls around the mall, and through the local park. He eventually gathers the nerve to ask one of these girls to sit on his lap, because in his words, ""It would really make him (Walter) feel good."" Just at the point where you are truly appalled and disgusted by what you think you are going to witness on screen, the film pulls back and Walter tells the girl to good home. Only to find out that her father has already been enjoying having his daughter sit on his lap....... ARE THERE NO NORMAL MEN IN THIS FILM?To make a long story short, Eve ""outs"" Walter to his fellow employees. His employers, keeps him on the payroll, and says, ""If anyone has a problem with that, they can pick up their paychecks and quit!"" YEAH, like that's going to happen.... And finally the movie ends with Walter packing his stuff and moving in with Vickie. So they can have kids, and Walter won't have to go outside to find suitable prospects to fondle, he'll be able to find them in the comforts of his own home..... MY GOD WOMAN, WAKE UP!!!!I just have to ask myself, WHY IN THE WORLD WAS THIS FILM EVER MADE? The film made me feel dirty, sickened, aghast, revolted, horrified... and the list goes on.

886755,AY12DBB0U420B,B0007PID84,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Four decades ago, a friend of mine was convicted of child molesting. You'd never guess this guy was a pedophile. He was bright, highly educated in guilt-edge universities, pleasant, personable and well liked. I had known him for seven years, then when I was away for a few months he was busted. It seems he baby-sitted a friend's three children and took incriminating pictures. He had the photos printed at a local photofinisher who summoned the police in. They allowed the photos to be returned as if nothing was wrong and then showed up with a search warrant. It was an open and shut case. I was stunned by the whole thing and would never have guessed, I spoke to him later and he claimed he did nothing wrong and wouldn't harm the children in any way, but that's not what it looked like in the court case. He was convicted and given a strict long-term probation. Later he skipped out of the country and lived the remainder of his life in countries where his acts were not considered criminal.Al of this past history came to mind last night when I viewed ""The Woodsman"" DVD. It was the story of a child-sex abuser who had been convicted and sent to prison for twelve years. The story begins with his release. Well, of all the different types of criminals we have, the absolute bottom of the pecking order are the convicted pedophiles and they become abused themselves in all sorts of different ways, both in prison and out in the free world. Kevin Bacon depicts the released convict and does a good acting job of it. He finds a second-floor apartment across the street from an elementary school. Hopefully, this could never happen in modern-day California. He gets a job at a large lumber yard. The movie depicts his life and his struggles, There's the tempting children across the street and another pedophile who is scouting out little boys. There's a nice looking 12-year-old girl whom he befriends and she almost agrees to sit on his lap. There's the discovery at work of his prison term and the offense that got it for him. He finds a new and understanding adult girlfriend. Everyone close to him holds him in contempt, including his parole officer to his brother-in-law and sister. It's a tough world for one with his affliction.It's an interesting movie, perhaps enhanced by my personal knowledge of such a case. The movie was well done and the sight and sound came across well. I didn't feel any upwelling of sympathy for the leading character or his plight. The story was not particularly compelling. I don't think it would be a movie I would watch a second time.Gary Peterson",4,"Well Done, But Not Compelling.",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2587,"['Four', 'decades', 'ago', 'friend', 'mine', 'was', 'convicted', 'child', 'molesting', ""'d"", 'never', 'guess', 'guy', 'was', 'pedophile', 'was', 'bright', 'highly', 'educated', 'guilt-edge', 'universities', 'pleasant', 'personable', 'well', 'liked', 'had', 'known', 'seven', 'years', 'then', 'when', 'was', 'away', 'few', 'months', 'was', 'busted', 'baby-sitted', 'friend', 'three', 'children', 'took', 'incriminating', 'pictures', 'had', 'photos', 'printed', 'local', 'photofinisher', 'who', 'summoned', 'police', 'allowed', 'photos', 'be', 'returned', 'nothing', 'was', 'wrong', 'then', 'showed', 'up', 'search', 'warrant', 'was', 'open', 'shut', 'case', 'was', 'stunned', 'whole', 'thing', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'guessed', 'spoke', 'later', 'claimed', 'did', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'would', ""n't"", 'harm', 'children', 'way', 'not', 'what', 'looked', 'court', 'case', 'was', 'convicted', 'given', 'strict', 'long-term', 'probation', 'Later', 'skipped', 'country', 'lived', 'remainder', 'life', 'countries', 'where', 'acts', 'were', 'not', 'considered', 'criminal.Al', 'past', 'history', 'came', 'mind', 'last', 'night', 'when', 'viewed', 'Woodsman', 'DVD', 'was', 'story', 'child-sex', 'abuser', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'convicted', 'sent', 'prison', 'twelve', 'years', 'story', 'release', 'Well', 'different', 'types', 'criminals', 'have', 'absolute', 'bottom', 'pecking', 'order', 'are', 'convicted', 'pedophiles', 'become', 'abused', 'sorts', 'different', 'ways', 'prison', 'free', 'world', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'released', 'convict', 'good', 'acting', 'job', 'second-floor', 'apartment', 'street', 'elementary', 'school', 'Hopefully', 'could', 'never', 'happen', 'modern-day', 'California', 'job', 'large', 'lumber', 'yard', 'movie', 'life', 'struggles', 'tempting', 'children', 'street', 'pedophile', 'who', 'scouting', 'out', 'little', 'boys', 'nice', 'looking', '12-year-old', 'girl', 'whom', 'almost', 'sit', 'lap', 'discovery', 'work', 'prison', 'term', 'offense', 'got', 'new', 'understanding', 'adult', 'girlfriend', 'Everyone', 'close', 'contempt', 'including', 'parole', 'officer', 'brother-in-law', 'sister', 'tough', 'world', 'one', 'affliction.It', 'interesting', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'enhanced', 'personal', 'knowledge', 'case', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'sight', 'sound', 'came', 'across', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'upwelling', 'sympathy', 'leading', 'character', 'plight', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'second', 'time.Gary', 'Peterson']",The Woodsman
886756,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0007PID84,General Breadbasket,"[4, 7]","Kevin Bacon stars in ""The Woodsman"", a film that gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of a former child molestor.Kevin Bacon plays an ex-con, a man who was given twelve years in prison for some very inappropriate behavior with young girls. Because of his actions, he's lost all but two real friends, one, a relative, who sticks by him because the ex-con stuck by him in a time of need, and the other, a woman who is in love with the ex-con, who loves him for who he is, his sense of humour, his personality. Just out, he's gotten himself a job doing woodwork, and frequently goes to his counsellor, all the while trying to come to terms with what he's done, what he feels, and where he's going now.It's a very quiet, very serious film, one that I thought (by the look of it and the way it was filmed) was a lot older than it actually was. I wouldn't call the treatment of Kevin Bacon's character sympathetic, not exactly, but you do get a good idea of what it must feel to be a person like that, having strange feelings you don't want, with everyone who knows about your past disgusted and avoidant when all you want to do is move on. Kevin Bacon does a very good job at potraying all this, probably the best acting I've seen him do.The amazon rating system is all about how much you liked a product. I'm giving it 4 stars, not because I ""liked"" what I saw (some of it was hard to watch, especially the conversation between Kevin Bacon's character and Robin, the birdwatching girl molested by her father at home, in the park), but because I thought it was an interesting insight.

886757,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0007PID84,Get What We Give,"[1, 3]","The Woodsman is an icky film. It is based on a play of the same name. The subject matter is what makes it really icky. The story centers on Walter (Kevin Bacon), a man who has just been released from 12 years in prison for molesting little girls. How does he function in society? How is he viewed by his peers? How will he be treated? Has he been rehabilitated?The answers to the questions aren't the ones that you would typically see in a film with the star power that this one carries. This film ""should"" have been made independently with little or unknown actors. However, for some reason, it garnered huge star power: Kevin Bacon in the lead as the pedophile, Walter; Kyra Sedgewick(Bacon's real life wife) as a co-worker who befriends Walter; Mos Def as a detective determined to find a reason to kick Walter back into prison; David Allen Grier, in an almost cameo role as Walter's boss.Kevin Bacon delivers a home run in his performance! I've never seen him do anything near as good and he's had some great opportunities. The raw emotion he demonstrates is such that he makes you feel Walter's pain and shame; unfortunately (for me) he can also make you get into Walter's head too well. Kyra Sedgewick plays a hard life broad who is also firing on all cylinders. She also delivers a performance worthy of great praise. But it was Mos Def who really blew me out of the water. Let me explain - I think Bacon deserves an Oscar for his performance, but then I've known he was a good actor for a long time. Mos Def? Mos Def? I saw him in The Italian Job and I thought he was great! I couldn't believe this guy used to be a rapper. Now, in this part as a detective, he performance was so subtly nuanced that you could read his mind.I don't know of many films at all where I was actually given chills by the performances: but I was in this one. Bacon underplays his character to just the right degree. Walter is a real person with real emotions. Bacon obviously stopped going to the gym for a long time in order to make Walter more believable. Walter's not fat, nor is he thin, he's just not in shape. Walter reacts angrily to his shrink sitting behind him. While it's not overtly said, you know it's because Walter was sexually assaulted repeatedly and frequently while in prison as most child molesters are.It's these small touches that make this film so amazing.In fact, it is those very same reasons that make it impossible for me to give it 5 stars. The acting is awesome. However, I felt like I liked Walter a little too much. I sympathized with him too much. After all, he admits to his sexual deviency, so I should dislike him. Bacon pulls you in though. And that is what I didn't like.But to the filmmaker's credit - these are not cardboard characters. These are real people with real emotions and real lives.The subject matter alone will prevent Bacon, Sedgewick, and Mos Def from even being nominated for an Oscar, though they deserve to be.That is actually quite a shame, because they deserve the nod much moreseo than many others who will be nominated for lighter fare.",4,For the acting alone it deserves 4 stars,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,3081,"['Woodsman', 'icky', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'same', 'name', 'subject', 'matter', 'what', 'really', 'icky', 'story', 'centers', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', '12', 'years', 'prison', 'molesting', 'little', 'girls', 'How', 'function', 'society', 'How', 'viewed', 'peers', 'How', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'Has', 'been', 'rehabilitated', 'answers', 'questions', 'are', ""n't"", 'ones', 'would', 'typically', 'see', 'film', 'star', 'power', 'one', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'independently', 'little', 'unknown', 'actors', 'However', 'reason', 'garnered', 'huge', 'star', 'power', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'lead', 'pedophile', 'Walter', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'Bacon', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'co-worker', 'who', 'Walter', 'Mos', 'Def', 'detective', 'determined', 'find', 'reason', 'kick', 'Walter', 'back', 'prison', 'David', 'Allen', 'Grier', 'almost', 'cameo', 'role', 'Walter', 'boss.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'home', 'run', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'anything', 'good', 'had', 'great', 'opportunities', 'raw', 'emotion', 'such', 'feel', 'Walter', 'pain', 'shame', 'unfortunately', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'get', 'Walter', 'head', 'too', 'well', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'hard', 'life', 'broad', 'who', 'also', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'also', 'performance', 'worthy', 'great', 'praise', 'was', 'Mos', 'Def', 'who', 'really', 'blew', 'water', 'Let', 'explain', 'think', 'Bacon', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'then', ""'ve"", 'known', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'long', 'time', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Mos', 'Def', 'saw', 'Italian', 'Job', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'guy', 'used', 'be', 'rapper', 'Now', 'part', 'detective', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'could', 'read', 'mind.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'films', 'where', 'was', 'actually', 'given', 'chills', 'performances', 'was', 'one', 'Bacon', 'character', 'just', 'right', 'degree', 'Walter', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'emotions', 'Bacon', 'obviously', 'stopped', 'going', 'gym', 'long', 'time', 'order', 'make', 'Walter', 'more', 'believable', 'Walter', 'not', 'fat', 'thin', 'just', 'not', 'shape', 'Walter', 'angrily', 'shrink', 'sitting', 'not', 'overtly', 'said', 'know', 'Walter', 'was', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'repeatedly', 'frequently', 'prison', 'most', 'child', 'molesters', 'are.It', 'small', 'touches', 'make', 'film', 'so', 'amazing.In', 'fact', 'very', 'same', 'reasons', 'make', 'impossible', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'acting', 'awesome', 'However', 'felt', 'liked', 'Walter', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'sympathized', 'too', 'much', 'sexual', 'deviency', 'should', 'dislike', 'Bacon', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like.But', 'filmmaker', 'credit', 'are', 'not', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'emotions', 'real', 'lives.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'alone', 'will', 'prevent', 'Bacon', 'Sedgewick', 'Mos', 'Def', 'even', 'being', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'deserve', 'actually', 'quite', 'shame', 'deserve', 'nod', 'much', 'moreseo', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'nominated', 'lighter', 'fare']",The Woodsman
886758,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0007PID84,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[11, 14]","This is the debut film for new director Nicole Kassell. She had seen Steven Fechter's play, THE WOODSMAN, and bought the film options immediately. She and Fechter collaborated on the screenplay. It won the screenplay competition at Sundance in 2001. Somehow she brought the project to Kevin Bacon, and he liked it, accepting the role of executive producer. He and his wife Kyra Sedgewick became involved, and those Hollywood fiscal doors swung open.Consequently, Kassell was able to direct with remarkable confidence, and a decent budget. As a female director, she is finding her place at the table of Cinema Arts. At Sundance this year, 25% of the films had female directors. She has directed a powerful drama that might be a tough sell commercially.Kevin Bacon gave a strong performance as Walter, playing a paroled pedophile, returned to the mean streets after twelve years of incarceration. It is hinted at that he must have hidden his crime for all that time, and therefore had no rehab or counseling. He returned to his old job, at a lumberyard, and set up a relationship with a tough cop parole officer, played masterfully by Mos Def, and a pyschological counsellor. Walter knows that he wears the label of deviant, and that his difficult to control urges were like demons shackled with silken scarves. His pedophilia was with young girls. That story is not usually told. It was brave of Kassell to tackle it with her first feature film.Bacon played Walter as taciturn, walking and working like a tense shadow. He was not receptive to other employess getting to know him. He was a man walking on eggshells that to him felt like running barefoot over broken glass. He would inhabit a scene like a piece of furniture--one saw him but didn't notice him. He kept everything in check--every muscle, every twitch, every inflection and intonation. Like an animal that has been caged and whipped, and degraded, when it is finally set free, its tail spend a long time between its legs.He hoped to make it, even though the odds were against him. Over 90% of pedophiles reoffend and return to prison and certain death. But after a misunderstanding at work, his dark secret was revealed, his cover was blown--and everyone began to treat him like a pariah. Everyone except his co-worker Vickie, played by Kyra Sedgewick. She was beginning a relationship with him, physical and emotional, and she had revealed her own problems--her three brothers had used her like a sex toy as she grew up. So she pulled away too, for a while. But in the end, she was willing to stand with Walter against the world; very romantic, albeit unrealistic. Sedgewick was wonderful in the role, sexy, strong, yet still vulnerable.The plot was rife with coincidences, but the acting was so strong, we accepted them, and went along for the whole ride.Benjamin Bratt was very effective as the brother-in-law Carlos,who wanted to help Walter--that is until Walter said an inappropriate thing about Carlos' daughter.At one point, stressed out and desperate, Walter stalked and followed a young girl into the park. Hannah Pilkes played Robin, the 12 year old girl. Her simplicity, clarity, and sadness seemed to leap off the screen.

886759,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007PID84,Grady Harp,"[6, 8]","THE WOODSMAN is the kind of film that took maximum courage to create on behalf of the entire crew - writer Steven Fechter (who wrote the screenplay from his stage play), director Nicole Kassell, the producers, and of course the actors.  So committed to this project that they also produced this wondrous film, Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick also have assumed the leading roles of this controversial drama and in doing so give us the finest performances of their distinguished careers.We, as society, play a major role in this story because it is very much about how we judge people, how we deal with those who have been incarcerated, and how we hold onto our intolerances for those who are out of the norm.  Placing ourselves in the judgmental role makes the impact of this film that much more devastating.Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from a 12-year prison term for molesting young girls and returns to his home to find a job in a lumberyard under the careful scrutiny of Bob (David Alan Grier) his boss.  Mary-Kay (Eve) his co-worker tries to come on to him and is rebuffed by Walter, a man who lives in dark loneliness, filled with guilt and self-loathing, afraid to allow any sort of closeness with anyone.  He rents an apartment across from a schoolyard ('the only landlord who would take my money') where he observes from his window the source of his past (and +/- present) temptation - little girls at play. He also observes a young man approaching young boys, mirroring his own history of pedophilia, a view that will permanently alter his self-concept later in the film.Walter meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick), finds it odd that a beautiful woman would be a laborer in a lumberyard of men, and after a time the two share a beer and end up in bed.  Vickie eventually pries out Walter's reason for his incarceration, and while shocked she does not flee but instead shares her darkest secret that her three brothers molested her as a child.Noting Walter's developing relationship with Vickie, Mary-Kay finds the truth about Walter's past and makes it known to the entire lumberyard in the cruelest of ways. The injured Walter moves in with Vickie, continues seeing his therapist Rosen (Michael Shannon), his brother in law Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), and his parole officer Sgt Lucas (Mos Def), and we slowly learn that Walter has a conflict with his sister with whom he napped as a child 'to smell her hair' (an act coupled with his history of pedophilia that makes his sister refuse to see him despite Carlos' good attempt to re-join them).Along the way Walter encounters a 12-year-old girl Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is also a loner and birdwatcher and we are allowed to see how Walter's recidivism surfaces as he longs for physical contact with Robin.  Yet in a sensitive scene between the two, the spectrum of perpetrator and victim is played out solely through words: Walter invites Robin to sit on is lap only to discover that Robin's father has been showing the same behavior and what is communicated between the two is some of the most healing dialogue ever written.The manner in which this story ends is very much left up to the viewer (remember we are part of the film) to decide.  The pacing of this tale, the minimal dialogue, the quiet of the gritty atmosphere - all of these contribute to the profound effect that is achieved in the brilliant performance by Kevin Bacon.  Rarely has an actor captured the angst, the internalization, the bleakness of injured life after prison, and the longing for redemption that Bacon achieves with his face, his eyes, his body language and his manner of delivering his lines.  Kyra Sedgwick is likewise extraordinarily powerful as the damaged woman who allows her rigid lonely life to embrace the likes of Walter. The supporting cast is uniformly outstanding, especially Hannah Pilkes as Robin, and Benjamin Bratt as Carlos.This may be the first film for Nicole Kassell but is surely won't be the last.  She is a brilliant director who has mastered her resources and carved a treasure of a film.  One can shout against the awards people for being so intimidated by the subject matter to prevent Kevin Bacon from being crowned for his penultimate achievement, but people forget who won the awards as soon as they are over: people can't forget the power of Bacon's performance.  Highly Recommended.

Kevin Bacon's character (Walter) is a man who served time in prison for this.  The story focuses on his life outside... his inner turmoil and the problems others have with him and how he deals with it.  He seldom gets a reprieve in the whole film.  There's not a moment in the film where he doesn't have a somber and serious look on his face with one exception.  Regardless of how much we hate child molesters, this film makes us understand their struggles more and actually root for the man to turn his life around.  Though sadly, it's something that he always has to deal with.  Child molestors are often products of some type of childhood trauma themselves, so their unusual drives and inclinations are ""hard wired"" into their brains.

Bettelheim said that the fable was suggesting a man abusing a young girl. The wolf symbolizes this kind of man. This is the thought behind this film's title. The film focuses on a convicted sex offender who had abused young girls. It raises the questions: can such a man change and live a ""normal"" life? If yes, how long will it take? What is ""normal""?The sex offender lives across the street from a grade school and watches young girls and boys coming and going to and from school. He sees another man watching the children. This man speaks to the kids and offers them candy.A woman at work picks him up and the two have sex. She tells him that her three brothers abused her when she was a child, but she now has a good relationship with all three. After a while, he tells her what he had done. They separate, but she comes back. He is being treated by a psychologist. It comes out during the sessions that he and his sister slept together in the same bed from time to time. Now, unlike his girl friend's situation, his sister refuses to forgive him for what he did. He feels that he needs this forgiveness.He sees a young girl in the park and is attracted to her. He follows her, sits with her, and asks her to sit on his lap. She tells him that her father did the same. She cries and says that if he still wants her to sit on his lap, she will do so. He says no. At home, sees the man who had been watching the children take a boy and later return with him, and he reacts.His psychologist asks him about the tree incidences - his sister, the girl in the park, and the abuser.

No doubt lots of people were incensed by the movie and considered it immoral because it evoked sympathy for someone who likes to have sex with pubescent girls (and even pre-pubescent, the character stipulates 10 to 12-year-olds). But it does an admirable job of telling its story first (which is really a character study, made effective by Bacon's soulful and moving performance), and making its points second. The points it makes, predictably enough, center around tolerance and compassion, and the film shows pretty persuasively how regular folk's fear and loathing of ""pedophilia"" (and the denial of their own propensity for it) only make the whole sticky problem worse, by refusing to even entertain the possibility of understanding.The film dramatically illustrates the inevitable tension between the deviant and the society that rejects him, and how that tension itself gives rise to further deviance. It's the oldest folly of all, the demonization of the other in order to project all our own unacknowledged neuroses, fears, and desires onto them. But oh, it's convenient! The result is that what we fear and loath inevitably becomes more and more fearsome and loathsome the more we deny it and refuse to understand it. Because without understanding, there is no possibility of acceptance, which is the necessary prerequisite for change. If we only forgive the sinner once he has repented, what's so admirable about that? Especially when we refuse to afford him our trust and compassion and sympathy and belief that he CAN change.How is the sinner ever to repent, if he can't first be forgiven, and forgive himself? All that self-hatred and the unbearable sense of being different, alienated, from others is what leads to the deviant's neurotic drives to begin with. So it can easily be seen how society's response to the ""problem"" (a problem which, after all, IT created), only exacerbates the problem further.God how I despise moralists!""Morality is the root of all evil"" - if I may be permitted to quote myself.

In ""The Woodsman"", there's zero. Kevin Bacon stars in this stirring and gripping movie about the plight of a child molester who is trying to turn his life around after being put in jail for twelve years. While watching the movie I wondered if they chose to make him molest little girls as to make it a bit easier for the audience to sympathize with his character-he also beats up a man who he witnesses abduct a boy. Regardless it's still a bit of a struggle but somehow director and writer Nicole Kassell and Steven Fechter manage to pull it off. What the movie calls into question is if jail is meant for reform and as a punishment, shouldn't we as a society accept that an ex-con has put in his or her time and allow them to reclaim their life without exception?

We have run into subjects like these in films about things such as slavery, the holocaust, films about rape and in recent year's films about 9-11. Most of these subjects have a percentage of the public turned off  and the other percentage able to disconnect, for whatever reason, and able to view the film in a subjective manner.  The Woodsman deals with the toughest subject matter of any film I've seen, they make the main character in the film a child molester and have us try to feel sorry for him.  This film right off the bat had me saying to myself that this was an impossible task.I was half right, I didn't feel sorry for Walter played wonderfully by Kevin Bacon, at times I understood why everyone hated him.  What I also learned was the other side of his life.  Him wanting to be normal and constant wondering if he would ever be able to find peace within himself.  This film was beautifully directed by new comer Nicole Kassell who directed this story with kid gloves and certainly a scene of tastefulness and discipline needed for such a risky script.You will not cheer for the Kevin Bacon's character and you probably won't feel sorry for him, but you'll try to understand how hard his life is and wish he could do something to change it.  I can't recommend this film to everyone, I know as a parent it was hard for me to watch and think that there are people like this out there.  If you do watch this know that it's a good movie with great acting and that the director tip toes around this taboo without crossing over into distastefulness for the sake of ""art"".  It's a shame that these performances will not be seen by many because I think this film is a good one, a very good one.

Kevins acting is superb in that he wants no pity, and the signs that what he has done will ever be erased from his memory, it totally haunts him. Another good quality is that no one feels sorry for him, Mos Def, who plays the cop watching his every move simply states ""your a piece of S#%T and i could through you out that window right now"" in which Kevin Bacon cries.

886773,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,B0007PID84,Jonathan Appleseed,"[134, 158]","As I left the theater, I thought to myself: How am I going to write this review? This movie needs to be experienced, to be felt. Then when I looked at the other reviews here on Amazon, I saw that the ""experiences"" were already covered in detail, so I decided that gave me some leeway.This is a film about a pedophile, and the struggles he experiences after his release from prison, both with the people in his life and the emotions that boil inside of him. My review is going to focus mainly on the specific events involving him and his pedophilia.Many viewers likely have difficulty separating the fiction of the movie from the reality of the horrors of child molestation, which probably explains its dismal rating (currently 5.6 out of 10) on pro.imdb.com (the professional version of the Internet Movie Database). They probably feel disgust - and they *should* feel disgust. There is no worse crime than stealing the life of a child. This film was also shunned by the Golden Globes, which means it will likely receive no nods from the Academy, which is much more conservative. That is a pity, because at the very least Kevin Bacon puts on an amazing performance deserves at least a nomination.Walter (Bacon) is acutely aware of his disease, and he despises himself for it. One can see it in the self-hatred in his eyes, and in the gruff manner in which he treats others. The gruffness, however, probably arose from spending twelve years in prison, where even amongst criminals there is a code of honor: murder, rape, thieve all you want - just never, ever molest a child. While it's never discussed, we can assume that Walter himself was horrifically abused during those twelve years.Somewhat unbelievably, upon Walter's release from prison, he secures an apartment that is directly across from an elementary school, although it is explained that no other landlord would take his money. His brother-in-law brings him a table, which Walter made as a wedding present for his sister and brother-in-law. Carlos (Benjamin Bratt) says that he's returning it to please his wife. We understand that means that Walter's sister has such hatred, disdain, and an inability to forgive him that she wants nothing of his in her house. Walter places the table in front of a window that overlooks the school's playground, where he either watches, or writes in a journal, which his therapist encouraged him to do. In that journal he speaks of his continuing struggle with his attraction to young girls - and also the very conspicuous stalking of an obvious child molester who is interested in boys. Walter records him in his journal as ""candy"", and one wonders why Walter doesn't immediately turn him in. He certainly has the opportunity, as he has assigned parole as well as a Sergeant that visits him from time to time to make him feel who takes it upon himself to make Walter feel even worse about himself. Perhaps Walter never turned on ""candy"" because he still found himself entranced by young girls. That is understandable, even if it is disgusting and revolting.We also know that he is aware of his abnormality because he speaks of it to his therapist, saying on repeated occasions that he wants to be normal - and normal for him means ""looking at a girl and not..."" He leaves it at that, but we know what he means. He wants desperately to look at a girl - between the ages of 10 and 12 - and have no desires for her.Although never directly discussed in the film, there is a scene with his therapist that very strongly suggests a sexual relation between him and his sister, and this likely explains his very specific age range. The therapist asks for his first recollection of sexual feelings, and Walter describes an event where he was taking a nap with his sister and smelling her hair. He was six, and she was four. Walter repeated several times that he enjoyed smelling her hair. The therapist asked him how this progressed over time, and when the age that the therapist approached began to touch on the limits of the girls Walter molested, Walter began to cry and ultimately refused to continue. One can only imagine what took place between the two of them, but whatever it is, Walter's self-reproach is plain. It's also one of the best acted spots in the film.Walter takes the bus to work, and the bus serves as a catalyst for two things. First, a relationship with a woman (played by Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's wife) who herself was sexually abused by her brothers when she was younger. When she shares that with Walter, he says to her, ""You must hate them"". Her reply explains her relationship with him: ""No, I love all of them"". How she found the ability to forgive them we never know. These situations are complicated.Second, a young girl rides the bus that he finds attractive. One day he doesn't get off at his stop and he follows her into a park where she's looking at birds. He strikes up a conversation with her, and it's very difficult as an audience member to watch this dialogue. Part of you can't help but care about Walter, because even though you know he has molested young girls (and therefore a part of you loathes him), you see the burning desire for redemption within him and you want him to succeed at becoming ""normal"". The girl breaks off the conversation and leaves, but not uncomfortably - in fact, she seems very comfortable with him. Nevertheless, Walter wears his guilt like the weight of a galaxy on his shoulders, and he slumps home.A jealous girl who he originally shunned found out that he was a child molester, and started distributing flyers around the lumberyard where he works with his picture and the nature of his offense. The guys jump on him, he gets slugged a time or two in the gut, and while he originally goes on the floor to work, he walks off early, and finds himself back in the park where he talked to the birdwatcher. He sits on a bench, ostensibly waiting for her to come, and eventually she does, sitting down beside him. Then begins the most uncomfortable part of the film. After some conversation, Walter asks her age (that's part of his M.O. - establish their age), and then asks if she wants to sit on his lap. You can almost hear the collective groan in the theater when he asks this, because you can feel him slipping away into the darkness of his disease again - and we know that if he molests this girl, or even if he is seen sitting next to her, never mind with her on his lap, that he is going back to jail. She says no, and a look of regret and longing wash over Walter's face. Then he asks if her Daddy lets her sit in his lap. She says yes, and he asks if she likes it. And here's the surprise: she says no, and starts to cry.I'm going to leave it at that, because that in itself is divulging too much of what I feel needs to be experienced. The only other thing I'll say is that the sergeant who is assigned to him shared with him a metaphor earlier in the film, that of the woodsman from Little Red Riding Hood. The woodsman was the character who cut Little Red Riding Hood out of the wolves belly.The girl on the bus, the birdwatcher, wore a red cape-like jacket.",5,Little Red Riding Hood,1106006400,"01 18,

886774,A28LG2MEWGLKZW,B0007PID84,Jonathan S. Kemp,"[9, 10]","""The Woodsman"" is a riveting, disturbing character study of a pedophile named Walter (Kevin Bacon), a 40-something man recently released from prison after molesting young girls. The film focuses on adjustments that Walter and the people around him must make.Walter is a lonely man when he leaves prison. His family wants nothing to do with him. His co-workers at the lumberyard eye him suspiciously, and some loathe him openly. His apartment is ironically located across the street from an elementary school, a location that both torments and calms him as he tries to come to grips with what he did. His only friend is a brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt), a man who is awkward to talk to.Walter's sickness - his disposition to wanting young girls - pervades his mind at all hours of the day, and even though he officially is exonerated and on his own (aside from his probation), he knows his perverse desire still resides within him.Bacon gives a great performance. It's a risky performance (most actors would probably shy away from a pedophiliac character), but he handles it deftly, displaying a mixture of leveled anger, sadness and pain that makes it hard to like or dislike him. Walter isn't a character we can root for, and his momentary pitfalls into pursuing little girls is absolutely chilling, but he seems human and sympathetic in certain ways. He isn't a caricature. He sits between being a monster and a human being, and Bacon's portrayal is superb.The performances are fantastic all around. Mos Def shows once again that he is a gifted actor, playing a cop who checks up on Walter every now and then. The scenes between Walter and him display some of the finest acting of any independent film this year. Kyra Sedgwick, playing one of Walter's coworkers, also is excellent.The Woodsman maintains a high level of suspense through its 90-minute running time. Each character gives an emotionally complete, well-rounded performance so that every action is believable. The contentious subject of pedophilia is handled brilliantly, and there are scenes that will stay with you for days. This is a great film, and a laudable achievement in writing and acting.",4,"Excellent script, superb performances",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2163,"['Woodsman', 'riveting', 'disturbing', 'character', 'study', 'pedophile', 'named', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', '40-something', 'man', 'recently', 'released', 'prison', 'molesting', 'young', 'girls', 'film', 'adjustments', 'Walter', 'people', 'must', 'make.Walter', 'lonely', 'man', 'when', 'prison', 'family', 'nothing', 'do', 'co-workers', 'lumberyard', 'eye', 'suspiciously', 'loathe', 'openly', 'apartment', 'ironically', 'located', 'street', 'elementary', 'school', 'location', 'torments', 'calms', 'come', 'grips', 'what', 'did', 'only', 'friend', 'brother-in-law', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'man', 'who', 'awkward', 'talk', 'to.Walter', 'sickness', 'disposition', 'wanting', 'young', 'girls', 'mind', 'hours', 'day', 'even', 'officially', 'exonerated', 'own', 'probation', 'perverse', 'desire', 'still', 'him.Bacon', 'great', 'performance', 'risky', 'performance', 'most', 'actors', 'would', 'probably', 'shy', 'away', 'pedophiliac', 'character', 'deftly', 'displaying', 'mixture', 'leveled', 'anger', 'sadness', 'pain', 'hard', 'like', 'dislike', 'Walter', ""n't"", 'character', 'can', 'root', 'momentary', 'pitfalls', 'pursuing', 'little', 'girls', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'human', 'sympathetic', 'certain', 'ways', ""n't"", 'caricature', 'being', 'monster', 'human', 'being', 'Bacon', 'portrayal', 'superb.The', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'around', 'Mos', 'Def', 'once', 'again', 'gifted', 'actor', 'playing', 'cop', 'who', 'up', 'Walter', 'now', 'then', 'scenes', 'Walter', 'display', 'finest', 'acting', 'independent', 'film', 'year', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'playing', 'one', 'Walter', 'coworkers', 'also', 'excellent.The', 'Woodsman', 'high', 'level', 'suspense', '90-minute', 'running', 'time', 'character', 'emotionally', 'complete', 'well-rounded', 'performance', 'action', 'believable', 'contentious', 'subject', 'pedophilia', 'handled', 'brilliantly', 'are', 'scenes', 'will', 'stay', 'days', 'great', 'film', 'laudable', 'achievement', 'writing', 'acting']",The Woodsman

He is struggling, trying to get back into the groove of normal life. He is tattered with temptation, and his inner demons start coming out,  haunting him. He is scorned by everybody around him, He is called a freak, a sick bastard. He is not accepted because of what he had done.The film, itself, is a breeding ground for conteversy. It is mainly about peodpiles. But, the film doesn't glorirfy peodophiles, It shows that they are human beings, and that they feel what they have done is bad, and they need to change. as you know, The perfomance by Kevin Bacon generated good buzz, and the film slipped under the radar. Kevin Bacon does one of his most complex and brillant performance as Walter. The film is very good, there is some solid direction, and solid shots. The screenplay was pretty good, I felt that the writer wanted to make it creative, and actually show how a former sex offender struggles.I didn't nesscary love this movie because it really grossed me out that they did a film on this touchy subject. I felt that Kevin Bacon and the director had balls enough to make this film happen. I am glad that they made this film happen, when a former sex offender is close to you, you don't know how to react, and end up disabling your relationship with that person.

The pedophile is Walter (Kevin Bacon, in an amazing performance) who serves 12 years in prison for raping a little girl and is released. He moves into an apartment across the street from an elementary school, where another pedophile trys to pick up little boys everyday; gets a job at a lumberyard; gets harrased by a police detective(Mos Def); and is shunned by his sister, but not her husband (Benjamin Bratt). At the lumberyard he meets Vicki (real life wife Kyra Sedgwick) who looks past his...well...past and falls in love with him none-the-less. Problem is, Walter feels the pressures of society on him since child molestation is considered by man to be the worst thing you can do. He also can't help but feel urges every now and then. Now, this movie is hard to make; because the blatant fact is that Walter is a pedophile which most people would not feel sympathy for. The writers (Nicole Kassell & Steven Fechter) manage to portray Walter as what he is and don't really attempt to swing your feelings in any way. Problem is, you do feel sorry for Walter and the way he is treated because (from my standpoint) you realize that he is a person, although sick, he still is a person. Anyway, the title represents ""Little Red Riding Hood"" because the Woodsman is what saved Little Red Riding Hood from the stomach of the wolf. This is most definitley an overtone of the film, most notably when a girl Walter begins to follow is wearing a red jacket. Bacon and Sedgwick (despite the fact that they're married, which usually ruins performances) work well together and both deliver great performances. This movie makes an important statement and many people should see it.

This movie has no humor.It does have some fine acting by Kevin Bacon, which is the main reason I got the movie, besides liking movies that are risky or not necessarily mainstream. The supporting cast did a fine job as well, and everyone worked for apparently little money.Bacon plays ""Walter"", recently released after 12 years in prison for some unspecified activity with young girls. He never seems at ease with himself or others, and the ultimate positive outcome of his seemingly genuine desire to reform seems doubtful. I think a person's sexual inclination is something you are born with and can't really be changed, though perhaps it can be regulated to some degree.The photography and ambiance is very good, though it seems to be a bit cold and austere, which is perhaps best for the subject matter.The DVD has a few deleted/extended scenes which I think would have helped the movie, a short ""making of"", and a few previews to movies I'd never heard of.If you like Kevin Bacon, you will probably admire his work if not the movie.",4,If you like Kevin Bacon,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1306,"['Easily', 'dismissed', 'sicko', 'movie', 'Woodsman', 'perhaps', 'deeper', 'mind', 'pedophile', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'other', 'movie', 'know', 'including', 'Lolita', 'movies', 'least', 'have', 'humorous', 'aspects', 'lighten', 'mood', 'bit', 'movie', 'humor.It', 'have', 'fine', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'main', 'reason', 'got', 'movie', 'liking', 'movies', 'are', 'risky', 'not', 'necessarily', 'mainstream', 'supporting', 'cast', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'worked', 'apparently', 'little', 'money.Bacon', 'Walter', 'recently', 'released', '12', 'years', 'prison', 'unspecified', 'activity', 'young', 'girls', 'never', 'ease', 'others', 'ultimate', 'positive', 'outcome', 'seemingly', 'genuine', 'desire', 'reform', 'doubtful', 'think', 'person', 'sexual', 'inclination', 'something', 'are', 'born', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'changed', 'perhaps', 'can', 'be', 'regulated', 'degree.The', 'photography', 'ambiance', 'very', 'good', 'be', 'bit', 'cold', 'austere', 'perhaps', 'best', 'subject', 'matter.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'short', 'making', 'few', 'previews', 'movies', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'like', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'will', 'probably', 'admire', 'work', 'not', 'movie']",The Woodsman
886782,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B0007PID84,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[1, 4]","Stigma of being a known as a pedophile leaves a burnt scare on the forehead of the person, as he or she tries to reenter society.  Even after having been rehabilitated and serving the punishment society leaves no room for error, as every step, every movement of the person is being monitored in fear of the person committing the same crime again.  In prisons, these criminals are locked away in a different section, as even the general convict population despises the convicts that have committed crimes against children.  It is understandable to see how society hates these criminals who prey on the innocent and the dependent.  The Woodsman illustrates how one pedophile is reentering society after a having served 12-years while struggling to understand himself.Kevin Bacon provides a gutsy performance as Walter (Kevin Bacon), a pedophile on probation, as he tries to find a way to fit into society while being banished.  Walter's family does not want to have anything to do with him, his counselor drives him into deep inner guilt, and a police officer named Sergeant Lucas harasses him in his own home.  Constant fear that people would find out truth grabs Walter, as he is fully aware of the public notion of pedophiles.  However, amidst this dark time Walter meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick).  The two of them initiate an intense relationship, yet he also fears what she might think if she finds out about him.Fear from the society keeps Walter isolated, as if his personal beliefs and notions build tall walls around him protecting him from society.  Occasionally, he gets to look over the wall, as Vickie visits with him.  Nevertheless, Sergeant Lucas keeps him reminded of what people think of him, as his counselor continues to induce additional guilt within him.  Yet, Walter also understands Sergeant Lucas and the counselor, as he is aware of the horror children experience through people such as himself.The title of the film, The Woodsman, originates from the Grimm Brothers' Red Little Riding Hood, as it refers to the woodsman that saves the little girl from the wolf's stomach.  There is a scene in the film where Walter is in a park and a young girl approaches him.  At this moment, the audience should pay close attention to the color of the girl's jacket, red, referring to the fairy tale previously mentioned.  Cleverly, this film uses the old fairy tale through the mise-en-scene and the dialogue in the film, which displays the sharp script.The director Nicole Kassell takes a huge chance making a film about such an explosive topic, which many look upon with much hatred and anger.  However, she succeeds in developing the story into something more than a mere illustration of some kind of monster.  Instead, she takes a humane approach, as Walter struggles with his behavior, thoughts, and persona while trying to find a way to fit into society in an acceptable manner.  Aptly, Kassell brings the audience a story about monsters, but also a question of human ambiguity, as life is not as simple as making people either good or bad.

886783,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0007PID84,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","I think that child molesters are arguably the criminals who are most fortunate the U.S. Constitution has a prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.  It is common knowledge that in the prison hierarchy child molesters represent the bottom most rung.  How many times have you heard about pedophiles who are released from serving time in prison and communities be outraged to discover there is a convicted sex offender in their neighborhood?  Another part of conventional wisdom, those things that everybody knows regardless of the facts, it that child molesters are never cured.  However, findings indicate that sex offender treatment reduces the likelihood of sexual recidivism to only 10 (those who do not go through treatment have a recidivism rate of 17 percent).  In other words most pedophiles do not repeat their offense and experts agree that with successful completion of a specialized treatment program those who sexually abuse children can learn how to control their actions.Such statistics certainly surprised me, but I kept them in mind while watching ""The Woodsman.""  The title character is Walter (Kevin Bacon), who has spent a dozen years in prison for molesting young girls.  Of course, by the time this 2004 film came out on DVD this week the character Bacon was playing in this film was pretty well known, but make an effort to notice how the character is established before his crime is revealed.  There are plenty of clues that clearly indicate it, and we know from the start he is an ex-con, but director Nicole Kassell knows how the cards are stacked against pedophiles and wants the audience to be sympathetic at least toward Walter's plight.  He knows what he did is wrong, is disgusted by his behavior, and wants to be ""normal.""  He is clearly making an effort to go straight, which is exactly what society demands, and we are supposed to at least endorse the effort even if we despise the person making the effort.However, going straight is not going to be easy.  The only place that will rent an apartment to an ex-con is across the street from an elementary school and the cop (Mos Def) who comes by to check on him in anticipation of Walter making the same mistake knows this is not a good sign.  His brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt) comes by to visit but makes it clear Walter's sister wants nothing to do with him.  When Walter is in therapy it becomes clear she is the source of his pathology, so we can hardly blame her.  Meanwhile, when Walter looks out his window at the schoolyard and sees a suspicious man hanging around the schoolyard giving candy to young boys.  At works things are almost manageable.  Walter worked there before his arrest and the son of the previous owner (David Allan Greer) hires him.  The office assistant (Mary-Kay) is suspicious of Walter, but Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick), who drives a forklift, is attracted to him.  Of course, she does not know his secret, although clearly he has one.  Then there is Robin (Hannah Pilkes), the young girl who rides the same bus he takes home from work and who gets off to work in the park.We know that Walter is going to come to a crisis point in his life and that it could go either way.  That doubt is essential to the film and it is carried off not only Kassell's screenplay of Steven Fechter's play, but mostly by Kevin Bacon's performance.  He was overlooked in ""Mystic River"" while co-stars Shawn Penn and Tim Robbins were (deservedly) winning Oscars for their performances and he was overlooked for what he did in this film, which is being universally acclaimed as his best.  Bacon's film career might be a game but his acting is certainly not a joke and I do not think that anybody who has followed his career are really surprised by his performance here.  ""The Woodsman"" comes down to a scene in the park and a moment where Bacon's face is wonderfully transformed by a surprising revelation.  The script crafts the moment, but it is Bacon who carries it off.The DVD only has three deleted/extended scenes but two of them are extremely interesting in terms of the decisions that were made on the final cut of this film.  One makes explicit the implicit reasons why Vickie chooses to be with Walter (implicit is better) and the other provides a significant variation on the pivotal scene between Walter and Robin.  I was wondering why Walter did not do something along the lines of what he does in this alternative version, which would have changed the final act of the film considerably.  I would have loved to have heard the conversation where they made the decision to go the way they did in the finished film, but you can still meditate on what differences this would have made in how everything played out.  It is worth thinking about.",5,Kevin Bacon's memorable performance in a provocative film,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4748,"['think', 'child', 'molesters', 'are', 'arguably', 'criminals', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'fortunate', 'U.S.', 'Constitution', 'prohibition', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'common', 'knowledge', 'prison', 'hierarchy', 'child', 'molesters', 'represent', 'bottom', 'most', 'rung', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'heard', 'pedophiles', 'who', 'are', 'released', 'serving', 'time', 'prison', 'communities', 'be', 'outraged', 'discover', 'convicted', 'sex', 'offender', 'neighborhood', 'part', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'things', 'everybody', 'regardless', 'facts', 'child', 'molesters', 'are', 'never', 'cured', 'However', 'findings', 'indicate', 'sex', 'offender', 'treatment', 'likelihood', 'sexual', 'recidivism', 'only', '10', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'treatment', 'have', 'recidivism', 'rate', '17', 'percent', 'other', 'words', 'most', 'pedophiles', 'do', 'not', 'repeat', 'offense', 'experts', 'agree', 'successful', 'completion', 'specialized', 'treatment', 'program', 'who', 'sexually', 'abuse', 'children', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'control', 'actions.Such', 'statistics', 'certainly', 'surprised', 'kept', 'mind', 'watching', 'Woodsman', 'title', 'character', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'spent', 'dozen', 'years', 'prison', 'molesting', 'young', 'girls', 'course', 'time', '2004', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'week', 'character', 'Bacon', 'was', 'playing', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'known', 'make', 'effort', 'notice', 'how', 'character', 'established', 'crime', 'revealed', 'are', 'plenty', 'clues', 'clearly', 'indicate', 'know', 'start', 'ex-con', 'director', 'Nicole', 'Kassell', 'how', 'cards', 'are', 'stacked', 'pedophiles', 'audience', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'least', 'Walter', 'plight', 'what', 'did', 'wrong', 'disgusted', 'behavior', 'be', 'normal', 'clearly', 'making', 'effort', 'go', 'straight', 'exactly', 'what', 'society', 'demands', 'are', 'supposed', 'least', 'endorse', 'effort', 'even', 'despise', 'person', 'making', 'effort.However', 'going', 'straight', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'only', 'place', 'will', 'rent', 'apartment', 'ex-con', 'street', 'elementary', 'school', 'cop', 'Mos', 'Def', 'who', 'check', 'anticipation', 'Walter', 'making', 'same', 'mistake', 'knows', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'brother-in-law', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'visit', 'clear', 'Walter', 'sister', 'nothing', 'do', 'When', 'Walter', 'therapy', 'clear', 'source', 'pathology', 'can', 'hardly', 'blame', 'Meanwhile', 'when', 'Walter', 'out', 'window', 'schoolyard', 'suspicious', 'man', 'hanging', 'schoolyard', 'giving', 'candy', 'young', 'boys', 'works', 'things', 'are', 'almost', 'manageable', 'Walter', 'worked', 'arrest', 'son', 'previous', 'owner', 'David', 'Allan', 'Greer', 'office', 'assistant', 'Mary-Kay', 'suspicious', 'Walter', 'Vickie', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'who', 'forklift', 'attracted', 'course', 'not', 'know', 'secret', 'clearly', 'one', 'Then', 'Robin', 'Hannah', 'Pilkes', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'same', 'bus', 'home', 'work', 'who', 'work', 'park.We', 'know', 'Walter', 'going', 'come', 'crisis', 'point', 'life', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'doubt', 'essential', 'film', 'carried', 'not', 'only', 'Kassell', 'screenplay', 'Steven', 'Fechter', 'play', 'mostly', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'was', 'overlooked', 'Mystic', 'River', 'co-stars', 'Shawn', 'Penn', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'were', 'deservedly', 'winning', 'Oscars', 'performances', 'was', 'overlooked', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'being', 'universally', 'acclaimed', 'best', 'Bacon', 'film', 'career', 'might', 'be', 'game', 'acting', 'certainly', 'not', 'joke', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anybody', 'who', 'followed', 'career', 'are', 'really', 'surprised', 'performance', 'here', 'Woodsman', 'down', 'scene', 'park', 'moment', 'where', 'Bacon', 'face', 'wonderfully', 'transformed', 'surprising', 'revelation', 'script', 'moment', 'Bacon', 'who', 'off.The', 'DVD', 'only', 'three', 'deleted/extended', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'terms', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'film', 'One', 'implicit', 'reasons', 'why', 'Vickie', 'be', 'Walter', 'implicit', 'better', 'other', 'significant', 'variation', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'Walter', 'Robin', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'Walter', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'lines', 'what', 'alternative', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'considerably', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'heard', 'conversation', 'where', 'made', 'decision', 'go', 'way', 'did', 'finished', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'meditate', 'differences', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'how', 'everything', 'played', 'out', 'worth', 'thinking']",The Woodsman
886784,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0007PID84,Lawyeraau,"[2, 3]","This film deals with an unusual topic, as it sneaks a peek into the life of a pedophile. The pedophile in question is Walter (Kevin Bacon), who returns home to try and re-build his life, after spending twelve years in prison for his unspeakable acts involving young girls. Shunned by his community, former friends, and family, with the exception of his affable brother-in-law, Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), Walter's re-entry into society is one that is solitary and bereft of all that makes life worth living.He secures an apartment right across from a grammar school, because that landlord is the only one in town who will rent to him. Walter goes to work in a lumber yard, where he works for the fair-minded Bob (David Alan Grier). There, Walter meets Bob's attractive secretary, Eve (Mary-Kay), who apparently has the hots for him, but whose initially friendly overtures Walter rebuffs. His eye is drawn to the feisty Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick), a seemingly tough, hard living gal with secrets of her own.When Vicki and Walter hook up and get better acquainted, Eve takes their pairing hard and makes it her business to find out more about Walter's past. Meanwhile, Walter and Vicki are becoming an item, and when she finally gets him to reveal something of his past, she is initially aghast to discover that he is a convicted pedophile. Walter reacts to her shock by cutting her off, physically and emotionally .When Eve discovers a treasure trove of information about Walter's past, she shares it with her co-workers. This causes Vicki to come to his defense, and they are eventually reunited. While all this is going on, there are a variety of subplots that further reinforce Walter's isolation and underscore his attempts at living a normal life. He is mandated to visit a therapist as a condition of his release from prison, and it is there that the viewer gets a birds-eye view into why Walter may have the problem that he has.Walter is undeniably attracted to young girls, and the viewer sees him conflicted by his compulsion. Brief and subtle flashbacks to those events that eventually saw him imprisoned further draw the viewer into Walter's personal demons. The viewer even sees Walter occasionally giving into that seemingly irresistible compulsion, only to see him pull back before it takes him to the brink of no return, his quest for normalcy always at odds with his seemingly innate proclivity. The scene in the park with eleven year old Robin (Hannah Pilkes) is a chilling one, as it seems as if Walter will be unable to control his compulsion, only to be brought up short by an unexpected revelation.Meanwhile, Walter is eager to mend bridges with his estranged sister, Annette, who, with her husband, Carlos, has a twelve year old daughter. Annette, however, is far from eager to do so and makes her dislike and mistrust of her pedophile brother evident in a number of ways. Meanwhile, a certain Sgt. Lukas (Mos Def) is keeping tabs on Walter, making sure that he makes Walter feels as low as the regard in which he holds him.All of this serves to create a fascinating portrait of a pedophile. Kevin Bacon gives a stellar, award-worthy performance that certainly merits recognition. It is simply a stunning, tightly controlled performance, and one that will keep the viewer spellbound. If ever there were a performance that was worthy of an Academy Award, it is this performance by Kevin Bacon, which is a career best. It is a shame that it was entirely disregarded by the Academy.Bacon's real life wife, Kyra Sedgwick, likewise gives a performance that is three dimensional and compelling in the role of Vicki, the woman who was able to see some good in this convicted pedophile. The rest of the supporting cast is also excellent in their respective roles. Kudos must also go to first time director Nicole Russell, who makes her debut with this feature film, exhibiting a certain mastery and deftness for one so young. She also wrote this well-nuanced, metaphoric, and intelligent script.

And it was with that in mind that I watched this slowly unfolding character study of a pedophile who has just been released from prison after twelve years.  Kevin Bacon is cast as Walter in this very difficult and demanding role.  He has returned to his hometown and wants to rehabilitate himself.  But his own sister refuses to see him and his brother-in-law tries to befriend him but will not let him meet his 12-year old niece.Walter has been given a job at a lumber yard and keeps to himself, arousing the curiosity of his co-workers.  One is a woman, played by Kyra Sedgwick, who is attracted to him and soon winds up in his bed.  Their romance blossoms but he is still aware of his attraction to little girls.  Unfortunately, his apartment overlooks a schoolyard and he watches the children every day and finds himself following little girls in the mall and on the street.  Eventually, he even follows one into a wooded area.  The scene is full of tension as we watch their interaction.Mos Def is cast as a policeman who visits Walter regularly, saying nasty things about how people like Walter always wind up back in jail. It's an excellent role and he plays it just right.  We love him and hate him at the same time, understanding where he is coming from too.  There is also another co-worker, played by Eve, who doesn't like Walter and discovers his secret on the internet.We learn Walter's history as he visits his therapist who has also suggested that Walter keep a diary.  While keeping this diary he notices a man hanging around the schoolyard and enticing young boys with candy.How this all plays out is the stuff of good drama and excellent directing.  I was totally involved in the story and the complexities of the characters.  The crafting was excellent, with not a wasted word or unnecessary scene.This is not a film for everybody.

Kevin Bacon deserves a lot of credit for his courage in taking this on, and for doing so in a fair and balanced way. His portrayal of a man who would be broadly regarded as the lowest of the low reveals the compulsion that drives the molestor to commit such acts. He also gives the viewer glimpses into the self-disgust and self-hatred that many of these individuals feel. His struggle to control his impulses, and his fear of allowing himself to feel any emotion lest the most hideous one overtake him, is clearly communicated. Dealing with the absolute contempt of all who know his dark secret provides yet another source of deep conflict. The little girl who nearly becomes his next victim turns in a well-controlled, subtle performance. Kyra Sedgwick is also to be admired for her portrayal of a victim who has managed not to let her childhood  trauma ruin or run her life. It must have been strange for her to think of her real-life husband as a sex offender and put herself through all the emotions that would accompany such a revelation.The Woodsman approaches all these conflicts, and many others, in a way that allows the audience to sympathize with the offender without condoning what he did.

886790,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007PID84,mirasreviews,"[2, 4]","""The Woodsman"" is based on the play by Stephen Fechter which tells the story of a pedophile who struggles to lead a normal life after spending 12 years in prison. The film seems to have touched a nerve in a lot of critics and viewers, because it is sympathetic toward a child molester, although not toward his crimes. This is a startling feature film debut for director Nicole Kassell, who takes on a difficult subject with impressive courage, sensitivity, and discretion.Walter (Kevin Bacon) has just been released from prison, where he spent 12 years for fondling preteen girls. Shunned by old friends and family, he is reluctantly offered a job at a lumberyard, where he meets Vickie (Kyra Sedgewick), a plainspoken woman with a difficult past of her own. Isolated by years of imprisonment and the community's revulsion, Walter's only relationships are with his brother-in-law Carlos (Benjamin Bratt), Vickie, with whom he begins an affair, his psychologist, and Sergeant Lucas (Mos Def), a local police officer who harasses him. Walter spends a lot of time looking out of his living room window, which, for better or worse, is across the street from an elementary school. He quickly notices that he is not the only one watching the children.This role is among Kevin Bacon's most outstanding in a long career of impressive character performances. Walter is a man who constantly struggles with a compulsion. He is torn between a very real, but completely unacceptable, emotional need and the need to control his behavior and live a normal life. Walter desperately wants his compulsion to go away. But it never will. The character isn't very talkative, so it's remarkable that Kevin Bacon is able to clearly communicate what's going on in Walter's mind at all times. In his struggle to find a way to live, Walter tempts himself and tests himself, and is sometimes doubtful and sometimes confident of his ability to resist his compulsion.If Walter's struggle were against substance addiction, he might easily be viewed as heroic. But Walter's compulsion is for molesting children, a considerably less fashionable failing and the object of much hysteria. Whether or not his pedophilia could have been averted in his youth had he made an effort is the subject of another story. But of all the movies about addiction that I have seen, this is by far the most powerful representation of inner struggle that I've seen committed to film. So, yes, Walter's plight is sympathetic. Walter characterizes a certain type of pedophile, however. He isn't a rapist. He isn't a sociopath. He doesn't want to hurt anyone. Brutal predators and child-rapists are an entirely different breed, on which I don't think this film is intended to comment.The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005): Bonus features include a ""Getting It Made"" (5 minutes) interview with producer Lee Daniels, a theatrical trailer, 1 deleted and 2 extended scenes, and an audio commentary by director Nicole Kassell. This is a good audio commentary in which Kassell provides scene-by-scene analysis of the film, including discussion of structure, characters, themes, locations, and some technical details.

Most notable, of course, is Kevin Bacon, who has been showing us since _Murder in the First_ that he is quite a capable actor and is likely to show up just anywhere...and his appearance here does not quash that image at all.  Kyra Sedgewick also stars, as well as Benjamin Bratt.  But there are also other recognizable names--Eve, David Alan Grier and Mos Def--though these are a surprise for showing up in a film that is so serious and a little dark as well.  They are also a surprise for how competent they are._The Woodsman_ focuses on Walter (Kevin Bacon), a released child molester out to move onward with his life.  He gets a job at a lumber yard and quickly stirs interest in how withdrawn he is, how damaged.  Kyra Sedgewick is a co-worker who develops an interest for Walter, maybe partly attracted to the fact that he is 'damaged goods.'But of course, life on the outside isn't easy for Walter.  Though he has a tight relationship with his brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt), his sister and neice do not want to have any contact with him, and a detective (Mos Def) is keeping a close eye on every move he makes.  Walter, of course, has his own struggles, for he knows how likely his type is to repeat offend, and in his thinking he had 'never harmed' any of his victims.  Also, he lives across the street from an elementary school, so temptation presents itself regularly.The film itself is a good study of the struggles of this character to move onward with his life, though there are plenty of incentives, both interior and exterior, to give up any impulse to change.  Kevin Bacon is wonderfully reticent though not emotionless, presenting well a tortured soul still trying to determine what is right and wrong.  In the course of this movie, we find out that many characters are damaged in many ways, making the issue of the film not an investigation of who is damaged, but how people sort out the damage in their own lives.  Even Mos Def's character, who may seem a little belligerent and bordering on persecutorial at first, only wants to end pain in the world.The ending of _The Woodsman_ is a little too well wrapped-up and feels a little easy, but the rest of the film is a thorough study of characters who feel very fleshed-out and actual.  They don't always make the best decisions, but that is what makes them so sympathetic.  Most of all, it is clear that the casting for this film was extraordinary, as well as the directing--the act of making a child molester a sympathetic character is challenging, and this film pulls this off well.",4,excellent casting--an intensive character study,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2633,"['one', 'small', 'movies', 'out', 'very', 'intriguing', 'cast', 'Most', 'notable', 'course', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'been', 'showing', '_Murder', 'First_', 'quite', 'capable', 'actor', 'likely', 'show', 'up', 'just', 'anywhere', 'appearance', 'here', 'not', 'quash', 'image', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'also', 'as', 'well', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'recognizable', 'names', 'Eve', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Mos', 'Def', 'are', 'surprise', 'showing', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'serious', 'little', 'dark', 'well', 'are', 'also', 'surprise', 'how', 'competent', 'are._The', 'Woodsman_', 'focuses', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'released', 'child', 'molester', 'move', 'onward', 'life', 'job', 'lumber', 'yard', 'quickly', 'stirs', 'interest', 'how', 'withdrawn', 'how', 'damaged', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'co-worker', 'who', 'interest', 'Walter', 'maybe', 'partly', 'attracted', 'fact', ""'damaged"", 'goods', ""'But"", 'course', 'life', 'outside', ""n't"", 'easy', 'Walter', 'tight', 'relationship', 'brother-in-law', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'sister', 'neice', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'contact', 'detective', 'Mos', 'Def', 'keeping', 'close', 'eye', 'move', 'Walter', 'course', 'own', 'struggles', 'how', 'likely', 'type', 'repeat', 'offend', 'thinking', 'had', 'harmed', 'victims', 'Also', 'street', 'elementary', 'school', 'temptation', 'presents', 'regularly.The', 'film', 'good', 'study', 'struggles', 'character', 'move', 'onward', 'life', 'are', 'plenty', 'incentives', 'interior', 'exterior', 'give', 'up', 'impulse', 'change', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'wonderfully', 'reticent', 'not', 'emotionless', 'presenting', 'well', 'tortured', 'soul', 'still', 'trying', 'determine', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'course', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'damaged', 'many', 'ways', 'making', 'issue', 'film', 'not', 'investigation', 'who', 'damaged', 'how', 'people', 'sort', 'out', 'damage', 'own', 'lives', 'Even', 'Mos', 'Def', 'character', 'who', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'belligerent', 'bordering', 'persecutorial', 'first', 'only', 'end', 'pain', 'world.The', 'ending', '_The', 'Woodsman_', 'little', 'too', 'well', 'wrapped-up', 'little', 'easy', 'rest', 'film', 'thorough', 'study', 'characters', 'who', 'feel', 'very', 'fleshed-out', 'actual', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'best', 'decisions', 'what', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'Most', 'clear', 'casting', 'film', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'act', 'making', 'child', 'molester', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'challenging', 'film', 'off', 'well']",The Woodsman

To attempt to invest the role with some humanity, in my view, requires courage beyond belief.Kevin Bacon, one of Hollywood's more underappreciated talents, manages to pull it off though in this dark, disturbing tale of a convicted child molester trying to put his past behind him after release from a 12-year bid.The movie seems to take no particular position on paedophilia and just looks on unblinkingly while Bacon, who plays Walter, struggles unsuccessfully to fight his demons. We are offered no explanation as to how he turned out the way he is and there is no resolution or redemption before the end credits begin to roll. Walter does manage to find love in the arms of the lovely Vicke, played by Kyra Sedgwick but this offers no solace. He still has the feelings he has and, as an encounter with a little girl in the park clearly demonstrates, he is still a danger to children. This makes the movie uncomfortable to watch but it's so intelligent and compelling at the same time, we dare not take our eyes away.There is brilliant support from Benjamin Bratt who plays Walter's brother-in-law. His wife, i.e. Walter's sister refuses to see him outright and it's clear to see the man's loyalties are torn. He tries to be supportive to Walter though, and is even prepared to sit down and have a beer with him but isn't prepared to have him at his home and definitely isn't prepared to have him in contact with his daughter. I guess loyalty only can go so far.But the movie was made for me personally by Mos Def, who gives an astounding performance as a suspicious local detective who keeps a wary eye on Walter. Mos exudes a cool, restrained menace that just proves what a good actor he is. Even though the detective he plays treats Walter with humanity, even politeness, you can also see his utter contempt for what Walter stands for and you imagine him itching for an excuse to be able to go for his gun and put a bullet into Walter's head, putting him out of his misery while making the neighbourhood a safer place at the same time. I often wonder what would've happened if Mos hadn't taken the detour into hip hop and had focused on his acting career instead. (I knew him as an actor on ""The Cosby Mysteries"" before I knew about his rapping). He's definitely a much better actor than many of the rappers turned actors who have successful movie careers right now - DMX, LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Ice Cube. I'm hoping maybe now he figures it's time to go for it.Speaking of rappers, Eve also makes an appearance (with black hair, no less!) and puts in a good performance, as the girl who believes the neighbourhood has the right to know there's a child molester in their midst.Due to its subject matter this movie does leave a strange taste in the mouth but as a piece of art it is not only brave, it is utterly faultless.

Tough subject. Bacon gives a fine performance as a man trying to find his behavior as monstrous as society sees it. Tries, fails, tries again and perhaps succeeds when he finds a kind of co-traveller lurking around a schooyard across the street from his apartment and shows him less mercy than he did himself during recent stalking trips through a public park. His redemption comes through the kind of vengeful violence that he rightly fears (and to some extent, suffers) from others, but the darker implications of this redemption are unfortunately left unexplored. He even gets to move in with his new and very mature girlfriend, well played by Bacon's real-life wife, Kyra Sedgwick.

886796,A2WFBIPVZFYDL5,B0007PID84,"Randal Rauser ""The Tentative Apologist""","[0, 0]","&#8220;The Woodsman&#8221; opens with convicted pedophile Walter (Kevin Bacon) returning home after a twelve year stint in prison. Not surprisingly, he finds that his entire support network has evaporated. After all, who wants to be associated with a pedophile?But how blurred the criteria of social condemnation can be. In the late eighties the glam metal band &#8220;Winger&#8221; had a song called &#8220;Seventeen&#8221; in which the slimy lead singer Kip Winger crooned of bedding down with a girl perhaps in her senior year in high school. &#8220;Mamma says she&#8217;s too young, but she&#8217;s old enough for me!&#8221; he wailed smugly. And that was apparently okay. After all, the song climbed the charts. And then there&#8217;s the subtly creepy Ringo Starr singing &#8220;You&#8217;re sixteen, you&#8217;re beautiful, and you&#8217;re mine.&#8221; But perhaps most disturbing of all is Gary Puckett&#8217;s skin-crawling &#8220;Young Girl&#8221; in which he moans &#8220;Young girl, get out of my mind. My love for you is way out of line! Better run girl, you&#8217;re much too young girl!&#8221; Just how young are we talking Gary? Brrrrr. How was that song a hit in 68&#8242;? This is almost like listening to Humbert sing of his longing for the vivacious Dolores (Lolita).Walter does not have the benefit of a hit song like Kip Winger, Ringo Starr or Gary Puckett. But he has certainly taken his share of hits, physical and otherwise. And yet he still can&#8217;t seem to get away from the children. As &#8220;The Woodsman&#8221; progresses we see him begin to hang out across from the school yard &#8212; every parent&#8217;s worst nightmare &#8212; and eventually to hone in on one young girl. But at the same time he is consumed by guilt and regret and struggling to overcome his impulses. He really wants to have a normal relationship with a woman, but he also has these screaming desires.Walter is dirty, disgusting, the ultimate social outcast. And without restraint we pour out our hatred and disapprobation upon him. But what if Walter is the lead singer, scrubbed up with spandex and stage make up and he meets the fourteen year old for a brief tryst under the stage? The evil and damage done to the young victim are the same. (Listen to Larry Norman&#8217;s classic song &#8220;Pardon Me&#8221; which narrates the emotional toll on the young groupie.)We seem surprisingly tolerant as a society of the rock star with pedophilic tendencies. (I&#8217;m sure you remember where you were when you learned that Michael Jackson died.) And it ain&#8217;t just music. What about the advertising of Abercrombie and Fitch, with their push-up bras for eight year olds? And what about Bratz dolls, some in leather, lipstick and diapers? Walter&#8217;s crimes are not excused. But perhaps we should spend more time reflecting on the crimes of the rest of us.The most important lesson from &#8220;The Woodsman&#8221; is that, to put it succinctly, we&#8217;re all crap. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important one. (For that matter, so is Steve James&#8217; 2002 documentary &#8220;Stevie&#8221;, a close up look at a pedophile who, incredibly enough, is also somehow a human being.) Anyways, here&#8217;s how the ever-eloquent Roger Ebert put it:&#8220;The Woodsman&#8221; understands this at the very heart of its being, and that is why it succeeds as more than just the story of this character. It has relevance for members of the audience who would never in any way be even remotely capable of Walter&#8217;s crime. We are quick to forgive our own trespasses, slower to forgive those of others. The challenge of a moral life is to do nothing that needs forgiveness. In that sense, we&#8217;re all out on parole.randalrauser.com",4,Pedophiles and rock stars,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,3758,"['8220', 'Woodsman', '8221', 'convicted', 'pedophile', 'Walter', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'returning', 'home', 'twelve', 'year', 'stint', 'prison', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'entire', 'support', 'network', 'evaporated', 'who', 'be', 'associated', 'pedophile', 'how', 'blurred', 'criteria', 'social', 'condemnation', 'can', 'be', 'late', 'eighties', 'glam', 'metal', 'band', '8220', 'Winger', '8221', 'had', 'song', 'called', '8220', 'Seventeen', '8221', 'slimy', 'lead', 'singer', 'Kip', 'Winger', 'crooned', 'bedding', 'down', 'girl', 'perhaps', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', '8220', 'Mamma', '8217', 's', 'too', 'young', '8217', 'old', 'enough', '8221', 'wailed', 'smugly', 'was', 'apparently', 'okay', 'song', 'climbed', 'charts', 'then', '8217', 's', 'subtly', 'creepy', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'singing', '8220', '8217', 're', 'sixteen', '8217', 'beautiful', '8217', 'mine.', '8221', 'perhaps', 'most', 'disturbing', 'Gary', 'Puckett', '8217', 'skin-crawling', '8220', 'Young', 'Girl', '8221', '8220', 'Young', 'girl', 'get', 'mind', 'love', 'way', 'line', 'Better', 'run', 'girl', '8217', 're', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'girl', '8221', 'Just', 'how', 'young', 'are', 'talking', 'Gary', 'Brrrrr', 'How', 'was', 'song', 'hit', '68', '8242', 'almost', 'like', 'listening', 'Humbert', 'sing', 'longing', 'vivacious', 'Dolores', 'Lolita', '.Walter', 'not', 'have', 'benefit', 'hit', 'song', 'Kip', 'Winger', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'Gary', 'Puckett', 'certainly', 'taken', 'share', 'hits', 'physical', 'otherwise', 'yet', 'still', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'get', 'away', 'children', '8220', 'Woodsman', '8221', 'see', 'begin', 'hang', 'out', 'school', 'yard', '8212', 'parent', '8217', 'worst', 'nightmare', '8212', 'eventually', 'hone', 'one', 'young', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'consumed', 'guilt', 'regret', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'impulses', 'really', 'have', 'normal', 'relationship', 'woman', 'also', 'screaming', 'desires.Walter', 'dirty', 'disgusting', 'ultimate', 'social', 'outcast', 'restraint', 'pour', 'out', 'hatred', 'disapprobation', 'what', 'Walter', 'lead', 'singer', 'scrubbed', 'up', 'spandex', 'stage', 'make', 'up', 'fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'brief', 'tryst', 'stage', 'evil', 'damage', 'done', 'young', 'victim', 'are', 'same', 'Listen', 'Larry', 'Norman', '8217', 'classic', 'song', '8220', 'Pardon', 'Me', '8221', 'emotional', 'toll', 'young', 'groupie', 'seem', 'surprisingly', 'tolerant', 'society', 'rock', 'star', 'pedophilic', 'tendencies', '8217', 'sure', 'remember', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'learned', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'died', 'ain', '8217', 'just', 'music', 'What', 'advertising', 'Abercrombie', 'Fitch', 'push-up', 'bras', 'eight', 'year', 'olds', 'what', 'Bratz', 'dolls', 'leather', 'lipstick', 'diapers', 'Walter', '8217', 's', 'crimes', 'are', 'not', 'excused', 'perhaps', 'should', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'reflecting', 'crimes', 'rest', 'us.The', 'most', 'important', 'lesson', '8220', 'Woodsman', '8221', 'put', 'succinctly', '8217', 're', 'crap', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'important', 'one', 'matter', 'so', 'Steve', 'James', '8217', '2002', 'documentary', '8220', 'Stevie', '8221', 'close', 'up', 'look', 'pedophile', 'who', 'incredibly', 'enough', 'also', 'somehow', 'human', 'being', 'Anyways', 'here', '8217', 's', 'how', 'ever-eloquent', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'put', '8220', 'Woodsman', '8221', 'very', 'heart', 'being', 'why', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'character', 'relevance', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'way', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'capable', 'Walter', '8217', 's', 'crime', 'are', 'quick', 'forgive', 'own', 'trespasses', 'slower', 'forgive', 'others', 'challenge', 'moral', 'life', 'do', 'nothing', 'forgiveness', 'sense', '8217', 're', 'out', 'parole.randalrauser.com']",The Woodsman

886800,A3935A3N43XZHJ,B0007PID84,"Rebel Cry ""Thine Will not mine be done.""","[3, 3]","Never has a drama thumped me at the core as this one. The movie was more real than anything else portrayed about this issue yet as wonderfully done as if it were an  greatest artist's fiction.An irony...all the story and characters in this movie were fiction. However, this film shows more truth and reality about the pedophile than the so called reality series, To Catch A Predator.I think this fact has mostly to do with those portrayed on that series are not one in the same as Kevin Bacon's character. Bacon's character portrays one of society's most common yet misunderstood issues, the American pedophile. To Catch a Predator portrays lonely, STUPID, low life men who aren't popular with the ladies and would rather meet a virgin online than allow their cheap selves to buy hookers or risk HIV. Seriously, think about it. They don't call it perverted justice for nothing.Back to the film.  The Woodsman is to pedophile as to The Beautiful Mind is to Schizophrenia. After seeing The Beautiful Mind with Russell Crow, a person with schizophrenia became more than just the insane, screaming, possessed village idiot in our minds. He became human.In the Woodsman the pedophile became more than just a lusting creepy devil posted on your state's web site. He became human.Kevin Bacon's character demanded and forced us to share his soul with his. To make us feel as he felt and suffer as he did.There are so many great scenes in the movie. My favorite three:When the police sergeant tearfully complains that this world is without Woodsmen. The scene begged our society, asking, how can we live ourselves knowing that we live in a world where there are men who can commit such evil to children?The other scene I loved was towards the end. He is with the girl alone in the park and he begins to give in to his desires. She is happy with him and he honestly believes she will enjoy sexual advances. Yet, when he sees in her eyes and tremble from all the pain her Father caused her, he resolves to not do the same. It seemed that the love he felt was stronger than his desire to take advantage of her, it showed the separation between him and true monsters out there...a destination few in society recognize. He showed that in spite of his criminal record, he of all people was a, ""Woodsman.""And of course, he took this realization to the next level in my third favorite scene. He trashed and beat the Candyman character to a pulp and that action ultimately led to that creep being arrested for previous exploits against children.The Woodsman forced and made us understand that not all pedophiles fit the class of the sterotype and that those who actually do harm children are in a class of their own. The movie helped make sense a very dark issue, that the majority of pedophiles evidently suffer the same emotions, feelings, and conflicts that alcoholics, drug abusers, or even what homo sexuals go through in conservative communities.It is a beautiful and sad movie. That such a film did not win an Oscar gives the most creditable evidence that the academy is ruled by politics rather than artistic distinctionprops to Mr. Bacon and the writers of The Woodsman.",5,Beautifully and sadly real,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,3161,"['Never', 'drama', 'thumped', 'core', 'one', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'real', 'anything', 'else', 'portrayed', 'issue', 'yet', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'were', 'greatest', 'artist', 'fiction.An', 'irony', 'story', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'fiction', 'However', 'film', 'more', 'truth', 'reality', 'pedophile', 'so', 'called', 'reality', 'series', 'Catch', 'A', 'Predator.I', 'think', 'fact', 'mostly', 'do', 'portrayed', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'one', 'same', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'Bacon', 'character', 'one', 'society', 'most', 'common', 'yet', 'misunderstood', 'issues', 'American', 'pedophile', 'Catch', 'Predator', 'lonely', 'STUPID', 'low', 'life', 'men', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'popular', 'ladies', 'would', 'rather', 'meet', 'virgin', 'online', 'allow', 'cheap', 'selves', 'buy', 'hookers', 'risk', 'HIV', 'Seriously', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'call', 'perverted', 'justice', 'nothing.Back', 'film', 'Woodsman', 'pedophile', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Schizophrenia', 'seeing', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'Russell', 'Crow', 'person', 'schizophrenia', 'became', 'more', 'just', 'insane', 'screaming', 'possessed', 'village', 'idiot', 'minds', 'became', 'Woodsman', 'pedophile', 'became', 'more', 'just', 'lusting', 'creepy', 'devil', 'posted', 'state', 'web', 'site', 'became', 'human.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'demanded', 'forced', 'share', 'soul', 'make', 'feel', 'felt', 'suffer', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'favorite', 'three', 'When', 'police', 'sergeant', 'tearfully', 'world', 'Woodsmen', 'scene', 'begged', 'society', 'asking', 'how', 'can', 'live', 'knowing', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'men', 'who', 'can', 'commit', 'such', 'evil', 'children', 'other', 'scene', 'loved', 'was', 'end', 'girl', 'alone', 'park', 'give', 'desires', 'happy', 'honestly', 'will', 'enjoy', 'sexual', 'advances', 'Yet', 'when', 'eyes', 'tremble', 'pain', 'Father', 'caused', 'not', 'do', 'same', 'seemed', 'love', 'felt', 'was', 'stronger', 'desire', 'take', 'advantage', 'showed', 'separation', 'true', 'monsters', 'there', 'destination', 'few', 'society', 'recognize', 'showed', 'spite', 'criminal', 'record', 'people', 'was', 'Woodsman', 'course', 'took', 'realization', 'next', 'level', 'third', 'favorite', 'scene', 'trashed', 'beat', 'Candyman', 'character', 'pulp', 'action', 'ultimately', 'led', 'creep', 'being', 'arrested', 'previous', 'exploits', 'children.The', 'Woodsman', 'forced', 'made', 'understand', 'not', 'pedophiles', 'fit', 'class', 'sterotype', 'who', 'actually', 'do', 'harm', 'children', 'are', 'class', 'own', 'movie', 'helped', 'make', 'sense', 'very', 'dark', 'issue', 'majority', 'pedophiles', 'evidently', 'suffer', 'same', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'conflicts', 'alcoholics', 'drug', 'abusers', 'even', 'what', 'homo', 'sexuals', 'go', 'conservative', 'communities.It', 'beautiful', 'sad', 'movie', 'such', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'win', 'Oscar', 'most', 'creditable', 'evidence', 'academy', 'ruled', 'politics', 'rather', 'artistic', 'distinctionprops', 'Mr.', 'Bacon', 'writers', 'Woodsman']",The Woodsman

Pedophilia is hardly box-office credentialed fare, and that Bacon's brilliantly nuanced acting can transcend such an unpalatable condition galvanizes our sympathies. Bacon/'Walter' is rehabilitated in a dowdy flat opposite a schoolyard and so recidivist temptation is at his door from the  moment of release into mainstream. His therapist gets him to reluctantly keep a diary. His lover, Sedgwick,a boyish forklift driver at the timber yard where he's been offered work, is a sympathetic, fellow-traveller. And parole cop, the slightly built but cockily perspicacious, Mos Def taunts him with the parable of the woodsman in Red Riding Hood. Mos Def's fondling of the cherrywood table Walter has fashioned, seethes with lethal intent. As his analyst suggests, the merry-go-round Walter feels he's riding, gives him a chance to revisit former behaviour and see something he'd missed on an earlier circuit. Betweeen Sedgwick's coaxing acceptance, Mos Def's simmering loathing, and workplace harassment, Walter hurries back to the woods and a re-encounter with Little Red Riding Hood. It's a few minutes of knock-out cinema, a truly transformative event, bearing the entire weight of the film. The pale weather of the film, not quite bleak but asking for warmth, is perfect.

Suddenly, a young woman behind me started talking to me saying, ""Now that was really an intense movie!""  I turned to face her and noticed that she was  wearing a uniform with a name tag from the ""Dvd"" store I was in.  I kind of smiled and she continued chatting (Maybe because she was being a good sales person I suppose or maybe just because she was a ""Chattie"" Cathy)...Anyway, she told me briefy what it was about and that all the actors in the movie did it for free!  I looked her directly in the eyes with confusion written upon my face, this sort of blank expression and said quickly back, ""Free"", What do you exactly mean by...free""?  She kind of smiled and said, ""Oh yeah, it's true, all the actors in this film never received a dime to act in this film.  They all just wanted to be in the film and get it out!  (O.k. she had me...

Not nauseating in the conventional sense, but because of the subject matter, child molestation.  It really burned me up watching many of the scenes, that I actually found myself digging my fingers into my palms.  Especially during the scene with the little girl on the park bench.  I found myself so engulfed that I actually said out loud, ...""Dear lord please don't let him do what I think he is going to do""!!!

886803,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0007PID84,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","The Woodsman (Nicole Kassel, 2004)I am stymied by Hollywood. (Anyone who's been reading my reviews for more than a month is probably already well aware of this.) Every once in a while-- and not infrequently-- a movie that, were it given a chance, would likely perform in a sensational manner is completely overlooked, while films of deep inferiority take over the cineplexes. As a case in point, consider Julian Schabel's wonderful 2000 film Before Night Falls-- if not the best film extant at the present time, easily in the top ten. Released on Christmas Day of 2000, Before Night Falls opened on just eight screens, and drew an impressive (for a movie opening on eight screens) over-$10,000 per theatre. While a select few were treated to a first look, the rest of us made do with such fare as Dracula 2000, which opened on the same day on 2,204 screens-- and in the same time period as Before Night Falls, pulled in less than $4,000 per screen. The worst part is, I'm pretty sure there's not a single Hollywood exec who looked back on Christmas 2000 and thought to himself, ""man, we should have given Before Night Falls the big push and scrapped Dracula 2000.""Four years and a day later, Nicole Kassel (currently adapting the late Arthur Miller's The Ride Down Mt. Morgan) saw The Woodsman open on just six screens. It didn't quite make the $10,000-per-screen mark, but it performed respectably enough. In contrast, that year's Dracula 2000 was Fat Albert, which opened on a remarkable-even-today 2,674 screens. Amusingly, it grossed almost to the penny the same amount per screen as Dracula 2000-- $3,747. (One wonders how many of those patrons demanded, but did not get, refunds.) Once again, I doubt there's a single studio exec who regretted consigning The Woodsman to the ""let's open it on enough screens to get considered for the Oscars"" pit while covering the rest of the moviegoing world in the suffocating crap that was Fat Albert. Are you getting why I am stymied by Hollywood?There are some films so powerful, so emotionally engaging, that I can't imagine even the most cold-hearted entertainment lawyer not looking at them and saying ""you want to open Fat Albert on that many screens and neglect this? Are you mad?"" The Woodsman is one of those films. In it, Kevin Bacon plays Walter Rossman, a convicted child molester paroled after twelve years in prison. He goes back to work at a lumberyard where he has previously worked (no one there but the boss was around when he got sent up, it would seem), gets an apartment overlooking a grade school, and goes to see a therapist a lot. (Oddly, a parole officer never makes an appearance.) Rossman just wants to get on with his life, but a co-worker whose advances he spurned is first day on the job (Eve, in a remarkably understated performance) and a cop who hates sex offenders (Mos Def) aren't going to let him be. Worse off, there's a suspicious-looking guy in a white car who hangs out across the street from the grade school, and Walter is torn between his fear of and hatred for the cops and the knowledge that this guy might well be another child molester.It's a lot for an eighty-seven-minute film to handle, and for the most part, it's all handled with expertise. Kevin Bacon's performance is stunning, perhaps even better than his job in Stir of Echoes. Even better, the rest of the cast supporting him also turn in career-best-or-close-to-it roles, including David Alan Grier in a surprising dramatic turn, given far too little screen time, and Bacon's real-life wife Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer), who hasn't been this good since Singles. The performances alone make this a great film, but there's more to it than that. Kassel has an excellent eye for detail (look at the face of the girl in the mall when she notices Bacon staring at him; her change of expression is absolutely perfect) that can make all the difference between being above-average and being in the stratosphere. In fact, about the only thing really wrong with this film can probably be blamed on the play from which it's adapted; there's one plot thread that is left at the end framing a gaping hole. I'm all for ambiguity, but that was kind of ridiculous.Still, this is one of the best movies you will see this year. Do so as soon as you can. It's flirting with inclusion in my 100-best list. **** ",5,Absolutely stunning.,1126137600,"09 8, 2005",2005,4339,"['Woodsman', 'Nicole', 'Kassel', '2004', 'am', 'stymied', 'Hollywood', 'Anyone', 'who', 'been', 'reading', 'reviews', 'more', 'month', 'probably', 'already', 'well', 'aware', 'once', 'while', 'not', 'infrequently', 'movie', 'were', 'given', 'chance', 'would', 'likely', 'perform', 'sensational', 'manner', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'films', 'deep', 'inferiority', 'take', 'cineplexes', 'case', 'point', 'consider', 'Julian', 'Schabel', 'wonderful', '2000', 'film', 'Night', 'Falls', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'extant', 'present', 'time', 'easily', 'top', 'ten', 'Released', 'Christmas', 'Day', '2000', 'Night', 'Falls', 'opened', 'just', 'eight', 'screens', 'drew', 'impressive', 'movie', 'opening', 'eight', 'screens', 'over-', '10,000', 'theatre', 'select', 'few', 'were', 'treated', 'first', 'look', 'rest', 'made', 'do', 'such', 'fare', 'Dracula', '2000', 'opened', 'same', 'day', '2,204', 'screens', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'Night', 'Falls', 'pulled', 'less', '4,000', 'screen', 'worst', 'part', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'not', 'single', 'Hollywood', 'exec', 'who', 'looked', 'back', 'Christmas', '2000', 'thought', 'man', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Night', 'Falls', 'big', 'push', 'scrapped', 'Dracula', '2000', 'Four', 'years', 'day', 'later', 'Nicole', 'Kassel', 'currently', 'adapting', 'late', 'Arthur', 'Miller', 'Ride', 'Down', 'Mt', 'Morgan', 'saw', 'Woodsman', 'open', 'just', 'six', 'screens', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', '10,000-per-screen', 'mark', 'performed', 'respectably', 'enough', 'contrast', 'year', 'Dracula', '2000', 'was', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'opened', 'remarkable-even-today', '2,674', 'screens', 'Amusingly', 'grossed', 'almost', 'penny', 'same', 'amount', 'per', 'screen', 'Dracula', '2000', '3,747', 'One', 'how', 'many', 'patrons', 'demanded', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'refunds', 'Once', 'again', 'doubt', 'single', 'studio', 'exec', 'who', 'regretted', 'consigning', 'Woodsman', 'let', 'open', 'enough', 'screens', 'get', 'considered', 'Oscars', 'pit', 'covering', 'rest', 'moviegoing', 'world', 'suffocating', 'crap', 'was', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'Are', 'getting', 'why', 'am', 'stymied', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'films', 'so', 'powerful', 'so', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'even', 'most', 'cold-hearted', 'entertainment', 'lawyer', 'not', 'looking', 'saying', 'want', 'open', 'Fat', 'Albert', 'many', 'screens', 'neglect', 'Are', 'mad', 'Woodsman', 'one', 'films', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Walter', 'Rossman', 'convicted', 'child', 'molester', 'paroled', 'twelve', 'years', 'prison', 'back', 'work', 'lumberyard', 'where', 'previously', 'worked', 'one', 'there', 'boss', 'was', 'around', 'when', 'got', 'sent', 'up', 'would', 'seem', 'apartment', 'overlooking', 'grade', 'school', 'see', 'therapist', 'lot', 'Oddly', 'parole', 'officer', 'never', 'appearance', 'Rossman', 'just', 'get', 'life', 'co-worker', 'advances', 'spurned', 'first', 'day', 'job', 'Eve', 'remarkably', 'understated', 'performance', 'cop', 'who', 'sex', 'offenders', 'Mos', 'Def', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'let', 'be', 'Worse', 'off', 'suspicious-looking', 'guy', 'white', 'car', 'who', 'out', 'street', 'grade', 'school', 'Walter', 'torn', 'fear', 'hatred', 'cops', 'knowledge', 'guy', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'child', 'molester.It', 'lot', 'eighty-seven-minute', 'film', 'handle', 'most', 'part', 'handled', 'expertise', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'stunning', 'perhaps', 'even', 'better', 'job', 'Stir', 'Echoes', 'Even', 'better', 'rest', 'cast', 'supporting', 'also', 'turn', 'career-best-or-close-to-it', 'roles', 'including', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'given', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Bacon', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Closer', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'good', 'Singles', 'performances', 'alone', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'more', 'Kassel', 'excellent', 'eye', 'detail', 'look', 'face', 'girl', 'mall', 'when', 'Bacon', 'staring', 'change', 'expression', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'being', 'above-average', 'being', 'stratosphere', 'fact', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'wrong', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'blamed', 'play', 'adapted', 'one', 'plot', 'thread', 'left', 'end', 'framing', 'gaping', 'hole', ""'m"", 'ambiguity', 'was', 'kind', 'ridiculous.Still', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'will', 'see', 'year', 'Do', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'flirting', 'inclusion', '100-best', 'list', '****']",The Woodsman

I also applaud him for taking on the subject matter of pedophilia and humanizing it in a way that does not try to convince us that child molestation is a misunderstood condition undeserving of public ridicule as much as it tells us that behind the monster facade of the pedophile is often a tortured soul.This is the type of film that will never get the kudos it deserves simply because of its controversial subject matter.  And I agree with one reviewer who said Bacon should have gotten an Oscar nod.  His performance was so incredible that he achieved what few actors do - he made me believe he wasn't acting!

886806,ALS0041SS519N,B0007PID84,ROGER L. FOREMAN,"[2, 2]","Wow.  How did Kevin Bacon not get nominated for something, and how did this movie fly under my radar screen until very recently. . . ?  Obviously the subject matter is ""distasteful"" and ""uncomfortable.""  Walter's self-awareness, self-doubt, self-loathing, self-improvement, and self-preservation are incredibly compelling when presented in such a short feature.  Of course we don't know whether or not to ""like"" his character (as one earlier reviewer questioned)--that's the whole point. . . !  He is both sympathetic and repulsive, as are his actions.This movie puts a face, albeit a fictional one, to a very real problem in our society.  How do we stop crime while rehabiliting criminals?  It is a difficult catch-22.  We want to punish those who do wrong, but we have no way to truly ""fix"" them.  Our legal system sets free many individuals who have no right to be walking the streets to commit further crimes.  In contrast, many people who have made past mistakes are given no opportunity to ""move on with their lives"" without judgment, harassment, and discrimination by those around them.  What do we do. . . ?Does Walter deserve the proverbial ""second chance""?  Did he deserve a longer sentence in the first place?  If his own family cannot forgive him, why should society as a whole, much less a coworker with her own checkered past. . . ?  Is he truly capable of making rational decisions regarding his desires?  Do we forgive him or punish him further?  Does he become a productive member of society or just a ""repeat offender""?  Does our system truly allow him to make that choice?  Should it. . . ?Wow, that's a pile of questions from a movie (and a short one at that, thus only four stars--the writer and director could have explored this character even more).  If all of Hollywood were as committed as this to putting forth such complex ideas and characters, who knows what might happen.  Some people don't like movies that leave more questions unanswered than answered, and this is one of those films.  Again, Kevin Bacon certainly deserved a nomination of some sort.  The producers and director deserve some recognition for having the brass to put out a movie that would be both controversial and possibly productive--the former is very easy to do, the latter much more difficult. . . .Bottom Line:  Most definitely worth a watch/rental, at the very least.  As a parent, I was challenged to examine my positions on the laws, their enforcement (or lack thereof), and the consequences of both.  As a movie-goer, I loved the range of emotions that Walter's character was allowed to express so well through Kevin Bacon.  Two authors I have read recently, Edward Bunker (LITTLE BOY BLUE, DOG EAT DOG, NO BEAST SO FIERCE) and Russell Banks (RULE OF THE BONE), have effectively addressed similar topics involving the United States criminal justice system.  This movie does so as effectively in a different format.

886807,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0007PID84,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","Kevin Bacon gives the performance of a lifetime in ""The Woodsman,"" an astonishingly brave film that confronts an issue few moviemakers have ever had the courage to tackle - pedophilia.  Child molesters have become the true monsters of the modern psyche.  So repelled are we by their behavior that we shun even the most basic attempts to try and ""understand"" them.  For pedophiles violate that most sacred duty adults have of protecting children from harm at any and all costs.  It is for this reason that even the most hardened criminal will often recoil at the actions of a child molester.  It's small wonder, then, that filmmakers have been so reluctant to approach this hyper-sensitive subject.  Who wants to open himself up to all the slings and arrows that will inevitably come flying his way the moment he puts this topic on the screen?  For no matter how evenhanded and subtle the treatment, any writer or director courageous enough to take on the issue will have to face the charge of trying to ""humanize"" those whom it is far easier for the rest of us to continue thinking of as subhuman.  But what price do we pay for such an attitude?  Don't we stand a better chance of overcoming this tragic problem by trying to comprehend the mindset of pedophiles rather than calling them ""monsters"" and, thus, dismissing them out of hand?Those who made ""The Woodsman"" certainly think so, for they have come up with a finely crafted study that neither sugarcoats the tragic effects of pedophilia nor demonizes the people who commit the act.  Bacon plays Walter, a 45-year-old man who has just been paroled after a twelve-year sentence for molesting two underage girls.  Even though he is wracked with guilt and self-hatred and seems to want to ""change"" his ways now that he`s back on the outside, Walter has, unwisely, chosen to place himself in the way of temptation by renting an apartment directly across the street from an elementary school, where he not only gets a full view of the students there, but also keeps a watchful eye on another pedophile operating the turf.  Walter has also found employment at a local lumber company where he meets a young woman who is strangely attracted to him and who insists on knowing just what the ""secret"" is that has placed such an obvious burden on the man's soul and spirit.  For Walter is a man waging a war on two fronts: one against the outside world that wants to revile rather than understand him, and the other against his own personal demons of temptation, guilt and self-loathing.  It is here where Bacon truly triumphs as an actor, for he never allows us to forget the titanic struggle taking place within this man's tormented psyche.  In every movement, every gesture, every line spoken and unspoken, the pain is there for us to see.At one point, crushed with the burden of living with this aspect of his character that he himself cannot explain, he breaks down in despair crying ""I am not a monster.""  And he finds ""redemption"" of sorts when he turns on another pedophile, acting out of the same kind of rage that has been vented on him all these years.  It's as disturbing and unsettling a moment for the audience as it is for the character, for we really don't know how we are supposed to react to this incident.  Are we to cheer Walter for performing an act of righteous anger, or are we to see him as a pathetic figure taking his frustrations out on a person who should be eliciting his empathy not provoking his outrage?  Or is it a form of sublimation, lashing out at the part of himself he has come so much to hate?  Indeed, it is this very moral ambiguity, this refusal to see things in black-and-white terms that makes this such a challenging, thought provoking and adult movie.What is most striking about ""The Woodsman"" is that writer Steven Fetcher and director Nicole Kassell never sensationalize their subject matter.  The tone of the film is moody and subdued throughout, perfectly reflected in the harsh drabness of a working class neighborhood.  Kassell stays primarily focused on Walter as he goes about his business of trying to get through each and every day as best he can.  She also provides a few brilliant touches that demonstrate her skill and artistry as a director.  For instance, in one scene Walter is riding on a bus when he notices a young girl sitting a few seats in front of him.  We see him pull the cord to get off at the next stop.  Then, Kassell gives us a shot of the door opening and closing with no one having walked through it, indicating, in a subtle and oblique way, that Walter has chosen to stay on the bus so he can follow the girl as she gets off at her stop.  Similarly, Kassell keeps the camera inside the bus as we see the girl walking to a nearby park.  For a moment, we are led to believe that perhaps we are seeing all this through Walter's eyes - that he has actually chosen to stay on the bus and not pursue his intended victim.  But then the camera cuts to a shot from outside the bus and we see that Walter, much to our dismay, has, indeed, stepped off.In addition to Bacon, there are stunning performances from Kyra Sedgwick as Vickie, the girl who sees some value in Walter that others cannot see; Benjamin Bratt as Walter's sympathetic brother-in-law who, Walter believes, may be having sexual feelings for his own 12-year-old daughter; and Hannah Pilkes, as the little girl who may be Walter's next victim.""The Woodsman"" is probably the first serious attempt to make a thoughtful movie about a child molester since Fritz Lang's ""M"" in 1930.  Those who would accuse ""The Woodsman"" of trying to generate sympathy for pedophiles are probably barking up the wrong tree here, for if the film shows us anything, it is that even a ""reformed"" molester can continue to pose a threat to children, even after he has ""paid his debt to society.""  I suspect that the police officer in the film speaks for a large segment of the population when he wonders aloud why the justice system doesn't just keep such people locked up for the duration of their lives.

Schultz,"[5, 9]","If you go to this movie expecting to find a telling drama about the hyprocisy and sheer hysteria that often surrounds our prosecution of child molesters - you will be disappointed. This movie does not tackle the big questions about the cause and effect of pedophilia. I am not sure what The Woodsman hoped to achieve, other than to perhaps humanize a child molester a little by giving him a biography and a life after his release from prison.However the life that this movie assigns to Kevin Bacon's character is a highly improbable one. He is settled across from a school, acquires a beautiful girlfriend, and most unlikely of all - finds child molestation to be almost ubiquitous around him. The majority of male figures who come on the scene prove to be actual or potential molesters. There is the man Kevin Bacon can see from his window, luring children into a car. There's Kevin Bacon's brother-in-law, who has to be confronted with the fact that his ""love"" for his daughter may be going too far. Finally, the girl whom Bacon approaches in the park turns out to be only too accustomed to such approaches, apparently having had experience with subtle progressions of familiarity from her own father.Is the movie's point that all men are just a hair's breadth away from molesting? I don't think that was the intention, but that's about the only conclusion the movie leaves us with. It's a well-acted, but ultimately pointless exercise. The producers of The Woodsman took a brave first step in even venturing into this territory. Portraying a pedophile as anything other than a stereotypic ""sicko, pervert"" is not a popular move. However, The Woodsman missed its chance to say something really important about the kind of person who molests children, and mostly, about our reactions to such a person.",3,A Missed Opportunity,1145318400,"04 18, 2006",2006,1802,"['go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'find', 'telling', 'drama', 'hyprocisy', 'sheer', 'hysteria', 'often', 'prosecution', 'child', 'molesters', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'not', 'tackle', 'big', 'questions', 'cause', 'effect', 'pedophilia', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Woodsman', 'hoped', 'achieve', 'other', 'perhaps', 'humanize', 'child', 'molester', 'little', 'giving', 'biography', 'life', 'release', 'life', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'highly', 'improbable', 'one', 'settled', 'school', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'most', 'unlikely', 'finds', 'child', 'molestation', 'be', 'almost', 'ubiquitous', 'majority', 'male', 'figures', 'who', 'come', 'scene', 'prove', 'be', 'actual', 'potential', 'molesters', 'man', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'can', 'see', 'window', 'luring', 'children', 'car', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'be', 'confronted', 'fact', 'love', 'daughter', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Finally', 'girl', 'whom', 'Bacon', 'park', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'too', 'accustomed', 'such', 'approaches', 'apparently', 'having', 'had', 'experience', 'subtle', 'progressions', 'familiarity', 'own', 'father.Is', 'movie', 'point', 'men', 'are', 'just', 'hair', 'breadth', 'away', 'molesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intention', 'only', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'well-acted', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'producers', 'Woodsman', 'took', 'brave', 'first', 'step', 'even', 'venturing', 'territory', 'Portraying', 'pedophile', 'anything', 'other', 'stereotypic', 'sicko', 'pervert', 'not', 'popular', 'move', 'However', 'Woodsman', 'missed', 'chance', 'say', 'something', 'really', 'important', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'children', 'mostly', 'reactions', 'such', 'person']",The Woodsman

After Kevin Bacon's performance in The Woodsman, if that theory held true Kevin Bacon would be a God. After being forgotten it seems for Mystic River, Kevin Bacon just might get that recoginition that everyone else in Mystic River got. The Woodsman is a gripping tale of a man, Walter, who has been released from prison after committing child molestation. He is reserved but you can tell theres a lot of inner turmoil and demons.This movie is based on Kevin Bacon's character through and through. The camera angles, the score, and the setting just all complament this man Walter. Bacon puts together a performance of a lifetime which says a lot for such an actor. He is very tensed and uncomfortable throughout the movie to show that not all emotions aren't on the outside, but tension from the inside. All of his performance is best showcased by one thing: His eyes. Every situation you can see his feelings, his addictions, his destruction just through his eyes. You can even see his most tranquil setting are those when he is with a little girl Robin. Kyra Sedgwick does a phenomenal job playing the one person, Vicki, that believes Walter is a decent human being. At first, you just see her as this sex addicted woman looking for a screw, but as you dig deeper you come to find her family history puts her this way. Her and Walter's relationship is built the needing of each other because beside themselves they are alone. Mos Def plays Sgt. Lucas who is a hard cop with that specific disgust towards pedafiles. His performance while brief still makes an impact. The same can be said with Benjamen Bratt's presence as Walter's brother in law.The script does exactly what it sets out to do which is to dig under one's skin. Each moment of Walter being near a girl you almost just wanna scream out ""NO!!!!! RUN WALTER RUN AWAY!!"". This script makes you squirm and twists in your seat which is the purpose anyways.In closing, I have to say I haven't been that uncomfortable in a movie since Se7en, but as much as I was intrigued I don't believe it was be nominated for Best Picture. I will say it would be a disgrace if Kevin Bacon goes unnoticed in nominations. Even Kyra Sedgwick and Mos Def could garner up nods for their roles.",4,"There are no more Woodsmen, Just Wolves",1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2302,"['been', 'said', 'power', 'world', 'eyes', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'Woodsman', 'theory', 'held', 'true', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'would', 'be', 'God', 'being', 'forgotten', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'just', 'might', 'get', 'recoginition', 'everyone', 'else', 'Mystic', 'River', 'got', 'Woodsman', 'gripping', 'tale', 'man', 'Walter', 'who', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'committing', 'child', 'molestation', 'reserved', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'demons.This', 'movie', 'based', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'camera', 'score', 'setting', 'just', 'complament', 'man', 'Walter', 'Bacon', 'together', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'lot', 'such', 'actor', 'very', 'tensed', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'show', 'not', 'emotions', 'are', ""n't"", 'outside', 'tension', 'inside', 'performance', 'best', 'showcased', 'one', 'thing', 'eyes', 'situation', 'can', 'see', 'feelings', 'addictions', 'destruction', 'just', 'eyes', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'most', 'tranquil', 'setting', 'are', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'Robin', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'playing', 'one', 'person', 'Vicki', 'Walter', 'decent', 'human', 'being', 'first', 'just', 'see', 'sex', 'addicted', 'woman', 'looking', 'screw', 'dig', 'deeper', 'come', 'find', 'family', 'history', 'way', 'Walter', 'relationship', 'built', 'needing', 'other', 'beside', 'are', 'alone', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Sgt', 'Lucas', 'who', 'hard', 'cop', 'specific', 'disgust', 'towards', 'pedafiles', 'performance', 'brief', 'still', 'impact', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Benjamen', 'Bratt', 'presence', 'Walter', 'brother', 'law.The', 'script', 'exactly', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'dig', 'one', 'skin', 'moment', 'Walter', 'being', 'girl', 'almost', 'just', 'wan', 'na', 'scream', 'out', 'NO', 'RUN', 'WALTER', 'RUN', 'AWAY', 'script', 'squirm', 'twists', 'seat', 'purpose', 'anyways.In', 'closing', 'have', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'Se7en', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'intrigued', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'will', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'disgrace', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'unnoticed', 'nominations', 'Even', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'Mos', 'Def', 'could', 'garner', 'up', 'nods', 'roles']",The Woodsman

I will say that Kevin Bacon's performance as a paroled pedophile trying to readjust to life on the outside ranks as one of his finest, and he was sorely overlooked for an Oscar nod.  Likewise, real-life wife Kyra Sedgewick brings far more shadings to what could have been a standard ""girlfriend"" role than the screenplay allows.  In fact, good performances all around and an assured directorial debut by Nicole Kassel.  I highly reccomend checking it out.  As a matter of fact, I urge people to see this movie, if only to know if I'm way off base with my interpretation.Is ""The Woodsman"" homophobic?  Speaking as a red-blooded, card-carrying heterosexual (though I suppose if a cute guy comes along I could reconsider) this shouldn't matter too much to me.  I'm just wondering out loud here.  In a film that deals with pedophilia, and one which presents two female characters admitting to being abused by male members of their family, how can homophobia even register?  While Bacon's character struggles to ""be normal,"" in his words, he notices a man who he calls ""Candy"" trying to lure young boys into his car.  It takes one to know one, right?  (SPOILER ALERT! Read no further if you'd prefer to find out for yourself)  Later on, when Candy is physically assaulted, even the Javert-like detective played by Mos Def seems to approve.  In other words:  man-on-girl pedophilia is bad, but man-on-boy pedophilia is really bad, take-the-law-into-your-own-hands bad.  We are supposed to feel some sympathy for the struggles of het pedophile Bacon, but a perv who picks on boys must get dealt with NOW!  Straight pedophiles are victims of their own desires who nobly battle with their inner demons and just want to live a normal life, but their gay counterparts--well, they ARE demons, unwilling or unable to control themselves.  While it's bold for a kinda-mainstream picture like this to suggest that someone like Kevin Bacon's Walter might be deserving of sympathy, this is undercut by what I perceive as an implicit double standard.As my four-star rating may attest, I really do like this movie, not as a social statement, but from a purely aesthetic viewpoint.  It's generally quiet, thoughtful tone is a welcome relief from the bombast that Hollywood usually pumps out (I like bombast as well, but like tira mi su, you can't have it every day).  I just wonder if the filmmakers, like Walter, also have some issues to work out as well.",4,"Disturbing, but for a different reason than you think...",1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,2587,"['are', 'plenty', 'more', 'reviews', 'page', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'describing', 'plot', 'could', 'so', ""'ll"", 'dispense', 'most', 'formalities', 'will', 'say', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'paroled', 'pedophile', 'trying', 'readjust', 'life', 'outside', 'ranks', 'one', 'finest', 'was', 'sorely', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Likewise', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'far', 'more', 'shadings', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'standard', 'girlfriend', 'role', 'screenplay', 'fact', 'good', 'performances', 'around', 'assured', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Nicole', 'Kassel', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'checking', 'out', 'matter', 'fact', 'urge', 'people', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'know', ""'m"", 'way', 'base', 'interpretation.Is', 'Woodsman', 'homophobic', 'Speaking', 'red-blooded', 'card-carrying', 'heterosexual', 'suppose', 'cute', 'guy', 'could', 'reconsider', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'too', 'much', ""'m"", 'just', 'wondering', 'out', 'loud', 'here', 'film', 'pedophilia', 'one', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'admitting', 'being', 'abused', 'male', 'members', 'family', 'how', 'can', 'homophobia', 'even', 'register', 'Bacon', 'character', 'be', 'normal', 'words', 'man', 'who', 'Candy', 'trying', 'lure', 'young', 'boys', 'car', 'one', 'know', 'one', 'right', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Read', 'further', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'find', 'out', 'Later', 'when', 'Candy', 'physically', 'assaulted', 'even', 'Javert-like', 'detective', 'played', 'Mos', 'Def', 'approve', 'other', 'words', 'man-on-girl', 'pedophilia', 'bad', 'man-on-boy', 'pedophilia', 'really', 'bad', 'take-the-law-into-your-own-hands', 'bad', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'struggles', 'het', 'pedophile', 'Bacon', 'perv', 'who', 'boys', 'must', 'get', 'dealt', 'NOW', 'Straight', 'pedophiles', 'are', 'victims', 'own', 'desires', 'who', 'nobly', 'battle', 'inner', 'demons', 'just', 'want', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'gay', 'counterparts', 'well', 'ARE', 'demons', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'control', 'bold', 'kinda-mainstream', 'picture', 'suggest', 'someone', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Walter', 'might', 'be', 'deserving', 'sympathy', 'undercut', 'what', 'perceive', 'implicit', 'double', 'standard.As', 'four-star', 'rating', 'may', 'attest', 'really', 'do', 'movie', 'not', 'social', 'statement', 'purely', 'aesthetic', 'viewpoint', 'generally', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'tone', 'welcome', 'relief', 'bombast', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'out', 'like', 'bombast', 'as', 'well', 'tira', 'mi', 'su', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'day', 'just', 'wonder', 'filmmakers', 'Walter', 'also', 'have', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well']",The Woodsman

He's been in tons of high quality motion pictures including such classics as Footloose, Apollo 13, Murder In The First, A Few Good Men, Sleepers, and Mystic River.His latest feature, The Woodsman, is a dark tale of a former child molester, Walter, who is released on parole and returns to his old hometown to assimilate back into ordinary life. Even though the main character's situation doesn't cause any sympathy, but disgust, from the viewers, his ambition to become normal again and the struggles he has to endure to realize that goal makes the viewer want him to succeed. Kyra Sedgwick, Bacon's real life wife, plays his co-worker who falls in love with him and, after knowing his past, supports him in regaining a clean social status. Walter also gets indirect help from a young girl who enjoys birdwatching by snapping out of his disease after realizing the disturbing and deep secrets that she has locked up inside.Whether the critics slam this picture in its entirety because of its subject matter or not, one thing remains true about this movie and that is it features Kevin Bacon in his most captivating performance to date.

886815,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B0007PID84,susannah,"[2, 4]","I also think that Kevin Bacon's acting was quite good in this film, but I don't think I agree with what may be a prevailing opinion in the reviews, in regard to Bacon's character. I am seeing many comments about he being a deeply flawed man but still a human being, not a monster, someone who desperately wants to rid himself of his desires, someone who doesn't ""really hurt"" little girls, someone who deserves forgiveness and compassion.I don't know if Walter was a monster. Just because he didn't act like Candy, in my opinion, didn't make him any less worthy of such a label. I think anyone who hurts children for their own selfish desires is pretty monstrous. I didn't get a sense either of true penitence from him in regard to his crimes. I got the impression that he hated the kind of life he had to lead post prison, but someone who is truly penitent doesn't follow young girls around the mall and certainly doesn't live across the street from an elementary school! How would he even be allowed to do that anyway, with being a sex offender? Also, he said to his girlfriend that he ""never hurt"" them. That statement alone showed that he took  no responsibility for his actions, or felt real remorse, since making a child an object of one's sexual gratification is hurting them, terribly, no matter what one does within that act. Then there was the girl in the park, following her, then making his move on her. I am still not sure about Robin's response to Walter's invitation. Such a request coming from a strange man in the park should have frightened her away quickly. Also it was too convenient that Walter's and the father's MO were similar. I didn't care that Walter finally got it, and don't think he deserves any medals.Why was Walter's brother in law pushing so hard for him to see his wife, Walter's sister?? Apparently she was severely traumatized, and it didn't seem to matter at all to the brother in law, or to Walter, who after seeing her, just walked away smiling, while she ran away, devastated all over again. I don't know what was with the brother in law. Walter had just gotten out of a 12 year prison term for molesting little girls, he had victimized his own sister when she was young and Walter had to be kept away from his own child, yet he is all buddy buddy and ""wishing he could invite Walter to her birthday party."" Yeah, that's the ticket, a houseful of little girls and Uncle Walter. No problem there. I also wondered what he was thinking to refer to the skimpy type clothes Carla and her friends wore..to a man who offended sexually to that age group! He just didn't get it.No, I didn't see a penitent praying for redemption. I saw a man pissed at how people treated him, because he ""wasn't bad"" like Candy, or so he thought, therefore not deserving such treatment, while putting himself in places to feed his fantasies, if not his realities.",2,A dissenting opinion,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,2878,"['also', 'think', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'agree', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'prevailing', 'opinion', 'reviews', 'regard', 'Bacon', 'character', 'am', 'seeing', 'many', 'comments', 'being', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'man', 'still', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'monster', 'someone', 'who', 'desperately', 'rid', 'desires', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'hurt', 'little', 'girls', 'someone', 'who', 'forgiveness', 'compassion.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Walter', 'was', 'monster', 'Just', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'Candy', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'less', 'worthy', 'such', 'label', 'think', 'anyone', 'who', 'children', 'own', 'selfish', 'desires', 'pretty', 'monstrous', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'true', 'penitence', 'regard', 'crimes', 'got', 'impression', 'hated', 'kind', 'life', 'had', 'lead', 'post', 'prison', 'someone', 'who', 'truly', 'penitent', ""n't"", 'follow', 'young', 'girls', 'mall', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'live', 'street', 'elementary', 'school', 'How', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'anyway', 'being', 'sex', 'offender', 'Also', 'said', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'hurt', 'statement', 'alone', 'showed', 'took', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'felt', 'real', 'remorse', 'making', 'child', 'object', 'one', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'hurting', 'terribly', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'act', 'Then', 'was', 'girl', 'park', 'following', 'then', 'making', 'move', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'Robin', 'response', 'Walter', 'invitation', 'request', 'coming', 'strange', 'man', 'park', 'should', 'have', 'frightened', 'away', 'quickly', 'Also', 'was', 'too', 'convenient', 'Walter', 'father', 'MO', 'were', 'similar', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Walter', 'finally', 'got', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'medals.Why', 'was', 'Walter', 'brother', 'law', 'pushing', 'so', 'hard', 'see', 'wife', 'Walter', 'sister', 'Apparently', 'was', 'severely', 'traumatized', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'brother', 'law', 'Walter', 'who', 'seeing', 'just', 'walked', 'away', 'smiling', 'ran', 'away', 'devastated', 'over', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'brother', 'law', 'Walter', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', '12', 'year', 'prison', 'term', 'molesting', 'little', 'girls', 'had', 'victimized', 'own', 'sister', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Walter', 'had', 'be', 'kept', 'away', 'own', 'child', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'wishing', 'could', 'invite', 'Walter', 'birthday', 'party', 'Yeah', 'ticket', 'houseful', 'little', 'girls', 'Uncle', 'Walter', 'problem', 'there', 'also', 'wondered', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'refer', 'skimpy', 'type', 'clothes', 'Carla', 'friends', 'wore..to', 'man', 'who', 'offended', 'sexually', 'age', 'group', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.No', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'penitent', 'praying', 'redemption', 'saw', 'man', 'pissed', 'how', 'people', 'treated', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Candy', 'so', 'thought', 'not', 'deserving', 'such', 'treatment', 'putting', 'places', 'feed', 'fantasies', 'not', 'realities']",The Woodsman

You not wanting to deal with it and to not feel something for this man cuz of this subject.. It's a touchy subject that is like Taboo that no one likes to talk about but it should be something to be talked about and to understand much better. Definitely not for a movie for a person that don't like to watch anything that is a touchy subject let alone see it in a different way.The Woodsman: A pedophile returns to his hometown after 12 years in prison and attempts to start a new life.I have seen Kevin Bacon as the big bad guard that molests little boys inSleepersthan gets shot by them. To seen him dancing and just having fun inFootloose (1984)and being inTremors> I thought he did an amazing freaking job! He played a role that I think most people wouldn't be able to pull off. I can't think of a person right now that could.Through the movie he talks about wanting to be normal and to not have those feelings. It seems like he obviously dislikes himself for doing what he did. He is scared to be around other people or getting people close because of knowing what he did and if they are younger girls that he would try to do something with them. and I think its not cuz he would be afraid to end up back in prison because he really doesn't want to hurt them. He seems to know that what he did was wrong but he did it.  I don't know I felt for this guy! I felt like he really wanted to get over this and not to be that person anymore. It gave you a perspective that maybe just maybe that not every person that does a wrongful act are really bad people, just people that have something...in their mind chemistry or whatever that you get the end result.I liked when they showed another pedophile, when his girl revealed she was abused by her brothers, when he finds out that the girl he was (idk what the word is) when her own dad was molesting her....The girl knew what Kevin Bacons character wanted just because of her dad and when she gave him a hug, idk to me it was like a sense of forgiving to who he was or something...I thought it was so great of Vicki to stick up for this guy who she really likes, I believe if there was no one there for him, he would have ended up back in prison. I wanted to punch Mary-Kay (Eve) for broadcasting it in the workplace, only because he wasn't into her. Really?!?! Jealous much?

I like Kevin Bacon a lot, and I'm very interested in the nature of pedophilia and its management (and sympathetic to pedophiles trying earnestly to manage their condition), but the storyline here is just lacking.  There is very little emotional movement of any of the characters, so the movie is very flat.  I was constantly waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did.  So maybe someone will argue that the movie is ""realistic"" and real life is pretty flat.  Well sure, except that the movie is *not* realistic.

886818,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B0007PID84,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[33, 40]","Well, that the film is about a pedophile has already been covered. (At least one reviewer called pedophila a ""disease."" Since I object to the over-use of that word, I didn't like that review much.)Bacon plays a guy who just got out of 12 years of prison after having ""molested girls,"" as he himself says to a young woman colleague who takes a liking to him.Bacon's acting is spectacular. You can see he's struggling with his condition, probably asking himself why he seems driven to it. He continues to ask--of himself and his therapist, ""When will I be normal?""As a favor, he gets a job in a lumber mill. A young black woman takes a liking to him. When he doesn't return the attraction, she goes on the web and finds that he's a convicted child molestor, then exposes him as such, excusing her personal vendetta in that, ""They [the other employees] need to know about him."" The script cleverly fit in that some other employees were the parents of young girls whom they adored; they, of course, were the ones particulary incensed when they found out the Bacon character was a pedophile.Later in the script, Bacon exposes his struggle to his brother in law, also the fawning father of a young daughter. The brother on law says that if Bacon even thinks of doing anything with his daughter, he'll kill him.The sister, by the way, wouldn't even communicate with Bacon any more. She has a distant appearance at the end of the film, a symbol, in essence, that his will be a long term recovery process, of his struggle with pedophilia AND his 12 years in prison.One of the scenes that moved me was when Bacon met a young girl in the park. She was a bird watcher. Bacon asked her if she'd like to sit on his lap--the watcher anticipates that regression, I did anyway. Then the young girl says no, and starts to cry. It seems her father has her ""do that"" at times. Ah. So maybe the Bacon character isn't as ""abnormal"" as he thinks! (I recalled in that scene a conversation I had with a good friend nearly 30 years ago. He ran an institution for kids and denied my stereotype at the time, that incest/pedophilia was something you'd find in the rural South among the uneducated. He'd found that it's more common than many would think among those of whom we don't hear because their warm, close, middle-class families would never talk about it, even if they know anything about it!)The woman colleague, with whom he's moving in at the end, was perhaps his saving grace. She cares for him, led him through some  hard parts of the story despite his having rejected her (assuming, it seems, that she'd already rejected him as so many others had.)Yes, it's a disturbing story, not just from the standpoint of a repulsive condition such as pedophilia, but from the way we treat prisoners.Bacon's acting was so outstanding, I'm astonished that he hasn't been nominated at Best Actor. (One reviewer said the academy found the film too distasteful for that. I'm inclined to want to pick up the play; if nothing else, I'd like to see how it transformed from a play into a fine film.Don't underestimate the quality of the film/story because of the academy's ignoring it.

Here again, he produces an incredibly difficult character--one that had to be emotionally draining, and, quite frankly, a risky career move.  Yet he did it--and I believed it.  Walter comes across as an ex-con, freshly out of the system, but still tied to it.  Even his clothing and ""industrial"" style sheets were right.  His body language, gestures, simple, yet deeply thought out speech patterns--perfect!The plot was superb as well.  Enough was left to conjecture, that I became deeply engrossed.  This story could have actually happened--anywhere!  The scene with Walter and the 11-year old in the park was so frightening in its plausibility, and so powerful in its delivery--all I can say is WOW--I'm still amazed.BTW, this film is hardly sympathetic towards pedaphilia and those who engage in it.  It's not a mere case study of a sex offender.  The Woodsman forces us to take a look at ourselves, our children, our society in ways that are sometimes frightening, but yet seeded with hope.A final comment--the DVD has an extended version of some scenes, included Walter with Robin in the park.  If you finish the movie, and absolutely need a more positive spin, view the extended version.  It is sweeter.  On the other hand, the producer's did well to leave it out of the theater version--much better to let the audience ruminate over that scene!Bottom-line:  This is a stellar production about a wrenching subject.

It's challenging, well acted and the sort of character-driven material that Hollywood doesn't often invest in. It's not perfect, though. I guess I'm giving it a pretty high rating, but I'm also not of the opinion that this is great world cinema. It seems that with these reviews on Amazon if an American film aspires to intellectual quality it gets a host of raves. I guess that's good in that I want HWood to do these type of films more. On the other hand, though, I feel like some of these folks should see a little more world cinema - then they might weigh this on more reasonable scales.The things that don't work so well for me are that Kevin Bacon's character is really never the sexual predator we're suppose to feel he is. We know he's done bad stuff, but in this film you're always on his side - or the film wants you to be. You're always sympathetic to him and never really believe he's going to do anything awful in this movie. In a way he's an ad for why we shouldn't descriminate against pedofiles. Yes, he does have a relationship with a girl and you know you're supposed to fear for what might happen, but I was never on the edge of my seat. In typical Hollywood form this movie simplifies the main character, even as it tries to convince you that it's complex, edgy, unusual. This is the type of movie that some studio executive was willing to finance because it had clear Oscar contender written all over it. I don't hate it because of that, but it did show in the filmaking.I do think Kyra Sedgwick was great in this. I don't really remember when I saw her last. Who knew she had this hard-edge, jaded beauty in her? It was quite a role for her to take on, one that acknowledges her aging.

886822,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B0007PID84,William Krischke,"[6, 9]","I know I'm not the first, or the best, to say this, but these days we don't take sin seriously.  Sometimes we laugh at it, and even think it makes a person more interesting.  Most of the time we excuse it away or call it a ""mistake,""  like burning the cookies.  Mostly we just forget about it - to the point that thinking about past sin has come to be considered unhealthy.There is a scene in the Woodsman where Kyra Sedgewick and Kevin Bacon are lying in bed.  She knows he has a ""deep dark secret"" (see? we can't even say that without a smirk) that he won't tell her, and she's dying to know what it is.  ""What's the worst thing you've ever done?""  he asks her.  And she tells him, and it's pretty bad and she still feels pretty bad about it, but she knows it won't change the way he thinks about her.  But then, it's his turn.And here's the thing:  he has committed the one sin that we, as a society, still take seriously.  He molested little girls.  He deeply regrets doing it, he has served twelve years in prison for it, and he's desperate to never do it again.  But when he tells her, he knows that it will change the way she thinks about him.  He gets up and holds the door open for her, and she leaves.  Because this is a sin that does not go away.What makes this a fascinating movie to watch, and one to remember, is that it is a portrait of a man grappling with his sin, both the sin he has committed, the sin he now knows he's capable of, the sin that disgusts him, and the sin he is still tempted to commit.  Perhaps if we really had the mind of Christ, we would see all of our sin the way this character (Walter) sees his.  ""When will I be normal?""  he asks his therapist.  ""What is normal?""  the therapist replies.  ""Normal is being able to look at a girl and not think...""  he never finished the sentence, and he doesn't have to.  Normal is to live without temptation.Roger Ebert wrote in his review,""It is not the pedophile that is evil, but the pedophilia. That is true of all sins and crimes and those tempted to perform them: It is not that we are capable of transgression that condemns us, but that we are willing. ""The Woodsman"" understands this at the very heart of its being, and that is why it succeeds as more than just the story of this character. It has relevance for members of the audience who would never in any way be even remotely capable of Walter's crime. We are quick to forgive our own trespasses, slower to forgive those of others. The challenge of a moral life is to do nothing that needs forgiveness.  In that sense, we're all out on parole.""Amen to that.",4,A movie about sin,1192924800,"10 21, 2007",2007,2595,"['know', ""'m"", 'not', 'first', 'best', 'say', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'sin', 'seriously', 'Sometimes', 'laugh', 'even', 'think', 'person', 'more', 'interesting', 'Most', 'time', 'excuse', 'away', 'call', 'mistake', 'burning', 'cookies', 'Mostly', 'just', 'forget', 'point', 'thinking', 'past', 'sin', 'come', 'be', 'considered', 'unhealthy.There', 'scene', 'Woodsman', 'where', 'Kyra', 'Sedgewick', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'are', 'lying', 'bed', 'deep', 'dark', 'secret', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'smirk', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'dying', 'know', 'what', 'What', 'worst', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'pretty', 'bad', 'still', 'pretty', 'bad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'way', 'then', 'turn.And', 'here', 'thing', 'committed', 'one', 'sin', 'society', 'still', 'take', 'seriously', 'molested', 'little', 'girls', 'deeply', 'doing', 'served', 'twelve', 'years', 'prison', 'desperate', 'never', 'do', 'again', 'when', 'will', 'change', 'way', 'up', 'door', 'open', 'sin', 'not', 'go', 'away.What', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'watch', 'one', 'remember', 'portrait', 'man', 'grappling', 'sin', 'sin', 'committed', 'sin', 'now', 'capable', 'sin', 'sin', 'still', 'tempted', 'commit', 'Perhaps', 'really', 'had', 'mind', 'Christ', 'would', 'see', 'sin', 'way', 'character', 'Walter', 'When', 'will', 'be', 'normal', 'therapist', 'What', 'normal', 'therapist', 'replies', 'Normal', 'being', 'able', 'look', 'girl', 'not', 'think', 'never', 'finished', 'sentence', ""n't"", 'have', 'Normal', 'live', 'temptation.Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'review', 'not', 'pedophile', 'evil', 'pedophilia', 'true', 'sins', 'crimes', 'tempted', 'perform', 'not', 'are', 'capable', 'transgression', 'are', 'willing', 'Woodsman', 'very', 'heart', 'being', 'why', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'character', 'relevance', 'members', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'way', 'be', 'even', 'remotely', 'capable', 'Walter', 'crime', 'are', 'quick', 'forgive', 'own', 'trespasses', 'slower', 'forgive', 'others', 'challenge', 'moral', 'life', 'do', 'nothing', 'forgiveness', 'sense', ""'re"", 'out', 'parole', 'Amen']",The Woodsman
886823,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0007PID84,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 1]","The Woodsman is not easy film to digest, because it deals with a taboo subject of pedophilia, and there's disturbing dialogues and scenes. It's anti-hero leading role is brilliantly played by Kevin Bacon, who obviously risked his image to transform himself into a child molestor, and ultimately delivered his most powerful performance! Honestly, this film is well written and the characters are meticulously portrayed, especially Bacon's, and in the end, I can understand and sympathize with his character.Kevin Bacon played Walter, who had been in prison for 12 years for having molested two girls between the age of 9 and 11, and he's released on parole for the first time. He gets a job at the local lumberyard, where he met co-worker Vicki(Kyra Sedgwick), and they eventually became lovers. She became supportive of him, despite learning about his criminal background, and intended to help him change for the better. Everyone at work condemned him when Mary-Kay(Eve) spread the works about Walter's dark past.Meanwhile, Walter's been seeing his brother-in-law Carlos(Benjamin Bratt), and tried to reconnect with his estranged sister who has not forgiven him. His parole officer(Mos Def) is quite hostile towards him, and suspects his behaviours. With all the stress he had to face, he started to lose control of himself, and his inner demon gradually propelled him to act out his desire for little girls again. He followed an 11 year old girl(Robin/Hannah Pilkes) to the park, and proceeded to socailize with her, but he declined to take an advantage of her. When he saw her for the second time in the park, their conversation profoundly touched him and discouraged him to make his move on her. From that moment on, he was finally letting go of the monster in him.Kyra Sedgwick gave a striking supporting performance. She was mesmerizing in the scene when Bacon confessed the truth about his past, and she was so shocked and confused. Hannah Pilkes did a great job playing the scene opposite Bacon, it was truly intense and moving.",4,Two Thumbs Up for Kevin Bacon's Powerful Performance!,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,2035,"['Woodsman', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'digest', 'taboo', 'subject', 'pedophilia', 'disturbing', 'dialogues', 'scenes', 'anti-hero', 'leading', 'role', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'who', 'obviously', 'risked', 'image', 'transform', 'child', 'molestor', 'ultimately', 'delivered', 'most', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Honestly', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'are', 'meticulously', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'Bacon', 'end', 'can', 'understand', 'sympathize', 'character.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'played', 'Walter', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'prison', '12', 'years', 'having', 'molested', 'two', 'girls', 'age', '9', '11', 'released', 'parole', 'first', 'time', 'job', 'local', 'lumberyard', 'where', 'met', 'co-worker', 'Vicki', 'Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'eventually', 'became', 'lovers', 'became', 'supportive', 'learning', 'criminal', 'background', 'intended', 'help', 'change', 'better', 'Everyone', 'work', 'condemned', 'when', 'Mary-Kay', 'Eve', 'spread', 'works', 'Walter', 'dark', 'past.Meanwhile', 'Walter', 'been', 'seeing', 'brother-in-law', 'Carlos', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'tried', 'reconnect', 'estranged', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'forgiven', 'parole', 'officer', 'Mos', 'Def', 'quite', 'hostile', 'towards', 'behaviours', 'stress', 'had', 'face', 'started', 'lose', 'control', 'inner', 'demon', 'gradually', 'propelled', 'act', 'out', 'desire', 'little', 'girls', 'again', 'followed', '11', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Robin/Hannah', 'Pilkes', 'park', 'proceeded', 'socailize', 'declined', 'take', 'advantage', 'When', 'saw', 'second', 'time', 'park', 'conversation', 'profoundly', 'touched', 'discouraged', 'make', 'move', 'moment', 'was', 'finally', 'letting', 'go', 'monster', 'him.Kyra', 'Sedgwick', 'gave', 'striking', 'supporting', 'performance', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'scene', 'when', 'Bacon', 'confessed', 'truth', 'past', 'was', 'so', 'shocked', 'confused', 'Hannah', 'Pilkes', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'scene', 'opposite', 'Bacon', 'was', 'truly', 'intense', 'moving']",The Woodsman
886824,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0007PID84,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Released in 2005, ""The Woodsman"" tells the story of Walter (Kevin Bacon) who's trying to make a life for himself in Philadelphia after spending 12 years in prison due to his abnormal predilection for 10-12 year-old girls. When news gets out of why he was in prison it causes problems with his girlfriend Vicki (Kyra Sedgwick) and at his new job. Walter desperately seeks healing from his condition even while he occasionally flirts with his sick desires. On top of this is Walter's parole officer who doesn't believe he can be trusted in conventional society. Meanwhile Walter spots a pedophile preying on children at the local elementary school. What should he do? And is there any hope for him to escape his condition?There are two things potential viewers should know up front: Walter is aware of his problem and desires freedom from it; in other words, he's repentant -- he wants to turn from his negative/destructive desires and channel his sexual energy positively and responsibly. Secondly, it becomes clear that Walter is not guilty of raping any girls but rather molesting them by getting his jollies with them on his lap (fully clothed). Yes, it's still bad, but not as bad as raping or killing. These are important points that help the viewer have compassion on Walter and root for his success in the story (because if he was unrepentant and guilty of actually raping or killing girls then please fry his butt and get it over with -- or, at least, lock him up and throw away the key).As noted in the title blurb, the film is a dramatic psychological study. It spotlights the classic struggle of flesh & spirit or id & ego. It's dialogue-driven and plot-driven rather than action-driven or cgi-driven. In other words, this is a thinking-person's film. Needless to say, uber-fans of conventional blockbusters should stay away.In a way, Walter's struggle is universal and most of us can relate to it on one level or another. For example. We may not have a predilection for tweenage girls but we might struggle with other negative tendencies, like alcoholism, drugs, adultery, fits of rage, porn addiction, gluttony, sloth, depression, lying, etc. The film subtly makes it clear that without love & belief there's little hope of spiritual metamorphosis.(MINOR SPOILER: The next two paragraphs explore one of the main insights of the story and comments on one important scene)One of the main points of the film is distinguishing a repentant pedophile from a non-repentant one. Walter has come to a place where he understands that his pedophile desires are of his flesh (i.e. id or destructive carnal nature) and should not be embraced, fed and acted upon (although, again, he flirts with the idea on a couple occasions). Walter KNOWS that to take advantage of young girls and have sexual relations with them is wrong, and is trying to walk free of such desires. This is contrasted by the predatory pedophile who hangs out by the school preying on kids. This guy obviously embraces, feeds and acts on his pedophile desires. There's a big difference between these two. The attitude of the heart makes all the difference. Walter deserves a second chance because he's repentant and trying to change for the positive, even while he should be monitered closely; the other guy, on the other hand, has totally given himself over to his perverted desires and deserves the snot beat out of him (at the very least).One critic argues that it's not realistic that a 45 year-old guy sits on a bench in the park and a cute 11 year-old girl sits herself next to him and asks, ""How's the view?"" But, wait a second, Walter had previously met the girl so she was already familiar with him; he didn't hurt her before, why would he hurt her now? Besides, the girl comes from a dysfunctional home where she suffers molestation from her dad; hence, it's not likely that she has the best understanding and discretion concerning social situations, not to mention her inner need and compulsion for masculine love and attention (since she's not getting it from her father). In addition, Walter was obviously drawn to and comfortable around little girls, which helped make the girl feel safe around him.(END SPOILER)Another criticism is that the film is melancholy and plays out in a flat manner. This is true but don't you think a bit o' melancholy fits the subject matter? As for the story being flat, the filmmakers (Nichole Kassell and Steven Fechter) were obviously shooting for realism. Isn't real life kind of flat? Personally I prefer realism over the goofiness, overkill action/cgi and generally unbelievable tone of many modern pictures.The film was shot on location in Philadelphia and runs a short-but-sweet 87 minutes.Interesting tidbit: Kevin Bacon and co-star Kyra Sedgwick have been married since 1988 and have 2 children.FINAL ANALYSIS: As long as you can handle the subject matter and a couple of cringe-inducing spots, ""The Woodsman"" is outstanding if you're in the mood for a serious drama or psychological study.P.S. Be sure to catch the delelted scene of Walter and Robin's discussion at the bench. The fuller version should never have been deleted; you'll see why when you compare the sequences.",5,Great psychological study,1253145600,"09 17, 2009",2009,5196,"['Released', '2005', 'Woodsman',
