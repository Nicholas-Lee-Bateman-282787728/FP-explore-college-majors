1182413,A2F1FP9DWAWMNB,B001DOM8VQ,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I did this video maybe five times. The things I liked were the plank work for core. The set is really nice and relaxing. However even though in another part of the video menu, she goes over the yoga sequence she will be following, Sara just rushes through these sequences leaving no time to stretch the muscles. The benefit of yoga is to lengthen the muscles by holding some poses. She does these salutations really quickly. I did this with nonpregnant friends and they weren't feeling it. She just rushes too quickly through it. One particular section she does this weird downward dog to back bend thing and where you lift a leg and arm. It just doesn't feel very stable or safe and she doesn't give you time to do the exercise safely. The video overall isn't bad but I found myself tending to do other videos.",2,Stick w/ vol 1.

1182414,A5BK61FUB2D24,B001DOM8VQ,CBInteresting,"[1, 4]",Have been doing intensive yoga now for several years. Was looking for a more moderate version during my pregnancy. This yoga flow is nearly 2 hours long - way too long for me when I am tired! And very repetetive. I now just go to the last 20 minutes and complete some of the stretches good for pregnancy.,2,WAY too long!!!,1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,304,"['Have', 'been', 'doing', 'intensive', 'yoga', 'now', 'several', 'years', 'Was', 'looking', 'more', 'moderate', 'version', 'pregnancy', 'yoga', 'flow', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'am', 'tired', 'very', 'repetetive', 'now', 'just', 'go', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'complete', 'stretches', 'good', 'pregnancy']",The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2: Prenatal Yoga
1182415,A1M6LNYKTY44D1,B001DOM8VQ,"Jessy Ko ""Mommy Shopper""","[13, 13]","No worries there are no handstands or acrobatics in this video! Just a workout centered on stretching and Yogic moves. I did workout before pregnancy. This is my second pregnancy, during my first I did water aerobics and walked. This is not an option with a toddler at home in the winter. I have other prenatal yoga dvds and workout videos. Most of the Yoga dvds for pregnancy are to melodic and I feel like falling asleep half way through by the fourth time I do it. I read a lot of negative reviews about this video and almost didn't buy it. But I noticed that even in the critical reviews they said they would keep on doing the workout. This is the most controversial DVD I have ever bought, and I am glad I did get it. If you are doing your workouts using instructional videos you know that no matter how hard or fast it is by the 5th time you do it you will have it practically memorized, so I find her quickness in routine a plus. Once I have done this workout a few times I won't be board or fast forwarding through long pauses or explanations. Also there is an instructional section that goes over most of the sections people complained about in slow motion. I am not athletic, flexible, or even in shape, just healthy and I was able to do the advanced moves 80% of the time. Also I have done or seen  a version of  2 out of 3 of the exercises on this video. The new exercises where great and I am glad I did them. This is different from traditional Yoga videos so it is a good by to mix it up a little. The only exercise I will not do is the back bend but I just do the set up for it. The only people who might not want to try this video are those with some kind of chronic health problem, the obese, anyone with a truly at risk pregnancy, the lazy and unmotivated or those who are easily frustrated. However I am only giving this video 4 stars becauseThe Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1by her sister is a better workout video in my opinion and it sets the bar really high. However some one who is more in to flexibility and movement oriented workouts would like this one better.",4,No worries!,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2089,"['worries', 'are', 'handstands', 'acrobatics', 'video', 'Just', 'workout', 'centered', 'stretching', 'Yogic', 'did', 'workout', 'pregnancy', 'second', 'pregnancy', 'first', 'did', 'water', 'aerobics', 'walked', 'not', 'option', 'toddler', 'home', 'winter', 'have', 'other', 'prenatal', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'workout', 'videos', 'Most', 'Yoga', 'dvds', 'pregnancy', 'are', 'melodic', 'feel', 'falling', 'asleep', 'half', 'way', 'fourth', 'time', 'do', 'read', 'lot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'video', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'noticed', 'even', 'critical', 'reviews', 'said', 'would', 'keep', 'doing', 'workout', 'most', 'controversial', 'DVD', 'have', 'ever', 'bought', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'get', 'are', 'doing', 'workouts', 'using', 'instructional', 'videos', 'know', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'fast', '5th', 'time', 'do', 'will', 'have', 'practically', 'memorized', 'find', 'quickness', 'routine', 'plus', 'Once', 'have', 'done', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'board', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'long', 'pauses', 'explanations', 'Also', 'instructional', 'section', 'most', 'sections', 'people', 'complained', 'slow', 'motion', 'am', 'not', 'athletic', 'flexible', 'even', 'shape', 'just', 'healthy', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'advanced', 'moves', '80', '%', 'time', 'Also', 'have', 'done', 'seen', 'version', '2', '3', 'exercises', 'video', 'new', 'exercises', 'where', 'great', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'different', 'traditional', 'Yoga', 'videos', 'good', 'mix', 'up', 'little', 'only', 'exercise', 'will', 'not', 'do', 'back', 'bend', 'just', 'do', 'set', 'up', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'try', 'video', 'are', 'kind', 'chronic', 'health', 'problem', 'obese', 'anyone', 'truly', 'risk', 'pregnancy', 'lazy', 'unmotivated', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'frustrated', 'However', 'am', 'only', 'giving', 'video', '4', 'stars', 'becauseThe', 'Perfect', 'Pregnancy', 'Workout', 'vol', '1by', 'sister', 'better', 'workout', 'video', 'opinion', 'bar', 'really', 'high', 'However', 'one', 'who', 'more', 'flexibility', 'movement', 'oriented', 'workouts', 'would', 'like', 'one', 'better']",The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 2: Prenatal Yoga

I suppose what I should have done is just watch it the first time around without trying to do the exercises with her at the same time which was impossible.  Half of the time, there weren't instructions being vocalized, you should just somehow be able to watch her while simultaneously being in downward facing dog...? I should leave the disclaimer though that I am not advanced in yoga, so perhaps someone who is wouldn't have had trouble like I did.

It's not very challenging and I feel like the moves are unnecessarily modified at times. I don't ever feel ""loose"" after this workout, which is my favorite benefit of yoga. Certain sequences are tougher than others, but the bottom line is that I just don't enjoy this DVD.

1182419,A3JDKC71F71PQ7,B001DOM8VQ,Sonic_Raptor,"[2, 2]","I'm currently 18 weeks and I've been looking for a good yoga DVD to do while pregnant.  While I don't consider myself advanced at yoga, I did it at home or at the gym at least once a week before the pregnancy.  Overall I thought the DVD was ok and the only reason I'll continue to do it is because I haven't found one (yet!) that's better.Pros:o The length of the DVD is pretty good -- not too long and not too short.o The instruction was easy to follow without needing to look at the screen.Cons:o The pace of the DVD is a little too fast for my yoga taste.o The ""advanced"" moves are shown in a little tiny box in the corner while the instructor does the beginner moves on the main screen.  This would have been fine with me if I agreed with the definition of beginner and advanced, but my version of ""beginner"" yoga isn't doing a sun salutation while sitting in a chair.
