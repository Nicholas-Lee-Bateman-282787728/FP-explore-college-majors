451235,A32T2H8150OJLU,630513720X,ARH,"[1, 1]","Contains spoilersJames Garner, Shirley Jones, and C. Thomas Howell headline this tale of a fight against corruption and the quest for justice.  Sure, that sounds a little sappy, but that's that way it is.Garner plays an Army division sargeant-major who has just been posted to his last assignment at a base in rural Georgia.  When he goes to town one night for a beer he steps and roughs up a deputy sheriff who is slapping around a young woman that was forced into prostitution by the corrupt, local sheriff.  This raises the ire of the sheriff, and when he can't lay his hands on the sargeant-major he does the next best thing...he frames the sargeant's teenaged son and imprisons him.  But, the sheriff didn't count on the fact that the sargeant owns his own fully restored and operational WWII-ear Sherman tank.Since it is clear that the entire legal system of the town and county is corrupt from top to bottom and there is no recourse for justice or true application of law, the sargeant has to take matters in his own hands, rescue his son from a county work farm, and make his way to the neighboring state of Tennessee where they are running to justice and a chance at a fair trial.Garner plays an all-American good-guy role, and Shirley Jones is his tough, supportive wife.  Howell is their teenaged son, the younger of two, but the older son was killed, presumably on active service in the Army.  BTW - you will love the scene where Shirley Jones confronts the governor of the state of Tenn.All in all this is a fun show with strong messages about the importance of honesty, integrity, family commitment, and love.  Even so, there is too much gratuitous foul language (as you might find on any Army base) laced throughout the film for my taste. That's the only reason why I didn't award this film 5 stars.",4,"""There is a Lone Ranger, and...he wears Army green.""",1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1814,"['Contains', 'spoilersJames', 'Garner', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'headline', 'tale', 'fight', 'corruption', 'quest', 'justice', 'Sure', 'little', 'sappy', 'way', 'Army', 'division', 'sargeant-major', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'posted', 'last', 'assignment', 'base', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'When', 'town', 'one', 'night', 'beer', 'up', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'who', 'slapping', 'young', 'woman', 'was', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'corrupt', 'local', 'sheriff', 'ire', 'sheriff', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lay', 'hands', 'sargeant-major', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'sargeant', 'teenaged', 'son', 'imprisons', 'sheriff', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'fact', 'sargeant', 'own', 'fully', 'restored', 'operational', 'WWII-ear', 'Sherman', 'tank.Since', 'clear', 'entire', 'legal', 'system', 'town', 'county', 'corrupt', 'top', 'bottom', 'recourse', 'justice', 'true', 'application', 'law', 'sargeant', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'rescue', 'son', 'county', 'work', 'farm', 'make', 'way', 'neighboring', 'state', 'Tennessee', 'where', 'are', 'running', 'justice', 'chance', 'fair', 'trial.Garner', 'all-American', 'good-guy', 'role', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'tough', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Howell', 'teenaged', 'son', 'younger', 'two', 'older', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'presumably', 'active', 'service', 'Army', 'BTW', 'will', 'love', 'scene', 'where', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'governor', 'state', 'Tenn.All', 'fun', 'show', 'strong', 'messages', 'importance', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'family', 'commitment', 'love', 'Even', 'so', 'too', 'much', 'gratuitous', 'foul', 'language', 'might', 'find', 'Army', 'base', 'laced', 'film', 'taste', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'award', 'film', '5', 'stars']",Tank

Zack Carey (James Garner) is a 52-year-old veteran who's been in the Army almost 30 years and often seems as tough as nails, but he has a strong feel for justice and a deep attachment to his family--wife LaDonna (Shirley Jones) and 16-year-old son Billy (C. Thomas Howell), whose older brother Jonathan followed his dad into the service and was killed a couple of years earlier at 20. The Careys arrive at Fort Clemons, GA, for what they hope will be their last posting, bringing with them Zack's pride and joy, a fully operational WWII Sherman tank he spent 15 years restoring. Though his CO (Sandy Ward) tries to persuade him to stay in with the suggestion that he could well find himself ""the next Sergeant-Major of the Army,"" Zack isn't biting: he has an offer in for a fishing boat and wants to settle down while he still has a few years to really relate to his one remaining son. Then, without really planning it, he runs afoul of tyrannical and corrupt Sheriff Cyrus Buelton (played with slimy elan by G. D. Spradlin) and his chief deputy, bullying Euclid Baker (James Cromwell), when he tries to stand up for a young prostitute named Sarah (Jennilee Harrison). Buelton in response frames Billy for drug trafficking, forces Zack to sell the newly-purchased boat and turn over the proceeds to him, and ships Billy off to the local prison farm anyway. Now Zack gets mad--and a man with a working tank is not someone you want mad at you, as Buelton and Euclid very quickly find out.At first the movie is a bit slow getting started, as we watch Zack settling into his duties and learn by his actions what kind of man he is. But when he and his tank pay a visit to the sheriff's office, things start heating up. Sarah, knowing she can't stay in Clemonsville, hitches a ride, Billy is broken out of the camp, and the trio heads for the Tennessee state line while LaDonna goes to see the Governor of Tennessee. This is a story of how might may make right for a while, but finds its comeuppance in the end, of how ordinary folks (like Danny Nelson as Mr. Gant, who supplies the fugitives with gasoline, home-cooked food, and advice on a route, though he knows full well Buelton will seek revenge) reach their limit, and of how a father and a son come to understand each other. As the tank comes heartbreakingly close to its goal only to be stopped within sight of it--and a gang of motorcyclists creatively shows the way to rescue--you may feel like cheering.",4,Don't yank the tail of a tank,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,2467,"['Sgt-Maj.', 'Zack', 'Carey', 'James', 'Garner', '52-year-old', 'veteran', 'who', 'been', 'Army', 'almost', '30', 'years', 'often', 'as', 'tough', 'nails', 'strong', 'feel', 'justice', 'deep', 'attachment', 'family', 'wife', 'LaDonna', 'Shirley', 'Jones', '16-year-old', 'son', 'Billy', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'older', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'followed', 'dad', 'service', 'was', 'killed', 'couple', 'years', 'earlier', '20', 'Careys', 'arrive', 'Fort', 'Clemons', 'GA', 'what', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'posting', 'bringing', 'Zack', 'pride', 'joy', 'fully', 'operational', 'WWII', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'spent', '15', 'years', 'restoring', 'CO', 'Sandy', 'Ward', 'persuade', 'stay', 'suggestion', 'could', 'well', 'find', 'next', 'Sergeant-Major', 'Army', 'Zack', ""n't"", 'biting', 'offer', 'fishing', 'boat', 'settle', 'down', 'still', 'few', 'years', 'really', 'relate', 'one', 'remaining', 'son', 'Then', 'really', 'planning', 'afoul', 'tyrannical', 'corrupt', 'Sheriff', 'Cyrus', 'Buelton', 'played', 'slimy', 'elan', 'G.', 'D.', 'Spradlin', 'chief', 'deputy', 'bullying', 'Euclid', 'Baker', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'when', 'stand', 'up', 'young', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Jennilee', 'Harrison', 'Buelton', 'response', 'frames', 'Billy', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'forces', 'Zack', 'sell', 'newly-purchased', 'boat', 'turn', 'proceeds', 'ships', 'Billy', 'local', 'prison', 'farm', 'anyway', 'Now', 'Zack', 'mad', 'man', 'working', 'tank', 'not', 'someone', 'want', 'mad', 'Buelton', 'Euclid', 'very', 'quickly', 'find', 'out.At', 'first', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'getting', 'started', 'watch', 'Zack', 'settling', 'duties', 'learn', 'actions', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'when', 'tank', 'pay', 'visit', 'sheriff', 'office', 'things', 'start', 'heating', 'up', 'Sarah', 'knowing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'Clemonsville', 'ride', 'Billy', 'broken', 'camp', 'trio', 'heads', 'Tennessee', 'state', 'line', 'LaDonna', 'see', 'Governor', 'Tennessee', 'story', 'how', 'might', 'may', 'make', 'right', 'while', 'comeuppance', 'end', 'how', 'ordinary', 'folks', 'Danny', 'Nelson', 'Mr.', 'Gant', 'who', 'fugitives', 'gasoline', 'home-cooked', 'food', 'advice', 'route', 'full', 'well', 'Buelton', 'will', 'seek', 'revenge', 'reach', 'limit', 'how', 'father', 'son', 'come', 'understand', 'other', 'tank', 'heartbreakingly', 'close', 'goal', 'only', 'be', 'stopped', 'sight', 'gang', 'motorcyclists', 'creatively', 'way', 'rescue', 'may', 'feel', 'cheering']",Tank

To me this movie was alright when I first saw it when I was 17 years old, but now as an adult I feel that the movie would make me puke. I find it rather nauseating. I feel that the sherrif in this movie is a demon, and I run from demons. He's all dressed up in white, and he tries to act super holy in public that I've given him the name ""Lilliwhite"". However, don't let that fool you; he's pure evil as he tries to bully not only his deputy, but a young prostitute as well, and in turn the deputy bullies the prostitute. Lilliwhite feels he can do no wrong, and unfortunately I feel that this could be the wrong image of the southern man. If I'm right then I can gripe all I want, but if I'm wrong then by all means let's do it as it's mentioned in Isaiah 1:18: ""Come and let us reason together."" Because this is the way southern men have been portrayed to me where the father tries to act like he's God, and he bullies his sons to break, and rape thier souls, and if he(The Father) does anything wrong it's pencilled away with a ""Do as I say...not as I do"", or a ""Let that be a lesson to you""; instead of portraying himself as a humble man he justifies his actions his motives. I feel that's no way for a father to act whether he's from the north, south, east, or west. This isn't right, and unfortuantely, the deputy only did what he learned from Lilliwhite the father figure. Anyway this is not all bad a movie because if it were it would've gotten a minus 2 star rating from me. There are some tender moments with James Garner's character, and his son as his father tries to spring him from a prison work camp where he was sentenced on a trumped up charge for marijuana possession. You see there's a difference here between 2 fathers. Garner's character owned up to not only meeting with the young prostitute, but also for decking the deputy for slapping her around in the first place, and then you have Lilliwhite who after he lost the major tug of war on a mudpile, and was arrested for corruption all he could do was slam his deputy's face into the mud. As I said this is the personification of the southern man, and how he raises his sons that he breaks thier spirit and rapes thier souls through mental, emotional, and many a time physical abuse, and that father can do no wrong for he is the only figure of God that the kids have, and so the sons grow up, and do the same thing that thier fathers did to them, and to me as I said that's not right, so that's why I gave the movie such a low rate. It's just too much to see without getting ticked off. As I said if there are any Southern men out there who want to rebuke this ""Come and let us reason together.""",1,I've taken sides with Neil Young,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,2753,"['Lynyrd', 'Skynyrd', 'was', 'write', 'response', 'song', 'review', 'encourage', 'movie', 'was', 'alright', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', '17', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'adult', 'feel', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'puke', 'find', 'rather', 'nauseating', 'feel', 'sherrif', 'movie', 'demon', 'run', 'demons', 'dressed', 'up', 'white', 'act', 'super', 'holy', 'public', ""'ve"", 'given', 'name', 'Lilliwhite', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fool', 'pure', 'evil', 'bully', 'not', 'only', 'deputy', 'young', 'prostitute', 'as', 'well', 'turn', 'deputy', 'prostitute', 'Lilliwhite', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'unfortunately', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'image', 'southern', 'man', ""'m"", 'right', 'then', 'can', 'gripe', 'want', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'then', 'means', 'let', 'do', 'mentioned', 'Isaiah', '1:18', 'Come', 'let', 'reason', 'together', 'way', 'southern', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'portrayed', 'where', 'father', 'act', 'God', 'sons', 'break', 'rape', 'thier', 'souls', 'Father', 'anything', 'wrong', 'pencilled', 'away', 'Do', 'say', 'not', 'do', 'Let', 'be', 'lesson', 'instead', 'portraying', 'humble', 'man', 'actions', 'motives', 'feel', 'way', 'father', 'act', 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west', ""n't"", 'right', 'unfortuantely', 'deputy', 'only', 'did', 'what', 'learned', 'Lilliwhite', 'father', 'figure', 'Anyway', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'were', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'minus', '2', 'star', 'rating', 'are', 'tender', 'moments', 'James', 'Garner', 'character', 'son', 'father', 'tries', 'spring', 'prison', 'work', 'camp', 'where', 'was', 'sentenced', 'trumped', 'up', 'charge', 'marijuana', 'possession', 'see', 'difference', 'here', '2', 'fathers', 'Garner', 'character', 'owned', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'meeting', 'young', 'prostitute', 'also', 'decking', 'deputy', 'slapping', 'around', 'first', 'place', 'then', 'have', 'Lilliwhite', 'who', 'lost', 'major', 'tug', 'war', 'mudpile', 'was', 'arrested', 'corruption', 'could', 'do', 'was', 'slam', 'deputy', 'face', 'mud', 'said', 'personification', 'southern', 'man', 'how', 'sons', 'thier', 'spirit', 'rapes', 'thier', 'souls', 'mental', 'emotional', 'many', 'time', 'physical', 'abuse', 'father', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'only', 'figure', 'God', 'kids', 'have', 'so', 'sons', 'grow', 'up', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'thier', 'fathers', 'did', 'said', 'not', 'right', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', 'low', 'rate', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'see', 'getting', 'ticked', 'off', 'said', 'are', 'Southern', 'men', 'who', 'want', 'rebuke', 'Come', 'let', 'reason', 'together']",Tank

As drama, it is fairly hokey. That doesn't matter, though. It is fun.The story is of a Sergeant Major who accepts his last post outside a small southern town. This SGM, however has his own Sherman tank that he and his son restored. The problem is that the town and the entire county is run by a corrupt sherrif who is into liquor, prostitution and bribery. The SGM makes the mistake of hacking of this sherrif so the sherrif arrests the son on a bogus drug charge and sends him to a hellhole of a prison camp. It seems that nothing the SGM can do will help his son so he takes matters into his own hands, fires up the tank and rides to the rescue. From there, is is a chase to the state line.Most of the elements of this movie are extremely predictable. Stereotypes abound. You almost know what is going to happen before it happens. That does not detract too much from the fun of seeing it happen, though. Some of the antics are so patently absurd as to be unworkable but they work in this movie, whether or not they would ever work in the real world. Its just silly fun.James Garner is extremely likable as the sarge. This is by no means his greatest work but it looks like it was fun to make. Shirley Jones plays his wife and C.

I'd have to call it a cross between Red Dawn and Over The Top. Some funny parts, stuff gets blown up, run over, and a family grows closer together. The language isn't appropriate for young kids.

451270,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,630513720X,Tim Janson,"[5, 7]","Tank is not to be taken real seriously.  It's a ridiculously plotted movie that has every cliche available (evil sheriff, dumb deputy, down on her luck prostitute, etc...) but the actors are good enough to lend it some entertainment value.James GArner plays Sergeant Major Zack Carey, a career military man.  When he sees a deputy Baker (james Cromwell) slapping around a prostitute (Jennilee Harrison) he steps in and saves her but now he's run afoul of the evil town Sheriff played by G.D. Spradlin.  The Sheriff puts Zack's son (C. Thomas Howell) in Jail on a false drug charge.  With nowhere to turn, Zack steals a tank, rescues his son and goes about demolishing the sheriffs town.Zack will only surrender to the Sheriff in the next town and when the tank is bogged down in mud, the townfolk, who look at Zack as a folk hero, actually pull the tank though the mud and across the country or city line...Yeah..it's all pretty 1980's cheese but the actors are so enjoyable in it, even if they are two-dimensional.  It's good little escapist fun.  Garner plays a much different role than the usual more suave characters were used to seeing and Spradlin always handles the role of the villian very well.",3,SHLOCKEY HOKUM FUN,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,1203,"['Tank', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'real', 'seriously', 'ridiculously', 'plotted', 'movie', 'cliche', 'available', 'evil', 'sheriff', 'dumb', 'deputy', 'down', 'luck', 'prostitute', 'etc', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'lend', 'entertainment', 'value.James', 'GArner', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'Zack', 'Carey', 'career', 'military', 'man', 'When', 'deputy', 'Baker', 'james', 'Cromwell', 'slapping', 'prostitute', 'Jennilee', 'Harrison', 'now', 'run', 'afoul', 'evil', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'played', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'Sheriff', 'Zack', 'son', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'Jail', 'false', 'drug', 'charge', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'Zack', 'tank', 'son', 'demolishing', 'sheriffs', 'town.Zack', 'will', 'only', 'surrender', 'Sheriff', 'next', 'town', 'when', 'tank', 'bogged', 'down', 'mud', 'townfolk', 'who', 'look', 'Zack', 'folk', 'hero', 'actually', 'tank', 'mud', 'country', 'city', 'line', 'Yeah..it', 'pretty', '1980', 'cheese', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'are', 'two-dimensional', 'good', 'little', 'escapist', 'fun', 'Garner', 'much', 'different', 'role', 'usual', 'more', 'suave', 'characters', 'were', 'used', 'seeing', 'Spradlin', 'always', 'role', 'villian', 'very', 'well']",Tank
451271,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,630513720X,trebe,"[3, 3]","Tank (1984) is a mildly entertaining drama/comedy with some big name stars, and outdated attitudes.  Jam packed with stereotypes, it's kind of a mix of Cool Hand Luke, Walking Tall, Hooper, and The Dukes of Hazzard, as James Garner plays a military man who goes to extreme measures, to protect his son from a corrupt sheriff.The always likeable Garner, in a rare post Rockford Files big screen appearance, plays Sergeant Major Zack Carey, who has just moved to a military base in Georgia with his wife LaDonna (Shirley Jones), teenage son Billy (C. Thomas Howell), and his own private Sherman tank.  Zack is at a bar in the company of a prostitute named Sarah (Jennilee Harrison), when Deputy Baker (James Cromwell) stops by to tell her to get back to work.  After Baker slaps Sarah around, Zack returns the favor, and leaves the Deputy unconscious on the floor.  Enraged that someone has broken the law in his town, Sheriff Cyrus Buelton (G.D. Spradlin) has drugs planted in Billy's school locker, and then has him arrested for dealing.  With his son facing three years labor in a work camp, Carey takes his privately owned Sherman tank off the base, and goes looking for justice.After destroying the local jail and acquiring Sarah as a co-pilot, Carey rescues Billy from the work camp, and heads off into the woods.  With LaDonna handling the public relations angle, the outlaws become folk heroes to some, as Carey attempts to find safety across the state line in Tennessee.Corruption in a backward town run by an autocratic lawman, was already a very familiar movie theme in 1984, and it's embellished a bit here, as besides running prostitution, the Sheriff is also a racist, who whips Sarah's tender behind with his belt, and rather magnanimously is prepared to set Billy free for only ten grand in cash.  About all that's left unaccounted for is the smuggling of moonshine whiskey.Despite the serious situation, Tank has a soft underbelly, and the film's comedic elements really emerge when the tank gets rolling, and the tone becomes more like a goofy Disney adventure, crossed with an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard.  The fugitives gain the support of some of the citizenry, who provide them with fuel and food, and even try to help, when the tank gets stuck in the mud just short of the state line.  The Sherman is like another character, and watching the armored vehicle crush, destroy, and blow up stuff, is one of the film's main points, as is the syrupy sweet father/son relationship that blooms between Zack and Billy.Writer Dan Gordon evidently believed that the American public would be receptive to the non-PC attitudes and various prejudices reflected in the film.  These views might have been prevalent in the 60's, but one would hope we were a bit more enlightened by 1984.  The unsophisticated plot casts Shirley Jones (The Partridge Family), Jennilee Harrison (Three's Company), James Cromwell, and G.D. Spradlin in really cartoonish roles.  Jones, an Oscar winning actress (Elmer Gantry), could play Zack's' ""good old broad"" of a wife in her sleep, but the role just seems so beneath her.  Cromwell's gig includes being handcuffed buck naked to a pole.  The ever affable Garner seems to be enjoying himself and carries on like a pro, but by the end, much like his tank, even he is limping to the finish line.Character development is minimal, and the dialog which is deliberately aimed low is often cringeworthy.  The portrayal of people from the south, and the sheriff in particular, helps to perpetuate an overused stereotype.  The film's finale, a confrontation in a muddy field, is just a mess.Tank is not an extremely offensive film, but its insensitivity in places is certainly a deliberate choice, and results in some embarrassing moments that are in questionable taste.  The talented cast is clearly capable of better.  While there are funny moments, some of what happens may leave you a little incredulous at the poor judgment that is shown.",3,I do believe I've got you covered...James Garner in command of a sherman tank,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,3974,"['Tank', '1984', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'drama/comedy', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'outdated', 'attitudes', 'Jam', 'packed', 'stereotypes', 'kind', 'mix', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'Hooper', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'James', 'Garner', 'military', 'man', 'who', 'extreme', 'measures', 'protect', 'son', 'corrupt', 'sheriff.The', 'always', 'likeable', 'Garner', 'rare', 'post', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'big', 'screen', 'appearance', 'Sergeant', 'Major', 'Zack', 'Carey', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'military', 'base', 'Georgia', 'wife', 'LaDonna', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'teenage', 'son', 'Billy', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'own', 'private', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'Zack', 'bar', 'company', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Sarah', 'Jennilee', 'Harrison', 'when', 'Deputy', 'Baker', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'tell', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'Baker', 'slaps', 'Sarah', 'Zack', 'favor', 'Deputy', 'unconscious', 'floor', 'Enraged', 'someone', 'broken', 'law', 'town', 'Sheriff', 'Cyrus', 'Buelton', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'drugs', 'planted', 'Billy', 'school', 'locker', 'then', 'arrested', 'dealing', 'son', 'facing', 'three', 'years', 'labor', 'work', 'camp', 'Carey', 'privately', 'owned', 'Sherman', 'tank', 'off', 'base', 'looking', 'justice.After', 'destroying', 'local', 'jail', 'acquiring', 'Sarah', 'co-pilot', 'Carey', 'Billy', 'work', 'camp', 'heads', 'off', 'woods', 'LaDonna', 'handling', 'public', 'relations', 'angle', 'outlaws', 'become', 'folk', 'heroes', 'Carey', 'attempts', 'find', 'safety', 'state', 'line', 'Tennessee.Corruption', 'backward', 'town', 'run', 'autocratic', 'lawman', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'familiar', 'movie', 'theme', '1984', 'embellished', 'bit', 'here', 'running', 'prostitution', 'Sheriff', 'also', 'racist', 'who', 'Sarah', 'tender', 'belt', 'rather', 'magnanimously', 'prepared', 'set', 'Billy', 'free', 'only', 'ten', 'grand', 'cash', 'left', 'unaccounted', 'smuggling', 'moonshine', 'serious', 'situation', 'Tank', 'soft', 'underbelly', 'film', 'comedic', 'elements', 'really', 'emerge', 'when', 'tank', 'rolling', 'tone', 'more', 'goofy', 'Disney', 'adventure', 'crossed', 'episode', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'fugitives', 'gain', 'support', 'citizenry', 'who', 'provide', 'fuel', 'food', 'even', 'try', 'help', 'when', 'tank', 'stuck', 'mud', 'just', 'short', 'state', 'line', 'Sherman', 'character', 'watching', 'armored', 'vehicle', 'crush', 'destroy', 'blow', 'up', 'stuff', 'one', 'film', 'main', 'points', 'syrupy', 'sweet', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'Zack', 'Billy.Writer', 'Dan', 'Gordon', 'evidently', 'believed', 'American', 'public', 'would', 'be', 'receptive', 'non-PC', 'attitudes', 'various', 'prejudices', 'reflected', 'film', 'views', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'prevalent', '60', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'were', 'bit', 'more', 'enlightened', '1984', 'unsophisticated', 'plot', 'casts', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Jennilee', 'Harrison', 'Three', 'Company', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'G.D.', 'Spradlin', 'really', 'cartoonish', 'roles', 'Jones', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'actress', 'Elmer', 'Gantry', 'could', 'play', 'Zack', 'good', 'old', 'broad', 'wife', 'sleep', 'role', 'just', 'so', 'beneath', 'Cromwell', 'gig', 'being', 'handcuffed', 'buck', 'naked', 'pole', 'ever', 'affable', 'Garner', 'be', 'enjoying', 'pro', 'end', 'much', 'tank', 'even', 'limping', 'finish', 'line.Character', 'development', 'minimal', 'dialog', 'deliberately', 'aimed', 'low', 'often', 'cringeworthy', 'portrayal', 'people', 'south', 'sheriff', 'particular', 'perpetuate', 'overused', 'stereotype', 'film', 'finale', 'confrontation', 'muddy', 'field', 'just', 'mess.Tank', 'not', 'extremely', 'offensive', 'film', 'insensitivity', 'places', 'certainly', 'deliberate', 'choice', 'results', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'are', 'questionable', 'taste', 'talented', 'cast', 'clearly', 'capable', 'better', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'what', 'may', 'leave', 'little', 'incredulous', 'poor', 'judgment', 'shown']",Tank
