1661381,A1JIYR90LWBGZV,B00DUGC2OS,A. Lloyd,"[5, 7]","Well I am 36 days in and going strong. I really like this program. The two trainers are not irritating (ok the female is slightly but its bearable) and I have never been unbearably sore like with most programs. I am losing weight by doing the daily workouts and calorie counting and I can see great definition happening. I really enjoy doing the work outs because they are not overwhelming and I know that after two sets we move on. Only gave 4 stars because I do add additional cardio since these are only 30 minutes long and I want more calorie burn. I plan on finishing this program, and am excited because this is the first time I haven't quit a few days in or whined and skipped days because I was sore. I really recommend this, especially because the price is so good.",4,"Great program, 1st time Ive stuck with it",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,774,"['Well', 'am', '36', 'days', 'going', 'strong', 'really', 'program', 'two', 'trainers', 'are', 'not', 'irritating', 'female', 'slightly', 'bearable', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'unbearably', 'sore', 'most', 'programs', 'am', 'losing', 'weight', 'doing', 'daily', 'workouts', 'calorie', 'counting', 'can', 'see', 'great', 'definition', 'happening', 'really', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'work', 'outs', 'are', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'know', 'two', 'sets', 'move', 'Only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'do', 'add', 'additional', 'cardio', 'are', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'want', 'more', 'calorie', 'burn', 'plan', 'finishing', 'program', 'am', 'excited', 'first', 'time', 'have', ""n't"", 'quit', 'few', 'days', 'whined', 'skipped', 'days', 'was', 'sore', 'really', 'recommend', 'especially', 'price', 'so', 'good']",BeFit In 90 Workout System
1661382,A1NZM2O1PVXB1V,B00DUGC2OS,"Amazon Customer ""tleevogt""","[17, 19]","I was looking for short but effective workouts. I was thinking about Beachbody's T25 when I saw this. So, I thought, what the heck and pre-ordered it. I even looked at few of the workouts on YouTube and thought it was worth a shot. And, I'm glad I did. This is a very well organized system. There is a different set of workouts for each day. And, you don't need to go through and select the workouts you need for a particular day. Each DVD has ALL of the days pre-mixed by month, week, and day. So, All you really need to do is push play. I like both of the instructors. The routines are easy to follow. My one problem is the lack of modifiers for some of the high impact moves. But, I've done enough workouts to know how to modify it for myself. Overall, a great investment.",4,Good Workout and a Great Price,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,775,"['was', 'looking', 'short', 'effective', 'workouts', 'was', 'thinking', 'Beachbody', 'T25', 'when', 'saw', 'So', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'pre-ordered', 'even', 'looked', 'few', 'workouts', 'YouTube', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'shot', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'organized', 'system', 'different', 'set', 'workouts', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'go', 'select', 'workouts', 'need', 'particular', 'day', 'DVD', 'days', 'pre-mixed', 'month', 'week', 'day', 'So', 'All', 'really', 'need', 'do', 'push', 'play', 'instructors', 'routines', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'one', 'problem', 'lack', 'modifiers', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'done', 'enough', 'workouts', 'know', 'how', 'modify', 'Overall', 'great', 'investment']",BeFit In 90 Workout System
1661383,A2YTX0ILS4UTY0,B00DUGC2OS,chris clark,"[1, 1]","It is a good workout, it has good cardio and strength aspects, I just don't really care for the trainers, Samantha is annoying, in one part of the DVD she says, &#34;I don't know about you but i hate fat...&#34;  and the guy is really hard to understand-but this could be my tv I guess. I found the speeds of some exercises to be off as well, some that should have been done at a slower pace were sped through, like some of the weight lifting moves, and others were a little slow, like some of the cardio moves. Overall though, if this isnt something that would bother you, it is a good workout and a good deal for the price.",3,Mahhh,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,625,"['good', 'workout', 'good', 'cardio', 'strength', 'aspects', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'trainers', 'Samantha', 'annoying', 'one', 'part', 'DVD', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'i', 'hate', 'fat', '34', 'guy', 'really', 'hard', 'understand-but', 'could', 'be', 'tv', 'guess', 'found', 'speeds', 'exercises', 'be', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'slower', 'pace', 'were', 'sped', 'weight', 'lifting', 'moves', 'others', 'were', 'little', 'slow', 'cardio', 'moves', 'Overall', 'isnt', 'something', 'would', 'bother', 'good', 'workout', 'good', 'deal', 'price']",BeFit In 90 Workout System
1661384,AF3XJYPJZRDPX,B00DUGC2OS,K. Edwards,"[0, 0]","I'm currently in the 11th week out of 13 and I have to say that I highly recommend this workout.  The routines really are a mixture of plyo, yoga and cardio with a healthy dosage of strength training. Unlike some other 90 day workouts, there is no dread factor here. The videos range from 32-35 minutes with a warm-up which is the same for the entire month.I like that fact that the videos are affordable and short time wise.  The negatives for me include some awkward packing (especially in the MMA portion).  The yoga is fast paced so if you are new to yoga then you might want to skip it and find a slower yoga video.I find that month 3 has a lot more cardio and can be high impact so if you have joints that are a problem, I would skip it.",4,Good overall workout,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,743,"[""'m"", 'currently', '11th', 'week', '13', 'have', 'say', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'routines', 'really', 'are', 'mixture', 'plyo', 'yoga', 'cardio', 'healthy', 'dosage', 'strength', 'training', 'other', '90', 'day', 'workouts', 'dread', 'factor', 'here', 'videos', 'range', '32-35', 'minutes', 'warm-up', 'same', 'entire', 'month.I', 'fact', 'videos', 'are', 'affordable', 'short', 'time', 'wise', 'negatives', 'include', 'awkward', 'packing', 'especially', 'MMA', 'portion', 'yoga', 'fast', 'paced', 'so', 'are', 'new', 'yoga', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'skip', 'find', 'slower', 'yoga', 'video.I', 'find', 'month', '3', 'lot', 'more', 'cardio', 'can', 'be', 'high', 'impact', 'so', 'have', 'joints', 'are', 'problem', 'would', 'skip']",BeFit In 90 Workout System

I have lost a lot of weight but don't really consider myself 'in-shape' (better shape than it was, however) so I do struggle with the cardio routines. I will admit that I skip the yoga routines because they are too fast paced for my comfort level. The stretching routines are great, so I only gave it four stars because of the super fast pace of the yoga portions Overall I am glad I bought (it's a great variety of workouts for $20!) the DVD set.",4,"Very good, but not perfect",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,548,"['am', 'almost', 'second', 'month', 'really', 'program', 'especially', 'strength', 'training', 'have', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'consider', ""'in-shape"", 'better', 'shape', 'was', 'however', 'so', 'do', 'struggle', 'cardio', 'routines', 'will', 'admit', 'skip', 'yoga', 'routines', 'are', 'too', 'fast', 'paced', 'comfort', 'level', 'stretching', 'routines', 'are', 'great', 'so', 'only', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'super', 'fast', 'pace', 'yoga', 'portions', 'Overall', 'am', 'glad', 'bought', 'great', 'variety', 'workouts', '20', 'DVD', 'set']",BeFit In 90 Workout System
