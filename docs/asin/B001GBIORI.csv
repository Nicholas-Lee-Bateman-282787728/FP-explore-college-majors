However, it has quickly become my favorite cardio workout! I like the fact that I was CHALLENGED mentally as well as physically, going beyond traditional step routines. (I feel like I've run for miles after completing this video.) The preview section helped some, but you simply have to watch the video carefully and move with the music. (However, this is definitely not for the novice exerciser.) Since I've been stepping for a while, I did not try Amy's original step challenge (this is my first of her videos), but I will be looking for more of her workouts.",5,Definitely a CHALLENGE!,1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,665,"['admit', 'was', 'initially', 'overwhelming', 'had', 'LOT', 'stops', 'starts', 'first', 'attempts', 'However', 'quickly', 'become', 'favorite', 'cardio', 'workout', 'like', 'fact', 'was', 'CHALLENGED', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'physically', 'going', 'traditional', 'step', 'routines', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'run', 'miles', 'completing', 'video', 'preview', 'section', 'helped', 'simply', 'have', 'watch', 'video', 'carefully', 'move', 'music', 'However', 'definitely', 'not', 'novice', 'exerciser', ""'ve"", 'been', 'stepping', 'while', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'Amy', 'original', 'step', 'challenge', 'first', 'videos', 'will', 'be', 'looking', 'more', 'workouts']",Amy Bento: Advanced Step Challenge 2

1193836,A2FMPWCAQSQJ2E,B001GBIORI,Amazon Customer,"[11, 11]","The challenge in this workout doesn't come from intensity or high impact, instead it is caused by the complex choreography that is not cued with enough detail. For example, Amy gives some of the combinations names and then calls them out during the workout. If it was cued step by step instead, it would make it so much easier and make it a 5-star workout. The tutorial helps a little but it takes a lot of repetition to get it down during the workout for this same reason. After about 4 to 5 tries I can do combo 1 - 3, 4 is still a challenge and 5 I have to skip. There are some premixes with weights from the Slo-Mo video that are really great, making this DVD very versatile. I'm not giving up to learn all of it, because it is a fun workout, but it takes determination to get there. If you're not an advanced, experienced stepper, don't try it.",4,"We Need Detailed Cueing, Amy!",1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,849,"['challenge', 'workout', ""n't"", 'come', 'intensity', 'high', 'impact', 'instead', 'caused', 'complex', 'choreography', 'not', 'cued', 'enough', 'detail', 'example', 'Amy', 'combinations', 'names', 'then', 'out', 'workout', 'was', 'cued', 'step', 'step', 'instead', 'would', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'make', '5-star', 'workout', 'tutorial', 'little', 'lot', 'repetition', 'get', 'down', 'workout', 'same', 'reason', 'about', '4', '5', 'tries', 'can', 'do', 'combo', '1', '3', '4', 'still', 'challenge', '5', 'have', 'skip', 'are', 'premixes', 'weights', 'Slo-Mo', 'video', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'making', 'DVD', 'very', 'versatile', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'learn', 'fun', 'workout', 'determination', 'get', 'there', ""'re"", 'not', 'advanced', 'experienced', 'stepper', 'do', ""n't"", 'try']",Amy Bento: Advanced Step Challenge 2

Yes, it is difficult to learn, but I'd rather learn step workouts than do crosswords or other puzzle to keep my mind sharp, like the experts say we should do.  I am an advanced exerciser and use Cathe, the old Firms, Christy Taylor, etc. and I think this workout is by far the funnest I've ever done.  The time flies, it doesn't feel like a workout because it's fun, yet I'm a sweaty mess when I'm through.  There are 5 chapters (routines) to learn and I found just going through one-by-one each day I wanted to try it worked great for me.  The bonus of this video is the premixes... multiple workouts are available, from around 38 minutes to almost 1 1/2 hours.

1193840,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,B001GBIORI,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[2, 2]","Amy has produced another winner step workout.  The choreography is somewhat complex, so if you like your step routines simple, this may not be the workout for you.What I loved about this workout:**the complex step routines.  I love complex choreography so this was big plus for me.  I still don't have all the moves down, but I have fun with the routine anyway.  I love workouts that make me think. Each time I do the workout, I `get' a bit more of the routines so it keeps getting more fun.  It helped to view the preview moves before attempting this workout.**Amy's teaching style.  She teaches part of the routine, you repeat it a few times and then she teaches the next section.  She also has you doing Routines 1 & 2 together, 3 & 4 together,etc., so you have plenty of chances to practice the moves.**the music.  It's upbeat and fast paced.  I can't help but smile when I'm working out.**it's deceptively hard.  I consider myself an advanced exerciser and I can't usually do the entire routine without running out of steam.  This is very rare for me but I don't get discouraged, I view this as a challenge and something to work towards.**the premixes of varying lengths.  I also like that premixes include the power-up section.There are a few things to note about this workout, but for me they didn't detract from my enjoyment.  The things:**it was a little hard to hear Amy's voice over the music.  I noticed this more the first few times I did the workout since I was trying to listen to her instructions.**it took me a while to get used to Amy's terminology.  I like how she cues the moves by telling us what moves are coming up next, but not until I understood what she called each move.**the power up section is just kind of stuck at the end, after the cool down, but before the stretch.  If you want to include this section in your workout, it's a little awkward to have to finish Step Routine 5, stop the DVD and select the Power Up section.**the choreography is complex and Amy doesn't spend a lot of time breaking down the moves.  I just keep alternating right and left foot and keep my heart rate up.If you want a fun and challenging step workoutwith complex choreography, you may like this.",5,"Complex, yet very fun step routines",1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,2207,"['Amy', 'produced', 'winner', 'step', 'workout', 'choreography', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'so', 'step', 'routines', 'simple', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'workout', 'you.What', 'loved', 'workout', '**the', 'complex', 'step', 'routines', 'love', 'complex', 'choreography', 'was', 'big', 'plus', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'moves', 'down', 'have', 'fun', 'routine', 'anyway', 'love', 'workouts', 'make', 'think', 'time', 'do', 'workout', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'routines', 'getting', 'more', 'fun', 'helped', 'view', 'preview', 'attempting', 'workout', '**Amy', 'teaching', 'style', 'part', 'routine', 'repeat', 'few', 'times', 'then', 'next', 'section', 'also', 'doing', 'Routines', '1', '2', 'together', '3', '4', 'together', 'etc.', 'have', 'plenty', 'chances', 'practice', 'moves', '**the', 'music', 'upbeat', 'fast', 'paced', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'when', ""'m"", 'working', 'out', '**it', 'deceptively', 'hard', 'consider', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'ca', ""n't"", 'usually', 'do', 'entire', 'routine', 'running', 'out', 'steam', 'very', 'rare', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'discouraged', 'view', 'challenge', 'something', 'work', 'towards', '**the', 'premixes', 'varying', 'lengths', 'also', 'like', 'premixes', 'include', 'power-up', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'note', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'detract', 'enjoyment', 'things', '**it', 'was', 'little', 'hard', 'hear', 'Amy', 'voice', 'music', 'noticed', 'more', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'workout', 'was', 'trying', 'listen', 'instructions', '**it', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'Amy', 'terminology', 'how', 'moves', 'telling', 'moves', 'are', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'not', 'understood', 'what', 'called', 'move', '**the', 'power', 'section', 'just', 'kind', 'stuck', 'end', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch', 'want', 'include', 'section', 'workout', 'little', 'awkward', 'have', 'finish', 'Step', 'Routine', '5', 'stop', 'DVD', 'select', 'Power', 'Up', 'section', '**the', 'choreography', 'complex', 'Amy', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'breaking', 'down', 'moves', 'just', 'keep', 'alternating', 'right', 'left', 'foot', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'want', 'fun', 'challenging', 'step', 'workoutwith', 'complex', 'choreography', 'may', 'like']",Amy Bento: Advanced Step Challenge 2
