1510273,A1XK361ENUA19Q,B0064SVO9I,Alan C. Schriver,"[4, 4]","These films were by no means masterpieces, but they were fun and pleasant, and this set was well worth the price.  All you get is one 2-sided disc, meaning the only label is near the center hole and almost needs a magnifying glass to read.  Mine was mislabeled (the side with Short Circuit 1 was labeled Short Circuit 2, and vice versa) but that's a minor problem.  I once bought a Cyndi Lauper 45 that was the same way.  The movies themselves were as cute and funny as I remembered.  Fisher Stevens (Early Edition) appears in both as Ben, the Indian scientist who carries on a hilarious, ongoing struggle with American slang.  Steve Guttenberg was miscast as Number 5's inventor in the first film; he just didn't seem to need to even be there, and he was not missed at all in the sequel.  In SC 2, Cynthia Gibb made a much more interesting female lead than Ally Sheedy did in the first.  And I'm sure a lot of viewers will be relieved that Number 5 (later called Johnny) didn't spend nearly as much time watching TV in SC 2.",3,Number 5 lives on in DVD format,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,1025,"['films', 'were', 'means', 'masterpieces', 'were', 'fun', 'pleasant', 'set', 'was', 'well', 'price', 'get', 'one', '2-sided', 'disc', 'meaning', 'only', 'label', 'center', 'hole', 'almost', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'read', 'Mine', 'was', 'mislabeled', 'side', 'Short', 'Circuit', '1', 'was', 'labeled', 'Short', 'Circuit', '2', 'vice', 'versa', 'minor', 'problem', 'once', 'bought', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', '45', 'was', 'same', 'way', 'movies', 'were', 'cute', 'funny', 'remembered', 'Fisher', 'Stevens', 'Early', 'Edition', 'Ben', 'Indian', 'scientist', 'who', 'hilarious', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'American', 'slang', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'was', 'miscast', 'Number', '5', 'inventor', 'first', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'need', 'even', 'be', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'missed', 'sequel', 'SC', '2', 'Cynthia', 'Gibb', 'made', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'female', 'lead', 'Ally', 'Sheedy', 'did', 'first', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'relieved', 'Number', '5', 'later', 'called', 'Johnny', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'TV', 'SC', '2']",Short Circuit/Short Circuit 2

The only drawback--if you can call it that, is that it's a double-sided DVD which is not my favorite format--I prefer separate discs; but I've used both sides a couple of times now--showed them to my grandkids who are old enough to handle the material (I think it's PG-13), and they positively loved the movies.  A certain *other* movie came out which seems to have taken a LOT of material (most particularly the actual design of the robot) and produced a fairly well known motion picture much later--this one (Short Circuit) was made before all the computer generated hocus pocus--and still beats that one like a drum.
