But I would wager that even the cast and crew thought they were going to see the 1982 Australian movie ""Starstruck"" which has a cult following.  In fact, just about every movie ever made has a cult following, except for this one.  Don't ask me why this very entertaining comedy is so utterly forgotten.  It shouldn't be.  If you are interested in the movie business, like Jamie Kennedy or just want to see an old fashioned movie, then you should see this.  It's really very, very good.

I'm happy to see that there is someone else out there who was just as eager as I was to get their hands on this DVD!I saw this movie four times in the theatres, back in '83, in its initial USA release. It was one of those exceptional films that really stuck with me. I found a VHS copy later in the 80s and was happy with that for a many years. I never saw any other DVD versions for sale, so I was very excited to see that this release was coming out.If you are a fan of this film, you will be very gratified to see this DVD! The quality is wonderful. By the climactic end of the story, I was in tears - of pure joy! There were so many details I was never able to see before - it's a beautiful print of the film. The music sounds fantastic - truly amazing from start to finish!If you have never seen this film, it is a pearl! And this new DVD edition brings it all across clean and clear. Put it on, crank up the sound and get ready for a rocking good time!Especially interesting was the interview with Armstrong and Elfick! This was not an easy film for them to make.

Well, that description does it a great injustice.

She has talent but needs a break.  Her 14-year-old cousin Angus acts as her agent and sets up the stunts that get her a chance at the fame she seeks.  The road is rocky with all sorts of roadblocks and detours including family, work, sexual orientations and just getting where she needs to be.At more than twenty-years-old this film remains fresh in ways other simply can not.

379465,A2MH0QDRZFWF2S,6303544584,Kenton Larsen,"[6, 6]","Starstruck is one of the great forgotten flicks of the 80s.Its name should be uttered with quiet reverence in the same breath as Valley Girl, Sixteen Candles, and the Breakfast Club, but - sadly - namedrop the film in North America, and you're likely to get a resounding ""Huh?,"" even among 80s aficionados.I've probably watched my old, decrepit VHS of this movie about 100 times over the last 20 years, and the thing that's always brought me back for more is how the sincerity and quirkiness of the family scenes plays against the spirited and energetic new wave musical numbers - sure, they're amateurish by today's standards, but the complete conviction and enthusiasm with which they're executed is a giddy (not guilty!) pleasure.The song highlights here are many, but my personal favorites are ""Body and Soul,"" the Split Enz song from the band's best CD, Frenzy, and the irrepressible ""I Want to Live in a House,"" which lays bare the link between punk rebellion and nerdy frustration; Ross O'Donovan and his merry band of misfits ""oi, oi, oi"" their way through a sarcastic and convincing rave up with more nervous energy than an early Elvis Costello video; if you don't have goosebumps by the key change, or you don't immediatlely watch it again, congratulations: you're clinically dead.The DVD is a huge improvement on the VHS edition. It's great to finally see the film in all its widescreen glory with much-improved sound and picture quality. I was a bit worried that part of the film's charm lay in the nostalgia of watching it on washed-out videotape, but that's definitely not the case. The greatest sin of the VHS edition, as it turns out, was that it obsured the fantastic production design. I must've paused the DVD 15 or 20 times last night to take a closer look at the background. Bravo!The extras are interesting, but -- where are the interviews with Jo Kennedy and Ross O'Donovan? It's impossible to watch this film without wanting to find out more about both of them. As Gillian Armstrong notes in the extras, O'Donovan was 17 when he made the film (playing a 14 year old), which would make him 41 today. How does he feel about the film and his performance today? An expanded edition, please.The discussion with screenwriter Stephen MacLean is interesting, in that he doesn't seem to like the film very much; ahh, the classic grouchy screenwriter who wanted to direct his own work! He cultivates the image, as he's interviewed on the beach getting a leg massage.Interestingly, MacLean says that he thinks O'Donovan's performance is weak(!), and he wishes he could've chosen the songs himself. He also recalls a time he saw the film in a theatre and found himself sitting next to a six-year-old girl, who attempts to explain what's going on to her two-year-old sister. Good stuff.All the interviewees say the film did better in the U.S. than Australia, which is hard to believe. However, I do recall Siskel and Ebert giving Starstruck two thumbs up, so that might've done the trick (hey, it worked for My Dinner with Andre).The deleted scenes aren't so great; they're mostly extended scenes, and by ""extended"" I'm using the term liberally -- they're about five seconds longer than the originals.I join the (building?) chorus of fans demanding a CD of the music; and, while we're at it, why don't we also demand the DVD release of Modern Girls, the other great forgotten 80s flick (notable for featuring Depeche Mode's should-have-been-a-hit But Not Tonight)?",5,"Starstruck has ""that certain something extra!""",1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,3475,"['Starstruck', 'one', 'great', 'forgotten', 'flicks', '80s.Its', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'uttered', 'quiet', 'reverence', 'same', 'breath', 'Valley', 'Girl', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'sadly', 'namedrop', 'film', 'North', 'America', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'resounding', 'Huh', 'even', '80s', 'aficionados.I', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', 'old', 'decrepit', 'VHS', 'movie', '100', 'times', 'last', '20', 'years', 'thing', 'always', 'brought', 'back', 'more', 'how', 'sincerity', 'quirkiness', 'family', 'plays', 'spirited', 'energetic', 'new', 'wave', 'musical', 'numbers', 'sure', ""'re"", 'amateurish', 'today', 'standards', 'complete', 'conviction', 'enthusiasm', ""'re"", 'executed', 'giddy', 'not', 'guilty', 'pleasure.The', 'song', 'highlights', 'here', 'are', 'many', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'Body', 'Soul', 'Split', 'Enz', 'song', 'band', 'best', 'CD', 'Frenzy', 'irrepressible', 'Want', 'Live', 'House', 'link', 'punk', 'rebellion', 'nerdy', 'frustration', 'Ross', ""O'Donovan"", 'merry', 'band', 'misfits', 'oi', 'way', 'sarcastic', 'convincing', 'rave', 'up', 'more', 'nervous', 'energy', 'early', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'goosebumps', 'key', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'immediatlely', 'watch', 'again', 'congratulations', ""'re"", 'clinically', 'dead.The', 'DVD', 'huge', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'edition', 'great', 'finally', 'see', 'film', 'widescreen', 'glory', 'much-improved', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'bit', 'worried', 'part', 'film', 'charm', 'lay', 'nostalgia', 'watching', 'washed-out', 'videotape', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'greatest', 'sin', 'VHS', 'edition', 'out', 'was', 'obsured', 'fantastic', 'production', 'design', 'must', ""'ve"", 'paused', 'DVD', '15', '20', 'times', 'last', 'night', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'background', 'Bravo', 'extras', 'are', 'interesting', 'where', 'are', 'interviews', 'Jo', 'Kennedy', 'Ross', ""O'Donovan"", 'impossible', 'watch', 'film', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'Gillian', 'Armstrong', 'notes', 'extras', ""O'Donovan"", 'was', '17', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'playing', '14', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'make', '41', 'today', 'How', 'feel', 'film', 'performance', 'today', 'expanded', 'edition', 'please.The', 'discussion', 'screenwriter', 'Stephen', 'MacLean', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'ahh', 'classic', 'grouchy', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'wanted', 'direct', 'own', 'work', 'image', 'interviewed', 'beach', 'getting', 'leg', 'massage.Interestingly', 'MacLean', ""O'Donovan"", 'performance', 'weak', 'could', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'songs', 'also', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'theatre', 'found', 'sitting', 'next', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'two-year-old', 'sister', 'Good', 'stuff.All', 'interviewees', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'better', 'U.S.', 'Australia', 'hard', 'believe', 'However', 'do', 'recall', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'giving', 'Starstruck', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'might', ""'ve"", 'done', 'trick', 'hey', 'worked', 'My', 'Dinner', 'Andre', '.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'great', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'extended', 'scenes', 'extended', ""'m"", 'using', 'term', 'liberally', ""'re"", 'five', 'seconds', 'longer', 'originals.I', 'join', 'building', 'chorus', 'fans', 'demanding', 'CD', 'music', ""'re"", 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'also', 'demand', 'DVD', 'release', 'Modern', 'Girls', 'other', 'great', 'forgotten', '80s', 'flick', 'notable', 'featuring', 'Depeche', 'Mode', 'should-have-been-a-hit', 'Not', 'Tonight']",Starstruck VHS

379467,A18GTN5ZU74AHF,6303544584,Scipio,"[1, 1]","First of all, this is a musical about making it as a pop musician. To like this movie, you'll have to like the music. It's mostly pop-rock with female lead vocals. If you're exclusively into heavy metal, rap or classical, this is not for you. The soundtrack is a collection/collaboration of several different performers and writers, notably including Tim Finn (of Split Enz, Crowded House & The Finn Brothers).Second of all, this is from Australia, which seems to me sort of like an odd parallel dimension of the 1980s U.S. in the movie. If you don't like Australia or Australian accents, forget it. As for me, I've always found that country strangely fascinating - altho I've never been.I first became aware of this movie waaay back in the early/mid 80's when VH1 was just starting out. In those days they were kind of quirky and uncommercial and often played the TV video version of ""Monkey In Me"" - which was fantastic (not quite the same in the movie, unfortunately). I then got the vinyl LP and was surprised at how consistently good the music was. Somehow the movie managed to get reviewed by Siskel & Ebert (2 thumbs up). After all that I decided I had to see the video and managed to rent a copy - not that easy.Frankly, I found the movie a bit uneven, but generally interesting and entertaining. The plot is fairly simple and derivative, but the music, performers and setting combine to make the finished product seem fresh and unique.  I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say, it does keep your attention. Part of the reason I enjoyed it is due to the fact that, for some reason - as MTV found out long ago - it's nice to have a visual to go along with music. While I did like the film, it didn't really seem to live up the high quality of the music. It's almost a case of a soundtrack with a movie attached.  Still, the total package is good enough to rate 4 stars in my book.If I could rate the soundtrack alone, I'd give it 5 stars. Despite the hassle of converting vinyl to clean MP3s, I did it for EVERY track on the album. (Don't bother looking for a CD of the soundtrack - it doesn't exist.) You may want to buy the DVD just to have a clean version of the music - altho some pieces are cut up and talked over somewhat.Despite the catchy music and the good reviews, this movie has always suffered in obscurity. I don't think it was much of a hit even in its native country. I guess the story behind the story of this movie is that if you really want to make a name for yourself, you don't want to stay in Australia (kind of like my home town). Other than Tim Finn, I'm not aware of anyone associated with this good movie and great soundtrack going on to bigger things....P.S. ""Monkey In Me"" IMHO is one of the best pop/rock songs ever done.

The plot is ironically traditional (showing the parallel between late 70's early 80's inspirational film to Depression-era counterparts) yet full of original characters, terrific New Wave-style music, and genuine energy.Rather than being campy or dated, the film still has legs--it's a great musical by any standard--and, if anything, it'll make more than a few nostalgic for a kind of nifty time. Expect colored hair, too much makeup, and crazy clothes (but no tattoos or piercings--considered anti-social and hostile by that charming crowd back then), expect danceable, hooky music by Australia's best (including a sample of the old Split Enz crowd) and expect a lot of fun. This is exactly the kind of movie needed for these scary and too-earnest times. Your kids will love this film to pieces!PS: I hope this inspires a Split Enz/Finn Brothers/etc. revival!",5,Welcome Back!,1124841600,"08 24, 2005",2005,983,"['How', 'wonderful', 'see', 'upbeat', 'gem', 'Aussie', 'musical', 'comedy', 'back', 'print', 'selling', 'racks', 'major', 'outlets', 'plot', 'ironically', 'traditional', 'showing', 'parallel', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'inspirational', 'film', 'Depression-era', 'counterparts', 'yet', 'full', 'original', 'characters', 'terrific', 'New', 'Wave-style', 'music', 'energy.Rather', 'being', 'campy', 'dated', 'film', 'still', 'legs', 'great', 'musical', 'standard', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'make', 'more', 'few', 'nostalgic', 'kind', 'nifty', 'time', 'Expect', 'colored', 'hair', 'too', 'much', 'makeup', 'crazy', 'clothes', 'tattoos', 'piercings', 'considered', 'anti-social', 'hostile', 'charming', 'crowd', 'back', 'then', 'expect', 'danceable', 'hooky', 'music', 'Australia', 'best', 'including', 'sample', 'old', 'Split', 'Enz', 'crowd', 'expect', 'lot', 'fun', 'exactly', 'kind', 'movie', 'needed', 'scary', 'too-earnest', 'times', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'pieces', 'PS', 'hope', 'Split', 'Enz/Finn', 'Brothers/etc', 'revival']",Starstruck VHS
