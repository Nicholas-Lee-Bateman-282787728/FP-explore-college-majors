1436007,A16XAW90Q8O71O,B0050QNOB6,Albatross Necklace,"[4, 6]","This is the story of some elementary school kids who go around dealing with ghosts. While that may not sound that interesting to most people, the thing that makes this interesting is the voice track.The voice track is like MST3K wrote the English localization, it feels raw and from the hip. The breaking of 4th wall and the industry jokes will last but I'm not sure how this will age as some of the pop culture references are getting old. Think of the dialog as a less refined version of Shin Chan. Seeing the number of the voice actors who wrote the English script, I imagine this was rather cathartic for them.I do not see an age rating on this in Prime so I should point out that while this may involve elementary school kids, you probably do not want to show this to elementary school kids.If you enjoy damaged humor you should get some laughs out of this series.",4,Better than expected.,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,868,"['story', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'who', 'go', 'dealing', 'ghosts', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'interesting', 'most', 'people', 'thing', 'interesting', 'voice', 'track.The', 'voice', 'track', 'MST3K', 'wrote', 'English', 'localization', 'raw', 'hip', 'breaking', '4th', 'wall', 'industry', 'jokes', 'will', 'last', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'will', 'age', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'are', 'getting', 'old', 'Think', 'dialog', 'less', 'refined', 'version', 'Shin', 'Chan', 'Seeing', 'number', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'wrote', 'English', 'script', 'imagine', 'was', 'rather', 'cathartic', 'them.I', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'age', 'rating', 'Prime', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'may', 'involve', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'probably', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'show', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids.If', 'enjoy', 'damaged', 'humor', 'should', 'get', 'laughs', 'series']",Ghost Stories Season 1 and 2

He is funny and makes the show worthwhile. The stories arent too bad and looks better then other ghost shows on television at the moment.

I like the narrator. His dark sense of humor is the same as mine and he makes each episode fun and fast paced (unlike History Channel's dried up Haunted History series) as well as not making it too scary for kids.  My only complaint is that this series wasn't given another season. Oh well. At least we have this set to rewatch over and over again.Also, as a bonus feature we are given Ghostly Lovers which is basically about a group of lonely women who are apparently having sexual encounters with ghosts.  No need for toys and battery powered boyfriends here when you have Casper the Hot and Horny Ghost.

1436016,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B0050QNOB6,TawnTawn,"[2, 3]","Ghost Stories has several episodes with various ghosts. The only interesting one was the Bonus which was women having ghost lovers, one of which was her deceased husband. Strangely, she never asks him, ""What is it like where you are? Where are you actually?"" Etc.  They have romantic dates with glasses of champagne (it doesn't show him drinking his). But the three stories are very similar (except for the other two women, one, it's a stranger, and the other it's her Indian lover in a previous life).At the beginning of the episodes, there are lots of pictures flashing and jerking around.  The intermittent screams are annoying and make it difficult to hear the speakers. The narrator is also extremely irritating, and he always says, ""Trust me"" or ""Believe ME""  which got tiresome. Also weird was that no one corrected the speakers or said, let's do that over: saying down for up, seen for saw, communitive for communicative, etc. One of the interviewees who lived in the Villisca house as a child says, ""There isn't a time I don't think about Villisca."" So she thinks about Villisca non-stop?In every episode that I watched (I didn't watch all - too boring) they talk about other ghosts, not the one the episode is supposed to be about.  The Trans Alleghany Lunatic Asylum is talked about, next thing I know, they're talking about a train tunnel and a train came too fast, and the three railroad workers in the tunnel hurried to get into the cubbies, but some didn't make it in time. I guess they didn't have a train schedule, or maybe they thought they still had ten minutes or so. The engineer didn't give a reason for his speed. Did they ask him and he just clammed up?  Also two children's ghosts were in the tunnel, but nobody knows why.. Then, it goes back the Lunatic Asylum, where a little girl named Lilly was born and died at age nine. Of what? Lilly's ghost likes to play ball and eat snacks.  According to one psychic, Lilly's mother is a very elderly woman ghost whose name started with an ""E"".  The narrator says he has seen the records (it shows a book with a hand covering up a name) and supposedly a woman with the first initial ""E"" was admitted in the 1920's.  What's the big secret? Surely she is long dead by now.One of the local women who was an expert on both the tunnel and the asylum says things like, ""Me and three other ladies that was in my group...""(I've since looked up Lilly and according to Stephen Wagner, paranormal researcher, she only lived a few hours. Her mother, Gladys Ravensfield, lost her husband in the civil war, and was raped by soldiers. This caused her to lose her mind, and be admitted to the asylum, where she gave birth to Lilly.)Elma Sands was murdered (doesn't say how) by her lover in NYC, and he threw her body in a well. The well is now in the basement of a trendy bar in Soho.  Her lover took her on a sleigh ride in December and to the place where the well was, but there was no snow.  Lots of green grass. A bartender went downstairs to get a bottle of liquor, which was locked up behind a chain link fence. He unlocked the padlock, went inside, and when he came to leave, the lock was locked again. So he had to sit there and wait for someone to find him. They didn't interview the person who found him.Some of the ghosts were the murderers. You'd think it would be the innocent victim, but no. One man killed his ""girlfriend"" in 1833, although she was dating other men and refused to attend a ball with him (she went with another guy and was brought back by a totally different one). So he pretends to be sick so she will take care of him. Why would she take care of him? He kills her with a knife that she gave him. In the reenactment, the woman is wearing dark red nail polish which was not in use in 1833.The show is weak.",2,Weak,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,3789,"['Ghost', 'Stories', 'several', 'episodes', 'various', 'ghosts', 'only', 'interesting', 'one', 'was', 'Bonus', 'was', 'women', 'having', 'ghost', 'lovers', 'one', 'was', 'deceased', 'husband', 'Strangely', 'never', 'What', 'where', 'are', 'Where', 'are', 'actually', 'Etc', 'have', 'romantic', 'dates', 'glasses', 'champagne', ""n't"", 'show', 'drinking', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'other', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'stranger', 'other', 'Indian', 'lover', 'previous', 'life', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'are', 'lots', 'pictures', 'flashing', 'jerking', 'around', 'intermittent', 'screams', 'are', 'annoying', 'make', 'difficult', 'hear', 'speakers', 'narrator', 'also', 'extremely', 'irritating', 'always', 'Trust', 'Believe', 'ME', 'got', 'tiresome', 'Also', 'weird', 'was', 'one', 'corrected', 'speakers', 'said', 'let', 'do', 'saying', 'down', 'up', 'seen', 'saw', 'communitive', 'communicative', 'etc', 'One', 'interviewees', 'who', 'lived', 'Villisca', 'house', 'child', ""n't"", 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Villisca', 'Villisca', 'non-stop', 'episode', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'too', 'boring', 'talk', 'other', 'ghosts', 'not', 'one', 'episode', 'supposed', 'be', 'about', 'Trans', 'Alleghany', 'Lunatic', 'Asylum', 'talked', 'next', 'thing', 'know', ""'re"", 'talking', 'train', 'tunnel', 'train', 'came', 'too', 'fast', 'three', 'railroad', 'workers', 'tunnel', 'hurried', 'get', 'cubbies', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'time', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'train', 'schedule', 'maybe', 'thought', 'still', 'had', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'engineer', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'reason', 'speed', 'Did', 'ask', 'just', 'clammed', 'up', 'Also', 'two', 'children', 'ghosts', 'were', 'tunnel', 'nobody', 'why..', 'Then', 'back', 'Lunatic', 'Asylum', 'where', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Lilly', 'was', 'born', 'died', 'age', 'nine', 'what', 'Lilly', 'ghost', 'likes', 'play', 'ball', 'eat', 'snacks', 'According', 'one', 'psychic', 'Lilly', 'mother', 'very', 'elderly', 'woman', 'ghost', 'name', 'started', 'E', 'narrator', 'seen', 'records', 'book', 'hand', 'covering', 'up', 'name', 'supposedly', 'woman', 'first', 'initial', 'E', 'was', 'admitted', '1920', 'What', 'big', 'secret', 'Surely', 'long', 'dead', 'now.One', 'local', 'women', 'who', 'was', 'expert', 'tunnel', 'asylum', 'things', 'Me', 'three', 'other', 'ladies', 'was', 'group', ""'ve"", 'looked', 'up', 'Lilly', 'according', 'Stephen', 'Wagner', 'paranormal', 'researcher', 'only', 'lived', 'few', 'hours', 'mother', 'Gladys', 'Ravensfield', 'lost', 'husband', 'civil', 'war', 'was', 'raped', 'soldiers', 'caused', 'lose', 'mind', 'be', 'admitted', 'asylum', 'where', 'gave', 'birth', 'Lilly', 'Elma', 'Sands', 'was', 'murdered', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'lover', 'NYC', 'threw', 'body', 'well', 'well', 'now', 'basement', 'trendy', 'bar', 'Soho', 'lover', 'took', 'sleigh', 'ride', 'December', 'place', 'where', 'well', 'was', 'was', 'snow', 'Lots', 'green', 'grass', 'bartender', 'went', 'downstairs', 'get', 'bottle', 'liquor', 'was', 'locked', 'up', 'chain', 'link', 'fence', 'unlocked', 'padlock', 'went', 'when', 'came', 'leave', 'lock', 'was', 'locked', 'again', 'had', 'sit', 'there', 'wait', 'someone', 'find', 'did', ""n't"", 'interview', 'person', 'who', 'found', 'him.Some', 'ghosts', 'were', 'murderers', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'innocent', 'victim', 'One', 'man', 'killed', 'girlfriend', '1833', 'was', 'dating', 'other', 'men', 'refused', 'attend', 'ball', 'went', 'guy', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'totally', 'different', 'one', 'be', 'sick', 'will', 'take', 'care', 'Why', 'would', 'take', 'care', 'knife', 'gave', 'reenactment', 'woman', 'wearing', 'dark', 'red', 'nail', 'polish', 'was', 'not', 'use', '1833.The', 'show', 'weak']",Ghost Stories Season 1 and 2
