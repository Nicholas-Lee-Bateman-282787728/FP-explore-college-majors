This is somewhat true, and it was mildly entertaining, but I was disappointed in that it didn't really follow through with the concept.  I enjoyed The Blair Witch Project, and this takes a lot from that movie except it doesn't follow through with the concept.  The basic story involves a old guy who once worked on a secret military project which ultimately met with a somewhat supicious end.  Nearly all the people and all the people those people knew died mysteriously, with the excepttion of this one guy, who has managed to hide in California for the last 40 years.  He decides he wants to come clean, tell his story, and the best way to do so is to get involved with these independant film makers and try to find evidence of what happened.  He and a couple of others worked in a farmhouse and its' underground bomb shelter in the small town of Wicksboro, Texas.  At some point Wicksboro had been wiped off the map, and all information with regards to the town vanished.  The man's work involved a machine that could supposedly detect whether or not you were an alien by analying your aura, or something like that.  It started off kind of slow, but picked up about halfway through.  As I said before, I was a little disappointed that they really didn't follow through with the concept in that they really didn't make any effort to make this seem real, unlike The Blair Witch Project.  From the credits at the beginning and the end of the movie, and the ominous background music that played throughout, I knew this was phoney.  With The Blair Witch Project, atleast they tried to keep you guessing whether or not it was real.  It just seems to me if you are going to make a movie like this, a documentary apparently based on real facts, play it that way all the way through.  In The Blair Witch Project (TBWP), the footage was supposedly found after the disappearance of the people who made the film and was presented to help find clues as to what happened to them.  In this movie, based on what happened at the end, what the conspiracy uncovered by the individuals was trying to protect, this film would have never seen the light of day, espcially not after great pains where shown as to how far certain people and groups were willing to go to protect the secrecy of the information.  Yeah, I know it's just a movie, but I still feel if you are going to delve into this genre, then fully explore it, and try to maintain the 'realism' all the way through.  This would include information as to where this footage came from and how it came to be released.  Maybe the concept is flawed in that with this subject matter, as if it were true, it would be in certain parties best interests to keep it hidden, so we would probably not see this.  That being said, there were some moments of creepiness and shock, and it was fun and funny at times (see where they stop off at a local convience store and the old man comes out with an armful of booze), but with respect to the genre, I didn't convince me the way I would have wanted it to.  And the alien detecting device looked a little too polished, a little too much like a manufactured toy for me to believe it was a home made gizmo.",2,I was hoping for more....,1057536000,"07 7, 2003",2003,3239,"['mix', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'X-Files', 'somewhat', 'true', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'concept', 'enjoyed', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'lot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'follow', 'concept', 'basic', 'story', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'secret', 'military', 'project', 'ultimately', 'met', 'somewhat', 'supicious', 'end', 'Nearly', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'knew', 'died', 'mysteriously', 'excepttion', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'managed', 'hide', 'California', 'last', '40', 'years', 'come', 'clean', 'tell', 'story', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'get', 'involved', 'independant', 'film', 'makers', 'try', 'find', 'evidence', 'what', 'happened', 'couple', 'others', 'worked', 'farmhouse', 'underground', 'bomb', 'shelter', 'small', 'town', 'Wicksboro', 'Texas', 'point', 'Wicksboro', 'had', 'been', 'wiped', 'off', 'map', 'information', 'regards', 'town', 'vanished', 'man', 'work', 'involved', 'machine', 'could', 'supposedly', 'detect', 'not', 'were', 'alien', 'analying', 'aura', 'something', 'started', 'off', 'kind', 'slow', 'picked', 'up', 'halfway', 'through', 'said', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'concept', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'effort', 'make', 'seem', 'real', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'credits', 'beginning', 'end', 'movie', 'ominous', 'background', 'music', 'played', 'knew', 'was', 'phoney', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'tried', 'keep', 'guessing', 'not', 'was', 'real', 'just', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'movie', 'documentary', 'apparently', 'based', 'real', 'facts', 'play', 'way', 'way', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'TBWP', 'footage', 'was', 'supposedly', 'found', 'disappearance', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'help', 'find', 'clues', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'based', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'what', 'conspiracy', 'uncovered', 'individuals', 'was', 'trying', 'protect', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'espcially', 'not', 'great', 'pains', 'where', 'shown', 'how', 'far', 'certain', 'people', 'groups', 'were', 'willing', 'go', 'protect', 'secrecy', 'information', 'Yeah', 'know', 'just', 'movie', 'still', 'feel', 'are', 'going', 'delve', 'genre', 'then', 'fully', 'explore', 'try', 'maintain', ""'realism"", 'way', 'would', 'include', 'information', 'where', 'footage', 'came', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'released', 'Maybe', 'concept', 'flawed', 'subject', 'matter', 'were', 'true', 'would', 'be', 'certain', 'parties', 'best', 'interests', 'keep', 'hidden', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'see', 'being', 'said', 'were', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'shock', 'was', 'fun', 'funny', 'times', 'see', 'where', 'stop', 'off', 'local', 'convience', 'store', 'old', 'man', 'out', 'armful', 'booze', 'respect', 'genre', 'did', ""n't"", 'convince', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'alien', 'detecting', 'device', 'looked', 'little', 'too', 'polished', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'manufactured', 'toy', 'believe', 'was', 'home', 'made', 'gizmo']",N/A

It was surprisingly funny at times, too.  Lloyd, the central figure of the film, was pretty hysterical.  The Plot:  In an attempt to uncover a decades-old conspiracy involving alien-cover-up, old guy Lloyd enlists the help of some amateur documentary filmmakers.  In the process, Lloyd inadvertantly unleashes a seemingly omnipresent gaggle of shadowy, violent federal agents who chase them down at every turn.  As the tension builds, so does the fun.  However, the last fifteen minutes of the movie are shot in virtual blackness.  All you can do is pretty much listen to what's happening in the film.  However, if you're like me and you love alien-related junk, you'll probably dig this little movie.  All those expecting special effects and violence, however, beware!  There is none.

It was excruciating to watch, and I only watchedthe entire movie because I'm one of those people who ""never"" give up on a movie,thinking that it will get better and be worthy of the good reviews. Two reviewerswent so far as to say ""If you watch this movie, don't turn it off, let it run, andyou will get a pleasant surprise!"" (remind you of those lame emails you are supposedto forward or else your wish will not come true), and ""But keep with it until theend, and you won't be disappointed."" --> I was surprised alright. Surprised at howtruly bad it was, from beginning to end (with a couple of momentary exceptions) anddisappointed at the time and money I spent watching/buying this drivel.I can appreciate low-budget independent films. However, this is a a truly dreadfulmovie on so many levels. Poor acting (with the exception of a fair performance bythe scientist), script, lighting, and camera work (with the editing and sound beingsomewhat decent). But worse of all, the plot is so unbelievable. We are supposedto believe that the human race is being taken over by aliens. OK...been donecountless times. However, in this movie, it is implied that with a device thescientist has developed he can determine that most of us (it seems) have alreadybeen taken over. The movie doesn't bother explaining any details, like ""how"" weare being taken over, for ""what"" purpose, and ""why"" no one has noticed. And it onlygets worse, but I've already wasted enough life energy.There are so many other worthy movies to watch. Just be careful in the reviewsyou read.

728537,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00007G1Z3,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I try to keep my eye open for movies that I might have missed in theatres or that went straight to DVD.  The majority of these are hardly worth the time to even watch them, but every once in awhile you come across a gem.  I had never heard of THE WICKSBORO INCIDENT before, but after reading the back cover thought that it was worth checking out.The movie proposes to be a documentary about a former military engineer named Lloyd (Bobby Harwell).  The first fifteen minutes of the movie actually look and feel like a real documentary as Lloyd tells his story about his early life, his time in the military, and working as an engineer on some top-secret government projects.  The most unusual aspect of his story is when he talks about the town of Wicksboro, Texas where he and two other men spent time working on some secret gadgets for the government that were intended to ferret out extraterrestrial life that was living among us.  According to Lloyd, he was in the underground workstation one day when he was attacked by a loud ringing in his ears. His watch starting burning into his skin and he tore it off.  Once the ringing stopped, he went above the surface to see what happened and discovered that everyone in the town had mysteriously disappeared.  He fled to L.A. to hide among the large population there and has decided that before he dies he wants his story to be told to the world.After this opening interview with Lloyd, the movie turns into some raw footage with the two friends making the documentary, Mike (Dan Brinkle) and Gary (Kyle Nudo) traveling with Lloyd to Texas in attempt to locate this mysterious town of Wicksboro (which doesn't exist on any maps from the 1940s on) to either validate his claims and continue filming or have to give up and start a new project.  At first it seems like Lloyd is just a crazy drunk. He falls asleep smoking cigarettes and drinks often.  But, when Lloyd, Mike, and Gary uncover Lloyd's old bunker, they begin to realize that he might be telling the truth.  There just might be aliens all around and they don't want their presence known by the masses.The first fifteen minutes of the film are a long interview with Lloyd and this footage looks and feels most like an actual documentary.  There are points that it's obviously not, such as all the photos that are shown, but have the central figure shown just as a black silhouette.  Still, the look and feel is right.  With that said, this is the part of the movie that many people will find most boring.  After this interview, the film's approach changes a bit and though it's never explained you soon realize that you are supposed to be viewing raw footage that was never edited for the documentary.There are moments of comedy and some moments of creepiness.  However, very little of it feels real and most of it lacks the suspense factor that a movie like this should have.  There are things that are never explained, such as exactly what has Lloyd been doing (besides trying to stay underground) for the past fifty years.  There are also elements that just don't make any sense. After finding the town of Wicksboro apparently razed to the ground, the trio decides later that night to go back and try to locate the door to Lloyd's old lab by using a witching rod. It makes no sense why they would go back in the middle of the night instead of waiting until morning.  One of the members has a cell phone.  Even if he doesn't use the phone, there's still a GPS device in it and the phone could be tracked, so I'm not sure why he keeps using the phone even after he realizes that they are being tracked through it.  There are also points in the movie where there is no light and it's not clear what is going on.  At one point there's apparently a car crash, but only two of three people in the car escape from the car.I was a little disappointed by THE WICKSBORO INCIDENT.  After the pace of the movie starting picking up, I thought it was going to turn into a kind of low-budget THEY LIVE.  Had the film followed that premise a bit more, I think it would have been more interesting.  Instead, THE WICKSBORO INCIDENT is more like a low-budget Blair Witch Project (and that's saying a lot because that film was really, really low budge) but with aliens instead of witches and a long chase scene at the end.  The movie's not a complete waste of time, but you're probably only going to want to rent it when the two movies you really want to see are already rented out.",3,"They Live, But Not Like Carpenter's THEY LIVE",1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,4473,"['try', 'keep', 'eye', 'open', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'theatres', 'went', 'straight', 'DVD', 'majority', 'are', 'hardly', 'time', 'even', 'watch', 'once', 'awhile', 'come', 'gem', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'THE', 'WICKSBORO', 'INCIDENT', 'reading', 'back', 'cover', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.The', 'movie', 'be', 'documentary', 'former', 'military', 'engineer', 'named', 'Lloyd', 'Bobby', 'Harwell', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'actually', 'look', 'feel', 'real', 'documentary', 'Lloyd', 'story', 'early', 'life', 'time', 'military', 'working', 'engineer', 'top-secret', 'government', 'projects', 'most', 'unusual', 'aspect', 'story', 'when', 'town', 'Wicksboro', 'Texas', 'where', 'two', 'other', 'men', 'spent', 'time', 'working', 'secret', 'gadgets', 'government', 'were', 'intended', 'ferret', 'out', 'extraterrestrial', 'life', 'was', 'living', 'According', 'Lloyd', 'was', 'underground', 'workstation', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'was', 'attacked', 'loud', 'ringing', 'ears', 'watch', 'starting', 'burning', 'skin', 'tore', 'off', 'ringing', 'stopped', 'went', 'surface', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'discovered', 'everyone', 'town', 'had', 'mysteriously', 'disappeared', 'fled', 'L.A.', 'hide', 'large', 'population', 'decided', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'world.After', 'opening', 'interview', 'Lloyd', 'movie', 'raw', 'footage', 'two', 'friends', 'making', 'documentary', 'Mike', 'Dan', 'Brinkle', 'Gary', 'Kyle', 'Nudo', 'traveling', 'Lloyd', 'Texas', 'attempt', 'locate', 'mysterious', 'town', 'Wicksboro', ""n't"", 'exist', 'maps', '1940s', 'validate', 'claims', 'continue', 'filming', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'start', 'new', 'project', 'first', 'Lloyd', 'just', 'crazy', 'drunk', 'asleep', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'drinks', 'often', 'when', 'Lloyd', 'Mike', 'Gary', 'uncover', 'Lloyd', 'old', 'bunker', 'begin', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'telling', 'truth', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'aliens', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'presence', 'known', 'masses.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'long', 'interview', 'Lloyd', 'footage', 'most', 'actual', 'documentary', 'are', 'points', 'obviously', 'not', 'such', 'photos', 'are', 'shown', 'have', 'central', 'figure', 'shown', 'just', 'black', 'silhouette', 'Still', 'look', 'feel', 'right', 'said', 'part', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'boring', 'interview', 'film', 'approach', 'bit', 'never', 'explained', 'soon', 'realize', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'viewing', 'raw', 'footage', 'was', 'never', 'edited', 'documentary.There', 'are', 'moments', 'comedy', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'However', 'very', 'little', 'real', 'most', 'suspense', 'factor', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'such', 'exactly', 'what', 'Lloyd', 'been', 'doing', 'trying', 'stay', 'underground', 'past', 'fifty', 'years', 'are', 'also', 'elements', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'finding', 'town', 'Wicksboro', 'apparently', 'razed', 'ground', 'trio', 'later', 'night', 'go', 'back', 'try', 'locate', 'door', 'Lloyd', 'old', 'lab', 'using', 'witching', 'rod', 'sense', 'why', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'middle', 'night', 'instead', 'waiting', 'morning', 'One', 'members', 'cell', 'phone', 'Even', ""n't"", 'use', 'phone', 'still', 'GPS', 'device', 'phone', 'could', 'be', 'tracked', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'using', 'phone', 'even', 'are', 'being', 'tracked', 'are', 'also', 'points', 'movie', 'where', 'light', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'going', 'one', 'point', 'apparently', 'car', 'crash', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'people', 'car', 'escape', 'car.I', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'THE', 'WICKSBORO', 'INCIDENT', 'pace', 'movie', 'starting', 'picking', 'up', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'kind', 'low-budget', 'THEY', 'LIVE', 'Had', 'film', 'followed', 'premise', 'bit', 'more', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'Instead', 'THE', 'WICKSBORO', 'INCIDENT', 'more', 'low-budget', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'saying', 'lot', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'low', 'budge', 'aliens', 'instead', 'witches', 'long', 'chase', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', ""'re"", 'probably', 'only', 'going', 'want', 'rent', 'when', 'two', 'movies', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'are', 'already', 'rented', 'out']",N/A
728538,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B00007G1Z3,Wisconsin Dad,"[13, 16]","My wife and I popped this ""movie"" in this past weekend. I was hoping for a good old fashioned X-filesian alien fright, and my wife just wanted some veg-time before bed. We had no idea it was in documentary format, and after a minute we both said, ""What is this junk!?! Turn it off!""So we did. I turned it off and told her to take it back to the video store.The next day I came to Amazon and read the reviews. One said that the Wicksboro Incident was quite scary. So...I got on the phone to my wife and asked her not to return the movie just yet.The Wicksboro Incident is a movie that plays as a documentary. It is in the style of the Blair Witch, but much more raw and believable as a documentary.An interviewer and a cameraman set out to talk to a scientist; one who claims to have a device that proves aliens are among us. The only problem is that the scientist is rather flaky, and has a love of the drink. At one point he exits a store with 5 bottles of wine in tow.Anywho, in documenting the scientist's story, the 3 men are taken on a chilling ride that will have you engrossed.I found the acting in the Wicksboro Incident to be marvelous. I kept waiting for it to fall apart or get hokey, but it never did. The actors are highly believable. If they wouldn't have been, this style of story would have crumbled in seconds into a joke.The second half is quite scary, especially the ending 10 minutes. There is one particular scene where something happens to the scientist that nearly threw me from my chair. I can't say that any scene from a horror movie shocked me more that that one. I never saw the fright coming, and the way it happened and was filmed was brilliant!All in all I highly recommend the Wicksboro Incident to fans of sci-fi, and to those who want a good fright. But please, give it a chance. It isn't a long movie and starts out slow. It starts slow so you can't see the chills that are coming. Don't watch it if you aren't willing to watch it all; you will be disappointed.I have now added the Wicksboro Incident to my Amazon Wishlist and will be buying it shortly. It is a wonderful, well-acted and directed addition to any sci-fi fan's collection. Move over Blair Witch. This is one of my favorites this year.Total Score (out of 100) = 9547 (out of 50).
