Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[12, 17]","If Star Wars and The Neverending Story had a garage sale and Disney was the first one to arrive for the good prices, that would only half explain the problem with this film.  I have never seen more disrespect for a book than I did with Disney's release of A Wrinkle in Time.  From the horrible, cheap-ish acting to the video game styled CGI, there was nothing in this film that appealed to me or would for anyone that was a fan of L'Engle's work.  There were moments when I swore that I was watching a poorly made After-School special about the loss of a family member, but reality caught hold and I was forced back into A Wrinkle in Time.Where to begin ... well, how about the acting?  Did they pull these child stars out of the dollar bin, or are they generally this horrible? Katie Stuart (Meg) seemed like she didn't even care about being in the film.  There was no emotion behind any of her character's lines leading us down a path of apathy towards any big moments in this film.  She was our leader, she was the one that was supposed to bring us up in arms about the events that were happening, instead she just spoke the lines given to her and stepped where she was supposed to.  No originality, no excitement, no enjoyment could be seen behind Stuart's eyes and ultimately it hurt this film.  Well, it was one of the bigger elements that hurt this film. Gregory Smith needs to stay on the WB for a bit longer because it is his best work to date.  I am a fan of Everwood and I don't understand how he could be so good in that, yet horrible in this.  It was as if he was simply looking for the paycheck to buy that new car he can finally drive.  It was ... for lack of a better word ... pathetic. I was also a bit disappointed with the choice of the kid from The Ring as Charles Wallace. He couldn't embody the character at all, and it became obvious that the only reason he was involved with this film was because he was in a blockbuster film.  He was not Charles Wallace, just an actor trying to get paid.  The same can be said for everyone else in the film that really didn't put any emotion or emphasis on their characters.  The motions were done, but it just felt that nobody cared.  For those that have read the book, the characters will probably be a big hurdle to overcome.  The parents of these children looked like they had Meg at the ripe age of 16.  They truly did not embody the vision that L'Engle gave us in the written word.How about that cheap CGI?  Disney forte, so to speak, is animation.  It is what they built their foundation on, so why was this CGI so horribly bad?  I couldn't tell if I was playing a video game or watching a film half of the time.  When the children arrive to the planet engrossed with darkness, I couldn't help but laugh.  Nothing seemed real, nobody cared, and the film was quickly going down the toilet.  I was literally rolling around on the ground when Alfre Woodard transformed into the horsy creature.  It was visually horrible to look at and made me happy that my imagination could create a better representation in my mind when I read the book.  Also, what were the Wookies doing on the planet that somewhat resembled Hoth?  Frustration was just boiling out of me by this time.  I felt cheated and hurt all at the same time.The story didn't help my frustration either.  I felt I had walked into my local butcher shop and watched director John Kent Harrison go at it with a butcher's knife.  He showed no sympathy to the original story by L'Engle and, to be honest, didn't even seem to care.  Why do films like this get made in Hollywood?  It only hurts the story because if I had seen this film first, I would not have wanted to go back and read the book.  L'Engle should not have allowed this travesty to occur, but as everyone showed in this film, sometimes you gotta get paid.Normally, I would go further into why I disliked this film, but I am just so angry that there is no point.  This was the worst film that I have seen this year and do not suggest it for anyone that enjoyed the written work of L'Engle.  She was creative, original, and developed some amazing imagery for young adults to grow into.  I wish I could say the same about this film, but (as you can see) I cannot.  There was nothing redeemable in this film at all.  Not even the ending credits were any good.  No money was spent on them.  I still cannot grasp the understanding on how a multi-billion dollar company like Disney can create films like this without giving it the proper budget.  It was a disgrace and I shan't see it again!Grade: * out of *****",1,If Star Wars and The Neverending Story had a yard sale......,1109289600,"02 25, 2005",2005,4586,"['Star', 'Wars', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'had', 'garage', 'sale', 'Disney', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'arrive', 'good', 'prices', 'would', 'only', 'half', 'explain', 'problem', 'film', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'more', 'disrespect', 'book', 'did', 'Disney', 'release', 'A', 'Wrinkle', 'Time', 'horrible', 'cheap-ish', 'acting', 'video', 'game', 'styled', 'CGI', 'was', 'nothing', 'film', 'appealed', 'would', 'anyone', 'was', 'fan', ""L'Engle"", 'work', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'swore', 'was', 'watching', 'poorly', 'made', 'After-School', 'special', 'loss', 'family', 'member', 'reality', 'caught', 'hold', 'was', 'forced', 'back', 'A', 'Wrinkle', 'Time.Where', 'begin', 'well', 'how', 'acting', 'Did', 'pull', 'child', 'dollar', 'bin', 'are', 'generally', 'horrible', 'Katie', 'Stuart', 'Meg', 'seemed', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'being', 'film', 'was', 'emotion', 'character', 'lines', 'leading', 'down', 'path', 'apathy', 'towards', 'big', 'moments', 'film', 'was', 'leader', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'supposed', 'bring', 'up', 'arms', 'events', 'were', 'happening', 'instead', 'just', 'spoke', 'lines', 'given', 'stepped', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'originality', 'excitement', 'enjoyment', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Stuart', 'eyes', 'ultimately', 'film', 'Well', 'was', 'one', 'bigger', 'elements', 'hurt', 'film', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'stay', 'WB', 'bit', 'longer', 'best', 'work', 'date', 'am', 'fan', 'Everwood', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'yet', 'horrible', 'was', 'was', 'simply', 'looking', 'paycheck', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'can', 'finally', 'drive', 'was', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'pathetic', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'choice', 'kid', 'Ring', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'could', ""n't"", 'embody', 'character', 'became', 'obvious', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'involved', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'just', 'actor', 'trying', 'get', 'paid', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'emotion', 'emphasis', 'characters', 'motions', 'were', 'done', 'just', 'felt', 'nobody', 'cared', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'characters', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'big', 'hurdle', 'overcome', 'parents', 'children', 'looked', 'had', 'Meg', 'ripe', 'age', '16', 'truly', 'did', 'not', 'embody', 'vision', ""L'Engle"", 'gave', 'written', 'word.How', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'Disney', 'forte', 'so', 'speak', 'animation', 'what', 'built', 'foundation', 'so', 'why', 'was', 'CGI', 'so', 'horribly', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'was', 'playing', 'video', 'game', 'watching', 'film', 'half', 'time', 'When', 'children', 'arrive', 'planet', 'engrossed', 'darkness', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'real', 'nobody', 'cared', 'film', 'was', 'quickly', 'going', 'down', 'toilet', 'was', 'literally', 'rolling', 'around', 'ground', 'when', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'transformed', 'horsy', 'creature', 'was', 'visually', 'horrible', 'look', 'made', 'happy', 'imagination', 'could', 'create', 'better', 'representation', 'mind', 'when', 'read', 'book', 'Also', 'what', 'were', 'Wookies', 'doing', 'planet', 'somewhat', 'resembled', 'Hoth', 'Frustration', 'was', 'just', 'boiling', 'time', 'felt', 'cheated', 'hurt', 'same', 'time.The', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'frustration', 'felt', 'had', 'walked', 'local', 'butcher', 'shop', 'watched', 'director', 'John', 'Kent', 'Harrison', 'go', 'butcher', 'knife', 'showed', 'sympathy', 'original', 'story', ""L'Engle"", 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'care', 'Why', 'do', 'films', 'like', 'get', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'only', 'story', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'first', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'wanted', 'go', 'back', 'read', 'book', ""L'Engle"", 'should', 'not', 'have', 'allowed', 'travesty', 'occur', 'everyone', 'showed', 'film', 'sometimes', 'got', 'ta', 'get', 'paid.Normally', 'would', 'go', 'further', 'why', 'disliked', 'film', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'angry', 'point', 'was', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'enjoyed', 'written', 'work', ""L'Engle"", 'was', 'creative', 'original', 'developed', 'amazing', 'imagery', 'young', 'adults', 'grow', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'can', 'not', 'was', 'nothing', 'redeemable', 'film', 'Not', 'even', 'ending', 'credits', 'were', 'good', 'money', 'was', 'spent', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'grasp', 'understanding', 'how', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'company', 'Disney', 'can', 'create', 'films', 'giving', 'proper', 'budget', 'was', 'disgrace', 'sha', ""n't"", 'see', 'again', 'Grade', '*', '*****']",A Wrinkle in Time VHS

847085,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0002VEX5K,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is one of those stories that really does work for both children and adults. It is based on Madeleine L'Engle's marvelous book, which is supposedly for children, but is one of those to share.The Murry family is -- to put it mildly -- rather unusual. Father Jack and mother Dana are both well-respected scientists. The oldest child, Meg, is the narrator of the story. It may take some time to get to know her special qualities, but even at the start we know she is smart. The twins Sandy and Dennys are a constant source of irritation, but really the only thing strange about them is their being twins. But the youngest, Charles Wallace, is amazingly smart, possibly with Asperger's Syndrome, and quite adorable.When the story opens, Jack has been missing for a year, and nobody seems to know where he went or why. It turns out, however, that Charles Wallace's three magical friends, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, know where he is, and are willing to help Meg and Charles Wallace (He's never just called ""Charles,"" but always ""Charles Wallace."") to go to him. Calvin O'Keefe, a teenage boy who may or may not be Meg's boyfriend, is brought along for the ride.And what a ride! The visual effects are spectacular, but the only explanation for the mode of travel is the subject in the title: They travel across a wrinkle in time, or more precisely the space/time continuum, and arrive in an extraordinary place that is dominated by ""It"" in much the same way Orwell's 1984 was dominated by Big Brother.Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace are there to find and rescue Meg's father, but in the process Charles Wallace gets seduced by It. How his rescue is affected is a whole new ball game.The book is unique, and this movie is also unique. They are two different ways of telling a story, and I kept trying to avoid evaluating the differences.

Now I see why Roy Disney made a website called Save Disney. Oddly enough, Disney did a great job on a lesser-known L'Engle book, Ring of Endless Light, which will hopefully make it out on DVD.Who doesn't think L'Engle's time quintet (there are five books, even if it's sold as a quartet: An Acceptable Time is the fifth) deserves Harry Potter treatment? Who doesn't think these books would be great on the big screen? Supposedly, properties float around the various studios in Hollywood until someone picks them up. Look at the really bad books that get made into films. Here's one of the best properties you could find, just lying dormant.Here's an idea; let's save Disney and (re)make it as Walt intended: a company with drive and passion, heart and soul that cares what it puts out and doesn't pass off schlock like Desperate Housewives through its ABC network or the endless man-hating shows on Deathtime. How could anyone be proud of making shows like that? What a waste of talent and money!

847103,A1B83BCGRJRZJ4,B0002VEX5K,Kenneth Hand,"[10, 13]","Warning: This is a frank, honest review of the movie, and it's only my opinion, but I've seen the movie twice and have read the book many times, and therefore I believe myself qualified to give it.After receiving 'A Wrinkle in Time' as a Christmas present, I eagerly popped it in my DVD player, ready for the ride of my life.  The book, by Madeleine L'Engle, is one of my favourites, and I was interested to see how Disney made the movie.While some scenes reach a very high level of entertainment, for a Disney B-movie, and you can tell that a lot of thought was put into many of the characters, the movie, in my opinion, fails to reach the heights that L'Engle intended and achieved with the book.  It's hard to tell what Disney's target audience is supposed to be -- while trying to attain the intellectual, thought-provoking storyline of the book, the movie attempts to appeal to both infantile and teenage audiences.David Dorfman as Charles Wallace is not a miscast, but he definitely misinterprets the character development of CW.  Indeed he doesn't do much throughout the whole movie, except look like the loser everyone tries to make him out as being.  Katie Stuart makes for a far too boring Meg, and I felt no real reason to cheer her on when she tries to win her brother back from The Man with Red Eyes.  Gregory Smith is a handsome Calvin O'Keefe, and does give the movie a hot dynamic that it lacks with Meg and her boring family alone, but after the second viewing, it becomes apparent that his voice never changes at all in the movie.  His declarations, exclamations and questions all sound the same to me.  Meg's twin brothers are miscasts: they are the different, ""common"" boys that L'Engle makes them out as being, but Disney makes them too young and immature to matter at all.The witches, however, work together to save the movie from being a total bore, even if they are further examples of the movie straying too far from the book.  A black Mrs. Whatsit?  A little out there, but it works!  Kate Nelligan as Mrs. Which is also a great choice.  Aunt Beast is also well done.  The Happy Medium is not at all how I imagined him -- he's supposed to be neither a man nor a woman, but just looks like a very feminine man -- but his character is not entirely a flop.  The Man with Red Eyes is, however, totally unconvincing.The first half of the movie, in which Meg and her family, and Calvin are introduced, is a bit of a snooze.  I'm not convinced that Meg is anything but ordinary, even though everyone's constantly saying that she's different.  It's almost as if the movie is trying to give hope to mediocre girls that they might appeal to guys like Gregory Smith.  (I know, that's a very, very mean thing to say, but probably true.)  If you've read the book, you can easily fast forward to the second half.  Camazotz isn't at all like the Camazotz in the book.  Instead of being an almost complete mirror of Earth, the people are even more spaced out than in the book and the atmosphere is red. (?)  The ending is decent (spoiler here), but Disney does not employ the L'Engle technique of the witches leaving without saying where they're going or if they'll ever come back.  Boo!I give this movie two stars because Disney tries, and Gregory Smith and the witches kept me watching.  Some scenes, such as the phony Meg's family scene that is shown to her on Camazotz, were well done and should be praised.  All in all, however, don't get your hopes up.  It's a rental.  Do, however, buy the book.",2,Sure to disappoint -- stick with the book,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,3512,"['Warning', 'frank', 'honest', 'review', 'movie', 'only', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'many', 'times', 'therefore', 'believe', 'qualified', 'give', 'it.After', 'receiving', 'Wrinkle', 'Time', 'Christmas', 'present', 'eagerly', 'popped', 'DVD', 'player', 'ready', 'ride', 'life', 'book', 'Madeleine', ""L'Engle"", 'one', 'favourites', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'Disney', 'made', 'movie.While', 'scenes', 'reach', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'entertainment', 'Disney', 'B-movie', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'thought', 'was', 'put', 'many', 'characters', 'movie', 'opinion', 'reach', 'heights', ""L'Engle"", 'intended', 'achieved', 'book', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'Disney', 'target', 'audience', 'supposed', 'be', 'trying', 'attain', 'intellectual', 'thought-provoking', 'storyline', 'book', 'movie', 'appeal', 'infantile', 'teenage', 'audiences.David', 'Dorfman', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'not', 'miscast', 'definitely', 'character', 'development', 'CW', 'Indeed', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'whole', 'movie', 'look', 'loser', 'everyone', 'make', 'out', 'being', 'Katie', 'Stuart', 'far', 'too', 'boring', 'Meg', 'felt', 'real', 'reason', 'cheer', 'when', 'win', 'brother', 'back', 'Man', 'Red', 'Eyes', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'handsome', 'Calvin', ""O'Keefe"", 'give', 'movie', 'hot', 'dynamic', 'Meg', 'boring', 'family', 'alone', 'second', 'viewing', 'apparent', 'voice', 'never', 'changes', 'movie', 'declarations', 'exclamations', 'questions', 'sound', 'same', 'Meg', 'twin', 'brothers', 'are', 'miscasts', 'are', 'different', 'common', ""L'Engle"", 'out', 'being', 'Disney', 'too', 'young', 'immature', 'matter', 'all.The', 'witches', 'however', 'work', 'together', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'total', 'bore', 'even', 'are', 'further', 'examples', 'movie', 'straying', 'too', 'far', 'book', 'black', 'Mrs.', 'Whatsit', 'little', 'there', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Mrs', 'Which', 'also', 'great', 'choice', 'Aunt', 'Beast', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'Happy', 'Medium', 'not', 'how', 'imagined', 'supposed', 'be', 'man', 'woman', 'just', 'very', 'feminine', 'man', 'character', 'not', 'entirely', 'flop', 'Man', 'Red', 'Eyes', 'however', 'totally', 'unconvincing.The', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Meg', 'family', 'Calvin', 'are', 'introduced', 'bit', 'snooze', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'Meg', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'even', 'everyone', 'constantly', 'saying', 'different', 'almost', 'movie', 'trying', 'give', 'hope', 'mediocre', 'girls', 'might', 'appeal', 'guys', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'know', 'very', 'very', 'mean', 'thing', 'say', 'probably', 'true', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'can', 'easily', 'fast', 'forward', 'second', 'half', 'Camazotz', ""n't"", 'Camazotz', 'book', 'Instead', 'being', 'almost', 'complete', 'mirror', 'Earth', 'people', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'spaced', 'out', 'book', 'atmosphere', 'red', 'ending', 'decent', 'spoiler', 'here', 'Disney', 'not', 'employ', ""L'Engle"", 'technique', 'witches', 'leaving', 'saying', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'come', 'back', 'Boo', 'give', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'Disney', 'tries', 'Gregory', 'Smith', 'witches', 'kept', 'watching', 'scenes', 'such', 'phony', 'Meg', 'family', 'scene', 'shown', 'Camazotz', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'should', 'be', 'praised', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'rental', 'Do', 'however', 'buy', 'book']",A Wrinkle in Time VHS

""A Wrinkle In Time"" was the beginning of one of the best fantasies for older children and, yes, even adults.  This film based on the first book in the fantasy is okay, but I feel as if the entire series was cheated when compared to such juggernauts as Potter and Lemony. I enjoy the Potter films and books as much as anyone, but I think that more attention should have been paid to ""A Wrinkle In Time.""  Not only was it the first ""big"" book that I ever read, it was also the first fantasy that I had ever read.  I fell in love with it immediately and it encouraged me to read even more books.  A couple of years ago, at the age of twenty-six, I read ""Wrinkle"" again, because I loved it so much.Alfre Woodard is great as Ms. Whatsit, and Who and Which are also excellent.  The little boy chosen to play Charles Wallace was fantastic, he looked really creepy when It took over him.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, but that isn't where my complaint lies.My complaint is with the production.  When the children travel throught the tesseract, fly on Ms. Whatsit, meet the Happy Medium, etc., the production looks like something off of Sci-Fi channel.  Also, something is lost in the translation to the screen, and the story comes off slow, plodding, and uninteresting at times.  Money is always an issue with films of this sort, but you'd think that Disney would have plunked down a little more dough on this picture.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  Instead, the actors are forced to drudge along through the story in an attempt to make the best of what they've been given.Hopefully someone will come along and give this brilliant story the proper treatment it deserves.  It triggered the imaginations of many generations, and it should be given the same care and respect as Potter, Snickett, and all of the others that I'm sure will come along.Three stars go to the actors in this film.  They do a brilliant job given the fact that they had so little to work with. I recommend this one with reservations.  It's fun to finally see some great childhood heroes on the screen, but I just wish they would have been treated better.

I've been curious for a long time about it, so I bought it and watched it with my family. Instead of my husband and I taking our kids to the movies, we bought this hoping it would be good.I was curious about what other members thought of this film and after watching the movie I'm saddened to see that those who put it down and called it awful missed the points. It's not about crystal balls or witchcraft, though don't even get me started because The Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic and has those same features!! This story had a heart. It was about acceptance of one's self, about not assuming things about others, about love for your family, about judgement, about believing children come into this world with gifts we as grown ups take for granted.I saw my kids in this movie. I grew a little more as a person watching it.I am perhaps someone who is different from others. When I go to see a movie, I don't just go and see if for entertainment.

I quickly ordered the DVD and even had it rushed to me.  I watched it as soon as I got the DVD, but I was a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if I had not read the book, I would have thought the movie was better than it was, but that was not the case.  It was tragic to see what they had done to Mrs. Who, my favorite character of the novel.  In the novel she was constantly quoting people, and in various languages, but in the movie was an afterthought and just seemed odd.  The Happy Medium seemed like a characture of a homosexual male and not the ambiguous being that it was in the novel.  I felt that they could have done a great deal more with the over 2 hours they had in the movie.  I could list a million more things that they should have done better, but that would be pointless.

I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. The characters, with all their virtues and flaws, are near and dear to my heart.

So when I found this in video form I was thrilled. My sister exactly told me that it was pretty good, I must mention here that she hasn't read the book in over five years.I had high hopes when the movie began with a cool scene with the star giving its life for the war against Black Thing. And that's a good place to start, the Black Thing was more often then not, a purple thing or a blurring thing. There was nothing very scary about the ""thing."" In the book it creeped you out totally, in the movie you're like, ""What? What was that? Why is it evil?""The second thing that really bothered me was the group of boys that attacked Charles Wallace and Meg were smaller then she was? In the book, they were bigger and heavier then she was. There was no bickering and name calling between the siblings, there was a strong sense of loyalty and love.Charles Wallace was okay, but I tended to like him better as the creepy evil child he was with it. I know that sounds bad, but you have to consider that instead of being the sweet child he was in the book, he was scornful and nasty as all the others. Blah.In the book, Calvin is just as important to the plotline as Meg and Charles Wallace. However they buttered his part as well, they merely made him a jock. He did nothing in the movie but make some funny comments. They took a noble and interesting character and made him into a blah cardboard cutout like all the other actors.Meg, in the movie, was a sulky self centered brat that I hated throughout the movie. All she cared about was herself and her problems. This is one of the times that I wish that, when the character complains about how much they hate themselves, their friends would say, ""I hate you too."" At the end when she should be delivering the lines, ""I love you Charles Wallace! You are the light of my life, and the treasure of my heart! I love you, my baby brother who always cares for me, I love you!""She's half heartedly says, ""I love you and I want to always be there for you."" All I can say is lame, lame, lame! Blah!Central, central intelligence is a joke and we all know it. I like good CGI, but this stuff was laughable! You could plainly see all the fake stuff, it was like they sat down and said, ""Let's see just how badly we can butcher this movie and still get people to watch it!""Mrs. Whatsit was okay, but when she transformed into the creature and turned out to be a horse with a human head and peacock feathers? I nearly died from laughing and crying hysterically. I mean, did they honestly look at that thing and say, ""Yeah, looks like the majestic creature described in the book.""Mrs. Who was the best and most faithful of all the ladies, to the book. She was quoting left and right and had a sweet endearing look about her. However I have major problems with her quoting Albus Dumlbedore like he was a real person. I am not a fan of Harry Potter and never will be and I find her quoting him beside someone like Gothre to be repulsive.Mrs. Which was a fabrication from beginning to end. In the book she rarely appeared and when she did it was in the grab of a traditional witch, for the laughs. But she was stern and loveable at the same time. However this woman was choking in a hideous golden gown and spurting hooky clich&eacute;s left and right. I hated her.I also found the Happy Medium to be very stupid, a sweet slightly ridiculous figure in the book, this was a fat man in a turban laughing at other peoples problems! Oh, I forgot to mention the fact that He/She claims to be neither man or woman therefore making gender meaningless. I wish they had killed him off.In the reading of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" there is a heavy spiritual sense about it. Biblical figures are mentioned as warrior in the fight against the darkness, not artist and humanists. The bible is quoted in the singing of the beast on Uriel and not just something vague about, ""Joy.""Why is it that whenever Hollywood takes a strongly christen story that they turn it into something humanist about believing in our own human powers? I think everyone should have a health amount of self confidence, but not to the sappy and dangerous level they pump it out in this film. They very thing they were saying you should have is what made Charles Wallace fall into the trap of it, in the first place.The man with red eyes was not supposed to speak outwardly but mentally. He was silently menacing. In this film he was overly emotional and silly, albeit, he did have some killer lines. But they combined his character and that of IT. Instead of the pulsing brain on a dais they had a huge pulsing CGI...thing. It meant nothing to us and all my family thought it was a bunch of worms.Nowhere is the awesome scene where they reject it using nursery rhymes, or the quoting of the Declaration of Independence. This was a powerful scene they cut completely, and they make the beasts on Ixchel big furry wookie like creatures out of the Twilight zone. Stupid!All in all this film should have been given another name because this is not the story of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" I would never encourage anyone to buy this film, either would I encourage anyone to watch, even for free.",2,"Shoot me, just shoot me!",1118707200,"06 14, 2005",2005,5337,"['Crap', 'crap', 'crap', 'crap', 'Aside', 'fact', 'sucked', 'whole', 'way', 'movie', 'am', 'huge', 'fan',

If you've never read the books, you might come out liking this movie, but if you have, prepare to be wildly disappointed.Meg and her brother Charles Wallace are the odd children of the Murry family.  They're just a little too different and after the disappearance of their father, Meg becomes more than a little angry.  But things change when an odd woman shows up at their door and tells them both that they're needed.  Along with Calvin O'Keefe, a new friend, they are swept away to a different planet where they learn an evil being is keeping their father captive.  They have to try to save them without being taken under control by the Evil IT who is there.Characters:Katie Stuart: Meg MurryGregory Smith: Calvin O'KeefeDavid Dorfman: Charles Wallace MurryChris Potter: Dr. Jack MurryKyle Secor: Man with Red EyesSean Cullen: Happy MediumSarah Jane Redmond: Dana MurryKate Nelligan: Mrs. WhichAlison Elliott: Mrs. WhoAlfre Woodard: Mrs. WhatsitMunro and Thomas Chambers: The TwinsI'm sure the actors tried their best but the vast majority were downright awful.  I don't know if it was the way they played the characters or just the way the script was written, but they greatly deviated from the characters in the book.  Mrs. Which especially wasn't very good and didn't seem the wise all-knowing being that she is in the book.  Mrs. Who too had some trouble in that regard as well.  In fact, of the three Mrs. W's, only Mrs. Whatsit seemed believable and likable to me, although she was a bit strange.  Charles Wallace was the greatest disappointment.  He was a little brat in this movie and was completely unlike his character in the book.  They made him less spectacular than he really is.  Meg and Calvin were ok and were the closest to their characters in the book, but even they weren't the beloved characters I grew up reading about.The plot greatly deviates from the book as well with all sorts of random things happening.  While the basic premise is the same, it was definitely ""spiced up"" for the theatre and I think that it loses some of its charm because of this. I do have to say that I was kind of surprised that, for the year this movie was made, the graphics were rather terrible.  They were kind of blotchy for special effects and I think they could have made some of the more fantastical elements more realistic than they did.  The creature Mrs. Whatsit turns into, especially, could have been much improved on.  The music as well was pretty cheesy and didn't really fit with the movie as a whole.Definitely not what I was expecting and rather a let down.  I think I'll stick to the books and avoid any sequels that come out for this movie.Review by M.

847116,AEXGGB9P0MOTN,B0002VEX5K,"Sarah Hadley ""I'm a graduate student and Engl...","[10, 12]","It's a funny contradiction, watching movies based on books you loved as a kid. On the one hand, I'm always fascinated - sometimes, morbidly so - to see how the story's been adapted, what's been changed, and how it's otherwise been adapted for the visual experience. On the other hand, I always know that even the best of adaptations is probably going to leave me feeling a little bit flat. A fine example of this is Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" a film I certainly enjoy on its own merits, but don't consider a particularly nice adaptation of the book. And ""Alice"" is a simple book - at least, when compared to ""A Wrinkle in Time."" How many other kids' books hinge on particle physics?Flash-forward forty-one years from its original publication, and Disney has finally prepared a TV miniseries of the much-loved classic. Hit the forward button a couple more, and I'm watching it on DVD with a rather significant amount of trepidation.The verdict? It's not too bad. Not out-and-out fantastic, but not too bad.The interesting thing is that they seem to have tried, as much as possible, to respect the book. The plot is not particularly different, and sometimes that's an outright flaw - there are sections toward the end where you simply won't understand everything that's happening unless you've read the book. On the other hand, though, Disney apparently cut it from a two-part miniseries to a two-hour movie, and only restored part of that material for the DVD release (which runs 128 minutes - a miniseries, surely, would've been around 180 or 200, allowing for commercials). It's possible, even likely, that some such explanations were lost in the editing room. But more on this later.Aside from the limits of the length, however, the script is remarkably keen at keeping what needs to be kept and ditching the rest. Sadly, that's very much undone by a bombardment of truly poor CGI effects. The children land on an alien planet? The planet, the dust, even the buildings are CGI. One character magically transforms into a centaur? The centaur is completely, and obviously, cheap CGI. Someone needs to run down a series of linked corridors? CGI, CGI, CGI. I played more realistic video games in the late '90s. All of the money seems to have gone toward the actual ""tesseract"" effect, which while important, did not need to be so grandiose, especially at the expense of all else. I mean, for cryin' out loud, when there's an overhead shot of trees, the trees should look -real.-And the special effects are my main beef with the TV movie, because in most other respects, it's at least acceptably successful. The three child/teen leads are all quite well cast, even David Dorfman as Charles Wallace, who is required to play the most precocious 6-year-old ever. Most of the adults do quite well, too, with the exception of Alfre Woodard, who is simply channeling overcooked ham. It's hard to play alien eccentrics, after all - and it's only at the very end that she finally realizes she doesn't need to emphasize every other word that comes out of her purple lips. Perhaps she took a hint from Sean Cullen as the Happy Medium, who utterly ruins his one scene. Fake laughter is not actually funny, nor is it endearing. Alison Elliott's rather dotty Mrs Who actually grew on me, though, as did Kate Nelligan's somewhat overly-sympathetic (even overly-corporeal!) Mrs Which. They're not quite what I read in the book at age seven, but they're not light years away, either.You may get the impression from these paragraphs that I'm not sure whether I liked the film or not. That's essentially true. It's not as bad as I feared, but it's still kids'-TV-movie territory, and it can be a little hard to take at times. I think I fall just barely on the side of liking it, though. I checked it out for free at the library, after all, and I had a fair idea of what I was getting into. I'm just happy the core of the story, bad CGI or otherwise, is very much intact.The DVD actually has a couple of nice features. The first is a series of five deleted scenes, almost all of which take the story much, much farther away from the source novel than anything in the finished film, by rather needlessly giving background to several characters and the Tesseract project. One is a particularly noxious ""training"" sequence where the three ladies try to get the children to understand their weaknesses, making room for some completely unnecessary references to Harry Potter and Star Trek. Together, these deleted scenes are almost twenty minutes long, and they left me wondering if I'd really like that original cut after all. (Maybe not!) More pleasant is a 10-minute interview with the original author, Madeline L'Engle, who very succinctly describes why she wrote the book and the message she was trying to get across. If you bother to watch the film, you should definitely check her out.So, do I recommend this? Reservedly. I've seen much poorer adaptations in my time, and I'd sooner watch it again than a fair few shinier, more expensive ones that make travesties of their source novels. If you've read and enjoyed ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" and are ready for a few small differences, a rental or a library loan of this DVD should fill an evening pleasantly enough.",3,It's...actually pretty

Believe this or else we will tell you over, and over, and over, and etc.  Gosh!Plot (Mild Spoilers):The movie starts out with a missing dad and a grieving family that has a fading hope that Jack will return to them.  Meg though feels betrayed and deserted.  She has very low self-esteem and feels like she is a freak.  And her six year old brother Charles Wallace is so beat-up by those around him that he will speak to no one except family.OK, so how does this dysfunctional, depressing family actually be chosen as a vanguard to save the Universe from the Darkness??  Well, let me tell ya!The story moves forward to some magical beings who are imaginably old and wise, yet don't know the basic concepts of courage and confront.  This seems very unrealistic to me - and they even squabble amongst themselves if this is the right course of action - of the billions on Earth, why choose three kids?They feel Charles Wallace is some kind of chosen one.  Unfortunately he gets entangled with the bad guys on another planet.  But this is all eventually fixed and Meg, spouting words of Love, somehow chases the Darkness away!Bottom Line:Some methods of disbelieve must be employed when watching a fantasy film but even here the film was way too saccharine sweet for my taste, with the message of the film being too overpowering to be effective - and the beings Whatsit, Whosit and Which, despite being immensely old, would really be this ineffective?  And Charles Wallace, all played up during most of the movie, would actually not be all that effective?According to Wiki, even the author of the original novel didn't like it!Even so, recommended only for the very young who may enjoy the film's special effects and colorful story.Better:The Wrinkle in Time Quintet Boxed Set (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, An Acceptable Time)",2,"Not That Impressed with ""IT""!",1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,2226,"['been', 'so', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'thought', ""'d"", 'least', 'check', '2004', 'film', 'found', 'was', 'originally', 'television', 'film', 'Disney.First', 'Impressions', 'film', 'was', 'overly', 'saccharine', 'ideas', 'honor', 'love', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'are', 'valid', 'true', 'values', 'living', 'movie', 'really', 'hit', 'head', 'brick', 'Believe', 'else', 'will', 'tell', 'etc', 'Gosh', 'Plot', 'Mild', 'Spoilers', 'movie', 'out', 'missing', 'dad', 'grieving', 'family', 'fading', 'hope', 'Jack', 'will', 'return', 'Meg', 'feels', 'betrayed', 'deserted', 'very', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'feels', 'freak', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'so', 'beat-up', 'will', 'speak', 'one', 'family.OK', 'how', 'dysfunctional', 'depressing', 'family', 'actually', 'be', 'chosen', 'vanguard', 'save', 'Universe', 'Darkness', 'Well', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'story', 'forward', 'magical', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'imaginably', 'old', 'wise', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'basic', 'concepts', 'courage', 'confront', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'squabble', 'amongst', 'right', 'course', 'action', 'billions', 'Earth', 'why', 'choose', 'three', 'kids', 'feel', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'kind', 'chosen', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'entangled', 'bad', 'guys', 'planet', 'eventually', 'fixed', 'Meg', 'spouting', 'words', 'Love', 'somehow', 'Darkness', 'away', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'methods', 'disbelieve', 'must', 'be', 'employed', 'when', 'watching', 'fantasy', 'film', 'even', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'saccharine', 'sweet', 'taste', 'message', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'overpowering', 'be', 'effective', 'beings', 'Whatsit', 'Whosit', 'Which', 'being', 'immensely', 'old', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'ineffective', 'Charles', 'Wallace', 'played', 'up', 'most', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'not', 'be', 'effective', 'According', 'Wiki', 'even', 'author', 'original', 'novel', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Even', 'so', 'recommended', 'only', 'very', 'young', 'who', 'may', 'enjoy', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'colorful', 'story.Better', 'Wrinkle', 'Time', 'Quintet', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'A', 'Wrinkle', 'Time', 'A', 'Wind', 'Door', 'A', 'Swiftly', 'Tilting', 'Planet', 'Many', 'Waters', 'Acceptable', 'Time']",A Wrinkle in Time VHS

This movie is based on an old novel, one that many of us read in school. While Disney tried to adapt it to the big screen, they failed miserably. This movie was way too long and confusing for kids. Even I had a hard time sitting through it. Katie Stuart gives a tremendous performance as Meg, but sadly it was the only note worthy performance. Gregory Smith, one of my favorite young actors, was quite bland, the three ladies were just ridiculously Disneyfied, and David Dorfman, while adorable, was very repetitive.

Kids save the day (and their father) against overwhelming odds, but with help from some very odd characters. The kids, Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace, offer plenty for anyone who's ever felt outcast for being different from the others. That includes a big message about being yourself despite evrything.The target audience appears to be the tweenagers for who L'Engle's books were originally intended, so adults might find parts unsophisticated. The darkened land of blind conformity reinforces L'Engle's message, though. Being yourself is important - look what happens when everyone tries to be everyone else. The anti-authority message won't work for all kinds of parents, but I think that, in moderation, it's a healthy habit of mind.Effects really make this movie, even if the actual nature of a mathematical tesseract gets lost. That helps, because some of the plot elements and especially some of the acting lack in subtlety. The child actors did well, though, including a remarkable performance in portraying six year old Charles Wallace.I read L'Engle's books, but that was when this 1963 book was relatively new so I've mostly forgotten them. For better or worse, this review addresses the WiT movie by itself, without regard to L'Engle's classic. Any book so beloved inevitably disappoints some who love it most - it can never live up to the world that such a reader has already imagined.

I bought it used, and am glad I did because now I own it and didn't have to pay the full price for it.The book was, of course, much better, and that may be why I was slightly disappointed. The visual effects were kind of... well... they kind of sucked. The flying horse thing was ridiculous and I think it was the worst part of the film.The Happy Medium was pretty bad too. I did like the three Mrs. W's, they did a surprisingly good job. Meg and Calivin did awesome as well. Charles Wallace, however, was kind of creepy at times and for the most part came off as a weird kid, even around his family. In the book, he seemed more cute and just quiet, not at all weird.Instead of just skipping over some details like most movies based on books do, they also added things that didn't belong. I really wanted to see them make the stop on the 2-dimensonal planet, and was disappointed t osee that part missing.The Tesseract could have been better, too. They explained it well in the movie, but I had imagined it a lot different. The way they showed it in the movie just looked like someone was on shrooms or drugs.
