1652942,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00D2CYU2W,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Stephen Soderbergh's BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (TV-2013) stars Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorsen, his companion and  lover from 1977 to '81. Also with Scott Bakula, Dan Aykroyd, Rob Lowe, Paul Reiser and Debbie Reynolds (looking ancient as Liberace's mom).It had to be a tough film for Douglas and Damon for they are all over each other, not just with long kisses but caresses and other intimate bedroom behavior. At some point you forget you're watching two men and see them only as a deeply committed couple.This HBO movie based on Thorson's memoirs was a challenging project for all involved. The recreation of Liberace's glamorous stage act and excessive personal life seems true, and Thorsen isn't spared the depiction of his own weaknesses, drug dependency chief among them.Wladziu Liberace was a child prodigy who came to prominence in an era when gays were deeply closeted. He remained publicly in denial all his life. In a two decade span Lee was the highest paid entertainer in the world, which allowed for a personal extravagance that would be the envy of any royal. Considering the man's voracious sexual appetite and need for variety, that he lived to age 67, finally succumbing to AIDS complications in 1987, seems in hindsight a miracle.Like any biopic, ""Candelabra"" tinkers with the facts, but not terribly so. Its biggest flaw is in casting 43-year-old Matt Damon to portray Thorsen, who was only 17 when he got involved with Lee and 21 when they split. As for Michael Douglas, he looks marvelous as the human peacock this brilliant pianist was. The makeup, wigs and outlandish costuming take a decade or two off him. You can sense Douglas is having the time of his life with this role.How much you want to know about Liberace's private life may determine if BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is a film you'd care to see. There's definitely off-putting moments, and some that could negatively affect your memories of him, but if the so-called ""lifestyles of the rich and famous"" is a passion, then you won't be disappointed with the story told here.",4,"Liberace: ""All of a sudden we're sounding like a gay Lucy and Ricky.""",1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,2076,"['Stephen', 'Soderbergh', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'CANDELABRA', 'TV-2013', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Liberace', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Scott', 'Thorsen', 'companion', 'lover', '1977', ""'81"", 'Also', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Paul', 'Reiser', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'looking', 'ancient', 'Liberace', 'mom', '.It', 'had', 'be', 'tough', 'film', 'Douglas', 'Damon', 'are', 'other', 'not', 'just', 'long', 'kisses', 'caresses', 'other', 'intimate', 'bedroom', 'behavior', 'point', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'two', 'men', 'see', 'only', 'deeply', 'committed', 'couple.This', 'HBO', 'movie', 'based', 'Thorson', 'memoirs', 'was', 'challenging', 'project', 'involved', 'recreation', 'Liberace', 'glamorous', 'stage', 'act', 'excessive', 'personal', 'life', 'true', 'Thorsen', ""n't"", 'spared', 'depiction', 'own', 'weaknesses', 'drug', 'dependency', 'chief', 'them.Wladziu', 'Liberace', 'was', 'child', 'prodigy', 'who', 'came', 'prominence', 'era', 'when', 'gays', 'were', 'deeply', 'closeted', 'remained', 'publicly', 'denial', 'life', 'two', 'decade', 'span', 'Lee', 'was', 'highest', 'paid', 'entertainer', 'world', 'allowed', 'personal', 'extravagance', 'would', 'be', 'envy', 'royal', 'Considering', 'man', 'voracious', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'need', 'variety', 'lived', 'age', '67', 'finally', 'succumbing', 'AIDS', 'complications', '1987', 'hindsight', 'miracle.Like', 'biopic', 'Candelabra', 'tinkers', 'facts', 'not', 'terribly', 'so', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'casting', '43-year-old', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'portray', 'Thorsen', 'who', 'was', 'only', '17', 'when', 'got', 'involved', 'Lee', '21', 'when', 'split', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'marvelous', 'human', 'peacock', 'brilliant', 'pianist', 'was', 'makeup', 'wigs', 'outlandish', 'costuming', 'take', 'decade', 'two', 'can', 'sense', 'Douglas', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'role.How', 'much', 'want', 'know', 'Liberace', 'private', 'life', 'may', 'determine', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'CANDELABRA', 'film', ""'d"", 'care', 'see', 'definitely', 'off-putting', 'moments', 'could', 'negatively', 'affect', 'memories', 'so-called', 'lifestyles', 'rich', 'famous', 'passion', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'story', 'told', 'here']",N/A
1652943,A29RUNZT2H2GCU,B00D2CYU2W,Ann Sherry,"[0, 1]","Michael Douglas playing Liberace, the lover?  Can't be done, I thought as I began watching this for the first time.  Matt Damon as the lover?  Matt Damon can do anything, I also thought, looking forward more to his performance than Douglas's.I was wrong.  Michael Douglas does a stunning, realistic job of his role of Liberace.  Some say he talked too nasally, but if you look at a clip of the real Liberace, Liberace did talk that way.  Douglas was miles away from his usual high-class corporate roles, and he was brilliant.The sex scenes and situations were far too much for children. But they were necessary for the film. If held back, viewers would not quite realize what their relationship really was and make it difficult to understand their roles.Matt Damon was okay as Scott, Liberace's lover who was suddenly ousted out of &#34;Lee&#34;s life. But the role was almost a throw-away role. It was one anyone could play, and it is suprising Damon took on this rather weak and uninteresting part. It did give the movie star power, tho.Debbie Reynolds is fabulous as &#34;Lee&#34;s (Liberace's) mother!  I didn't know it was her until I had watched it several times and then read it online.  She was one of Lee's friends in real life.Another low-key throw-away role that anyone could have played, Liberace's agent, was surprisingly done by Dan Ackroyd. A top favorite as is Damon, I was surprised Ackroyd took this role.  I thought he was some unknown actor, until I read somewhere that it was Ackroyd. Well, in any role, it is good to see him and Matt Damon perform. They did both perform well, for the parts they were given.This is the first time I've seen a glance into Liberace's real life, and I enjoyed it.  The costumes, the story, the script - and the performances!  It looked like M Douglas was really playing the piano as Liberace.I think this film was a surprise hit, and HBO deserves the &#34;What Guts!&#34; Award for taking a chance on it.

It must also be said that Dan Aykroyd does a great job playing Liberace&#8217;s business manager who is the person who solves the problems that Liberace&#8217;s narcissism and libido creates.

It might be easy to watch Douglas play Liberace and think that he is overplaying the role, however Douglas is such a skillful actor that this thought does not enter the mind of the viewer.

I read an article about this prior to seeing it and wish I'd been more surprised by the unfolding events. This a the kind of story that is better to come into blind, without reading plot-spoiling articles or reviews. So if you are thinking about watching his film, do.The A-team performances of Micheal Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as Scott, Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's controlling mother, and Rob Lowe as the vain, doctor (painfully over-done with plastic surgery) are flawless. Dan Ackroyd as Liberace's avaricious agent is excellent as well. The two main performances are riveting - Oscar performance worthy, though with the HBO distribution I guess this film will not be eligible for an Oscar. Douglas unwaveringly nails Liberace's voice and mannerism, and the film seamlessly intersperses footage of the real Liberace as a young man; Damon once again shows his incredible range as an actor playing the polar opposite of the tough guy, bad boy, heart throb role. The makeup in this movie is simply amazing. Micheal Douglas is transformed into the spitting image of Liberace and various characters age, gain and lose mass, and go through other appearance-changing life issues.Scott is a naive and talent animal trainer and aspiring vet who meets Liberace through a friend and starts to treat Liberace's poodle. As a child, Scott had been through many families in the foster system and as a young man is seeking a acceptance, love, and a father figure. He quickly becomes drawn into Liberace's flamboyant public life and bizarre private life; after the elderly poodle dies Scott even takes on the dog's nickname.

His Liberace is so in love with his self-created myth that he cannot see beyond it; to say that he is massively self-centered is no understatement.

Matt Damon is equally wonderful as Liberace's much younger lover Scott Thorson; at first rather bemused that the celebrity should take such an interest in him, and then falling hopelessly and yet eternally in love.

Michael Douglas does not deserve an award; he didn't even try to alter his obnoxious voice to sound like Liberace, or even act like Liberace; Douglas can't act anyway. Matt Damon  deserves an award for putting up with Douglas. The movie lacks professionalism, even the picture quality is bad. Everyone knows the simple story; it's been on TV several times in many guises. This version is boring: it lacks pizzazz and the requisite camp. The end is absurd. Items in ""Features"" should have been in the movie. Rob Lowe, as the plastic surgeon, looked good; maybe he worked on himself. The music is well recorded. Douglas looks as if he is really playing the piano (if that is important to you); besides the antique autos it's the only realistic thing in the movie. The budget must have been blown on costumes and sets (including Zsa Zsa Gabor's house) with no money left for a decent production. Pehaps gay movies need gay directors. ""La Cage Aux Folles"" would have been a flop if these incompetents were in charge. It would never have become a great musical either. This turkey is dead in the barnyard.

1652986,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00D2CYU2W,Grady Harp,"[37, 41]","The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6-year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.The cast is very solid. Matt Damon embodies the role of Scott Thorson well - a young apparently bisexual man who has been tossed from foster home to foster home while he does odd jobs (he is 17 years old) tending to animals. In a gay bar he meets Bob Black (Scott Bakula) who takes Scott to a Liberace concert (his first exposure to the megastar) and to meet Liberace afterwards. There is tension in the air with Liberace's current paramour and performing partner Billy Leatherwood (Cheyenne Jackson) and we soon discover that Liberace (impeccably played by Michael Douglas) only keeps his `boys' around for a while before his manager Seymour (Dan Ackroyd) gets rid of them with a check. Liberace and Scott find common ground in being needy people without confidants and soon Scott becomes Liberace's next lover. All goes swimmingly until Liberace sees himself on a TV show and sees how aged he has become. He engages plastic surgeon Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe in a very fine performance) to perform a youthful facelift and at the same time convinces Scott to undergo plastic surgery to make him look more like Liberace! And here begins the downfall: Dr. Startz prescribes pain meds to Scott who becomes addicted and moves into heavier drugs, and his behavior, along with Liberace's need for a `new face' (Boyd Holbrook), signals the breakup of a 6 year relationship - the best relationship either has ever had.There are excellent cameos by Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother, Paul Reiser as Scott's lawyer, and others, but the star of the film is in all ways the flamboyant showman Liberace in some of the most interesting outfits ever created. The on screen relationship between Michael Douglas and Matt Damon is entirely credible and neither of these fine actors has a problem with being sexually physical without seeming to be a parody. There are moments that could have been cut, but as Liberace says, less is more and more is wonderful.

Although, the truth be told, This movie bears a certain stylistic similarity to MOMMIE DEAREST.Liberace was a ""larger-than-life"" entertainer and, whether you liked his work or not, he was difficult to ignore.The same thing might be said of Joan Crawford, although, I must say, I liked her films far better than I liked anything Liberace ever did. I was a Joan Crawford Fan. I am not a fan of Liberace.Joan was the reason people went to see MOMMIE DEAREST. Nobody gave a damn about Christina Crawford. Few people would even recognize Christina if she were walking along the street. Everybody wanted to see Joan Crawford, warts and all.Liberace is the reason people will want to see BEHIND THE CANDELABRA. Nobody gives a damn about Scott Thorson. I barely remember what Scott looked like from photos in the tabloids. Tall, blond and completely unmemorable.This made Matt Damon's work the less difficult of the two portrayals. There is no memory of a real life person with whom to draw a comparison.Lastly, like MOMMIE DEAREST, we are only getting one side of the story. Scott's side.As I remember, Liberace would become even more famous because of his flamboyant nature than he would be because of his piano playing. In the fifties, he came across as ""precious and peculiar"". By the eighties, he had become a Bird of Paradise and a Las Vegas Institution. If you went to Las Vegas, you had to go see Liberace. Everyone knew that Liberace was Gay no matter how much he denied it.In this movie, Liberace is played to perfection by Michael Douglas in what is undoubtedly the finest portrayal of his long career. Douglas deserves to win an Emmy for it. Liberace is portrayed as a Predatory Old Chicken Hawk who buys his way through a succession of lovers young enough to be his grandchildren and gets away with it simply because his money and fame allow him to do so. His main interest in life is himself. Sadly, in real life, that is largely the rule among celebrities, it is not the exception.I know less of Scott Thorson. Reading between the lines, we get a young hustler with little talent for anything else and an unhealthy appetite for illegal drugs.It's not a pretty picture and the sexual interaction between the two men is strong stuff for television. I'm surprised that Douglas and Damon could be persuaded to play these roles as written.

1652992,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00D2CYU2W,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Let's remain short on this one.Liberace is a myth in show biz. A gay piano performer who all his life hid his orientation under a fake heterosexual liaison that had no real material density at all. All his life he ran after younger twinks to feel his youth back again, with a few implants. That was before the blue pill of Viagra. But one day he tried a new one who was probably slightly better than the others, more special. Description from the urban Dictionary: ""An attractive, boyish-looking, young gay man. The stereotypical twink is 18-22, slender with little or no body hair, often blonde, dresses in club wear even at 10:00 AM, and is not particularly intelligent. A twink is the gay answer to the blonde bimbo cheerleader.""That Scott accepted to have his face reshaped into a semblance of Liberace's. He accepted all kinds of crazy sex but he refused to be taken from behind, some old fear of the dark I guess, since he was let's say an orphan who had been raised in foster care and who found the perfect foster family to support him. In other words he was not ""a blonde bimbo cheerleader.3He was attracted by the light, the gold, the gems and jewels, the white uniform though it looked more like a sentimental sweet Halloween costume to impress old ladies, or old queens, white fur coat included. He resisted nothing except that visitor at the back entrance. Pathetic! I guess then Liberace was impressed and as long as the resistance was active he went on trying. He even tried to compensate the frustration by trying to adopt Scott as his proper son, or was it a con from a con-artist? But that kind of theatrical sublimation did not work at all. So time had come to get rid of the gnat. And Liberace did in one swat.Till death them parted! And just before that sad AIDS moment he called Scott to come and take his last words, watch his last tears, shed some crocodile tears out of confusion and frustration. We are not told what the will gave him.The film ends up with the cardiac arrest caused by a heart failure, turned into the sequels of the AIDS virus by some coroner's office.The film tries to end the show, that must go on anyway, with a love song, in fact a long poem recited by Liberace to his own piano music and that song is a marvelous love song indeed, the love song of an older man to a younger man - though it could be to a younger woman all the same. The age difference that Liberace could not deal with made him over sexual whereas there comes an age when a man can love with love and not lust with sex. Liberace never found that epiphany that would have redeemed him from total fright in front of his own age. It is so good to love someone who is younger, a lot younger than you even, just for the love of him or her, for the heat and the emotion you feel in your heart that is not invaded by some hormonal and endocrinal greed.There comes an age when the wolf in man can finally go to sleep and let the platonic emotions of the loving phoenix come out of the shadow of the receding night that will bring the illumination of the last call. To be reborn instantly from its own empathetic ashes. To be reborn instantly in the lasting memory of the loved one's responsive soul.A beautiful film about a time when love was not accepted in the narrow circles of the straight fundamentalism of fairy bashing.But let me give you the final sentimental, slightly over sugary love song that sounds like a Hallmark Valentine's.Why do I love you?I love you not only for what you are,But for what I am when I'm with youI love you not only for what you have made of yourself,But for what you are making of me.I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me,And for accepting the possibilities of the good in me.Why do I love you?I love you for closing your eyes to the discords in me,And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening.I love you for helping me to construct of my lifeNot a tavern but a templeI love you because you have done so much to make me happy.You have done it without a word, without a touch, without a signYou have done it by just being yourselfPerhaps after all, that is what love meansAnd that is why I love you.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,No one can prevent love from being passionate,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,4195,"['Let', 'remain', 'short', 'one.Liberace',

I found him mesmerizing. Over the years, I certainly learned to see him in a different light, but loved his talents none the less. He always seemed genuinely nice, and shared his on stage persona with a wink. When the Scott Thorson story hit the rag sheets, it came as no surprise.Behind the Candelabra, there was another story to be told. The depth of Liberache's public denial seems sad and desperate. It was a reflection of the times in which he rose to fame. Perhaps it is the telling of his story in another era that makes it so fascinating, like going through a looking glass to his personal wonderland.I found this film to be so compelling that I watched it several times in one week. The acting was so great, I felt as though Douglas was channeling Liberache rather than impersonating him. When I read Debbie Reynolds name in the credits, I thought that I must have missed her scene. How could I have not seen her? Only after the first viewing did I realize that it was she who portrayed Liberache's mother!There is so much to admire in this film. The makeup, the sets, the costumes -- all perfection. However, what stays with you is the idea that no matter who the protagonists were, this is a love story -- a love story gone wrong, to be sure, but a love story none the less.Behind the Candelabra is a film that will stay with you for quite some time. It sent me on a journey of research for more information about Liberache's life. Surely, it wasn't easy to live compelled to hide your true nature, yet always be in the public eye.I can't help but wonder what Liberache, himself, would have to say about Behind The Candelabra.",5,A Genuine Love Story!,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,1763,"['was', 'overwhelmed', 'aspect', 'film', 'remember', 'Liberache', 'old', 'days', 'television', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'found', 'mesmerizing', 'years', 'certainly', 'learned', 'see', 'different', 'light', 'loved', 'talents', 'none', 'less', 'always', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'shared', 'stage', 'persona', 'wink', 'When', 'Scott', 'Thorson', 'story', 'hit', 'rag', 'sheets', 'came', 'surprise.Behind', 'Candelabra', 'was', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'depth', 'Liberache', 'public', 'denial', 'sad', 'desperate', 'was', 'reflection', 'times', 'rose', 'fame', 'Perhaps', 'telling', 'story', 'era', 'so', 'fascinating', 'going', 'looking', 'glass', 'personal', 'wonderland.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'compelling', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'week', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'felt', 'Douglas', 'was', 'channeling', 'Liberache', 'rather', 'impersonating', 'When', 'read', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'name', 'credits', 'thought', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'scene', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Only', 'first', 'viewing', 'did', 'realize', 'was', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Liberache', 'mother', 'so', 'much', 'admire', 'film', 'makeup', 'sets', 'costumes', 'perfection', 'However', 'what', 'idea', 'matter', 'who', 'protagonists', 'were', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'story', 'gone', 'wrong', 'be', 'sure', 'love', 'story', 'none', 'less.Behind', 'Candelabra', 'film', 'will', 'stay', 'quite', 'time', 'sent', 'journey', 'research', 'more', 'information', 'Liberache', 'life', 'Surely', 'was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'live', 'compelled', 'hide', 'true', 'nature', 'always', 'be', 'public', 'eye.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'Liberache', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Candelabra']",N/A

Michael Douglas is not one of my favorite actors but he totally nails this part.  I also think he was very brave to take on a part that shows his age in some unflattering ways.  Matt Damon was barely recognizable and looked 20 years younger than he is - I think this was a result of his stellar acting along with a masterful makeup team.  I didn't think this was a happy movie but it was well done.

I would never willingly see anything with either of those two actors in it. So why on earth did I watch this? I don't know, but I enjoyed it!Neither of them is really a good actor. They obviously thought (and millions seem to agree) that they were breaking brave new ground and showcasing their immense talents in these roles, but they were just playing the same characters they (and all other Hollywood A-listers) always play: themselves, with various amounts of makeup and choreography and voice coaching to vary the monotony enough to satisfy the mindless masses who pay to see them on screen.The best I can say about Damon is that most of the time he's easy to ignore in this movie, at least when he has clothes on; his body is so weird that it hurts my eyes, but there's nearly always something interesting to look away at. His barely-suppressed homophobia (Damon's, not the character's) comes shining through in the interview on the DVD, and it comes in handy when he gets to repulse a request Douglas makes in one of their many sex scenes. That's only one of many reasons Damon has always given me the creeps: homosexuality gives HIM the creeps.But Douglas... Ahhhh! He's nothing like Liberace, but I had a ball watching him just being little Michael Douglas speaking with a funny voice, moving in a funny way, and sporting killer makeup and killer duds. There's something fascinating about him despite my intense dislike of him as both a person and an actor.Enjoying this movie won't turn me into a fan, but it was fun for the couple of hours it lasted. Not great fun, but fun enough not to turn off, which is quite a feat for a big-budget Hollywood movie.One complaint: it was stupid to have Douglas recite rather than sing ""The Impossible Dream"" in his last scene. Liberace was a competent singer, and since Douglas evidently can't sing it was dumb not to have a singer dub his voice then. It could have been done seamlessly so the audience never suspected it wasn't him singing. His plodding recitation of the song's silly lyrics ruined what might otherwise have been a fabulous scene.

This movie paints an interesting portrait of his personal life which is that he was gay and did not hide that fact except professionally and to the world.

1653008,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D2CYU2W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[94, 100]","Even though I was quite young, I can still remember the infamous palimony suit filed by Scott Thorson against Liberace in 1982. The story created national headlines and scandal at a time when homosexuality wasn't discussed as openly as it might be today. Despite his flamboyant stage persona, Liberace was NOT out of the closet and did not acknowledge the intimacy of this relationship. That's part of what fueled the attention, further adding to the controversy and media scrutiny. I won't discuss the outcome for those new to Thorson's memoir ""Behind The Candelabra,"" which is the source material for this prestigious HBO project. Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) teamed with Oscar nominated screenwriter Richard La Gravenese (The Fisher King) to adapt Thorson's book. Headlined by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, ""Behind the Candelabra"" was certainly one of the most anticipated TV movies of the year. As you might expect, though, this is told from Thorson's perspective and is quite sympathetic to his viewpoint. Let's just say that we do not hear about his drug fueled involvement as a prime witness in the Wonderland murders (also in the early eighties) or his contemporary incarceration for suspected burglary and identity theft charges (he was recently bailed out of jail by the owner of Bunny Ranch brothel at the end of May). Even the movie's postscript just says that Thorson is currently residing in Reno when, in fact, he was in jail on the film's premiere.That said, though, HBO's ""Behind the Candelabra"" is a handsomely produced and exquisitely acted piece of entertainment. By his very nature, Liberace was (and always will be) a fascinating and improbable success story. This expose peels back the curtain on a life of opulence, excess and eccentricity and is played as an extravagant tragedy: Boy meets legend, boy is seduced by wealth, boy is ruined by experience. Matt Damon plays Thorson with an eager optimism and an incredible naivete. A troubled kid shuttled through the foster system, Thorson is beguiled when introduced to Liberace. Liberace (Michael Douglas) is enchanted by this innocence and lack of pretension. A self-proclaimed bisexual, Thorson quickly shacks up with Liberace and the two have a blissful honeymoon period. But as the novelty wears off of the relationship, things get decidedly more weird. Thorson gets progressively more unstable by the explicit demands of the increasingly controlling Liberace. Their confused relationship wavers between the territories of lovers, employee and boss, father and son. I won't reveal any of the specific plot points, but this evolving dynamic fuels the heart of ""Behind the Candelabra.""The exemplary cast includes Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mom, Scott Bakula as the guy who introduces our central pair, Dan Aykroyd as Liberace's protective manager, Rob Lowe as an extremely unorthodox doctor, and Cheyenne Jackson as a spurned lover. Each has nice moments. Reynolds doesn't have much to do, but scores in one pivotal scene. Aykroyd is particularly convincing and Lowe is inspired (and his makeup deserves an Emmy). But this is all really about Douglas and Damon. When I had heard that Douglas was cast, I didn't instantly see the connection. But he gets the mannerisms and speech patterns down well. Alternately hilarious and frightening, it's a completely unique performance that will undoubtedly be recognized as the award season rolls around. And Damon is also excellent as the emotional centerpiece of the story. His progression is well played and utterly believable.I think that the technical merits of ""Behind the Candelabra"" also deserve special mention. The stage shows are recreated with precision. The make-up, costumes, and sets are all particularly noteworthy. The movie really does bring this experience to life from a visual perspective. And there is plenty of music as well, just what you'd want from a Liberace story! As with any biography, this isn't the definitive word on Liberace. It may, however, be as close as we're likely to get. Even to his death, Liberace was still not acknowledging a certain lifestyle. As the movie closes on an infamous Liberace performance, it is both chilling and sad. Whether you are a Liberace fan or not, this is a fascinating (if one-sided) look at the life of a one-of-a-kind entertainer.

The two stars are very good, although Douglas' Liberace wasn't quite as likable as I'd wished.  The two make a dynamic duo and really hold one's attention.  Rob Lowe has a funny role as a plastic surgeon with one too-many bad eye jobs.  Debbie Reynolds has a few lines as Lee's mother. The sets and costumes are lavish and the whole movie glitters with a Vegas aura.The movie is based on Scott Thorson's memoir, so, naturally, he comes out as the hero and victim while Liberace is the slimy predator.  Much of the graphic storyline had me cringing in shock, but, still, I watched.

That is real life, big deal they showed two men being intimate, this was far from light porn, as some people viewed it. (Again, they are entitled to their opinion). I believe some people were being melodramatic in their reviews, that is putting it mildly. This is 2014 not the dark ages, however they will forever show violent movies and that is accepted. I like Micheal Douglas, and yes it was a different role for him.  I believe that he did as well as he could. That was a challenge, if you want to look at him as Liberace you can, or if you want to look him as only Micheal Douglas you can, one only sees what they want to see. I saw him as Liberace, as I was focusing on the movie. That is correct this movie did not focus much on his professional life but his personal life, that the was purpose of the movie taken from Scott's perspective. Yes, it would nice to hear two sides, but that will not happen, I would like to now get the book, since I have seen the movie, even though I did watch Liberace, my grandmother did.The other actor Matt Dameon he did a job well done, although I have not watched many things he did. Rob Lowe, surprised me in looks in the part of the doctor, he looks better clean cut. I'm surprised that he had that small of a role. Since he carried full movies as a lead actor before. It's to bad that many people have to mask what they truly are, because it's threat to them, and has no bearing on what they are doing in public, and they not hurting anybody.  Going backs sexually explicit movies have always been a taboo, but violent movies are accepted, as I said. They are rated R and the sexually explicit movies were always rated X. They are or were always played in a separate movie house. I do not go to the movie house so I know the set up. I watch everything on DVD. So society, helped with that. Personally, I do not like writing reviews, because some people get so vile, and they attack people and issues, instead of the product, as everybody as a right to their own opinion.

But after numerous viewings, its Matt Damon that steals the show! I was so entertained. I had a dinner party and showed it to my guests and we all loved it. It deserved to win the Emmy......and sadly that Matt didn't take one home also!How Liberace ever fooled anyone that he wasn't a total queen, is beyond me. But sure enough, old ladies from Ohio just thought he was ""an entertainer"".Despite how sad and pathetic Scott Thorson's life has become, I think ""Behind the Candlelabra"" was an honest, even loving tribute to that old queen's legacy.Matt Damon though is nothing short of amazing, as is, of course, Michael Douglas. They both just faded into their roles. I've always liked Matt Damon, but, have a new found respect for him. Though Michael Douglas gave an award winning performance, I haven't become the fan that I have of Matt Damon. His portrayal of an increasingly flamboyant man just leaves me speechless. While Michael Douglas immediately embraced the campiness.....it isn't the character study portrayal that Matt Damon's astounding on point evolution into a high camp gay guy.Noteworthy supporting performances by Debbie Reynolds (another one who fades into her role), Rob Lowe and Dan Akroyd fully rounds out yet another great HBO movie. (I really wished Diana Ross would have pursued HBO for ""The Josephine Baker Story"" because Lynn Whitfield's performance is totally the way I envisioned Diana in that lost dream. My Comcast cable bill is ridiculous because of HBO original programming).How anyone could give this film 1 star behooves me. And sure, while the love-sex scenes between Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall was a turn on, Michael and Matt's is completely the opposite.....almost nauseating especially when he reveals Liberace's wig line.

This behind-the-scenes peek at his love life is like a weak cup of luke-warm tea.The main glitch is Michael Douglas' portrayal of Liberace.  He's a straight guy acting like a flaming queen but never quite gets there.  It's hard to ignore his deep, reverberating baritone voice and boney frame; when Liberace had a clear falsetto and a body that fluctuated three clothes sizes at any given time, mostly husky.  The way some of the lines are delivered is really off, and some of the lines miss the point.  In an early scene,  Douglas prances across the stage talking to the audience and says ""Well go ahead, stare all you like.  I mean, you paid for it!"".  It sounded like he was talking about tickets to the show.  Liberace himself would tease his audience about how they paid for all his jewelry and costumes, letting them look, touch and marvel at the baubles.  He clearly came across as meaning that his fans made him rich and very comfortable indeed.I think the purpose of this film could have been something extremely touching, delightful and at times, painful to watch.  But it seemed more of an exercise in showing two famous straight actors portraying gay characters in a long term relationship.  Matt Damon pulled it off and had some sterling moments.  I'd pay money to see the outtakes to this film.I had seen this movie on HBO and bought the DVD to see what extras were included.  Hopefully, there would be behind the scenes and biographical information on Liberace.  There is one short extra on the making of the film.  It is mainly the actors telling what it was like to be in the movie.  There was nothing telling about how it felt to connect with their characters.Kudos to Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's mother.  Who would have known if her name wasn't in the credits?  Such an amazing transformation and portrayal.I would have to guess Scott's book gives more intimate graphic details about his relationship with Mr. Showmanship.

I was totally surprised by the candor of this film, e.g., how early movie stars or public figures went to great lengths to enhance themselves, like Marilyn Menroe's plastic surgery revelation.  Liberace was also into plastic surgery and enhancements during his later years. I knew some older male stars went to great lengths, before Viagra, to show themselves as verile.  I can honestly say, my jaw dropped a couple of times in disbelief during this movie at some of the revelations about Liberace; some moments were truly laughable.  Matt Damon's performance as Scott Thorson, (Damon's personal persona), isn't diminished by this role.  In fact, there is an almost like innocense in Damon's performace as Liberace comes to reveal himself to the young Scott Thorson.  You feel the trust between the two, but I didn't get what was loving between the two. Librace was a user of young men.  Behind the Candelabra will probably become a cult film for Liberace.

1653035,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B00D2CYU2W,PJR,"[21, 31]","Disgusting -- aside from making money, this film serves no purpose. This reminds me of tabloids that understand that sex sells. People are still cashing in on gossip about Liberace long after he is dead.Confession: I don't like lurid celebrity exploitation films in general, and in particular I thought Mike Douglas just could not pull off the role of Liberace and that this was an insult to Liberace's fans and to his memory.My grandmother was a great fan of Liberace and so when I was young I watched him a fair amount with her. Frankly I thought he was a joke and that his audience appeal was a big joke. Yet I did enjoy the music. And I have to say that I understand his personal appeal, even though it did not work for me. He came across as sincerely warm, gentle, playful, loving, and in a certain way he was his own man. For example he was not afraid to love and be devoted to his mother openly at a time when men were much more reserved about their feelings than they are today. He came across as an unashamed mama's boy -- and that was brave in those days, as were his glitzy costumes etc. The campy glitz and glamor were largely props or embellishments and what carried his fame was his personality.Douglas' performance conveyed none of that to me. There was almost always something cold and calculating behind the eyes even when he was performing. He did not seem like his own man. He seemed like a guy in drag trying too hard to prove something, to be something he was not but wanted to be. He played a gay stereotype more than the Liberace we used to see on television, who came across as a real human being -- though even a kid could see that he was probably gay and had a complicated and unhappy side behind the candelabra.  He seemed to be putting perhaps his best foot forward, and that is what people try to do. Nobody is all good feet. Did that make him a phoney? Not necessarily. Douglas may have worked his butt off to play the role and it was certainly challenging, but that does not mean that his performance worked. it did not for me. It was too much a stereotype except for a few short scenes. Largely because of Douglas' unconvincing performance the film left one with the erroneous impression that Liberace had appeal because of the glitz alone, and not so much because of his warm and loving public persona. This angle would have been enough to ruin the film for me. But there is more.it did not take long for me to suspect that no one knew enough about Liberace's carefully closeted life or personal life in general to cast his character the way that they were doing. They were fleshing out freely their stereotypes of effeminate gays and of celebrity boy-toys. These were Hollywood show-biz easy characterizations, not necessarily the truth about specific human beings. Yes the Hollywood Las Vegas scenes are a mess, but still not everyone can be painted with the same brush. Was this a revelation about Hollywood using the name and superficial image of Liberace or a revelation about the flesh and blood Liberace?  It was only a few minutes into the film that I started wondering what I was watching.I did some googling. The facts were correct according to interviews with Scott Thorson, the boy-toy. Well, maybe and maybe not. Thorson seems terribly unreliable according to several sources, for example a May 10, 2013 New York Times article  [...] ""He's not a bad person,"" said Mr. Pelicone, who has a swirl of brown-blond hair and a cigarette habit. ""He's just twisted and kind of cutthroat.""How much independent verification is there of the material in Thorson's book? Why should anyone care enough about his questionable book to make an expensive film and hire famous actors. It was a lot of work and money for what??? To cash in on lurid gossip about a most awkwardly closeted celebrity.But it is not the alleged facts that bother me as much as the spin that was given to the alleged facts. There can be several ways to present a fact. The plastic surgery matter sticks in my mind. The film left the impression at the moment when the subject came up that Liberace wanted Scott to look like him because of insane vanity. Then later there was the quite vague suggestion that he wanted to be able to pass him off as his son. Thorson has said that this was in fact the motive all along. None of this makes sense to me and this critical fact needs much more interpretation than anyone has given it. If Thorson is telling the truth, how was an unmarried celebrity supposed to have explained a biological son who was then to have been adopted?  Or was this as the film implies an act of insane vanity imposed on Thorson by Liberace? Or is there some secret that we cannot know that it was actually ""twisted"" Thorson who wanted to look like Liberace because he was star struck and wanted to be his sone and look like his mentor? Nothing adds up in the stories we are getting about the plastic surgery.It seems that no one can say much about Liberace and his boy-toy other than that Liberace was a tortured gay celebrity, closeted perhaps to the point of ""paranoia,"" and that he had a dependent close companion who was pretty screwed  up himself, and sometimes they probably did have sex. Scott was perhaps more conflicted about this than Liberace. One has to dig pretty hard to get this out of the film. Though one could argue that it is in there, I feel that it was a clumsy and un-artful exposition at best of a complex creative person and an unfortunate relationship.The actual historical situation could have been explored in much more depth and with much more sensitivity than it was in the film. To me the film just came across as yet more exploitation of the Liberace name -- first his managers and now the film makers and publishers of Thorson's book.Oh. Damon's performance was not bad.And Oh -- the ""making of"" feature on the disc was not bad. But again it was superficial and pandered too much to the sexual aspect, like ""what was it like kissing a man and having your bare butt filmed?""",1,"celebrity sexploitation, and

I wasn't sure that I'd even bother to play it.  I was shocked to see Matt Damon's face on the cover, but I just rolled my eyes some more.  If I had bothered to notice that the film was directed by Steven Soderberg I would have realized that this was something well worth watching.And it was.  As other reviewers have mentioned the film is based on a book by Scott Thorson, one of Liberace's lovers, (some say his favorite) and it covers the four or five years of their relationship.  Scott was just a teenager when he met &#34;Lee&#34; and Lee was in his fifties.  It is told from Thorson's point of view and some object that the &#34;truth&#34; is thereby not served.  I don't know; who can say for sure?  In a way the film is so good that it almost doesn't matter how absolutely &#34;true&#34; it is; it seems almost to transcend mere facts and offer a very deeply moving story about two people.The performances are truly stellar.  Besides Douglas' rendition of the over-the-top performer with a vulnerable side, Matt Damon was truly impressive in the role of Thorson.  I think it might have been a more difficult role to pull off and he did a  splendid job.  All of the supporting cast was first rate.  I loved Rob Lowe's creepy plastic surgeon and Debbie Reynolds was adorable as Liberace's mom.  (Is Debbie ever less than adorable?!  I'd love to see a bio-pic of her!)Special mention must be given to the sexual material.  Soderberg handled this so well!  It could have been an absolute mess in lesser hands but he presented it just right. Obviously  gay love is at the heart of the story and he doesn't skirt the issue but it's never objectionable, at least to my eyes.  Again, special recognition must be given to Douglas and Damon for their courage and professionalism in their perfomances..This is not a comedy but there are certainly some wonderfully humorous aspects.  Matt Damon's costumes as he got more an more into his role as L's boy-friend are really funny.  Of course there are shots of Liberace's amazing costumes and beyond-elaborate homes.  I knew the guy was outrageous but never realized the full extent of it.I think this is a very thoughtful film that gets beyond the surface tabloid aspects of what could have been seen as a sordid relationship and lays bare a whole range of human experience.

His performance ran the gamut from glimpses of a nearly-believable flamboyant gay man to his typical movie character. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas is a very masculine man, and so when he was being every other character he has played, Liberace was nowhere in sight. His steely eyes, calculated line delivery, and even his distinctive (masculine, confident) way of walking popped out constantly, and, for me, he lost all credibility as Liberace. It's possible I am biased since I am a fan of his and have seen all of his movies so I could not possibly be taken in by this performance. Or, I admit, it could be because he has a somewhat limited acting range and has just never left his zone. At any rate, his performance prevented me from really getting into the movie. As for Matt Damon, he slid seamlessly into the Thorson role (with no resemblence to his many other characters), but he is just too old for it and his age showed in some shots.

Even Rob Lowe did a good job and played the Dr. to the Hilt and made it seem real and as baizarre as possible as the Plastic surgeon.  Dan Ackroid made it believable ""not funny"" and can play serious roles like that very well, ( I almost didn't recognize him ?)  I found them all to be very believable and it made me wish I had purchased it new or rented a good one, because mine was worn so thin I could  barely see the any fine detail in the makeup and clothing and performances and costumes. do not buy a rental that should've gone to the trash but was sold instead as being viewable.for far more than a used video movie. There are some scenes however short that are so personal that you wish they'd left them out, but then you wouldn't have the same that are always shown in other movies today, and therefore it really makes it real.  I can just imagine Micheal Douglas and Matt Damo discussing the fact of what the hell, if we're going to do this we're going to do this right, and then bringing the viewing audience an incredible portrayal of that relationship really was, which was that it was real and poigiant at times and funny, and ad, so sad, because it was, a real love for them both and in the end, that was established and then you consider the facts and what a sad thing it was , the reason for their separating.  I loved it, actually after I got over the 1st time I saW it and played it again, and I will be looking for it in a new like condition to see what I missed.

Even with the cast list in hand, I couldn't immediately identify the actors involved in some of the roles, especially Michael Douglas as Liberace. And the brilliance ranges from this larger than life depiction of the man but also to strange details like Rob Lowe's ridiculously sculpted face - the victim of years of his own preferences (and of course skills) for plastic surgery.Couple this with Douglas' amazing performance as the eccentric pianist, and this movie becomes a different kind of spectacle entirely. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor that has played so many gruff, serious characters over the years. And while this movie is also serious, the range of acting demanded by the role certainly goes to show just how impressive Michael Douglas really is. And it didn't feel like he was just some cheap caricature of the man - it felt like an honest attempt to bring the man to life for the purposes of telling this story.The movie is so richly immersed in the time period. This includes the costumes, the dialog references and the many different hair styles. The level of detail invested in making this movie such an immersive experience for viewers is something that deserves honest praise and respect. They could have cut more corners in terms of how the movie could have been put together.I'm still not a Matt Damon fan and he wasn't overly impressive in this movie. He wasn't necessarily that bad either, and that still deserves the respect that he is due. One could surely see the effort he also put into the role in the hopes of making a respectable portrayal of Scott, although at times young naivety felt a bit more like inadvertently emotionless acting.Behind the Candelabra is a bold, surprisingly good movie.

1653049,A6FIAB28IS79,B00D2CYU2W,Samuel Chell,"[0, 1]","Michael Douglas acts--and acts some more--going through lots of hoops to play the Liberace of Scott Thorson's tell-all tale of a jilted, embittered lover.  But in the end the film falls way short of capturing the charm, the allure, the ""campy fun"" of the entertainer-phenomenon that was Liberace--whose games we were ""on to"" yet participated in.  We winked at him because we knew he'd wink right back at us--and with a special twinkle in his eye unmatched by any other performer.Long before Scott Thorson and Las Vegas, Walter Liberace (from Waukesha, WIs.) demonstrated precocious piano chops and exuded an androgynous charm in American households through his weekly television show.  I know that he inspired many mothers (like mine) to take their sons (including this one) to hear him give concerts in ordinary Mid-Western towns like Rockford, Illinois.  His one movie, an innocuous black and white film entitled  ""Sincerely Yours,"" was merely an opportunity to see on the big screen the persona we had witnessed on our tiny Westinghouse TV screens: he had a medium build and a broad face that had a smile that seemed to stretch from one ear to the next, remaining indelibly in place as he spoke.  His voice was all warmth and richness, resonating with the sunny, ingratiating disposition of his on-stage persona.  His ceaseless good humor completed the picture of the ""real Liberace""--a well-mannered, good-looking, playful but talented and charismatic entertainer who could be ""outrageous"" but never ""shocking.""In addition to all of the foregoing Liberace projected a child's innocence and sense of wonder along with a sense of belief in his outsized imagination that enabled us to believe in him.  Regardless of what he wore or did on stage, Liberace managed to fill the sartorial excess and take us along on his aerial flights of fancy.  His ""swan song,"" a marathon 18-shows before family crowds at Radio City Music Hall, was in many respects a more fitting venue for Lee than the casinos of Vegas.A key to the shortcoming of ""Behind the Candelabra"" is the film's final scene--a vision that Matt Damon's Thorson has of a faux-beatific Liberace at the literal height of his glory (as he is lifted skyward by invisible wires). Even at this moment of apotheosis, the Liberace we see, as played by Douglas, is a slightly creepy and pathetic showboat awkwardly outfitted as a drag queen, devoid of personal charm and childish playfulness.  But if we can't sense what it was about Liberace that ""seduced"" all of America (let alone Las Vegas), all we're left with is a mean-spirited  ""Daddy Dearest"" portrait and a blatant morality tale about a young man mistaking wealth and celebrity for love--and paying the price. (Sorry--been there, done that.)The film is sensationalistic, sordid, and not a little grotesque..  So no doubt it was sufficiently entertaining to help boost the ratings at HBO.  On the other hand, it certainly trashes the memory of Liberace.  How about a little more respect for this tax-paying all-American ""original"" who helped make Las Vegas what it is today?",2,Matt Damon plays Scott Thorson well--but where's Liberace?,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3080,"['Michael', 'Douglas', 'more', 'going', 'lots', 'hoops', 'play', 'Liberace', 'Scott', 'Thorson', 'tell-all', 'tale', 'jilted', 'embittered', 'lover', 'end', 'film', 'way', 'short', 'capturing', 'charm', 'allure', 'campy', 'fun', 'entertainer-phenomenon', 'was', 'Liberace', 'games', 'were', 'yet', 'participated', 'winked', 'knew', ""'d"", 'wink', 'right', 'back', 'special', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'unmatched', 'other', 'performer.Long', 'Scott', 'Thorson', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Walter', 'Liberace', 'Waukesha', 'WIs.', 'demonstrated', 'precocious', 'piano', 'chops', 'exuded', 'androgynous', 'charm', 'American', 'households', 'weekly', 'television', 'show', 'know', 'inspired', 'many', 'mothers', 'mine', 'take', 'sons', 'including', 'one', 'hear', 'give', 'concerts', 'ordinary', 'Mid-Western', 'towns', 'Rockford', 'Illinois', 'one', 'movie', 'innocuous', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'entitled', 'Sincerely', 'Yours', 'was', 'merely', 'opportunity', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'persona', 'had', 'witnessed', 'tiny', 'Westinghouse', 'TV', 'screens', 'had', 'medium', 'build', 'broad', 'face', 'had', 'smile', 'seemed', 'stretch', 'one', 'ear', 'next', 'remaining', 'indelibly', 'place', 'spoke', 'voice', 'was', 'warmth', 'richness', 'resonating', 'sunny', 'ingratiating', 'disposition', 'on-stage', 'persona', 'ceaseless', 'good', 'humor', 'completed', 'picture', 'real', 'Liberace', 'well-mannered', 'good-looking', 'playful', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'entertainer', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'outrageous', 'never', 'shocking', 'addition', 'foregoing', 'Liberace', 'projected', 'child', 'innocence', 'sense', 'wonder', 'sense', 'belief', 'outsized', 'imagination', 'enabled', 'believe', 'Regardless', 'what', 'wore', 'did', 'stage', 'Liberace', 'managed', 'fill', 'sartorial', 'excess', 'take', 'along', 'aerial', 'flights', 'fancy', 'swan', 'song', 'marathon', '18-shows', 'family', 'crowds', 'Radio', 'City', 'Music', 'Hall', 'was', 'many', 'respects', 'more', 'fitting', 'venue', 'Lee', 'casinos', 'Vegas.A', 'key', 'shortcoming', 'Candelabra', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'vision', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Thorson', 'faux-beatific', 'Liberace', 'literal', 'height', 'glory', 'lifted', 'skyward', 'invisible', 'wires', 'Even', 'moment', 'apotheosis', 'Liberace', 'see', 'played', 'Douglas', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'pathetic', 'showboat', 'awkwardly', 'outfitted', 'drag', 'queen', 'devoid', 'personal', 'charm', 'childish', 'playfulness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'Liberace', 'seduced', 'America', 'let', 'alone', 'Las', 'Vegas', ""'re"", 'left', 'mean-spirited', 'Daddy', 'Dearest', 'portrait', 'blatant', 'morality', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'mistaking', 'wealth', 'celebrity', 'love', 'paying', 'price', 'Sorry', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'film', 'sensationalistic', 'sordid', 'not', 'little', 'grotesque..', 'doubt', 'was', 'sufficiently', 'entertaining', 'help', 'boost', 'ratings', 'HBO', 'other', 'hand', 'certainly', 'memory', 'Liberace', 'How', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'tax-paying', 'all-American', 'original', 'who', 'helped', 'make', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'what', 'today']",N/A

1653055,A338A4G5UZXCLA,B00D2CYU2W,SMR,"[1, 1]","I rented ""Behind the Candelabra"" with a lot of reservations. Specifically, I thought the story would be excessively embellished and I wasn't sure Michael Douglas could play Liberace realistically.Happy to report I was wrong on all counts!This is an excellent film--the story is engrossing! It's based off of Scott Thorson's memoir detailing his relationship with Liberace and I think the movie is quite faithful to his account. Douglas gives an outstanding performance as Liberace and Matt Damon is also stellar (despite the fact he's a 43 year old man playing someone 25 years younger.) ""Behind the Candelabra"" is essentially a tragic love story about two lonely individuals each trying to gain fulfillment from the other. Liberace has fame and fortune but no intimacy and Thorson is a young kid looking for both a father figure and a lover. A very nice arrangement that works for awhile but ultimately falls apart as the ending gets ugly! The movie does not pull punches regarding Liberace's kinky promiscuity and Thorson's drug use--two critical issues that lead to the eventual breakup.Ultimately, ""Behind the Candelabra"" is a fascinating story with excellent performances not only from the two leads but also the supporting cast. (Especially Rob Lowe playing the creepy plastic surgeon who operates on Liberace and Thorson). I have only 2 criticisms to point out. The first would be that the film could have included more of Liberace's glitzy stage performances--the lack of performance scenes creates a gap in the story. Performing live was Liberace's passion, yet the movie largely bypasses this essential element.  Secondly, Damon's age neuters the shock value concerning the 40 year plus age difference of these men (when they first met Liberace was 58, Thorson just 17!!)

This is the true story of Scott Thorson (Damon) and his relationship with the one and only Liberace (Douglas). Scott was a normal easy going gay man with a dream to become a vet. That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves. The story is pretty interesting but the real reason to watch is the performance of Michael Douglas. He is great in this and turns himself completely into the character that he makes you forget you are watching a famous actor like Michael Douglas. Overall, a pretty interesting bio-pic that I thought was pretty good but the performance by Douglas is great.

'Behind the Candelabra' focuses on the flamboyant entertainer's private life, particularly on his long-term relationship with his much younger lover, Scott Thorson.Thorson met Liberace through a mutual acquaintance and gave up on his aspirations to become a veterinarian. Instead, in exchange for material (and sometimes) emotional support, Thorson became both Liberace's lover and personal assistant. Later, Liberace entertained ideas that Thorson could become his adopted son (much to Thorsen's chagrin, Liberace never made this official by signing the legal paperwork).Early on in this docudrama, Thorson receives a prophetic warning from one of Liberace's former 'concubines', that he too will be discarded by a younger rival. Along the way, Thorson agrees to undergo plastic surgery at Liberace's behest, who seeks to transform the younger man, into the spitting image of Liberace himself. As a result of the surgery, Thorson eventually becomes addicted to drugs, a situation which Liberace comes to despise.On the other hand, Liberace's penchant for patronizing pornographic shops bothers Thorson, who points out that doing so, could undermine all of Liberace's efforts to remain closeted. The straw that breaks the camel's back is when Liberace tosses Thorson aside for a younger rival, leading to Thorson's big meltdown, where he is unceremoniously escorted from Liberace's mansion, never to return until Liberace's final days.Take away the fact that this is Liberace, the over the top entertainer, known to millions, the domestic imbroglios between this gay couple, are nothing out of the ordinary. Should we really care when Thorson 'loses it' when Liberace dumps him? After all, it was strictly his decision to live an empty life where an elder benefactor provides all his material wants, at the expense of his own self-satisfaction. And does it really matter who's 'on top', during bouts of anal sex?Despite the mundane source material, which highlights the couples' self-destructive behavior, there are moments which suggest that both Liberace and Thorson, were at heart, decent people. Take Liberace doing so much for Thorson upon the death of his foster mother (like hiring the chartered plane); by the same token, Thorson is willing to forgive Liberace, and visits him at his deathbed, just as he's about to die from AIDS.Michael Douglas and Matt Damon do a decent enough job, recreating the roles of the two lovers; but I wonder if it would have been better if two actors who were actually gay, could have brought more to the parts. Debbie Reynolds is great, as well as unrecognizable in the role of Liberace's mother. And director Steven Soderburgh acquits himself well, in presenting this 'warts and all' portrait, of the offbeat showman.'Behind the Candelabra' may not be everyone's cup of tea not because the material is salacious but rather because it's a bit ordinary. That includes Liberace's music, which to my mind represented a combination of the sublime and the ridiculous. In the end, there's enough here to keep one's interest, but given the subject matter, don't expect any real epiphanies.",3,"Decent enough recreation of Liberace's behind-the-scenes, mundane, closeted lifestyle",1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,3296,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'was', 'alive', 'Liberace', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'prevent', 'adoring', 'fans', 'mostly', 'elderly', 'women', 'learning', 'was', 'gay', 'Candelabra', 'focuses', 'flamboyant', 'entertainer', 'private', 'life', 'particularly', 'long-term', 'relationship', 'much', 'younger', 'lover', 'Scott', 'Thorson.Thorson', 'met', 'Liberace', 'mutual', 'acquaintance', 'gave', 'up', 'aspirations', 'become', 'veterinarian', 'Instead', 'exchange', 'material', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'support', 'Thorson', 'became', 'Liberace', 'lover', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Later', 'Liberace', 'entertained', 'ideas', 'Thorson', 'could', 'become', 'adopted', 'son', 'much', 'Thorsen', 'chagrin', 'Liberace', 'never', 'made', 'official', 'signing', 'legal', 'paperwork', '.Early', 'docudrama', 'Thorson', 'prophetic', 'warning', 'one', 'Liberace', 'former', ""'concubines"", 'too', 'will', 'be', 'discarded', 'younger', 'rival', 'way', 'Thorson', 'undergo', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'Liberace', 'behest', 'who', 'transform', 'younger', 'man', 'spitting', 'image', 'Liberace', 'result', 'surgery', 'Thorson', 'eventually', 'addicted', 'drugs', 'situation', 'Liberace', 'despise.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Liberace', 'penchant', 'patronizing', 'pornographic', 'shops', 'bothers', 'Thorson', 'who', 'out', 'doing', 'so', 'could', 'undermine', 'Liberace', 'efforts', 'remain', 'closeted', 'straw', 'camel', 'back', 'when', 'Liberace', 'Thorson', 'aside', 'younger', 'rival', 'leading', 'Thorson', 'big', 'meltdown', 'where', 'unceremoniously', 'escorted', 'Liberace', 'mansion', 'never', 'return', 'Liberace', 'final', 'days.Take', 'away', 'fact', 'Liberace', 'top', 'entertainer', 'known', 'millions', 'domestic', 'imbroglios', 'gay', 'couple', 'are', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'Should', 'really', 'care', 'when', 'Thorson', 'when', 'Liberace', 'was', 'strictly', 'decision', 'live', 'empty', 'life', 'where', 'elder', 'benefactor', 'material', 'expense', 'own', 'self-satisfaction', 'really', 'matter', 'who', 'top', 'bouts', 'anal', 'sex', 'mundane', 'source', 'material', 'couples', 'self-destructive', 'behavior', 'are', 'moments', 'suggest', 'Liberace', 'Thorson', 'were', 'heart', 'decent', 'people', 'Take', 'Liberace', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'Thorson', 'death', 'foster', 'mother', 'hiring', 'chartered', 'plane', 'same', 'token', 'Thorson', 'willing', 'forgive', 'Liberace', 'deathbed', 'just', 'die', 'AIDS.Michael', 'Douglas', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'do', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'recreating', 'roles', 'two', 'lovers', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'gay', 'could', 'have', 'brought', 'more', 'parts', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'unrecognizable', 'role', 'Liberace', 'mother', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderburgh', 'well', 'presenting', ""'warts"", 'portrait', 'offbeat', 'showman', 'Candelabra', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'not', 'material', 'salacious', 'rather', 'bit', 'ordinary', 'Liberace', 'music', 'mind', 'represented', 'combination', 'sublime', 'ridiculous', 'end', 'enough', 'here', 'keep', 'one', 'interest', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'real', 'epiphanies']",N/A
