Anyone who is interested in cinematography should study this film because of some unique choices it makes.  The artistic choices work, but only to a select audience.The movie tells the story of a man who has done EVERYTHING in his life for his wife, but whose life is, well, boring, and yet he doesn't realize what he's missing.  After she leaves him, he slowly begins to wake up.  The first ten minutes or so immerse the viewer in the main character's boring lifestyle.  So if it seems boring at first, it is, and that's the whole point of the first few scenes.  I don't think you can understand (or appreciate) the rest of the film if you don't suffer through the initial boredom with patience.  Yet the boring parts are masterful in their own way.  I've never seen an artistic portrayal of boredom that well done ever (not that I've seen many).Then, eventually, the movie gets going, but at a relaxing pace.  The acting is generally good.  The story could be summed up into maybe three paragraphs (it's not a complicated one), but yet it works.  The camera-work is beautifully done, and the directing immerses you in Collin's inner journey.  One gets to know the friends he makes along the way, those who change his life, and those whose lives he changes.  In the end, as Collin awakens to life, something awakens inside the viewer as well.  Perhaps the greatest definition of artistic beauty I can think of as that which awakens in the viewer what is the subject of the art work.  This film, even at it's slower points, does that very very well.This is an amazing movie, but not one that everyone is likely to have the patience to get through.",5,"Beautifully artistic, but requires patience",1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,1761,"['bought', 'movie', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Kate', 'Rusby', 'fan', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', 'own', 'right', 'Anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'cinematography', 'should', 'study', 'film', 'unique', 'choices', 'artistic', 'choices', 'work', 'only', 'select', 'audience.The', 'movie', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'done', 'EVERYTHING', 'life', 'wife', 'life', 'well', 'boring', 'yet', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'missing', 'slowly', 'wake', 'up', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'main', 'character', 'boring', 'lifestyle', 'So', 'boring', 'first', 'whole', 'point', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'rest', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'initial', 'boredom', 'patience', 'boring', 'parts', 'are', 'masterful', 'own', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'artistic', 'portrayal', 'boredom', 'well', 'done', 'ever', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', '.Then', 'eventually', 'movie', 'going', 'relaxing', 'pace', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'maybe', 'three', 'paragraphs', 'not', 'complicated', 'one', 'yet', 'camera-work', 'beautifully', 'done', 'directing', 'Collin', 'inner', 'journey', 'One', 'know', 'friends', 'way', 'who', 'change', 'life', 'lives', 'end', 'Collin', 'life', 'something', 'awakens', 'viewer', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'definition', 'artistic', 'beauty', 'can', 'think', 'viewer', 'what', 'subject', 'art', 'work', 'film', 'even', 'slower', 'points', 'very', 'very', 'well.This', 'amazing', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'everyone', 'likely', 'have', 'patience', 'get']",Heartlands

The soundtrack is Celtic folk type music and is, by itself, great to listen to and fits the scenery perfectly.  The scenery, by the way, is set in the Peak District, and is breathtaking.  Sheen is perfect as the mild mannered Collin who wants to get his wife back. The wig was a bit much tho.

839648,A1LACH6MLQWZ,B0002L57XW,Doug Erlandson,"[1, 1]","It's a shame that Heartlands has not gained more of an audience than it has, but with just 16 reviews on Amazon (including this one) over a period of a decade, this is the conclusion I must reach. Heartlands is the story of Colin, an outstanding darts player, who is dumped by his wife for another player on the local darts team, and is then kicked off the darts team by this player. Colin heads by motorcycle to the national darts championship in the seaside town of Blackpool (known as the Las Vegas of England) in order to retrieve his wife. Along the way he encounters people who really care about him and learns to truly live and appreciate life for the first time. As a result, he is a changed person by the time he reaches his destination. Between the haunting music, scenes of the beautiful rural English countryside and the backroads that crisscross that countryside, Colin's encounters with some truly beautiful people, and Colin's believable development and change, this is a movie well worth watching. The hour and a half it takes to watch it flies by, despite the fact that it is not a fast-paced movie.One thing I would suggest. Unless you are extremely familiar with the accent of rural northern England, use the subtitles. Some of the dialogue is extremely hard to pick up otherwise.",5,Definitely worth watching,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,1299,"['shame', 'not', 'gained', 'more', 'audience', 'just', '16', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'including', 'one', 'period', 'decade', 'conclusion', 'must', 'reach', 'Heartlands', 'story', 'Colin', 'outstanding', 'darts', 'player', 'who', 'dumped', 'wife', 'player', 'local', 'darts', 'team', 'then', 'kicked', 'off', 'darts', 'team', 'player', 'Colin', 'heads', 'motorcycle', 'national', 'darts', 'championship', 'seaside', 'town', 'Blackpool', 'known', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'England', 'order', 'retrieve', 'wife', 'way', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'care', 'truly', 'live', 'appreciate', 'life', 'first', 'time', 'result', 'changed', 'person', 'time', 'destination', 'haunting', 'music', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'rural', 'English', 'countryside', 'backroads', 'crisscross', 'countryside', 'Colin', 'encounters', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'people', 'Colin', 'believable', 'development', 'change', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'hour', 'half', 'watch', 'flies', 'fact', 'not', 'fast-paced', 'movie.One', 'thing', 'would', 'suggest', 'are', 'extremely', 'familiar', 'accent', 'rural', 'northern', 'England', 'use', 'subtitles', 'dialogue', 'extremely', 'hard', 'pick', 'up', 'otherwise']",Heartlands
839649,AQE41QO3NEUMW,B0002L57XW,"Ronald Scheer ""rockysquirrel""","[8, 9]","Set somewhere in northern England, this working-class road movie shares some of the same territory as ""Full Monty,"" but it's in a class all by itself. Though it concerns the song-of-experience theme of betrayal and infidelity, it's a PG-13 song of innocence about a woolly-haired young man whose hero is a national darts champion. His journey to a getting-of-wisdom takes him on a moped along narrow two-lane roads and across rolling countryside, where the people he encounters open a world to him he never knew existed.Almost lost among the oafish, inconsiderate and embittered people, young and old, who surround him, he finds good reason to be touched by those capable of appreciating him. Instead of spoiling his innocence, his experience of this world only seems to deepen it. Michael Sheen as Colin is wonderful, his smile beatific, and his face registering a remarkable range of emotions. If it's possible to put a lump in your throat, this feel-good movie will do it.",5,Blissfully quirky . . .,1103414400,"12 19, 2004",2004,975,"['Set', 'somewhere', 'northern', 'England', 'working-class', 'road', 'movie', 'shares', 'same', 'territory', 'Full', 'Monty', 'class', 'song-of-experience', 'theme', 'betrayal', 'infidelity', 'PG-13', 'song', 'innocence', 'woolly-haired', 'young', 'man', 'hero', 'national', 'darts', 'champion', 'journey', 'getting-of-wisdom', 'moped', 'narrow', 'two-lane', 'roads', 'rolling', 'countryside', 'where', 'people', 'open', 'world', 'never', 'knew', 'existed.Almost', 'lost', 'oafish', 'inconsiderate', 'embittered', 'people', 'young', 'old', 'who', 'surround', 'good', 'reason', 'be', 'touched', 'capable', 'appreciating', 'Instead', 'spoiling', 'innocence', 'experience', 'world', 'only', 'deepen', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'Colin', 'wonderful', 'smile', 'beatific', 'face', 'registering', 'remarkable', 'range', 'emotions', 'possible', 'put', 'lump', 'throat', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'will', 'do']",Heartlands
