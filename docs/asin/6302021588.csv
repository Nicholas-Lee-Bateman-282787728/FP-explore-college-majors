291069,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302021588,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[30, 30]","A riveting, inspiring piece of American history, seeing the legendary Jackie Robinson play himself is a rare experience; a man who did so much to change the face of segregation, with enormous courage and extraordinary talent.This is a film everyone, young and old, black and white, should see. Buy it, keep it, give it as a gift. This film is a treasure, even for those of us who are not baseball fans, and like me, don't really understand the game...this film is about so much more...it is the portrait of an era, and the man who was able to make a difference.Jackie Robinson has a beauty in his face, and is a charismatic screen presence. He is backed by some excellent actors, like Ruby Dee, who plays Rae, his wife, and Minor Watson, terrific as Branch Rickey, who was president of The Brooklyn Dodgers, and also an interesting character. Rickey made a judgement call to hire Jackie, and was proved right, despite much opposition. Humor is provided by the very funny Ben Lessy as Shorty.The film starts with Robinson as a young boy, through his college years at UCLA, and his time with the Panthers, an all-black team, then a stint in the military during WWII, and later trying to get a job as a coach, with no results.Robinson of course suffered endless slurs and hatred in the early years with the Dodgers. Mr. Rickey made Robinson promise that he would never fight back when insulted, and even hit, and Robinson replied, ""Mr. Rickey, I have two cheeks"".The first game he played with ""organized baseball"" was in 1946, and changed sports history, and a hero was born. God bless Jackie Robinson, for all he did for sports, and all he achieved for humanity.With well paced direction by Alfred E. Green, a nice somewhat corny but appropriate score by Herschel Burke Gilbert, and the great Ernest Laszlo did the cinematography, which captures the enthusiasm of the game.Total running time is 77 minutes.",5,"""Mr. Rickey, I've got two cheeks""",1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,1904,"['riveting', 'inspiring', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'seeing', 'legendary', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'play', 'rare', 'experience', 'man', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'change', 'face', 'segregation', 'enormous', 'courage', 'extraordinary', 'talent.This', 'film', 'everyone', 'young', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'should', 'see', 'Buy', 'keep', 'give', 'gift', 'film', 'treasure', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'baseball', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'game', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'portrait', 'era', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'difference.Jackie', 'Robinson', 'beauty', 'face', 'charismatic', 'screen', 'presence', 'backed', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'who', 'Rae', 'wife', 'Minor', 'Watson', 'terrific', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'who', 'was', 'president', 'Brooklyn', 'Dodgers', 'also', 'interesting', 'character', 'Rickey', 'made', 'judgement', 'call', 'hire', 'Jackie', 'was', 'proved', 'right', 'much', 'opposition', 'Humor', 'provided', 'very', 'funny', 'Ben', 'Lessy', 'Shorty.The', 'film', 'Robinson', 'young', 'boy', 'college', 'years', 'UCLA', 'time', 'Panthers', 'all-black', 'team', 'then', 'stint', 'military', 'WWII', 'later', 'trying', 'get', 'job', 'coach', 'results.Robinson', 'course', 'suffered', 'endless', 'slurs', 'hatred', 'early', 'years', 'Dodgers', 'Mr.', 'Rickey', 'made', 'Robinson', 'promise', 'would', 'never', 'fight', 'back', 'when', 'insulted', 'even', 'hit', 'Robinson', 'replied', 'Mr.', 'Rickey', 'have', 'two', 'cheeks', '.The', 'first', 'game', 'played', 'organized', 'baseball', 'was', '1946', 'changed', 'sports', 'history', 'hero', 'was', 'born', 'God', 'bless', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'did', 'sports', 'achieved', 'humanity.With', 'well', 'paced', 'direction', 'Alfred', 'E.', 'Green', 'nice', 'somewhat', 'corny', 'appropriate', 'score', 'Herschel', 'Burke', 'Gilbert', 'great', 'Ernest', 'Laszlo', 'did', 'cinematography', 'enthusiasm', 'game.Total', 'running', 'time', '77', 'minutes']",N/A

291073,A2DY7QNWMO7D25,6302021588,Beverly,"[4, 4]","What's Amazing is the fact that this DVD is sold in the bargain basement grocery bins. I guess that shows that it really pays to at least take a peek at those bargain bins, sometimes you can find a real treasure--and this certainly fits the bill. I had never seen it on TV so I took it home and popped it into the DVD player so that I could at least get a chance to see Jackie Robinson play himself. It was interesting to view the events of Jackie's historical accomplishment on film in black in white during the era in which it actually happened. I am sure the directors had to brave some obstacles of their own in order to get the film released. This is a good story that was done well for it's time and it serves as an incredible piece of history.Of note are some of the comments made by members of the Negro League as they try to ""school"" a curious Jackie on the bus en route to another game. Their conversations tell of the hardships for African American baseball players during the Jim Crow era, including the fact that there were no contract for Negro League players and they were not allowed to use public facilities or sit at lunch counters.I especially enjoyed seeing a young Ruby Dee playing Jackie's wife. Jackie is fine playing himself. He's no actor but it certainly was a smart move to capture him hitting his own homers and performing great outfield feats. One can only imagine what he must have felt on the inside as hostile crowds jeered and called out obscenities. Robinson had to brave the name calling and personal threats while while mustering up the courage not to give in to the inclination to fight back. For that strength he was well respected and rewarded. Some of those difficult crowds cheered him on when as he later won the pennant for the Dodgers.Some say the film deserves a remake. I say they got it right the first time.

It ain't easy, especially when the subject is one of the most special films in history, with Jackie Robinson starring as himself, the first African-American to have a successful major league baseball career since the major leagues themselves were in their early days.  Complicating that is the fact that the film itself would be really quite poor if not for this subject matter, as several athletes and sports people are seen playing characters in the film.  With more professional actors the story would have been portrayed more vividly.Regardless, this is a gripping history piece that records several very important things for posterity.  The horrifying level of racism undergone by the gallant Robinson and other black ballplayers in the 1940s was the same racism undergone by other African-Americans across the US, but when Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, decided it was time to give a black man a shot in the majors, it seemed that all of the baseball fans, management, and players were against the two of them.  This the story of what Robinson went through, and how Rickey championed his cause, giving him the correct advice of ""Don't fight back.""  This MLK/Gandhi approach worked because Robinson had the character to make it work, was a likeable man, a great ballplayer, and, as one of the characters in the film points out, ""He's a gentleman too.""This story screams for a modern remake, one that would be done with a passion for historical accuracy and first-rate motion picture style.  As it is, this now ancient ""B"" movie is in the public domain, with several different companies offering the title in DVD or VHS.  The quality of the picture is therefore grainy and choppy, being cheaply copied from old celluloid.  Actually the public domain status has probably saved this precious history from a horrible fate, as the quality of the production is quite low and demand for the film apparently not high, so that anyone who owned a copyright on it might not find it financially feasible to put out on DVD.  In the public domain nobody has to paid for the rights to issue a video or DVD, so it's more readily available.Minor Watson steals the show as Rickey, showing fire and passion in regard to giving Robinson a fair chance when the rest of the baseball world wanted to shut out a black man.  As for Robinson himself, well, as an actor he's a great athlete, but it's pure joy to watch him show what a fine talent he was, and Ruby Dee is more than adequate as his wife.  Some of the supporting cast, especially ballplayers who are supposed to be furious and threatened at Robinson's presence, have no more acting ability than a third-grader in a Christmas pageant.The story is watered down for a 1950 audience, but much of what Robinson went through was surely R-rated.  A modern retelling would be wonderful to see, but will never replace this important piece of sports history, African-American history, and World War II era history.

Well, in 1946 it was time for Major League Baseball to ante up and rise to join the big leagues. ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" is the tale of an important journey on that bumpy road that America, through Major League baseball, finally and convulsively faced.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?Things anyone should be able to take for granted were considered out of the reach for too many Americans who were victims of a system that had hung around far too long. Jackie Robinson, by virtue of his talent and to a larger measure his solid character, was the right man at the right time to get the job done.The ""color line"", an invisible wall that never should have been constructed, was voluntarily destructed but it was not easy. This film tells us how this barrier was approached and the attitudes of those on all sides of the question. In many cases, it was not a pretty picture.Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, has the unique distinction of taking the moral high road while acting in the best interests of his team, his sport, and his country.Jackie Robinson, who plays himself in the movie (and does it very well), is clearly a human being that deserves the opportunities he gets and he earns everyone's respect in the process, fans and foes alike.MUCH MORE THAN JUST A SPORT MOVIE BIOGRAPHY:Yes, it is a taut and compelling film involving major league baseball and human rights.

But it's such an important moment in American history--and a story that everyone should know, but especially those too young to know what ""the color line"" was or who can't picture the hatred that greeted a baseball team in some cities because there was one black player on it.Plus, how wonderful is it that Robinson plays himself? As an actor, he is as handsome as Denzel Washington and brings a sweet, unaffected quality to his scenes with Rickey, Dee (as his wife), as well as the relentless haters. You see him struggle to honor his promise to Rickey--to turn the other cheek, no matter how many taunts and how much hatred was directed at him (and there was much).It's a compelling story, one that even I, as a Dodger's fan, didn't realize the complexity of. Best of all, we get to see Jackie Robinson playing second base (then first),  recreating his first major league game. At one point, when I realized I was actually seeing Jackie ROBINSON holding his bat over the plate, taking a swing, stealing a base, hitting one of those amazing home runs...whatever it was...it's hard to explain, but it was very, very moving.This is a great story and I think the handling of our country's racism is just about the right amount to keep people watching and to keep their eyes (and feelings) concentrating on the two men who were taking these great risks to fight it (as Rickey said, ""I may not be able to fight racism in the nation as a whole, but I should definitely be able to do something about it in baseball.""I think its a great film and should be part of classroom viewing.",5,"Plus, You Get to Watch Jackie Robinson Play Baseball!",1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1743,"['Yes', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'courage', 'various', 'people', 'Robinson', 'obviously', 'also', 'Dodger', 'brilliant', 'president', 'Branch', 'Rickey', 'such', 'important', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'story', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'especially', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'what', 'color', 'line', 'was', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'hatred', 'greeted', 'baseball', 'team', 'cities', 'was', 'one', 'black', 'player', 'it.Plus', 'how', 'wonderful', 'Robinson', 'actor', 'as', 'handsome', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'sweet', 'unaffected', 'quality', 'scenes', 'Rickey', 'Dee', 'wife', 'as', 'well', 'relentless', 'haters', 'see', 'struggle', 'honor', 'promise', 'Rickey', 'turn', 'other', 'cheek', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'taunts', 'how', 'much', 'hatred', 'was', 'directed', 'there', 'was', 'much', '.It', 'compelling', 'story', 'one', 'even', 'Dodger', 'fan', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'complexity', 'Best', 'get', 'see', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'playing', 'second', 'base', 'then', 'first', 'recreating', 'first', 'major', 'league', 'game', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'realized', 'was', 'actually', 'seeing', 'Jackie', 'ROBINSON', 'holding', 'bat', 'plate', 'taking', 'swing', 'stealing', 'base', 'hitting', 'one', 'amazing', 'home', 'runs', 'was', 'hard', 'explain', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'moving.This', 'great', 'story', 'think', 'handling', 'country', 'racism', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'keep', 'people', 'watching', 'keep', 'eyes', 'feelings', 'concentrating', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'taking', 'great', 'risks', 'fight', 'Rickey', 'said', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'fight', 'racism', 'nation', 'whole', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'something', 'baseball', 'think', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'classroom', 'viewing']",N/A

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 1]","JACKIE ROBINSON ""IS"" THE RIGHT MAN TO GET THE JOB DONE!OVERVIEW:It has been said that the best 3 things about America are ""The Constitution"", ""Jazz"", and ""Baseball"". Well, in 1946 it was time for Major League Baseball to ante up and rise to join the big leagues. ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" is the tale of an important journey on that bumpy road that America, through Major League baseball, finally and convulsively faced.WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?Things anyone should be able to take for granted were considered out of the reach for too many Americans who were victims of a system that had hung around far too long. Jackie Robinson, by virtue of his talent and to a larger measure his solid character, was the right man at the right time to get the job done.The ""color line"", an invisible wall that never should have been constructed, was voluntarily destructed but it was not easy. This film tells us how this barrier was approached and the attitudes of those on all sides of the question. In many cases, it was not a pretty picture.Branch Rickey, owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, has the unique distinction of taking the moral high road while acting in the best interests of his team, his sport, and his country.Jackie Robinson, who plays himself in the movie (and does it very well), is clearly a human being that deserves the opportunities he gets and he earns everyone's respect in the process, fans and foes alike.MUCH MORE THAN JUST A SPORT MOVIE BIOGRAPHY:Yes, it is a taut and compelling film involving major league baseball and human rights. More than that, it illustrates the naked, blind cruelty that seemed to grip people from all walks of life over the color issue as well as the sterling characters of a few mavericks.

291093,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6302021588,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[2, 2]","THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORY stars Jackie Robinson himself. Ruby Dee plays his wife Rachel. This 1950 film is a very bowdlerized account of Robinson's life and the struggles he faced integrating Major League Baseball. Jackie played for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1947 to 1956 (their halcyon years), and was one of the most creative players on the field.The baseball diamond, however, was simply the stage where Jackie played out, in complete isolation at first, one of the most dramatic social transformations in American history. By stepping onto the grass at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947, Jackie singlehandedly thrust the issue of civil rights into the forefront of the American consciousness. He paid a terrible price in verbal and psychological abuse, injuries inflicted by other players, death threats, and more. He prevailed, and America is a better place because of it, but Jackie's life was undoubtedly shortened by the ordeal. He died in 1972, blind and halt from diabetes, white haired and aged far beyond his 52 years.This film is crucially important because it is a document of Robinson's struggle, no matter how gentrified for a film audience. It is unique, because Robinson portrays himself. It is timely, as Robinson's field debut occurred only three years before the film's release, and virtually everyone represented in the film was still directly involved with Robinson. This is Hollywood's sincere attempt to come to grips with the impending Civil Rights Movement, a Movement spearheaded by Robinson.Robinson is an unpolished actor whose great talent is his intensity. Even though this is a film, and even though this illuminates past events, Robinson is living through every minute of every experience, not acting at all. The film has an air of having been hastily thrown together, but despite the roughnesses of its 8mm home movie feel, this film is compelling to watch.No one can really understand what Jackie Robinson, ""the loneliest man in baseball"" felt in his gut, but we can honor him, and have. He was a trailblazer. His talent was legendary. His number, 42, has been retired throughout the Major Leagues. He was the first Rookie of the Year, a Most Valuable Player, a Hall of Famer, and posted impressive statistics even in his rookie year when the possibility of his being shot from the stands was an ugly, very real, possibility. He may have been the loneliest man in baseball, but he was also the bravest man in America for the longest stretch of time.",5,"""I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me.

Robinson was big news when he became the first black major league ball player, and I guess Warners decided they'd cash in on the controversy by starring Robinson as himself in his own &#34;story, though bear in mind this is about as much of a &#34;biography&#34; as anything else so-called back then...i.e. lots of hogwash and fiction, with tiny bits of fact thrown in for respectability. It's just fun to see the real Robinson in a full-length film, but thank Heaven he was a better ballplayer than he was an actor 'cause he clearly had the chops for one and clearly NOT for the other. The colorized version is interesting to watch and thanks to digital improvements in that technology it doesn't have that muddy, artificial look it did back when they first started destroying classic films like &#34;Casablanca&#34; subjecting it to that process. But I'm a purist and feel that if a filmmaker meant for something to be in color he /she would've FILMED it that way, so I'm a bit biased against the process in general. But this makes a nice piece of history if nothing else, and certainly worth seeing whether you've already seen &#34;42&#34; or plan on it. Filmmakers can get away with considerably more these days when dealing with racism not than was possible...or acceptable to the movie-going public....back in the white-bread, suburb-choked fifties when &#34;decent&#34; people just didn't discuss it in spite of its prevalence.

Potential purchasers should note that a portion of the proceeds go to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which consulted with Legend on the colorization process.
