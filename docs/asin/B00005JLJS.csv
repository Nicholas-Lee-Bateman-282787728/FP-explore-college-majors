601668,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B00005JLJS,A. Boston,"[3, 3]","I love this show, hands down, in my top 5. I saw the entire series when it originally aired on tv when I was in college, and this is one of the few I would consider re-watching, so I had to own it. I think the 1st and 3rd season are my favorite, but on the whole you should see them all. This isn't just a show for the ladies either. I'll have marathons when I'm sick, or just taking a 'couch day' and without fail, my boyfriend will show up... he might start out pretending to read a book, but next thing you know, he's asking me questions and watching it with me.I did notice the songs were different from the original, and I'm huge music buff. But honestly, besides noticing it, it didn't actually bother me. The plot is the stand out star, not the music. It might change the mood of certain scenes slightly, but if you never saw them on tv, you'd never know.As I've said before, I'm a huge sucker for love triangles. But, I only ones that are done well, not gooey and cheesy. You will forever be torn between Ben and Noel....you may find yourself shouting out your choice(for me, I shout BEN!) trying to sway Felicity one way or the other. The first season captures perfectly the first year of college in a new place, the uncertainty, discovery and exhilaration.Javier, who shows up in the 2nd 1/2 of the 1st season, is amazing and definitely stands out with a great dose of comedy. All the characters were cast extremely well, and you'll definitely have your personal favorites.Timeless, excellent show.

Keri Russell and Scott Speedman are so good together, their chemistry is so believable i can see why they dated in real life. There is something so pure and gentle about the first season, it's magical and unforgettable. Creator J.J Abrams is a genius, it's kind of interesting that a man created this show. My favorite episode from Freshman year is the Halloween episode, just funny and intimate. Love all the episodes from all the seasons, but of course you have to start somewhere and season one is the place to begin this journey with Felicity and her friends. Great series, i miss this show, the finest shows on t.v. never get the respect they deserve like Once and Again and Ed.

601671,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00005JLJS,barry,"[38, 38]","FELICITY has aged very well and is in no way dated.  I grew up with this show and never purchased any of the seasons on dvd with their original release.  The series is grounded by superb writing and direction, timeless storylines that affect college age people that never fade but most of all it is held together by the all around superb cast.  The acting here is impeccable and runs the gamut from humorous to heartwrenching.  And of course at its center is the star, the immensely talented Keri Russell.  The weight of the show rests on her angelic shoulders and she carries it so gracefully.  To follow her emotional journey becomes a gift to the viewer.Most people reading this will agree with what I just said and are huge fans of the show.  But what one wonders is why have these reissued boxed sets appeared and how is the quality?  I never saw the original released boxed sets but know at that time series sets were rather bulky.  This firs season is a very slim presentation with 6 discs perfectly placed in a plastic cd case which inserts into an outer cardboard protective sleeve.  It is very attractive, takes up little room and I can only imagine that the show has continued to sell since its demise so they came up with a more user friendly version to hopefully get even more sales.As far as I can tell everything abouth the discs and the video/audio presentation is exactly the same as the original set.  The video quality is excellent even with the pilot episode.  The show always has its emotional moments and the instrumental track works very well.  The only complaint here was an issue with the original set as well.  The show often used modern day popular songs and those songs are replaced on this dvd set for they chose not to pay the royalities to include those songs.  Much effort was not put into choosing alternative songs.  A perfect example is with the pilot.  As we know Felicity corresponds with her friend Sally via tape.  At the end of the pilot there is a voiceover of Sally's latest tape.  The song in the background is obviously a replacement from what was originally uased and it is jarring, loud and it becomes very difficult to hear Sally.  The song in no way reflects the emotions of the scene.So bottom line.  I highly recommend the series FELICITY.  The video is here in all its glory and looks great.  This boxed set is an elegant slimline version.  Just note that if the only way you want to see FELICITY is exactly as it aired audio wise then these sets are not for you.  The song replacement doesn't happen often but when it does it is jarring.  Sadly there is no way to get FELICITY in its true original form audio wise.  You must purchase it with this slight flaw or give it a pass.  For me, once I adjusted to the switched occasional songs all was fine.  The instrumental soundtrack is still intact.  The show is still FELICITY and it delivers the same emotional wallop to me as it originally did.The song replacement is obviously why I could not give this classic series 5 stars.",4,Felicity still awesome but beware the music soundtrack,1246579200,"07 3, 2009",2009,3028,"['FELICITY', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'dated', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'never', 'purchased', 'seasons', 'dvd', 'original', 'release', 'series', 'grounded', 'superb', 'writing', 'direction', 'timeless', 'storylines', 'affect', 'college', 'age', 'people', 'never', 'fade', 'most', 'held', 'together', 'superb', 'cast', 'acting', 'here', 'impeccable', 'gamut', 'humorous', 'heartwrenching', 'course', 'center', 'star', 'immensely', 'talented', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'weight', 'show', 'angelic', 'shoulders', 'so', 'gracefully', 'follow', 'emotional', 'journey', 'gift', 'viewer.Most', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'agree', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'are', 'huge', 'fans', 'show', 'what', 'one', 'why', 'have', 'reissued', 'boxed', 'sets', 'appeared', 'how', 'quality', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'released', 'boxed', 'sets', 'know', 'time', 'series', 'sets', 'were', 'rather', 'bulky', 'firs', 'season', 'very', 'slim', 'presentation', '6', 'discs', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'plastic', 'cd', 'case', 'outer', 'cardboard', 'protective', 'sleeve', 'very', 'attractive', 'up', 'little', 'room', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'show', 'continued', 'sell', 'demise', 'came', 'up', 'more', 'user', 'friendly', 'version', 'hopefully', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'sales.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'everything', 'discs', 'video/audio', 'presentation', 'exactly', 'same', 'original', 'set', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', 'even', 'pilot', 'episode', 'show', 'always', 'emotional', 'moments', 'instrumental', 'track', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'here', 'was', 'issue', 'original', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'often', 'used', 'modern', 'day', 'popular', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'replaced', 'dvd', 'set', 'chose', 'not', 'pay', 'royalities', 'include', 'songs', 'Much', 'effort', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'choosing', 'alternative', 'songs', 'perfect', 'example', 'pilot', 'know', 'Felicity', 'friend', 'Sally', 'tape', 'end', 'pilot', 'voiceover', 'Sally', 'latest', 'tape', 'song', 'background', 'obviously', 'replacement', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'uased', 'jarring', 'loud', 'very', 'difficult', 'hear', 'Sally', 'song', 'way', 'emotions', 'scene.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'FELICITY', 'video', 'here', 'glory', 'great', 'boxed', 'set', 'elegant', 'slimline', 'version', 'Just', 'note', 'only', 'way', 'want', 'see', 'FELICITY', 'exactly', 'aired', 'audio', 'wise', 'then', 'sets', 'are', 'not', 'song', 'replacement', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'when', 'jarring', 'Sadly', 'way', 'get', 'FELICITY', 'true', 'original', 'form', 'audio', 'wise', 'must', 'purchase', 'slight', 'flaw', 'give', 'pass', 'once', 'adjusted', 'switched', 'occasional', 'songs', 'was', 'fine', 'instrumental', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'intact', 'show', 'still', 'FELICITY', 'same', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'originally', 'song', 'replacement', 'obviously', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'classic', 'series', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Premiering on the WB network in September 1998, the show (along with Dawson's Creek) helped ignite a firestorm of highly successful original series on behalf of the upstart network, with such hit shows as Angel (1999), Gilmore Girls (2000), and Smallville (2001). The brainchild of writer J.J. Abrams (creator of the two hit series Alias and Lost), Felicity follows the life of a recent high school graduate, not through seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, but through Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years. Similar in genre to its contemporary, Dawson's Creek, Felicity's cast is of approximately the same age, but the setting is college instead of high school...Felicity begins when the star of the series, Felicity Porter (Keri Russell), graduates from high school. Having harbored a four-year crush on classmate Ben Covington (Scott Speedman), despite the fact they've never talked, Felicity musters the courage in the aftermath of their commencement ceremony to ask him to sign her yearbook. When Ben writes some surprising comments, Felicity decides to follow him to fictional University of New York (UNY) instead of pursuing her goal of pre-med at Stanford. Against her parent's wishes, she enrolls in the school and moves cross country where she becomes roommates with Meghan Rotundi (Amanda Foreman), a girl whose lifestyle clashes with her own, and where she meets resident advisor Noel Crane (Scott Foley) who immediately develops a crush on her. When Ben learns of the true reason for Felicity's enrollment, he's both flattered and a little uncertain about Felicity's mental stability. In the ensuing four years, Felicity goes through the basic trials and travails of a maturing college student, experiencing the ups and downs of life, love, and adulthood...The Felicity (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere in which Felicity makes the big move to UNY. While there, she meets her new roommate and the resident advisor Noel Crane. She also makes quick friends with aspiring musician Julie. After telling Ben of her true motivations for attending UNY, he's apprehensive about starting a relationship, and Felicity announces that she'd just like to be friends. However, she gets jealous when she finds Ben and Julie together. Meanwhile, Felicity takes advantage of her job with the college and reads Ben's entrance essay, an inspirational piece about his dead brother. But she later learns that Ben has no brother at all... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Thanksgiving"" in which Felicity cancels her plans to return home for Thanksgiving in order to stay with Julie so that she will not be alone, and ""Assassins"" in which Noel and Felicity break off their relationship after each learns of the other's unforgivable actions...Below is a list of episodes included on the Felicity (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (The Last Stand)Episode 3 (Hot Objects)Episode 4 (Boggled)Episode 5 (Spooked)Episode 6 (Cheating)Episode 7 (Drawing the Line: Part 1)Episode 8 (Drawing the Line: Part 2)Episode 9 (Thanksgiving)Episode 10 (Finally)Episode 11 (Gimme an O!)Episode 12 (Friends)Episode 13 (Todd Mulcahy: Part 1)Episode 14 (Todd Mulcahy: Part 2)Episode 15 (Love and Marriage)Episode 16 (The Fugue)Episode 17 (Assassins)Episode 18 (Happy Birthday)Episode 19 (Docuventary)Episode 20 (Connections)Episode 21 (The Force)Episode 22 (Felicity Was Here)The DVD Report",5,Freshman year...,1121731200,"07 19, 2005",2005,3574,"['Nominated', '2', 'Emmys', '2', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'including', 'Best', 'TV', 'Series', 'Drama', 'Felicity', 'gathered', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'short', 'four', 'season', 'stint', 'Premiering', 'WB', 'network', 'September', '1998', 'show', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'helped', 'ignite', 'firestorm', 'highly', 'successful', 'original', 'series', 'behalf', 'upstart', 'network', 'such', 'hit', 'shows', 'Angel', '1999', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', '2000', 'Smallville', '2001', 'brainchild', 'writer', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'creator', 'two', 'hit', 'series', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'Felicity', 'life', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'not', 'seasons', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'Freshman', 'Sophomore', 'Junior', 'Senior', 'years', 'Similar', 'genre', 'contemporary', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'Felicity', 'cast', 'approximately', 'same', 'age', 'setting', 'college', 'instead', 'high', 'school', 'Felicity', 'when', 'star', 'series', 'Felicity', 'Porter', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'high', 'school', 'Having', 'harbored', 'four-year', 'crush', 'classmate', 'Ben', 'Covington', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'talked', 'Felicity', 'courage', 'aftermath', 'commencement', 'ceremony', 'ask', 'sign', 'yearbook', 'When', 'Ben', 'surprising', 'comments', 'Felicity', 'follow', 'fictional', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'UNY', 'instead', 'pursuing', 'goal', 'pre-med', 'Stanford', 'parent', 'wishes', 'school', 'moves', 'cross', 'country', 'where', 'roommates', 'Meghan', 'Rotundi', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'girl', 'lifestyle', 'clashes', 'own', 'where', 'resident', 'advisor', 'Noel', 'Crane', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'who', 'immediately', 'crush', 'When', 'Ben', 'true', 'reason', 'Felicity', 'enrollment', 'flattered', 'little', 'uncertain', 'Felicity', 'mental', 'stability', 'ensuing', 'four', 'years', 'Felicity', 'basic', 'trials', 'travails', 'maturing', 'college', 'student', 'experiencing', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'love', 'adulthood', 'Felicity', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Felicity', 'big', 'move', 'UNY', 'there', 'new', 'roommate', 'resident', 'advisor', 'Noel', 'Crane', 'also', 'quick', 'friends', 'aspiring', 'musician', 'Julie', 'telling', 'Ben', 'true', 'motivations', 'attending', 'UNY', 'apprehensive', 'starting', 'relationship', 'Felicity', 'announces', ""'d"", 'just', 'be', 'friends', 'However', 'jealous', 'when', 'Ben', 'Julie', 'together', 'Meanwhile', 'Felicity', 'advantage', 'job', 'college', 'Ben', 'entrance', 'essay', 'inspirational', 'piece', 'dead', 'brother', 'later', 'Ben', 'brother', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Thanksgiving', 'Felicity', 'plans', 'return', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'order', 'stay', 'Julie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'alone', 'Assassins', 'Noel', 'Felicity', 'break', 'off', 'relationship', 'learns', 'other', 'unforgivable', 'actions', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Felicity', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Episode', '3', 'Hot', 'Objects', 'Episode', '4', 'Boggled', 'Episode', '5', 'Spooked', 'Episode', '6', 'Cheating', 'Episode', '7', 'Drawing', 'Line', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '8', 'Drawing', 'Line', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '9', 'Thanksgiving', 'Episode', '10', 'Finally', 'Episode', '11', 'Gim', 'O', 'Episode', '12', 'Friends', 'Episode', '13', 'Todd', 'Mulcahy', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '14', 'Todd', 'Mulcahy', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '15', 'Love', 'Marriage', 'Episode', '16', 'Fugue', 'Episode', '17', 'Assassins', 'Episode', '18', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Episode', '19', 'Docuventary', 'Episode', '20', 'Connections', 'Episode', '21', 'Force', 'Episode', '22', 'Felicity', 'Was', 'Here', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I was only a year younger than Felicity, so I was able to relate pretty well. But, I stopped watching the show about mid-way through the second season. Looking back, I assumed that it was because I was actually in college now and too busy to watch it. So, I saw it on Netflix this year and decided that I was going to watch the series again - start to finish. Once again, I got as far as the middle of the second season and stopped. Now I remember why:The first season really gets you into the show. Felicity is totally adorable - pretty, quirky, smart. Ben is gorgeous and Noel is the sweetest guy alive. The friends are all unique and have interesting story lines. It adequately describes so much of what I went through in college.  So, at this point, I have finished the first season, pleased with what I saw and ready to jump into season 2. Then, I decided to read an episode by episode breakdown of all the episodes. I was floored - in a bad way. The plots got worse and worse - and more and more unreal. You start to see that Ben really is a shmuck and wonder how Felicity can't get past it to be with Noel, who was so good for her. Julie becomes pathetic and you stop feeling sorry for her. Ben's roommate (the inventor guy) just becomes a loser instead of unique and amusing.So, I stopped watching. It didn't hold my interest because nothing was coming together. The characters simply stopped being lovable.

I was looking around for another series when I stubbled across this one.  Having a high school junior as one of our primary viewers, I was intrigued by this series and ordered it based upon the reviews.This first season is really, really good.  The main character of Felicity (played by Keri Russell) has just gradated from high school in California and turned her life upside down by moving to NYC for college.  Not only does this decision seem to come out of the blue, it is against the wishes of her parents who have her life mapped out and this move was not in their plans.  Felicity has largely made the decision based upon her desire to do something different and to follow Ben, the big man on campus at her high school.  Rash and crazy, this decision sets in motion the rest of the season as we see her deal with roommate issues, guy issues, and classoom, issues -- typical freshman stuff.  Great cast and well acted.Good series (particularly for women/girls) but some of the subject matter is more mature that I was expecting.

Her honest, subtle, and heartbreaking performances were the main reason to tune in every week.

601688,A385C064Y38OFK,B00005JLJS,"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com""","[1, 4]","Over my holidays from my work, I have been able to watch the six disc collection that makes up 'Felicity: Series One'. I started Christmas Eve December 24 2003, and watched one disc every time I got a chance long enough to watch it.I finished the entire series of season 1 on 11th January 2004. I left the commentry tracks on the pilot episode and final episode to series one until the very end.I found a few familiar episodes during series one. I rememberwatching Episode 6 ""Cheating"" either on TV one day or on video.All of the other 20 episodes were totally new to me. Even theepisodes I remember briefly seeing seemed new to me. Amazingly Ihadn't really seen much of this show until I got the DVDs to series one. I just saw Ron's name in the opening titles of an episode one night and knew I had to watch from that second onwards.Apart from seeing Series one now, the only other episodes I have seen of 'Felicity' have been from Series 3 from episode 1 to episode 5 or 6 on a video from 2001 before September 11. So I felt it was a good chance to see things before tragedy stuck the world. I was quite enjoying it. What a change! Nothing too drastic really, but it was good to see the storylines were still excellent. As anyone who has been to college knows in college anything can and does happen. Secrets do not stay secrets for long. Everyone has to know everything about you. It's not easy for anyone. Boy am I glad my college years are over.Although I did hear about a shooting in the show but I never saw that double episode from one year, it did sound exciting!All of the episodes in series one were extremely excellent. I loved them all so much. It was very easy to watch, very well acted and it was I felt, a very worthy show for Brian Grazer, Ron Howard and Tony Krantz all as executive producers to pursue.One of the most interesting stories for a Pilot episode really caughtmy attention and really makes me believe that anything is possible. All you really have to do is follow your heart, or my heart. That there isn't really one right or wrong way to live your life. Just to do what feels right. To take a chance to do something extraordinary with your life and see where it leads you.Here is what the pilot to Felicity says...""When Felicity misinterprets what Ben, a long term high-school crush, writes in her yearbook, she impulsively decides to follow him to college in New York. Once there, Felicity struggles to stick to her decision.""To most people this would be an impulsive and a really crazy idea. Like the pilot suggests. I wont totally disagree with that thought. But I am sure someone might have done this. That being, followedsomeone impulsively, or something similar, and they wouldn't be a fictional character. Someone in real life. I wonder how their life would be now if that happened...As far as the commentry from J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves suggests, itsounds like it was just an idea they had for a movie, that soon theydecided would work better as a TV show. If this pilot idea does anything, it leaves the idea open for debate and possibility to people who really might consider doing this. To really do what they believe is right. That you can change your life if you are braveenough to take the first big step.I for one really like this pilot idea. I'm glad someone else found it of interest and based a show around a decision like this.For me being born in Australia and living in Australia I found it immensly interesting to see what school life and relationships might be like in USA, also the laws on cheating, marriage, just about anything that could come to mind being a teenager on their way to adulthood. The relationships 'Felicity' forms during her first Freshman year.The terms freshman, sophomore, junior and senior years, all seem a little foreign to me. I think we have a slightly different school system here in Australia but I could be wrong. So that just became something else to admire about the similarities and differences I noticed from the USA.Another great thing I noticed about college life in 'Felicity' around New York was how every one of Felicity's friends was there for her. Most of the time at least. Yes, they got into quite a few disagreements about all sorts of teenage or adult issues, but they were able to talk about their feelings really well, and articulate how they felt some of the time very well, that seemed very real.One of the things I think people dislike about Dawson's Creek is how everyone uses such big words and sounds so sophisticated, when adults or viewers know teenages don't really speak that way.Therefore making it less believeable. You wouldn't find the speech in Felicity sophisticated for teenages. Just smart and intellegent and most importantly REAL. With possibly real outcomes as answers if anyone was to pose any of the questions to people on 'Felicity'.I really like this sentence on the DVD pack. ""Sometimes it is thesmallest decisions that can pretty much change your life forever.""I really found 'Felicity' to be a thrilling expecience over myholidays. Totally enjoyable, and a very special and memorable viewing experience. I'm sure if I was to watch it again, I would watch it anew and afresh as the DVD pack suggests I do. I would recommend this show to anyone.I found some 'Felicity' fans online and they say the first series is the best series for whatever reason it could be. That's interesting I thought. It was indeed a great first series, but I am sure I will not be disappointed by the other series. I am sure they are all very special in they own way.I noticed Jennifer Garner from 'Daredevil' and 'Alias' appears asHannah for a few episodes during 'Felicity', and knowing that J.JAbrams the co-creator and writer of 'Felicity' went on to 'Alias', I just felt I had to collect this television series too.Ron, Brian and Tony did not go with J.J. Abrams to 'Alias'. They went from 'Felicity' a story based in New York and home to the past famous Twin Towers, to '24' about a 'Counter Terrorist Unit' to make sure, tragic events like what happened on September 11 2001 never happen again. Even though '24' is also fictional, I feel this show too is worth people's time.I think 'Felicity' shows people dreams really can come true. No matter if they are personal goals or college achievements. Anything is possible just believe that you can do it and success for you, wherever you desire it, wont be too far away.I learned things from watching 'Felicity'. I can't wait to see where the next three series will take her.For me the seasons just keep getting better. Season Four is my favorite season. However to really see the hardships Felicity and her friends face you must see the show from the start. It was a very worthwhile experience for me and continues to be.",5,"""Sometimes it is the smallest things that can pretty much change your life forever"" Felicity Season One",1121299200,"07 14,

Felicity is a shy, smart, and socially awkward girl about to enter college. She has plans to go to Stanford and become a doctor, just as her father has dreamed for years. But all his dreams come to a sudden halt when Felicity decides to follow her highschool crush,Ben, whom she hardly knows to New York University. So the story begins. Felicity has no friends her in NY, and Ben can't even rememeber her name. She is definitely considering heading back to California. But Felicity perserveres and meets Noel(Scott Folley), a sophomore, who is her RA. Noel listens to her problems and helps her through all the Ben stuff faithfully. But truth be told, Noel is falling for Felicity. Meanwhile, Felicity meets Julie Emerick, her soon to be best friend. Julie is sweet, cute, and loves guitar and is just what Felicity needs until Julie falls for Ben, and Ben falls right back. But over time, their relationship ends, but Felicity and Noel's has just begun (over a game of Boggle, I might add). But now, guess what? Ben wants Felicity. Filled with love triangles and a great cast (including Javier, Sean, Elena, and Meghan), Felicity experiences troubles that a college student would and overcomes them.

601692,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JLJS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[27, 34]","It was interesting to go back and watch the freshman year of &quot;Felicity&quot; again on DVD, knowing who Felicity (Keri Russell) was going to end up with at the end of not only the first season but the entire series.  You have to understand that I was always rooting for Noel (Scott Foley) over Ben (Scott Speedman) and ended up caring for Julie Emrick (Amy Jo Johnson) more than Felicity, even before she made the wrong choice.  But then the first season of &quot;Felicity&quot; is all about wrong choices and the human train wreck that is Felicity Porter.  Our local cable company lost its WB affiliate all I ever got to see of the second season was the first episode where I was outraged by the revelation of Felicity's decision and took a perverse satisfaction in the infamous hair cut.  But then my anxiety was quickly shifted to finding friends or relatives around the country who could tape &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; for me and I quickly forgot about &quot;Felicity.&quot;  When we got the WB back I caught a few of the finale episodes, including the &quot;time travel&quot; ones, which brought the whole first season back to light again.Once upon a time a young girl named Felicity finally got the nerve after her high school graduation to finally go up and speak to the good lucky guy she always had a crush on.  He signed her yearbook and what he wrote was enough to have her decided not to go to Stanford to study to be a doctor but to head to New York to follow the boy, Ben.  The big public comment on the first season was that if you reversed the two roles you would have the story of a stalker.  But since it was a girl doing the stalking and because she had wonderful ringlets of curly hair, the behavior was apparently okay.  More importantly, Felicity pays for her actions in those first three episodes, where she crashes and burns at just about each and every opportunity, and the show is more about getting away from her parents than it is about pursuing Ben Convington.Unlike &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; where the hook ended up destroying the series, &quot;Felicity&quot; avoids the mistake and comes up with the most credible job of showing what college is like on television since &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (which was really on point only if you were in law school).  The episode &quot;Cheating&quot; involved the topic of plagiarism while the two-parter on &quot;Drawing the Line&quot; dealt with the issue of date rape, both of which were dealt with in responsible manners.  The second time I saw the latter I had the exact same thought when Ben starts beating up on Zach, who yells for him to stop, and Ben does saying: &quot;When you said 'Stop,' I did.  That's the difference between us.&quot;  At the other end where we deal with comedy there is Noel on &quot;smart juice&quot; during &quot;Finally,&quot; Felicity putting &quot;sex with Noel&quot; down in her day planner in &quot;Give Me an O,&quot; and when Meghan's parents confront Felicity with what they found in &quot;her&quot; box in &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;I also like the fact that although the show focuses on the love triangle between the three principles and the problems of Felicity's gal pals Julie and Elena (Tanig Miller), that background characters like Sean (Greg Grunberg) and Megan (Amanda Foreman) could emerge so strongly, especially the later, who starts off as a one joke characters as Felicity's absent roommate and ends up stealing every since scene she is in the rest of the season.  But replacing Javier (Ian Gomez) with Abby and Danny was a mistake, that was thankfully rectified the next season.  Yes, there are bits that will go too far for your tastes, such as Felicity agreeing to marry Javier so he can stay in the country (although I loved it when she brightly announced &quot;I'm marrying a gay guy too&quot; to Noel's gay brother's partner) and a college professor deciding to have an affair with a freshman, but there are enough legitimate track wrecks to keep you attentive.The extras are sparse on these DVDS, with commentary by the creators on the first and last episodes, and my biggest complaint is that there are no chapter stops for the episodes, so that when I wanted to check and see if Bradley Whitford's name appeared in the end credits of &quot;Birthday&quot; it was a pain to check it out.

601693,A71ZGMCZ3LGHS,B00005JLJS,L. Crater,"[1, 1]","I just loved this show ever since it aired back in 1999 - 2002.  It was such a terrific journey we took as we saw Felicity go from a wide-eyed and scared freshman to a mature and much wiser and brave young woman ready to graduate.  This was fun, humorous, dramatic, and sometimes crazy tv at its finest and the acting was flawless!  Keri Russell led the very talented young cast and much of the show's success rested on her small shoulders and she handled it with grace and perfection that led to her Golden Globe win during the very first year of the show.  Much was said about her ""haircut"" in the 2nd season, but I really feel that it provided so much more believability and edge to the show.  Felicity was growing up and her hair followed her and the state of mind that she was in...she wanted to change and it all started with a whole new attitude that began with her freshly chopped locks.  Personally, I think that Keri is beautiful with both long and short hair, but those spiral curls and longer hair only enhance her beauty.As the seasons came & went, we were able to fall in love with Felicity's friends including Julie (Amy Jo Johnson), Ben (Scott Speedman), Elena (Tangi Miller), Meaghan (Amanda Foreman), Javier (Ian Gomez), and of course her RA Noel (Scott Foley).  Love them or hate them, they all provided such great roles in Felicity's journey through college and added touches of drama, comedy, and sincerity at just the right times.Felicity came along when the WB was airing such good shows like Popular, Dawson's Creek, & Gilmore Girls...Ahhh, those were the days.  And looking back, I will always love Felicity and the 4 yrs of her life as she ventured through college uncertain where her life was going to lead her.  Now, years later, I've come to simply love the show for all that it represented and all of the fun times that Felicity had with her friends and the drama that came along with it.  Long live Felicity and her hair (short or long)!!If you are a fan of good tv and like shows like Gilmore Girls, Popular, One Tree Hill, and Dawson's Creek, then you will love this show - probably much more now than when it originally aired.

601696,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B00005JLJS,M. Leister,"[0, 2]","This is hands down the best season of Felicity.  I would tell anyone interested in watching it to Google who Felicity picks at the start of season two, Ben or Noel, and make up what happens next for yourself because the subsequent seasons do NOT live up to the first one.My favorite episode of the this year, because it made me laugh, was the pre-Christmas break studying for finals ep where Noel takes ""smart powder"" that contains beets.  He happens to be allergic to beets and it makes him hyper.  He and Ben wind up in the library studying. At first they are whispering, with subtitles, and Noel winds up shouting at Ben as the beets attack, and the subtitles change to all caps.  It's a visual funny helped along by the Christmas song whose lyrics are, ""jingle, jangle"", playing in the background.  I'm chuckling thinking about it.  The show really did have a great sense of humor the first season that was much missed in later years.  I do wonder if they lost writers after year one?What I didn't like this season is that Felicity cheated on Noel because she assumed he was cheating on her at the same time.  That was the only excuse she gave him for it and she seemed put out that he didn't take it.  So he had dinner with his ex, dinner doesn't mean sex.  The writers said people complained because Felicity lost her virginity and ""they weren't telling the story of a virgin"", but I complained because she became a cheater.  It was the first time I wanted to smack a TV character for being stupid.Another dark spot was Julie's date rape story.  I don't dispute doing it, and maybe it was my age at the time, but I really didn't get that he raped her until they started saying it the next episode.  How the scene was shot, she quietly said ""no"", no shouting or trying to get away from him to indicate fear, but then clearly showed her kissing him back, like she changed her mind (Julie was a party girl trying to rehab her rep with a nice guy so I thought she said no, to be new Julie, and then went with it because she liked him).  It was very unclear to me at the time that she had been forced.  Honestly I thought they were going to do a story where she lied about it to get attention.

Thank goodness there are DVD's!The complete first season of Felicity is a wonderful stroll back in time to Felicity's first year in college in New York City - a time when one decision changed her entire path in life. Being a freshman in college at the same time the character of Felicity was, allowed me to identify with her a lot more than if she had been in high school. Felicity's struggle with her parents, meeting new people, surviving in a city she knew nothing about, and coming to grips with the fact that she moved across the country to follow a guy from high school who wrote something nice in her yearbook, are some of the best traits about the show.All of the characters were cast perfectly!

When I first watched it I expected another 'dawson's creek', typical teen moving with bad script writing.What I discovered was an exciting show with script lines matched perfectly and humourously with the characters and their personalities.Every episode is a delight and deals thoroughly with university life.That said this season is one of the best. Overall it is hard to judge one season from the next - season 2 was also pretty cool. Rather, the show acts as an epic. However this season is extremely funny. The episode where felicity and the gang study in the library is a hoot and a half. A stand out moment is when Noel downs one of meghan's recipes to help you study, containing an ingredient Noel is alergic to, Beets! Nervously he runs about the library with the a humourous christmas song chiming 'jingle jangle...'The dvd is quite lacklustre. For its price it's not too bad but one might expect more features (much more), more quality picture and sound, and respect to the original soundtrack. The redo of the music takes away the diversity it had, and the reflection of teen music (popular and unpopular). The new edited music seems somewhat out of place.However if you're looking to own the first season of felicity regardless of the above problems it's a season well worth the buy.

601699,ANUBY6KOT60WH,B00005JLJS,R. Galeano Valencia,"[4, 4]","I still remember all the fuzz back in 1999 when premiering the second season of the hit TV-show ""Felicity"", audiences worldwide were shocked to see the leading character (until then portrayed by a doll-like looking Keri Russell), cut her long manes and exhibit an ultra (very and extremely) short hairdo. Nobody back then understood why the main character was diminished to a boyish-looking thin girl struggling her way in sophomore year in a fictional University of New York, instead of keeping the so far proved successful formula of a super model-looking actress struggling her way in sophomore year in a fictional University of New York.J.J. Abrams ""Felicity"" is still one of my favorite TV shows ever. And watching those old eps, I realize that the story would have been completely different hadn't Felicity have what is known as the ""infamous"" haircut. And mainly because, seen in perspective  the haircut meant change, transformation, growth. From a shy, aimless, scared adolescent entering college, to a solid, at-ease, confident and focused young woman facing the challenges that come with growth and age. And that's precisely what ""Felicity"" is all about. No wonder how such a short-run show (it only lasted four seasons) is still cherished as one of their favorites by many many people around the world. And no wonder why Ron Howard is listed as one of the show's Executive Producers (...I mean...). In time, audiences finally understood what Felicity was all about .All the characters in the show, convey honesty and balance to a truly great script. Scott Speedman (""Ben""), Scott Foley (""Noel""), Greg Grungberg (""Sean""), Amanda Foreman (""Meghan""), Tangi Miller (""Elena""), Ian Gomez (""Javier""), and pretty much all the cast, they all are the perfect ensamble and significantly contribute to make this a picture-perfect entertainment product.A number of these actors were (and still are) subsequently used by Abrams in different projects (for instance, Kevin Weisman from a tiny little role as ""Earl"" in ""Felicity"" ended up being a major core character in Abrams' ""Alias"", as the pintoresque ""Marshall""). Amanda Foreman ends up being Marshall's wife, in ""Alias"" too. Greg Grunberg ends up being one of Sydney Bristow's spy pals, etc.... And of course, who can forget the impressive transition of a very young Jenniffer Garner (who played ""Hannah"" in ""Felicity"") to her award-winning, worldwide worshipped role of Sidney Bristow in J.J. Abrams' ""Alias""?Back to ""Felicity""... The episodes are written in a smart, warm way that everybody can relate to. The music is simply spectacular (Heather Nova, Esthero, Pete Yorn, Peter Gabriel, the ever present Sarah MacLachlan, Art Garfunkel, Dar Williams, Kendall Payne, Madonna, Radiohead, Scout, Barry Adamson, Marc Cohn) and even featuring one of the main characters, Amy Jo Johnson (""Julie"") as the performer of the opening theme of the first two seasons.",5,"I actually liked the ""infamous"" haircut...",1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,2909,"['still', 'remember', 'fuzz', 'back', '1999', 'when', 'premiering', 'second', 'season', 'hit', 'TV-show', 'Felicity', 'audiences', 'worldwide', 'were', 'shocked', 'see', 'leading', 'character', 'then', 'portrayed', 'doll-like', 'looking', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'cut', 'long', 'manes', 'exhibit', 'ultra', 'very', 'extremely', 'short', 'hairdo', 'Nobody', 'back', 'then', 'understood', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'diminished', 'boyish-looking', 'thin', 'girl', 'struggling', 'way', 'sophomore', 'year', 'fictional', 'University', 'New', 'York', 'instead', 'keeping', 'so', 'far', 'proved', 'successful', 'formula', 'super', 'model-looking', 'actress', 'struggling', 'way', 'sophomore', 'year', 'fictional', 'University', 'New', 'York.J.J', 'Abrams', 'Felicity', 'still', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'watching', 'old', 'eps', 'realize', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'different', 'had', ""n't"", 'Felicity', 'have', 'what', 'known', 'infamous', 'haircut', 'mainly', 'seen', 'perspective', 'haircut', 'meant', 'change', 'transformation', 'growth', 'shy', 'aimless', 'scared', 'adolescent', 'entering', 'college', 'solid', 'at-ease', 'confident', 'focused', 'young', 'woman', 'facing', 'challenges', 'come', 'growth', 'age', 'precisely', 'what', 'Felicity', 'wonder', 'how', 'such', 'short-run', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'four', 'seasons', 'still', 'cherished', 'one', 'favorites', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'wonder', 'why', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'listed', 'one', 'show', 'Executive', 'Producers', 'mean', 'time', 'audiences', 'finally', 'understood', 'what', 'Felicity', 'was', 'characters', 'show', 'convey', 'honesty', 'balance', 'truly', 'great', 'script', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Ben', 'Scott', 'Foley', 'Noel', 'Greg', 'Grungberg', 'Sean', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'Meghan', 'Tangi', 'Miller', 'Elena', 'Ian', 'Gomez', 'Javier', 'pretty', 'much', 'cast', 'are', 'perfect', 'ensamble', 'significantly', 'contribute', 'make', 'picture-perfect', 'entertainment', 'number', 'actors', 'were', 'still', 'are', 'subsequently', 'used', 'Abrams', 'different', 'projects', 'instance', 'Kevin', 'Weisman', 'tiny', 'little', 'role', 'Earl', 'Felicity', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'major', 'core', 'character', 'Abrams', 'Alias', 'pintoresque', 'Marshall', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'up', 'being', 'Marshall', 'wife', 'Alias', 'too', 'Greg', 'Grunberg', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'Sydney', 'Bristow', 'spy', 'pals', 'etc', 'course', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'impressive', 'transition', 'very', 'young', 'Jenniffer', 'Garner', 'who', 'played', 'Hannah', 'Felicity', 'award-winning', 'worldwide', 'worshipped', 'role', 'Sidney', 'Bristow', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'Alias', 'Back', 'Felicity', 'episodes', 'are', 'written', 'smart', 'warm', 'way', 'everybody', 'can', 'relate', 'music', 'simply', 'spectacular', 'Heather', 'Nova', 'Esthero', 'Pete', 'Yorn', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'ever', 'present', 'Sarah', 'MacLachlan', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Dar', 'Williams', 'Kendall', 'Payne', 'Madonna', 'Radiohead', 'Scout', 'Barry', 'Adamson', 'Marc', 'Cohn', 'even', 'featuring', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'Julie', 'performer', 'opening', 'theme', 'first', 'two', 'seasons']",N/A

601701,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLJS,Robert Moore,"[5, 6]","For some reason American television has struggled when it comes to college.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which portrayed high school life so vividly and powerfully, faltered somewhat as Buffy and Willow made the transition to UC-Sunnydale.  And the show that perhaps emulated BUFFY's high school formula best, VERONICA MARS, also was less compelling once the scene shifted to undergraduate life (though in large part this might have been because of multiple restrictions the CW placed on Rob Thomas and Co., especially in making the series focus more on standalone episodes rather than very long arcs).  I've only recently gone back and started watching FELICITY.  I can confidently say that no show has ever depicted college life as convincingly or as well as it.  I think THE GILMORE GIRLS comes a strong second, but most other shows either fail (A DIFFERENT WORLD) or use it as take off for other purposes (e.g., the funny but not particularly realistic UNDECLARED).  [For the record, I have not seen GREEK.]As is well known, FELICITY tells the story of Felicity Porter impulsively following Ben Covington, an unrequited high school crush, to NYU instead of Stanford after he writes a long entry into her high school annual.  [I'm not certain that they ever actually state that the school is NYU.  I am certain that they don't refer to it by name in the second half of Season One, but because I Netflixed this I don't have the early season discs to verify this one way or another.  But it is clearly a major university set directly on Washington Square, which fits the bill.]  I personally detested that initial premise, but it quickly moved on to transcend it by developing a strong cast of characters and exploring their life at college together.  Much of the series revolves around Felicity's interaction with Ben, with whom she develops a close friendship (though the initial romantic underpinnings remain a subtext throughout Season One), and her increasing attraction to and complex relationship with her resident assistant Noel.What I like about the show in Season One is how it -- for the most part -- avoids clich&eacute; in exploring college life.  The last season arc dealing with Ben's gambling problem seemed forced and artificial, but otherwise most of the arcs seemed natural and organic with the rest of the narratives.  There is also very real and believable character development throughout the season.  Felicity and Ben and Noel and Julie and the others are different characters at the end of the season, which is always the mark of a good show (just as a lack of character development is the mark of a bad one).  And most of the narratives are compelling and interesting, rarely resorting to melodrama.  The show continually pulls you into its stories, so that by the end of the year you feel quite invested as Felicity sits in the taxi as it comes to an end, deciding whether she is going to take a road trip across America with one guy or fly to Berlin with another.Any show whose title consists of a character's name sinks or swims depending on how well that character is portrayed.  Luckily, the producers hit a home run in casting Keri Russell in the central role.  She manages to play Felicity as both enormously likable if often believingly flawed.  She often makes mistakes, but they are the kinds of mistakes that feel all too familiar.  She is too surreally beautiful to be completely believable as someone who would experience unrequited love, but once you allow yourself to accept that initial premise, she is a wonderfully loveable yet vulnerable character.  And has anyone in the history of TV had more beautiful hair than Keri Russell in Season One?  Her cutting her hair in Season Two often shows up on lists with titles like, ""Worst Mistakes in TV History.""I'm sorry that I didn't catch this when it first was aired, but at least we have the DVDs.

It's captivating television, with a high quality level (particularly in this first season), and a bit unlike anything we've seen on television.The stories revolve around Felicity Porter, a college freshman, and her college experiences.  We watch her gain independence and knowledge of self over time.  We enjoy living through her youthful experiences and romantic entanglements, and the company of her friends.  The show has a relaxed feel to it and a subtle sense of humor.  It's highly evocative.  If Francois Truffaut had decided to invest years of his life working on a television show about a young woman's transformative college experiences, it might well have resembled this.  The cast are excellent, particularly Keri Russell as Felicity.The picture quality on these discs is great.

(After the backlash about the show being too intense, there was a noticeable shift to lighthearted. See the episode where Noel sees Ben and Felicity in the library studying and starts yelling in subtitles for proof that the show could be more than depressing.)It's writing and ensemble cast allowed it to be different than other generic teenager shows (Dawson's Creek, Beverly Hills 90210). The show looked professional (shot on film) and never wavered from being just that. Although it may have faltered a little in the following seasons - what show doesn't? - it was always one of television's best dramas.It's sad to say that if Russell never cut off all her hair in Season 2, the show may still be on.

I'm sorry that it had to come to an end but I am grateful that it can live on in dvd format.I bought Felicity: The Complete First Season on dvd the day it was released.  I had doubts over whether it was a good idea to purchase it or not... would I really make use of it, or would it just sit on the shelf after I watched it once?  But I can say I am definitely very happy with my purchase.  Right from the first episode I was hooked again.  I fell in love with all the characters all over again.  The only thing I'm not happy about is that the other seasons haven't been released and I haven't heard anything about when they will be.

601707,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B00005JLJS,Thayer,"[5, 5]","This is one of my favorite series of all time. I never saw the first season because I really started watching the series in its second season, so I was really glad when I learned last November that the almost impossible has happened, 1st season of Felicity is coming to DVD. And my love for the series just grew even more after watching the first season. Most of the very best episodes of the series is in season one.Standout episodes are The Pilot (one of the very best pilots of any series I've ever seen), Finally (my absolute favorite of all time), Gimme an O! (another all time favorite of mine), Boggled, Thanksgiving, Friends, Spooked, The Force (love this one), and of course the finale Felicity was Here. I strongly recommend the first season because really there is no single weak episode in the season 1.Keri Russell did a marvellous job, she is just perfect for the part, I cannot imagine anyone playing Felicity better than her. She is surrounded by a great supporting cast. The two Scotts are just perfect for their roles. The triangle among the three never really took the center stage this season until the finale.Amy Jo Johnson's Julie had her biggest storylines in season one (rape, birth mom) and she was great in all of them. And two of my favorite supporting casts Amanda Foreman and Tangi Miller just started to steal scenes when given the right materials. Amanda in ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Boggled"" though were small parts were just hilarious, and who can forget her box? Tangi Miller in episodes like Friends (her boyfriend cheats on her) and Assassins (hilarious and cute in here) was just fantastic. And lets not forget Ian Gomez' Javier who is just another scene stealer.Sadly the Dvd didn't have a lot of bonus features, I would really love to see the documentary on the making of the show, some interviews with the cast, or bloopers but instead we have to be contented with two commentaries by the creators on the pilot and finale. It was a very interesting commentary, definitely worth a listen. Another thing that should be noted is that a lot of music in the season 1 has been changed, since I never really watched the original airings of these epsiodes, I cant really detect the changes. But it would still be better to watch them with their original music, but hey Im just happy I was able to see the first season. So I dont feel like complaining.To wrap it up, just buy this one. This is the type of DVD whererepeated viewing is guaranteed, so it is really worth every penny.Grade: A",5,"Modern Classic, A must Have!!!",1051747200,"05 1, 2003",2003,2516,"['one', 'favorite', 'series', 'time', 'never', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'started', 'watching', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'really', 'glad', 'when', 'learned', 'last', 'November', 'almost', 'impossible', 'happened', '1st', 'season', 'Felicity', 'coming', 'DVD', 'love', 'series', 'just', 'grew', 'even', 'more', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'Most', 'very', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'Pilot', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'pilots', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Finally', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'time', 'Gim', 'O', 'time', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Boggled', 'Thanksgiving', 'Friends', 'Spooked', 'Force', 'love', 'one', 'course', 'finale', 'Felicity', 'was', 'Here', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'first', 'season', 'really', 'single', 'weak', 'episode', 'season', '1.Keri', 'Russell', 'did', 'marvellous', 'job', 'just', 'perfect', 'part', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'playing', 'Felicity', 'better', 'surrounded', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'two', 'Scotts', 'are', 'just', 'perfect', 'roles', 'triangle', 'three', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'center', 'stage', 'season', 'finale.Amy', 'Jo', 'Johnson', 'Julie', 'had', 'biggest', 'storylines', 'season', 'one', 'rape', 'birth', 'mom', 'was', 'great', 'two', 'favorite', 'supporting', 'casts', 'Amanda', 'Foreman', 'Tangi', 'Miller', 'just', 'started', 'steal', 'scenes', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'materials', 'Amanda', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Boggled', 'were', 'small', 'parts', 'were', 'just', 'hilarious', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'box', 'Tangi', 'Miller', 'episodes', 'Friends', 'boyfriend', 'cheats', 'Assassins', 'hilarious', 'cute', 'here', 'was', 'just', 'fantastic', 'not', 'forget', 'Ian', 'Gomez', 'Javier', 'who', 'just', 'scene', 'stealer.Sadly', 'Dvd', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'bonus', 'features', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'see', 'documentary', 'making', 'show', 'interviews', 'cast', 'bloopers', 'instead', 'have', 'be', 'contented', 'two', 'commentaries', 'creators', 'pilot', 'finale', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'definitely', 'listen', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'lot', 'music', 'season', '1', 'been', 'changed', 'never', 'really', 'watched', 'original', 'airings', 'epsiodes', 'cant', 'really', 'detect', 'changes', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'better', 'watch', 'original', 'music', 'hey', 'Im', 'just', 'happy', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'first', 'season', 'dont', 'feel', 'complaining.To', 'wrap', 'up', 'just', 'buy', 'one', 'type', 'DVD', 'whererepeated', 'viewing', 'guaranteed', 'really', 'worth', 'penny.Grade']",N/A

Felicity struggled with her destiny - choosing a major that she loved, rather than one her parents' had chosen for her.
