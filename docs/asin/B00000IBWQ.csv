502665,A1TKCUJFJ8MPC,B00000IBWQ,Anastasia,"[2, 2]","Although the first half was comical, this is where the drama sets in.  When I bought the VHS version, we took our time buying the first half of the set.  When it got more serious, we started buying almost three at a time (my mother and sister was helping my brother and I out with it).At the second half, Yui and Miaka are now priestesses of Two of the Four Gods (Miaka: Suzaku, and Yui: Seiryu).  The most significant warrior in their corner are Tamahome (who's become a BIG softie) and Nakago (who's a cold-hearted [...]).  They are warring against each other because...of Tamahome, among the issue of being neglected in Yui's time of need.  I'm not giving away any more spoilers now.  The mood in this one is a lot darker than in the first half (of course).If you are a tenderhearted viewer, and rooted for the Suzaku warriors, like I did (you had no choice really)...please keep a tissue handy.  I felt sorry for some of the Seiryu warriors because of their hard pasts (and didn't for the ones that had lived before because they had no age limit or are gay).  I can't believe I still get misty-eyed every time I think of it!  You'd think that after 4 years I'd have gotten over it, but...I guess not!  Not completely, anyway!In order to fight for the better good, some people are killed and sacrificed in order to prove/provoke something to someone--and in my case, for character development and a juicier story. Let me stop here, before I give anything else away!  I'm letting you know that the series is that good!If you liked the first half of this series, you'll like the second half even more because of the suspense.  Note to all: if you watch this half, keep the viewing down to a minimum.  When I watched it, I could only watch (at most) a tape at a time.  That's three episodes.  If it was a traumatic (read: emotionally draining) episode, then it was only two.This half is for kids over the age of 13, because of mature situations.  Reminder: keep the hankies handy.

502667,A3IOL528UTH7IL,B00000IBWQ,J. A. Stickles,"[9, 9]","...This is the best anime series I have ever seen.  The first season of the show or the Suzaku box set was very light-weight compared to the Seiryu box set (second season).  The first disk of the Seiryu set has the best episodes of the entire series.  Thankfully, they included Nuriko as the center character of the series at this point in the show.  He is my favorite of all of the characters, you can say I am mildly obsessed with him.  He truly is Miaka's best friend out the the Celestial Seven.  He is there for Miaka when Tamahome visits his family, and is there to comfort Miaka and her heart break.  He opens up to Miaka and Tamahome, the only two who truly know who he is, and why.  For those who've seen the show, he's a transvestite, who loves Hotohori, but there's a very interesting twist in the first disk of the second series that is left to interpereation.  He also is there to counsel both Miaka and Tamahome yet again when their future is at a cross-roads.  Unfortunately, for those who've seen it, we know what happens, and from personal experience, it's the hardest disk to watch, because of the inevitible scene.  I cry EVERY SINGLE TIME I WATCH that episode!  It's so heart breaking, you just ask ""why does it have to happen?""As for the rest of the second season, it's fantastic, better than the first, and that's saying a lot, because it's such a magnificent series, all around.  There is far more character interaction, and we discover more about the Suzaku Seven as the series progresses.  The undeniable love that the characters have for one another is incredbily touching.  Nothing can shake the bond between the characters, not even death.  The Seiryu set is far more dramatic and gut-renching than the first.  The interaction between the two worlds come to a head on war, and the love and respect between Miaka and Tamahome is always put to the test.The Seiryu Seven become more evolved into the plot, with a few of the warriors setting some rather dark moods.  Nakago is an unbelievably fantastic villain, who continues to minipulate Yui (Miaka's best friend and worst enemy) with every word and action.  You feel bad for him once you witness the very end, for you realize where this ultra-secretive warrior is coming from.I trust that anime fans will love this series, although it is rather long.  The series end is predictable, and was left open for the third season, which never happened, and instead the OVA was introduced a little later.  But this is a fantastic series, perfect for all ages.  I guarentee all will love it, for everything that it has, love, drama, action, comedy and magic.  The magic is in many forms, it'll make you believe in the power of love and friendship.",5,Shove it up The Butts of Critics,1047600000,"03 14, 2003",2003,2714,"['best', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'Suzaku', 'box', 'set', 'was', 'very', 'light-weight', 'compared', 'Seiryu', 'box', 'set', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'disk', 'Seiryu', 'set', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'Thankfully', 'included', 'Nuriko', 'center', 'character', 'series', 'point', 'show', 'favorite', 'characters', 'can', 'say', 'am', 'mildly', 'obsessed', 'truly', 'Miaka', 'best', 'friend', 'Celestial', 'Seven', 'there', 'Miaka', 'when', 'Tamahome', 'family', 'there', 'comfort', 'Miaka', 'heart', 'break', 'up', 'Miaka', 'Tamahome', 'only', 'two', 'who', 'truly', 'know', 'who', 'why', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'show', 'transvestite', 'who', 'Hotohori', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'first', 'disk', 'second', 'series', 'left', 'interpereation', 'also', 'there', 'counsel', 'Miaka', 'Tamahome', 'yet', 'again', 'when', 'future', 'cross-roads', 'Unfortunately', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'what', 'personal', 'experience', 'hardest', 'disk', 'watch', 'inevitible', 'scene', 'cry', 'SINGLE', 'TIME', 'WATCH', 'episode', 'so', 'heart', 'breaking', 'just', 'ask', 'why', 'have', 'happen', 'rest', 'second', 'season', 'fantastic', 'better', 'first', 'saying', 'lot', 'such', 'magnificent', 'series', 'around', 'far', 'more', 'character', 'interaction', 'discover', 'more', 'Suzaku', 'Seven', 'series', 'undeniable', 'love', 'characters', 'have', 'one', 'incredbily', 'touching', 'Nothing', 'can', 'shake', 'bond', 'characters', 'not', 'even', 'death', 'Seiryu', 'set', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'gut-renching', 'first', 'interaction', 'two', 'worlds', 'come', 'head', 'war', 'love', 'respect', 'Miaka', 'Tamahome', 'always', 'put', 'test.The', 'Seiryu', 'Seven', 'become', 'more', 'evolved', 'plot', 'few', 'warriors', 'setting', 'rather', 'dark', 'moods', 'Nakago', 'unbelievably', 'fantastic', 'villain', 'who', 'minipulate', 'Yui', 'Miaka', 'best', 'friend', 'worst', 'enemy', 'word', 'action', 'feel', 'bad', 'once', 'witness', 'very', 'end', 'realize', 'where', 'ultra-secretive', 'warrior', 'coming', 'from.I', 'trust', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'series', 'rather', 'long', 'series', 'end', 'predictable', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'third', 'season', 'never', 'happened', 'instead', 'OVA', 'was', 'introduced', 'little', 'later', 'fantastic', 'series', 'perfect', 'ages', 'guarentee', 'will', 'love', 'everything', 'love', 'drama', 'action', 'comedy', 'magic', 'magic', 'many', 'forms', ""'ll"", 'make', 'believe', 'power', 'love', 'friendship']",N/A

502669,A2W4BX2P3AKDIC,B00000IBWQ,K McK,"[0, 0]","I should probably first mention that I always watch anime in Japanese with subtitles, so that may be affecting my review. I've certainly noticed that many things which would be incredibly annoying if heard in English, are far less annoying when heard in Japanese. :)Plot and characterization-wise, I enjoyed part 2 far more than part 1 (as evidenced by the fact that I've watched part 1 only once, and part 2... more than once).I like angst, though. If you don't like angst, you're not going to like this set. At all. There is much, much death and sadness and pain and more death in this set. Lots of tears.Also, I prefer this set because I'm a fan of the Seiryuu twins. Will say nothing more on this subject for fear of spoilers. :)And finally... I think the plot is much more intricate and interesting in this set. In the first set, there was just a quest to find some people, who all then just... showed up. Not particularly interesting. This set, OTOH, has far more plots and intrigues, plus some further character insights into Chichiri, Nuriko, Tamahome, the twins, and even Nakago. Miaka grows into somebody stronger, more mature, and selfless (although she never really loses her innate foolishness, and unfortunately, she never loses the tendancy to scream Tamahome's name over and over).Anyway, overall, I felt this was a very good conclusion to the story, and even an improvement on the first half.

502671,A1UXEIZAWN2VM7,B00000IBWQ,"""monkeys_and_anime""","[5, 14]","This is not a bad series but It's not that great in my opinion either. It has good things going for it like humor. Oh and I mean this is really laugh out loud funny, fall out of your seat funny. It has nice art (though they seemed to cut back on expenses for all the extra people walking the streets. I mean simple shapes that look like people and are colored in with one solid dull color, minus any shading and detail) but the main characters are drawn quite well.The story I would say is about average. Interesting while you watch it, to the point where you gotta know what'll happen next, but after the whole things done, not as great anymore. It's like you think about it afterwards and wonder what was so appealing about it in the first place.There are also very likeable and dislikable people in this show. The most likeable in my opinion being the Celestial Warriors Hotohori, Tasuki, Nuriko (bless his gay little heart), and even Chichiri too. These guys are sooo hilarious, they are what keep the show watchable. Hotohori is really sweet and you almost wish Miaka will like him instead of Tamahome just so he can be happy. Tasuki is funny and it's cute seeing what a big heart he has as he shows more of his kinder side throughout the show. Nuriko is cool too because she oops,I mean he, was really annoying at first and no one liked him and yet suddenly managed to make make everyone love him. Chichiri is just plain funny.As for dislikable people there is Miaka who is just plain stupid, yeah her ditzyness is humorous at first but then you just realize ""wow what an idiot"" Then the genious Yuu Watase says "" I think I'll make every male character in the show fall in love with her, even the gay guy."" Okay whatever floats your boat I guess. Then there is her friend Yui who u feel really bad for, for about two episodes, then you just want to smack her and yell ""Just get on with your life u big baby geez!!"". Oh and let's not forget the sorry excuse for a man, Tamahome, who goes from being a plain jerk to Miaka to a blubbering, love smitten, overly obsessed weirdo.I also feel that much like CLAMP Yuu Watase is a complete sadist. She makes the absolute worst things happen to her characters so that you just feel terrible for them. When u think about it though, it's like she is depending on you to like her characters based on pity rather tahn any actual talent on her part to make them aggreeable personality wise.I also thought it was funny how she is obsessed with Tamahome and everyone seeing Miaka naked. ""oh no Tamahome, don't go in there, Miaka is changing. Oh no don't look Miaka is taking a bath. Uh oh Tamahome, Miaka's clothes are wet, let's make her strip for everyone. Oh look Miaka's clothes fell off again."" Yup sounds like Yuu Watase's work alright.So basically I didn't really love this show. True a few annoying characters shouldn't mess up a series for you but it did for me. Other people appently like it so I guess it depends on how easily annoyed you are. The subtitled version is teh best way to go for this show. The Japanese actors do a great job.
