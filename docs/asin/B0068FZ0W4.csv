The 1934 version is even more dated but saved by a beautiful performance by Louise Beavers as Delilah. Had times been different she might have beat Halle to the Oscar by some 70 years instead of being relegated to 5th billing. Even more daring for a 1934 film was Fredi Washington who plays Beavers' daughter who is light skinned and wants to pass.  Critics dismissed the 1959 remake as just a Lana Turner glitzy weeper but now is considered a masterpiece.  The role of Delilah (renamed Annie) is now played by Juanita Moore who fared better by at least getting an Oscar nomination.  And again she carries the picture.

1513312,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0068FZ0W4,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","This double sided (no, it's not a two DVD set) has both versions of Imitation of Life--the original film from 1934 and the remake with the same name from 1959. Many reviewers have commented on both with a great deal of insight and they deserve praise for this. Both movies have plots that move along well; I wasn't ever bored and the acting in both is generally rather good although the 1959 film is a bit over the top with the exception of Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner who do a great job. I liked the cinematography and the choreography in each film, too.There are a few changes to the plot in the 1959 version which primarily reflect how African-Americans had progressed although certainly their progress as of 1959 is embarrassingly dated by today's standards. In the original film from 1934, a white widowed woman (Claudette Colbert) with a little girl takes in a black woman ""mammy figure"" (Delilah Johnson played by Louise Beaver) with a very light skinned black daughter whose father was quite light skinned himself; and the same goes for the remake. However, in the remake the white widowed woman (Lana Turner with Sandra Dee playing her daughter as a teenager) gets rich by breaking though in acting while in the original film the white woman teams up with the African-American woman to make pancake ingredients that are nothing short of wonderful. Anyhow, in both versions of the film the two woman become close friends, and well off (the black woman in the 1959 remake is paid well for her services around the house).However, some of the similarities stop there. In the 1959 remake, the daughter of the African-American woman (Juanita Moore as widowed Annie Johnson with Susan Kohner playing her teenage daughter Sarah Jane) is much more vocal and overtly angry about being black; Sarah Jane runs away every chance she gets to avoid her black mother and ""pass"" for white. True, the light skinned black daughter does the same in the 1934 version but her performance is very much toned down, probably to please the production code and audiences of the day, and the 1934 film has to rely more on the black woman's grief for its emotional impact. However, the ending of the 1959 version is incredibly emotional!Claudette Colbert gives the better performance as the white woman while Juanita Moore's 1959 performance as the African-American widow/""mammy figure"" is unforgettably real and heartrending especially near the end of the film. Fredi Washington also gives a great performance as the light skinned daughter of Juanita Moore but kudos also goes to Susan Kohner--her anger and vast range of emotions are exceptionally believable and that's remarkable.  In addition, both Warren William and John Gavin play Steve Archer, the white woman's boyfriend, with panache.Another important aspect of the plot that remains the same in both versions is that the white woman's daughter also falls for their mother's boyfriend Steve Archer; Sandra Dee and Rochelle Hudson both turn out fine performances as the teenage daughter of the white woman.I recommend this double sided DVD with both versions of Imitation of Life for fans of the actors in these movies; and people who appreciate five star quality dramas will not be disappointed. Moreover, people who want to see how time and motion picture production codes shaped the plot-lines will appreciate comparing and contrasting these two versions of the film.",5,"""Don't you believe in chasing rainbows?""",1363651200,"03 19, 2013",2013,3412,"['double', 'sided', 'not', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'versions', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'original', 'film', '1934', 'remake', 'same', 'name', '1959', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'great', 'deal', 'insight', 'deserve', 'praise', 'movies', 'have', 'plots', 'move', 'along', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'ever', 'bored', 'acting', 'generally', 'rather', 'good', '1959', 'film', 'bit', 'top', 'exception', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'who', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'plot', '1959', 'version', 'primarily', 'reflect', 'how', 'African-Americans', 'had', 'progressed', 'certainly', 'progress', '1959', 'embarrassingly', 'dated', 'today', 'standards', 'original', 'film', '1934', 'white', 'widowed', 'woman', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'little', 'girl', 'black', 'woman', 'mammy', 'figure', 'Delilah', 'Johnson', 'played', 'Louise', 'Beaver', 'very', 'light', 'skinned', 'black', 'daughter', 'father', 'was', 'quite', 'light', 'skinned', 'same', 'remake', 'However', 'remake', 'white', 'widowed', 'woman', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'playing', 'daughter', 'teenager', 'rich', 'breaking', 'acting', 'while', 'original', 'film', 'white', 'woman', 'teams', 'up', 'African-American', 'woman', 'make', 'pancake', 'ingredients', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'wonderful', 'Anyhow', 'versions', 'film', 'two', 'woman', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'well', 'black', 'woman', '1959', 'remake', 'paid', 'well', 'services', 'house', '.However', 'similarities', 'stop', 'there', '1959', 'remake', 'daughter', 'African-American', 'woman', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'widowed', 'Annie', 'Johnson', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'playing', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'much', 'more', 'vocal', 'overtly', 'angry', 'being', 'black', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'away', 'chance', 'avoid', 'black', 'mother', 'pass', 'white', 'True', 'light', 'skinned', 'black', 'daughter', 'same', '1934', 'version', 'performance', 'very', 'much', 'toned', 'down', 'probably', 'please', 'production', 'code', 'audiences', 'day', '1934', 'film', 'rely', 'more', 'black', 'woman', 'grief', 'emotional', 'impact', 'However', 'ending', '1959', 'version', 'incredibly', 'emotional', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'better', 'performance', 'white', 'woman', 'Juanita', 'Moore', '1959', 'performance', 'African-American', 'widow/', 'mammy', 'figure', 'unforgettably', 'real', 'heartrending', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'Fredi', 'Washington', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'light', 'skinned', 'daughter', 'Juanita', 'Moore', 'kudos', 'also', 'Susan', 'Kohner', 'anger', 'vast', 'range', 'emotions', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'believable', 'remarkable', 'addition', 'Warren', 'William', 'John', 'Gavin', 'play', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'white', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'panache.Another', 'important', 'aspect', 'plot', 'same', 'versions', 'white', 'woman', 'daughter', 'also', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'Steve', 'Archer', 'Sandra', 'Dee', 'Rochelle', 'Hudson', 'turn', 'out', 'fine', 'performances', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'white', 'woman.I', 'recommend', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'versions', 'Imitation', 'Life', 'fans', 'actors', 'movies', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'five', 'star', 'quality', 'dramas', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Moreover', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'time', 'motion', 'picture', 'production', 'codes', 'shaped', 'plot-lines', 'will', 'appreciate', 'comparing', 'contrasting', 'two', 'versions', 'film']",N/A
1513313,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B0068FZ0W4,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[37, 39]","This set contains the original 1934 and the remake of a movie that, in both releases, was considered to be socially groundbreaking.I am not going to review the two movies because the reviews on their respective product pages to which I have provided links are far more articulate than I can ever be. Instead, I am going to compare and contrast the original and the remake and give some reasons why the films are historically significant and groundbreaking.The 1934 movie,Imitation of Life (1934), is based on and substantially follows Fanny Hurst's 1933 novel titledImitation of Life.  The usual Hollywood liberties are taken when transforming a novel into a screen play. The 1959 remake,Imitation of Life, differs significantly in detail (the original characters have different names, meet under different circumstances, and the successes enjoyed by one of the main characters comes from a different avenue.)However, while the details differ between the two films, the themes are the same, and the context the storylines are closely aligned to the eras in which the movies were made.The basic themes are race relations, the meaning of being Black in American society, and women breaking barriers.The 1934 version was the first film to humanize black Americans by portraying the characters as human beings who have feelings, aspirations and strong family ties (and challenges). Prior to (and after for decades to be honest) movies marginalized African Americans by portraying them as caricatures or stereotypes. More importantly, there was an obvious affection between and among the main characters of both races, which - in itself - was groundbreaking in the era.To be sure, there was racist stereotyping in the movie, including making the main black character into a ""mammie"" figure, complete with the dialect and mannerisms. Remember that this era was less than 70 years after the abolition of slavery and most white Americans were either blind to the impact on society and the nation as a whole, or were clinging to old illusions about how blacks could not take care of themselves. Considering the fact that the Motion Picture Production Code was trying to prevent the movie from being released the balance between portraying blacks as humans and the racial stereotyping tilts (in my opinion) towards this being a movie that raised consciousness and questions about race relations.The reason the Motion Picture Production Code did not want to release the movie is because of another aspect in the story: the daughter of the black main character was light skinned and made attempts to ""pass for white"" throughout the story. This implied that she had a white father, which was against most state laws at the time of filming (as unbelievable as it seems today). This aspect of the story adds another dimension to being a black American and is woven into the story. Interestingly, the woman who played the daughter, Fredi Washington, could have had a stellar career had she agreed to pass for white in real life, but refused - the exact opposite of her character, and an admirable stand for the era.For the above reasons, plus the cinematography and other factors, the original version was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2005.The 1959 remake ofImitation of Lifehas major differences in details from the 1934 original, but the storyline is substantially the same. Among the differences in details is the main characters (the mothers and daughters) have different names than in the novel and original screenplay, and the white mother's success comes from some breaks in acting versus being given a secret family recipe by the black main character, which results in a multi-million dollar business. One reason for that change from the original is the era in which this version was made, there had been some major improvements in civil rights (still far short of equal rights), and in 1959 it was possible for a black woman to achieve success in business, making the original plot weak.However, the race relations and the meaning of being black in American society are still major themes. It is interesting to contrast the way those were presented in the original and this remake because there were some substantial differences in the ensuing 25 years. And, of course, the friendship between and among the main characters was still ahead of the time, despite some subtle stereotyping.In both films, too, the fact that a woman had avenues of success on her own were powerful messages. And the mother-daughter relationships in both sets of main characters were also powerful studies in both films.Features: the 1934 film has an interesting commentary, as does the 1959 remake. On the DVD containing the 1959 remake is a feature titled Making of Imitation of Life that is an informative discussion of both movies and their historical significance, as well as some interesting facts that focus on the 1959 remake.

All I knew is that I wanted to see it from beginning to end. I ended up seeing it, as well as the 1934 version,which was a bit hard to get until now. In the 1934 version, Claudette Colbert was trying to sell her syrup and happened to luck up on Louise Beavers and her near white daughter looking for work, and had a perfect pancake recipe for her maple syrup. Colbert eventually becomes a success, even offering Beavers a percentage of the riches, which she declines. In the 1959 version, Lana Turner is a widow trying to break into show business when she's in Coney Island and loses her daughter Susie but finds her with Juanita Moore and again her light skinned daughter. Turner, feeling sorry for Moore, who has nowhere to go, takes in the two, eventually becomes a star, with Annie by her side, yet neglects her daughter Susie, who turns to Annie, meanwhile Sarah Jane, Annie's daughter is hell bent on being white, which means rejecting her mother, and things between them unravels.

1513333,A2E330I8TKW4C1,B0068FZ0W4,WSH,"[4, 7]","This DVD is worth having for the 1934 version, which is well written, acted and directed. The 1959 version, which is none of these things, is purely of historical interest. And the historical interest is this: if these films are anything to go by, in the 25 years between them race relations and the filming-making craft in America both went into reverse. Concentrating on the treatment of race for a moment, while the rabbit's foot and the 'will to death' cliches about African Americans have gone out of the story by 1959, opportunities and recognition for their race are seemingly more elusive than before. The Annie character, in the earlier film, is a business partner (albeit an unequal one, a '20%er') of her white friend; in the latter version, she is no more than her maid and occasional confidante. In the 1934 version, Annie's daughter conforms to the 'tragic mulatto' stereotype but retains personal dignity; in the 1959 version, she conforms to the 'promiscuous mixed-blood' stereotype and ends in the gutter. Both scripts struggle to interconnect the relationship between the ambitious white woman and her daughter and the relationship of the black woman and her daughter, in terms of dramatic action, thematic content and comparative time on screen. Although the films place both relationships under the one roof, they run largely in parallel: problems of 'white folks' and problems of 'black folks' are perceived to be so separate. The latter version does worse in this regard. At least the 1934 version tries to bridge the gap by having the Claudette Colbert character go in search of the runaway Sarah Anne. Lana Turner's character just pitches in a few trite comments. This lack of emotional commitment robs the final scene in the 1959 film of any of the power that is present in the earlier version when Colbert goes to comfort Annie's daughter at the hearse. With its undistinguished supporting cast, a terrible score and sometimes laughable dialogue, the remake would, I suspect, have disappeared from critical discussion had it not been for its 'controversial' subject-matter and the star pull of an ageing Turner. The extras on the DVD earn it no extra stars.",4,"One good, one bad",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2183,"['DVD', 'worth', 'having', '1934', 'version', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', '1959', 'version', 'none', 'things', 'purely', 'historical', 'interest', 'historical', 'interest', 'films', 'are', 'anything', 'go', '25', 'years', 'race', 'relations', 'filming-making', 'craft', 'America', 'went', 'reverse', 'Concentrating', 'treatment', 'race', 'moment', 'rabbit', 'foot', ""'will"", 'death', 'cliches', 'African', 'Americans', 'have', 'gone', 'story', '1959', 'opportunities', 'recognition', 'race', 'are', 'seemingly', 'more', 'elusive', 'before', 'Annie', 'character', 'earlier', 'film', 'business', 'partner', 'unequal', 'one', ""'20"", '%', 'white', 'friend', 'latter', 'version', 'more', 'maid', 'occasional', 'confidante', '1934', 'version', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'conforms', ""'tragic"", 'mulatto', 'stereotype', 'personal', 'dignity', '1959', 'version', ""'promiscuous"", 'mixed-blood', 'stereotype', 'gutter', 'scripts', 'struggle', 'interconnect', 'relationship', 'ambitious', 'white', 'woman', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'black', 'woman', 'daughter', 'terms', 'dramatic', 'action', 'thematic', 'content', 'comparative', 'time', 'screen', 'films', 'place', 'relationships', 'one', 'roof', 'run', 'largely', 'parallel', 'problems', ""'white"", 'folks', 'problems', ""'black"", 'folks', 'are', 'perceived', 'be', 'so', 'separate', 'latter', 'version', 'worse', 'regard', 'least', '1934', 'version', 'tries', 'bridge', 'gap', 'having', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'character', 'go', 'search', 'runaway', 'Sarah', 'Anne', 'Lana', 'Turner', 'character', 'just', 'pitches', 'few', 'trite', 'comments', 'lack', 'emotional', 'commitment', 'final', 'scene', '1959', 'film', 'power', 'present', 'earlier', 'version', 'when', 'Colbert', 'comfort', 'Annie', 'daughter', 'hearse', 'undistinguished', 'supporting', 'cast', 'terrible', 'score', 'sometimes', 'laughable', 'dialogue', 'remake', 'would', 'suspect', 'have', 'disappeared', 'critical', 'discussion', 'had', 'not', 'been', ""'controversial"", 'subject-matter', 'star', 'pull', 'ageing', 'Turner', 'extras', 'DVD', 'earn', 'extra', 'stars']",N/A
