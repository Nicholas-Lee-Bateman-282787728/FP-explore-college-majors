620988,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JMQW,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[0, 0]","""Spiderman 2"" makes ""Spiderman"" seem like a warm-up.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his alter-ego, Spiderman, have enough problems to make the movie continually interesting.  The melodrama envelops our attention, and the action scenes are marvelous.In the beginning Peter Parker sets his sights on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but he's conflicted by his role as Spiderman.  He not only juggles his identities, but his responsibilities as well.  As college student and breadwinner, he stumbles with all of his relationships, including with his aunt and his best friend.  Ironically, this friend has connections with a scientist who can be the key to Peter's success.  When the scientist presents an innovative energy invention, his demonstration goes awry.  It turns the scientist into a monster, Dr. Oct., with barely a will of his own.""Spiderman 2"" is a substantial movie because, unlike similar superhero movies, we remain interested and are often at the edge of our seats.  Frequently many hero figures vanquish their opponents too early or too often, but Spiderman has many problems and an incredible adversary.  In the story, the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane is likable, and Dr. Oct. is certainly menacing enough.  The supporting roles are effective, too.  The portrayal of Peter's Aunt is endearing, and his newspaper editor boss provides an entertaining caricature.  His relationship with his friend provides good connections and variety to the plot.  Screenwriter Alvin Sargent (who won an Oscar for ""Ordinary People"") gives the screenplay the right touches, and director Sam Raimi is an expert for leading us along this great adventure.  ""Spiderman 2"" has the look and feel of a flawless comic book hero classic.",5,Sticks with You the Second Time Around,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,1738,"['Spiderman', '2', 'Spiderman', 'seem', 'warm-up', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'alter-ego', 'Spiderman', 'have', 'enough', 'problems', 'make', 'movie', 'continually', 'interesting', 'melodrama', 'attention', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'beginning', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'sights', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'conflicted', 'role', 'Spiderman', 'not', 'only', 'identities', 'responsibilities', 'as', 'well', 'college', 'student', 'breadwinner', 'relationships', 'including', 'aunt', 'best', 'friend', 'Ironically', 'friend', 'connections', 'scientist', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'key', 'Peter', 'success', 'When', 'scientist', 'innovative', 'energy', 'invention', 'demonstration', 'awry', 'scientist', 'monster', 'Dr.', 'Oct.', 'barely', 'will', 'own', 'Spiderman', '2', 'substantial', 'movie', 'similar', 'superhero', 'movies', 'remain', 'interested', 'are', 'often', 'edge', 'seats', 'Frequently', 'many', 'hero', 'figures', 'vanquish', 'opponents', 'too', 'early', 'too', 'often', 'Spiderman', 'many', 'problems', 'incredible', 'adversary', 'story', 'chemistry', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'likable', 'Dr.', 'Oct.', 'certainly', 'menacing', 'enough', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'effective', 'too', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Aunt', 'endearing', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'boss', 'entertaining', 'caricature', 'relationship', 'friend', 'good', 'connections', 'variety', 'plot', 'Screenwriter', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'screenplay', 'right', 'touches', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'expert', 'leading', 'great', 'adventure', 'Spiderman', '2', 'look', 'feel', 'flawless', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'classic']",Spider-Man 2

But I will honestly say out of the countless superhero films I have seen: this is, without a doubt, the best.What seperates Spider Man 2, a sequel no less, from its counterpart and all of the other fx crazed superhero movies hollywood has to offer? Simply put, it takes its time. It pauses for a breath and dwells on the human side of Spider Man. He is after all, Peter Parker beneath the mask. He is a human being full of emotional weakness' with physical and spiritual longings. There's love pounding at his hearts door and he doesn't know what to do with it.The villain this time around is a caring professor that loves what he does and has a tender heart for education and furthering the betterment of man. Only when he is ""possessed"" by his creation is he a villain. He wasn't heading that way in the first place like Willem Defoe in part one. I found myself, as many others, feeling sorry for him, and hoping all the way through that he too will be saved.Sam Raimi took hold of the reins with the same ambition of his original films, the Evil Dead series. Like the saga or not, you could see the fun they were having all the way through. Now it seems, he has developed the same sincerity towards Spiderman.Spiderman 2 rests on common ground, then stands tall, rising uniquely over the rest.

The Batman movies were never anything specail to me (especialy since the first one was the only good one) and the Superman movies flat out sucked (no disrespect to chris reves R.I.P.) But in 2002 the Spider-Man movie rocked the comic book movie universe, and fufilled a promise hollywood made to me when i was about 8.When Spider-Man 2 came out, my expectations were high. and They were beyond surpassed! The story telling is fantastic. No fan boy should be disapointed here. It the right balence of action, and drama! The storys are half of what always drew me to Spider-Man over any other super hero. The fact that Peter Parker is just a normal kid who was give extraordinary powers. He's not some millionaire who lives in a made up city, or some alien from a made up planet )protecting some other made up city. Spider-Man was a normal guy, who lived in my city. And this movie sure doesn't forget that.The story deals with the paraleling worlds of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. His reactions and discions are extreamly human. What would any of us do if we became over whelmed with life and had super powers?This movie has something for everyone of all ages. Action, Drama, Comedy, Romance, and so much more. Spider-Man 2 did me, and every fan justice and made us feel it was worth waiting all those years.Oh! and the bonus features are great! I got an advance copy recently.

One wasn't this good and I only hope that Three will be as great (date is 4/4/08 and I'm still on my way to watch it).Mary Jane is his love interest again, and she's married.

620995,AZSN1TO0JI87B,B00005JMQW,A. Estes,"[4, 5]","I knew it was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be THIS good. ""Spider-Man 2"" is everything a sequel of it's caliber should add up too: better special effects, breath-taking action sequences and a deeper story-line. ""Spider-Man 2"" succeeds at respecting and building off of the story established in the first movie. Two years later, and Peter Parker is struggling to keep his head above water. His obligations to his alter-ego, Spider-Man, keep him from holding a steady job, making ends meet, keeping in touch with family and friends, and most importantly: being with the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson. As Peter starts to doubt himself, his abilities start waning away, and he finds himself conflicted and forced to make the choice of saving the world, or living a happy life. To make matters worse, a new super-villian is on a the loose by the name of Dr. Octopus, a respected scientist controlled by his own invention. The stakes in this movie are raised really high and the result is a more powerful and gripping film than the first one. So, yes, ""Spider-Man 2"" is better than the original, which is quite an accomplishment considering the standards it set. Sam Raimi's vision and passion for the material oozes through with each scene. Raimi is easily the most underrated director of the moment. Each scene is played to perfection, and all of the actors have grown into their characters a bit more, especially Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) and James Franco (Harry), both of whom give much more dimension to seemingly peripherral characters. Tobey Maguire shines through in this one, with an improved performance (looking and acting less and less like Keanu Reeves kid-brother) and Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as always. Considering this is a monstrous Hollywood block-buster of the grandest sorts and will no doubt break records throughout the summer, ""Spider-Man 2"" is intelligent and fun at the same time. Everyone who has interest in it will walk away happy, fully satisfied -- and most importantly -- salivating for what the inevitable ""Spider-Man 3"" will bring us.",5,"""Isn't it about time someone saved your life?""",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2092,"['knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'THIS', 'good', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'everything', 'sequel', 'caliber', 'should', 'add', 'up', 'too', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'breath-taking', 'action', 'sequences', 'deeper', 'story-line', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'respecting', 'building', 'story', 'established', 'first', 'movie', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'struggling', 'keep', 'head', 'water', 'obligations', 'alter-ego', 'Spider-Man', 'keep', 'holding', 'steady', 'job', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'keeping', 'touch', 'family', 'friends', 'most', 'importantly', 'being', 'love', 'life', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Peter', 'doubt', 'abilities', 'start', 'waning', 'away', 'conflicted', 'forced', 'make', 'choice', 'saving', 'world', 'living', 'happy', 'life', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'new', 'super-villian', 'loose', 'name', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'respected', 'scientist', 'controlled', 'own', 'invention', 'stakes', 'movie', 'are', 'raised', 'really', 'high', 'result', 'more', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'So', 'yes', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'better', 'original', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'considering', 'standards', 'set', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'vision', 'passion', 'material', 'scene', 'Raimi', 'easily', 'most', 'underrated', 'director', 'moment', 'scene', 'played', 'perfection', 'actors', 'have', 'grown', 'characters', 'bit', 'more', 'especially', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Aunt', 'May', 'James', 'Franco', 'Harry', 'whom', 'give', 'much', 'more', 'dimension', 'seemingly', 'peripherral', 'characters', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'shines', 'one', 'improved', 'performance', 'looking', 'acting', 'less', 'less', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'kid-brother', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'fantastic', 'always', 'Considering', 'monstrous', 'Hollywood', 'block-buster', 'grandest', 'sorts', 'will', 'doubt', 'break', 'records', 'summer', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'intelligent', 'fun', 'same', 'time', 'Everyone', 'who', 'interest', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'happy', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'most', 'importantly', 'salivating', 'what', 'inevitable', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'will', 'bring']",Spider-Man 2

Gammill,"[4, 6]","NOTE: This review is for SPIDER-MAN 2.1 Extended Cut.I wouldn't have thought it possible, but the best superhero movie just got even better, with 8 minutes of restored footage.  Sure, 8 minutes doesn't sound like much.  But most of the additions are subtle--a few lines of dialogue which extend existing scenes.  Most of them make sense, especially (SPOILERS AHEAD) those which evoke better understanding of/sympathy for certain characters, and a few which are strictly for laughs.  In fact, it's hard to believe that what is arguably the funniest moment in the film was left on the cutting room floor.  I won't spoil it, but it's a real treat for fans of J. Jonah Jameson.I realize that the timing of this release coincides with the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3.  So what?  Sam Raimi has made 2 (maybe 3?) of the most well-defined and purely entertaining comic book films ever.

620997,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JMQW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[9, 32]","I can honestly say that this was the WORST film I have seen this year.  While I had some excitement for this film, due to the amazing sequel known as X2: X-Men United, what I actually witnessed was nothing more than an unlimited budget creating some of the least creative characters in film history.  I had several friends tell me that this was one of the best ""character study"" films of the year.  That this sequel was more than just good vs. evil, but also an inner dilemma between Parker's personal lives and that which he has been called to do.  While this may have been the case, what actually translated onto the screen was a reassurance that Toby Maguire was miscast, Kirsten Dunst is loosing her sexual appeal (though Raimi felt enough self-guilt to place her in water to reveal her ""bits and pieces"" for the pre-teen in all of us), and that you can go too far with a villain creating a cartoon instead of a physically frightening creature.So, where do I begin?  At first I had hope, here we find ourselves following Peter as he attempts to get to work after noticing that he was running late.  He has just a few minutes to deliver some pizzas (oh, how the mighty do fall) or he will be fired from his job.  He apparently really needs this job, so he resorts to transforming himself into his alter-ego personality Spider-man to help him get out of the tight situation.  While we are stunned by this cheap display of his super powers, we assume that it will show that Spider-man is a crafty guy.  Immediately, we are proved wrong as Peter Parker is fired and forced to go back to his run-down apartment that he cannot afford.  Instead of showing us a hero for children to look up to, we have a guy that says to the youth of our nation, be late to work, don't pay rent, and everything will be just fine.  This is not the character that I was hoping for.  This only leads us deeper into the mind of Peter Parker as he struggles to maintain a very busy life.  Also saying to our children that if you have too much to do, please just give up.  When life throws you lemons, go ahead and cry like the babies that you are, or at least like Toby Mcguire has patented.Spider-man is not the hero for our youth.  He is not the passionate crime-fighter that we have envisioned or at least that was drawn for me in the first film.  Instead, Toby is given the possibility to ""grow"" his character and give him ""5000 dimensions"" that continually fail.  He uses the technique of huge-teary eyes to portray the struggle that is happening inside of him.  He never really feels strong.  He never really makes a decision.  He only does what the villain forces him to do.  He continually remains indecisive and weak through all moments of this film.  I lost respect of his heroine status.  I instead saw him as this whiney kid that couldn't handle the pressures of the job that he was handed.  He cries, and is wimpy instead of showing a true emotional struggle.  This only proved to me that you couldn't take an independent actor, one that prides himself on the dramatic element, and give him a role in a huge-budget film.  I once thought of this in the first film, but this sequel only proves my theory correct.This goes the same for Kirsten Dunst, who progressively became uglier throughout the film and whose bosoms fluctuated in size in nearly every shot.  She was drenched yet again for the pre-teen audience and for those that like to use the stop-motion feature on their DVD player.  She was useless, and perhaps should be replaced for the third installment to this series.  Finally, there was the unsupportive villain that seemed less ""evil"" and more like a cartoon Elmer Fudd, constantly messing up and not really causing any chaos or destruction.  He didn't frighten the people of Spider-man's city, so why should I be frightened of him?  Molina was horribly cast as Doc Ock, only proving that a large man with tons of robotic work can be evil, or at least try to be evil.Finally, I would like to say that Raimi needs to go back to his roots.  For me to ever be interested in one of his films again (especially after this sequel), I would need to see Raimi go back to his roots.  He needs less money, better scripts, and an unknown cast that can prove themselves and try something new.  All I could see in this film was the strong hold of Hollywood telling Raimi how he needs to create the film and what scenes would be needed to ensure tons of people going into the theater to give their money to these characters.  It was sad, it was poor, and it was an inexcusable issue.  Raimi is a ""cult"" film director that has eyes the size of Toby whenever money is thrown his way.  This was a very poor film.  It was exactly what Hollywood represents and the type of film that I despise.  There was no substance, no structure, and nothing exciting about this sequel.  It was, for lack of a better word, very poor.  I am embarrassed to say that I have seen this film, and will deny it whenever anyone asks.  This is my final word on this film.

The special effects are worth a viewing...they are amazing...and really show how far we have come along in the art of cinema.  But unlike numerous other superhero movies (the hulk and the punisher) the spidermans are just well-written.  The dialog is as great as the action.  The story line is engrossing and every end is tied in this installment.  Well almost everything...gotta leave some stuff for the third movie!  The casting is sensational...these actors really bring the comic book characters to life and I feel as if this movie as stayed as true as possible to the comic book story.  The villian is scary (i mean come on... that many arms is freaky!)  and the hero over comes his internal battle as well as his external ones.  But i find the humor in the movie to be just as enjoyable as anything else.  This movie has it all but above all else it is just really entertaining... if you like good story lines, comic books, special effects, love stories, action, and comedy...then you will find something to like in spiderman 2 along with the original...

The movie is packed with action, humor and emotion. It is a love story disguised as a comic book movie and it works great. Unlike most films of its ilk, it knows how to balance the action and the emotion, with well placed moments of humor, to make a film that is more complete than any popcorn film has ever been or deserves to be. Tobey Maguire fully embodies the angst-ridden hero and is the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst is great as the object of parker's affection, and James Franco expands onhis role very well.

621001,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B00005JMQW,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 2]","This is one of the few times that the sequel is better than the original movie. Now that the origin of the superhero was narrated in the first ""Spider-Man"", the creative team was free to explore new elements of the abundant universe of the comic. In few words the story is better because they used more elements this time.In ""Spider-Man 2"", Peter Parker is caught in a dilemma: he must use his powers or he must quit and resume his normal life? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a more developed character this time, she is Spidey's love interest, but she now wants to move on with or without Peter. Also Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) plays an important role in ""Spider-Man 2"", her dialogues are richer and her performance is tender and sweet, just like Aunt May in the comics.This time Harry Osborn (James Franco) is more important than just a good friend, Harry presents another dilemma to Spidey. And the villain is a big improvement over the ""Green Goblin"", Willem Dafoe was great in the first movie, but Alfred Molina as ""Doctor Octopus"" is one of the best villains in a comic-based movie. ""Spider-Man 2"" covers much more ground than the first movie.The special effects are very improved, still there are some effects that look like a videogame, but overall the visual and sound effects are convincing and help to built the action. By the way, this movie has the most incredible action sequences seen so far in a comic-based movie, the action is bigger and better.The music is more dynamic in ""Spider-Man 2"", Danny Elfman used some of the old tracks, and added new ones. The cast and the director seem more comfortable in ""Spider-Man 2"". Kirsten looks better with her new hairstyle, she was the ideal girl next door in the first movie, but now she looks like the ideal Mary Jane Watson (Parker). Tobey Maguire is as reliable as always, Alfred Molina is outstanding as Doc Ock and the rest of the cast is very solid.""Spider-Man 2"" has a little bit of everything: it has action, drama, romance, comedy, good performances, great direction by Sam Raimi, outstanding visual and sound effects, and it's better than the first one.

621003,A1TUZL12O7X1A9,B00005JMQW,Alexander G.,"[1, 2]","This is what a good summer movie should be.Spider-Man 2 transcends the boundaries of being just another comic book movie to being a richly character driven movie with a very conflicted hero. Here, for the first time, we see the actual emotion behind the facade of the hero behind the mask. Gone is the richly colorful look of the first part, here in Spider-Man 2, we are plunged into a world of shadows and off colors.Picking up two years after the first Spider-Man left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has his hands full with three full-time jobs. He is going to school full time, he is working full time to pay off his rent, and he is a hero always on call whenever he hears a siren. Not to mention, we see the emotional toll that has been taken on him, his only surviving family member, his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), has become consumed with grief and loss over the death of her husband (incidentally, creating Spider-Man in the first part), Peter's friend Norman Osborne (James Franco) is now at odds with him since he has become consumed with revenge over Spider-Man killing his father (the Green Goblin), and his love affair with Mary Jane-Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is slowly being extinguished because he is never there for her to return the feelings she has for him. And this is all in the first fifteen minutes of the film.As Spider-Man, Parker is even in danger of losing his powers as his exhaustion slowly begins to take over. Is it medical or is it because he has stretched himself too thin? Eventually, Peter decides to give up being Spider-Man to finally bring peace into his life. There is a brilliant sequence in this film when we see Parker returning to his alter-ego from the first part before the mutated spider bite as he puts on his glasses again, clouding his vision to the world around him. When he sees someone being beaten up in an alley, he turns around to walk away. When the familiar sirens fly past him again, he just eats a hot dog. In short, Parker has finally succumbed to being a New Yorker.In the midst of all of this, we see the creation of a new villain, this time in the form of a deranged scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), who has four frighteningly powerful arms welded to his spine after a disaster with his life's work. This disaster not only turns the Doctor into Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock as the papers call him), but the artificially intelligent arms seemed fuse to his id, placating his desires to not want his life's work to be a failure. Doc Ock will try again at the expense of anyone around him.The standout here is Tobey Maguire, who can convey the film's entire heart with a look or a gesture, but is most heart-wrenchingly done in his hesitations. For a man so used to having quick reflexes, when he has to slow down and realize what is going on around him, we are instantly in his head. Maguire also has to command the screen as Spider-Man and convince the audience that he can stand up to someone like Octavius and not seem fantastic.Sam Raimi also does a knock-out job as well, knowing when to hold on a character's face long enough or swinging the camera along with Spider-Man to give the audience the exhilaration of flight. Raimi is more than competent enough to give this movie the look and feel of a moving comic book and by utilizing his most signature camera shot (zooming into and out of the character's eyes), the audience is invited to live for a moment in the tights of a superhero.Spider-Man 2 has so many great messages to be heard in this film, the best of which seems to draw both Peter and Octavius together in the end: In order for the right thing to be done, does it mean that we have to put away what we want the most? In both cases, there are some strong arguments and that is what makes this movie such a surprise is the depth that it possesses. Seemingly, we have entered the bizarro world of sequels, where they seem to surpass the original (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 2, etc) and Spider-Man 2 definitely joins these ranks. Perhaps in allowing a series to expand rather than compliment the original, we can expect more depth out of movies, which has been as equally absent in this day and age as heroes as Spider-Man 2 also suggests.Blu-Ray Quality is Superb.",5,A Flawless Super Hero Movie,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,4326,"['what', 'good', 'summer', 'movie', 'should', 'be.Spider-Man', '2', 'boundaries', 'being', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'being', 'richly', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'very', 'conflicted', 'hero', 'Here', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'actual', 'emotion', 'facade', 'hero', 'mask', 'Gone', 'richly', 'colorful', 'look', 'first', 'part', 'here', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'are', 'plunged', 'world', 'shadows', 'off', 'colors.Picking', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'left', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'hands', 'full', 'three', 'full-time', 'jobs', 'going', 'school', 'full', 'time', 'working', 'full', 'time', 'pay', 'off', 'rent', 'hero', 'always', 'call', 'whenever', 'siren', 'Not', 'mention', 'see', 'emotional', 'toll', 'been', 'taken', 'only', 'surviving', 'family', 'member', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'become', 'consumed', 'grief', 'loss', 'death', 'husband', 'incidentally', 'creating', 'Spider-Man', 'first', 'part', 'Peter', 'friend', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'James', 'Franco', 'now', 'odds', 'become', 'consumed', 'revenge', 'Spider-Man', 'killing', 'father', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'love', 'affair', 'Mary', 'Jane-Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'slowly', 'being', 'extinguished', 'never', 'there', 'return', 'feelings', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film.As', 'Spider-Man', 'Parker', 'even', 'danger', 'losing', 'powers', 'exhaustion', 'slowly', 'take', 'over', 'medical', 'stretched', 'too', 'thin', 'Eventually', 'Peter', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'finally', 'bring', 'peace', 'life', 'brilliant', 'sequence', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'Parker', 'returning', 'alter-ego', 'first', 'part', 'mutated', 'spider', 'bite', 'glasses', 'again', 'clouding', 'vision', 'world', 'When', 'someone', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'alley', 'around', 'walk', 'away', 'When', 'familiar', 'sirens', 'fly', 'again', 'just', 'hot', 'dog', 'short', 'Parker', 'finally', 'succumbed', 'being', 'New', 'Yorker.In', 'midst', 'see', 'creation', 'new', 'villain', 'time', 'form', 'deranged', 'scientist', 'named', 'Doctor', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'who', 'four', 'frighteningly', 'powerful', 'arms', 'welded', 'spine', 'disaster', 'life', 'work', 'disaster', 'not', 'only', 'Doctor', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'papers', 'call', 'artificially', 'intelligent', 'arms', 'seemed', 'fuse', 'id', 'placating', 'desires', 'not', 'want', 'life', 'work', 'be', 'failure', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'will', 'try', 'again', 'expense', 'anyone', 'him.The', 'standout', 'here', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'can', 'convey', 'film', 'entire', 'heart', 'look', 'gesture', 'most', 'heart-wrenchingly', 'done', 'hesitations', 'man', 'so', 'used', 'having', 'quick', 'reflexes', 'when', 'slow', 'down', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'are', 'instantly', 'head', 'Maguire', 'also', 'command', 'screen', 'Spider-Man', 'convince', 'audience', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'someone', 'Octavius', 'not', 'seem', 'fantastic.Sam', 'Raimi', 'also', 'knock-out', 'job', 'well', 'knowing', 'when', 'hold', 'character', 'face', 'long', 'enough', 'swinging', 'camera', 'Spider-Man', 'give', 'audience', 'exhilaration', 'flight', 'Raimi', 'more', 'competent', 'enough', 'give', 'movie', 'look', 'feel', 'moving', 'comic', 'book', 'utilizing', 'most', 'signature', 'camera', 'shot', 'zooming', 'character', 'eyes', 'audience', 'invited', 'live', 'moment', 'tights', 'superhero.Spider-Man', '2', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'messages', 'be', 'heard', 'film', 'best', 'draw', 'Peter', 'Octavius', 'together', 'end', 'order', 'right', 'thing', 'be', 'done', 'mean', 'have', 'put', 'away', 'what', 'want', 'most', 'cases', 'are', 'strong', 'arguments', 'what', 'movie', 'surprise', 'depth', 'Seemingly', 'have', 'entered', 'bizarro', 'world', 'sequels', 'where', 'seem', 'surpass', 'original', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Return', 'King', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'etc', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'definitely', 'ranks', 'Perhaps', 'allowing', 'series', 'expand', 'rather', 'compliment', 'original', 'can', 'expect', 'more', 'depth', 'movies', 'been', 'equally', 'absent', 'day', 'age', 'as', 'heroes', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'also', 'suggests.Blu-Ray', 'Quality', 'Superb']",Spider-Man 2

Several decades later, I'm still enjoying the action and antics of NYC's one and only photog/arachnid.  This terrific sequel took the strengths of the first Spidey outing and built on them.Tobey Maguire is terrific as Peter and Spidey.  The humanity of Peter struggling with school, job, and love life is engaging, sad, and funny.  Kirsten Dunst, not to be outdone, brings more to Mary Jane this time around.  She loves Peter, but is not going to wait for him to make up his mind.  Alfred Molina is also fantastic as Doc Ock.  He, too, brings a real humanity to his alter ego.  As a dedicated scientist he simply can not let a lifetime of work evaporate, and is driven to take the necessary steps to see his work to its completion.  Finally, props gotta go out to JK Simmons who literally rips J Jonah Jameson from the page and breathes life into the character.Some of the comedy was a bit over the top.  Some of it was ironic, and dead-on(such as the nod to the infamous Seabiscuit injury).  All in all, a great mix of action, romance, laughs, and sheer adrenaline.  The movie isn't perfect.

The character of Peter Parker continues to grow and become a man while his friends begin to wonder about him.The story follows Peter as he and several others watch as Dr. Octavious exhibits a fusion device. Something goes wrong, and the mechanical arms Octavious was using to manipulate the fusion energy somehow become welded to his vertebrate; in addition to this the neural inhibitor at the apex of his spine is fused, thus making the fair-minded Octavious a crazed sciientist. With the loss of his wife, Octavious cares for noting but his ""science project."" Nothing will stand in his way of achieving his goals.Before and after the first engagements with Doc Ock, Peter loses his confidence and subsequently quits being Spiderman. The loss of his confidence has him wanting to be a normal person again (Similar To What We Saw In Superman II). But when he sees that the people of New York miss him and that Doc Ock must be stopped, he dons his costume (Stealing It Back From Jameson) and engages Doc Ock in two climactic battles. The first he loses, and he's delivered into the clutches of his former friend Harry Osborn. Osborn is stricken upon learning that Spiderman is in fact. Peter Parker. Parker convinces his friend to put aside the animosity and allow him to save the city from doom.The final climactic battle has Peter save Mary Jane, defeat Octavious and convince him to return to the man he once was. Octavious sacrifices himself in order to save New York City. Mary Jane discovers that peter is Spiderman and changes her opinions about him. In the end of the movie she leaves her husband at the altar, running to join with Peter Parker, knowing she will never have him all to herself. Despite this, she knows it's her decision to make, not his.Harry has his epiphany and there is a foreshadowing as to what he will do and become in the next movie. Spiderman 2 was good. I liked the supervillain they had. Molina's portrayal of Doc Ock was right on the money. I enjoyed him in the role and part of me wishes he had lived in the end, but that was not to be.Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I plan to buy the 2.1 version at a later date. In the meantime I shall continue to await for Andrew Garfield's Spidermen movies in the theatres. This movie earned its Four-Starer Rating. A major quibble of mine is the damsel in distress routine that Kirsten Dunst is always being forced to portray in the series.

Compared to the first movie, which was at least very well done and interesting, this one is a trashy sequel that takes an extra half an hour for awkward romance scenes which would make the romance scenes in ""Attack of the Clones"" look like Romeo and Juliet.The movie seems to take a 2 hour idea and stretch it 30 minutes longer, with the fight between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus never really reaching a head until the third or fourth fight, with the previous two just being excuses to show them crawling around buildings hurling stuff at each other.Perhaps the absolute worst part of the movie is the romantic scenes between Peter Parker and Mary-Jane.  The scenes are so horribly awkward as to make the romantic scenes in Star Wars Attack of the Clones look like true Shakespearean love.  Peter just says the most terribly awkward things to Mary-Jane, even so far as trying to get her to be his girlfriend when she's engaged, and pissed off at him for not coming to her play even once.  There is such little chemistry between them, they could literally be digitally replaced with each other or with apes and there'd be little change.While some actors like Alfred Molina and the guy who plays the Osborne kid actually put effort into their roles, the main guy, Tobey Maguire, has the same stupid, ditsy, awkward state to his entire character unmasked.  Bumbling about from getting fired to avoiding his landlord in stale and uncomical moments, to trying to get Mary-Jane to fall for him (in very lame and unbelievably awkward exchanges and dialogue) and trying to be Spiderman and a student all at once (despite the fact that all the crime he appears to be fighting is a purse snatcher in one scene, some robbers or so in another, and Otto Octavian towards the latter parts, after he's become Spiderman again), rather than make you wonder why Spiderman puts up with all this crap, it makes you wonder why there aren't any cops in this city.All in all, it was a very lackluster sequel, and Maguire, suitable for the simpler plot of the first movie, looks terribly one-dimensional and ditsy for a movie with a decidedly darker tone.One more thing, unrelated to the plot or anything, is one highly disturbing scene that must have been heavily edited in order to keep the movie from becoming an R or an NC-17: The scene where Octavian bludgeons several surgeons to death with his metal tentacles.This scene was the most disturbing and violent scene I've ever seen in any movie, and had it been given the suitable amount of blood necessary, would have made Caligula seem tame.  In the scene where the surgeons are trying to cut the tentacles off Otto Octavian's back, they come alive, and start hunting and beating the doctors to death, hurling them around the room, smashing into them, crushing them.There's one particular part which is beyond gruesome, showing a female doctor being dragged across the metal floor, while she digs her nails somehow into the metal, and shears ribbons of it off with her fingernails.  Considering that this is thick metal, her fingernails should have snapped clean off, and had her fingernails stayed pressed into the metal, they should have been shredded down to the bone, in a disgusting mess of blood gushing rapidly from her fingers.  Of course, to keep this PG-13, they didn't do such a thing, although the sound and sight of this heavily implied such.That snuff-like scene, coupled with godawful acting on Tobey Maguire's part, horribly stilted and awkward dialogue, and a movie that drags on and on listlessly, with little chemistry between the main characters, makes this sequel a truly terrible one.",1,"Really too complex to describe in the title, but basically, long, boring, and awkward.",1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,3756,"[""'m"", 'not', 'spiderman', 'fan', 'thus', 'am', 'not', 'blinded', 'fanboy/girl', 'love', 'comic', 'books', 'recognize', 'movie', 'bad', 'Compared', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'least', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'interesting', 'one', 'trashy', 'sequel', 'extra', 'half', 'hour', 'awkward', 'romance', 'scenes', 'would', 'make', 'romance', 'scenes', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'look', 'Romeo', 'Juliet.The', 'movie', 'take', '2', 'hour', 'idea', 'stretch', '30', 'minutes', 'longer', 'fight', 'Spiderman', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'never', 'really', 'reaching', 'head', 'third', 'fourth', 'fight', 'previous', 'two', 'just', 'being', 'excuses', 'show', 'crawling', 'buildings', 'hurling', 'stuff', 'other.Perhaps', 'absolute', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary-Jane', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'horribly', 'awkward', 'make', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'look', 'true', 'Shakespearean', 'love', 'Peter', 'just', 'most', 'terribly', 'awkward', 'things', 'Mary-Jane', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'trying', 'get', 'be', 'girlfriend', 'when', 'engaged', 'pissed', 'off', 'not', 'coming', 'play', 'even', 'once', 'such', 'little', 'chemistry', 'could', 'literally', 'be', 'digitally', 'replaced', 'other', 'apes', ""'d"", 'be', 'little', 'change.While', 'actors', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'guy', 'who', 'Osborne', 'kid', 'actually', 'put', 'effort', 'roles', 'main', 'guy', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'same', 'stupid', 'ditsy', 'awkward', 'state', 'entire', 'character', 'unmasked', 'Bumbling', 'getting', 'fired', 'avoiding', 'landlord', 'stale', 'uncomical', 'moments', 'trying', 'get', 'Mary-Jane', 'fall', 'very', 'lame', 'unbelievably', 'awkward', 'exchanges', 'dialogue', 'trying', 'be', 'Spiderman', 'student', 'once', 'fact', 'crime', 'be', 'fighting', 'purse', 'snatcher', 'one', 'scene', 'robbers', 'so', 'Otto', 'Octavian', 'latter', 'parts', 'become', 'Spiderman', 'again', 'rather', 'make', 'wonder', 'why', 'Spiderman', 'up', 'crap', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'cops', 'city.All', 'was', 'very', 'lackluster', 'sequel', 'Maguire', 'suitable', 'simpler', 'plot', 'first', 'movie', 'terribly', 'one-dimensional', 'ditsy', 'movie', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'more', 'thing', 'unrelated', 'plot', 'anything', 'one', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'heavily', 'edited', 'order', 'keep', 'movie', 'becoming', 'R', 'NC-17', 'scene', 'where', 'Octavian', 'bludgeons', 'several', 'surgeons', 'death', 'metal', 'tentacles.This', 'scene', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'violent', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'suitable', 'amount', 'blood', 'necessary', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Caligula', 'seem', 'tame', 'scene', 'where', 'surgeons', 'are', 'trying', 'cut', 'tentacles', 'off', 'Otto', 'Octavian', 'back', 'come', 'alive', 'start', 'hunting', 'beating', 'doctors', 'death', 'hurling', 'room', 'smashing', 'crushing', 'one', 'particular', 'part', 'gruesome', 'showing', 'female', 'doctor', 'being', 'dragged', 'metal', 'floor', 'nails', 'somehow', 'metal', 'shears', 'ribbons', 'off', 'fingernails', 'Considering', 'thick', 'metal', 'fingernails', 'should', 'have', 'snapped', 'clean', 'off', 'had', 'fingernails', 'stayed', 'pressed', 'metal', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shredded', 'down', 'bone', 'disgusting', 'mess', 'blood', 'gushing', 'rapidly', 'fingers', 'course', 'keep', 'PG-13', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'thing', 'sound', 'sight', 'heavily', 'implied', 'snuff-like', 'scene', 'coupled', 'godawful', 'acting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'part', 'horribly', 'stilted', 'awkward', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'listlessly', 'little', 'chemistry', 'main', 'characters', 'sequel', 'truly', 'terrible', 'one']",Spider-Man 2
621016,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JMQW,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It's no surprise to many people here that I consider `Spider-Man 3' to be a travesty.  I was looking forward to that movie so much and I was let down SOOOO much by the sloppy construction, poor visuals, ridiculous scripting and overall messy structure.  The reason I was looking forward to it was because, as many have already stated (critics alike), `Spider-Man 2' is probably the best superhero movie EVER!Plot holes or not, I still slightly prefer `The Dark Knight' (I love my superheroes to have a little grit on them).Where `Spider-Man' was a nicely constructed origin story, `Spider-Man 2' becomes a brilliantly orchestrated expansion on that origin, complete with a profound moral structure that elevates the film from a mere `comic book movie'.  With a solid script that really gets to the heart of the characters and makes them real and relatable, `Spider-Man 2' is an outstanding film, no matter what genre you place it in.  It has layer upon layer of interesting and memorable development.The film is, in a word, very complex (but that is a good thing).Picking up where the first film left off, Peter Parker is struggling to accept who he has become.  He still suffers from guilt, but he has masked that guilt with a newfound responsibility.  That responsibility is making it very difficult for Peter to strike a needed balance between his personal life and that of being Spider-Man.  This is making his budding romance with Mary Jane Watson more aggravating than it should be.  His past actions (involving a certain flying villain) have posed a threat to Peter's relationship with his best friend Harry, who has vowed to avenge his father's death.  When you add to that a brilliant man controlled by his own genius (a marvelous Alfred Molina), you have a recipe for some exciting and provoking entertainment.And that is JUST what `Spider-Man 2' proves to be.Sam Raimi is at his very best here.  What I admire so much about this film is that, while Raimi definitely `goes there' in the visual department, he never goes so far that the film appears fake.  That was one of my biggest issues with that Spider-Mess of a third film.  Everything was SOOOO computer animated that it came off like a really bad video game.  Not so here.  Sure, there is a lot going on, but everything maintains a crisp, slickness to it that establishes a sense of realism.  Yes, I know that it is improbable that a tentacle clad man is ever going to scale buildings and wreck havoc in the streets, but Raimi made me wholly believe that it is not impossible.  His attention to detail here is impeccable.  I love the way that Raimi captured what it felt like to read a Spider-Man comic book as a boy.  The film has this light and airy (colorful) feel to it, yet it is laced with that suspense that only comes from truly engrossing yourself in this character and his purpose.Bravo.And yet still, the most impressive facet of `Spider-Man 2' is the fact that it has a real heart.  It is less the story of a superhero and more the story of a complex and conflicted young man, trying desperately to juggle his life in a way that makes the most sense; paying his dues where they belong while still developing a life that will satisfy and complete him.We are all Peter Parker, minus the superpowers.I still firmly believe that Toby Maguire was BORN to play this part, and it is still the only role I've ever really believed him in.  He is not my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite characters, and my heart is welled up in this man because of what Maguire does here.So, best superhero movie of all time?",5,Glorious; simply glorious!,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,3591,"['surprise', 'many', 'people', 'here', 'consider', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'be', 'travesty', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'SOOOO', 'much', 'sloppy', 'construction', 'poor', 'visuals', 'ridiculous', 'scripting', 'overall', 'messy', 'structure', 'reason', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'was', 'because', 'many', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'critics', 'alike', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'probably', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'EVER', 'Plot', 'holes', 'not', 'still', 'slightly', 'prefer', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'love', 'superheroes', 'have', 'little', 'grit', '.Where', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'origin', 'story', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'brilliantly', 'orchestrated', 'expansion', 'origin', 'complete', 'profound', 'moral', 'structure', 'film', 'mere', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'solid', 'script', 'really', 'heart', 'characters', 'real', 'relatable', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'outstanding', 'film', 'matter', 'what', 'place', 'layer', 'layer', 'interesting', 'memorable', 'development.The', 'film', 'word', 'very', 'complex', 'good', 'thing', '.Picking', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'film', 'left', 'off', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'struggling', 'accept', 'who', 'become', 'still', 'guilt', 'masked', 'guilt', 'newfound', 'responsibility', 'responsibility', 'making', 'very', 'difficult', 'Peter', 'strike', 'needed', 'balance', 'personal', 'life', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'making', 'budding', 'romance', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'more', 'aggravating', 'should', 'be', 'past', 'actions', 'involving', 'certain', 'flying', 'villain', 'have', 'posed', 'threat', 'Peter', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'who', 'vowed', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'When', 'add', 'brilliant', 'man', 'controlled', 'own', 'genius', 'marvelous', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'have', 'recipe', 'exciting', 'provoking', 'entertainment.And', 'JUST', 'what', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'proves', 'be.Sam', 'Raimi', 'very', 'best', 'here', 'What', 'admire', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'Raimi', 'definitely', 'visual', 'department', 'never', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'fake', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'issues', 'Spider-Mess', 'third', 'film', 'Everything', 'was', 'SOOOO', 'computer', 'animated', 'came', 'off', 'really', 'bad', 'video', 'game', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'Sure', 'lot', 'going', 'everything', 'crisp', 'slickness', 'sense', 'realism', 'Yes', 'know', 'improbable', 'tentacle', 'clad', 'man', 'ever', 'going', 'scale', 'buildings', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'streets', 'Raimi', 'made', 'wholly', 'believe', 'not', 'impossible', 'attention', 'detail', 'here', 'impeccable', 'love', 'way', 'Raimi', 'captured', 'what', 'felt', 'read', 'Spider-Man', 'comic', 'book', 'boy', 'film', 'light', 'airy', 'colorful', 'feel', 'laced', 'suspense', 'only', 'truly', 'engrossing', 'character', 'purpose.Bravo.And', 'yet', 'still', 'most', 'impressive', 'facet', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'fact', 'real', 'heart', 'less', 'story', 'superhero', 'more', 'story', 'complex', 'conflicted', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'desperately', 'juggle', 'life', 'way', 'most', 'sense', 'paying', 'dues', 'where', 'belong', 'still', 'developing', 'life', 'will', 'satisfy', 'complete', 'him.We', 'are', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'minus', 'superpowers.I', 'still', 'firmly', 'believe', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'was', 'BORN', 'play', 'part', 'still', 'only', 'role', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'really', 'believed', 'not', 'favorite', 'actor', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'heart', 'welled', 'up', 'man', 'what', 'Maguire', 'here.So', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'time']",Spider-Man 2

621018,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00005JMQW,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[1, 2]","I must say that I was very excited about seeing this movie, so much that I was worried that I would be let down like with Star Wars I and The Matrix Reloaded.  Fortunately, Sam Raimi, Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco were able to not only spellbind us again, but this film far surpassed the orginal Spider-Man, which was no easy feat.Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker (McGuire) is down and out; he is losing his friends, his jobs, and and grades are quickly declining.  The cause for all this is because of his escapades as Spider-Man.  He can never keep an appointment with Mary-Jane Watson (Dunst), the woman he loves, and this drives her away.  His friend Harry Osborne (Franco) can't stand the fact that he has more loyalty to Spidey than to him.  Harry believes that Spidey killed his father, Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe), who, unbeknownst to Harry, was the Green Goblin.Meanwhile, Harry is funding a project being researched by an eminent scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), which will create a new, cheap, almost never-ending energy source.  Sadly, things go wrong (surprise surprise), and Otto gets four mechanical arms fused onto his back, and they have minds of their own.  They begin to ""suggest"" that he do things, like start the project again, rob banks, and kill people.Finally, after losing his friends and most of his jobs, Peter throws away his Spidey suit, vowing never to be Spider-Man again.  This of course opens up New York to a rapidly increasing crime rate.All of the actors did a superb job in this film.  Dunst, Franco, Rosemary Harris (playing Aunt May), and J.K. Simmons (playing the hilarious J. Jonah Jameson) all got bigger roles, and even Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) and Willem Dafoe got small cameo roles.  The story remained strong, especially for a comic book film, and the effects were amazing.

621021,A1FE06N5A77K8W,B00005JMQW,Annie Feng,"[4, 4]","I was hesitant to see Spider man 2 because the first one did not struck a cord with me. The first one is not bad, but it's like every other comic-book adaptation superhero movies out there: you know, cheesy villans, large reliance on 21 century CGI and actions. Basically makes you always come out of the theatre unsatisfied.But Man, this time for some reason the writers decided to give us a superhero action movie with a PLOT!!! Imagine that!!! Instead of the usual comical superhero movie we've seen many times, Spider Man 2 was written into a drama. instead of the movie spent half of it on the villain and his evil plans and half the hero has to stop the villain. We have a movie that solely focuses on the main character and his struggles. the villian was as simple as a villain could be- a mad scientist turned into a monster and ended up almost destroying the city. At first look at Dr. Octopus, I thought the character was going to be even more ridiculous than the last one- the Green Goblin (which was one of the main reasons of my hesitancy to see this movie). But hey, he works. He's formidable enough for Spider man, faithful to the comic books. And we didn't have too much of irratation in watching his evil plan formations and how he became what he is, it was smooth enough to make us understand, and quick enough to sit through. The rest with him in it would be the breath-taking action.Lots of times when the producers decided to make a sequal to a movie, they often made the movie more complicated than it has to be (X-men, pirates of the carribean anyone?). But Spider Man 2 was really a SEQUAL, it was a continuation of the first one, and more character-driven and in depth. It was brilliant in the way that it's understandable, it's simple, and it's something we could all connect.The ""twist"" in the movie-in which Spider man was ""turned"" into just Peter Parker again, wasn't a twist so much as part of the story. This I find exhilarating. This twist is something we have seen in lots of other superhero movies, like in Superman 2. The difference is that instead of showing us all the negatives in being a human as to being a superhero which made the hero change his mind, this film showed us all the positives of being a human, that it was something burden stripping and something to be cherished upon. Peter Parker started to enjoy school, do his homework, and actually for once made it to his heartthrop-M.J's show. And the writer triumphed again in showing us, in that powerful fire-rescue sequence, that a human being be hero too, that just because we don't have superpowers doesn't mean we can't do good like superheros. But in the end my favorite twist- in which Peter saved ONE person but could not save another, his conscience stirred up in the way that he COULD do more but he didn't, and this started to change his mind. So instead of the hero being humiliated (like in Superman 2 Superman was badly beaten by a goon after turned human) and therefore recognized his vulnerability in not pocessing superpowers, Parker's mind was changed in recognizing his conscience in his choice-making. This brilliant scene not only sticked to the whole theme about CHOICE, but that superpowers, like intelligence, is a gift to be used for the good of mankind.Spider man 2 was also a movie in which EVERYBODY can connect, simply because the main character was just so ordinary, in comparason to other superheros. He doesn't have financial back-up like batman, he isn't immensily tall or good-looking like Superman, he's not an undead or alien. In fact, he doesn't even have a stable job. Many times in other superhero action movies there are always things that make us scratch our heads like: oooookay, so where did you get the money to buy all that cool equipments?? Or, after all this time with the secret identity-the he's here, he's not thing wouldn't at least SOMEBODY start to suspect?? But in this film it was so realistic: how do you manage to be 24/7 superhero AND manage to keep your job going?- YOU DON'T. Parker was fired more than once in taking on this big responsibility. Even the Spider-man outfit was something ordinary- its colors dyed on other clothes in the washer, now that's REAL story-telling.Of course one of the major highlights of Spider man 2 would be its humor. And the irony in humor using was just great. The lines were funny, Peter Parker was just pathetic in the you-want-to-give-him-a-big-hug kind of way. It was both funny and heart-brakingThe cliffhanger in the end set up the third movie very well. Not only was it a happy-ending cliffhanger, but makes us anticipate lots of questions to be answered in terms of characters and character transformation: so now that Harry Osborn know the truth about his father, would he follow his father's footstep and become the next Green Goblin (God I hope not), or forgives Spider man in understanding? The last scene in which M.J watches Spider man going off with a look of concern on her face- what was she thinking? did she see something in Spider man that we did not? Why wasn't she happy in seeing Spiderman go off, especially since they just made up??? I can't wait for these questions to be answered in the third filmFinally I just want a big shout out to TOBY MAGUIRE!!!!! He was simply BRILLIANT throughout the whole film, KEEP IT UP TOBY!!!!This film was 2 hours long and not a single second was wasted. This got to be the first sequal of a superhero film in which I was not the least unsatified, not only that, but made me want more. Please keep it on the same track for the third movie writers!!!!",5,"wow, never thought it would be THIS good",1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,5600,"['was', 'hesitant', 'see', 'Spider', 'man', '2',

So, I had high hopes going into this movie knowing I thoroughly enjoyed the first.The strength of the series lies in the relationships between Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborne (Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco).  These three people are ordinary people with ordinary problems like everyone else.  I enjoyed both movies because of the interaction and conflict between these characters.The primary plot of the story, aside from Doc Ock, is Peter's love for Mary Jane.  Peter doesn't want to get close to her in fear of him being Spiderman coming back to hurt her.  This is the big problem I have with the movie.  The movie does such a great job of centering the entire conflict in the movie around Peter loving Mary Jane but constantly disappointing her.  A great way to resolve this would be for Peter to win Mary Jane's heart without Spiderman having anything to do with it.  Unfortunately, director Sam Raimi takes the easy way out and throws away the conflict between Peter and Mary Jane at the end.This obviously isn't a story you can carry on forever.  Mary and Peter had to get together sooner or later.  I just wish that it hadn't happened so easily.Overall, this is a good, solid movie, and the ending sets it up for a great Spiderman 3.",4,Spiderman 2 takes the easy way out,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,1412,"['Spiderman', '2', 'been', 'labeled', 'many', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'best', 'least', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'probably', 'better', 'first', 'So', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'going', 'movie', 'knowing', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'first.The', 'strength', 'series', 'relationships', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'James', 'Franco', 'three', 'people', 'are', 'ordinary', 'people', 'ordinary', 'problems', 'everyone', 'else', 'enjoyed', 'movies', 'interaction', 'conflict', 'characters.The', 'primary', 'plot', 'story', 'aside', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Peter', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'close', 'fear', 'being', 'Spiderman', 'coming', 'back', 'hurt', 'big', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'centering', 'entire', 'conflict', 'movie', 'Peter', 'loving', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'constantly', 'disappointing', 'great', 'way', 'resolve', 'would', 'be', 'Peter', 'win', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'heart', 'Spiderman', 'having', 'anything', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'easy', 'way', 'away', 'conflict', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'end.This', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'story', 'can', 'carry', 'forever', 'Mary', 'Peter', 'had', 'get', 'together', 'sooner', 'later', 'just', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'happened', 'so', 'easily.Overall', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'ending', 'sets', 'up', 'great', 'Spiderman', '3']",Spider-Man 2
621024,A1YZMGEC9ELI4L,B00005JMQW,"A.P. Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[1, 1]","In this second installment in the Spider-Man franchise, Peter Parker has his back against the wall as he tries to juggle life as a student, being best friends with Mary Jane Watson, carrying the guilt of his uncle's death, freelancing for the Daily Bugle, delivering pizza, and, of course, being ever on-call as your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man.No matter how hard he tries, Peter just can't seem to balance everything at once and the constant sacrifices he makes in his personal life so he can help others wears him down . . . down . . . down . . . until he can't take it anymore and his spider-powers begin to change.Then vanish.The timing couldn't have been worse, either, because Dr. Otto Octavius's energy device backfired and has fused four robotic arms to his body, their AI worming its way into his brain, controlling him. All they care about is fulfilling their purpose and they don't care who they have to hurt to recreate the device they were made for.Dr. Octopus's (Doc Ock) rampage through New York is met with little resistance until our favorite web-slinger attempts to take him on.This movie thrills the inner fanboy much more than its predecessor and officially is my favorite so far in the Spider-Man series. This flick carries near start-to-finish classic superhero goodness: stellar aerial battles, eye-popping web-slinging, dual identity troubles, nerd-can't/won't-get-the-girl issues, a hardcore villain bent on his mark, trials, sacrifice--all crammed into a little over two-hour movie. But the pacing works and doesn't feel over cluttered at all.You feel for Peter Parker every minute of this film, both when he's at the top of his game and when he's at the bottom, and when he loses his spider-powers, your heart sinks and you cry out, ""No! Not Peter! His powers are part of who he is. How can you take them away?""Tobey Maguire was extremely believable in this film and brought a real depth to Parker that--though was present in the first one--really shone through in this one. And Alfred Molina as Doc Ock? Such duality. When you first meet Otto Octavius, he genuinely seems like a nice guy, an almost fatherly figure in a way, but when he loses his project and those he cares about, things switch and he barely resembles the man he once was. Yet deep within, you see him struggling against the mechanical arms that have taken over his body and mind.J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious as always, and Kirsten Dunst as MJ--there was more maturity in the character this time around and though she still acted kind of ""high school-ish,"" you also saw someone struggling with who they were--more specifically, trying desperately to reach out to the man she's fallen for but who is pushing her away.Spider-Man 2 thrilled me to pieces. I was there on opening night and I left the theatre all smiles and in a state of disbelief at how downright cool it was. I wasn't sure if it would top the first one because most sequels--till that point because the Superman movies and the previous set of Batman films were pretty much what we had to go on except for X2--usually don't nail it like the first one.I was proven wrong.This movie rocked so hard I went back a couple more times and bought it on DVD as soon as I could.Check this flick out. You're in for an amazingly cool, web-slinging good time.Recommended.A.P.

621025,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B00005JMQW,A Reviewer,"[5, 9]","They say never to mess with a winning formula. Spider-Man made a HUGE ammount of money in theaters, and set quite a few records. People really loved this movie, (myself included.) It had all the action it needed, characters were well-developed, and it was just like a comic book. It was even very funny and enjoyable.Why, then, did they mess this up with Spider-Man 2? All the fun of the first movie is gone, instead replaced by endless sappy conversations. Other reviewers have mentioned all the crying that goes on in this movie. I agree, there was way too much of it. In almost every scene, characters are always in tears. This was not what I expected from a sequel to one of the best ACTION movies of 2002! This one tries way too hard to be dramatic, and it was simply boring.The plot was not fun, either. Essentially, Spider-Man distances himself from all his friends, and they're all upset about that. There you go. Oh yeah, and there's a scientist who installed tentacles onto himself and is now on a violent rampage.Compared to the plot of the first movie, this one is simply laughable. There is also almost no action scenes in this movie. Maybe 2 or 3 big action sequences, but the rest of the movie is simply one ""crying scene"" after another.The action scenes, by the way, aren't really as much fun as in the first movie. Sure, they are bigger and more explosive, but they are too violent to be fun. Now, violence is not a problem for me in most cases. I really like many movies and video games that people considder violent. But it seemed so pointless and out of place in Spider-Man 2 that it drained all the fun out of the action scenes. Endless close-ups of people SCREAMING at the camera before being killed is not only very violent, but it's also cheesy. (What is this, a B-movie?)A big scene showcased on the trailers and commercials ""Let's see who is behind the mask!"" Is not nearly as cool as it seems. They wanted you to expect this to be a huge deal, and this whole scene ended up falling flat.Overall, Spider-Man 2 was simply a dull, tear-filled sequel to one of the coolest movies of 2002. Obviously, you should see this if you were a fan of the original simply to see where they're going with the story, but overall....this movie just doesn't even come close to what the first movie offered.",2,What is this?,1114128000,"04 22, 2005",2005,2314,"['say', 'never', 'mess', 'winning', 'formula', 'Spider-Man', 'made', 'HUGE', 'ammount', 'money', 'theaters', 'set', 'quite', 'few', 'records', 'People', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'included', 'had', 'action', 'needed', 'characters', 'were', 'well-developed', 'was', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'even', 'very', 'funny', 'enjoyable.Why', 'then', 'did', 'mess', 'up', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'fun', 'first', 'movie', 'gone', 'instead', 'replaced', 'endless', 'sappy', 'conversations', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'crying', 'movie', 'agree', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'scene', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'tears', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'sequel', 'one', 'best', 'ACTION', 'movies', '2002', 'one', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'dramatic', 'was', 'simply', 'boring.The', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'fun', 'either', 'Essentially', 'Spider-Man', 'distances', 'friends', ""'re"", 'upset', 'go', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'scientist', 'who', 'installed', 'tentacles', 'now', 'violent', 'rampage.Compared', 'plot', 'first', 'movie', 'one', 'simply', 'laughable', 'also', 'almost', 'action', 'movie', 'Maybe', '2', '3', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'rest', 'movie', 'simply', 'one', 'crying', 'scene', 'another.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'way', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'first', 'movie', 'Sure', 'are', 'bigger', 'more', 'explosive', 'are', 'too', 'violent', 'be', 'fun', 'Now', 'violence', 'not', 'problem', 'most', 'cases', 'really', 'many', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'people', 'considder', 'violent', 'seemed', 'so', 'pointless', 'place', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'drained', 'fun', 'action', 'scenes', 'Endless', 'close-ups', 'people', 'SCREAMING', 'camera', 'being', 'killed', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'violent', 'also', 'cheesy', 'What', 'B-movie', 'big', 'scene', 'showcased', 'trailers', 'commercials', 'Let', 'see', 'who', 'mask', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'cool', 'wanted', 'expect', 'be', 'huge', 'deal', 'whole', 'scene', 'ended', 'up', 'falling', 'flat.Overall', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'simply', 'dull', 'tear-filled', 'sequel', 'one', 'coolest', 'movies', '2002', 'Obviously', 'should', 'see', 'were', 'fan', 'original', 'simply', 'see', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'story', 'overall', '.this', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'what', 'first', 'movie', 'offered']",Spider-Man 2
621026,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JMQW,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[4, 5]","Dang I'm impressed.  I realize that some people would read that as sarcasm but truthfully, I'm being sincere.  This one is without a doubt the best movie of 2004.On the heels of the first Spiderman movie (a mere two years ago) we find Peter Parker graduated from High School and being put upon by life in general.  Fired from his carpy day job, beset by a grating landlord for the overdue rent on his rinky-dink apartment, missing and failing college classes, lack of love life staring him in the face every time he sees the billboard plastered with his ex-girlfriend's face...we all know guys like this.  Heck, we could all be this guy from time to time.  Even worse, his alter ego as Spiderman is being publicly slandered in the newspaper by his own boss.  Here is one average joe superhero who is taking a massive ego beating.  You're not alone, Charlie Brown.Hold on action fans, Spiderman 2 is no downer!  There's a good balance between the sympathetic backstory and the energy that lured us into the theaters.  Spidey gets plenty of fight play from Doc Octopus, the new supervillain on the block.  There is a great deal of incredible web-swinging as well, better than in the first film; you really get the sense of fun from the spider's-eye view.  I dare say the animators have finally perfected their art here.Now a word of caution to parents.  Like me, you may have assumed that since S1 was fairly low on the violence meter that S2 would be similar.  Regrettably, I think the violence level of S2 was jacked up a bit too high for a movie that appeals so widely to children.  There are just a few too many scenes of actual humans being graphically savaged by Doc Oc for my comfort as the parent of a 6-year-old Spidey fan.  If I had realized that I wouldn't have let him see it until we could buy it on dvd and selectively fast forward through the intense parts.On the whole though, I loved this movie.  I saw a hero that was made more heroic for the fact that he was a very real person with problems who chose to sacrifice his own interests and go fight the good fight anyway.  That's what made this a standout in the genre of comic superhero flicks, the real heroism of the human spirit embodied by Peter Parker.  The cool costume is just a nice bonus (by the way, my eternal thanks to Stan Lee for giving us a superhero without that annoying cape).Go see this on the big screen while you have a chance to enjoy the maximum effect, then buy this for your kids on dvd later.

621027,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B00005JMQW,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[4, 5]","I enjoyed the first film and just like X2 I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel even more. The effects were much improved from the first film. It seems that John Dykstra and crew have fine-tuned the CGI Spider-Man not to look too cartoony.Maguire's seem to have grown into the role of Peter Parker and looks more comfortable in all his scenes. The rest of the cast were more than adequate enough in the roles they had to play. The stand-outs other than Maguire have to be Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius. Molina's humanizing take on Doc Ock raises the character from just your ordinary power-mad supervillain into a tragic figure driven mad by circumstances beyond his control. Unlike Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Molina doesn't chew up the scenery but instead takes a more understated approach in portraying Spidey's nemesis. Kudos must also go to J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson. His scenes were some of the funniest in the film and accurately brings to life the character from the comics. Some of his lines are straight from the comics themselves.As some may have mentioned the script and some of the dialogue can be weak and corny. I have to admit that they are at that, but the script overall wasn't as bad as some may have pointed out. The overall tone of the film and its script has the feel of a comic book. This is a comic book film and as such I went into it thinking of it as one. Some of the dialogue are bad and to be honest the dialogue in the comic itself can be bad. But the effect some of the corny dialogue had on me wasn't enough for me to thoroughly enjoy the whole film. Alvin Sargent's (two-time Oscar winning screenwriter) may have had his hands full trying to convey the feel of the Spider-Man comics in 2 hours. I think Michael Chabon's (Pulitzer-prize winning author of The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay: a novel about comic books)help in doctoring the script may have helped save the enitre tone of the film from becoming too corny. I hope they hire him to write the third film instead of just helping on it.One thing, I like to point out is the effects used for Dock Ock's mechanical tentacles. As I watched the film the first time then a second time a few days later, I still couldn't tell when the CGI tentacles and the animatronic tentacles were on-screen. The effects work on Ock's helpers has to be some of the best FX work I have seen. The tentacles themselves seem to have individual personalities as they came to life.And for all Evil Dead fans, Raimi was generous enough to bring in Bruce &quot;He is God&quot; Campbell to make a cameo in one of the funnier scenes in the film. Raimi also brings abit of a Evil Dead vibe to the hospital scene w/ Octavius pre-Dock Ock.For a summer blockbuster and comic book superhero film, I recommend this film. It's not Citizen Kane and when taken for the whole of its parts Spider-Man 2 succeeds and entertains.",5,One of the best comic-book films...,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,2882,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'film', 'just', 'X2', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'sequel', 'even', 'more', 'effects', 'were', 'much', 'improved', 'first', 'film', 'John', 'Dykstra', 'crew', 'have', 'fine-tuned', 'CGI', 'Spider-Man', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'cartoony.Maguire', 'seem', 'have', 'grown', 'role', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'more', 'comfortable', 'scenes', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'more', 'adequate', 'enough', 'roles', 'had', 'play', 'stand-outs', 'other', 'Maguire', 'have', 'be', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'Molina', 'humanizing', 'take', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'character', 'just', 'ordinary', 'power-mad', 'supervillain', 'tragic', 'figure', 'driven', 'mad', 'circumstances', 'control', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Molina', ""n't"", 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'instead', 'more', 'understated', 'approach', 'portraying', 'Spidey', 'nemesis', 'Kudos', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'scenes', 'were', 'funniest', 'film', 'accurately', 'brings', 'life', 'character', 'comics', 'lines', 'are', 'straight', 'comics', 'themselves.As', 'may', 'have', 'mentioned', 'script', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'weak', 'corny', 'have', 'admit', 'are', 'script', 'overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'may', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'script', 'feel', 'comic', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'such', 'went', 'thinking', 'one', 'dialogue', 'are', 'bad', 'be', 'dialogue', 'comic', 'can', 'be', 'bad', 'effect', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'film', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'two-time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'screenwriter', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'hands', 'full', 'trying', 'convey', 'feel', 'Spider-Man', 'comics', '2', 'hours', 'think', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'Pulitzer-prize', 'winning', 'author', 'Adventures', 'Kavalier', 'Clay', 'novel', 'comic', 'books', 'help', 'doctoring', 'script', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'save', 'enitre', 'tone', 'film', 'becoming', 'too', 'corny', 'hope', 'hire', 'write', 'third', 'film', 'instead', 'just', 'helping', 'it.One', 'thing', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'effects', 'used', 'Dock', 'Ock', 'mechanical', 'tentacles', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'second', 'time', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'when', 'CGI', 'tentacles', 'animatronic', 'tentacles', 'were', 'on-screen', 'effects', 'work', 'Ock', 'helpers', 'be', 'best', 'FX', 'work', 'have', 'seen', 'tentacles', 'seem', 'have', 'individual', 'personalities', 'came', 'life.And', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'fans', 'Raimi', 'was', 'generous', 'enough', 'bring', 'Bruce', 'quot', 'God', 'quot', 'Campbell', 'make', 'cameo', 'one', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'film', 'Raimi', 'also', 'abit', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'vibe', 'hospital', 'scene', 'w/', 'Octavius', 'pre-Dock', 'Ock.For', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'film', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'when', 'taken', 'whole', 'parts', 'Spider-Man', '2']",Spider-Man 2
621028,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B00005JMQW,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[0, 0]","No, Harry Oswald doesn't go around quoting ""The Princess Bride,"" or referring to Inigo Montoya's famous quest to revenge his father's death by a six-fingered man. However, he blames Spiderman for the death of his father (AKA the Green Goblin). He'll do anything to avenge his father, and that includes making a deal with Dr. Octopus.That, and several other excellent subplots help make Spiderman 2 the best screen adaptation of a comic book series. I argue that it is better than best-of-show in a genre, and can be placed in the echelons of great movies overall.Although incredible effects help create a real Spiderman, the movie excels because of the humanity of Peter Parker.Peter is in love, but isn't willing to tell Mary Jane. He uses Spiderman as his excuse even though it is old fashioned fear of commitment and rejection that are at play. Any teenager or young 20s man has felt that angst, and so we relate to Peter.Peter loves his Aunt May and the late Uncle Ben, and feels heavy guilt for Uncle Ben's death. It was Peter, after all, who let the thief who later killed Ben escape. The relationship between Aunt May and Peter is like a grandmother and grandchild, and is believable.Mr. Jameson is the least believable character, and the most caricatured. Snapping quickly at any opportunity to malign Spiderman's reputation, he acknowledges that Spidey's apparent retirement causes an increase in the crime rate.The Plot:Peter tries to set aside his Spiderman persona to forge a real life. Too often, he found Spidey interfering with his ability to keep his word, to be on time, keep his grades up, to earn money and to keep and grow relationships.After soul-searching, he quits, and tries a post-Spidey lifestyle. He watches as police rush by a few times. When Peter saves a baby in a burning building without the assistance of super powers, only to learn someone remained in the building and died, he knows he could've done something.Meanwhile, Harry Oswald introduces Peter to his hero, physicist Dr. Octavius. Dr. Octavius is working on a project that can revolutionize and resolve the world's energy problem. During a demonstration, the experiment goes awry. Spiderman launches into action, and saves the day. Unfortunately, Dr. Octavius's beloved wife dies in an explosion, and the Dr. himself finds that the robotic arms he used to help with the experiment have fused to his nervous system.Raging against Spiderman for, as he believes, killing his wife, Dr. Octavius seeks revenge. Concurrently, he tries to rebuild the dangerous experiment. He needs rare materials, and deals with Harry, who also wants revenge. If Dr. Octavius captures Spiderman, Harry will give him the material.When Harry pulls out a dagger, ready to kill the bound up Spiderman, he pulls off the mask, and everything changes. How can his best friend be Spiderman?All of the while, Peter is trying to make ends meet. The cantankerous Mr. Jameson hires Peter to photograph a social event involving John, his son, a famous astronaut.It turns out that John is seeing Mary Jane, and becomes engaged to her. Peter's heart sinks, and he tries to talk her out of it and back into a relationship with him. MJ counters that she and Peter have no relationship to return to. It is over, and Peter knows it.When Dr. Octavius kidnaps MJ, and tells Peter to tell Spidey to meet him, Peter must decide if Spiderman must exist to save MJ, the world, but in doing so, lose MJ's heart.What will Peter choose? The love of a woman, or her life? It is an impossible choice, and replete with danger either way.The transition between comic book and movie screen has never been as smooth. Ang Lee's ""Hulk,"" had no depth, just as Christopher Reeve's ""Superman."" Fun? Yes, but neither were great movies. ""Spiderman 2"" is a great movie.We forget who are the actors. Kirsten Dunst as girl-next-door Mary Jane Watson is fantastic, being beautiful and ordinary simultaneously. Rosemary Harris looks as much as like Aunt May as anyone could. Finally, Tobey Maguire is so perfectly cast as Peter Parker, that all is seamless.I fully recommend Spiderman 2.

The low-key opening third of the film in which Parker's character and situation is explored and revealed is quite engaging. Maguire has a soft, laid back approach that is quite appealing. This feels like a real film with real characters. The surrounding characters are a little over-blown, but seen as a film about a real person living in a comic-book fantasy, they work well, and there is a healthy, knowing tongue-in-cheek intelligence about the film that pulls me in. But at some point in the middle when the action film section really gets going I realized that I had become bored. The film had lost the art-house feel of the opening, had become yet another Hollywood No Brainer with big action sequences, no character development, no surprises, just the usual crash scenes. It was hard to stay focused, and I wondered why and where exactly the awareness of the intelligent viewer had been dropped.

Instead I rented it, and I was expecting something amazing. What did I get instead of that? A corny, bubble gum piece of fluff. Spider-Man 2 was just a very predictable movie without much of a well played out story, unlike the first one which unfolded really well.

One is THE DARK KNIGHT, which if you read my review of that, you'll know of the disdain I have for that movie, and the other is this film SPIDERMAN 2 (2004). I just plain do not get it! Yes, of course SPIDERMAN 2 has a lot of CGI-style effects, but I'm not going to harp on that too much as it this is the new direction of films (but very few filmmakers have figured out how to make it work), and also, if everything else is done well, I can forgive overdone effects (which this movie has!), but that's the point...EVERYTHING ELSE IS NOT DONE WELL!There is not one single likable character in SPIDERMAN 2 and the most annoying is (of course!) the main one Peter Parker/Spiderman (played by Tobey Maguire). I saw Sam Raimi's first SPIDERMAN in 2002 and thought it was actually a good movie. It had been years since I had seen a new superhero film (last one was BATMAN AND ROBIN in 1997...Yikes!) and the failure of that one and ones after made me think the genre was dead. But I was really drawn into the story of SPIDERMAN...The first SPIDERMAN was formulaic, but, at the end of the day, it was GOOD. This is one reason why I can't believe how many people actually think that SPIDERMAN 2 exceeds SPIDERMAN, when SPIDERMAN is at the very least a GOOD movie, while SPIDERMAN 2 is such a POOR one...poorly acted, poorly written, poorly paced, just plain POOR!I wouldn't even call SPIDERMAN 2 formulaic because it has stuff in it that doesn't remind one of a superhero film at all, mostly Parker pining for his fatal attraction high-school wannabe sweetheart Mary Jane (M.J. if your nasty!) played by Kirsten Dunst. Yes, typically in superhero films, there is a love interest, but the hero isn't acting like a sap for the entirety of the film! I've got to say that while Dunst was immensely appealing in the first SPIDERMAN, Raimi doesn't do a good job of making her look appealing at all in this sequel. Like Maggie Gylenhaal (check spelling) from THE DARK KNIGHT, I just don't see why so many guys are into this girl...the THREE guys being Parker, his ""best friend"" Harry (reprised by James Franco, who is barely used in this film), and J. Jonah Jameson's (reprised by J.K. Simmons) astronaut son, who M.J. is engaged to in this (no explanation given as to why!). In addition to the utterly sappy romantic aspects of this film, there is sappy dialogue all around, with a terrible (and unnecessary) scene of Peter revealing to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that he was indirectly responsible for his uncle's death in SPIDERMAN, as well as an absurd (and again, unnecessary!) moment where a major reveal happens on a subway train. SPIDERMAN hinted that Peter was going to develop into a hero to be reckoned with, but in 2, he regressed to being more juvenile than he was at the start of 1!One of the biggest fails of SPIDERMAN 2 is the main villain Doc Ock (played decently by Alfred Molina, but he's not given much to work with or do), too.  His tragedy is interesting that turns him into a villain, but it is all done in an all too melodramatic manner and he gets the sappiest moment during the climax in an extremely cheesy scene of him, errr, ""communicating"" with his octopus arms after Parker (I mean, Spiderman, but he doesn't have his darn mask on, just like in most of the movie!) convinces him to turn away from evil...So that's it? The villain gives up...THE GREATEST COMIC-BOOK SUPERHERO MOVIE OF ALL TIME...Yeah, right!",1,Really surprised by the love for this movie,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,3684,"['have', 'been', '2', 'major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'made', '00s', 'have', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'baffled', 'how', 'have', 'received', 'such', 'praise', 'recognition', 'BOTH', 'critics', 'moviegoers', 'ironically', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'One', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'read', 'review', ""'ll"", 'know', 'disdain', 'have', 'movie', 'other', 'film', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', '2004', 'just', 'plain', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Yes', 'course', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'lot', 'CGI-style', 'effects', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'harp', 'too', 'much', 'new', 'direction', 'films', 'very', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'how', 'make', 'work', 'also', 'everything', 'else', 'done', 'well', 'can', 'forgive', 'overdone', 'effects', 'movie', 'point', 'EVERYTHING', 'ELSE', 'IS', 'NOT', 'DONE', 'WELL', 'not', 'one', 'single', 'likable', 'character', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'most', 'annoying', 'course', 'main', 'one', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'played', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'saw', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'first', 'SPIDERMAN', '2002', 'thought', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'years', 'had', 'seen', 'new', 'superhero', 'film', 'last', 'one', 'was', 'BATMAN', 'AND', 'ROBIN', '1997', 'failure', 'one', 'ones', 'made', 'think', 'genre', 'was', 'dead', 'was', 'really', 'drawn', 'story', 'SPIDERMAN', 'first', 'SPIDERMAN', 'was', 'formulaic', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'GOOD', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'think', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'exceeds', 'SPIDERMAN', 'when', 'SPIDERMAN', 'very', 'least', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'such', 'POOR', 'one', 'poorly', 'acted', 'poorly', 'written', 'poorly', 'paced', 'just', 'plain', 'POOR', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'formulaic', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'remind', 'one', 'superhero', 'film', 'mostly', 'Parker', 'pining', 'fatal', 'attraction', 'high-school', 'wannabe', 'sweetheart', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'M.J.', 'nasty', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Yes', 'typically', 'superhero', 'films', 'love', 'interest', 'hero', ""n't"", 'acting', 'sap', 'entirety', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'Dunst', 'was', 'immensely', 'appealing', 'first', 'SPIDERMAN', 'Raimi', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'look', 'appealing', 'sequel', 'Maggie', 'Gylenhaal', 'check', 'spelling', 'THE', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'guys', 'are', 'girl', 'THREE', 'guys', 'being', 'Parker', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'reprised', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'barely', 'used', 'film', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'reprised', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'son', 'who', 'M.J.', 'engaged', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'addition', 'utterly', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'film', 'sappy', 'dialogue', 'terrible', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'Peter', 'revealing', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'was', 'indirectly', 'responsible', 'uncle', 'death', 'SPIDERMAN', 'as', 'well', 'absurd', 'again', 'unnecessary', 'moment', 'where', 'major', 'reveal', 'subway', 'train', 'SPIDERMAN', 'hinted', 'Peter', 'was', 'going', 'develop', 'hero', 'be', 'reckoned', '2', 'regressed', 'being', 'more', 'juvenile', 'was', 'start', '1', 'One', 'biggest', 'fails', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'main', 'villain', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'played', 'decently', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'work', 'do', 'too', 'tragedy', 'interesting', 'villain', 'done', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'manner', 'sappiest', 'moment', 'climax', 'extremely', 'cheesy', 'scene', 'errr', 'communicating', 'octopus', 'arms', 'Parker', 'mean', 'Spiderman', ""n't"", 'have', 'darn', 'mask', 'just', 'most', 'movie', 'turn', 'away', 'evil', 'villain', 'up', 'GREATEST', 'COMIC-BOOK', 'SUPERHERO', 'MOVIE', 'ALL', 'TIME', 'Yeah', 'right']",Spider-Man 2
621034,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JMQW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 2]","Most people moan and complain about sequels once they are out. And even when they are only mentioned. For a long time sequels are looked down upon, and are almost never as good as the original. But a superior sequel, while rare, does happen. Just look at ""Aliens"" and ""Terminator 2"", among few others. And so Sam Raimi and his cast and crew have done one of those rare hollywood achievements. A big Hollywood sequel that's so much better than the original. Not saying anything about part 1, of course. Here, with a bigger budget, more dazzling effects, a better, more interesting villain, and a more richly textured script and story with more heart and meaning, the films eclipses the first one on all levels. I am surprised with how well I took in the franchise because I was never a Spider-Man fan when I was little. Knew absolutely nothing about it. What a surprise. Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker, still a young kid now in college, who is trying desperatley to keep his life together, although with school, a job, and being a web slinging superhero, it's not going very well. Enter Dr. Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist whose recent research is funded by Peter's good friend, Harry Osborne(James Franco), who is out for revenge against Spiderman who he thinks killed his father. Things go bad when Dr. Octavius' new experiment foes horribly awry(don't they always?), and soon his tentacle arms he created are now a part of his body. Instead of getting help, the tentacles become more ominous and soon Doc Ock(as he is now referred too)begins to go mad to continue his research. What will he get?. Harry offers Doc Ock whatever he needs, if he brings Spiderman to him. Besides all that, there is the ongoing story of Peter's love for the lovely Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And this is what's so great about the movie, and how it foes against the expected Hollywood conventions. The action and all of the superhero aspect of the movie is not what's important. It's not what's going on here. It's not how to make it bigger and bigger and throw in a storyline here to balance it out. In these movies, the movie is about the people. Not the heroics or the effects or whatever. Raimi and his writers create characters that, under some odd circumstances, are real. People we believe in. The movie doesn't come back two years later and throw these people into just another wild adventure. The characters grow as anyone in reality does, and they are where they should be in two years. They don't stay in once place. They grow and mature and the storylines develop and go further, instead of forgetting everything and just making another movie. It's about the story and characters, and in this day and age, that is so refrshing and welcomed. The actors here are as good as ever. Maguire continues to prove that he is an excellent Peter Parker, and makes a convincing super hero. Kirsten Dunst emits just a lovely radiance that really makes her seem like the sweet girl next door that anybody would fall in love with, even tho her character still kinda becomes the ""damsel in distress"" here. James Franco is good, but his obsession with revenge got old pretty fast. It was a nice story arc for him and the movie, but it got annoying. Whenever you saw him, he would just change direction and throw it in Peter's face. Or at the party when he, drunkenly, sloshes up to Peter and just starts accosting him. It just felt pushed more than anything else. Alfred Molina was so much more likeable as the villain, because he had the humanity left in him. At the end, he was the nice guy we met earlier on. Willem Dafoe, who cameos, was good, but Molina and the character of Doc Ock was just so much better. It was also nice that J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris got bigger roles as well. And yes, Raimi regular Bruce Campbell makes another welcomed cameo. As does Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. Things happen in this movie that will forever change things in the next film. I won't say what they are, but it will bring a new dynamic to the ongoing storyline for Part 3. The extras on the DVD are also incredible and exhausting. Spider-Man 2 has been hailed as the best superheo movie ever, and while I have another one that takes that place, this one is definitley strong enough to take that title. This movie makes Spider-Man 3 that much more exciting.

621040,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B00005JMQW,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[1, 1]","This movie takes up where the first one left off. Peter (Toby Maguire) has fallen on bad times he is a loner happy because he knows as Spiderman he can not have friends including Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst); the bad guys would use his friends as pawns. Everything is going to pot. He loses his job, cant pay his rent, his aunt is on foreclosure, he can not make schedule on anything he does. His best friend is out to get Spiderman.

I saw this dvd of Spider-Man2 in 3-D at home using a new kind of 3-D glasses they've got here on Amazon. They let you watch normal movies in 3D.TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-DAnd Spider-Man 2 looked really great. But what really stood out for me in this movie was the portrayal  of Doctor Octopus. The actor managed to make Doc. Oc both ruthlessly dangerous, and humanly relatable at the same time. My favorite scenes were when Doc. Oc was climbing the buildings, all those arms moving around everywhich way. And the scene where he and Spider-Man have a fight on a moviing train were awesome!This movie had a good solid storyline, and plot, as well as some of the best characterization of any of the Marvel franchise movies. The action scenes were intense (especially in 3-D) but they always advanced the plot. While they were definitely eye candy, they were also important to the storyline. This movie also continues the storyline of the Goblin, which culminates in Spider-Man 3. (I went and saw Spider-Man 3 at the theater and took my 3-D glasses. It looked amazing, especially the Sandman and the final battle between all the characters. I can't wait to get it on DVD and see it again at home.)

All of the characters are back.  Tobey McGuire is great as the bumbling Peter Parker who has to deal with the pressures of leading a normal life while at the same time being a super hero.  Kristen Dunst is beautiful as the vulnerable Mary Jane who deep down loves Peter but has been able to move on to another man.  James Franco is good as the tormented Harry Osborne who values Peter as a friend but is still haunted by his father's death by Spiderman.Warning: spoiler belowDoctor Otto Octavious is being sponsored by Oscorp and Harry to develop a new form of energy.  When that goes wrong, Otto becomes Doc Ock, a man with 4 metal tentacles with a mind of their own.  The usual dual with Spiderman follows, but the heart of this movie lies in the characters and the dilemmas they face.  In the end, we'll see Dr. Octavious redeem himself in spite of the tentacles that have fused themselves to his spine.Harry continues his quest to discover the identity of Spiderman.  Harry makes several discoveries that will be key plot points of the sequel.But the best part of the plot is between Mary Jane and Peter.  Peter loves Mary Jane but doesn't want to get involved with her, fearing him being Spiderman might harm her.  Thus, Peter appears very irresponsible and Mary Jane assumes he doesn't like her and he has let her down so many times she just doesn't want to see him anymore.  As a viewer, I wanted Peter to somehow let Mary Jane know he does love her and redeem Peter in her eyes.  But unfortunately, this never happens.The movie takes a surprising turn in the end and throws all the conflict between Mary Jane and Peter away by revealing in the battle with Doc Ock that Peter is really Spiderman.  Thus, all of the doubts Mary Jane had with Peter are washed away without Peter, or the movie having to expend any effort.The superman movies allowed Lois to discover that Clark was Superman and it hurt that series.

With sights that high, it's tough to come out of the theatre completely statisfied. This movie came close to my expectations, but not quite. On the positives: Great story, great casting, fantastic special effects, great villian, good acting, no foul language, no nudity, and some great action sequences. As for the negative, there are a few flaws that annoyed me.Okay, what is the deal? Why is is that every director, that makes a superhero movie, thinks that the audience wants to see him unmasked to everybody. Every stinking superhero movie made now has the hero unmasking himself(Batman, Superman, Spider Man, Daredevil, etc). WHy? The secret identity exists for a reason. In the comics, these characters take great care in protecting their identity. Not so in the movies. In these flicks, the hero's are all too happy to allow themselves to be unmasked to everyone. It's really stupid. This movie is no different. Peter Parker reveals himself to just about everyone: Mary Jane, Doc Ock, Harry Osbourne, and a train car full of people. It makes no sense that he's worried about protecting his loved ones(like Mary Jane) from his enemies, but then reveals himself to everyone. The only other probelm I had with this film is that some scenes were just silly and drawn out and could have been omitted without affecting the story. For instance, way too much time is spent dealing with Peter's landlord. We get the idea that he's behind on his rent, so why do we need to see 10 - 15 minutes of it? I'd say about 30 minutes of storyline could have been taken out and not affected the quality of this movie.In conclusion, this movie is still top notch and I recommend it too all.

Choices are very important, and sometimes it can be hard to make the right choice.The other great thing about this film is the villain. Whereas the Green Goblin in the previous film was just utterly insane and evil, Doc Ock fights for a greater cause.

621052,AWNKEM8DAG8PY,B00005JMQW,Brian Conway,"[1, 2]","The idea that Spider-Man 2.1 is a gimmick should come as a surprise to no one.  With the release of Spider-Man 3, very possibly the most anticipated movie of 2007, right around the corner, it is only logical that Marvel would try to cash in on the unprecedented hype surrounding the franchise's latest entry.  Setting this fact aside and looking at Spider-Man 2.1 for what it is, fans of the soon-to-be trilogy will surely enjoy this DVD release.  With eight extra minutes of footage, not only extending scenes but also completely reworking the story in some areas, Spider-Man 2.1 is quite a different experience from the theatrical release of Spider-Man 2.  To start, the breath-taking fight sequences during the bank robbery and on the train have been added to in subtle, but brilliant, ways; for example, when Spidey launches himself like a rocket into Doc Ock or when Doc knocks Spider-Man out a window only to be taken along for the ride.  These clips that last no more than a few seconds a piece make the fights much more intense.  They work wonderfully, the result feeling even closer to the scrappy, up-close and personal fights that Spidey and Doc Ock had in the original comics.  The rest of the material added is questionable.  While there are funny moments such as the alternate take of Spidey and Hal Sparks in the elevator or Jameson's new scene involving the spider-suit, they don't really add anything to the film.  The other extended and added bits, though they add depth to the relationships between the characters, don't flow right with what was here previously.  The main reason this is a problem is the lack of Sam Raimi's presence on the project.  As far as one can tell from the DVD, Raimi had no involvement in this release whatsoever. This version of the movie is filled with scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for a reason--not because they're bad per se but because they don't work with the best of the material that Raimi used to make up his theatrical cut of Spider-Man 2.  If Raimi had been allowed to make a director's cut, it stands to reason that there could have been a version of Spider-Man 2 superior to the theatrical release.  As it is, Spider-Man 2.1 is an interesting experiment that didn't really need to be conducted. Even the coordinator on this project admits in the ""Inside 2.1"" featurette that the theatrical cut will be the one that people will remember.  Even so, those interested enough to watch Spider-Man 2.1 will most likely find it intriguing and get some enjoyment from this unnecessary but harmless curiosity.",3,Spider-Man 2.1 (3 stars),1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,2577,"['idea', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'gimmick', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'one', 'release', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'very', 'possibly', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movie', '2007', 'right', 'corner', 'only', 'logical', 'Marvel', 'would', 'try', 'cash', 'unprecedented', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'franchise', 'latest', 'entry', 'Setting', 'fact', 'aside', 'looking', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'what', 'fans', 'soon-to-be', 'trilogy', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'release', 'eight', 'extra', 'minutes', 'footage', 'not', 'only', 'extending', 'scenes', 'also', 'completely', 'reworking', 'story', 'areas', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'quite', 'different', 'experience', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'start', 'breath-taking', 'fight', 'sequences', 'bank', 'robbery', 'train', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'subtle', 'brilliant', 'ways', 'example', 'when', 'Spidey', 'rocket', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'when', 'Doc', 'Spider-Man', 'out', 'window', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'along', 'ride', 'clips', 'last', 'more', 'few', 'piece', 'make', 'fights', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'result', 'feeling', 'even', 'closer', 'scrappy', 'up-close', 'personal', 'fights', 'Spidey', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'had', 'original', 'comics', 'rest', 'material', 'added', 'questionable', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'such', 'alternate', 'take', 'Spidey', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'elevator', 'Jameson', 'new', 'scene', 'involving', 'spider-suit', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'other', 'extended', 'added', 'bits', 'add', 'depth', 'relationships', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'right', 'what', 'was', 'here', 'previously', 'main', 'reason', 'problem', 'lack', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'presence', 'project', 'As', 'far', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'DVD', 'Raimi', 'had', 'involvement', 'release', 'whatsoever', 'version', 'movie', 'filled', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'reason', 'not', ""'re"", 'bad', 'se', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'best', 'material', 'Raimi', 'used', 'make', 'up', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Raimi', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'make', 'director', 'cut', 'reason', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'version', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'superior', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'interesting', 'experiment', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'be', 'conducted', 'Even', 'coordinator', 'project', 'Inside', '2.1', 'featurette', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'will', 'remember', 'Even', 'so', 'interested', 'enough', 'watch', 'Spider-Man', '2.1', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'intriguing', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'unnecessary', 'harmless', 'curiosity']",Spider-Man 2

In this second installment of the series Spidey battles another deranged scientist, the multi-appendaged Doctor Octopus played by Alfred Molina.Along with the expected high quality special effects, terrific action sequences and unfulfilled romantic desires between Peter Parker (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) this storyline delves into the deeper, more complex aspects of the Parker/Spider-Man psyche. The death of his best friends Father and his beloved Uncle Ben, his inability to share his secret with the girl he loves and the heavy responsibility of being a superhero take a toll on a young man. Is it better than the first?

621056,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B00005JMQW,Brian J Hay,"[8, 8]","Peter Parker can stop any crook (generally pretty easily) but he can't make it to an appointment on time. He can reach out to his friends and family but when they begin reaching back he sometimes can't be there. When they want an explanation, he's stuck. The writers and producers have captured Pete's dilemma perfectly. Tobey Maguire brings it to life. His portrayal of Peter Parker, with all his strength, frailty (and borderline neurosis) is perfect. Kirsten Dunst excels as his foil. She's the one who most wants most to believe that there's an explanation and that he's really trying, regardless of how things look. Rosemary Harris brings a sense of vibrancy to the character of Aunt May that was sometimes lacking in the original strip. The emotional range given to these characters is immense and the principles involved capture it without becoming excessive. Whenever the action involving the superpowers the character has strains belief the humanity of these figures serves to remind viewers that they're people like anyone else.The role the supporting characters play is just as pivotal to the success of the film. J.K. Simmons has begun to flesh out the character of J. Jonah Jameson. If there are more sequels it'll be interesting to see what the producers give him to do with it. James Franco has done the same the same thing with the character of Harry Osborn. He was given more to work with as well. The only complaint here is that the direction his role is being directed in seems too obvious. Still, there could be a few surprises.Casting Alfred Molina in the role of Doctor Octopus, and the treatment given to the character was a stroke of genius. He's sympathetic character who's capable of great evil, one that's compassionate but monstrous and brilliant but ruled by his ego. The role of Doc Ock is the only one where the player is called on to overact to any great degree. It would have been easy for the character to become a caricature because of it but Molina keeps that from happening. He manages each and every facet of the role with great aplomb. His performance is a triumph.Without these facets intact some of the greatest action scenes ever done and any amount of fabulous CGI work would be meaningless. The strength of the Spider-Man series from the early days of the comic series through to the present has always been the principle characters in the series. Peter Parker was (and still is) the great 'every-man' of the medium. His world was everyone's world. The writers involved, Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Michael Chabon, and Alvin Sargent, along with Director Sam Raimi recognized that point and stayed true to it. His world was a mirror of the conundrum everyone faces and his spider powers just served as a trigger for it. The producers of the films have made it a point to stay true to that. Because of that, the CGI work (which is excellent), and the action scenes (which are exceptionally well done) only serve to enhance a film was already well on its way to being a great one.And this is a great one.",5,An Exceptional Film,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,3045,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'can', 'stop', 'crook', 'generally', 'pretty', 'easily', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'appointment', 'time', 'can', 'reach', 'out', 'friends', 'family', 'when', 'begin', 'reaching', 'back', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'there', 'When', 'want', 'explanation', 'stuck', 'writers', 'producers', 'have', 'captured', 'Pete', 'dilemma', 'perfectly', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'life', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'strength', 'frailty', 'borderline', 'neurosis', 'perfect', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'foil', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'most', 'believe', 'explanation', 'really', 'trying', 'regardless', 'how', 'things', 'look', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'sense', 'vibrancy', 'character', 'Aunt', 'May', 'was', 'sometimes', 'lacking', 'original', 'strip', 'emotional', 'range', 'given', 'characters', 'immense', 'principles', 'involved', 'capture', 'becoming', 'excessive', 'Whenever', 'action', 'involving', 'superpowers', 'character', 'strains', 'humanity', 'figures', 'remind', 'viewers', ""'re"", 'people', 'anyone', 'else.The', 'role', 'supporting', 'characters', 'play', 'just', 'pivotal', 'success', 'film', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'begun', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'are', 'more', 'sequels', ""'ll"", 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'producers', 'give', 'do', 'James', 'Franco', 'done', 'same', 'same', 'thing', 'character', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'here', 'direction', 'role', 'being', 'directed', 'too', 'obvious', 'Still', 'could', 'be', 'few', 'surprises.Casting', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'role', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'treatment', 'given', 'character', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', 'capable', 'great', 'evil', 'one', 'compassionate', 'monstrous', 'brilliant', 'ruled', 'ego', 'role', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'only', 'one', 'where', 'player', 'called', 'overact', 'great', 'degree', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'character', 'become', 'caricature', 'Molina', 'happening', 'facet', 'role', 'great', 'aplomb', 'performance', 'triumph.Without', 'facets', 'intact', 'greatest', 'action', 'scenes', 'ever', 'done', 'amount', 'fabulous', 'CGI', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'meaningless', 'strength', 'Spider-Man', 'series', 'early', 'days', 'comic', 'series', 'present', 'always', 'been', 'principle', 'characters', 'series', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'still', 'great', ""'every-man"", ""'"", 'medium', 'world', 'was', 'everyone', 'world', 'writers', 'involved', 'Alfred', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'Alvin', 'Sargent', 'Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'recognized', 'point', 'stayed', 'true', 'world', 'was', 'mirror', 'conundrum', 'everyone', 'spider', 'powers', 'just', 'served', 'trigger', 'producers', 'films', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'stay', 'true', 'CGI', 'work', 'excellent', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'only', 'serve', 'enhance', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'way', 'being', 'great', 'one.And', 'great', 'one']",Spider-Man 2

Leed ""Jesus says, 'Go and Sin No More!""","[16, 17]","SPIDER-MAN 2 is one of the best movies ever, in my opinion--lots of heart, great characters, great writing, great action, great moral to the story, great performances and special effects! So I am a little disappointed with this 2007 DVD release of the 2.1 version.This review is for the 2.1 DVD version of SPIDER-MAN 2. It is INFERIOR to the original DVD/theaterical version because the 8 minutes of new footage often REPLACES original scenes, (not just adds new footage), and the replaced footage is always best the original way!The new footage rates okay to great, as long as it does not replace any original scenes, in my opinion. So this 2.1 version of SPIDER-MAN 2 is interesting, if you really know the original version, then you can try to catch what is different. Sometimes it is just an added line of dialogue, sometimes it is a complete scene. This is all good until they start pulling out the original scenes choices and replace it with this ""new"" footage. The original scenes were better.I think they also monkeyed with the timing of many scenes, which now feel too rushed.The best stuff on this 2.1 DVD is the ADDED stuff (not the REPLACEMENT stuff). You get a scene with MJ talking with her friend about marrying the astronaut, and the perfect kiss from her fantasy man (as seen in SPIDER-MAN 1, and referenced again in SPIDER-MAN 3). There is a brief scene when J. Jonah Jameson puts on the found Spider-man costume and pretends in his office. There are 11 extra seconds of the Doc Ock fight with Aunt May at stake, where Spidey and Doc Ock break through a window and pound on each other while a woman watches in fear.There are also many more brief additions of minor dialogue and brief footage. My favorite is when they first show Peter Parker hanging his tired head in his dumpy apartment. In the original version the scene stops there--depressing surroundings, but in the 2.1 version, they briefly end the scene with Peter reaching to turn on his police scanner radio, to monitor for some criminal action for Spidey to get busy with! This changes the tone of the scene immensely, in that being Spider-man is saving him from the dreariness! I like the added police scanner shot, and it also appears again, more often, in SPIDER-MAN 3! Cool!A strange piece of dialogue added is when MJ and Peter are talking in Aunt May's backyard, and MJ says she is seeing someone now. In the original, Peter asks if it is like a boyfriend, but in the 2.1 version, first he asks if it is therapy, then he asks if it is a boyfriend. This is cool because you get more without losing the original, though it is a strange comment!Sometimes things seem rushed and the timing is off, or small, little things are replaced.A major scene that ANYBODY will recognize as being completely REPLACED (and not as good as the original) is the scene on the elevator, when Spider-man meets the guy walking his dog. This is a completely different conversation, more dumb than funny, and you completely lose the original conversation which actually was funny.The Director's Commentary is with producer Laura Ziskin and writer Alvin Sargent. (NOTE: Kirsten Dunst in NOT included in the Director's Commentary, though some information online says she is). This Director's Commentary is pretty interesting, with some fun trivia and insight into the writing and production, despite the absence of the actual director and any actor from the film.The bonus disk is okay. Not too long, not too short. If you like Making Of documentary stuff, then here is about an hour's worth.If you have never seen SPIDER-MAN 2, then get the original version on DVD before getting this 2.1 version! But, if you already own and love the original version, then get this 2.1 version and watch it with a friend, and have fun pointing out and finding the new stuff.",4,"For Serious Spider-man Fans ONLY.

621060,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JMQW,Caleb Williams,"[1, 1]","This review will be split into three parts, they will be split into The Story, The Characters and the Verdict. This will give you a fair and honest view of the characters, story and the movie itself.The Story: Harry Osborn has now taken over Oscorp and he's financially backing a scientist called Otto Octavius who's experimenting with sustained fusion as a way of replacing conventional fuels. In order for Otto so sustain the fusion reaction he's developed artificially intelligent arms that attach directly to his spine that he can control as if they were additional arms. One day while demonstrating his experiment, Otto is unable to contain the reaction and it all goes wrong. The experiment becomes unstable but Otto refuses to halt it, it eventually gets worse and his wife is killed and the neural inhibitor chip on the arms is destroyed and they are fused to Dr. Octavius' spine. Thanks to the help of Spiderman the plug is pulled on the experiment and nobody else is hurt, but Dr. Octavius blames Spidey for the disaster. The AI of the mechanical arms seem to tap into Dr. Octavius' brain and begins to manipulate him into wanting to try the experiment again and set out to kill Spiderman. Spidey begins to struggle with juggling his powers, his education and his job and on top of that he has to handle the difficulty of his powers constantly halting at the worst times. Mary Jane is becoming a successful stage actress and desperately wants Peter to be there when she needs him and Harry is looking for revenge against spiderman for killing his father.The Characters: I've discussed both Tobeys & Kirstens characters in my review for the first spiderman film and my feelings are generally the same. The character I'm going to discuss is the character of Dr. Octavius.Doc Oc:  Played by Alfred Molina this is an intelligent choice for Doc Oc as he genuinely looks like the Doc Oc from the comics. He gives us his own brand of intelligence and sophistication when showing us the mental anguish that the character is going through in the movie.Harry Osborn: We've seen a bit of a development in this character from the first movie. In that he was the kid with high expectations and a kid who idolised his father and was chasing after the girl (MJ). In this movie we're introduced to what some could consider a very different character, he seems arrogant yet he's tormented by the death of his father so he's someone who has a lot on his mind. James Franco is great at playing the tormented figure of Harry Osborn.The Verdict: This is clearly the strongest film of the three, the action sequences particularly the fight sequence on the train is one that really gets your heart racing. Alfred Molina really fits the Doc Oc character perfectly and he really makes it believable.

621063,A2V026TK7H80V3,B00005JMQW,Carl Cheng,"[10, 21]","I was one of the few who did not like the first movie too much, where its bad acting and 'great' story of adolescence was wasted on me.  It was still a good movie, just not great as many hailed it to be.  With the big hype for the second movie, I expected more - better acting, better story, and basically a better movie.  It did accomplish that but not without some flaws.Well, I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the first one but that's only because they decided to add so many cheesy one-liners, overly dramatic scenes, too-well scripted scenes for scenes that should be more improv, and fan-service (scenes where fans will derive more enjoyment from ala Yoda fight in Star Wars Episode 2).  Basically, most of my laughter and enjoyment was derived from points that I think the filmmakers didn't plan for, which I won't get into specifically due to revealing possible spoilers.  The acting was subpar on the part of James Franco, who I like a lot, but I will put that of because of direction and his character.  Tobey and Kirsten did a lot better this time around, and the other supporting characters really do shine.Story-wise, it was better.  I was surprised a few times that they decided to go a certain way already and my prediction for the villain of the third movie that I gathered since the first seems to be pretty much set (with possibilities of more).  The plot and characters were a lot more developed, spending time to accentuate those that needed it.  However, there were many times scenes were used that were just irrelevant or longer than needed, its pacing was off, and the change between scenes was odd making me stop and wonder why.  There was an imbalance of stories between that of Tobey's life as Peter Parker and that of Spiderman.  There were points where you forget about the villain, Doctor Octopus / Doc Ock, until a scene comes up with him doing whatever villains do.  Also, I'm not quite sure why they are making out Spiderman to be Superman because Spiderman should not be that strong, making him out to be invincible, which was never the case.  The point was that Spiderman was supposed to be more human, making him easy to relate to.  However, in this movie, he transcended that line becoming somewhat above humans especially with the number of people that were hailing him as a 'hero' to look up to.So, basically compared to the first, it is better, but I say not by much.  I don't think this was as well-polished as X2 and definitely had some flaws.  I think what they were going for was good but in that process, they changed a bit of what I visualized Spiderman and Peter Parker to be.",4,"Enjoyable, but so was Bring it On.",1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,2641,"['was', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'where', 'bad', 'acting', ""'great"", 'story', 'adolescence', 'was', 'wasted', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'many', 'hailed', 'be', 'big', 'hype', 'second', 'movie', 'expected', 'more', 'better', 'acting', 'better', 'story', 'basically', 'better', 'movie', 'did', 'accomplish', 'not', 'flaws.Well', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'only', 'decided', 'add', 'so', 'many', 'cheesy', 'one-liners', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'too-well', 'scripted', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'improv', 'fan-service', 'scenes', 'where', 'fans', 'will', 'derive', 'more', 'enjoyment', 'ala', 'Yoda', 'fight', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', '2', 'Basically', 'most', 'laughter', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'derived', 'points', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'specifically', 'due', 'revealing', 'possible', 'spoilers', 'acting', 'was', 'subpar', 'part', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'like', 'lot', 'will', 'put', 'direction', 'character', 'Tobey', 'Kirsten', 'did', 'lot', 'better', 'time', 'other', 'supporting', 'characters', 'really', 'do', 'shine.Story-wise', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'surprised', 'few', 'times', 'decided', 'go', 'certain', 'way', 'already', 'prediction', 'villain', 'third', 'movie', 'gathered', 'first', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'set', 'possibilities', 'more', 'plot', 'characters', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'developed', 'spending', 'time', 'accentuate', 'needed', 'However', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'scenes', 'were', 'used', 'were', 'just', 'irrelevant', 'longer', 'needed', 'pacing', 'was', 'off', 'change', 'scenes', 'was', 'odd', 'making', 'stop', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'imbalance', 'stories', 'Tobey', 'life', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Spiderman', 'were', 'points', 'where', 'forget', 'villain', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', '/', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'scene', 'up', 'doing', 'villains', 'do', 'Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'are', 'making', 'out', 'Spiderman', 'be', 'Superman', 'Spiderman', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'strong', 'making', 'be', 'invincible', 'was', 'never', 'case', 'point', 'was', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'human', 'making', 'easy', 'relate', 'However', 'movie', 'transcended', 'line', 'becoming', 'somewhat', 'humans', 'especially', 'number', 'people', 'were', 'hailing', ""'hero"", 'look', 'up', 'to.So', 'basically', 'compared', 'first', 'better', 'say', 'not', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'well-polished', 'X2', 'definitely', 'had', 'flaws', 'think', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'was', 'good', 'process', 'changed', 'bit', 'what', 'visualized', 'Spiderman', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'be']",Spider-Man 2

621066,A1N00127IDBHD6,B00005JMQW,CConn,"[0, 0]","I was, initially, one of the very few who wasn't ""blown away"" by the supposed brilliance of the first Spider-Man. My opinion changed later, however; for the better. But, at the time of SM2's release, I was still quite unimpressed with Director Raimi's first offering of Spider-Man. This, of course, affected by expectations on the sequel slightly. But then Spider-Man 2 came and, frankly, surprised the hell out of me. Every little problem I had with the original, seemed to be either corrected or lessened. This wasn't just a fun little popcorn movie like the first. This was an epic. And this was excellent.Like its predecessor Spider-Man 2 is a fun, light, (sometimes campy) movie. However it adds on to that enjoyable premise an increased quality of acting, and a greater depth in both characterization and plot.While SM1 was little more than the cinematic equivalent of bubble gum, SM2 turns the Spider-Man movie series into a full-blown saga. The changes from the first film are subtle on their own (stepped up dialogue and acting, better subplots, and a larger scope overall, to name a few), but all together, these improvements lift Spider-Man 2 above almost any other superhero movie to date.At the center of it all is, obviously, Peter Parker; Spider-Man. Everything around him is larger this time around; his problems (both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man), his fears, and most of all, his enemies. And, of course, just as the danger surrounding him becomes greater, his life quickly begins to fall apart. We open the film with Peter struggling desperately to balance his two lives, his two identities, as Peter Parker's life is slowly being taken over by Spider-Man's, and the world's near-constant need for his heroics. We also delve deeper into his relationship (or lack thereof) with the girl of his dreams Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). This, also, is going less-than-splendidly for Peter. All in all, at the beginning of the film, life is going pretty poorly for ol' Spidey.The man to bring this all to life on the screen is none other than Tobey Maguire. And, honestly, he does a pretty spectacular job of it. Carrying over from his performance in SM1, Maguire adds a greater amount of depth and believability, that improves his character, and in turn, the film as a whole.However, Maguire isn't quite the highlight of the film. That honor falls to Alfred Molina, and his amazing performance as Doc Ock. Molina was simply born to play the roll. Ock, or rather Dr. Octavius, is a kindly scientist and mentor when he needs to be, and conversely, a cold-hearted killer when it is called for, and, at times, a little bit in between. Though, the real beauty of the performance, I believe, is Molina's perfect execution of serious acting, with a light, often ""fun"" delivery. It's fun to watch, but it's not campy, it's not silly. It's just Molina having fun with a role; delivering every line with excellent fervor and zest. Molina's Doc Ock may very well be the best film villain yet in a superhero movie.While Ock may not be campy, J.K. Simmons' portrayal of J. Jonah Jameson sure is. As Peter's grouchy, demanding boss, Simmons' delivers corny line after corny line with such skill and ease that he transcend the normal (negative) bounds of camp, and turns it into something that's actually fun, and extremely enjoyable. The rest of the supporting cast is strong, though not particularly memorable, and Rosemary Harris, James Franco, etc. all deserve mention for their roles in the film.In all honesty, I had never even heard of Sam Raimi before the first Spider-Man, I have quickly become quite a fan of his. He captures the mood of Spider-Man's word perfectly, both storywise, and visually. Every scene is injected with bright and vibrant color palate to create a very comic book-like feel to the movie. His crafting of the story is also quite enjoyable. Some have criticized the film for it's rather slow-moving second act, but I found the ""slow-down"" quite apt in regards to the story; adding to the rather one-man epic feel of the movie.The weakest part(s) of the film would without doubt have to be the love story with Mary Jane, and the woman that plays her, Kristen Dunst. Despite actually liking her as a child actress, it simply astounds me why ""they"" ever picked Dunst for the role. It's nothing horrible to be sure, but it's certainly nothing great, and Dunst just doesn't had anything to either her character or the movie as a whole. This may not entirely be her fault however as the romance does plays out much like a teenage soap opera, with quite a few corny lines, and stupid situations.Luckily, the romance does little damage to the film overall; the solid acting from MaGuire and the supporting cast, the absolutely excellent acting of Alfred Molina, and Raimi's strong direction more than make up for it. Which in the end leaves us with what is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put on film.9/10",5,The Epic Known as Spider-Man,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,4935,"['was', 'initially', 'one',

A scientist wants to try out an expierement, everything goes wrong, scientist goes crazy, and wants to stop Spiderman and have everything go his way. Nothing original here.Some flaws include Mary Jane Watson, Doc Ock, and well Peter losing his powers.Why is M.J. Watson in this movie? What use does she have, except for a reason to make Peter lose his powers? She is worthless in this storyline, she is annoying too. The love story doesn't make sense, Peter talks with M.J. for about 2 minutes and then she ""loves him"" and cries when he leaves her (I know it happens in the first movie, but still, it's stupid, the love story is obviously faked.)Doc Ock was in this movie for about 10 minutes, and about 8 of those minutes he was a good guy or he was talking with Harry. The train/bank fight was cool, but way too short. The last ""battle"" was pathetic, he spends days or whatever trying to make this energy whatever and then Peter tells Doc Ock what Otto taught Peter and Doc Ock changes (somehow), blah blah blah, boring.Why did Peter lose his powers?

Then I was dreading the let-down of a sequel.  But Spider-Man 2 joins Empire Strikes Back in the pantheon of sequels that exceed the original (does that reference make me an uber-geek?  Yeah, but you knew what I meant).This movie is dead-on true to the comic, from Peter's real-life difficulties to Doc Ock's maniacal genius to the public's attitude towards Spider-Man.  The entire ""feel"" is like you've been transported into this parallel New York where superheroes and supervillians are a fact of life.  And not to be overlooked is J.K.

621069,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B00005JMQW,Char,"[0, 0]","Spiderman (who is essentially Superman in a different outfit) versus his evil super-spider counterpart.A really fabulous movie about epic Do-Good heroism in which the double personality of Peter Parker/Spiderman undergoes an identity crisis as he tries  to decide who he really is and who he will CHOOSE to be, all in the midst of being pulled apart by his circumstances.Two of the big questions Peter/Spiderman must face in coming into his own are:  Should he choose a normal down-to-earth existence instead of living out his effective gift for doing super-good that interferes with the usual life of merely ordinary achievement?  And, could someone who is an exceptional do-gooder like Spiderman is--always liable to have super-enemies--give himself to human love or marriage?Spiderman's evil counterpart, a genius Super-but-Human/Machine whose ""web"" must ultimately crash into destructive havoc, also undergoes identity crisis and ultimate choices.If you haven't already put aside any stuffy prejudice you might have about this being trivial kid's-stuff from ComicLand, trumped up with awesome meaningless exaggerated Super Effects out of evil Hollywood, do put them aside right now and hasten to Watch this Super Show.  It is epic Idealism, all to the GOOD.  And it is all innocently presented!  There's nothing here to offend anyone's good moral code.It's a very uplifting movie, in more than one way, to say the least.Whoever designed the intricacies of all the battles and special effects in the movie is a real-life super Genius with a wild and daring sense of engineering!  To watch this movie is to be filled with Wonder.Since I have a fear of heights, I felt very uncomfortable tension watching some scenes.  But if you see the movie on a TV or computer screen, you don't feel as much the fullness of the special effects that you would in a theater and I was better able to bear the movie as seen on the smaller screen.  When I saw just the previews of the first Spiderman movie in a theater, I felt way too much fearful sensation regarding the high-flying sequences.  Another thing that I had a reaction against was the too-real, scarry effect of an immense amount of shattered glass flying out of the screen in one scene.I'm really enthusiastic about this movie and recommend it highly.  I enjoy it and like it from a feminine point of view, but I'd venture to say that for guys it would be at least as exciting as watching a Super-bowl game, and probably even much more so.(Besides the movie disc, there's also a disc with special features.)",5,Uplifting in more ways than one!,1326844800,"01 18, 2012",2012,2555,"['Spiderman', 'who', 'essentially', 'Superman', 'different', 'outfit', 'evil', 'super-spider', 'counterpart.A', 'really', 'fabulous', 'movie', 'epic', 'Do-Good', 'heroism', 'double', 'personality', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'identity', 'crisis', 'decide', 'who', 'really', 'who', 'will', 'CHOOSE', 'be', 'midst', 'being', 'pulled', 'apart', 'circumstances.Two', 'big', 'questions', 'Peter/Spiderman', 'must', 'face', 'coming', 'own', 'are', 'Should', 'choose', 'normal', 'down-to-earth', 'existence', 'instead', 'living', 'out', 'effective', 'gift', 'doing', 'super-good', 'usual', 'life', 'merely', 'ordinary', 'achievement', 'could', 'someone', 'who', 'exceptional', 'do-gooder', 'Spiderman', 'always', 'liable', 'have', 'super-enemies', 'give', 'human', 'love', 'marriage', 'Spiderman', 'evil', 'counterpart', 'genius', 'Super-but-Human/Machine', 'web', 'must', 'ultimately', 'crash', 'destructive', 'havoc', 'also', 'undergoes', 'identity', 'crisis', 'ultimate', 'choices.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'put', 'aside', 'stuffy', 'prejudice', 'might', 'have', 'being', 'trivial', ""kid's-stuff"", 'ComicLand', 'trumped', 'up', 'awesome', 'meaningless', 'exaggerated', 'Super', 'Effects', 'evil', 'Hollywood', 'do', 'put', 'aside', 'right', 'now', 'hasten', 'Watch', 'Super', 'Show', 'epic', 'Idealism', 'GOOD', 'innocently', 'presented', 'nothing', 'here', 'offend', 'anyone', 'good', 'moral', 'code.It', 'very', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'say', 'least.Whoever', 'designed', 'intricacies', 'battles', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'real-life', 'super', 'Genius', 'wild', 'daring', 'sense', 'engineering', 'watch', 'movie', 'be', 'filled', 'Wonder.Since', 'have', 'fear', 'heights', 'felt', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'tension', 'watching', 'scenes', 'see', 'movie', 'TV', 'computer', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'much', 'fullness', 'special', 'effects', 'would', 'theater', 'was', 'better', 'able', 'bear', 'movie', 'seen', 'smaller', 'screen', 'When', 'saw', 'just', 'previews', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'movie', 'theater', 'felt', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'fearful', 'sensation', 'regarding', 'high-flying', 'sequences', 'thing', 'had', 'reaction', 'was', 'too-real', 'scarry', 'effect', 'immense', 'amount', 'shattered', 'glass', 'flying', 'screen', 'one', 'scene.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'enthusiastic', 'movie', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enjoy', 'feminine', 'point', 'view', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'guys', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'as', 'exciting', 'watching', 'Super-bowl', 'game', 'probably', 'even', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'disc', 'also', 'disc', 'special', 'features']",Spider-Man 2

621071,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B00005JMQW,Chrijeff,"[0, 0]","This is the winter (or perhaps the autumn) of Peter Parker's discontent.  Two years after receiving his spider-powers, his life seems to be falling into chaos.  He's devoting so much time to fighting crime as Spiderman that his part-time job (from which he's fired in the first 15 minutes of the movie) and his college career are floundering.  For reasons unclear, he's no longer rooming with his buddy Harry Osborn, who has assumed the chieftainship at Oscorp; instead he's living in a poky one-room apartment in a shabby old brick building--and he's in arrears.  His beloved Mary Jane Watson, who's made it as a model and on Broadway, is mad at him because he hasn't come to see her in ""The Importance of Being Earnest.""  And he's discovered that his Aunt May's house, where he grew up, is being foreclosed on.  Then he finds that his webbing isn't always shooting when he calls on it, and he can't always stick to the walls he tries to crawl.  A doctor pronounces him healthy--physically.  What's a floundering Spiderman to do?To makes matter worse, a new villain has arisen in New York--Dr. Otto Octavius, a physicist who, in trying to originate a working fusion process for Oscorp, is transformed into the terrifying Dr. Octopus.  Peter's first battle with him is nearly fatal, though he does contrive to rescue his endangered aunt.  Shaken, he begins to doubt his calling.  In the end, his solution is to ""hang it up""--or rather, to dump his costume in the garbage (it ends up mounted on Jonah Jameson's office wall).  But there's no rest for a hero.  Gradually, with Aunt May's unwitting help, he realizes that his Uncle Ben was right: great powers require great responsibility, and he'll ""always be Spiderman.""Besides the continuing angst that is a Marvel trademark, this film is distinguished (of course) by eye-popping SFX--perhaps not *quite* so good as those in the first installment (when Doc Ock climbs up a wall, you can tell it's a computer animation), but still very impressive.  Especially noteworthy: Spidey's battles with Octopus and a thrilling sequence in which he barely manages to stop a runaway el-train (the fact that Manhattan doesn't have any of these any more is beside the point) with his webbing and nearly tears himself apart in the process.  (The following scene, in which the rescued passengers gently and carefully draw him into the car and to safety, is all the more affecting on account of the contrast.)  And Doc and his sentient robot arms, when seen at ""eye-level,"" are definitely among the better film villains on DVD.  Both Spidey and Ock are human-scale despite their powers, capable of doubt and, in the latter's case, reformation.  And there's a great surprise at the end of the film that makes all of Spidey's trials worthwhile.  In the final scene we see him (urged by Mary Jane to ""Go get 'em, tiger"") once again swinging through the skyscrapers toward another crisis, whooping joyously, with two NYPD choppers close behind him--a sort of symbolic suggestion of the possibility that he and the forces of law and order may finally be coming to an accommodation despite Jameson's ongoing (and, at one point, rather hypocritical) efforts to demonize him.  Though probably not for the youngest and most sensitive members of the family, this is a great wild adventure ride for everyone else, and may well serve as a launching point for some good conversations about ethics, perseverance, and the definition of heroism.",4,Spidey faces a crisis,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",2008,3461,"['winter', 'perhaps', 'autumn', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'discontent', 'Two', 'years', 'receiving', 'spider-powers', 'life', 'be', 'falling', 'chaos', 'devoting', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'fighting', 'crime', 'Spiderman', 'part-time', 'job', 'fired', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'college', 'career', 'are', 'floundering', 'reasons', 'unclear', 'no', 'longer', 'rooming', 'buddy', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'who', 'assumed', 'chieftainship', 'Oscorp', 'instead', 'living', 'poky', 'one-room', 'apartment', 'shabby', 'old', 'brick', 'building', 'arrears', 'beloved', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'who', 'made', 'model', 'Broadway', 'mad', ""n't"", 'come', 'see', 'Importance', 'Being', 'Earnest', 'discovered', 'Aunt', 'May', 'house', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'being', 'foreclosed', 'Then', 'webbing', ""n't"", 'always', 'shooting', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'stick', 'walls', 'crawl', 'doctor', 'healthy', 'physically', 'What', 'floundering', 'Spiderman', 'do', 'matter', 'worse', 'new', 'villain', 'arisen', 'New', 'York', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'physicist', 'who', 'trying', 'originate', 'working', 'fusion', 'process', 'Oscorp', 'transformed', 'terrifying', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'Peter', 'first', 'battle', 'nearly', 'fatal', 'contrive', 'rescue', 'endangered', 'aunt', 'Shaken', 'doubt', 'calling', 'end', 'solution', 'hang', 'up', 'rather', 'dump', 'costume', 'garbage', 'up', 'mounted', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'office', 'wall', 'rest', 'hero', 'Gradually', 'Aunt', 'May', 'unwitting', 'help', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'was', 'right', 'great', 'powers', 'require', 'great', 'responsibility', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'Spiderman', 'continuing', 'angst', 'Marvel', 'trademark', 'film', 'distinguished', 'course', 'eye-popping', 'SFX', 'perhaps', 'not', '*quite*', 'so', 'good', 'first', 'installment', 'when', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'up', 'wall', 'can', 'tell', 'computer', 'animation', 'still', 'very', 'impressive', 'Especially', 'noteworthy', 'Spidey', 'battles', 'Octopus', 'thrilling', 'sequence', 'barely', 'stop', 'runaway', 'el-train', 'fact', 'Manhattan', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'point', 'webbing', 'nearly', 'tears', 'apart', 'process', 'following', 'scene', 'rescued', 'passengers', 'gently', 'carefully', 'draw', 'car', 'safety', 'more', 'affecting', 'account', 'contrast', 'Doc', 'sentient', 'robot', 'arms', 'when', 'seen', 'eye-level', 'are', 'definitely', 'better', 'film', 'villains', 'DVD', 'Spidey', 'Ock', 'are', 'human-scale', 'powers', 'capable', 'doubt', 'latter', 'case', 'reformation', 'great', 'surprise', 'end', 'film', 'Spidey', 'trials', 'worthwhile', 'final', 'scene', 'see', 'urged', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Go', 'get', 'tiger', 'once', 'again', 'swinging', 'skyscrapers', 'crisis', 'whooping', 'joyously', 'two', 'NYPD', 'choppers', 'close', 'sort', 'symbolic', 'suggestion', 'possibility', 'forces', 'law', 'order', 'may', 'finally', 'be', 'coming', 'accommodation', 'Jameson', 'ongoing', 'one', 'point', 'rather', 'hypocritical', 'efforts', 'demonize', 'Though', 'probably', 'not', 'youngest', 'most', 'sensitive', 'members', 'family', 'great', 'wild', 'adventure', 'ride', 'everyone', 'else', 'may', 'well', 'serve', 'launching', 'point', 'good', 'conversations', 'ethics', 'perseverance', 'definition', 'heroism']",Spider-Man 2

This sequel is yet another worthy follow up from Sam Raimi, who've done a splendid job in recreating the SPIDERMAN Mythos for the present cinema's movie industry. Enter Doc Ock, that's well portrayed by the spanish/italian actor Alfred Molina- who is perfect for the role's bill I should say. There are cameos by no other than Bruce Campbell, and Stan Lee as well. No sign in the movieplots' deranged courtship of Doc Octopus for Aunt May (as it was in the comic books) - however, the battle between Dr Ock and Spidey's one among the toppermost best movie battlescenes that is ever seen on film. It could've been hackneyed, but hell no! it's damn great... reminds you of WWF's peak years back in the eighties, but only a lot more higher notch in the way the fight scenes are executed of course; the special effects by the way - are used in such great balance to the scenes that no fan of digital/CGI effects should miss.On the other hand, what's with MARVEL Comics' list of upcoming flicks from their line of titles with rumours of the GHOST RIDER movie coming along the way, and the new PUNISHER flick as well -- for XMEN3 it smells like it would be the dawning of the Pheonix saga,,, but then again - that is another story.Next stop SPIDEY faces the son of the Green Goblin, as Pete's best buddy dons to follow in the footsteps of his dad by wearing the costume in SPIDERMAN 3.

621073,A33IZJVCKFKDPU,B00005JMQW,Chris,"[8, 8]","When ""Spider-Man"" was released in 2002, I was amazed to see how good of a movie that Sam Raimi and writer David Koepp created about a comic book super hero.  Sony announced after seeing the huge box office sales that ""Spider-Man 2"" was set to release in 2004.  I was excited to hear that there would be more Spider-Man, but was also concerned.  My thought was that the first movie was so good that if the second one was a little less in quality, meaning its still a great movie but not as good as the first, that people will be disappointed and say that the movie sucks.  Well after seeing the movie, I don't have to worry about that anymore.The story continues two years from where the first one stopped.  Peter Parker is trying to balance school, work and a personal life, along with being Spider-Man.  He is always tired, not doing well in school, never able to fulfill committments and still chasing after Mary Jane, who is now a success stage actress.  Peter is doing a paper on Professor Otto Octavious and his new science experiment.  But when his experiment goes wrong, Octavious' wife gets killed and he is now controlled by the robotic arms that he attached to his body in order to do the experiment.  The robotic arms make him evil and convince him that he needs to rebuild his project that has the capability to destroy haf of New York.  So he goes on a crime streak to get some money, hence becoming enemies with Spider-Man.  Peter Parker is becoming frustrated with his crime fighting life, especially after he finds out MJ is engaged.  He decides that he doesn't want to be Spider-Man anymore and soon enough realizes that can't escape his destiny.  Thats enough story without giving too much away.The main players from the first movie are back in this one.  Tobey Maguire gives an amazing performance is this installment, a better performance than the first.  Thank God that he was able to make this movie.  Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Rosemarry Harris also return for this movie.  The new memeber Alfred Molina plays Doc Ock and does a pretty good job.  I don't think he gave as good of a performance as Willem DaFoe did, but still an excellent job.  The most important person that came back for the sequel was Sam Raimi.  Most movies that have continuing storylines get bad if they lose the director, i.e. Batman without Tim Burton.  The direction of this movie, along with the first one, are what make the movies great.As for the movie, this one has a more indepth storyline.  There is a lot of human emotion involved in the storyline.  I like the bad guy, Doc Ock.  He was my favorite bad guy in the comic books and the effects that were used and his creation to the big screen was awesome.  The action scenes were better in this movie and the special effects were a lot better.  My only grievence with the movie is that it moved slower than the first.

621075,A1OJ8LNA1JK171,B00005JMQW,Christopher Hansen,"[3, 3]","One of the only movies where I can say that the sequel is better than the original - by a mile. Excellent storyline, incredible graphics and special effects. Holds ""true to form"" for Marvel's printed material and original character development, ulike some of the other Marvel movies of late (ahem....Hulk, which was uniquely too ""dark""; and Punisher - when will they EVER get this ""right""). Doc Ock is an excellent character development, and played masterfully by Alfred Molina. Excellent Casting, Direction and Production. Masterful artwork on the CGI and special-effects, to the point where WYSIWYG - the viewer has no perception of the ""cheezy"" transitions of actual vs. computer-aided graphics in terms of the viewing, which plauged movies even just a few years ago.Follow-ups will likely include a host of very cool super villans, and some interesting overall plots twists and new interpersonal Peter Parker twists like Gwen Stacey, Aunt May's transformation into Madam Web, Venom, the Black Suit, etc. With over 40 years of comic books to tap into, most of which were outstanding in their own right, there is abundant material to make this a landmark series that can go on for years to come. One can only hope that Marvel will continue to insist on scripting the follow-ups as well as this picture (and the original) without butchering them by ""skipping"" or ""cramming"", which happens often (Marvel Take Note: Franchise Series...along with DD if you develop it correctly, so don't blow a good thing !!).Kids enjoyed immensely - And even though it carries PG rating, I let my 4 year old watch it (supervised, of course). Younger children should have a parent with them to explain some of the more violent action scenes - but if your kids read the comics (heh, they read my comics...haha) - they will have already been tought that it's just ""make believe super-hero stuff"" - ""just like the comics"". Once they digest that and make the connection, even the youger kids can enjoy it with a parent present.Adult purists will love the acting, script, character development, and the (more or less) adhearance to the original comic book series storyline and character development.

When I first heard that the villian was going to be Dr. Octopus, I was thoroughly disappointed, especially considering that many of the rumours involved Venom, Carnage, and some of Spider-Man's more colorful cast of villians. That being said, the way Dr. Octopus was portrayed was magnificient, especially the way with which Peter meets Dr. Octavius as a student at Columbia University. What drove this film (other than the terribly miscast Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson), was the notion that being a hero is as much a question of mental fortitude as it is a question of super-powers (although those help as well). Tobey Maguire makes the perfect Peter Parker, awkward yet affable. The opening scene where he tries to deliver pizzas before Sal's 30-minute guarantee expires, shows a full range of emotion - from excitement to pure disappointment at having lost yet another job. When Peter is released from his repsonsibilities as Spider-Man, a newfound joy enters his life and he is finally able to pursue without abandon both his studies and the girl next door - Mary Jane. I really can't say more positive things about this movie. I think I would have given it 4 stars if Kirsten Dunst was not in the movie, as well as if a better sense of Peter's homelife was provided.

The latest franchise film is Spider-Man 2, directed by Sam Raimi. The 1st Spider-Man was probably the best comic book film ever made- mostly because its leads- Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, & Kirsten Dunst as his love- Mary Jane Watson a) can both act (unlike, say Christopher Reeve as Superman), b) are well cast (unlike Michael Keaton in the 1st 2 Batman films). & c) have chemistry (unlike Reeve & Margot Kidder in the Superman films). Maguire, especially, is so good an actor that he is 1 of those rarities that can run a panoply of emotions through just his eyes. He is almost irresistible to watch onscreen.... All in all, a very good film, & along with the 1st film, simply the best superhero films ever made. I hope the writers from this film stick with the whole series because, next to Batman, Spidey probably has the best pantheon of villains in comic book lore. Future baddies could include Dr. Doom, Venom, Carnage, the Sandman, Rhino, the Lizard, & Electro, among others. But, what makes good writing in such a film valuable are the little moments- like Peter's confession to Aunt May about how & why Uncle Ben really died, a surreal moment on an elevator between Spidey & a shocked citizen, references to other characters in the Marvel Comics universe, allusions & parallels to Oscar Wilde's The Important Of Being Earnest, & a street musician singing the old Spider-Man tv cartoon series theme song from the 1960s. Such touches are what invigorate this franchise above the others & what killed off the increasingly dark & directionless Batman franchise.

If you do not, you might still like this movie, but probably not as much as you should.  However, if you do, this is probably the best one ever made.  Sam Raimi does a magnificent job with every aspect of this movie.  He recaps the first movie in drawings over the opening titles, and away we go.  The visual effects are much better than the first movie and the story line is more involved and, being Spider-Man, still achingly sad in a teen-age angst comic-book sort of way.Here I am thinking of Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) gazing from the stage at Peter's empty theater seat, not knowing that poor Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is indeed at the theater, being kept out by an overly officious usher.  It is touching in the way it is handled.  These are good actors portraying these roles.  It is an outlandish story, but played as if they were real people and all this exotic reality were perfectly normal.Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina is especially terffic) battle it out in terrific sequences, as they did in the original stories.  It is interesting how they create him in this film.  Of course, the whole story is preposterous.  That is not the point.  You have to get past that before the film starts.

MJ situations;-the ""My back, my back""--just an admitted last-minute added inside joke that ran the ""losing powers"" plotline into the ground and only served to allieviate the remaining bad feelings over the Maguire/Gylenhall debacle;-the ""Raindrops""/slo-mo joke--an obvious out of place but typical for the old Raimi weirdo scene that I thought he had dropped to become a ""serious"" filmmaker;Spidey 3 expectations:-lighten up on the Spidey sturm und drang--unless you have him experience an embarrasment of riches (introduce Gwen Stacey? he becomes an assistant teacher?) as 2 was perilously close to Darkman with all the gloom and doom;-more dramatic and comic interaction with Spidey and the police, Spidey with JJJ and Spidey with the villans--remember Spidey is Peter's true self coming out and that is a confident, devil-may-care personality that uses his spikey sense of humor as a weapon in itself--the humor at the expense of Peter is getting awful old and depressing already;-no more scientist meets with accident and turns evil villans--either have the villian as a real criminal scumbag that gains powers (ala Electro, Sandman, etc.) or a force of nature/alien like Man-Wolf or Venom;Bottom line:I really didn't notice the previously mentioned logic gaps by other board participants as the editing was so well-done I really didn't have a chance to thing about it--also, I was willing to fill in the gaps with my own internal reasoning (maybe Peter/Spidey was still passed out after Harry unmasked him and that's why he didn't break the bonds to prevent the unmasking, and maybe the little girl help up to Peter was figurative as Peter was able to tap into panicked power reserves to get himself up)--this movie was every bit as good if not better than X-Men 2 (altho X-Men 1 was not nearly as good as Spidey 1) and I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars but I cannot say I have seen the best comic book to movie adaption yet but then again I have high hopes for

I felt the whole thing dragged along, until the few action sequences, which were short. The CGI, in my opinion, really wasn't too great, some scenes were just too un-realistic to carry alot of weight. One problem I had with the first film which carried over to this one through most of it was Peter Parker shutting out Mary Jane, ""for her own saftey"". Was I the only one in the entire world who felt this was totally rediculous? The second film, at the end, seemed to resolve this, until the last fade-out. The look on Mary Jane's face left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I felt Doc Ock to be well-done and well-acted, but the descent into insanity seemed a bit contrived and fast. Overall, the study of what a person must sacrifice for an ideal is touching, but perhaps too deeply involved here. This is a superhero movie after all, not a session on a shrinks' couch.

It's 2 hours of build-up to a climatic fight with the Green Goblin that is woefully short and anti-cllimatic. The only thing I have to nitpick is the addition of NY citizens hurling stones at the Green Goblin, supposedly to show American spirit or unity. But it doesn't really work, because soon, these same civic-minded citizens did not appear again.Back to Spiderman 2. As with all superhero sequels, the main protaganist will be faced with new problems (personal,social,professional,etc.) as well as a new super-villian. This time, it's Doctor Octopus (a classic Spidey villian). Sam Raimi pummels Peter Parker with the sort of problems a socially inept geek would face in a high school.He works his character through various mishaps and obstacles. He's so engrossed with developing the character so wholeheartedly and thoroughly that he had forgotten to insert more action sequences,forgetting that he's actually directing a superhero movie.I caught this movie twice in the theatres. The first time round is the charm. The second time round, bored at having to sit through the exhausting exposition just to wait for the next action sequence to turn up, I actually timed the duration of any CGI action onscreen. It came up to about 22 minutes or so. Even the mmuch talked about and praised subway fight sequence lasted a mere 7 minutes.Talk about being short-changed! This is a 127 minute movie and that's only a mere 22 minutes of action and 100 plus minutes of puppy dog stares and ""soliloquys"" about the moral dilemma of being a superhero? Come on! I don't mean to grouse. I don't mind the exposition, but this is a superhero movie! Where are my money shots?X2 sort of delivers in the previous summer, but Spiderman 2 just didn't cut it.

It's not that Spiderman II is a bad movie, it's not, it is very watchable, but Jaws and Jurassic Park were sensational summer action movies that moved you emotionally - Spiderman II does not. The best parts of the movie were those with Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), and there were just not enough of them to suit me.

After the sheer brilliance that was `Spider-Man', Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had a great responsibility to make at least an equally impressive film.  Well, if you've been privileged to have seen `Spider-Man 2' (yes I did say `privileged') then you know that they succeeded in delivering a top-notch sequel!  Giving us sharper graphics, deeper story lines and excellent acting, `Spider-Man 2' is utterly fantastic.With the origin of Spider-Man out of the way, the second chapter has more time to explore how Peter Parker (Maguire) will deal with his new `responsibilities', including whether or not he should pursue a relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) or stay alone in order to protect the ones he loves.  His decision is almost solidified by the appearance of the evil Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina).  Once a great physicist, Otto Octavius was transformed into the monster known as Doctor Octopus after an experiment went haywire.Not only does Peter have this new atrocity to contend with, but his very best friend Harry (Franco) is bent on avenging his father's death at the hands of Spider-Man, and thus is determined to hunt him down and kill him.  When the very lives of his love ones are put in jepordy because of his newfound powers Peter is troubled with where to turn, and what to do.  Should he continue to fight the crime plaguing the streets or should he hang it up for good to protect those around him?`Spider-Man 2' serves as top-notch entertainment, ready and willing to please any who watch it.  I really don't see a down side, and with `Spider-Man 3' on the horizon there is sure to be plenty more to praise and look forward to as another chapter is unfolded.

It has action, suspense, romance, drama, and isn't too complicated for the younger audiences. Kids will wow it, adults will be amazed by it.One way that the film is better than the first is through the internalization that Peter Parker must face. He is Spiderman, and he is Peter Parker at the same time. As we learned in the first installation, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' Parker is forced to take this to heart - trying to maintain the delicate balance between Spiderman, being a student, having a job, and making time for friends and family. Not many people would normally think that a being a superhero could be such a strain. The psychological aspect of the film is worth five stars alone.The fight scenes are also stunning. There is more feeling in these scenes, especially as Spiderman's identity is unveiled to the world (on the train). The villains are made eviler, as we know that they truly cannot help themselves. The forces working against Spiderman seem more benign, as Parker seems unable to stop them through his Spidey-ways, but still are pain inflicting.'Spiderman 2' is a sublime movie also because it gives us the power to choose.

621093,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005JMQW,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[1, 2]","I have a confession to make: I hated the first Spider-Man.I despised it, loathed it all the more for having anticipated it so much. For a big-budget superhero flick I thought it looked astonishly cheap; it was poisonously saccharine-sweet, and the spectacle of the two masked super-adversaries---Green Goblin and Spider-Man---taunting each other without being able to see their mouths---was ridiculous.So I came into Spider-Man 2 with a mix of dread and boredom.Faced!I can report that Spider-Man 2 is not only a deleriously enjoyable film in its own right, but it is that rarest of sequels: the sequel that makes its predecessor better by virtue of its sheer existence.The best thing about this Spidery successor is it feels shot like a horror flick: this is, after all, Sam Raimi, the abrasive, hyperkinetic, revolutionary young director who had conjured up the unabashedly gory and improbably funny ""Evil Dead"" movies. Spider-Man 2 succeeds in large part because of the camera-work, which delivers because it mimics the movements of the hero and villain , whether we're webbing through the Manhattan canyons with Spidey or lumbering up the side of a skyscraper with the brilliantly evil---albeit enslaved---Doctor ""Octopus"" (played to fleshy perfection by the underrated Al Molina).Tobey McGuire has toned it down in this installment: he's more relaxed, more comfortable with the role even as his stymied superhero is becoming less comfortable with his powers. James Franco (Osborn Jr.) flexes some acting chops with his parsed, but critical role; Kirsten Dunst is amiably bland, as always; and of the wildly overracting JK Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) the less said, the better.But the real jewel in Spidey's crown is its villain: Spider-Man has found a worthy foe, and the flick its lodestone, in the tormented and complicated Dr. Octavius, played to perfection by Molina. Molina gives this second outting its gravity, tragedy, and (no pun intended) heft---props as well to the FX crew on the tentacles, each of which bristle with menace.And that's another place where Spider-Man 2 shines: its judicious, effective use of CGI. For a blockbuster, SM2 made use of many traditional effects, eschewing CGI unless the scene was literally impossible to creature with stunts, sets, and props. That realism gives the film a gritty heft, a raw physicality, missing from other CGI-larded blockbusters, and it redounds to Raimi's credit.One slight complaint and a general note to Hollywood: stop killing off a supervillains every single flick---these guys are good for at least another picture, especially Doc Ock! Besides, a lower supervillain bodycount means less money spent on brainstorming new sequel stuff, and surely that can't be bad for business.JSG",5,Arachnophilia!,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,2750,"['have', 'confession', 'make', 'hated', 'first', 'Spider-Man.I', 'despised', 'loathed', 'more', 'having', 'anticipated', 'so', 'much', 'big-budget', 'superhero', 'flick', 'thought', 'looked', 'astonishly', 'cheap', 'was', 'poisonously', 'saccharine-sweet', 'spectacle', 'two', 'masked', 'super-adversaries', '-Green', 'Goblin', 'Spider-Man', '-taunting', 'other', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'mouths', '-was', 'ridiculous.So', 'came', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'mix', 'dread', 'boredom.Faced', 'can', 'report', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'not', 'only', 'deleriously', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'rarest', 'sequels', 'sequel', 'predecessor', 'better', 'virtue', 'sheer', 'existence.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Spidery', 'successor', 'feels', 'shot', 'horror', 'flick', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'abrasive', 'hyperkinetic', 'revolutionary', 'young', 'director', 'who', 'had', 'conjured', 'up', 'unabashedly', 'gory', 'improbably', 'funny', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'large', 'part', 'camera-work', 'movements', 'hero', 'villain', ""'re"", 'webbing', 'Manhattan', 'canyons', 'Spidey', 'lumbering', 'up', 'side', 'skyscraper', 'brilliantly', 'evil', '-albeit', 'enslaved', '-Doctor', 'Octopus', 'played', 'fleshy', 'perfection', 'underrated', 'Al', 'Molina', '.Tobey', 'McGuire', 'toned', 'down', 'installment', 'more', 'relaxed', 'more', 'comfortable', 'role', 'even', 'stymied', 'superhero', 'becoming', 'less', 'comfortable', 'powers', 'James', 'Franco', 'Osborn', 'Jr.', 'flexes', 'acting', 'chops', 'parsed', 'critical', 'role', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'amiably', 'bland', 'always', 'wildly', 'overracting', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'less', 'said', 'better.But', 'real', 'jewel', 'Spidey', 'crown', 'villain', 'Spider-Man', 'found', 'worthy', 'foe', 'flick', 'lodestone', 'tormented', 'complicated', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'played', 'perfection', 'Molina', 'Molina', 'second', 'outting', 'gravity', 'tragedy', 'pun', 'intended', 'heft', 'as', 'well', 'FX', 'crew', 'tentacles', 'bristle', 'menace.And', 'place', 'where', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'shines', 'judicious', 'effective', 'use', 'CGI', 'blockbuster', 'SM2', 'made', 'use', 'many', 'traditional', 'effects', 'eschewing', 'CGI', 'scene', 'was', 'literally', 'impossible', 'creature', 'stunts', 'sets', 'props', 'realism', 'film', 'gritty', 'heft', 'raw', 'physicality', 'missing', 'other', 'CGI-larded', 'blockbusters', 'Raimi', 'credit.One', 'slight', 'complaint', 'general', 'note', 'Hollywood', 'stop', 'killing', 'off', 'supervillains', 'single', 'flick', '-these', 'guys', 'are', 'good', 'least', 'picture', 'especially', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Besides', 'lower', 'supervillain', 'bodycount', 'less', 'money', 'spent', 'brainstorming', 'new', 'sequel', 'stuff', 'surely', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'business.JSG']",Spider-Man 2

Anyways, I saw a trailer for Spider Man 2 before it came on and judging from what I saw, this will be hands down the greatest movie of the summer and I think it will shoot up to the money mark the first one made perhaps even more so. The original key players return excluding the dead ones (i.e. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin) with a few new ones like Alfred Molina's Dr. Otto Octavius or better known to comic book fans as Doc Ock. Like the first, it will sport good CGI battle sequences and pyrotechnics. But I hope that Molina can pull his character off. He looked like a good candidate for Ock in the trailer, but it's like the lesson I learned last summer. Hulk had a great trailer that made me green with anticipation but when I saw it, it was one of the worst superhero films of all time. It ranked with Batman and Robin and I have an undying hatred for that crapfest. But I hope that Spidey 2 can pull the  tricks that made the original so good.

621095,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JMQW,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[6, 6]","I went into this movie with low expectations. Two years earlier I had sat through every disappointing moment of the original movie full of all that missed opportunities and blah blah line deliveries.So, switch to 2004 and my date and I stood outside a movie theater in Reston, Va. pondering our choices. There was DODGEBALL all sold out (to my silent relief since my date was the only one who had expressed an interest in the screwball comedy). Somehow we ended up putting down our cash (or at least mine) for the second Spiderman and I entered the theater and braced myself for what might come.Lo and behold two hours or so later I left the theater energized and excited about the emerging franchise. The simple fact was that this second installment was far better than the first. Not saddled with having to explain Spidey's abilities and his coming to terms with his powers. This follow-up was able to focus on the action and adventure without losing focus on what for me was the best part of the picture - the relationship between Mary Jane (played by the seemingly omnipresent Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker. It was an interesting parting shot that tied up that storyline nicely (at least until the next movie).Another element that separated this movie from its predecessor was Alfred Molina as the main villain. A truly sympathetic character he was not the evil meglomaniacal villain that so often inhabit the superhero canon, but a good man trapped and manipulated by his own invention.One element I really liked was the unmasking of Spiderman (you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean) and this element should lead to some interesting developments in the third movie.Fans should beware that director Sam Raimi is reportedly working on a directors cut for this movie with extra and extended scenes that Columbia TriStar is apparently willing to finance (new spfx etc).

Still haunted by the memory of his uncle Ben, he knows that it's his destiny to help those who are in trouble.  Once again, Aunt May and Mary Jane are under the gun, and he has to save them from the sadistic villain.Yet he has someone else to rescue, a man whose troubles are as relentless as the mentor-turned-monster of Dr. Octavius, and that person in distress is Peter himself.  For over two hours, we're brought into the life of this young man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders.  And by the time the closing credits roll, we realize that we've been given something special.Spider-Man 2 has no catchy subtitle, and could have easily been a remake of the first.  Yet Sam Raimi did something that few seem capable of:  he continued the story.  Cameron did it with Aliens and Terminator 2.  Irvin Kirshner did it with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  And like those other sequels, Spider-Man is not only a continuation of the ""original"" in their franchise, it's far superior.It superior for many reasons: It boasts a tighter script, cleaner directing, better effects, richer acting, and even has a villain without a plastic halloween mask.  And finally, it has a resolution to Peter's hidden struggle, his love for Mary Jane.  I walked out of the theatre feeling like I took something with me.

Really, this is the best movie of 2004 and if the Academy had any sense, it would be a Best Picture nominee. Unfortunately, it is too popular a movie to win awards. However, the character development is the major piece of the plot and the action just enhances it.Peter Parker struggles with being a regular person and a superhero. His life is in shambles and his sometime employer, J. Jonah Jameson, continues to portray Spider-Man as evil. In order to make ends meet, Peter must help him do this despite the fact Peter is Spider-Man. His personal life is in the dumper too - MJ's marrying someone else, Aunt Mae is being foreclosed on, he can't pay the rent. However, the public loves and needs Spidey.Watching Peter struggle with all of this, lose his confidence, give up Spider-Man and try and be normal shows how great a performance Tobey Maguire puts on. Critics loved the movie, moviegoers thronged to it, now the Academy should give it and its actors the awards it deserves.The twists and turns of this movie lead to many surprises and revelations.

621106,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JMQW,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[8, 9]","With &quot;Spiderman 2&quot;, Director Sam Raimi delivers that rarest of beasts: an action/adventure movie with real emotional depth. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself at odds with his super hero powers. His crime-fighting duties have left him penniless, red-eyed with exhaustion, and in danger of flunking out of college. What's more, his long-time love, MJ (Kirsten Dunst) is on the brink of cutting him out of her life. Although he can save children from careening cars, he can't help Aunt May stop the foreclosure on her house. So what's a superhero to do? Even the villain - brilliant scientist Dr. Octavius turned Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) - is conflicted as his mechanical arms transport him into a life of crime. However, these emotional complications do not wreck the flow of the action; the fight and chase sequences are high-paced, sometimes even too tumultuous to take it all in, and they ratchet up the tension scene by scene. The humorous and ironic moments serve as yet another layer of texture.From the stunning graphic art sequence of the opening credits to the final scene, &quot;Spiderman 2&quot; is a visually impressive film, even more so than the first. In this sequel, everything seems to come together, from the comic book feel to the Hollywood special effects to the acting to the screenplay itself. Although the person accompanying me complained that the film had &quot;too much talking&quot;, I felt the balance between action and character development was perfect.If you liked the first &quot;Spiderman&quot;, you'll like this one even more.

Tobey Maguire reprises his role as the web-slinging vigilante who wages with his identity and the life he wishes to lead. A crippled romance with sweetheart MJ Watson (Kristen Dunst), falling grades and late rents forces him to review his options. Peter Parker ends up as a disappointment to himself, MJ, his aunt May (Rosalind Harris) and even to his best pal Harry (James Franco) who is disillusioned by his personal vendetta with Spiderman. The brilliance of the sequel is further elevated by the tight casting of Alfred Molina as the tragic villain Dr. Octopus who turned mad after a lab accident destroyed his life's work. The action remains galvanizing esepcially in the cliff-hanging train chase sequence and the paranomic swings and pans across the city. SpiderMan 2 returns in its comic pulp fantasy glory and is even more focused in its portrayal of the superhero with his frailities and dilemma and reconciling with the fact that with great power comes great responsibility.

I like the fact however that for once the makers of a movie didn't rely HEAVILY on Special Efx, ie &quot;CGI&quot; to make the movie interesting like all these supposed summer blockbusters that Bombed this year so far. It was great that they delved more into Peter Parkers every day life, how he thinks, what his aspirations are, his fears, his love for MJ...but they dragged it a bit longer than necessary to the point that we want to say &quot;Alright already!&quot;It was funny at first seing Peter Parker get dumped on by everybody in his life:1.Jamison Firing and hiring him in less than 5 seconds2.getting fired from the Pizza spot3.hiding out from his landlord for not paying his rent4.College Professor telling him to basically shape up or ship out5.MJ getting engaged to another man6.and most of all getting &quot;bitch slapped&quot; in front of everyone by his supposed best friend Harry Osbourne.I thought to myself &quot;god he's just having a real BAD week to say the least!&quot; then it wasn't funny anymore because you thought how much can this guy be in &quot;loser-ville&quot;. Is there anything else in this movie that he can at least get good credit for doing when he's NOT Spiderman? Granted Peter Parker is a nerd but geez, give him a break! Even Clark Kent from Smallville doesn't get dumped on like this...and he too is going through the SAME EXACT things..but that's a different story...When there WAS action in the movie it was awesome. Excellent special efx and State of the art CGI efx. Fighting on the side of a skyscaper was exciting to watch.As far as Doctor Octopus he was missing in Action for alot of the movie, as a villain his character wasn't developed enough...in some cases at all. His goal was to continue his experiment to.......????. You never saw what he was developing after the malfunction changed him nor found out what he meant to do with this experiment once succeeded, after all; what good is a scientific breakthrough if it has no real meaning to anyone? Why Rob a bank to get funding when you know everyone knows it's you that did it? I mean if you rob a bank who really wants to discuss or do business with you afterwards??With his new great strength and powers he didn't really put it to much advantage.He wasn't &quot;testing it out&quot; on any crimes or innocent people like the average villain.At times I forgot about his character and got caught up reluctantly into the &quot;soap opera&quot; of Parker's life. &quot;Doc Ock&quot; was really likable even when he turned bad...you kind of felt sorry for him.A few other underdeveloped characters were MJs fiance'...what was that about?What happened to the landlords daughter? She liked Peter but nothing happened...at all.I don't think it was a good idea to make Spiderman reveal who he was to damn near every other person:1.His doctor (that &quot;I have a friend who dreams he's spiderman....&quot; ) we all know that when someone says that it's really THEM...the doctor would be stupid not to pick that up.2.The people on the train (in New York money is to be made..people would be using there cell cams and cameras to take pictures of who Spiderman is and sell it to the Enquirer and Daily news) what was the purpose of him taking it off in the first place??Because he couldn't breathe with it on or see with it on?? He's been through worse situations and he never took it off under any circumstances.3.Revealing to MJ (this was too quick)Who is the one mending Spiderman's torn outfits???Peter PArker sews??The movie once again was good but broke no new ground.

It was worth the wait and left a great deal to be desired. So how was it that they were going to follow up on a really good original especially amidst the improvement that X2 did upon ""X-Men"". Well my verdict on this is that ""Spider Man 2"" is a grand improvement over the first one, is light years better, and greatly expands Spider Man's character in the movie series and the result is without a doubt one of the greatest sequels that I've ever seen! ""Spider Man 2"" is the number one movie of 2004 and is a highly recommended DVD! Be mindful that this review may contain some spoilers to this movie but I'll do my best to minimize them.Two years after the fiasco with Norman Osborn, Peter Parker starts to enter into uncharted territory in his life. Amidst the changes he's going through, things gradually deteriorate as his personal and professional life begins to come apart at the seams. Still devastated by the murder of his uncle Ben, His long time juggling of his superhero duty and his normal civilian life begin to take a massive toll on his well-being. He first loses his job as a pizza parlor when he fails to deliver the pizzas to his assigned destination and his boss fires him after repeatedly reprimanding him. He is a brilliant student at school but despite his brilliant mind, his grades rapidly deteriorate to the point that he's beginning to fail his classes. Even his teacher Doctor Connor is giving him failing grades. His peers start looking down on him due to the odd and sometimes unpleasant changes in his behavior and even Mary Jane Parker, his love of his life, parts ways with him due to his failing to meet her at the right time or the right place. Even worse is when his Spider-Man superpowers are starting to fail on him and it's believed to be the result of immense physical and emotional burnout. Literally, his life is now falling apart to the point that he finally throws the costume in the garbage and decides to leave the superhero business behind and just live a normal civilian life.But on a whole other note, Peter Parker is invited to visit a brilliant scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius, a world-renowned scientist who Parker idolizes. During a special demonstration at a laboratory, Octavius heads a promising project that utilizes a stable form of fusion power. The new project involves a state of the art nanotechnology that involves a set of mechanical arms that are designed to work in the fusion reactor machine where an unprotected human hand could not enter without being incinerated by the intense heat and radiation. However the experiment goes horribly wrong (don't they always?) when the fusion reaction goes out of control, starts pulling unsecured metal objects in to the fusion reaction to sustain itself, and the prominence-like flares engulfs his mechanical arms, electrocute him, and fuses the nanowires into his entire nervous system. The resulting accident literally destroys his ambition, severely deforms Octavius, as well as claims the life of his beloved wife Rosie Octavius.After the accident at the lab, Peter Parker, who finally has had enough of the demands of crime-fighting throws in the tower and decides to pursue his quest for a better life. Since putting the superhero business to rest, his life literally improves almost overnight. His grades begin to rapidly improve, and Peter is on his way to rebuilding his self-esteem. He even begins to win back Mary Jane's affection as well despite the fiasco from earlier in the film. He seems to have finally gotten firm ground in his life...or so it seems.Driven mad by the loss of his wife as well as the destruction of his fusion power dreams, Otto Octavius who is now a deranged shell of his former self flees to a foul decrepit abandoned warehouse in the Hudson river and with the manipulation of the robotic arms fused to his body, he decides to rebuild the fusion reactor that he designed only to make it much bigger than the old one and will do whatever it takes to do it, even if it endangers the lives of millions nearby. Dock Ock as he is now called, kidnaps Mary Jane and takes her to the foul abandoned warehouse by the Hudson River and holds her hostage there while he restarts the fusion power project that he seeks to complete and achieve his goals by any means necessary.Now with Mary Jane in peril, Harry Osborn wanting Spider-Man dead for the death of his father Norman, and the prospect of a much larger catastrophe than what happened at the lab, Peter Parker is faced with an excruciating dilemma of if he should continue to live normally or don the suit again in order to save New York City. His choices whichever one he makes till take agonizing effort to live through.This sequel to the first ""Spider Man"" movie completely took my world by storm even with sky high expectations. Almost everything about this movie is nothing short of brilliant. The major action fighting sequences between Spidey and Dock Ock are among the greatest battle scenes that I've seen in years. The major conflict between all of the characters is very intense be it Peter's conversation with Aunt May, his conflict between his choices as well as Otto Octavius' descent into madness.What especially carries this wonderful movie are the characters as well as the special effects. The special effects are really breathtaking and awesome. Pretty much everything that is more than 30 feet away are almost all CGI effects and they are highly realistic. The movie also expands the characters immensely. My favorite one was delving far deeper into Peter Parker's past. As I said in the review for the first Spider Man film, Toby Maguire was absolutely perfect for the role of the former geek student Peter Parker transformed into a superhero. The way they fleshed out his character is nothing short of phenomenal. Kristen Dunst as Peter's love Mary Jane is also better than in the last adventure and the tension between is almost revolutionary. Even Aunt May (who's at least in her 70s or 80s) brings some eye-opening surprises and some emotional moments are brought forth. Of course there's also the pompous flare-tempered J. Jonah Jameson of the Bugle newspaper.However the number one effects shared by two things are what especially buoy this movie upwards above its Marvel Comics peers. The first one is the arch nemesis Doctor Octopus/Dock Ock/Otto Octavius. Dock Ock is one of my favorite super villains in the comic series and that he would be the villain in this movie thrilled me very much. Even better was the actor who was selected to play him named Alfred Molina. Those who are old enough may remember him as Indiana Jones' former friend later traitor that met his end in the beginning of ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"". Well Molina is absolutely amazing and unbelievably perfect for the role of playing a brilliant benevolent scientist later twisted by grief and rage into a deranged shell of his former self. The way he acted in his role is nothing short of a future legend. Dock Ock in this case is perhaps the class of super villains that one could almost feel sorry for. The other thing that I also enjoyed was the fusion machine itself. Perhaps I'm just a mad science nerd but the whole concept of fusion is fascinating and one of my favorite science subjects. The way they showed Octavius' fusion reaction looking like a miniature version of the Sun while grossly inaccurate was really cool and how they showed the scenes of when it went out of control were well filmed and generated. In real life though a fusion reaction like that would be unimaginably bright, and would kill any unprotected human who was standing near it. This movie is perhaps the subject of many debates over this but I'm willing to brush aside real laws of physics in this one. I just can't get enough of the fusion device and the action that results from it's activation and the metal that is pulled into the fusion itself. Real fusion machines are likely much different from the one in the movie. The only major thing that I didn't get which I won't count as a flaw was why did they conduct an experiment in an unshielded apartment building in the middle of a crowded neighborhood? That's the only questionable thing I had about this movie.The DVD itself leaves a lot to be desired but I enjoy watching the part where they built the minature sets as well as filming the many action sequences, as well as the story behind the movies making. I still wonder why there isn't a more detailed look into how they made the fusion power machine and generating the sun-like fusion reaction itself.Overall, this movie is just a few yards short of being perfect! I have never seen a comic book movie work so well on improving on the greatness of it's predecessor. It is brilliant, it is highly emotional and nothing short of stunning and breathtaking! With everything I said about it, I would go far as to say that it does a greater job of improving on the first movie than ""X-Men United"" did on improving on 2000's ""X-Men"" movie. To put it this way, this is perhaps my favorite sequel of any sorts since 1986's ""Aliens"" which also improved on its scary 1979 predecessor ""Alien"".I strongly recommend that you get this movie as soon as possible. Believe me, there isn't any comic movie that took my world by storm like ""Spider Man 2"" did. If there is a true ""Amazing Spider Man"" movie, this is it! I guarantee it.",5,A TRUE MASTERPIECE!

It shows Peter Parker trying to jugle being a superhero, trying to make a living, and being there for loved ones all at once. It doesn't work out, as saving lives is top priority and he can't tell anyone about his secret for reasons of safety and love.

621114,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B00005JMQW,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[1, 1]","'Spider-Man 2' continues the story of Peter Parker, a young man that has been gifted, and cursed, by having been bit by a genetically altered spider.  The spider bite infected Parker with magnificent powers, and at the same time, made Peter make a difficult choice on how to best use those powers.  In the first movie, the audience watched as Peter gained his powers, accepted his responsibility, and made tough choices on how to run his life.In the sequel, Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, still hasn't learned how to make his life as Peter Parker the student, photographer, and nephew coexist with his life as Spider-Man the super hero.  While he excels at being Spider-Man, he doesn't do such a good job being Peter.  He has fallen behind in paying his rent, has lost contact with his best friend, the millionaire Harry Osborn (who is convinced Spider-Man killed his father), if failing in college despite being exceptionally smart, and has put a relationship with the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (played by Kirsten Dunst) on hold.To make matters worse, a new super villain has emerged.  Much like the Green Goblin from the original 'Spider-Man,' Doctor Octupus gains his abilities through an accident while pursuing an otherwise admirable goal.  Doc Ock, played by Alfred Molina, in some respects, is a very sympathetic villain.  In addition, Spider-Man finds that his powers are frequently failing him.  So, he makes a choice:  whether or not to be Spider-Man any longer....This movie is an exceptional story.  Like its predecessor, it remains true to the spirit of the comics thanks to the direction of Sam Rami.  I did not care for the angle of Spider-Man losing his powers because of self doubt and discomfort with his role in life as it was never an angle explored in the comic, but it was a great plot device to explore the dual life of Peter Parker.Some of the actors were better than others.  Personally, I really like Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker.  Kirsten Dunst does a fine job acting, but just doesn't strike me as the knock out that Mary Jane was portrayed as in the comics.  I'm not sure who I would have replaced her with.  Alfred Molina was a truly excellent choice for Dr. Octupus.  His performance as the brilliant scientist and loving husband turned eight limbed super villain is first rate.  However, perhaps the best performance is that of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the Editor of the Paper that Parker sells pictures of Spider-Man to.  The role could not have been cast better and Simons has JJ down to a T.The action scenes were first rate.  The battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock easily eclipsed those between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin.  Raimi and the writers of the film developed some truly creative ways for both the hero and the villain to employ their powers.  The FX department did a wonderful job bringing the action to life and making Doc Ock move as one would expect.In addition to the plot line of Spider-Man fumbling with his powers, my other gripe is how Spider-Man's identity was handled.  Quite a few people seem to know who Spider-Man is now.  Parker's alter ego was always a closely guarded secret in the comics, and it just seems to be discarded too carelessly in the films.I highly recommend this film.  Spider-Man and comic book fans will enjoy it for its true to spirit adaptation of the comic (although not 100% faithful to the comic book).  Next to 'X-Men 2,' it is one of the best translations ever.  Action fans are in for a treat as well.  Besides the violence, parents don't need to be overly concerned about what their children are seeing as there is no sex and hardly any language.  The movie excellently blends action, story, character development, and humor.  DVD enthusiats will be thrilled with the generous amount of extras.  I highly recommend this film.",5,True to Spirit,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,3842,"[""'Spider-Man"", '2', 'story', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'young', 'man', 'been', 'gifted', 'cursed', 'having', 'been', 'bit', 'genetically', 'altered', 'spider', 'spider', 'bite', 'infected', 'Parker', 'magnificent', 'powers', 'same', 'time', 'made', 'Peter', 'make', 'difficult', 'choice', 'how', 'best', 'use', 'powers', 'first', 'movie', 'audience', 'watched', 'Peter', 'gained', 'powers', 'accepted', 'responsibility', 'made', 'tough', 'choices', 'how', 'run', 'life.In', 'sequel', 'Parker', 'played', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'still', ""n't"", 'learned', 'how', 'make', 'life', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'student', 'photographer', 'nephew', 'coexist', 'life', 'Spider-Man', 'super', 'hero', 'being', 'Spider-Man', ""n't"", 'do', 'such', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'Peter', 'fallen', 'paying', 'rent', 'lost', 'contact', 'best', 'friend', 'millionaire', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'who', 'convinced', 'Spider-Man', 'killed', 'father', 'failing', 'college', 'being', 'exceptionally', 'smart', 'put', 'relationship', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'hold.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'new', 'super', 'villain', 'emerged', 'Much', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'original', ""'Spider-Man"", 'Doctor', 'Octupus', 'gains', 'abilities', 'accident', 'pursuing', 'otherwise', 'admirable', 'goal', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'respects', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'addition', 'Spider-Man', 'powers', 'are', 'frequently', 'failing', 'So', 'choice', 'not', 'be', 'Spider-Man', 'longer', '.This', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'story', 'predecessor', 'true', 'spirit', 'comics', 'thanks', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Rami', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'angle', 'Spider-Man', 'losing', 'powers', 'self', 'doubt', 'discomfort', 'role', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'angle', 'explored', 'comic', 'was', 'great', 'plot', 'device', 'explore', 'dual', 'life', 'Peter', 'Parker.Some', 'actors', 'were', 'better', 'others', 'Personally', 'really', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'just', ""n't"", 'strike', 'knock', 'out', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'was', 'portrayed', 'comics', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'replaced', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'was', 'truly', 'excellent', 'choice', 'Dr.', 'Octupus', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'loving', 'husband', 'turned', 'eight', 'limbed', 'super', 'villain', 'first', 'rate', 'However', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'Editor', 'Paper', 'Parker', 'pictures', 'Spider-Man', 'role', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'better', 'Simons', 'JJ', 'down', 'T.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'battles', 'Spider-Man', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'easily', 'eclipsed', 'Spider-Man', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Raimi', 'writers', 'film', 'developed', 'truly', 'creative', 'ways', 'hero', 'villain', 'employ', 'powers', 'FX', 'department', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'action', 'life', 'making', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'move', 'one', 'would', 'expect.In', 'addition', 'plot', 'line', 'Spider-Man', 'fumbling', 'powers', 'other', 'gripe', 'how', 'Spider-Man', 'identity', 'was', 'handled', 'few', 'people', 'seem', 'know', 'who', 'Spider-Man', 'now', 'Parker', 'alter', 'ego', 'was', 'always', 'closely', 'guarded', 'secret', 'comics', 'just', 'be', 'discarded', 'too', 'carelessly', 'films.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Spider-Man', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'true', 'spirit', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'not', '100', '%', 'faithful', 'comic', 'book', 'Next', 'X-Men', '2', 'one', 'best', 'translations', 'ever', 'Action', 'fans', 'are', 'treat', 'as', 'well', 'violence', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'overly', 'concerned', 'what', 'children', 'are', 'seeing', 'sex', 'hardly', 'language', 'movie', 'excellently', 'action', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'humor', 'DVD', 'enthusiats', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'generous', 'amount', 'extras', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",Spider-Man 2

The dialogue in the first half of the movie is sharp and witty and fun.  There is even a scene where a street-urchin violinist stops what she is playing and plucks the Spider-Man cartoon theme song from yesteryear as the new Spider-Man walks by.  But by the time Bruce Campbell's now gratuitous cameo appears the script takes a left turn and becomes way too serious.  In fact, I don't ever need to hear all the reasons why Spider-Man and Mary Jane can't be together ever again.  I heard them all in the first film and I heard it three times in this second film.  Enough!  The second half of the movie tries to make up for all its unnecessary dialogue by incorporating a couple of good action scenes and special effects that range from good to mediocre.  It is frequently all too obvious that this Spider-Man is a CGI creation.  As an avid movie-fiend I want to suspend my disbelief, and I am more than willing to let a few discrepencies slide if the story remains interesting.  But ""Spider-Man 2"" has way too many flat spots, particularly in the second half of the film, to make it an engrossing experience.  There is even a grotesquely deliberate set-up for a part 3 in the not-too-distant future.  The fact that by the time I wrote this review, 185 merchants were trying to unload this DVD on the public should say something about the low replay value of this film.  Anything over 100 merchants is grounds for suspicion.

621117,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JMQW,D. Mok,"[4, 7]","I truly fail to understand why people consider this the best superhero movie ever made.  I loved the first Spider-Man film, and after seeing the trailer for Spider-Man 2, I had nothing but high hopes.  After watching it, though, I feel that while this sequel has its heart (and many other pieces) in the right place, I didn't see very much that wasn't done, and done better, in the first film.Several things did improve:  James Franco's performance in the first Spider-Man was so self-conscious that it was almost puerile, but in the sequel he appears at home, as if suddenly freed of the weight of all those James Dean comparisons.  And Alfred Molina gives a beautiful acting turn as Dr. Octopus -- while Willem Dafoe was amusing as the Green Goblin in the first film, Molina's refusal to ham up Doc Ock made him immensely likeable from the get-go.  And Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane character is allowed to have more facets than just sweet and placating this time -- no embarrassing ""Is that an angel?"" speech this time.But the elements which made the critics go ga-ga over this sequel are really not as developed as I would've liked them to be.  The idea that Spider-Man should abandon his calling is not a new one -- every superhero story I've seen, from the X-Men to Batman, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Tru Calling, from Dragonball Z to Saint Seiya -- has mined this concept.  And Spider-Man 2 doesn't cut deep enough into Peter Parker's frustrations with his powers.  Many of his ""I'm giving up"" scenes are repetitive -- when his spider powers fail, we get two almost identical scenes where no webbing shoots out of his wrist and he falls.  Amusing, but doesn't help move the through-line forward.  Peter's conversations with Aunt May are the most obvious Hollywood spill-your-guts exposition scenes, one-dimensional, tired and uninteresting.  Most grievously, Peter's relationship with Mary Jane goes around in circles, never progressing.  After already having given her up in the first film to pursue his calling, Peter's dilly-dallying with Mary Jane is painfully tiresome.  An emotional cat-and-mouse with the two character could have been involving and dramatically important.  Peter always falls back on a loop of ""I want you, I want you not"", and by the time the ending finally rolls along, I wanted Mary Jane to just marry the other guy and get it over with.  And the second act of this film drags horribly, with Doc Ock's progress on his (not-so) nefarious plan coming to a standstill while we segue off into Peter's personal life.  The first film did a far better job at advancing the emotional plot and the supervillain plot simultaneously.  The running times of the two films are not too far apart, but the first film felt much more compact.  There were actually a couple of small spots in Spider-Man 2 where I felt bored and almost apathetic -- which I didn't even come close to feeling on the first Spider-Man.Does this mean Spider-Man 2 is a failure?  No, because while I thought the emotional layers weren't probed deeply enough, the action-adventure elements still work great.  Spider-Man's fight with Doc Ock on top of a clock tower is spectacular, the finale is suitably engaging and action-packed, and the centerpiece of the movie -- where Spider-Man has to stop an elevated subway train from sailing off the edge -- is a real adrenalin pumper, with an unexpectedly moving end to the scene.  This was much more what I'd expected out of the rest of the film, where one element of the original Spider-Man film (the New York camaraderie) was expounded on, improved, and made more resonant.  Just this scene alone is worth the four stars I give to this film.The outlook is good for the next Spider-Man film -- as long as they don't commit a 'Batman and-Robin'-sized blunder.  If they can complicate the issues Peter Parker and Mary Jane face and take some more risks with the relationship, then it probably *will* be one of the best superhero films of all time.  I'm also hoping the next sequel would enlist a villain as richly complex as, say, Venom.",4,"Overrated, though still good.",1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,4074,"['truly', 'fail', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'consider', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'loved', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'had', 'nothing', 'high', 'hopes', 'watching', 'feel', 'sequel', 'heart', 'many', 'other', 'pieces', 'right', 'place', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'done', 'better', 'first', 'film.Several', 'things', 'did', 'improve', 'James', 'Franco', 'performance', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'so', 'self-conscious', 'was', 'almost', 'puerile', 'sequel', 'home', 'suddenly', 'freed', 'weight', 'James', 'Dean', 'comparisons', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'turn', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'was', 'amusing', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'first', 'film', 'Molina', 'refusal', 'ham', 'up', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'made', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'get-go', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'character', 'allowed', 'have', 'more', 'facets', 'just', 'sweet', 'placating', 'time', 'embarrassing', 'angel', 'speech', 'elements', 'made', 'critics', 'go', 'ga-ga', 'sequel', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'as', 'developed', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'be', 'idea', 'Spider-Man', 'should', 'abandon', 'calling', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'superhero', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'X-Men', 'Batman', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'Saint', 'Seiya', 'mined', 'concept', 'Spider-Man', '2', ""n't"", 'cut', 'deep', 'enough', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'frustrations', 'powers', 'Many', ""'m"", 'giving', 'up', 'scenes', 'are', 'repetitive', 'when', 'spider', 'powers', 'fail', 'get', 'two', 'almost', 'identical', 'scenes', 'where', 'webbing', 'shoots', 'wrist', 'Amusing', ""n't"", 'help', 'move', 'through-line', 'forward', 'Peter', 'conversations', 'Aunt', 'May', 'are', 'most', 'obvious', 'Hollywood', 'spill-your-guts', 'exposition', 'scenes', 'one-dimensional', 'tired', 'uninteresting', 'Most', 'grievously', 'Peter', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'around', 'circles', 'never', 'progressing', 'already', 'having', 'given', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'pursue', 'calling', 'Peter', 'dilly-dallying', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'painfully', 'tiresome', 'emotional', 'cat-and-mouse', 'two', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'involving', 'dramatically', 'important', 'Peter', 'always', 'back', 'loop', 'want', 'want', 'not', 'time', 'ending', 'finally', 'rolls', 'wanted', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'just', 'marry', 'other', 'guy', 'get', 'over', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'horribly', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'progress', 'not-so', 'nefarious', 'plan', 'coming', 'standstill', 'segue', 'off', 'Peter', 'personal', 'life', 'first', 'film', 'did', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'advancing', 'emotional', 'plot', 'supervillain', 'plot', 'simultaneously', 'running', 'times', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'apart', 'first', 'film', 'felt', 'much', 'more', 'compact', 'were', 'actually', 'couple', 'small', 'spots', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'where', 'felt', 'bored', 'almost', 'apathetic', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'feeling', 'first', 'Spider-Man.Does', 'mean', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'failure', 'No', 'thought', 'emotional', 'layers', 'were', ""n't"", 'probed', 'deeply', 'enough', 'action-adventure', 'elements', 'still', 'work', 'great', 'Spider-Man', 'fight', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'top', 'clock', 'tower', 'spectacular', 'finale', 'suitably', 'engaging', 'action-packed', 'centerpiece', 'movie', 'where', 'Spider-Man', 'stop', 'elevated', 'subway', 'train', 'sailing', 'off', 'edge', 'real', 'adrenalin', 'pumper', 'unexpectedly', 'moving', 'end', 'scene', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'what', ""'d"", 'expected', 'rest', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'element', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'camaraderie', 'was', 'expounded', 'improved', 'made', 'more', 'resonant', 'Just', 'scene', 'alone', 'four', 'stars', 'give', 'film.The', 'outlook', 'good', 'next', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'commit', ""'Batman"", ""and-Robin'-sized"", 'blunder', 'can', 'complicate', 'issues', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'face', 'take', 'more', 'risks', 'relationship', 'then', 'probably', '*will*', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'films', 'time', ""'m"", 'also', 'hoping', 'next', 'sequel', 'would', 'enlist', 'villain', 'richly', 'complex', 'say', 'Venom']",Spider-Man 2
621118,A1OIPRC7LMNN9V,B00005JMQW,Dominic,"[2, 4]","Spiderman 2 was everything I had hoped it to be and then some. While watching it, I truely felt like I had been transported right into a comic book. They did an incredible job of keeping the essential elements of comics in the movie and portraying them right. In the movie, just like the comic, the most important character is the elusive girl. While Spiderman 2 is an action packed super hero flick, you could equally argue that it's a love story.Peter Parker once again has to deal with his desire to be with Mary Jane but unwillingness to place her in harms way. He has to balance his lifestyle of being both a normal newspaper photographer and a crimefighting superhero. These worlds often collide, and have adverse effects on Parker. He struggles to keep his identity secret and struggles to deal with demons from his past. He also struggles with the shortcomings of his costume (you'll understand when you watch it).Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Man, and Man vs. Himself. All those elements of conflict are in the movie and they keep you on the edge of your seat and biting your fingernails. Sure you know Spiderman won't die, but that doesn't mean that things will work out perfectly. Situations arise that weave a web of conflict (pun intended) between the characters and bind them together. The characters are round and dynamic and behave how you would expect normal people to behave. They get angry and sad. Dissappointed and happy. And when the pressure builds to points where they can't take things anymore, they fold.Unlike a lot of sequels, Spiderman 2 is not a standalone film. True, you could watch it without seeing the first and get the gist of things but there are a lot of tie ins to the first film (and even some hints to the third film). I loved watching how the characters have evolved in between the two films. I thought it was particularly interesting how Harry Osbourne had learned how to handle his father's company and grown into being a businessman. The film is just like a comic book in the sense that the characters are always evolving and issues from the past always have effects on the future.The action sequences were incredible. The computer generated graphics looked amazingly real. One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Doc Ock using his arms to mercilessly attack a team of doctors (the scene reminds me of the Evil Dead series). I liked how they created the conflict between Spiderman and Doc Ock. The Doc didn't want to kill Spiderman just for the hell of it, he had a good reason to battle the webslinger. And when they did fight, it was awesome. I loved seeing Spiderman struggling to handle the eight armed Doctor Ock.The movie also has several comedic moments. Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo and there are, of course, cheesy one liners. What comic book movie would be complete without those?I don't really have any big problems with this movie. Overall, I don't like Doc Ock as much as the Green Goblin, but I still think he is a great villain. I don't think the theater I saw it in had the volume turned up as high as it needed to be, but that's not a problem with the actual film. I guess the biggest problem is that I'll have to wait two to three years for the third installment. Oh well. Patience is a virtue.I could write a lot more on the movie, but I don't want to give away too much. Go out there and enjoy the movie for yourself.

I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as &#34;Doc Ock&#34; . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part.Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie.

(Harry believes Peter has entered into an arrangement with Spider-Man to take pictures of him, thus Peter must have some means of contacting the wallcrawler.) Then Ock, to get into the cafe where Peter and Mary Jane Watson are having a heart-to-heart talk, throws a car through the front window. If Peter hadn't - barely - been able to fling himself (and MJ) to the floor in time, Ock would have squished the person he needed to talk to, needed alive to take a message to Spider-Man - which makes him seem hideously incompetent. Peter was sitting right at the front window, Ock had to see him there....why nearly kill someone he needed alive by tossing a car at him? Come to think of it, how did Ock know Peter was in that particular cafe? Did he use his Octopus sense? Maybe he staked out Peter's apartment, then followed him to the cafe? But then why didn't Ock jump Peter before he reached the cafe? Why did he wait the entire time Peter and MJ were talking? The more you think about it, the less sense this entire scene makes.We're told that J. Jonah Jameson has ""turned the entire city against Spider-Man."" But every time we see the citizenry they're cheering him as he swings past, singing songs about him, treating him like a rock star.Late in the film, Peter unmasks himself while saving a train. Exhausted afterwards, his bleeding and unconscious form is carried into the train car by the passengers, from hand to hand over their heads until he's finally laid gently and reverently on the floor. The Christ-being-pulled-from-the-cross imagery is not lost on me; it's a beautiful scene. When Peter wakes and realizes, oh, 50 people have seen him without his mask, a little boy solemnly informs him, ""We won't tell nobody."" All I could think was how unlikely it was, in our media-obsessed culture, out of 50 random New Yorkers not one of them would run to the National Enquirer screaming, ""Give me a million dollars and a sketch artist, quick! I can show you what Spider-Man looks like without his mask.""As in Daredevil, the hero in this movie is unmasked entirely too often. Three times, actually. Twice Peter unmasks himself in front of others (great job maintaining the ol' secret identity there, Pete) for reasons that seem to me wholely insufficient. By the time SM2 is over, not only has an entire train car of New Yorkers seen Spidey without his mask, but Doc Ock, Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson all know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. In the case of Doc Ock that strikes me as extremely shortsighted - it's going to be a real problem if they ever want to bring back the character.And so on. Believe me, I could continue but I only have 1,000 words here.So the movie has problems. And yet....while you're watching it, they don't really matter. Spider-Man 2 is based loosely on an old Stan Lee story from the 1960s titled ""Spider-Man No More"" in which Peter Parker tosses his Spidey outfit in a trashcan and tries to have a real life. The movie works - mostly because of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. From his first second on-screen in the first movie, Maguire totally inhabited this character, he's utterly believable as the achingly decent, slightly geeky young hero with an overdeveloped sense of responsibility. I'm less enthusiastic about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson; she's a tolerable actress but somewhat miscast. James Franco as Harry Osborn is, eh, okay. On the other hand, Rosemary Harris makes a wonderful Aunt May; her speech to Peter about why the world needs heroes like Spider-Man literally had me crying. J.K. Simmons is absolutely perfect as J. Jonah Jameson; every second he's on-screen is magic. Alfred Molina, a fine actor, as Doctor Octopus looks like the comic book character come to life, and his tentacles are believable. Stunning, actually. Through a combination of expert puppeteering and CGI, these inanimate objects are almost characters in their own right. The story pulls you along with a pace that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark seem slow....which is a good thing because it gives you less time to think about its many glaring logic flaws.",4,Flawed - But

Ebert's reviews are usually completely against my thoughts of a movie, but this time we agreed 100%. This movie is fantastic.I hated the first one. Let me get that outta the way. It was an 'okay' movie, but with Sam Raimi directing, I expected *A Lot* better, and getting the mediocrity I did in watching it, it's caused me to hate it. But this movie, which I was really unsure about, ended up being Fantastic. Everything the first one should have been, this one is. It's got the emotional impact the story needs, it's got a very well cast Doc Ock, and, of course, it's got Bruce Campbell. He's only in one scene, but when he appeared, I stood up and cheered in the theater. I'm sure many of the folks out there understand.The movie isn't perfect, mind you. They should've cut a few of the endings. It seemed to end three times. Plus, if it were about 10 minutes shorter, it'd be a lot easier to watch. Some of it just seemed a bit slow. Plus, Peter Parker, as in the first film, seems to be a complete knucklehead. Maybe that's what Sam was striving for: A very bright person, but not one with a load of common sense.

That in itself was well written out and the writers did an excellent job at fleshing out the true essence of the comic book Peter Parker and bringing him out in actor Tobey McGuire however director Sam Raimi gets full credit for keeping faithful to who the characters are from the comic book pages to the big screen. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus was the best casting job. Alfred's portrayal as the brilliant physicist turned psychopath was one of the best performances I have seen from Alfred. The most chilling scene from Molina in the film was when Dr.Octopus woke up in the hospital. That entire scene in general was rather intense and brutal to say the very least. Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst were wonderful as their perspective characters but I have to say Alfred Molina was the highlight of the blockbuster smash for me. I also loved the brief cameos made by QAF's Hal Sparks, Bruce Campbell, and Sam's younger brother Ted Raimi (who played Joxer on ""Xena: Warrior Princess""). The special effects were amazing although there were moments that just screamed ""I am the cheese"" because I could easily tell that they were computer generated. It is rare to see a comic book turned into a movie that is so well written.

SPIDER-MAN left us with a feeling that Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), liked his super-powers, and enjoyed being a superhero. However, SPIDER-MAN 2 shows the dark side of possessing super-human strength. Peter Parker is finally realizing that powers can truly ruin your life. Suddenly, Peter can't hold a job, is failing in school, he can't get the girl, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and he's being labeled as a menace to society, incstead of as a crime-fighter. And now, due to his lack of concentration, Peter is losing his Spidey powers. It's not until Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) begins terrorizing the entire city, that Spidey decides to come back and save the day. And, if he's lucky, he'll get the girl as he's doing just that.I was an enormous fan of SPIDER-MAN, so it was a given that I would purchase SPIDER-MAN 2. My purchase was a wonderful one, for I was treated to a spectacular thrill-ride filled with emotional bumps on every turn. Tobey Maguire's (SPIDER-MAN and PLEASANTVILLE) acting skills in the roles of both Peter Parker and Spider-Man are fantastic, and the stunts he participates in will have everyone holding their breath; while Kirsten Dunst (SPIDER-MAN and THE VIRGIN SUICIDES) will please fans with her kind personality, and true love for Peter Parker. The roles of the supporting cast - James Franco, Alfred Molina, Rosemary Harris, and more - are enough to make SPIDER-MAN 2 just as good, as if not better than it's predecessor.

Valero ""Eterno""","[3, 4]","After being somewhat disappointed with the original ""Spider-Man"", I avoided paying the hefty $10 price tag to watch this in the theatre. After seeing this film for the third time on television, I kinda wished I would have seen this on the big screen.What makes this film better than the original is not the Hi-Tech effects and bloated story-line but the emotional struggles torturing several of the main characters, from our heroes to the villain. ""Spider-Man 2"" is more emotionally charged and the very human conflicts add a sense of realism to a technically over-the-top film.Toby Maguire's charming portrayal of Peter Parker is great here. The constant mental anguish of being unemployed; not being able to be with the woman he loves; the guilt he carries over his Uncle's death and his doomed friendship with Harry Osborne, all make his Spider-Man come across as a flawed but exceptional super-hero and not a caricature. Despite having extraordinary powers, he leads a a pretty miserable and marginal life. His physical appearance is also a stand-out. Maguire is not a tall, buffed, physically imposing individual. His demure appearance makes his Spider-Man more attainable. A simple guy who was suddenly thrust into a surreal and dangerous world of science-fiction. Kirsten Dunst is also an emotional wreck, being totally in love with Parker and not understanding as to why he refuses to be a permanent part of her life. Emotionally, the film works well because the 2 main characters are likeable enough to make us care for them and their emotional plights.Even the villain, Doc-Ock comes across as rather sympathetic during the final segment. A genius who's creation and megalomania overcame him. Despite all of the evil he caused, it was his creation that caused all the chaos.As mentioned previously, this film is considerably over-the-top and some scenes are unbelievable at best. The scene in which Parker looses his Spidey powers and falls several stories to the ground with not one bruise or broken bone is one of the examples and the subway scene is another. But hey, this is based on a comic book... What else should the viewer expect? And when all is executed so cleverly, who the heck cares?""Spider-Man 2"" towers above many in the genre. It's a thrilling tale of an all too human super-hero and a not to human villain. If a sequel is to follow, it sure has tough shoes to fill.Highly recommended.",5,Better Than The Original.

The second time around I did still enjoy the movie but it did not seem to be as good as the first.  The problems are that the movie has way too much going on.  It's a bit to over stuffed.  There are 4 endings.  Also the movie shoves way too many moments where you are supposed to say ""awww poor Peter Parker"".  It's ridiculous.  His life somehow becomes perfect right when he gives up being a superhero.  That's not very realistic.  Also the movie suffers from way too many gags.  It's all just silly humor.  I would have liked the humor to be a little better than falling down in front of a bunch of people and drinking a drink that was already finished by someone else.  There are good moments too.  For one, the special effects are great, not that I expected them to be anything otherwise.  The story is coherent, (for the most part).  The action sequences are a bit cartoon-ish at times but still solid.  There is a nifty train sequence and an even better climatic battle at the end that the first movie.  One thing that I do not like is J Jonah Jameson the chief of the Daily Bugle.  He is way over the top cartoon-ish and the paper itself is more like the National Inquirer than a reputable newspaper.

This is because he is beginning to believe that this wasn't his destiny. Was he really the one who should be looking after the city, especially when the city is still lukewarm about him? But, can Spiderman actually have the gall to turn his back on this city, especially when Doc Ock is running loose, causing havoc?Spiderman 2 really examines who Peter Parker really is. Well, a better way to say this is that Peter Parker seems to try to figure out who he is. Is he really just the geeky guy who would love a shot at romance with Mary Jane, or is he destined to be Spiderman, the mysterious hero who is there to save the city from its malevolent forces?Normally I'm not a big fan of comic book hero movies, but Spiderman 2 is about as complete of movie in its genre that has ever been made. It is an action movie, with plenty of suspenseful scenes and CGI effects, but it doesn't overdo them ad nausea to the point where it is being shoved down your throat. It is a comic book movie with heart and IQ. We see this as Peter Parker struggles with not only his friendship and family issues, but his own identity dilemma. How can he possibly balance the struggles of his real life with the struggles of being a hero? Is there a happy medium?Another plus is the cast. Toby McGuire does a superb job again (for the 2nd time) as Peter Parker. He typifies the nerdy guy who would be the last guy you'd expect to be saving the city from world domination or crime. Kirsten Dunst is also phenomenal as Mary Jane, a perfect fit for this character who wants to love Peter, but doesn't feel like she knows who he really is.There is probably a little more emphasis on Peter Parker's personal life in this film than on Spiderman fighting the city's nemesis, Doc Ock. This is good, though, because it really makes the story more real and doesn't dumb down the film to just a special effects show. Spiderman, we find out, is more human than meets the eye.In the two disc set, disc one has a section of commentary with director Sam Raimi, as well as some of the cast, and a blooper reel. Disc two has a documentary about the making of the film, along with a documentary about the history of the villain, Doc Ock.Over all, this is a sequel that is as good if not better than the first one.

Simply put, the action in this movie is usually pretty good, but it's mostly just generic romance/drama crap.  Here's the thing: I don't like Parker, or Mary Jane very much.  He's a dork.  She's a dorkette.  When it comes to their personal lives, I just don't care.  (And the musical montage. Eww.)  And it's not just that it's mostly whiny romance/drama: It's *lame* romance/drama. I spent most of the movie wondering when the hell Dr. Octopus was actually going to DO something, or anyone else, for that matter.  I liked Dr.Octopus alright.  He's kinda charming, and comes off a lot better then you'd imagine, on film.  But, he's just not around all that much.  And while the surprisingly few action sequences are usually pretty good, they faulter at times.  For example, the scene where he saves the train is stupid and convoluted.  And, it pushes believability way past the breaking point, a remarkable feat for a frickin superhero movie.  And other than that the action is good, but hardly mindblowing.Overall, this movie is passably entertaining and all, but I'm easily amused.  But, in the end, it's kinda lame.  I really can't understand why this is so critically acclaimed.  There are lotsa films out there that I dislike that critics love, but I can usually understand their reasoning.  Not so here.  Who knew, decent action movie + generic semi-comic, semi-dramatic quasi love story equalled genius.  Though I guess thats where it comes from: Critics hate superhero movies, so when they see one that really deemphasizes this central fact, they get real excited.  Course, I don't like most of these comic book and superhero movies either, but replacing it with cliched drama isn't gonna help.  But hell, there are worse movies that have made a bazillion dollars, and it's nice that Raimi's got to be a real big deal.  Hopefully, he'll start making good movies again, someday.Grade: C-",3,Ehh. 2.5,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,2027,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'praise', 'received', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'write', 'belated', 'review', 'Simply', 'put', 'action', 'movie', 'usually', 'pretty', 'good', 'mostly', 'just', 'generic', 'romance/drama', 'crap', 'Here', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'very', 'much', 'dork', 'dorkette', 'When', 'personal', 'lives', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'musical', 'montage', 'Eww', 'not', 'just', 'mostly', 'whiny', 'romance/drama', '*lame*', 'romance/drama', 'spent', 'most', 'movie', 'wondering', 'when', 'hell', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'was', 'actually', 'going', 'DO', 'something', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'liked', 'Dr.Octopus', 'alright', 'kinda', 'charming', 'off', 'lot', 'better', 'then', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'usually', 'pretty', 'good', 'faulter', 'times', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'train', 'stupid', 'convoluted', 'believability', 'way', 'breaking', 'point', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'frickin', 'superhero', 'movie', 'other', 'action', 'good', 'hardly', 'mindblowing.Overall', 'movie', 'passably', 'entertaining', ""'m"", 'easily', 'amused', 'end', 'kinda', 'lame', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'are', 'lotsa', 'films', 'dislike', 'critics', 'love', 'can', 'usually', 'understand', 'reasoning', 'Not', 'so', 'here', 'Who', 'knew', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', '+', 'generic', 'semi-comic', 'semi-dramatic', 'quasi', 'love', 'story', 'equalled', 'genius', 'guess', 'thats', 'where', 'Critics', 'hate', 'superhero', 'movies', 'so', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'really', 'central', 'fact', 'get', 'real', 'excited', 'Course', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movies', 'replacing', 'cliched', 'drama', ""n't"", 'gon', 'help', 'hell', 'are', 'worse', 'movies', 'have', 'made', 'bazillion', 'dollars', 'nice', 'Raimi', 'got', 'be', 'real', 'big', 'deal', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'start', 'making', 'good', 'movies', 'again', 'someday.Grade', 'C-']",Spider-Man 2

621147,AEVS7RZ667VH4,B00005JMQW,Geoff Oldham,"[3, 8]","There are so many people who laud this as the best comic book movie ever. I call shenanigans on that. Lifting the excellent plot device of Superman 2, Petter Parker decides to surrender being Spider-Man in order to find love and a life. Unlike the decision made by Superman, where he is forced to change who he is in order to embrace a normal life and find true love, Peter Parker selfishly gives up being Spider-Man to continue being who he was to begin with, a dork with school, girls, and work on his mind. The opening of the movie leading up to the central part of the story work quite well and I applaud the writing. Dr. Octopus' origin and goals, Harry Osbourne's continuing disdain for Spider-Man, and Peter Parker's angst all come across realistically and draw the audience in. Then they start to throw in the cliches and lame plot devices, a clear foreshadowing to what was to cripple the third installment: Peter's subconscious ridding him of his powers because deep down he doesn't want to be Spider-Man, the kid asking Peter where Spider-Man disappeared to giving ol' Parker second thoughts on surrendering the persona, etc. This is New York City. The belief that Spidey's removal would prove dire not only insults the true heroes of the city (firemen, police, etc.) it also stretches the realms of believability. With Superman, the world truly suffered when he surrendered who he was to become someone else. With Peter, it never really makes sense as to why he would want to be Spidey again, especially since his life improved once he surrendered the persona. The death of Doc Oc at the end was unnecessary as was Harry's pause when he could have killed Pete and finally gain vengeance for the death of his father.Overall this was a fun movie. The best comic book movie, not quite. There is great writing and a good arc, but deep down it just rings hollow as to why Pete would want to remain Spidey.",3,Liked it better when it was called Superman 2,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,1912,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'laud', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'ever', 'call', 'shenanigans', 'Lifting', 'excellent', 'plot', 'device', 'Superman', '2', 'Petter', 'Parker', 'surrender', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'order', 'find', 'love', 'life', 'decision', 'made', 'Superman', 'where', 'forced', 'change', 'who', 'order', 'embrace', 'normal', 'life', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'up', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'continue', 'being', 'who', 'was', 'begin', 'dork', 'school', 'girls', 'work', 'mind', 'opening', 'movie', 'leading', 'up', 'central', 'part', 'story', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'applaud', 'writing', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'origin', 'goals', 'Harry', 'Osbourne', 'continuing', 'disdain', 'Spider-Man', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'angst', 'come', 'realistically', 'draw', 'audience', 'Then', 'start', 'throw', 'cliches', 'lame', 'plot', 'devices', 'clear', 'foreshadowing', 'what', 'was', 'cripple', 'third', 'installment', 'Peter', 'subconscious', 'ridding', 'powers', 'deep', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Spider-Man', 'kid', 'asking', 'Peter', 'where', 'Spider-Man', 'disappeared', 'giving', 'ol', 'Parker', 'second', 'thoughts', 'surrendering', 'persona', 'etc', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'belief', 'Spidey', 'removal', 'would', 'prove', 'dire', 'not', 'only', 'insults', 'true', 'heroes', 'city', 'firemen', 'police', 'etc', 'also', 'realms', 'believability', 'Superman', 'world', 'truly', 'suffered', 'when', 'surrendered', 'who', 'was', 'become', 'someone', 'else', 'Peter', 'never', 'really', 'sense', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'be', 'Spidey', 'again', 'especially', 'life', 'improved', 'once', 'surrendered', 'persona', 'death', 'Doc', 'Oc', 'end', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'Harry', 'pause', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'Pete', 'finally', 'gain', 'vengeance', 'death', 'father.Overall', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'writing', 'good', 'arc', 'deep', 'just', 'hollow', 'why', 'Pete', 'would', 'want', 'remain', 'Spidey']",Spider-Man 2

It starts with one of the best young actors of his generation, Tobey Maguire,  He has a fantastic ability to delve into the most human aspects of a character, and Spiderman is no exception to his resume.  He creates a sympathetic and identifiable character, who only appears to be a superhero in the most extreme action sequences, yet otherwise, comes across as just another man thrown into an amazing situation.Another comparison to the Star Wars trilogy, as The Empire Strikes Back, this is another sequel that over time may prove to be better than the original.  The spectacular effects are used well in this sequel, but toned back a little bit to allow the exploration of the characteres of both the hero and the villian.  Alfred Molina, as Doc Ock, delivers a magnificent performance, bringing to the screen a villian that one can not help but feel sympathetic for.  Doc Ock proves to be just as much victim as villian, a man tortured by his the horrible effects of his own brilliance.There was one aspect of this film that I felt did provide a less than perfect part of the exectution.  While delving into the tragedy of Spiderman and the catch-22 of his life, there are an awful lot of scenese where Tobey Maguire is crying.  It does, to a degree, seem to be just a little overdone.  However, as you see, I STILL gave this film 5 stars, as it is not nearly enough of a negative to drag down what is otherwise a great character study of both a hero and his nemesis.

Peter Parker's anguish, star-crossed lovers, megalomaniacs running amok..it is like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar rolled into an action movie.  Speaking of action, some of the sequences in this film are jaw dropping. The elevated subway ride is the best use of a subway in a movie since The Matrix and is just breathtaking. At the same time the movie is very well paced, razzle dazzle action sequences are mixed up with quiet moments of tenderness. The original Spiderman movie was fine but not in this league.

The resulting film is not only spectacular, but tops the original in almost every way.  Picking up two years from the events of the original film, Parker finds himself struggling to balance both his personal and super-hero lives without much success.  He loses his pizza delivery job despite using his web-swinging powers for some super fast transit.  He?s unable to prevent his beloved Aunt May from losing the family home.  And perhaps most heart-breaking of all, he alienates himself from everyone, especially the girl he loves, by seemingly never being anywhere on time.  (The fact that he?s late due to the need for his super heroic services doesn?t help matters.)  When his powers start to fade on him, our hero makes the decision to give up being Spider-Man.  Unfortunately, the best laid plans of man and spider go awry as a new super-villain named Doc Ock threatens New York with possible nuclear destruction.Just as before, Sam Raimi directs the whole thing with a keen and sure hand.  In fact, he seems to display more confidence as he effortlessly blends the film?s small and personable moments with the top notch CGI action scenes. Indeed, the entire cast seems more assured.  Tobey Maguire again proves that he was born to play the title role with his doe-eyed Peter Parker tugging at our heartstrings, even as we cheer his super heroics.  Kirsten Dunst matches him as Mary Jane, the girl he secretly loves.  J.K. Simmons again hams it up delightfully as J. Jonah Jameson, Peter?s bombastic newspaper boss.  Rosemary Harris gets a bit more to do as the always caring Aunt May.  However, it is the villainy of Alfred Molina?s Doc Ock that pushes this film up a notch.  Portrayed as a basically decent, if somewhat egotistical, scientist, Molina engages both our sympathies and our fears as his character is taken over by the mechanical tentacles that he wears.  It definitely is an improvement on the bombastic Green Goblin of the first film.  (In all fairness, Willem Dafoe, who reprises the role in a cameo, was handicapped by a costume that seemed to belong on a Power Rangers episode.)All in all, SPIDER-MAN 2 grabs your attention from the very first frame to the last.  It?s character and heart matches the large scale action to make a superhero film that is rarely seen these days.

But Spiderman 2 has truckloads more excitement, pathos and humor. Almost every area where the first film lagged in improved upon.Though I'm still not keen on Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker (not tall enough, too much of a geek) he was better in the role this time around. Though I'm not sure why he's still a total nerd. This is not how Peter Parker is portrayed in the comic books and it's weird that in the movie he comes across more like Clark Kent.The CGI effects are miles better too. Some shots still looked a little iffy, but rest was so seamless I never noticed. Granted, it would be hard to get any worse than effects in the original but I was genuinely surprised at how good they were. A lot more time and care as been put into arranging them than before.Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was a hundred what Willem Dafoe's campy, power-ranger Green Goblin was. You could tell that underneath he really was a good guy who was just too carried away with his work. He really did have a menacing presence in any scene featuring him with his extra arms (surely more resembling a spider Peter Parker). The earthquakes signalling his approach are very cool.The sequel has a more structured feel to it and has more inventive set-pieces. The first one felt like an empty showcase for effects but here they were integral to the story.I'm not keen on Kirsten Dunst though (she looks far too much like my ex). In the comics she is an outrageously proportioned and glamorous woman. I just don't see that in Kirsten Dunst. However, she really did get into the character and I believed in her relationship with Peter this time as before it felt like rejected sub-Dawson's Creek trash.Spiderman 2 is also made in widescreen, which is cool as I was disappointed at Sam Raimi's inexplicablely shooting the original 'flat'. A movie of this scale deserves scope and size and this time we get what we should have got before.Considering how the movie has already earned $40 kabillion in 3 weeks you hardly need me to tell you to go out and see it.

The method is always the same: stop the bad guy's mechanics by throwing a few strings in its gears. The rest of it is building up a network, in that case a cobweb. But this is a film, not an electronic game and we are at the cinema not in front of a game console. So the film adds a good layer of sentimental events and feelings. The girl friend from far behind. She is afraid and fascinated. She is jealous and possessive. She is maybe adult and open-minded. That kind of stuff gives to the film some interesting dimension. In the same way, in this film in particular, the super hero loses and even chooses to lose his powers, for a while at least. This whole dimension of a normal guy, a normal boy capable of normal feelings and cowardice is exploited here to reveal the other super-hero dimension is both a choice and a responsibility, a responsible choice and a chosen responsibility. Then the film can work as a film and not a dumb computer game. Then the bad guy has a new dimension. He is the self-victimized inventor of a machine that will destroy the world. But keep in mind that the solution to sink that nuclear fusion machine in order to kill it is rather primitive in intellectual value. But it is full of emotional pulpy strength. The fear of nuclear power is also typical of the beginning of this century when the oil companies were still the masters of the energetic game. We have since then entered the final stage of that oil dominance and we have to consider other solutions, particularly that do not produce carbon dioxide. It is also a reflection of a way of thinking in these 2002-2006 years: nuclear energy was only seen from the American point of view as basically criminal either in the hands of criminal individuals (that's the case here) or in the hands of criminal states.

FIrst his relationship with Mary Jane Watson has been going downhill, his grades are plummeting, his attendance at school has been going downhill and everything else that could go wrong goes wrong. It reaches the point that he decides to give up being a superhero in order to get things straight again.His decision however is put to the test when a scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius who Peter has worshipped as an idol has brought forth a project that involves a powerful fusion device that he believes will provide free energy for the entire country from just the one machine he built but when doing an experiment with mechanical, an accident occurs which the fusion causes a super gravititional force and the metal arms fuse onto his spinal cord, he is transformed into Doctor Octopus. Now Peter is faced with the daunting decision to just continue with his normal life or return to slinging webs to battle Dock Ock. Dock Ock aims to rebuild his project even when he realizes the dangers of it after the accident and now Spider Man must aim to save New York from his goals.This movie is amazing. The first was great but this one is even better. The comic humor is brilliant especially with J. Jonah Jameson getting ticked off all the time with Spider-Man and wanting to make his left a living hell. The special effects are great and not overdone and they look very realisic especially the fusion reaction that occurs when the machine is activated.While not necessarily the greatest sequel of all time (That honor belongs to ""The Godfather Part II, and ""Terminator 2"") this is nonetheless one of the greatest sequels ever and I strongly recommend seeing it today.

I thought the film was entertaining but I certainly don't think it deserves all the hoopla that's been going around. Visually, it didn't offer anything that was new. The plot was very different from the first but what I liked about the first one was the character development.....getting to know who these people are. In Spider 2, it seemed that there were so many maudlin moments that were unnecessary. Constantly telling the audience that things are bad. Alrgiht. I got the point. Move on. I thought the acting was very forced also. Too many tears for a comic book character.

The two motivating factors that I found intriguing and what gives a debate around the plot of the movie is the use of nannotechnology or in this case 'nannowires' and fusion technology that makes scenes and storylines appears more of a reality than a fiction. Believe it or not we aren't too far away that nannochips and the technology that surrounds the use of molecular technology will by far replaced most conventional forms of technology we see today. In fact a world driven by nannotechnology will reflect the depth and nature of the problems we have today--such as an ever growing population crises exarcabeted with recent events such as the recent Asian tsunami crises and perhaps growing regional instablility along with subsequent massive wars. If indeed there would be required more usage of nannotechnology, the way we see life and tackle our daily social and cultural problems will in due time place a radical stronghold on the debates and the approach of future public policy.Spiderman 2 like most of the comic book series is set supposedly in New York City, a city that is recovering from the fears of terrorism from the recent World Trade Center. Some of the scenes in the movie  such as the fact when Spideman lose his mask and the crowd around him saw his face and  responded that they won't tell anybody who he is reflects as what the director would assume that people make great and enlightening choices but there is in the world we live in stuff like that going on everyday and subsequently about to happen.Scientific accomplishment such as cold fusion as we see with Doctor Octopus only states that evils comes from the megolamania of scientific and economic achievement, nothing more than a part of human nature. Of course whether or not cold fusion ever really happened because of the claims that it did happened remains questionable but if ever in the events the likelihood of such achievement were ever to occur, there will be bound to be, de novo institutions, individuals and entities that poses societal, international and public danger and threat  that is unforeseen.  That is what makes the future future and the past just history.Though the movie itself might come off simple it is just that some of the points and motifs that it is surrounded by allows the script more to be work with.

The same deal at Wal-Mart will cost you $1 more ($12.96) as of July 1, 2012.So, what's the bad news?

Like any true artist, he has improved upon his craft with time and experience and it really shines through in the movie. Every element that could feasibly be improved upon from the last outing has. I.e. character development, plot, action, etc. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina give spot-on performances and really help to enhance the emotional aspect of the story. The action sequences occur much more freqeuenly, are more elaborate and quite frankly, beautiful to look at. And for the die-hard fans, the film continues to remain faithful to the comics in the continual unraveling of Peter Parker's life. But what I enjoyed most about this comic-to-film adaptation is that underneath the flashy action scenes and the over-the-top super-hero/arch villian rivalry is that at its core, the film retains a beating heart and a moral foundation that has all but disentigrated when it comes to how most other super-heroes and their motives are conveyed.

621179,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,B00005JMQW,jasoneducator,"[0, 1]","Saw Spiderman 2 last night and my feelings about the flick echo my feelings about Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" album. It appeals to all and deserves its widespread praise. It's got great riffs, great heros, great action, and a great story. Peter Parker's struggle to embrace the sacrifices of his gifts and the compelling villain drive a fast-spaced story. You'll dig the flick and it's worth the price to see it on the big screen and dig the action on the big spreen. The subway scene was my favorite action.A big motif is how Spiderman is revealed to many throughout the movie. Peter's got to wrestle with how to share his double identity with those closest to him so that the sacrifices of his double life don't paralyze him from utilizing his superpowers. Anonymous New Yorker's dig spiderman and respond well at a given point which I will not reveal to those who haven't scene the flick. Also, he needs understanding from them so he can deal with the boulders of guilt still lingering from his uncle's death. Many have commented on how character focus is a big strength of the movie, and I'll definitely agree on that point.I watched Spiderman one on HBO a couple of times and that movie revealed some truly sappy lines that don't wear well on repeated viewings. Several scenes in Spiderman 2 will also probably grow moldy with age. A couple of characters from the first movie who have passed away are brought back in unnecessary sentimental ways. Much like Michael Jackson's ""I'm a lover, not a fighter"" cheesiness on Thriller, I think that some of the dialogue in this flick is pretty cheesy.I recommend you see this flick, because it's probably going to be the best action flick of the summer, and it will hold up better on the big screen than on video.

Overrated and tensionless action sequencesStrengths of the Second Spiderman:  1.) plenty of humor 2.) One of the best supervillains portrayed on screen (and from weak source material, Doc Oc in the comic books was pathetic...the screenwriters did a masterful job of reinterpreting the character and making him more complex and more menacing for the screen) and 3.) heartstopping action sequences.  The first film neglected the wall-crawling comic book visuals that made Spiderman so popular, which was the image of Spidey jumping from wall to wall to ceiling.  Too many jumping up and down, punching, dangling from bridges in the first film.  In this one, the sideways battle against Doc Oc on the speeding subway is flawless and ranks w/, if not trumps, some of the ""artistic"" action sequences in the first Matrix.I admit, I never cared much for Spidey when I collected comic books (even though I bought Amazing Spiderman and Web of Spiderman and Spectacular Spiderman regularly...go figure).  I liked Batman, Iron Man, Dr. Strange...Spidey was way down on the list.  This movie made me like Spiderman as a character.  Peter Parker is so root-for-able.  His inner conflict is both personal yet epic, he becomes a new mythological character for modern America--the struggle between living one's life for oneself, and living one's life for others.

Peter Parker, always striving to stay out of trouble, always late, never getting anyone's approval, self doubting, always dissatisfied with his life. A nerd, can't dress, living in a dump, the worst of luck (which I think he brings on himself when he doesn't believe in himself, esp since his cosmic spidey sense should correct for that). He doesn't have all the snide, quippy humor in costume he had in the comic, but given his stage in life and on screen it makes sense; I'll expect it in the next film.Dr. Octopus, perfect. His look, his mannerisms, his portrayal, the tendrils, absolutely dead on. Could not have done any better if you had pulled him straight from the imagination of the child I was when I first discovered the comic.Jonah Jameson, good lord, hysterically dead on. Impeccable.This movie has completely restored my faith in hero/comic films. Granted, many of the Marvel films of late have been pretty good, but this one by far exemplifies the best of Marvel, the best of Spiderman. The scene after he saves the folks on the train, that is how heroes are thanked.I bought this movie on a fluke, despite not having seen it in the theater, because it was on sale. It is now my favorite superhero film ever, outdoing both Xmen and the original Tobey Spiderman.It is a synthesis of good acting, good sets, good CGI, good cinematography, good direction, perfect timing, and blends both light hearted sense of humor with seriousness and as well as both dreams & daily life.

The villain in the first film, the Green Goblin, was horrible. Green Goblin had a terrible costume, terrible motives, and there wasn't anything resounding about him. This time around we have a villain that is compelling and tragic. His story as a driven scientist and the sudden and violent demise of his career and spouse makes this character much more human and real. The tentacle effects are great. Overall the action seems much more real as compared to the over use of the CGI Spider-man that the first film employed.What keeps me from falling truly in love with the franchise, and most comic book franchises, are the super heroes themselves, in this case Spider-Man. In most of these comic book films the heroes are real downers. They constantly whine about their powers and their responsibilities. They seem to pout a lot about not having a ""normal life"". That's why the X-men films are better in my opinion. I like seeing characters like Magneto who embrace their powers and use them to their full advantage with enthusiasm.I look forward to the third film of the franchise as it seems a lot of the emotional weight that Peter Parker carries in the first two films is lifted which might lead to a more enthusiastic and exciting superhero a few years from now.",4,"Better than the first, no question",1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1386,"['Spider-Man', '2', 'hands', 'down', 'better', 'original', 'reason', 'improvement', 'clearly', 'villain', 'Doctor', 'Ock', 'villain', 'first', 'film', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'was', 'horrible', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'had', 'terrible', 'costume', 'terrible', 'motives', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'resounding', 'time', 'have', 'villain', 'compelling', 'tragic', 'story', 'driven', 'scientist', 'sudden', 'violent', 'demise', 'career', 'spouse', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'real', 'tentacle', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'action', 'much', 'more', 'real', 'compared', 'over', 'use', 'CGI', 'Spider-man', 'first', 'film', 'employed.What', 'falling', 'truly', 'love', 'franchise', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'franchises', 'are', 'super', 'heroes', 'case', 'Spider-Man', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'heroes', 'are', 'real', 'downers', 'constantly', 'whine', 'powers', 'responsibilities', 'seem', 'pout', 'lot', 'not', 'having', 'normal', 'life', 'why', 'X-men', 'films', 'are', 'better', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'characters', 'Magneto', 'who', 'embrace', 'powers', 'use', 'full', 'advantage', 'enthusiasm.I', 'look', 'forward', 'third', 'film', 'franchise', 'lot', 'emotional', 'weight', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'lifted', 'might', 'lead', 'more', 'enthusiastic', 'exciting', 'superhero', 'few', 'years', 'now']",Spider-Man 2

Ever since ""Lord of the Rings,"" extended DVDs of movies in franchise series have become the norm, and some are not very impressive. One thing that made me decide to get it was completely new Special Features. I'd bought the first two Spider-Man films earlier this year, and I hate getting a DVD with an altered movie but the same Special Features rehashed.The extended film is worth it! (Especially at $13) Instead of little bits where you immediately think ""Oh, look, something new,"" the new bits of footage here are so seamlessly interwoven, most of the time I realized ""That wasn't there before!""There's a longer talk between Harry and Peter during Pete's birthday party, which leads into Aunt May and MJ bringing in the cake. (I didn't pause to count the candles!) There's a new scene where a friend of MJ's asks her if she's sure she's with the right guy, strengthening the ending. The elevator scene is not extended: it's a completely different and longer version! I don't laugh at movies much, but this new scene dug up some chuckles! There are also new bits added to the fight on the train, as well as other bits. Because of the seamless integrating, I can't quite recall them all!I would have liked to have seen some other scenes extended: more about Aunt May would have been nice: in fact, after watching this, I found out there was a scene in some theatrical versions that had Peter call Aunt May near the end of the film, but for some reason she doesn't answer the phone, though she is seen hearing it ring. This would've been interesting, and helped further whet our appetites for ""Spider-Man 3.""However, there is nothing here that would make the movie go beyond a PG-13 rating, so if you're looking for more violence, blood, gore, nudity, or sexual or sensual material, it's not here. As above stated, some of the fight scenes are extended, but nothing worse than what was already in the movie.Regarding the Special Features, now: I haven't watched them all yet. Like I said before, the Special Features of the previous DVD are not repeated, but the menus are otherwise identical. Not even the Audio Commentary is the same. In fact, this time Producer Laura Ziskin and Screenwriter Alvin Sargent get to do the commentary. I'm an aspiring screenwriter myself, so I intend to listen to this commentary soon.From what the packages say, the Spidey Sense feature (I haven't used it on the other one) is at least enhanced, showing you behind the scenes footage. However, the shrinking of the movie to make it ""Picture in Picture"" can be annoying, especially if your DVD player pauses for a transition.There is one weak special feature: ""Inside 2.1"" just points out the new and extended scenes... really, shouldn't this be on the audio commentary?The other special feaures are ""Sneak Peek: Spider-Man 3,"" ""Multi-Angle: Danny Elfman's Score,"" ""With Great Effort Comes Great Recognition,"" and ""Visual Effects Breakdowns.""If you're planning a ""Spider-Man Party"" before going to see ""Spider-Man 3,"" get this one!

His after-hours life as a masked crime-fighter doesn't assuage the guilt and barely pays the bills. Peter has no life. Yet his inner decency won't let him abandon those who need him.

Despite Mary Jane's ""bottled"" red hair, the organic webbing and the really lousy Green Goblin costume, the movie was wonderful and deserved all that it took in at the box office. So, what's so good about the sequel?The plot was amazing. In it, you could see all sorts of little nods to various issues of the comic book. When Peter is seen walking away from the costume that he has just thrown in the trash can, I could distincly remember the cover of the ""Amazing Spiderman"" comic where he gave up the duds.The special effects in the first movie were, in my opinion, better than most people gave them credit for. But I'll admit that some of them looked unreal. That isn't a problem in this movie. The effects are so real, you won't even notice them. At times, they'll have close-ups of Spidey swinging through the city that look absolutely breathtaking. My favorite is when he swings between the cab and trailer of the rig while chasing a car with some thugs in it..I noted that the producers seemed to ""compromise"" between Mary Jane's hair and that of Kirsten Dunst. The result is a Mary Jane with slightly ""strawberry blonde"" hair. I never even missed the comic character's hair color.Doctor Octopus has always been one of my favorite Spiderman villains. I was looking forward to seeing what they would do with him. I wasn't disappointed. He was a true, well-rounded character. Seeing the battle between the wills of Octavius and the tentacles was good, even if the character was a bit different from the ""Doc Ock"" in the comics. This ""split-personality"" seemed to work so much better than the one between the Goblin and Norman Osborn.On a side note, my daughter, her ""Spiderman and Friends"" teether held tightly in her hands, sat quietly on my wife's lap throughout the movie.

I was told by a lot of people I work with that this was much better than the first, were they wrong!!!  The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions.  The plot is a joke.  Emotions in this movie are very easily changed and are not beliveable.  Tobey Maguire does the best he can with the silly plot.  I myself have never read a Spiderman comic book in my life but a friend of mine I went with had.  She was equally dissapointed with it.  I know that when most people go to see a movie, they understand that there is a lot that his going to be fiction. This movie really, REALLY stretches that concept.  Example.  You want Spiderman dead so bad that you are willing to let an evil scientist have something that could cause the deaths of millions of people just to get the chance to kill Spiderman. Only when you have the opportunity, it only takes 30 seconds to change that idea.  This is just one of the many scenes that takes place in this movie that really don't make sense.  Also, I don't know about you but if I were in a bank, I would notice a man with 8 limbs, 4 of which are metal, come in!Harry Potter was released a month ago.  I thought that movie was 100 times better.  It has a plot, a hero and a well thought out script.

Additions tend to underperform when the sequels are an afterthought.  The previous film felt like a complete story, but it seemed to leave open the story for this film.  After watching this film, the viewer knows (especially if the viewer is a fan of the story already) that there are many stories still to come.The story again touches on the theme of responsibility.  Peter is still struggling to accept that he has to sacrifice the things he wants because of the responsibility that comes with his superpowers.  He wants a normal life and wants the proverbial girl, but he must stand between the bad guys and the people of New York City.  Alfred Molina, in a great turn as Doctor Octopus, gives Peter a lesson and example in accepting responsibility.The writers have left several hints of future stories.  First, we see J. Jonah Jameson's son the astronaut.  Second, we see Dr. Connors teaching one of Peter Parker's classes.  For a comics fan, I can't wait to see the movie versions of these characters in the future.The film's focus is on Peter Parker's coming to grips with his responsibility and does not show as much of Doctor Octopus as I may have liked, but this is still a fine story.

Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker and the web-slinging superhero.  A normal, but somewhat geeky college student, Parker springs into action as Spiderman at the first sign of danger. Kirsten Dunst is back as Mary Jane Watson.  At the end of Spidey one, Mary Jane and Peter told each other that they were in love, but Peter said that he could never be with Mary Jane.  She is now a highly successful Broadway actress who has fallen in love with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Daily Bugle.  James Franco stars as Harry Osborn.  He has taken over contol of his father's business after his death in the first movie.  (His father was the Green Goblin in Spidey 1).  Harry blames his father's death on Spiderman and vows to avenge his father by destroying Spiderman.  His company has developed a way to improve the fusion process, and with the cooperation of Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina, they have developed a strange set of titanium tentacles that can be controlled by the brain of the person wearing them.However, something goes terribly wrong during a demonstration, and Dr. Octavius is forever changed as a result.  Somehow, the arms seem to have taken control of Dr. Octavius, and he is now under their power.  Determined to complete his research, Dr. Octavius turns to crime and becomes known as Doc Ock, due to his similarity to an octupus.Soon, Doc Ock and Spiderman are fighting it out, waging battles in banks and on top of speeding commuter trains.  Ock realizes that he needs money to complete his research, so he visits Harry and makes a deal; Ock will kill Spiderman and Harry's company will give Ock the funding he needs to finish his research.Will Ock succed in his devious plan to finish his fusion research and possibly destroy New York City in the process?  Will Spiderman stop him before its too late?  Will Peter and Mary Jane get together?  Will Harry succeed in his bid to destroy Spiderman?I thought Spidey 2 was much better than the original.  The actors, especially Alfred Molina, give excellent performances, and the action and thrills are non-stop.  The ending of the movie is left wide-open for a possible Spidey 3.  I highly recommend this fun and action-packed movie.

621192,A10BWW5GU19AD,B00005JMQW,Jeff Wiley,"[1, 2]","There is a fine line when creating a movie based on a comic book character between satisfying the comics' diehard fans, as well as satisfying the casual movie fan who might not be a fan of the comic in question. Director Sam Raimi has accomplished both in ""Spiderman 2"".Long-time, diehard fans of Spiderman (like myself) should be very satisfied with some of the classic Spiderman storylines brought to the big screen in this latest cinematic episode. Grading on a comics curve, the acting is also top notch.The chemistry between Tobey Maguire (""Peter Parker/Spiderman"") and Kirsten Dunst (""Mary Jane Watson"") is top-shelf, and I felt even better than the first movie. They do a fine job at recreating the tormented romance the characters experienced in the comics.Alfred Molina absolutely delivers as Otto Octavius, a brilliant scientist who falls victim to a horrible accident involving his own creation, giving birth to the maniacal Doctor Octopus.I've always regarded the fight scene above Metropolis from ""Superman II"" as the measuring stick for comic movie fight scenes. However, the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus may quickly become the new standard. The CGI is second-to-none, and the intensity between the characters is fantastic.It is, by no means, a perfect movie. There are flaws within it, and there are certain scenes that I took issue with (the climax of the train scene, Octopus' inner monologue, etc.). However, Raimi seems to have learned from his mistakes from the original movie, and delivers a movie that has a near-perfect balance between action, romance, character development, laughs, and honesty to the original characters. All things considered this is a movie that will satisfy both the Webheads, as well as the average moviegoer-on-the-street.The DVD extras are also top-notch, rounding out a perfect package for the comic fans in your life.

The letter box screen opens your eyes, a normal format seems like a blinder, blocking your peripheral. It sucks for those who own small televisions, but even still, buy this version. You never know when you'll upgrade (you poor, sweet things.) This film came as a surprise to me. Although It shouldn't be. Raimi is a proven director, at least to me. The casting is appropriate, Thanks goodness all of them signed on again. Toby is known to have trouble opening up on the screen. He's naturally quiet I hear. But I don't agree. In cider house rules you see a disturbed querry in his performance. In Spidey 1, he grew in physical bearing, and he pulled off a convincing teenager. I mean, you won't hear him being nominated for an Oscar any time soon, but who does with these sort of movies. Best actor's always are won by the less popular roles, Like that of the disabled. The second installment says hello to a hero that is bothered by stress. And even Super Hero's crack under stress! His hidden passions dibilitate his web slingings. If only he would just open up more, Peter that is. A great action flick with a dramatic zest. Personally, I was expecting the Hob goblin for this movie.

621194,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00005JMQW,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","In my review of Spiderman, I stated it was the best the Superhero movie of all, the 1978 version of Superman with Christopher Reeve (RIP) being the close second.  Now, I have to say, with great confidence that Spiderman 2 is the best.Looking back at the great job Sam Raimi did with the first Spiderman, I was so glad to erase my fears of him making it campy and over the top as some of his fantasy type movies are.  I know he had the skills to do other genres but I feared what he would do with one of my own beloved characters that I had grown up with.  Then he started making the second one, I asked myself; would he go push the limits further because he has more money?  Thankfully no.Raimi, the script writers, Toby Macguire, Kirsten Dunst and the rest of the cast created a deeply emotional and stunning portrayal of life as a Superhero in the real world.  He gets fired from his job, he watches helplessly as his Aunt goes bankrupt, he fails his courses in school, all because he feels this hard bound responsibility to use his powers whenever he sees trouble.  He is obsessed with righting wrongs because of his uncles death that he could have prevented.  He can't even tell the girl he loves how he feels because he fears for her safety, even though she throws herself at him.  The massive burden he has placed on himself because of his abilities puts him in a position to think of everyone but himself.There are moments in this movie that will have you welling up with tears.  Aunt May gives a speech about `the hero in all of us' that will have you begging her to stop.  There is a scene where a group of New Yorkers on a train, after he saves their lives, learn more about Spiderman than they thought they ever would.  In that moment the true nature of his intentions and motives are revealed to them and and in turn, change their view of him.  The sacrafices of Peter Parker can make you re-think all those childhood dreams of wanting to be a superhero.  The trials and hardships could make anyone decide that juggling the life of a superhero and everyday person can be the most difficult and selfless thing a person can do, and in turn make them decide that it is not something they can deal with.This movie is awesome, emotional and complete.  The effects are better then the first movie and the story is involving.

That's all I'm saying about that.I've read some of the bad reviews posted on here and came across one.....only one! that is actually well thought out and deserves any respect.  I don't agree with the opinion of that particular person about the movie but I can see their point of view.  The others?  Come on, people......  Look, if you are not sure about the movie and want to read some reviews, think about something for a minute.  How much advice do you want to take from someone that can not even write out a simple thought?  Look at the spelling, look at the grammer.  These people just seem to come out of the woods or something just looking for anything popular to rip apart and be the 'minority' on any particular subject.  I read those reviews only because i've seen this trend on amazon revolving around the 'mainstream', popular stuff.  If you read any review on here (good or bad) just please keep in mind the type of person you may be taking advice from.  There's no reading-between-the-lines necessary on here.(okay, I will say one more thing about the movie.  I've collected comics for 16 years and have well over seven thousand.  I believe the train rescue scene to be the greatest superhero moment i've ever seen.  Comics or movies.  It just showed the hero in him to risk his life to save those people, no matter how difficult the task or how much it hurt him.  Look at the acting during that.  Fantastic.  He was standing in a blue screen environment with props and still pulled off the pain of being stretched out on the front of a run-away train.  Don't believe me?

The script is very well done with a ton of character build-up. Peter Parker loses his web slinging abilities and has to figure out how to get them back or maybe he doesn't even want them back. Him being too busy fighting crime is losing him jobs and also  Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)  the women he loves. Fearing that she'd get hurt if she was part of his life is keeping him from letting her in. So she gives up on waiting for Peter and starts dating a hot shot astronaut. Harry Osborne  (James Franco), still blames Spidey for the death of his father and swears that he will get revenge. He's so obsessed with it that it's ruining his friendship with Peter. Since he thinks Peter knows who Spiderman is and is mad that he won't tell him.Harry's also using a brilliant scientist in Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) to try and invent something huge to get his father's business running once again. The invention fails and leaves Doctor Octavius with metal tentacles stuck to his spine. He's not a bad man but with the chip broken that let him control the tentacles, they now control him. He wants to continue his project but needs Harry's help but first Harry wants him to capture Spiderman for him.The result is a well put together movie full of so much that it feels like 3 hours and not just 2 hours and 7 minutes. There's a lot of dialogue and it can be slow but the action scenes are off the chart when there is action. It focuses more on the character Spiderman and the people in his life. May sound boring but when it all comes together at the end it's very satisfying. Plus it's more romantic than the first and Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have even better chemestry this time around.

621200,APRU373UYVK2Y,B00005JMQW,J. N. Mohlman,"[2, 2]","It's an odd circumstance when a sequel surpasses the original in most every way, and it is perhaps even more so when the original was nothing to scoff at to begin with.  Nonetheless, director Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" is in every way a superior film to the original.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the original ""Spider-Man"", but in this follow-up Raimi has really found his stride, and explores themes that are awfully sophisticated for what could have easily succeeded as a vacuous summer thrill-fest.Specifically, it is in Raimi's on-going exploration of the everyman hero that is Peter Parker where the film shines.  As the story progresses, Parker begins to realize that there is a price to be paid for his abilities, and that perhaps heroism isn't quite what its made out to be.  This facet of the super-hero is nicely realized by Tobey Maguire, who, while he may be a rather leaden actor, nonetheless carries himself with a certain dignity that nicely suits the role.  In sharp contrast is the superb Kirsten Dunst, who once again steals the film as the vibrant Mary Jane.  Finally, Alfred Molina offers an outstanding performance as the erstwhile villain, Doctor Octavius.As I indicated, this film is more than adequate as a typical Hollywood blockbuster.  The special effects are nicely handled, and those surrounding Doc Ock's mechanical arms are particularly impressive.  While Spider-man occasionally looks a little too perfect, he nonetheless offers some remarkable visual treats.  However, it is the deeper elements which really set this film apart.Above all, this is a New York movie, and more specifically, a New York movie informed by 9/11.  While the original was released after the tragedy, it was filmed almost entirely prior, and as such, it didn't really reflect its impact.  In ""Spider-Man 2"", Raimi takes the perspective we all gained as a result of that day, and applies it to his film.  Cops and firemen aren't heroes because they are cops and firemen, they are heroes because they choose to do the jobs that most of us don't want.  It is this element of choice that Raimi explores in his perfectly conflicted Peter Parker.Parker didn't ask for his powers, and it is only as he begins to lose them that he realizes being a hero has nothing to do with ability, and everything to do with subsuming one's desires to the greater good.  Once he steps outside of his own self interest, he begins to realize the totality of his gift.  This transformation is nicely illustrated in a series of scenes that parallel events in the original movie.  In particular, a fire scene links the two movies together in a very effective way.Conversely, the portrayal of Doc Ock as a truly conflicted villain provides the perfect counterpoint.  He's not evil per se, and his acts are as much a result of circumstance as ill intent.  He reveals the latent dark side in all of us, and displays the all too ready dangers of hubris.  At this same time, early scenes create a character with tremendous pathos, and as such this is a villain that you don't want to root against out of disgust.Exciting, funny, original and deeply thoughtful, ""Spider-Man 2"" is a unique film.  While there are elements that need to be taken with a grain of salt, one can't deny that Raimi has striven to rise above the ordinary action movie clich&eacute;s.  While it can be enjoyed as the mega-hit that it was, there is a lot going on under the surface, and as such, this film stands apart.  ""Spider-Man 2"" is a real treat, and definitely not to be missed.Jake Mohlman",5,The rare sequel that is better than the original,1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3544,"['odd', 'circumstance', 'when', 'sequel', 'original', 'most', 'way', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'original', 'was', 'nothing', 'scoff', 'begin', 'Nonetheless', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'way', 'superior', 'film', 'original', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'loved', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'follow-up', 'Raimi', 'really', 'found', 'stride', 'themes', 'are', 'awfully', 'sophisticated', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'succeeded', 'vacuous', 'summer', 'thrill-fest.Specifically', 'Raimi', 'on-going', 'exploration', 'everyman', 'hero', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'where', 'film', 'shines', 'story', 'Parker', 'realize', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'abilities', 'perhaps', 'heroism', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'facet', 'super-hero', 'nicely', 'realized', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'leaden', 'actor', 'nonetheless', 'certain', 'dignity', 'nicely', 'suits', 'role', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'superb', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'vibrant', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Finally', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'erstwhile', 'villain', 'Doctor', 'Octavius.As', 'indicated', 'film', 'more', 'adequate', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nicely', 'handled', 'surrounding', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'are', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'Spider-man', 'occasionally', 'little', 'too', 'perfect', 'nonetheless', 'remarkable', 'visual', 'treats', 'However', 'deeper', 'elements', 'really', 'set', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'more', 'specifically', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'informed', '9/11', 'original', 'was', 'released', 'tragedy', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'prior', 'such', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'reflect', 'impact', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Raimi', 'perspective', 'gained', 'result', 'day', 'film', 'Cops', 'firemen', 'are', ""n't"", 'heroes', 'are', 'cops', 'firemen', 'are', 'heroes', 'choose', 'do', 'jobs', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'element', 'choice', 'Raimi', 'perfectly', 'conflicted', 'Peter', 'Parker.Parker', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'powers', 'only', 'lose', 'being', 'hero', 'nothing', 'do', 'ability', 'everything', 'do', 'subsuming', 'one', 'desires', 'greater', 'good', 'Once', 'own', 'self', 'interest', 'realize', 'totality', 'gift', 'transformation', 'nicely', 'illustrated', 'series', 'scenes', 'parallel', 'events', 'original', 'movie', 'particular', 'fire', 'scene', 'two', 'movies', 'together', 'very', 'effective', 'way.Conversely', 'portrayal', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'truly', 'conflicted', 'villain', 'perfect', 'counterpoint', 'not', 'evil', 'se', 'acts', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'result', 'circumstance', 'ill', 'intent', 'latent', 'dark', 'side', 'too', 'ready', 'dangers', 'hubris', 'same', 'time', 'early', 'scenes', 'create', 'character', 'tremendous', 'pathos', 'such', 'villain', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'root', 'disgust.Exciting', 'funny', 'original', 'deeply', 'thoughtful', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'unique', 'film', 'are', 'elements', 'need', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Raimi', 'striven', 'rise', 'ordinary', 'action', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'mega-hit', 'was', 'lot', 'going', 'surface', 'such', 'film', 'apart', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'real', 'treat', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'missed.Jake', 'Mohlman']",Spider-Man 2

The emotional life of the characters, which is what always distinguished Marvel's best work from other comics, is ripened (even over-ripened) for the film. It's done with love and care, and except for young Harry (callow actor instead of the performance of a callow character) it's very well cast. I kept hoping Donna Murphy would be regenerated too, she's much too interesting to die so quickly. The shifting camera expands on the original artwork of Steve Ditko who thought in odd camera angles. Rosemary Harris is eerily like the Ditko Aunt May, and like Alec Guiness in ""Star Wars"" it's her fate now to be remembered for this instead of a lifetime of great stage work. Hopefully well paid. In the comic there was usually some rather bitter comic moment to break the pathos and the opening section could use one, as Peter begins to take on Job or Christ dimensions of burden, but the tone is just right otherwise. There is a strange quality of several sequences filmed and played is if they were dreams (the child lifting Peter in the fire) without explanation, but the consistancy of it becomes the style. For an adult movie-goer, this genre from Hollywood is never going to be any better. Which is high praise and criticism at once. This fan suggests the Sandman would make for spectacular effects in another sequel; too bad Joseph Cotton isn't around to play him (Ditko's drawing resembled a squared off version of the 40s star).",4,Fan of the Comic Appreciates the Film,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1575,"['one-time', 'owner', 'Spider-Man', '6', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'fan', 'bombastic', 'Hollywood', 'mega-films', 'high', 'praise', 'good', 'emotional', 'life', 'characters', 'what', 'always', 'distinguished', 'Marvel', 'best', 'work', 'other', 'comics', 'ripened', 'even', 'over-ripened', 'film', 'done', 'love', 'care', 'young', 'Harry', 'callow', 'actor', 'instead', 'performance', 'callow', 'character', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'would', 'be', 'regenerated', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'interesting', 'die', 'so', 'quickly', 'shifting', 'camera', 'original', 'artwork', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'who', 'thought', 'odd', 'camera', 'angles', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'eerily', 'Ditko', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fate', 'now', 'be', 'remembered', 'instead', 'lifetime', 'great', 'stage', 'work', 'Hopefully', 'well', 'paid', 'comic', 'was', 'usually', 'rather', 'bitter', 'comic', 'moment', 'break', 'pathos', 'opening', 'section', 'could', 'use', 'one', 'Peter', 'take', 'Job', 'Christ', 'dimensions', 'burden', 'tone', 'just', 'right', 'otherwise', 'strange', 'quality', 'several', 'sequences', 'filmed', 'played', 'were', 'dreams', 'child', 'lifting', 'Peter', 'fire', 'explanation', 'consistancy', 'style', 'adult', 'movie-goer', 'genre', 'Hollywood', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'Which', 'high', 'praise', 'criticism', 'once', 'fan', 'Sandman', 'would', 'make', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'sequel', 'too', 'bad', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', ""n't"", 'around', 'play', 'Ditko', 'drawing', 'resembled', 'squared', 'off', 'version', '40s', 'star']",Spider-Man 2

621205,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00005JMQW,John Kwok,"[15, 18]","In Spider-Man 2 director Sam Raimi and his talented team of writers, including distinguished novelist Michael Chabon, have crafted what is the finest film I have seen based on a Marvel Comics superhero. There's more impressive chases and fights between the hero and villain in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; than I have seen, for example, in the &quot;X-Men&quot; films. However, the film works best at the emotional - indeed humane - level, in which we see both the villain, Doc Ock, Doctor Otto Octavius (brilliantly performed by Alfred Molina) and the hero, Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) wrestle with their consciences. Indeed Spider-Man must make a difficult decision; whether to use his unique gifts to protect his fellow citizens or lose them to gain finally the trust and love of his long-time friend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He must also contend unexpectedly with his friendship with the son of Harry Osborn aka the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) unraveling, setting up the plot of what undoubtedly will be the third film in the series. Raimi has done such an excellent job in raising the stakes in the second film, which is literally a major improvement over the first, that it may be a difficult challenge for him to meet. Aside from Molina, Maguire and Durst, Rosemary Harris gives yet another splendid performance as Peter's aunt. Composer Danny Elfman's score may be his most brooding ever, equal to his excellent film score for the first Batman film.

621208,A5I8OWSLWM1MF,B00005JMQW,John Michael Kain,"[1, 1]","I think Spiderman 2 is one of the all time best movies. It is full of both action and adventure, based on the old superhero comics and cartoons. The effects used in this movie obviously took a long time to develop and administer. A large-budget movie with a large-budget profit.I saw this on the big screen several times, and not once did I loose my interesting. I think my favorite part about this movie-and there are a lot-is the criminal. This one is so much more original and developed than the green goblin, which was used in the first Spiderman movie.The third Spiderman movie is due out May 2007. While my hopes for that are high, I firmly believe that Spiderman 2 will be better simply because I know the basis of the plot for the next movie.Spiderman two takes the viewer into the depths of the main character, Peter Parker aka Spiderman. Very strongly developed. I think one of the main reasons this film was such a big success, other than from the past fame, is that it was relatable.

Just a drive-thru review of this already legendary superhero movie...Spider-Man 2 (2004) pretty much lives up to its praise since its release.  Tobey Maguire turns in a solid performance in the leading role.  Kirsten Dunst also does pretty well.  The movie seems to have a little bit of everything - action, romance, suspense, etc.  Not to mention tons and I mean TONS of CGI.  I must say that a lot of the action sequences are a little unbelievable, even for a guy who spins webs and swings all over the place.  A movie like this really can only be made by using CGI technology.  For the many people out there who want CGI to look totally real and believable, this movie falls short somewhat.  It looks cartoonish in a lot of sequences.  Personally, it doesn't matter too much to me if CGI looks fake or real because I'm not a big fan of CGI to begin with.  I just get a kick out of the movies that come out that look like video games and it makes me think that the makers of the movie should have waited for technology to improve before they made their movies so they'll look more realistic for the always-demanding audience.  For all the nit-pickers out there who want everything looking crystal clear, in high definition, and with believable ""graphics"", then this movie does fall short.  Maybe the Spider-Man movies came out too soon.  Maybe they should have been made in the last couple of years instead of 2002, 2004, etc. since CGI technology has improved since then.

621213,A1B8HI3VREI1H3,B00005JMQW,Jorge A. Zarco,"[1, 1]","Spider-Man 2(2004) is a good sequel and a good superhero movie. It's the first Spiderman movie filmed in 70mm widescreen format. The first Spiderman movie was an origin story while this film is more of a coming of age story. There's deja vu moments such as Peter Parker going into a burning building to rescue someone. For some reason, Spider-Man 2 has high levels of ""brightness""! We also get to hear B.J. Thomas' catchy song Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) struggles to be with Mary Jane, go to school, work at a job, and fight crime as Spider-Man. Spiderman also has to stop Doc Ock from destroying New York City. Spider-Man 2 is blessed with slick, first rate visual effects. It also starts on a fun note with Peter Parker trying to deliver pizzas with a 29 minute time limit. Alfred Molina(Raiders of the Lost Ark, Species) plays a more human version of Doctor Octopus/Doc Ock. There's an alternate version of the film known as Spiderman 2.1. It deletes the Hal Sparks cameo and has more footage of Mary Jane. The scene where Doc Ock kills the doctors and nurses echoes Sam Raimi's Evil Dead movies. The music by Danny Elfman is good. From what I've heard, there's alternate music cues in the film by different music composers. Spiderman and Doc Ock's fight on a subway train is awesome. The fight scene was staged by Hong Kong filmmaker Dion Lam. The credits from Spiderman 2 show us a recap from the first film through comic book artwork. I hope the 1970's Spiderman TV show gets released on DVD and Blu Ray. There's also the Japanese Spiderman TV show where he had a Power Rangers style robot.

After having watched it I felt it was definitely lacking many of the characteristics that made the first movie appealing.  The two main themes in this movie are Peter Parker having trouble with his powers failing and the new super-villain Doctor Octopus.Now Doc Oc was never one of my favorites but this revamping is even worse.  Pains have been taken to show Doctor Octavius as a truly good man.  Artificial intelligence has been added to his arms and an inhibitor chip to keep them under control.  But after the accident with the completely unshielded reaction the Doc falls victim to the arms.  I have to say that when one of the arms told him to rob a bank I had to wonder why he had ever programmed the arms with such knowledge.  Spider-Man has his arms full trying to stop him before the movie ends.We also have scenes of Spider-Man having trouble with his powers.  Sometimes his webs won't work and he loses strength and web-crawling abilities off and on.  But the thing that really got me was the way he pulled off his mask at every stumbling block.  By the end of the film one has to surmise that half of the city has had the chance to see who he really is.  Peter seemed completely unconcerned with protecting his identity.Mary Jane, Harry, Jonas and Aunt Mae all make their appearances and have their roles to fill with Peter bouncing around uncontrolled from one situation to another.

The original Spiderman was an amazing accomplishment, matching action and special effects with excellent storytelling.  Spiderman 2 expands on that ideal, with bigger and better special effects and a more in-depth emotional backdrop.Spiderman 2 finds our hero Peter Parker suffering from the increasing strain of leading his double life has college student Peter Parker and superhero Spiderman.  This strain can most notably be observed in his relationship with Mary Jane, who has become increasing annoyed with Peter and his apparent unreliability to be there when she needs him.  His best friend Harry Osborne is still spiteful about Peter's ""relationship"" with Spiderman, who he blames for the death of his father, the Green Goblin from the first film.This time around, Spiderman must take on Dr. Octopus, played by Alfred Molina.  Molina's performance is probably one of the most memorable for a villian.  Willem Dafoe's performance is the first film was very good but at times a bit over the top - Molina does not suffer from this drawback.  Dr. Octavius has his mechanical arms welded onto his body during a lab accident.  Soon, the arfitical intelligence that governs the arms have corrupted his mind, turning him into Dr. Octopus.  Doc Ock becomes obsessed with rebuilding his fusion reactor to create an unlimited energy source and resorts to crime in order to achieve this goal.The special effects are turned up a notch in this film thanks to it's larger budget.  The fight scenes between Spiderman and Doc Ock are more intricate and convincing.  While this makes the film more enjoyable, what really separates this film from other superhero movies is the story revolving around Peter Parker.  Unlike other films, this movie is just as good when we are watching Peter as when we are watching Spiderman.

As a fourty year plus reader of Spider-man and a film buff I was totally enthralled by the experience of viewing this film. It is a true thriller in all aspects. The character of Spider-man becomes a much more realistic human being, a little less angst and a little more real world coarseness really works. The moment where Peter Parker decides to walk away from his other persona and return to the world of meekness and academia is quite effective. His self doubt seems to wash away as he moves further away from being a hero. But it is only a temporary respite, and when the moment calls he answers fearlessly, finally accepting the twin burdens he must carry as a hero and a human being. The film has so many incredible moments that it would be useless to list them all. Suffice to say the action is astounding and the realization of Doc Ock and his terrifying tentacles of death will leave you in awe.

With the majority of the original film's cast being signed for 3 movies (according to their contracts), odds were looking good that ""Spiderman 2"" could possibly surpass the original film, in terms of box office success, story, and quality.  Well, the results did not disappoint, ""Spiderman 2"" was a sensational success with audiences, critics, and the box office.""Spiderman 2"" picks up sometime after the events of ""Spiderman"", as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to make his way through college, hold down a pizza delivery job, shoot photos for the Daily Bugle, visit his Aunt May and Mary Jane, all this while still being the hero Spiderman.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is now a Broadway star, and drops a `bombshell' on Peter, by announcing she is going to be married and that it's too late for Peter and her.  Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), continues to blame Spiderman for the death of his father Norman, which is beginning to cause a rift in his friendship with Peter, due to Peter's constantly shooting pictures of the wall-crawler.  Friendship troubles aside Harry invites Peter to meet Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist that has made revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of robotics for Oscorp.  When a mishap occurs during an experiment, even though Spiderman tried to stop the accident from occurring, Octavius' wife was killed and the semi-sentient robotic arms that Octavius had created were fused into his body.  The semi-sentient robotic arms are now slowly taking control of Octavius' mind causing him to go insane and lash out at those who have wronged him.  Now as the evil Dr. Octopus, his main focus is eliminating the one man he believes to be responsible for his current condition and his wife's death, Spiderman.The storytelling and the acting were so incredible and even more mature than expected, that the original film almost pales in comparison, and the original film was great.  ""Spiderman 2"" sets the bar even higher in terms of quality and craftsmanship, for future installments in this franchise, and other comic book movies in general.  This sequel is a definite must see for comic book fans and movie audiences in general, it contains a little something for everyone, from romance, to action, to comedy, ""Spiderman 2"" will not disappoint.

621228,A2IF5C0I5BH11F,B00005JMQW,Kala,"[13, 13]","I enjoyed the first Spider-man movie a lot... I tend to like comic book movies (though I have never read a comic book in my life - yet) and it was definitely one of the better ones I've seen.  Spider-man 2 picks up a year or so after the first one left off - he's in love with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but can't be with her as he fears his enemies will hurt her to get at him.  His best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is suffering and mourning the loss of his father - who he knows died at the hands of Spider-man (his father was the ""Green Goblin"" and the bad guy in the first Spider-man movie).  He is also suffering in school and at work because he spends so much time saving the city, he can't get to class on time.  His Aunt Mae is still mourning the loss of her husband, Peter's Uncle Ben.During the first part of the movie, one of Peter's scientist heroes, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina), is working on a fusion experiment with Harry Osborn's corporation that he hopes will change the world.  At the demonstration, however, things of course go horribly wrong and Octavious ends up with four mechanical arms stuck to him and the chip that ""controls"" their artificial intelligence breaks - so they have a mind of their own and begin to control him.  ""Doc Ock"" begins trying to rebuild his fusion machine (which could destroy half of New York City) and Spider-man sets out to stop him.Spider-man 2 spent a lot more time on character development than you normally see in a comic book/action movie.  You really feel Peter's pain as he struggles to balance being a super hero with being a regular guy.  You really feel for him, wanting so badly to be with Mary Jane, but knowing if he acts on his desires, he is knowingly putting her in harm's way.  Poor Aunt Mae is struggling still with the loss of her beloved husband and dealing with the financial aftermath his death has caused for her.  The characters and conflicts are so believable, despite the inate silliness that comes from being a comic book movie.The acting is superb as well, all the lead actors are phenomical and perfectly cast.  One of the greatest characters is J.J. Jameson (J.K. Simmons) who is Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle.  He absolutely nails the character and is hilarious throughout the movie.  Another thing the movie did really well was be funny, despite all the angst and conflict going on.  The ""elevator scene"" in particular was hysterical, as well as the scene with Peter at the laundromat.  I won't go in to detail so I don't ruin it, but suffice to say - they were funny scenes!Action scenes were once again spectacular - with amazing CGI that was a lot less obvious this time around.  My one complaint would be there was a little TOO much time spent on character development and not enough action.  The action scenes were just phenominal - I really wanted to see more!  There was also quite a lot of subtle foreshadowing, indicating a Spider-man 3.  Many future villians were introduced that most people wouldn't recognize unless they were fans of the comic.  Fortunately I had plenty of comic book loving friends with me.  Some hints - MJ's astronaut fiance, Peter's professor and Harry Osborn - all future bad guys in the comic books. ;)",5,Bring on Spider-man 3!,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,3239,"['enjoyed', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'movie', 'lot', 'tend', 'like', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'life', 'yet', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Spider-man', '2', 'picks', 'up', 'year', 'so', 'first', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'enemies', 'will', 'hurt', 'get', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'suffering', 'mourning', 'loss', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'hands', 'Spider-man', 'father', 'was', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'bad', 'guy', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'movie', 'also', 'suffering', 'school', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'saving', 'city', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'class', 'time', 'Aunt', 'Mae', 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'husband', 'Peter', 'Uncle', 'Ben.During', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'one', 'Peter', 'scientist', 'heroes', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavious', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'working', 'fusion', 'experiment', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'corporation', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'demonstration', 'however', 'things', 'course', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'Octavious', 'ends', 'up', 'four', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'stuck', 'chip', 'controls', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'breaks', 'so', 'have', 'mind', 'own', 'begin', 'control', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'fusion', 'machine', 'could', 'destroy', 'half', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Spider-man', 'out', 'stop', 'him.Spider-man', '2', 'spent', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'normally', 'see', 'comic', 'book/action', 'movie', 'really', 'feel', 'Peter', 'pain', 'balance', 'being', 'super', 'hero', 'being', 'regular', 'guy', 'really', 'feel', 'wanting', 'so', 'badly', 'be', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'knowing', 'desires', 'knowingly', 'putting', 'harm', 'way', 'Poor', 'Aunt', 'Mae', 'struggling', 'still', 'loss', 'beloved', 'husband', 'dealing', 'financial', 'aftermath', 'death', 'caused', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'inate', 'silliness', 'being', 'comic', 'book', 'movie.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'phenomical', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'One', 'greatest', 'characters', 'J.J.', 'Jameson', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'who', 'Peter', 'boss', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'absolutely', 'character', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'really', 'well', 'was', 'be', 'funny', 'angst', 'conflict', 'going', 'elevator', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'hysterical', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'Peter', 'laundromat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'suffice', 'say', 'were', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Action', 'scenes', 'were', 'once', 'again', 'spectacular', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'was', 'lot', 'less', 'obvious', 'time', 'around', 'one', 'complaint', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'little', 'TOO', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'phenominal', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'lot', 'subtle', 'foreshadowing', 'indicating', 'Spider-man', '3', 'Many', 'future', 'villians', 'were', 'introduced', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'were', 'fans', 'comic', 'Fortunately', 'had', 'plenty', 'comic', 'book', 'loving', 'friends', 'hints', 'MJ', 'astronaut', 'fiance', 'Peter', 'professor', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'future', 'bad', 'guys', 'comic', 'books']",Spider-Man 2

621231,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B00005JMQW,Kaya Savas,"[1, 2]","MOVIE: Once the opening credits begin so does a brilliant montage of the first movie done in the style of a comic book. Basically they used the opening credits as a backdrop to put in a prologue. What makes this superhero movie stand out from those before it is that it has an enormous amount of character development. What makes this different from Batman, Superman, and the upcoming Catwoman is that it's not all about the action. Sure the movie has outstanding CGI's and a train fight that rivals the trailer truck fight in Matrix Reloaded, but there is so much emotion put out through the characters. With Batman all the movie is about is kicking ass. The reason why Spider-Man is such a successful movie is that Tobey Maguire has created such a character in Peter Parker that it allows the audience to really relate to him. We aren't superheros but sometimes it feels like we need to be in order to accomplish some things in life. Also Peter Parker is a genuine character, a &quot;same as you and me&quot; type of guy. Batman's parents were murdered, Daredevil's father was murdered, but Spider-Man really has no dark past except for the murder of his Uncle. Okay maybe murders in the family do drive people to become superheros but Spider-Man is not some guy dressed in black trying to silence the pain of his past, he's just your friendly neigberhood kind of guy. What the movie lacks is some new stuff. If you think about it, it's just a deeper version of the first one. Basically the same of Parker dealing with his conflicting lives. One other thing that bothered me was all the science mumbo jumbo the filled the movie with. I kind of laughed at how Octavius described how he met his wife when she was studying English Literature and he was studying Science. Please! Overall though a new best for the genre. It's a croud pleaser with a little more depth that just an action fare.ACTING: You have to give it to the cast because without the cast they've got they would be nowhere. Alfred Molina steals the show as Dr. Octavius, his menacing Doc Ock just worked out so well. Tobey is Spider-Man, in and out, and Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely MJ Watson.

This time, ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" (Toby Maguire) faces one of his deadliest enemies Doctor Octopus, played brilliantly by Alfred Molina.The special effects are mind blowing. Rather than just witnessing the fights like in the first movie, you actually get to see what it is like to be Spider-man traveling along the skylines of New York City. And the fight scenes are as if they are ripped out of the comic panles.the plot will seem to be the same as ""Superman II"" to non comic book fans. In ""Superman II"", Superman gives up his powers to be with the woman he loves, and villians comes to town and Superman must get his powers to save the day. in ""Spider-Man 2"", Peter parker looses his powers and starts to get a meaningful relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)and Doc Oc comes to town, and Peter gets his powers back in order to save the day.Overall, it is a good movie to watch pop corn with. It has great action, drama, and even comedy in it as well. Sam Rami did a grerat job with this film, and be sure to find Sam Rami movie staple, and ""greatest B movie actor ever"", Bruce Campell.Some extras on the DVD are very good.

621233,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,B00005JMQW,Kelvin H.,"[1, 1]","Rarely has a comic-book superhero movie dealt with the hero's emotional pang more then their death defying feats. Films have exploited these superheroes as a means to put CGI into good use. ""Spider-Man"" felt like one of those. It was bland and dry and the characters skimmed on the surface of shallow. Now comes ""Spider-Man 2,"" where director Sam Raimi has focused on the internal labor and strain of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) that makes superheroes like Spiderman more complicated and in-depth. Torn between this gift and curse of having supernatural abilities with his personal agendas of wants and needs, Peter Parker is the epitome of what it takes to be a superhero, and ""Spider-Man 2"" is what comic-book movie should be.Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are the key to the emotional success of these stories. Maguire has become so good in this role that is more than just an action-movie role. We get a full scope of Maguire's ability to make Spider-Man a well-rounded character instead of a two-dimensional cartoon character. Dunst, although still in her teens, is a veteran actress that has added layers to Mary Jane. Particularly the one where she has her fianc&eacute; lie back on the couch so she can recreate that famous kiss with Spider-Man convinced me that Dunst has done a lot with her character. Franco is just as productive and even chilling because we begin to notice the menacing attributes that will eventually make him Spider-Man's next nemesis.(...)",5,"Simply a ""Marvel""",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,1488,"['Rarely', 'comic-book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'dealt', 'hero', 'emotional', 'pang', 'more', 'then', 'death', 'defying', 'feats', 'Films', 'have', 'exploited', 'superheroes', 'put', 'CGI', 'good', 'use', 'Spider-Man', 'felt', 'one', 'was', 'bland', 'dry', 'characters', 'skimmed', 'surface', 'shallow', 'Now', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'where', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'focused', 'internal', 'labor', 'strain', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'superheroes', 'Spiderman', 'more', 'complicated', 'in-depth', 'Torn', 'gift', 'curse', 'having', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'personal', 'agendas', 'needs', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'epitome', 'what', 'be', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'what', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'should', 'be.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'James', 'Franco', 'are', 'key', 'emotional', 'success', 'stories', 'Maguire', 'become', 'so', 'good', 'role', 'more', 'just', 'action-movie', 'role', 'get', 'full', 'scope', 'Maguire', 'ability', 'make', 'Spider-Man', 'well-rounded', 'character', 'instead', 'two-dimensional', 'cartoon', 'character', 'Dunst', 'still', 'teens', 'veteran', 'actress', 'added', 'layers', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Particularly', 'one', 'where', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'back', 'couch', 'can', 'recreate', 'famous', 'kiss', 'Spider-Man', 'convinced', 'Dunst', 'done', 'lot', 'character', 'Franco', 'just', 'productive', 'even', 'chilling', 'begin', 'notice', 'menacing', 'will', 'eventually', 'make', 'Spider-Man', 'next', 'nemesis.']",Spider-Man 2
621234,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JMQW,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 8]","SPIDERMAN continues the Spiderman saga as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) tries to juggle his responsibilities as a superhero and as a student at Columbia University trying to pay his rent and attend his classes. Things are not easy, to say the least---especially when a new villain arrives, in the form of Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), endowed with four cyber-intelligent tentacles that force him to continue with experiments that could put Manhattan in mortal danger. And of course Peter still has a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still has a vendetta against Spiderman for the murder of his father.Peter Parker feels the great burden of his responsibilities, and the ways in which he tries to deal with it is part of what makes SPIDERMAN a worthy sequel to the 2001 original. SPIDERMAN was a good genre film because, through all the special effects and action scenes, director Sam Raimi never lost track of the human element, never allowed the film to sink into a brainless action spectacle. Peter Parker the character is fully given his due, and there is a wonderful authenticity to the film's emotions-nothing artificially heightened or manipulative. SPIDERMAN 2 is emotionally richer than the original, and that is quite an accomplishment for a sequel. Even better, the special effects are slightly more convincing than they were in the first film, and there are some bravura action scenes---particularly one in which Spiderman has to use all his power to stop a moving train---that equal the best of any superhero epic.One would be hard-pressed to think of anyone else that could have played Spiderman as convincingly as Tobey Maguire does in both films. He never expresses emotions through attention-grabbing gestures, but always stays in character beautifully. The other performances are good, but Maguire helps take the film to a higher level. SPIDERMAN 2 is a great sequel, a worthy superhero movie, and terrific entertainment.

621236,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JMQW,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","""Spider-Man 2"" is one of the best sequels around.  Unlike many people, I don't think that it is any better than the first film, it just deals with a little tougher material.  In this go-round, Spidey is finding it hard to deal with the fact that he is living two lives.  It's so hard, in fact, that it's affecting his performance(in real life and as the Wallcrawler).  Basically, his whole life is a mess.  He's lost his girl, his best friend, and a mentor(Dr. Octavius) loses his mind.  The film pans out as our hero tries to figure out exactly what's going on inside of himself and how can he juggle being normal and a hero at the same time.The action in this film is second to none.  It is the one aspect of the film that I believe is better than the original film.  Spidey and Doc Ock beat the hell out of each other in all of their confrontations.  Unlike the first movie, where the Green Goblin let Spidey go to mull things over, Ock fights until either one of the duo gives up or gets preoccupied by something else.  There is some brilliant action in this flick.The acting is brilliant as well.  Alfred Molina makes you love Doc Ock from the get-go.  Then you want to feel sorry for his tormented soul.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have good chemistry on screen.  The standout performance, though, is from James Franco, who reprises his role as Harry Osbourne.  He begins the film in the same way that he ended the original--angry at Spidey for murdering his father.  As the movie progresses, he plummets into vengeful insanity, leaving things wide open for Spidey 3.  His acting seems to have grown since the filming of the first movie.  Let's hope he keeps it up.  He may have a bright career ahead of him.The special effects were good.  There's more of Spidey swinging between buildings.  Sam Raimi has really captured the essence of Spider-Man, and I hope he stays on to do more sequels.Highly recommended.

621239,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JMQW,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 6]","The sequel to Spider-Man brings the audience to where the first film left off through a brief sketched review of the first film during the opening credits, which is rather cool.  Quickly the film jumps into action as Spider-Man a.k.a. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) must save the day as he struggles to keep his job as a pizza delivery boy while maintaining good status as a science student at Columbia University.  This is a difficult balancing act for Parker who also works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle where the owner, J. J. Jameson, does everything possible to make life sour for Spider-Man.  Moreover, the most difficult issue for Parker to tackle is what his uncle once taught him, ""with great powers comes great responsibility"", as he must withstand his love for Mary Jane in order to protect her from his enemies.The balancing act performed by Parker is catching up with him as it causes him great stress, which in the end begins to negatively influence his life.  Parker's grades are slipping, as he must write a paper, which he has decideds to write on Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina), a prominent physicist.  It happens to be that Dr. Octavius works for Harry Osborn (James Franco), Parker's friend and father of the late Green Goblin, as he is developing fusion in order to provide the world with free electricity.  However, the experiment goes wrong and it creates the monster Dr. Octopus, which soon becomes Spider-Man's new archenemy.Internally Parker struggles with what most people face everyday, choices and the stress brought upon him through his choices, as they influence those around him.  However, his choices have a slightly grander influence on people as he saves lives and fights against evil.  Parker also envies the normality of humanity, which he feels that he cannot have, as he must use his great powers responsibly.  This struggle produces an overburden of stress and seems to weaken him in all aspects of life, as he also finds himself pushing away the people for which he cares.Spider-Man is a roller coaster that brings the audience through the high and lows of Parker's life, as he struggles with his existential identity.  The director Sam Raimi projects this internal struggle onto the silver screen through popular psychology and a heavy dose of scripted dialogue, which is at times a little awkward.  The method in which Raimi portrays Parker's difficult position in life comes across to the audience a little too straightforward.  This straightforwardness makes the internal struggle seem slightly absurd, much like our contemporary pop culture's need for instant gratification.  The notion of instant gratification ushers thoughts to ponder that the making of Spider-Man 2 was hastened, as the film does not leave anything for the audience to ponder.  However, Spider-Man is a superhero and it is expected that he will win as he brings his justice to evil.  Nonetheless, it is intriguing to see Raimi depict the human side of Parker.Sam Raimi does a great job telling the story of Parker and his endeavors as he goes about to find a solution to his problems.

Jump,"[3, 4]","Following up on a successful film--especially a runaway blockbuster like the original SPIDER-MAN--is always a risky undertaking, and one which frequently falls flat. Fortunately director Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and company are up to the challenge in SPIDER-MAN 2, the rare sequel to live up to its predecessor. When ambitious scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into a metal-tentacled man-monster in an experiment gone awry, even J. Jonah Jameson knows Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Or can he? And as if the rampaging Doctor Octopus isn't enough, everyone's favoite Wallcrawler must also contend with the generally grisly ups and downs of everyday existence as he struggles in vain to hold together something resembling a normal life as Peter Parker: his grades are slipping, he can't hold on to a job, best friend Norman Osborne obsesses over Spider-Man's demise, he's on the brink of losing Mary Jane forever to no less than Jonah Jameson's son, and even his relationship with his beloved Aunt May suffers. It's all enough to make even a hero consider throwing in the towel. But if Peter Parker isn't Spider-Man, then who is he?This is a tremendously exciting movie, with great stunts and special effects and the battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are a wonder to behold. But like the first Spider-Man flick, the sequel goes beyond the action and spends a lot of important time building characterization with all the leads. The characters in this movie are not just punching bags. They are real people with real-world problems and there are no easy answers. The script is literate and well-crafted, with the theme of identity/self-discovery skillfully interwoven throughout. Though it is a much more serious film than many comic-book adaptations, there is some nice comic relief and the sense of wonder never wavers.One reason for the success of the Spider-Man films is great casting. Tobey Maquire is of course letter-perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, capturing the essence of the iconic Everyman superhero flawlessly. Kirsten Dunst is an excellent Mary Jane as well, and in some ways her portrayal of the character is more likeable than the one in the comic book. And Alfred Molina hits Doc Ock dead-on, bringing one of comicdom's great villains to devastating life just as effectively as Willem Dafoe did the Green Goblin. Many forget that for several years Doctor Octopus was Spider-Man's number-one enemy dating back to Spider-Man #3, when Doc Ock was the fist villain to beat Spider-Man head-to-head (temporarily, of course), but no one will doubt his status in Spider-Man's rogues' gallery after seeing this movie!The only real complaint I have with this film is that Doctor Octopus's character is drawn much more sympathetically than in the source comic, though his personal crisis does parallel Peter Parker's own quite nicely.Whether or not it's equal or better to the original in every respect, SPIDER-MAN 2 is highly entertaining cinema that most fans will love. The adventure, drama, and romance are all exceptionally well-done, and SPIDER-MAN 2 is certainly one of the best superhero movies ever made.",4,SPIDER-MAN SWINGS BACK INTO ACTION!,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,3161,"['Following', 'up', 'successful', 'film', 'especially', 'runaway', 'blockbuster', 'original', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'always', 'risky', 'undertaking', 'one', 'frequently', 'flat', 'Fortunately', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'company', 'are', 'up', 'challenge', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'rare', 'sequel', 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'When', 'ambitious', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'transformed', 'metal-tentacled', 'man-monster', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'even', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'Spider-Man', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'stop', 'can', 'rampaging', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', ""n't"", 'enough', 'everyone', 'favoite', 'Wallcrawler', 'must', 'also', 'contend', 'generally', 'grisly', 'ups', 'downs', 'everyday', 'existence', 'vain', 'hold', 'together', 'something', 'resembling', 'normal', 'life', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'grades', 'are', 'slipping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'job', 'best', 'friend', 'Norman', 'Osborne', 'Spider-Man', 'demise', 'brink', 'losing', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'forever', 'less', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'son', 'even', 'relationship', 'beloved', 'Aunt', 'May', 'suffers', 'enough', 'make', 'even', 'hero', 'consider', 'throwing', 'towel', 'Peter', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'Spider-Man', 'then', 'who', 'tremendously', 'exciting', 'movie', 'great', 'stunts', 'special', 'effects', 'battles', 'Spider-Man', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'are', 'wonder', 'behold', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'flick', 'sequel', 'action', 'lot', 'important', 'time', 'building', 'characterization', 'leads', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'punching', 'bags', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real-world', 'problems', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'script', 'literate', 'well-crafted', 'theme', 'identity/self-discovery', 'skillfully', 'interwoven', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'film', 'many', 'comic-book', 'adaptations', 'nice', 'comic', 'relief', 'sense', 'wonder', 'never', 'reason', 'success', 'Spider-Man', 'films', 'great', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'Maquire', 'course', 'letter-perfect', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spider-Man', 'capturing', 'essence', 'iconic', 'Everyman', 'superhero', 'flawlessly', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'excellent', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'as', 'well', 'ways', 'portrayal', 'character', 'more', 'likeable', 'one', 'comic', 'book', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'dead-on', 'bringing', 'one', 'comicdom', 'great', 'villains', 'devastating', 'life', 'just', 'as', 'effectively', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'did', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Many', 'forget', 'several', 'years', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'was', 'Spider-Man', 'number-one', 'enemy', 'dating', 'back', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'when', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'was', 'fist', 'villain', 'beat', 'Spider-Man', 'head-to-head', 'temporarily', 'course', 'one', 'will', 'doubt', 'status', 'Spider-Man', 'rogues', 'gallery', 'seeing', 'movie', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'character', 'drawn', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetically', 'source', 'comic', 'personal', 'crisis', 'parallel', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'own', 'quite', 'nicely.Whether', 'not', 'equal', 'better', 'original', 'respect', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'cinema', 'most', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'adventure', 'drama', 'romance', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well-done', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'made']",Spider-Man 2

Director Sam Raimi, Screenwriter Alvin Sargent, and the Spider-Man Producers all seem to appreciate this fact. Following the runaway success, both critically and commercially, of the original film, in Spider-Man 2 they have expertly crafted an exciting action film, with surprising depth. As Raimi and Sargent have chosen to focus on their characters and story as much as the amazing SFX and action sequences, the end result is a plot-driven, roller-coaster ride filled with action, suspense, drama, and romance.The very talented and creative Stan Lee created Spider-Man for Marvel Comics. (Lee is also responsible for the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron Man, and the Hulk). Spider-Man made his debut in 1962 in a comic book series - Amazing Fantasy 15. Spider-Man was immediately popular, and the series was quickly renamed Amazing Spider-Man. Indeed, the growing popularity of Spider-Man helped Marvel Comics to become the dominant comic-book publisher by the early 1970s.In 2002, Spider-Man: The Motion Picture came to the big screen. With a cumulative box office gross of over $US800 million, Spider-Man happily sits in the Top 10 of all-time box-office films. Apart from its great commercial success, Spider-Man was also warmly greeted by critics and comic-book fans alike.A long-time Spider-Man fan, Raimi, and star Tobey Maguire had both contracted for three Spider-Man films (before the script for the first one was even written), so following the success of the first film, sequels were inevitable.Thus, the arrival of Spider-Man 2 was not a surprise. Spider-Man 2 also earning a place in the all-time Top Ten Box Office films was also not a surprise. The amazing CGI, visual effects and SFX generally in the sequel were not a surprise. Furthermore, the breath-taking stunts and gripping action set pieces were not a surprise either. What was surprising about Spider-Man 2 was the depth of the story and characters.What I, and I imagine most people, love about Peter Parker/Spider-Man is that despite being a super hero, he is spared none of the problems of ordinary life: He has ups and downs with his friends, family, and employers. He struggles to get or keep a girlfriend. He gets sick and he definitely gets tired. A bit of a geek, he's ""intelligent but lazy"". A genuine nice guy, with a good sense of humour. Indeed, he's often referred to as ""your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man"". Peter's an ordinary young bloke, with an amazing gif, which he chooses, with great responsibility, to use for the good of humanity.In Spider-Man 2 we find Peter (Tobey Maguire) at the end of his tether. He's struggling to hold on to his job, pay the rent, and pass his exams. Furthermore, he seems to be losing his Spider-Man powers. And, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is engaged to another man. To make matter worse, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and is seeking revenge, and Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be kicked out of her house.A strong theme in Spider-Man 2 is choice: Consumed by insecurity and inner turmoil, the strain of being a super-hero permanently on call is taking its toll. Peter's secret identity is a weight on his shoulders that he no longer wishes to bear. Peter must choose between what he wants to do and what he feels he must do.Instead of creating a stand-alone film, Raimi has opted to further explore the characters and relationships he set up in the first film. All the main characters in Spider-Man 2 have dreams: Peter dreams of an ordinary life where he can pursue his love for Mary Jane, and his love of science and photography; Mary Jane dreams of success as an actress, and of being happily married; and Dr. Otto Octavius dreams of creating a new energy source through fusion. And this brings us to our villain . . .Every hero is measured by their nemesis, the villain, and unlike the Hulk, Spider-Man 2 is not all soul-searching. Dr. Otto Octavius (a wonderfully restrained and subtle performance by Alfred Molina) is a good-hearted and genius scientific researcher, working for Oscorp. Peter admires Octavius, just as he did Norman Osborn (before Osborn became the Green Goblin). Octavius dreams of creating cheap renewable electricity through fusion. Tragically, his fusion experiment goes horribly wrong, killing Octavius' devoted wife, and leaving him with four robotic tentacles (""actuators"") fused into his spinal cord. The evil AI of the actuators soon begin controlling Octavius, and the mild mannered scientist degenerates into Doc Oct, a cruel, selfish man, driven by vengeance, and hell-bent on achieving his fusion dream no matter what the costs.As for the DVD,the quality of the movie and its transfer, and the breadth of extras, easily make this one of the best DVD releases of 2004.",4,A visual

Peter is something of a lost soul, living in a dump, forever in debt, habitually late to class, and losing jobs quicker than you can say, ""Pizza Time!"" - all the while moonlighting as New York City's greatest crime fighting hero.  He's also hopelessly in love with actress Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but unable to tell her due to his Spider-Man responsibilities and the fact that he's the shyest and most naive young man ever.  Enter Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), a scientist who has discovered a new and very dangerous form of energy - which goes horribly wrong and changes him into an evil monster, complete with four super-strong metal arms.  He conspires with the late Green Goblin's son (James Franco) to kidnap Mary Jane and destroy Spider-Man!Tobey Maguire gives Spider-Man a very real, EveryGuy face; an average-Joe who doesn't have all the answers (except when he's wearing that red and blue suit), but does have lots of problems and insecurities.  Maguire, with his puppy dog face and endearing lisp, is the boy you'd like to take you to the prom (or adopt, depending on your age).  Kirsten Dunst is suitably wholesome and perky as his love-interest, and Alfred Molina is just right as the creepy and campy arch villain.

The cinematography by Bill Pope, who did the cinematography to all 3 of the Matrix movies and ""Bound"" (1996) all which were directed by the Wachowski Brothers, and whose cinematography debut was Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"" (1990), he also did the cinematography to Raimi's ""Army Of Darkness"" (1993) the finale in the Evil Dead series, does a brilliant job photographing this movie. The film editing by Bob Murawski (who edited Raimi's original ""Spider-Man"" (2002), ""The Gift"" (2000) & ""Army Of Darkness"" (1993) is brilliant. The casting by Dianne Crittenden is excellent.

But every know and then, surprisingly impressive part 2 comes along and wows audiences, scoops box-office success and critical acclaim. SUPERMAN, BATMAN and X-MEN et all have superior sequels. SPIDER-MAN 2 is no exception. A more fleshed-out story, deeper emotion and most importantly, fast-paced action (The train scene is incredible) work to fantastic effect. Director Sam Raimi has not only created a fantastic piece of action cinema, but also cemented the idea that sequels can outshine their lofty parents.Returning to New York two years after the last one left off, SPIDER-MAN 2 sees Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) strain under the pressure of trying to balance a romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), his job at the Daily Bugle, college, fighting crime and trying to retain a sense of normality. And after a scientific accident, face off against Doc Ock, which provides for some fantastic action.Maguire and Dunst show real chemistry and great angst as the tow troubled friends, however Alfred Molina's Dr.Otto Octavius is absolutely brilliant, and the computer-generated interaction with live action elements is seamless. Themes of friendship and self-sacrifice are well-written, and despite the genre, the story is firmly set in reality, paving the way for much easier writing, and thankfully, no cheese.Some shaky dialogue and fairly heavy exposition didn't matter much in the first movie, and here-What can I say? An absolutely magnificent masterpiece that deserves all the box -office success and critical praise it is currently receiving.I knew straight away after watching the previews that under Rami's steady hand, and having as much experience as you could possibly have with the comic-book ideas, that this would be something special. Much akin to Brian Singer's X-MEN 2, second time around a strong layer of confidence is evident, eschewing the fairly everyday filmmaking of Part 1 in favor of an experimental and kinetic style.Much praise must go to those CGI effects boffins who sure had an immense job on their hands. The CG Spider-Man is a vast improvement. However given Raimi's track record for a fantastic storytelling style, it must be a gift to collaborate with people who understand the language of film so fluently. Danny Elfman's visceral score adds so much to the film's tone. Doc Ock's theme is an outstanding achievement, building on it's earlier subtle strings, slowly working up to a full-bore orchestra, amping up the film's biggest action set-pieces.If the first SPIDER-MAN was set-up, this is the payoff. However by the end credits, we all know we'll be eagerly-awaiting round 3.

I knew what happened in the first film already! (Two Towers seemlessly continued The Fellowship.) A different SM comic would have been more interesting to read. Maybe something filling in the gaps between SM1 and SM2?? That might even make the DVD credits worth freeze-framing to reveal added details (like in the Def Leppard music video of 'Women'), but there was nothing new that I could see... Will we have a 25 minute comic intro to SM3?The tie-in linking Doc Oc to Harry was great! It was well done and molded with the larger (multi-film) plot incredibly well. Although maybe a bit too much fore-shadow to the next movie.Not a tie-in per se, PP losing his powers was a bit silly and strung out a bit to long.The mini tie-ins, ie. The &quot;Spidey Singer&quot; and the &quot;New Yorkers stick together&quot; theme, underscored from the first film were okay, because they were very short. But kinda reminded me of the tireless repetition between Austin Powers 1&2.Finally, The tie-in of MJ to JJJ's son was just too much. Many alternatives could have been used to give JJJ more screen time. I thought it was a bit TOO convenient, too much of a coincidence. I suppose it could create more conflict if PP ends up breaking up MJ and JJJ Jr. next movie or something, and JJJ hates him for it, but still needs his pix. (sort of a lame subplot though).

As the years went by and the cartoon series got older( around the end of the 80's), it began to lose it's touch. I was hoping Sony would make this movie more like the 50's cartoons instead of the first one but it looks like they went there own way. What's the problem? Tobey Maguire can't act, the villain is laughable(wach the ending), you don't care about Maguire and Dunst relationship, not enough Spidey action, and you spend half the film laughing at Tobey Maguire facial exspressions(wach the train seane!!!!). Dunst is the ONLY good person at acting, well, the guy who played the villain was good to, but besids that, no one can act. I was hoping we would get a better film from the guy who made Evil Dead and Darkman. oh well, I guess every one has there flops.

621264,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JMQW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[106, 132]","&quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; is the best comic book superhero movie made to date, and not simply by default.  The story and screenplay come from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar (co-creators of &quot;Smallville&quot;), Michael Chabon (author of &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;), and Alvin Sargent (Oscar winner for &quot;Julia&quot; and &quot;Ordinary People&quot;), and more than any other film in this genre it is true to the character and what made him Marvel Comics' most popular superhero in the 1960s.  I teach a unit on Spider-Man in my Pop Culture class where we compare the original Stan Lee &amp; Steve Ditko stories to what is being published today and my students have to deal with the key elements of the comic book.  This time around Sam Raimi has those elements nailed big time.The story picks up two years after the first film, which is reprised through artwork by Alex Ross during the title sequences.  Peter (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, working a part time job, fighting crime, and generally making a mess of everything.  Being Spider-Man is a burden and it is beating Peter Parker down.  He loses his job, his grades are slipping, and even his powers seem to be leaving him.  He still loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but all he can envision is a life where his enemies would threaten her life and he has to endure seeing her picture on billboards and posters all over New York City.  It becomes clear that our hero is coming to a cross-roads in his life, but we have no idea what will be the final straw, as it could be anything from the bank foreclosing on the house of Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) or Dr. Curt Connors (Dylan Baker) flunking him to J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) really firing him from the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; to Mary Jane ending up with some other guy (Daniel Gillies).What made Spider-Man endearing was that he was the victim of such bad luck.  With power comes great responsibility but you would think a guy could catch a break now and then.  There is a point where a bruised Peter tries to make his way home and as he reaches out to steady himself against a parked car you KNOW that as soon as he touches it a car alarm goes off.  Spider-Man endures a lot of slings and arrows in this film (e.g., Aunt May never told him how to do laundry) and all the while the gods just look down and laugh.The Green Goblin was something of the ultimate villain for Spider-Man because he was the one who learned the web-slinger's secret identity.  But the consensus of my students each semester is that Doctor Octopus is the best Spider-Man villain.  Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) intends to make nuclear fusion work and is employed by Harry Osborn (James Franco), who dreams of making a fortune during the day and of killing Spider-Man to avenge his father at night.  Of course things go horribly wrong, and the four metal tentacles that Octavius has created are now fused to his body and have driven him insane.We have all seen the trailer for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and the scene where Doc Ock interupts a potentially tender moment between Peter and Mary Jane by throwing a car through a window at them.  This must happen over an hour into the film but it starts off a series of fantastic computer generated fights between the hero and the villain.  The reason for this and why the pairing is so perfect is that Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus can both fight on the vertical axis as well as the horizontal.  These two go at each other on the side of buildings and falling through the air as well as on top, on the sides, and through the middle of a subway train.  Then you throw into the mix that Doc Ock can be carrying off someone Peter loves and still have three mechanical arms pounding away at Spider-Man.  More importantly, when Spider-Man travels around by his webbing in this film it no longer looks like something we would expect from a Saturday morning cartoon.But the conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus is only one of a half dozen that provide the interpersonal web of problems closing in on Peter and the way they all fit together gives &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; a weight hitherto unsuspected in superhero movies.  This point is best evidence by the fact that Aunt May is major supporting character in the film just as she is in the comic book.  There were always two women in Peter Parker's life and the one constant was always Aunt May.I applaud the decision to make Otto Octavius a good man for once who becomes the victim of his own brilliance.  His scientific discussions with Peter in their first meeting not only show his decency but also reveal to our hero the path he can take if he pursues science rather than crime fighting.  After all, Otto is married to the lovely Rosalie (Donna Murphy), who is clearly the doctor's own MJ.  Eventually Peter comes to the realization that he does not have to be Spider-Man.I have some ambivalence about what is happening with Mary Jane, mainly because one of my favorite scenes in the comic book was when she finally confessed to a stunned Peter that she knew he was Spider-Man and could no longer stand the fear that he was going to get killed.  But I appreciate the idea that Mary Jane gets to be there from the beginning in the movies (as she is in Marvel's &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;) and that Hollywood does not have time to go through Betty Brant and Gwen Stacy to get to Mary Jane Watson Parker and the final shot of Mary Jane in the film certainly gives weight to her character and reinforces again the idea that this time they got everything right.",5,By far the best comic book superhero movie ever made,1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,5567,"['quot', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'quot', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'movie', 'made',

If Peter Parker were like this in real life, he'd be on Zoloft and would have ulcers from all the worry going on inside his head. I can only hope that young people today aren't going through near as much turmoil as Peter Parker or his love-interest. Both of them are sad. Just very, very sad.And Doc-Oct? I liked him and thought that did a real disservice to him by giving him such small content to work with. And what a lame storyline! The man created a machine that equals the power of the sun and then it's completely destroyed by simply drowning it? Nothing blown up? No waves of mass destruction? It's the POWER OF THE SUN, for goodness sakes! That storyline had the same effect as placing the tip of a lit match into a small pool of water. How stupid!Where was the action?

621273,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JMQW,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[4, 4]","""Spider-Man"" was one of the best superhero movies ever made; perhaps somewhat short of movies such as ""Superman"" and ""Batman,"" but worthy of being grouped with these two movies.  ""Spider-Man 2"" is even better than ""Spider-Man"" and raises the superhero movie bar.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, trying to hold a part time job as a pizza delivery boy while also being a superhero and still taking the occasional photograph for J. Jonah Jameson (played to perfection by J.K. Simmons).  Threaded through all this is his deep love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately Peter is failing at nearly everything, even the superhero part.  Because Peter feels as though he must be a superhero first, he often delivers pizza late.  He is often late to class, and he still is unable to tell Mary Jane that he loves her.  To add insult to injury, Peter's powers are on the fritz from all the stress he is under.  In short, Peter's life is a disaster in slow motion.In addition to all the other stress Peter is under, Aunt May is being forced to move from her home.  Perhaps the single biggest reason for that is the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), which was partially Peter's fault and for which he continues to feel guilt.Peter is getting near a low when he goes to a demonstration by Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) of a new technique for creating fusion.  As part of his technique, Dr. Octavius has created a unique set of arms that allow him to directly manipulate the fusion process.  The arms have their own built in artificial intelligence that will enable Dr. Octavius to more easily control them.  Dr. Octavius is asked how he will keep the artificial intelligence (AI) from controlling him once the arms tap into his nervous system.  He explains that there is a specially designed chip that blocks the AI from taking over his brain.Dr. Octavius begins the experiment, which goes horribly awry, killing his wife Rosalie (Donna Murphy), and nearly killing Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was saved, barely, by Spider-Man.  However, Harry still hates Spider-Man and what he did to his father Norman Osborn, aka Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), and once the AI arms take over Dr. Octavius's brain, Harry agrees to provide Doc Ock, aka Dr. Octopus (his new improved name with the extra limbs), with tritium in exchange for Doc Ock bringing Spider-Man to him.  The reason that Doc Ock needs the tritium is to create another fusion generator.  Unfortunately, the fusion generator needs a lot more perfection, and if he succeeds the design has the potential of destroying far more than the city.As you can perceive, there is a significant amount of complexity in this movie.  However, Director Sam Raimi manages to keep the elements coherent and believable.  While there was a point where I wondered how much lower Peter Parker could go before losing it all together, and I started to get a little frustrated with the constant depression he faced, the deep angst provided an excellent contrast as Peter slowly overcame his problems.  It is the depth of character development that makes this movie different from ""Superman"" and ""Batman.""  While ""Superman"" touched on Clark Kent's difficulties in being a person as well as a superhero, the focus of the movie was on his powers.  ""Batman"" did a much better job of character development, but even then the principal focus was on the one event in Bruce Wayne's life that caused him to become the Batman.In ""Spider-Man 2"" we see someone a lot like us, a person that has not only bad days, but perhaps bad years, where nothing seems to go right.  But we also see Spider-Man figuratively pick himself up, mentally challenge himself to overcome his problems, and do exactly that.  While Peter's life will never be perfect, for a superhero and a human, it may be somewhat normal.I am typically ambivalent regarding special feature versions on DVD that contain two discs because the second disc is often not worth the price.  However, in the case of this release there are a number of interesting features worth watching for those who appreciate the technology behind the special effects.  I was particularly fascinated by how the Dr. Octopus's arms were animated.  The blooper reel (which had a few funny moments but also had a number of not-so-funny moments) showed Alfred Molina trying to take a drink provided by one of his mechanical arms; a good trick once perfected sufficiently to appear in the movie.  There are numerous other features to show how some of the more interesting effects were created.Historically, it has been difficult to bring comic book heroes to life.  Technology has been one of the biggest barriers, and has made it easier to create animated characters than live characters.  Now that technology has overcome much of that hurdle, the next difficulty is to make the characters human.  This movie has focused significant effort on developing Peter Parker as a young adult with all the normal problems of a young adult, with the added difficulty of being a superhero.  While some may cringe at how real life is for Peter, with the incredible angst created by all his problems, others will applaud the excellent translation from modern comics to the big screen.  Tobey Maguire, Sam Raimi, and the excellent supporting cast have made Spider-Man seem real.  In the process of making Spider-Man real they have also created a sequel greater than the original, and created a movie worthy of joining ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" was a landmark superhero movie that is destined to become a classic.",5,Angst so thick you could cut it with a knife,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,5577,"['Spider-Man', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'made',

I think the plot suffered because there really isn't a real story here. All the main characters and even the minor ones appears to be very confused about themselves. Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire proves to such a loser in civilian life, it almost pathetic. Peter Parker spent much of this movie confused about whether he wants to be Spider-Man or not. I supposes that is why he make such a good Spiderman. Kristen Dunst plays Mary Ann Watson proves to be beautiful but she's confused throughout the movie on whether she loves Peter or the other guy. James Franco who played Harry Osborn still regards Peter as his best buddy but regards him with hostility because he thinks Peter is buddy with Spider-Man. This character is totally twisted all over. Alfred Molina who played the main villian, Dr. Octopus, is pretty good. But he too, like the other characters, remains confused on whether he wants to be good or bad.  Even Jonah Jameson goes from anti-Spider-Man to pro-Spider-Man and back again. The entire movie appears to be populated with very confused characters.What works is the special effects, action scenes and interaction between our confused characters. For a guy who likes to keep his secret identity secret, Toby Maguire's character spent a lot of time wearing that costume without his mask on. Why cheapen the character by showing us the actor's face all the time?? (Does Sam Raimi believed that Toby Maguire is so handsome that his face deserves more exposure??)

Is the film a PERFECT adaptation of the comics? That's up for debate. But, I certainly wouldn't change this film in any way.Along with a wonderful supporting cast, I love the acting from Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire as the leading characters, Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson. They have real chemistry, despite the intense anger and apprehension their characters are feeling toward each other. If you remember the end of the original film, Peter left MJ, standing in a cemetery, hurt and rejected and very confused. She has every right to be angry with him. However, Peter Parker is still Spider-Man. He's still the most honest, decent young hero the world could ever ask for. An audience can't help but be drawn to someone who is so good, especially when that person is being treated as badly as Peter is treated by his peers in Spider-Man 2.I also love the writing. Spoiler alert: Just when the future of Peter and Mary Jane's relationship is in doubt, she leaves J. Jonah Jameson's son at the altar to go to our hero, running through New York in her wedding gown. She stands in his doorway. She tells him, ""I've always been standing in your doorway."" She tells him, ""I know there will be risks, but I want to face them with you.""

621282,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005JMQW,magellan,"[0, 0]","I thought this was a great sequel to the original Spiderman. Here Spidey fights an implaccable foe (aren't all comic-book foes implaccable?) who himself has spiderlike, bionic arms, and sometimes he's more than a match for Spidey himself. As if that weren't bad enough, Spidey develops a confidence problem when his web-making ability inexplicably fails him on several occasions. Now he doesn't know if it'll fail him at a critical moment, and yet he must still stop the obsessed Dr. Octavius and get Mary Jane back.The action sequences are great with terrific special effects, and the romantic relationship between Spiderman and Mary Jane also gets developed much more than in the previous movie. I think the strong characterization and more ""intimate"" story line, in its concentrating on a few appealing characters, was an important part of the success of the first three Star Wars movies. Lucas got away from that approach in the two recent prequels, concentrating more on the big, epic battle scenes and special effects, and so the two prequels just didn't grab me as much as the earlier movies, or these two Spiderman movies. (And I say that as an old Star Wars fan from way back). So don't miss this great sequel, and let Spidey snare you in another fun-filled and action-packed web of suspense and adventure.",5,Great follow-up,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,1315,"['thought', 'was', 'great', 'sequel', 'original', 'Spiderman', 'Here', 'Spidey', 'fights', 'implaccable', 'foe', 'are', ""n't"", 'comic-book', 'foes', 'implaccable', 'who', 'spiderlike', 'bionic', 'arms', 'sometimes', 'more', 'match', 'Spidey', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Spidey', 'confidence', 'problem', 'when', 'web-making', 'ability', 'inexplicably', 'several', 'occasions', 'Now', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'fail', 'critical', 'moment', 'yet', 'must', 'still', 'stop', 'obsessed', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'get', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'great', 'terrific', 'special', 'effects', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Spiderman', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'also', 'developed', 'much', 'more', 'previous', 'movie', 'think', 'strong', 'characterization', 'more', 'intimate', 'story', 'line', 'concentrating', 'few', 'appealing', 'characters', 'was', 'important', 'part', 'success', 'first', 'three', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'Lucas', 'got', 'away', 'approach', 'two', 'recent', 'prequels', 'concentrating', 'more', 'big', 'epic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'two', 'prequels', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'as', 'much', 'earlier', 'movies', 'two', 'Spiderman', 'movies', 'say', 'old', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fan', 'way', 'back', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'great', 'sequel', 'let', 'Spidey', 'snare', 'fun-filled', 'action-packed', 'web', 'suspense', 'adventure']",Spider-Man 2
621283,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B00005JMQW,"Maine Writer ""David""","[5, 6]","The first sequel to out and out blow away its predecessor, Spider-Man 2 is a joyous, sometimes poignant, and never boring--not even close to boring--tale of redemption, adventure, sacrifice, and ordinary people coping with extraordinary events.  But more than that, it is a triumphant return to the spirit of Marvel's comics--indeed, it is, in the very best sense, the high art of Marvel's best comics brought to life.Don't get me wrong.  It isn't that deep--but it's more than deep enough, with some moments of honesty and depth that were surprising and satisfying.  Tobey Maguire is the perfect Spider-Man--likable, funny, and much more complex than the average superhero.  The movie puts him at the lowest point imaginable.  Just when you think his life couldn't get worse, it gets dramatically worse.  And so we get to watch this young man lift himself up by his costume and face extraordinary tests of will and self-sacrifice, all of which is done in a light enough way that you never feel preached to or torn out of the story.  All of it is pulled together by a great villain--Doc Ock, more than brought to life by Alfred Molina--extraordinary battles, and a romantic quadrangle that waits until the very last moment to reveal a satisfying, yet touching resolution.Bring on Venom!",5,Oh hell.

621285,A1EWKXSKBU42MG,B00005JMQW,Manny,"[1, 1]","He's back!! The Webbed Wonder returns to DVD and even better than part one. I'm always cautious to purchase a sequel to any movie because it seems that movie companies take advantage of the success to the first part, and  in haste release junk.The Exorcist part II immediately comes to mind. With this said, I am please to inform all you ""Spidey Fans"" that this sequel is definitely worth purchasing. Packed with action, great special effects, and (for those who like love stories) a nice continuation of part one.Part II features all the main characters  who survived part I with the original cast playing their part plus a new and a more formidable foe for Spidey ""Dr. Octo"".Peter Parker finds himself torn between the obligation to do good for society, his burning desire to show his love for M.J. and telling her the truth about who he really is, and  his desire to keep his friendship with his best friend Harry ( the Green Goblin's son). Harry meanwhile is determined to find Spiderman and avenge his father's death ,not knowing who Spider Man really is.I'm not one to enjoy sappy story line, but after seeing Spidey II, I must say that the story of M.J. and Peter Parker was nicely presented to the viewer without taking away from the purpose of the movie, which is, blow away the audience with great special effects.Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kriten Dunst (M.J.) do a wonderful job of convincing their audience of their undeniable love for each other while Peter can only keep his love for M.J. to himself,  which is something most of us can relate to from our own experiences. With all these personal decisions that Spiderman has to juggle with, he learns that, whatever direction he takes will have an impact on his spider powers.Spiderman effectively touches base on the definition of what a true Hero really is which is important for youngsters of today's society.Spider Man II is a Nicely told story with tons of action and great special effects that in my opinion surpasses part I. Viewers will not be disappointed with this sequel.This set comes with lots of special features that include, Bloopers, The making of the movie, Trivia , Documentary on the newest Villain, multi angle look into one of the most exciting scenes of the movie, and much more.Spiderman II is available in 3 different technical/visual formats, widescreen , full screen with 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound, and Superbit with 5.1 DTS availability. So be sure that the set you buy is compatible with your system. Though my DVD is not in DTS audio, the Dolby sound is excellent. The picture quality is unsurpassed as well as the special effects, though there are some parts that are not so convincing.Overall this release has Lots of action, lots of special effects, nice story,  so don't just sit there, go out and buy this DVD.You won't be disappointed!!!",5,The Webbed Wonder Returns,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",2004,2841,"['back', 'Webbed', 'Wonder', 'returns', 'DVD', 'even', 'better', 'part', 'one', ""'m"", 'always', 'cautious', 'purchase', 'sequel', 'movie', 'movie', 'companies', 'take', 'advantage', 'success', 'first', 'part', 'haste', 'release', 'junk.The', 'Exorcist', 'part', 'II', 'immediately', 'mind', 'said', 'am', 'please', 'inform', 'Spidey', 'Fans', 'sequel', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Packed', 'action', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'who', 'like', 'love', 'stories', 'nice', 'continuation', 'part', 'one.Part', 'II', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'survived', 'part', 'original', 'cast', 'playing', 'part', 'new', 'more', 'formidable', 'foe', 'Spidey', 'Dr.', 'Octo', '.Peter', 'Parker', 'torn', 'obligation', 'do', 'good', 'society', 'burning', 'desire', 'show', 'love', 'M.J.', 'telling', 'truth', 'who', 'really', 'desire', 'keep', 'friendship', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'son', 'Harry', 'meanwhile', 'determined', 'find', 'Spiderman', 'avenge', 'father', 'death', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'Spider', 'Man', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'enjoy', 'sappy', 'story', 'line', 'seeing', 'Spidey', 'II', 'must', 'say', 'story', 'M.J.', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'was', 'nicely', 'presented', 'viewer', 'taking', 'away', 'purpose', 'movie', 'blow', 'away', 'audience', 'great', 'special', 'effects.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Kriten', 'Dunst', 'M.J.', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'convincing', 'audience', 'undeniable', 'love', 'other', 'Peter', 'can', 'only', 'keep', 'love', 'M.J.', 'something', 'most', 'can', 'relate', 'own', 'experiences', 'personal', 'decisions', 'Spiderman', 'juggle', 'direction', 'will', 'have', 'impact', 'spider', 'powers.Spiderman', 'effectively', 'base', 'definition', 'what', 'true', 'Hero', 'really', 'important', 'youngsters', 'today', 'society.Spider', 'Man', 'II', 'Nicely', 'told', 'story', 'tons', 'action', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'opinion', 'part', 'Viewers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'sequel.This', 'set', 'lots', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'Bloopers', 'making', 'movie', 'Trivia', 'Documentary', 'newest', 'Villain', 'multi', 'angle', 'look', 'one', 'most', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'movie', 'much', 'more.Spiderman', 'II', 'available', '3', 'different', 'technical/visual', 'formats', 'widescreen', 'full', 'screen', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Sound', 'Superbit', '5.1', 'DTS', 'availability', 'So', 'be', 'sure', 'set', 'buy', 'compatible', 'system', 'DVD', 'not', 'DTS', 'audio', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'unsurpassed', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'convincing.Overall', 'release', 'Lots', 'action', 'lots', 'special', 'effects', 'nice', 'story', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'there', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'DVD.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Spider-Man 2

Thanks to his secret identity as Spider-man, he's lost his job, his grades are failing, he's lost his best friend Harry (James Franco), and he lost the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  While he still sees these friends occasionally, Harry is obsessed by his desire for revenge on Spider-man and Mary Jane has a new boyfriend.  Things are even a struggle for Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who can't seem to pay her mortgage.All this is enough to make Peter rethink his superhero ambitions.  And, since he seems to be losing his superpowers, maybe he can put everything behind him.All this couldn't come at a worse time, however.  The brilliant Dr. Octavius (Alfred Molina) is conducting a dangerous experiment with fusion.  When it goes wrong, he winds up with appendages wired into this nervous system, giving him four extra arms.  The arms also begin to control his actions, and the newly named Doc Ock soon becomes a danger to the city.  Can Peter pull himself together to save the day?I loved the first movie, but this one isn't as good.  They tried to replicate the emotional impact of the first movie, but it doesn't ring as true here.  In fact, the emotional story slows the movie down in places.  Frankly, I don't go to see superhero movies for lots of emotional story telling.  Some is fine, but they went a little overboard here.But the movie is still entertaining.  The action sequences are great.  The entire cast does a great job again.  And the special effects have improved since the first movie.  There are only a couple times I can even tell that it's not 100% real this time.

Spiderman grossed $403 million dollars and is the fifth most successful movie in U.S. history. Spiderman 2 could shatter that number.Spiderman 2 picks up right where Spiderman left us. Peter Parker(Maguire) is a struggling college student. His grades are slipping and so are his friendships with his best friends Mary Jane(Dunst) and Harry(Franco). His Aunt May(Harris) is worried sick about him. His duties as Spiderman are keeping him so busy he's starting to fall apart. He has a huge assignment due in school about a famous scientist and Harry happens to know the guy so he gives him the hook up.Harry is now in charge of special operations at Osbourne Industries. Dr. Otto Octavius(Molina) is a world famous scientist who has ideas on how fusion will save the world. He's created four mechanical arms he wears that help him do the work. An accident happens though that causes the arms to fuse to the Dr and he goes on the rampage because the A.I. from the arms consume him. He is determined to make his fusion work and will stop at nothing to do it.Peter is a little devestated by the accident. He enjoyed meeting Octavius but is saddened by the experience. His life is also getting very hard on him. He finds out Mary Jane is engaged and is so mad with him that she wants almost nothing to do with him. Harry is so obsessed with killing Spiderman because he blames him for his dads death. He's angry at Peter and wants him to give him info on Spiderman. Peter can't take it anymore so he gives up as the web slinger.Peter is happy with his new life. His grades are improving, but his relationship with MJ isn't going the way he wanted. Doc Ock is still on the loose and must be stopped. Will the web slinger give up his new found happy life and stop Doc Ock or will he keep his new found happines. This is the movie that is Spiderman 2.This movie destroys the first one. It's much more entertaing than the first. It doesn't drag like the first one did, because so many new character aren't introduced. The movie is quite humerous in places and it is obvious that Raimi is more comfortable with the character. Raimi's comedic charm is evident all over the film and he takes the story and runs with it.An excellent story has been given to us. The Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar contribute to it. The screenplay is from Alvin Sargent who has written a comic masterpiece. The writers did a fantastic job with the story.Tobey McGuire is excellent as Spiderman. He is perfectly cast as Peter Parker. He seems more comfortable with the role and he shines. Kirsten Dunst is hot as Mary Jane. Like everybody else it's obvious she is more comfortable with the role and it's a bigger one for her this time around. Molina as Doc Ock is perfect. A awesome cast was done with this movie and the makers really need to be complimented on the good job.This movie is awesome. It's the most entertaining movie of 2004. It's easily the best comic book movie ever. Spiderman has always had a more humble human trait that so many other comic heros don't have. It's not so much about his powers and abilites, but how much he sacrifices to make the world a beter place. He puts other people above himself and he does so for the right reasons. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility and that's why we love Spiderman.You have to see this movie. This is what a comic movie should be. It's the best movie to this date of 2004 and is family fun entertainment. You can't call yourself a Spiderman fan and not see it.

Sherwin,"[0, 1]","Hey, they always said that sequels never quite measured up to the movie they follow--but this has got to be the MAJOR exception to the rule. The movie grabs your attention the very instant it starts and it never fails to entertain.The acting is magnificent and it's obvious that the cast worked their little tushies off! GRIN Tobey Maguire shines again as Peter Parker, who when he's not Spiderman is the ""Everyman"" who is stuck in a rotten, very low paying job, having problems committing to his girl because he can't tell her he's Spiderman, and he's not exactly able to afford a nice home, either. Yet he possesses such incredible powers! He is Spiderman yet incredibly enough he can't make up his mind if he should continue on as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. Should he hang up his Spiderman uniform, he wonders? Great acting here! Equally true, Alfred Molina cannot fail when he is cast as the tragic but evil villain Doc Ock. Parker must choose between fighting evil Doc Ock in his role as Spiderman or settling instead for a MUCH more meager existence as Peter Parker and Peter Parker alone. Worse yet, Peter Parker is also challenged by The Green Goblin once over again played by William Defoe. Kirsten Dunst also is cast so well as Peter's girlfriend Mary Jane; their chemistry is awesome! Again the acting is totally convincing and a real treat to enjoy. Don't forget to look for the train scene! GRINAnd yet there's MORE! The DVD is loaded--really loaded--with great extras! There's a technical commentary, a ""Spidey Sense 2"" pop-up trivia track, a blooper reel, a 12 (yes, TWELVE) part documentary on how they made the film, and a little special something called ""Ock-umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You!""

And it's not just Work - his college courses are suffering, even a commitment to see long-time crush Mary Jane in one of her plays ... because someone ALWAYS gets into trouble on the way there. Torn between being 'Spider-man' and plain old Peter (his love for Mary Jane and that less rushed, more ordinary lifestyle), Pete faces a new challenge to his dichotomous identity: Is he any longer cut out to BE Spiderman? Throw into that existential crisis a much-publicized fission experiment gone terribly wrong, a newly potent, tentacled villian who can climb skyscrapers and hurl automobiles like soda cans, as well as a director with a respect both for the genre and for the origins of the story, and you have the makings for a smart and suprisingly well-crafted tale.Spidey-Two is one of those sequels that truly is better than the original. For one thing, on almost every level it is more complex than the first, handling and balancing those complexities as professionally as any movie of its kind. The story itself contains more intricately interrelated elements than did its predecessor. The pacing is careful. The character portraits - most notably that of Peter Parker - are deep and could rival everything else we've seen this year in cinema. Actually, in the two-plus hours that show us his hopes and struggles, Peter Parker became visibly more human than any other put-to-film superhero I've ever seen. And no other superfigure can best Spiderman for sense of moral direction. Also, the action-sequences and visual effects are equally, or more, stunning than in the original. Here we get a much better sense of Spiderman's speed, agility, and even his sheer strength. For a final image we have a hero who is both very much someone with whom we can identify and yet somehow larger than life. As for other cast members, everyone who was anyone in the first movie comes back for the second. Adding to that is the reality, as one critic has said, that those same actors/actresses take their roles with utmost seriousness, making their characters the more believable. Finally, Sam Raimi directs those persons and their crises through some very refreshing plot turns.Chaulked-full of DVD extras (including Commentary by Sam, Tobey, and producers; blooper reel; trivia track; a women-of-Spiderman featurette; 'Doc Ock'-umentary; and much more), SPIDERMAN 2 remains a motion-picture force to be reckoned with - one entirely worthy of the praise it received.",5,Best Picture of 2004,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,2767,"['Director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'raised', 'comics-to-cinema', 'bar', 'new', 'heights', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'highly-acclaimed', 'sequel', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'more', 'ways', 'mere', 'Box', 'Office', 'numbers.Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Peter', 'Parker/Spiderman', 'now', 'scrambling', 'more', 'ever', 'meet', 'engagements', 'time', 'not', 'just', 'Work', 'college', 'courses', 'are', 'suffering', 'even', 'commitment', 'see', 'long-time', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'one', 'plays', 'someone', 'ALWAYS', 'trouble', 'way', 'there', 'Torn', 'being', ""'Spider-man"", 'plain', 'old', 'Peter', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'less', 'rushed', 'more', 'ordinary', 'lifestyle', 'Pete', 'new', 'challenge', 'dichotomous', 'identity', 'longer', 'cut', 'out', 'BE', 'Spiderman', 'Throw', 'existential', 'crisis', 'much-publicized', 'fission', 'experiment', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'newly', 'potent', 'tentacled', 'villian', 'who', 'can', 'climb', 'skyscrapers', 'hurl', 'automobiles', 'soda', 'cans', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'respect', 'genre', 'origins', 'story', 'have', 'makings', 'smart', 'suprisingly', 'well-crafted', 'tale.Spidey-Two', 'one', 'sequels', 'truly', 'better', 'original', 'one', 'thing', 'almost', 'level', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'handling', 'balancing', 'complexities', 'as', 'professionally', 'movie', 'kind', 'story', 'more', 'intricately', 'interrelated', 'elements', 'did', 'predecessor', 'pacing', 'careful', 'character', 'most', 'notably', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'are', 'deep', 'could', 'rival', 'everything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'cinema', 'Actually', 'two-plus', 'hours', 'show', 'hopes', 'struggles', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'became', 'visibly', 'more', 'human', 'other', 'put-to-film', 'superhero', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'other', 'superfigure', 'can', 'best', 'Spiderman', 'sense', 'moral', 'direction', 'Also', 'action-sequences', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'equally', 'more', 'stunning', 'original', 'Here', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'Spiderman', 'speed', 'agility', 'even', 'sheer', 'strength', 'final', 'image', 'have', 'hero', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'someone', 'whom', 'can', 'identify', 'yet', 'somehow', 'larger', 'life', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'anyone', 'first', 'movie', 'back', 'second', 'Adding', 'reality', 'one', 'critic', 'said', 'same', 'actors/actresses', 'take', 'roles', 'utmost', 'seriousness', 'making', 'characters', 'more', 'believable', 'Finally', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'persons', 'crises', 'very', 'refreshing', 'plot', 'turns.Chaulked-full', 'DVD', 'extras', 'including', 'Commentary', 'Sam', 'Tobey', 'producers', 'reel', 'track', 'women-of-Spiderman', 'featurette', ""Ock'-umentary"", 'much', 'more', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'motion-picture', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'one', 'entirely', 'worthy', 'praise', 'received']",Spider-Man 2
621299,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JMQW,Matthew Horner,"[1, 6]","""Spiderman 2"" is a marvelous action-adventure, sci-fi thriller which won't please everyone because it emphasizes story over action. There is plenty of action, of course, but much of the movie dwells on the loneliness, alienation and complexity of its hero, Peter Parker/Spiderman. Its premise is that being a hero has its price - a theme which everyone from the ancient Greeks to Shakespeare and beyond has written about. It also employs the idea that greatness is often thrust upon an unwilling participant and plays havoc with such a person's personal life.The movie's screenplay employs the ""Gone With the Wind/Titanic"" approach. These movies had as much story as action. They were the most successful films of their time.There is -and always has been - a portion of the audience which demands all action all of the time. For these viewers, ""Spiderman 2"" is a disappointment. It's not in the ""Independence Day/Starship Troopers/The Day After Tomorrow"" format, in which the characters are cardboard ones who exist only to move the action along.Tobey Macguire reprises his role as Spiderman. He is perfect. Something tells me that Macguire is a bit perplexed by the fact that he has become known as one of the great actors of his generation, much like Spiderman is confused by his powers.This episode finds Parker down on his luck and depressed. There are no great villains for him to fight. He's still madly in love with MJ [Kirsten Dunst] but is afraid to show his feelings because he knows that his enemies could harm her if they knew of his feelings for her. Harry Osborn [James Franco] is remains his best friend but does not know that Parker as Spiderman killed Osborn's mad scientist father in the first movie.  Finally, another madman comes to the rescue - Dock Ork [Alfred Molina], yet another scientist taken hostage by his own overly ambitious science project.Full enjoyment of this sequel requires one to see the original, because so much of the story hinges on knowledge of what happened in the first film.My main criticism of ""Spiderman 2"" is that the ending is a blatant setup for ""Spiderman 3"".

Uhley,"[0, 0]","In 2002, Sam Raimi made a Saturday morning cartoon.In 2007, Sam Raimi made an unabashed piece of s***.In 2004, Sam Raimi made an actual film with a story.I could really relate to Peter Parker's plight when I saw Spider-Man 2 theatrically. During that time, I was lazy and always late; disappointing my professors and yes, even employers. I was brilliant but couldn't quite pull it together. It's nice to be reminded of an actual personal connection I had to a superhero character.I'm tempted to make an erectile dysfunction joke about Toby Maguire losing his powers but that isn't the right metaphor so I won't.Spider-Man 2 has uncommonly witty, intentionally funny dialogue for the comic book movie genre. Here are some of my favorite exchanges:Peter: ""I've been reading poetry lately.""Mary Jane: ""Whatever that means.""Miss Brant: ""Sir, your wife's on the line, she said she lost her checkbook.""J. Jonah Jameson: ""Thanks for the good news!""And of course, anything from Mr. Ditkovich, the humorous, debt-obsessed Russian landlord for Peter's apartment building:Ditkovich: ""Rent!""Peter: ""Hi.""Ditkovich: ""Hi? What's hi? Can I spend it?""Ditkovich: ""If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat.""A happy, glasses-wearing, 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' montage is infinitely better than Spider-Man 3's jackass, emo-hair Saturday Night Fever montage.High points: Alex Ross' spectacular opening title design, Ditkovich and his family (including a cameo by Louis Lombardi aka Edgar Stiles from 24), an Evil Dead-style hospital massacre, Alfred Molina, J.K. Simmons, Doc Ock lighting a cigar with one of his tentacles, the lakeside climax and ""Go get 'em, tiger"".Low points: James Franco's acting, Aunt May's 30-minute monologue, little ""Henry"" the plot device, a mask-less Spider-Man saving dozens of saintly train passengers (in a Crucifix pose) who promise to keep his secret safe.This superior sequel ends on a curiously dark, almost chilling music cue and a worried look on Kirsten Dunst's face that left me feeling a bit uneasy.",4,Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs.

Every action scene is breathtaking and Spidey's struggle when fighting Dr. Octopus is felt while watching the movie.But the best part about this movie other than its action scenes and great visual effects is its sense of character.  Tobey Maguire really conveys the character of Peter Parker well, in that he is able to show the inner struggle Parker faces between choosing to lead a normal life or a life as Spider-Man.J.K. Simmons is great as J. Jonah Jamison and Molina is very effective in his role as Dr. Octopus.  However, I think Molina should have worked on speaking with a German accent since Otto Octavius is obviously German.  This would have been even better, but no big deal.Kirsten Dunst does a much better job in her role as Mary Jane than the first film.  She does well in portraying Mary Jane's frustration and anguish over not being able to get close to Parker until the very end.Overall, the movie was GREAT and exceeded any and all of its expectations, which were relatively high to begin with.  For those who say the movie was just okay, it's obvious they don't quite understand the background of Spider-Man and don't have a feel for the comic book series.  Spider-Man 2 is just as good if not better than X2.

621302,AKZ1Q9S0Z3G6V,B00005JMQW,"Matthew Perri ""Matthew Perri""","[2, 3]","Spider-Man swings back into theaters today with webs-a-blazin' but he might need a shrink.I recommend this film...but there is a LOT to take in here. While that isn't a bad thing, there's a lot of heavy-handedness here and some could argue that it pads out the film.Yes, we all know Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a depressed young man. He only has time for one life and Spider-Man takes up most of it, leaving him exhausted. This point isn't hammered into your skull, it's DRILLED past your skull, into your brain and out your eyeballs and makes the movie feel longer than it is. By the time we get through half a barrel of celluloid molasses (including an excruciatingly syrupy sequence where Peter Parker struts around to Burt Bacharach's ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head""...no, I'm not kidding) and Parker FINALLY dons the Spider-Man costume again, the movie kicks into high gear.Peter loves Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but he can't tell her that because he's afraid that his ""enemies will find out who he really is"" and kill her. She loves HIM but can't figure him out because he can't tell her why he doesn't love her. Why Peter keeps tearing his mask off then in front of Doc Ock/ordinary citizens riding a train/Mary Jane/etc. is anybody?s guess, since he?s so protective of his identity. He?s even unmasked by Harry Osborne! After all the unmasking, it's a wonder that a) half of New York doesn't know who Spider-Man is, b) Mary Jane isn't cannon-fodder, or c) Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) isn't swimming with the fishes. Speaking of Harry Osborne, (played thanklessly by James Franco) he's busy trying to put his late father's company ""OsCorp"" back on the map with a new invention that will ""power the world for free""...if you create fusion from a ball of ""tritium""...and then power it up by shooting at it with lasers...and then use giant mechanical arms welded into your spine to handle the growing and dangerous ball of power...so dangerous, that it sucks everything metal...into...it's path...and...oh, nevermind.It?s a comic book! Don?t worry, just enjoy!Suffice to say, the villain this time is Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) AKA ""Dr. Octopus""(named thus by ""J. Jonah Jameson"" played by the talented J.K. Simmons, who almost steals the entire show like it was money). Octavius's character comes off as very smart and intelligent but his attitude and character do a complete turnaround when his ""arms"" malfunction after an accident...Here's where it gets murky.There is a ""control chip"" on the top of the spine which prevents the arms from going ""evil"". In the last film, they altered the Green Goblin's outfit terribly, making him look like a reject from the ""Ultraman"" series and here, they alter the idea behind Doc Ock: If Octavius crushes the chip, the arms control him and he becomes evil. If he goes mad, he still controls the arms, but uses them for evil. What scientist in their right mind created ""evil arms"" with a fragile ""control chip"" that could be so easily destroyed? But, again, this is a comic book, so forget that. Instead, let's focus on Doc Ock's ""evil plans"": he doesn't want revenge for the accident/his wife's death/etc. at all. Instead, he wants to continue his experiment at all costs(!). Why? I don't know. If you have total power, are now a murderer, and have the means to get more power, why would you still want to be a good guy? Keep in mind, this is never fully explained.One of the most awkward parts of the film is when Spider-Man pleads with Doc Ock ""not to listen to his tentacles"" which induced unintentional snickers and laughter in the theater. Alfred Molina, a British actor, playing a German villain with an American accent, plays a fine Doc Ock but seems just slightly underdone through no fault of his own.This doesn?t make the film bad! The battles between Spider-Man and Doc Ock are INCREDIBLE(the bank and train sequences are BRILLIANT, as if choreographed straight from the comic books) and the visual effects look incredibly lifelike...but the final battle is anti-climatic and the script and overall direction have some problems. David Koepp (writer of ""Mission: Impossible"" & ""Jurassic Park"") wrote the last film and he is SORELY missed. This one is by Alvin Seargeant (?Unfaithful?), one of four writers and, at times, it feels like it?s been handled too much. Spider-Man isn't even close to being the smart-alec he is in the comic book. With the exception of ""Here's your change"" while catching and throwing a bag of cash at Doc Ock, Spider-Man's lines consist of lines like, ""NO!"", ""You have to stop!"", ""Look out"", and the ever-famous, ""Whoo-hoo"" as he goes whipping through the air.I see a LOT of potential for this series, but hopefully all of the characters will have grown up because, at times, it's like watching reruns of ""Felicity"" with latex-clad super-beings flying around. Sam Raimi is an incredibly gifted director. His contributions to the fantasy/horror genre are fantastic, but, at times, I feel like he's just building a rushed and  uneven bridge to the inevitable finish. I often wondered what the film would look like with more screen-time. And this series WILL finish. ?Spider-Man 3? is teased in a sequence with a surprise cameo by Willem Dafoe who played The Green Goblin in the last film.So, how good is this movie? It?s a solid comic book film. As far as movies go this summer, ""The Terminal"" is still the best next to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". As comic-book films go, this stands somewhere below ""Superman"", its sequel, ""Blade"", ""Hulk"" and the fantastic ""X2: X-Men United"" and right next to contenders like it's predecessor, ""Daredevil"", and the first ""X-Men"" film.This Spider has yet to become a Man, but, then again, the story has yet to finish.***1/2 out of ****--Matt",3,Spider-tacular!,1088553600,"06 30,

621303,A1W6FFD9OYH5RZ,B00005JMQW,"Matt Russell ""superk23""","[3, 3]","Rarely would I give a movie a five star review.  Actually, this is my first.  Take it from me, the critics do not lie.  Spiderman 2 is an amazing achievement.  It is, in fact, as good, or better than the first.We pick up where we left off in the first film.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is battling his double duties as Spiderman and Peter Parker.  Still, at the same time, he is trying to cope with his love for the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  This would be the focus point of Spiderman 2.Peter's love for Mary Jane begins to take effect on his superhero obligations.  Back and forth, he begins to question his identity, feelings, and the everyday worries of job security, paying rent, etc.  All of his doubts, fears, and problems seem to revolve around, yes, Mary Jane.  He starts to lose focus as Spiderman and finds himself not able to use all of his gifts properly.  It eventually comes to the point where he decides it is time to give up being Spiderman in order to be able to be with the love of his life.Mary Jane is not the only returning member.  Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco) is back.  Harry still longs to avenge his father's death by killing Spiderman.  Here, Harry has turned darker by really obsessing with his nemesis and trying to drink his problems away.  Another reason for this is because of his failed attempt at phenomenal success with his genius scientis Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina).  Octavious' fusion experiment fails, but at the same time transfoms him into the villain Dr. Octopus, a man with four addtional limbs.  He later makes a deal with Harry in order to recreate an attempt at his fusion device.  This deal invloves bringing Spiderman to Harry so that he can finally seal the deal with his father's death.Doc Ock, as later called, and Spiderman encounter each other on numerous occassions.  The fight sequences are enjoyable to watch.  Although, I did not feel they were as good as Spiderman vs the Green Goblin, they are worth seeing.  Especially in stages where they are fighting while climbing skyscrapers.  There is also one action sequence on a train, which is probably the main battle.  It is really great to see on the big screen.There is also a break in the action.  As mentioned, Parker decides to give up his supehero identity.  We see shots of him going to school, being relaxed, eating ice cream, and so on.  However, all of this changes as soon as Mary Jane gets captured by Dr. Octopus.  This leads to the train fight mentioned above.In the end, Spidey and Dr. Octopus duke it out one last time and the girl is saved.  However, we later learn about a new possible villain for the next movie as Harry finds his father's secret hiding place that is complete with Green Goblin artifacts.Spiderman 2 is a really good movie.  One that is definitely worthy of the title ""summer blockbuster.""  Yet, the film is not about action.  Here, the story evolves around something much bigger.  In the first Spiderman, we caught a glimpse of the inner struggles of Peter Parker, here the come out in full force.  Watching the character grow, mature, and handle his problems makes the movie better.  Every superhero has a weakness.  That weakness can also equal strength.

621304,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B00005JMQW,M. Burns,"[10, 14]","One of the things that endeared me to the first Spider-Man film (and the first Matrix film) was its provision that it was a cheesey, comic book movie and not afraid to embrace that. I've always believed that super-hero movies/action-adventure movies shouldn't take themselves so seriously, because when they do it usually blows (Reloaded). Well, whereas the Matrix movies got all wrapped up in themselves, the second installment of Spider-Man is still as ready as ever to let that cornball dialogue fly. And that's not a bad thing. There's a real charm to this movie, like its predecessor, that elevates it to a much higher level than the mindless summer flicks with which it plays.And yes, it is better than the first film. ""Leaps and bounds"" better, as some critics are saying? No. But it's far more complex, more exciting, and more playful than the original. And while I'm on the subject of complexity, I have to mention maybe one of the greatest superhero villain creations of all time: 2's Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina). Molina, and the writing and concept behind his character, is really the strength of the film. I was endlessly fascinated by how layered he is: he starts out as a completely aimable man, gets wrapped up in the notion of scientific discovery, becomes a slave to his work, then gives himself over to it, and pursues Spider-Man...not because he's bad, but to advance his scientific cause. Doc Ock makes other movie villains, naturally and illogically evil, look like cardboard cut-outs.And the plot that grounds the film in realism is intriguing, too. Writer Alvin Sargent's script explores the psychological complexities of being a superhero: sure, Maguire's Peter Parker is a superhero, but why can't he choose to be a normal 20something instead? Is his 'higher calling' so much that he should sacrifice his whole life as well? These questions aren't answered in some ridiculous way, but simply worked out through the smooth, churning gears of the movie's narrative that never slows down too much and picks up to a giddily exciting pitch during the action scenes (that subway fight!). Yes, all the stuff with Mary Jane and Aunt May is shamelessly cheesey, but it's never off-putting. In fact, a scene in which Parker and M.J. walk and talk down a night-time New York street is as well-executed and honest as similar scenes in any recent drama.Neither Spider-Man movie has been a great film; the fact that this is based on a comic book will always add a level of subliminal silliness that will never be 'overcome.' But why, really? Spider-Man 2 sets out to do something, accomplishes it well, and met my expectations. Even within the constraints of a comic book, though, it reaches depth that few movies of its kind bother to tackle and really makes us care about the characters, and not in a superficial way (James Franco's Harry Osborn is a great example of that - he's set up to be a villain, but do we blame him really?). And it's fun. I'm sick of movies trying and failing to inspire real terror when dark comedy should be the objective - a sublime scene in an operating room had me rolling in my seat and, agree with me or not, I think that was director Sam Raimi's intention.Should Spider-Man 2 have had the ending it did? Not really. The first two fades-to-black would have made much more compelling conclusions to the film; in fact, I would have been ready to applaud the movie had it ended where you think it might the first time. But why gripe about a final scene that, though syrupy as hell, made me happy in spite of it all? Of course, that's a feeling that stayed with me every minute of the movie, too.

And along with this one, they're both alright. Not excellent. Not really, really bad either. Having heard this was better than the first, and the CGI was better, I went off to see it. Now lets face it, I could have seen many other films, among them Catwoman, or King Arthur (although it's done by Jerry Bruckheimer, who did Pirates of the Caribbean, and since that was utter clap-trap, I've kinda gone off the idea of begging around to see who would chum me)To start with, I was very unimpressed by the credits, which are highlights from the first Spiderman. It was Sam Raimi trying to be smart, and it fell flat with me. Very artistic to look at, but I want to see a film, not a bunch of people's names. If you're interested in seeing that, you watch it at the end of the movie!The CGI was loads better than the first, which had an almost computer game quality to it. Some shots were still a little iffy, but if you're watching for that, then you should really get a life.I'm still not keen on the casting of this. Tobey MacGuire does nothing for me. The faces he kept pulling, especially when he was exerting himself, were just downright ugly, and he looks too much like the eager boy in class, who knew the answers to every question. Kirsten Dunst can be reasonable, but her hair colour seemed to change continuously, and from what I've seen *ahem* I thought she was a vivacious red head. Not a whiny, practically blonde, oh-I-like-two-guys-I-can't-decide-which-one little girl.I preferred Doc Ock to the Green Goblin from the first. Dr. Otto Octavious was just a man who loved his wife very much - his face says it all when his wife gets killed, partly by him. He was just a little too into his work at times.I found this movie to be extremely tedious, and even if I looked away, and then looked back, I hadn't missed anything important. There seemed to be too much talking, and too little action, which I seem to find a common problem in these movies. The only bit of excitement I had was when my Dad whispered in my ear that Bruce Campbell was on the screen, and I leapt out of my seat - but by that time he'd gone off the screen. (He's credited as playing the ""snooty usher"".)This would have got a much lower rating if it hadn't been for the ending, cos I was about ready to give up all hope of ever getting out of there alive. The ending is really spectacular, and therefore, upped my rating of the movie. It's amazing on the big screen, and Mary Jane features pretty big in the finale - come on, you're all rooting for her to decide on the right person. But you don't do it in your wedding dress or with a very big engagement ring on your finger darling! There are also a lot of hints about a Spiderman 3, so watch carefully. I'm reckoning the next one could go two ways. Two possible bad guys? Maybe not, cos it could rehash this one. But then the other one could rehash the first one. Oh heck, I'm confusing myself now.Another thing I didn't like was Spiderman taking his mask off, excuse me, but what the heck was the point?! It just didn't ring true. Of course, MJ sees him without his mask on, and suddenly realises she knew it was him all along. Yes dear, whatever dear.Despite not liking (hate is too strong a word) most of this film, I did enjoy the ending, and it will be interesting to see what they do with the third, without rehashing the first two. And a note to Sam Raimi: please transform Bruce Campbell back to the way he looked in the Evil Dead movies - I'll definitely notice him on screen that way!",3,Why ruin a good thing by doing a sequel?,1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,3608,"['Oh', 'wait', 'did', 'enjoy', 'first', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'certain', 'one', ""'re"", 'alright', 'Not', 'excellent', 'Not', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'either', 'Having', 'heard', 'was', 'better', 'first', 'CGI', 'was', 'better', 'went', 'off', 'see', 'Now', 'face', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'Catwoman', 'King', 'Arthur', 'done', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'who', 'did', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'was', 'utter', 'clap-trap', ""'ve"", 'kinda', 'gone', 'off', 'idea', 'begging', 'around', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'chum', 'start', 'was', 'very', 'unimpressed', 'credits', 'are', 'highlights', 'first', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'trying', 'be', 'smart', 'fell', 'flat', 'Very', 'artistic', 'look', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'not', 'bunch', 'people', 'names', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'watch', 'end', 'movie', 'CGI', 'was', 'loads', 'better', 'first', 'had', 'almost', 'computer', 'game', 'quality', 'shots', 'were', 'still', 'little', 'iffy', ""'re"", 'watching', 'then', 'should', 'really', 'get', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'keen', 'casting', 'Tobey', 'MacGuire', 'nothing', 'kept', 'pulling', 'especially', 'when', 'was', 'exerting', 'were', 'just', 'downright', 'ugly', 'too', 'much', 'eager', 'boy', 'class', 'who', 'knew', 'answers', 'question', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'can', 'be', 'reasonable', 'hair', 'colour', 'seemed', 'change', 'continuously', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', '*ahem*', 'thought', 'was', 'vivacious', 'red', 'head', 'Not', 'whiny', 'practically', 'blonde', ""oh-I-like-two-guys-I-can't-decide-which-one"", 'little', 'girl.I', 'preferred', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'first', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavious', 'was', 'just', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'wife', 'very', 'much', 'face', 'when', 'wife', 'killed', 'partly', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'work', 'times.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'even', 'looked', 'away', 'then', 'looked', 'back', 'had', ""n't"", 'missed', 'anything', 'important', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'talking', 'too', 'little', 'action', 'seem', 'find', 'common', 'problem', 'movies', 'only', 'bit', 'excitement', 'had', 'was', 'when', 'Dad', 'whispered', 'ear', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'was', 'screen', 'leapt', 'seat', 'time', ""'d"", 'gone', 'off', 'screen', 'credited', 'playing', 'snooty', 'usher', 'would', 'have', 'got', 'much', 'lower', 'rating', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'ending', 'cos', 'was', 'about', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'hope', 'ever', 'getting', 'alive', 'ending', 'really', 'spectacular', 'therefore', 'upped', 'rating', 'movie', 'amazing', 'big', 'screen', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'features', 'pretty', 'big', 'finale', 'come', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'decide', 'right', 'person', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'wedding', 'dress', 'very', 'big', 'engagement', 'ring', 'finger', 'darling', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'hints', 'Spiderman', '3', 'so', 'watch', 'carefully', ""'m"", 'reckoning', 'next', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'two', 'ways', 'Two', 'possible', 'bad', 'guys', 'Maybe', 'not', 'cos', 'could', 'rehash', 'one', 'then', 'other', 'one', 'could', 'rehash', 'first', 'one', 'Oh', 'heck', ""'m"", 'confusing', 'now.Another', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Spiderman', 'taking', 'mask', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'point', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'course', 'MJ', 'mask', 'suddenly', 'knew', 'was', 'along', 'Yes', 'dear', 'dear.Despite', 'not', 'liking', 'hate', 'too', 'strong', 'word', 'most', 'film', 'did', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'do', 'third', 'rehashing', 'first', 'two', 'note', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'please', 'transform', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'back', 'way', 'looked', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'notice', 'screen', 'way']",Spider-Man 2

The story picks off where the first film left off: Peter is struggling to suppress his feelings for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whose acting career is finally taking off. Peter begins to doubt his decision to lead a double life in exchange for his own happiness: he decides to throw in the towel (or in this case, the spider suit) and try living a ""normal"" life. But normalcy doesn't stop Mary Jane from getting engaged to another man, nor does it allow Peter to turn his back on the insurgence of crime that has plagued New York since Spiderman hung his suit out to dry.Ultimately, Peter decides to continue fighting the bad guys, and he comes face to face with a villain who is even more impressive than the Green Goblin: ""Doctor Octopus,"" a mechanically-powered scientist whose experiment takes a turn for the worse and results in his tentacled creation taking control of him.The audience will be glad to see a resolution to the Peter/Mary Jane romance, as well as a surprise cameo at the end that gives us a big hint as to what ""Spiderman 3"" will be about.

However, Spider-Man is starting to have problems slinging webs and scaling walls like a spider, while Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who has taken over the leadership of Oscorp, has invested millions of dollars into a project to create fusion energy as designed by the scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).  To help him successfully control the fusion reaction, Dr. Octavius designs a set of four cybernetic arms that he attaches along his spinal cord.  While Peter, Harry and a host of invited guests watch Dr. Octavius start the reaction, it suddenly goes out of control and destroys the chip that keeps the cybernetic arms under the control of Dr. Octavius' mind.  The result: Dr. Octavius is taken over by the less-than-ethical cybernetic arms and becomes a powerful criminal force determined to reattempt his dangerous fusion experiment regardless of the consequences.  As for Peter, with diminishing superhero abilities and his desire to recapture Mary Jane's heart from her new fianc&eacute;, the astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) who is also the son of J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons), he decides to throw away his Spider-Man costume in an attempt to live a normal life; but will that be possible with a menace as powerful as Dr. Octavius, a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, roaming the streets and threatening innocent lives?  Will Harry ever come to terms with his father's death, as shown in the first ""Spider-Man"" film?  You will just have to watch this exciting return of Spider-Man to find out!As with the first ""Spider-Man"" film in 2002, the 2004 sequel has wonderful cinematography and great special effects.  The story is also quite entertaining and engaging.  Other memorable characters include Aunt May Parker (Rosemary Harris), Rosalie Octavius (Donna Murphy, who played Anij in the 1998 ""Star Trek: Insurrection""), Mr. Aziz (Aasif Mandvi) and a brief appearance from Harry's deceased father, Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  Overall, I rate ""Spider-Man 2"" with 4.5 out of 5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars and highly recommend it.",5,"""Isn't it about time somebody saved your life?""",1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,2515,"['Marvel', 'Comics', 'superhero', 'Spider-Man', 'a.k.a', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'made', 'triumphant', 'return', 'big', 'screen', '2004', 'sequel', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Again', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'finds', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'struggling', 'earn', 'living', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'alone', 'attending', 'college', 'crave', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'saving', 'lives', 'people', 'trouble', 'costumed', 'secretive', 'Spider-Man', 'However', 'Spider-Man', 'starting', 'have', 'problems', 'slinging', 'webs', 'scaling', 'walls', 'spider', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'leadership', 'Oscorp', 'invested', 'millions', 'dollars', 'project', 'create', 'fusion', 'energy', 'designed', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'help', 'successfully', 'control', 'fusion', 'reaction', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'set', 'four', 'cybernetic', 'arms', 'spinal', 'cord', 'Peter', 'Harry', 'host', 'invited', 'guests', 'watch', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'start', 'reaction', 'suddenly', 'control', 'chip', 'cybernetic', 'arms', 'control', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'mind', 'result', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'taken', 'over', 'less-than-ethical', 'cybernetic', 'arms', 'powerful', 'criminal', 'force', 'determined', 'reattempt', 'dangerous', 'fusion', 'experiment', 'regardless', 'consequences', 'Peter', 'diminishing', 'superhero', 'abilities', 'desire', 'recapture', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'heart', 'new', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'astronaut', 'John', 'Jameson', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'who', 'also', 'son', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'J.', 'K.', 'Simmons', 'throw', 'away', 'Spider-Man', 'costume', 'attempt', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'possible', 'menace', 'as', 'powerful', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'a.k.a', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'roaming', 'streets', 'threatening', 'innocent', 'lives', 'Will', 'Harry', 'ever', 'come', 'terms', 'father', 'death', 'shown', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'exciting', 'return', 'Spider-Man', 'find', 'out', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', '2002', '2004', 'sequel', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'also', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'include', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Parker', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Rosalie', 'Octavius', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'who', 'played', 'Anij', '1998', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Insurrection', 'Mr.', 'Aziz', 'Aasif', 'Mandvi', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Harry', 'deceased', 'father', 'Green', 'Goblin/Norman', 'Osborn', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Overall', 'rate', 'Spider-Man', '2', '4.5', '5', 'stars', 'rounded', 'up', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend']",Spider-Man 2
621312,AT393OR1JTYNR,B00005JMQW,Miami Nights,"[1, 3]","Just having seen ""Spider-Man 2"" I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of its drama -- perhaps one could say the dramatic resonance is due to the long-known Spider-man back story, but director Sam Raimi actually makes the story and characters come first and the CGI and other effects serve the story, not the other way around -- which is how most comic book hero movies play out.""Spider-Man 2"" actually has true, deep scenes of drama, enough to move you -- and it's very few, if any, comic-book hero movies that do that. The first ""Superman"" movie is probably the only other one that acheives true drama.Whereas my reaction to the first ""Spider-Man"" was one more of curious interest, than true appreciation, since it was a rather safe delivery. But ""2"" handles everything deftly -- Spidey's/Peter Parker's dilemma, his relationships with Harry Osborn, Mary Jane, Auntie May -- and it even deftly shows the conflict within Dr. Octavius. While it is made primarily for a young/teen audience, it does have a maturity and even, at times, a grim, melancholy mood. Most importantly, you care for these characters -- and Dr. Octavius is not your run-of-the-mill, mustache twisting bad guy. He's an inventor with good intentions who, due to a string of bad coincidences, is trapped by his own invention. If there is a downside, it's the J. Jonah Jameson performance. Sure, J. Jonah Jameson is an over-the-top persona/character, but the performance, while done with a sort of corny charm, it doesn't really fit in with the other performances which are straightforward and not cartoonish.""Spider-Man 2"" is a great improvement on the first movie, and definitely beats the sophomore jinx, making the rare sequel that is much better than the first.Lastly, the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" bit/montage was very humorous, and a nice touch, punctuated by one big wink.",4,Arguably the best comic book hero-based movie,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1860,"['Just', 'having', 'seen', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'depth', 'drama', 'perhaps', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'dramatic', 'resonance', 'due', 'long-known', 'Spider-man', 'back', 'story', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'actually', 'story', 'characters', 'come', 'first', 'CGI', 'other', 'effects', 'serve', 'story', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'how', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'movies', 'play', 'out', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'actually', 'true', 'deep', 'scenes', 'drama', 'enough', 'move', 'very', 'few', 'comic-book', 'hero', 'movies', 'do', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'probably', 'only', 'other', 'one', 'true', 'drama.Whereas', 'reaction', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'curious', 'interest', 'true', 'appreciation', 'was', 'rather', 'safe', 'delivery', '2', 'handles', 'everything', 'deftly', ""Spidey's/Peter"", 'Parker', 'dilemma', 'relationships', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Auntie', 'May', 'even', 'deftly', 'conflict', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'made', 'primarily', 'young/teen', 'audience', 'have', 'maturity', 'even', 'times', 'grim', 'melancholy', 'mood', 'Most', 'importantly', 'care', 'characters', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'not', 'run-of-the-mill', 'mustache', 'twisting', 'bad', 'guy', 'inventor', 'good', 'intentions', 'who', 'due', 'string', 'bad', 'coincidences', 'trapped', 'own', 'invention', 'downside', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'performance', 'Sure', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'over-the-top', 'persona/character', 'performance', 'done', 'sort', 'corny', 'charm', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'straightforward', 'not', 'cartoonish', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'great', 'improvement', 'first', 'movie', 'definitely', 'sophomore', 'jinx', 'making', 'rare', 'sequel', 'much', 'better', 'first.Lastly', 'Raindrops', 'Keep', 'Fallin', 'My', 'Head', 'bit/montage', 'was', 'very', 'humorous', 'nice', 'touch', 'punctuated', 'one', 'big', 'wink']",Spider-Man 2

This time Peter Parker is trying to juggle keeping a job, maintaining a run-down apartment, keeping his grades up, while continuing his Spidey exploits.Peter starts regretting his life as Spiderman because it interferes with all other parts of his life, especially his hidden love for Mary Jane Watson.  This starts to affect his powers.  Sometimes his webs fail to fire and his vision starts to go back to what it was before he was bitten by an enhanced arachnid.  Peter must make a decision whether or not he wants to give up being Spidey and try to better his Peter life or stick to the credo he learned from his dying Uncle Ben (with great power comes great responsibility).Meanwhile his friend Harry (who is obsessed with killing Spiderman) is now one of the heads of Oscorp and is funding a scientist who has a new way to generate atomic energy.  Dr. Octavius has a way to create and harness a tiny sun.  This is through the use of robotic metal arms that are attached to his body and controlled through a computer chip that feeds impulses to his brain.  Something goes wrong with the experiment and the chip gets destroyed.  Out of control, the arms take control of Octavius's mind, turning him into the evil Dr. Octopus.The special effects outdo the original and Alfred Molina is likeable as the unfortunate Dr. Octopus (unlike the annoying and pompous villain portrayed by Willem Defoe in the first film).  The movie overdoes the comedy somewhat.  There is a take-off from Midnight Cowboy (done to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head) and J. Jonah Jameson is one joke after another.

Dunst meanwhile is not only stunning physically, but she is a darned good actress, giving Mary Jane just the right amount of naivete and spunk.  A supporting actor and actress nod should go to Alfred Molina and Rosemary Harris.  Molina is the perfect villain as the incredibly designed Doctor Ock!  He uses his impressive acting abilities to bring both compassion and hatred.  Ms. Harris is beautiful as Peter's Aunt May.  A seasoned theatrical and movie actress, Harris embodies the essence of paternal and familial love.  J. K. Simmons as Peter's editor boss is outrageously campy and brilliant.

621320,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JMQW,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[0, 0]","The first Spider-Man movie was a careful, appropriate, and sincere retelling of the Spider-Man mythology. In essence, the mythology of Spider-Man carried the movie, not the movie itself. In contrast, Tim Burton's Batman was extremely...Burtonesque. It's a tribute to Raimi's directorial skill that he was able to put his ego aside and get the heck out of the way of a great story.Spider-Man 2, on the other hand, has Raimi written all over it. Spider-Man 2 isn't just Raimi's magnum opus--it's bigger, better, more stylized, and ultimately, a different kind of movie altogether.In Spider-Man 2, we pick up two years later and yet, things are still pretty much the same. Peter's (Tobey Maquire) living week-to-week on jobs he can't keep due to his nighttime superhero antics. His grades suffer. He never gets a date. Peter is a big loser...smart, but unlucky in just about everything.Conversely, things are going swimmingly well for Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst). She's marrying J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) son (Danielle Gillies, who eventually becomes Man-Wolf after finding a weird space rock on the moon). She models for billboards. She gets great acting gigs.In the background, Harry Osborn (James Franco), is now the CEO of Oscorp after his father died in a battle with Spider-Man. Harry is gambling on a dangerous perpetual fusion project, led by the inimitable Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina).Comic book fans know the drill: Otto creates mechanical tentacles, attached at his waist, to act as his hands when performing experiments of extreme heat and radiation. That's why Dr. Octavius stands behind a reinforced wall and inserts his tentacles in a fashion similar to modern scientists manipulating dangerous chemicals today.Oh wait. No that was the comic. In the movie, against all reason, Otto uses the tentacles without any protective gear whatsoever. Since Otto's conducting an open room demonstration with the people funding the project in a warehouse, mere feet away from a pulsating globe of energy, one must wonder if the tentacles have any use at all.In the comic, Doctor Octopus had six tentacles. Here has only four, but they're plenty. It also becomes immediately evident why Alfred Molina had to play the part - wearing tentacles and not looking like an idiot requires a BIG man, and Molina is huge. Unlike the comic, where the tentacles bond with Doc Ock as a result of the explosion, giving him ""telepathic control over them,"" these tentacles are artificially intelligent. Each tentacle snaps and hisses like a snake, with a glaring red eye in its palm. And oh yeah, the tentacles work based off of Doc Ock's neuro-transmissions, so the suit that controls the tentacles digs directly into his spinal column.My wife turned to me at this point and said, ""Why didn't they just sell the tentacles to make a profit?"" She's right - in the rush to get on with the rest of the plot, the weirdly plausible tentacles didn't need much explaining. And since when are scientists both mechanical engineers AND brilliant physicists?The word ""tentacles"" should have perked up the ears of Raimi fans. Raimi is fond of tentacles, as evidenced by the Evil Dead movies (which in turn, was taken from Chinese Ghost Story). Doc Ock's tentacles attack with a mind of their own, flailing surgeons in a surrealistic scene that could only be described as Raimi's brand of horror. There's even a surgeon who grabs a medical chainsaw and tries to cut one of the tentacles. It doesn't save him.I won't dwell on the unnecessary Mrs. Octavius (Rosalie) or some of the other minor quibbles about the Doc Ock character. However, once Doc Ock's rushed origin is over, all is forgiven. His tentacles have a personality of their own and they undulate and twist in the background as Doc Ock gestures. He has the round glasses, the trench coat, and all the moves that make Doc Ock Doc Ock. Visually, anyway, Raimi got it right. Certainly, he still makes more sense than the painfully strained justifications created for the Green Goblin (a surfboard AND a green suit AND little bombs that happen to look like pumpkins? What an amazing coincidence!).The rest of the movie is Peter navigating the wrecked shambles of his life (and peripherally, that of his Aunt May). Spider-Man 2 stays firmly focused on the dizzying highs and piteous lows of a kid trying to make it on his own, including family squabbles, failed romance, and strained friendships. We are led to believe that Peter begins to lose his powers because he no longer believes in himself. Can't climb? Sure. Can't shoot webbing? Okay. Is physically weaker? Gimme a break. Spider-Man's muscles didn't deflate, so there's no reason for Parker to limp after a fall...except to make an in-joke about Tobey Maquire's back problem.The first movie had a lot of CGI effects that just weren't up to par. Yes, Spider-Man needs to move like a superhero, but often times he looked like some kind of weird robot with extra joints, flipping around in ways that didn't feel like it could be a man in a suit. In Spider-Man 2, Raimi is cognizant of the limitations of CGI. We never see Spider-Man up close when the special effects are required, just like every director's been doing for years with good old fashioned make-up and animatronics.Despite the change in pace, the fight scenes are filled with amazing feats of agility. Spider-Man's not just acrobatic, he THINKS fast and the contortions he resorts to display that magnificent superhuman speed. He has to move fast too, because Doc Ock's got six limbs to Spider-Man's four.Props to Raimi for making a movie that doesn't flinch in dealing with its subject. Heck, the ending puts a stake in the ground that puts to rest the ""who will be the next villain?"" game. Barring some plot flaws that can be chalked up to a comic book style, Spider-Man 2 is a real treat.",4,"Some plot flaws, but a real treat",1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,5851,"['first', 'Spider-Man',

621322,ATNX84AGYIN39,B00005JMQW,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[0, 1]","""I need to know, do you love me?"" a timid, temperate Mary Jane asks Peter Parker, as they sit in a cafe, almost ready to be barraged by the villainous Doctor Octopus. In such a pivotal sequence, we can see the troubles of two characters, two dynamic characters...these are rare. You almost feel for them, as if their troubles are yours.But isn't that always what Spider-man was meant to be? The one we all associate with? The imperfect hero? Come on, everyone knows it. I, for one, have never associated more perfectly with a character, well maybe Lloyd Dobbler(Say Anything), but nah, Peter Parker indefinitely; a reason why I'm so attached to the Spider-man story and a reason why I call myself such a Spiderman fan. So, tonight, when I was able to finally watch Spider-man 2, the hype came down to this, a 2 hour and 7 minute masterpiece.Masterpiece is an understatement. When you walk out of a film and have chills and the urge to walk right back in and press...restart, well, that says something. 'Spiderman 2' has just that. I could easily call this the greatest superhero film of all time, but I'd be wrong. It's a wonderful addition to the greatest superhero saga of all time. Each section, like the original and now the predecessors, are brilliant.Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco are the company behind this...they are the recurring ones. I'd even say J.K. Simmons, who shines so even better in this new installment. I've never seen a combination of great casting since maybe Back to the Future or Indiana Jones. When we look back, these films are going to be up there in the memorable favorites/classics, and it's primarily because of this working team. Maguire is Parker, Dunst is MJ. Simple, I can only wait to see where they go with their characters next, as it seems Maguire has the Parker bit down to a knot. Watch the finale and see the gel here, it's nothing short of perfect.And where would these characters go without some clever writing? Taking time and making sure everything is well, is well, what makes this, THIS. The dialogue is ingenious and it wraps full circle, not a tag back, but a lesson you are told, and then acknowledged and learned by the time you pass the movie vendor, again. I'm still looking back at all the things said and done, and where are the actors' roads, without them being paved? The writers do an exceptional job here, paving highways to accessible storylines, where we are given hints, but all mere speculation, although, there is one big hint. Spare, no expense.Sensational and overwhelming, every time I watch these films, it's just that. I think of that which means most, it's all association, its' all what makes these prolific. If I watch a film about titanium androids killing and then doing nothing but killing, I'll be bored. Well, if James Cameron's there, maybe not, but point being, there needs to be substance. This film, just like the original, has it. I turned, I kicked the seat, I squirmed, and it was all because of that. The film gets you, and doesn't let you go!Immediately after watching the film, I phoned my girlfriend. Having known how much my life parallels certain aspects of the Spider-man aura, I told her how much I loved her and how I couldn't wait to see her again. She means a lot to me, everything in the world, I knew this already, and she knew this. But, knowledge can only be attained when reminded...and this is exactly what happened.Go see it? Well, let's just say, of course.Best film of the year, as far as I'm concerned, and yes, it may be a ""superhero"" film, but it's indefinitely more than that.***** out of *****""I was uplifted and taken into this fictional world, that in a way, isn't so much different than reality.""- final word",5,"My Life, My Curse, My Review of 'Spider-man 2'",1088553600,"06 30, 2004",2004,3749,"['need', 'know', 'do', 'love', 'timid', 'temperate', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'sit', 'cafe', 'almost', 'ready', 'be', 'barraged', 'villainous', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'such', 'pivotal', 'sequence', 'can', 'see', 'troubles', 'two', 'characters', 'two', 'dynamic', 'characters', 'are', 'rare', 'almost', 'feel', 'troubles', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'what', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'one', 'associate', 'imperfect', 'hero', 'Come', 'everyone', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'associated', 'more', 'perfectly', 'character', 'well', 'maybe', 'Lloyd', 'Dobbler', 'Say', 'Anything', 'nah', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'indefinitely', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", 'so', 'attached', 'Spider-man', 'story', 'reason', 'why', 'call', 'such', 'Spiderman', 'fan', 'So', 'tonight', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'finally', 'watch', 'Spider-man', '2', 'hype', 'came', 'down', '2', 'hour', '7', 'minute', 'masterpiece.Masterpiece', 'understatement', 'When', 'walk', 'film', 'have', 'chills', 'urge', 'walk', 'right', 'back', 'press', 'restart', 'well', 'something', '2', 'just', 'could', 'easily', 'call', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'film', 'time', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'wonderful', 'addition', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'saga', 'time', 'section', 'original', 'now', 'predecessors', 'are', 'brilliant.Sam', 'Raimi', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'James', 'Franco', 'are', 'company', 'are', 'recurring', 'ones', ""'d"", 'even', 'say', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'who', 'so', 'even', 'better', 'new', 'installment', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'combination', 'great', 'casting', 'maybe', 'Back', 'Future', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'When', 'look', 'back', 'films', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'memorable', 'favorites/classics', 'primarily', 'working', 'team', 'Maguire', 'Parker', 'Dunst', 'MJ', 'Simple', 'can', 'only', 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'go', 'characters', 'next', 'Maguire', 'Parker', 'bit', 'down', 'knot', 'Watch', 'finale', 'see', 'gel', 'here', 'nothing', 'short', 'perfect.And', 'where', 'would', 'characters', 'go', 'clever', 'writing', 'Taking', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'everything', 'well', 'well', 'what', 'THIS', 'dialogue', 'ingenious', 'full', 'circle', 'not', 'tag', 'back', 'lesson', 'are', 'told', 'then', 'acknowledged', 'learned', 'time', 'pass', 'movie', 'vendor', 'again', ""'m"", 'still', 'looking', 'back', 'things', 'said', 'done', 'where', 'are', 'actors', 'roads', 'being', 'paved', 'writers', 'do', 'exceptional', 'job', 'here', 'paving', 'highways', 'accessible', 'storylines', 'where', 'are', 'given', 'hints', 'mere', 'speculation', 'one', 'big', 'hint', 'Spare', 'expense.Sensational', 'overwhelming', 'time', 'watch', 'films', 'just', 'think', 'most', 'association', 'what', 'prolific', 'watch', 'film', 'titanium', 'androids', 'killing', 'then', 'doing', 'nothing', 'killing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bored', 'Well', 'James', 'Cameron', 'maybe', 'not', 'point', 'being', 'be', 'substance', 'film', 'just', 'original', 'turned', 'kicked', 'seat', 'squirmed', 'was', 'film', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Immediately', 'watching', 'film', 'phoned', 'girlfriend', 'Having', 'known', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'parallels', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Spider-man', 'aura', 'told', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'how', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'again', 'lot', 'everything', 'world', 'knew', 'already', 'knew', 'knowledge', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'attained', 'when', 'reminded', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened.Go', 'see', 'Well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'course.Best', 'film', 'year', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'yes', 'may', 'be', 'superhero', 'film', 'indefinitely', 'more', '*****', '*****', 'was', 'uplifted', 'taken', 'fictional', 'world', 'way', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'different', 'reality', 'final', 'word']",Spider-Man 2

Combining a great hero and villain with a great story and amazing special effects, ""Spider-Man 2"" is a great movie, period.  It picks up a few years after the original, with Peter Parker (Maguire) still pining after the girl he will never let himself have, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst).  He is fighting internally between what he wants and what he feels he should do, and not seeing a way to have both.  His friend Harry Osborn (Franco) is getting steadily more and more bitter with him because he will not give up Spider-man, the person who killed his father.  Add to that the fact that he is juggling so many other things in his personal life, and you have a pretty miserable Peter Parker.  When is powers start to fail him, he decides to be Spider-Man no more.As all this is happening, Doctor Otto Octavius (Molina) is perfecting a fusion process for OsCorp that will be a great advance in the field.  An accident fuses four mechanical arms to his spine and sends him on a course of destruction that can only be stopped by Spider-Man.Working from a story by ""Smallville""'s Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, and Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Chabon, Sam Raimi has crafted a sequel that far outshines its solid predecessor.  Maguire has made Peter Parker his own, and Alfred Molina breathes intelligent menace into Doc Ock.  The special effects, especially during the fight scenes, and incredible.  These are easily some of the best fight scenes ever put on film.  This is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone...the perfect summer blockbuster.And finally, mark your calendars for May 2007, when ""Spider-Man 3"" will hit theaters.  ""2"" will be difficult to top, but if Raimi continues to pour his passion for the character into the movies, he will have a good shot.

As the original film was racking in nearly $115 million in cash at the box office and smashing every box office record in the book, the ink was drying on the deal to develop two sequels for the comic-book superhero, with more to come gathering that the profit margin was still worth the high production price for Columbia Pictures. Unfortunately production for the highly anticipated sequel didn't start off on the right foot with Tobey Maguire, fresh off his new horse-racing drama, Seabiscuit, holding up the film's start date due to complaints about back problems. It didn't take long for the rumors to start churning out possible replacements, among which was the boyfriend of Kirsten Dunst, Jake Gyllenhaal. But, like the web-slinger he plays on the big screen, Tobey bounced back and in a small way, though inadvertently, he demonstrated one of the film's prominent themes.The story picks up near where the last film left off, only several months in difference, with Peter Parker balancing his personal life and the life of New York's favorite web crawler, Spider-Man. No one said the life of a superhero was going to be easy, though no one said it was going to be quite this hard either. Peter Parker tries as hard as he can to live a normal life but every time he's handed the opportunity to keep his promises, whether it be showing up to Mary Jane's performances, performing his job correctly or paying the rent, the role of Spider-Man gets in the way, thus allowing the one's that depend on him to suffer. As Peter does all he can to balance his two lives, those in the real world are moving on with theirs ... Mary Jane, tired of waiting for Peter to admit his true feelings for her, plans to marry the son of J.J. Jameson, a handsome and successful astronaut. Aunt May, struggling after the death of her husband, falls behind on her house payments and faces eviction from the bank if the late payments are met. Even his best friend, Harry Osborne, has moved on and taken over operations at Oscorp ... but the anger left by the death of his father at the hands of Spider-Man still remains and threatens to push him over the edge. The family business is all that keeps him on the level of sanity and Harry has big plans for Dr. Otto Octavius' new device to create and control fusion power, which, in essence, puts the power of the stars in the hands of mankind. But in a freak accident which results in the death of Octavius' wife and the fusion of the mechanical arms to his spine, Octavius goes on a rampage to finish his work, possibly taking half the city with him if he fails again. Just as he is beginning to enjoy the retirement he has taken from the superhero life, Peter Parker must again put on the suit and fulfill the promise he made to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who deserve it.The story for Spider-Man 2, though flawed, is without a doubt one of the best comic-book adaptations ever put on screen and excels beyond the expectations set not only by the original but every comic-book franchise that has come before it, including that of the winged one himself, Batman. As was said previously, the storyline is far from perfect and there are some noticeable flaws. Among them, the whole discussion of fusion power between Doctor Otto Octavius and Peter Parker in which they use strange and complex scientific vocabulary and theories is lost on the majority the movie-going public, unless you happen to be on the same level as these individuals but to be sure such people would be few and far between. Granted these individuals are meant to be in sync with the subject of science but since the discussion is so obscure, the audience is just meant to trust what they say, which takes away some of the attachment they are meant to have with the story. And there are moments within the film that seem to last a little longer then some would like them to, and, in part, seem to drag the film a bit, but they are easily forgiveable.Most, if not all, of the cast from the original film are back for another go-around and there is substantial improvement in their performances from the last time we saw them, though that can not be said of everyone. One performance that fails to disappoint is once again given by Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, or better known as Spider-Man. The non-superhero side of the character appears to get more screen time then in the original which isn't a bad thing. Maguire is given a lot more room to demonstrate emotionally what the character of Peter Parker is going through; at one end attempting to fulfill the promise he made to his Uncle Ben in the role of Spider-Man while at the same time trying to lead the life of a normal human being. Kirsten Dunst, returning to the role of Mary Jane Watson, gives another wonderful performance by maintaining the ""girl next door"" charm she had in the original film but at the same time demonstrating a character that is desperately yearning for something more. Crafted in such the perfect manner, Mary Jane is not another dimwitted damsel in distress as the connection between Spider-Man and Peter Parker slowly begins to develop in her mind. It's hard to say who's the better villain, the Green Goblin (who could forget that terrible costume) or Doc Ock, but even if Doctor Octavius' performance wasn't quite what everyone may have wanted it to be, Alfred Molina fits properly into the role. The only truly bad mark out of the entire cast belongs to James Franco, who drops the ball with his over the top and, at times, flat-out ridiculous performances as Harry Osborne. Rather the see the slow transformation of his impeding insanity, the audience notices the unbalanced behavior of Harry right off the bat and don't really sympathize with his situation, though the understanding of who his father really was may be also to blame. And just when you thought he was gone for good ... don't miss the quick, though wonderfully developed, cameo of William Dafoe as Norman Osborn, which, in turn, hints at the possible villain for the third film.Overall, Spider-Man 2 delivers most of what the hype and promotion promise, not only in the areas of spectacular special effects and an emotionally driven storyline, but in the film's enduring message of heroism and self-sacrifice. Before rounding off what made this sequel the fulfilling feature it was, let's focus on items that failed to live up to the rest of the film. First, the random shots of normal civilians, though some well placed, were mainly an annoyance. There is one specific shot, when Spider-Man (costume and all) makes his first appearance, where a woman shouts, ""You go, Spidey!"" ... this was humorous for the wrong reason and should have been left out, along with the several long focus shots of people screaming and running in terror. Not that they weren't needed but it was the amount of time Raimi used to focus on them that was the problem. Secondly, as was said earlier, it hard to determine whether the Green Goblin or Doctor Octavius is the better villain as Doc Ock isn't nearly as menacing as Goblin was, though he does offer up more action packed fight sequences in return. Depending on how you felt with the first film, this feature's villain could go either way. Third, some of the sequel's more subtle jokes, namely the homage to Butch Casidy and the Sundance Kid, are lost on the majority of the film's target audience, though they are quite humorous to those that know what they are referring to. And finally, the film's final sequence, in which the audience sees Spider-Man swinging between two helicopters over the rooftops of Manhattan on his way to another crime scene, is quite possibly one of the worse computer animated sequences presented this year and is a severe disappointment considering the sensational sequence the last film ended with. The problem is that the computer graphics are way too obvious and ends the film on quite a sour note considering most of the effects presented in the film were spectacular.Though the problems of Spider-Man 2 seem to significantly out weigh the good, the film's emotionally driven messages of self-sacrifice and heroism are what truly set this one apart from all the rest. Where the first film hammers the idea that even the most unlikely of individuals in this world can be heroes, the sequel drills home the belief that there is a hero is every one of us ... we just have to make the choice listen to the voice that lets it shine through if it means we have to give up on the things we want the most in life. It's easy to relate the idea of self-sacrifice with the fire and police departments of this country after the tragic events of September 11th but there is another aspect that many of us as Americans fail to respect or even recognize. Right now thousands of American troops are deployed overseas, either in Afghanistan or Iraq, bringing about freedom and opportunity in parts of the world that have not experienced such fundamental principles for over three decades ... they are risking their lives not only for the protection of the American people but to further the causes our founding fathers endowed upon us nearly three centuries ago. It is obvious that there are polarizing views in this country on the conflicts we find ourselves in but there once was a time in America's history where the people of this land looked upon the self-sacrificing men and women of the armed forces with respect and admiration, and, in a slightly smaller way, they still do today. But there are also the people who view these true ""heroes"" with anger and hatred, not understanding nor having the will to accept the good they are doing in the world, despite what many may say. Symbolism of this can be found in Spider-Man 2 and, like in the comic book adaptation, we believe that a time will come when frustration and hatred can be washed away to fully understand the reasoning behind their sacrifice, as well as the sacrifice of every ""superhero"" in this world ... to bring justice to those that deserve it.",4,The Moose Hole - The Amazing 'Spider-Man'

621327,A2BZUYR15ZYI29,B00005JMQW,Mike Awnson,"[0, 0]","And I stand by that statement completly. Spider-Man 2 is an amazing movie, that is essentially 3 movies wrapped in one. It is a romance, a super-hero movie, and an action packed movie all wrapped in one to create what we call Spider-Man 2. The movie starts off 2 years after the first movie. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is still in college, doing his Spier-Man deeds and getting heat for being late all of the time (new jobs, appointments etc.) Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still mourning over the death of his father, and wants revenge on Spider-Man, and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) still has sort of a crush on Peter, and is now doing plays and trying to make it big in her acting career.Throughout the movie there is alot of character development. You will see Harry and Peter's relationship grow from once great friends to hatred. you will see Harry as completely disgusted with Peter, especially because he takes pictures of his father's killer. Mary-Jane and Peter will also see character development with a new man in MJ's life.  These pieces of development add to the experience of Spider-Man 2 which adds so much to the great movie that it already is. The direction in the movie is great, not to mention the acting. James Franco does a great job with Harry Osborne. He is the true standout of the movie; acting wise and character wise.Overall Spider-Man 2 probably won't be the best movie of this year - but it is the best movie I have seen this year. It has amazing special effects, great directing and acting, and the story is second to none. Think - all of the hype times about two and that is truly how good this movie is. I reccomend this movie to anybody out there - but I also reccomend that you see the original Spider-Man before watching this one.",5,The Best Movie of 2004,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,1765,"['stand', 'statement', 'completly', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'amazing', 'movie', 'essentially', '3', 'movies', 'wrapped', 'one', 'romance', 'super-hero', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'one', 'create', 'what', 'call', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'movie', '2', 'years', 'first', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'still', 'college', 'doing', 'Spier-Man', 'deeds', 'getting', 'heat', 'being', 'late', 'time', 'new', 'jobs', 'appointments', 'etc', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'still', 'mourning', 'death', 'father', 'revenge', 'Spider-Man', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'still', 'sort', 'crush', 'Peter', 'now', 'doing', 'plays', 'trying', 'make', 'big', 'acting', 'career.Throughout', 'movie', 'alot', 'character', 'development', 'will', 'see', 'Harry', 'Peter', 'relationship', 'grow', 'once', 'great', 'friends', 'hatred', 'will', 'see', 'Harry', 'completely', 'disgusted', 'Peter', 'especially', 'pictures', 'father', 'killer', 'Mary-Jane', 'Peter', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'character', 'development', 'new', 'man', 'MJ', 'life', 'pieces', 'development', 'add', 'experience', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'movie', 'already', 'direction', 'movie', 'great', 'not', 'mention', 'acting', 'James', 'Franco', 'great', 'job', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'true', 'standout', 'movie', 'acting', 'wise', 'character', 'wise.Overall', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'directing', 'acting', 'story', 'second', 'none', 'Think', 'hype', 'times', 'two', 'truly', 'how', 'good', 'movie', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'anybody', 'there', 'also', 'reccomend', 'see', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'watching', 'one']",Spider-Man 2

Peter (Tobey Maguire) is finding it impossible to balance making a living, attending college, and being a superhero. There is no time at all for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and it looks as if Peter has lost her for good. With both his superpowers and his stamina for the leading a double life diminishing, Peter is frustrated and conflicted. His boyhood friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), now head of Oscorp, is determined to avenge the death of his father, for which he believes Spider-Man was responsible. In the meantime, Harry has high hopes for the invention of Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a scientist whose fusion machine promises to be a perpetual source of cheap energy for the world and a great success for Oscorp. But, when a demonstration of the fusion machine goes awry, Dr. Octavius is transformed into Doctor Octopus, a man-machine hybrid who goes on a rampage to finance rebuilding his dreams.""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man"" are consistent in style and tone, thanks to Sam Raimi's repeat directorial effort. ""Spider-Man 2"" is spared the necessity of introducing characters and providing backstory, so this film is more evenly paced and cohesive than ""Spider-Man"". It's more angsty, too. Peter Parker's internal struggles seem endless in this film, but, in retrospect, ""Spider-Man 2"" may simply be the ""conflicted"" chapter of the saga. We will have to see if ""Spider-Man 3"" brings a new theme. It has become obvious that Peter cannot balance his two lives, so the idea of choice and self-sacrifice becomes dominant in ""Spider-Man 2"". J.K. Simmons returns as J.

621332,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B00005JMQW,mitchell5954,"[0, 0]","Spiderman 2 is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman film that has come out so far.  That is not to say that the movie does not have its problems because it does.  However, despite its issues, this is the Spiderman film that, has the best effects, has the best action, has the most heart, and most importantly stays true to the spirit of the character the most.The story is as follows.  Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) has now been Spiderman for years now.  He is trying to balance his job as Spiderman and his normal life and is not doing very well.  The city hates Spiderman despite all the good he does.  He cannot hold a steady job, his grades are slipping, and he finds it difficult being there for his friends Harry Osborne (James Franco) and especially Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  Meanwhile a scientist named Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is trying to master this process called nuclear fusion in order to produce infinite and free energy for everyone.  However, his experiment fails which nearly destroys New York and he loses everything.  He then becomes the villain Doc Oc and attempts to try the experiment again.This film almost embodies Spiderman almost perfectly.  This is definitely Tobey McGuire&#8217;s best performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  I cannot say it is his best performance period because I haven&#8217;t seen all of his films, but it is definitely his best performance as this character.  This film really captures Spiderman and people love him even now.  Everyone hates Spiderman and regard him as a criminal despite all the good he does, him trying to balance his life as Spiderman and his personal life, and no matter what he does things just never seem to go his way.  That&#8217;s Spiderman and that&#8217;s what made him so relatable in the comics and why so many people gravitated towards him even to this day.They also handle Harry and his ark perfectly.  In this film he is still trying to get revenge on Spiderman for &#8220;killing&#8221; his father in the last film.  This has become an obsession it virtually consumes his life where he does nothing else.  At the end of the film you see where that ultimately leads him.Rosemary Harries gives an amazing performance as Aunt May like in the last, except she is even better here.  The scenes where Peter is talking to her about Uncle Ben&#8217;s death and when she gives her speech about heroes they are amazing and the best scenes in the movie.  I do not care what anybody says, Rosemary Harris is Aunt May not the one from Amazing Spiderman.Doc Oc, I think, they actually improved upon from the comics.  In the comics he is just a stereotypical mad scientist with four robotic arms.  In the film they make him for of a three-dimensional character.  He has a noble goal, to create renewable energy for all.  After his experiment fail he loses everything; his reputation, his wife, and his dream.  You can see why he goes off the deep end and tries the experiment again.  He has nothing left but his dream.  You can feel sympathy for him and see where he is coming from which are almost always the best villains.The action is also top notch in this.  This film has the best action scenes of all the Spiderman films.  Spiderman 3 had some great action as well but this, in my opinion, still takes the cake.  The fight between Spiderman and Doc Oc on the clock tower and the train are phenomenal.  It is the best fight in the entire franchise.  The effects are amazing and really help make the action amazing.  Some of the effects in the original were a bit off which hurt the action a little.  The effects in Spiderman 2 beat the crap out of almost all the other films including the new ones, which is sad.  Spiderman 3 had slightly better effects but is still quite close.The film, however, is not without its faults.  The film, while coming close, does not capture Spiderman perfectly.  Spiderman still does not use his wit enough.  He does use it but not often enough.  Mary Jane is still a very poorly written character.  I still think Kirsten Dunst, while a good actress, is miscast.  This Mary Jane is still not like the Mary Jane from the comics, is still annoying, and is still just there to be Peter&#8217;s token love interest and the person he saves.  She also comes off as a bit selfish in this film as well.  It is not as bad as the third film but is still annoying.There is also the plot point of her and Jameson&#8217;s son.  That goes nowhere.  I am not too familiar with the Spiderman comics but I think he had a bigger role there.  Here he is simply a throw-away character.  Weak!The plot-point of Spiderman losing his powers, while not, seems a little weird to me.  Not-to-mention it is ripped-off wholeheartedly from another film.  I swear Sam Raimi ripped off Hayao Miyazaki.  The same plot point was used in the 1989 Miyazaki animated film Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service which is an awesome movie by the way.  You have a young witch named Kiki coming to town to start her witch training.  She is trying to find her place but she has a hard time fitting in.  Eventually that outsider feeling gets the best of her and she loses her witch powers.  Sound familiar!  It does not bother me too much since I saw Spiderman 2 before Kiki, but I still find that quite amusing.  I wonder if it was because of Kirsten Dunst.  Dunst who plays Mary Jane in these movies also voiced Kiki in the dub of Kiki&#8217;s Delivery Service which is her best performance in my opinion.  Did she have some creative input she was not credited for?Overall, Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman film easily.  If you are a fan of Spiderman then definitely see this film.  It has great action, great effects, great story, and it comes closest to the characters in the comics than any of the other films.  You really do not even need to watch the first movie before this.  I would recommend you do, but it is not required to understand this.  This film is pretty self-contained.",4,The Best Spiderman Film So Far!,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,5952,"['Spiderman', '2', 'doubt', 'best', 'Spiderman', 'film', 'come', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'not',

621333,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B00005JMQW,Mitch Weaver,"[0, 1]","Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is trying to lead a normal life, despite the fact that he is still taking on the responsibility of being Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the stress of his alter-ego is making him have a difficult time of doing so. The love of his life Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) has now become engaged to another man, and is trying to move on with her life from when she had feelings for Peter and was ultimately rejected by him. To make matters worse, Peter slowly begins to lose his superpowers, which makes him question if being Spider-Man is the right life for him. Peter decides to hang up the suit and never perform another duty as Spider-Man to pursue a normal life and win Mary Jane's heart. Things do not go as planned however, when a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) into a supervillan refered to as ""Doc Ock"" who has four metal tentacles coming out of him. Now with Doc Ock on the loose, Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him. But things become interesting however, when Peter's best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco) puts a price on Spider-Man's head to gain revenge for the death of his father Norman, and Doc Ock willingly accepts.I was extremely skeptical regarding Spider-Man 2 because sequels often fail to live up to the first film. However, due to the fact that I am a huge fan of the superhero genre, and since the first Spider-Man film was so enjoyable, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give this film a shot. I was literally blown away by how good the film turned out to be. Not only was it more enjoyable than the first film, but I can honestly say that it is the best superhero film that I have ever seen beating out Batman, Superman, and X2. The reason that Spider-Man 2 is such a cut above the rest is because of the acting and the amazing special effects. I also love watching the story unfold in this film. It has a menacing villan in Doc Ock and gives a well rounded look at the hero of the story by offering excellent character development with both Peter Parker and his alter-ego Spider-Man. Peter has to struggle with losing his powers, facing a very formidable advissary in Doc Ock, as well as trying to lead a normal life, win Mary Jane's heart, and keep his identity secret from his best friend Harry who holds his alter-ego responsible for killing his father. Tobey Mcguire was absolutely brilliant in the role of Peter Parker and made the super Spider-Man seem believingly human and easy to relate to. Watching Peter Parker struggle to have a normal life was my favorite aspect of the film. Alfred Molina deserves a round of applause for his portrayal of Doc Ock. Molina has openly admitted that this was not the usual type of character that he plays, and that is what impressed me so much with his performance. He was downright menacing in the role.Overall, I feel that Spider-Man 2 is the best superhero film that I have ever seen. The incredible acting, amazing special effects, and well rounded story all make this film extremely enjoyable. The 2 disc DVD is jam packed full of special features that include a blooper reel, three featurettes, and much more.A solid 5/5...",5,The best superhero film I've ever seen,1102291200,"12 6, 2004",2004,3169,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'trying', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'fact', 'still', 'taking', 'responsibility', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'Unfortunately', 'stress', 'alter-ego', 'making', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'doing', 'so', 'love', 'life', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'now', 'become', 'engaged', 'man', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'when', 'had', 'feelings', 'Peter', 'was', 'ultimately', 'rejected', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Peter', 'slowly', 'lose', 'superpowers', 'question', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'right', 'life', 'Peter', 'hang', 'up', 'suit', 'never', 'perform', 'duty', 'Spider-Man', 'pursue', 'normal', 'life', 'win', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'heart', 'Things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'however', 'when', 'freak', 'accident', 'transforms', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'supervillan', 'refered', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'who', 'four', 'metal', 'tentacles', 'coming', 'Now', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'loose', 'Peter', 'only', 'Spider-Man', 'can', 'stop', 'things', 'become', 'interesting', 'however', 'when', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'James', 'Franco', 'price', 'Spider-Man', 'head', 'gain', 'revenge', 'death', 'father', 'Norman', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'willingly', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'regarding', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'sequels', 'often', 'fail', 'live', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'However', 'due', 'fact', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'superhero', 'genre', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'decided', 'put', 'skepticism', 'aside', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'was', 'literally', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'good', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'best', 'superhero', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'beating', 'out', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'X2', 'reason', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'cut', 'rest', 'acting', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'also', 'love', 'watching', 'story', 'unfold', 'film', 'menacing', 'villan', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'well', 'rounded', 'look', 'hero', 'story', 'offering', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'alter-ego', 'Spider-Man', 'Peter', 'struggle', 'losing', 'powers', 'facing', 'very', 'formidable', 'advissary', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'win', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'heart', 'keep', 'identity', 'secret', 'best', 'friend', 'Harry', 'who', 'alter-ego', 'responsible', 'killing', 'father', 'Tobey', 'Mcguire', 'was', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'made', 'super', 'Spider-Man', 'seem', 'believingly', 'human', 'easy', 'relate', 'Watching', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'struggle', 'have', 'normal', 'life', 'was', 'favorite', 'aspect', 'film', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'round', 'applause', 'portrayal', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Molina', 'openly', 'admitted', 'was', 'not', 'usual', 'type', 'character', 'what', 'impressed', 'so', 'much', 'performance', 'was', 'downright', 'menacing', 'role.Overall', 'feel', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'best', 'superhero', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'incredible', 'acting', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'well', 'rounded', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'jam', 'packed', 'full', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'blooper', 'reel', 'three', 'featurettes', 'much', 'more.A', 'solid', '5/5']",Spider-Man 2

In the opening munites of ""Spiderman 2,"" the thrilling and deeper sequel to the wide-eyed original, Perter Parker (Tobey Maguire) loses his job, ruins his laundry, gets behind on his rent and finds he is still living in a low-rent apartment with a nosy tenant.  Life sucks, even for a revered Superhero.  All Peter Parker wants to do is finish his college work, meet with one of his idols Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) and especially enter into a meaningful engagement with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and keep a devastating secret from his best friend, harry Osbourne (James Franco).  But of course, he must always save the world.  Soon however, he must fight Octavious as his demented alter-ego Dr. Octopus comes to the service with a vengence, and Mary Jane gets engaged to someone else.This is ambiguous and heavy stuff, especially for a big-budget summer action flick (and a huge action flick, with a budget of $200 million).  But director Sam Raimi and screenwriter Alvin Sargeant have higher goals.  They stick to the story and tone of the comic books,  giving the film has a sense of integrity and rich charcter development that elevate to the realm of greatness.  The quiet moments have tha same amount of impact has the big ones, but Raimi does not hesitate to pull out all the stops for the action sequences, seamlessly combining CGI, puppetry and Billl Popes' astounding camera work into one adreanalized package.  Spidey's battle with Doc Ock are breathtaking, climaxing in an above-ground train fight that leaves one absolutley brain-boggled.

And after hearing everyone talk about how this is one of the best superhero movies around, I figured I'd give it a shot though the first Spidey film didn't impress me much.Well, this is a pretty bad movie.  Scratch that.  It's not bad.  It's just not very good.  And it's damn annoying.  If this is what people think makes a good comic book movie (including people who read comics) then I guess I must read them for different reasons.To begin with, I only liked one character in the whole film.  Doctor Octopus as portrayed by Alfred Molina was an exceptional character, alternately likable, sinister, and tragic.  As for the rest of these whiny narcissistic babies, all I can say is yuck.  Toby Macguirer's portrayal of Peter Parker is a complete and utter loser who has no self-esteem, common sense, or personality.  He just mopes.  MJ is just as bad, being a terrible friend who is primarily concerned with herself.  And Norman Osbourne is willing to put his friends' lives and the whole city in danger in his obsessive desire to kill Spider-Man.  J. Jonah Jamesone comes across as a walking cartoon.I also just didn't care for the story.  Of course, Peter Parker would have no life if he went chasing after every siren he heard.  NEWSFLASH:  Maybe it's just a speeder, Spidey.  The cops can handle some stuff without you.  Also, a ""Life of Responsibility"" doesn't mean giving up your own life.  Cops, soldiers, and firemen seem to do okay on that end.  And the notions of love explored in the film are childish and just plain silly.Spidey in the comics was never this immature.  Please, do not judge all comics by this rather silly film.On the plus side, I did really like the action sequences.  Much better than the short and unremarkable moments in Spider Man 1.

This movie is much talkier and focuses in on the drama a lot more than the action. Some of the smaller children in the theater were getting restless for pretty much the whole film due to the little amount of physical action happening on the screen. Don't get me wrong there are some great action scenes, but they are spread thinly throughout this two hour plus film. Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus is great in terms of acting and is way cooler looking than that stupid Green Goblin outfit from the first film. Doc Ock is truly a memorable villian. Tobey and Kirsten are very good as well, but J.K. Simmons once again steal the show as the newspaper boss and thankfully gets a much bigger role in this movie. I also loved the opening credit sequence that fills you in on Spider-Man part one and the almost horror movie style done when Doc Ock is killing about 10 doctors with his tentacles while escaping from the hospital. The ending with Harry finding his father's glider and weapons was really pretty neat, but I just hope Spider-Man 3 has another villian to go with the not so interesting James Franco as the new Green Goblin.

I will add some simple comments about this movie.Firstly, the beginning of the movie seemed to dwell on the ""troubled hero"" issue for a very long time. While some of this was undoubtedly central to the character of Pete, I felt that it was dragged out for too long. It became somewhat monotonous in the end.However, once the action started, the movie really entered its own league. THe villian, Doc Ock, was awesome and well-played by Alfred Molina, bringing his own sense of internal conflict to the plot.The visual effects are astounding and greatly add to the overall feel of the movie. Also, as a minor point, the Editor provided some nice comic relief, as always. He was not uproariously funny, but he was amusing in his own stingy, opportunistic ways.Overall, a good film with some minor issues not mentioned.

621342,A2TSNKXQGBMVAQ,B00005JMQW,Moven,"[5, 9]","It's a bit of an understatement to say that Spider-man 2 is the most exciting film I saw in theaters this year. As far as I'm concerned, Spider-man 2 is in the same ballpark as The Empire Strikes back in terms of sequels. Everything that the first Spider-man did was expanded upon and polished to the point of perfection. And yes, as many people have already said, this is by far the best comic book movie ever.I thoroughly enjoyed the first Spider-man, but I'm afraid it just can't compete with the second. Spider-man 2 is the type of movie we all hope for but rarely get. It really is something of a masterpiece. The writing, the acting, the special effects... it's all beautiful. I was astounded by the character development. We usually don't see arcs like this in action films. I was moved, to say the least, by the intertwined fates of Peter Parker, Dr. Octavius, and Harry Osborn. And these three characters are played perfectly by Tobey Maguire, Alfred Molina, and James Franco. I was particularly surprised by the screen presence of James Franco. He stepped up to the plate and hit a home run here, delivering a breakout performance sure to merit him great roles in the bright future he has ahead. And I don't mean to single him out; all the returning cast members perform even better than they did in the first film. Everyone put in work here.Sam Raimi's vision is fulfilled in Spider-man 2. The film flows with sublime efficiency, never losing its cool and never blowing its top. Thanks to the astronomical budget Raimi was allotted (over 200 million dollars) to make the film, the special effects are astounding. I remember hearing many complaints about some of the special effects in the first Spider-man, but there is absolutely nothing to complain about here. From the clock tower battle to the insanely exciting runaway train scene, I was utterly thrilled. So thrilled was I during the runaway train scene that I couldn't help but break into a cold sweat (I'm not lying).I have to take some time out here to talk about the character development. The screenwriters did such a great job here. It just blows my mind. The struggles of Peter Parker here are so easy to relate to, the sympathy I felt for Spider-man was real. In fact, I was so moved by Parker's struggles that I couldn't help but cry tears of joy for him at the victorious conclusion of the film, which is nothing short of majestic. And, not to forget Harry and Doc Ock, whom I had no difficulty sympathizing for, even as villains.This is a comic book movie, people! And these characters are real people with real problems! So gratifying is it to be so thrilled and so moved from one film that I'm really at a loss for words. This DVD is essential. Movies don't get much better than this. I cannot wait to see the direction the third Spider-man goes.Oh well... until then, I've got Spider-man 2 to watch!Spider-man 2 is without a doubt one of the best films of 2004.",5,Will this ever be topped???,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,2942,"['bit', 'understatement', 'say', 'Spider-man', '2', 'most', 'exciting', 'film', 'saw', 'theaters', 'year', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Spider-man', '2', 'same', 'ballpark', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'back', 'terms', 'sequels', 'Everything', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'did', 'was', 'expanded', 'polished', 'point', 'perfection', 'yes', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'far', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'ever.I', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'Spider-man', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'second', 'Spider-man', '2', 'type', 'movie', 'hope', 'rarely', 'get', 'really', 'something', 'masterpiece', 'writing', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'beautiful', 'was', 'astounded', 'character', 'development', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'arcs', 'action', 'films', 'was', 'moved', 'say', 'least', 'intertwined', 'fates', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'James', 'Franco', 'was', 'particularly', 'surprised', 'screen', 'presence', 'James', 'Franco', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'hit', 'home', 'run', 'here', 'delivering', 'breakout', 'performance', 'sure', 'merit', 'great', 'roles', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'single', 'out', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'perform', 'even', 'better', 'did', 'first', 'film', 'Everyone', 'put', 'work', 'here.Sam', 'Raimi', 'vision', 'fulfilled', 'Spider-man', '2', 'film', 'sublime', 'efficiency', 'never', 'losing', 'cool', 'never', 'blowing', 'top', 'Thanks', 'astronomical', 'budget', 'Raimi', 'was', 'allotted', '200', 'million', 'dollars', 'make', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'astounding', 'remember', 'hearing', 'many', 'complaints', 'special', 'effects', 'first', 'Spider-man', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'complain', 'here', 'clock', 'tower', 'battle', 'insanely', 'exciting', 'runaway', 'train', 'scene', 'was', 'utterly', 'thrilled', 'So', 'thrilled', 'was', 'runaway', 'train', 'scene', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'break', 'cold', 'sweat', ""'m"", 'not', 'lying', 'have', 'take', 'time', 'out', 'here', 'talk', 'character', 'development', 'screenwriters', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'here', 'just', 'blows', 'mind', 'struggles', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'easy', 'relate', 'sympathy', 'felt', 'Spider-man', 'was', 'real', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'Parker', 'struggles', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cry', 'tears', 'joy', 'victorious', 'conclusion', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'majestic', 'not', 'forget', 'Harry', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'whom', 'had', 'difficulty', 'sympathizing', 'even', 'villains.This', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'people', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'problems', 'So', 'gratifying', 'be', 'so', 'thrilled', 'so', 'moved', 'one', 'film', ""'m"", 'really', 'loss', 'words', 'DVD', 'essential', 'Movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'direction', 'third', 'Spider-man', 'goes.Oh', 'well', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Spider-man', '2', 'watch', 'Spider-man', '2', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2004']",Spider-Man 2

621344,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,B00005JMQW,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[0, 1]","Two years ago, I saw Spider-Man on its opening day. In my opinion, it was an average movie; there were several good action scenes but it wasn't anything special. I was greatly surprised when the movie grossed over 114 million on its opening weekend. Probably because of the movie's success, Columbia decided to do a sequel. Going into Spider-Man 2, I thought it would be a disappointment. Sequels were usually worse than the original and the original wasn't all that good. Boy oh boy was I wrong. Not only is Spider-Man 2 an excellent sequel but it also almost destroys the stereotype that sequels are bad.Spider-Man 2 continues where the original left. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is desperately trying to cope with being Spider-Man and living his everyday life. His superhero ways have led to him to lose a job, to see his grades fall, and to find himself drifting apart from the people he loves. Meanwhile, one of Peter's best friends, Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of Norman Osborn (the Green Goblin who Spider-Man faced in the original) is conducting an experiment with Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) to use fusion to build mechanical arms that can be operated by the brain. Harry wants Spider-Man dead after the murder of his father and his goal throughout the movie becomes to find the hero and unmask him. Anyway, Peter is invited to the experiment, in which Octavius explains that this thingy in the back of the device will make sure that he controls the arms and that they don't control him. Well, as you have probably guessed, the experiment goes wrong and the thingy breaks. Doctor Octavius becomes Doctor Octopus A.K.A. Doc Ock. As Doc Ock begins his reign of evil, it's up to Spider-Man to stop him. But there's another problem; struggling with his personal problems, Peter decides to stop being Spider-Man. Will he realize that the city needs him or will he forget about his life as a superhero?The story in Spider-Man 2 isn't very original and parts of it seem taken from Spider-Man. Nonetheless, you almost forgot it as you're watching the film. Acting is the same; none of the performances are Oscar-worthy but aren't so bad that you aren't able to identify with the characters. Sam Raimi truly shows off his directional skills here. There are a couple of great shots. Visuals are just as good and the special effects are a large improvement over the originals.Overall, Spider-Man 2 is the perfect popcorn summer flick. There is never a dull moment in this movie and it moves fast and quick. The movie lasts for more than two hours but it passes a lot quicker than that. The fight sequences are also a sight for the eyes and should appeal to any action fan. Perhaps the best part of Spider-Man 2 is how it has the perfect mix of stylized action and story. In fact, there's probably more story than action. Spider-Man 2 is five times better than the first and it deserves to be seen. It has everything a movie should have: a conflict that results in some action sequences, a moving story with great performances, some comedy tossed in to lighten the mood, brilliant visual effects, and excellent directing.If you haven't seen Spider-Man 2, stop reading this review, run out, and get tickets.

I guess we in the UAE were lucky to watch it along with American cinemagoers, and rather not druel over and wait impatiently for it for a month or so.Tobey Maguire is the true Hero Spiderman. All audiences who will or have watched Spiderman II would say that no other actor can star better than Tobey Maguire. Though I may have thought like others that Raimi made a bad choice in choosing Tobey in Spiderman I, but he really did shine up the role in II. Spiderman is actually written on all over his face. I hope Sam Raimi offers him the role of Peter P/Spiderman in Part III despite his bad back. Cinemagoers will notice a 90 degrees clockwise S scar on his right cheek. Alot of Character development was done on the role of peter in preparation of Part III. Part III will be more of a ultimate showdown.As far as the movie is concerned, it was better than Part I. This time we see more of Peter Parker and his issues with life (his superhero role of Spiderman, college education and MJ, the love of his life). There are some choices that he has got to make. There is also a very special HERO other than spiderman in the movie, I wont mention who. The Spiderman II xperience was very entertaining.I do really love the Train sequence.

It's a short list of successful superhero adaptations.Sam Raimi was firing on all cylinders when he made this movie. The result is solid action-adventure with well developed characters that pull you into the story and keep you emotionally invested. The action choreography is stunning and the special effects are polished. Spider-Man 2 has a talented cast that really brings this story to life - with Alfred Molina being a particularly inspired choice to play Dr. Otto Octavious and J.K. Simmons delivering a larger-than-life J.Jonah Jameson. Some serious writing skill is in evidence here - the story has excellent pacing and a great sense of increasing stakes. There are moments of emotional gravity, but the tone remains light while delivering the goods at the ""big moments"" - just like a summer movie should.Some nice cinematography really makes the most out of some truly inspired set pieces and it's all edited together rather elegantly.

621352,AZ2K08MNJFR16,B00005JMQW,"N. Chiemelu ""movie slave""","[17, 51]","I watched Spiderman 2 about 2 or 3 months after it came out so I read and heard all the amazing reviews.  Yet, after watching it, I still for the life of me cannot understand why everyone hails that this is better than the first and even the best comic book movie of all time (X2 or Batman Returns still hold that title in my comic book).  Bear with me people, as the only voice of dissension among the crowd, this review is going to be long:1) ""With great power, comes a great need to whine for 2 hours...""  Having superpowers is something unavoidable, it was accidental and Peter can't avoid it or get rid of it, though he does lose it temporarily in the movie.  Yet being Spiderman is entirely by choice so I cannot sympathize and I'm not really sure why the audience is expected to, for Peter when he can't balance his life as both Spiderman and Peter Parker.  No one asks you to put on a costume and go out and fight crime, dear boy.  There are these people called police officers, who are paid to do it.  Go do your homework.  After an hour of useless scene after scene of ""Peter can't catch a break""  ""woe is Peter"", I was ready to gag.  That brings me to...2) Two hour plus movie which easily could have been trimmed down by at least 20 minutes.  There were so many superfluous scenes in there that served no purpose but to drive the point home that Peter's life sucks and he is a loser.  Okay, we get it.  Despite the fact that the story of Spiderman/Peter Parker was already established in the first movie and also known through basic pop culture, thank you writers (one including my favorite author/Pulitzer Prize winner, Michael Chabon.  was he actually involved in this movie?  I can't believe that) for beating the dead horse that is Peter's miserable life.  I mean, just one of the many instances, the cake scene with the landlord's daughter??  I literally spent a good 5 minutes afterwards trying to figure out why that didn't end up on the cutting room floor.  My only conclusion was that she is the daughter or mistress of a powerful producer whose money was involved in the making of this movie.  I understand that children are going to watch this movie, but the repetitive and unnecessary scenes of Peter's bad luck/misfortune were way too much.3) Um...action, where'd you go?  Did anyone notice how nothing happened for a good half hour to 45 minutes expect for lots of whining?  I understand you need to draw out a story and set up the plot but come on.  Compared to the first movie, this movie had very little action in it and the much-hyped subway scene fell into sentimental drivel at the end...4) what was up with literally everyone in New York City discovering his secret identity in like the last 10 minutes of the movie.  Who's idea was it to throw that in?5) I really wish they had used more James Franco (Harry Osbourne) his character is so rich and complex and his bitch-slapping Peter at the party gave me such great pleasure because I felt like doing that throughout watching the whole movie.6)Otto Octavius.  First off, I feel Willem Dafoe (amazing actor) got a bad rep in the first movie.  Everyone says he was terrible, I thought he was great.  I also think the characters of Doc Ock is just like the Green Goblin.  Essentially good man, plagued by another personality of his own invention (mechanical arms/goblin gas).  The mirror scene in the first movie where Osbourne plays himself and the goblin was great.  Also Doc Ock's dialogue was so corny, I wanted to retch.7) I will give props to Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) who is much better in the second movie.  She was awful in the first in my opinion and JK Simmons who steals every scene he's in especially in the last scene where MJ doesn't show up at the altar.  (sorry if I just ruined that for someone) that was hilarious!8) Speaking of which, the whole standing the groom up at the altar/running to Peter in her wedding dress.  Wow, so original!  The character of Mary Jane, who in the comic books, is smart, independent and doesn't take any of Peter's wishy/washy b.s. is reduced to villain bait and pretty much a village bicycle in this movie (she's passed around more times than the hors d'ouveres at the party, geez!).Okay, I could go on but I think you get the point.  Spiderman 2 in my opinion was no better than the first, and for the most part was hokey, sentimental drivel that came off more as an afterschool special than a comic book movie.  *Sigh!*  I only hope that Batman Begins (June 17 people!) with Memento's Chris Nolan and Christopher Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, etc. will show everyone what a good superhero movie is supposed to be like.  (Here's hoping Katie Holmes doesn't ruin the aforementioned flawless casting).",3,Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,4753,"['watched', 'Spiderman', '2', '2',

Durham ""Big Evil""","[16, 27]","With a more character driven plot and bigger tools at their disposal, director Sam Raimi and his crew have gone above and beyond the first Spider-Man film; crafting what some have hailed as the best comic adaptation of all time.  While I don't think Spider-Man 2 deserves that tagline (that honor goes to X2: X-Men United), the film sure is something special as more depth is given to Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, ever perfect) as he struggles between being a super hero and his love for Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) as a new foe emerges.  The entire cast excels here like never before, with Alfred Molina perfect as the tragic Doctor Octopus (who is a shockingly better villain than Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin) and James Franco's Harry Osborn slowly descending into madness and vengeance as the stage is set for a third film.  The only real problem with Spider-Man 2 is that at times it can get too dramatic for it's own good, but the movie manages to keep steaming along as we see Spidey get pushed to his limits like never before.  It's definitely worth seeing, and even jaded web-heads will admire the film.",4,Much better than the first film,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,1109,"['more', 'character', 'driven', 'plot', 'bigger', 'tools', 'disposal', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'crew', 'have', 'gone', 'above', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'film', 'crafting', 'what', 'have', 'hailed', 'best', 'comic', 'adaptation', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'deserves', 'tagline', 'honor', 'X2', 'X-Men', 'United', 'film', 'sure', 'something', 'special', 'more', 'depth', 'given', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'ever', 'perfect', 'being', 'super', 'hero', 'love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'new', 'foe', 'entire', 'cast', 'excels', 'here', 'like', 'never', 'before', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'perfect', 'tragic', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'who', 'shockingly', 'better', 'villain', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'James', 'Franco', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'slowly', 'descending', 'madness', 'vengeance', 'stage', 'set', 'third', 'film', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'times', 'can', 'get', 'too', 'dramatic', 'own', 'good', 'movie', 'keep', 'steaming', 'along', 'see', 'Spidey', 'get', 'pushed', 'limits', 'never', 'before', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'even', 'jaded', 'web-heads', 'will', 'admire', 'film']",Spider-Man 2
621354,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B00005JMQW,Negative Comments,"[0, 0]","It would be way too predictable for me to use an exaggeration here like, ""since this is better than the first, and I gave the first one a 10 out of 10, then I'm giving part 2 a 15 out of 10!!"" I won't quite say that. There's only one movie that deserves such an outrageous claim of actually scoring OUTSIDE the scale of numbers allotted for the rating, and that's Back to the Future part 1. Sorry, I got a off on a tangent, Spike Lee style. Back to Spider-Man 2.This truly outdoes the first movie in terms of scale. And I guess that's how it works, you tell the origin story, after that you're free to explore different themes in that universe you've created. I don't like to use this word to describe a lot of things, but truly only one word describes this movie: epic.There's a single driving force in this movie that instantly gets you worrying, and hoping for a good outcome: Peter Parker's tragic downfall, or to be more specific, him hitting ROCK BOTTOM with Mary Jane. He literally lost it all here at one point in this movie. I mean it doesn't get anymore serious than being told ""Oh, I'm getting married.."" As if that weren't enough, he couldn't even be in her life as a friend because of his constant disappointments he caused her because of his responsibilities as Spider-Man. Add to that his stressful friendship with Harry, his identity crisis, and you've got a pretty complex story, superhero action movie or not.**You feel the full spectrum of emotions in this movie. Or at the very least, you feel the maximum emotion at one part of the spectrum, sympathy. I've said it already and I'll say it again, Peter Parker's crumbling relationship with Mary Jane was executed perfectly. There's two scenes that captures this feeling of desperation perfectly:1) At that dinner party thing they were at, Peter gets hit with a 3 part combo: A) his friendship with Harry takes a further dive after being slapped by him twice, B) his friendship with Mary Jane takes a further dive after being told by her while they were outside on the balcony that she pretty much doesn't want anything to do with him anymore, in so many words, and finally, not too long after, C) gets hit with the ultimate crushing blow as he hears the announcement that Mary Jane officially agreed to marry her boyfriend. I think anyone can imagine how embarrassed, humiliated, and heartbroken Peter must've felt standing there, as his world slowed down to a dreamlike state, vaguely hearing J. Jonah Jameson shouting to him to snap a picture of none other than Mary Jane and her new fianc&eacute;.2) After falling to the ground after his webs failed him again, he picks up that newspaper and sees how he's hated by the city and gets no appreciation, with the scene then cutting to him sitting on his bed, tossing that paper away in disgust. It's at this point that we're on the edge of our seats, just wondering what he's gonna do next. His life was a complete tragedy.**Amazing, lengthy action sequences.**A sympathetic villain, much better than Green Goblin.**It takes a certain expert hand to be able to have lines spoken by one character (Aunt May), then have those very same lines repeated by another character (Peter) to another character (Doc Ock), which is what finally gets that other character to see the error of his ways, all without seeming forced or convenient. There's certain elements of the plot that do seem convenient, but it's never contrived or forced. It's like a complex tapestry that all fits together and makes sense somehow.**If I had it my way, I'd change the ending. I think it would've struck a better emotional chord had they ended it with the scene of Mary Jane hugging her fianc&eacute;, after being dropped off by Spider-Man, as she sadly looks up to her love that would never be, as he then shoots out a web and flys off into the night. It would've been a great place to end, the music was PERFECT right at that instant she looked up into the sky at him, with that bright light illuminating her face. This angelic, melodic tone or music, whatever that was that played. Either end it there and move the scene with Harry and his father up BEFORE this scene (because you can't skip the Harry scene no matter how you end it), OR, end right after the Harry scene, after discovering all the Green Goblin equipment. Have that whole cancelled wedding and running scene be the START of part 3 (obviously it's too late for that). I guess the argument for keeping it the way it was shot is the fact that you then wouldn't have the shot of Mary Jane in Peter's window, looking out with a look that you can't quite tell if it's happiness or fear, in regards to her new life.",5,"I gave the first one a 10 out of 10, this one is even better",1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,4668,"['would', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'use', 'exaggeration', 'here', 'better', 'first', 'gave', 'first', 'one', '10', '10', 'then', ""'m"", 'giving', 'part', '2', '15', '10', 'wo', ""n't"", 'quite', 'say', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'outrageous', 'claim', 'actually', 'scoring', 'scale', 'numbers', 'allotted', 'rating', 'Back', 'Future', 'part', '1', 'Sorry', 'got', 'off', 'tangent', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'style', 'Back', 'Spider-Man', '2.This', 'truly', 'first', 'movie', 'terms', 'scale', 'guess', 'how', 'tell', 'origin', 'story', ""'re"", 'free', 'explore', 'different', 'themes', 'universe', ""'ve"", 'created', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'use', 'word', 'describe', 'lot', 'things', 'truly', 'only', 'one', 'word', 'movie', 'single', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'instantly', 'worrying', 'hoping', 'good', 'outcome', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'tragic', 'downfall', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'hitting', 'ROCK', 'BOTTOM', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'literally', 'lost', 'here', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'mean', ""n't"", 'get', 'anymore', 'serious', 'being', 'told', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'getting', 'married..', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'life', 'friend', 'constant', 'disappointments', 'caused', 'responsibilities', 'Spider-Man', 'Add', 'stressful', 'friendship', 'Harry', 'identity', 'crisis', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'complex', 'story', 'superhero', 'action', 'movie', 'not', '**You', 'feel', 'full', 'spectrum', 'emotions', 'movie', 'very', 'least', 'feel', 'maximum', 'emotion', 'one', 'part', 'spectrum', 'sympathy', ""'ve"", 'said', 'already', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'crumbling', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'was', 'executed', 'perfectly', 'two', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'desperation', 'perfectly:1', 'dinner', 'party', 'thing', 'were', 'Peter', 'hit', '3', 'part', 'combo', 'friendship', 'Harry', 'further', 'dive', 'being', 'slapped', 'twice', 'B', 'friendship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'further', 'dive', 'being', 'told', 'were', 'outside', 'balcony', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'anymore', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'finally', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'C', 'hit', 'ultimate', 'crushing', 'blow', 'announcement', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'officially', 'agreed', 'marry', 'boyfriend', 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'embarrassed', 'humiliated', 'heartbroken', 'Peter', 'must', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'standing', 'there', 'world', 'slowed', 'down', 'dreamlike', 'state', 'vaguely', 'hearing', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'shouting', 'snap', 'picture', 'none', 'other', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'new', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'falling', 'ground', 'webs', 'failed', 'again', 'up', 'newspaper', 'how', 'hated', 'city', 'appreciation', 'scene', 'then', 'cutting', 'sitting', 'bed', 'tossing', 'paper', 'away', 'disgust', 'point', ""'re"", 'edge', 'seats', 'just', 'wondering', 'what', 'gon', 'do', 'next', 'life', 'was', 'complete', 'tragedy', '**Amazing', 'lengthy', 'action', 'sequences', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'much', 'better', 'Green', 'Goblin', '**It', 'certain', 'expert', 'hand', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'lines', 'spoken', 'one', 'character', 'Aunt', 'May', 'then', 'have', 'very', 'same', 'lines', 'repeated', 'character', 'Peter', 'character', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'what', 'finally', 'other', 'character', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'seeming', 'forced', 'convenient', 'certain', 'elements', 'plot', 'do', 'seem', 'convenient', 'never', 'contrived', 'forced', 'complex', 'tapestry', 'together', 'sense', 'somehow', '**If', 'had', 'way', ""'d"", 'change', 'ending', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'struck', 'better', 'emotional', 'chord', 'had', 'ended', 'scene', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'hugging', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'being', 'dropped', 'off', 'Spider-Man', 'sadly', 'up', 'love', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'then', 'out', 'web', 'flys', 'off', 'night', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'place', 'end', 'music', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'right', 'instant', 'looked', 'up', 'sky', 'bright', 'light', 'illuminating', 'face', 'angelic', 'melodic', 'tone', 'music', 'was', 'played', 'end', 'move', 'scene', 'Harry', 'father', 'up', 'scene', 'ca', ""n't"", 'skip', 'Harry', 'scene', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'end', 'OR', 'end', 'right', 'Harry', 'scene', 'discovering', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'equipment', 'Have', 'whole', 'cancelled', 'wedding', 'running', 'scene', 'be', 'START', 'part', '3', 'too', 'late', 'guess', 'argument', 'keeping', 'way', 'was', 'shot', 'fact', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'shot', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'window', 'looking', 'out', 'look', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'tell', 'happiness', 'fear', 'regards', 'new', 'life']",Spider-Man 2

Lets also praise him for making a sequel that is a true triumph over the original. Spider-Man 2 is a terrific film. Yes it was good, and the reason I gave it only 4 stars was because the end battle scene was a bit too campy and invoked too much science-fiction fantasy. The rest, however, was excellent. The drama and script were much better, the acting was much better, the romance between Peter and MJ was both quirkier and more complex at the same time, and the early action scenes between Doc Ock and Spidey far surpass the action sequences of the first film. In this film, the drama is just as prominent as the battles, and believe me, the battles are very cool and well done.

Dr. Octopus is truly scary, and is a great villain in this movie and the Spiderman franchise as a whole. Even though I hope in part 3 Venom or Carnage appear.  Every actor was extraordinary in this movie, with each actor accurately portraying the emotions they should feel and also showing style during action scenes. Maguire has shown us before that he is an outstanding actor, and he has shown us again that he has the ability to do it. I don't know what to say about the visuals effects, except they are the greatest visuals and deservers an Oscar for best cinematograph.

621357,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B00005JMQW,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[0, 0]","The web slinging superhero is back, and better than ever! Superstar Tobey Maguire (""Seabiscuit"") returns as the amazing Spider-Man in the summer's most anticipated sequel, ""Spider-Man 2""! About a couple of days ago at the theater, I saw what I expected to be not only one of the best summer sequels since last year's mega hit, ""X2: X-Men United"", but also a sequel that has more thrilling action and more breathtaking visual effects than its 2002 predecessor. And man, I was not disappointed to say the least! The direction of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness""), who helmed directing duties for the first blockbuster, has really outdone himself with his intense direction of this action-packed sequel! The performance of Maguire, returning as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, was nothing short of extraordinary! The performance of Alfred Molina (""Not Without My Daughter""), playing the villainous Dr. Octopus (""Doc Ock""), was outstanding! Possibly, this is Molina's best villainous performance since Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin performance in the first film! Also returning for ""Spider-Man 2"" are Kirsten Dunst (""Bring It On""), James Franco (""The Company""), Rosemary Harris (""Sunshine""), and J.K. Simmons (""Hidalgo""), in which they gave flawless performances! Joining the cast are the excellent talents of Donna Murphy (""Star Trek: Insurrection"") and Dylan Baker (""Head of State"").""Spider-Man 2"" takes place 2 years after the events of first film, in which Peter Parker (Maguire), as Spider-Man, defeated the villainous Green Goblin. Things would seem back to normal for Peter, but as the forces of reality take a toll on Peter's everyday life (including declining grades from his college), Peter doesn't seem to have time for anything, including being alienated from his Aunt May (Harris), his best friend Harry Osborn (Franco), who not only has taken over his father's business interests at OsCorp, not only does he still hold a grudge against Spider-Man for the death of his father, Norman Osborn, but is also obsessed with trying to find out the identity of Spider-Man; and trying to declare his love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). Mary Jane is now a model and actress, still pining for Peter's affections but ready to move on when she gets engaged to NASA astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of the Daily Bugle's sleazy editor, J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons), and Peter feels that he might lose her forever. Peter thinks that his double life as Spider-Man is the reason why his life is in shambles, and he feels that he should be Spider-Man...no more. But the worst is yet to come, though. Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), a brilliant, renowned scientist working for OsCorp, has developed not only the formula for fusion but also has a set of four mechanical arms that can keep the gravitational pull and outlashings of the fusion in check. These ""smart arms"" have a mind of their own and are fused to Octavius' spine, but not to worry, because the arms contain a microchip that keeps them from straying from Octavius' will. A freak lab accident happens as the fusion experiment goes horribly awry, which kills his wife Rosalie (Murphy) in the process, and humiliating Harry. The end result of the accident: his four metal tentacles are grafted onto his skin, thus driving him insane with his power as he unleashes his rage against the city of New York as the super-villain, Dr. Octopus (a.k.a. ""Doc Ock""). However, Doc Ock decides to try again with his fusion experiment, only this time with enough fusion power to destroy New York City! Peter feels that his sense of duty as Spider-Man should come back to him as he realizes that only Spider-Man can stop this demented genius, but Doc Ock is only the beginning of Peter's problems. Because not only is Mary Jane caught in the middle of Doc Ock's terror, but Peter's best friend, Harry, enlists Doc Ock's help in order to take down the man Harry feels is responsible for his father's death! So not only will Harry's vengeance present a challenge to Peter, but also Doc Ock will prove to be an even more worthy opponent to Spider-Man. And Spider-Man will have to push his limits to the extreme if he is to survive against Doc Ock's wrath!Like a Snickers candy bar, ""Spider-Man 2"" really satisfies. What a joy. For fans (like myself) of the first film, the sequel will be an exhilarating ride. Every element of the storytelling is a leap beyond the first film. For one thing, the special effects have gotten better. And as far as the character of Dr. Otto Octavius/Doc Ock goes, Alfred Molina is very human and real as Doc Ock, and his fiendish arms are like individual characters all their own, like four aliens riding his shoulders, snapping their jaws wickedly. But while the action occasionally veers into melodrama, we get a much more complicated and developed sense of all the film's characters. Even Rosemary Harris' Aunt May character has more to do, and her own drama and dilemmas are nicely rounded. This characterization is not at the expense of action, however. The stunts and fights are upped considerably, and a second-act subway showdown is exhilarating (not to mention, one of my favorite ""S-M 2"" action scenes)! But it is Peter's drama -- getting along in the world, finding love, liking himself -- that stands even higher.In conclusion, ""Spider-Man 2"" has exactly what a blockbuster sequel should have: mind-blowing action and suspense, some laugh-out-loud humor, mind-blowing special effects, and a powerful, top-notch cast! In fact, just watching ""Spider-Man 2"" left me with a feeling of going back and watching the first record-breaking predecessor all over again! In a way, the highlight of ""Spider-Man 2"" is the human story, which best reaches its audience and, in doing so, improves upon otherwise excellent predecessors. ""Spider-Man 2"" tickles the heart and the brain, suspends considerable disbelief, and does so with commanding flourish -- transcending the genre and succeeding as a great movie in and of itself. ""Spider-Man 2"", without a doubt, is a DVD must-have when released! And in the end, all I have to say is...bring on ""Spider-Man 3""!!",5,"""S-M2"" blew me away completely!! More action than the first!",1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,6140,"['web', 'slinging', 'superhero', 'back', 'better', 'ever', 'Superstar', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Seabiscuit', 'amazing', 'Spider-Man',

It's not perfect, of course, but still worthy of five stars and repeated viewings.  It's been said over and over but the best thing about this movie is that it chooses to focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.  The major theme is: What drives us to do the things we do and is it worth doing these things even if we suffer?  Someone mentioned to me once that he found it ridiculus that Parker only seemed clumsy and unsure of himself when he was in street clothes and not in the Spider-Man suit.  Actually, this is what is facinating about the character.  His clumsiness is all in his head untill he puts on the mask....then he reafirms himself that he is more than just a geeky kid.  Parker's problem is that he doesn't know how to carry that confidence with him throughout his ordinary life.  This is what's so charming about the character.  He's NOT a super-man.  He's NOT perfect.  He CAN'T save the world.  But he's learning how to be a real person.

621361,AQS8B1PARXG7H,B00005JMQW,"No Name ""Just a Man... With a Man's Courage""","[5, 17]","I know, I know.  I'm going to get nailed for this. Everyone loves this movie.  I liked it when I first saw it, and I still really enjoy it, hence the 3 stars.  It isn't a BAD movie, it just isn't terribly good.  The action is fine, most of the plot, sure, its ok, but I didn't like a few very big things about this movie.1. What a stupid reason to lose your powers! He wasn't sure he wanted to ""be"" spider-man anymore or something, so he lost his powers.  Who knew that you could just turn them off whenever you got emo?2. Wasn't Spidey just... not that funny? I mean, spider-man is infamous in the comics for being a sarcastic jerk to those he beats up on.  But he hardly cracked a joke in this movie. He just kind of... was sad and depressed and conflicted.  In the comics, Peter's life is terrible sometimes, but he ALWAYS keeps it together.  He uses these jokes to help himself stay sane.3. Doctor Octopus's arms could've had a better story behind them. I know they probably didn't want to rehash the same plot from the first movie (replacing ""goblin glider"" with ""octo arms""), but something else needed to be done. Dr. Octopus was one of Peter's biggest enemies, and they kill him of in a ""I'm redeemed!"" moment.  Can't a bad guy just die a bad guy for once? And can't we have that classic comic ending where its like ""oh wait, but is he really dead?""4. The romance story was weird.  For one thing, MJ left her fiance, who happened to be Peter's boss's son, at the altar for Peter, and we're supposed to assume Peter still has a job at the daily bugle after this?5. OK, here's the scene that really pissed me off... The whole part on the train, where everyone saw his face but they were all like ""Don't worry, we won't tell!"" How stupid can you get? What a dumb scene! Almost as bad as the ""Don't mess with New York!"" scene in the first. Maybe worse, come to think of it.6. Peter isn't invincible.  He can't just do what he did with that train. Yeah, he's super strong, but he can be broken... What Peter did in that movie would be something that maybe Venom would be capable of, but not Spidey.So the action was great, the story was good, but so many little things annoyed me a lot.  This is actually my least favorite of the three because I was just too distracted by its weak points to really enjoy it.  While most say numbe 3 will be the worst, I enjoyed it much more.  I like the way they took liberties with the Sandman, adding a more human element to him... but they did totally ruin Eddie Brock. And Gwen Stacy. Well, you can't win them all.

If Spider-Man 2 suffers from anything, then obviously it is a restricted budget (seen in the budget CGI effects of the first outing) because Raimi was a relatively unknown director with only a big list of unknown films (Evil Dead movies) behind him. If anything blame the studios for throwing an extra 30 million in the direction of 10 Direct to DVD moves you never watched last year.Spider-Man 2 takes off from where the first one almost left off, Mary Jane is still the love Peter Parker can not have, the new Green Goblin/ Hobgoblin is in the making, Aunt May copes with the loose of her husband and we learn some new things about her life and where it is going, Dr. Octavius is in town for a science class and more of The Daily Bugle means Spider-Man 2 is almost like watching a re-run of the first, with the side story that when Parker becomes depressed he looses he powers. Thus when the bad guys start winning more, Parker starts to loose his powers more. It is a very good new character development in Spider-Man's abilities to fight crime.I quite like the character of Dr. Octopus. What Raimi does with his character towards the end is very interesting. Most Superhero movies are about bad vs good. Here Raimi does fallen good guys vs mutant good guys. The CGI effects in this opus are a notch up or two from the last one.

The special effects were fantastic and the story line was still rather engaging.  My only complaint would be that the visions in my head will have to wait for Spiderman 3.  I totally overlooked any thoughts of Dr. Octavious.  I was expecting to Harry Osborne to put on the mask and become the new villain.

I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film.

621368,A3RW1JLHELL4MT,B00005JMQW,Paul I.,"[1, 2]","This movie was better than the first. But MJ looked more prettier in the First Movie. It was pretty neat that Sam Raimi brought the EXACT SAME characters as the first one such as JK Simmons, James Franco, Rosemary Harris, and also there was that small appearance of The Green Goblin at nearly the end of this movie. This is a good movie. And it's about where Peter Parker (Tobey MacGuire) has a few difficulties, first he got fired from his job at the Pizza Place for being late and he goes to college. He's late then too. But also he doesn't pay the rent as of his apartment. But the main part, Harry Osbourn (James Franco) takes him to meet his friend Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina). Also known as 'Dock Ock' or Doctor Octopus. Because Peter is writing a paper on Octavious. Then the next day, Harry takes Peter to see Dr. Octavious and his creation of the tentacles but there is a bad malfunction along the way that destroys Octavious' plans and makes Harry mad. He's even more mad when he sees Spider-Man after saving Harry's life. Then his wife Rosie gets killed after a piece of glass goes into her eyes. Now Octavious is thinking about the stuff that went wrong and if he's going to drown the destroying tentacles down the river, Octavious is going to have to go with the tentacles. So now, he decides to be a villian wrecking the city and being mean. But then later on, Peter goes to his friend Mary Jane's play but has to catch a couple of villians. This causes him to be a little late and the Snooty Usher (Bruce Campbell) doesn't let him in. And then MJ wants to go out with a new boyfriend who works for NASA, John. And then Harry still is mad about what happened with Octavious and the malfunction. And gets more mad at Peter and keeps on questioning him about Spider-Man. So Peter decides ""He's Spider-Man No More."" So he acts like a regular guy. But MJ still doesn't want to go out with Peter. And stuff comes worst after Octavious destroys half the city. And later on, after he asks Harry for more tritium, the most dangerous thing on earth that destroys stuff, Harry gives it to him under one condition. If Octavious brings Harry Spider-Man, he'll give Octavious all the tritium he wants. Next J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) feels sorry about taking Spider-Man away. So then Peter Parker returns as ""SPIDER MAN!"" And then Octavious and Parker fight on the subway. And all the people on the subway care for him and say ""It's good to have him back."" But after one punch from Octavious' tentacle, Otto takes Spider-Man to Harry. This is one of the moments from Spider-Man that we've all been waiting for. Harry reveals who's under the mask. And it showed PETER! I thought Harry was going to beat him up but Harry was surprised. And Harry tells Peter where Octavious is and now Spider-Man goes to save the city and capture Octavious and save MJ. Soon he says a little Phsycology to Octavious. And Octavious decides he should do the right thing. Drown the tentacles and himself. Then the next day, during the wedding of Mary Jane's MJ changes her mind and doesn't want to marry John. He wants to marry Peter! This is a great Superhero movie!

One that has problems such as family life financial burdens at school/college love issues etc. While saving the world in his spare time.When Spidey was adapted to the big screen there were slight inconsitencies to the arachnid mythos that mildly rubbed me the wrong way.But by the time I got the ticket to see the sequel these minor flaws to the continuity of the story didn't bother me at all. Mainly because the creative studio genuises stayed as close to the heart of who/what Spider-man is and what he stands for everything else is gravy. The fact he doesn't use web shooters like in the comic book becomes more than trivial when placed in a context with Molina's excellent characterization of Doctor Octavius/Doc Ock. He puts conflict into the villain making him more than a mere black hat.(Bad guy). Rosemary Harris's words of wisdom and James Franco's shadowy foreboding of avenging his father's death are only two examples of how this hero is more than bam boom bash on bad guys heads. Overall a surprisingly deep adaptation that is balanced in that it doesn't sacrifice story for its incredible special effects and action, or forget who its audience is by plumbing too deep into the romantic subplot between Peter and Mary-Jane.I have seen this movie once and guarantee I will see it again in theaters before buying the DVD when its released.",5,Not Just for Comic Book People,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,1460,"['two', 'favourite', 'comic', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'X-men', 'Spiderman', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'Steve', 'Ditka', 'created', 'ageless', 'hero', 'One', 'problems', 'such', 'family', 'life', 'financial', 'burdens', 'school/college', 'love', 'issues', 'etc', 'saving', 'world', 'spare', 'time.When', 'Spidey', 'was', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'were', 'slight', 'inconsitencies', 'arachnid', 'mythos', 'mildly', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way.But', 'time', 'got', 'ticket', 'see', 'sequel', 'minor', 'flaws', 'continuity', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Mainly', 'creative', 'studio', 'genuises', 'stayed', 'close', 'heart', 'who/what', 'Spider-man', 'what', 'everything', 'else', 'gravy', 'fact', ""n't"", 'use', 'web', 'shooters', 'comic', 'book', 'more', 'trivial', 'when', 'placed', 'context', 'Molina', 'excellent', 'characterization', 'Doctor', 'Octavius/Doc', 'Ock', 'conflict', 'villain', 'making', 'more', 'mere', 'black', 'hat', 'Bad', 'guy', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'words', 'wisdom', 'James', 'Franco', 'shadowy', 'foreboding', 'avenging', 'father', 'death', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'examples', 'how', 'hero', 'more', 'bam', 'boom', 'bash', 'bad', 'guys', 'heads', 'Overall', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'adaptation', 'balanced', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'story', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'forget', 'who', 'audience', 'plumbing', 'too', 'deep', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'Peter', 'Mary-Jane.I', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'guarantee', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'theaters', 'buying', 'DVD', 'when', 'released']",Spider-Man 2

621373,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B00005JMQW,P. Hardy,"[0, 2]","Spider-Man II is by far a better movie than the first. The only thing it was lacking was a Lucy Lawless cameo, although Ted Rami did make up for all of that. The spider man II has improved on the mistakes the first one made in such a phenomenal way, I couldn't help but watch the entire thing in awe. Plus the movie was free of all corny scenes like the one in the first movie when the Green Goblin was about skewer Spider-man who happened to be holding on for his life while keeping a trolley of children from falling from their deaths, but was then attacked by a bunch of New Yorkers on the bridge. The Goblin didn't even try to kill them or something. Corny.The story doesn't exactly pick up where the last movie left off (since the movie didn't start with Spider-man swinging over NYC), but with a simple narrative by the overwhelmed Peter Parker who has far too much on his mind and far too much to do in such a small amount of time while at the same time try to Juggle being Spider-man and Peter Parker at the same time.Peter is constantly fired from his job the daily bugle and other part time jobs and his grades in collage are falling fast because of his constant reversal roles; his relationship with Harry Osborne and Mary Jane Watson grows farther apart as well. His life takes a nose dive when Harry takes him to meet Doctor Otto Octavious, who has an unexpected accident with a machine he was creating. Thus the turmoil of Peter Parker begins anew. Unlike most sequels for movies, SM-II doesn't jump right into the action nor does it focus solely on the action itself because the producers think since they've explained the story in the first movie they'll jump right into the action and barely focus on a storyline. Spider-man remains to be one of the most story driven superheroes around; it focuses on the humanity of the characters and their own personal struggles while at the same time maintaining Spider-man's witty humor.The animation in the movie was done superbly. It was hard to tell if they used CGI imagery in someone of the action and spider-man scenes, although there were moments when it was painstakingly noticeable (Doctor Octopus' arms and movements, the runaway light-rail scene *I was expecting that nonetheless*, and most of the destroyed environments in the movie). It was easy on the eyes and nicely detailed to the smallest piece of glass.The Characters in SM-II remain the same with a few maturity tweaks; While Mary Jane is still musing over the fact that Peter won't tell her the truth, she doesn't try to pry it out of him (Like Lana and most of the characters of Smallville) but does give him a hard way to go when he tries to explain things. Harry still despises Spider-man and is no more charming than he was in the first movie, and Aunt May.... well she rmains to be the same old wise lady with more screen time added into the mix. However, there was something missing from Doctor Octopus' character; there seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why he wanted to rebuild his machine besides the fact that voices in his head (his mechanical arms) were telling him to do so. He was missing a villainous vibe and personality to him, he just seemed to be robbing banks and stealing things for the sheer sake of it (but most villains do, but at least they had a motivation, an objective. Doc Oct didn't).DVD features--- [no rating]: Disk One offers language and Subtitle selections, Web (online) features, and a music video from Train 'Ordinary.' Disk two offers pretty much the same features you'd see on the Theatrical DVD releases of the Lord of the rings, behind the scenes, making of the movie, and other among other things excluding trailers and TV spots. But all in all the movie was solid in places I had believed it would be lacking, a great movie for marvel comic fans and newcomers.

621374,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B00005JMQW,Philip Scholz,"[0, 0]","Please note that I've never read any Spider-Man comics and am simply judging this and any other Spider-Man film on their merits as films in a superhero film series.  Thank you for your understanding.We've all seen superhero film sequels that fell flat or outright bombed (i.e. Batman and Robin, Superman IV.)  This film did no such thing.  It continued an interesting story, introducing new characters and plots while building on what the first film had left us with.  It also gave me my favorite Spider-Man villain ever:  Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, played by Alfred Molina, whose performance can be called nothing short of ""humanizing"" for this character.  Seriously, this incarnation of Dr. Otto Octavius is Spider-Man's equivalent of Mr. Freeze, but with a bit more humor, and that makes him so great to watch over and over again.  It was also nice that this film didn't go the way of other superhero sequels by trying to cram more villains into its plot.  Sure, Harry Osborn was rather evil, but he's been around in the previous film, so his story ark was merely continuing rather than just beginning.  This film also did something I can't recall any other superhero film doing...it showed us Peter Parker's struggles with keeping up with his double life.  Sure, there have been films, including this movie's predecessor, that showed such problems to a certain extent, but here, we truely can see and identify with his trials and sacrifices, and that only adds to his character and the plot.  We surely have Toby McGuire's acting to thank for that as well as the great writing.  I never really got the part about him just losing his powers and then getting them back, but otherwise, I loved this film.

This movie has some great action that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very few sequels can live up to the original, but Spider-Man 2 sure does.

The regular Spider-Man 2 edition is clear but the superbit edition is much clearer and much more detail is seen. Another great thing about the Superbit edition is the choice of sound options. You get the DTS soundtrack (dts only available on superbit edition) which brings the film to life far more than just the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. You have to be a true die hard fan to really appreciate this superbit edition.

621379,A1HVJELFV84ISH,B00005JMQW,QUEEN_OF_EVERYTHING,"[2, 2]","The answer is yes, and SPIDERMAN 2 proves this theory true.  In fact, a sequel can not only stand up to its predecessor, but be more entertaining, fun, and suspenseful than the first.  Yes, it's true: SPIDERMAN 2 totally beats the first Spiderman movie.I haven't read the comic books.  Is the movie up to par with its origins?  This I don't know.  But I do think I know a good film.  SPIDERMAN 2 is well worth seeing.  Why?  I can easily surpass the 10-reason mark.(1.) Tobey Maguire puts his heart into his Peter Parker performance.  He is more emotional and really ""becomes"" his character, so to speak.(2.) Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and ethereal as Mary Jane Watson.  It is two years since she and Peter graduated from high school and she has pursued her dreams of acting, taking on the lead in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST.(3.) The movie's villain is more frightening.  A renowned scientist experiments and the experiment not only backfires, but causes a plethora of drama, violence, and chaos as a machine he created to cheapen the expense of electricity instead hooks onto his body and gains control.  I was actually a bit scared, folks, and I'm 16!  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, take your little ones to see this.  Or cover their eyes when you sense the scary moments are approaching.  When I was in the theater, the little children were crying and screaming for their mummies and daddies.  Even if you think SPIDERMAN 1 didn't warrant its PG-13, this one is different.  Trust me.(4.) It is far more suspenseful.  For one thing, Peter trashes his Spidey suit when he senses his powers waning.  We wonder if he will retrieve the suit and once again be on the run and on the watch to save the earth.  We also wonder if Mary Jane will forgive him for missing her play.  And will she marry her fiance???(5.) A romance blossoms.  I won't say between who but I'm sure you can take a wild guess.  It looks like this romance shall last as well.  Will there be a sequel?  Yes.  SPIDERMAN 3 is in the works.(6.) Amazing cinematography.  Filmed in New York, one of the U. S. of A.'s best cities, it captures the essence of NYC: the grunge, the glamour, the pizza parlors, the traffic holdups, the prestigious university at which Peter Parker attends.  The name is never mentioned, but I suspect it to be either NYU or Columbia.(7.) Even more amazing special effects.  Spidey flys, soars, jumps, and shoots out web like aeresol confetti.  The results of pooled efforts and computer technology is an amazing sight.(8.) Peter Parker's best friend is hot.  Oh...and a good actor.(9.) ""VINDICATED"" was written expressly for SPIDERMAN 2 by Dashboard Confessional.  It plays during the closing credits.  It's a great song with excellent lyrics.  All the music from the movie is great, actually.  I'm ever-so tempted to purchase the soundtrack.(10.) The dialogue is better - much more well-written.  The whole script is just great.(11.) Spiderman saves more lives: a little girl in a burning building, his own aunt, a TRAINLOAD full of New Yorkers, Mary Jane (of course)...(12.) The flashback of Peter and his deceased uncle was enough to make me cry.(13.) It has something for everyone: suspense, drama, romance, tearjerkers, a smidgen of horror (can't get over the villain), and so much more.  All around, it's a very well done effort.(14.) Did I mention that it's longer?  I do think it is.  Or perhaps it just feels that way.**Ages 11 and up.

After two years nothing has gotten any easier. Bashed by the Daily Bugle, tormented and miserable because of secrets he can never reveal, and forced to give up the girl he loves, at times his gift and curse of being Spider-Man is too much to bear. As more aspects of his life become unbalanced and miserable, Peters' stress begins to give him mysterious web-failures, a very dangerous thing to happen when he's web-swinging more then 300 feet up high in the air. What's even worse is that his idol Doctor Octavius is turned into a madman now dubbed 'Doc Ock' as the result of a failed experiment.Unable to cope as his life turns to crud and more of his powers begin to leave him, Peter snaps and throws away his costume for good. Thus giving up being Spider-Man, and determined to get his life back on track. Living a fantastic dream that can never be, Peters' life seems much better for a short while. Very soon his dream fades away into darkness and everything goes wrong again when Peter is unable to help citizens in pearl, upsets his Aunt by revealing the truth about Uncle Bens' death, and when Doc Ock snatches Mary-Jane right in front of Peter's eyes. Now Peter must hope that his powers return, re-think his choice and learn the true meaning of responsibility. With many lives in danger, above Manhattans magnificent skyline, Spider-Man must face his fiercest enemy, his destiny, and himself.I saw this movie the first day it opened in movie theaters. I loved this movie so much; it's now my favourite. I found it to be so much better then the first in many ways. It was all about a selfless man deciding to become selfish, then having to learn that he has to give up the thing he wants the most, even his dreams. Tobey Maguire was perfect as his portrayal of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, he really showed Peters' character and essence. Kirsten Dunst couldn't have been better; once again she nailed it right on the head with her portrayal as Mary-Jane Watson. James Franco and Rosemary Harris were also fantastic as Harry Osbourne and Aunt May.

I found it to be a little distracting and boring at times.  However, the battle scenes are some of the best ever created.  There is a sense of peril and doom around every corner.

621386,A7YRIAR531O83,B00005JMQW,Rick Chen,"[22, 25]","The trailers for this movie looked great and the reviews have been stellar. Definitely the movie of the summer whether you are a Spidey fan or not. As most reviews have pointed out, the storyline is very well developed. Peter Parker struggles with complexities of living a dual life. And decides for a time to be Spider-Man, No More.I won't go into detail too much about the plot as every other review on here will probably give you a synopsis. I will however, make some comments about what I particularly liked or disliked about this film.I found that I came out of the movie thinking that there wasn't as much action as I expected. It was strange that Peter Parker's powers could go away simply because he didn't want to be Spider-Man anymore. And I found myself noticing that Tobey Maguire was starting too look a bit old for this part. He is already 28(?) now, and by the time Spider-Man 3 is released, I may not be able to be convinced that he Peter Parker anymore. I was also a little disappointed that the rumours of a Venom appearance weren't true and that the next movie will probably feature Harry Osbourne as the Green Goblin. And I didn't like how so many people saw Spider-Man's identity (Harry, MJ, Doc Ock, all the people on the train).Among the things I liked most was the beginning of the movie, which was very clever in the way that it showed you storyboards from the 1st movie to refresh your memory and summarize what has happened. Undoubtedbly, the action scenes in this movie were great (eg. the scene where he has to stop the speeding train). And the storyline is very well developed. In addition to these, there was also a good mix of humour thrown in to make the movie even more entertaining (eg. when Peter gives up being Spider-Man to the tune of Rain Drops Keep Falling On My Head, and the elevator scene where the stranger asks him about the costume... ""a little itchy""... haha). We also saw characters from the comics such as John Jameson, which some of us know as Man-Wolf.This is a great movie to see with the family and I hope that it breaks many box office records. (...)

I came twenty minutes after it opened, so I could get a copy. ALL THE SPIDER-MAN 2 DVDS WERE ALREADY RENTED. I came back a week later, because by then the rush should've been over. All the Spidey 2 DVDs were gone. Two weeks later, I finally got a copy, and I was blown away.OK, first off, the SFX. They absolutely rocked. No flaws, screw ups, or even something that didn't look real. AMAZING. From begginning to end, there were no errors. Next, the characters. I do read the Spidey comics, and I must say that the Doc Ock presented in Spidey 2 was a lot more fun and entertaining then the one in the comic. His arms are more realistic looking, and the technology more believable.Now, you're probably asking yourself, why the heck didn't this movie get five stars? Well, when Peter flips off his bike to avoid the car, he lands, and some kids go, &quot;Hey, how'd ya do that?&quot; Peter's reply: &quot;Oh, well, you know, work out, eat your green vegetables.&quot; The kids say, without feeling or nothin', &quot;That's what my ma's alawys sayin'. I just neva believed 'er.&quot; It was stale and boring.The second reason, WHY DID PETER RUN OUT OF BLOODY POWERS?????? In the looniest sense in the world, Spidey just runs out of powers. Why??? I thought super heroes always just kept their powers. That part was pretty annoying and sensless to me. Oh well; all in all this is a d**n great movie, and is a must for any collection.

621390,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B00005JMQW,RJ Smoove,"[2, 2]","Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a ""sequal"", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.

621395,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JMQW,Robert Moore,"[6, 6]","As a rule, superhero movies are a rather lackluster genre.  The emphasis is almost always on a bankable star, flashy special effects, and elaborate confrontations with super villains.  SPIDERMAN 2 lacks none of these things, but luckily it has a great deal more going for it.  More than anything else, SPIDERMAN 2 has a great story.  Somewhere along the line, the other superhero movies lost track of the story; this superb film brings that back.I do not think that it is any exaggeration to say that this is the finest superhero movie ever made, and the primary reason for that is the super screenplay.  Film mastermind Sam Raimi obviously recognized that while special effects and stars are great enhancements to a film, at root you have to have a story worth the telling.  He therefore recruited Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Michael Chabon (whose novel THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY proved that he possessed an absolute mastery over comic book type stories) to provide the basic story around which the screenplay was written.  I found the first film to be mildly interesting, but the vast improvement in the second film over the first is overwhelmingly because of the greatly improved storyline.Without giving away any major plot details, the situation is this:  in most superhero movies, despite whatever attempts are made at depicting the situation of the central character as tragic, we actually envy them.  What male wouldn't love to be Superman?  Who wouldn't want super strength, the ability to fly, or invulnerability?  Batman may lack these, but Bruce Wayne is a multi-billionaire with whom most of us would trade places in a second.  And while Bruce broods a lot, it is very difficult to feel that he truly has a rotten life.  The brilliance of SPIDERMAN 2 lies in the fact that an hour into the movie, it is impossible to imagine anyone wanting to trade places with Peter Parker.  Yeah, he is a superhero, but his life really and truly sucks, and in super fashion.  He has a horrible job, is struggling in school, discoveries that his aunt is being evicted from her house, lives in an absolutely wretched apartment (with a dreadful landlord, magnificently played by Russian comic Elya Baskin), and is feeling very, very lonely.  But worst of all, MJ, the love of his life, has not only gotten engaged in the face of Peter's reluctance to get involved with her, but is furious at Peter for his ongoing unreliability.  As he feels himself losing her presence in his life, he actually begins losing his powers.  And all this takes place as he has to face a new and dangerous enemy in Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist whose body and mind has been taken over by intelligent high-tech tentacles (played marvelously by superb character actor Alfred Molina).Luckily, the film excels not only in setting up the situation, but does an excellent job of resolving the central concepts in the storyline.  Peter recovers his passion for MJ and thereby his superpowers (the precise instance that he once again has his powers is the moment when MJ in a coffee shop asks him to kiss her), recovers his sense of purpose, and in the end is rescued from some of his loneliness.After SPIDERMAN, I was not especially looking forward to SPIDERMAN 2, but after this one, and especially after learning that Raimi has asked Michael Chabon to write another story, I am eagerly awaiting the next one.  Early rumor is that James Franco as Harry Osborn will resurrect his father?s Green Hornet, and that the Black Cat (perhaps played by Eliza Dushku, who is reportedly favored for the role by Raimi) will make an appearance.",5,A film that completely transcends the superhero genre,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,3622,"['rule', 'superhero', 'movies', 'are', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'genre', 'emphasis', 'almost', 'always', 'bankable', 'star', 'flashy', 'special', 'effects', 'elaborate', 'confrontations', 'super', 'villains', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'none', 'things', 'luckily', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'going', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'great', 'story', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'lost', 'track', 'story', 'superb', 'film', 'back.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'finest', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'primary', 'reason', 'super', 'screenplay', 'Film', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'obviously', 'recognized', 'special', 'effects', 'stars', 'are', 'great', 'enhancements', 'film', 'root', 'have', 'have', 'story', 'telling', 'therefore', 'recruited', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novelist', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'THE', 'AMAZING', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'KAVALIER', 'AND', 'CLAY', 'proved', 'possessed', 'absolute', 'mastery', 'comic', 'book', 'type', 'stories', 'provide', 'basic', 'story', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'found', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'vast', 'improvement', 'second', 'film', 'first', 'overwhelmingly', 'greatly', 'improved', 'storyline.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'major', 'plot', 'details', 'situation', 'most', 'superhero', 'movies', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'depicting', 'situation', 'central', 'character', 'tragic', 'actually', 'envy', 'What', 'male', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'be', 'Superman', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'super', 'strength', 'ability', 'fly', 'invulnerability', 'Batman', 'may', 'lack', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'multi-billionaire', 'whom', 'most', 'would', 'trade', 'places', 'second', 'Bruce', 'lot', 'very', 'difficult', 'feel', 'truly', 'rotten', 'life', 'brilliance', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'lies', 'fact', 'hour', 'movie', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'trade', 'places', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Yeah', 'superhero', 'life', 'really', 'truly', 'sucks', 'super', 'fashion', 'horrible', 'job', 'struggling', 'school', 'discoveries', 'aunt', 'being', 'evicted', 'house', 'absolutely', 'wretched', 'apartment', 'dreadful', 'landlord', 'magnificently', 'played', 'Russian', 'comic', 'Elya', 'Baskin', 'feeling', 'very', 'very', 'lonely', 'worst', 'MJ', 'love', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'gotten', 'engaged', 'face', 'Peter', 'reluctance', 'get', 'involved', 'furious', 'Peter', 'ongoing', 'unreliability', 'losing', 'presence', 'life', 'actually', 'losing', 'powers', 'place', 'face', 'new', 'dangerous', 'enemy', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'body', 'mind', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'intelligent', 'high-tech', 'tentacles', 'played', 'marvelously', 'superb', 'character', 'actor', 'Alfred', 'Molina', '.Luckily', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'setting', 'up', 'situation', 'excellent', 'job', 'resolving', 'central', 'concepts', 'storyline', 'Peter', 'passion', 'MJ', 'thereby', 'superpowers', 'precise', 'instance', 'once', 'again', 'powers', 'moment', 'when', 'MJ', 'coffee', 'shop', 'kiss', 'sense', 'purpose', 'end', 'rescued', 'loneliness.After', 'SPIDERMAN', 'was', 'not', 'especially', 'looking', 'forward', 'SPIDERMAN', '2', 'one', 'especially', 'learning', 'Raimi', 'asked', 'Michael', 'Chabon', 'write', 'story', 'am', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'next', 'one', 'Early', 'rumor', 'James', 'Franco', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'will', 'resurrect', 'father', 's', 'Green', 'Hornet', 'Black', 'Cat', 'perhaps', 'played', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'who', 'reportedly', 'favored', 'role', 'Raimi', 'will', 'make', 'appearance']",Spider-Man 2

621398,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B00005JMQW,Rocco Dormarunno,"[3, 4]","The first Spider-Man movie was so comprehensive, I thought that there would be nothing new to add in the sequel. I was right, HOWEVER, what the producers/writers/directors did do was expand on the elements planted in the original. The first movie centered on Peter Parker's new found powers. SPIDER-MAN 2 focuses on the conflict he has balancing those powers with his personal life. Tobey Maguire does an admirable job capturing that dilemna.The nemesis this time is Doc Ock, played with enormous composure and then terrific high-handedness by Alfred Molina. The sleepy-eyed Kirsten Dunst returns to play M.J., the object of Parker's desire, whom he disappoints time and again. J.K. Simmons is the ultimate scene-stealer as the hot-headed, fast-talking J. Jonah Jameson.There is action galore in SPIDER-MAN 2. There are also a lot of inaccuracies. There are no elevated subway lines in Manhattan, except way uptown. However, the train on which Spidey and Doc Ock battle it out, is filmed in Queens (even though the train's destination is clearly marked ""Bay Ridge"" which is in Brooklyn). Also, in one scene, with one swing of the web Spidey goes from mid-Manhattan to City Hall Park way downtown. There's no web big enough to do that. (All right, so I'm showing off. And nit-picking. Sue me.)But this isn't what detracted the one star away from my rating. My problem with the film is the incredibly sl-o-o-o-w pacing in so many scenes. The talking between Peter and M.J., Peter and his aunt, Peter and the ghost of his uncle, etc., etc., just go on and on and on... It just kills whatever adrenaline that was produced by the action sequences. Even the comic scenes, which could have been so funny--Peter's confrontation with the snooty theater-doorman, the awkwardness of his elevator ride with the rich dog-walker, the mops and brooms that endlessly fall out of a closet in an early scene--drag on way too long. It's like someone telling you the same joke three times a day. These elements really mar the movie.However, as pure mind candy, and for anyone who followed Spider-Man in the comic books, this is still worth seeing!

Zwick,"[1, 1]","As children, most of us grow up wishing we could become gravity-defying super heroes, flying around the world, battling villains, rescuing the innocent, and fighting for truth, justice and the American way.  But what if the burden of such a calling turned out to be too much for us?  What if saving the world became a 24-hour-a-day/seven-days-a-week occupation that prevented us from leading a normal life and finding happiness with our one true love?That is the dilemma Peter Parker faces in ""Spiderman 2,"" a deeper, richer, more psychologically nuanced follow-up to the rather innocuous ""Spiderman"" from 2002.  Most of the major players from the original have returned, including director Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst.  What's different this time around is that the filmmakers have chosen to emphasize the inner conflict Parker is undergoing between needing to fulfill the awesome responsibilities that go along with being a crime fighting super hero and wanting to chuck it all in order to win the heart of the literal girl-next-door.  Parker finds that being Spiderman keeps him from fulfilling the mundane, run-of-the-mill, day-to-day commitments one needs to in order to have successful relationships with other people - most especially the girl he loves.  When the conflict becomes too much for him, Peter has to decide whether or not he is going to continue to lead this double existence or return to the simplicity of life as a mere mortal.  It is this added intellectual dimension that gives ""Spiderman 2"" the thematic heft that ""Spiderman 1"" lacked.The plot, involving a brilliant scientist who inadvertently becomes a killing machine when one of his experiments goes awry, is reasonably entertaining and interesting, though it pales in comparison to the love story and the complex internal conflict taking place in our superhero's overtaxed psyche.  The special effects seem vastly improved over the original, with Spiderman's movements through the air appearing considerably more graceful and natural than they did the first time around.  A spectacular scene involving Spiderman attempting to arrest a runaway train racing uncontrollably through Manhattan is the action highlight of the film.As Parker, Toby Maguire provides the emotional gravity the story needs to be effective.  His shy, self-effacing demeanor draws us to the character and makes him a believable, sympathetic figure whom the audience can relate to and root for all the way through.  The sweet, vulnerable, yet eternally self-assured Kirsten Dunst makes for the perfect romantic counterpart to this young man who's all thumbs and who seems perpetually tongue-tied when he isn't donning his webbed designer jumpsuit.I wasn't a big fan of the first ""Spiderman"" movie, but ""Spiderman 2"" has an intelligence and charm that make this particular installment awfully hard to resist.

621404,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JMQW,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 5]","It's plot meanders and shamelessly riffs off the first movie, slams us with special effects and brazenly ends off arrogantly predicting a sequel.  Yet this could easily be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.SM2 picks up 2 years after the last movie.  Though the last movie ended with Mary Jane confessing her lover for Peter Parker, the two remain unconnected by the start of the new movie.  Trying to juggle college, a part-time job and saving the city from random acts of mass destruction, Peter Parker's life is a wreck.  Both Harry Osborn and MJ have moved on with their lives (and don't dodge foreclosure like Spidey has to).  After losing his job and MJ, and on the verge of flunking college, Parker begins losing his powers, and is forced to consider hanging up his sticky alter-ego for good.  Meanwhile, Parker's idol, the Brilliant physicist Otto Octavius, is on the verge of cracking the key to safe fusion power, while Harry Osborn holds Spiderman responsible for his father's death, and plots revenge.  Will there be an horrific accident at Dr. Octavius's demonstration?  Uh huh.  Will his mind become twisted as he becomes fused with a quartet of robotic arms?  You betcha.  Will he turn criminal to finance experiments that may blast NYC to kingdom-come?  Hey, is Darkman mean?Though a special effects treat, SM2 flies on the strength of Tobey Maguire's understated performance, it also rides the steam of the other players - Rosemary Harris as a feisty Aunt May, Alfred Molina as a likeable if scary Doc Octopus (even though the script just re-writes the same characters Defoe played in the last movie) and of course JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  With a script padded with tons of in-jokes yet slick enough for the non-fan who doesn't even know that superhero is one word, SM2 is a rare treat.  Best of all, SM2 stays true to the every joe-a-hero theme of the first movie (a point made during a titanic battle royale between Spidey and Doc Ock on a runaway El train).CAVEAT: The flick is, if anything, scarier than the last - a good example being the scene when the arms of the near-dead Doc-Ock come alive and tear up an OR.  If you've got an 8 year-older who loved the first movie, SM2 might still be too much.Lastly - a flick of this scale just can't be enjoyed in full screen.",4,Spidey sense is ringing off the scale,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,2310,"['plot', 'meanders', 'shamelessly', 'riffs', 'first', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'brazenly', 'off', 'arrogantly', 'predicting', 'sequel', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.SM2', 'up', '2', 'years', 'last', 'movie', 'last', 'movie', 'ended', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'confessing', 'lover', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'two', 'remain', 'unconnected', 'start', 'new', 'movie', 'Trying', 'juggle', 'college', 'part-time', 'job', 'saving', 'city', 'random', 'acts', 'mass', 'destruction', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'life', 'wreck', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'MJ', 'have', 'moved', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'dodge', 'foreclosure', 'Spidey', 'losing', 'job', 'MJ', 'verge', 'flunking', 'college', 'Parker', 'losing', 'powers', 'forced', 'consider', 'hanging', 'up', 'sticky', 'alter-ego', 'good', 'Meanwhile', 'Parker', 'idol', 'Brilliant', 'physicist', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'verge', 'cracking', 'key', 'safe', 'fusion', 'power', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'Spiderman', 'responsible', 'father', 'death', 'plots', 'revenge', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'horrific', 'accident', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'demonstration', 'Uh', 'huh', 'Will', 'mind', 'become', 'twisted', 'fused', 'quartet', 'robotic', 'arms', 'betcha', 'Will', 'turn', 'criminal', 'finance', 'experiments', 'may', 'blast', 'NYC', 'kingdom-come', 'Hey', 'Darkman', 'mean', 'special', 'effects', 'treat', 'SM2', 'strength', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'understated', 'performance', 'also', 'steam', 'other', 'players', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'feisty', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'likeable', 'scary', 'Doc', 'Octopus', 'even', 'script', 'just', 'same', 'characters', 'Defoe', 'played', 'last', 'movie', 'course', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'script', 'padded', 'tons', 'in-jokes', 'yet', 'slick', 'enough', 'non-fan', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'superhero', 'one', 'word', 'SM2', 'rare', 'treat', 'Best', 'SM2', 'true', 'joe-a-hero', 'theme', 'first', 'movie', 'point', 'made', 'titanic', 'battle', 'royale', 'Spidey', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'runaway', 'El', 'train', '.CAVEAT', 'flick', 'anything', 'scarier', 'last', 'good', 'example', 'being', 'scene', 'when', 'arms', 'near-dead', 'Doc-Ock', 'come', 'alive', 'tear', 'up', 'OR', ""'ve"", 'got', '8', 'year-older', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'movie', 'SM2', 'might', 'still', 'be', 'too', 'much.Lastly', 'flick', 'scale', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoyed', 'full', 'screen']",Spider-Man 2

So I will base this review on the extra scenes and the DVD specs and not the movie itself.Disc 1This one includes the movie with 8 minutes of bonus footage, this footage is not shown separately as `deleted scenes', instead, the scenes were added to the movie so we can consider this an extended edition of the film.- Peter's birthday party is extended. Here, we see Peter and Harry going over Harry's issues with Spidey and the death of his father.- The elevator scene in which Spidey talked about his costume was replaced with another that I personally didn't like, the new one feels awkward and not as spontaneous as the original.- MJ at the shoe store. Mary Jane talks about love and the kiss she got from Spidey with a friend.- Two fight sequences are extended; in the one in which Dr. Octopus takes aunt May hostage, a new bit in which they both crash into an office through the window and fight inside was added. Also, the train sequence has new bits of Spidey and Dr Octopus fighting while hanging besides the train.- Jonah Jameson wears the Spiderman suit while the staff looks amazed, a quite silly scene that I understand why it was originally removed.Bottom-line, the extra 8 minutes do not add anything to the movie; they are tiny bits that were originally removed for a reason. If you are a Spiderman fan and a collector you can get this for a very decent price, if you liked the original and expect to see major changes, the 2.1 version will only disappoint you.The movie includes a trivia track with a lot of information about the comics, the actors and the movie itself; if activated, it will also show you behind the scenes during the movie. The movie screen will be minimized in the lower left corner to show the behind the scene footage in the full screen. Presented in English, French and Spanish (all three in Dolby Digital 5.1) and subtitled in the same three languages. It includes also an audio commentary by Laura Ziskin & Kirsten Dunst.Disc 2The features included here are more oriented to promoting the third movie of the hero. There is a sneak peek for the ""Spider-Man 3"" movie, which is basically the same scenes from the original trailer plus some interviews with the cast. I rather watch the last trailer for the movie but that one is not included here.There is a `Inside 2.1 Featurette' that describes the process of completion of the scenes, ironically the last comment in this featurette says that `the movie the people will remember will be Spiderman 2 and not the 2.1 version'Another preview for the video game is also here, but when you see it you'll see that it was added just to justify more features in the disc.

The temptation to make a 'different' movie sometimes leads them down wrong paths. Not so here. The followup feels very much cut from the same cloth of the first movie, but with more of a direct threat and momentum to the movie.In the first movie, the Goblin was bad, yes. But his actions had little to no pattern or goal to them (except disintegrating the board members of course). He was simply out to either hurt or turn Spider-man. It worked well enough for the movie, and since the Goblin was basically a man unhinged anyways. However, in comes Doc Oc.After a lab accident leaves him with four new appendages and the belief that Spider-man had ruined the attempt, he sets out to complete his life's work and rid himself of the one he blames his failure on. The fact is, if his experiment is completed, it could destroy the entire city, which gives real threat to the villain this time.The drama plays out well enough, but it's the action sequences you wait for. You are not disappointed on that front here. The fight sequences are intricate, large and fast-paced.In the end, it can be a matter of personal opinion as to which of the two movies you consider superior.

621414,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JMQW,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 5]","The second installment of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; saga is likely to be the crown jewel of the series, a blend of comic fantasy and human realism that satisfies action addicts just enough while exploring duality and classist society as well as the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy.In Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst director Sam Raimi has a couple that transcends the genre: They are not their generation's best actors - Maguire's squeaky turn in &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; proves that - but their personalities - bright, humble, hopeful, just a smidge goofy - are perfectly attuned to this fare. They like others, they like each other, we like them. &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; works on other levels, but mostly because Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are kids we'd be proud to know (or raise), played by actors who still seem closer to Earth than Hollywood.The sequel begins two years after the original: Peter is balancing crime-fighting, college and a pizza job while Mary Jane does off-Broadway Oscar Wilde (to unlikely full houses.) Peter's friend Harry (James Franco) still vows vengeance against Spider-Man for killing his father; he's also bankrolling a Nobel scientist working on fusion, Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina).Octavious, who wears artificially intelligent mechanical arms to work the ball of energy, is a idol of Peter's, who happens to be writing a paper on the doctor on the day of invention unveiling, when all goes awry. The accident leaves Octavious at the behest of the giant, powerful mechanical arms, who immediately want to recreate the experiment by any means necessary.Meanwhile, Peter is torn between duty and Mary Jane. His instincts and web slings are on the blink. He's late to Mary Jane's play. He loses the pizza job. He's on the outs with his Aunt May (an excellent Rosemary Harris). Harry wants Peter to produce Spider-Man. And newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson (J.K Simmons) still runs Spidey through the wringer on the front page of his tabloid. Peter seriously begins to contemplate walking away from heroism when Mary Jane gets engaged to Jameson's astronaut son.Alvin Sargent's screenplay understands what issues withstand the opening weekend box office; the movie takes its time to explore Peter's connection to friends, family, and the citizens he protects. Spider-Man is among the people, not above them. He tires. He gets snippy. An excellent &quot;dying with pride&quot; spech from Harris argues for duty against dream. It's a two-hour comic book, yet firmly rooted in working-class ideals. The subtextual arguments against the media and irresponsible science reject elitism - notice how villainous attacks in both movies are against everyday commuters. Notice that Jonah pits both sides against each other for what he believes to be maximum effect while the masses embrace Spider-Man. Notice in a small scene at Mary Jane's theater how petty, circular art rules conspire to keep Peter from the Oscar Wilde play. Raimi and Sargent are quiet about it, but the movie underlines classic themes, and it does so without gore or violence of nihilism run amok. For bright, receptive teens, &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; carries an excellent message.Which doesn't mean the movie's perfect. Again the villain is thrown into the background, and while Doc Ock is more imposing than The Green Goblin, it doesn't make him any more memorable. Alfred Molina is serviceable but not wicked - his &quot;evil&quot; humor is droll and detached, his menace casual. Though Franco is a decent young actor, Harry Osborn is a poorly-written, ill-motivated villain-in-waiting, and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; looks less promising according to the hints dropped at the end of this movie.The central love story of Peter and Mary Jane, however, is strong enough to withstand hammy, average foes - expect two for the next &quot;Spider-Man.&quot; This movie's final shot suggests there is more emotional terrain to cover despite Mary Jane's revelations; whether Raimi and Sargent remain a team for the future pictures, the critical groundwork is in place. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and his girl will be with us for some time.",4,Classic themes and spider webs - a comic gem,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,4134,"['second', 'installment', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', 'quot', 'saga', 'likely', 'be', 'crown', 'jewel', 'series', 'blend', 'comic', 'fantasy', 'human', 'realism', 'action', 'addicts', 'just', 'enough', 'exploring', 'duality', 'classist', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'quot', 'Star', 'Wars', 'quot', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'couple', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'generation', 'best', 'actors', 'Maguire', 'squeaky', 'turn', 'quot', 'Seabiscuit', 'quot', 'personalities', 'bright', 'humble', 'hopeful', 'just', 'smidge', 'goofy', 'are', 'perfectly', 'attuned', 'fare', 'others', 'like', 'other', 'like', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'quot', 'works', 'other', 'levels', 'mostly', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'are', 'kids', ""'d"", 'be', 'proud', 'know', 'raise', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'still', 'seem', 'closer', 'Earth', 'Hollywood.The', 'sequel', 'two', 'years', 'original', 'Peter', 'balancing', 'crime-fighting', 'college', 'pizza', 'job', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'off-Broadway', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'unlikely', 'full', 'houses', 'Peter', 'friend', 'Harry', 'James', 'Franco', 'still', 'vengeance', 'Spider-Man', 'killing', 'father', 'also', 'bankrolling', 'Nobel', 'scientist', 'working', 'fusion', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavious', 'Alfred', 'Molina', '.Octavious', 'who', 'artificially', 'intelligent', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'work', 'ball', 'energy', 'idol', 'Peter', 'who', 'be', 'writing', 'paper', 'doctor', 'day', 'invention', 'unveiling', 'when', 'awry', 'accident', 'Octavious', 'behest', 'giant', 'powerful', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'who', 'immediately', 'want', 'recreate', 'experiment', 'means', 'Peter', 'torn', 'duty', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'instincts', 'web', 'slings', 'are', 'blink', 'late', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'play', 'pizza', 'job', 'outs', 'Aunt', 'May', 'excellent', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'Harry', 'Peter', 'produce', 'Spider-Man', 'newspaperman', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'J.K', 'Simmons', 'still', 'Spidey', 'wringer', 'front', 'page', 'tabloid', 'Peter', 'seriously', 'contemplate', 'walking', 'away', 'heroism', 'when', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'engaged', 'Jameson', 'astronaut', 'son.Alvin', 'Sargent', 'screenplay', 'what', 'issues', 'withstand', 'opening', 'weekend', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'time', 'explore', 'Peter', 'connection', 'friends', 'family', 'citizens', 'Spider-Man', 'people', 'not', 'snippy', 'excellent', 'quot', 'dying', 'pride', 'quot', 'Harris', 'duty', 'dream', 'two-hour', 'comic', 'book', 'yet', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'working-class', 'ideals', 'subtextual', 'arguments', 'media', 'irresponsible', 'science', 'reject', 'elitism', 'notice', 'how', 'villainous', 'attacks', 'movies', 'are', 'everyday', 'commuters', 'Notice', 'Jonah', 'sides', 'other', 'what', 'be', 'maximum', 'effect', 'masses', 'embrace', 'Spider-Man', 'Notice', 'small', 'scene', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'theater', 'how', 'petty', 'circular', 'art', 'rules', 'conspire', 'keep', 'Peter', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'play', 'Raimi', 'Sargent', 'are', 'quiet', 'movie', 'underlines', 'classic', 'themes', 'so', 'gore', 'violence', 'nihilism', 'run', 'amok', 'bright', 'receptive', 'teens', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'quot', 'excellent', 'message.Which', ""n't"", 'mean', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Again', 'villain', 'thrown', 'background', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'more', 'imposing', 'Green', 'Goblin', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'memorable', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'serviceable', 'not', 'wicked', 'quot', 'quot', 'humor', 'droll', 'detached', 'menace', 'casual', 'Franco', 'decent', 'young', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'poorly-written', 'ill-motivated', 'villain-in-waiting', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'quot', 'less', 'promising', 'according', 'hints', 'dropped', 'end', 'movie.The', 'central', 'love', 'story', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'however', 'strong', 'enough', 'withstand', 'hammy', 'average', 'foes', 'expect', 'two', 'next', 'quot', 'Spider-Man.', 'quot', 'movie', 'final', 'shot', 'more', 'emotional', 'terrain', 'cover', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'revelations', 'Raimi', 'Sargent', 'remain', 'team', 'future', 'critical', 'groundwork', 'place', 'quot', 'Spider-Man', 'quot', 'girl', 'will', 'be', 'time']",Spider-Man 2

621421,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B00005JMQW,Scott,"[21, 23]","I have to start by saying I'm fairly biased about this film.  The original was one of my favorite movies, and I grew up reading the comics religiously.  That being said, I do feel I would be able to give it an unbiased review if I didn't like it, but thankfully, that was not the case.Spider-Man 2 is Sam Raimi at his best.  I've never been in a theater where I've felt an audience have so much fun at a movie.  This film had everything: incredible special effects, great dialogue, romantic themes, plenty of action, and some decent acting.  When I first saw the trailer for the film, I thought the special effects looked a bit shoddy, but the final release was amazing.  Everything was seamless, and the attention to detail was very noticeable.  One of the best parts aspects of this film is the comedic elements.  I didn't expect to laugh going into Spider-Man 2, but it pleasantly surprised me and I found it more humorous than most comedies.  The humor is very subtle and some of it is campy, but doesn't come off poorly.  It's great watching Parker trying to deliver pizzas in his costume to meet a deadline, or being forced to use an elevator and make small talk with the other occupant.  Raimi fans will also be pleased with a few Evil Dead II references, and one 30 second scene in a hospital realy stood out and showcased his talent for the horror genre.Raimi captures the essence of Parker so much more closely in this film.  The Parker in this film is given a closer focus on the fact that he still experiences much of the flaws that every other New Yorker has to go through.  From having to live in a run down apartment, to never having any money.  Too many Super heroes come from wealthy backgrounds and have an unlimited supply of money, but Spider-Man is just a below-average teenager who's given an incredible ability. And this is why he's so identifiable and likeable to the audience.  As I said, Raimi does an incredible job of showing this and I couldn't believe how closely the film version of Parker matched the bumbling science nerd I grew up with in the comics.  In addition, comics fans will love this film for all of the hidden references that are stacked in the movie.  There's a cameo of creator Stan Lee, a photographic reference to a famous comic panel of Spidey taking of his mask, oft-quoted lines from the book, and Dr. Connors and John Jameson appear, who feature into the comic very prominently.It does have a few faults, albeit they're hard to notice.  I found that some of Maguire's lines came off a bit forced, which I noticed in the first film.  Franko is also a little stiff as Harry Osborne.  I didn't notice any bad acting, but nothing I would consider Academy-worthy either.  There was also a subplot about a physical problem with Parker that felt out of place in the film and wasn't developed very well.

621423,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JMQW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[0, 0]","""Spider Man 2"" is probably a good reminder that I should not read movie reviews before checking out a flick.  Roger Ebert, as I recall, has dubbed ""SM2"" the best comic-book movie adaption ever made.  Perhaps I was suffering under these high expectations, but I found ""SM2"" to be a rather pedestrian, ""safe"" story with weak characters . . . and colossal special effects that almost, but not quite, save the day.""SM2"" opens with an imaginative comic-book montage that relates the key moments from the first movie.  As the movie opens, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling mightily to keep his life afloat.  No Bruce Wayne (heir to multi-gazillion dollar Wayne Enterprises), Parker is struggling to make it as a pizza delivery boy, closet superhero, and college student.  He does the superhero thing well, the college student thing poorly (a ""genius, but lazy""), and gets fired as a delivery boy.He's also struggling with his romance with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) . . . if romance it can be called.  Mary Jane, now a successful actress, still carries a torch for Parker and suspects that he is Spider Man, but is turned off by Parker's perpetual demonstrations of indifference.  Of course, we know that Parker is ""protecting"" her by refusing to acknowledge his love for her . . . the scenes of tortured blighted romance between these two don't quite work, as the depression gets weighty (and on several occasions MJ looks sleepy rather than sad).Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) almost steals the show as the tortured genius scientist.  The Spider Man series appears to thrive on tragic villains . . . both the Green Goblin of the first movie and Doc Ock are ambitious-yet-decent men who get corrupted (or trapped, depending on your perspective) by the results of their ambitions.  Maybe it says something about me, but I prefer my villains to be straight villains, a la the Joker from ""Batman.""  Still, Molina offers several touching scenes and gives the best performance in the movie.Much of the movie is given over to Parker's various struggles with his identity.  These are interesting, but begin to flag as every single aspect of Peter's life falls apart, and there is even a relatively unexplained faltering of Parker's spidey-powers which is apparently connected to Parker's psychic struggles.  Sure, it's great to have a ""human"" superhero, but this note gets hit a little too often in this movie.The action scenes are fantastic, and are much improved over the first film, which had a slightly cartoonish air to it.  There are several scenes to marvel at, and make the movie worth seeing all on their own.Director Raimi continues one unfortunate trend from the first movie.  Both films are pretty family-friendly -- while there is some violence, it is not very bloody at all, there is virtually no profanity, and the romance does not get beyond a few kisses.  But both films go to great lengths to include shots of voluptuous women in clingy clothing . . . and this is just jarring.  In the first film, we were treated to an inexplicable ""hello, nurse!"" shot of the lovely Ms. Dunst.  We get more of this in ""SM2"" -- the worst example coming when a character swoops down over an amazed crowd, and two women gasp in astonishment, mighty bosoms heaving mightily.  Since this was obviously a shot involving great special effects, this is not an accident.  I ask -- why?  I understand that films want to avoid being too saccharine so as to be ""uncool,"" but these cheap scenes aren't the way to go about it.A special effects bonanza and a decent story (as well as its other dubious ""features"" make ""Spider Man 2"" a perfect film for boys aged 10-15.",3,"Spidey Sense Mildy Intrigued, But Not Tingling",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,3645,"['Spider', 'Man', '2', 'probably', 'good', 'reminder', 'should', 'not', 'read', 'movie', 'reviews', 'checking', 'out', 'flick', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'recall', 'dubbed', 'SM2', 'best', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'adaption', 'ever', 'made', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'suffering', 'high', 'expectations', 'found', 'SM2', 'be', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'safe', 'story', 'weak', 'characters', 'colossal', 'special', 'effects', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'save', 'day', 'SM2', 'imaginative', 'comic-book', 'montage', 'key', 'moments', 'first', 'movie', 'movie', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'struggling', 'mightily', 'keep', 'life', 'afloat', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'heir', 'multi-gazillion', 'dollar', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'Parker', 'struggling', 'make', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'closet', 'superhero', 'college', 'student', 'superhero', 'thing', 'well', 'college', 'student', 'thing', 'poorly', 'genius', 'lazy', 'fired', 'delivery', 'boy.He', 'also', 'struggling', 'romance', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'romance', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'now', 'successful', 'actress', 'still', 'torch', 'Parker', 'Spider', 'Man', 'turned', 'off', 'Parker', 'perpetual', 'demonstrations', 'indifference', 'course', 'know', 'Parker', 'protecting', 'refusing', 'acknowledge', 'love', 'scenes', 'tortured', 'blighted', 'romance', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'depression', 'weighty', 'several', 'occasions', 'MJ', 'sleepy', 'rather', 'sad', '.Doc', 'Ock', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'almost', 'show', 'tortured', 'genius', 'scientist', 'Spider', 'Man', 'series', 'thrive', 'tragic', 'villains', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'first', 'movie', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'are', 'ambitious-yet-decent', 'men', 'who', 'get', 'corrupted', 'trapped', 'depending', 'perspective', 'results', 'ambitions', 'Maybe', 'something', 'prefer', 'villains', 'be', 'straight', 'villains', 'la', 'Joker', 'Batman', 'Still', 'Molina', 'several', 'touching', 'scenes', 'best', 'performance', 'movie.Much', 'movie', 'given', 'Parker', 'various', 'struggles', 'identity', 'are', 'interesting', 'begin', 'flag', 'single', 'aspect', 'Peter', 'life', 'apart', 'even', 'relatively', 'unexplained', 'faltering', 'Parker', 'spidey-powers', 'apparently', 'connected', 'Parker', 'psychic', 'struggles', 'Sure', 'great', 'have', 'human', 'superhero', 'note', 'hit', 'little', 'too', 'often', 'movie.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'are', 'much', 'improved', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'slightly', 'cartoonish', 'air', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'marvel', 'make', 'movie', 'seeing', 'own.Director', 'Raimi', 'one', 'unfortunate', 'trend', 'first', 'movie', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'family-friendly', 'violence', 'not', 'very', 'bloody', 'virtually', 'profanity', 'romance', 'not', 'get', 'few', 'kisses', 'films', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'include', 'shots', 'voluptuous', 'women', 'clingy', 'clothing', 'just', 'jarring', 'first', 'film', 'were', 'treated', 'inexplicable', 'hello', 'nurse', 'shot', 'lovely', 'Ms.', 'Dunst', 'get', 'more', 'SM2', 'worst', 'example', 'coming', 'when', 'character', 'down', 'amazed', 'crowd', 'two', 'women', 'gasp', 'astonishment', 'mighty', 'bosoms', 'heaving', 'mightily', 'was', 'obviously', 'shot', 'involving', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'not', 'accident', 'ask', 'why', 'understand', 'films', 'want', 'avoid', 'being', 'too', 'saccharine', 'so', 'be', 'uncool', 'cheap', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'way', 'go', 'it.A', 'special', 'effects', 'bonanza', 'decent', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'dubious', 'features', 'make', 'Spider', 'Man', '2', 'perfect', 'film', 'boys', 'aged', '10-15']",Spider-Man 2

621425,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B00005JMQW,Sean Pasek,"[1, 1]","The three pinnacle comic books films are Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, and the first Superman movie.  Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 have something in common; they have comic book fans making and writing the films.  If you're going to make a film about a comic book character, then you need someone who is familiar with the characters and the world they inhabit.  This is why so many of the comic book films today are not very good.Al Gough and Miles Millar co-wrote the screenplay for this film.  They are the same ""dynamic duo"" who gave life and re-ignited the Superman mythology with Smallville.  As comic book fans, they obviously knew what they were doing when they penned this fantastic sequel that surpasses the original at almost every turn.There is a reason why Spider-Man is Marvel's most popular character and the icon for it's company.  No one has the thumb on justice and doing what's right more than Superman, nor does any character surpass Batman for his psychological complexities. Spider-Man is the hero that everyone can relate to.  This is because Spider-Man is a hero with realistic problems that everyone has and goes through.  Despite his impressive array of abilities, Peter Parker has trouble attending classes at his university.  He can barely pay the rent each month.  There was once a scene in one of the comic book series, where Peter Parker has forgotten to do the laundry, and the only clean shirt he has to wear to work is a Strawberry Shortcake t-shirt that a co-worker at the Bugle had given him as a gag.  This is the life of Peter Parker.The movie really hones in on Peter's character and his problems.  He gets fired from his job for always being late.  He's late to watch Mary Jane in her play.  He's back-logged on his paychecks because he's already asked for an advance at the Bugle.  He's on the verge of failing his courses at school.  How is he able to balance his life as Peter and Spider-Man?  This is the inner conflict that befalls him.  At one point, the load is such a burden, that he feels he can't be Spider-Man anymore.  And, yet again, the audience can relate to his character.  The movie works so well because it focuses on Peter Parker instead of Spider-Man.  Batman Begins works because it focuses on Bruce Wayne instead of Batman.  And Smallville is a hit show because it focuses Clark Kent.  Audiences now want and demand rich and interesting characters.  And Spider-Man 2 delivers big-time!Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  I confess that I had my reservations about him when I first heard that he was cast to play the part.  He mirrors Peter Parker from the comic book so well.  Part of that tribute has to go to director Sam Raimi who is one of the biggest Spider-Man fans around.  He still has a poster of Spider-Man in his bedroom from when he was a kid.  Tobey is able to humanize Peter to such an extent that we share his joy and his pain.  Tobey has also mastered the ability to communicate the feelings of Peter with a simple look.  Words aren't necessary.  We all know what he's feeling.Spider-Man's new foe is Doctor Octopus.  He's wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.  Spider-Man has had many foes over the years, but during the 70s-80s, you can consider Doctor Octopus to be one of his best and most creative foes.  He is not as much a personal nemesis as the Green Goblin, but he has a great intelligence.  Molina give Doctor Octopus an almost sympathetic feel.  Given powers that are a bit similar to Peter's, Octopus obviously chooses a different path.The special effects are much better in this film than the last.  We see Spider-Man swinging in between cars and trucks, fighting Doctor Octopus against the sides of buildings and battling Doctor Octopus on top of a subway train.This DVD is fantastic with lots of great extras, including interviews with famous comic book artists about Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, and the women of Spider-Man's world.As a former comic book reader for nearly fifteen years, it's wonderful to see this fun character come to life on the big screen.  But, you don't need to be a comic book fan to enjoy it.  As I said, most everyone can relate to Spider-Man.",5,Ranks Right Up There with Superman and Batman Begins!,1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,4171,"['three', 'pinnacle', 'comic', 'books', 'films', 'are', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'making', 'writing', 'films', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'then', 'need', 'someone', 'who', 'familiar', 'characters', 'world', 'inhabit', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'today', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'good.Al', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'are', 'same', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'who', 'gave', 'life', 're-ignited', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'Smallville', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'obviously', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'when', 'penned', 'fantastic', 'sequel', 'original', 'almost', 'turn.There', 'reason', 'why', 'Spider-Man', 'Marvel', 'most', 'popular', 'character', 'icon', 'company', 'one', 'thumb', 'justice', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'more', 'Superman', 'character', 'surpass', 'Batman', 'psychological', 'complexities', 'Spider-Man', 'hero', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'Spider-Man', 'hero', 'realistic', 'problems', 'everyone', 'impressive', 'array', 'abilities', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'trouble', 'attending', 'classes', 'university', 'can', 'barely', 'pay', 'rent', 'month', 'was', 'once', 'scene', 'one', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'where', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'forgotten', 'do', 'laundry', 'only', 'clean', 'shirt', 'wear', 'work', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 't-shirt', 'co-worker', 'Bugle', 'had', 'given', 'gag', 'life', 'Peter', 'Parker.The', 'movie', 'really', 'Peter', 'character', 'problems', 'fired', 'job', 'always', 'being', 'late', 'late', 'watch', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'play', 'back-logged', 'paychecks', 'already', 'asked', 'advance', 'Bugle', 'verge', 'failing', 'courses', 'school', 'How', 'able', 'balance', 'life', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'inner', 'conflict', 'one', 'point', 'load', 'such', 'burden', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Spider-Man', 'anymore', 'yet', 'again', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'character', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'instead', 'Spider-Man', 'Batman', 'works', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'instead', 'Batman', 'Smallville', 'hit', 'show', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Audiences', 'now', 'want', 'demand', 'rich', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'delivers', 'big-time', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'wonderful', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'confess', 'had', 'reservations', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'cast', 'play', 'part', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'comic', 'book', 'so', 'well', 'Part', 'tribute', 'go', 'director', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'who', 'one', 'biggest', 'Spider-Man', 'fans', 'still', 'poster', 'Spider-Man', 'bedroom', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Tobey', 'able', 'humanize', 'Peter', 'such', 'extent', 'share', 'joy', 'pain', 'Tobey', 'also', 'mastered', 'ability', 'communicate', 'feelings', 'Peter', 'simple', 'look', 'Words', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'know', 'what', 'feeling.Spider-Man', 'new', 'foe', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'Spider-Man', 'had', 'many', 'foes', 'years', '70s-80s', 'can', 'consider', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'creative', 'foes', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'personal', 'nemesis', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'great', 'intelligence', 'Molina', 'give', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'almost', 'sympathetic', 'feel', 'Given', 'powers', 'are', 'bit', 'similar', 'Peter', 'Octopus', 'obviously', 'different', 'path.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'last', 'see', 'Spider-Man', 'swinging', 'cars', 'trucks', 'fighting', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'sides', 'buildings', 'battling', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'top', 'subway', 'train.This', 'DVD', 'fantastic', 'lots', 'great', 'extras', 'including', 'interviews', 'famous', 'comic', 'book', 'artists', 'Spider-Man', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'women', 'Spider-Man', 'world.As', 'former', 'comic', 'book', 'reader', 'nearly', 'fifteen', 'years', 'wonderful', 'see', 'fun', 'character', 'come', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'comic', 'book', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'said', 'most', 'everyone', 'can', 'relate', 'Spider-Man']",Spider-Man 2

This made the movie vary a little from the first, which was good. However, the web swinging scenes have become even more fake. It is so obvious that the are computer generated. Also, when did Spider-man become so strong? I understand that he is stronger than normal people, but is he really strong enough to stop a train speeding at 120 mph that has no brakes or hold up a wall of a building? I think that was a bit exaggerated. Also, when ""Doc Ock"" was building his fusion machine, didn't he ever consider the radiation? There was no protection from it and it wasn't mentioned in the movie. Obviously these guys also relied on Peter Parker for high school science.  But overall it was good movie, and I would recommend that you watch it if you want to see a good movie or if you liked the first one.

It's great how, in this sequel, Parker wanted to give up being a superhero, but later on, he didn't want to give up. He defeats the enemy, an evil man with octupus robot arms.

621430,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B00005JMQW,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[16, 44]","There was nothing Amazing or Spectacular in the Web of Spider-man 2. It truly is the one of worst movies ever made plain and simple. I don't understand how people constantly deride Batman and Robin and Catwoman but call this horrible film the best superhero movie of all time. At least Batman and Robin and Catwoman were movies that focused on one story and paced so they didn't to put you to sleep. This slow boring sequel didn't know what it wanted to be about. Spider-Man 2 tries to be an action movie, a comedy, a romance and an art house film all at once. This movie has such a bad case of ADHD you need Ritalin just to view the DVD.The posters and the trailers feature big action sequences between Spider-man and Doc Ock. That's false advertising. Only about ten percent of the movie has Spider-man fighting Doc Ock. Sixty percent of the movie focuses on the hard times of Peter Parker and his blubbering about how bad his life is. That's totally out of character for Peter Parker. Peter Parker would not act like the pitiful Midol abusing leg waxer featured in this movie. He loves his aunt and would do anything for her. He would not stand idly by as she was about to lose her house. He wouldn't be taking art photos to submit to the Daily Bugle knowing that Jameson wants only pictures of Spider-Man and those are his bread and butter. Peter Parker doesn't take his mask off in public for anyone (read the comics and watch the 90's animated series) because he fears that his enemies will get his family. He wouldn't be worrying about hurting Mary Jane; as a matter of fact he'd be dating someone else like Gwen Stacy, Betty Brant, or Deborah Whitman and getting on with his life. Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the confident young man of the first movie and the comics who took his problems in stride. I kept asking myself how did confident Peter Parker turn into an insecure whiny twerp like Dawson Leery?In addition to being totally out of character, for Peter Parker, this repetitive irrelevant footage (over an hour of it) does nothing to advance the story and slows the pacing of this movie to a crawl. I would like to ask Mr. Raimi what was the purpose of the scenes with the Landlord's daughter? The scene with Peter at the Laundromat, the scene where he saves the kid in the burning building, Aunt May's speech about heroes, the entire idiotic ""Raindrops"" sequence. The lady strumming the violin. The ridiculous overdone train battle in Midtown Manhattan (I live in New York and there are NO els in Manhattan.) What was with all the SCREAMING? Why does Peter take off his mask in public when he's so concerned about his enemies finding out his identity? Doesn't that contradict your own story a few minutes earlier? What did you do with over $200 million in Sony's money? How did an action packed Spider-Man movie turn into scraps that belonged on the cutting room floor?The other thirty percent of the film focuses on Mary Jane and her frustration at Peter Parker. How did the bright, bubbly strong independent woman of the first movie get replaced with this annoying whiney Joey Potter/ Lana Lang/ Mary Camden/ Felicity Porter WB network knock-off? Her story seems to be just another way for the writer to pile problems on poor Peter Parker. By the time Spidey finally confronts Doc Ock in the bank I was rooting for OCK to kill Spider-man so I could stop watching this horrible movie.Clearly the actors aren't at fault. Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst act well in spite of the horrible script given them. James Franco is clearly frustrated here; you can see it in his performance. It's justified; they give him absolutely nothing to do in this screenplay except pout and pimpsmack Parker. Rosemary Harris is the only one who overcomes the puerile script and takes Aunt May to a new level. J.K. Simmons is still a scene-stealer here as J. Jonah Jameson. The producers of this movie did a terrible disservice to Alfred Molina. His role is so underdeveloped that we don't clearly know what he wants or why he wants it. His character doesn't even feel dangerous or threatening; he's just fodder to feed the franchise. The only bad actor here really is the CGI; it's actually worse than it was in the first movie. We really could have done without those ridiculous green toy helicopters in the end.It's clear to me Sam Raimi's hands were tied by the horrible screenplay and producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. They try to apply the Smallville model of storytelling to the Spider-Man franchise and fail miserably. If you've watched that show you know how slow it is and how underdeveloped the characters are. Most of the show (at least 45 minutes of each episode) focuses on Lana and Clark fawning over each other. And that's the big problem here. This wasn't a Spider-man sequel; it's a Smallville movie with Spider-Man's name on it.As a longtime comic fan I anxiously anticipated seeing Spider-Man 2 all year. Having seen the film I have never been so disappointed in my life. I feel so cheated by this movie that I will not be seeing Spider-Man 3 or any other future films in the franchise. If you have to see it, borrow it from the library or borrow it from a friend. This one isn't worth paying Marvel Value Stamps for.",1,Makes Batman & Robin look like Oscar material.

If getting bitten by a spider made me buff overnight, gave me perfect vision and the ability to climb walls, I don't think I would have a low self-image, but that's just me. Peter Parker is an odd one. He's in love w/ his childhood friend, but feels that allowing himself to be a part of her life will endanger her because he has &quot;enemies.&quot; Of course, he makes enemies by chasing sirens.This film is full of contradictions. Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina) dons this ridiculous 22nd century technology that looks like a rip-off of the &quot;squiddy&quot; in &quot;The Matrix&quot; that supposedly helps him man-handle his own man-made sun (his version of creating a fusion reactor) - yet the biggest newspaper in town is doing cut &amp; paste mock-ups like a high school journalism class... no computers... and they send their photographer out with a Nikon F1. Pulleaaase! They stopped making the F1 in 1979. If at least it was an F3, that I could buy - or more likely, an F5.Molina's Jekyl/Hyde relationship w/ his technological enhancements makes him the anti-hero - his flabby belly and flabby chests ripple in the wind without shame, since he can now climb walls and kill the innocent with a swipe of his massive tenticles.Now hopelessly fused with his technological prosthetics that have their own artificial intelligence, the newly dubbed &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; is on a mission to get Spiderman out of his way, in what is one extremely cool twist on the &quot;bullet time&quot; scenes from the first &quot;Matrix&quot; film and the kung-fu action on top of semi-tractor-trailers in the Matrix sequel.Doc Ock is causing millions of dollars of damage all over the city, yet no one has thought of bringing in an armed Apache helicopter with heat-seaking missles. Dr. Octopus can swing, but he can't fly.  A miniture version of our own sun is tossed into the Hudson River to &quot;extinguish&quot; it, and while it glows yellow-hot, even the water touching the &quot;sun&quot; isn't boiling or turning into steam.There are holes all over this story, but when it's all said and done, you don't really care. You want Peter to stop tripping over his own tongue and tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) that he loves her already and for everyone to hold hands and get along... but this is based on the dark Spiderman comic, where Spidey makes everyone else happy, but must must be sad and lonely himself. The action scenes are beautiful and exciting to watch - clever choreography and a lot of really funny moments where the film doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie definitely sets itself up for a sequel on many fronts.  Will the Green Lantern live again? Will we see a new Dr. Octopus - with rusty, yet sparky tenticles? Will Peter &amp; MJ get married and will they end up with an egg-sac full of mutant spiderlings? Don't baby spiders eat their mothers? Oh Hollywood - there is no telling what they will come up with for the sequel.No sex scenes and I don't even remember one foul word in the movie. There is violence, but nothing compared to the evening news. I would say the PG-13 rating is appropriate.

621432,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B00005JMQW,Simon Crowe,"[4, 10]","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is burning the candle at both ends. While trying to police the streets as Spider Man at night, he's going to school and working do the day, but he can't keep it up. Meanwhile, he's losing touch with his friends Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry (James Franco), who is still hacked off about the death of his father at Spidey's hands in S-M 1.This second movie largely concerns itself with whether Peter will give up his heroism to pursue MJ and his studies, or follow his destiny as Spider-Man. These existensial questions crowd out the action plot, which involves a mad scientist (Alfred Molina) who is trying to.... do something with a big glowing machine.There's so much blather about duty, responsibility, and the use of power in SPIDER-MAN 2 that I have to say I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies with a better sense of pace. Maguire, terminally diffident, spends a lot of time looking confused and bumbling around, while Dunst and Franco are wasted. Molina finds some nuance in his role, but the script disappears him for far too long in mid-film. Rosemary Harris is good as Aunt May, but she's saddled with a ridiculous speech about heroism.The action scenes do perk things up, especially when Maguire and Molina fight on a moving train, and although I'm not a fan of digital effects I thought they were well blended in here.One other major quibble: The movie suggests that Peter's web-spinning power is tied to his self-esteem, which contradicts the traditional radioactive spider storyline. Peter has no trouble getting his power back when the story requires it.Also with JK Simmons, Bill Nunn, Dylan Baker, Cliff Robertson, and Willem Dafoe as the ghost of Hamlet's father (oops, I mean Dr. Osborn)SPIDER MAN 2 is a glum popcorn movie that tries and fails to achieve profundity .....",2,disappointing,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,1820,"['Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'burning', 'candle', 'ends', 'trying', 'police', 'streets', 'Spider', 'Man', 'night', 'going', 'school', 'working', 'do', 'day', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'losing', 'touch', 'friends', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Harry', 'James', 'Franco', 'who', 'still', 'hacked', 'off', 'death', 'father', 'Spidey', 'hands', 'S-M', '1.This', 'second', 'movie', 'largely', 'Peter', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'heroism', 'pursue', 'MJ', 'studies', 'follow', 'destiny', 'Spider-Man', 'existensial', 'questions', 'crowd', 'out', 'action', 'plot', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'who', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'big', 'glowing', 'so', 'much', 'blather', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'use', 'power', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'movies', 'better', 'sense', 'pace', 'Maguire', 'terminally', 'diffident', 'lot', 'time', 'looking', 'confused', 'bumbling', 'around', 'Dunst', 'Franco', 'are', 'wasted', 'Molina', 'nuance', 'role', 'script', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'mid-film', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'good', 'Aunt', 'May', 'saddled', 'ridiculous', 'speech', 'heroism.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', 'perk', 'things', 'up', 'especially', 'when', 'Maguire', 'Molina', 'fight', 'moving', 'train', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'digital', 'effects', 'thought', 'were', 'well', 'blended', 'here.One', 'other', 'major', 'quibble', 'movie', 'Peter', 'web-spinning', 'power', 'tied', 'self-esteem', 'traditional', 'radioactive', 'spider', 'storyline', 'Peter', 'trouble', 'getting', 'power', 'back', 'when', 'story', 'it.Also', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'Bill', 'Nunn', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'ghost', 'Hamlet', 'father', 'oops', 'mean', 'Dr.', 'Osborn', 'SPIDER', 'MAN', '2', 'glum', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'tries', 'fails', 'achieve', 'profundity', '..']",Spider-Man 2

I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one.

That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",4,"A better film than the first, however...",1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,1937,"['Spider-Man', '2', 'better', 'original', 'Spider-Man', 'feel', 'should', 'get', 'way', 'first', 'most', 'sequels', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'topping', 'first', 'one', 'However', 'feel', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'only', 'better', 'sense', 'same', 'production', 'staff', 'remade', 'Spider-Man', 'should', 'naturally', 'be', 'better', 'what', 'sequel', 'feels', 'literal', 'remake', 'spiced', 'elements', 'here', 'there', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'way', 'thought', 'sequel', 'should', 'be.Effects', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'tentacles', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'make', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'battles', 'including', 'centerpiece', 'runaway', 'train', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'give', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'more', 'work', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Dafoe', 'did', 'Goblin', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'wacky', 'villain', 'James', 'Franco', 'develop', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'out', 'high-caliber', 'script', 'work', 'one', 'worst', 'superhero', 'cliches', 'main', 'plot', 'hero', 'calling', 'never', 'convincing', 'film', 'wait', 'Peter', 'realize', 'things', ""'ve"", 'known', 'along', 'Character', 'relationships', 'well-acted', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'progressed', 'first', 'movie', ""'re"", 'still', 'treading', 'Peter/Mary', 'Jane', 'love', 'triangle', 'just', 'different', 'third', 'wheel', 'Harry', 'still', 'on/off', 'friendship', 'Peter', 'are', 'nice', 'plot', 'twists', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'towards', 'end', 'most', 'film', 'wasted', 'exact', 'same', 'angst', 'first', 'one', 'story', 'supposedly', 'set', '3', 'years', 'later', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', '3', 'days.We', 'get', 'dvd', 'good', 'extras', 'audio/video', 'presentation', 'enjoy', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'own', 'nice', 'have', 'dvd', 'library', 'sequel', 'not', 'fresh', 'enough', 'Hopefully', 'next', 'year', 'Spider-Man', '3', 'will', 'fix']",Spider-Man 2

I managed to get my hands on a region 3 disc and thought I was going to waste 2 hours of my time. But being a Spidey fan I thought what the heck.I was wrong. Dead Wrong. This is a whole new movie. All the scenes are totally reworked. The fight scenes are longer and more violent (that is great). The added scenes to the movie actually improves on the theater version. I guess Sam Raimi had a look at his movie and said hey why don't we do that scene we had done in a new way... The closest thing I have ever come across something like this is the Teddy Rawling's Alien 3 Cut. It is a whole new cut and elevates the original movie. Sure it is 8 minutes longer but nearly all the scenes are woven together from a different cut.The most obvious is the elevator scene. Here the guy who is stuck in the elevator actually knew he was talking to the real spidey. The original cut features him speaking about the spidey outfit to someone he thought was an impostor. Here the elevator guy wanted to sell his marketing plan to the real spidey.Another example is the first fight with Doc Oct. The extended version shows the fight taking place from the high rise buildings and continues inside an office. It is more violent and more dramatic. The operating scene where Doc Oct was introduce is remade to look like a scene from the ""Evil Dead"". I have not dwell into the features yet.I hope this convinces you as much as it convinced me that the Spiderman series is one with its intergrity in tact. I won't tell you more and save the rest for you to find out and savour. But trust me buy this, this is the best thing that came out since Lord of the Rings (Extended, Superman 2 (Richard Donner's Cut), Daredevil (Director's Cut) and Kingdom of Heaven (Director's Cut).

This is not true in Spider Man 2's case.  Spider Man 2 FAR surpasses the first Spider Man movie and is quite possibly the best Superhero film ever made!The movie begins with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) showing up late to work.  He delivers pizzas but when he shows up late he only has seven minutes to deliever them.  Not an easy task for Peter Parker but for Spider Man, no problem!  He delievers the pizzas but he delivers them late and therefore losses his job.  It's quite easy to see what the film is trying to tell you right off the bat! It's hard being a Super Hero and living your own life.Throughout the first half of the movie you see what being Spider-Man really does to Parker.  His grades are slipping, he can hardly pay the rent where he's staying and he misses a play that Mary Jane is performing in, one of which he promised to be to... but as the film goes to show, it isn't easy being a hero.Doc Ock in this film is something else.  He's portrayed brilliantly and as the film goes to show, his coming about is merely an accident.  Dr. Octavious is merely trying to harness fusion energy, the power of the sun in the palm of his hand, but when the experiment goes awry the mechanical arms, controlled by AI are able to take over his mind.  Now he plans to redo the experiment knowing full well that he could decimate the entire city.The characters are developed very nicely.  Harry Osboourne seeking revenge on Spider-Man and agreeing to help Doc Ock get him.  Mary Jane deciding that she can't be with Peter because Peter can't be there for her and Aunt May who is suffering greatly from Uncle Ben's death and has financial problems of her own.But among all the characters, Peter Parker is perhaps the most well developed.  Aside from seeing how he goes about being Spider-Man the film shows how he has to go through a great deal with his struggles among friends.By far Spider Man 2 is the most breathtaking Super Hero film ever crafted. This isn't like Batman where we see him take on a new villian with little connection to the first one.  In fact, this film makes sure you remember the first one as it takes off from where the first one left off.  As the film opens up it shows clips from the first film to remind you of what happened.It's a grand film that no one should miss.  Truly a great accomplishment in Cinema.

621439,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JMQW,S. Schell,"[1, 1]","There are many films whose storylines have encouraged sequels - many fail to be as good as the original, an audience's expectations raised due to the freshness of characters and plotlines.  There are only two that come to my mind that surpass their predecessors: ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"".  I can now add an easy third to my list, and ""Spider-Man 2"" is, without a doubt, that third movie.The story continues with Peter Parker (so superlatively played by the boyish, nerdy Maguire) struggling through college, his grades rapidly declining because of the countless hours spent swinging about the city saving lives.  His one true love Mary Jane (Dunst) is now a Broadway actress and model, her face plastered on billboards and posters everywhere.  Aunt May has fallen on hard times, the bank threatening to foreclose on her home and Harry Osborn (Franco), now the proprietor of Oscorp, is still bent on revenge against Spider-Man for the death of his father Norman (the Green Goblin of 2002's ""Spider-Man"", played by Willem Dafoe).Time to throw a superb supervillain into the mix.Enter Dr. Otto Octavius (Molina), another scientist earning Peter's utmost esteem with a breakthrough experiment that will change the face of nuclear physics for years to come.  During a presentation of his latest invention that would make Oscorp a multi-million dollar enterprise again, the exposition goes horribly awry and ""Doc Ock"" is left with four mechanical tentacles bolted into his spinal column, each solid steel ""arm"" independently functional...and menacing.Torn between the sacrificial life of a superhero and the normal life he truly wants, Pete decides to throw in the towel, surrendering his Spider suit to the trash and coming clean to Mary Jane about his feelings for her.Or does he?With Doc Ock up to no good and Harry's growing animosity for the masked crusader, Peter has his work cut out for him and there is no simple evasion of his civic duty.So many aspects of this film aid in the surmounting of the original, primarily the overwhelming amount of CGI that was handsomely paid for ($54 million alone was spent on digital effects) on a $200 million budget.  What will really take your breath away are the two fight sequences between Doc Ock and Spidey, a melee atop a clock tower and a confrontation aboard a speeding ""el"" train gasp-inducing.  You'll become so engrossed by the intense physical combat onscreen that you'll forget that the two men you see fighting are not really men at all - they're computer-generated images (for the most part).  We even get an illustrated recap of the first film during the opening credits with original artwork by Alex Ross (""Kingdom Come"").  Fanboys will be especially proud of director Sam Raimi's homage to the comic, the shot of Peter depositing the Spidey suit into an alley dumpster taken directly from a panel in Issue #50 entitled ""Spider-Man No More"".Raimi was so eager to get started on the sequel that he signed on to direct more than a month before the first film was even released and shooting began before the final draft of the script was completed.  Alvin Sargent, along with Michael Chabon, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar penned the screenplay with the guidance of Spider-Man creators Stan Lee (who has a cameo) and Steve Ditko and took the story out into left field.  Whereas ""Spider-Man"" relied on character establishment and a little schmaltz to win over its audience, ""Spider-Man 2"" gets dipped in a vat of serious drama, allowing every actor to really show their wares.Maguire is excellent - Raimi knew what he was doing when he cast the then 26-year-old after seeing his portrayal of Homer Wells in 1999's ""The Cider House Rules"".  His participation in the sequel became hesitant when he was injured during a stunt in ""Seabiscuit"" and suffered severe back pains for several months.  A second injury (a broken arm) further delayed shooting, but Maguire rode the storm and kept Jake Gyllenhaal (the actor in mind to replace him, not to mention Dunst's current squeeze) from taking the role that was rightfully his.Raimi made another wise casting decision with British thespian Alfred Molina, a chameleon of an actor who first got recognition as Indiana Jones' greedy jungle guide Satipo (""You throw me the idol, I throw you the whip!"") in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""; after the titillating scene where he is covered head-to-toe with tarantulas, Molina is certainly familiar with arachnids and the atmosphere of the ""Spider-Man"" set suit him well.  He eats the lens as Doc Ock, playing the character with a combination of zeal and earnestness.  After Willem Dafoe's over-the-top theatrics as the Green Goblin, Molina is a breath of fresh air and gives Doc Ock something very important - integrity.  Other actors who were considered for the role included Sam Neill (eh...), Robert DeNiro (`scuse me?), Ed Harris (no thanks) and Chris Cooper (sorry, I just keep thinking Col. Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps).  Aren't you glad Molina made the cut?Dunst, still equipped with her B-movie scream, also gets a chance to put her talents to the test and makes Mary Jane a stronger, more independent woman with much less of a ""damsel-in-distress"" approach than the previous film.  James Franco is excellent this second time around as Harry Osborn, his bitterness towards Spider-Man spectacularly rendered through his dark, frigid glowering.  Rosemary Harris, a mere appendage in the first, gets to shine considerably as Aunt May, the Oscar-winning actress's dramatic prowess manifested in her scenes with Maguire.  J.K. Simmons is still a ball of fire as J. Jonah Jameson, senior editor of the Daily Bugle, with his perpetual anti-hero sentiments of Spider-Man and Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant) and Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson) reprise their roles with pride.The film ends once again on a climactic note, setting the stage for a spectacular sequel and you'll have a pretty good idea which villain will make an appearance.  Sony Pictures greenlighted a third installment back in March of this year - the movie is slated for a 2007 release, but may even be pushed to 2006 if production goes well.  Let us hope so, because if ""Spider-Man 2"" is a promise of an even greater film to come, we're all in for a real treat!",5,Stunning Sequel,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,6289,"['are', 'many', 'films',

""Spider-Man 2"" feels more like a part of a ""Greek tragedy"" than a superhero film. The film is too much of a downer, with tragedy after tragedy taking place, before the film's uplifting-but-unimpressive climax. The actors do what they can, and the film features some impressive fight sequences and visual effects, but nothing saves the movie from a depressing, highly melodramatic story. Not only is this a disappointing sequel to ""Spider-Man,"" but it is also a fairly poor entry into the pantheon of superhero films.

621442,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JMQW,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[2, 2]","I love to be proven both right and wrong at the same time.  I was a bit underwhelmed with the original film although it was pleasing enough and I was happy to see my all-time favorite comic-book icon swing onto the silver screen, but I did predict that this series of films could improve with time as the core elements were all there, but I never ever thought they would produce such a fantastic film as this one.  The original cast, which was great, returns bringing more depth to their roles.  Tobey was great as Peter Parker, but his voice-over Spider-Man had a lot to be desired.  His sense of comic-timing, a Spidey trademark, was way off and unconvincing as was the CGI Spider-Man.  Those issues have been put to rest.Maguire IS Parker/Spider-Man!  The CGI effects are enormously improved upon and now very believable.  The show-stopping scene of the runaway train is nothing less than jaw-dropping.  To beef up the believability factor we get numerous scenes of a real stuntman and Spidey without his mask on which allows us to feel more for Maguire as a character and hero.The problems with the over-top-acting of Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin villain is brushed aside with this new villain that is marvelously played by Alfred Molina.  We honestly like this guy when we meet him and feel great empathy for his disasterous turn.  The effects involving his character are perhaps the best ever created for a comic-book transfer to film villain.  You just can't believe your eyes.  It's astounding.I do not know how they will top this one, but this is arguably the very best comic-book to film ever made.  It does everything a film should do and then some.  It does everything a sequel is supposed to which is continue the storyline in a believable manner.  Again, it does that and then some.  It leaves the audience wanting more and that is the highest compliment any audience or reviewer can say about a film.

He had girl problems, job problems, money problems, and all the other things people deal with in their day-to-day lives.  Naturally, I was concerned when I heard that they were going to make the first movie, because I thought Hollywood would focus on the super-hero stuff and downplay the human element of Spider-man that I always thought was so important.Wrong.I was also concerned when I heard there would be a sequel, since sequels are never as good as the first movies, right?  Sure, Doc Ock would make it interesting since he was always one of Spider-man's most formidable enemies, but I had doubts, nonetheless.Wrong again.This movie, like the first, has tons of heart, like a good super-hero movie should, like Spider-man should.  Doc Ock is a monster, and he isn't; Spider-man is a super-hero, and he isn't - they both grapple to come to terms with their humanity and their alter-egos at the same time.All actors concerned turned in huge performances: Alfred Molina, Toby Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst.  I can't pick between them - they all make a believer out of me.  With only a little imagination, I could imagine myself with super powers but plagued with head problems, or a humanitarian genius becoming lost in my work, and a threat to society.  For all the above, I give this movie my highest rating - *****The DVD package is produced very well also.  There are two discs with about eight or ten hours of extra content, interviews, ""making of"", and video game information.  I especially liked the ""Ock-umentary"" about bringing Doc Ock from the comics to the screen.

The box is a black with webbing background, with the image from the final release poster (Spider-Man holding onto Mary Jane) in the center (as of this review, Amazon doesn't have an image of the box art to show).The movie itself is up there as one of the best sequels in recent memory. Right up there with ""The Godfather part II"", ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Terminator 2"", & ""Aliens"".After his life hits the skids, Peter Parker hangs up his webs as Spider-Man, convinced that New York's popular web-slinger has done nothing to Peter but brought emotional pain to his family & friends and destroyed his life as a whole. But, Mr. Parker is about to get an unwanted second opinion in the form of a certain six-armed Doctor, wreaking havoc throughout New York City.With great power comes great responsibility.But, at what cost?The film has quite a few memorable moments both dramatically, as well as action (the film doesn't drag). The scene where Peter finally confesses to his Aunt what happened the day of his Uncle's death is one of the more powerful and heartbreaking in the film. The SFX are leaps and bounds above the first film. The subway battle is the best in the series so far and the bank heist fight isn't too shabby either.If you missed this one in its theatrical run, well, your loss, loser!

The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City.  The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character.  The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero.

621454,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B00005JMQW,"the one and only ""david""","[15, 18]","Spiderman 2 was a HUGE success. Back when the first movie came out I admit that I did not want to see it. I thought it was rather dumb, but after watching the first movie on DVD I was surprised by how well done it was. So in order to make sure I saw the second movie on the big screen I immediately went out and waited almost two hours to see the second one on the day it came out. And it did not disappoint......This movie picks up where Peter Parker [Tobey McGuire], aka spiderman, is now doing. Although the first movie showed how much fun Parker was having, the second movie goes into detail on how the super powers can take its toll on the young guy. Parker is falling behind in his classes from lack of sleep, his teachers are concerned and want him to do better.Then to add insult to injury his job isn't exactly great also. Some of the opening scenes have him racing to try and get a pizza to a costumer on time, only to be a few minutes late. Can't win them all the time! And probably the biggest pressure is one that gets us all, love. Parker realizes that he is in love with his best friend, Mary Jane [Kirsten Dundst], but cant seem to get it off his chest. One memerable scene is that he tells his friend how much he loves her, only to say it to the dead end of a telephone reciever.Of course this is right on time when an evil villan is about to make his grand entrance. Alfred Molina gives a surprisingly great role as Dr. Octopus, a man with four seemingly invincible metal arms that are attached to his spine after a horrendous accident.  He first doesn't want to be evil, his plan was to get the arms off him. However, something gets inside his head, and he realizes he needs to steal money in order to get the parts for his machine that he needs.Basically that is the main plot, Parker struggles to clear things out of his head, and Dr. Octopus turns to a life of crime. But that isn't all, the son of the Green Goblin, the main villan from the first blockbuster show, wants spiderman dead, for revenge on what spiderman did to his dad. And the ironic twist is that he is also Parker's best buddy, who could have seen that coming?All in all, this is a fantastic movie, dont listen to that idiot who says that the two moives suck, they are anything but bad. The  special effects are brilliant, and it truly is one of the best superhero movie ever made. Lots of intense fight scenes, my favorite one being on the train, and an emotional decision by Dr. Octopus at the end are fantastic.And did I mention the fact that Tobey McGuire gives an absolutely credible performance as the nerd by day Parker, and the awsome spiderman by night? Lots of great and suspensful scenes guarantees that this movie will never get boring, so buy it when it comes out on DVD!",5,It deserves so many more stars......,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2773,"['Spiderman', '2', 'was', 'HUGE', 'success', 'Back', 'when', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'admit', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'thought', 'was', 'rather', 'dumb', 'watching', 'first', 'movie', 'DVD', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'So', 'order', 'make', 'sure', 'saw', 'second', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'immediately', 'went', 'waited', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'see', 'second', 'one', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'movie', 'up', 'where', 'Peter', 'Parker', '[', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', ']', 'aka', 'spiderman', 'now', 'doing', 'first', 'movie', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'Parker', 'was', 'having', 'second', 'movie', 'detail', 'how', 'super', 'powers', 'can', 'take', 'toll', 'young', 'guy', 'Parker', 'falling', 'classes', 'lack', 'sleep', 'teachers', 'are', 'concerned', 'want', 'do', 'better.Then', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'job', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'great', 'also', 'opening', 'scenes', 'have', 'racing', 'try', 'get', 'pizza', 'costumer', 'time', 'only', 'be', 'few', 'minutes', 'late', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'time', 'probably', 'biggest', 'pressure', 'one', 'love', 'Parker', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'Mary', 'Jane', '[', 'Kirsten', 'Dundst', ']', 'cant', 'seem', 'get', 'off', 'chest', 'One', 'memerable', 'scene', 'friend', 'how', 'much', 'only', 'say', 'dead', 'end', 'telephone', 'reciever.Of', 'course', 'right', 'time', 'when', 'evil', 'villan', 'make', 'grand', 'entrance', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'man', 'four', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'metal', 'arms', 'are', 'attached', 'spine', 'horrendous', 'accident', 'first', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'evil', 'plan', 'was', 'get', 'arms', 'However', 'something', 'head', 'steal', 'money', 'order', 'get', 'parts', 'machine', 'needs.Basically', 'main', 'plot', 'Parker', 'clear', 'things', 'head', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'life', 'crime', ""n't"", 'all', 'son', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'main', 'villan', 'first', 'blockbuster', 'show', 'spiderman', 'dead', 'revenge', 'what', 'spiderman', 'did', 'dad', 'ironic', 'twist', 'also', 'Parker', 'best', 'buddy', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'dont', 'idiot', 'who', 'two', 'moives', 'suck', 'are', 'anything', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'brilliant', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Lots', 'intense', 'fight', 'scenes', 'favorite', 'one', 'being', 'train', 'emotional', 'decision', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'end', 'are', 'fantastic.And', 'did', 'mention', 'fact', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'absolutely', 'credible', 'performance', 'nerd', 'day', 'Parker', 'awsome', 'spiderman', 'night', 'Lots', 'great', 'suspensful', 'scenes', 'guarantees', 'movie', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'boring', 'so', 'buy', 'when', 'out', 'DVD']",Spider-Man 2

It's not as much fun and doesn't go anywhere new in filmmaking, but does address some important issues, as the first one did.  I saw it at a recording of MTV's ""Moviehouse"" here in LA on the 14th.Alfred Molina does a good job with Dr. Octopus, but didn't really seem like that much of a bad guy, especially with the plot addition of giving his tentacles their own intelligence.  Maybe they did that on purpose, but it's harder to get into a movie where the bad guy is generally likeable.  The other bad guy set up scenes were pretty good, too - we meet the Professor that probably becomes the Lizard later on in the franchise, and there's an absolutely fabulous scene where Harry discovers his dad's Green Goblin laboratory.  We even got to see slightly more of the girl who becomes the Black Cat.  Still no Venom, though.The plot drags some, but not that bad.  MaGuire does a good job of demonstrating angst, and Dunst makes MJ stronger than she was in the first one.  I wish that they would have explained why he was having the problems that he did as Spiderman, and how the problem was fixed, though.A movie with the taglines ""Choice"" and ""Sacrifice"" isn't bound to be very happy or fun.  But it's a good way to spend a couple of hours, and makes some good points.  The main thing I loved about it was the deemphasis on material wealth, and the idea of doing what needs to be done.

Very rare combination nowadays.After last years disasters(including HULK, DAREDEVIL, AND THE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT X2) We needed a movie that would give super heroe movies a good name. And Sam Raimi is our chosen one. Spiderman 2 is mainly based upon the troubled life of Peter Parker. Those who have seen the original Spiderman(My favorite super hero movie) know that as it was in the comic books Peter Parker is bitten by a super spider and gets super powers. Even though the ending of the original seemed to be a happily ever after...well. Now Peter Parker's life is a struggle. He's just lost his pizza delivery job on account that he was saving 2 kid's lives and he was late to deliever a dang PIZZA????????? He lives in a crummy apartment and he's broke. His Aunt May is being taken from her home becuase she's also broke, Harry Osbourne his best friend is still trying to kill his alter ego whom Harry thinks murdered his father, and he is flunking college. But worst of all, He can't even confess his love to Mary Jane Watson because he is afraid of what his enemies will do if they find out that he is Spiderman so she's marrying another dude. The pressure is so much that he decides to stop being a hero and live a normal life. He has a chance to improve  his whole life, but bad timing. After an experiment gone wrong, Otto Octavius, one of Peter's hero is transformed in to a man with four mechanical arms. Otto's wife dies during the experiment and as in the comics, he turns in to a villain. Peter is forced back in to the game when Octavius kidnaps M.J and demands Spiderman. He comes back for one final battle with Octavius and realizes that Spiderman is his life and he could not live with himself if he just let offenders go unpunished. Great action scenes.

621463,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B00005JMQW,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 0]","Better than the original. I'm sure plenty of people will hear that when they hear people talk about this movie, and what can I say except that it's true. Yes, that's right expect numbers to be divisible by zero, mass to exceed the speed of light, objects to fall faster than 9.8 m/s^2, and Wile E. Coyote to remain in the air even after he has looked down, because a sequel has bested the original. Spiderman 2 has joined that rare pantheon of films that are actually better than the original: Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, and Dawn of the Dead to name a few (and the last one's stretching it).At the heart of this movie is an actor who has really grown into his own and taken America's heart by storm. He's always been talented, but this is the movie that has really catapulted him to superstardom. That's right, Alfred Molina, you had me at ""Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."" Seriously though, Alfred Molina has been in every movie ever, and I didn't even know it until I saw this movie last year. He must have a bet going with Jude Law to see who can be in more films. Of course, he does a fine job in this film, and must be a really good actor because I didn't recognize I had seen him previously in about fifty movies, he just blends into the character.Everyone does an excellent job in this film (except for Kirstin Dunst. Now that we know Topher Grace is going to be in the next film can't he bring over the redhaired chick from That 70's Show to play Mary Jane). Actors are often reiterating that comedy is the hardest thing to do (although it doesn't seem like the Academy is ever listening to them), and in Spiderman 2 they not only need to master comedy but make believable drama in the midst of complete fantasy. This change of gears isn't an easy thing to do I'm sure. At one pivotal point in the film Peter Parker has to confess to his aunt that he was responsible for her husband's death, and later in the film there is a montage that can only be described as an homage to sixties television. Tobe Maguire is able to play these extremes confidently and sells us the character in both scenes.The biggest strength of this film is that Sam Raimi is able to mesh together so many genres without it seeming jarring. During the course of the film it takes on the characteristics of a drama, comedy, romance, horror, action-adventure, cartoon, monster movie, and none feels forced or out of place. Most of these genres aren't subservient to the others either. It could just as easily be argued that this film is a comedy as it could be argued that it is it is a drama or action-adventure. I have rarely seen this even a mixture of genre without the film itself feeling uneven.Speaking of comedy, that is the single biggest advance between this film and the last. In the original Spiderman they just expected us to accept the cheesy one-liners as camp. This was fine for those who had read old comics before and were in on the gag, but those who hadn't just thought it was corny. The aforementioned montage to Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head is perhaps the biggest risk the film takes, but the film makers are so confident that it works perfectly. It is easily the funniest part of the film.What makes the Spiderman films in general so great is that Sam Raimi really believes that these characters have depth. In fact, I don't think I've seen two films since this movie came out, coming from a major Hollywood studio, with characters as developed as these are. Sam Raimi is not afraid to put real people in the middle of what can be essentially a big cartoon. This is only fitting because that was the exact characteristic that made Stan Lee such a genius.

621467,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005JMQW,trebe,"[0, 0]","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), was an uneven, and somewhat unsteady feature film debut, for the intrepid webhead.  With the preliminaries out of the way, Spider-Man 2 (2004) is a bit scattered in places, but is still a more streamlined and focused effort, that solidly delivers action, drama, and excitement.  Technical advances in special effects, and a tighter screenplay, contribute to the impressiveness of the film.Alfred Molina is cast as Dr. Otto Octavius, and he nails the character almost perfectly.  Although it might have been better if they had him keep his shirt on, and made him look slimmer.  Donna Murphy as Octavius's wife Rosalie, has a brief but key role, demonstrating that Otto is really a lovable, sensitive guy, who only becomes delusional, when his mind is taken over by his mechanical arms.The sequel picks up some two years later, with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) in college and living in New York City, but struggling to keep a steady job, pay his rent, and maintain his grades.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has moved on, and is involved with astronaut John Jameson (Daniel Gillies), son of J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Harry Osborn (James Franco) has assumed a significant role in Oscorp, and is backing Dr. Octavius's fusion experiment.  When an accident occurs during a test, Rosalie is killed, and a set of `smart' mechanical arms becomes fused to Octavius's body.  The arms take over his mind, and after disposing of a surgical team, Octavius decides to finance his fusion experiments by turning to crime.  Doc Ock and Spidey tangle for the first time, in a spectacular battle inside a bank, which continues up on the side of a building, with a very plucky Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), in the middle of the fray.The subtext of the film is Peter's inner conflict about being Spider-Man, which apparently is keeping him from finding happiness.  The conflict manifests physically, when Peter becomes nearsighted, and occasionally loses the ability to generate his webbing.  The resulting George of the Jungle like crash landings, get old fast.  Peter's head gets so messed up, that he sees a psychiatrist, who screws him up even more.  Peter tosses his costume into the trash, quits being Spider-Man, and returns to a `normal' life, looking like Harry Potter.  Peter is blasted out of complacency, when Doc Ock kidnaps MJ.The special effects are stunning, as Spidey returns to battle Doc Ock on a train.  Unfortunately the ending of this thrilling sequence, is marred by pure idiocy, as Spider-Man makes like Fred Flintstone, trying to stop the train using his feet.  Spidey winds up without his mask, this time before a trainload of witnesses.  Doc Ock is relentless, and delivers an unconscious Spider-Man to Harry Osborn in return for the tritium he needs for his experiments.  Doc Ock didn't bother to unmask Spidey, but Harry does, becoming perhaps the 100th person, to discover Peter's `secret' identity.The film's final battle is visually impressive, and quite brutal, but still somehow kind of hollow and contrived, as Doc Ock regains his senses, and decides to try and redeem himself, by `drowning' the fusion reaction, and sadly himself as well.  Doc joins The Goblin in supervillain heaven, after becoming the 101st, to discover that Peter is Spider-Man.  MJ follows as the 102nd, and the crisis ends on a romantic, but bittersweet note.  Harry receives a visit from his dead father, while in a very uncool move, Mary Jane mimics The Graduate, setting the stage for Spider-Man 3.Spider-Man 2 is the best of the three films produced so far.  The central story involving Doc Ock is strong, an effort is made to devote some quality time to Aunt May, and a few moments are spent with JJ Jameson, and the Daily Bugle gang.  The MJ/Peter relationship remains pretty awkward, and sometimes silly, but is still an improvement over the first film.  Kirsten Dunst shines, when put in a dangerous situation.It seems that Sam Raimi can't resist unmasking Spider-Man.  Perhaps he believes that providing proof that Maguire is really inside the costume, results in the audience identifying more with the character, but it is just so overdone.  Spider-Man 2 nicely builds momentum, and moves forward strongly.  It loses focus at times and gets off on a few silly tangents, some related to trying appeal to a youthful audience.  The resolution may not be entirely satisfying, and but the overall ride is quite exciting and fun.",4,"a big improvement, but can't this guy keep his mask on?",1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,4460,"['Sam', 'Raimi', 'Spider-Man', '2002', 'was', 'uneven', 'somewhat', 'unsteady', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'intrepid', 'webhead', 'preliminaries', 'way', 'Spider-Man', '2', '2004', 'bit', 'scattered', 'places', 'still', 'more', 'streamlined', 'focused', 'effort', 'solidly', 'action', 'drama', 'excitement', 'Technical', 'advances', 'special', 'effects', 'tighter', 'screenplay', 'contribute', 'impressiveness', 'film.Alfred', 'Molina', 'cast', 'Dr.', 'Otto', 'Octavius', 'character', 'almost', 'perfectly', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'keep', 'shirt', 'made', 'look', 'slimmer', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'Octavius', 'wife', 'Rosalie', 'brief', 'key', 'role', 'demonstrating', 'Otto', 'really', 'lovable', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'delusional', 'when', 'mind', 'taken', 'over', 'mechanical', 'arms.The', 'sequel', 'up', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'college', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'struggling', 'keep', 'steady', 'job', 'pay', 'rent', 'maintain', 'grades', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'moved', 'involved', 'astronaut', 'John', 'Jameson', 'Daniel', 'Gillies', 'son', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'James', 'Franco', 'assumed', 'significant', 'role', 'Oscorp', 'backing', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'fusion', 'experiment', 'When', 'accident', 'test', 'Rosalie', 'killed', 'set', 'smart', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'becomes', 'fused', 'Octavius', 'body', 'arms', 'take', 'mind', 'disposing', 'surgical', 'team', 'Octavius', 'finance', 'fusion', 'experiments', 'turning', 'crime', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'Spidey', 'tangle', 'first', 'time', 'spectacular', 'battle', 'bank', 'up', 'side', 'building', 'very', 'plucky', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'middle', 'fray.The', 'subtext', 'film', 'Peter', 'inner', 'conflict', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'apparently', 'keeping', 'finding', 'happiness', 'conflict', 'physically', 'when', 'Peter', 'becomes', 'nearsighted', 'occasionally', 'ability', 'generate', 'webbing', 'resulting', 'George', 'Jungle', 'crash', 'landings', 'get', 'old', 'fast', 'Peter', 'head', 'so', 'messed', 'up', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'screws', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'Peter', 'costume', 'trash', 'being', 'Spider-Man', 'returns', 'normal', 'life', 'looking', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Peter', 'blasted', 'complacency', 'when', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'kidnaps', 'MJ.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'Spidey', 'battle', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'train', 'Unfortunately', 'ending', 'thrilling', 'sequence', 'marred', 'pure', 'idiocy', 'Spider-Man', 'Fred', 'Flintstone', 'trying', 'stop', 'train', 'using', 'feet', 'Spidey', 'up', 'mask', 'time', 'trainload', 'witnesses', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'relentless', 'delivers', 'unconscious', 'Spider-Man', 'Harry', 'Osborn', 'return', 'tritium', 'experiments', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'unmask', 'Spidey', 'Harry', 'becoming', 'perhaps', '100th', 'person', 'discover', 'Peter', 'secret', 'identity.The', 'film', 'final', 'battle', 'visually', 'impressive', 'quite', 'brutal', 'still', 'somehow', 'kind', 'hollow', 'contrived', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'senses', 'decides', 'try', 'redeem', 'drowning', 'fusion', 'reaction', 'sadly', 'as', 'well', 'Doc', 'Goblin', 'supervillain', 'heaven', 'becoming', '101st', 'discover', 'Peter', 'Spider-Man', 'MJ', '102nd', 'crisis', 'romantic', 'bittersweet', 'note', 'Harry', 'visit', 'dead', 'father', 'very', 'uncool', 'move', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'mimics', 'Graduate', 'setting', 'stage', 'Spider-Man', '3.Spider-Man', '2', 'best', 'three', 'films', 'produced', 'so', 'far', 'central', 'story', 'involving', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'strong', 'effort', 'made', 'devote', 'quality', 'time', 'Aunt', 'May', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'spent', 'JJ', 'Jameson', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'gang', 'MJ/Peter', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'awkward', 'sometimes', 'silly', 'still', 'improvement', 'first', 'film', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'shines', 'when', 'put', 'dangerous', 'situation.It', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'unmasking', 'Spider-Man', 'Perhaps', 'providing', 'proof', 'Maguire', 'really', 'costume', 'results', 'audience', 'identifying', 'more', 'character', 'just', 'so', 'overdone', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'nicely', 'builds', 'momentum', 'forward', 'strongly', 'focus', 'times', 'off', 'few', 'silly', 'tangents', 'related', 'trying', 'appeal', 'youthful', 'audience', 'resolution', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'ride', 'quite', 'exciting', 'fun']",Spider-Man 2
621468,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMQW,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","This is probably the best superhero movie perhaps this side of 'Superman,' and if you don't like this kind of film, you must see it.  Not because of its special effects; they are superb as expected, but that is not the point.  You should see it simply because it skillfully presents the credible characters with deep emotions, and the film is not afraid of stopping a while to show how a superhero can be a real human, and a villain can too.The carefully written script (by Alvin Sargent, 'Julia') picks up the story of the original after two years.  Peter Parker is still a struggling photographer while Mary Jane is about to have a commercial break as stage actress.  Peter is still in love with her, but because of the incessant crimes of the city, he again broke the promise he made with her.Then Peter is invited to a room of genius scientist Doctor Otto Octavius (by pefectly cast Alfred Molina).  Doc's new experiment, supported Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (James Franco, reprising the role), is going to be held in the city, and Peter is allowed to witness it, and its awful failure, which turns Doctor into a villain with robotic tentacles.Written on paper, the story looks as silly as any other recent films you name, but the results are just brilliant.  The story is always interesting, being unpredictable at times, with slight amount of humor and lots of first-rate special effects.  In the middle of the speedy action scenes, director Sam Raimi shows his sense of humor, which is both surprising and hilarious.  (My favorite: Spider-man using elevator.)  And see Doc in labo, making a havoc there, which is shot with his trademark camera work that made him famous in 'Evil Dead'.'Spider-Man 2' is probably better than the first one, in making more convincing characters and presenting well-balanced storytelling.  Of course its great CGIs are not to be missed, but more amazing thins is that these CGIs really support the main feature of the film -- the characters we truly care.

621469,A2G8IR6ENZSQHF,B00005JMQW,"T. Tiraterra ""Fluffy""","[0, 1]","I'm going to risk getting a bunch of ""Unhelpful"" votes now by saying this- ""Spider-Man 2"" is slightly overrated.  This is an entertaining and sometimes moving film, but it's not without its flaws.  Those who are saying this is the best comic book film ever have likely not seen many comic book films.  I found ""Spider-Man 2"" to be somewhat below such films as ""Supermans I and II"" (In fact, this film borrows some themes from ""Superman II""), ""Hulk"" (for those who haven't read my previous reviews, I was one of the few that loved that film), and even the second ""X-Men"" film.  However, this is still a very good movie, and it will probably end up in my year's Top 10 list (out of the 50 or so films I see a year).Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to be an appealing couple.  Really, there couldn't be a better Spider-Man than Maguire.  My personal favorite of the acting jobs is JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who gives the film all of its funniest momemts.  I honestly believe he should be up for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Another stand-out is Alfred Molina, who makes Dr. Octopus equally sympathetic and dangerous.  The sole sore here is James Franco as Harry Osbourne.  I sensed that we were supposed to sympathize with him as well, but from the beginning of the film he's too angry and hateful.The action in ""Spider-Man 2"" is almost spectacular.  In this area, ""Spider-Man 2"" improves on the first one in almost every way.  My only complaint is that there's not enough of it.  The film feels about 20 minutes too long, and I honestly think that it could have done with fewer of Peter Parker's ""agonizing over what to do"" moments.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did need some of these scenes.  There are just too many of them, and things occasionally bog down.  However, the film corrects itself at the climax, which works both on an action-filled and an emotional level.

621470,A17SSD0G2GD7CK,B00005JMQW,"T Uttley ""T Uttley""","[3, 3]","Sam Raimi has by far exceeded himself with this breathtaking sequel, making it almost hard to believe that he was the wonder behind the entertaining yet stupefied ?Evil Dead?. Spiderman 2 makes all the other of today?s comic-strip film phenomena?s (Hulk, X-men etc) look poignant.  I mean tell me what careless buffoon would release ?Thunderbirds? at the same time? Of course unless their every intention was to make Spidey look inconceivable suprafragilistically the ultimate blockbuster of summer 2004?or maybe ever!!The sequel certainly leans to a more humorous script than the original, but I am not afraid to say it works, it works, it works. I cannot stand the cheesy song ?Raindrops keep falling on my head? and I hate its connotations with ?Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. So why on earth did I feel fantastically happy and warm inside when Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is walking to college in his geeky outfit to the same song I now find charmingly invigorating?  I guess sometimes a film can kill a song and a different film can rejuvenate it! ? oh the circle of life!Spiderman still finds it hard to convince his fellow citizens that he is a good guy and not the menace the Daily Bugle portrays (no thanks to the feeble editor fantastically played by J.K. Simmons).  Peter in turn has stopped handing in snapshots of Spiderman to the newspaper because Spiderman refuses due to a damaging reputation, which means Peter?s photography looks to be on the verge of failure. Luckily he is fired then unfired to help out at an engagement bash. Along with the struggles of Spiderman and photography, poor Peter has to balance a part-time pizza-delivery job with his college studies. Not to mention his perplexed undeniable love for MJ (Kirsten Dunst).  Peter rendering into organised schizophrenia on the outside is suffering on the inner, and so it is not surprising that Spiderman is losing his powers. As the doctor puts it ? ?Maybe Spiderman isn?t supposed to climb those walls.?The bad guy? Okay, some crazy scientist called Dr Octavius (played by our very own Alfred Molina) trying to create nuclear fusion in the palm of his hand. Obviously as usual ?his success in failure becomes his failure to admit defeat?, which in my opinion gives the character someone we can all share empathy. Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) depicts beautifully ?sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.? Rather than Spiderman using his special powers to save the world he remembers the powerful words of Aunt May to make Dr Octavius see sense.Mr Maguire and Miss Dunst are both undeniably terrific in the film, Stan Lee and of course Steve Ditko (lets not get in a legal feud) could not have wished for better actors to play their beloved caricatures. In a very childish way I share the love for them so much as well.  In fact, I am already having withdrawal symptoms from my absence watching Spiderman and my viewing was only half-an-hour ago! Hurry up Spiderman 3!!P.S.  Not that I complained much in the original Spiderman ? but I swear the special effects are much better this time! Spiderman does looks more realistic ? those who disagree ? please buy yourself an imagination!",5,Here Spidey Spidey!,1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,3216,"['Sam', 'Raimi', 'far', 'exceeded', 'breathtaking', 'sequel', 'making', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'wonder', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'stupefied', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Spiderman', '2', 'other', 'today', 's', 'comic-strip', 'film', 'phenomena', 's', 'Hulk', 'X-men', 'etc', 'look', 'poignant', 'mean', 'tell', 'what', 'careless', 'buffoon', 'would', 'release', 'Thunderbirds', 'same', 'time', 'course', 'intention', 'was', 'make', 'Spidey', 'look', 'inconceivable', 'suprafragilistically', 'ultimate', 'blockbuster', 'summer', '2004', 'maybe', 'ever', 'sequel', 'certainly', 'more', 'humorous', 'script', 'original', 'am', 'not', 'afraid', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'cheesy', 'song', 'Raindrops', 'keep', 'falling', 'head', 'hate', 'connotations', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'So', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'feel', 'fantastically', 'happy', 'warm', 'inside', 'when', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'walking', 'college', 'geeky', 'outfit', 'same', 'song', 'now', 'find', 'charmingly', 'invigorating', 'guess', 'sometimes', 'film', 'can', 'kill', 'song', 'different', 'film', 'can', 'rejuvenate', 'circle', 'life', 'Spiderman', 'still', 'hard', 'convince', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'good', 'guy', 'not', 'menace', 'Daily', 'Bugle', 'portrays', 'thanks', 'feeble', 'editor', 'fantastically', 'played', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Peter', 'turn', 'stopped', 'handing', 'snapshots', 'Spiderman', 'newspaper', 'Spiderman', 'due', 'damaging', 'reputation', 'Peter', 's', 'photography', 'be', 'verge', 'failure', 'Luckily', 'fired', 'then', 'unfired', 'help', 'out', 'engagement', 'bash', 'struggles', 'Spiderman', 'photography', 'poor', 'Peter', 'balance', 'part-time', 'pizza-delivery', 'job', 'college', 'studies', 'Not', 'mention', 'perplexed', 'undeniable', 'love', 'MJ', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Peter', 'rendering', 'organised', 'schizophrenia', 'outside', 'suffering', 'inner', 'not', 'surprising', 'Spiderman', 'losing', 'powers', 'doctor', 'Maybe', 'Spiderman', 'isn', 't', 'supposed', 'climb', 'walls', 'bad', 'guy', 'Okay', 'crazy', 'scientist', 'called', 'Dr', 'Octavius', 'played', 'very', 'own', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'trying', 'create', 'nuclear', 'fusion', 'palm', 'hand', 'Obviously', 'usual', 'success', 'failure', 'failure', 'admit', 'defeat', 'opinion', 'character', 'someone', 'can', 'share', 'empathy', 'Aunt', 'May', 'Rosemary', 'Harris', 'beautifully', 'sometimes', 'have', 'be', 'steady', 'give', 'up', 'thing', 'want', 'most', 'Even', 'dreams.', 'Rather', 'Spiderman', 'using', 'special', 'powers', 'save', 'world', 'powerful', 'words', 'Aunt', 'May', 'make', 'Dr', 'Octavius', 'see', 'sense.Mr', 'Maguire', 'Miss', 'Dunst', 'are', 'undeniably', 'terrific', 'film', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'course', 'Steve', 'Ditko', 'not', 'get', 'legal', 'feud', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'wished', 'better', 'actors', 'play', 'beloved', 'caricatures', 'very', 'childish', 'way', 'share', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'well', 'fact', 'am', 'already', 'having', 'withdrawal', 'symptoms', 'absence', 'watching', 'Spiderman', 'viewing', 'was', 'only', 'half-an-hour', 'ago', 'Hurry', 'Spiderman', '3', 'P.S', 'Not', 'complained', 'much', 'original', 'Spiderman', 'swear', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'time', 'Spiderman', 'more', 'realistic', 'who', 'disagree', 'please', 'buy', 'imagination']",Spider-Man 2
621471,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JMQW,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","I was really looking forward to seeing SPIDER-MAN 2. SPIDER MAN was one of the best comic book movies ever made and with almost all of the original cast returning, being helmed once again by the brilliant Sam Raimi, and having the enigmatic and paradoxical Dr. Ock as the main villain, SPIDER-MAN 2 was a movie I definitely wanted to see.The movie leaves off two years after SPIDER-MAN ended. Peter Parker is still struggling his way through school while fighting crime at night as Spider-Man. He's living in a run down apartment and keeps losing his jobs because he gets distracted by citizens in distress. His grades are dropping at school and he looks more worn out than parents with a newborn. Peter's best friend from high school, Harry Osborne is doing well and has taken control of OsCorp and turned it around into a competitive profit making business once again. Harry and Peter still have problems in their relationship because Peter refuses to tell Harry what he knows about Spider-Man. As for Mary Jane, she's enjoying the fruits of her labors and is performing in a successful professional theatre. Haunted by the death of Uncle Ben, Peter's inner life is full of conflict and struggle. Things get even more complicated when the famous Dr. Octavius, a man who Peter admires and respects, is transferred into the sinister villain, Doc Ock after a freak accident at OsCorp. What's a guy with amazing powers supposed to do?As a sequel, SPIDER-MAN 2 is better than most. It successfully continues the story from the original film without leaving audience members who haven't seen the first movie in the dark. The special effects blend seamlessly into the film. There's a great plot and the Doc Ock is perhaps even more complex and enigmatic than the Green Goblin. The acting is superb (especially considering this is a comic book action film) bringing more depth and life into the characters we met in the first movie. And the direction, well what else is there to say except ""Sam Raimi is the man."" (I especially liked his homage to the Evil Dead movies).However, I was somewhat disappointed by the movie. There aren't as many fights between the hero and villain. Then there are the moments that are pure cheese (e.g. the scene where ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" is played). It also was apparent that the producers (I won't blame Raimi, because he's too good of a director to purposely do this without some prodding from someone else and I also know that he might not direct the next film) just wanted the movie to blatantly set up the next sequel and begin building the franchise. The first film stood completely on it's on. SPIDER-MAN 2 stands on its own until the last fifteen minutes of the movie. Then it becomes nothing more than one long trailer for SPIDER-MAN 3. This was a drag and severely disappointing, especially in a movie that for the most part, was done so well. It glares like a smudge of coal on a wedding dress and is the one thing that keeps the movie from being the perfect sequel. But don't let that stop you from watching it, because the movie is worth watching. Just ignore the glare at the end.",4,The Story Continues,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,3135,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'SPIDER', 'MAN', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'almost', 'original', 'cast', 'returning', 'being', 'helmed', 'once', 'again', 'brilliant', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'having', 'enigmatic', 'paradoxical', 'Dr.', 'Ock', 'main', 'villain', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'was', 'movie', 'definitely', 'wanted', 'see.The', 'movie', 'off', 'two', 'years', 'SPIDER-MAN', 'ended', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'still', 'struggling', 'way', 'school', 'fighting', 'crime', 'night', 'Spider-Man', 'living', 'run', 'down', 'apartment', 'losing', 'jobs', 'distracted', 'citizens', 'distress', 'grades', 'are', 'dropping', 'school', 'more', 'worn', 'parents', 'newborn', 'Peter', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'Harry', 'Osborne', 'doing', 'well', 'taken', 'control', 'OsCorp', 'turned', 'around', 'competitive', 'profit', 'making', 'business', 'once', 'again', 'Harry', 'Peter', 'still', 'have', 'problems', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'tell', 'Harry', 'what', 'Spider-Man', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'enjoying', 'fruits', 'labors', 'performing', 'successful', 'professional', 'theatre', 'Haunted', 'death', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'Peter', 'inner', 'life', 'full', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'famous', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'man', 'who', 'Peter', 'admires', 'respects', 'transferred', 'sinister', 'villain', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'freak', 'accident', 'OsCorp', 'What', 'guy', 'amazing', 'powers', 'supposed', 'do', 'sequel', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'better', 'most', 'successfully', 'story', 'original', 'film', 'leaving', 'audience', 'members', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'dark', 'special', 'effects', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'film', 'great', 'plot', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'enigmatic', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'considering', 'comic', 'book', 'action', 'film', 'bringing', 'more', 'depth', 'life', 'characters', 'met', 'first', 'movie', 'direction', 'well', 'what', 'else', 'there', 'say', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'man', 'especially', 'liked', 'homage', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movies', '.However', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'fights', 'hero', 'villain', 'Then', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'pure', 'cheese', 'e.g', 'scene', 'where', 'Raindrops', 'Keep', 'Falling', 'My', 'Head', 'played', 'also', 'was', 'apparent', 'producers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Raimi', 'too', 'good', 'director', 'purposely', 'do', 'prodding', 'someone', 'else', 'also', 'know', 'might', 'not', 'direct', 'next', 'film', 'just', 'wanted', 'movie', 'blatantly', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'sequel', 'begin', 'building', 'franchise', 'first', 'film', 'stood', 'completely', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'stands', 'own', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Then', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'long', 'trailer', 'SPIDER-MAN', '3', 'was', 'drag', 'severely', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'smudge', 'coal', 'wedding', 'dress', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'being', 'perfect', 'sequel', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'watching', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Just', 'glare', 'end']",Spider-Man 2

If you're sick of these bubblegum flicks, you're probably not going to read a review on it anyway. But, if I can stop just one soul from wasting 2 hours of their life and killing some more brain cells, this review will be worth it. To start off, remember that this is Howard Stern's favorite movie franchise.More one dimensional acting from Tobey Maguire. More horrible acting from Kirsten Dunst (her last name is so apropos). And some dreadful scenery chewing by James Franco. Be careful, that set's not dipped in chocolate, you know. What really boggles my mind are the reviews that praise the actors in this. There's some really shoddy CGI here, too. No question about it, the CGI in the first SPIDERMAN was better. The story had me yawning and yelling, ""C'mon,"" at the television. Wait a minute? What story? You know, the generic superhero story where the girl is in peril and the hero saves her at the last... blah, blah, blah. Why tell an original story when you have SPIDERMAN and CGI to pull in the crowds. Can an action flick be boring? This one is so boring, I was staring at the walls of my living room watching a real spider that was spinning a web. You also get some crummy ""B"" movie special effects at the conclusion. What the heck did they spend all that money on? Probably marketing and advertising. Even Alfred Molina couldn't save this dog of an action flick. The only reason I rented this is because Molina is such a great actor (and the first movie was somewhat decent). But, if you're looking for acting, avoid this like the plague. This is COMMERCIAL HOLLYWOOD FRANCHISE PRODUCT ENTERTAINMENT at it's worst. Save your money and buy a ""happy face"" t-shirt instead. SPIDERMAN 2 is mindless eye candy for the masses.IT'S OFFICIAL: Ebert and Roper have lost their minds. This is a bad ""movie."" It is not a ""film.""

It just shows to go ya, the critics are bombarded with so much garbage, they can't even spot bad filmmaking anymore. Shame on you. I think I'll get my reviews from Henry Rollins on IFC from now on.What happened to the Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi I used to know and love? He SOLD OUT to the HOLLYWOOD MONEY MACHINE. Shame on you.When are they gonna come out with the HOGAN'S HEROES movie franchise? I want my MTV...

Unlike many big budget, special-effects-dense movies the characters are not a backdrop to the effects. The characters will be the reason that people will stand in long lines to see this movie. If you ever read the Spider-Man comic book series you would know that Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker is a perfect fit and powerful. Kristen Dunst is the real Mary Jane and somehow I feel she is even better than the character developed in the comic book series.When I see a movie I want to remember the characters and identify with them. If you identify with the characters then you identify with the plot. That is the main ingredient in making a movie successful and destined for glory.

This new Extended Cut adds little to the original movie but for fanboys like me, its awesome. The second disc has a featurette on the new scenes and one on winning the Oscar for Best Visual Efects and some other docs on the amazing visual effects and theres also a behind the scenes look at Spidey 3 and some trailers.

621480,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JMQW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 7]","Taking issue #50 of ""Spider-Man"" as its starting point, Peter Parker decides he needs to get a life outside of Spider-Man. Parker discovers that crime never pays for the hero (or at least his overdue rent). Since he doesn't have time to do his college homework, is failing classes and no has relationship with MJ because of his alter-ego, Parker decides to give up the Spidey suit. When his powers begin failing him because of his indecision, it's the final web for Parker. Parker has lousy timing, though, as just as all this is occurring as Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina in a marevlously nuanced performance)one of Peter's idols goes mad and becomes a supervillain causing havoc. J. K. Simmons is hillarious as J. Jonah Jameson capturing just the right element of tabloid journalism (and the scenes at The Daily Bugle plays like a miniature screwball comedy that could well have been made in the 40's)that drives Jameson to make Spidey a villain. The rest of the cast from Maguire, Dunst, Franco all the way down to Rosemary Harris as Aunt May capture elements of what made the comic characters so compelling.With a witty script written by Alvin Sargent (""What About Bob?"", ""Julia"", ""Straight Time"" and ""Unfaithful"" among many other scripts)and with contributions by other notable writers (Michael Chabon Pultizer Prize author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay), ""Spider-Man"" soars precisely because of the issues that Parker faces. Sam Raimi's sure handed direction and visual effects that rank among the best  (although sometimes the CGI Spider-Man looks exactly like, well, a CGI representation of Spider-Man)keeps ""Spidey-2"" from being earthbound. ""Spider-Man 2"" visits familiar territory for super hero films (already visited by ""Superman 2"")but has enough originality to stamp the story with its own stamp. Is it better than the original? You'll have to decide for yourself as the first film was exceptional but ""Spider-Man 2"" at least measures up precisely because it's more character driven.Comparing the different versions of ""Spider-Man 2"" is a challenge (there's three out there in the US). The best looking of the bunch is the Superbit edition in which all the extras are shaved off with all the extra disc space devoted strictly to the high definition transfer of picture and sound. Not surprisingly, this edition looks and sounds the best with a crisper picture, sharper images and top notch sound that sounds only slighly better than the 2 disc convention set. The catch is that the Superbit Edition has no extras and is a single disc. You'd also have to have a top-of-the-line system to really, really appreciate the differences (although on a big screen TV you'll see some of them readily apparent). If the person you're buying this for is into the best looking and sounding digital audio and video, this is probably the edition to get.The 2 disc set looks pretty darn good with a high definition transfer that looks and sounds almost as good as the Superbit Edition. We also get ""Spider-Facts"" which is, essentially, a text only commentary track. While it occasionally has some interesting tidits about the film (and many outside of the film such as tidbits about New York City), it's dispensable. There's also a blooper reel which is amusing included on the first disc as well as previews/trailers for various films.The second disc (which could easily have been included in a deluxe 3 disc Superbit Edition set for videophiles)includes a stunning 12 part documentary that discusses the production of the movie from pre-production to the premiere. It's exhaustive and fascinating to watch all on its own as a documentary. ""Ock-Umentary: Eight Arms to Hold You"" (a rather witty reference to The Beatles' film ""Help!"") is also a very good documentary on the history of Doc Ock from his first appearence in Spider-Man # 3 to the 60's cartoons to how they adapted the character for the film.There's also a number of very good featurettes including a discussion of the women in Spidey's life (which is only appropriate as two women dominate his life and influence most of his personal decisions),""Enter the Web"" uses multi-angle technology to give a glimpse behind-the-scenes of the shooting of the climax of the movie. There's also an art gallery of Alex Ross' paintings from the title sequence (which is used as a brilliant device to sum up the first film for viewers who missed it and reminding everyone of what happened). We don't get any worthwhile games (that's a definite negative for gamers who want to try ""Spider-Man 2: The Game"") but get a featurette on the making of the game. There's also the usual weblinks. Oh and if you click on one of Doc Ock's tentacles you'll find an Easter Egg showing a very funny practical joke director Sam Raimi played on actor Alfred Molina.The commentary tracks feature director Raimi, Maguire and the producers and there's also a separate Technical Commentary featuring effects supervisor John Dykstra and others discussing how they achieved the look of the film. For those folks who purchased this at Best-Buy early enough got an extra disc that had the VH-1 Special on the production of the movie. It's OK and more promo piece fluff than behind-the-scenes documentary.The boxed comes with the conventional two disc set (without the Best Buy disc which is a bit curious as it would have been a nice addition) plus a comic collector's dream team of 25 artists with paintings inspired by the film. There's a portfolio that allows you to view various scenes from conception to final product (which would have been put to better use on a multi-angle DVD for videophiles). Taking an idea from the re-release of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" (a Raimi favorite), there's five postcard sized reproductions of the artwork used to publicize the film including the trio of promo posters that were plastered all over cities. Finally, there's a reproduction (reduced to fit in the set)of The Amazing Spider-Man # 50 issue that inspired much of the story. They probably also should have included The Amazing Spider-Man #3 where Doc Ock first appeared as well, but that's a pretty minor point.All in all,the last set makes the better Christmas or birthday gift for fans. Regardless, the film is the same just differing in presentation. ""Spider-Man 2"" has a number of detractors that don't care for it. They probably shouldn't buy the film or rent it. For the rest of us who liked it, this is an intelligent, fun film thats only major flaws is that it runs about 15 minutes too long.",5,Fighting crime doesn't pay the rent,1102204800,"12 5,

621481,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B00005JMQW,Wesley Mullins,"[0, 0]","Spider-Man 2 finds Peter Parker dealing with the harsh realities of being a superhero. His grades are slipping, he can't keep a job and his relationship with Mary Jane is non-existent. How is he to be a normal person when he must spend his nights slinging through the city after New York's villains?With this set-up, Spider-Man 2 attempts to break the mold of the superhero genre. Yes, there is a sub-plot dealing with the multi-armed Dr. Ock, but the thrust of the story deals with the inner-conflicts of Peter Parker. Will he abandon his crime-fighting ways and become a better student, nephew, employee and boyfriend? This film actually builds character development and gives the audience a Peter Parker that everyone will want to pull for.But the film does not abandon it's comic book roots. The eye-candy fight scenes are enhanced by unbelievable technological advancements made since the first Spider-Man. The incredible creation of Dr. Ock works as the special effects' greatest invention. His mechanical arms work with him in such a realistic way that many moviegoers will swear actor Alfred Molina really had those things fused to his spine and wired to his cerebellum.So much of the success of these films should be placed directly on the shoulders of its star, Tobey Maguire. Many questioned his original casting as the webslinger. While his past works have not exactly made him a surefire choice to play a superhero, his depiction of sensitive, lonely characters in his previous works (Pleasantville, Cider House) made him the perfect choice for Peter Parker. He is why Spider-Man 2 is able to revolutionize superhero films by allowing them to be about more than just special effects.",5,Blockbuster filmmaking at its best,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,1696,"['Spider-Man', '2', 'finds', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'dealing', 'harsh', 'realities', 'being', 'superhero', 'grades', 'are', 'slipping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'job', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'non-existent', 'How', 'be', 'normal', 'person', 'when', 'must', 'spend', 'nights', 'slinging', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'villains', 'set-up', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'attempts', 'break', 'mold', 'superhero', 'genre', 'Yes', 'sub-plot', 'dealing', 'multi-armed', 'Dr.', 'Ock', 'thrust', 'story', 'deals', 'inner-conflicts', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'Will', 'abandon', 'crime-fighting', 'ways', 'become', 'better', 'student', 'nephew', 'employee', 'boyfriend', 'film', 'actually', 'character', 'development', 'audience', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'everyone', 'will', 'want', 'pull', 'for.But', 'film', 'not', 'abandon', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'eye-candy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'enhanced', 'unbelievable', 'technological', 'advancements', 'made', 'first', 'Spider-Man', 'incredible', 'creation', 'Dr.', 'Ock', 'special', 'effects', 'greatest', 'invention', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'work', 'realistic', 'way', 'many', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'swear', 'actor', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'really', 'had', 'things', 'fused', 'spine', 'wired', 'cerebellum.So', 'much', 'success', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'directly', 'shoulders', 'star', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Many', 'questioned', 'original', 'casting', 'webslinger', 'past', 'works', 'have', 'not', 'exactly', 'made', 'surefire', 'choice', 'play', 'superhero', 'depiction', 'sensitive', 'lonely', 'characters', 'previous', 'works', 'Pleasantville', 'Cider', 'House', 'made', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'why', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'able', 'revolutionize', 'superhero', 'films', 'allowing', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'special', 'effects']",Spider-Man 2
621482,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00005JMQW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[24, 27]","While the first installment of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise was certainly a noble beginning, this sequel somehow manages to improve upon it in a big way.  The first movie accomplished the task of getting Spider Man's origins out of the way and setting up the important characters, and ""Spider-Man 2"" picks up right where the original left off, hitting the ground running as it further examines the struggles of Peter Parker.  As you may remember, Peter can't tell the woman he loves who he is, his best friend wants to kill him and doesn't even know it, and he's having a bit of trouble finding steady work.  While that may not seem like an auspicious beginning, things still proceed to go downhill pretty fast.Much like its predecessor, ""Spider Man 2"" presents Peter Parker as the most human of superheroes, struggling to reconcile the responsibility that accompanies his powers with his desire for a normal life.  This guy didn't ask to have superhuman powers, and as we see in this movie, there are times that he'd much rather not be one.  After all, when you like a woman who looks like Kirsten Dunst, and you have lots of evidence that the feeling is mutual, it can be hard to get out there and perform the thankless task of fighting crime.  In all seriousness, though, the moral conflict that Spidey faces forms the heart of the movie.  With a level of emotional depth and a lack of heavy-handedness rarely seen in big-budget blockbusters, this movie brilliantly depicts the tension our protagonist feels as he tries to decide whether he wants to be Peter Parker, mild-mannered student, or Spider-Man, daring superhero.Since it ups the ante from the original in virtually every other aspect, it only makes sense that ""Spider-Man 2"" would represent an improvement in the bad guy department, and it doesn't disappoint.  While the villain is once again a brilliant scientist victimized by an experiment gone horribly wrong, Willem Dafoe's cartoonish Green Goblin has been replaced by the fearsomely tentacled Dr. Octopus, portrayed with the requisite gravity by a glowering Alfred Molina.  The Spider-Man series has demonstrated a knack for crafting nemeses as vividly human as its hero, and as with the Green Goblin, we get to see the conflicts played out in Dr. Octopus's head as he decides to complete his fusion experiment no matter the cost.  Perhaps more importatntly, Dr. Octupus's tentacles are a marvel of modern special effects, swinging wildly and with a mind of their own, smashing through concrete, effortlessly tossing whatever they can grab, and dispatching a room full of doctors in one harrowing early scene.This brings me to perhaps the most attractive aspect of this movie: it actually features believable, fleshed-out characters.  The ""X-Men"" franchise has done an admirable job in this regard as well, but the ""Spider-Man"" movies still take the prize thanks to unusually intelligent dialogue and acting that communicates the movie's key themes while keeping the melodrama to a minimum.  Maguire's everyman appeal as Peter is undeniable; Dunst's smart, sensible Mary Jane is one of the only female leads around who actually bring something to the table besides good looks; and James Franco is turning the tortured soul Harry Osborn into a tragic hero of near-Shakespearean proportions.Anyway, with Dr. Octopus predictably set on a mad quest to finish his project, and Peter the only guy who can stop him, the stage is set for some truly unbelievable combat scenes, surely among the best to be seen in a mainstream movie in recent years.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and character development and all that nice stuff, you can't have a superhero movie without some great action sequences, and this one has plenty of them.  Whether in a bank with bags of money flying around, on the side of a skyscraper with Peter's Aunt May serving as a human shield, or on a speeding train filled with innocent passengers, the two duke it out in frenetic, fast-paced battles that pit webs against tentacles and any other potential weapon that presents itself.  Sam Raimi's apparently one of the only directors in Hollywood these days who can film a tight, tense fight scene without overrelying on CGI effects or cutting every half-second, and we should all be grateful for it.As if all that isn't enough, we're once again treated to the over-the-top antics of J.K. Simmons, who threatens to steal the show even in his limited screen time as the imperious Jonah Jameson.  Mugging furiously, yelling up a storm, and terrorizing those who come near him, Jameson's character is every bit as scary as his flattop haircut and Hitler mustache would suggest.  Someone could make a movie about this guy, and I might put down some cash to see it.  While many big-budget movies try to inject some comic relief into the proceedings, this one is notable in that it actually does it well.Everything comes to a head in the movie's epic climax, with a concluding half-hour full of revelations, emotional drama, and of course lots of action.  In fact, the bittersweet nature of this movie and its conclusion practically position it as the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Spider-Man series.  Given the massive receipts this movie has already brought in, it's inevitable that there will be a ""Spider-Man 3"" coming down the chute eventually, especially with the neat bit of foreshadowing at the end of this installment.  If the next sequel is as smartly written and skillfully filmed as this one was, it can't come soon enough.",4,"Well, I'm a believer now",1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,5516,"['first', 'installment',

621483,A1BS8YM712C0VJ,B00005JMQW,Will Culp,"[0, 2]","Spider-Man 2(2004). The Second Movie In the Spider-Man Movies.After the magnificent Spider-Man, which became the 5th HighestGrossing Movie of All-Time(Recently Knocked to #6 by Shrek 2 though), a sequel was undoubtedly coming soon, and in June of 2004, Spider-Man 2 finally arrived in theaters. Critics were in a frenzy, giving Spider-Man 2 5 Stars left and right, and it was praised as ""being better than the first"" by almost everybody, and the hype was high upon its release. Much Like Spider-Man, when Spider-Man 2 hit theaters, it hit theaters with avengeance, and in the first 6 days, it grossed over 180 MillionDollars, beating the Matrix Reloaded's Weeklong Record of 150 Million. So, with all the hype and expectations surrounding Spider-Man 2, how does the movie stand up to it in the end? If you ask me, with Flying Colors. Read on to find out why...Plot- Peter Parker. Better known to the population as Spider-Man, a hero or a menace, depending on who you ask. Peter is challenged daily by his responsibilities, having to choose between Saving The Day or Surviving everyday life, his schedule seriously skewered with his Jobs, School, and Personal life because of his responsibility to defend the citizens of New York. Mary Jane, the love of Parker's life, abandons him after he fails to come to any of her shows, Peter loses his Job, He'sFailing in School, and his Best Friend Harry Osbourne disowns him because of his ties with the ""Bug"", because Harry believes Spider-Man cold-bloodedly killed his father, Norman Osbourne(AKA The Green Goblin). Meanwhile, Otto Octavius, a promising scientist on the brink of a major Fusion Discovery, becomes the City's Menace, accidentaly molding 4 Metal Arms onto his body in a freak accident, and they control him. He then wreaks havoc, robbing banks, hurting, and killing people, and Spider-Man is the only one who can stop him. Meanwhile, Peter Parker decides to abandon his life as Spider-Man, meaning to focus on his personal life instead, yet he begins to change his mind after the growing problems, especially after Mary Jane is kidnapped by Doc Ock(Otto Octavius). Spider-Man and Doc Ock's showdown could mean the fate of 8 Million people, including Mary Jane, so he faces off in a battle of the Ages.Opinions-First off, the first thing you notice about the story is how it picks right up where it left off, so if you didn't see the first Spider-Man, you might be in the dust, so go rent it if you're planning to see Spider-Man 2. S-M 2 isn't just a continuation of the original, it's a whole new story, showcasing Peter Parker's personal problems, and how his Personal Life and Responsibility clash. The love story here is not as obvious as in Spider-Man, yet in the end, Parker must risk his life for Mary Jane, and their love brings them together in the end. I found that the Special Effects were very well-done, with Doc Ock's metal arms, The Clocktower fight, The Train Sequence, and the Final Climatic Fight showcasing the Special Effects beautifully! Everybody's acting is top-notch, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and especially Sam Raimi's performance really standing out, and I expect them to be doing excellent things in the future. As for Spider Man 2 being better than the first, I must disagree. Why you ask? Mainly because I think the whole plotline of Peter Parker discovering his new powers and the responsibility that comes with it, and the resulting consequences to be a very intricate plot that edges out Spider Man 2 slightly.Nonetheless, Spider Man 2, a tale of Love, Hate, Friendship, and Betrayal, stands as a Cinematic Milestone, An Action Plot with a Great Story and Acting, and in the end, a moral we can all live by, With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility, and we can never waver from out duty.Overall, Spider-Man 2 is the perfect movie for the Summer, and the masses of people seeing it show why. I can't wait for the Third, which was even broke open in Spider-Man 2(Harry Osbourne discovers his father's Green Goblin stuff after learning his Best Friend is his Father's Killer). The one thing I ask though is to make Venom, perhaps the greatest villian ever, an integral character in some of the next few movies.

Jonah Jameson is great - volatile, fast talking, and never one to sacrifice a good news story to the facts. Doc Octopus is the comic book villain, with a blubbery look that just adds to his dis-appeal. Peter Parker comes across well, too. He's the mousy little loser by day, with his job, schooling, and love life all falling apart. He's also Spiderman, hero to all but one in the city. That's the unsubtle irony. He's too busy saving other lives to keep his own life from falling apart. Spiderman finally realizes that Peter Parker needs saving, too. That phase of the story begins with a triage decision: Spidey walks away from an apparent mugging, giving Parker back his life at someone else's expense.It's a good story, with some chaste romance (boy has/loses/regains girl), some romantic chases (when MJ is taken hostage), and some teasers for an inevitable sequel. Spiderman was never the Great American Novel and never meant to be. It's just a comic book, with all the good and bad that implies, and this movie captures it perfectly.//wiredweird",4,Spinning a good story,1094169600,"09 3, 2004",2004,1235,"['movie', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'very', 'tough', 'task', 'presenting', 'comic', 'presenting', 'craftsmanship', 'maybe', 'respect', 'exaggerated', 'sense', 'proper', 'genre.J', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'great', 'volatile', 'fast', 'talking', 'never', 'one', 'sacrifice', 'good', 'news', 'story', 'facts', 'Doc', 'Octopus', 'comic', 'book', 'villain', 'blubbery', 'look', 'just', 'dis-appeal', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'across', 'well', 'too', 'mousy', 'little', 'loser', 'day', 'job', 'schooling', 'love', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'also', 'Spiderman', 'hero', 'one', 'city', 'unsubtle', 'irony', 'too', 'busy', 'saving', 'other', 'lives', 'keep', 'own', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'Spiderman', 'finally', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'saving', 'too', 'phase', 'story', 'triage', 'decision', 'Spidey', 'walks', 'away', 'apparent', 'mugging', 'giving', 'Parker', 'back', 'life', 'someone', 'else', 'expense.It', 'good', 'story', 'chaste', 'romance', 'boy', 'has/loses/regains', 'girl', 'romantic', 'chases', 'when', 'MJ', 'taken', 'hostage', 'teasers', 'inevitable', 'sequel', 'Spiderman', 'was', 'never', 'Great', 'American', 'Novel', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'just', 'comic', 'book', 'good', 'bad', 'implies', 'movie', 'perfectly.//wiredweird']",Spider-Man 2

The re-occuring charecters are portrayed by the same actors and actresses in each movie keeping the entertainment value higher than predecessors of other super-hero movies that have changed the casting too much-- distracting away from the believability of the charecters' lives. I must commend the Sony studios and producers for that.However, I'm bothered by this up-coming re-issue of what most Spider-man fans already own (without the extra schene as this new one). Why must fans have to pay more for what they have already paid for? Why couldn't the studio release the ""extended version"" with the first release of the Spider-man 2 movie like other movies and studios have done? Why must they make it so tempting for young people and kids to spend money on something that really isn't worth the extra cost? I'm honestly bothered by this.I enjoy the movie and can't wait to see what the extended version is all about, but it's just a shame the studios feel it neccessary to drain money from Spider-man hungry fans when really they're paying more for what they're getting.",4,Why must we pay for an entire new DVD?,1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,1146,"['Spider-Man', 'series', 'one', 'feel', 'complete', 'intergrity', 're-occuring', 'charecters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'same', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', 'keeping', 'entertainment', 'value', 'higher', 'predecessors', 'other', 'super-hero', 'movies', 'have', 'changed', 'casting', 'too', 'much', 'distracting', 'away', 'believability', 'charecters', 'lives', 'must', 'commend', 'Sony', 'studios', 'producers', 'that.However', ""'m"", 'bothered', 'up-coming', 're-issue', 'what', 'most', 'Spider-man', 'fans', 'already', 'own', 'extra', 'schene', 'new', 'one', 'Why', 'must', 'fans', 'have', 'pay', 'more', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'paid', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'studio', 'release', 'extended', 'version', 'first', 'release', 'Spider-man', '2', 'movie', 'other', 'movies', 'studios', 'have', 'done', 'Why', 'must', 'make', 'so', 'tempting', 'young', 'people', 'kids', 'spend', 'money', 'something', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'extra', 'cost', ""'m"", 'honestly', 'bothered', 'this.I', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'extended', 'version', 'just', 'shame', 'studios', 'feel', 'neccessary', 'drain', 'money', 'Spider-man', 'hungry', 'fans', 'when', 'really', ""'re"", 'paying', 'more', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting']",Spider-Man 2

621489,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00005JMQW,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[18, 20]","SPIDER-MAN 2 is arguably the best comic book action movie ever made. When I saw it in the theaters, I said: ""wow""!!I was already satisfied with the original cut and now with Spider man 3 in the horizon, Marvel is coming out with 2.1. Luckily, I managed to see my friend's  sampler.Forget everything else when you watch this extended cut and it's outstanding. The extra 8 minutes of footage add context, lengthen and deepen some emotional scenes, inject the funniest moment of the film and (surprisingly) add and extend fight scenes.From what I can tell, almost all the deleted scenes are incorporated in. The elevator scene when spidey lost his powers, more emotional scene and character depth why he is losing his powers and the clock tower/subway fight with Doc Ock has been extended(although the extended scenes are very subtle).For Spider-man fans(such as myself), it is something that completes the entire context of the film and defines why Peter Parker is such a comic book hero than shall I even say Superman or Batman. He is broke, have a lot of hardships but he still travels the straight and difficult path just to do the right thing. His problems caused him to slowly lose his focus, hence his powers. He believes in (Stan Lee came up with this)""with great power comes great responsibility."" and Aunt May's ""sometimes we have to give up the things we want the most, even our dreams"" just defines Peter as human, with flaws but he is always willing to make a sacrifice.Now, I have some experience with marketing gimmicks to know this is also one. But for Spidey completist, (if it wasn't for us, no 2.1 wouldn't be released)it may be worth the purchase. It is not a superior cut of the original but it does fill up the void between 2 and 3. I already own the SE 2 disc release, as well as the outstanding Superbit version(the superbit version utilized 6.8 gb space out of the 7.4 gb dual layer)and I can't help getting a bitter taste in my mouth and now I heard Fantastic Four is also getting an extended cut.Video: The picture is amazing, although the superbit version is still a bit better. It looked like it has a better transfer from the first release. I didn't see any noise because of the extended scenes. Colors are radiant and vibrant. It was sharp and clean, and for some reason, the 2.1 transfer seemed brighter and yielded more detail in the black levels where needed. Superior transfer from the original SE.Audio: French, spanish, Portugese, English 5.1 DD track, sorry, no DTS-ES. Sound is crisp and loud with 5.1 Dolby Digital track.EXTRA FEATURES: Weak. The special features in the original dvd release are a lot better.

621491,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,B00005JMQW,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[3, 3]","Batman & Robin, Daredevil, The Hulk... All of these are examples of how not to make a comic book hero movie. Of the real 'Big 3' heroes out there, Batman and Superman of DC comics have had their big budget movies and have met with mixed success. Spider Man and Marvel themselves though have really never got off the ground as far as the silver screen goes... Until X-MenThere's no denying that the success of the X-Men film and Marvel's documented financial difficulties are what allowed the studios to get their claws into these franchises and while Hulk and Daredevil may have been disappointments, Stan Lee was never going to let his flagship character suffer the same fate.Spider Man 1 was, in my opinion, the best superhero movie I had seen. The character stuck to the comic books, with a few minor exceptions(the webbing being the one that really bent the fanatics noses out of joint). The temptation to cast a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt in the role was held at bay and some relatively unknown supporting members proved to be great in the from of Osbourne Jnr and Jameson.This was a sequel that had a lot to live up to... And boy did it deliver! Again, some of the origins were messed with, we all know Doc Ock was never a humanitarian or 'controlled' by his claws, he was evil of his own free will. Regardless, Molina was excellent as the villain, McGuire was still the dork he should have been and his wrestling with his alter ego really gave the movie the depth it needed.What makes Spiderman 2 a great movie is, not just the action sequences, but the realistic and believable relationships between the characters, with the exception of Jameson who is a welcome dose of 'over the top'. Osbourne's hatred for spider man slowly poisoning his friendship with Parker, Parker's love for MJ which he is forced to hide and MJ's pained frustration at Parker's refusal to open up, all add to the action we expect of this sort of movie.Then there is the action. Acrobatics, explosions, runaway trains, fights atop skyscrapers... This has them all. The set pieces are breathtaking and Spidey gets more than as good as he gets from Doctor Octopus. Molina may have been a less than orthodox action man, and the slight paunch evident at points supports that, but he pulled the role off magnificently.In wrapping up this review all I can say is the Spider Man 3 has some big boots to fill as this was a film that deserved all the box office records it broke and the DVD has some extras that really make it stand out as well",5,Spiderman Returns & Better Than Ever,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2514,"['Batman', 'Robin', 'Daredevil', 'Hulk', 'are', 'examples', 'how', 'not', 'make', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'movie', 'real', '3', 'heroes', 'there', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'DC', 'comics', 'have', 'had', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'have', 'met', 'mixed', 'success', 'Spider', 'Man', 'Marvel', 'though', 'have', 'really', 'never', 'got', 'ground', 'as', 'far', 'silver', 'screen', 'X-MenThere', 'denying', 'success', 'X-Men', 'film', 'Marvel', 'documented', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'are', 'what', 'allowed', 'studios', 'get', 'claws', 'franchises', 'Hulk', 'Daredevil', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'disappointments', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'let', 'flagship', 'character', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate.Spider', 'Man', '1', 'was', 'opinion', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'character', 'stuck', 'comic', 'books', 'few', 'minor', 'exceptions', 'webbing', 'being', 'one', 'really', 'bent', 'fanatics', 'joint', 'temptation', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'role', 'was', 'held', 'bay', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'supporting', 'members', 'proved', 'be', 'great', 'Osbourne', 'Jnr', 'Jameson.This', 'was', 'sequel', 'had', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'boy', 'did', 'deliver', 'Again', 'origins', 'were', 'messed', 'know', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'was', 'never', 'humanitarian', ""'controlled"", 'claws', 'was', 'evil', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'Regardless', 'Molina', 'was', 'excellent', 'villain', 'McGuire', 'was', 'still', 'dork', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'wrestling', 'alter', 'ego', 'really', 'gave', 'movie', 'depth', 'Spiderman', '2', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'action', 'sequences', 'realistic', 'believable', 'relationships', 'characters', 'exception', 'Jameson', 'who', 'welcome', 'dose', ""'over"", 'top', 'Osbourne', 'hatred', 'spider', 'man', 'slowly', 'poisoning', 'friendship', 'Parker', 'Parker', 'love', 'MJ', 'forced', 'hide', 'MJ', 'pained', 'frustration', 'Parker', 'refusal', 'open', 'up', 'add', 'action', 'expect', 'sort', 'movie.Then', 'action', 'Acrobatics', 'explosions', 'runaway', 'trains', 'fights', 'atop', 'skyscrapers', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'Spidey', 'more', 'as', 'good', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'Molina', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'orthodox', 'action', 'man', 'slight', 'paunch', 'evident', 'points', 'supports', 'pulled', 'role', 'magnificently.In', 'wrapping', 'up', 'review', 'can', 'say', 'Spider', 'Man', '3', 'big', 'boots', 'fill', 'was', 'film', 'deserved', 'box', 'office', 'records', 'broke', 'DVD', 'extras', 'really', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'well']",Spider-Man 2

However, this is a very minor complaint because this is just a great film.  On an emotional level, it has everything.  On a character level, it has everything.  On special effects, action, and story-telling it has everything (The fight sequences between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man are outstanding. Also, the elevated train sequence with Spider-Man is an emotional highlight of film and just a great piece of filmmaking. This sequence alone should garner an Academy Award nomination for special effects achievement).  This is by far, the best film adaption of a superhero comicbook character surpassing the first SPIDER-MAN, SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE (I/II) and BATMAN (I/II)movies. All involved stayed close to the source material but the magnification and enhancement of the source material is a hundred-fold and director Sam Raimi put it all together because he has a love and respect for the character(s).  Tobey McGuire was almost a no-go for the sequel due to some behind the scenes health problems (and other situations clouded in mystery), but thank the movie gods that he pulled himself together and made the film because he is so good as 'Peter Parker'.  Alfred Molina is equally great as Doctor Octopus/Otto Octavius, and even this character was expanded to more than a one-dimensional villian. As for the rest of the cast, not one flaw especially the character of Aunt May(Rosemary Harris). The film is laden with a lot of humor, but it is not campy nor is it a distraction to the overall dynamics of the film. This is a very satisfying film bringing to life one of most popular comicbook superheroes in the world and raising the bar for future film adaptions of comicbook heroes.

621495,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JMQW,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","After being intrigued by my introduction to the Spiderman character (through the first film), I was very excited to see what the second installment would bring now that the whole duel-identity thing was established.  Before the end credits had finished rolling, however, I knew that I wouldn't enjoy this film as much as its predecessor.  I noticed that the screenplay was written by Al Gough and Miles Millar, the creators of TV's Smallville (a show I watch weekly).  I should have been excited by that knowledge, as they created a very interesting show, but instead I felt my heart drop, as I knew EXACTLY the kind of contrived character relationships that would follow (think Clark/Lana on Smallville and you'll understand).The basic plot of the film has Spidey hanging up his red and blue suit in order to spend more time as Peter Parker with crush Mary Jane Watson.  Of course, just when things are looking up for that relationship, the evil Dr. Octopus begins to wreak havoc on New York City, essentially forcing the return of Spiderman and the break-up of Peter and MJ.While that short synopsis may sound like it has great potential for high drama, it (sadly) fails to deliver.  Millar and Gough just seemed to be rehashing the plot of Superman II, where Supes gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane only to see General Zod begin terrorizing Earth.  Thus, the storyline of the movie was a bit predictable.Also, again like Clark Kent and Lana Lang in Smallville, the Peter/MJ relationship is far too contrived and up-and-down to provide any real emotional scenes.  I never felt as if I really cared whether or not Peter/Spidey would save/love Mary Jane.  Adding to the lack of drama was a general lack of acting from Tobey Maguire, who seemed to react to every situation with that same wide-eyed expression.  While that tact worked very well while first harnessing his abilities in the first film, in this movie it just gets old.Finally, while the villain Doc Ock is visually pretty cool (what with all those tentacles flying around!), he again is a bit too much in common with the Green Goblin for my liking, as both were created in freak science experiments gone wrong.  Nothing like the intriguing character development of The Joker by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight.So, while the special effects of the film were excellent and the action scenes superb, I can't give it any better than an ""average"" rating due to all its contrived plots/relationships/characters.  If you are easily sucked in to hokey romances, you won't find any fault in this film.  If you prefer a more mature love story, though, then just watch it to set up your Spidey 3 viewing experience.",3,Too Contrived To Create Any Sort Of High Drama,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,2678,"['being', 'intrigued', 'introduction', 'Spiderman', 'character', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'second', 'installment', 'would', 'bring', 'now', 'whole', 'duel-identity', 'thing', 'was', 'established', 'end', 'credits', 'had', 'finished', 'rolling', 'however', 'knew', 'would', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'predecessor', 'noticed', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Al', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'creators', 'TV', 'Smallville', 'show', 'watch', 'weekly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'excited', 'knowledge', 'created', 'very', 'interesting', 'show', 'instead', 'felt', 'heart', 'drop', 'knew', 'EXACTLY', 'kind', 'contrived', 'character', 'relationships', 'would', 'follow', 'think', 'Clark/Lana', 'Smallville', ""'ll"", 'understand', '.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'Spidey', 'hanging', 'up', 'red', 'blue', 'suit', 'order', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'crush', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Watson', 'course', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'relationship', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'essentially', 'forcing', 'return', 'Spiderman', 'break-up', 'Peter', 'MJ.While', 'short', 'synopsis', 'may', 'sound', 'great', 'potential', 'high', 'drama', 'sadly', 'deliver', 'Millar', 'Gough', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'rehashing', 'plot', 'Superman', 'II', 'where', 'Supes', 'up', 'powers', 'be', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'only', 'see', 'General', 'Zod', 'begin', 'terrorizing', 'Earth', 'Thus', 'storyline', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'predictable.Also', 'again', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Smallville', 'Peter/MJ', 'relationship', 'far', 'too', 'contrived', 'up-and-down', 'provide', 'real', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'never', 'felt', 'really', 'cared', 'not', 'Peter/Spidey', 'would', 'save/love', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Adding', 'lack', 'drama', 'was', 'general', 'lack', 'acting', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'seemed', 'react', 'situation', 'same', 'wide-eyed', 'expression', 'tact', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'first', 'harnessing', 'abilities', 'first', 'film', 'movie', 'just', 'old.Finally', 'villain', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'visually', 'pretty', 'cool', 'what', 'tentacles', 'flying', 'around', 'again', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'common', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'liking', 'were', 'created', 'freak', 'science', 'experiments', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Nothing', 'intriguing', 'character', 'development', 'Joker', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight.So', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'were', 'excellent', 'action', 'scenes', 'superb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'better', 'average', 'rating', 'due', 'contrived', 'plots/relationships/characters', 'are', 'easily', 'sucked', 'hokey', 'romances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'fault', 'film', 'prefer', 'more', 'mature', 'love', 'story', 'though', 'then', 'just', 'watch', 'set', 'up', 'Spidey', '3', 'viewing', 'experience']",Spider-Man 2
