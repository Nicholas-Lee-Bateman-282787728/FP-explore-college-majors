Considering that was the worst movie I've seen in years, this is actually quite a bit better.  I give it two stars.  Some pharmaceutical company finds and old dead guy from the Amazon, turns out he was 200 years old when he died, they send a team to investigate.  They run into a big snake.  The characters are all cliches, from the greedy corporate guy to the rough-and-ready Amazon guide, but at least they're not caricatures of cliches like in Anacondas.  The story is a cliche as well, they meet some primitive tribe who know the secret, but they don't want anyone to know about it, some other stuff happens, guy kisses girl.  The cinematography is pretty good, and overall it's watchable.  If your expectations are kept extremely low.

957411,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000CDSS1I,Jason,"[0, 1]","Given that Snake Man was only enticing enough to get the third best Baldwin (Stephen Baldwin) it shouldn't be surprising that the rest of the movie is third-rate.  From a helicopter scene that looks like a cartoon, to a subway-sized, multi-headed papier-mch&eacute; snake, it is eminently clear that very minimal effort was expelled while during this movie's conception and creation.As far as the movie goes, it's basically an Anaconda rip-off.  A group of scientists led by a helicopter pilot named Matt (Baldwin) go to Brazil to ostensibly look for the Jaguar villagers and other pointless nonsense.  During the trip, the horrible CGI helicopter gets struck by equally atrocious CGI lightning, and the helicopter plummets to the jungle floor in the least believable crash since any ""Dukes of Hazzard"" episode.  During this sequence Matt is calm, cool, and collected (probably more to do with Baldwin #3's lack of acting ability than plot device).  Eventually they meet up with the Jaguar villagers, a comical collection of assorted aborigines randomly picked for no other reason than the fact that they look completely dissimilar and anything better would steal what little thunder the rest of the movie can muster.  Matt begins speaking Jaguar language with the ""village people""(tm), and we learn his parents were anthropologists in the area, he's an expert in hand-to-hand combat, and he's evidently a knife-throwing champion.The rest of the movie is nothing but bad special effects, ridiculous villagers with bad makeup - not to mention a hilarious prayer dance that looks as if Jennifer Lopez choreographed a tribal council from Survivor -pseudo-jungle talk, mumbo-jumbo about an Amazonian fountain of youth, and the snake thing playfully chomping people in half.A generally wretched movie all around, it's hardly even worth the effort or time for a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 night.",1,Sssssssssssszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,1891,"['Given', 'Snake', 'Man', 'was', 'only', 'enticing', 'enough', 'get', 'third', 'best', 'Baldwin', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprising', 'rest', 'movie', 'third-rate', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'cartoon', 'subway-sized', 'multi-headed', 'papier-mch', 'eacute', 'snake', 'eminently', 'clear', 'very', 'minimal', 'effort', 'was', 'expelled', 'movie', 'conception', 'creation.As', 'far', 'movie', 'basically', 'Anaconda', 'rip-off', 'group', 'scientists', 'led', 'helicopter', 'pilot', 'named', 'Matt', 'Baldwin', 'go', 'Brazil', 'ostensibly', 'look', 'Jaguar', 'villagers', 'other', 'pointless', 'nonsense', 'trip', 'horrible', 'CGI', 'helicopter', 'struck', 'equally', 'atrocious', 'CGI', 'lightning', 'helicopter', 'plummets', 'jungle', 'floor', 'least', 'believable', 'crash', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'episode', 'sequence', 'Matt', 'calm', 'cool', 'collected', 'probably', 'more', 'do', 'Baldwin', '3', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'plot', 'device', 'Eventually', 'meet', 'up', 'Jaguar', 'villagers', 'comical', 'collection', 'assorted', 'aborigines', 'randomly', 'picked', 'other', 'reason', 'fact', 'look', 'completely', 'dissimilar', 'anything', 'better', 'would', 'steal', 'what', 'little', 'thunder', 'rest', 'movie', 'can', 'muster', 'Matt', 'speaking', 'Jaguar', 'language', 'village', 'people', 'tm', 'learn', 'parents', 'were', 'anthropologists', 'area', 'expert', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'evidently', 'knife-throwing', 'champion.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'nothing', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'ridiculous', 'villagers', 'bad', 'makeup', 'not', 'mention', 'hilarious', 'prayer', 'dance', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'choreographed', 'tribal', 'council', 'Survivor', '-pseudo-jungle', 'talk', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'Amazonian', 'fountain', 'youth', 'snake', 'thing', 'playfully', 'chomping', 'people', 'half.A', 'generally', 'wretched', 'movie', 'around', 'hardly', 'even', 'effort', 'time', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theatre', '3000', 'night']",SnakeMan
957412,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B000CDSS1I,Joshua Koppel,"[5, 6]","An expedition in the Amazon finds a sarcophagus with a preserved mummy inside.  Research shows the Amazon Man died when he was more than 300 years old.  This sends a new team to find the source of the longevity and a now suspected lost tribe.  The team, mostly made up of typical greed-oriented characters, join a helicopter pilot (Baldwin) and set off into the jungle.  The team already there gets attacked while the new team's helicopter crashes.  Luckily the pilot just happens to speak Jaguar and enlists aid from the Jaguar people.Soon we meet the lost tribe and see lots of giant snake attacks.  The tribe is interesting.  White man only just theorized that such a tribe could exist and yet the chief speaks English (the Jaguar people who trade with Western civilization only speak their own language).  This lost tribe is the Snake People and they worship Naga, a snake god.  They also hold the secret of longevity which is a gift to the Snake People.  Add greed, a giant snake that may have more than one head (or may be multiple snakes as the images are contradictory), a tribe trying to protect itself and a pair of characters that actually care what is going on and you get a silly, schlocky monster film.  You'll have to watch to find out who survives.Watching this movie is like watching both Anaconda movies at once.  We have the lost tribe of the first movie and the longevity and multiple snakes of the second.  Baldwin plays a character who looks and sounds a lot like Voight's character in the first.  But it doesn't stop there.  Movie fans will recognize a lot of scenes from other movies including one from Godzilla vs. Spacegodzilla.  The snake monster is also a puzzler.  Many times we see the snake and enough of its body to see it has only one head.  Halfway through the movie the other heads show up but seem to spring out of nowhere.  Idols show Naga having multiple heads but the special effects seem confused.  It almost like they got halfway through the movie and decided to make the snake more monstrous by adding additional heads.  But whatever the case the thing does a lot of hunting and killing but very little eating.  If you want a silly monster film that requires little thought, or one where thought can actually ruin it, then this one is for you.  If you want something a little better than this won't fit the bill.

957413,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000CDSS1I,Robert I. Hedges,"[2, 2]","Great. Another giant snake movie. This one is generally much more trying than the ""Anaconda"" or ""Python"" films, and has among the worst CGI I have ever seen in my life. I really shouldn't be too shocked...as soon as I saw Boaz Davidson's producer credit I knew this would be tough slogging.The film, set in Brazil and actually made there (for which I give the production team credit), is a story of mysterious snake people who live for hundreds of years and the evil corporate goons who want to steal and exploit their secret. While ""Anaconda"" and ""Python"" (and other similar movies) have had menacingly large snakes, here the producers pull out all the stops and devise a humongous seven-headed snake to guard the secret of immortality. Stephen Baldwin is staggeringly banal in the lead role, but is frequently upstaged in the overacting department by most of the supporting cast, particularly Larry Day.The film opens with a helicopter crash in a jungle (which will seem very familiar to Boaz Davidson aficionados), and progresses to scientists being tormented by the snake with homage paid to many creature features before. The heroine, Susan, is rapidly kidnapped by the natives, and tries to free herself by making a deal with her evil capitalist bosses to return a mummy that was taken from the snake people. Needless to say, this doesn't work out as she expected, and results in a mini invasion of evil corporate types, which, of course, as any experienced viewer of this genre grasps means that the snake chow has arrived.Throughout the movie there are a variety of native actors who actually give the best performances of the film, despite their ludicrous costumes. In the end the giant murderous multi-headed reptile turns out to be the good guy (sort of) and helps the two lead characters find love in what might be one of the most ridiculously implausible yet noxiously saccharine scenes ever. To further continue the obvious plotlines, the evil guy gets his just reward: being drawn and quartered by a giant snake is certainly original punishment.At the end of this film I felt relief that it was over, but I must confess that it did have more originality than most other Davidson projects that I have seen, so I gave it two stars. The disc also contains a ""Behind the Scenes"" feature in which cast and crew offer platitudes about what a great movie ""Snakeman"" is. While my opinion is that they are decidedly incorrect, I think the only genuinely insightful quote in the extras is from Stephen Baldwin, who says ""I would have liked my character to have been eight pounds lighter."" If that's all he wants changed about this film, I think I'll pass on his future artistic endeavors.",2,"""You Come For The Gift?""",1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,2693,"['Great', 'giant', 'snake', 'movie', 'one', 'generally', 'much', 'more', 'trying', 'Anaconda', 'Python', 'films', 'worst', 'CGI', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'shocked', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'Boaz', 'Davidson', 'producer', 'credit', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'slogging.The', 'film', 'set', 'Brazil', 'actually', 'made', 'give', 'production', 'team', 'credit', 'story', 'mysterious', 'snake', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'hundreds', 'years', 'evil', 'corporate', 'goons', 'who', 'want', 'steal', 'exploit', 'secret', 'Anaconda', 'Python', 'other', 'similar', 'movies', 'have', 'had', 'menacingly', 'large', 'snakes', 'here', 'producers', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'devise', 'humongous', 'seven-headed', 'snake', 'guard', 'secret', 'immortality', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'staggeringly', 'banal', 'lead', 'role', 'frequently', 'upstaged', 'overacting', 'department', 'most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Larry', 'Day.The', 'film', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'jungle', 'will', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'Boaz', 'Davidson', 'aficionados', 'scientists', 'being', 'tormented', 'snake', 'homage', 'paid', 'many', 'creature', 'features', 'heroine', 'Susan', 'rapidly', 'kidnapped', 'natives', 'tries', 'free', 'making', 'deal', 'evil', 'capitalist', 'bosses', 'return', 'mummy', 'was', 'taken', 'snake', 'people', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'expected', 'results', 'mini', 'invasion', 'evil', 'corporate', 'types', 'course', 'experienced', 'viewer', 'genre', 'grasps', 'snake', 'chow', 'arrived.Throughout', 'movie', 'are', 'variety', 'native', 'actors', 'who', 'actually', 'give', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'ludicrous', 'costumes', 'end', 'giant', 'murderous', 'multi-headed', 'reptile', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'guy', 'sort', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'find', 'love', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculously', 'implausible', 'yet', 'noxiously', 'saccharine', 'scenes', 'ever', 'further', 'continue', 'obvious', 'plotlines', 'evil', 'guy', 'just', 'reward', 'being', 'drawn', 'quartered', 'giant', 'snake', 'certainly', 'original', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'relief', 'was', 'over', 'must', 'confess', 'did', 'have', 'more', 'originality', 'most', 'other', 'Davidson', 'projects', 'have', 'seen', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'disc', 'also', 'Scenes', 'feature', 'cast', 'crew', 'offer', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'Snakeman', 'opinion', 'are', 'decidedly', 'incorrect', 'think', 'only', 'genuinely', 'insightful', 'quote', 'extras', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'eight', 'pounds', 'lighter', 'changed', 'film', 'think', ""'ll"", 'pass', 'future', 'artistic', 'endeavors']",SnakeMan

Overall, the snake looks good. 4/5(Spoilers)Graphic RatingsSnakes first appearance- 3.5/5- Acceptable, kinda had the low budget look.Guy squeezed to death- 4.5/5- Well done, one of the best graphics in the movie, the blood and the snakes head could have used more work but overall it was good.Helicopter crash- 3/5- O.K, needed more work.Monkey eaten- 5/5- I wish it was all like this, looked great.Goat sacrificed- 2.5/5- It was smooth CGI but needed alot more work.Snake shows up- 5/5- very short but looked good.Two people eaten (the scene that reveals that the snake has multiple heads)- 2.5/5- Had great potential, needed so much more work.Snake pops up out of water hole and eats soldier- 3.5/5- Snake looked awesome eating soldier, the water around it was obviously animated.Local tribesman eaten- 4/5- looked awesomeNightmare of snake- 4/5- another short segmentLast surviver of first expedition eaten- 3.5/5 very nice, blood looked crappy, snake looked awesome.Fountain of youth ritual (finally you get a shot of the snake with all of its heads on screen)- 4.5/5 If it wasn't for the unrealistic tounge, it would have gotten the full 5.Soldiers explore cave and snake pops up- 1/5- No no no... looked like they put no work into it, the only reason it didn't get a 0 was because it cleaned up a little by the last segment.Last of soldiers taken out- 3.5/5- Nice shots of the full snake.Leader of expedition drawn and quartered- 3/5 needed more time but looked okThe last of the snake- 4/5- After it's all said and done the snake pokes his head in the cave at what he's done, and goes back out.Plot Review:An obvious rip of Anacondas. Other than that, the first movie I've seen with a Hydra like monster.Originality: 3/5Acting: Depends on what way you look at itBig Budget P.O.V: Not that good, around a 3.5/5Low Budget P.O.V: Awesome, better than any low budget movie I've seen, full 5/5.",4,Better Than I Expected,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,2348,"['just', 'bought', 'movie', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'watching', 'have', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'review', 'site', 'saying', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'time', 'kept', 'going', 'how', 'bad', 'CGI', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad.From', 'P.O.V', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'monster', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'CGI', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'either', 'had', 'interaction', 'issues', 'end', 'thats', 'Overall', 'snake', 'good', '4/5', 'Spoilers', 'Graphic', 'RatingsSnakes', 'first', 'appearance-', '3.5/5-', 'Acceptable', 'kinda', 'had', 'low', 'budget', 'look.Guy', 'squeezed', 'death-', '4.5/5-', 'Well', 'done', 'one', 'best', 'graphics', 'movie', 'blood', 'snakes', 'head', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'work', 'overall', 'was', 'good.Helicopter', 'crash-', '3/5-', 'O.K', 'needed', 'more', 'work.Monkey', 'eaten-', '5/5-', 'wish', 'was', 'looked', 'great.Goat', 'sacrificed-', '2.5/5-', 'was', 'smooth', 'CGI', 'needed', 'alot', 'more', 'work.Snake', 'shows', 'up-', '5/5-', 'very', 'short', 'looked', 'good.Two', 'people', 'eaten', 'scene', 'snake', 'multiple', 'heads', '2.5/5-', 'Had', 'great', 'potential', 'needed', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'work.Snake', 'up', 'water', 'hole', 'eats', 'soldier-', '3.5/5-', 'Snake', 'looked', 'awesome', 'eating', 'soldier', 'water', 'was', 'obviously', 'animated.Local', 'tribesman', 'eaten-', '4/5-', 'looked', 'awesomeNightmare', 'snake-', '4/5-', 'short', 'segmentLast', 'surviver', 'first', 'expedition', 'eaten-', '3.5/5', 'very', 'nice', 'blood', 'looked', 'crappy', 'snake', 'looked', 'awesome.Fountain', 'youth', 'ritual', 'finally', 'get', 'shot', 'snake', 'heads', 'screen', '4.5/5', 'was', ""n't"", 'unrealistic', 'tounge', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'full', '5.Soldiers', 'explore', 'cave', 'snake', 'pops', 'up-', '1/5-', 'No', 'looked', 'put', 'work', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', '0', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'little', 'last', 'segment.Last', 'soldiers', 'taken', 'out-', '3.5/5-', 'Nice', 'shots', 'full', 'snake.Leader', 'expedition', 'drawn', 'quartered-', '3/5', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'looked', 'last', 'snake-', '4/5-', 'said', 'done', 'snake', 'head', 'cave', 'what', 'done', 'back', 'out.Plot', 'Review', 'obvious', 'rip', 'Anacondas', 'Other', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Hydra', 'monster.Originality', '3/5Acting', 'Depends', 'what', 'way', 'look', 'itBig', 'Budget', 'P.O.V', 'Not', 'good', '3.5/5Low', 'Budget', 'P.O.V', 'Awesome', 'better', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'full', '5/5']",SnakeMan

A group of scientists go to the Amazon in search of a Fountain of Youth only to discover it is connected to a giant man-eating snake, who doesn't eat once a month like most snakes, but rather eats large meals daily like most man-eating movie snakes.The scene where the helicopter is in the air and gets struck by lightning, I watched several times. It reminded me of those old Flash Gordon serials where the plane is flying on a string.The movie has a lack of bad language, sexual scenes, or nudity. The gore is minimum, but people do get bit in half. It has that ""made for TV"" movie feel, which is bad.

This film is basically about a group of people who come across remains of a man who they claimed lived up to 300 years.  Now they are on a quest to find this secret to long life in the Brazilian jungle where they had found him.  Of course they come across some obstacles.  Some of the members get eaten by the huge snake and others are captured by a tribe known as the snake people who are related to the deceased ancient man.  Now they must try to get the ancient man back and return it to the snake people if they want to make it out alive.  Then the battle continues.I must say, the computer graphic image for the snake was not that good.  On some scenes it look computerized and did not look believeable.
