1635136,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BJ60KJA,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Let me start by saying that I love martial arts movies. I couldn't begin to tell you the number of times I've watched ENTER THE DRAGON but it is in the double digits. I've enjoyed the new comers to the genre when they began like Steven Segal, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme. I've liked the more current round of stars like Tony Jaa and Gary Daniels. That being said there is something that folks should realize when looking for a new martial arts film.The films made overseas in the Far East sometimes lose something in translation. Some don't like the historical martial arts films of the past. A few of the police films featuring some top fighting sequences lose something. But the ones that lose the most are those that are based as much in humor as in fighting. They lose tons in translation. What is funny in one country falls flat in another.That being said, THIS GIRL IS BADASS loses almost everything in translation. The film offers martial arts that are fairly weak and should be the foundation of the film. Instead we have a girl using her bicycle as a weapon and not believably so. But let's get to the plot first...if I followed it correctly.Jukkalan is a bicycle courier who speeds around town delivering items for various people. Currently she's been assigned to transport some packages for some underworld types who then want to take back the money they paid her after she delivers their package. Why they would risk so much for so little is beyond me. Instead of dying though she uses her aforementioned martial arts/bicycle skills to take down the gang sent to dispose of her.Then she gets another job to transport another package for another mobster. The first one apparently wants to sit back a while before tangling with her again. Once more she's attacked after delivering the package and yet she continues to work the same job. Not only that but she's been lifting a portion of the profits from each delivery.If this wasn't enough of a plot we have a few others as well. One involves her uncle, a man in love with the woman who lives next door and who does laundry. But her uncle has some sort of shady past we don't find out about till near the end of the film. Then there's the boy next door, a goofy looking guy who is in love with Jukkalan. But she's in love with the hunky guy who lives nearby and sits around playing guitar all the time.The plot lines in this film are as lame as they can be and the mixing of one storyline to another fails miserably. The acting is one of two things, either really bad or simply so unlike that seen in other countries as to appear terrible. Perhaps these would be unnoticeable in the country it was filmed in but here it's the main thing we see. The worst sin of all though is the fighting sequences which seem forced at best and lame at worst.There is nothing I can say that would make this film an enjoyable experience. It was truly a movie I wouldn't waste time on. I would only recommend it to those who feel the need to watch every single martial arts film ever made. Myself, I'll watch the good ones over again.",2,"NO, SHE'S JUST BAD",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3087,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'tell', 'number', 'times', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'ENTER', 'THE', 'DRAGON', 'double', 'digits', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'new', 'comers', 'genre', 'when', 'began', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'more', 'current', 'round', 'stars', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'being', 'said', 'something', 'folks', 'should', 'realize', 'when', 'looking', 'new', 'martial', 'arts', 'film.The', 'films', 'made', 'overseas', 'Far', 'East', 'sometimes', 'lose', 'something', 'translation', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'historical', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'past', 'few', 'police', 'films', 'featuring', 'top', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'lose', 'something', 'ones', 'lose', 'most', 'are', 'are', 'based', 'much', 'humor', 'fighting', 'lose', 'tons', 'translation', 'What', 'funny', 'one', 'country', 'flat', 'being', 'said', 'THIS', 'GIRL', 'IS', 'BADASS', 'almost', 'everything', 'translation', 'film', 'martial', 'arts', 'are', 'fairly', 'weak', 'should', 'be', 'foundation', 'film', 'Instead', 'have', 'girl', 'using', 'bicycle', 'weapon', 'not', 'believably', 'so', 'let', 'get', 'plot', 'first', 'followed', 'correctly.Jukkalan', 'bicycle', 'courier', 'who', 'around', 'town', 'delivering', 'items', 'various', 'people', 'Currently', 'been', 'assigned', 'transport', 'packages', 'underworld', 'types', 'who', 'then', 'want', 'take', 'back', 'money', 'paid', 'package', 'Why', 'would', 'risk', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'Instead', 'dying', 'aforementioned', 'martial', 'arts/bicycle', 'skills', 'take', 'down', 'gang', 'sent', 'dispose', 'her.Then', 'job', 'transport', 'package', 'mobster', 'first', 'one', 'apparently', 'sit', 'back', 'while', 'tangling', 'again', 'Once', 'more', 'attacked', 'delivering', 'package', 'yet', 'work', 'same', 'job', 'Not', 'only', 'been', 'lifting', 'portion', 'profits', 'delivery.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'plot', 'have', 'few', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'uncle', 'man', 'love', 'woman', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'who', 'laundry', 'uncle', 'sort', 'shady', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'till', 'end', 'film', 'Then', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'goofy', 'looking', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'Jukkalan', 'love', 'hunky', 'guy', 'who', 'nearby', 'around', 'playing', 'guitar', 'time.The', 'plot', 'lines', 'film', 'are', 'as', 'lame', 'can', 'be', 'mixing', 'one', 'storyline', 'fails', 'miserably', 'acting', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'either', 'really', 'bad', 'simply', 'so', 'seen', 'other', 'countries', 'appear', 'terrible', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'be', 'unnoticeable', 'country', 'was', 'filmed', 'here', 'main', 'thing', 'see', 'worst', 'sin', 'though', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'seem', 'forced', 'best', 'lame', 'worst.There', 'nothing', 'can', 'say', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'was', 'truly', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'who', 'feel', 'need', 'watch', 'single', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'Myself', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'good', 'ones', 'again']",This Girl Is Badass

I guess what works against me about this film, or any film from overseas, is that the comedy always stinks.  These movies try to be funny and the end result is just stupid.So, with this Thai film, not only are the characters really annoying, but the comedy is terrible too. And as an added disappointment, some of the action scenes are so exaggerated, that they too, come off as annoying.And what's more, the pretty girls in this film just isn't worthy enough to want to watch this film again, so this DVD will be either given away or thrown away.I trust that it may be appreciated more by kids younger than 8 years old.

1635138,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B00BJ60KJA,shaun brammer,"[0, 3]","Due to finances, time considerations, as well as the laws surrounding international releases, I am not always able to watch the movies I want when I want. As a result I sometimes find myself making an impulse buy to satisfy movie watching desires that have remained unfulfilled. Case in point was my purchase of This Girl is Badass. The movie stars Thai actress 'Jeeja' Yanin Vismitananda, from Chocolate and Raging Phoenix fame. Jeeja has become famous as she is a martial artist who has been compared to another Thai actor, Tony Jaa. I am a sucker for a good stunt based martial arts flick. I wanted to see both of these other movies of hers, but never had the opportunity. So, when I was standing at the store and saw the Thai action-comedy, This Girl is Badass, starring the famed female butt-kicker, I thought this was my chance to finally see her in action. My wife took one look at it and warned me it would be stupid. The impulse was too much, it overpowered her warning.The cast is hard to critique for the script is so bad I can't honestly believe that the most talented actor could save it. There is no explanation for what is going on or why. You never quite understand what people are doing. For example, everyone seems to have a plan and they talk about this plan, but never talk about it and you're never shown anything that helps you understand what the plan is. ""What are you going to do about the plan?"", would say one while another says, ""Don't worry, I have a plan."" Most of what is said is some kind of joke and most of those are horribly lame. The few times there is something funny it seems to come about from the natural talents of the comedic actors staring in this film. These moments seem like improvised acting that the director decided was better than the script.Jeeja plays a young woman named Jukakalan, who is a bike messenger that delivers drugs for different crime bosses. She has an adoptive uncle named Wang, played by Petchtai Wongkamlao (a.k.a. Mum Jokmok) who is known as being a funny man and is the director of the film. She also has a very stupid friend named Naew, played by Bawriboon Chanreuang, who is always wearing bike riding uniforms. Her boss, Samureng, played by Akom Preedakul, is always dressed in some outlandish outfit that makes him look like a pornographic circus clown. She has an admirer named Duan, played by Chalerm Yamchamang, who is always dressed in white with bad pastel sweaters and bow ties. So many of the actors play their parts with outrageous accents, making them sound cheesy and cartoonish. It seems the idea was that if the actors were dressed like idiots and spoke like idiots the jokes would go over better. Jeeja begans stealing from the bosses, though why is never made clear. They want their money and thus we have incredibly unimaginative plot.I am ok with a martial arts movie having a poor premise as long as unbelievable stunts follow each other back to back. I watch these movies for the same reason people go to the circus, to see crazy unrealistic things happen before your very eyes. Jeeja's fight scenes, however, are few and far between with so much weak and annoying dialogue to wade through before you get to one. The action itself seems slower than it should as well. It is as if they didn't film it right, slow setting maybe, or Jeeja just isn't as good as Tony Jaa. There are too many times the film slows down so you can watch a not very impressive stunt play out. Normally in such movies you don't get to see a punch or kick coming. That is good. You want to be taken by surprise like the poor bastard taking the punch. Unfortunately, every last punch in this movie was telegraphed.  You knew what was going to happen because the actors are standing there preparing for the foot to kick them. The choreographed moves look like unpracticed choreographed moves. The imagination behind the scenes as well is weak, only there to showcase something that they thought would be cool, but never bothering to develop a natural flow that would get the characters riding a bike rack being pulled by a van logically. Yes, this happens in the film, but you don't know why and it is not impressive.There is also a fun little public service message you're subjected to. Uncle Wang runs a store that sells movies, DVDs and VCDs. He has competition across the way from person who sells pirated DVDs. This guy does pretty well for himself, better than Wang, until he is arrested and sent to prison for selling pirated DVDs. Wang then gives the viewer an after school special speech about how the law is changing. It will bring harsh punishments to people who pirate movies and how pirating a DVD is theft, just like any other kind of theft. He holds his head in frustration over why anyone would want to steal someone else's idea. If only Hollywood had Uncle Wang as a spokesmen to talk to a nation of people as if they are little misguided children.While I still have a desire to see her other movies, for she got famous for something, I am certainly not spending any money on impulse buys. If you have any interest in watching how the Thai film industry is developing, and it is, you might want to watch this. Though, I don't see this movie doing a lot for the reputations of Thai film makers. However, I am willing to bet you care little about that, which means you have no reason to watch this film. Unless you think Jeeja is cute and just like watching her, which I am sure will sell some people. As the movie was wrapping up, it has a very long and painful ending like a villain who just won't die, my wife said, ""See! I told you it was stupid. Don't listen to me, waste money."" Yes, I should always heed my love's warnings.",1,My Wife is Mad,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,5708,"['Due', 'finances', 'time', 'considerations', 'as', 'well', 'laws', 'surrounding', 'international',

Jukkalan happens to be a martial arts fighter, and using her bicycle and other props, she fights back those thugs in a style that slightly reminds us of Jackie Chan.In fact, ""This Girl is Badass"" is not a bona fide action movie. This is more like an action comedy with too little martial arts and too much comedy. The film's storyline is almost non-existent. You meet the heroine's kind ""Uncle"" Wang (Petchtai Wongkamlao, who also directs) and her love-smitten childhood friend Duan (Chalerm Yamchamang). You get several nice action set-pieces in ""This Girl is Badass,"" but, entertaining as they are, they need more energy and creative ideas.The comedy with cartoonish jokes (with a few rom-com elements) is a change of pace for the star Jeeja Yanin. The ""Chocolate"" star is surprisingly effective as an ordinary girl who has a crush on a handsome singer in her neighborhood. It is unfortunate that the thread is discarded rather unceremoniously.It seems there is more than one version of the movie. If so, that will explain some subplots that do not make sense at all (like Uncle Wang's past, for instance).Whichever version you watch, ""This Girl is Badass"" is not an action-packed movie that you might be led to believe from the name of the star. The action you get here is acceptable, but those who are looking for intense martial arts action of ""Chocolate"" will be disappointed.",3,(2.5 STARS) More Like a Comedy Than an Action,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,1512,"['latest', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Badass', 'Jeeja', 'Yanin', 'bike', 'messenger', 'Jukkalan', 'who', 'attacked', 'group', 'local', 'thugs', 'Jukkalan', 'be', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighter', 'using', 'bicycle', 'other', 'props', 'back', 'thugs', 'style', 'slightly', 'Jackie', 'Chan.In', 'fact', 'Girl', 'Badass', 'not', 'bona', 'fide', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'action', 'comedy', 'too', 'little', 'martial', 'arts', 'too', 'much', 'comedy', 'film', 'storyline', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'meet', 'heroine', 'kind', 'Uncle', 'Wang', 'Petchtai', 'Wongkamlao', 'who', 'also', 'love-smitten', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Duan', 'Chalerm', 'Yamchamang', 'get', 'several', 'nice', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'Girl', 'Badass', 'entertaining', 'are', 'need', 'more', 'energy', 'creative', 'ideas.The', 'comedy', 'cartoonish', 'jokes', 'few', 'rom-com', 'elements', 'change', 'pace', 'star', 'Jeeja', 'Yanin', 'Chocolate', 'star', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'ordinary', 'girl', 'who', 'crush', 'handsome', 'singer', 'neighborhood', 'unfortunate', 'thread', 'discarded', 'rather', 'unceremoniously.It', 'more', 'one', 'version', 'movie', 'so', 'will', 'explain', 'subplots', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'Uncle', 'Wang', 'past', 'instance', 'version', 'watch', 'Girl', 'Badass', 'not', 'action-packed', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'name', 'star', 'action', 'get', 'here', 'acceptable', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'intense', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'Chocolate', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",This Girl Is Badass
