823727,AB43UAL8F1XR1,B00023TG6E,Cynthia,"[3, 3]",I borrowed this DVD from our library and my boys loved it so much I bought it!  My boys love the title song and especially Antartic Antics.  It's like a mini-opera for children.  The vocabulary is for older children but my boys didn't mind- they learned the words easily with the music to help them.  This is one they ask for again and again.,4,One of my boys' favorites!,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,342,"['borrowed', 'DVD', 'library', 'boys', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'bought', 'My', 'love', 'title', 'song', 'especially', 'Antartic', 'Antics', 'mini-opera', 'children', 'vocabulary', 'older', 'children', 'boys', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind-', 'learned', 'words', 'easily', 'music', 'help', 'one', 'ask', 'again', 'again']",There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly... and More Stories That Sing Scholastic Video Collection
823728,A25KKXUQQ0OLWB,B00023TG6E,"Lynn Ellingwood ""The ESOL Teacher""","[1, 1]","All but one of these stories are performed musically.  That may be your cup of tea, but maybe not.  Be prepared.  I really enjoyed it.  I don't know how Antarctic Antics could have been done any other way since it is a book of children's poems.  The stories are very nice and done very well.  There are some songs I enjoy more than others but that is common in musical versions of books, etc.  I really liked the Waiting for Wings song and some of the Antarctic Antic songs.  Highly recommended, you just have to know that this DVD is musical.",5,Scholastic Musical DVD!,1225497600,"11 1, 2008",2008,543,"['one', 'stories', 'are', 'performed', 'musically', 'may', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'maybe', 'not', 'Be', 'prepared', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Antarctic', 'Antics', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'other', 'way', 'book', 'children', 'poems', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'songs', 'enjoy', 'more', 'others', 'common', 'musical', 'versions', 'books', 'etc', 'really', 'liked', 'Waiting', 'Wings', 'song', 'Antarctic', 'Antic', 'songs', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'DVD', 'musical']",There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly... and More Stories That Sing Scholastic Video Collection

However upon viewing it was soon clear that the video wouldn't work as a sing a long and it is not very engaging.  The stories are good but the performances aren't that great and the visuals are sometimes slow.,2,Not as good as I hoped,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,260,"['When', 'saw', 'video', 'was', 'immediately', 'excited', 'However', 'viewing', 'was', 'soon', 'clear', 'video', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'sing', 'long', 'not', 'very', 'engaging', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'visuals', 'are', 'sometimes', 'slow']",There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly... and More Stories That Sing Scholastic Video Collection
