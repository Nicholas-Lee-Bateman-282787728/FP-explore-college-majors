Vaduva might not be my first choice (it wouldn't be Netrebko)but her voice and physicality suggest the youth and sensitivity one would expect in a Juliette. Subsequent recordings of Vaduva available at one time on CD, a Boheme and an aria collection were disappointing. The Boheme was in particular a disappointment as it has a very starry cast--Vaduva excepted. But I can't criticize her Juliette. Nor the rest of the cast, notably Alagna. What a pleasure to hear him sing French. Surely he will offer us a Faust. But in the meantime I recomment his Romeo the score of which I think is superior to Faust. Interestingly enough the worst music of the Berlioz ""drammatic symphony"" is the music he wrote the Frere Laurence; the same can be said of Gounod's attempt; even with an artist with the distinction of Robert Lloyd he is unable to rise above the banal, but the fault is Gounod's, not Lloyd's.

686403,A1M1WYRFPG4U3Q,B00005UW8C,D. Fair,"[0, 2]","Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be the most commonly read and performed story in the western world, but as Covent Garden has proved, that doesn't mean it can't still be thrilling and exciting. I had the pleasure of viewing Gounod's Rom&eacute;o et Juliette, in a production from 1994 at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. In 2011, when the edgy and radical opera production is the fad, it was refreshing to see a production where concepts were clear and the production values reflected the story. Nicolas Jol's set had mostly white, grey, and light blue tones, which fit the tragic tale, but left a certain something to be desired that might have added to the romantic aspect of the plot.  However, this certainly did not detract from the fine performances and the director's commitment to convey the story.Few sopranos in the world could have honored the role of Juliette as well as Leontina Vaduva did in this performance. She gave a studied and carefully crafted portrayal. Her eyes were constantly focused, alive, and aware of the action. Her entire being was dedicated to Juliet's complex emotional variations throughout the entire opera. The soprano's voice seemed to shine even in the most tender and dramatic moments. I can't say Vaduva had the limpid lightness of voice that ""Je veux vivre"" requires, but her ""Amour, ranime mon courage"" was as close to perfection as one gets.  Seeing the horror and disgust in her eyes as she sang of the idea of awaking, entombed alive and touching her dead cousin, was educational to any young singer in the art of conveying words while not sacrificing singing. Vocally, each onset was light; yet, she was able to manage thrilling dramatic passages without wavering on beauty of sound. Vaduva is one of the most compelling singing actresses I've had the delight of watching.Roberta Alagna sang Rom&eacute;o with consistency and control, but was dramatically lacking, at times. Credit is rightly given to his singing ability, as he is a truly capable tenor whose dramatic vocal powers were at his whim. While I have no doubt that Alagna studied and understood Rom&eacute;o, Alagna's acting lacked subtlety and nuance. I didn't understand why a flighty and bouncy Juliette would want to hold the hand of a person who seemed too serious and intense for her bright youth. In addition, many times throughout the performance Alagna just stopped and simply sang to the audience. While I don't feel that his acting was any less studied than many singers who have graced the operatic stage, his flaws were revealed all too well (but inadvertently) by his costar's truly seasoned performance.Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet adapts to opera very well. Jules Barbier and Michel Carr&eacute; had to shave the story down for musical purposes, but included the basic plot points. This resulted in my finding that I could sit back and truly enjoy the performance for its music and the drama and not worry about catching every single word. This was supported by the production, which was non-distracting from the story, as many modern-day productions tend to be.  I rate this performance a 4 out of 5, losing the one point because of the set and costume's slightly tired and reused look. However, the performances were largely satisfying. I highly recommend this production for anyone who'd like to see what I believe Gounod would have intended - the opera's story and music standing on their own as a great work of art.",4,Rom&eacute;o et Juliette's Opportunity to Stand on its Own,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,3455,"['Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'commonly', 'read', 'performed', 'story', 'western', 'world', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'proved', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'still', 'be', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'had', 'pleasure', 'viewing', 'Gounod', 'Rom', 'eacute', 'et', 'Juliette', 'production', '1994', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'House', 'Covent', 'Garden', '2011', 'when', 'edgy', 'radical', 'opera', 'production', 'fad', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'production', 'where', 'concepts', 'were', 'clear', 'production', 'values', 'reflected', 'story', 'Nicolas', 'Jol', 'set', 'had', 'mostly', 'white', 'grey', 'light', 'blue', 'tones', 'fit', 'tragic', 'tale', 'left', 'certain', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'might', 'have', 'added', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'plot', 'However', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'fine', 'performances', 'director', 'commitment', 'convey', 'story.Few', 'sopranos', 'world', 'could', 'have', 'honored', 'role', 'Juliette', 'as', 'well', 'Leontina', 'Vaduva', 'did', 'performance', 'gave', 'studied', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'portrayal', 'eyes', 'were', 'constantly', 'focused', 'alive', 'aware', 'action', 'entire', 'being', 'was', 'dedicated', 'Juliet', 'complex', 'emotional', 'variations', 'entire', 'opera', 'soprano', 'voice', 'seemed', 'shine', 'even', 'most', 'tender', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Vaduva', 'had', 'limpid', 'lightness', 'voice', 'Je', 'veux', 'vivre', 'Amour', 'ranime', 'mon', 'courage', 'was', 'close', 'perfection', 'one', 'Seeing', 'horror', 'disgust', 'eyes', 'sang', 'idea', 'awaking', 'entombed', 'alive', 'touching', 'dead', 'cousin', 'was', 'educational', 'young', 'singer', 'art', 'conveying', 'words', 'not', 'sacrificing', 'singing', 'Vocally', 'onset', 'was', 'light', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'manage', 'thrilling', 'dramatic', 'passages', 'wavering', 'beauty', 'sound', 'Vaduva', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'singing', 'actresses', ""'ve"", 'had', 'delight', 'watching.Roberta', 'Alagna', 'sang', 'Rom', 'eacute', 'consistency', 'control', 'was', 'dramatically', 'lacking', 'times', 'Credit', 'rightly', 'given', 'singing', 'ability', 'truly', 'capable', 'tenor', 'dramatic', 'vocal', 'powers', 'were', 'whim', 'have', 'doubt', 'Alagna', 'studied', 'understood', 'Rom', 'eacute', 'Alagna', 'acting', 'lacked', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'flighty', 'bouncy', 'Juliette', 'would', 'want', 'hold', 'hand', 'person', 'who', 'seemed', 'too', 'serious', 'intense', 'bright', 'youth', 'addition', 'many', 'times', 'performance', 'Alagna', 'just', 'stopped', 'simply', 'sang', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'acting', 'was', 'less', 'studied', 'many', 'singers', 'who', 'have', 'graced', 'operatic', 'stage', 'flaws', 'were', 'revealed', 'too', 'well', 'inadvertently', 'costar', 'truly', 'seasoned', 'performance.Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'adapts', 'opera', 'very', 'well', 'Jules', 'Barbier', 'Michel', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'had', 'shave', 'story', 'down', 'musical', 'purposes', 'included', 'basic', 'plot', 'points', 'resulted', 'finding', 'could', 'sit', 'back', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'performance', 'music', 'drama', 'not', 'worry', 'catching', 'single', 'word', 'was', 'supported', 'production', 'was', 'non-distracting', 'story', 'many', 'modern-day', 'productions', 'tend', 'be', 'rate', 'performance', '4', '5', 'losing', 'one', 'point', 'set', 'costume', 'slightly', 'tired', 'reused', 'look', 'However', 'performances', 'were', 'largely', 'satisfying', 'highly', 'recommend', 'production', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'what', 'believe', 'Gounod', 'would', 'have', 'intended', 'opera', 'story', 'music', 'standing', 'own', 'great', 'work', 'art']","Gounod - Romeo et Juliette / Mackerras, Alagna, Vaduva, Royal Opera Covent Garden"
686404,A3PQJ6J7FOOWFG,B00005UW8C,"Dr. John W. Rippon ""May 19, 1932 and still going""","[3, 3]","The majority of previous reviewers have pronounced this recording of Romeo et Juliette to be an excellent performance of an old fashioned opera done in an old fashioned way. They emphasize the great performances of the cast and the inspired conducting of Charle Makarras. I find their judgement accurate and only wish to confirm their verdict. I would add that to me it is one of the most satisfying of any recorded performance in my personal collection of over 300 opera DVDs. What is more, after several run throughs over a period of several months I think it to be that rarest of the rare: a perfect performance.The characterization of Robert Alagna is as close to the adolescent youth complete with impish bravado and raging hormones as can be found anywhere. I have seen and heard Alagna in live and recorded performances in many roles and have not been a fan, but he excels here. This is a 1996 project and the sweet youthful voice is not apperant in his present day singing of which I am aware. The Juliette of Leontina Vadova is girlish insouciance that develops into deep infatuation and perhaps love. Vadova is just right for the part. She's an innocent country girl, a little plump, not an elegant princess and she acts it all very well. The four love duets with Alagna are electric music making. They play off each other very well.In my youth I was unmoved by most French opera except for Berlioz ""Les Troyens"". Faust had it's moments, Massenet I found cloying but then I heard Mirella Freni and Franco Corelli in Romeo et Juliette and fell in love. I've seen and heard many productions of this opera since including the Villazon and Machaidze but nothing has come near to perfection as this present one.I believe there is a reason for this. One can go to a local amateur performance of Brahms second symphony as I did recently and still get something out of it. It is because it is great music. Romeo et Juliette is a B list opera at best and therefore requires the magic of the interaction of just the right players in all parts, the right staging and the right conducting to bring life to a less than viable score. Gounod wrote a dozen operas of which only two survive today. One, Faust (1859) is the most played opera in the history of opera (The Metropolitan Opera of New York was nicknamed the Faustspielhaus at one time). But even it had to be reworked many times before it became popular. Romeo et Juliette (1867) was the only immediate success (a succes fou) he had with any opera though he wrote three more. In his last 12 years he wrote nothing. Yet Romeo et Juliette is loved by all. Even the great Verdi recalls the Act 4 duet of Romeo et Juliette in the beginning of the Act 1 duet in his magnificent Otello. Romeo et Juliette is weak in many places such as the pedantic music of Frere Laurent and much is open to parody, however in places the composer reaches heights he never before or after attained.",5,A Perfect Performance,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,2929,"['majority', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pronounced', 'recording', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'be', 'excellent', 'performance', 'old', 'fashioned', 'opera', 'done', 'old', 'fashioned', 'way', 'emphasize', 'great', 'performances', 'cast', 'inspired', 'conducting', 'Charle', 'Makarras', 'find', 'judgement', 'accurate', 'only', 'wish', 'confirm', 'verdict', 'would', 'add', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'recorded', 'performance', 'personal', 'collection', '300', 'opera', 'DVDs', 'What', 'more', 'several', 'run', 'throughs', 'period', 'several', 'months', 'think', 'be', 'rarest', 'rare', 'perfect', 'performance.The', 'characterization', 'Robert', 'Alagna', 'as', 'close', 'adolescent', 'youth', 'complete', 'impish', 'bravado', 'raging', 'hormones', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'have', 'seen', 'heard', 'Alagna', 'live', 'recorded', 'performances', 'many', 'roles', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'fan', 'here', '1996', 'project', 'sweet', 'youthful', 'voice', 'not', 'apperant', 'present', 'day', 'singing', 'am', 'aware', 'Juliette', 'Leontina', 'Vadova', 'girlish', 'insouciance', 'deep', 'infatuation', 'perhaps', 'love', 'Vadova', 'just', 'right', 'part', 'innocent', 'country', 'girl', 'little', 'plump', 'not', 'elegant', 'princess', 'very', 'well', 'four', 'love', 'duets', 'Alagna', 'are', 'electric', 'music', 'making', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well.In', 'youth', 'was', 'unmoved', 'most', 'French', 'opera', 'Berlioz', 'Les', 'Troyens', 'Faust', 'had', 'moments', 'Massenet', 'found', 'cloying', 'then', 'heard', 'Mirella', 'Freni', 'Franco', 'Corelli', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'fell', 'love', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'heard', 'many', 'productions', 'opera', 'including', 'Villazon', 'Machaidze', 'nothing', 'come', 'perfection', 'present', 'one.I', 'believe', 'reason', 'One', 'can', 'go', 'local', 'amateur', 'performance', 'Brahms', 'second', 'symphony', 'did', 'recently', 'still', 'get', 'something', 'great', 'music', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'B', 'list', 'opera', 'best', 'therefore', 'magic', 'interaction', 'just', 'right', 'players', 'parts', 'right', 'staging', 'right', 'conducting', 'bring', 'life', 'less', 'viable', 'score', 'Gounod', 'wrote', 'dozen', 'operas', 'only', 'two', 'survive', 'today', 'One', 'Faust', '1859', 'most', 'played', 'opera', 'history', 'opera', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Faustspielhaus', 'one', 'time', 'even', 'had', 'be', 'reworked', 'many', 'times', 'became', 'popular', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', '1867', 'was', 'only', 'immediate', 'success', 'succes', 'fou', 'had', 'opera', 'wrote', 'three', 'more', 'last', '12', 'years', 'wrote', 'nothing', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'loved', 'Even', 'great', 'Verdi', 'Act', '4', 'duet', 'Romeo', 'et', 'Juliette', 'beginning', 'Act', '1', 'duet', 'magnificent', 'Otello', 'Romeo', 'Juliette', 'weak', 'many', 'places', 'such', 'pedantic', 'music', 'Frere', 'Laurent', 'much', 'open', 'parody', 'however', 'places', 'composer', 'heights', 'never', 'attained']","Gounod - Romeo et Juliette / Mackerras, Alagna, Vaduva, Royal Opera Covent Garden"

The final scene of this opera with the two doomed and dying lovers desperately reaching out for one last unobtainable kiss could ""make the stones weep"" in this Covent Garden performance, taped in 1994.  The production is somewhat sparse but traditional, with beautiful costumes and atmosphere.  Supporting singers Francois Le Roux and Robert Lloyd do a fine job, but the focus of this performance is the two lovers and Alagna and Vaduva convince you with their voices and their demeanor that they are exactly that: young and in love. Two of the many vocal highlights are Alagna's aria, ""Ah, leve-toi soleil"" and the ensemble that ends Act Three.  Anytime the two lovers are onstage, there is operatic magic (all too rare these days). Alagna combines French style with Italian bravura and Vaduva has a voice with sweetness and vulnerablity which seems to grow in size for the dramatic and often cut Poison Aria.This DVD comes highly recommended to lovers of great singing which too often, in present times, is cast aside for singers who ""look and act the part"".

For some reason, at times, it feels weary watching her singing and acting. Both Vaduva and Alagna's acting are somewhat stagy, loaded with vehemence, while what's really lacking is the emotional communication between them.
