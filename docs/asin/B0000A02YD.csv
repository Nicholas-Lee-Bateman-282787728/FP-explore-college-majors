760706,A1PGC1GEBY9CZU,B0000A02YD,Happy Camper,"[1, 1]",Are You Being Served? Vol 13 is yet another winner in my book.  There's only one episode in here that's &#34;less good&#34; (note I didn't say bad) than the others.  After all those years the cast still feels as though they're enjoying their work instead of having been forced to go to work.Are You Being Served? was a definite winner in the BBC line up of the 70s and 80s.  PBS has done a great job interesting the 'Cousins across the Atlantic' and BBC Home Entertainment has made the series accessible.,5,Are You Free?,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,504,"['Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'Vol', '13', 'yet', 'winner', 'book', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'here', '34', 'less', 'good', '34', 'note', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'others', 'years', 'cast', 'still', ""'re"", 'enjoying', 'work', 'instead', 'having', 'been', 'forced', 'go', 'work.Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'was', 'definite', 'winner', 'BBC', 'line', '70s', '80s', 'PBS', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'interesting', ""'Cousins"", 'Atlantic', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'made', 'series', 'accessible']",Are You Being Served?

The guy they got to replace Mr. Lucas just isn't that great.These episodes are still funny and in keeping with the spirit of the show.I loved Friends and Neighbors -- the employees are given the opprotunity to live in some apartments above the store.The Night Club -- the staff are allowed to run a night club in the store after hours. Grace Brothers really is a crazy place. I found it hard to imagine having a night club in the middle of a clothing department where all the merchandise was out. Other than that, it was too funny. Especially when they make their own commercial and play it in a theater with audio only!The Pop Star -- the Mr. Lucas wanna-be (Mr. Spooner) gets an opprotunity to be a singer. This is the final episode of the series and although funny there's a lot more singing than anything else (the singing is silly though).",3,Two actors are gone by then,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,898,"['Mr.', 'Grainger', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'are', 'absent', 'volume', 'guy', 'got', 'replace', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'just', ""n't"", 'great.These', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'show.I', 'loved', 'Friends', 'Neighbors', 'employees', 'are', 'given', 'opprotunity', 'live', 'apartments', 'store.The', 'Night', 'Club', 'staff', 'are', 'allowed', 'run', 'night', 'club', 'store', 'hours', 'Grace', 'Brothers', 'really', 'crazy', 'place', 'found', 'hard', 'imagine', 'having', 'night', 'club', 'middle', 'clothing', 'department', 'where', 'merchandise', 'was', 'out', 'Other', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'Especially', 'when', 'make', 'own', 'commercial', 'play', 'theater', 'audio', 'only', 'Pop', 'Star', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'wanna-be', 'Mr.', 'Spooner', 'opprotunity', 'be', 'singer', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'funny', 'lot', 'more', 'singing', 'anything', 'else', 'singing', 'silly']",Are You Being Served?
