1503978,A249E17QH15NSN,B005UFUU6E,Charles 22,"[3, 3]","The 2 year hitch that is. I have never heard of this show but seeing the reviews on here and what the two main roles are, I decided to take the plunge. I'm only six episodes deep so far, and I can see there's some potential for better plots and teamwork later on. One thing that does concern me though, and that is the music. It's as loud or louder than when dialogue is ongoing. Some would call it jazz, but to me it's junk, not jazz. I just hope it's not so annoying I just don't drop the series altogether. I rarely hear music I can't identify by genre, but this is one of them - it's just all over the place and certainly not suitable for a western.As lousy as White Comanche was, at least that sounded like some jazz on a western, but it actually wouldn't surprise me too much to find that the people responsible for the music on that turkey, were the same ones here.I found out the music scores weren't from the same guy that did White Comanche, but by a guy called Juan Garcia Esquivel. IMDB had these things to say about his music, among other things. See if you see anything here that suggest jazz instead of junk:""Recorded music in a distinctly original way, with unorthodox composition and arrangement styles, often incoroprating Chinese bells, jaw harp, bass accordion, organ, harpsichord, a mariachi string band, a chorus shouting out nonsensical scat in harmony, and bongos with a traditional big band setting.His style of music has been called ""Spage Age Pop"" and ""Space Age Batchelor Pad Music"".My only wish is that they back off on the music volume some, and it's as strong as most any I have heard on a series, but part of that may be because I have to raise the volume in order to catch the full dialogue. I hope Juan's music got better over time, but given the IMDB description, I doubt it very seriously. I don't think I ever respected the music of Gunsmoke until I heard this stuff! The plots are going to have to go a long way in quality to make up for the annoyance of the music.Update: I'm now halfway through the 1st season, and I must say it is a good series, even with the music. The opening theme shows you what the show is about. Basically that Garrett leads and often Billy slides from underneath a rock to show up. I must say, this is a pretty refreshing series overall. It seems very dusty and worn, but it works very well.",4,Along For the Hitch,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2356,"['2', 'year', 'hitch', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'show', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'here', 'what', 'two', 'main', 'roles', 'are', 'decided', 'take', 'plunge', ""'m"", 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'deep', 'so', 'far', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'better', 'plots', 'teamwork', 'later', 'One', 'thing', 'concern', 'music', 'loud', 'louder', 'when', 'dialogue', 'ongoing', 'would', 'call', 'jazz', 'junk', 'not', 'jazz', 'just', 'hope', 'not', 'so', 'annoying', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'series', 'altogether', 'rarely', 'hear', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'identify', 'genre', 'one', 'just', 'place', 'certainly', 'not', 'suitable', 'western.As', 'lousy', 'White', 'Comanche', 'was', 'least', 'sounded', 'jazz', 'western', 'actually', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'too', 'much', 'find', 'people', 'responsible', 'music', 'turkey', 'were', 'same', 'ones', 'here.I', 'found', 'music', 'scores', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'guy', 'did', 'White', 'Comanche', 'guy', 'called', 'Juan', 'Garcia', 'Esquivel', 'IMDB', 'had', 'things', 'say', 'music', 'other', 'things', 'See', 'see', 'anything', 'here', 'suggest', 'jazz', 'instead', 'junk', 'Recorded', 'music', 'distinctly', 'original', 'way', 'unorthodox', 'composition', 'arrangement', 'styles', 'often', 'incoroprating', 'Chinese', 'bells', 'jaw', 'harp', 'bass', 'accordion', 'organ', 'harpsichord', 'mariachi', 'string', 'band', 'chorus', 'shouting', 'out', 'nonsensical', 'scat', 'harmony', 'bongos', 'traditional', 'big', 'band', 'setting.His', 'style', 'music', 'been', 'called', 'Spage', 'Age', 'Pop', 'Space', 'Age', 'Batchelor', 'Pad', 'Music', 'only', 'wish', 'back', 'music', 'volume', 'as', 'strong', 'most', 'have', 'heard', 'series', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'have', 'raise', 'volume', 'order', 'catch', 'full', 'dialogue', 'hope', 'Juan', 'music', 'got', 'better', 'time', 'given', 'IMDB', 'description', 'doubt', 'very', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'respected', 'music', 'Gunsmoke', 'heard', 'stuff', 'plots', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'quality', 'make', 'up', 'annoyance', 'music.Update', ""'m"", 'now', 'halfway', '1st', 'season', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'series', 'even', 'music', 'opening', 'theme', 'what', 'show', 'about', 'Basically', 'Garrett', 'often', 'Billy', 'slides', 'rock', 'show', 'up', 'must', 'say', 'pretty', 'refreshing', 'series', 'overall', 'very', 'dusty', 'worn', 'very', 'well']",The Tall Man - Complete TV Series - All 75 Episodes!
