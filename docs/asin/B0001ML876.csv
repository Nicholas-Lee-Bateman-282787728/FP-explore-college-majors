Thornberg,"[4, 4]","I purchased this DVD because it used the walk belt and I had recently gotten the newer DVD set with the 3 mile workout and the walk belt (http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Waistline-Markers-Included/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1266249109&sr=8-1) and was looking for additional workouts.  This one does not come with the belt however, so make sure you have it if you're just going to order this disc.  I'm sure the workout would work without the belt but it wouldn't really work your abs any extra.  It has three separate workouts of 1, 2 and 3 miles, each with warm up and cool down, and all use the belt.  Good workouts, and using the belt does increase the use of your core.  Definitely recommend!",4,Good set of workouts using walk belt,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,717,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'used', 'walk', 'belt', 'had', 'recently', 'gotten', 'newer', 'DVD', 'set', '3', 'mile', 'workout', 'walk', 'belt', 'http', '//www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Waistline-Markers-Included/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=sr_1_1', 'ie=UTF8', 's=dvd', 'qid=1266249109', 'sr=8-1', 'was', 'looking', 'additional', 'workouts', 'one', 'not', 'come', 'belt', 'however', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'have', ""'re"", 'just', 'going', 'order', 'disc', ""'m"", 'sure', 'workout', 'would', 'work', 'belt', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'abs', 'extra', 'three', 'separate', 'workouts', '1', '2', '3', 'miles', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'use', 'belt', 'Good', 'workouts', 'using', 'belt', 'increase', 'use', 'core', 'Definitely', 'recommend']",N/A

You don't need the belt to get a good workout either.  I like that this dvd has three different levels of the exercise program on it.  You can advance without having to buy another dvd.

They are having a good time! I can feel the benefits of the walk belt. Aside from the arm movements, the belt offers some back support, and I can feel my abs tightening as I raise my arms above my head. Occasionally, I will do the 2 mile walk, then follow it with the 3 mile walk..5 miles is a good workout. The pace is brisk, but you don't wear yourself out..definitely a great addition to your workout library.
