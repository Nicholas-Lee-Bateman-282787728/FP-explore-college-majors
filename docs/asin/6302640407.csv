324181,AP839YM0XJ664,6302640407,Ang Poon Kah,"[1, 5]","I borrowed the copy of unlawful entry which was bought from Amzon.com by David S Caleb. I watched and later found amazon.com to run out of stock and went over to videoflicks to make a purchase before items sold out fast. The story is basically about a cop going to a house to fit security alarm for the family which resulted in the cop whom is mentally unstable, seduces the wife of actor Kurt Russell. This seducing action looks more real with the camerawork having 'this type' or 'black and white face' indication on it. I am not going to talk too much before it is pointless to watch. This is one of the best film/movie to watch so far and is recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVD film/movie.

Neither do I) It isn't really an Action Movie, or a real Thriller, or a real Drama, it Certainly isn't a Comedy; and though I Love the 3 Priciple Performers, I Cannot Recommend the film, not even to their Die Hard Fans.Kurt Russel and Madeline Stowe Star as the Terrorised Two-some, while Ray Liotta Co-stars as the Terroriser. All three give  somewhat Bored, Lifeless performances. Liotta especially, his Psycho here is the Polar Opposite to his Psycho in &quot;Turbulence&quot; while Kurt's lead is Far from the Nervous Husband in &quot;Breakdown&quot;. Madeline comes off Best, but like the Males, she has played this role Many times before, and with more Assured Performances.What the film Does have going for it is it's Climax, the Actors come to life a little and we get a Satisfactory Conclusion. The Whole Film is Satisfactory when you think about it, (3 stars equals satisfactory) but I wanted.. Neigh.. Deserve More than that. I suppose seeing Russel and Liotta Face Off is worth the Rental Fee thoughJohnathon Kaplan's Directing and Pacing leave a lot to be Desired, as does the Screenplay which takes a Far while to get Going, and doesn't reall go anywhere.

324188,A3V4ZFNKJ21P1M,6302640407,Endless Kitchen,"[0, 0]","A newly wed couple move into a new home in an upper class area of Los Angeles, but they are soon the unfortunate victims of a burglary. Helpful Officer Pete Davis (Ray Liotta) and his partner Roy Cole (Roger E. Mosley) arrive on the scene and make a report while offering advice and console. Both the husband, Michael Carr (Kurt Russell), and the wife, Karen (Madeline Stowe), are charmed by the effusive and chatty Davis. Michael is even invited to a ""ride-along"" with the officers as they are on patrol, but as Davis' actions ravel, it may be that his intentions are not friendly or remotely noble. Davis is a highly respected member of law enforcement, but his actions are very suspicious, especially to Michael.Unlawful Entry is a well paced, grabbing and entertaining thriller. It is not wildly original or unpredictable (it came out the same year as another stalker-based film, The Bodyguard), but I found it entertaining and even a bit thrilling. The idea of a goldbricking cop who seems upstanding to authorities but is latently dangerous provides a solid premise; it is rather terrifying to think of being on your own against a police officer who faces little threat of punishment for breaking any and every boundary of the law and common decency. Who hasn't felt helpless or feared being helpless against corrupt authority with an agenda or vendetta? Unlawful Entry has an added creepiness due to the realistic vibes and feel of the film. The cinematography is a bit gritty and the slimy underbelly of L.A. is exposed.Ray Liotta sells the obsessed and ill-tempered officer very well; he has a knack for playing angered men with a bloodlust. Russell's character is very similar to Dustin Hoffman in Straw Dogs; a rather irenic and sensitive man who needs to face violence in order to protect himself and his wife. Madeline Stowe was a bit underdeveloped as the comely woman who might fall for the propaganda and seeds of mistrust planted by the dishonest Liotta. Surprisingly, the best performance might have been Mosley as the street wise, no-nonsense partner of the troubled and obsessed police officer. Unlawful Entry might not be a classic up there with Cape Fear or anything, but I found it a worthwhile watch despite the bathos at the very end, which still didn't quite ruin an otherwise decent finale.",3,An entertaining thriller,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2317,"['newly', 'wed', 'couple', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'upper', 'class', 'area', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'are', 'soon', 'unfortunate', 'victims', 'burglary', 'Helpful', 'Officer', 'Pete', 'Davis', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'partner', 'Roy', 'Cole', 'Roger', 'E.', 'Mosley', 'arrive', 'scene', 'make', 'report', 'offering', 'advice', 'console', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Carr', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'wife', 'Karen', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'are', 'charmed', 'effusive', 'chatty', 'Davis', 'Michael', 'even', 'invited', 'ride-along', 'officers', 'are', 'patrol', 'Davis', 'actions', 'ravel', 'may', 'be', 'intentions', 'are', 'not', 'friendly', 'remotely', 'noble', 'Davis', 'highly', 'respected', 'member', 'law', 'enforcement', 'actions', 'are', 'very', 'suspicious', 'especially', 'Michael.Unlawful', 'Entry', 'well', 'paced', 'grabbing', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'not', 'wildly', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'year', 'stalker-based', 'film', 'Bodyguard', 'found', 'entertaining', 'even', 'bit', 'thrilling', 'idea', 'goldbricking', 'cop', 'who', 'upstanding', 'authorities', 'latently', 'dangerous', 'solid', 'premise', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'think', 'being', 'own', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'little', 'threat', 'punishment', 'breaking', 'boundary', 'law', 'common', 'decency', 'Who', ""n't"", 'felt', 'helpless', 'feared', 'being', 'helpless', 'corrupt', 'authority', 'agenda', 'vendetta', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'added', 'creepiness', 'due', 'realistic', 'vibes', 'feel', 'film', 'cinematography', 'bit', 'gritty', 'slimy', 'underbelly', 'L.A.', 'exposed.Ray', 'Liotta', 'obsessed', 'ill-tempered', 'officer', 'very', 'well', 'knack', 'playing', 'angered', 'men', 'bloodlust', 'Russell', 'character', 'very', 'similar', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'rather', 'irenic', 'sensitive', 'man', 'who', 'face', 'violence', 'order', 'protect', 'wife', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'was', 'bit', 'underdeveloped', 'comely', 'woman', 'who', 'might', 'fall', 'propaganda', 'seeds', 'mistrust', 'planted', 'dishonest', 'Liotta', 'Surprisingly', 'best', 'performance', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Mosley', 'street', 'wise', 'no-nonsense', 'partner', 'troubled', 'obsessed', 'police', 'officer', 'Unlawful', 'Entry', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'classic', 'there', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'anything', 'found', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'bathos', 'very', 'end', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ruin', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'finale']",N/A

324191,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302640407,JGC,"[8, 10]","""Unlawful Entry"" came out at a time when Americans were so hungry for those suspenseful, yet rather predictable thrillers. Ray Liotta is Pete, the nice cop who is wound just a bit too tight. Have you ever noticed that all those kooks always start out really nice and then go crazy all of a sudden? That's what makes it so entertaining not to mention funny.If Ray Liotta was great, then Madeleine Stowe was nearly perfect in this movie. Karen had the personality of Delta Burke, the body of Madonna and the mannerisms of Bea Arthur. So she was a total handful. Karen was such a total drama queen and so over-the-top. The more her hubby told her to stay way from Pete, the more she went running toward him. It wasn't until he had his hand shoved up her skirt did Karen finally realize that Pete was a homocidal maniac. I loved the part in the very beginning when Karen made her grand entrance down the stairs to meet the policemen. You could tell she enjoyed having all eyes on her.Kurt Russell as Michael Carr was really one of the only totally normal people in this movie. I think my favorite scene with Michael was in the beginning when Karen complaiend that she ""can't sleep here."" So Michael offered to take her to a hotel. Little did he know, Karen meant she wanted to move! And what woman would not feel safe with Kurt Russell?What was up with Michael's lawyer, Roger? He was portrayed by Ken Lerner, who some viewers may remember from his bit parts on ""90210?"" (By the way, speaking of ""90210,"" didn't the Carr's residence look just like the Walsh Home?) Have you ever seen any lawyer do all this? Sure, I've seen a few. They either work for O.J., Michael Jackson or Brit Brit Spears. They don't run around like this for the common man! I suppose that's why this is called a movie, because it's made up.Officer Pete Davis was such a complete whack-job. I couldn't tell if something set him off (was it the way Karen acted around him, she was obviously very attracted to him,) or was he always like this? I love the part at the nightclub, when Pete shows up unannounced and ruffles Michael's feathers. But the scene with Pete and the hooker in his police car was just so ludicrous because it didn't add anything to the story. We already knew he was a nut and we already knew the level of respect he had for females. BTW, did anyone else think that the blonde hooker looked just like Olivia d'Abo?When it's apparent to Michael that Pete isn't going away he offers the nut some money to bug off. That doesn't work. So as a last resort Michael goes to Officer Roy Cole (Roger E. Mosley) for help. Officer Roy Cole is Pete's ride-along-buddy, who bragged to Michael when another hooker was buzzing around them, ""you see, these b itches can't get enough of us."" It really wasn't a very good idea for Officer Roy to confront Pete. Suffice it to say, Pete shut him up in another far-fetched (because any police investigation would uncovered who the real killer was) scheme.I also found the scene with Karen and Michael doing the nasty very funny. Actually I could not stop laughing when Officer Pete walks in right as Karen is literally straddling Michael. Of course Karen turns around and screams bloody murder, but one cannot help but think that she would have welcomed a menaje trois with Michael and Pete. Kurt Russell was totally believable, as the furious hubby though because there was pure furry in his eyes. He didn't blink once when he screamed to Pete, ""get the **** out of my house."" And just as Pete was being thrown out, Officer Roy popped his head in to make sure everything was copasetic. So funny because police don't do this.BTW, what was up with Penny (Deborah Offner,) Karen's colleague? I am referring to the odd expression on her mouth when Karen found her.

It's about a disturbed cop who has a romantic interest in a break-in victim's wife.  The setting in the beginning of the movie is in the suburbs of L.A.  Michael Carr (Kurt Russell) and his wife Karen (Madeleine Stowe) experience a break-in in the middle of the night.  The would-be robber is discovered by Michael and holds Karen hostage for a brief time before making his escape.  The couple calls the police and two officers arrive to ask questions and write a report.  It is at this time that one of the officers, Pete Davis (Ray Liotta), becomes smitten with Karen.  To sum up the rest of the movie, Pete Davis becomes obsessed with Karen so much that he goes out of his way to try to steal Karen away from Michael, even going as far as tinkering with computer records to give Michael $600.00 in unpaid parking tickets that Michael never received to begin with, and electronically cancelling Michael's credit cards.  It escalates from there, with Pete planting a large amount of cocaine in Michael's house, resulting in a SWAT team arriving and arresting Michael and putting him in jail.  Michael's lawyer Roger (Ken Lerner) goes out of his way to help him out, even bailing him out of jail.  By this time, Pete has Karen in his clutches, even killing Karen's friend and fellow teacher, Penny (Deborah Offner).  Michael races home from the jailhouse to find that Pete was stalking Karen.  They fight and the movie ends with Pete being shot and killed by Michael in his home.There are a lot of ironic things that happen during the movie, but I'll let you figure those things out when you watch it.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I highly recommend it for fans of suspense thrillers.  It has a good story, a great setting (Los Angeles) and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Buy it.  You'll love it.",5,"Surprise, surprise.

324197,AEGLF0F0I36QW,6302640407,kcstrawberryblonde,"[0, 0]","Groundbreaking in 1992, shortly after LAPD were caught on video battering Rodney King, and people were forced for the first time to admit that corrupt law officers may turn up anywhere.Very good acting by all three lead characters, and filmed in LA with a lot of gorgeous scenery as a backdrop.Great validation for anyone who has ever been severely abused by a ""law officer"" who is inappropriate for their job and has had to face the reality that if they call the police who are the police going to protect? This film will make you very grateful for all of the pocket-sized recording devices available to U.S. citizens today,but not in 1992, so that it no longer has to be a  citizen's word against a secretly corrupt law officer's.While this film presents with a few holes in the plot: 1.)Near the beginning Kurt Russell comments that,""Almost everyone has some kind of camera recorder connected to their home security system these days,""no explanation is given about why the couple doesn't purchase one of their own, since they just bought a top-of-the line security system,and the entire story is about a law officer stalking and terrorizing them when there aren't any witnesses. 2.)Ray Liotta's fellow law officers are awfully supportive of citizens who want to bring serious charges against one of their own. 3.)During the scene where the psychopathic killer is alone in the house with Madeline Stowe holding her prisoner, at one point she is in a different room and stands directly in front of the control panel of her home security system.No explanation is given of why she didn't simply activate the emergency button.4.)Female viewers may be rolling their eyes at the way Madeline Stowe's character-a woman with a college degree-is portrayed to not be able to defend herself and needs Kurt Russell to keep leaping in to save the day.Nonetheless, anyone who has ever spent time in the presence of a true sociopath who presents themself as an upstanding member of the community when others are around,yet behind closed doors is a should-be felon devoid of any conscience whatsoever-may feel a chill go down their spine as they see the same thing unfold on the screen before them,as Ray Liotta's character nails that persona. However viewers who have experienced the real thing will also be validated from this film.More great insight from 1992, when not nearly so much had been studied and written about sociopaths functioning in mainstream society.Despite a few holes in the story it still manages to be a fast-moving, interesting, psychological thriller, with a dead-on depiction of what a true sociopath can do.",4,Groundbreaking story.

He offers advice and offers the couple (kurt russell and madeline stowe) a top of the line security company for installation for their house. This cop (Liotta) soon becomes even more obsessed with Mrs. Carr (Stowe) and just can't help but show his interest in her. He catches the thief (who broke into their house and put a knife to her throat before bolting,) and Liotta displays a rodney king type brutality to impress Mr. Carr, and basically gives him permission to beat him up. After seeing the look in liotta's eyes after assaulting the thief, he doesn't want anything to do with him. Of course he realizes how hard it is to get rid of him. He starts stalking the couple, first harassment then ripping off their credit cards, messing with computers at the PD so that Mr. Carr is forced to pay unpaid phony parking tickets, and messing up Mr. Carr's business connections.

Such is the case of ""Unlawful Entry"", an interesting and compelling thriller which isn't the best in its genre but it doesn't disappoint either. Michael Carr (Kurt Russell) is in the nightclub development business and is that kind of person who's used to get everything he desires, easily. That's the way he perhaps got his wife, Karen (Madeleine Stowe), who used to work as a waitress in one of Michael's previous clubs and now teaches young kids.Everything was going just nice until one day their house is broken into and the cops who came for the aftermath should never have come there in the first place, for the sake of this young couple. Ray Liotta is perfect for the role of a deranged cop who is obsessed with something's he shouldn't long for. And Russell does a good job of being the man in the middle. Stowe is hot as hell in this movie which perhaps helps the viewer understand Liotta's point of view.The protector turned predator is, like I said before, nothing new on the screen but Liotta can take it to the next level. There are hints of ""Fatal Atraction"" and ""Cape Fear"" sprinkled throughout and I mean that as a compliment, not a complaint. ""Unlawful Entry"" is entertaining, not overlong and I had the feeling of time well spent when I got to the end of it.

324206,A26A8T38C2GQD7,6302640407,Taheen Lopez,"[2, 3]","Unlawful Entry is an awesome suspense flick about a relentless cop who turns things upside down for an honest, innocent hardworking couple in L.A. after one innocent telephone call to the police after being burglarized by a sadistic crack-head.This was probably a movie showing Ray Liotta at his best acting ability, since Ray Liotta plays Los Angeles police Officer Pete Davis who starts out righteous, loyal, and professional like any other typical police officer until Kurt Russell(Michael Carr) decides to disown Pete(Ray Liotta) after seeing Pete's true colors after Michael goes on a ride-along with Pete Davis and his faithful partner Los Angeles police Officer Roy Cole(Roger E. Mosley) discovering what a dangerous psychopath Pete really is.From there on, it becomes quite obvious that Pete is a psycho cop gone crooked who simply keeps going from bad to worse after being disowned by Michael and being infatuated with Michael's wife Karen Carr(Madeline Stowe), especially since Pete goes mad trying to get Michael out of the way and out of the picture even if it means killing people in the process prompting Pete to tarnish Michael's credit, framing Michael with drugs in his house, barging into Michael and Karen's bedroom while Michael & Karen are in the middle of doing hubba hubba along with the fact that Pete even ends up killing his own faithful partner(Roy Cole) in the line of duty in the process to shut him up and to get Cole out of the way after Cole threatens to report Davis if he didn't comply.Therefore, Pete was a practical supercop and slick con-man kind of guy who seemed to know just about every technique and strategy in the book to try to get what he wanted, since a lot of people were hurt and killed in the process.So you could say this suspenseful drama was very similar to the 1990 movie ""Internal Affairs"" with Richard Gere, since Richard Gere plays a psycho cop working for the LAPD too in that action-suspense flick, just like Ray Liotta did in ""Unlawful Entry"" working for LA's finest, which was certainly enough to help tarnish LAPD's reputation in law enforcement like the ""Rodney King Beating"" did back in March of 1991.Therefore, you could say that ""Unlawful Entry"" was almost a carbon copy of ""Internal Affairs"" and Ray Liotta's character in this movie was kind of a carbon copy of Richard Gere's character in ""Internal Affairs"", since Liotta played a dangerous psycho cop who was just as psycho and just as dirty as Gere's character was in ""Internal Affairs"".Additionally, I distinctly recall back in 1993 that Ray Liotta was voted as one of the top movie villians of 1992 for his role in ""Unlawful Entry"", since Ray did his psycho cop Pete Davis role so well in this film along with the fact that it just goes to show you that you simply can't even trust or call the police sometimes either which almost gives you an excuse not to call the police whenever there's a serious crime or an emergency.I also found it quite interesting seeing Roger E. Mosley in this movie after his days on MAGNUM, P.I. as Magnum and Rick's old vietnam buddy(T.C.), since I'd never seen Roger Mosley play a role like this one, especially since I'd never seen Roger Mosley playing any other role in a movie before, but it was neat seeing Roger Mosley without the mustache, which made Roger Mosley look even younger than he did on the detective drama MAGNUM, PI but Roger Mosley obviously had the body for a police officer, since he was already husky during his TC days on MAGNUM.This movie also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those Rodney King riots in LA back in the Spring of 1992 and when we had the recession back in 1992-1993 just before Bill Clinton got elected president in November of 1992 since this suspense flick was released back in the Summer of 1992.Therefore this movie also reminds me of when the California Highway Patrol and the Imperial County Sheriffs Office were in a hiring freeze from 1992 to 1993, due to budget cuts since this was a cop movie that was released in the Summer of '92 when the 1992-1993 recession was at its peak which takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was living in the Imperial Valley since I was living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time when this movie was released in theatres on Friday June 26, 1992.Something else I noticed on this UNLAWFUL ENTRYs DVD theatrical trailer bonus feature was that it showed a lot of previews of scenes that were never even shown in the movies which were probably outtakes, but the theatrical trailer even tells you that this suspense flick was released on Friday June 26th, 1992.",5,PSYCHO COP!,1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,4632,"['Unlawful', 'Entry', 'awesome', 'suspense', 'flick', 'relentless', 'cop', 'who',

324207,A2USTECHX1PKVA,6302640407,"Weedwacker ""I'm a doctor of STEW.""","[2, 2]","I saw the movie Unlawful Entry in the theater when I was a kid and it instantly became and has remained one of my all time favorite thrillers (maybe one of my favorite all time movies period).  Made in 1992 this movie holds up perfectly even after nearly 16 years.Although the basic stalker story had been done a thousand times before, and as many have been done since, few are as satisfying and well done as this one!  And none give me the same chills after seeing them countless times.The plot in a nutshell:  Young, attractive married couple Michael and Karen Carr (Kurt Russell and Madeline Stowe), move into a beautiful house in a nice, upscale neighborhood and shortly thereafter become victims of a break in and minor assault.  They call the cops, which is where the trouble really begins as an intense, handsome cop, Pete Davis (Ray Liotta), falls instantly for Karen and gradually it becomes apparent that he will not be satisfied until she is his.This all sounds familiar, I am sure, but don't let the familiarity of the plot turn you away.  This movie rises above the typical stalker flick with excellently developed characters, complex situations that are not black and white, and absolutely impeccable performances, most notably by Ray Liotta who is downright scary in the role of Pete, the lovestruck cop.  This is probably the most underrated/under-appreciated performance in his impressively rounded career next to his turn in ""Narc.""  If certain moments belonging to Liotta in this film don't send a chill up your spine then maybe you just don't have one!  Kurt Russell also impresses in the ""average guy"" role of Michael.Unlawful Entry is excellently paced, with not a dull moment, and director Jonathan Kaplan packs a whole lot into its hour and forty-seven minutes, making this one of the most satisfying, nail-biting, edge-of-your seat thrillers you're ever bound to watch.  If only every movie succeeded on all levels the way this one does!In addition to great directing, suspense, performances and a solid script, this movie also has great stunts displaying some of the most well done and realistic fight sequences I have ever seen.So, if you like realistic suspense, sordid goings on, creepy but good-looking men, sarcasm, helplessly watching a train wreck (figuratively speaking, of course), and yelling ""no no no!"" at characters who cannot hear you, then watch Unlawful Entry.
