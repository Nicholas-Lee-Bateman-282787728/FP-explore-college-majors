It reminds me more of a storyboard with hand drawn line art being shown as the narrator's read a script. There are parts where it seems animated - such as the picture of a ship as it moves into the sunset - but at best it resembles some of the stories you viewed on Sesame Street as a youngster.Now with that said, the art is terrific. It's interesting and as I said a fun story to read but just as nice to sit and watch. I showed this to some kids in the age range of 7-10 and they loved it. They didn't understand the story line much but they saw it as a 'quest' of sorts. Most of them loved the cats sequences and later enjoyed watching Randolph Carter make his way thru the Dream Lands.If you're a fan of Lovecraftian & Cthulhu Mythos mania, then you'll want to get this DVD.I rated it 4 out of 5 stars due to the fact it is not animation as we truly know it to be. Rather it's an illustrated & narrated story.",4,Fetching but Not Really Animated,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,1011,"['great', 'story', 'fun', 'watch', 'not', 'truly', ""'animated"", 'way', 'cartoons', 'are', 'done', 'more', 'storyboard', 'hand', 'drawn', 'line', 'art', 'being', 'shown', 'narrator', 'read', 'script', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'animated', 'such', 'picture', 'ship', 'sunset', 'best', 'stories', 'viewed', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'youngster.Now', 'said', 'art', 'terrific', 'interesting', 'said', 'fun', 'story', 'read', 'just', 'nice', 'sit', 'watch', 'showed', 'kids', 'age', 'range', '7-10', 'loved', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'story', 'line', 'much', 'saw', ""'quest"", ""'"", 'sorts', 'Most', 'loved', 'cats', 'sequences', 'later', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Randolph', 'Carter', 'make', 'way', 'Dream', 'Lands.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Lovecraftian', 'Cthulhu', 'Mythos', 'mania', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'get', 'DVD.I', 'rated', '4', '5', 'stars', 'due', 'fact', 'not', 'animation', 'truly', 'know', 'be', 'illustrated', 'narrated', 'story']",H.P.

The voice actors are actually very very good.  People who are used to even Saturday morning cartoon animation will be somewhat disappointed with this kind of animation, but really, animation is the only way to do justice to this story.  In my opinion, this is well worth the money, particuarly if you are a real Lovecraft fan.  Guerilla Productions may have a really small budget, but Edward Martin and his cohorts have done a good thing in creating this little very minor masterpiece.

Kolb,"[0, 0]","i would agree with all the reviews, both positive and negative about this dvd.  though there is some animation, it's bascially story-boarded like a comic book.  the artwork is very good and detailed.  mostly b&w with some color.  my issue with the movie is randolph carter's face.  it's drawn very non-descript, much like a smiley face.  all the other characters in the movie are well-drawn.  i know it's dream state and at the end, he wakes up and looks like lovecraft, but the face is too distracting and wish he would of filled it in with detail.  the soundtrack is very good and the voices of the characters are okay at best.  there is a couple of addtional shorts, one being 40 seconds long &#34;call of cathulu&#34; which is pretty silly.  the second, an 8 minute short that was okay.  i liked the grainy picture quality of it.  there are printed material in the dvd box and on bonus materials but i find the font too small and difficult to read.  i do applaud gorilla productions and hope they make more lovecraft inspired movies.",3,ambitious effort,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,1037,"['i', 'would', 'agree', 'reviews', 'positive', 'negative', 'dvd', 'animation', 'bascially', 'story-boarded', 'comic', 'book', 'artwork', 'very', 'good', 'detailed', 'mostly', 'b', 'w', 'color', 'issue', 'movie', 'randolph', 'carter', 'face', 'drawn', 'very', 'non-descript', 'much', 'smiley', 'face', 'other', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'well-drawn', 'i', 'know', 'dream', 'state', 'end', 'up', 'lovecraft', 'face', 'too', 'distracting', 'wish', 'would', 'filled', 'detail', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'good', 'voices', 'characters', 'are', 'okay', 'best', 'couple', 'addtional', 'shorts', 'one', 'being', '40', 'seconds', 'long', '34', 'call', 'cathulu', '34', 'pretty', 'silly', 'second', '8', 'minute', 'short', 'was', 'okay', 'i', 'liked', 'grainy', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'printed', 'material', 'dvd', 'box', 'bonus', 'materials', 'i', 'find', 'font', 'too', 'small', 'difficult', 'read', 'i', 'do', 'gorilla', 'productions', 'hope', 'make', 'more', 'lovecraft', 'inspired', 'movies']",H.P.

If you had a son in High School who showed you art like this, you would compliment him and encourage him, but you wouldn't want to see it turned into a non-moving ""movie"".  I do like the way he draws the ghouls and ghasts, though.I'm not quite sure who the intended audience is for this.  On the one hand, it's H. P. Lovecraft, so you would guess it would be for adults, but on the other hand, there is very little here that parents would have trouble with showing to their kids.  Much (but not all) of the dialogue and narration is in very short, simple sentences, as though it were being dumbed down and kiddified.  I don't know if kids would have the attention span for this, though.The music provides a nice, spacey, creepy (but not too creepy) atmosphere which fits in well with a Lovecraft story more slanted towards fantasy than horror.  I haven't read the book in a while, but from what I remember, the film is very faithful to it.  (One very minor point: In the book, I think Pickman was the only ghoul who could still speak human, and served as a translator.)",2,Disappointing,1299283200,"03 5, 2011",2011,1183,"['deciding', 'buy', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'more', 'attention', 'Nathaniel', 'review', 'mostly', 'agree', 'had', 'son', 'High', 'School', 'who', 'showed', 'art', 'would', 'compliment', 'encourage', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'turned', 'non-moving', 'movie', 'do', 'way', 'ghouls', 'ghasts', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'who', 'intended', 'audience', 'one', 'hand', 'H.', 'P.', 'Lovecraft', 'would', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'adults', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'little', 'here', 'parents', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'showing', 'kids', 'Much', 'not', 'dialogue', 'narration', 'very', 'short', 'simple', 'sentences', 'were', 'being', 'dumbed', 'kiddified', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'though.The', 'music', 'nice', 'spacey', 'creepy', 'not', 'too', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'Lovecraft', 'story', 'more', 'slanted', 'towards', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'while', 'what', 'remember', 'film', 'very', 'faithful', 'One', 'very', 'minor', 'point', 'book', 'think', 'Pickman', 'was', 'only', 'ghoul', 'who', 'could', 'still', 'speak', 'human', 'served', 'translator']",H.P.
