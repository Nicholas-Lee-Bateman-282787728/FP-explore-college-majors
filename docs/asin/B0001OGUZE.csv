812476,A2427EPDGY7AEO,B0001OGUZE,Charles-Eric Langlois,"[6, 6]","I am a REAL fan of Duran Duran. I you are not, do not buy this DVD. Why ? Because it is not a very good live representation of the band. First, this is the period where Simon LeBon, the main singer, had a hard time singing the right note on stage. He was not the best artist (vocally) in those times.Next, the sound mixing is OK, but not gorgeous. Same thing for the picture quality. Extras are for fans only, you will find them boring if you don't know the band pretty much.So now, why 4 stars ? Because the original idea of the movie Arena is great. It is a story in a concert. Weird, but interesting to discover for fans of the band. The life performance is the first one available on DVD since DD joined back together in 2000. It is a great gift for people who waited such a long time for a little something. The setlist is good. All the best hits from those years are there.If you like a bit of DD, and you would like a good live DVD, wait for the new one from this year's tour, including a much better performance, fresh sound, and no weird movie you won't enjoy. Or, get the new Astronaut album with a short live DVD. Or get the greatest videos. Arena is good, if you would like to discover a new face of the band and how they were in those years.",4,"Weird, but good for real fans",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,1254,"['am', 'REAL', 'fan', 'Duran', 'Duran', 'are', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'DVD', 'Why', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'live', 'representation', 'band', 'First', 'period', 'where', 'Simon', 'LeBon', 'main', 'singer', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'singing', 'right', 'note', 'stage', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'artist', 'vocally', 'times.Next', 'sound', 'mixing', 'OK', 'not', 'gorgeous', 'Same', 'thing', 'picture', 'quality', 'Extras', 'are', 'fans', 'only', 'will', 'find', 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'band', 'pretty', 'much.So', 'now', 'why', '4', 'stars', 'original', 'idea', 'movie', 'Arena', 'great', 'story', 'concert', 'Weird', 'interesting', 'discover', 'fans', 'band', 'life', 'performance', 'first', 'one', 'available', 'DVD', 'DD', 'joined', 'back', 'together', '2000', 'great', 'gift', 'people', 'who', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'little', 'something', 'setlist', 'good', 'best', 'hits', 'years', 'are', 'there.If', 'like', 'bit', 'DD', 'would', 'like', 'good', 'live', 'DVD', 'wait', 'new', 'one', 'year', 'tour', 'including', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'fresh', 'sound', 'weird', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'get', 'new', 'Astronaut', 'album', 'short', 'live', 'DVD', 'get', 'greatest', 'videos', 'Arena', 'good', 'would', 'like', 'discover', 'new', 'face', 'band', 'how', 'were', 'years']",N/A

As others have commented, it is very dated, but I suppose it was a cool concept for it's time. The only part I really liked was ""the making of Arena"" portion of the DVD, and even then, I was still fast-forwarding through to see the parts where band members were interviewed.  I think that is it's only saving grace.  There were definitely some ""Spinal Tap"" moments, particularly when Nick was talking about how he constructed his own costume for the Wild Boys video, that really cracked me up.  Otherwise, the acutal Arena video/concert portion was a total drag.  I would have just preferred to see the concert itself without the alien snippet interruptions.It is definitely entertaining to see how young the bandmembers looked back then when they do the behind-the-scenes interviews.

Footage of the group on-stage during their 1984 Seven and the Ragged Tiger tour is interspersed with (and interrupted by) loud, overplayed vignettes of an invading alien force, which results in an effect similar to constant channel-flips between MTV and an episode of The Transformers. The inclusion of Milo O'Shea, reprising his role as the evil Dr. Durand Durand from the film Barbarella (source of the band's name) is a cute nod, but hardly enough to overcome the surrounding trainwreck. Even the band's performance, what little we actually get to see of it, is sub-par, as if we've caught them on the last few dates of a particularly draining tour.

I don't know what the hardcore Duran Duran fan will make of this DVD, but I was very disappointed. I expected this release to be a full, uninterrupted concert of some of their best songs. At least that's what it looks like reading the back of packaging. Instead you get 2/3 music along with stupid vignettes of aliens running around the building. DURING the songs. Not just one song, but every song performed during the concert drops out so we can see rejects from Star Wars running around behind the scenes. I guess the person who directed 'Thriller' decided to bring the production to a live concert. This was very annoying.  You only get one full, uninterrupted track, 'Save A Prayer' in the bonus section of the DVD. Hardly what I would want to pay $30 for. This gets 2 stars for good picture and sound quality.

There's not.  Plus as far as I know, this was the only video from the 1984 ""Seven & the Ragged Tiger"" tour & boy did the band & video producers ever screw up an excellent opportunity to show the band in their prime. Instead of watching the band play their hits or hear interviews, you'll spend most of your time watching people (not in the band) in bizarre outfits, who look like they are in the worst sci-fi movie ever made, constantly appear throughout highly cut up segments of Duran's live show.  They even majorly re-mixed the music tracks so they only slightly resemble the original performances.So unless you are a die-hard fan of all things Duran Duran or majorly weird 80's nostalgia, i'd steer WAY clear of this one & just buy the live ""Arena"" cd from '84 instead.
