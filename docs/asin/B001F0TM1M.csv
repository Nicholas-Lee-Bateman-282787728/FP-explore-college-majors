Just after arriving he learns the company he came to work for was bought out and he was laid off. It is currently Christmas Eve, his wife, who for some reason could not come with the family on the initial move, but was to join them that day, calls to say the flight was overbooked. She got bumped and doesn't know when she will get home. She reminds him to get a tree and presents. So he bribes his two sons, who have really bad attitudes about the move, to come with him to the mall and watch their little sister while he does the shopping.*Spoiler Alert*Here is where things get really crazy. They are at ""The Mall""--the big one, with a wave pool, a pirate ship, ice skating, a myriad other attractions, and, of course, Santa. The little girl insists on seeing him. She wishes for a million dollars for her Dad. Then, while her oldest brother goes off pursuing a girl, she and her other brother happen to have a bag of money land on them--from a couple of bungling crooks. Rather than turning in the money, the kids go on a spending spree, but the money is counterfeit. There are chase scenes, arrests, suspense, magic--everything that would hold a child's attention. But what caught my attention were the multiple incidents of profanity, name calling, crude phrases, kids needing attitude adjustments, portrayal of the RCMP inspector as a bumbling idiot, and a scene in the women's lingerie department discussing a pair of skimpy, sheer, black, women's panties and whether the Dad was buying them for his girlfriend, his wife, or himself.The character that plays Santa shows up as various other characters throughout the movie and at the end he works his magic to bring the family together and give them a happy Christmas.Many people love this and call it a good family movie.
