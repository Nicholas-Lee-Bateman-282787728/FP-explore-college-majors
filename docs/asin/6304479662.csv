If you are down on Elvis to begin with, you'll want the one and two star reviews.  Let's face it, Elvis was one of the greatest talents in the 20th century.  Had the Colonel not controlled him, he would have made the films he wanted, and in fact, he  was a top choice for several top pictures.  Be that as it may, his singing, from rock 'n roll to gospel, is beyond compare.  There are better Elvis films than ""Clambake"" but,  I am personally prejudiced and you may want to read no further unless you like Hollywood stories.One of the dancers in this film, who sparkles in her few scenes, is Angelique Pettyjohn (Gloria).  A Las Vegas native and showgirl, she was best known for the ""classic Star Trek"" episode, ""Gamesters of Triskelion"".  She had the female lead as the beautiful and sensitive Shahna.  (Mispelled on some DVD labels as Shanna.)  Her role made her a most popular guest at conventions, which is how we met her.My wife and I ran media conventions for thirty years and she was our most popular early guest.  We had her as a guest twice, and she stayed over both times to help raise money for scholarships and to visit classrooms.  In my wife's kindergarten class she did face painting since it was close to Halloween.  Much safer for small kids out at night than masks.  She also visited my high school classes and conducted drama workshops.In one class she particularly talked about ""Clambake"".  Elvis was very down to Earth and just what every fan believes or wants to believe.  One time he came over to her and a couple other dancers and asked if they minded if he tried out a new song.  Naturally they were thrilled and he serenaded them.  Afterward he asked their opinions.Toward the end of her short life, Angelique was a ringmaster for ""Circus Circus"" in Las Vegas.  She died of cancer and left much memorabilia to us to sell for the scholarship programs she supported.  I talked with her by phone, one of the last nights of her life.  We live in Virginia and couldn't be with her.  She wanted us to know that she had given her life to Jesus Christ and was ready to go.  This lady was a blessing to all of us.If you really didn't like reading all of the above, remember, you were warned.  I just want to say that this DVD is worth owning for Angelique alone.",5,Don't read this if you don't want a personal story about one of the cast.

It's obvious that he didn't want to be there, but in some scenes he &quot;faked&quot; it real well.The thing I have noticed about Elvis' movies in 1966 and 1967 is his weight. His face appeared slightly bloated, and his waistline was just a little bigger than normal, just enough you could tell it. By 1968, though, he trimmed up and geared up for his comeback special.Clambake, though, doesn't deserve all the bad rap it gets. The story line has an interesting twist with Elvis, the son of a millionaire oilman, switching places with a ski instructor to see if someone could love him as a person and not as a bankroll.Another plus is Shelley Fabares. She is absolutely gorgeous in this movie! Even prettier than she was in Girl Happy.Throw in solid performances by Bill Bixby and James Gregory, have some pretty dancing girls on the beach and the boat race at the end, and Clambake is a solid effort.

424474,A240QB45BSMDAN,6304479662,Josh P.,"[4, 4]","""Clambake"" was a film that Elvis had total disinterest in doing. Actually, this film is fun to watch and every Elvis fan should take the time to watch it. Probably the only reason was that the ever-lasting chain of musical comedies was getting tiresome and old. Bill Bixby is Elvis' rival. Elvis delivers him with a sucker punch and Bixby is out cold. Elvis is an unhappy-with-money millionaire's son who switches places with Will Hutchins, a poor water-skiing instructor. Elvis takes interest in third-time Elvis costar Shelley Fabares.

424476,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6304479662,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","Although it has the worst title of any Elvis movie, ""Clambake"" (1967) is actually one of his better films. Which is surprising as it is one of his last and generally speaking each film seemed a bit worse than its predecessor. ""Clambake's"" salvation is certainly not in the soundtrack which is at best very ordinary, only the title song has any energy. Although there is an actual clambake scene on the beach about midway into the film, it seems thrown in just to justify the title, more impressive is a cameo of ""Flipper"" who had his own television show at that time.I'm inclined to credit Shelley Fabares for the good vibe I got from this film. She plays ""golddigger with a heart of gold"" Dianne Carter, Elvis' ultimate love interest. I never cared for her uptight Mary Stone character on reruns of ""The Donna Reed Show"", and therefore paid almost no attention to her until recently. But since seeing her in ""Ride the Wild Surf"" and ""Clambake"" I've had a major attitude adjustment. ""Clambake"" was the third time she was tapped for the love interest role in an Elvis film so obviously she and the King had grown comfortable working together.Their romance is a little different than the Elvis standard. In ""Clambake"" she does not start out hating or ignoring him. Instead they quickly become friends and she is obviously attracted, but she puts the brakes on any romance because she is hunting for a rich husband and has tycoon J.J. Jamison (Bill Bixby) squarely in her sights. She comes around in the end and their chemistry actually feels real, much like it did with Ann Margret in ""Viva Las Vegas"".The comfort factor is also apparent between Elvis and Will Hutchins, his real-life buddy. Oil tycoon Scott (Elvis) pulls a ""Prince and the Pauper"" and swaps places with drifter Tom Wilson (Hutchins). He wants to find someone who loves him for himself. Hutchins is supposed to provide the film's main comic relief as he enjoys the life of the rich and famous, driving Scott's ""Munsters"" inspired convertible and surrounding himself with gorgeous women who can't dance very well. Although the director had Hutchins overplay the part it is so poorly written that they can't squeeze many laughs out of the premise. But having most of his scenes with Fabares and Hutchins seems to have relaxed Elvis considerably, which makes both he and his film more likable.Contrary to most, I enjoyed the corny playground scene with the little girl who was afraid of the slide. The ""Confidence"" song is not a rip off of ""High Hopes"", the whole scene is a variation on the ""Bounce Right Back"" number Donald O'Connor did in ""Anything Goes"". While ""Confidence"" is not much of a song, this surreal scene is priceless. I wonder what long-time fans thought as they watched Elvis and Hutchins do something so totally ""Guffman""?
