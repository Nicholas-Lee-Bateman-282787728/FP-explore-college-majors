This film is really funny, especially if you ever took a creative writing class or tried to make a film. The source of the comedy if very uncomfortable humor. It is black humor. The first part is like a litany of intense pain, where you can only laugh or be repulsed. The film lets you off the hook in the second part. It seems much like the recent Sideways movie, which has a shared sense of dark humor. But it is a different time and a movie like Sideways has benefitted from the example of Storytelling.

It opens with Slema Blair's rather unclothed upper torso flying--later we see her in what can only really be taken as a rape scene, which is nicely disorted in the fullbody shots by a large orange rectangle (doesn't get rid of the sound or the very on purpose un-p.c. language) and then the psychedellic sex scene--which is implied between two boys, which is also almost another rape.This movie also features the most evil little boy I have had to witness in a long time, some perversion of the child outwitting the grownups cliche that hollywood is fond of using (aka Home Alone).I rather wish I could get a refund or take back having ever rented this.",1,"The pain--disgusting, dirty pain",1103241600,"12 17, 2004",2004,1091,"['rented', 'movie', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'other', 'liked', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'John', 'Goodman', 'was', 'comedy', 'section', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'laughed', 'once', 'movie.Film', 'quality', 'was', 'low', 'was', ""n't"", 'soundtrack', 'could', 'remember', 'maybe', 'psychedellic', 'sex', 'scene', 'acting', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'point', 'movie', 'seemed', 'bent', 'squeezing', 'most', 'akward', 'sex', 'moments', 'MOST', 'akward', 'disturbing', 'Slema', 'Blair', 'rather', 'unclothed', 'upper', 'torso', 'flying', 'later', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'really', 'be', 'taken', 'rape', 'scene', 'nicely', 'disorted', 'fullbody', 'shots', 'large', 'orange', 'rectangle', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'sound', 'very', 'purpose', 'un-p.c', 'language', 'then', 'psychedellic', 'sex', 'scene', 'implied', 'two', 'boys', 'also', 'almost', 'rape.This', 'movie', 'also', 'most', 'evil', 'little', 'boy', 'have', 'had', 'witness', 'long', 'time', 'perversion', 'child', 'outwitting', 'grownups', 'cliche', 'hollywood', 'fond', 'using', 'aka', 'Home', 'Alone', '.I', 'rather', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'refund', 'take', 'back', 'having', 'ever', 'rented']",N/A

587335,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JKJF,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[2, 6]","***CONTAINS SPOILERS***It's probably fun to make a movie about yourself -- or one that focuses closely on you -- and that is what director Solondz has done with STORYTELLING. Not only is the film divided into two nearly unintelligible segments, it is further broken down during the final section by portraying a down-on-his luck director (Paul Giamatti, THE ILLUSIONIST) who is obviously a doppelganger of Solondz himself.Overflowing with apathy, Storytelling has two distinct parts: ""fiction"" and ""nonfiction."" In fiction, which launches the film, we're introduced to Vi (Selma Blair, HELLBOY), a young New Jersey college student involved in a writing/literature class that concentrates on critique. Her boyfriend Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, THE WIRE TV series) has cerebral palsy and it appears the only reason she's with him is because of her apathy toward college life and those that haunt its halls. The teacher of the class is a forbidding black man named Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom, also from THE WIRE), a Pulitzer Prize winner who's flat affect and bored demeanor heaves a heavy shadow over the class. But apathy attracts apathy in Solondz story, so Vi and Mr. Scott have a sexual encounter, if for no other reason than to slip out of their routines and into one another. There's actually some interesting dark sexual comedy here, but it quickly dissolves.Perhaps ""fiction"" was part nonfiction, too, as one could easily see Solondz sitting in a class, reading stories that get sledgehammer critiques.The second and final portion of Storytelling is ""nonfiction."" Here we find Toby Oxman (Giamatti), a man who can't seem to finish anything. But when he discovers a young kid named Scooby (Mark Webber, THE MEMORY THIEF) who mirrors Toby's own apathy toward life, the wannabe film maker believes he's found a new calling: to make a documentary about society. John Goodman (O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) stars as Scooby's father, a big man that pushes his kids and family too hard to become his ideal nuclear family. His wife Fern (July Hagerty, AIRPLANE) is just as disinterested in life as the rest of the cast, but hides it behind a facade of smiles. The only empathetic character in the Webber household is the maid Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros, TORTILLA HEAVEN) who gets fired because she shows some interest in life. Toby Oxman films all of the Webber household people but keeps his focus on Scooby, whom he sees strictly as a character subject.That the film ends abruptly with the death of Scooby's family, and we still see no emotional response from him, only adds to the viewer's anger that there's no one in the film to care about. No protagonist that we can get behind. No angst from any of the characters. They are blobs of human flesh pooling around each other in uninteresting ways.Directing a movie about apathy has been done before; AMERICAN BEAUTY is probably the most notable of these. But the characters were multifaceted and you cared about them. Here in Storytelling, the premise seems to be filming a flick about apathy just for the sake of showing apathy.",2,Apathy For The Sake Of Apathy,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,3071,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***It', 'probably', 'fun', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'closely', 'what', 'director', 'Solondz', 'done', 'STORYTELLING', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'nearly', 'unintelligible', 'segments', 'further', 'broken', 'down', 'final', 'section', 'portraying', 'down-on-his', 'luck', 'director', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'THE', 'ILLUSIONIST', 'who', 'obviously', 'doppelganger', 'Solondz', 'himself.Overflowing', 'apathy', 'Storytelling', 'two', 'distinct', 'parts', 'fiction', 'nonfiction', 'fiction', 'film', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Vi', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'HELLBOY', 'young', 'New', 'Jersey', 'college', 'student', 'involved', 'writing/literature', 'class', 'critique', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'THE', 'WIRE', 'TV', 'series', 'cerebral', 'palsy', 'only', 'reason', 'apathy', 'college', 'life', 'haunt', 'halls', 'teacher', 'class', 'forbidding', 'black', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'also', 'THE', 'WIRE', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'who', 'flat', 'affect', 'bored', 'demeanor', 'heavy', 'shadow', 'class', 'apathy', 'attracts', 'apathy', 'Solondz', 'story', 'Vi', 'Mr.', 'Scott', 'have', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'other', 'reason', 'slip', 'routines', 'one', 'actually', 'interesting', 'dark', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'here', 'quickly', 'fiction', 'was', 'part', 'nonfiction', 'too', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'Solondz', 'sitting', 'class', 'reading', 'stories', 'get', 'sledgehammer', 'critiques.The', 'second', 'final', 'portion', 'Storytelling', 'nonfiction', 'Here', 'find', 'Toby', 'Oxman', 'Giamatti', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'finish', 'anything', 'when', 'young', 'kid', 'named', 'Scooby', 'Mark', 'Webber', 'THE', 'MEMORY', 'THIEF', 'who', 'mirrors', 'Toby', 'own', 'apathy', 'life', 'wannabe', 'film', 'maker', 'found', 'new', 'calling', 'make', 'documentary', 'society', 'John', 'Goodman', 'O', 'BROTHER', 'WHERE', 'ART', 'THOU', 'Scooby', 'father', 'big', 'man', 'kids', 'family', 'too', 'hard', 'become', 'ideal', 'nuclear', 'family', 'wife', 'Fern', 'July', 'Hagerty', 'AIRPLANE', 'just', 'as', 'disinterested', 'life', 'rest', 'cast', 'facade', 'smiles', 'only', 'empathetic', 'character', 'Webber', 'household', 'maid', 'Consuelo', 'Lupe', 'Ontiveros', 'TORTILLA', 'HEAVEN', 'who', 'fired', 'interest', 'life', 'Toby', 'Oxman', 'Webber', 'household', 'people', 'focus', 'Scooby', 'whom', 'strictly', 'character', 'film', 'abruptly', 'death', 'Scooby', 'family', 'still', 'see', 'emotional', 'response', 'only', 'viewer', 'anger', 'one', 'film', 'care', 'protagonist', 'can', 'get', 'angst', 'characters', 'are', 'blobs', 'human', 'flesh', 'pooling', 'other', 'uninteresting', 'ways.Directing', 'movie', 'apathy', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'AMERICAN', 'BEAUTY', 'probably', 'most', 'notable', 'characters', 'were', 'multifaceted', 'cared', 'Here', 'Storytelling', 'premise', 'be', 'filming', 'flick', 'apathy', 'just', 'sake', 'showing', 'apathy']",N/A
587336,A3LPD7NTGFH7V4,B00005JKJF,bowery boy,"[6, 6]","Storytelling is a typical Todd Solondz fare. Solondz is incredibly deft at placing an unflinching eye on the dark, disturbing undercurrents of everyday life that we all experience yet only discuss in therapy sessions. Humor in disturbing situations; misfits, outcasts and misunderstood individuals and a keen, satirical sense of suburban life abound throughout as in every Solondz film.  However, if you're expecting 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' or 'Happiness' then Storytelling will disappoint.  It falls short at reaching the highs of past films, yet still maintains that familiar edge.Storytelling's only problem is its sense of balance.  Divided into two parts, Fiction and NonFiction, the Fiction half lasts about 20 minutes.  A strange story of a girl who has a humiliating sexual encounter with her Black creative writing teacher that she later writes about.  The NonFiction half lasts well over an hour, a tense account of the ""perfect"" suburban family slowly and tragically disintegrating in front a documentary camera crew.The balance should have been attained through either a sense of continuity between the stories or, as another reviewer mentioned, at least one or two more vignettes.  When the credits rolled I felt disappointed that there wasn't at least one more tale to tell.  In in any case, Storytelling is Solondz in top form.

587337,AN8K6OR4NKI0V,B00005JKJF,Bruno,"[4, 4]","Storytelling is another highly enjoyable, if typically disturbing work from the New York director Todd Solondz.  His films, from his first breakthrough `Welcome to the Dollhouse' to the recent `Palindromes', have all been thoughtful and controversial dark comedies.  In my view, the comedic moments have become a little scarcer and less funny in his last two films (this one and Pallindromes), but the philosophical ruminations have been taken to another level.  Here, as in Pallindromes, the director explores in a highly original way, the seemingly inescapable but ultimately cruel and futile need of individuals to impose artificial narrative structure on the lives of themselves and others.  As the abusive black tutor in the first of the film's two `stories' puts it : `Our stories run better when they have a beginning, a middle and an end, but as soon as we try to frame them in words and meanings we must admit that they become fiction'.Solondz's world is a dark one, a world in which all human relationships are abusive Sartrean power struggles, where even our very identities are attempts to fix `the other' into a false straitjacket in order to increase our own power to define and control the world.  These battles are fought often enough through primitive means of physical or sexual abuse, but they are always ultimately decided by the more sophisticated armouries of words, labels and meanings.  His films provoke and unsettle above all because he refuses to fix himself to any one moral interpretation or `camp', right or left, and even dares to challenge the left's sanctity of the victim/abuser relationship.  Solondz has been criticised for raising the unspeakably ugly head of paedophilia above the dinner party discussion table yet here he explores the female `converse' of negrophilia in a similarly stark and honest manner.  The black male tutor at the creative writing school has a penchant for sexually degrading his young white female students.  We are shown, however, that he is only in a position to exploit his perversion because those same women (like all the white females in the school) sexually objectify and fetishise a racist and harmful stereotype of the Afro-american male as a violent brute with a huge penis.  That the holding back of the black American male in contemporary society is no longer the result of the evil racism of the white American male, but in fact lies now more in the grotesque sexual appetites and fetishes of American women is a typically bitter pill for the left leaning cinema goer to be asked to swallow.  But for this hugely talented film director, nothing should be black and white and any attempt to pretend otherwise is mere storytelling.",5,Different and disturbing,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2705,"['Storytelling', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'typically', 'disturbing', 'work', 'New', 'York', 'director', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'films', 'first', 'breakthrough', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'recent', 'Palindromes', 'have', 'been', 'thoughtful', 'controversial', 'dark', 'comedies', 'view', 'comedic', 'moments', 'have', 'become', 'little', 'scarcer', 'less', 'funny', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'Pallindromes', 'philosophical', 'ruminations', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'level', 'Here', 'Pallindromes', 'director', 'highly', 'original', 'way', 'seemingly', 'inescapable', 'ultimately', 'cruel', 'futile', 'need', 'individuals', 'impose', 'artificial', 'narrative', 'structure', 'lives', 'others', 'abusive', 'black', 'tutor', 'first', 'film', 'two', 'stories', 'stories', 'run', 'better', 'when', 'have', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'as', 'soon', 'try', 'frame', 'words', 'meanings', 'must', 'admit', 'become', ""fiction'.Solondz"", 'world', 'dark', 'one', 'world', 'human', 'relationships', 'are', 'abusive', 'Sartrean', 'power', 'struggles', 'where', 'even', 'very', 'identities', 'are', 'attempts', 'fix', 'other', 'false', 'straitjacket', 'order', 'increase', 'own', 'power', 'define', 'control', 'world', 'battles', 'are', 'fought', 'often', 'enough', 'primitive', 'means', 'physical', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'are', 'always', 'ultimately', 'decided', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'armouries', 'words', 'labels', 'meanings', 'films', 'provoke', 'unsettle', 'fix', 'one', 'moral', 'interpretation', 'camp', 'right', 'left', 'even', 'dares', 'challenge', 'left', 'sanctity', 'victim/abuser', 'relationship', 'Solondz', 'been', 'criticised', 'raising', 'unspeakably', 'ugly', 'head', 'paedophilia', 'dinner', 'party', 'discussion', 'table', 'yet', 'here', 'female', 'converse', 'negrophilia', 'similarly', 'stark', 'honest', 'manner', 'black', 'male', 'tutor', 'creative', 'writing', 'school', 'penchant', 'sexually', 'degrading', 'young', 'white', 'female', 'students', 'are', 'shown', 'however', 'only', 'position', 'exploit', 'perversion', 'same', 'women', 'white', 'females', 'school', 'sexually', 'objectify', 'fetishise', 'racist', 'harmful', 'stereotype', 'Afro-american', 'male', 'violent', 'brute', 'huge', 'penis', 'holding', 'back', 'black', 'American', 'male', 'contemporary', 'society', 'no', 'longer', 'result', 'evil', 'racism', 'white', 'American', 'male', 'fact', 'lies', 'now', 'more', 'grotesque', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'fetishes', 'American', 'women', 'typically', 'bitter', 'pill', 'left', 'leaning', 'cinema', 'goer', 'be', 'asked', 'swallow', 'hugely', 'talented', 'film', 'director', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'black', 'white', 'attempt', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'mere', 'storytelling']",N/A

587339,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,B00005JKJF,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[1, 4]","by Dane YoussefThis is yet another ""daring and provocative"" little ""taboo-breaking film"" from writer/director Todd Solondz (""Welcome To The Dollhouse,"" ""Happiness,"" ""Fear, Anxiety & Depression,"" Schatt's Last Shot""), so anyone who picks t his one up should know what to expect. In fact, dollars to diamonds, you wouldn't even think about picking this one up unless you were a fan.Like fellow contraversal filmmaker Neil LaBute, he likes to shed a great deal of light on the uglier, loathsome, unsavory side of humanity. Is he trying to illuminate us all by showing us the dark matter of our society? How our cold and evil nature may be our downfall? And all the damage it's doing? Or is Solondz more infactuated by these all-too realistic monsters and villains he puts up there on the screen?Is this weird little man enamored by his loathsome creations? Is he celebrating this callous side of the human race or satirizing it? Normally, he leaves that to us, but althroughout ""Storytelling,"" he seems to be trying to set the record straight.For those who saw his heavily acclaimed (by critics and audiences alike) ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"" a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high school.I was not one of the film's many admirers.Yes, I felt like just about everybody else that the film did have some poginant truths, but... I pretty much already knew them all. It all felt kinda redundant. I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, ""Yeah, no s-- t"" and ""God, these people are a------s and idiots.""I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before. Solondz was preaching to the wrong choir there.His next fim, ""Happiness"" about three sisters and their lives... and how adulthood is more or less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school. About three sisters and how their lives aren't as well-adjusted as they seem. The seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry, secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene phone caller calls her... she starts stalking him.The best line in the movie ""Happiness""... that almost encapsulates the entire film:Helen Jordan: ""I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.""Joy Jordan: ""But I'm not laughing.""The film is about two different forms of storytelling: Two seperate chapters, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-Fiction.""""Fiction"" is a surprisingly short one. It's about the creative writing process, and it takes place in a creative writing class. Many of the main characters are all writing short stories, most of which are autobiographical.A woman who has writing aspirations and her cerebal-palsy girlfriend with the same. Her name is Vi, and she breaks up with her boyfriend after his obviously autobiographical story is panned horribly by the school teacher who dismisses it first very crudely and then gets more elaborate.He especially takes some kind of pleasure in attacking the title: ""The Rawness of Truth.""It's the kind of story that leaves you thinking, ""Wow, is that in dire need of a rewrite.""Pretty much the whole class warms up to it... except for the star pupil/teacher's pet... and the teacher himself, a Pulitzer-Prize winning author of a novel entitled, ""A Sunday Lynching.""Marcus (Vi's boyfriend) is furious with her for not giving it to him straight. Marcus' ""Rawness"" is about how Vi gave him confidence and made him feel, as he puts it in his story... ""completely cerebal.""Vi, stricken, gets hammered, lights up and...The professor has a poetic line about the writing process that rings incredibly true: ""Whenever you write... it all becomes fiction.""After the first story (""Fiction"") in the film ends, you can't get but the feeling that although something horrible and tragic has happened, perhaps it was nessicary. And after they take it all in, let in all sink in, lick their wounds, let some time pass... maybe they'll be ready to take the next step.""Non-Fiction"" is about most likely Solondz experience as director and the whole documentary experience. Often at times, those documentarians seem to be roasting and attacking their subjects with great anger and fury... but are they just trying to get heat for their film... or is that how they really see it?Who knows? Many artists are former victims, grown children with bad experiences and hell-bent on vengeance. ""Non-Fiction"" revolves around the exploits of a documentarian filmmaker and his desire to make a documentary about teenagers and what they're feeling now.Have things changed much? Drugs... suicidal feelings... self-loathing... loathing of the world around them... of the way society treats them, pressures them, conforms them and disposes of them... how do teenagers put up with it? What's ahead? Mark Webber is Scooby Livingston, a depressed and moody teenager who's completely lost and like many teenagers, his all-purpose requests to every queston is ""I don't know,"" ""I really don't care"" and ""Whatever.""He always seems deep in thought and in need of answers. He has big goal aspirations... but no idea whatsoever as how to attain them. When asked how he plans to attain his dreams of stardom, he answers: ""I don't know, see if I have any connections... whatever..."" After a meet-strange with a documentarian named Toby, both seem to think the other may be exactly what they're looking for and maybe their seemingly unobtainable dreams might have a chance of coming true after all.The family is not enthusiastic about the whole thing... especially the father who doesn't want the family's dirty laundry to be aired out. But after some hard questions and earnest promises, he agrees.No family wants to be exploited... and this family certainly would provide more than enough of such material. I think the boy represents Solondz as a young teenager (Solondz himself is also a vegetarian) and of course, Giamatti as Toby is Solondz as a filmmaker (Solondz dresses up Giamatti to look exactly like him).There's pressure all around from every angle and sadly, no way out in sight. College doesn't sound appealing and there has to be a place for Scooby. Since Scooby grew up to be Solondz himself (we can only assume), there must be hope.But I think Scooby represents all teenagers. He reflects not our generation, but that paticular case, that type. That unfortunate type.God, how many teens are there out there EXACTLY like Scooby? Actually, I think he represents the teens who are more depressed, desolate and lost. The ones who are always feeling lost... swimming against the tides, always feeling trapped with a feeling of hopelessness.If you've ever seen a Solondz movie, you really do know what to expect.Like all of his other efforts, this is about how ugliness and unsettling rage lives in middle class suburbia. You can't watch this movie, see and hear some of these people and not think of someone you know or have met or seen randomly on the street.Solondz is from Suburbia, New Jersey and is talking about what's going on there.I like how he talks about things that most movies and people in real life shy away from. He wants to critisize, satirize and get you to ask yourself...""How many people are really like this? And... is there hope for us? How many of these people exist... and more importantly, are they in our neghiborhood?

587340,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B00005JKJF,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[2, 2]","""Storytelling"" is not one film, but two. They are both different, but very related. The first story is called ""Fiction"" and it stars Selma Blair, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Robert Wisdom. Selma Blair stars as Vi, a collage student who is taking a writing course with her boyfriend Marcus, who has celebral palsy. The class is taught by Pulitzer-Prize winning author Gary Scott. When Marcus's story is comments badly by Gary, he becomes nervous that Vi is interested in Gary when she does not stand up to him during the class. They break up, but when Vi goes to a bar she meets Gary, and she learns something about him, and her life is changed.The second and longer story is called ""Nonfiction"" and it stars Paul Giamatti, who already amazed me this year with ""American Splendor"" and he gives another great preformance as Tobey Oxford, a documentary filmmaker who is doing a documentary about high school students, and how it is hard to get into the collage of your choice. He finds his focus in Scooby Livingston, who is a student who does not want to go to collage, and is a slacker who has no idea what he wants to do in the future. That makes his parents, Marty and Fern, ticked off at him, and also their middle child Brady to the suspection that he is gay. Their youngest son Mike, is ten years old, and is complety spoiled, and also interested in their live in maid Consuelo's life and family history. As Tobey shoots the documentary, the family deals with problems that arise, untill finally ""Nonfiction"" and the movie comes to a surprising and bitter end.The end of ""Nonfiction"" surprised me. I did not see anything like that coming. It also made me think that I should have seen it coming. I was decieved. What I liked about the movie was how the two stories were related to each other. They were both about high school life, and the problems that teenagers face. They were also totally unrelated, because they both focus on the different types of storytelling. The documentary being the nonfiction. The short stories being the fiction. I thought that ""Storytelling"" was a very funny, and very brilliant film. It was short and sweet. I liked the scene where Mike spills some juice, finds the maid crying about how one of her family members has been excuted for rape and murder, and then kindly asks her to clean it up for it. It is a character study, because it shows how spoiled this family is, and how they have everything done for them. Throughout the film, except for Mike, they don't even notice that she is around.""Storytelling"" deals with another major subject of racism, so it is not for everyone. In ""Fiction"" Gary Scott's character is black, and in Vi's final story, with a black character like him in it, everybody in the class has a comment to say about how it is a black man. I feel that this shows how just because something happens to somebody else, and a black man is the cause of it, it is racism. It's a sad, but true fact. ""Storytelling"" was a great movie, and it is not a film for everybody, but those with an open mind will enjoy it.ENJOY!Rated R for strong sexual content, language and some drug use.",5,Stories Worth Telling!,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,3125,"['Storytelling', 'not', 'one', 'film', 'two', 'are', 'different', 'very', 'related', 'first', 'story', 'called', 'Fiction', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'Robert', 'Wisdom', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Vi', 'collage', 'student', 'who', 'taking', 'writing', 'course', 'boyfriend', 'Marcus', 'who', 'celebral', 'palsy', 'class', 'taught', 'Pulitzer-Prize', 'winning', 'author', 'Gary', 'Scott', 'When', 'Marcus', 'story', 'comments', 'badly', 'Gary', 'nervous', 'Vi', 'interested', 'Gary', 'when', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'class', 'break', 'up', 'when', 'Vi', 'bar', 'Gary', 'something', 'life', 'changed.The', 'second', 'longer', 'story', 'called', 'Nonfiction', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'already', 'amazed', 'year', 'American', 'Splendor', 'great', 'preformance', 'Tobey', 'Oxford', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'doing', 'documentary', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'how', 'hard', 'get', 'collage', 'choice', 'focus', 'Scooby', 'Livingston', 'who', 'student', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'collage', 'slacker', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'future', 'parents', 'Marty', 'Fern', 'ticked', 'off', 'also', 'middle', 'child', 'Brady', 'suspection', 'gay', 'youngest', 'son', 'Mike', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'complety', 'spoiled', 'also', 'interested', 'live', 'maid', 'Consuelo', 'life', 'family', 'history', 'Tobey', 'shoots', 'documentary', 'family', 'deals', 'problems', 'arise', 'untill', 'finally', 'Nonfiction', 'movie', 'surprising', 'bitter', 'end.The', 'end', 'Nonfiction', 'surprised', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'coming', 'also', 'made', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'was', 'decieved', 'What', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'two', 'stories', 'were', 'related', 'other', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'problems', 'teenagers', 'face', 'were', 'also', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'focus', 'different', 'types', 'storytelling', 'documentary', 'being', 'nonfiction', 'short', 'stories', 'being', 'fiction', 'thought', 'Storytelling', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'short', 'sweet', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Mike', 'juice', 'maid', 'crying', 'how', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'been', 'excuted', 'rape', 'murder', 'then', 'kindly', 'clean', 'up', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'spoiled', 'family', 'how', 'have', 'everything', 'done', 'film', 'Mike', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'around', 'Storytelling', 'deals', 'major', 'subject', 'racism', 'not', 'everyone', 'Fiction', 'Gary', 'Scott', 'character', 'black', 'Vi', 'final', 'story', 'black', 'character', 'everybody', 'class', 'comment', 'say', 'how', 'black', 'man', 'feel', 'how', 'just', 'something', 'happens', 'somebody', 'else', 'black', 'man', 'cause', 'racism', 'sad', 'true', 'fact', 'Storytelling', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'film', 'everybody', 'open', 'mind', 'will', 'enjoy', 'it.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'drug', 'use']",N/A

That is, after all, what Hollywood spoonfeeds us 90% of the time---not only the cheesey action blockbusters but also the alleged ""dramas"" and ""comedies"" too...it's all been focus-grouped to death before the final cut.  Make that focused-grouped to death before the contract to produce the film is even signed.So it is no wonder that many people have a problem with a movie like this.  It's basically one short, about a creative writing class, its freaky and mediocre students, its freaky and sadistic teacher who may or may not be another mediocre writer.  As a veteran of many collegiate creative writing classes, I can attest that there are quite a few grains of truth here.The longer second film is about a typically dysfunctional upper-middle class suburbian family headed by the venerable John Goodman, complete with exploited Latin American maid.  Again, just like the vision of suburbia in his earlier film ""Happiness,"" this one definitely rang more than its fair share of bells.There really are no ""good"" characters---everyone is dysfunctional in their own ways, some more grotesquely than others.  That's one of the most beautifully refreshing things about Solondz's work: he never cops out and inserts some easy-to-root-for lollipop characters but instead challenges us to work hard to infer some redeeming qualities in all of them, and makes us acutely aware of the difficulty of that work.Yes Solondz's is a brutally dark and merciless vision of life and people in general, but I'd argue that it is a largely accurate one...if we are willing to strip away our comforting habitual delusions/cliches and see the spades for the spades that they all are.  The only really obvious flight of fancy here is the Latin maid's revenge at the end, which I gather is more of a fantasy sequence than anything else, or perhaps prophetic and allegorical.And Solondz never fails to infuse his films with plenty of jet-black humor, spontaneity and originality.  You never feel as if he's beating you over the head with The Message (calling Steven Spielberg and Spike Lee!), or taking the easy way out, or copping out and dumbing things down for easier consumption by a wider audience.In light of the films that are usually made, ""Storytelling"" (along with his other film, ""Happiness"") is nothing short of miraculous.

Forget ""American Beauty"", since ""Storytelling"" goes further down the spiral. The movie contains two distinct segments, the first, ""Fiction"", and the second, ""Non-Fiction"". In the first, a writing student gets involved with her teacher and that experience will determine her vision of the world and her writing process, leading to a complex, tense discussion. In ""Non-Fiction"", Solondz makes an insight into the ""typical"" american family, presenting some dysfunctional characters who struggle to somehow survive in a bitter, convulted world. The director also reflects on the effects of the showbiz industry and its relevance in a society full of lonely and depressed individuals. Sarcasm and irony are a constant here, used to maximum effect to describe the growing process of a young slacker who tries to find something worth caring about but ends up failing again and again.Although it`s not perfect, ""Storytelling"" is nonetheless a powerful movie that gives much food for thought and again shows the strenght of one of the most original voices of american indie cinema.

They always seem very arch and self-consciously clever, and forget to actually involve you in the characters you're watching.As described below, 'Storytelling' consists of two shorts, one labeled 'fiction', the other 'non-fiction'. Ironies abound here. It's often said of literature that all fiction is unintentionally truthful, while non-fiction is filled with lies. James Frey is an embarrassing example of that phenomenon. Similarly, the 'non-fiction' short has a much more fantastical plot line than 'fiction' does. The 'fiction' short revolves around a college-level creative writing course, while 'non-fiction' shows a schlub (clear stand-in for Solondz) making a documentary about... something, if he can just figure out what that is.This movie appears to be a direct response to criticisms of Solondz's earlier works. The song played as the credits roll asks pointedly what the audience expects of the story teller, what responsibility he has to them, and to his characters. 'Fiction' seems to address the first part of that question. One character asks the main character, 'Vi' why she must write about such ugly characters. Vi plaintively responds that she's writing about things that have really happened to her. For the millions who ask Solondz, or any other artist, why their creations are so insistently nasty, this appears to be the answer: because this is how Solondz experiences the world. I'm grateful that I only have to visit his world for an hour or two every few years. I wouldn't be able to bear much more. Of course, while we sympathize with Vi as she insists on the truth of her experience, at the same time, wink wink, we know she's a fictional character. How gratingly clever.'Non-fiction' addresses the relationship between an author (or documentarian) and his subject. Paul Giamatti plays a schlub who is even more helpless than usual. He can't settle on a topic to shape all the footage he's taken of a particularly insipid teenager. He ultimately decides to go for some cheap laughs at the family's expense, rather than focus on the terrible tragedies that occurred during filming. So we, the audience, see a fictional audience jeering at this hapless teenager, and are reminded that we were laughing at him too just an hour ago. Wink, wink, see how clever and intertwined it all is?Ultimately, I can't give this movie high marks because I was not invested in any of the characters. I appreciate Solondz and his willingness to break taboos, but there needs to be more there for a really great movie. For the record, 'Welcome To the Dollhouse' is one of my all-time favorites. Solondz's nihilism and despair seemed appropriate to that film, because teenagers lack adult perspective. It seems more jarring to me in a film like 'Storytelling' or 'Happiness'. Another reviewer expressed doubts that Solondz knows the first thing about sexual tensions between white women and black men, and I'm inclined to agree. I felt the same way about 'Happiness' - as I watched it, I asked myself, does Solodnz really know anything this topic, or is he simply trying to make our heads explode by portraying a sympathetic pedophile? I could be wrong, but it felt like the second to me. My (limited) understanding of pedophile psychology is that a pedophile would not recognize that it's wrong to molest children, or to draw a distinction between his son and other boys. Again, maybe I'm wrong - but I found 'Happiness' unconvincing.To sum up: interesting, reliably shocking, pretty much what you'd expect from this director. I found it interesting, even illuminating, but not at all moving.",3,Too meta,1262563200,"01 4, 2010",2010,3727,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'movies', 'Adaptation', 'being', 'most', 'recent', 'popular', 'example', 'always', 'seem', 'very', 'arch', 'self-consciously', 'clever', 'forget', 'actually', 'involve', 'characters', ""'re"", 'watching.As', 'described', ""'Storytelling"", 'consists', 'two', 'shorts', 'one', 'labeled', ""'fiction"", 'other', ""'non-fiction"", 'Ironies', 'abound', 'here', 'often', 'said', 'literature', 'fiction', 'unintentionally', 'truthful', 'non-fiction', 'filled', 'lies', 'James', 'Frey', 'embarrassing', 'example', 'phenomenon', 'Similarly', ""'non-fiction"", 'short', 'much', 'more', 'fantastical', 'plot', 'line', ""'fiction"", ""'fiction"", 'short', 'revolves', 'college-level', 'creative', 'writing', 'course', ""'non-fiction"", 'schlub', 'clear', 'stand-in', 'Solondz', 'making', 'documentary', 'something', 'can', 'just', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'is.This', 'movie', 'be', 'direct', 'response', 'criticisms', 'Solondz', 'earlier', 'works', 'song', 'played', 'credits', 'roll', 'asks', 'pointedly', 'what', 'audience', 'story', 'teller', 'what', 'responsibility', 'characters', ""'Fiction"", 'address', 'first', 'part', 'question', 'One', 'character', 'main', 'character', 'why', 'must', 'write', 'such', 'ugly', 'characters', 'Vi', 'plaintively', 'writing', 'things', 'have', 'really', 'happened', 'millions', 'who', 'ask', 'Solondz', 'other', 'artist', 'why', 'creations', 'are', 'so', 'insistently', 'nasty', 'be', 'answer', 'how', 'Solondz', 'world', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'only', 'have', 'visit', 'world', 'hour', 'two', 'few', 'years', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'bear', 'much', 'more', 'course', 'sympathize', 'Vi', 'truth', 'experience', 'same', 'time', 'wink', 'wink', 'know', 'fictional', 'character', 'How', 'gratingly', 'clever', ""'Non-fiction"", 'relationship', 'author', 'documentarian', 'subject', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'schlub', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'helpless', 'usual', 'ca', ""n't"", 'settle', 'topic', 'shape', 'footage', 'taken', 'particularly', 'insipid', 'teenager', 'ultimately', 'go', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'family', 'expense', 'rather', 'focus', 'terrible', 'tragedies', 'occurred', 'filming', 'audience', 'see', 'fictional', 'audience', 'jeering', 'hapless', 'teenager', 'are', 'reminded', 'were', 'laughing', 'too', 'just', 'hour', 'ago', 'Wink', 'wink', 'see', 'how', 'clever', 'intertwined', 'Ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'marks', 'was', 'not', 'invested', 'characters', 'appreciate', 'Solondz', 'willingness', 'break', 'taboos', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'record', 'Dollhouse', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Solondz', 'nihilism', 'despair', 'seemed', 'appropriate', 'film', 'teenagers', 'lack', 'adult', 'perspective', 'more', 'jarring', 'film', ""'Storytelling"", 'reviewer', 'expressed', 'doubts', 'Solondz', 'first', 'thing', 'sexual', 'tensions', 'white', 'women', 'black', 'men', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'agree', 'felt', 'same', 'way', ""'Happiness"", 'watched', 'asked', 'Solodnz', 'really', 'know', 'anything', 'topic', 'simply', 'trying', 'make', 'heads', 'explode', 'portraying', 'sympathetic', 'pedophile', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'felt', 'second', 'My', 'limited', 'understanding', 'pedophile', 'psychology', 'pedophile', 'would', 'not', 'recognize', 'wrong', 'molest', 'children', 'draw', 'distinction', 'son', 'other', 'boys', 'Again', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'found', ""'Happiness"", 'unconvincing.To', 'sum', 'up', 'interesting', 'reliably', 'shocking', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'director', 'found', 'interesting', 'even', 'illuminating', 'not', 'moving']",N/A

""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","Todd Solondz's `Welcome to the Dollhouse' showed comic/absurd promise; his masturbation scene in `Happiness' overstepped the boundary of film taste but got everyone's attention. While I didn't enjoy ""Storytelling"" as much as I did the Director's two previous films, ""Happiness"" and ""Welcome to The Dollhouse,"" Solondz continues to amaze with his depictions of just how awkward true life really is. As always, he masterfully shows the oft times tactless, cynical, transparent motivations of everyday suburban life and combines them with outrageous situations, giving a humorous view into the myriad of interesting quirky characters he creates. As with Happiness, Storytelling has no background characters. Each character gets fully explored in a way that no matter how familiar or foreign a specific character's behavior might be to you, you can't help but understand their motivations. Solondz can develop over 10 characters in 88 minutes while most conventional Hollywood films fail to portray just one in any given 3 hour ""epic"".Selma Blair and Leo Fitzpatrick give incredible performances in the first segment of this film titled ""Fiction"". John Goodman is at his best here in the film's second segment ""Non-fiction"", not to mention it was a good to see Julie Haggerty in it.One of the film's most honest moments (and there are MANY) comes in the beginning of the Non-Fiction segment, during a phone call Paul Giamatti gives to a female classmate he hadn't spoken to since high school. While hilarious, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character, which gets fleshed out in the almost confessional tone of the conversation (which of course, he blunders).I don't want to dig far into the plot because the elements of shock and surprise that are Solondz bread and butter should only be revealed by others, suffice it to say I recommend this movie very highly.

587350,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JKJF,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Todd Solondz is a talented filmmaker and I can say that after seeing only one of his films. I saw ""Happiness"" a few months ago and appreciated it for how smart it was. It was disturbing, disgusting, but smartly written despite all the vulgarity (something I normally never have a problem with). When discussing ""This Film is Not Yet Rated"" he mentioned a scene from that film was from ""Storytelling"" a movie I had never heard of. I rented it that day and saw that it was written and directed by Todd Solondz, so I expected the same kind of thing. When the film ended I just thought...Wow. This is a great film. Unique, provocative, funny, and very intelligently written. I loved it. It's separated into two parts, two mini-movies if you will. The first is ""Fiction"" and the second is ""Non-Fiction."" At least, those are those titles, which are ironic in the same way the title of ""Happiness"" is. The movie runs 82 minutes. I expected them to be 40 minutes apiece. Oddly enough, ""Fiction"" is 27 and ""Non-Fiction"" is 55. A lot of writers would fear doing something like this, but Solondz doesn't want to fill something in just because it's expected. Both films end exactly when they should and not a single scene seems unnecessary. Here's a synopsis of both:FICTION:A college student named Vi (Selma Blair, looking beautiful) has been ""dating"" Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick, ""Kids""), a man with cerebral palsy. After he writes a short story based on their relationship and is told by the professor, Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom) that his story sucks. Since Vi told him it was good, he's disappointed and breaks up with her. Vi goes to a bar to ""get drunk and get laid"" and finds Mr. Scott there. This leads to two things...A terrific ending and a (dare I say it) great ""erotic"" scene.NON-FICTION:In this story, a loser documentary filmmaker named Toby (Paul Giamatti) sets out to make a documentary about teenagers. He finds the perfect specimen (at least, the only one who will participate in it) in Scooby (Mark Webber), a gay Conan O'Brien wannabe. Scooby lives with an overbearing father (John Goodman, in top form), a strange and possibly mentally challenged mother (Julie Haggerty), a popular brother Brady, and a little demon-child intelligent younger brother named Mikey. Several sub-plots abound in this story, including Brady having a football accident and Mikey's attempts to get their nanny Consuelo (Lupe Ontiveros) fired. The ending is one of the best endings I've seen in a long time.Out of both stories, I like ""Non-Fiction"" the best. Both are terrific, containing great acting and well-written story lines that never faulter. But ""Non-Fiction"" is just a masterpiece all its own.Giamatti, Goodman, Webber, and Ontiveros are superb. The dialogue is so funny and so meaningful. I can't rave enough about this movie. Both endings make so much sense; they're almost poetic. This film is a masterpiece, a movie that truly deserves to be seen by a larger audience. Even if you didn't like ""Happiness"" or any of Solondz's other work (I now want to see more of it) I urge you to see this film. This is an American comedy that ranks right up there withSideways, Election, and About Schmidt.GRADE: A",5,A Masterpiece.

587351,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JKJF,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[12, 15]","The mode of portraying a tale is in focus in Storytelling through two different stories that are disconnected, yet associated to one another, as one deals with the fictional and the other the non-fictional.  In the first part, Fiction, Vi (Selma Blair) is in a relationship with Marcus (Leo Fitzpatrick) who suffers from cerebral palsy and both are attending the same university.  Vi and Marcus are currently enrolled in the same creative writing class where the students scrutinize each other's writing.  Fiction exposes how personal experiences are turned into writing, which is callously slaughtered by judgmental readers as they their own set of values to the cerebral playing field of literature.The second part of Storytelling, Non-fiction, illiterates the reality of the world as Scooby Livingston (Mark Webber) perceives it.  Scooby lives in a upper-class bubble protected by his ruling father, Marty (John Goodman), where Scooby is constantly asked, &quot;what are you going to do with your life?&quot;  This endless questioning of Scooby's future seems to have been stressful for him as he has sunk into a zombie-like state.  Scooby escapes reality through smoking pot or chewing down a couple of mushrooms where he flees into dreams of working as a co-host with David Letterman.  The day when a shoe salesman, who aspires to make film, visits Scooby's high school in order to make a documentary about the process of entering college Scooby believes that this is his chance to make connections in the world of media.  However, when the documentary comes along it begins to depict the dream-like world in which Scooby lives in.Storytelling is a clever film that displays the symbiosis between the audience and the storyteller, which is meticulously directed by Solondz.  Solondz depicts the power of the audience to choose what to believe and what to disregard if it is not portrayed in an manner that the audience can accept.  In addition, Solondz offers a notion of how the power of storytelling can sway an audience's convictions in a chosen direction if carefully planned.  In a sense Storytelling is a philosophical film in regards to film and film making, which can be derived from the economics, politics, and the arts.  Yet, the philosophical debate of Storytelling is deep beneath the surface as the audience must use a dialectic approach in order to reach it.

Inexplicably split into two films ('Fiction', 'Non-fiction'), we are first presented with a twenty minute film about community college level 'writing', in which, a young woman has a confrontational and sexual sparring with the black, 'mandingo' teacher. It's all meant to be a comment on hypocritical racists in education. It culminates in an outrageous sex encounter that is literally 'blocked' by a large red rectangle (taboo emphasis). It's moderately entertaining.The second part of the film is more complex. Without exposing too much of the plot, it involves (as ""Happiness"" did) classism, racism, sexism, oh hell, any 'ism' you could imagine. But it works. It is simply a story of an upper middle class American family with the 2.5 kids and the proper suburban parents with a perfect son, the 'imperfect' son and the 'baby'. Kudos to John Goodman and Julie Haggerdy for participating in this movie. They bring life and legitimacy to their roles. Solondz filmed this well before ""reality TV"" was popular, and that is the premise. While the imperfect son is being secretly filmed for a documentary, the family struggles through it's own unusually tragic existence (the youngest of the three sons is the 'Brady Bunch brat' we always thought we wanted to see as evil). Needless to say, Solondz produces many shocks and surprises along the way. The trip is wildly entertaining, but the finale may leave the viewer distraught. Not that the story is poorly conceived or arranged, but simply that the ending is horribly, terribly depressing. It still good enough to recommend.

Having just recently watched Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse i really expected more from this movie.  Reading other reviews i see people complaining about fiction but i thought it was the better of the two stories.  I mainly feel this way because nonfiction couldnt have moved any slower or been more boring.  Not even John Goodman and Paul Giamatti could save this story.  I dont mind slow stories if there is more going on than whats just on the screen but there wasnt with this tale and aside from the little corks thrown in that seemed out of place the story of a loser kid with no ambition being presured to go to college by his rich parents has been told many times better already so why bother telling it again if you dont have anything to add?  I cant imagine that nonfiction was actually based on any real events and if it was then he should have told it better because it creeped along at such a snails pace that i barely made it through it.  Fiction was the better story imo mainly because it moved at a better pace and the acting was much better.  Selma Blair and Leo Fitzpatrick were great were as the kids in nonfiction stumbled over almost all of thier lines.  I also found fiction to be more realistic than nonfiction which may have been the point of the two stories with contradicting titles.

There are some social statements made here but the film does bore at times and never really manages to engage the viewer. It sort of ends up looking like a somewhat rushed piece of work and you get the feeling that a little more attention to the script would have made all the difference.Many of the big name actors here are obviously involved in this project because of the director's previous powerhouse drama ""Happiness"". Although we are not expecting the director to do all that again we are expecting a story, but really only get some piece of experimental cinema that seems as if it was just made for the director's amusement alone and very little else. Storytelling almost plays out as if the director is trying to establish a film that he wants to make. So he has filmed all of these scene to try and see what kind of film he would eventually like to make, but instead actually presents this test as the final approved version of the film. Could it be that this director is just testing the critics to see if they would end up loving a ""bad"" movie because of his last piece of work?The ""film"" is two different stories. One is about a student writer who ends up doing a very non-politically correct story about domination by a mandingo black teacher. The other story is about a documentary film maker following a student at school and at home with his family. The scene at the table about Nazis and being conceived in the womb is fantastic but there is little else here except for maybe the burning at the stake scene.Overall this is just a bad film that doesn't work.

587362,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JKJF,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","""Storytelling,"" a film written and directed by Todd Solondz, is actually made up of a pair of stories combined into a single work.  The first, entitled ""Fiction,"" is the shorter and lesser in quality of the two, telling the tale of a waiflike young college student who, tired of relationships that seem to go nowhere, finds herself having a kinky, almost racist sexual encounter with her black writing professor, then using the experience as source material for one of her amateur stories.  Selma Blair does a beautiful job in the role of Vi, a quiet, taciturn girl who finds herself drawn to an experience she quickly comes to regret.  Even though she is a ""willing partner"" in what happens to her, she also comes to see the exploitative nature of the event.  When she attempts to confront the professor by reading her tale in the writers' workshop session he is hosting, she discovers that few of the other writers are able to see the story for what it is and dismiss it as trite, racist and exploitative fiction.  That seems to be the theme of this first episode - that everything becomes fiction once it is committed to paper - but because the episode itself is so short, it somehow feels underdeveloped and incomplete.  Despite the excellence performances and the assuredness of the direction, this opening section comes across more as a clever conceit than as a fully developed work in its own right.The second story, which is almost twice as long as the first, creates much more of an impact, due largely to the fact that it gives itself more time for the development of character, milieu and theme.  In this tale, entitled, not surprisingly, ""Nonfiction,"" Solondz presents us with a view of an upper middle class suburban family caught in major crisis.  The story focuses on young Scooby Livingston, a high school senior so devoid of ambition, drive and motivation, that he is literally drifting through life, indifferent to family, school, peers, anything but his pie-in-the-sky dream of becoming a talk show host like Conan O'Brien (who makes a fun cameo appearance in the film).  Scooby's family resides in one of those perfectly manicured suburban residences replete with a maid from Central America whom the family members either ignore or treat with hurtful disdain (the mean-spirited action of the youngest son in this regard provides one of the truly disturbing, haunting moments of the film). Solondz does a beautiful job conveying the quiet desperation that defines so many lives lived behind such suburban facades.  Scooby's parents are at a loss to understand why their sterile home environment fails to elicit the responses they think it should from their oldest son.  Paul Giamatti plays Toby Oxman, a wannabe documentary filmmaker who decides to make a movie about Scooby's attempts to get into college.  Toby is a man whose life has not turned out the way he had imagined it would.  Unmarried, living with a roommate, and working as a clerk at a local shoe store, Toby latches onto the Livingston family as his ticket to fame and fortune.  By the end of the film, Toby has gotten more than he bargained for as the family weathers some amazing crises and even provides him with the perfect ""finale"" for his nearly completed work.""Nonfiction"" takes a number of surprising turns, not all of which are entirely convincing or credible, but the film is more interesting for its characterizations and milieu than for its plotting.  Scooby is representative of many of today's apathetic young people, cut off from both his own emotions and the emotions of those around him.  Young Mark Webber captures Scooby's passive, glassy-eyed exterior perfectly.  Equally impressive are John Goodman and Julie Haggerty as Scooby's well-meaning but hopelessly ineffective parents, who simply can't understand why their son fails to share any of their basic values.  Jonathan Osser, as Scooby's youngest brother, Mikey, is a revelation, a smart kid who seems, on the surface, to be warm and caring, but who can, with cold calculation, destroy another human being without a moment's regret or hesitation.As a director, Solondz creates an atmosphere and a world that is raw, stark and sterile, utterly drained of happiness and joy.  In fact, I don't think a single character ever smiles in the course of either of the two stories (with the exception of Scooby and, of course, Conan, in the former's fantasy sequences).

Indeed, if you have already seen ""Happiness"", you will not be shocked at all by the new vulnerablities Solondz is attempting to expose. In fact, you'll be confused as to the point of all of it, because the premise of the movie is wrapped up in some sort of juxtaposition of creators of fiction and nonfiction that few will understand. That leaves you, the viewer left with the rest of the subtexts in the film and the Solondz signature of not backing away when the characters do something subhuman. It'll give you a few things to think and talk about, and the drama is definitely bracing at times,but it is in no way the gut punch that ""Happiness"" was nor is it a new angle on the pathos of perversity.

587364,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B00005JKJF,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 4]","In ""Storytelling"", Todd Solondz wields his darkly hysterical wit against the art of narrative.  In two stories - a shorter one (""Fiction"")starring Selma Blair as a ruthlessly abused college-writing student, and a longer one (""Non-Fiction"") featuring an extra-shlubby Paul Giamatti as a would-be documentarian.  Giamatti and Blair play writers lacking any control over their stories or even any basic idea of how to tell their stories.In ""Fiction"", Blair is Vi, a middling aspiring writer in a college writing workshop populated partly by other middling aspiring writers, and partly by mercilessly efficient critics who pull apart the stories of others, and their authors as well.  Told that she's got little talent, Vi commits herself to turn her life into a story, then write about it.  It's an interesting story, but a short one - Vi is too insubstantial a character to withstand the Solondz-treatment, and once the point is made, there's little left of her to survive.  (Even if her story was true, her professor intones, once it's on paper, it's fiction; that's the cope de grace against her - following a raft of utterly destructive reviews by fellow students that must be heard to be believed.)In ""Non-fiction"" Giamatti tries to document...well he's not sure.  A serial failure (acting, law school, writing), Giamatti decides to try documentary-movie making - but he's only got a vague idea of what he can and wants to do, and he's too weak-willed to keep his subjects from commandeering his movie.  Giamatti's focus is ""Scooby"" Livingston, a very familiar Solondz-type (middle child of a comfortably middle-class modern-Jewish family).  Scoob is utterly alienated - he's undirected, unambitious (he wants to be Conan O'brien's sidekick) sexually conflicted, and stuck between two brothers ever more in control than he is.  As in ""Fiction"", Giamatti is paired up with a narrative conscious - a producer better able to chart the direction of Giamatti's film than Giamatti can.  There are no stand-out performances, because Solondz integrates his characters like the complex components of a WMD - Giamatti & his producer, Vi & her professor(Robert Wisdom), Scooby's homophobic and domestic autocrat father (John Goodman) and his sons.Both stories excel at dissecting the narrative process and revealing the flaws of the failed creators, and they're both quite funny - nobody can do bittersweet & funny at the same time like Solondz.

He pulls no punches, and as usual, remains as cynical as ever. The performances are great all around. The film is split into two parts, ""Fiction"" and ""Non-fiction"", which seem unrelated at first.

587369,A1K2ACRU9YJS17,B00005JKJF,"Tsila Sofer Elguez ""Tsila Sofer Elguez""","[1, 1]","I am still unsure that I have totally understood this movie; however, I am sure about enjoying its viewing quite a lot (especially the second part), and this in spite of the fact that I cannot say I felt a lot for, or identified with any of the characters.I think in both parts the personalities are all somewhat grotesque; however, each of the characters has certain behaviors which are very human and very familiar - although not &quot;socially accepted&quot;. An example for this would be Mickey, the youngest son in the second part, hypnotizing his father and asking that from now on he, Mickey, will be the favorite son.The first part is called ""fiction"" but rather, tries to show the reality of what we choose to term fiction. We meet a few participants in a literary workshop were the student-writers build on their personal experience for their story-writing and then succumb to the criticism of their class mates and the class teacher whose harsh verdict affects all members of the group.The literary class cannot accept one of the stories and claims it to be ""racist"" while our frustrated heroine (Vi) tries to convince the class that what she wrote about can happen in reality and did in fact happen (as the viewer well knows). Vi is fragile and sweet and we are totally on her side although not all her actions and behaviors are fully comprehensible.There is something quite ruthless about this part. A very hard uncomfortable statement about human beings, their cruelty and motives that immediately brings to mind ""Happiness"" another Todd Solondz movie which leaves you with the same uncomfortable feeling. You get to see people in some of their rather low and ugly moments.The second part is termed ""non fiction"" but seemed a lot more fabricated to me... so many things happen to all the characters that I have to admit I remained ""emotionally indifferent"". I am not trying to say that I did not like the story or found it uninteresting, on the contrary. Its just that what happened on the screen, starting with the telephone call between Toby Oxman, an aspiring producer (who works in a shoe store in order to make a living) and his high school friend and ending in the last terrible scene - was just too grotesque for me to identify with.I have to stress again that I did like this part; I enjoyed the acting, especially John Goodman who is one of my favorite actors (and off course I laugh whenever I see him on screen even if the scene is rather tragic). I just remained as a non involved viewer who watches the film ""neutrally"" without taking sides (something that did happen on the first part) because all is too ""far fetched"" for me . This part tells the story of Scooby, a passive indifferent teenager who is filmed by Toby as someone who is in the dramatic ""College application stage"". Scooby does not want to go to College and is only trying to please his father (John Goodman). Scooby's personal story and the family events that follow could have been portrayed as a tragedy but the producer keeps looking for the funny side. In a way I felt that what I sensed (or rather not sensed) while watching ""Storytelling"" is similar to what the producer in the movie inside the movie, was trying to create. The producer keeps asking his friend ""...but isn't this funny? are these not funny parts...?"" ""No"" answers his friend - ""you have a tragedy here"".

I didn't care for Welcome to the Dollhouse when it came out, but that was some time ago and I didn't mind giving him a try again. For me, however, this movie has very little to recommend it. It's amusing at times, quirky and thought provoking at times, but I end up feeling Solondz is more the illusion of substance than he is substance. He makes things weird enough, puts issues in your face enough, and makes sure to appear to be taboo-breaking enough that you'll walk away talking, debating, creating meaning. But in and of itself the film and his character development offers little.I don't buy for a moment that he actually knows anything about the sex and race issues of black men and white women, the focus of the first section. But he throws it in your face as if his main goal is to get a reaction, any reaction. It feels a bit like reality tv - ie, very UNREALITY entertainment wherein people are made to push each others' buttons for the viewers amusement.This viewer, however, wasn't amused. I can see that late teen and early-twenties viewers might like this. Maybe that's his audience. But this is not a particularly adult film, and this filmaker has yet to offer much of importance. He might.

587373,AEGBJ94DCVH5Y,B00005JKJF,x_bruce,"[1, 2]","Storytelling, based on two acts, on first glance may appear to be somewhat unreleated. But there are fine points to the ever downward spiraling hell that is Todd Solondz's vision.In part one we see the story of a disfigured and disabled student and his lover, she doesn't want to hear his revised story. Things start sinking with their eventual breakup. This leads to an encounter that is humiliating and in a story characterized as rape. More bad things happen and we get to examine what exactly is 'fiction' and 'reality'?The answer depends upon the viewer. One take is the humiliation is a form of rape, if not physical, then emotional. And there is no question that issue is fair game, but so is the choice the character makes in a series of smaller humiliations which leads to her crushing experience. Or perhaps the another train of thought is don't get involved with self-absorbed (fill in your favorite invective).The second, longer segment is about a slacker type filmmaker. He has a mid-life issue and focuses on school days 20 years ago, in particular High School. This leads him on a search for a subject which he finds after some rejections. Eventually he finds his subject in Scooby, a seemingly lost person that doesn't seem all that removed from his documentor.As the documentary unfolds and we see the life beyond the documentary we meet the seemingly normal American nuclear family. We see the disagreements between siblings, the disinterest between family members and their various stages of being out of touch with reality...courtesy of, that's right, suburbia. Now this could easily be a film killer as Solodnz has done three films about (sub)uban decay and has managed to outrage and get laughs at the expense of this sub-culture. Thankfully there is some seeming self-deprecation in this segment of Storytelling.As the plot progresses betrayals of all kinds and sizes occur with different results concluding in a - depending on your way of thinking - ironic or sick ending. I lean towards ironic and intentionally ambigious to one of the major characters. There seems to be a lot of self awareness in Storytelling, the other thing that could easily kill a film. What keeps this film fresh is it's black humor and it's premise.In the end the meaning between both parts of the whole is fiction is just another form of reality, that those that want to ignore parts of their existance do so and lead a fictional life. Conversely, those that deal in fiction find themselves within the story whether intentional or not. The way we percieve reality and fiction are a fine line and one Storytelling does a fine job of getting across even if it isn't evident immediately.",5,Reality for the hell of it,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",2003,2685,"['Storytelling', 'based', 'two', 'acts', 'first', 'glance', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'somewhat', 'unreleated', 'are', 'fine', 'points', 'ever', 'downward', 'spiraling', 'hell', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'vision.In', 'part', 'one', 'see', 'story', 'disfigured', 'disabled', 'student', 'lover', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'revised', 'story', 'Things', 'start', 'sinking', 'eventual', 'breakup', 'encounter', 'humiliating', 'story', 'characterized', 'rape', 'More', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'get', 'examine', 'what', 'exactly', ""'fiction"", ""'reality"", 'answer', 'viewer', 'One', 'take', 'humiliation', 'form', 'rape', 'not', 'physical', 'then', 'emotional', 'question', 'issue', 'fair', 'game', 'so', 'choice', 'character', 'series', 'smaller', 'humiliations', 'crushing', 'experience', 'perhaps', 'train', 'thought', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'self-absorbed', 'fill', 'favorite', 'invective', 'second', 'longer', 'segment', 'slacker', 'type', 'filmmaker', 'mid-life', 'issue', 'school', 'days', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'particular', 'High', 'School', 'search', 'subject', 'rejections', 'Eventually', 'subject', 'Scooby', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'person', ""n't"", 'seem', 'removed', 'documentor.As', 'documentary', 'unfolds', 'see', 'life', 'documentary', 'meet', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'American', 'nuclear', 'family', 'see', 'disagreements', 'siblings', 'disinterest', 'family', 'members', 'various', 'stages', 'being', 'touch', 'reality', 'courtesy', 'right', 'suburbia', 'Now', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'film', 'killer', 'Solodnz', 'done', 'three', 'films', 'sub', 'uban', 'decay', 'managed', 'outrage', 'get', 'laughs', 'expense', 'sub-culture', 'Thankfully', 'seeming', 'self-deprecation', 'segment', 'Storytelling.As', 'plot', 'betrayals', 'kinds', 'sizes', 'occur', 'different', 'results', 'concluding', 'depending', 'way', 'thinking', 'ironic', 'sick', 'ending', 'lean', 'towards', 'ironic', 'intentionally', 'ambigious', 'one', 'major', 'characters', 'be', 'lot', 'self', 'awareness', 'Storytelling', 'other', 'thing', 'could', 'easily', 'kill', 'film', 'What', 'film', 'fresh', 'black', 'humor', 'end', 'meaning', 'parts', 'whole', 'fiction', 'just', 'form', 'reality', 'want', 'ignore', 'parts', 'existance', 'do', 'so', 'lead', 'fictional', 'life', 'Conversely', 'deal', 'fiction', 'find', 'story', 'intentional', 'not', 'way', 'percieve', 'reality', 'fiction', 'are', 'fine', 'line', 'one', 'Storytelling', 'fine', 'job', 'getting', 'even', ""n't"", 'evident', 'immediately']",N/A
