CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","'I Just Wasn't Made For These Times' is a very good documentary about Brian Wilson, composer and arranger, and an original member, of The Beach Boys. This documentary focuses on Brian, and takes his side with regards to the rift that sent him and the group in opposite directions: The Beach Boys sound became a very lucrative commodity just as Brian Wilson was going in a more experimental direction. Mike Love, the rest of the band, and Capitol Records didn't want to mess with the successful formula. The fraternal friction led to a breakdown for Brian, who spent years unable to even get out of bed.The documentary has a lot of quotes from other musicians who are really in awe of Brian--Tom Petty compares him to Beethoven, Linda Ronstadt has some other observations about his talent. Lots of other folks who knew him have many anecdotes about how strange he could be--once he met Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop and Iggy was frightened by his weirdness. Imagine how weird you would have to be to scare the stooge.It is very interesting to hear how Brian developed his musical style. His two biggest influences were the vocal harmonies of The Four Freshmen and the recording studio genius of Phil Spector. His daughters Carnie and Wendy Wilson describe growing up hearing him play ""Be My Baby"" by The Ronettes every day as soon as he woke up. Brian talks about an epiphany hearing The Four Freshman in the demonstration booth of a record store, and then going home from high school every day and studying the harmonies song by song, figuring them out completely on his piano.It is good to see Brian Wilson recovered from his darkest days of mental illness. He is still kind of eccentric, but he's adjusted, he's more of a family man, and he's still making music.Surfin' Safari/Surfin' U.S.A.Surfer Girl/Shut Down, Vol. 2Little Deuce Coupe/All Summer LongPet SoundsSMiLEThe Beach Boys - Endless HarmonyThe Beach Boys and the Satan[This German documentary on The Beach Boys veers off into Charles Manson territory, but then returns with more interesting interviews with Brian Wilson and other Beach Boy personnel]The Ronettes: Ultimate Collection; Greatest Hits[Brian Wilson really loved the Phil Spector 'wall of sound' and played ""Be My Baby"" constantly as his habitual morning ritual]Capitol Collectors Series: The Four FreshmenOrange Crate Art",4,God Only Knows How I Feel About You,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2343,"['Just', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Made', 'Times', 'very', 'good', 'documentary', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'composer', 'arranger', 'original', 'member', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'Brian', 'side', 'regards', 'rift', 'sent', 'group', 'opposite', 'directions', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'sound', 'became', 'very', 'lucrative', 'commodity', 'just', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'was', 'going', 'more', 'experimental', 'direction', 'Mike', 'Love', 'rest', 'band', 'Capitol', 'Records', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'mess', 'successful', 'formula', 'fraternal', 'friction', 'led', 'breakdown', 'Brian', 'who', 'spent', 'years', 'unable', 'even', 'get', 'bed.The', 'documentary', 'lot', 'quotes', 'other', 'musicians', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'awe', 'Brian', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Beethoven', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'other', 'observations', 'talent', 'Lots', 'other', 'folks', 'who', 'knew', 'have', 'many', 'anecdotes', 'how', 'strange', 'could', 'be', 'once', 'met', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Iggy', 'Pop', 'Iggy', 'was', 'frightened', 'weirdness', 'Imagine', 'how', 'weird', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'scare', 'stooge.It', 'very', 'interesting', 'hear', 'how', 'Brian', 'developed', 'musical', 'style', 'two', 'biggest', 'influences', 'were', 'vocal', 'harmonies', 'Four', 'Freshmen', 'recording', 'studio', 'genius', 'Phil', 'Spector', 'daughters', 'Carnie', 'Wendy', 'Wilson', 'describe', 'growing', 'up', 'hearing', 'play', 'Be', 'My', 'Baby', 'Ronettes', 'day', 'as', 'soon', 'woke', 'up', 'Brian', 'talks', 'epiphany', 'hearing', 'Four', 'Freshman', 'demonstration', 'booth', 'record', 'store', 'then', 'going', 'home', 'high', 'school', 'day', 'studying', 'harmonies', 'song', 'song', 'figuring', 'out', 'completely', 'piano.It', 'good', 'see', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'recovered', 'darkest', 'days', 'mental', 'illness', 'still', 'kind', 'eccentric', 'adjusted', 'more', 'family', 'man', 'still', 'making', 'music.Surfin', 'Safari/Surfin', 'U.S.A.Surfer', 'Girl/Shut', 'Down', 'Vol', '2Little', 'Deuce', 'Coupe/All', 'Summer', 'LongPet', 'SoundsSMiLEThe', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Endless', 'HarmonyThe', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Satan', '[', 'German', 'documentary', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'veers', 'off', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'territory', 'then', 'more', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'other', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'personnel', ']', 'Ronettes', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'Greatest', '[', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'really', 'loved', 'Phil', 'Spector', ""'wall"", 'sound', 'played', 'Be', 'Baby', 'constantly', 'habitual', 'morning', 'ritual', ']', 'Capitol', 'Collectors', 'Series', 'Four', 'FreshmenOrange', 'Crate', 'Art']",N/A

Now they've gone through how ever many  different incarnations, and Brian Wilson has been tabloid fodder many times  over the past 10 years or so.Famed music-producer Don Was decided it was  his honor to pay tribute to a man who, indeed, was a musical genius, a man  who's artistry influenced so, so many, both in the music business, and  beyond.In different ways, Keith Richards, through `Hail, Hail, Rock and  Roll' (the life of Chuck Berry), and Bruce Springsteen, with his `Roy  Orbison, A Black and White Night' made wonderful, lasting tributes to men  who's musical contributions were cornerstone to a generation. After  watching this film, I find Brian Wilson no less deserving.The film is  honest and fairly raw. There are many generous tributes from incredible  stars, as well as recounts from family and friends. The framework is Wilson  himself, telling his story, and this, of course is many times difficult to  watch just due to the deterioration Wilson has experienced over his life.  He seems lucid, and his memory is strong, but he struggles with speech and  his focus is not real sharp at times.It's a wonderful tribute, lovingly  crafted.

506339,A3FA3BPKD4BZTE,B00000JLV7,Ricardo Mio,"[0, 0]","All documentaries should be this good.  Comprised of a number of interviews, with Brian Wilson, his mother Andrea and ex-wife Marilyn, song collaborators Peter Asher and Van Dyke Parks, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Tom Petty, Lindsey Buckingham, Linda Ronstadt and many, many others.  What emerges is a composite picture of Brian Wilson with very few missing pieces.  This is probably as close to knowing Brian as we&#8217;ll ever get.Bizarre, disarmingly honest, and possessed of childlike innocence.  That&#8217;s the impression everyone had who met him.  But that doesn&#8217;t explain Wilson&#8217;s genius.  None of those interviewed attempted to.  Brian himself offers an explanation of sorts.  While in high school, his mother took him to a record store where--listening to the Four Freshman in a demonstration booth--he had an epiphany.  The experience was transformative.  He became consumed with music.  He taught his brothers how to sing harmony, spent hours and hours at the piano breaking down chord-by-chard every song by the Four Freshman, and in the process learned to be a songwriter.  Later, when he formed the Beach Boys, his genius for composing songs with a sophistication unheard of in pop music emerged.  Musicians from David Crosby of the Byrds to Paul McCartney of the Beatles were stunned.  Linda Ronstadt says simply: &#8220;Brian Wilson was the most highly regarded pop musician in America.&#8221;Brian&#8217;s obsession was partly the result of his father&#8217;s abusive behavior.  By most accounts, Murray Wilson was a monster who beat his kids regularly, particularly Brian.  Brian&#8217;s emotional escape was to turn inward.  &#8220;Music was my only friend,&#8221; he says of his years growing up.  Later, when he was no longer using music as an escape, he suffered a nervous breakdown, brought on partly by drug abuse, but mostly by his father&#8217;s abuse.  Brian&#8217;s vivid description of the spanking&#8217;s he received is painful for him to recall, even now.Brian discusses in detail a number of his songs, among them &#8221;The Warmth of the Sun,&#8221; &#8220;Caroline No,&#8221; and &#8220;Till I Die,&#8221; which he also performs with a full-complement of background singers and studio musicians.  At the video&#8217;s conclusion, the interviewer asks, &#8220;Do you still think you weren&#8217;t made for these times?&#8221;  Says Brian: &#8220;At this point, I think so.&#8221;",5,As close to knowing Brian as we'll ever get,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",2014,2427,"['documentaries', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'Comprised', 'number', 'interviews', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'mother', 'Andrea', 'ex-wife', 'Marilyn', 'song', 'collaborators', 'Peter', 'Asher', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Parks', 'David', 'Crosby', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'What', 'composite', 'picture', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'very', 'few', 'missing', 'pieces', 'probably', 'as', 'close', 'knowing', 'Brian', '8217', 'ever', 'get.Bizarre', 'disarmingly', 'honest', 'possessed', 'childlike', 'innocence', '8217', 's', 'impression', 'everyone', 'had', 'who', 'met', 'doesn', '8217', 'explain', 'Wilson', '8217', 's', 'genius', 'None', 'interviewed', 'attempted', 'Brian', 'explanation', 'sorts', 'high', 'school', 'mother', 'took', 'record', 'store', 'where', 'listening', 'Four', 'Freshman', 'demonstration', 'had', 'epiphany', 'experience', 'was', 'transformative', 'became', 'consumed', 'music', 'taught', 'brothers', 'how', 'sing', 'harmony', 'spent', 'hours', 'hours', 'piano', 'breaking', 'down', 'chord-by-chard', 'song', 'Four', 'Freshman', 'process', 'learned', 'be', 'songwriter', 'Later', 'when', 'formed', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'genius', 'composing', 'songs', 'sophistication', 'unheard', 'pop', 'music', 'emerged', 'Musicians', 'David', 'Crosby', 'Byrds', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Beatles', 'were', 'stunned', 'Linda', 'Ronstadt', 'simply', '8220', 'Brian', 'Wilson', 'was', 'most', 'highly', 'regarded', 'pop', 'musician', 'America.', '8221', 'Brian', '8217', 's', 'obsession', 'was', 'partly', 'result', 'father', '8217', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'most', 'accounts', 'Murray', 'Wilson', 'was', 'monster', 'who', 'beat', 'kids', 'regularly', 'particularly', 'Brian', 'Brian', '8217', 'emotional', 'escape', 'was', 'turn', 'inward', '8220', 'Music', 'was', 'only', 'friend', '8221', 'years', 'growing', 'up', 'Later', 'when', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'using', 'music', 'escape', 'suffered', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'brought', 'partly', 'drug', 'abuse', 'mostly', 'father', '8217', 's', 'abuse', 'Brian', '8217', 'vivid', 'description', 'spanking', '8217', 'received', 'painful', 'recall', 'even', 'now.Brian', 'discusses', 'detail', 'number', 'songs', '8221', 'Warmth', 'Sun', '8221', '8220', 'Caroline', 'No', '8221', '8220', 'Till', 'Die', '8221', 'also', 'full-complement', 'background', 'singers', 'studio', 'musicians', 'video', '8217', 's', 'conclusion', 'interviewer', '8220', 'Do', 'still', 'think', 'weren', '8217', 'made', 'times', '8221', 'Brian', '8220', 'point', 'think', 'so.', '8221']",N/A
