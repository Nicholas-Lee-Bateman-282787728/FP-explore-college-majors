Releasing a known terrorist BEFORE he could be properly tortured. Well at least they KNEW, like had real metaphysical certitude it was a bonified evil doer. Often in the real world part of the problem is they don't know. But we're not dealing with reality here folks. Oh, I'm sorry, does that bother any fans out there? Just moments before they can do what in ""24"" always must be done to save the day, guess who shows up to mess up everything? You probably guessed it: a liberal. Well a guy that is a sort of talk radio Fox news sterotype of a liberal -- a lawyer from an organization called -get this- ""Amnesty Global"". Lol, For those not familiar, there is something in the real world called Amnesty International. It is an ""international non-governmental organization which defines its mission as 'to undertake research and action focused on preventing and ending abuses of the rights to physical and mental integrity, freedom of conscience and expression, and freedom from discrimination, within the context of its work to promote all human rights'"". Amnesty International does wonderful work throughout the world. But back to the show, so like this weasel lawyer spouts off a bunch of stuff about the Geneva Conventions and millions of people almost die because of it! Luckily lonestar Jack Bauer (J.B. are popular initials for super-agents) does the right thing, quiting the Terrorist Unit, Counter Terrorist Unit, becomes a private citizen and then is free to break the suspect's fingers. I was reading about an event sponsored by the ultra-rightwing Heritage Foundation at which ""24""'s producers along with three cast members appeared with Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff. A discussion was moderated by Rush Limbaugh about the public image of US terrorism policy.""24"" repeatedly made the argument that torture works. ""24"" put forward to the American television viewing public the ""ticking time bomb"" case for torture: we must torture a suspect, or else thousands, maybe millions will die soon. Probably within the next hour. There has never been a ticking time bomb case but lone super-agent Jack Bauer faces them all the time. Yea it's just a TV show, but it's funny how TV has always both reflected and shaped the attitudes and views of the American public ain't it? Funny too how many of those who would shout the loudest it's just a TV show and unconcerned with violence and torture, are also often those more bothered by a naughty word or ""wardrobe malfunction"". ""24"" is the ultimate Bush post 9-11 America War On Terra TV series.

Even though there are some differences (explained above) between Season 4 and the previous three, the fact remains that this is a truly outstanding show.If you enjoyed the first three seasons, number 4 will not disappoint you. If you did not, don't waste your time. And if you have not yet watched any season, and even though #4 is great, my advise would be to start from the beginning, with #1. But if you don't have patience and want to move on to this one, go for it. Not having watched the previous ones will have minor impact on your enjoyment.24 is one of the most addictive action series ever. Its ""live drama"", simultaneous shots of actions happening in different places at the same time, its writers' willingness to create unexpected turns of events (those daring situations which usually you don't expect to happen), are some of the reasons why its so outstanding. You will be glued to your seat while you watch this fantastic show.

Paulsen ""AlexP""","[2, 10]","I thought seasons 1-3 were masterpieces of cliffhanger style suspense.I don't know if it's just me or not but this season seemed very predictable. I was able to call way ahead of time just about every ""surprise"" this season.The other bothersome thing is the 2nd plot element about the Dobson device. The very concept it beyond ridiculous. For all the resources the producers had they could have hired at one nuclear engineer to tell them how silly the idea was and how it would practically ruin the enjoyment of the series.How could you take it seriously when they were talking such nonsense about the Dobson Override and its ""capabilities"". It was so idiotic it almost turned the rest of the season into a comedy. I was never so happy to see a plot segment finished as that one.It would have been more credible if they had the terrorists using a Star Trek transporter to beam nuclear weapons into government buildings. Thats about the level of the Dobson device. It was just silly and stupid and I was very disappointed with this segment of the plot. I was never so happy to see a plot segment finished as that one.It was even sillier than the Secretary of Defense pulling a Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" stunt even though Devane made it a little bit believable - but only a little.I almost would have preferred to see the S2 cougar back again.Fortunately the series got back on track after they found the override and we were back into an area where 24 excels - good old fashioned action/suspense. There were a few holes here and there, one of stretches of credibility and a more than a few spots where you wonder why Jack with all his skills and experience would do &lt;spoiler deleted> and &lt;spoiler deleted> but overall it was rolicking fun.It was also great to see a few familiar faces from previous seasons.In addition to the thrills and chills there are a few comedic aspects; the new President Logan gives a terrific ""Bush look"" confused and clueless while telling everyone he's in charge and he's the boss. He even looks a little like W, especially with the ""W"" patented ""deer in the headlights"" look every time something happens.Overall it was a 4 star season, but the last two DVD's were 5+. It was the 2nd half of DVD 2 and all of DVD 3 that dragged the rating down. My ony bitch is the final element with the Chinese could have been so easily dealt with, it was obvious yet they chose the hard way and that was a bit unrealistic but essential to the ending we we can forgive.It did set up what promises to be a very surreal and exciting Season 5!",4,losing it a little,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,2565,"['thought', 'seasons', '1-3', 'were', 'masterpieces', 'cliffhanger', 'style', 'suspense.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'not', 'season', 'seemed', 'very', 'predictable', 'was', 'able', 'call', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'just', 'about', 'surprise', 'other', 'bothersome', 'thing', '2nd', 'plot', 'element', 'Dobson', 'device', 'very', 'concept', 'ridiculous', 'resources', 'producers', 'had', 'could', 'have', 'hired', 'one', 'nuclear', 'engineer', 'tell', 'how', 'silly', 'idea', 'was', 'how', 'would', 'practically', 'ruin', 'enjoyment', 'series.How', 'could', 'take', 'seriously', 'when', 'were', 'talking', 'such', 'nonsense', 'Dobson', 'Override', 'capabilities', 'was', 'so', 'idiotic', 'almost', 'turned', 'rest', 'season', 'comedy', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'plot', 'segment', 'finished', 'one.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'credible', 'had', 'terrorists', 'using', 'Star', 'Trek', 'transporter', 'beam', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'government', 'buildings', 'Thats', 'level', 'Dobson', 'device', 'was', 'just', 'silly', 'stupid', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'segment', 'plot', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'plot', 'segment', 'finished', 'one.It', 'was', 'even', 'sillier', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'pulling', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Missing', 'Action', 'stunt', 'even', 'Devane', 'made', 'little', 'bit', 'believable', 'only', 'little.I', 'almost', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'S2', 'cougar', 'back', 'again.Fortunately', 'series', 'got', 'back', 'track', 'found', 'override', 'were', 'back', 'area', 'where', '24', 'excels', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'action/suspense', 'were', 'few', 'holes', 'here', 'there', 'one', 'stretches', 'credibility', 'more', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'wonder', 'why', 'Jack', 'skills', 'experience', 'would', 'do', 'lt', 'spoiler', 'deleted', '>', 'lt', 'spoiler', 'deleted', '>', 'overall', 'was', 'rolicking', 'fun.It', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'few', 'familiar', 'previous', 'seasons.In', 'addition', 'thrills', 'chills', 'are', 'few', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'new', 'President', 'Logan', 'terrific', 'Bush', 'look', 'confused', 'clueless', 'telling', 'everyone', 'charge', 'boss', 'even', 'little', 'like', 'W', 'especially', 'W', 'patented', 'deer', 'headlights', 'look', 'time', 'something', 'happens.Overall', 'was', '4', 'star', 'season', 'last', 'two', 'DVD', 'were', '5+', 'was', '2nd', 'half', 'DVD', '2', 'DVD', '3', 'dragged', 'rating', 'down', 'ony', 'bitch', 'final', 'element', 'Chinese', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easily', 'dealt', 'was', 'obvious', 'yet', 'chose', 'hard', 'way', 'was', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'essential', 'ending', 'can', 'forgive.It', 'did', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'surreal', 'exciting', 'Season', '5']",N/A

And when I say that, please don't misinterpret me:  While there isn't anything flagrantly wrong with this season, there isn't a lot of things remarkable about it.As some previous reviewers have said, the beginning is fast moving, clever, and exciting and so is the ending (probably the BEST ending to a 24 season ever).  But the middle is the weakest because the writers recycled old ideas (and didn't execute them as well as in previous seasons anyways): As in Season 1, there's a mole in CTU.  Like in Season 2, Arabs are the villains and nuclear technology is a part of their plan.  As in Season 3, a spouse must decide whether to help save their loved one or do their job.  And the president should realize by now that it will save some time if he simply gives Jack a bunch of immunity papers to put in his pocket and hand out as he captures the the bad guys who are (as always) only going to give information in exchange for immunity.I don't think that the show has reached the bottom of the barrel just yet, but there's no denying that it isn't as fresh as it once was.  Probably the most memorable thing to happen in the middle is Chloe briefly showing off her Rombo side (I won't spoil it and trust me, it's cool).  And because the middle portion takes up the bulk of the time, I can't give this a high rating or recommend that you buy it.(...)I say this every time I review a 24 season, but THE only true season of 24 that is worth absolutely every penny is the first season.

The first season, I wasn't sure the concept would work too well.  Wouldn't parts of the show drag along?  Four years later, I know the answer is 'no'.  No dragging allowed for these characters.Season 4 was no less unique than its 3 previous seasons.  They began by tackling a very difficult/uncomfortable topic, terrorism.  Who knows if it was covered realistically, but both ends of the spectrum were shown - monsters with no conscience and empathetic everyday humans.Now, I'm as attached to Jack Bauer as the next fan.  He's a kick-rear, tormented Patriot.  But Chloe - the human robot girl - kicked some MAJOR rear this season.

She really is the Jar Jar Binks of 24 (albeit an much better looking one), and it would be just as satisfying seeing her killed as it would have been to see him beheaded by a lightsaber.  Maybe they won't think to bring her back, or if they do maybe Mark Hammil could guest star as a washed out stick up man, and shoot her in a robbery gone bad.Without going too much into the plot, this show has all the elements of 24 that make it good, cliff hangers, violence, torture, infltration of CTU, superiors that are disagreeable, plot twists, immunity papers, good presidents, bad presidents, Tony (who by the way has always reminded me of Moe on the Simpsons) etc.  Unfortunately, all these things were used in other seasons.  At least Jack isn't usning the ""H"" any more.I was also starting to like agent Castle.  He was shaping up to be the ""Wedge"" character that survived all the episodes, but didn't really have that large of a part.  Unfortunately, he was killed giving in to a terrorist.  I would like to see somebody tell one of the bad guys NO, and just get shot, rather than help the villans and die later.There really is nothing new here, infact you could skip many of the middle episodes, and just watch the previews and probably be as satisfied.  I did also enjoy watching the son of the Secretary of Defence (aka the man Ted Kennedy always wanted to be) repeatedly tortured.I am giving this season 4 stars because I guess 3.5 rounds up.  It is entertaining, however the ending could be better in that Jack would have stayed dead and they revived him at the start of the next season, or had a special summer episode where he came back to life again.My recommendation is that if you are still watching this show after last season, you will be satisfied renting this one.",4,All that's new this season is that Kim is gone.,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,1869,"['Ah', 'How', 'refreshing', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'show', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'dead', 'really', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', '24', 'much', 'better', 'looking', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'satisfying', 'seeing', 'killed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'beheaded', 'lightsaber', 'Maybe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'bring', 'back', 'do', 'maybe', 'Mark', 'Hammil', 'could', 'guest', 'star', 'washed', 'out', 'stick', 'up', 'man', 'robbery', 'gone', 'bad.Without', 'going', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'show', 'elements', '24', 'make', 'good', 'cliff', 'hangers', 'violence', 'torture', 'infltration', 'CTU', 'superiors', 'are', 'disagreeable', 'plot', 'twists', 'immunity', 'papers', 'good', 'presidents', 'bad', 'presidents', 'Tony', 'who', 'way', 'always', 'reminded', 'Moe', 'Simpsons', 'etc', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'were', 'used', 'other', 'seasons', 'least', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'usning', 'H', 'more.I', 'was', 'also', 'starting', 'like', 'agent', 'Castle', 'was', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'Wedge', 'character', 'survived', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'large', 'part', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'killed', 'giving', 'terrorist', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'somebody', 'tell', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'NO', 'just', 'get', 'shot', 'rather', 'help', 'villans', 'die', 'later.There', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'infact', 'could', 'skip', 'many', 'middle', 'episodes', 'just', 'watch', 'previews', 'probably', 'be', 'satisfied', 'did', 'also', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'son', 'Secretary', 'Defence', 'man', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'repeatedly', 'tortured.I', 'am', 'giving', 'season', '4', 'stars', 'guess', '3.5', 'up', 'entertaining', 'however', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Jack', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'dead', 'revived', 'start', 'next', 'season', 'had', 'special', 'summer', 'episode', 'where', 'came', 'back', 'life', 'again.My', 'recommendation', 'are', 'still', 'watching', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'renting', 'one']",N/A

When my boyfriend came home from his trip , he also joined in. He does not care much for TV stuff, but he also was hooked immeditaely. So this year, as soon as season 4 was out, we rented it and watched it. And we were not dissapointed.This season is just as good as the previous three. In fact it is better than season 3. The adrenalin rush is there all the way through and Jack Bauer is as great as ever. After missing some of the original carachters during the first half of season four, it was great to see them reintroduced a little at a time as the season progressed, in a very plausible manner. I was especially pleased when they brought back the ex president, as I love the guy that plays him.The storyline was generally very exciting and ended in a very moving way, bringing a lot of feeling into the last few episodes of the show.

937386,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B000B837XI,C. Chow,"[0, 0]","As a die hard `24' fan I can minutely pick it to death with all the things they could have done differently or better. But let me first say yes yes yes it's a must see and worth every penny.If you've seen `24' before you won't be disappointed. If you're new to `24' season 4 will certainly make you a fan.The Plot: Kiefer Sutherland is back as super spy Jack Bauer. While visiting the new CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) in LA, Jack's girlfriend and her father the Secretary of Defense are held hostage by Muslim terrorists. The terrorists have planned a full day of attacks on America including melting down our nuclear power plants, assassinating the President (Geoff Peterson) by shooting down Air Force One, and stealing the Nuclear Football with our ICBM codes. The only real side plot is told by a Muslim boy who loves America and rebels against his parents by not being a terrorist.Why it works: Season 4 works because there's NEVER a dull moment, there are arguably more explosions and shootouts than any other season. It also embodies everything we love about `24' the action is very real, there are no hokey scenes of kids beating terrorists or cops or G Men acting like stereotypical fools. There's more techno babel than `Star Trek' as CTU uses all the latest technology and gadgets that put Q to shame to stop crime in real time.There are no long drawn out kidnappings that take 6 hours, or kidnap victims sitting in a barn for 7 hours (season 1). There are no meaningless filler side plots of romances or family problems (seasons 1 & 3).For its climax season 4 REALLY comes through with the return of Mandy (Mia Kirshner) the sexy assassin, who proves her self a formidable force to take on all of CTU.The week points: The big problem `24' faced in its 4th season was that 90% of the cast walked off!!! Hence they must be replaced by new characters. But just as we are introduced to and getting to like CTU's new members about 12 hours in they leave for cheesy reasons and the plot shifts drastically to attempting to reunite the original cast of characters.Jack succeeds with all except for `24's true star Nordic goddess Elisha Cuthbert. The absence of Elisha as Kim Bauer is downright painful. There is no Kim being chased by a mountain lion, giving her gun to terrorists, trying to date her kidnappers, setting her car on fire, or being kidnapped on an hourly basis.The final week point is that CTU does not face an overall threat as it did in season 2 & 3 so some of the impending horror of the situation is lost. Rather the terrorists' plan is a mystery and CTU reacts to the terrorist attacks rather than trying to stop them.With that said, order it now!!!",5,Plain Cheese Pizza Is Still Great,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2674,"['die', 'hard', '24', 'fan', 'can', 'minutely', 'pick', 'death', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'better', 'let', 'first', 'say', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'must', 'see', 'worth', 'penny.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', '24', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'new', '24', 'season', '4', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'fan.The', 'Plot', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'back', 'super', 'spy', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'visiting', 'new', 'CTU', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'LA', 'Jack', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'are', 'held', 'hostage', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'terrorists', 'have', 'planned', 'full', 'day', 'attacks', 'America', 'including', 'melting', 'down', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plants', 'assassinating', 'President', 'Geoff', 'Peterson', 'shooting', 'down', 'Air', 'Force', 'One', 'stealing', 'Nuclear', 'Football', 'ICBM', 'codes', 'only', 'real', 'side', 'plot', 'told', 'Muslim', 'boy', 'who', 'America', 'rebels', 'parents', 'not', 'being', 'terrorist.Why', 'Season', '4', 'works', 'NEVER', 'dull', 'moment', 'are', 'arguably', 'more', 'explosions', 'shootouts', 'other', 'season', 'also', 'everything', 'love', '24', 'action', 'very', 'real', 'are', 'hokey', 'scenes', 'kids', 'beating', 'terrorists', 'cops', 'G', 'Men', 'acting', 'stereotypical', 'fools', 'more', 'techno', 'babel', 'Star', 'Trek', 'CTU', 'latest', 'technology', 'gadgets', 'put', 'Q', 'shame', 'stop', 'crime', 'real', 'are', 'long', 'drawn', 'kidnappings', 'take', '6', 'hours', 'kidnap', 'victims', 'sitting', 'barn', '7', 'hours', 'season', '1', 'are', 'meaningless', 'filler', 'side', 'plots', 'romances', 'family', 'problems', 'seasons', '1', '3', '.For', 'climax', 'season', '4', 'REALLY', 'return', 'Mandy', 'Mia', 'Kirshner', 'sexy', 'assassin', 'who', 'self', 'formidable', 'force', 'take', 'CTU.The', 'week', 'points', 'big', 'problem', '24', 'faced', '4th', 'season', 'was', '90', '%', 'cast', 'walked', 'off', 'Hence', 'must', 'be', 'replaced', 'new', 'characters', 'just', 'are', 'introduced', 'getting', 'like', 'CTU', 'new', 'members', '12', 'hours', 'leave', 'cheesy', 'reasons', 'plot', 'shifts', 'drastically', 'attempting', 'reunite', 'original', 'cast', 'characters.Jack', '24', 'true', 'star', 'Nordic', 'goddess', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'absence', 'Elisha', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'downright', 'painful', 'Kim', 'being', 'chased', 'mountain', 'lion', 'giving', 'gun', 'terrorists', 'trying', 'date', 'kidnappers', 'setting', 'car', 'fire', 'being', 'kidnapped', 'hourly', 'basis.The', 'final', 'week', 'point', 'CTU', 'not', 'face', 'overall', 'threat', 'did', 'season', '2', '3', 'so', 'impending', 'horror', 'situation', 'lost', 'terrorists', 'plan', 'mystery', 'CTU', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'rather', 'trying', 'stop', 'them.With', 'said', 'order', 'now']",N/A

Kiefer Sutherland is back and is about to have, yet, another bad day of his life.It has been a year and a half since JACK BAUER (again played by Kiefer Sutherland) ridded North America of a deadly virus. Shortly after completing this task, CTU was appointed a new head: ERIN DRISCOLL (played by Alberta Watson). Once she took up office as the head of CTU's Los Angeles office, she immediately relieved Jack Bauer of his duties.A year and a half later, CTU is still being run by Erin Driscoll. Most of CTU's employees have quit their jobs. Chase and Kim (though no sign of them at all in this season) have moved elsewhere and decided to build a life together. TONY ALMEIDA (again played by Carlos Bernard) is living alone, after Jack had bailed him out of jail. Tony has become an alcoholic, whereas his wife, Michelle Dessler, who worked for CTU and is now working for DIVISION, left Tony. The only member left from last season is CHLOE O'BRIAN (again played by Mary Lynn Rajskub). Among the new employees, there is EDGAR STYLES (played by Louis Lombardi). Edgar is a little slow with things and is a little nerdy, but Edgar is a good guy and is willing to do his job right.Jack is now working in Washington D.C. He is working for JAMES HELLER (played by William Devane), The U.S. Secratary Of Defense. Jack is secretly having an affair with James' beautiful daughter, AUDREY HELLER-RAINS (played by Kim Raver). Audrey is separated from her husband, PAUL RAINS. She will be filing for divorce soon. They are in L.A. at the moment, for Erin Driscoll wants a meeting with Jack.Jack arrives at CTU, has a brief conversation with Chloe and then heads for Erin's office. Their meeting is cut short for there is another terrorist threat getting ready to take play. Audrey and James are at Audrey's brother's house, where Audrey and James are kidnapped.Hours go by and Jack successfully rescues James and Audry. But they realize that their kidnapping was a part of an even bigger plan that has been spent years in the making. This plan is led by a terrorist named HABIB MARWAN (played by THE MUMMY'S ARNOLD VOSLOO). Working with Marwan is the ARAZ family, consisting of NAVI ARAZ, his wife, DINA, and their son, BARHOOZ. But Dina and Barhooz betray their father, for they want no parts of this.Later that night, the newly elected President is seriously hurt in an explosion, where VICE PRESIDENT LOGAN is sworn in to office. PRESIDENT LOGAN is having a lot of trouble dealing with today's events, where he calls in a former President...DAVID PALMER (again played by Dennis Haysbert). At the same time, Erin Driscoll leaves CTU to deal with her daughter, who suffers from schizophrenia. Taking her place permanently is...MICHELLE DESSLER (again played by Reiko Aylesworth). Tony has already returned to CTU for today's events, wanting to help Jack. Over the next few hours, Michelle and Tony begin feeling for each other again.Paul steps in to help Jack as his partner, but Paul gets shot in the process. Hours later, Jack gets a lead at a Chinese company. He heads in to get the Chinese man who has information on Marwan's location, but the Chinese man is shot in the process, but seems as though he can be saved with the right amount of time and care. As Paul goes back into emergency surgeory, Jack comes in with their only possible lead, whereas Paul instantly dies, devastating Audrey, for she just started feeling things for her husband again.Tony goes out on assignment with Jack as extra help, but is kidnapped by a girl named Mandy. Mandy had been a connection to the first season's events, as well as almost killing David Palmer in season two. But Tony gives Jack clues as to where Mandy is taking him. Seems as though CTU is way too smart, for Jack finds Tony and has Mandy arrested. Michelle had been montering and was gonna help get Tony back, but she decided to help save the country, for she did not want to make the same mistake Tony had made, but she is extremely glad in knowing Tony is alive, for they have decided to get back together.Jack has already killed Marwan and stopped his plan to send a missil, exploding the entire U.S. Jack has done this successfully with the help of Tony, Michelle, Audrey, James, and David Palmer. But Jack has been called into the Chinese custody since he has been identified as the one who kidnapped their Chinese leader holding the info on Marwan. But the man sent to pick up Jack is sent to kill Jack. A few bullet fights and Jack is found on the floor...dead. Michelle, Chloe, and Tony arrive at Jack's body, give him CPR, where Jack awakes. Michelle, Tony, and Chloe knew about the man sent from the Chinese place wanting to kill Jack, so the three helped Jack make it look like Jack was murdered, where they help Jack escape, where he'll go on to create himself a new identity. Before he goes on his way, David Palmer calls him one last time to speak to Jack, David's only true best friend.I was disappointed in seeing most of the show's regulars to be missing from the show. But this season kept me on the edge of my seat.

937389,AZVEPWRYOFBX5,B000B837XI,Charity Bishop,"[0, 1]","This season had arguably one of the best endings to the popular series based around attempts to prevent terrorist strikes on homeland property. It's also one of the most gut-wrenching, nail-biting, un-politically-correct shows on television.A train is derailed and a suitcase stolen from one of the passengers, who is then murdered. When a hacker stumbles across lethal information on the internet, he is barely able to pass it along to his friend Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub) at the Counter Terrorist Unit before he is hunted down by Arabs. His disappearance is perpetrated only hours before the kidnapping of Secretary of Defense James Heller ( Logan Marshall-Green) and his daughter Audrey (Kim Raver). Former special agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is placed in command of the recovery operation, but soon discovers it was merely a distraction tactic for other, more deadly intentions. Little does anyone know that Jack and Audrey have been seeing another for several months, while waiting for her divorce to be finalized. Her kidnapping has rejuvenated the interest of her husband Paul (James Frain), who returns hoping to repair their broken marriage and start again.The kidnapping is merely the tip of the iceberg, as Air Force one is intercepted by a seeker missile and sent plunging to earth. The nation is left in the incapable hands of the vice president, who in desperation sends for former President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) to assist him in making the necessary security decisions. Working beneath the radar of CTU, Bauer recruits friend and former operative Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) to assist him in a sleek underground operation to root out the terrorists. Tony's presence becomes something of an issue when his ex-wife, Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth) is brought in to replace the leadership of CTU. Knowing that terrorists nationwide are planning a nuclear strike that will devastate the United States, Bauer must take extreme tactics to unearth the conspirators and stop them before it's too late.Attempting to summarize this season is extremely difficult, because there are a dozen or more main characters, spread out through an equal number of plot lines. The computer programmer whose mother is unable to get out of the way of a nuclear strike. The young Arab boy who realizes the depravity of his evil father only when it requires the death of his innocent Caucasian girlfriend. There is no end to the twists and turns, to kidnappings, assassinations, hostage situations, hold-ups, and near misses. Bauer comes close to catching the bad guys multiple times, only to have them escape through higher intervention, sheer dumb luck, or a political miscalculation. For the most part, with 24 all bets are off. If you think everyone will live through it, think again. If you believe the situation is nearly resolved, take another look.One of the better seasons due to its lack of sexual content, this year brought us numerous heartfelt moments in addition to depictions of hair-raising escapades. I am not a die-hard fan of the series for the simple reason that it promotes a worldview that the outcome makes up for the means of getting there. There are numerous instances of torture tactics, not only used by the terrorists but government operatives as well. People are electrocuted, shot in the leg and have the wound pressed to increase the pain, have their arms broken, and cut with knives. Violence is extreme. Cars are overturned. Fire and explosions consume buildings. Spew of gunfire leaves many dead and others wounded. Women are slapped, punched, and shoved around by angry, evil men. Bauer makes many decisions in the heat of the moment that have devastating consequences for civilians.It is implied Bauer and Audrey are involved in a sexual relationship, despite the fact that her divorce has not yet been finalized. A woman seduces men and murders them and/or uses them to her own evil advantage, but we're only given two ""afterglow"" shots. There's a scattered amount of language. Tony is living with a girl. On the up side, Tony and Michelle work to resolve their issues and repair their broken marriage. It's not something I would recommend to everyone simply because it is such a difficult program to watch, but for lovers of intense drama, 24 is definitely impacting.",3,Parental Review,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,4318,"['season', 'had', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'popular', 'series', 'based', 'attempts', 'prevent', 'terrorist', 'strikes', 'homeland', 'property', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'gut-wrenching', 'nail-biting', 'un-politically-correct', 'shows', 'television.A', 'train', 'derailed', 'suitcase', 'stolen', 'one', 'passengers', 'who', 'then', 'murdered', 'When', 'hacker', 'lethal', 'information', 'internet', 'barely', 'able', 'pass', 'along', 'friend', 'Chloe', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'hunted', 'down', 'Arabs', 'disappearance', 'perpetrated', 'only', 'hours', 'kidnapping', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'Logan', 'Marshall-Green', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'Former', 'special', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'placed', 'command', 'recovery', 'operation', 'soon', 'discovers', 'was', 'merely', 'distraction', 'tactic', 'other', 'more', 'deadly', 'intentions', 'Little', 'anyone', 'know', 'Jack', 'Audrey', 'have', 'been', 'seeing', 'several', 'months', 'waiting', 'divorce', 'be', 'finalized', 'kidnapping', 'rejuvenated', 'interest', 'husband', 'Paul', 'James', 'Frain', 'who', 'hoping', 'repair', 'broken', 'marriage', 'start', 'again.The', 'kidnapping', 'merely', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'Air', 'Force', 'one', 'intercepted', 'seeker', 'missile', 'sent', 'plunging', 'earth', 'nation', 'left', 'incapable', 'hands', 'vice', 'president', 'who', 'desperation', 'sends', 'former', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'assist', 'making', 'necessary', 'security', 'decisions', 'Working', 'radar', 'CTU', 'Bauer', 'friend', 'former', 'operative', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'assist', 'sleek', 'underground', 'operation', 'root', 'out', 'terrorists', 'Tony', 'presence', 'something', 'issue', 'when', 'ex-wife', 'Michelle', 'Dessler', 'Reiko', 'Aylesworth', 'brought', 'replace', 'leadership', 'CTU', 'Knowing', 'terrorists', 'nationwide', 'are', 'planning', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'will', 'devastate', 'United', 'States', 'Bauer', 'must', 'take', 'extreme', 'tactics', 'unearth', 'conspirators', 'stop', 'too', 'late.Attempting', 'summarize', 'season', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'are', 'dozen', 'more', 'main', 'characters', 'spread', 'out', 'equal', 'number', 'plot', 'lines', 'computer', 'programmer', 'mother', 'unable', 'get', 'way', 'nuclear', 'strike', 'young', 'Arab', 'boy', 'who', 'depravity', 'evil', 'father', 'only', 'when', 'death', 'innocent', 'Caucasian', 'girlfriend', 'end', 'twists', 'turns', 'kidnappings', 'assassinations', 'hostage', 'situations', 'hold-ups', 'misses', 'Bauer', 'close', 'catching', 'bad', 'guys', 'multiple', 'times', 'only', 'have', 'escape', 'higher', 'intervention', 'sheer', 'dumb', 'luck', 'political', 'miscalculation', 'most', 'part', '24', 'bets', 'are', 'off', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'live', 'think', 'again', 'believe', 'situation', 'nearly', 'resolved', 'take', 'look.One', 'better', 'seasons', 'due', 'lack', 'sexual', 'content', 'year', 'brought', 'numerous', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'addition', 'depictions', 'hair-raising', 'escapades', 'am', 'not', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'series', 'simple', 'reason', 'worldview', 'outcome', 'up', 'means', 'getting', 'there', 'are', 'numerous', 'instances', 'torture', 'tactics', 'not', 'only', 'used', 'terrorists', 'government', 'operatives', 'as', 'well', 'People', 'are', 'electrocuted', 'shot', 'leg', 'have', 'wound', 'pressed', 'increase', 'pain', 'have', 'arms', 'broken', 'cut', 'knives', 'Violence', 'extreme', 'Cars', 'are', 'overturned', 'Fire', 'explosions', 'consume', 'buildings', 'Spew', 'gunfire', 'many', 'dead', 'others', 'wounded', 'Women', 'are', 'slapped', 'punched', 'shoved', 'angry', 'evil', 'men', 'Bauer', 'many', 'decisions', 'heat', 'moment', 'have', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'civilians.It', 'implied', 'Bauer', 'Audrey', 'are', 'involved', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'fact', 'divorce', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'finalized', 'woman', 'men', 'murders', 'and/or', 'own', 'evil', 'advantage', ""'re"", 'only', 'given', 'two', 'afterglow', 'shots', 'scattered', 'amount', 'language', 'Tony', 'living', 'girl', 'up', 'side', 'Tony', 'Michelle', 'work', 'resolve', 'issues', 'repair', 'broken', 'marriage', 'not', 'something', 'would', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'simply', 'such', 'difficult', 'program', 'watch', 'lovers', 'intense', 'drama', '24', 'definitely', 'impacting']",N/A

Stealing computer software leads you to having ties with Islamic terrorists. Having one night stands leads you to have ties with Islamic terrorists. It is not only OK, but rather expected, that you treat liberals as the enemy. And torture, which shows up in nearly every episode, is the only way to save all of God's children from these Islamic terrorists. Alberto Gonzalez himself could not have cooked up a more rosy picture of torture, but more on that later. Still the show wins fans and awards alike, and completely deserve them both. It is possibly the most entertaining thing on TV, and in the year 2006 that is saying something.What is amazing to me about the show is the way that they are able to continuously create situations for these characters that are both plausible and suspenseful all the while keeping up the break neck pacing that they are so famous for. The very basic premise of this season is so simplistic and over the top. Terrorists (brown of course) are going to steal a nuclear weapon and shoot it at one of the US's main cities. The only hope we useless civilians have is the bravery of Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). There are, as always, a gazillion side plots here and before all is said and done we will have three presidents, the Chinese, Tony Almeida, gay sex, a white suburban girl, a hunt for a ""football,"" the destruction of Air Force One, and that woman from ""House of Sand and Fog"" all involved. One of my favorite twists of this season was the introduction of sworn in President Charles Logan played brilliantly by Gregory Itzin. Logan is a man in way over his head but believes that a little tough talk and a few phony smiles will solve anything. Itzin's performance is at once hilarious and depressing, and I hear he only gets better in season 5. I was also intrigued by the angle early on that involved the son of the terrorists who had the bad fortune of having a white girlfriend. Now the parents were obviously delusional if they thought their son wouldn't get a taste for white meat living in the sanitized suburbs of America. That aside, the scene where his mom is left to poison his girlfriend to get her out of the way is played perfectly on a small, domestic level.But then we have the torture. More than anything it is just stunning how often it shows up. If somebody isn't being tortured, then they are being threatened with torture. If I didn't know any better I would say that the makers of this show have some sort of fetish that involves the intense suffering of others. We also get scene where ""tough guys"" stomp their feet and cry because liberals are obstructing their ability to torture. I also found it in bad taste that the 1 (!) liberal character on the entire show was shown to be weak, whiny, skuzzy all while having ties to terrorism and, of course, being gay. That is because, as all red blooded conservatives know, all liberals are gay. But hey it is their show they can do what they want.

Maybe season 4 would work better with that 7 day break, as I did notice some cracks in the plot this time. Characters seemed to disappear unnaturally (Andrew Paige, Forbes, James Heller) or without satifactory explanation (injured president Keeler). Some became annoyingly unnatural in their conduct (vice-president Logan's behaviour, Audrey Heller's sudden corcern about the torture of a terrorist) etc. It also looked like no one at CTU was tired after 24hours on the job.

937395,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000B837XI,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Even though it's one of the more popular shows on TV, I kind of stopped watching 24 around the start of season 3. After missing a couple of nights and being impatient about episode reruns, I kind of grew out of the show, watching the occasional episode. Being bored and hearing great things about season 4, on a complete whim I decided to buy the season and sure enough I got my money's worth. While it does have some non-nagging issues, it's compelling TV anyways.Fired from CTU, Jack Bauer is now the advisor for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller while in a long relationship with Heller's daughter, Audrey. But he gets called into action when a train derails and Heller and Audrey are abducted by a terrorist faction. He quickly gets pulled back into CTU in trying to find the perpetrators and finds that the terrorist's leader has a lot more planned than a kidnapping.Despite the fact it's one of the more compelling shows on TV, it's also one of the more difficult to revisit. On first viewing, you are hooked, period watching most likely several episodes or in my case, several discs at once. However since you already know how cliffhangers and plot threads will play out, you're more watching it for fun rather than an urge to find out what happens next. Not to mention because it's a season-long story and not mini-stories a la CSI or Law and Order, it makes the show difficult for specific episode watching. You might go ""man that one part with that firefight, that was cool!"" but you'd go ""wait, what episode was that on anyway""? But then again you're so completely enthralled you probably wouldn't care after awhile.The show also requires massive suspension of disbelief as you're almost quite sure not this much can happen in this time, let alone this quickly. Leads immediately connect to each other in record time and then of course there's a larger plot than just a kidnapping which makes you wonder if the season's main villain is just super intelligent or really lucky. But you knew that about 24 already right? As long as it'll be good TV, it'll work and luckily for us, they find ways to make it work.I'm not sure if it's the best season since I haven't really watched most of them but despite its questionable rewatch value and the incredulous events, no show can hook many a viewer than 24.",5,Can too much happen in one day?,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,2316,"['Even', 'one', 'more', 'popular', 'shows', 'TV', 'kind', 'stopped', 'watching', '24', 'start', 'season', '3', 'missing', 'couple', 'nights', 'being', 'impatient', 'episode', 'reruns', 'kind', 'grew', 'show', 'watching', 'occasional', 'episode', 'Being', 'bored', 'hearing', 'great', 'things', 'season', '4', 'complete', 'whim', 'decided', 'buy', 'season', 'sure', 'enough', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'have', 'non-nagging', 'issues', 'compelling', 'TV', 'anyways.Fired', 'CTU', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'now', 'advisor', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'long', 'relationship', 'Heller', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'called', 'action', 'when', 'train', 'derails', 'Heller', 'Audrey', 'are', 'abducted', 'terrorist', 'faction', 'quickly', 'pulled', 'back', 'CTU', 'trying', 'find', 'perpetrators', 'terrorist', 'leader', 'lot', 'more', 'planned', 'kidnapping.Despite', 'fact', 'one', 'more', 'compelling', 'shows', 'TV', 'also', 'one', 'more', 'difficult', 'revisit', 'first', 'viewing', 'are', 'hooked', 'period', 'watching', 'most', 'likely', 'several', 'episodes', 'case', 'several', 'discs', 'once', 'However', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'cliffhangers', 'plot', 'threads', 'will', 'play', 'out', ""'re"", 'more', 'watching', 'fun', 'rather', 'urge', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'Not', 'mention', 'season-long', 'story', 'not', 'mini-stories', 'la', 'CSI', 'Law', 'Order', 'show', 'difficult', 'specific', 'episode', 'watching', 'might', 'go', 'man', 'one', 'part', 'firefight', 'was', 'cool', ""'d"", 'go', 'wait', 'what', 'episode', 'was', 'anyway', 'then', 'again', ""'re"", 'so', 'completely', 'enthralled', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'awhile.The', 'show', 'also', 'massive', 'suspension', 'disbelief', ""'re"", 'almost', 'quite', 'sure', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'happen', 'time', 'let', 'alone', 'quickly', 'Leads', 'immediately', 'connect', 'other', 'record', 'time', 'then', 'course', 'larger', 'plot', 'just', 'kidnapping', 'wonder', 'season', 'main', 'villain', 'just', 'super', 'intelligent', 'really', 'lucky', 'knew', '24', 'already', 'right', 'As', 'long', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'TV', ""'ll"", 'work', 'luckily', 'find', 'ways', 'make', 'work.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'best', 'season', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'watched', 'most', 'questionable', 'rewatch', 'value', 'incredulous', 'events', 'show', 'can', 'hook', 'many', 'viewer', '24']",N/A

I mean, come on... just how can Jack really get across L.A. traffic in like 5 minutes anyway?  Just ONCE I would like to see an entire episode devoted to Jack stuck in rush hour traffic having to rely solely on cellular communications with CTU but then again, that does not make for suspenseful television now does it? ;)  Or how about devoting one episode with Jack on his lunch hour?  Nope.  This guy never eats nor sleeps nor requires a restroom break of any kind because he is JACK F---ING BAUER!I made a pact with my friend.  I agreed to watch Season 4 if he would agree to watch Lost.  It only took me a week to burn through Season 4 and I have had so much fun that any doubts I had about 24 as an enjoyable series have been completely erased.  Jack Bauer is the real deal.  He makes Jason Bourne look like an amateur.  Kiefer Sutherland is so intense and so focused every minute he is on screen that you believe that the peril he is facing, no matter how ridiculously contrived, is real.What makes season 4 the best day yet is due mostly to its perfect chemistry of suspenseful plot twists, frenetic pacing and editing, interactive character development and explosive action.  The writers seemed more concerned this season with creating jaw-dropping ""I can't believe they just did that!"" action than focusing on the soap opera-ish melodrama that watered down previous seasons.  While Elisha Cuthbert's Kim Bauer is pleasing to the eye to look at, thankfully she is out of the picture here so Jack can stay focused on his most intense day ever without the juvenile distractions.  Still, there are a few breaks in the action where our characters get caught up in their personal feelings and rivalries getting in the way of their professional judgments that make for a few brief groaners but are quickly subdued by the more immediate threats at hand.Arnold Vosloo from The Mummy is this season's main baddy and he is the perfect intellectual foil for Jack Bauer.  He is always one step ahead of Jack who struggles desperately to keep up with Habib Marwan's diabolical acts of terrorism.  The most surprising thing is that Marwan, more often than not, succeeds and leaves the viewer with their jaw hanging wide open in disbelief.This season features the return of familiar characters from earlier seasons including Tony Almeida, Michelle Dessler, Mike Novick, and CTU nerds Chloe O'Brien and newbie Edgar Stiles.  We are also introduced to several new faces at CTU including Curtis Manning, Erin Driscoll and Bill Buchanan.  Kim Raver is Jack's love interest Audrey Raines and her father, Secretary of Defense James Heller, is played by Rolling Thunder himself... William Devane.  After spending a real-time day in crisis with these characters you'll feel like they are all members of the immediate family.Sean Callery's rousing and adrenaline pumping electronic score is the perfect compliment to the onscreen action and elevates the level of suspense faster than mercury rising in a thermometer.  Not since Mark Snow's electronic cues for X-Files has there been a more perfect accompaniment of incidental music to parallel the onscreen action.24 Season 4 is more entertaining and suspenseful than most blockbuster action films and has cast the die for other series and films to follow in its aftermath.  Bruce Willis' John McClane may have inaugurated the age of the everyman action hero, but Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer has taken heroism beyond the call of duty and has redefined, by very definition, the ideal Action Star.  At a time of political unrest and uncertainty in this country and the threat of terrorism abroad, one cannot help but feel a sense of restored patriotism by Jack's heroic deeds.  Indeed, Jack Bauer has become a Real American Hero.",5,Another really bad day for Jack turns out to be his very best day ever!,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,3988,"['have', 'admit', 'initially', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'show', 'thought', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'entertaining', 'required', 'SEVERE', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'especially', 'regards', 'real-time', 'premise', 'show', 'format', 'mean', 'come', 'just', 'how', 'can', 'Jack', 'really', 'get', 'L.A.', 'traffic', '5', 'minutes', 'anyway', 'Just', 'ONCE', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'entire', 'episode', 'devoted', 'Jack', 'stuck', 'rush', 'hour', 'traffic', 'having', 'rely', 'solely', 'cellular', 'communications', 'CTU', 'then', 'again', 'not', 'make', 'suspenseful', 'television', 'now', 'how', 'devoting', 'one', 'episode', 'Jack', 'lunch', 'hour', 'Nope', 'guy', 'never', 'sleeps', 'restroom', 'break', 'kind', 'JACK', 'F', '-ING', 'made', 'pact', 'friend', 'agreed', 'watch', 'Season', '4', 'would', 'agree', 'watch', 'Lost', 'only', 'took', 'week', 'burn', 'Season', '4', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'doubts', 'had', 'about', '24', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'erased', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'real', 'deal', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'look', 'amateur', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'so', 'intense', 'so', 'focused', 'minute', 'screen', 'believe', 'peril', 'facing', 'matter', 'how', 'ridiculously', 'contrived', 'real.What', 'season', '4', 'best', 'day', 'yet', 'due', 'mostly', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'twists', 'frenetic', 'pacing', 'editing', 'interactive', 'character', 'development', 'explosive', 'action', 'writers', 'seemed', 'more', 'concerned', 'season', 'creating', 'jaw-dropping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'just', 'did', 'action', 'focusing', 'soap', 'opera-ish', 'melodrama', 'watered', 'down', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Elisha', 'Cuthbert', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'look', 'thankfully', 'picture', 'here', 'so', 'Jack', 'can', 'stay', 'focused', 'most', 'intense', 'day', 'ever', 'juvenile', 'distractions', 'Still', 'are', 'few', 'breaks', 'action', 'where', 'characters', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'personal', 'feelings', 'rivalries', 'getting', 'way', 'professional', 'judgments', 'make', 'few', 'brief', 'groaners', 'are', 'quickly', 'subdued', 'more', 'immediate', 'threats', 'hand.Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'Mummy', 'season', 'main', 'baddy', 'perfect', 'intellectual', 'foil', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'Jack', 'who', 'desperately', 'keep', 'up', 'Habib', 'Marwan', 'diabolical', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'Marwan', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'viewer', 'jaw', 'hanging', 'wide', 'open', 'disbelief.This', 'season', 'return', 'familiar', 'characters', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'including', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Michelle', 'Dessler', 'Mike', 'Novick', 'CTU', 'nerds', 'Chloe', ""O'Brien"", 'newbie', 'Edgar', 'Stiles', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'several', 'new', 'CTU', 'including', 'Curtis', 'Manning', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'Bill', 'Buchanan', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'Jack', 'love', 'interest', 'Audrey', 'Raines', 'father', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'played', 'Rolling', 'Thunder', 'William', 'Devane', 'spending', 'real-time', 'day', 'crisis', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'are', 'members', 'immediate', 'family.Sean', 'Callery', 'rousing', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'electronic', 'score', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'onscreen', 'action', 'level', 'suspense', 'faster', 'mercury', 'rising', 'thermometer', 'Not', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'electronic', 'cues', 'X-Files', 'there', 'been', 'more', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'incidental', 'music', 'parallel', 'onscreen', 'action.24', 'Season', '4', 'more', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'films', 'cast', 'die', 'other', 'series', 'films', 'follow', 'aftermath', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'John', 'McClane', 'may', 'have', 'inaugurated', 'age', 'everyman', 'action', 'hero', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'taken', 'heroism', 'call', 'duty', 'redefined', 'very', 'definition', 'ideal', 'Action', 'Star', 'time', 'political', 'unrest', 'uncertainty', 'country', 'threat', 'terrorism', 'abroad', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'sense', 'restored', 'patriotism', 'Jack', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'Indeed', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'become', 'Real', 'American', 'Hero']",N/A

937405,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000B837XI,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[2, 2]","24 began its life on television accompanied by the faint whiff of gimmicky desperation, not unlike fellow Fox show Prison Break, which is becoming increasingly unsatisfying. A strange thing happened, though. Instead of being constrained by the format - which, for those uninitiated, follows the action in more or less real time, with each episode detailing one hour in a single, hectic and action-oriented day - the difference from other dramatic serial conventions helped eventually spawn fresh new approaches to storytelling and sustained a show that has grown surprisingly substantive in its emotional depth.As disgraced (now former) Counter Terrorist Unit agent Jack Bauer - who really should get together with Die Hard's John McClane at some point for a top-this, roundtable discussion of occupational highs and lows - Kiefer Sutherland has found what is undeniably the best role of his career. Equally impressive, though, is the manner in which he has both grown and settled into it as the series progresses, evincing new layers of complexity, coarseness and sublimated feeling.The fourth season of 24 begins with creator Joel Surnow and Michael Loceff's superlative episode, in which the explosion of a train in the California desert serves as the cover for a snatch-and-grab. Blunt Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane, subbing nicely for Donald Rumsfeld) and his married daughter Audrey (Kim Raver), who's having a clandestine affair with Jack, are both kidnapped, and it's not long before a dangerous virus code on the Internet is linked to the attacks and America's nuclear reactors are teetering on the brink of meltdown. As these larger implications and ramifications of the kidnapping are exposed, a new and more ominous plot is revealed, with a family of Turkish immigrants, fronted by Navi and Dina Araz (Nestor Serrano and Shohreh Aghdashloo), at the center of an extremist Muslim terror cell. With both Jack and the CTU racing to figure out the terrorists' true objective, it becomes clear that the events of this day have been years in the making - and only a miracle will prevent the scheduled attacks that the terrorists believe will bring the United States to its knees.Apart from its sterling production values, one of the most impressive things about re-watching 24 is the manner in which it sows the seeds for future dramatic tension - in this case with Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin), an ineffectual veep unprepared to inherit the mantle of the presidency. Some of the plot twists are a bit overly florid - the result of having to pack each hour with its own peaks and valleys - and the occasional re-introduction of supporting characters from past seasons reeks of attempted ratings manipulation, but the show overall delivers on a consistently high basis.Distributor 20th Century Fox continues to do right by television fans, releasing superlative sets of both its new and catalogue properties. This seven-disc set's gatefold packaging is a bit ridiculous, the tapeworm of DVD presentation. But an exclusive prequel nicely bridges the fourth and fifth seasons of the show (the latter being on the air now), and the usual clutch of production featurettes, actor and filmmaker commentaries, deleted and extended scenes and more all nicely round out this release.",5,24 Season 4 (DVD),1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3300,"['24', 'began', 'life', 'television', 'accompanied', 'faint', 'whiff', 'gimmicky', 'desperation', 'not', 'fellow', 'Fox', 'show', 'Prison', 'Break', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'unsatisfying', 'strange', 'thing', 'happened', 'though', 'Instead', 'being', 'constrained', 'format', 'uninitiated', 'action', 'more', 'less', 'real', 'time', 'episode', 'detailing', 'one', 'hour', 'single', 'hectic', 'action-oriented', 'day', 'difference', 'other', 'dramatic', 'serial', 'conventions', 'helped', 'eventually', 'spawn', 'fresh', 'new', 'approaches', 'storytelling', 'sustained', 'show', 'grown', 'surprisingly', 'substantive', 'emotional', 'depth.As', 'disgraced', 'now', 'former', 'Counter', 'Terrorist', 'Unit', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'together', 'Die', 'Hard', 'John', 'McClane', 'point', 'top-this', 'roundtable', 'discussion', 'occupational', 'highs', 'lows', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'found', 'what', 'undeniably', 'best', 'role', 'career', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'though', 'manner', 'grown', 'settled', 'series', 'evincing', 'new', 'layers', 'complexity', 'coarseness', 'sublimated', 'feeling.The', 'fourth', 'season', '24', 'begins', 'creator', 'Joel', 'Surnow', 'Michael', 'Loceff', 'superlative', 'episode', 'explosion', 'train', 'California', 'desert', 'serves', 'cover', 'snatch-and-grab', 'Blunt', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'William', 'Devane', 'subbing', 'nicely', 'Donald', 'Rumsfeld', 'married', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'who', 'having', 'clandestine', 'affair', 'Jack', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'not', 'long', 'dangerous', 'virus', 'code', 'Internet', 'linked', 'attacks', 'America', 'nuclear', 'reactors', 'are', 'teetering', 'brink', 'meltdown', 'larger', 'implications', 'ramifications', 'kidnapping', 'are', 'exposed', 'new', 'more', 'ominous', 'plot', 'revealed', 'family', 'Turkish', 'immigrants', 'fronted', 'Navi', 'Dina', 'Araz', 'Nestor', 'Serrano', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'center', 'extremist', 'Muslim', 'terror', 'cell', 'Jack', 'CTU', 'racing', 'figure', 'out', 'terrorists', 'true', 'objective', 'clear', 'events', 'day', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'making', 'only', 'miracle', 'will', 'prevent', 'scheduled', 'attacks', 'terrorists', 'believe', 'will', 'bring', 'United', 'States', 'knees.Apart', 'sterling', 'production', 'values', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'things', 're-watching', '24', 'manner', 'seeds', 'future', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'case', 'Charles', 'Logan', 'Gregory', 'Itzin', 'ineffectual', 'veep', 'unprepared', 'inherit', 'mantle', 'presidency', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'bit', 'overly', 'florid', 'result', 'having', 'pack', 'hour', 'own', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'occasional', 're-introduction', 'supporting', 'characters', 'past', 'seasons', 'reeks', 'attempted', 'ratings', 'manipulation', 'show', 'overall', 'delivers', 'consistently', 'high', 'basis.Distributor', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'do', 'right', 'television', 'fans', 'releasing', 'superlative', 'sets', 'new', 'catalogue', 'properties', 'seven-disc', 'set', 'gatefold', 'packaging', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'tapeworm', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'exclusive', 'prequel', 'nicely', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'show', 'latter', 'being', 'air', 'now', 'usual', 'clutch', 'production', 'featurettes', 'actor', 'filmmaker', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'more', 'nicely', 'round', 'out', 'release']",N/A

As always, Bauer managed to save the day. But instead of getting a medal, Bauer got the axe and was dismissed from his position as head of field operations at CTU Los Angeles.Over a year later, Bauer has found a new life for himself working for Secretary of Defense, James Heller (William Devane). More importantly, Jack has discovered that away from CTU, he has the freedom to pursue a serious relationship. He soon finds himself in love- with Heller's not-quite divorced daughter Audrey (Kim Raver). Just as he's getting comfortable in Washington, Jack finds himself back at CTU meeting with Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson), the woman who fired him. It soon becomes apparent that Jack's boss and the woman he loves are going to be the targets of a terrorist strike. And as long as they are in danger, Jack Bauer insists on working with CTU to save them- whether his help is wanted or not! As Jack races to rescue Audrey and Secretary Heller, it becomes clearer and clearer that their abduction is only part of what the terrorists have planned for the day- the worst is yet to come!It's safe to say that Season Four is probably the worst of the series thus far. There's no shortage of new faces on the series, most of whom don't last for very long which makes for a disjointed season. That being said, the worst 24 has to offer is still edge-of-your-seat entertainment that blows away just about all of the competition (except for maybe The Shield). And the ending of Season 4 (which I won't get in to) is good enough that it almost makes up for any flaws the season might have.Like the Season 3 DVD, Season 4 is packed with a disc worth of special features, chief among them the deleted scenes, an inside look at the designing of a new CTU set, and a prequel to Season 5 .24, the Complete Fourth Season also stars Carlos Bernard, Reiko Aylesworth, Roger Cross, Lana Parilla, and Dennis Haysbert.",4,24's worst; 2005's best,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,2075,"['When', 'last', 'saw', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'had', 'become', 'junkie', 'order', 'bring', 'down', 'Mexican', 'drug', 'lord', 'stop', 'deadly', 'virus', 'being', 'unleashed', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'always', 'Bauer', 'managed', 'save', 'day', 'instead', 'getting', 'medal', 'Bauer', 'got', 'axe', 'was', 'dismissed', 'position', 'head', 'field', 'operations', 'CTU', 'Los', 'Angeles.Over', 'year', 'later', 'Bauer', 'found', 'new', 'life', 'working', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'William', 'Devane', 'More', 'importantly', 'Jack', 'discovered', 'away', 'CTU', 'freedom', 'pursue', 'serious', 'relationship', 'soon', 'love-', 'Heller', 'not-quite', 'divorced', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'Just', 'getting', 'comfortable', 'Washington', 'Jack', 'back', 'CTU', 'meeting', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'woman', 'who', 'fired', 'soon', 'apparent', 'Jack', 'boss', 'woman', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'targets', 'terrorist', 'strike', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'danger', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'working', 'CTU', 'save', 'them-', 'help', 'wanted', 'not', 'Jack', 'rescue', 'Audrey', 'Secretary', 'Heller', 'clearer', 'clearer', 'abduction', 'only', 'part', 'what', 'terrorists', 'have', 'planned', 'day-', 'worst', 'yet', 'come', 'safe', 'say', 'Season', 'Four', 'probably', 'worst', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'shortage', 'new', 'series', 'most', 'whom', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'very', 'long', 'disjointed', 'season', 'being', 'said', 'worst', '24', 'offer', 'still', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'entertainment', 'away', 'just', 'competition', 'maybe', 'Shield', 'ending', 'Season', '4', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'enough', 'almost', 'up', 'flaws', 'season', 'might', 'have.Like', 'Season', '3', 'DVD', 'Season', '4', 'packed', 'disc', 'worth', 'special', 'features', 'chief', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'inside', 'look', 'designing', 'new', 'CTU', 'set', 'prequel', 'Season', '5', '.24', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'also', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'Reiko', 'Aylesworth', 'Roger', 'Cross', 'Lana', 'Parilla', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert']",N/A

The toll of his job keeping the nation safe from terrorism has worn on him deeply, as have the numerous losses and addictions he has endured as part of his job.At the Start of the shows 4th season, Jack seems to have put much of this behind him, as he has left C.T.U. in order to work for the Secretary of Defense. The fact that Jack has secretly been seeing the soon to be divorced daughter of the Secretary has seemingly put his life on track leaving his troubled past behind him.This all changes when the Secretary and his daughter are kidnapped by terrorists who threaten to kill them both if their demands are not met. Before long Jack is drawn back into C.T.U. in an effort to save them, and soon realizes that the kidnapping is just the tip of the iceberg in what is going to be another very deadly and long day for Jack.The 4th season of the show grabs you from the opening moments and never lets go. After 3 seasons, the real time concept has only grown stronger and the show has become even more addictive and topical with each passing year.

While Jack Bauer is one tough dude, he does have a kind heart, not saying Jason didn't.What many may  relate to, while putting themselves into a fiction movie or book,  most likely depends on their own life experiences. Whether we're from a military family, a nuclear facility family, etc. I don't view 24 as strictly a &#34;guy&#34; series. Many can  likely relate to the strong rolls written for &#34;women&#34; in 24, especially Season 4. The Driscoll character reflects what she has to deal with in a highly professional position that is in crises mode  while going through A personal life. Trying to separate the two & the results of her actions/inactions may cause us to ask ourselves; what would we do?. I didn't care for Driscoll, at first, but as the story rolls along many women may relate to her conundrum.The nuclear reactor story line in Season 4; many may or may not relate to as a realistic possibility. What goes on behind the scenes; we the people may not realize the actions taken to keep us & our country safe. Many have experienced the classified information that is never broadcast through the  media to prevent mass panic.While I felt Season 4 started out a little slower than other seasons, it felt real.

Taking matters into his own hands, Jack peforms intensive interogation tactics on a suspect. Once the prisoner breaks, Bauer learns that the U.S. Secretary of Defense has been targeted. And Jack has only a few minutes to counter-act the abduction....This season is by far from being the best out of the series. Kiefer Sutherland gives an outstanding performance, but the story is just not as well put together as previous ones have been. Once again, the writers tried to out-do the previous year by having tons of incidents for the characters to go through. These are interesting, but there are so many of them; that the show really looses its once film feel. This season is really episodic in its storylines. Even more characters are added and perform really needless actions. They are really there to just take up time. The sad part to this season are the conflicts Jack and his colleges go through. They are basicilly recycled material from the past three years with slight differences in the cause and effect aspects. The highlight to this season is the heart pounding return of the assassin Mandy.

That is no surprise since it has set such a high standard for television drama. So instead of being superlative, it is merely great.There are new characters and new leaders in this season along with some old standbys. There are also some old villains making surprise appearances. With the new cast, they combine for a powerful season and, as always, it is a season full of plot twists and unexpected surprises.There are many out there who condemn 24 as a show that marginalizes Muslims. This season indeed has some nasty Muslim villains. I wonder if those same detractors noticed that some of the real heroes of this season are Muslims as well...and some of the worst villains are Anglo-American males. The point this series makes over and over again is that people who do bad things are bad and their religion has nothing to do with it.Episode synopses appear below:7-8 AM The season starts of with a whimper that quickly develops into a bang. Jack Bauer has not been back to CTU since he was fired. Today, he is supposed to go there with the Secretary of Defense to meet with the current director about the budget. The Secretary is unable to go and sends Jack in his stead. The new director does NOT like having him around and is more interested in turf control than in anything useful. While there, Jack gets to witness the takedown of some suspects in the bombing of a train. He recognizes one of them and suspects more is in store. The director will not listen to him, however. Jack takes matters into his own hands and extracts the information violently. The train was a diversion. The real target is the father of his lover, the Secretary of Defense. Jack is just placing the call when the man and the girl are kidnapped.8-9 AM  The new director at CTU is still more worried about protecting her turf than in doing her job. She wants to do her job but doing it in a way that reflects well on her is more important. As such, she arrests Jack because he did not follow the rules. He gets a break from Chloe who still trusts him more than her. He learns that a friend of hers has stumbled onto a possible link involving an Internet virus. She had told the director about it earlier but had been shuffled aside. Now, her source's family have been killed and Jack gets the OK to try and bring him in. He's too late. Other people are in trouble too. The terrorist leader has his teenaged son act as a courier to take a briefcase to a meet. He is followed by his suspicious American girlfriend. As a result, the boy is in trouble and the girl is probably going to be eliminated. It is apparent that there are lots of leaks and that the bad guys are getting their information from the inside but nobody knows where yet. As the hour closes, an internet broadcast shows the Secretary of Defense. The bad guys are preparing to execute him live on the web.9-10 AM Jack is following the guy who kidnapped the web geek but is doing so without authorization. In fact, CTU wants him brought in. He manages to rescue the guy in the nick of time and heads off after the terrorist who leaves him for dead. He is still having trouble getting the resources he needs and only Chloe is serving as a sort of go between for him and officialdom. Meanwhile, the teenage terrorist is torn up with angst about his American girlfriend. His father wants he dead. He goes to his mom for help only to learn that she has lured the girl over in order to do the whacking herself. Jack is still trying to follow his terrorist but he has to find a way to delay him while Chloe get satellite coverage set up. He is running out of time so he does the only thing he can to slow the guy down without arousing suspicion. He knocks over (robs) the convenience store the terrorist is using to get something to drink. It's LA. Its believable.10-11 AM It's a tense standoff as Jack tries to rob a convenience store. He is doing it only to buy time until a satellite can be tasked to follow the terrorist. It seems, though, that just about everyone wants to visit that convenience store at that time. Finally, he learns that the satellite has been set up and he breaks out with the terrorist as his hostage. He lets the terrorist go in the hopes that he will lead him to the missing Secretary. Unfortunately the CTU director has found out about the scheme and sends the police to home in on Jack. She is about to pick up the terrorist too but it is pointed out to her that too many people already know that Jack was right and she was wrong. She's a bit distracted, though. She learns that her schizophrenic daughter is busy having a breakdown and she reroutes resources to prevent her daughter from being arrested. The teen terrorist makes a big decision to go with the girlfriend rather than the parents but his mom has anticipated him. She solves the problem herself. Jack is hot on the trail until he is taken into custody by the police.11-Noon  Jack manages to get the CTU director to vouch for him and put him in command of a team going after the Secretary. He is closing in when a traffic stop blows the program. The terrorist is let go too easily so he gets suspicious and kills himself before he can be captured and questioned. Jack still has a hint of where they are going. He is ready to lead a strike team but is called off because the ""trial"" is getting too close. In order to avoid embarrassment, the President has decided to send in a missile to take out the whole site. The pres is not the only untrustworthy character. The CTU director is still too worried about turf and uses this instance to begin a purge; a contract laborer in CTU is clearly out to advance herself at everyone else's expense; a psychotic daughter is distracting the CTU director and, just to keep things tense, the terror kid who was having second thoughts is apparently over them.12-1 PM Jack's one man assault is successful is rescuing the Secretary and his daughter but a few get away. They learn that the train wreck from the first episode was just a diversion for the kidnapping. Worse, they have reason to believe that the kidnapping is just a diversion for worse things to come. They need information but those who can provide it are reticent about doing so. Among these is the estranged son of the Secretary. With great pain, the Secretary authorizes more serious questioning techniques. Leaks are still plaguing the CTU. The contract hacker is apparently working for someone else. The Terror teen learns that his own father considered him to be a risk and has authorized his execution. This pleases neither the teen nor the mom.1-2 PM The Secretary's daughter needs to be taken to a private security firm to try and ID one of the terrorists who took her; she remembers seeing him at a party they both attended and the firm has the tapes. Unfortunately, the mole in CTU sets them up for a hit. They barely make it out because Jack realizes the he can no longer trust CTU. He calls somebody he can trust, Tony, from the previous seasons. The terror mom decides to try and save the terror teen but the terror dad suspects. He ambushes them and now they are fugitives. From this we learn that the terror dad is reporting to somebody even higher up who is not happy. Also not happy is the CTU director. Her daughter goes into cardiac arrest when the wrong drugs are given. To ease the tension some, one of CTU's programmers manages to find a way to shut down the nuclear power plants that are threatened. Unfortunately, he is not able to get them all.2-3 PM Jack finally has a lead as to who can shut down the nuclear disaster. The Secretary also manages to use his assets to track down the mole in CTU. Unfortunately, it is the wrong person. This is not found out before some...aggressive questioning takes place. Luckily, they do manage to find the right mole and she tries to make her escape. She is apprehended just as she learns her controller wants her dead. That seems to be the case for Jack's prisoner to. Just as they get him, he is assassinated. Terror mom and terror teen are not having much better luck. Because of her wounds, they head for an ER but there the police are called because she has a gunshot wound. They too get away.3-4 PM CTU has had its biggest leads assassinated out from under them but they get lucky when they manage to trace the location of the cell phone of Terror Mom and Terror Teen. They break in and take the mom into custody and just barely manage to keep her from killing herself. Unfortunately, Terror Teen is out at a hospital trying to get some pain medication for mom. He is talking to his uncle, a pharmacist at the hospital. The uncle is suspicious and not a terrorist. He calls Terror Dad who tells him that jr. is a druggie. CTU heads to pick the boy up but gets there only in time to wind up in a standoff. Dad has his gun pointed at the boy. The mother, who has brokered a clemency deal for the boy, refuses to talk unless the boy is safe. With that, the episode is over.4-5 PM  Jack manages to take both the terror teen and the terror dad alive. His plans break apart, though, on two fronts. Terror teen is still hacked off about dad ordering him to be killed so he takes an opportunistic shot and settles dad for good. Unfortunately, terror mom does not really no a whole lot. All she is able to give them is an address. When it is investigated, they find a new lead that leads right back to the Secretary of Defense and his daughter. Another lead comes from the interrogation of the mole captured at CTU. She is still trying to slime her way into a better position and reveals the existence of a computer where she might get some useful data. The catch is that she has to be present to give her thumbprint to the security program. Against many people's better judgment, she is taken to the site under escort. What they find is surprising and quite unhealthy. The CTU director is coming to grips with not being in Jack Bauer's league. She compensates by getting even more protective and devious about her turf.5-6 PM CTU finally homes in on where the nuclear gizmo is located. To do so, they have had to violate lots and lots of civil rights. These include the rights of such persons as the husband of Jack's girlfriend. She is beginning to believe him and he MAY be innocent, but that is still up in the air. As they close in, the CTU director's daughter becomes more and more of a distraction with terrible consequences for everyone. CTU manages to shut down the nuclear meltdowns. They do so at the cost of letting the ostensible mastermind escape. The season is only half over. More is definitely to come.6-7 PM CTU is trying to get things sorted out after averting a nuclear meltdown but the situation is chaos. The director is incapacitated by the apparent suicide of her daughter and Tony is tasked to fill in. Jack and the soon-to-be ex hubby of the Secretary head for the company that unknowingly employed the head terrorist. They want to track him down and see if he has anything else up his sleeve. The problem is that the company is paranoid that they will somehow be blamed for the fiasco. They undertake to try and deceive CTU and destroy any data on the premises. Taking out several square miles of downtown LA does not seem to bother them.7-8 PM The plot has certainly thickened. The EMP bomb has meant chaos in downtown LA. Most of the episode is concerned with Jack and his romantic rival trying to get extricated while mercenaries from the company that set off the bomb try and track them down. The get help from the young, middle eastern gun store owners whose store they hole up in. (Anyone claiming that middle eastern=terrorist should see this episode to set the record straight.) Since CTU is working blind, Jack knows that his only hope is to attract their attention. He does so by engaging the mercs in a firefight. They survive and are rescued and have a vital printout to get back to CTU for decoding when one of the bad guys, (Anglo male) makes a last effort to kill Jack. He gets the jilted husband instead. This is a shame since he has shown himself to be a good guy and since the girlfriend will probably be really hacked. The episode closes with the revelation of what might be the real target. There is none bigger.8-9 PM CTU still does not know what the big plan is but they know that there is one. In a desperate attempt to get information, Jack comes up with a scheme to get himself turned over to the bad guys by the terror mom. He talks her into it by promising to get her and her son into the witness protection program. She does her job and gets him to the head honcho but he is suspicious. When she fails his loyalty test, she and Jack are in big trouble. Meanwhile, a fake fighter pilot is getting ready to take to the air.9-10 PM  Jack is a prisoner and CTU still does not know what the big picture is. The terror plot continues, though as an infiltrated pilot prepares to go airborne with a stolen F-117. Because of a few glitches, a diversion is needed so that CTU will not notice the missing pilot. The head terrorist contrives a plot in which the terror teen is exchanged for Jack. Seeing nothing else to do, they go through with it but nothing goes as it should. Jack is recovered but the boy is taken. The pilot is about to launch and they still don't know what the plot is.10-11 PM The pilot is in the air and his target is a big one but CTU does not know what it is. They head to his apartment to find clues and encounter a woman posing as an FBI agent. They think she is legit but she is hunting for the same information they are. When Jack figures out what is going on, he notifies the target but not before it is hit. It is unsure whether the target survived.11 - Midnight  The president is alive but in no condition to lead the country. That puts the succession on the vice president which poses 2 problems. He seems to be a weak man to begin with and his chief of staff is the slimeball who caused so much trouble for the last administration. Meanwhile, Jack is sent out to rescue the football, the briefcase containing the nuclear codes. It has been found by some innocent campers but the head terrorist wants them. It seems knocking off Air Force One was just a pretext to get the codes. Jack manages to rescue the football but there is something missing.12-1 AM A lucky lead gives CTU the identity of an associate of the mastermind. They manage to close in just as the suspect is meeting with another unsavory character. Mr. Unsavory kills the terrorist as CTU closes in and claims to have been an innocent citizen defending himself. Everyone knows this is wrong so they get ready to do some intensive interrogation. That is just what the mastermind is afraid of and he places a discreet call to the ACLU types who get a court order to stop the interrogation. Since a nuclear warhead has been stolen, time is of the essence but the weak VP does not want to cloud the first act of his paranoid presidency. Jack decides to take the interrogation into his own hands by resigning from CTU and acting as a private citizen. He gets his information but it is doubtful whether it is enough.1-2 AM Chloe become a field agent!...but that comes later. The president is hacked about Jack doing things independently and orders the Secret Service to pick him up immediately, even though he is warned that Jack is about to get the mastermind. He has been tracked to a club where he is running his operation. The Secret Service shows up at the worse possible time and tips off the terrorists to police presence. He gets away. This leads the president to realize that he may not be the best man for the job. His chief of staff advises him to call in the previous president to run the situation. (Maybe the guy did learn his lesson.) Chloe gets a tip from the suspicious girlfriend of one of the terrorists. Because they are shorthanded, CTU sends her out with a team to decode the information on the computer. Real agents are supposed to protect her but the bad guys eliminate them. Chloe has to take matters into her own hands with deadly results.2-3 AM From Chloe's lead, CTU finds a connection to a Chinese national who has holed up in the consulate. The Chinese are willing to cooperate but diplomatic niceties take time...longer that the timetable for detonation of the warhead. The former president authorizes a clandestine operation to go into the consulate and take the man by force. This happens but the ""Chinese Fire Drill"" of the guards causes problems. In their wild shooting, they not only put a bullet into the terror suspect, they manage to kill their own consul. The diplomatic consequences are going to be grim. For Jack, it gets grimmer still. The suspect is dying and needs immediate surgery. Unfortunately, the surgeon is currently working on the husband of his girlfriend. Since the information is vital to many lives, Jack pulls his gun and forces the surgeon to work on the suspect with fatal consequences for the husband...and Jack's love life.3-4 AM The Chinese are furious over the break in of their consulate and they want blood. Unfortunately, their cameras reveal the possible face of one of the CTU agents and the Chinese head of security demands an interview at CTU. CTU does a fair job of stonewalling but is hampered by the acting president, who no longer trusts former president Palmer, and by the need to appease the Chinese. Just when it looks like the Chinese will get no further information, an analyst lets something slip. While this is going on, Jack is in the field. Interrogation has at last yielded the location of the terror mastermind. They bring him down only learn that the stolen warhead had been mounted on a missile and the missile has just launched.4-5 AM While going through the mastermind's cell phone, CTU finds a connection. His phone contains the number of the son of the Secretary of Defense, who has not been heard from since the first few episodes. They bring the boy in blubbering about his rights but he will not say what he knows; only that he is not a terrorist. His sister pleads with him and tell him that he will be tortured but that does not work. Finally, dad gets him to put out. He is gay and had an assignation with a guy who tapped his phone. Now, CTU is after the guy (part of a couple). They find him but he is dead and his accomplice has taken off with Tony as a hostage.5-6 AM In an emotional roller coaster, the female terrorist plays upon the emotions at CTU bargaining with Tony's life. In the end, his estranged wife sees her responsibility to the millions who may be impacted by the missile so she shares the relevant information. Jack is ready to take her down when she apparently blows up herself and Tony it a fit over having been betrayed. Everyone thinks Tony and the terrorist are dead but Jack has doubts. He refuses to pull out, contrary to While House orders, and does manage to rescue Tony and take down the terrorist. It seems they will finally get the clue they need but the Chinese have other ideas. They are still hacked about the death of their consul and manage to kidnap the CTU agent who was identified but they want bigger fish. Under threat, they get him to talk and implicate Jack.6-7 AM Jack does the impossible. He captures the mastermind, gets the information that lets the nuclear missile be destroyed and actually survives to tell the tale. His survival is inconvenient for the acting president, though. To placate the Chinese, he agrees to hand Jack over to them. Some are worried that puts sensitive information at risk but the president forbids any assassination attempt, he just doesn't do so very convincingly. One of his aides decides to take matters into his own hands and the former president, Palmer, gets wind of the situation. The only way out for everyone is for Jack to cease to exist. Jack agrees and, conveniently dies.Season 5 Prequel Jack has been dead for a year. Now somebody has hacked into Chloe's files and learned that he is alive. That same person wants him dead. It's a long car chase as Jack leaves a clandestine meeting with Chloe meant to inform him of what is going on.",4,Great but not the Best,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,20213,"['great', 'season', '24',

937450,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000B837XI,John Kwok,"[1, 2]","I got hooked on ""24"" by accident, missing nearly half of the episodes during the fourth season, before literally forcing myself to watch the rest. What I did see was well worth watching, not only for Kiefer Sutherland's fine portrayal of CTU agent Jack Bauer, but especially Arnold Vosloo's chilling portrayal of  Islamic terrorist mastermind Habib Marwan, with whom Bauer would play a lethal game of cat and mouse (Incidentally South African actor Arnold Vosloo may be remembered best for his role as ""The Mummy"" in the  recent film starring actor Brendan Fraser.). I saw how it escalated to the point where the Chinese become involved, leading to a surprise twist ending for Jack Bauer which sets up what will follow in Season 5.This year's cast of ""24"" is replete with many excellent performances, most notably from Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeida), Reiko Aylesworth (Michelle Dessler), and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) from the few members of the returning cast, as well as from William Devane (Secretary of Defense James Heller), Alberta Watson (Erin Driscoll) and Kim Raver (Audrey Heller Raines). Dennis Haysbert makes a surprising, yet reasonable, return as former U. S. president David Palmer. I would also note Angela Goethals's fine portrayal of Erin Driscoll's troubled teenage daughter Maya. But I regret having missed most of the superb performances of Iranian-born actress Shohreh Aghdashloo (She earned an Academy Award for her portrayal of the Iranian emigre wife in the film ""House of Sand and Fog"".) playing this season's most vile villain, Dina Araz, who was one of Marwan's senior lieutenants .

937451,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B000B837XI,Joseph Boone,"[13, 17]","Season 4 begins with Jack Bauer working for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller.  We have a new president in the form of John Keeler and most of the faces in CTU are also new.  In addition, Jack has a new girlfriend in the form of Audrey Raines, daughter to Jack's boss.  Jack, Audrey, and Heller are visiting L.A. when terrorist activity begins to heat up in a way that involves them very directly.  Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Jack to be thrust back into action to stop the bad guys.  Normally, I write reviews that offer a bit more info on the plot, but with this show I'm not comfortable doing that.  Too much of the punch that 24 has to offer comes from all the twists and turns of the story and giving those away is not fair to new viewers.As mentioned, there are many new faces in the cast this season and most of them work pretty well.  Curtis Manning makes a good no-nonsense agent with a solid presence.  Erin Driscoll is the new head of CTU Los Angeles and looks like a moronic bureaucrat in the first couple of episodes but then mercifully starts to act in a much more competent fashion.  In addition to all the new faces, a few old friends return as the season progresses.  A surprise absence was Kim Bauer, for which I was highly grateful.  Probably the worst character depiction was Chloe O'Brian.  She was quirky and abrasive in24 - Season Threebut I liked her for the most part.  This season, she is just rude and condescending every time she opens her mouth no matter what the situation is.  It's so over the top that it really doesn't make any sense at all and is just irritating to watch.Without giving away specifics, the plot is another case of very mixed quality ideas.  The first half to two-thirds of the season is relatively tight and holds up well but then it stumbles badly.  You start seeing things like a terrorist driving a jeep on a deserted road in the desert and yet a CTU helicopter can't find him.  A company is afraid that computer records might make them look bad so they take actions that would be guaranteed to land the executives in jail for life and get the corporation shut down forever.  A man is badly wounded and instead of taking him to a hospital, they take him to the little clinic at CTU.  All of these things are contrivances to make things harder for Jack either immediately or later on, but they are so poorly conceived that they badly undermine the credibility of the show as you watch it.Trying to give 24-Season 4 a rating in stars is difficult because the season fluctuates so wildly in quality almost from minute to minute.  At it's best, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  At it's worst, you'll roll your eyes and grind your teeth as yet another arbitrary obstacle is thrown in Jack's way that makes no sense whatsoever.  The soap opera that occurs between various characters also gets very tiresome.  After watching the first four seasons on DVD (I've never watched the show on TV) I can say that more and more plot elements are getting recycled and the magic is starting to wear off for me.  I may buy the next season at some point, but I'm ready for some time off after watching this one.  I would recommend this only to people who really loved the first three seasons and are hungry for more.",3,Uneven quality undermines this wild ride,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,3277,"['Season', '4', 'begins', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'working', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'have', 'new', 'president', 'form', 'John', 'Keeler', 'most', 'CTU', 'are', 'also', 'new', 'addition', 'Jack', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'form', 'Audrey', 'Raines', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'boss', 'Jack', 'Audrey', 'Heller', 'are', 'visiting', 'L.A.', 'when', 'terrorist', 'activity', 'heat', 'up', 'way', 'very', 'directly', 'Needless', 'say', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'Jack', 'be', 'thrust', 'back', 'action', 'stop', 'bad', 'guys', 'Normally', 'write', 'reviews', 'offer', 'bit', 'more', 'info', 'plot', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'comfortable', 'doing', 'Too', 'much', 'punch', '24', 'offer', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'not', 'fair', 'new', 'viewers.As', 'mentioned', 'are', 'many', 'new', 'cast', 'season', 'most', 'work', 'pretty', 'well', 'Curtis', 'Manning', 'good', 'no-nonsense', 'agent', 'solid', 'presence', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'new', 'head', 'CTU', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'moronic', 'bureaucrat', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'then', 'mercifully', 'act', 'much', 'more', 'competent', 'fashion', 'addition', 'new', 'few', 'old', 'friends', 'return', 'season', 'surprise', 'absence', 'was', 'Kim', 'Bauer', 'was', 'highly', 'grateful', 'Probably', 'worst', 'character', 'depiction', 'was', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'was', 'quirky', 'abrasive', 'in24', 'Season', 'Threebut', 'liked', 'most', 'part', 'season', 'just', 'rude', 'condescending', 'time', 'mouth', 'matter', 'what', 'situation', 'so', 'top', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'just', 'irritating', 'watch.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'specifics', 'plot', 'case', 'very', 'mixed', 'quality', 'ideas', 'first', 'half', 'two-thirds', 'season', 'relatively', 'tight', 'up', 'well', 'then', 'badly', 'start', 'seeing', 'things', 'terrorist', 'driving', 'jeep', 'deserted', 'road', 'desert', 'yet', 'CTU', 'helicopter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'company', 'afraid', 'computer', 'records', 'might', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'take', 'actions', 'would', 'be', 'guaranteed', 'land', 'executives', 'jail', 'life', 'get', 'corporation', 'shut', 'down', 'forever', 'man', 'badly', 'wounded', 'instead', 'taking', 'hospital', 'take', 'little', 'clinic', 'CTU', 'things', 'are', 'contrivances', 'make', 'things', 'harder', 'Jack', 'immediately', 'later', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'badly', 'undermine', 'credibility', 'show', 'watch', 'it.Trying', 'give', '24-Season', '4', 'rating', 'stars', 'difficult', 'season', 'so', 'wildly', 'quality', 'almost', 'minute', 'minute', 'best', 'edge', 'seat', 'worst', ""'ll"", 'roll', 'eyes', 'grind', 'teeth', 'yet', 'arbitrary', 'obstacle', 'thrown', 'Jack', 'way', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'soap', 'opera', 'various', 'characters', 'also', 'very', 'tiresome', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'TV', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'more', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'getting', 'recycled', 'magic', 'starting', 'wear', 'off', 'may', 'buy', 'next', 'season', 'point', ""'m"", 'ready', 'time', 'off', 'watching', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'hungry', 'more']",N/A

937460,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000B837XI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 7]","The television thriller 24 brought the audience a fresh and rapid TV series depicting genuine drama in real time.  The title stems from the notion of real time, as each season takes 24 hours and covers one concern while each episode covers one of these hours.  Within each hour, the audience gets to witness the actions of the bad guys, usually terrorists, being combated by the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) together with the involvement of the White House, as these matters are of highest priority to the national security.The concept of 24 is brilliant, as Homeland Security has generated a color-coded security advisory system that reminds the people of the United States about the true nature of the terror threat.  While the people often ponder the notion of terror in fear, 24 merely cashes in on the audience's anxiety, by creating fictional scenarios that remain close to the politics and management of terrorism.  It is within the realism that the audience can connect with the events on the show, as similar incidents might (God forbid) happen to the people of United States.The fourth season starts at 7:00AM, as a man on a train carries a metal briefcase chained to his wrist and has two guards with him.  However, the train runs into a truck and creates an explosion on impact.  It was a planned move by the attacker, Dar, who cuts the briefcase from the man's wrist.  The sudden opening catches the viewer's attention, as does the reason why the briefcase was stolen.  Shortly after, CTU is contacted and a meeting between the CTU and the Defense Department reveals that the main character, Agent Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), has been fired from CTU by Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson).Jack now works for the Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane) and he is secretively having an affair with Heller's daughter Audrey (Kim Raver).  It is a year and a half past the deadly virus that threatened Los Angeles in season 3, but now a new threat has emerged in this season.  Besides the theft of the briefcase, the Secretary of Defense is kidnapped along with his daughter and later someone steals a stealth bomber, but all of these acts are preplanned to serve a greater malevolent scheme with a greater destructive purpose.  These plans surround one specific Habib Marvan, an Arabian terrorist, which the American government has been trying to locate, as he is in charge of a number of Middle Eastern terrorist cells.  A clear difference surfaces in the fourth season compared to the previous seasons, as there is not one threat, but multiple.Season four is darker and stronger in some aspects.  For example, Jack has to face the dilemma of having his secret lover kidnapped, which possibly brings back memories when his wife was killed in the first season.  It could also be because the terrorists are rougher than before, which makes Jack approach the problems in a gloves-off approach.  In addition, the hideous act of torture for information has been an element in the previous seasons as well, but in the fourth season this too becomes more uncomplicated and cruel.  Otherwise the show continues to apply the split screens to help the audience understand what is happening while the occasional scurrying photography adds emotional aspects to the show such as realism, stress, and the element that time is of short supply.24's fourth season does not reach the same high level as previous seasons.  One reason that affected 24's quality was the musical chair rotation of new and old faces in and out of the television thriller.  The changing of actors made it a little difficult to build connections with the new performers, and it affected the show somewhat.  Nonetheless, 24 offers a truly suspenseful political thriller that must be approached with the notion that it is fiction, or else it could intensify the anguish of watching the news and living life in the light of modern day politics.DVD Features:On the seventh disc on this DVD set of 24: Season Four the viewer can uncover a large number of goodies.  The special features open with a taste of the upcoming season five, which will air on television on January 15th, 2006.  The first feature on the next season is a Season 5 Prequel that offers an 11-minute introduction that will tip the audience to a little of what to expect.  Secondly, in the season five promotion there is a Fox Movie Channel: Making a Scene that shows the creation of a car chase.  A set design feature presenting the creation of the new CTU in fourth season of 24 and the opening train explosion has also received further treatment in the extras.  Lock and Load offers the audience some insight into the military expertise that was provided to create the tense militaristic approach that CTU provides in 24.  Three-dozen extended and deleted scenes will give the 24 enthusiasts an idea what could not be fitted to the time slots provided for its TV time.  There is also a chance for the audience to experience the innovating promotions of 24: Season Four that was sent through cell phones with the ability to play short mobisodes.  Here on the DVD set in the section that states 24: Conspiracy, the viewer can find all 24 mobisodes that originally were aired in Europe and later in the United States.  The audience can also enjoy the theme song from 24 performed by Sean Callery that is located on the second page of the extras section.  The extras end with the Inside Look that shows a promotional preview of The Sentinel (2006), a preview of 24: The Game, and link to website the 24: The Game.",4,Fourth Season of Suspenseful Television

This season involves 1 terrorist plot, leading into another, which leads into another, which leads yet into another plot.  Each evolution is fine until you realize that each plot depends on the one before it being pulled off successfully by the terrorists.  At some point the complexity becomes overwhelming.Furthermore, some of the plots obviously required long term planning down the exact date something happens, while other parts of the plot require the terrorist to have last minute knowledge of certain events.  In other words, you don't find out when something will happen until the day before, but parts of your plan depend on knowing that information weeks or months earlier.I realize the writers have a tough job, and continuing to come up with inventive plot twists is hard work, but I have a memory, and after or during the show I may think about how we got from there to here, and it just doesn't jive.The show is great fun to watch, and each episode leaves me wanting to see the next one, but it does take away from the fun when I'm yelling ""That couldn't of happened"" or That's Preposterous!"" at the TV.",4,Requires severe suspension of disbelief,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,1214,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'season', '24', 'yet', 'season', '4', 'found', 'complaining', 'show', 'season', '1', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'leading', 'yet', 'plot', 'evolution', 'fine', 'realize', 'plot', 'one', 'being', 'pulled', 'off', 'successfully', 'terrorists', 'point', 'complexity', 'overwhelming.Furthermore', 'plots', 'obviously', 'required', 'long', 'term', 'planning', 'down', 'exact', 'date', 'something', 'happens', 'other', 'parts', 'plot', 'require', 'terrorist', 'have', 'last', 'minute', 'knowledge', 'certain', 'events', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'when', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'day', 'parts', 'plan', 'depend', 'knowing', 'information', 'weeks', 'months', 'realize', 'writers', 'have', 'tough', 'job', 'continuing', 'come', 'up', 'inventive', 'plot', 'twists', 'hard', 'work', 'have', 'memory', 'show', 'may', 'think', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'here', 'just', ""n't"", 'jive.The', 'show', 'great', 'fun', 'watch', 'episode', 'wanting', 'see', 'next', 'one', 'take', 'away', 'fun', 'when', ""'m"", 'yelling', 'could', ""n't"", 'happened', 'Preposterous', 'TV']",N/A

Hands down, this is the best drams to air on TV - there simply is no equal to it.  Each episode leaves you amazed, shaking-your-head-in-amazement, and wanting more. You cannot go wrong in purchasing this season - you will get 24 episodes of nail-biting heart-racing excitement as Jack Bauer leads the CTU team to  stop a nuclear terror strike on US soil.Keifer Sutherland again reprises the role of Jack Bauer, CTU Field Agent who will stop at nothing and sacrifice everything to stop the threats that are trying to destroy his country.  This season again explores the almost impossible task of being a CTU agent and having a meaningful, fulfilling relationship.  This theme is explored through many characters, and is quite touching, and provides an emotional contrast to the non-stop action ""24"" is known for.  The supporting cast is superb, and the personal plot themes involving these characters lends an emotional reality to a show which already presents a race-against-the-clock stark dramatic reality.I have watched four seasons of ""24"", and each season continues to top the season before.  In short, this is the best entertainment television can offer.

It does have a half life to it in that you tend to think nothing more can happen to Jack. But . . .The show is buoyed by great tight writing. While Jack's voice is fantastic (how does he do that? Camels and Jack Daniels?) the guardians of the 24 gate are the writers. The plots are complicated and the mission equally multi-tasked. But the split screen and the subtle review of what's happened by a new person to the script-set-hour generally brings the audience up to snuff with each hour.Additionally, the re-emergence of old tried and true characters like Dennis Haysbert (ex-President Palmer) and Carlos Bernard (Tony) is excellent both in the timing and the then current issue. I mean when Jack tells us he's got to turn to the one man he can trust, ya'll know he's going to find Tony somewhere and Tony's a litle drunk and feeling sorry for himself and misses Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth).I don't miss Elisha Cuthbert. I mean she's a good actor and she's . . . . at the risk of being a sexist-pig-dog . . . a hottie. But I don't see her as the teenage or early 20's daughter of Jack Bauer, who, in the tradition of Jack Reacher and Luther Ewing, is a pleasant looking STONE COLD KILLER. I mean, did you catch the one where he cuts the guy's head off and brings it to someone to earn his trust? Elisha, all parts moving in synchronicity and showing a fair amount of skin hugging Jack and saying ""I love you, Daddy"" has me confused and a little off center.So he should have a younger less sexy dauughter. You know, plunging necklines, cleavage and painted-on-jeans were all OK when in the first season she was in her rebellious, teenage slut mode. After that it grew tedious.Nina was a great bent woman as was Sherry. Evil gorgeous women. Brrrr. I think it's a great series. Yes, eventually we'll get overloaded with it.

The idea of a tv show that unfolds in real time is a fascinating concept. That, and the fact that they blew up a plane in the first episode (less than two months removed from the worst terrorist attack in history, no less.) showed me that whoever was behind this project had serious balls and would push viewers to the limit.Now, then, let me say that season 4 is going to be chided as unoriginal. How could they be original anymore? It's hard to keep that kind of continuity together when you write on the fly. And especially when you have to top yourself year after year to keep the show on the air. I enjoyed season 4 but it bugged me a lot.Driscoll was practically useless. That and downright annoying. Good riddance. Bring in someone else in season 5 to run the show.Another mole? Sheesh. I was on to Aisha Tyler from go. Worst attempt at re-creating Nina ever. (Man. I missed Nina this year. And Sherry Palmer too. The mega bitches are gone. Sigh.)Arab terrorists with nuclear capabilities. Well, I know it's been talked about and all, terrorists getting their hands on nukes, but try another ethnic group. It's like, all of a sudden every terrorist cell will go for nukes within the same breath. Hey, if one don't get it the next one will, right? No wonder Kiefer had to make a PSA.And the whole plot twist with Edgar's mom? Adam season 3, anyone? Jack, season 1? There needs to be a moritorium on families in harms way of the main and supporting characters.The Araz family was a nice twist. Apple pie, Ward, June and the Beav, living in suburbia, plotting on the free world. A whole family. Good idea.President Keeler. Such a waste. This show should never be without David Palmer in a presidential capacity. And as for Logan, can we sic Mandy on him? (I love her. Good character)The Hellers were a mixed bag. Secretary Heller, fine. Audrey, pass. I'd rather have Kate Warner, thank you.Tony and Michelle? Chase and Kim all over again.But the ending? Magnifico!!! Made it all worth it. Lets just hope Samwise Gamge can function properly without having to protect Mr Frodo. For those lost ones out there, I'm referring to Sean Astin, who will be in Season 5.And as for season 5, I think it'll be a manhunt at first, but then a 'hey Jack, we really need your help' kinda thing.

As is the case with this series though, there is much more than meets than eye...Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Carlos Bernard, Reiko Aylesworth, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) Just like in the previous seasons, there is no closure from Season Three to Season Four; e.g. detailed info on Michelle/Tony ( or even Kim/Chase...), the President/nation rewarding Bauer for preventing the spread of the virus, what happened to the Palmer family and how they got on.Instead Season Four starts abruptly and with a lot of gaps and unpleasant surprises in the shape of some not very likable CTU agents, like the new director.2) Another traitor at CTU???  Enough already!3) Speaks some truths about the USA being despised due to bad foreign policy.  Ideas of returning to their borders and minding their own business is not necessarily a bad thing, and ""demonizing"" one that thinks as such is not a good thing.On the positive side:1) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""2) Arnold Vosloh (!) (Imhotep from Mummy and Mummy II) who is great in his role as Habib Marwan.3) 24 sheds light on US Gov. operations that lead the rest of the world to resent America.4) A good look into the dirty world of politics.In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

Yes, I am sure there are a few terrorist cells here in North America somewhere. But this program ignores the fact that most of those are likely single men and certainly extreme religious conservatives.The show goes out of its way to portray the normal, moderate-appearing, hardworking, upper middle class Muslim family next door as worst and most ruthless kind of terrorists. They don't just dislike their son dating an American Christian girl, they poison her tea and shoot her. (And frankly, any family this ruthless and extreme would sacrifice their own son to the cause without a qualm.)There are no positive portrayals whatsoever of Arabs or Muslims, unless you count the doctor in the background of an episode or two.Fostering this kind of paranoia -- don't trust your Muslim neighbors, cause they're probably terrorists anyway -- is not a nice game. It reminds me of the Red Menace scares of the '50s.For the record, I am a Christian Euro-American whose family on both sides has been here over a century. I am also someone who has had the opportunity to know an Arab-American, Muslim family since childhood. This kind of slur on them and millions like them makes my skin crawl. Worse, it makes me worry for them.The constant justification of torture is my other problem with this season. Someone is always ""having"" to torture someone, because they ""just don't have time"" to do it the legal way. One or two innocent people are shown being tortured, but we are always safely removed from the effects of it, and the fact that innocent people tortured will make things up to get the pain to stop. Real helpful when time is of the essence.It's always shown as justified, and, incidentally, always shown as getting the correct information, which as we know often does not happen, even when the subject actually knows something. No consideration of how indistinguishable this makes the good guys from the bad guys seems to cross the producers' minds. Or that maybe, just maybe, America should stand for something better than torture.The final problem I have with the show is simply the lighting. So many, many scenes make me want to say ""turn a light on.""

937478,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000B837XI,Mark Baker,"[0, 0]","Season four of suspense drama 24 keeps the plot points coming and the suspense building once again.In the aftermath of season 3, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) was fired from CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) Los Angeles.  But, always a resourceful guy, he lands on his feet with a job working for Secretary of Defense James Heller (William Devane).  In the year and a half away from CTU, true love may have finally come his way again as he builds a relationship with the boss's daughter, Audrey (Kim Raver).All this comes crashing down as a cell of terrorists once again begin to carry out attacks on the US.  It starts with the kidnapping of James and Audrey, but that's only the start of a series of attacks planned by mastermind Habib Marvan (Arnold Vosloo).  As each crisis begins, the staff at CTU must find a way to deal with it all the while searching for Habib to end the constant attacks.Viewers of the show were shocked to learn that many of the regulars from past years hadn't been asked to return for season 4.  While disappointing, it was probably a wise move because they were running out of storylines for these characters.  While Jack's daughter never did show up this season, they did bring back Tony (Carlos Bernard), Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth) and former President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) in credible ways that added to the story.Once again, the story reigns supreme with edge of your seat suspense from episode one until the end.  I didn't feel this season was quite as strong as the last one.  The multiple attacks made for a more fragmented feel for me.  Also, several of their plot complications are a little too familiar by now, making this season's cliffhangers some of the most predictable to date.  Still, these are minor squabbles in the grand scheme of things.  The pacing is sharp and the story line never gets too far off track.  And there are several surprising twists along the way.  I particularly enjoyed one involving CTU computer agent Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub).  Speaking of whom, she really grew on me this season.  While there are still times I love to hate her, I understand her more.Which brings up an important point.  While plot is supreme on this show, characters are important as well.  By spending a very stressful day with these people, we do get to know, understand, and like them.  This point was really driven home to me near the end of the season when Tony and Michelle faced a crisis and I was so wrapped up in what would happen to them, I was actually more concerned with them then the millions of others in danger.The contents of this seven disc set will come as no surprise to the fans that have been buying these all along.  The 24 episodes are presented in wide screen and full surround on the first six discs.  Each disc includes one commentary track and deleted scenes from the episodes.  Disc seven is where most of the bonus features are.  All the deleted scenes are presented again with optional commentary.  There are previews for season 5 as well as the new 24 video game.  Featurettes this go around include a look at creating the new set for CTU, a look at filming a car chase as well as the train explosion, and a look at the military expertise used to make CTU feel real.While not my favorite season, this show is still at the top of its game and showing no signs of slowing down.  Because each season is its own story, new viewers could come in here without being too lost, although returning character's story lines won't mean as much.  Faithful fans will find much to love and little to complain about in this season.",5,Tick Tock a Fourth Time,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",2005,3587,"['Season', 'four', 'suspense', 'drama', '24', 'plot', 'points', 'coming', 'suspense', 'building', 'once', 'again.In', 'aftermath', 'season', '3', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'fired', 'CTU', 'Counter', 'Terrorism', 'Unit', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'always', 'resourceful', 'guy', 'feet', 'job', 'working', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'William', 'Devane', 'year', 'half', 'away', 'CTU', 'true', 'love', 'may', 'have', 'finally', 'come', 'way', 'again', 'relationship', 'boss', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Raver', '.All', 'crashing', 'down', 'cell', 'terrorists', 'once', 'again', 'begin', 'carry', 'out', 'attacks', 'US', 'kidnapping', 'James', 'Audrey', 'only', 'start', 'series', 'attacks', 'planned', 'mastermind', 'Habib', 'Marvan', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'crisis', 'staff', 'CTU', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'deal', 'while', 'searching', 'Habib', 'end', 'constant', 'attacks.Viewers', 'show', 'were', 'shocked', 'learn', 'many', 'regulars', 'past', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'asked', 'return', 'season', '4', 'disappointing', 'was', 'probably', 'wise', 'move', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'storylines', 'characters', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'never', 'did', 'show', 'up', 'season', 'did', 'bring', 'back', 'Tony', 'Carlos', 'Bernard', 'Michelle', 'Reiko', 'Aylesworth', 'former', 'President', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', 'Haysbert', 'credible', 'ways', 'added', 'story.Once', 'again', 'story', 'supreme', 'edge', 'seat', 'suspense', 'episode', 'one', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'season', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'last', 'one', 'multiple', 'attacks', 'made', 'more', 'fragmented', 'feel', 'Also', 'several', 'plot', 'complications', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'familiar', 'now', 'making', 'season', 'cliffhangers', 'most', 'predictable', 'date', 'Still', 'are', 'minor', 'squabbles', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'pacing', 'sharp', 'story', 'line', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'off', 'track', 'are', 'several', 'surprising', 'twists', 'way', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'involving', 'CTU', 'computer', 'agent', 'Chloe', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Speaking', 'whom', 'really', 'grew', 'season', 'are', 'still', 'times', 'love', 'hate', 'understand', 'more.Which', 'up', 'important', 'point', 'plot', 'supreme', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'important', 'well', 'spending', 'very', 'stressful', 'day', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'understand', 'point', 'was', 'really', 'driven', 'home', 'end', 'season', 'when', 'Tony', 'Michelle', 'faced', 'crisis', 'was', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'concerned', 'then', 'millions', 'others', 'danger.The', 'contents', 'seven', 'disc', 'set', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'along', '24', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'wide', 'screen', 'full', 'surround', 'first', 'six', 'discs', 'disc', 'one', 'commentary', 'track', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'Disc', 'seven', 'where', 'most', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'again', 'optional', 'commentary', 'are', 'previews', 'season', '5', 'as', 'well', 'new', '24', 'video', 'game', 'go', 'around', 'include', 'look', 'creating', 'new', 'set', 'CTU', 'look', 'filming', 'car', 'chase', 'as', 'well', 'train', 'explosion', 'look', 'military', 'expertise', 'used', 'make', 'CTU', 'feel', 'real.While', 'not', 'favorite', 'season', 'show', 'still', 'top', 'game', 'showing', 'signs', 'slowing', 'down', 'season', 'own', 'story', 'new', 'viewers', 'could', 'come', 'here', 'being', 'too', 'lost', 'returning', 'character', 'story', 'lines', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mean', 'as', 'much', 'Faithful', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'love', 'little', 'complain', 'season']",N/A

Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).(Warning: some spoilers ahead.)The first 3 seasons were good. But season 4 was far more complicated. Just as CTU seems to come to grips with one attack, it leads into something more sinister and larger than they had expected. The twists and turns just seem to keep coming, up through the very end. a very good season.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. There is also an option on the episode discs to view deleted or extended scenes in-line to the episode. Cool feature.Season 4 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and abonus features. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV or surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well.

937492,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B000B837XI,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[2, 6]","***** Acting****  Directing****  DVD Extras*  Plot24 is a great show but even great shows have their bad seasons.  To enjoy this show you must suspend all disbelief.  The season begins with an train crash.  It turns out that someone on the train has a device that can comprimise every nuclear power plant in the nation.Jack Bauer has been forced out of CTU and now works for the Secretary of Defense and is sleeping with his daughter, Audrey.  The Secretary sends Jack to CTU while he deals with his renagade son.  While at his son's he and his daughter are kidnapped by terrorists and put on trial.  Trial and his execution are to be broadcast on the internet.Jack is pressed into service.  Using his renegade style, he rescues his boss and girlfriend.  But it turns out, that the kidnapping was just a cover.  The terrorists were behind the train bombing and used the intert surge to hack into the nuclear power plant computers and use the override device to melt down the power plants.Jack finds out that one of the terrorists worked on the device at the defense contractor.  Jack and Audrey's husband, Paul, go to the defense contractor to see if they can get a thread on the terrorists.  The defense contractor agrees to cooperate but decide that it is not in their best interest.  Once Paul finds something, not only does the contractor send assassins in to kill Jack and Paul but mount an EMP that wipes out all electrical devices for 8 square miles.Jack escapes with the information unscathed but Paul is shot pushing Jack out of the way.One nuclear plant melts down in California but eventually, CTU is able to save the other 107.  But this was a cover too.  The real target was Air Force One.The terrorists have arranged to have a mercenary steal a stealth bomber to shoot down Air Force One.  CTU uncovers this in time but cannot stop the stealth bomber and Air Force One is shot down.  The good news is the President is safe but hurt.  The bad news is that this is attack was a cover too.  The terrorists were after the Nuclear Football, a briefcase that can detonate all the US's nuclear bombs.Oh, and did I mention that the terrorist just happened to steal a one of the largest nuclear warheads.  Now Jack must find the terrorist behind the attacks to stop the detonation.Cloe gets a lead on someone involved with the latest attack which leads to a Chinese nuclear scientist.  But he is at the Chinese consulate and they will not give him up.  So Jack is authorized to kidnap him.  During the kidnapping the consulate gets killed by friendly fire.Now this is just the highlights.  I didn't mention that Tony is out of jail and Michelle has left him but they are forced to work together in this crisis.  Or that the Vice President proves to be incompetent and blows the arrest of the lead terrorist.For all this to happen, the US intellegence would have to be incompetent.  This is five major attacks that all have to happen in order for everything to happen.  That is everyone but Jack has to be incompetent.Lets start with the train.  These are not government agents but employees of the a very powerful company with vast resources.  But this does not make sense, with a device so important, the company would use one of its corporate jets or helicopters, not a public train (that is so 50's!)Next, the kidnapping and trial of the Secretary happened within a few hours.  In the morning when most people would be at work or school.  Therefore, all this internet activity would be unlikely.  It takes time for an event like this to happen.And then, a company my try to hide illegal activity but to fry every electrical device within miles.  But this would be hard to cover and the law suits from this would sink any company.  Let alone the criminal charges.Well enough of the over the top writing.I do have to say that the acting in this is five star.  Keifer is great as usual but Cloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub) comes to life in this episode.  Alberta Walker is the lastest casualty as the new head of CTU.  Alberta is great but Erin Driscoll is no Madeline (La Femme Nikita).  Carlos Bernard and Rieko Aylesworth make the best out the mush they are given and prove that good actors can rise above mediocre writing. (Actually, everytime I see Rieko in any show (from SVU to ER), I realize that she is a hidden gem!)If you are a die hard fan of 24 then buy this set, if you are a casual admirer then buy if you get a great deal.Basically, a great cast in an absurd plot.DVD EXTRAS:As usual, the extras are really great including the Season 4 and Season 5 prequels (Or bridge).  But it would be better to put these great extras where they belong.  At the beginning of Disc 1 and the end of Disc 6, so they flow with what we are watching.I love watching deleted scenes and this has a lot of them.  And they are great.  I also love having director commentary and usually watch them twice (once with commentary and then without).  But with this many scenes it would take over 2 hours to do this.  In future, I would suggest that Cassar just give a brief explanation before each scene - and also have a Play All option.Also, they have the 24 minutesodes.  A promo that is totally seperate from the series but is linked to the initial plot line. (Based on unnessecary Chinese plotline and this.  I get a feeling that Keifer was in contract negotiations and the producers were testing this guy as a possible replacement.)Also included are feaurettes on the series and aspects of the series.

The pacing of the show is done perfectly, to give viewers a perfect understanding about what is going on at certain times.  A great wonder that 24 pulls off is that despite the fact that many people who watch the show, including I, do not know much about the technology used in the episodes, it is still not at all difficult to understand what's happening.Jack Bauer is a great hero, with flaws that make him all the more valiant.  When one finishes this season, they will have an unprecedented fondness and respect for Bauer.  The friendships he finds in Tony Almeida, the hilariously awkward Chloe O'Brian, and David Palmer are true and touching, and his angsty tribulations in which he goes through with Audrey Raines is heart wrenching.  Some of the other notable characters are Edgar, who one can truly sympathize with and feel for, as he is a through-and-through nice guy who is hard not to love.  Behrooz Araz, the son of a terrorist, is a believable character who connects with the rebel and human in all of us.Now onto the villains.  Dina Araz is all over the place, and is not a very consistent character, nor are many of the less important terrorists.  Two villains stand out to me:  The fear-evoking Habid Marwan and the incredibly sexy ""Mandy.""  Habid is ruthless, and has a look of power and influence in his very gaze, and he is a formidable antagonist.  Mandy is gorgeous, kills with no remorse, and is as smart as Jack Bauer with her actions, but what is really terrifying about her is her clear blue eyes, which are so icy that you almost believe she could freeze you with them.Now onto the few negatives of the series; it seems after a plot-line is milked, they throw it to the side and move to the next.  Why did the Behrooz plot-line just stop, and why do we never see what happens to him?  Why don't we see when Mandy arrives at CTU to get the paper the President signed in the last episode?  Why don't we see what happens after Secretary of Defense James Heller discovers his son's secret?  The rest of the plot-lines are summed up great, and the end is a bit tear-jerking, but what happened to those plot-lines?  I want to SEE what happened to those characters, not assume!Otherwise, this season is amazing and well worth a buy.9/10",5,A Day's Worth,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,2432,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'intricate', 'plot', 'lines', 'so', 'many', 'twists', 'completely', 'change', 'storyline', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'hard', 'follow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'true', 'pacing', 'show', 'done', 'perfectly', 'give', 'viewers', 'perfect', 'understanding', 'what', 'going', 'certain', 'times', 'great', 'wonder', '24', 'pulls', 'off', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'including', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'technology', 'used', 'episodes', 'still', 'not', 'difficult', 'understand', 'what', 'happening.Jack', 'Bauer', 'great', 'hero', 'flaws', 'make', 'more', 'valiant', 'When', 'one', 'season', 'will', 'have', 'unprecedented', 'fondness', 'respect', 'Bauer', 'friendships', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'hilariously', 'awkward', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'David', 'Palmer', 'are', 'true', 'touching', 'angsty', 'tribulations', 'Audrey', 'Raines', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'other', 'notable', 'characters', 'are', 'Edgar', 'who', 'one', 'can', 'truly', 'sympathize', 'feel', 'through-and-through', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'Behrooz', 'Araz', 'son', 'terrorist', 'believable', 'character', 'who', 'rebel', 'human', 'us.Now', 'villains', 'Dina', 'Araz', 'place', 'not', 'very', 'consistent', 'character', 'are', 'many', 'less', 'important', 'terrorists', 'Two', 'villains', 'stand', 'out', 'fear-evoking', 'Habid', 'Marwan', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'Mandy', 'Habid', 'ruthless', 'look', 'power', 'influence', 'very', 'gaze', 'formidable', 'antagonist', 'Mandy', 'gorgeous', 'kills', 'remorse', 'as', 'smart', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'actions', 'what', 'really', 'terrifying', 'clear', 'blue', 'eyes', 'are', 'so', 'icy', 'almost', 'believe', 'could', 'freeze', 'them.Now', 'few', 'negatives', 'series', 'plot-line', 'milked', 'throw', 'side', 'move', 'next', 'Why', 'did', 'Behrooz', 'plot-line', 'just', 'stop', 'why', 'do', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'Mandy', 'CTU', 'get', 'paper', 'President', 'signed', 'last', 'episode', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'son', 'secret', 'rest', 'plot-lines', 'are', 'summed', 'up', 'great', 'end', 'bit', 'tear-jerking', 'what', 'happened', 'plot-lines', 'want', 'SEE', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'not', 'assume', 'Otherwise', 'season', 'amazing', 'well', 'buy.9/10']",N/A

""24"" offers a lot of people running around to an emotionally manipulative soundtrack, and lots of cell phones beeping (maybe the cell phone industry paid for the endless product placement), and Arab people plotting our destruction.

There is an entire book about how the Pentagon ""shapes and censors"" what comes out of Hollywood.Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the MoviesSo, I take offense to this show.

937509,A2U961E4K6ZN1C,B000B837XI,Quasimodal,"[7, 8]","After watching ""24"" season 1-3 in the past and season 4 recently (purchased from amazon.co.uk), I tried to write down below my feelings and analyze what makes it such a terrific show.Sure, the initial idea is original (24 episodes of 1 hour - actually 45 mn - in real time making a whole day) ; the casting is ideal and all the actors play perfectly ; plot and intrigues are very suspensful and interesting ; there is a true beginning and a real end to all seasons - which are all well directed.However, what makes the big difference is in the scenario. There is a tremendous number of events in a ""24"" season, based on the main plot (e.g. terrorism), and on CTU, the government, common people, relastionships, love, etc... most of them being linked, which makes another tremendous number of equations to be solved by the scriptwriter to ensure that all ins and outs keep some logic. And this is well done, this is even an excellent job - not only the plot  and situations of one season are realistic, but any ""old"" player coming from a previous season comes with a valid reason ; he does not magically appear to save the script!Also, writers take big care about being faithful to the characters personalities. An actor is assigned a role with a full personality set that he/she has to embrace. It's probably why all actors play so well ; they don't actually play a ""role"", they embrace a whole personality.

For Season 3 it worked alright in the end but Season 4 is a bit of a mess. It is much like the war in Iraq. The beginning is very well planned and faithfully executed and then everything goes to pieces. Up until the release of James Heller and Audrey everything goes well. And then the writers start grasping for straws. The real time formula has long since been abandoned, the most comic example being when Chloe is called back to work. She gets dressed and over there, checked in the building, reinstated and back to work in something like 3-5 real time minutes. I hope she lived close. And also, I don't know about you but if terrorists kidnapped the Secretary of Defense and planned to execute him AND his daughter live on the internet, shot down Air Force One, caused a freaking nuclear reactor to go off and then planned to fire a nuclear missile at some place in the States my confidence in the country would never be restored no matter how many tortures of possible ASSOCIATES (not actual terrorists mind) of terrorists the government brought about.

937518,AK7IDQJN31163,B000B837XI,Ryan,"[1, 2]","The fourth longest day of Jack Bauer's life starts out with a bang, as usual. Jack has been dismissed from CTU by the new boss, Erin Driscoll (Alberta Watson), and now works for the Secretary of Defense, James Heller (William Devane.) Jack is secretly involved with Heller's married daughter, Audrey (Kim Raver.) Jack is in L.A. for a meeting with Driscoll over budgetary concerns, but as it happens, Muslim terrorists pick this very day to bomb a train and steal a very important briefcase from a courier. Things only get worse when Heller and Audrey are kidnapped and the terrorists threaten to put Heller on trial via the internet. These events launch Jack into yet another harrowing day filled with twists and turns. Along the way, Jack will make new enemies and will establish new friendships. He will also encounter familiar faces from the past like Tony Almeida, Chloe O'Brian, Michelle Dessler and even ex President David Palmer.The problem with this season is in it's overall construction. In previous efforts, the writers had several large themes present throughout the entire course of one season that seemed to hold the plot together, even during the weak points. This time, they presented multiple threats with shorter story arcs. The result is short term satisfaction, but little story continuity as the mastermind terrorist goes from one plan to another and then another with inexplicable transition.When the plots work, they work extremely well. The initial threat comes from the family next door, with Oscar-winner Shohreh Aghdashloo playing the terrorist matriarch and the scariest villain to ever grace 24. This plot was controversial enough that it caught the attention of certain American Muslim groups, who objected to the depiction of the Araz family. There's also a great storyline near season's end involving the Chinese, leading to an excellent season finale with a twist ending that sets things up nicely for Day 5. Unfortunately, we're also treated to too much torture, another mole in CTU and characters who disappear without explanation before we get to that point.If there's one thing that 24 does better than most, it's the provision of great extras in almost every DVD set. The prequel to Day 5 isn't as long as producers promised, but it's a nice morsel that wets our appetites for things to come. All of the behind-the-scenes documentaries are a treat and some of the deleted scenes actually explain certain plot points that were cut from the broadcast episodes due to time constraints. There are also more commentaries in this set than any other and the insights given by writers and directors are great for us hard core fans, though its hard to figure out why Shannen Doherty could give us commentary, when Kiefer Sutherland couldn't.Overall, 24 Season Four may be a mixed bag, but the good outweighs the bad and it still contains all of the riveting elements that make this one of the best shows on television today.",5,Day 4: A Mixed Bag,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,2954,"['fourth', 'longest', 'day', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'life', 'out', 'bang', 'usual', 'Jack', 'been', 'dismissed', 'CTU', 'new', 'boss', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'now', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'James', 'Heller', 'William', 'Devane', 'Jack', 'secretly', 'involved', 'Heller', 'married', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'Kim', 'Raver', 'Jack', 'L.A.', 'meeting', 'Driscoll', 'budgetary', 'concerns', 'Muslim', 'pick', 'very', 'day', 'bomb', 'train', 'steal', 'very', 'important', 'briefcase', 'courier', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Heller', 'Audrey', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'terrorists', 'threaten', 'put', 'Heller', 'trial', 'internet', 'events', 'launch', 'Jack', 'yet', 'harrowing', 'day', 'filled', 'twists', 'turns', 'way', 'Jack', 'will', 'make', 'new', 'enemies', 'will', 'establish', 'new', 'friendships', 'will', 'also', 'encounter', 'familiar', 'past', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'Chloe', ""O'Brian"", 'Michelle', 'Dessler', 'even', 'ex', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer.The', 'problem', 'season', 'overall', 'construction', 'previous', 'efforts', 'writers', 'had', 'several', 'large', 'themes', 'present', 'entire', 'course', 'one', 'season', 'seemed', 'hold', 'plot', 'together', 'even', 'weak', 'points', 'time', 'presented', 'multiple', 'threats', 'shorter', 'story', 'arcs', 'result', 'short', 'term', 'satisfaction', 'little', 'story', 'continuity', 'mastermind', 'terrorist', 'one', 'plan', 'then', 'inexplicable', 'transition.When', 'plots', 'work', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'initial', 'threat', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'Oscar-winner', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'playing', 'terrorist', 'matriarch', 'scariest', 'villain', 'ever', 'grace', '24', 'plot', 'was', 'controversial', 'enough', 'caught', 'attention', 'certain', 'American', 'Muslim', 'groups', 'who', 'objected', 'depiction', 'Araz', 'family', 'also', 'great', 'storyline', 'season', 'end', 'involving', 'Chinese', 'leading', 'excellent', 'season', 'finale', 'twist', 'ending', 'sets', 'things', 'up', 'nicely', 'Day', '5', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'too', 'much', 'torture', 'mole', 'CTU', 'characters', 'who', 'disappear', 'explanation', 'get', 'point.If', 'one', 'thing', '24', 'better', 'most', 'provision', 'great', 'extras', 'almost', 'DVD', 'set', 'prequel', 'Day', '5', ""n't"", 'as', 'long', 'producers', 'promised', 'nice', 'morsel', 'appetites', 'things', 'come', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentaries', 'are', 'treat', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'actually', 'explain', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'cut', 'broadcast', 'episodes', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'commentaries', 'set', 'other', 'insights', 'given', 'writers', 'directors', 'are', 'great', 'hard', 'core', 'fans', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'could', 'give', 'commentary', 'when', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', ""couldn't.Overall"", '24', 'Season', 'Four', 'may', 'be', 'mixed', 'bag', 'good', 'bad', 'still', 'riveting', 'elements', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'today']",N/A

937520,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000B837XI,Sean Pasek,"[4, 5]","All Jack Bauer wants is to enjoy his new job as an advisor to Secretary of Defense, Heller.  He's even become seriously involved with the secretary's daughter, Audrey.  He's been out of CTU for 18 months after the new director fired him because she didn't trust him after his heroine addiction.  Jack is obviously happy with his new job and new relationship.  However, one has to ask, is this really the kind of life that Jack Bauer wants?  It might be.  But even he realizes very quickly that he's much better at something else: stopping terrorists.  Right from the get-go, Jack is visiting CTU to discuss the budget.  There is a situation brewing, and Jack can't help but give his input on a mission.  Someone during this season says that ""Jack is the best at what he does.""CTU is a different place now.  Tony is gone.  Michelle is now assistant director of Los Angeles Division of CTU.  Kim is happily settled down with Chase.  There are new faces at CTU now, and a new crisis that may very well be greater than anything they've faced before.Jack faces the most cunning and dangerous terrorist to date.  His name is Habib Marwan who is brilliantly played by South African actor, Arnold Vosloo.  This is a plan that has been in the works for years.  There are many terrorist cells involved, and they've got many attacks ready to go.  However, as with many ""24"" plots, not everything is as it seems.  It may take a good number of episodes to really grasp what the overall goal of the terrorists is, and what they're doing.  I won't give away any details here about the different plots.  It's important that viewer be given the fun and suspense of finding that out.  But just when you think one crisis has been averted, a new one pops into place.  But is there a connection between them?  Or are they separate?New faces here are Erin Driscoll, played by Alberta Watson, as the new director of CTU branch in Los Angeles.  She's a hard woman who is not very bending or compromising on things.  She is not at all comfortable with having Jack at CTU, and even less so when he becomes involved.  But, even Driscoll can't deny that Jack is needed.  She's a smart, professional woman, who seems seasoned and knows what to do.Chloe is still at CTU as their top analyst, whose annoying personality is still fully present.  She always manages to state the obvious at the wrong time, as if she's the only one who sees what everyone else already understands.  Many of her interactions are funny, and she's still likeable because she's so good at her job.  I'd hate to think how the terrorists would be stopped without Chloe at the helm of analyzing data and finding links.A new computer analyst is Edgar Stiles, played by Louis Lombardi.  I like Edgar because he represents everyone.  He represents the common employee.  This isn't to say he isn't good at his job, because he is.  He is simply a bit naive to how things work.  He doesn't know when to speak up sometimes or when to keep his mouth shut.  Either way, Lombardi plays him with an almost child-like innocence; a man who is finally being baptized by fire during this crisis.Season 4 pretty much starts right off and never lets up.  This is a thrill ride that pauses only briefly before taking off again.  When it's finally over, you almost have to remind yourself to breathe again.  It's that intense, but in a good way!  I don't think there is any other episodic television series that keeps the thrills, action, suspense, and overall intrigue going for 24 straight episodes.  Season 4 is the same as other seasons of 24; once you start, you find it very difficult to stop.  I don't know anyone who watches 24 on DVD and is able to stop after a single episode.  You always feel that you HAVE to find out what happens next!  The genius of the writing should be credited for that.Once again, the performances of everyone, especially Kiefer Sutherland, is top-notch.  Jack Bauer isn't the guy you want for a friend, but he is the guy you want in situations like this.  The biggest reason for that is that he is willing to do whatever it takes, whether it be putting himself in a hornet's nest of terrorists, or risking the lives of those he cares about to save the country.  Secretary Heller explains to his daughter, ""we need people like Jack who will do whatever is necessary.""  Americans have truly found themselves a bonafide hero in Jack Bauer, and I think that's one of the reasons that people love to watch ""24.""",5,Multi-layered Plot Makes Season 4 One Heck of a Ride!,1181520000,"06 11, 2007",2007,4465,"['Jack', 'Bauer', 'enjoy', 'new', 'job', 'advisor', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Heller', 'even', 'become', 'seriously', 'involved', 'secretary', 'daughter', 'Audrey', 'been', 'CTU', '18', 'months', 'new', 'director', 'fired', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'heroine', 'addiction', 'Jack', 'obviously', 'happy', 'new', 'job', 'new', 'relationship', 'However', 'ask', 'really', 'kind', 'life', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'very', 'quickly', 'much', 'better', 'something', 'else', 'stopping', 'terrorists', 'Right', 'get-go', 'Jack', 'visiting', 'CTU', 'discuss', 'budget', 'situation', 'brewing', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'give', 'input', 'mission', 'Someone', 'season', 'Jack', 'best', 'what', 'CTU', 'different', 'place', 'now', 'Tony', 'gone', 'Michelle', 'now', 'assistant', 'director', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Division', 'CTU', 'Kim', 'happily', 'settled', 'down', 'Chase', 'are', 'new', 'CTU', 'now', 'new', 'crisis', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'greater', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'faced', 'before.Jack', 'most', 'cunning', 'dangerous', 'terrorist', 'date', 'name', 'Habib', 'Marwan', 'who', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'South', 'African', 'actor', 'Arnold', 'Vosloo', 'plan', 'been', 'works', 'years', 'are', 'many', 'terrorist', 'cells', 'involved', ""'ve"", 'got', 'many', 'attacks', 'ready', 'go', 'However', 'many', '24', 'plots', 'not', 'everything', 'may', 'take', 'good', 'number', 'episodes', 'really', 'grasp', 'what', 'overall', 'goal', 'terrorists', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'here', 'different', 'plots', 'important', 'viewer', 'be', 'given', 'fun', 'suspense', 'finding', 'out', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'one', 'crisis', 'been', 'averted', 'new', 'one', 'place', 'there', 'connection', 'are', 'separate', 'New', 'here', 'are', 'Erin', 'Driscoll', 'played', 'Alberta', 'Watson', 'new', 'director', 'CTU', 'branch', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'hard', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'very', 'bending', 'compromising', 'things', 'not', 'comfortable', 'having', 'Jack', 'CTU', 'even', 'less', 'so', 'when', 'involved', 'even', 'Driscoll', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Jack', 'needed', 'smart', 'professional', 'woman', 'who', 'seasoned', 'what', 'do.Chloe', 'still', 'CTU', 'top', 'analyst', 'annoying', 'personality', 'still', 'fully', 'present', 'always', 'state', 'obvious', 'wrong', 'time', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'everyone', 'else', 'already', 'Many', 'interactions', 'are', 'funny', 'still', 'likeable', 'so', 'good', 'job', ""'d"", 'hate', 'think', 'how', 'terrorists', 'would', 'be', 'stopped', 'Chloe', 'helm', 'analyzing', 'data', 'finding', 'links.A', 'new', 'computer', 'analyst', 'Edgar', 'Stiles', 'played', 'Louis', 'Lombardi', 'like', 'Edgar', 'everyone', 'common', 'employee', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'good', 'job', 'simply', 'bit', 'naive', 'how', 'things', 'work', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'speak', 'up', 'sometimes', 'when', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'way', 'Lombardi', 'almost', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'man', 'who', 'finally', 'being', 'baptized', 'fire', 'crisis.Season', '4', 'pretty', 'much', 'starts', 'right', 'off', 'never', 'up', 'thrill', 'ride', 'only', 'briefly', 'taking', 'off', 'again', 'When', 'finally', 'over', 'almost', 'have', 'remind', 'breathe', 'again', 'intense', 'good', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'episodic', 'television', 'series', 'thrills', 'action', 'suspense', 'overall', 'intrigue', 'going', '24', 'straight', 'episodes', 'Season', '4', 'same', 'other', 'seasons', '24', 'once', 'start', 'find', 'very', 'difficult', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', '24', 'DVD', 'able', 'stop', 'single', 'episode', 'always', 'feel', 'HAVE', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next', 'genius', 'writing', 'should', 'be', 'credited', 'that.Once', 'again', 'performances', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'top-notch', 'Jack', 'Bauer', ""n't"", 'guy', 'want', 'friend', 'guy', 'want', 'situations', 'biggest', 'reason', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'be', 'putting', 'hornet', 'nest', 'terrorists', 'risking', 'lives', 'save', 'country', 'Secretary', 'Heller', 'daughter', 'need', 'people', 'Jack', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'necessary', 'Americans', 'have', 'truly', 'found', 'bonafide', 'hero', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'people', 'love', 'watch', '24']",N/A

Feminists of all races and orientation had plenty to praise heaven about too.  I simply refuse to stoop as low as many have here - no plot spoilers from me.

Make no mistake people: Season 4, though perfectly paced plot-wise, contains oodles of misogyny - just like the previous 3 seasons.  Female characters - both primary and secondary - are portrayed as conniving, spiteful, incompetent, or in one case just plain crazy.  It is sad and insulting in an age of so-called ""equality.""

We can't give up the fight - whether you are a true female, or merely a femmy man (you can help too, even if you underestimate yourself in many ways).Season 4 is possibly the best of the first four seasons.

Their interactions created scenes that were unpredictable, but interesting to watch even when something wasn't blowing up.In that light, the fourth season of 24 has been a major, major letdown. The characters and acting have deteriorated considerably. The scenes have become more predictable, manipulative, and melodramatic. One is more often than before aware of watching a scripted fantasy, more often placed in an awkward, formulaic moment. There is far less ambiguity and thus even suspense. The plotline simply moves along as if fashioned by a dead hand, not to mention they're obviously running out of ideas and recycling things at this point. Once again the love of Sutherland's life is kidnapped by terrorists and he is the only one who can rescure her. How original! Not to mention it is impossible to see what any of the characters supposedly see in each other. This time, I felt nothing for any of these characters, not even Bauer. He is just not the same without his family.The bottom line is there is no reason to watch this show anymore.

937529,A38I00SO3D9ZSM,B000B837XI,S. Zayas,"[8, 14]","Our family is new to ""24"" having never watched it on TV.  On recommendation by a friend, we have watched on DVD most of season 4.  The only way to watch a TV series that is one long running story is to get the DVDs (buy or rent.)  There are no commercials and you can watch 4 episodes in about 3 hours.  In 3 evenings, you can watch 3 months worth of episodes.  Having only watched ""24"" like this, I can't imagine trying to follow the story week-to-week like TV viewers do.The show itself is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful and action-packed.  Season 4 is particularly exciting and pretty relevant to post-9-11 America.  The plots and subplots are very layered; both the main story line and each character's personal life are shown in detail.For a show of this type, it is fairly well written.  The most glaring shortcoming of ""24"" is its main premise, i.e. that each episode is 1 hour in a day, each season is a 24 hour period.  While unique, the device isn't terribly believeable because there is no way all that action could be packed into any one person's week let alone 1 day.  Too much happens in a few hours to believe that any one person or group of people could have participated in the events.  This shortcoming is particularly obvious when watching the episodes back-to-back, without commercial breaks.  Because TV viewers see 1 hour blocks 1 time per week, the action appears a bit more spread out, if you will.Having not seen other seasons, I have no basis for comparison, but season 4 seems like a fine place to start following the show.",3,The only way to watch serial TV shows,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,1549,"['family', 'new', '24', 'having', 'never', 'watched', 'TV', 'recommendation', 'friend', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'most', 'season', '4', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'TV', 'series', 'one', 'long', 'running', 'story', 'get', 'DVDs', 'buy', 'rent', 'are', 'commercials', 'can', 'watch', '4', 'episodes', 'about', '3', 'hours', '3', 'evenings', 'can', 'watch', '3', 'months', 'episodes', 'Having', 'only', 'watched', '24', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'trying', 'follow', 'story', 'week-to-week', 'TV', 'viewers', 'do.The', 'show', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'suspenseful', 'action-packed', 'Season', '4', 'particularly', 'exciting', 'pretty', 'relevant', 'post-9-11', 'America', 'plots', 'subplots', 'are', 'very', 'layered', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'character', 'personal', 'life', 'are', 'shown', 'detail.For', 'show', 'type', 'fairly', 'well', 'written', 'most', 'glaring', 'shortcoming', '24', 'main', 'premise', 'i.e', 'episode', '1', 'hour', 'day', 'season', '24', 'hour', 'period', 'unique', 'device', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'believeable', 'way', 'action', 'could', 'be', 'packed', 'one', 'person', 'week', 'let', 'alone', '1', 'day', 'Too', 'much', 'happens', 'few', 'hours', 'believe', 'one', 'person', 'group', 'people', 'could', 'have', 'participated', 'events', 'shortcoming', 'particularly', 'obvious', 'when', 'watching', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'TV', 'viewers', 'see', '1', 'hour', 'blocks', '1', 'time', 'week', 'action', 'bit', 'more', 'spread', 'will.Having', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'basis', 'comparison', 'season', '4', 'fine', 'place', 'start', 'following', 'show']",N/A

Or, as that avid fan, Johann Sebastian Bach, having seen it, put it, in the words of BWV82, ""Ich habe genug"" (That's enough). I think I've come to the end of my ""24"" road.It's not that it isn't exciting and often tense; it is. The action scenes are well executed and adrenalin-filled, and the cliff-hangers frequently, agonisingly cliff-hangerish. In addition, I've become fond of some of the characters - Chloe, amateur computer genius, professional social disaster, is my heroine. By opening her mouth only to change feet, she adds the only glimmering of humour in an otherwise relentlessly serious show. Admittedly, it can be hard to see the funny side of being blown up, infected, shot, poisoned, gassed, tortured or irradiated, but a little levity helps to offset the grimness and provide some welcome contrast.However, I want some plot. Some sensible, semi-plausible plot. And that is absent in this season. We get not one terrorist plot, but a multiplicity of interconnected plots, in defiance of the real world principle that the more complex is a plot, the more likely it is to go wrong. Moreover, all of these occur in the same 24 hours and all are run by the same Moriartyish figure (any resemblance to previous Moriartyish figures, living or dead, is purely coincidental). Given what we now know of US intelligence competence and inter-agency cooperation, I guess we can be glad that such people don't really exist. If they did, they'd watch television, know to avoid the LA area and Jack Bauer completely and do their dastardly deeds on the East Coast - given the 24-hour real-time format, Jack couldn't get over there for 3 episodes, by which time the audience who survived the terror attack would have died of boredom. (And of course if Moriarty blew up D.C., nobody might actually care).Anyway, the individual plots themselves vary from improbable to totally ludicrous, their combination is daft beyond measure, and all culminate in the final six hours or so in a conclusion of such mind-boggling absurdity that one (this one anyway) shakes one's head in disbelief that anyone could write such stuff. As the old Dilbert line has it; I admire their ability to get paid for this. Suspension of disbelief sometimes fails catastrophically.Then there is Jack Bauer. Jack of the Charmed Life, Jack the Invincible, the Indestructible, the Inexhaustible, the Miracle Worker, the All-Wise. I find the character (and I do think Kiefer Sutherland plays him well) appealing and appalling in equal measure. Do people as utterly ruthless and single-minded as Jack exist? I hope not. In any case, I find Jack less and less credible as a normal mortal and more and more like a superhero. I would dearly love to believe that we are protected by superheroes, capable of leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but recent history has shown that the world is somewhat bereft of such people. Thankfully the world seems equally bereft of Moriartys.One bothersome aspect is the ever more frequent recourse to torture, and as a first, rather than a last, resort. Moreover, it always works in getting the right information at the right time. Amnesty Who? But then this show is probably so popular at least partially because it's a picture of how post-9/11 America sees itself, surrounded and infiltrated by nasties with Middle Eastern accents, and fighting for its existence, with no holds barred. One could nearly be forgiven for thinking that the show is US Administration propaganda, designed to fuel Americans' paranoia and keep up the atmosphere of fear so necessary to sustain the current Administration.In short, in order to enjoy ""24"", it seems one simply has to be in on the joke, as it were, accepting both Jack and plot(s) and the basic principle of the show that nothing exceeds like excess. A sort of escapist fairy tale for grown-ups, if you like. I find that I don't like so much any more. And so I bid a fond farewell to any more ""24"" purchases, with slight feelings of sadness. It was good while it lasted, but I simply can't justify buying what will most certainly be More Of The Same. (If I feel the need, it's bound to be on one of the German channels). However, for (a) lovers of whiz-bang entertainment, lots of explosions and a never-ending mortality rate, and (b) Dick Cheney, arise, go forth and buy.",2,"Hit the road, Jack...",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,4378,"['..an', ""don'cha"", 'come', 'back', 'mo', 'mo', 'mo', 'mo', 'fan', 'Johann', 'Sebastian', 'Bach', 'having', 'seen', 'put', 'words', 'BWV82', 'Ich', 'habe', 'genug', 'enough', 'think', ""'ve"", 'come', 'end', '24', 'road.It', 'not', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'often', 'tense', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'adrenalin-filled', 'cliff-hangers', 'frequently', 'agonisingly', 'cliff-hangerish', 'addition', ""'ve"", 'become', 'fond', 'characters', 'Chloe', 'amateur', 'computer', 'genius', 'professional', 'social', 'disaster', 'heroine', 'opening', 'mouth', 'only', 'change', 'feet', 'only', 'glimmering', 'humour', 'otherwise', 'relentlessly', 'serious', 'show', 'Admittedly', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'see', 'funny', 'side', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'infected', 'shot', 'poisoned', 'gassed', 'tortured', 'irradiated', 'little', 'levity', 'offset', 'grimness', 'provide', 'welcome', 'contrast.However', 'want', 'plot', 'sensible', 'semi-plausible', 'plot', 'absent', 'season', 'get', 'not', 'one', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'multiplicity', 'interconnected', 'plots', 'defiance', 'real', 'world', 'principle', 'more', 'complex', 'plot', 'more', 'likely', 'go', 'wrong', 'Moreover', 'occur', 'same', '24', 'hours', 'are', 'run', 'same', 'Moriartyish', 'figure', 'resemblance', 'previous', 'Moriartyish', 'figures', 'living', 'dead', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'Given', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'US', 'intelligence', 'competence', 'inter-agency', 'cooperation', 'guess', 'can', 'be', 'glad', 'such', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'exist', 'did', ""'d"", 'watch', 'television', 'know', 'avoid', 'LA', 'area', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'completely', 'do', 'dastardly', 'East', 'Coast', 'given', '24-hour', 'real-time', 'format', 'Jack', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', '3', 'episodes', 'time', 'audience', 'who', 'survived', 'terror', 'attack', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'boredom', 'course', 'Moriarty', 'blew', 'up', 'D.C.', 'nobody', 'might', 'actually', 'care', '.Anyway', 'individual', 'plots', 'vary', 'improbable', 'totally', 'ludicrous', 'combination', 'daft', 'measure', 'culminate', 'final', 'six', 'hours', 'so', 'conclusion', 'such', 'mind-boggling', 'absurdity', 'one', 'one', 'anyway', 'one', 'head', 'disbelief', 'anyone', 'could', 'write', 'such', 'stuff', 'old', 'Dilbert', 'line', 'admire', 'ability', 'get', 'paid', 'Suspension', 'disbelief', 'sometimes', 'catastrophically.Then', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Jack', 'Charmed', 'Life', 'Jack', 'Invincible', 'Indestructible', 'Inexhaustible', 'Miracle', 'Worker', 'All-Wise', 'find', 'character', 'do', 'think', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'well', 'appealing', 'appalling', 'equal', 'measure', 'Do', 'people', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'single-minded', 'Jack', 'exist', 'hope', 'not', 'case', 'find', 'Jack', 'less', 'less', 'credible', 'normal', 'mortal', 'more', 'more', 'superhero', 'would', 'dearly', 'love', 'believe', 'are', 'protected', 'superheroes', 'capable', 'leaping', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'recent', 'history', 'shown', 'world', 'somewhat', 'bereft', 'such', 'people', 'Thankfully', 'world', 'equally', 'bereft', 'Moriartys.One', 'bothersome', 'aspect', 'ever', 'more', 'frequent', 'recourse', 'torture', 'first', 'rather', 'last', 'resort', 'Moreover', 'always', 'getting', 'right', 'information', 'right', 'time', 'Amnesty', 'Who', 'then', 'show', 'probably', 'so', 'popular', 'least', 'partially', 'picture', 'how', 'post-9/11', 'America', 'surrounded', 'infiltrated', 'nasties', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'accents', 'fighting', 'existence', 'barred', 'One', 'could', 'nearly', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'show', 'US', 'Administration', 'propaganda', 'designed', 'fuel', 'Americans', 'paranoia', 'keep', 'up', 'atmosphere', 'fear', 'so', 'necessary', 'sustain', 'current', 'Administration.In', 'short', 'order', 'enjoy', '24', 'one', 'simply', 'be', 'joke', 'were', 'accepting', 'Jack', 'plot', 's', 'basic', 'principle', 'show', 'nothing', 'exceeds', 'excess', 'sort', 'escapist', 'fairy', 'tale', 'grown-ups', 'like', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'bid', 'fond', 'farewell', 'more', '24', 'purchases', 'slight', 'feelings', 'sadness', 'was', 'good', 'lasted', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'justify', 'buying', 'what', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'More', 'Same', 'feel', 'need', 'bound', 'be', 'one', 'German', 'channels', 'However', 'lovers', 'whiz-bang', 'entertainment', 'lots', 'explosions', 'never-ending', 'mortality', 'rate', 'b', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'arise', 'go', 'forth', 'buy']",N/A

The show's hero, Jack Bauer, does not exist in real life but he captures the popular imagination and our wish for individuals who can step up and do what's necessary in times of extreme crisis.Season 4 is easily one of best seasons of the show in its 8-year run, and there's a fair argument that it *is* the best.

Mary Ann (mole) is new at CTU and given high-level clearance when she blackmails Edgar........2. Mary Ann (again) overhears conversation between Edgar and Chloe which she later uses against Edgar.  This she does while standing at the top of the stairs  too far away from them to be able to cath the conversation.On the other hand, Jack who is 10 feet away from terrorist in convenience store has a phone conversation with Chloe explaining his ploy to stage a holdup in order to delay terrorist.3.  The list goes on.......I still gave it 3 stars because, it is still exciting to watch and Kiefer Sutherland continues to give a strong and consistent performance throughout.

However it was probably time to clear out a few of the weaker characters such as Kim Bauer who hadn't really been important in the last two series.

Her husband how she is seperated from later appears to fight for her affections with Jack, and he is involved in one of the most amazing plot lines in all of the series.  Without giving too much away, Jack has to make a life or death decision, with dire consequences, this plot line probably surprised me more than any other in all 4 series, that is until the ending!The ending is truly amazing, the best of all the series, I wont give it away but you'll never guess it, though it once again all makes sense in the end.

Still there are a couple of things I wonder about: 1) How many moles are in CTU 2) Are any of the agents other than Jack like the guys that wore the red shirts in ""Star Trek""?The fourth rolls forward with Jack being fired from CTU by his new boss. He ends up at the Department of Defense working for the Secretary of Defense (William DeVane) and falling in love with his boss' daughter. Jack gets drawn back into CTU when he comes to Los Angeles with his boss. While in L.A. his boss is kidnapped by terrorists who plan on executing him live on the internet after he's been tried for his ""crimes"". Things are a lot more complex than they seem when a series of conspiracies come to light masterminded by a terrorist named Marwan.

937548,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000B837XI,Wheelchair Assassin,"[3, 4]","God, I love 24.  I always thought the premise behind it was pretty cool, but it hasn't become a critical and fan favorite just because of its hooky idea: since its inception in 2001 it's survived its critics and become one of the most consistently entertaining shows on TV.  Honestly, the criticisms of this show as preposterous are getting a bit old at this point.  I mean, come on, from the very first ad for season one it should've been obvious the premise for 24 was farfetched--a spy drama that unfolds in real time over 24 episodes?  Obviously, at that point some people were just going to go with it or not go with it, and just as obviously Fox is going to continue milking the concept as long as ratings are good; they'd be stupid not to.  Shakespeare's plays were full of contrivances; that doesn't mean they made for bad drama.  More to the point, this is TV for Pete's sake, and while some people are obviously content to watch mundane reality shows about wife-swapping, makeovers, and people inexplicably trying to get a job working for Donald Trump, I'll take escapist entertainment, thank you very much.  And if that means accepting the occasional plot stretch, so be it.Anyway, now that I've gotten off my soapbox, I'll just say this: of the three seasons of 24 I've watched (one and two being the others), I'd have to say season four is the best.  The melodrama and hokey plot devices of the first two seasons are largely absent here (and there are no mountain lions or amnesia to be found this time around, thank God), resulting in a darker and more tightly structured watch that actually raises the sense of danger and the emotional stakes even higher.  Still, the basic formula remains unchanged: duplicity, political intrigue, emotional fireworks, troubled relationships, and action, action, action.  Even with some comic relief injected (mostly by the ever-entertaining CTU analyst Chloe O'Brian), the prospect of death hangs heavily over this season as the unthinkable extent of the day's terrorist plots is progressively revealed.Once again in the middle of it all is Jack Bauer, who by now has to have gotten on the short list of television's all-time great tough guys.  Even though 24 has always been a plot-driven show, Kiefer Sutherland has managed to turn Jack into one of TV's most memorable and defining characters of the 21st century.  Seriously, is it possible by now to picture anyone else in the role of Jack Bauer?  I for one can barely even picture Sutherland in another role, and I've *seen* him in other roles.  Even when the plot starts getting silly (which isn't much of a problem here, although it does pop up occasionally) Jack always remains the show's calm, collected center, a model of gravitas with a steely glare and a deadly accurate shot.  This season is sort of the ultimate culmination of his tormented hero persona, as we once again see his commitment to his job and country outweigh all other considerations, and he pays some heavy personal prices for it.Even better, Jack actually gets a suitable counterpoint on the other side this time.  As in season two, the villains here are (mostly) Islamic radicals, but they're much better developed this time around, and they're also an improvement over the Dennis-Hopper led Serbs from season one.  Much of the acclaim this season generated was directed at Shohreh Agdashloo for her ultra-chilling portrayal of Dina Araz, and rightly so: she nails the dual role of protective mother and cold-blooded terrorist, with different facets of her character emerging as the season goes on (ironically, I read that she's pretty much banned from ever going home to Iran because of her criticism of that country's regime).  I actually thought some of the love she was given should have been directed elsewhere, though, as the terrorists' head honcho was nothing short of a classic bad guy in an even more pivotal role.  Arnold Vosloo is creepily believable as Habib Marwan, the quintessential true beliver who's unencumbered by any considerations of compassion or self-interest.  It's Marwan's twisted sense of idealism that makes him the most dangerous kind of guy there is: he's willing to do anything and kill anybody precisely because he truly believes that what he's doing is right.  He's coldly cerebral about what he does, but at the same time he's obviously completely committed to a higher cause, a contradiction that's conveyed extremely well here.Good as it is, to my mind this season does present one flaw with 24's groundbreaking format: the show has almost become too good for it.  Sure, the real-time concept was a great way to hook viewers looking for something different, but by this point the show has become so complex, detailed and intriguing that such a crutch isn't even necessary.  I actually had some early conflicts about taking the plunge into watching this season because the idea of another 24-hour adventure seemed too gimmicky to me, and I'd hate to think of anyone else being scared off by the concept.  I've started wondering whether this show might work better if it were freed from the constraints of its 24-hour running time, but as that will almost certainly never happen we probably won't know.

937552,AP3B615GM191G,B000B837XI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","Just like the previous three seasons of ""24"", Season Four will take you on a 24-hour thrill-ride, with mind-blowing action, drama, and twists and turns in every episode.  Though the basic formula of the show is the same (CTU is still fighting terrorism, Jack Bauer is still really intense, etc.), the writers/producers are still able to produce some fantastic dramatic scenes, not exactly an easy feat after three years.However, what really sets this season apart from the previous three is its focus on the relationship between characters.  First, there is the relationship between Bauer and Audrey Raines, who is pulled into the terrorism when her father, the Secretary of Defense, is abducted early in the day.  Her relationship with Jack is tested in nearly every episode, and that pairing ultimately provides the most drama of the entire season.Also, agent Michelle Dessler is back, this time as head of CTU, and her rocky relationship with former CTU agent Tony Almeida is showcased throughout the season.  Though I won't give away all of Tony's involvement in this fourth season, I will say that he at least plays a part in the day's activities.So far, after watching the first four seasons of ""24"", each season has had a certain plot or character ""thread"" that really made the show come alive for me.  In Season One it was the confliction of President David Palmer.  In Season Two it was the all-out intensity of Jack Bauer.  In Season Three it was the downright horrors of biological terrorism.  Thus, in Season Four, the ""thread"" I enjoyed the most was the relationships between many of the main characters.  The terrorism-stopping plots were still interesting, and the action scenes were still intense, but (at least to me) this season really was all about the relationships.I am very interested to see what ""thread"" will hook me in Season Five!",5,All About Relationships,1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1856,"['Just', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons', '24', 'Season', 'Four', 'will', 'take', '24-hour', 'thrill-ride', 'mind-blowing', 'action', 'drama', 'twists', 'turns', 'episode', 'basic', 'formula', 'show', 'same', 'CTU', 'still', 'fighting', 'terrorism', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'still', 'really', 'intense', 'etc', 'writers/producers', 'are', 'still', 'able', 'produce', 'fantastic', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'not', 'exactly', 'easy', 'feat', 'three', 'years.However', 'what', 'really', 'season', 'apart', 'previous', 'three', 'focus', 'relationship', 'characters', 'First', 'relationship', 'Bauer', 'Audrey', 'Raines', 'who', 'pulled', 'terrorism', 'when', 'father', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'abducted', 'early', 'day', 'relationship', 'Jack', 'tested', 'nearly', 'episode', 'pairing', 'ultimately', 'most', 'drama', 'entire', 'season.Also', 'agent', 'Michelle', 'Dessler', 'back', 'time', 'head', 'CTU', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'former', 'CTU', 'agent', 'Tony', 'Almeida', 'showcased', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Tony', 'involvement', 'fourth', 'season', 'will', 'say', 'least', 'plays', 'part', 'day', 'activities.So', 'far', 'watching', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', '24', 'season', 'had', 'certain', 'plot', 'character', 'thread', 'really', 'made', 'show', 'come', 'alive', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'confliction', 'President', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'all-out', 'intensity', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'downright', 'horrors', 'biological', 'terrorism', 'Thus', 'Season', 'Four', 'thread', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'relationships', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'terrorism-stopping', 'plots', 'were', 'still', 'interesting', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'still', 'intense', 'least', 'season', 'really', 'was', 'relationships.I', 'am', 'very', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'thread', 'will', 'hook', 'Season', 'Five']",N/A
