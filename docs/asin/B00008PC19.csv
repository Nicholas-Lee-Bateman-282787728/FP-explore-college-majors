The filmmakers pulled no punches, especially when depicting scenes of torture at the hands of the Apaches, none of which is exploitative or gratuitous, and the Apaches' viewpoint is poignantly expressed, which lends credence to some of the atrocities.Overall, a must own movie. Thank God it's now on DVD. What are you waiting for? Buy it now!A quick bit of related trivia: There's a scene in Brian DePalma's  &quot;Carrie&quot; where William Katt and Amy Irving are studying together and A movie is playing in the background on a television.

The plot isn't original, but the actors are very appropriate, specially James Garner. It's rare to see Bibi Anderssen, a Swedish artist from Ingmar Bergman movies, in a western. Perhaps Sidney Poitier seems some ridiculous with his rare, extravagant suit until the fight begins.And there are another factor some westerns have, some not, and is the soundtrack.

746327,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00008PC19,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[23, 30]","I love a good western, and Duel at Diablo certainly contained enough elements of the classic western movie to keep me interested throughout it's 103 minute running time, but some flaws seemed a bit obvious.The movie centers on a plot to deliver a cache of ammunition from one fort to another through a harsh and foreboding desert land.  The troops are green and inexperienced, and the desert terrain is the least of their worries as a local Apache tribe has decided to mount a last stand against the injustices heaped upon them and attack the convey and steal the munitions in an effort to free themselves and their spirits from the poor treatment and paltry reservation land given to them by the uncaring government.James Garner plays Jess Remsburg, an experienced scout who has a personal interest in following the convey to their destination as he believes the murderer of his Native American wife is there.  Sidney Poitier is also along for the ride, as Toller, an ex-army man turned horse dealer that supplies the cavalry with raw mustangs.  Turns out he won't get paid for his recent delivery of horses as they are not saddle broken and he must ride with the convey and tame the horses along the way.  The other recognizable actor is Dennis Weaver, who plays Willard Grange, a merchant who must get a load of supplies to the fort, and wheedles his way to tag along with the cavalry, despite protests from the lieutenant in charge, as the lieutenant thinks speed will be of the utmost importance, with the Apache tribe on the warpath and the lack of experience in his troops.  Also, there is yet another interesting subplot involving Grange and his wife, Ellen, played by Bibi Andersson.  Seems at some point prior to the events in the movie, she was kidnapped by the Apaches and escaped only to return to a disappointed husband and unfriendly townspeople as she has now been 'spoiled' with her extended contact with the Apache tribe.  She has a special interest in returning to the tribe, which is revealed later in the movie.The director does a wonderful job maintaining continuity between the various plot threads, and conveying the sense of danger between the harsh environments and the disgruntled Native Americans on the Warpath.  The fighting is done with a sense of realism and seems quite brutal at times, but never really goes over the top and there is very little glorification of the old west, as seen in many other westerns.  The various subplots do provide a nice sense of depth for the main characters, helping the audience develop a feeling of familiarity towards the characters, even the Native Americans.  I never got a sense that the movie was portraying the Native Americans as bad guys, and the cavalry as good guys, but just people doing what they had to do based on either orders from superior officers, in the case of the cavalry, or the need for survival and a tired sense of being pushed around a regulated to less than hospitable lands by an uncaring government, in the case of the Native Americans.The flaws of the movie, in my opinion, are few, but somewhat noticeable.  The biggest one was the music.  The western score was tinged with a sort of bouncy beat that detracted seriously from what was being shown on the screen.  It would, almost in a humorous fashion, counteract the urgency and danger in specific scenes.  Another issue I had, a subtler one, was the character Toller, played by Sidney Portier.  He's an excellent actor, and I have no problems with his performance, but since this movie was probably set in the early to mid 19th century, I found it really odd how accepting all the Caucasian characters were of having an African American so closely in the midst as I believe the was a lot more racial intolerance at this time than the movie would have you believe.  Sure, there was some towards the Native Americans in the movie, but no one seemed to notice Toller was an African American, and the cavalry troops certainly didn't seem to mind taking orders from him after their lieutenant was injured.  On the flipside, it was refreshing to think that things could have been this way back then, but realistically, I doubt it.  The total absence of any racial tensions between Toller and the Caucasian characters seemed to really stand out.All in all good, solid western movie, with some pretty violent scenes that portrays both sides of the conflict in a seemingly real sense, allowing for empathy to develop for both sides, showing us the world is not black and white, figuratively speaking.  The picture is in wide screen format, and is crisp and clear showing many beautiful desert landscapes between all the killing.  The audio was quite good, also, sounding clear und unmuddled.  There are subtitles available, but I didn't need to use them as I could hear all the dialog clearly.  Throw in a trailer and that's it for the special features, but, as always, I'd prefer an excellent print and good audio to gobs of useless features I'll probably never watch.",3,A good western film

746331,A2DH4EV86KTRIO,B00008PC19,Esar Shvartz,"[3, 5]","This is the most unusual western ever made, and one of the best. The many reviewers of this movie have done a good job analyzing it, I am just going to add a few more.  First, the direction of Ralph Nelson is superb. We have here a most engrosing atmosphere of the old west as it was, cruel and unforgiven, and the unusual musical score is daunting and a major element here.  Think about 'High Noon' or the 'Third Man' without their magnificent sound tracks. This is one of the few movies which shows the unusual cruely and sadism of the Indians, such as agonazing slow death by burning, and a promise to bury alive our blond heroin. For those who cannot believe how sadistic the plain Indians were, I refer them to a few recent books by Michno. I know that there are many multiculturalists who have never had to fight for their freedom and many young Americans who's cruel western history have been denied to them in school who would refuse to believe that the 'proud native Americans' could rival the inquisition.  Wake up dudes, the settleing of America was saturated with blood and gore of European pioneers, who were tortured and enslaved by the Indians.  Of course, as it is pointed out in this movie, the Indians were lied to, deceived, and deprived of their hunting grounds. And, as some historians maintain, there was no better way of settling a wild country by a Victorian culture confronted with stone age savagesTwo errors in this movie require comments. In one scene, our heroin wears tight pantsrevealing a sexy anatomy that would drive the entire seventh cavalry to madness. No woman in west wore tight pants, or any pants for that matter.  Second, Sidney Poitier has a major part as a ex-soldier-horse dealer-gunfighter. There were no such blacks in the west. There is no record of even one black gunfighter in the west.  The west was largely racist and didn't welcome non Europeans.

746333,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,B00008PC19,FRED C. DOBBS,"[4, 5]","The 1960's featured some of most underappreciated, un-talked-about, forgotten, yet, finest Westerns ever. These include HOMBRE [1967], THE APPALOOSA [1966], NEVADA SMITH [1966] and this film. With the box-office flop of THE ALAMO [1960] it appeared fans were growing weary of the Western genre until they began riding the crest of the ""Spaghetti Western"" craze heralded by FISTFUL OF DOLLARS [1964] and culminating in the classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY [1966]. However lost in this transition were these four excellent films. DUEL AT DIABLO's biggest handicap was its title which evoked thoughts of a rough-and-tumble, violent, bloody TOMBSTONE [1993] or WILD BUNCH [1969]-type story. None of that here as this was more a provocative film dealing with social egoism, social tolerance, courage and survival. It's powerful assests are its storyline [American prejudgement and mistreatment of Native Americans], it's variegated group of actors, all giving fine performances, and possibly the most evocative, if not the greatest, music score of any Western ever [ok, ok, THE ALAMO's ""Green Leaves of Summer"" is right there, and Max Steiner's score for THE CHARGE AT FEATHER RIVER, 1953, is right at its tail]. Here, we have James Garner seeking vengence for the murder of his Indian wife by a white man, and Dennis Weaver embarrassed and distancing himself from his rescued white spouse who had been kidnapped by the Indians and conceived a child by one of them. In the middle of this mess, the US army is trying to do the right thing---protect American lives. Garner, surly, vulnerable but determined, underplays his role well and is his usual excellent self. Weaver, always one of our most underappreciated actors, is marvelous as the bigoted then ambivalent husband of 'white squaw' Bibi Anderson. Sidney Poitier portrays a rare figure for those days, a Black man in  a white mans business---breaking and selling horses---and doing it with confidence, effrontery and cojones. Bill Travers is the leutenant who has to lead this motley group from one Fort to another through Indian territory---a stereotypic Western sojourn made interesting by the small size of the group and their conflicting self-interests. Travers is a complex characterization as he is self-serving yet often sympathetic but always dutiful to his Country and the Army in the usual automaton fashion. The score is awesome evoking a sense of both duty and destiny from our heroes as they arrive hobbled and fragmented for 'the last stand' at the boxed-in Diablo Canyon. How this score is not on any of the numerous Western CD compilations out on the market is incomprehensible to me and just confirms how these record companies just don't know what they are doing. Director Ralph Nelson went on to present the theme of US injustice against the Indians in a less subtle fashion in SOLDIER BLUE [1970]---a similarly offbeat yet more violent Western. Although HOMBRE was probably the best Western tackling this theme, Duel at Diablo had more drama, more action, was more fun and had the great soundtrack. I had the rare pleasure of seeing this film in a theater when it was first released in 1966 and it had an even greater dramatic impact on the big screen including the opening & closing knife-cutting-an-""X"" on the screen image.

Viewed today, it still packs a fair wallop - which is hardly surprising considering that director Ralph Nelson went on to make the ultra-bloody Soldier Blue a few years later. The movie closely follows Marvin H Albert's novel (he's had a few of his western novels adapted for the screen, including The Law and Jake Wade) in its story of a cavalry patrol that inadvertently ends up in a life and death struggle with an Apache war party that has skipped the reservation. The action sequences are among the most exciting on film, particularly the initial ambush and the race to reach Diablo Canyon (the only source of water for miles). James Gardner is suitably tough as the army scout and Dennis Weaver comes across well as the rascist trader with a nasty secret. Neal Hefti's pulsating music score adds to the tension. I'd put this up there among the top ten westerns, because it succeeds in doing what it sets out to do - to give you a roller coaster of a ride while being relatively intelligent to boot.

For my efforts and this meager accomplishment my parents took me to see DUEL AT DIABLO. This was a pretty neat film and a pretty violent one at that. I loved it. At that age back in those days this was a neat stuff. No doubt it is one of my cherished memories.DUEL AT DIABLO is an exceptional Western full of gritty action, unsentimental characters and austere and foreboding landscapes. Many of this film's elements are a bit more reality based considering the harshness and brutality of the chiseled faces of its characters, locations and violence all breaking from the traditional Western genre. Neal Hefti's innovative modern sounding score is a giant departure from that which Dimitri Tiomkin had established for the genre. Here Hefti breaks down that myth with a cool and easy sounding reoccurring theme which actually reflects the indifference of the characters' aspirations to appreciate the grandeur of the traditional Western setting or lifestyle.  Director Ralph Nelson chooses to represent the degradation of the American Indian as a society driven to hostile acts commensurate to the injustices of their plight. Under Nelson's direction the Indians are not an inherently violent society but are survivors of a hostile environment and are a natural force to be reckoned with. However, this point is often overlooked by the somewhat engaging and rousing visual crescendo of the violence. Along with HOUR OF THE GUN this is one of James Garner's more brutal and cynical roles and is again motivated by revenge. Sidney Poitier also is not along for the ride for any ambitions of nobility. As a horse breaker ex-cavalryman Poitier must accompany the raw troupe, under the command of Bill Travers, into hostile territory breaking horses along the way for the army or he stands to not get paid a cent. Every character has reasons for being embroiled in this tale but it seems to be for reasons of revenge, greed or just plain survival.",5,My Promotion Gift,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,2052,"['Back', 'Sixth', 'Grade', 'was', 'promotion', 'present', 'promotion', 'present', 'Yes', 'got', 'promoted', 'Sixth', 'Grade', 'efforts', 'meager', 'accomplishment', 'parents', 'took', 'see', 'DUEL', 'AT', 'DIABLO', 'was', 'pretty', 'neat', 'film', 'pretty', 'violent', 'one', 'loved', 'age', 'back', 'days', 'was', 'neat', 'stuff', 'doubt', 'one', 'cherished', 'memories.DUEL', 'AT', 'DIABLO', 'exceptional', 'Western', 'full', 'gritty', 'action', 'unsentimental', 'characters', 'austere', 'foreboding', 'landscapes', 'Many', 'film', 'elements', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'reality', 'based', 'considering', 'harshness', 'brutality', 'chiseled', 'characters', 'locations', 'violence', 'breaking', 'traditional', 'Western', 'genre', 'Neal', 'Hefti', 'innovative', 'modern', 'sounding', 'score', 'giant', 'departure', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'had', 'established', 'genre', 'Here', 'Hefti', 'down', 'myth', 'cool', 'easy', 'sounding', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'actually', 'indifference', 'characters', 'aspirations', 'appreciate', 'grandeur', 'traditional', 'Western', 'setting', 'lifestyle', 'Director', 'Ralph', 'Nelson', 'represent', 'degradation', 'American', 'Indian', 'society', 'driven', 'hostile', 'acts', 'commensurate', 'injustices', 'plight', 'Nelson', 'direction', 'Indians', 'are', 'not', 'inherently', 'violent', 'society', 'are', 'survivors', 'hostile', 'environment', 'are', 'natural', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'However', 'point', 'often', 'overlooked', 'somewhat', 'engaging', 'rousing', 'visual', 'crescendo', 'violence', 'HOUR', 'THE', 'GUN', 'one', 'James', 'Garner', 'more', 'brutal', 'cynical', 'roles', 'again', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'also', 'not', 'along', 'ride', 'ambitions', 'nobility', 'horse', 'breaker', 'ex-cavalryman', 'Poitier', 'must', 'accompany', 'raw', 'troupe', 'command', 'Bill', 'Travers', 'hostile', 'territory', 'breaking', 'horses', 'way', 'army', 'not', 'get', 'paid', 'cent', 'character', 'reasons', 'being', 'embroiled', 'tale', 'be', 'reasons', 'revenge', 'greed', 'just', 'plain', 'survival']",N/A
746336,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00008PC19,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","James Garner's easy-going charm made him a bankable star for most of his career. But, every so often, he didn't mind stepping out of his comfort zone to try different, more hard-bitten roles. Case in point: DUEL AT DIABLO, a near classic western drama which not only showcased a more intense James Garner but also the great Sidney Poitier. DUEL AT DIABLO was made in 1966 and it's not your typical western. This one eschews the black and white good guy/bad guy sensibilities often reflected in this film genre. Instead, DUEL AT DIABLO unfurls themes colored more in shades of grey and not so easily resolved. This is far removed from the lighthearted likes ofSupport Your Local Sheriffor MAVERICK.Always gritty and, at times, bleak and brooding, DUEL AT DIABLO is peopled with complex, no-nonsense types. As the film rolls along, don't be too surprised if you find your opinions shifting with regards to these characters. Almost from the get-go it dawns on us that this picture doesn't intend to run by the numbers. The opening sequence tells of frontier scout Jess Remsberg (Garner) rescuing a white woman abducted by Apaches and returning her to her home, only to have the townspeople and the woman's husband treat her with indifference and scorn. So, right away, there's an undercurrent of unease felt on the screen.Meanwhile, Remsberg learns of the brutal murder of his Comanche wife and means to find the killer and then not kill him easy. He agrees to scout for a cavalry troop heading thru perilous Apache country with a cache of ammo and bolstered in part by green recruits, as the troop's destination of a distant Army fort coincides with Remsberg's. Along for the ride and not ecstatic about it is a tough but well-dressed horse breaker and ex-soldier named Toller (Poitier). A civilian with his own shipment also manages to attach himself to the cavalry. The last member of this military jaunt happens to be the same woman Remsberg had rescued, as it turns out she has further personal business with the Apaches.The action sequences are moderately intense. There are passages replete with rollicking fistfights, gunfights, ambushes, chases, and fleeting moments of torture (or, rather, the aftermath of torture). DUEL AT DIABLO addresses certain social issues (the American Indian's plight, the persona non grata status of Mrs. Grange, who involuntarily had spent time with the ""savages""), yet the film is clever enough to cloak its messages under an action-packed plot. DUEL AT DIABLO doesn't champion the proud Apaches' cause as much as attempt to have a representation of their side of things. They do come off a bit sympathetic (it seems that the tribe treated Mrs. Grange better than the townspeople), but, well, naturally, I was rooting more for Garner and Poitier's posse to come out on top. The action culminates in a harrowing last stand at a place called Diablo Canyon. It's intense stuff as the cavalry unit has its members rapidly whittled down. And yet when the good guys do win out and the bad guys led away at gunpoint, it doesn't quite feel like your normal western flick ending. Not everything is tied up in a nice, neat bow. It's very much up in the air whether the hero gets the girl. Remsberg does get his revenge, but whether it's a satisfactory comeuppance, that's another thing. And the Apaches, proud and straight standing to the end, they get sent back to their reservation. Definitely not a happy ending for them...The cast is uniformly very good, with several actors playing against type (notably, Dennis Weaver, in a hiss-worthy role). I'm even fond of that poor Lieutenant with the Irish accent who kept accumulating wounds (poor fella). Sidney Poitier brings his vaunted presence and is cool, commanding and even dapper. It's always a bit of a twist seeing the affable James Garner switch up and play a role this dark and driven. The only other similarly grim western which comes to mind isA Man Called Sledge, and that one's not as good as DUEL AT DIABLO. And Luther Sledge isn't as likable as Jess Remsberg. Garner also imbues Remsberg with this engaging quality of weary savviness. And, as always, Garner is so natural on screen and keeps it so low key that he comes off as wholly believable, making Remsberg's moments of quiet despair and bursts of violence even more palpable things.DUEL AT DIABLO gives you pause, gives you a glimpse of how brutal and unforgiving the American frontier really was. This is a movie in which James Garner doesn't charm or trick the bad guys into submission. Rather, he intimidates and beats the living bejeesus out of them. Garner isn't flashy and mannered in his acting; in fact, you never see him acting, and this is what makes him so good. And, word to the wise, Garner stalking the vengeance trail is something to see.",4,"On the vengeance trail - a darker, meaner James Garner",1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,4800,"['James', 'Garner',

For every SHANE, THE SEARCHERS, DUEL IN THE SUN, MCCABE AND MRS MILLER, UNFORGIVEN, or one of Sergio Leone's innovative and classic spaghetti westerns, there are 50 dozen of these dime-a-dozen stinkers with their clich&eacute;-ridden scripts, staging and acting.  They present a steady stream of bar scenes, knock`em-sock`em brawls, charging and re-charging cavalry, charging and re-charging Indians, incessant bugle-tooting, with nameless faceless Indians and cavalry falling from their horses (to remount out of camera range for multiple passes, for maybe a hundred bucks a pass; ever wonder why the attacking forces never seem to diminish?)  This cookie-cutter flick would have been better served with a cast of unknowns, the second-rate portrayals quite possibly being improved.In one of several heartwarming sub-plots, the Garner character (protagonist) seeks to avenge his Indian wife's premature (off-camera: we never meet her) scalping.  By a typically preposterous coincidence, this dastardly scalper just happens to be right under the protagonist's nose all along, thereby conveniently saving lots of time getting the Fort Concho cavalry to the rescue, since the protagonist doesn't have to spend precious minutes (or hours? who cares?) before the troops can ride out.  Consistent with this sub-plot's pertinence, perhaps the script writers and actors drew straws to determine who the guilty character would be?At one point, Neal Hefti's unavoidably ever-present and at times (unintended) toe-tapping musical score swelled to suggest the entire encampment of Indian women and children were about to break out into a fully choreographed cha-cha sequence. This reviewer had to check the credits to verify that Mel Brooks or Rudy DeLuca (or Gene Wilder lurking somewhere about) were not implicated.Charles Wheeler's Utah landscape photography is gorgeous.

Within seconds of playing this movie we are introduced to the opening scene with a bloody hunting knife slashing the screen to shreds, then hang on! James Garner plays an Army scout trying to find out who murdered and  scalped his Indian wife. Sidney Poitier plays an ex-Army Sergeant now a gambler and bronc buster selling his horses to the Army, Bibi Andersson is a white woman from Fort Creel, kidnapped by the Apaches, her Apache husband is killed and she is recaptured by the Cavalry, but she escapes trying to get back to her tribe, for a reason nobody suspects, and not knowing the Apaches want her dead, her husband was the Chief's son, Dennis Weaver is the husband whose hatred for the Indians is so intense he cannot forgive the woman he loves, no matter how he tries, and Bill Travers is the Army Captain loaded down with weapons and ammo heading out from Fort Creel to Fort Concho with a troop of green recruits, meanwhile, Chata, Bibi Andersson's father-in-law is out to capture the ammo and make a name for himself with a party twice the size of the Army escort.This is not your standard Cavalry vs Indians movie, it's a murder mystery, a comment on race, a story about loyalty, courage, love, forgiveness, and mercy told against a landscape of brutal beauty where only the strong survive, and James Garner is at his best as are the others. The suspense and action build until the final conflict in a box canyon called Diablo, the only water for miles, inside. Even the theme score by Neal Hefti is tough, and in my opinion one of the best Western themes in history.If you're looking for a western that pulls no punches and is as tough and gritty as the actors, story, and landscape, you can't go wrong if you check out DUEL AT DIABLO. You won't see that I purchased this, as I got it from my son for Christmas. Even he liked it and he doesn't like many westerns.As an aside, you might be interested to know that James Garner did his own stunts in the movie, and like so many of the older actors they are believable in their parts, you can actually imagine Garner as the tough Army scout, as well as the others: Poitier, Travers, Weaver they all do an outstanding job.

Being 21 years old I watched ""Maverick"" with James Garner as a kid and really got to like him a lot. Since the releases of Gunsmoke seasons to DVD, I've really gotten to like Dennis Weaver. The other actors in the movie I have never even heard of before but they did their parts really well in the movie.I thought this movie was really good. It kept you interested in what was going to happen next. I didn't like the fact however that in the begining Dennis Weaver's character seemed so caught up in himself and didn't seem to care that his wife kept running back to the Apache's. However during the movie you could start to see it was an act and that it did bother him and he was deep down a caring husband after all. I was however shocked at the end when James Garner found out who it was that had killed his wife. (that happened before the movie starts.)I also, even though I never heard of him before, liked the character of Sidney Poitier. I think that he really did that character really well and very beleivable.Despite the fact that I bought it for James Garner and Dennis Weaver being in it, I really liked this movie and not just because of them  but for the whole cast and the plot.

The movie follows a supply train through the desert as they are harassed by an Apache chief, Chata, and his band of renegades.  Trapped in the desert without any water, the supply train must fight their way out.  There is plenty of good action here as well as very good characters.  The movie deals with racism throughout since one of the main characters was kidnapped by Apaches and forced to live with them.  When she escapes from the village, the people at Fort Creel look down upon her with disgust.James Garner stars as Jess Remsberg, the army scout who is also trying to track down the killer of his Indian wife.  His role is very good and also different from what his fans might be expecting of him.  Sidney Poitier plays Toller, the ex-sergeant who now accompanies the wagon train to break in their new horses for him.  I hadn't seen Poitier in a western, but he is very good in this role alongside Garner.  Dennis Weaver and Bibi Anderson star as the Granges.  Anderson's character was abducted by Apaches and escapes but now wants to go back and live among them.  Weaver's Will Grange is a rascist and very dislikable.  Bill Travers plays Lt.

Dennis Weaver gives a good performance as the conflicted frontier business man whose wife had been abducted by the indians. The Sidney Poitier character is not well developed though he looks dashing in his western garb. The Neil Hefti score takes a while to get used to but is familiar enough not to be too distracting. The indians are protrayed with some degree of social consciousness, though violent in their treatment of captives, which may very well be accurate. And the attitude of many of the white folk toward the indians is certainly not what you might call charitable. An engrossing film, but not one that is designed to put a smile on your face when it's over.

746350,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00008PC19,Wuchak,"[5, 6]","""Duel at Diablo"" is a gritty, realistic, top-notch Western directed by Ralph Nelson and released in 1966. James Garner stars as the independent scout. Garner is, of course, the quintessential Westerner, and this is his best Western role, in my opinion, more serious than Maverick. Sidney Poitier plays a man contracted by the US Army to break-in horses. Although a black man, he's not at all out-of-place in this yarn (it was apparently a new concept at the time to prominently feature black people in Westerns).Dennis Weaver is also on hand as the made-out-to-be-unlikable merchant who ultimately gets his comeuppance (but who can blame him for how he felt?); Bibi Andersson plays his adulterous wife; and Bill Travers is excellent as the Army commander.Aside from the excellent cast ""Duel"" is highlighted by magnificent Southern Utah locations and a phenomenal score by Neal Hefti. Some describe this score as offbeat; I suppose it is, but it somehow fits the Western genre. From what other reviewers say it's obviously a love-it-or-hate-it piece. I happen to love it; in fact, I feel it ranks up there with the best cinematic scores. Interestingly, Jerry Goldsmith ripped-off the basic melody of Hefti's composistion for his equally-excellent score for ""Bandelero!"" two years later.The opening and ending sequences with Hefti's great score are memorable and moving. This is great filmmaking.You'll note that Poitier's character and the Army commander are quite at odds with eachother, but note how one clearly shows his respect and honor toward the other at the very end.""Duel"" was one of the first Westerns I was ever exposed to and is therefore the standard by which I judge other Westerns. Because of this I naturally expect gritty realism and objectivity in any Western I view. This explains why I turned ""Hondo"" off at the 20 minute mark because of its artificial depiction of the Native American. It also explains why I scoff at the goofiness of so many spaghetti Westerns and am bored by their unrealistic, uncaptivating storylines. (Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the entrancing score to ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly;"" it's just that the story itself puts you to sleep).""Duel"" also stands the test of TIME. Seeing it today, it's hardly aged at all. Compare this to, say, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and ""The Searchers,"" classics that haven't aged very well.My overall grade for ""Duel at Diablo"" is A-. Although the first and last acts are strong and compelling, the second act is weak and uninteresting despite the fact that it has lots of calvery v.s. Indians action. Regardless, ""Duel"" ranks up there with the all-time best Westerns like ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""Wyatt Earp,"" ""Nevada Smith,"" True Grit,"" ""Jubal,"" ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Purgatory,"" ""Shane/Pale Rider"" (essentially the same story), ""Bandelero!,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""MacKenna's Gold"" and ""3:10 to Yuma.""",5,Ranks Up there with the All-Time Best Westerns,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,2901,"['Duel', 'Diablo', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'top-notch', 'Western', 'directed', 'Ralph', 'Nelson', 'released', '1966', 'James', 'Garner', 'independent', 'scout', 'Garner', 'course', 'quintessential', 'Westerner', 'best', 'Western', 'role', 'opinion', 'more', 'serious', 'Maverick', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'man', 'contracted', 'US', 'Army', 'break-in', 'horses', 'black', 'man', 'not', 'out-of-place', 'yarn', 'was', 'apparently', 'new', 'concept', 'time', 'prominently', 'feature', 'black', 'people', 'Westerns', '.Dennis', 'Weaver', 'also', 'hand', 'made-out-to-be-unlikable', 'merchant', 'who', 'ultimately', 'comeuppance', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'how', 'felt', 'Bibi', 'Andersson', 'adulterous', 'wife', 'Bill', 'Travers', 'excellent', 'Army', 'commander.Aside', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Duel', 'highlighted', 'magnificent', 'Southern', 'Utah', 'locations', 'phenomenal', 'score', 'Neal', 'Hefti', 'describe', 'score', 'offbeat', 'suppose', 'somehow', 'Western', 'genre', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'obviously', 'love-it-or-hate-it', 'piece', 'happen', 'love', 'fact', 'feel', 'there', 'best', 'cinematic', 'scores', 'Interestingly', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'ripped-off', 'basic', 'melody', 'Hefti', 'composistion', 'equally-excellent', 'score', 'Bandelero', 'two', 'years', 'later.The', 'opening', 'ending', 'sequences', 'Hefti', 'great', 'score', 'are', 'memorable', 'moving', 'great', 'filmmaking.You', ""'ll"", 'note', 'Poitier', 'character', 'Army', 'commander', 'are', 'quite', 'odds', 'eachother', 'note', 'how', 'one', 'clearly', 'respect', 'honor', 'other', 'very', 'end', 'Duel', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'Westerns', 'was', 'ever', 'exposed', 'therefore', 'standard', 'judge', 'other', 'Westerns', 'naturally', 'expect', 'gritty', 'realism', 'objectivity', 'Western', 'view', 'why', 'turned', 'Hondo', 'off', '20', 'minute', 'mark', 'artificial', 'depiction', 'Native', 'American', 'also', 'why', 'scoff', 'goofiness', 'so', 'many', 'spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'am', 'bored', 'unrealistic', 'uncaptivating', 'storylines', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'LOVE', 'entrancing', 'score', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'just', 'story', 'sleep', 'Duel', 'also', 'test', 'TIME', 'Seeing', 'today', 'hardly', 'aged', 'Compare', 'say', 'Man', 'Who', 'Shot', 'Liberty', 'Valance', 'Searchers', 'classics', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'very', 'well.My', 'overall', 'grade', 'Duel', 'Diablo', 'A-', 'first', 'last', 'acts', 'are', 'strong', 'compelling', 'second', 'act', 'weak', 'uninteresting', 'fact', 'lots', 'calvery', 'v.s', 'Indians', 'action', 'Regardless', 'Duel', 'up', 'there', 'all-time', 'best', 'Westerns', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'Wales', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Nevada', 'Smith', 'True', 'Grit', 'Jubal', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Purgatory', 'Shane/Pale', 'Rider', 'essentially', 'same', 'story', 'Bandelero', 'Unforgiven', 'MacKenna', 'Gold', '3:10', 'Yuma']",N/A
