Dana Ashbrook is very convincing as a successful young man who seems to have everything. That is until he meets her. Life is not easy or fair, and when we least expect it someone comes into your life and the whole world changes. You find out what really makes you happy even through the pain.",5,Taking a Leap of Faith,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,430,"['was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'did', 'Tisha', 'Campbell-Martin', 'expresses', 'humor', 'passion', 'love', 'character', 'Dana', 'Ashbrook', 'very', 'convincing', 'successful', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'everything', 'Life', 'not', 'easy', 'fair', 'when', 'least', 'expect', 'someone', 'life', 'whole', 'world', 'changes', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happy', 'even', 'pain']",N/A

I didn't view it as an i/r love story, but as two lonelypeople finding each other! I thought her character was a little mean to him, but I guess it was her way of dealingwith her situation!

The DVD itself offered few features, only scene selection and cast reviews. Oh and the trailer to the film. Other than that, you just have this movie. Honestly, I got the movie because it seemed like a pretty good film with some pretty good actors in it. That was fun, but what I didn't bargain for was the long speech the gay man gave about his partner and their love and the odd ways of transitioning (the screen over screen action). The timeline was a bit vague for me and I was wondering how they would show a real, lasting relationship between the two main characters without it looking like they were just having a fling in the mountains. They failed for me on that one. All of a sudden they are married and living together and well... it wasn't the most believable. The ending seemed a bit rushed. I mean, by the middle of the movie, you knew she was going to die, but even when she did it was like ""Oh, okay, she died."" They didn't even get to do anything together! Oh wait, they walked around the beach once. Like, his dream of starting his band, her catering business (we saw her work once)... Honestly it looked like she stayed home all day while he went to work at a job he hated. Then she nagged him about how he shouldn't work at a job he hated, but follow his dreams. Well, it felt like the day he did that (literally THE DAY!), she dies! I mean, seriously???One thing I did like is: For this to be a story about a relationship between a white man and black woman, race wasn't a factor in their or their friends' conversations/actions. I appreciated that because anytime I have watched a film with that combo of interracial relationships, they always (Oh wait, Star Trek didn't make a deal of it) make it seem like the world was against their love or something and in the end they break up because it was just too much to handle (or in the case of Something New, the woman couldn't handle it). Well, this movie didn't do that. So, that was a nice thing to see.So, as you can see, my beef is more with the timeline of the story than the story itself. As I was watching the movie, I was able to guess (it wasn't much of a guess) the next move before it happened, so the suspense factor wasn't there for me. (Like when she mentioned how she wanted to get married and 2 minutes later he's like ""Let's do it!"" I was sitting there thinking ""Of course he had to say that next! There's only 20 minutes left in the movie!"" lol)In short, good movie to watch once, but I probably wont watch it again.",2,Bad...

In the week since purchasing it, I have watched it 5 times!Dana Ashbrook has been around for a long time. Even though he's in his early 40s, he looks much younger. His large, expressive eyes have a bit of innocence to them and he has this slight quirkiness that is irresistible Oh and he's very easy on the eyes! He and Tisha Campbell-Martin have an adorable chemistry. It's not the kind of hot, sexually charged chemistry where you expect the two leads to rip each others clothes off every chance they  get. It's a sweet, innocent chemistry.  thought they not only looked adorable together. But, they played together well and seemed to enjoy each other.Rob's serious, uptight personality is a great compliment to Ann's feisty free spirit. The scenery in the film is GORGEOUS! I have never been much for mountains. But, after seeing this flm I have got to visit the Sierra Mountains.I absolutely LOVED the scene where Rob(Dana Ashbrook) visits all the places he and his wife went.The reciting of the poem was just heart warming. I'll not spoil it for those who have yet to see it. Do yourself a favor and either rent it or just spend money and buy it. You wuill be so happy you did.
