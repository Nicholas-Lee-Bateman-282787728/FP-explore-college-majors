588191,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKLW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[4, 10]","I cannot stress the fact that this film has been overplayed and recycled through Hollywood more times that I can count.  While I have read some reviews that claim that this is one of Lawrence's more creative roles yet, I can only laugh and gag simultaneously at these words.  Lawrence was a major contributor to the downfall of this film.  He provided no character analysis, no development, and definitely no humor to the entire story.  It was as if we were watching a dress rehearsal in progress before the final script arrived with all of Lawrence's funny bits.  From the quick introduction at the beginning of the film (a mere 7 minutes of character introduction), until the incoherent ending that was trying to monopolize on the popularity of Gladiator, we never see Lawrence's character of ""Jamal"" or ""Skywalker"" (depending on the care of the actors) emerge from the film.  This was merely Martin Lawrence cashing in on his already overplayed self, stretching no further than his comfortable limits and never exerting anything ""fresh"".  He has fallen into the cracks of the Hollywood recycling bin and Black Knight reinforces that idea.Sadly, Lawrence isn't backed up with any better acting or story.  Tom Wilkinson has done some amazing films during his career, but apparently was looking to buy a new car with this film.  It required no ""real"" acting from him, just sloppy drunkenness with cliched moments near the end that could have been pulled from any other film like this one.  I think that was my major problem with this film (beside the lackluster Lawrence) was the story.  There wasn't any.  It felt like we were forced from the beginning to all of our different places and events just to fill time.  There wasn't any redeeming value from the story.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that whomever wrote this screenplay may have...gasp...plagiarized from nearly every other film like this one out there.  The structure was nothing new, the formula literally had dust on it, and nobody seemed to care.  Lawrence obviously didn't from the performance that he gave, but I expected more from Mr. Wilkinson who has impressed me in the past.  This was not the best showcase for his talent, or for anyone's talent to say the least.  We must always remember that it begins with a story, and if it doesn't sound good on paper than it isn't going to translate well onto the screen.  This is a rule to live by for everyone involved with the Black Knight debacle.Finally, I normally don't mention this in my reviews, but with this film it just stood out more than any other that I have seen, but the production of this film was horrible.  The costumes, the sets, and even the way the shots were framed seemed ""cheap"" in so many ways.  The costumes are the first that come to mind because Lawrence always seemed like he was wearing something that was made with haste.  How could he have quickly made this garment in the time that he was in this land?  Who knows, but it was ""cheap"" and only lowered this film further into the muck pit.  If the story is going to be bad, and the actors are not going to give their full potential by actually doing what they are paid ... to be creative ... than at least give us something to look at Production Team!  Unfortunately, there was nothing ravishing to even glance at.  The entire Medieval World that Lawrence works at from the beginning is ""cheap"" and obviously a set.  I want a film to take me away from Hollywood and give me my dollar's worth, not rob me blind.  The cinematography was done by a two-year old.  Nothing spectacular, nothing worth writing about.Overall, this was a very poor film.  Would it have hurt anyone working on this project to use a little something I like to call ""imagination""?  Creativity was not being used or welcomed in this film.  You could tell that the director wanted to make the film, edit out what didn't work, finish, and relax at home while thinking of all the different ways that he could spend his Hollywood money!  I blame two major players in this film for the overall poor quality.  The first is Mr. Lawrence.  If he does not expand his acting potential and bring something new to the screen, I don't think his Hollywood stay will be very long.  The second player that I blame for this befuddling mess is the writer.  Again, creativity and imagination went backseat to the infamous Hollywood recycling bin.  This was a truly disappointing picture.Grade: * out of *****",1,That's why you shouldn't drink your own urine.,1105056000,"01 7, 2005",2005,4461,"['can', 'not', 'stress', 'fact', 'film', 'been', 'overplayed', 'recycled', 'Hollywood', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'claim', 'one', 'Lawrence', 'more', 'creative', 'roles', 'yet', 'can', 'only', 'laugh', 'gag', 'simultaneously', 'words', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'major', 'contributor', 'downfall', 'film', 'provided', 'character', 'analysis', 'development', 'definitely', 'humor', 'entire', 'story', 'was', 'were', 'watching', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'progress', 'final', 'script', 'arrived', 'Lawrence', 'funny', 'bits', 'quick', 'introduction', 'beginning', 'film', 'mere', '7', 'minutes', 'character', 'introduction', 'incoherent', 'ending', 'was', 'trying', 'monopolize', 'popularity', 'Gladiator', 'never', 'see', 'Lawrence', 'character', 'Jamal', 'Skywalker', 'depending', 'care', 'actors', 'emerge', 'film', 'was', 'merely', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'cashing', 'already', 'overplayed', 'self', 'stretching', 'further', 'comfortable', 'limits', 'never', 'exerting', 'anything', 'fresh', 'fallen', 'cracks', 'Hollywood', 'recycling', 'bin', 'Black', 'Knight', 'idea.Sadly', 'Lawrence', ""n't"", 'backed', 'up', 'better', 'acting', 'story', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'done', 'amazing', 'films', 'career', 'apparently', 'was', 'looking', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'film', 'required', 'real', 'acting', 'just', 'sloppy', 'drunkenness', 'cliched', 'moments', 'end', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'other', 'film', 'one', 'think', 'was', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'lackluster', 'Lawrence', 'was', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'felt', 'were', 'forced', 'beginning', 'different', 'places', 'events', 'just', 'fill', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'redeeming', 'value', 'story', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'whomever', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'may', 'have', 'gasp', 'plagiarized', 'nearly', 'other', 'film', 'one', 'there', 'structure', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'formula', 'literally', 'had', 'dust', 'nobody', 'seemed', 'care', 'Lawrence', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'performance', 'gave', 'expected', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Wilkinson', 'who', 'impressed', 'past', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'showcase', 'talent', 'anyone', 'talent', 'say', 'least', 'must', 'always', 'remember', 'story', ""n't"", 'sound', 'good', 'paper', ""n't"", 'going', 'translate', 'well', 'screen', 'rule', 'live', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Black', 'Knight', 'debacle.Finally', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'reviews', 'film', 'just', 'stood', 'out', 'more', 'other', 'have', 'seen', 'production', 'film', 'was', 'horrible', 'costumes', 'sets', 'even', 'way', 'shots', 'were', 'framed', 'seemed', 'cheap', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'costumes', 'are', 'first', 'come', 'mind', 'Lawrence', 'always', 'seemed', 'was', 'wearing', 'something', 'was', 'made', 'haste', 'How', 'could', 'have', 'quickly', 'made', 'garment', 'time', 'was', 'land', 'Who', 'was', 'cheap', 'only', 'lowered', 'film', 'further', 'muck', 'pit', 'story', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'full', 'potential', 'actually', 'doing', 'what', 'are', 'paid', 'be', 'creative', 'least', 'give', 'something', 'look', 'Production', 'Team', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'nothing', 'ravishing', 'even', 'glance', 'entire', 'Medieval', 'World', 'Lawrence', 'beginning', 'cheap', 'obviously', 'set', 'want', 'film', 'take', 'away', 'Hollywood', 'give', 'dollar', 'worth', 'not', 'rob', 'blind', 'cinematography', 'was', 'done', 'two-year', 'old', 'Nothing', 'spectacular', 'nothing', 'worth', 'writing', 'about.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'film', 'Would', 'have', 'hurt', 'anyone', 'working', 'project', 'use', 'little', 'something', 'like', 'call', 'imagination', 'Creativity', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'used', 'welcomed', 'film', 'could', 'tell', 'director', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'edit', 'out', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'finish', 'relax', 'home', 'thinking', 'different', 'ways', 'could', 'spend', 'Hollywood', 'money', 'blame', 'two', 'major', 'players', 'film', 'overall', 'poor', 'quality', 'first', 'Mr.', 'Lawrence', 'not', 'expand', 'acting', 'potential', 'bring', 'something', 'new', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Hollywood', 'stay', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'long', 'second', 'player', 'blame', 'befuddling', 'mess', 'writer', 'Again', 'creativity', 'imagination', 'went', 'backseat', 'infamous', 'Hollywood', 'recycling', 'bin', 'was', 'truly', 'disappointing', 'picture.Grade', '*', '*****']",Black Knight

Essentially, this is a low-grade millennium version of the 1931 Will Rogers satire ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court"", which itself was based on Mark Twain's novel. Will Roger's original film about a modern man who dreams he is transported to the middle ages was bad, but this is even WORSE! Bad acting, corny story, gross-out humor, ad nauseum. However, the scene with Martin teaching the medieval musicians to play Sly Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" is mildly amusing, as his outrageous speech to rally the peasants against the King (a wild mixture of Al Sharpton, Rodney King, and John F. Kennedy), and Marsha Thompson as his love interest is rather easy on the eyes. These latter factors give it 2 stars instead of 1.

588198,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,B00005JKLW,ChildInside,"[1, 3]","I was afraid of this movie. I was truly frightened out of my boots. You know why? Because of the premise. Imagine the premise of a modern day man in medieval times. How would that work? I already fear the possibility of a corny incident and I was not let down. You know how the main character got into medieval times? Through a magical necklace. Wow, huh?Yup, people, that is the beginning of the movie. The movie stars Martin Lawrence as a man named Jamal. He works at this place called ""Medieval World"" and they are about to receive competition in the form of ""CastleWorld"". Jamal doesn't really care and believes the boss should just cash out, but his boss doesn't feel the same. She is disappointed, but Jamal doesn't care. Later on, as he is cleaning, he saw a strange necklace in the moat and as he tried to get it, it sucked him in. That begins our magical adventure and it is quite possibly the corniest modern day beginning ever. That can fly with the Wizard of Oz because it is a classic and it was made long ago, but that plot doesn't fly today. As a matter of fact, I may have disgraced the name of ""The Wizard of Oz"" by mentioning it in the same sentence as Black Knight.Anyway, after being sucked in, our hero finds himself in medieval times. The movie wasted no time in teaching me that medieval citizens of England spoke modern English quite well by showing Jamal speaking with a citizen perfectly. The guy also ends up dying, but he then wakes up a moment later, and keep in mind that Jamal just finished making a whole scene about the guy not breathing. Later on, he travels around and finally arrives in a village. There, he sees as castle and believes it is the new amusement park, ""CastleWorld"". Jamal is quite perceptive, isn't he? If I had landed in a place where there is no city or road around, but only a bunch of people dressed in rags, I would guess it is an amusement park too. So after arriving at the castle and informing the guards that he is from Florence and Normandie (which they mistake for Normandy), he is let in. Thus Jamal's adventure begins and we will be introduced to medieval times at the highest possible accuracy, such as how politically correct people were in those times.Seriously, though, this movie simply has way too many flaws, even for a Martin Lawrence movie. I am watching this after Lawrence's other movie ""Nothing To Lose"" and I am finding that this movie is actually worse than the other. Unlike other comedies based in medieval times, this movie lacks comedy. Other movies do it by an almost extreme form of exaggeration, but this movie seems like it's aiming for some sort of moderate accuracy, which it fails in every way. If you had ever read a book based in medieval times by an accredited author, then be prepared to shake your head at this movie on every turn. You don't believe me? At many points in this movie, the seventh chambermaid of the king (Victoria) speaks in a way resembling a ""feminist"". Can you possibly imagine a feminist in that kind of setting? If you can, you're an idiot.Anyway, needless to say, one of the main problem of a movie like this is inaccuracy. With the feminist scene mentioned above, one of the girls with Victoria asked if she is infected with the plague (i.e. bubonic plague), but the plague did not appear in Europe until 1347, yet Victoria will say later on that the date is 1328. Now you're probably thinking that I'm too nitpicky, but it happens ALL the time in this movie. Hell, you don't even need to know about the medieval age to tell when something inaccurate pops up. It also doesn't help when Martin Lawrence flashes his ass at me in some kind of strange position in preparation for sex. I can tolerate Tom Hanks' ass, I can tolerate Keanu Revees' ass (if you watched the Matrix, you probably tolerated it too), and I can tolerate Leo DiCaprio's ass, but I would rather be pleased NOT to see Lawrence's ass.Returning back to the several anachronisms, Jamal also somehow managed to get new modern clothing (I'm not sure how) and he also attempted to introduced a fast food center. The problem with this is that there are no machinations designed to make fast food in the medieval period, so how did his design work internally? Didn't Jamal go to a place called school? Why in the blue hell did he think he could introduce a fast food place there?Moving away from this kind of problems, we come to a new set of problems. What is wrong is that the laughs come rarely, if ever at all. For me, it came sometimes, but not often enough for my taste. What is wrong is that the movie tries to play off situational comedy and it fails miserably. The situational comedy consists of the usual, people being kicked around, Jamal introducing modern culture to the king, him also making a complete ass of himself, etc etc. One of these situations includes him trying to pass himself off as a sorcerer by showing everyone fire through a lighter. For some reason, Jamal thought fire wasn't around despite him being in rooms where there were fireplaces and, for some reason, no one seemed to think it was strange that Jamal was using a modern day lighter. Right after this, they show a scene where the executioner is choking on an apple. Apparently, no one ever saw another person choking before because they all thought Jamal casted a spell on him. Yeah, ha ha.Anyway, it seems like this movie tries to play too much off the situational comedy and it lacks intelligent comedy. As much as I like laughing at the stupidity of some guy, I would prefer it if all the comedy was based solely on his stupidity because it's simply too unrealistic. When you're not asking yourself ""what"", ""how"", or ""why"", you'll find yourself hoping for something to make you laugh. When that something does appear (if it does at all), then you'll find yourself treasuring it as if it was your last.",3,Even Lawrence couldn't save this movie and he's a comedian,1105142400,"01 8,

However, on a flight between Los Angeles and Cleveland, I watched it for some mindless entertainment. The plot is utterly predictable and there are no surprises. Then, the question becomes ""why rate it four stars?"" Well, as mindless and predictable as it is, the situations and Martin Lewis' performance are downright entertaining. The supporting actors are well cast and very entertaining too.Lewis plays a character who accidentally travels back in time to medieval England. Predictably enough, at first he does not realize what has happened, thinking instead that he is at a theme park. Just as predictably, in his confusion, his antics work to his advantage as the king and his court think he is a messenger from Normandy (there is a Normandie Ave. in LA and on my way to the airport I passed the exit on the freeway). Of course, he was referring to the LA Avenue and the others thought that .. well, you know! Of course, everyone thinks that his ...typical African American mannerisms and lingo are French characteristics that are peculiar to this visitor from Normandy. Predictably enough, a romantic interest develops and he becomes a knight in a good guys vs bad guys situation.

He's surrounded by cheap sets, amateur costumes, plastic swords, and historic people who act like they're in a medieval high school play.  Sky Walker (clever, FOX) spends most of his time playing stand-up, making the usual Ebonic linguistics which are completely foreign to the babbled crowd of the early era, even making references to people they wouldn't know until long after they're dead.  Sky Walker attempt to destroy the fabrics of history by making a stupid dance sequence, which is choreography by no-longer-""American Idol""-judge Paula Abdul, establish a fast food service, and teach people boxing.  Finally, the lead meets the inevitable (anachronistic) Nubian love interest, whom he'll meet her present-day self once the film's over; jeez, I haven't seen that twist since ""Susie Q"".And yet after all that, I don't have the burning hatred within me to crush it.

You'll know how it ends before the movie's over. Martin Lawrence gives an okay, but largely forgettable performance as a &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; character in a strange land, but the material is what suffers in this film unfortunately. The characters seem to just be going through the motions and Martin looks as though he's just doing it for the paycheck.Feature aside, the DVD is chock-full of special features and tons of extras. It actually makes the movie better than it is. You can tell the director really wanted to give fans of the film more bang for their buck. The DVD has wonderful color, sharp visuals, crisp resolution and dynamic dobly digital sound. The special features are great. You get two featurettes, behind the scenes commentary from Martin Lawrence and the director himself. Plus, you get to hear testimonials from Martin and the cast about each other.  The deleted scenes also give you more insight into the characters and their roles in the film. The outtakes are more funny than the actual main feature.Overall, I'd recommend purchasing Black Knight only if you're a fan of the movie. Fans of Martin Lawrence that are expecting the rib-tickling comedy of his Def Comedy Jam days should be foreworned, this isn't Martin at his peak. Check out Runteldat if you're in the mood for the Martin we love.

Martin Lawrence plays an assertive theme park worker with no pride or dedication toward his job, lots of self-respect but little to share in favor of others. With the advertising of a competitive park opening close by in the future, he advises the park owner who also happens to be his mentor, to divest herself of the park and retire. Annoyed, she sends him to clean the moat and he's on his way while telling his coworkers to file their job applications at the new theme park to beat the rush. Dredging the moat, he spies a gold medallion on a heavy gold chain sparkling through the debris-strewn water. He sticks his hand in to retrieve it and gets sucked into the filthy water and time travels back to the 14th century.So begins Lawrence's journey into medieval England. Foisting himself off as the messenger from Normandy bringing news of the arrival of the Duke to wed the virgin daughter of the mean, usurping King Leo, he falls for one of the chambermaids (Marsha Thomason), who happens to be leading the rebellion against the king to reinstall the ousted queen. The supporting cast makes this movie -- from the drunken, fallen knight, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson) to Princess Regina (Jeannette Wegger), King Leo's not so virginal daughter.Some critics have poopahed Lawrence's acting abilities, but when I watch him interviewed in person and then watch his movies, I can only draw the conclusion that his acting abilities are top notch. One would almost think that the offscreen Lawrence is his major acting role, compared to the ones he portrays. Offscreen he appears intellectual, quiet mannered, almost shy.

Throwing a Nike-wearing urbanite into medieval times might sound a bit out of place, but you do get some fun scenes. Unfortunately if it's not done the right way and the scenes that are supposed to be funny get tiresome. That is what this movie suffers from more than anything else.Okay. You can't really expect much from a time traveling movie with Martin Lawrence in it. A Martin Lawrence comedy, no matter what genre they make it, is going to be pretty much the same. Black Knight does have some good qualities to it, but they get drowned out by... well... Martin Lawrence doing what he does in just about every comedy he's made. In other words it's funny the first few times, but how many times can you see this guy freak out over some predicament? It gets old really fast. The worst part about it is the other parts of the movie actually get interesting and you can see a lot of potential here, but then Martin starts up with his usual shtick and ruins the moment. Martin really needed to branch this character out more.As far as making everything look and feel like a real 13th century kingdom they did a pretty decent job of it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it rivals the authenticity of movies like Dragonslayer or Lord of the Rings, but I would call it a good shot for a movie with a modest budget. That is until you start getting the music in. These people need to do their research on those long trumpets because they certainly didn't sound right. Also there is a scene where Martin Lawrence gets the local minstrels to play some Motown which ended up being not only unbelievable but just plain silly (and not in a good way). Yeah I know... Martin Lawrence and all that.To be fair the plot and back-stories were solid. There were a couple of bumps here and there, but good enough nonetheless. I really did like how the whole movie came together in the end. You also get some good performances from Kevin Conway and Vincent Regan. Marsha Thomason does surprisingly well in spite of looking out of place in medieval England. Her performance definitely makes up for that. Martin is Martin so I can't say he really made a stretch in his performance.Black Knight is mostly just for people who like the comedy style of Martin Lawrence. If his style gets on your nerves then you might want to shy away from this one. Still it's an okay movie if you can get past Lawrence's annoying recurring fish-out-of-water theme.

588237,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKLW,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Just a passable comedy from Martin Lawrence, ""Black Knight"" follows the (mis)adventure of Jamal, a worker at a medieval amusement park.  Cleaning up the water around the ""castle"" of the park, he finds a shining medal.  He reaches for it, but is  sucked into the water, to eventually find himself in the real medieval castle in the 14th century England, where he is treated as a messanger from Normandy.  To fend off the danger coming to him, he has to keep on his disguise, no matter what happens during the course.The premise is interesting, and I agree that ""Black Knight"" is not as bad as you might think.  However, the fact is, Martin Lawrence did better films like ""Bad Boys"" ""Nothing to Lose,"" and ""Blue Streak,"" all of which I enjoyed.  And all of them have able players as his sidekicks --Will, Tim, and Luke, respectively -- but in ""Black Knight"" he chose to go alone almost through the whole movie though Tom Wilkinson (""Full Monty"") gives a few precious help (but rather in a too serious mood) as a drunken knight.As a result, the camera, intentionally or not, shows constantly Lawrence's mugging; in itself it is all right, especially when he has a partner by his side, but in this case I soon found that he does it too much.  I can understand how his fans love what he does; but it is hardly possible for the film to convert anyone who sees him for the first time, to one of them; ""Blue Streak"" and ""Big Mama's House"" would have a better chance.Sometimes the film is really funny, and it is when Jamal teaches the musicians at the court how to play the funky music of Sly and the Family Stone's number, ""Dance to the Music.""

I thought the movie was funny, and there was a good balance of spirit, goofiness, and some political satire.The premise that an English king can mistake Lawrence for a Moorish messenger from Normandy is hilarious in and of itself. From then on the laughs continue. Martin Lawrence is constantly in movement: he runs, he dances, he fights, he falls down, he accidentally ends up in bed with a king's daughter. All of this adds up to a nice fast-paced comedy.The movie is very entertaining. Neither the main hero, nor the main villain can be taken completely seriously, and that what makes it a light, hilarious adventure, which is nevertheless not devoid of a moral lesson.Some of my favorite scenes involve Lawrence losing a chess game in two half-moves and Lawrence explaining how to French kiss.I recommend this film.",5,Lawrence Does It Just Right,1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,1112,"['only', 'reservation', 'had', 'initially', 'was', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'acting', 'top', 'hard', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'loose', 'upbeat', 'comic', 'plain', 'control', 'insanity', 'quickly', 'dissipated', 'watched', 'movie.Lawrence', 'did', 'just', 'right', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'thoroughly', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'there', 'was', 'good', 'balance', 'spirit', 'goofiness', 'political', 'satire.The', 'premise', 'English', 'king', 'can', 'mistake', 'Lawrence', 'Moorish', 'messenger', 'Normandy', 'hilarious', 'then', 'laughs', 'continue', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'constantly', 'movement', 'down', 'accidentally', 'up', 'bed', 'king', 'daughter', 'up', 'nice', 'fast-paced', 'comedy.The', 'movie', 'very', 'entertaining', 'main', 'hero', 'main', 'villain', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'completely', 'seriously', 'what', 'light', 'hilarious', 'adventure', 'nevertheless', 'not', 'devoid', 'moral', 'lesson.Some', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'involve', 'Lawrence', 'losing', 'chess', 'game', 'two', 'half-moves', 'Lawrence', 'explaining', 'how', 'French', 'kiss.I', 'recommend', 'film']",Black Knight
