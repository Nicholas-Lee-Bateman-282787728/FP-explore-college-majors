I've seen other filmmakers take this concept to better results. It's not a waste of time, but its nothing to get that excited about either. I thought the performances were just so-so.",2,"Interesting but confusing, flawed and overrated.",1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,340,"['film', 'lot', 'more', 'mistake', 'blending', 'too', 'many', 'genres', 'up', 'confusing', 'often', 'pointless', 'narrative', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'concept', 'better', 'results', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'just', 'so-so']",Jake's Closet
1174834,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001C4ZQ70,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","It's ironic that you're most likely to find Jake's Closet as part of some horror movie package because, despite the zombie presence, this really isn't a horror movie.  It's more of a psychological drama - and a darn good one, too.  The most interesting - and certainly most impressive - thing about the film is that it actually succeeds at presenting the whole story through the eyes of a child.  Virtually every one of us was afraid of ""the monster in the closet"" at some point in our childhoods, and that shared memory establishes a strong link between us and six-year-old Jake.  Thanks to an impressive and really believable performance from young Anthony De Marco, the film does possess the capacity to take you inside the mind of this little boy.We all wish that kids could enjoy the most idyllic and happy of childhoods, but that just doesn't happen.  Like far too many children, Jake is having to deal with the impending divorce of his parents.  Things are certainly a lot quieter around the house after his father leaves, but his mother is increasingly wrapped up in the emotions of the break-up.  As an only child, Jake doesn't really have any children his own age to play with, so he doesn't have an escape from his newly unsettled home life.  He's a confused and sad little boy, really.  As if all that weren't bad enough, a zombie has just moved into his closet.  No one, least of all his parents, believe him, of course, but there's no doubt that the zombie is there - he has heard it and he has seen it, and it is definitely a zombie.  Naturally, the danger the zombie poses to him and his mother scares the heck out of him, but the time will come when he will have confront his fears - alone.This is a surprisingly poignant and touching story.  While his parents obviously love Jake and explain to him that he is not to blame for their problems, they do end up neglecting him to some degree as the emotions of the divorce intensify.  Jake's mother's friend is constantly egging her on to get all of the revenge she can on her husband, which leads to false accusations and a restraining order, and the husband's insensitivity to his wife's feelings only makes things worse.  Then Jake has to deal with a new man in his mother's life, nights spent alone with a grumpy old lush of a babysitter, etc.  It's a lot for a little kid to deal with, especially one who is constantly terrified of being eaten by the zombie in his closet.Jake's Closet isn't a film that will frighten you, but it builds up a lot of suspense in terms of how Jake is ever going to be able to confront the zombie.  The ending isn't as clear-cut as many would like it to be, but it does make perfect sense when viewed in context with everything going on in Jake's life.  In a sense, this is the one zombie movie that is perfect for an audience of both children and adults.  Children will certainly have no trouble accepting things as Jake sees them, while adults can actually learn a lot about the way children deal with traumatic emotional events they cannot truly understand on an intellectual level.",5,A surprisingly poignant window into the very real traumas of childhood,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3084,"['ironic', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'Jake', 'Closet', 'part', 'horror', 'movie', 'package', 'zombie', 'presence', 'really', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'drama', 'darn', 'good', 'one', 'too', 'most', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'actually', 'presenting', 'whole', 'story', 'eyes', 'child', 'Virtually', 'one', 'was', 'afraid', 'monster', 'closet', 'point', 'childhoods', 'shared', 'memory', 'establishes', 'strong', 'link', 'six-year-old', 'Jake', 'Thanks', 'impressive', 'really', 'believable', 'performance', 'young', 'Anthony', 'De', 'Marco', 'film', 'possess', 'capacity', 'take', 'mind', 'little', 'boy.We', 'wish', 'kids', 'could', 'enjoy', 'most', 'idyllic', 'happy', 'childhoods', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'Jake', 'having', 'deal', 'impending', 'divorce', 'parents', 'Things', 'are', 'certainly', 'lot', 'quieter', 'house', 'father', 'mother', 'increasingly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'emotions', 'break-up', 'only', 'child', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'children', 'own', 'age', 'play', ""n't"", 'have', 'escape', 'newly', 'unsettled', 'home', 'life', 'confused', 'sad', 'little', 'boy', 'really', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'zombie', 'just', 'moved', 'closet', 'one', 'least', 'parents', 'believe', 'course', 'doubt', 'zombie', 'there', 'heard', 'seen', 'definitely', 'zombie', 'Naturally', 'danger', 'zombie', 'mother', 'heck', 'time', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'will', 'have', 'confront', 'fears', 'alone.This', 'surprisingly', 'poignant', 'touching', 'story', 'parents', 'obviously', 'love', 'Jake', 'explain', 'not', 'blame', 'problems', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'neglecting', 'degree', 'emotions', 'divorce', 'intensify', 'Jake', 'mother', 'friend', 'constantly', 'egging', 'get', 'revenge', 'can', 'husband', 'false', 'accusations', 'restraining', 'order', 'husband', 'insensitivity', 'wife', 'feelings', 'only', 'things', 'worse', 'Then', 'Jake', 'deal', 'new', 'man', 'mother', 'life', 'nights', 'spent', 'alone', 'grumpy', 'old', 'lush', 'babysitter', 'etc', 'lot', 'little', 'kid', 'deal', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'constantly', 'terrified', 'being', 'eaten', 'zombie', 'closet.Jake', 'Closet', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'frighten', 'up', 'lot', 'suspense', 'terms', 'how', 'Jake', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'confront', 'zombie', 'ending', ""n't"", 'as', 'clear-cut', 'many', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'when', 'viewed', 'context', 'everything', 'going', 'Jake', 'life', 'sense', 'one', 'zombie', 'movie', 'perfect', 'audience', 'children', 'adults', 'Children', 'will', 'certainly', 'have', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'things', 'Jake', 'adults', 'can', 'actually', 'learn', 'lot', 'way', 'children', 'deal', 'traumatic', 'emotional', 'events', 'can', 'not', 'truly', 'understand', 'intellectual', 'level']",Jake's Closet
1174835,A2Z4SKU0SY6C5W,B001C4ZQ70,"Hot Pie! ""Ivory""","[0, 2]","This movie was interesting, but not really my cup of tea. For what it was, ""Jakes Closet"" was pretty good. The story focuses on Jake and the dread he feels towards his parents' impending divorce. Not your typical Lifetime movie as the men and women seem to share the blame for the various problems in their relationships. The men seem to be at least sane, while the female characters in this film appear to be cracked or cracking under the emotional strains of their failed lives/relationships. SPOILER--- The mother's friend/neighbor slaps Jake when he asks a simple question, then later insults him and his mother. His mother falsely accuses father on several occasions. The father only loses his cool when he confronts the man sleeping with his wife. That guy promptly exits when he finds out she's married. This isn't typical formula of a family drama film. Usually, it's all the guy's fault because he either cheated, abused wife and/or kid, or gambled away their money. Bottom line for me is that Jake's Closet is a good film. I would have liked it better if Jake would have been put into real danger. Say if near the end of the film, parents are arguing, Jake is menaced by zombie and injures himself which causes he and his parents to focus on the real cause of his distress...Maybe, I dunno. By the way I believe the guy who plays Jakes father was also in HBO's Deadwood.",3,"Not what I expected,",1270598400,"04 7, 2010",2010,1380,"['movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'what', 'was', 'Jakes', 'Closet', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'Jake', 'dread', 'parents', 'impending', 'divorce', 'Not', 'typical', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'men', 'women', 'seem', 'share', 'blame', 'various', 'problems', 'relationships', 'men', 'seem', 'be', 'least', 'sane', 'female', 'characters', 'film', 'appear', 'be', 'cracked', 'cracking', 'emotional', 'strains', 'failed', 'lives/relationships', 'SPOILER', 'mother', 'friend/neighbor', 'slaps', 'Jake', 'when', 'simple', 'question', 'then', 'later', 'insults', 'mother', 'mother', 'falsely', 'father', 'several', 'occasions', 'father', 'only', 'cool', 'when', 'man', 'sleeping', 'wife', 'guy', 'promptly', 'when', 'out', 'married', ""n't"", 'typical', 'formula', 'family', 'drama', 'film', 'Usually', 'guy', 'fault', 'either', 'cheated', 'abused', 'wife', 'and/or', 'kid', 'gambled', 'away', 'money', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Jake', 'Closet', 'good', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'Jake', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'real', 'danger', 'Say', 'end', 'film', 'parents', 'are', 'arguing', 'Jake', 'menaced', 'zombie', 'injures', 'parents', 'focus', 'real', 'cause', 'distress', 'Maybe', 'dunno', 'way', 'believe', 'guy', 'who', 'Jakes', 'father', 'was', 'also', 'HBO', 'Deadwood']",Jake's Closet
1174836,AXAKSCEND6AP4,B001C4ZQ70,Kindle Customer,"[0, 0]",This is a great movie about parental alienation. It was very sad that the mother intentionally alienated her son from his father. Many  parents are like this. Parental Alienation is emotional abuse and people should be aware of it and of the effects of  this alienation on the children who are taught to be alienated from their parents.,5,Great Movie about Parental Alienation,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,336,"['great', 'movie', 'parental', 'alienation', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'mother', 'intentionally', 'alienated', 'son', 'father', 'Many', 'parents', 'are', 'Parental', 'Alienation', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'effects', 'alienation', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'taught', 'be', 'alienated', 'parents']",Jake's Closet
1174837,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B001C4ZQ70,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[19, 23]","I was pleasantly surprised by this little indie. They managed to mix together a younger coming-of-age film with a zombie plot, all created by the disaster a divorce can play on a child.Anthony De Marco has an outstanding first film here, and I have to admit that I haven't seen a performance this believable in a kid since the Costner film Perfect World (quite a few similarities between those two kids). The story revolves around an only child dealing with a nasty divorce, a snotty little neighbor kid and his mom, and his imagination about a zombie being in the house. I had already heard about the opening title sequence (a mixture of MIB, Pan's Labyrinth and Beetlejuice) which was nice to see in an indie for a tone set. Overall, a solid performance and story as the majority of the camera angles are at a kid level - this is not a film about or for adults. But I am sure a large number of nasty divorce adults could watch this and learn something. I have read arguments about the ambiguous ending being a detractor, but I actually liked it as there is really no end to what a divorce does to everyone.The special features were appropriate and worthwhile. Several of the extras include clips for adults and children on dealing with divorce. Some deleted scenes, one that should have absolutely been left in is the zombie dance/dream sequence (I feel any dream sequences should not be cut from a film - especially one as good as this). Also a nice 20 minute docu on the making of the film with some uncomfortable talking head parts but some nice non-narrated info segments.The film quality looked good and I was impressed with how they made the zombie part believable and relevant to the kids plight. For the obvious parental questions about content; there are adult themes with regards to arguments, an already dead rabbit sequence that the kids find, zombie innuendo (what might be happening to people/critters off screen) and maybe some frightening zombie chasing - but there is no blood, no graphic anything, no sexual innuendo - nada. Just a good film for a kid or for adults wanting to see what it might be like to go through this unfortunate and painful situation.",4,An excellent beginning for this young actor...,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",2008,2176,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'little', 'indie', 'managed', 'mix', 'together', 'younger', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'zombie', 'plot', 'created', 'disaster', 'divorce', 'can', 'play', 'child.Anthony', 'De', 'Marco', 'outstanding', 'first', 'film', 'here', 'have', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'performance', 'believable', 'kid', 'Costner', 'film', 'Perfect', 'World', 'quite', 'few', 'similarities', 'two', 'kids', 'story', 'only', 'child', 'dealing', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'snotty', 'little', 'neighbor', 'kid', 'mom', 'imagination', 'zombie', 'being', 'house', 'had', 'already', 'heard', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'mixture', 'MIB', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Beetlejuice', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'indie', 'tone', 'set', 'Overall', 'solid', 'performance', 'story', 'majority', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'kid', 'level', 'not', 'film', 'adults', 'am', 'sure', 'large', 'number', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'adults', 'could', 'watch', 'learn', 'something', 'have', 'read', 'arguments', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'being', 'detractor', 'actually', 'liked', 'really', 'end', 'what', 'divorce', 'everyone.The', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'appropriate', 'worthwhile', 'Several', 'extras', 'include', 'clips', 'adults', 'children', 'dealing', 'divorce', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'absolutely', 'been', 'left', 'zombie', 'dance/dream', 'sequence', 'feel', 'dream', 'sequences', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'cut', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'Also', 'nice', '20', 'minute', 'docu', 'making', 'film', 'uncomfortable', 'talking', 'head', 'parts', 'nice', 'non-narrated', 'info', 'segments.The', 'film', 'quality', 'looked', 'good', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'made', 'zombie', 'part', 'believable', 'relevant', 'kids', 'plight', 'obvious', 'parental', 'questions', 'content', 'are', 'adult', 'themes', 'regards', 'arguments', 'already', 'dead', 'rabbit', 'sequence', 'kids', 'find', 'zombie', 'innuendo', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'happening', 'people/critters', 'screen', 'maybe', 'frightening', 'zombie', 'chasing', 'blood', 'graphic', 'anything', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'nada', 'Just', 'good', 'film', 'kid', 'adults', 'wanting', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'go', 'unfortunate', 'painful', 'situation']",Jake's Closet

It is a very intelligent and original homage to the films of George Romero whose zombies represent tensions within individuals and society at large. The clip from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and the reference to ""Mrs. Romero"" should have alerted most viewers. The writer/director dserves to be congratulated since she has taken the work of an illustrious predecessor and not merely copied it but reworked its premises into her own type of film.
