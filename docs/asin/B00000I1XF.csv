But my three year old son (who normally likes Elmo and who normally like Halloween) is scared to watch it.  He doesn't want me to play it--he asks for Dora's Halloween instead.This DVD--compared to other Elmo DVD's--is a tad on the dark side, with a Haunted House and spooky sounds.  So while it is of course tame for us grown-ups, you may want to be careful if you think your child might be frightened.I hope this helps you make your decision!",3,My three year old son thinks it is too scary,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,477,"['Well', 'cute', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'normally', 'Elmo', 'who', 'normally', 'Halloween', 'scared', 'watch', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'Dora', 'Halloween', 'instead.This', 'DVD', 'compared', 'other', 'Elmo', 'DVD', 'tad', 'dark', 'side', 'Haunted', 'House', 'spooky', 'sounds', 'So', 'course', 'tame', 'grown-ups', 'may', 'want', 'be', 'careful', 'think', 'child', 'might', 'be', 'frightened.I', 'hope', 'make', 'decision']",Sesame Street - Elmo Says Boo VHS

502022,AOG85D9VOHB07,B00000I1XF,Michele S. Hays,"[14, 14]","Many of the newer Sesame Street videos, particularly if they feature the ""little red menace"" are watered-down and icky sweet.  This one actually scared my toddler a little bit at the beginning - but engaged him enough to keep him watching until he wasn't scared any more - EXACTLY what you want it to do!Toddlers have lots of fears - especially around halloween - and this video is a good way to show them that being scared can be fun!  It's filled with knock-knock jokes, bad puns, and spooky talking skeletons, ghosts, and more fun props.  I love that they didn't get rid of the thunder, lightning, or any other ""scary"" stuff in the Count's castle.  There's also a lot of muppet-kid interaction where everyone gets silly.I highly recommend this video to anyone who's got a shy toddler!",4,I was expecting to hate this - but I think it's terrific!,1045267200,"02 15, 2003",2003,787,"['Many', 'newer', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'videos', 'particularly', 'feature', 'little', 'red', 'menace', 'are', 'watered-down', 'icky', 'sweet', 'one', 'actually', 'scared', 'toddler', 'little', 'bit', 'beginning', 'engaged', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'more', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'Toddlers', 'have', 'lots', 'fears', 'especially', 'halloween', 'video', 'good', 'way', 'show', 'being', 'scared', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'filled', 'knock-knock', 'jokes', 'bad', 'puns', 'spooky', 'talking', 'skeletons', 'ghosts', 'more', 'fun', 'props', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'thunder', 'lightning', 'other', 'scary', 'stuff', 'Count', 'castle', 'also', 'lot', 'muppet-kid', 'interaction', 'where', 'everyone', 'silly.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'who', 'got', 'shy', 'toddler']",Sesame Street - Elmo Says Boo VHS
502023,AJ09ITQVXNXRL,B00000I1XF,Michelle,"[3, 3]","My 2 yr old loves this video.  Although I don't find it scary (neither does she), I probably wouldn't show it to a child under 1.  I don't think they would get the idea of the video.  It's not meant to scare but to make light of irrational fears.The songs are extremely catchy, my daughter and I find ourselves singing them all the time-&quot;Transylvania 1-2-3&quot;.
