575182,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000059XTI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Funny, charming and comforting in all the right places, `Postcards from the Edge' is nearly perfect thanks to some sharp dialog, marvelous chemistry and a relaxed internal flow. While the film certainly forces the ending (ugh, I hate it when good films tack cheap endings on in lazy attempts at resolving all problems before the credits role) it makes a real go at getting there, and so much good is found in every nook and cranny up to that horrendously clich&eacute; closing.Kiss, kiss...thanks; all better now.The film, adapted from Carrie Fisher's semi-autobiographical yet wholly fictional novel, tells the story of mother/daughter stars Suzanne Vale and Doris Mann. Suzanne is the pill popping daughter, grade-A actress who is burning bridges and ruining her reputation because of her drug abuse. Doris is the alcoholic mother who feeds off of her former success by meddling with her daughter's life in a way that drives them both into their vices. They don't mix well, yet they undeniably love one another with whole hearts. The film opens with Suzanne being rushed to the hospital by a one-night stand after downing too many pills. She has her stomach pumped and is rushed to rehab. Upon release she is given a role in a B-Grade flick and is only allowed to work if she stays with her mother who can monitor her and make sure she doesn't start using again; despite the fact that her mother most certainly pushes her closer towards drugs than possibly any other human being. Through the course of the film shoot we see Suzanne and her mother interact in odd yet surprisingly human ways and we see their relationship flesh out to reveal the reasons (or excuses) for their destructive behavior.And then it throws a happy ending on it and calls it a day.I love the entire cast as well as the director (what could be more exciting than Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep starring in a Mike Nichols film together!?!??!?!) and so I really wanted to LOVE this film. I didn't, but I really, really liked it. It felt a little too light for what it could have been, a tad too uneven or unfocused. It had the potential to layer things better, but instead it went for a more convention way to tell the story, which worked from an entertainment level (it is fun and engaging in all the ways that Hollywood clich&eacute;s have been proven to be) and yet it suffers on a more honest and artistic level (it could have GONE THERE but it doesn't even try). In fact, even when it is trying to flesh out these two women it stops short of saying anything truly alarming or provoking but beats around the bush with more accessible detailing.But like I said, it has sharp dialog, marvelous chemistry and a relaxed internal flow; all of which makes for an entertaining ride.The playbill reads like a who's-who of Hollywood giants, with Streep and MacLaine leading a cast that consists of Dennis Quaid, Annette Bening, Richard Dreyfuss, Rob Reiner, Mary Wickes and Gene Hackman; all of which making the most of their borderline cameo performances. Hackman is especially marvelous, opening and closing the film with dynamic effect and delivering possibly the most memorable performance in the whole film (the two shades he brings to the opening sequence is unforgettable).I think many people will like this film a lot, and like I said; I really did too. I just wish it were a little more grounded and focused on relaying a more honest depiction of fragmented relationships and substance abuse instead of falling back on cinematic clich&eacute;s and humor.",3,Uneven tones are semi-repaired by fantastic performances...,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,3535,"['Funny', 'charming', 'comforting', 'right', 'places', 'Postcards', 'Edge', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'thanks', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'marvelous', 'chemistry', 'relaxed', 'internal', 'flow', 'film', 'certainly', 'ending', 'hate', 'when', 'good', 'films', 'tack', 'cheap', 'endings', 'lazy', 'attempts', 'resolving', 'problems', 'credits', 'role', 'real', 'go', 'getting', 'there', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'found', 'nook', 'cranny', 'up', 'horrendously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'closing.Kiss', 'kiss', 'thanks', 'better', 'now.The', 'film', 'adapted', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'semi-autobiographical', 'yet', 'wholly', 'fictional', 'novel', 'story', 'mother/daughter', 'stars', 'Suzanne', 'Vale', 'Doris', 'Mann', 'Suzanne', 'pill', 'popping', 'daughter', 'grade-A', 'actress', 'who', 'burning', 'bridges', 'ruining', 'reputation', 'drug', 'abuse', 'Doris', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'who', 'former', 'success', 'meddling', 'daughter', 'life', 'way', 'vices', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'well', 'yet', 'undeniably', 'love', 'one', 'whole', 'hearts', 'film', 'Suzanne', 'being', 'rushed', 'hospital', 'one-night', 'stand', 'downing', 'too', 'many', 'pills', 'stomach', 'pumped', 'rushed', 'rehab', 'release', 'given', 'role', 'B-Grade', 'flick', 'only', 'allowed', 'work', 'mother', 'who', 'can', 'monitor', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'start', 'using', 'again', 'fact', 'mother', 'most', 'certainly', 'closer', 'towards', 'drugs', 'possibly', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'course', 'film', 'shoot', 'see', 'Suzanne', 'mother', 'interact', 'odd', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'human', 'ways', 'see', 'relationship', 'out', 'reveal', 'reasons', 'destructive', 'behavior.And', 'then', 'happy', 'ending', 'day.I', 'love', 'entire', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'exciting', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'starring', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'film', 'together', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'LOVE', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'light', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tad', 'too', 'uneven', 'unfocused', 'had', 'potential', 'layer', 'things', 'better', 'instead', 'went', 'more', 'convention', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'worked', 'entertainment', 'level', 'fun', 'engaging', 'ways', 'Hollywood', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'have', 'been', 'proven', 'be', 'yet', 'more', 'honest', 'artistic', 'level', 'could', 'have', 'GONE', 'THERE', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'fact', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'flesh', 'out', 'two', 'women', 'short', 'saying', 'anything', 'truly', 'alarming', 'provoking', 'beats', 'bush', 'more', 'accessible', 'detailing.But', 'said', 'sharp', 'dialog', 'marvelous', 'chemistry', 'relaxed', 'internal', 'flow', 'entertaining', 'ride.The', 'playbill', ""who's-who"", 'Hollywood', 'giants', 'Streep', 'MacLaine', 'leading', 'cast', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Mary', 'Wickes', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'making', 'most', 'borderline', 'cameo', 'performances', 'Hackman', 'especially', 'marvelous', 'opening', 'closing', 'film', 'dynamic', 'effect', 'delivering', 'possibly', 'most', 'memorable', 'performance', 'whole', 'film', 'two', 'shades', 'opening', 'sequence', 'unforgettable', '.I', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'lot', 'said', 'really', 'did', 'too', 'just', 'wish', 'were', 'little', 'more', 'grounded', 'focused', 'relaying', 'more', 'honest', 'depiction', 'fragmented', 'relationships', 'substance', 'abuse', 'instead', 'falling', 'back', 'cinematic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'humor']",N/A
575183,A5EKUC02QJKWE,B000059XTI,"A. Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[0, 0]","Postcards from the Edge is not a sappy, been-there-done-that comedy. It's actually a movie with a lot of heart and spirit that just happens to be funny. This movie's been classified as an overall comedy, but I felt it dwindled between two genres: comedy and drama. It follows the protagonist--played by Meryl Streep--, a rising actress who is gifted at her craft, but has one thing that is stopping her from reaching her full potential: her drug addiction. The film, surprisingly, does not give us much to work with as a result of her addiction. We do not see a lot of Meryl Streep scarfing down pills and getting high; that all happens within the first ten-to-fifteen minutes of the movie. Instead we see the story of a woman who is attempting to overcome this obstacle and regain her humanity in the process. There are many great scenes shared between Meryl Streep and Shirley Maclaine in this movie. They have incredible chemistry as mother and daughter and, better yet, they give no cringe-worthy performances in this movie. Every line is inflected with the proper tone required for the character and for the story to be effective. I suggest, if you're not a hardcore drama fan, to see this movie plainly for the performances, because they are all great. For those who like a drama sprinkled with some witty dialogue, this is your movie. The merging of the dramatic elements as well as the humorous ones are almost flawless, which makes this movie a true classic for any movie lover.

575191,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000059XTI,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Carrie Fisher's bracingly candid and acerbically amusing commentary is definitely worth a listen when you watch this scabrous 1990 comedy, especially since she wrote the screenplay based onher first novel, which is turn, was based on her life as a drug-addicted movie actress who happens to be the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. With the self-assured Mike Nichols at the helm, the picture is glossy and often smug in its insider's look of Hollywood, but it also has an emotionally resonant quality thanks mainly to the shrewdly observant interplay between Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine as mother and daughter. Streep plays Suzanne Vale, an actress successful enough to star in a cheesy action flick but spiraling out of control with her drug habit. In fact, she barely finishes a film for veteran director Lowell Korshack (an initially snappish Gene Hackman) who reads her the riot act on the set about her budget-escalating addiction.In the midst of a bleary-eyed one-night-stand, Suzanne becomes comatose from an overdose and is taken to the hospital where she gets her stomach pumped by a smitten doctor (a puppyish Richard Dreyfuss). She recovers and can work on her next picture only if she will live with her movie star mother Doris Mann to appease the insurance company. While the rest of the movie focuses on Suzanne's bumpy road toward recovery, the story really takes flight when it zeroes in on the prickly, dysfunctional relationship she has with Doris, a larger-than-life personality who means well as a mother but can't help being judgmental and competitive. Whether showing off her gams on a piano belting out Sondheim's ""I'm Still Here"" or revealing her pathetically shorn head after an auto collision, MacLaine is spot-on in the role, probably the best among her latter-day performances after Aurora Greenway inTerms of Endearment.Liberated from her parade of accents and period costumes, Streep seems at first too accomplished to be playing a second-rate actress, but she makes the bedraggled Suzanne likeably flawed. She also shows off an impressive singing voice with a couple of country-western numbers. Beyond Hackman and Dreyfuss, Dennis Quaid effectively plays an errant lover with smarmy panache, and there are nice near-cameos from Annette Bening as a flaky actress, Gary Morton as Suzanne's agent, Robin Bartlett as Suzanne's sardonic rehab roommate, CCH Pounder as an unctuous rehab counselor and Simon Callow as a two-faced director. In the studio scenes, Rob Reiner, Oliver Platt, Michael Ontkean and J.D. Souther provide even smaller bits. I just wish Fisher could have explored Suzanne's recovery beyond the fatherly pep talk from Korshack and the final moment of vulnerability from Doris. Beyond Fisher's commentary, the 2001 DVD contains partial filmographies for the principal players and several unrelated trailers.",4,Mother-Daughter Tensions Overshadow the Drugs in Carrie Fisher's Sharp-Tongued Hollywood Tale,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,2870,"['Carrie', 'Fisher', 'bracingly', 'candid', 'acerbically', 'amusing', 'commentary', 'definitely', 'worth', 'listen', 'when', 'watch', 'scabrous', '1990', 'comedy', 'especially', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'onher', 'first', 'novel', 'turn', 'was', 'based', 'life', 'drug-addicted', 'movie', 'actress', 'who', 'be', 'daughter', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'Eddie', 'Fisher', 'self-assured', 'Mike', 'Nichols', 'helm', 'picture', 'glossy', 'often', 'insider', 'look', 'Hollywood', 'also', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'quality', 'thanks', 'mainly', 'shrewdly', 'observant', 'interplay', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'mother', 'daughter', 'Streep', 'Suzanne', 'Vale', 'actress', 'successful', 'enough', 'star', 'cheesy', 'action', 'flick', 'spiraling', 'control', 'drug', 'habit', 'fact', 'barely', 'film', 'veteran', 'director', 'Lowell', 'Korshack', 'initially', 'snappish', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'riot', 'act', 'set', 'budget-escalating', 'addiction.In', 'midst', 'bleary-eyed', 'one-night-stand', 'Suzanne', 'comatose', 'overdose', 'taken', 'hospital', 'where', 'stomach', 'pumped', 'smitten', 'doctor', 'puppyish', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'recovers', 'can', 'work', 'next', 'picture', 'only', 'will', 'live', 'movie', 'star', 'mother', 'Doris', 'Mann', 'appease', 'insurance', 'company', 'rest', 'movie', 'Suzanne', 'bumpy', 'road', 'recovery', 'story', 'really', 'flight', 'when', 'prickly', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'Doris', 'larger-than-life', 'personality', 'who', 'well', 'mother', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'being', 'judgmental', 'competitive', 'showing', 'off', 'gams', 'piano', 'belting', 'out', 'Sondheim', ""'m"", 'Still', 'Here', 'revealing', 'pathetically', 'shorn', 'head', 'auto', 'collision', 'MacLaine', 'spot-on', 'role', 'probably', 'best', 'latter-day', 'performances', 'Aurora', 'Greenway', 'inTerms', 'Endearment.Liberated', 'parade', 'accents', 'period', 'costumes', 'Streep', 'first', 'too', 'accomplished', 'be', 'playing', 'second-rate', 'actress', 'bedraggled', 'Suzanne', 'likeably', 'flawed', 'also', 'off', 'impressive', 'singing', 'voice', 'couple', 'country-western', 'numbers', 'Beyond', 'Hackman', 'Dreyfuss', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'effectively', 'errant', 'lover', 'smarmy', 'panache', 'are', 'nice', 'near-cameos', 'Annette', 'Bening', 'flaky', 'actress', 'Gary', 'Morton', 'Suzanne', 'agent', 'Robin', 'Bartlett', 'Suzanne', 'sardonic', 'rehab', 'roommate', 'CCH', 'Pounder', 'unctuous', 'rehab', 'counselor', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'two-faced', 'director', 'studio', 'scenes', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'J.D', 'Souther', 'provide', 'even', 'smaller', 'bits', 'just', 'wish', 'Fisher', 'could', 'have', 'explored', 'Suzanne', 'recovery', 'fatherly', 'pep', 'talk', 'Korshack', 'final', 'moment', 'vulnerability', 'Doris', 'Beyond', 'Fisher', 'commentary', '2001', 'DVD', 'partial', 'filmographies', 'principal', 'players', 'several', 'unrelated', 'trailers']",N/A

Perez ""Jose""","[1, 2]","What I personally found amazing about &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; was its unexpected ability to hit home themes and issues that all of us deal with, day in and day out.  Meryl Streep's amazing performance registered for me most in how &quot;ordinary&quot; she made this character.  McClaine's over the top and still profoundly rich performance is the perfect foil for Streep's character.  But the film's most extraordinary quality is in developing profound themes about parenting and relationships with those you love the most in life.  We don't yearn for Suzanne's rich celebrity filled existence.  Instead, we relate to it, and can easily place ourselves in her situation.  That's Streep's greatest achievement - every step of the way, she's real and familiar to us.  She is us.  McClaine's mother is all our mothers.  Not unlike the superior &quot;All ABout My Mother&quot; Pedro Almovodar's great film about loss and redemption, Poscards also confronts many of the same issues, though in flesh and blood.  As if reminding us that unlike Esteban in &quot;Mother&quot; we are still living and have the opportunity to do something to work the issues through.  &quot;Postcards&quot; stands as a rich character study of life as most of us know it - the struggle for independence as teens and young adults, the need to prove ourselves in the shadows of our parents (or mentors, or friends, or spouses) and the very real risks involved in making choices that might seem trivial at the time.  Streep brings us on this journey and in return, we can use these lessons in our own somewhat bland lives.  A deep and rich examination of the mother-daughter dynamic that represents the parent-child in all of us.  Best moment:  McClaine at the top of the stairs proclaiming &quot;I didn't lift it up!

575203,A12WE3MP6QF04,B000059XTI,"""nanabush""","[6, 6]","This movie was such a refreshing change for Meryl Streep.  She truly shined in a brillant comedic performance as Suzanne Vale, a middle-aged movie actress struggling with drug addiction, her relationship with her aloof mother (Shirley MacLaine) and the challenges of day to day life.  What impressed me the most about Meryl Streep is that you get to see her as a normal, frumpy woman.  Basically, someone you could relate to and sympathize with.  Finally, you get a chance to see Meryl in a film that doesn't take place in some era/period with extravagant costumes and accents.  Ofcourse, many of you already know that this film is based on actress, Carrie Fisher's, bestselling book of the same name.  The dialogue is so witty and fresh that I envy all the actors who got to opportunity to bring the words to life.  One of my favourite scenes is between Suzanne and her mother on the staircase.  In the scene, Suzanne confronts her mother about giving her sleeping pills when she was a child.  She also confronts her about holding her back.  A few memorable lines:  &quot;You don't want me to be a singer.  You're the singer, you're the performer.  I can't possible compete with you.  What if somebody won ?  You want me to do well, just not better than you.&quot;  I love that scene.  It even gets more histerical when her mother defends herself about the &quot;birthday party incident&quot;.  A memorable line:  &quot;I did not lift my skirt.  IT TWIRLED UP !!&quot;.  Then the scene of reconciliation in the hospital.  Some memorable lines:  &quot;You know what dear ?  I think I'm jealous of you.  And that is because it being your turn and all.  And I find it difficult to face that my time is almost up.&quot;  Both of the Oscar-winning actresses bring such life and energy to their characters.  For this film, Meryl Streep was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe.  Shirley MacLaine was nominated for a British Academy Award and Golden Globe.

575211,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B000059XTI,S. Schell,"[2, 2]","""Postcards From The Edge"" is by all means an autobiographical account of a very chaotic period in actress Carrie Fisher's life.  Her inspirations for her debut novel (originally published in October of '89) were her personal experiences in a drug rehabilitation center surmounting a cocaine habit, the relationship between she and her screen-veteran mother Debbie Reynolds and, generally, her wry perspective of life itself.  However, instead of sharing her mordant musings as the main character, Fisher created her counterpart in a character named Suzanne Vale (Streep).  Vale is a rising talent in the film industry with - surprise - an addiction to cocaine.  She has other indulgences as well and one day pops pills until the inevitable occurs - she is rushed to Cedars Sinai emergency room to have her stomach pumped.  Upon her near-death experience, she is committed to rehab and makes a deal with her director Lowell Kershak (Hackman): stay sober, get paid.  Of course, this is a grueling period not only because Suzanne is trying to curb her addiction but also because part of the deal involves living with her mother Doris Mann (MacLaine), an aging starlet who is eccentric, overburdening and an occasional alcoholic.Meryl Streep said while reading Fisher's acerbic but earnest screenplay that she immediately fell in love with the story from a single line uttered by her character during her struggle with sobriety: ""I know my life is good - I just can't feel it."" Streep undertakes one of her more complex roles; using Fisher's insight on the driving force behind drug dependence and building from her own interpretation, she portrays Suzanne as a conflicted but staunch individual struggling to gain a sense of authority over her own life.  Although the role of Suzanne called for a serious dramatic depiction, Fisher's dry humor and Streep's impeccable comedic timing make her conflict frivolous and fun to watch.  Director Mike Nichols (Regarding Henry, Working Girl, Biloxi Blues) had brought out the best in Streep before - she earned an Academy Award nomination in his 1983 film ""Silkwood"" as the title character.  He proved once again to be her good luck charm when Streep caught the Academy's attention for the ninth time, earning her seventh nomination for Best Actress.Nichols also enlisted Shirley MacLaine as Doris Mann, Vale's brazen mother.  She had already been intimately acquainted with the role of an oppressive parent, winning an Oscar for her endearing performance as Aurora Greenway in ""Terms Of Endearment"".  This bawdy, russet-tressed thespian has a long resume; although she has portrayed many a character, she gives Doris a much-needed spark combated by a unique sensitivity, making her performance a markedly impressive one.  This is a sorely underrated role, overshadowed by critically acclaimed performances of her past.Gene Hackman and Dennis Quaid make for entertaining supporting roles as Jack Faulkner and Lowell Kershak, respectively.  Quaid is adept at playing the smug spinster and therefore makes his character easy to despise.  Hackman, a refined player with credits like ""Target"", ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The Firm"" plays a hard-edged but sympathetic film director who is willing to forgive and forget, knowing that Suzanne has so much more to offer to the film industry.Both MacLaine and Streep get a chance to boast their musical theater skills - Shirley sings a lively rendition of ""I'm Still Here"", a song by Stephen Sondheim that the man himself amended with personalized lyrics especially for her.  Streep sings the languid Ray Charles classic ""You Don't Know Me"" and at the very end of the film belts a country-western tune ""I'm Checking Out"" written by Shel Silverstein with little-known Canadian rockers Blue Rodeo in accompaniment.When Fisher was asked to write the screenplay for her novel, the producers wanted the film to focus more intimately upon Vale's relationship with her mother, even though much of the content of her book dealt with her tenure in rehab. Fisher didn't mind the change but much of the facts were slightly exaggerated not only for the drama but the comedy as well.  People will find this out as well as several other factoids while listening to Fisher's gravelly voiceover during the commentary mode.  It's almost as if one is sitting in the very room with Fisher while watching the movie, cracking odd jokes and having a drink or two.  Her dry wit is unique and distinctive, making it easy for the audience to realize and identify with the overall philosophy of the film.On the whole, ""Postcards From The Edge"" is an endearing portrait of the impenetrable bond between mother and daughter and, coming from Fisher's point-of-view, a quirky and poignant portrait indeed.",4,Fisher Fiascos,993772800,"06 29,

575214,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B000059XTI,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[3, 3]","""Postcards From The Edge"" was written by Carrie Fisher, who based the screenplay on her autobiography. That autobiography was in turn loosely based on her personal life growing up in the Hollywood limelight as the daughter of a famous actress, Debbie Reynolds. When it came time to cast the film Debbie expressed an interest in being cast as the mother, but director Mike Nichols (""The Birdcage"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"") decided on Shirley MacLaine. Meryl Streep was cast as the daughter after deciding to star in some light-weight films in the late eighties, most notably ""She-Devil"". The chemistry between MacLaine and Streep is excellent and Nichols direction is superb. It is, however, Fisher's screenplay that makes the film work and we get a chance to see the struggle between a mother and daughter in forming a real relationship while trying to survive in the movie industry. Drug addiction, vanity, and actresses getting old are some of the issues the film tackles. Dennis Quaid and Gene Hackman have supporting roles and the film became the #1 movie in the country upon its release in 1990. ""Postcards From The Edge"" garnered Streep an Oscar nod as Best Actress and the title song ""I'm Checkin' Out"" was nominated for Best Song. That song was performed at the 1991 Academy Awards by country music superstar Reba McEntire who had recently lost her entire band in a planecrash.

I too can relate to Suzanne Vale's travails; her dependency on drugs, the struggle with her relationship with her mother and with her career.BUT, I do not think that this movie is so much about any of that or even about the obvious...what I do say the movie is about is the dialectic of 'Becoming vs. Being'.I'm not going to explain what I mean by that and I'm sure that the mature and savvy readers who ponder my humble words will know what I mean...but there is one line that everyone has overlooked...the 'Tell' (for me) so to speak and that is when Suzanne is embracing Gene Hackman in a nearly Father and Daughter dialog when she mutters...'I don't want life to imitate art...I want life to be art.'  WOW!!!Perhaps it is the very high expectations that Suzanne places on herself and in the quest for full self expression within the dynamics of living in the Umbra of her mother that drives her to drug dependency and is the source of her deep rooted unhappiness...Having spoken those words which segue shortly to the last scene of the film as Suzanne delivers a rousing rendition of Heartbreak Hotel there is no line of distinction in her performance between her life as an actress and her passion for her life and her craft fully self expressed, becoming no more.At that moment I dropped a tear or two.",5,"I simply love Meryl Streep, perhaps the greatest living actress of our time.",1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,1701,"['Having', 'just', 'seen', ""'The"", 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'last', 'several', 'months', 'not', 'just', 'see', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'have', 'become', 'transfixed', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'acting', 'ability', 'level', 'perfection', 'style', 'screen.I', 'know', 'everyone', 'written', 'review', 'given', 'spin', 'being', ""'Hollywood"", 'Insider', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'too', 'can', 'relate', 'Suzanne', 'Vale', 'travails', 'dependency', 'drugs', 'struggle', 'relationship', 'mother', 'career.BUT', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'even', 'obvious', 'what', 'do', 'say', 'movie', 'about', 'dialectic', ""'Becoming"", 'vs', ""Being'.I"", ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'explain', 'what', 'mean', ""'m"", 'sure', 'mature', 'savvy', 'readers', 'who', 'ponder', 'humble', 'words', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'one', 'line', 'everyone', 'overlooked', ""'Tell"", 'so', 'speak', 'when', 'Suzanne', 'embracing', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'nearly', 'Father', 'Daughter', 'dialog', 'when', 'mutters', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'life', 'imitate', 'art', 'want', 'life', 'be', 'art', 'WOW', 'Perhaps', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'Suzanne', 'places', 'herself', 'quest', 'full', 'self', 'expression', 'dynamics', 'living', 'Umbra', 'mother', 'drug', 'dependency', 'source', 'deep', 'rooted', 'unhappiness', 'Having', 'spoken', 'words', 'segue', 'shortly', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'Suzanne', 'rousing', 'rendition', 'Heartbreak', 'Hotel', 'line', 'distinction', 'performance', 'life', 'actress', 'passion', 'life', 'craft', 'fully', 'expressed', 'becoming', 'more.At', 'moment', 'dropped', 'tear', 'two']",N/A
