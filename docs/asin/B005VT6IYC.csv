1504256,A28YK7B27X3N0N,B005VT6IYC,bas bleu,"[17, 17]","I needed to work on my flexibility , besides getting older I have had some huge lifestyle changes and am not getting enough physical exercise, with a 10 pound weight limit and degenerated discs in my lower back and chronic sciatica I needed to chose something to gain back flexibility without adding to the damage. So I did quit a bit of looking before I chose this DVD. I figured I would not be able to even do all the warm up exercises, and some of them were tough for me. Being geared to older people great care is taken to encourage you to not push to the pain point, listen to your body and honor it if it says nope can't do this or modify any exercise you need.  Also great emphasis put on no stress and keeping your muscles and joints relaxed.  I was able to do more than I expected and when I was done , (and for me this was the real kicker) my lower back which is in constant pain felt so much better.  I am taking it slow, decided to do the warm ups only and walk 15 minutes a day to start and then go from there. There are 4 sessions on the Dvd 1. Warm ups about 20 minutes, these are all done laying down. 2. Yoga stretches all  for the upper body and all done sitting down I think this one runs around 30 minutes 3. Stretches for the lower body - all done standing. And 4th a cool down period of stretching.  There are enough different moves that if some are not doable for you and you have to leave a couple out of your routine, the others will still be enough to help build flexibility, balance and increase strength.  I feel like I can easily give this 5 stars because I have a damaged body and it is responding positively to these exercises and not causing more damage  that is what I was looking for, something that would alleviate pain and hopefully add strength to what can be salvaged on this old body and strengthen muscles around the muscles that need help and thus hopefully prevent additional or new damage.  Getting old stinks , but this Dvd is doing what I had hoped.",5,Granny friendly!!!!!,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,1994,"['needed', 'work', 'flexibility', 'getting', 'older', 'have', 'had', 'huge', 'lifestyle', 'changes', 'am', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'physical', 'exercise', '10', 'pound', 'weight', 'limit', 'degenerated', 'discs', 'lower', 'back', 'chronic', 'sciatica', 'needed', 'chose', 'something', 'gain', 'back', 'flexibility', 'adding', 'damage', 'did', 'quit', 'bit', 'looking', 'chose', 'DVD', 'figured', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'even', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'exercises', 'were', 'tough', 'Being', 'geared', 'older', 'people', 'great', 'care', 'taken', 'encourage', 'not', 'push', 'pain', 'point', 'listen', 'body', 'honor', 'nope', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'modify', 'exercise', 'need', 'Also', 'great', 'emphasis', 'put', 'stress', 'keeping', 'muscles', 'joints', 'relaxed', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'more', 'expected', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'real', 'kicker', 'lower', 'back', 'constant', 'pain', 'felt', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'am', 'taking', 'slow', 'decided', 'do', 'warm', 'only', 'walk', '15', 'minutes', 'day', 'start', 'then', 'go', 'there', 'are', '4', 'sessions', 'Dvd', '1', 'Warm', 'ups', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'done', 'laying', 'down', '2', 'Yoga', 'stretches', 'upper', 'body', 'done', 'sitting', 'down', 'think', 'one', '30', 'minutes', '3', 'Stretches', 'lower', 'body', 'done', 'standing', '4th', 'cool', 'down', 'period', 'stretching', 'are', 'enough', 'different', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'doable', 'have', 'leave', 'couple', 'routine', 'others', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'enough', 'help', 'build', 'flexibility', 'balance', 'increase', 'strength', 'feel', 'can', 'easily', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'have', 'damaged', 'body', 'responding', 'positively', 'exercises', 'not', 'causing', 'more', 'damage', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'would', 'alleviate', 'pain', 'hopefully', 'add', 'strength', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'salvaged', 'old', 'body', 'strengthen', 'muscles', 'muscles', 'need', 'help', 'thus', 'hopefully', 'prevent', 'additional', 'new', 'damage', 'Getting', 'old', 'stinks', 'Dvd', 'doing', 'what', 'had', 'hoped']","Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams: A Complete Beginning Yoga Practice for Midlife (40's - 70's) to Increase Strength, Flexibility, Balance, Good Posture, and Overall Well-being."
