663566,A1Q4ZU2Y929N0A,B00005LKI1,"Bruce Gray ""gurpsgm""","[1, 1]","In the third theatrical release of the Pokemon series, we are introduced to the ""Unown"" and their powers and abilities.  This was almost as good as the first movie.If you're unfamiliar with the basics, Pokemon (short for ""POcKEt MONsters"") are creatures a little like those from this world, but with strange and unusual powers and abilities that they use for their masters - masters that can be either good or evil.  Ash and his friends train their Pokemon to fight battles with their enemies.  They travel all over the planet to collect new and unusual types of Pokemon.  They trap Pokemon in ""Poke Balls"" - a small device that hangs from a belt.  When Ash's enemies release their Pokemon to do their work, Ash and his friends release their Pokemon, and they have a big battle.The story revolves around Molly and her missing father.  Molly's father had been involved in an archaeological expedition to find out more about the mysterious ""Unown"" - Pokemon that look like letters of the English alphabet.  Molly's father accidentally falls victim to the Unown and his remaining work is shipped home.  Molly finds the Unown blocks that her father unearthed and begins playing with them and accidentally activates their ancient powers.  The Unown, sensing Molly's sadness, make Molly's dreams come true - her home becomes a crystal palace and they create a father figure for her - the enigmatic Entei, a lion-like Pokemon.  As Molly's fantasy life becomes more real to her, the area that is affected by the conversion process started by the Unown grows.  Soon it begins to threaten to engulf populated areas.  Of course, Ash and company are nearby to help.  Meanwhile, Molly expresses her desire to have a mother.  Mysteriously, Entei responds by capturing Ash's mother and bringing her to the fantasy palace.  Ash, along with his friends and Team Rocket (again) must stop the Unown and Entei before Molly's dreams become all too real.This story is a fine addition to the Pokemon franchise.  Its timeless story of what a little girl really wants if separated from her mother and father can foster discussions between parents and children.  Molly, of course, finally understands what is important and the world returns to normal.  This is possibly the most well done of the movies, although I liked the story and secondary plots of the first movie a little better.  The art is top notch Anime at close to greatness, and the story finale with Molly making the final decisions, is not understated nor overstated.There's also a Pikachu cartoon that younger fans of the TV show will enjoy.Almost as highly recommended as the first Pokemon film, this deserves a place in a lot of home libraries and some school and counselor's (child psychologist's) collections.",4,Almost as good as the first,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,2753,"['third', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'series', 'are', 'introduced', 'Unown', 'powers', 'abilities', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'movie.If', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'basics', 'Pokemon', 'short', 'POcKEt', 'MONsters', 'are', 'little', 'world', 'strange', 'unusual', 'powers', 'abilities', 'use', 'masters', 'masters', 'can', 'be', 'either', 'good', 'evil', 'Ash', 'friends', 'train', 'Pokemon', 'fight', 'battles', 'enemies', 'travel', 'planet', 'collect', 'new', 'unusual', 'types', 'Pokemon', 'trap', 'Pokemon', 'Poke', 'Balls', 'small', 'device', 'belt', 'When', 'Ash', 'enemies', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'do', 'work', 'Ash', 'friends', 'release', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'big', 'battle.The', 'story', 'Molly', 'missing', 'father', 'Molly', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'archaeological', 'expedition', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'mysterious', 'Unown', 'Pokemon', 'look', 'letters', 'English', 'alphabet', 'Molly', 'father', 'accidentally', 'victim', 'Unown', 'remaining', 'work', 'shipped', 'home', 'Molly', 'Unown', 'blocks', 'father', 'unearthed', 'playing', 'accidentally', 'ancient', 'powers', 'Unown', 'sensing', 'Molly', 'sadness', 'make', 'Molly', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'home', 'crystal', 'palace', 'create', 'father', 'figure', 'enigmatic', 'Entei', 'lion-like', 'Pokemon', 'Molly', 'fantasy', 'life', 'more', 'real', 'area', 'affected', 'conversion', 'process', 'started', 'Unown', 'grows', 'Soon', 'threaten', 'engulf', 'populated', 'areas', 'course', 'Ash', 'company', 'are', 'nearby', 'help', 'Meanwhile', 'Molly', 'desire', 'have', 'mother', 'Mysteriously', 'Entei', 'capturing', 'Ash', 'mother', 'bringing', 'fantasy', 'palace', 'Ash', 'friends', 'Team', 'Rocket', 'again', 'must', 'stop', 'Unown', 'Entei', 'Molly', 'dreams', 'become', 'too', 'real.This', 'story', 'fine', 'addition', 'Pokemon', 'franchise', 'timeless', 'story', 'what', 'little', 'girl', 'really', 'separated', 'mother', 'father', 'can', 'foster', 'discussions', 'parents', 'children', 'Molly', 'course', 'finally', 'what', 'important', 'world', 'normal', 'possibly', 'most', 'well', 'done', 'movies', 'liked', 'story', 'secondary', 'plots', 'first', 'movie', 'little', 'better', 'art', 'top', 'notch', 'Anime', 'close', 'greatness', 'story', 'finale', 'Molly', 'making', 'final', 'decisions', 'not', 'understated', 'also', 'Pikachu', 'cartoon', 'younger', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'will', 'enjoy.Almost', 'highly', 'recommended', 'first', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'place', 'lot', 'home', 'libraries', 'school', 'counselor', 'child', 'psychologist', 'collections']",N/A

However, this movie can be shocking at first, but once you try it enough times, it shouldn't be that shocking.  Anyway, this movie contains the following:&quot;Pikachu and Pichu&quot;, a mini movie that takes place in the big city where the Pichu bros. try their best to guide Pikachu back home before Ash Ketchum notices his Pokemon are missing.  It's very funny to see those Pokemon fight against 1 obstacle after another.  Ha!  Ha!

But not only that, you get to meet Entei, a legendary Fire-type Pokemon with the best Pokemon voice, unlike Mewtwo and Lugia which are just plain wimps.  That's because those other 2 Pokemon that first existed in Pokemon 1 and 2 tend to have bad voices, but this one has a good voice.What I do like about this movie:&quot;Pikachu and Pichu&quot; has really huge laughs, unlike &quot;Pikachu's Vacation&quot; and &quot;Pikachu's Rescue Adventure&quot;, plus it has more G/S Pokemon, which is superior.&quot;Spell of the Unown&quot; has really good animation, good laughs, and good voices, unlike &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;The Power of One&quot;, plus it has 3 soundtracks that has you moving and grooving to the beat, along with 2 excellent looking Pokemon (Unown and Entei) and 3 forms of the final boss, Molly.What I don't like about this movie:&quot;Pikachu and Pichu&quot; may tend to get annoying and loud at times during the film.&quot;Spell of the Unown&quot; is a movie that could be too creepy for little kids, plus it's way too loud!

663573,A2SAA88HCSS7RB,B00005LKI1,Jack,"[4, 4]","If you are an anime fan, you should buy this movie. I'm sure that many of you may think Pokemon is a childish, naive type of anime that's only for kids under age 10... however, Pokemon has more themes than just friendships even though it is not as sophisticated as Spirited Away...Let me begin with graphics. I love the graphics in this anime, they are extremely detailed and varied in colours. There are scenes where 3D technologies are combined with 2D animations, they are rendered well, despite the fact that 2D is flat and 3D is more dimensional. Facial expressions are well reflected through characters' moods.Next the sound. For North American anime fans, they know very well that almost every single anime is edited in some way so that the lip movements of characters fit the English voice acting. Well, you'd expect the same in Pokemon... As some of the earlier reviews point out, the Japanese version is longer in length and has more stuff to it; however, there is not a significant difference between the Eng and the Jap one. Personally I think the American voice actors and actresses for Pokemon have done a good job! They actually put their feelings and emotions into the anime to make it fit the overall atmosphere. (if you have seen Totoro's English version, that's what I call ""bad voice acting""....) Some people hate the BGMs, because they are completely rewritten and recomposed. I love them, even they are miles away from the originals. The songs are cheerful and beautiful, ""to know the unknown"" for example.Finally the story. Out of all 3 movies, this one is my favorite. The reason is because it teaches children and even adults lessons about love, loyalty, dreams, friendship, determination are intermixed in this film to make the story more complicated than most people expect. Every anime is childish in some way (except those blood lust ones), but every anime has its meanings and lessons about life incooperated inside... it's up to you to discover them.Overall, Pokemon 3 is one of the best animes out there, it is not as childish as most people think, so get your hands on this great film before it becomes extinct in stores!!!",5,"Awesome Movie, a must have!!",1041120000,"12 29, 2002",2002,2156,"['are', 'anime', 'fan', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'may', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'childish', 'naive', 'type', 'anime', 'only', 'kids', 'age', '10', 'however', 'Pokemon', 'more', 'themes', 'just', 'friendships', 'even', 'not', 'as', 'sophisticated', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Let', 'begin', 'graphics', 'love', 'graphics', 'anime', 'are', 'extremely', 'detailed', 'varied', 'colours', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', '3D', 'technologies', 'are', 'combined', '2D', 'animations', 'are', 'rendered', 'well', 'fact', '2D', 'flat', '3D', 'more', 'dimensional', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'well', 'reflected', 'characters', 'moods.Next', 'sound', 'North', 'American', 'anime', 'fans', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'single', 'anime', 'edited', 'way', 'lip', 'movements', 'characters', 'fit', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'Well', ""'d"", 'expect', 'same', 'Pokemon', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'point', 'out', 'Japanese', 'version', 'longer', 'length', 'more', 'stuff', 'however', 'not', 'significant', 'difference', 'Eng', 'Jap', 'one', 'Personally', 'think', 'American', 'voice', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'actually', 'put', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'anime', 'make', 'fit', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'seen', 'Totoro', 'English', 'version', 'what', 'call', 'bad', 'voice', 'acting', 'people', 'hate', 'BGMs', 'are', 'completely', 'rewritten', 'recomposed', 'love', 'even', 'are', 'miles', 'away', 'originals', 'songs', 'are', 'cheerful', 'beautiful', 'know', 'unknown', 'example.Finally', 'story', '3', 'movies', 'one', 'favorite', 'reason', 'children', 'even', 'adults', 'lessons', 'love', 'loyalty', 'dreams', 'friendship', 'determination', 'are', 'intermixed', 'film', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'complicated', 'most', 'people', 'expect', 'anime', 'childish', 'way', 'blood', 'lust', 'ones', 'anime', 'meanings', 'lessons', 'life', 'incooperated', 'up', 'discover', 'them.Overall', 'Pokemon', '3', 'one', 'best', 'animes', 'out', 'there', 'not', 'as', 'childish', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'so', 'get', 'hands', 'great', 'film', 'extinct', 'stores']",N/A

663575,AY5XWJE0LEYB8,B00005LKI1,jasmine garcia,"[0, 0]","It's a nice sunny day in the big city, a Lapras tour boat passes a Dratini gondola along the river and a bus drives along a street. The scene then goes along a street of sheets being hung out to dry before focusing on the Pichu's den where the Pichu Brothers are happily chasing each other amongst the piles of junk. They then run up a stack of tires to a see saw and they both sit on it and bounce on it for a little while until it wont bounce any more so they try bouncing harder only making Pichu's younger bro roll into himThe Pichu bros then decide to call out for their friends. The first to hear them is Smoochum who is trying to get a hair straight whilst looking in her mirror. Next Magby hears them call out. Wooper who is happily swimming around a barrel near a water tower also hears them and jumps out of the barrel.Meanwhile in a tree Teddiursa is sitting on a branch eating some nuts he has stored in it and nearly chokes when he hears the Pichu Bros calling out.Smoochum and Magby run through a hole in a fence and Wooper jumps off some tires and they all jump on the see saw. Teddiursa who is late jumps on the other side of the see saw to even things out causing Wooper to fly into the sky through the clock of Pichu's house and lands on the slide of which he happily slides down and jumps off at the end. Everyone else decides its fun and all go to the top of the slide. Pichu's younger bro who is impatient decides he will go first and march's towards the edge of the slide so his older bro decides to pull him away except he slips and falls onto a bit of wood.Pichu's younger bro then climbs back up and starts arguing with his older bro and pulls down his eyelid and sticks his tongue out and they both angrily stare and put their heads together, Magby then decides to stop them arguing and steps in between them only to be hit by Pichu's younger bro which makes Magby fall down onto the tires and Wooper and Teddiursa come to investigate and Magby starts getting red and literally blows his top except Teddiursa holds Wooper whilst he water gun's Magby to cool him down.The Pichu bro's are still arguing and Smoochum decides to stop them arguing this time except the Pichu Bro' start sparking a shock each other as well as Smoochum in the process as well as Magby and Teddiursa, however they have both made them selves dizzy from using too much electricity and Pichu's younger bro falls backwards down the slide, fly's off the end into some junk and emerges flat out on a skateboard and Wooper jumps on a roller-skate and chases after him as the skateboard with Pichu on rolls through the fence and down a steep hill, across a busy road and into a park with Wooper chasing after him.Meanwhile Azumarill is in a flower bed and watches as Pichu and Wooper go past and stop on a stretch of road, Suddenly a truck is heading towards them so Azumarill sucks in some air and lets out a powerful water gun that pushes them away from the truck to the other side of the road, of where they come to a standstill again and Pichu wakes up wondering where he is and suddenly realises that he had an argument with his bro and sits angrily whilst Wooper stares at him. Meanwhile at the other side of the city Pichu's older bro wakes up and looks for his bro and is upset he has disappeared.Back in the park Pichu's younger bro is walking angrily with his arms folded until he sees some balloons which suddenly makes him happy and sneakily hides behind a dustbin and gets Wooper to do the same, they then crawl quietly along the floor towards the balloons and stop and notice the balloon seller has dozed off to sleep so Pichu tip toes up to double check and then climbs up to where the balloons are and grabs the string of which lifts him into the air whilst Wooper looks on with a confused look on his face. Pichu's older bro, Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa however have entered the park in their search for Pichu's younger bro and start calling out for him.Azumarill is still tending to her flowers as Pichu and co walk past and spy the skateboard and roller-skate. They then run across the road to them thinking Pichu's younger bro must be near! Azumarill then appears and Pichu tells her what happened and She tells them the direction they headed in so Pichu and co decide to go in the direction Azumarill told them. Teddiursa spots a nut on the floor and picks it up and eats it and then suddenly sees a whole load of nuts scattered on the floor and sits down and starts to eat them until he sees a passing Murkrow and decides to gather them up so it doesn't spot them and take them.Meanwhile Pichu's younger bro is floating above the park is shouting out for help and suddenly spots his brother and shouts again and his bro turns round to see nothing in the sky but a Murkrow. Elsewhere Wooper walks along side a lake whilst nearby Pichu and co are looking near a building in the park, Smoochum suddenly spots Pichu's bro floating in the sky and his older bro calls out to him. Suddenly a gust of wind catches the balloons Pichu is holding onto and blows him into some paint cans that are on top of some scaffolding that is next to the park building which knocks them over 1 by 1 causing Pichu and co to run away from them. And as they jump off the end of the plank they all bounce off Houndour's head as he just happens to be sleeping there which wakes him up just as he gets covered with a pot of yellow paint and Pichu Smoochum and Magby run away only to notice Pichu's younger bro has been blown into the distance. Suddenly a rather now angry Houndour appears behind them and starts chasing them out of the park, through the streets to beside the river, Pichu and co suddenly skid to a halt at a dead end until Houndour skids into them knocking them into the river.Suddenly some big eyes spy from a sewer pipe as a shadowy Pok&eacute;mon runs out of it and dives into the water to save them, suddenly a blue tail emerges from the water lifting Pichu, Smoochum, Houndour and Magby up, we now see that the Pok&eacute;mon is non other than a Feraligatr, they thank it and it gently tosses them out of the water and Pichu, Magby and Smoochum land safely back in the park and Smoochum checks her hair in the mirror whilst Houndour bounce off a shop canopy onto a pavement where a Snorlax rolls over and squashes him.Meanwhile back in the park Wooper is swimming round the fountain pool whilst Pichu's younger brother hangs on for life to the balloon string he then spots a Murkrow (yes the same one) heading towards him which starts to pop his balloons which makes the balloons lose height. Teddiursa is now carrying his now collected nuts and puts them in the mouth of a Magikarp statue. He then hears Pichu above him who is losing height and starts running around thinking what to do. He then spots Wooper and goes and grabs him and runs as Murkrow pops the final balloon causing Pichu to fall.Teddiursa then gets Wooper to water gun at Pichu which gives him a nice wet but comfy landing, until Wooper runs out of water making him dizzy eyed which causes Pichu to fall onto Wooper and Teddiursa. They then all laugh and walk back to the Pichu's den where Pichu's older brother is standing with his arms folded and tapping his foot along with an unhappy Smoochum and Magby.The Pichu bros then start to argue again and Teddiursa starts running around whilst Smoochum tells Magby to go get some help quick. So Magby runs off to find Azumarill of whom he pushes back to Pichu's den where they are now sparking cheeks at each other again and Teddiursa is still running around. Azumarill tells them to stop except when the Pichu bro's shock each other Azumarill ends up getting hit by a stray spark. Anyways the Pichu bros make them selves dizzy again from their electricity and fall flat out on the floor. Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa try to wake them up as Azumarill is now Very angry for being shocked and they run off leaving the Pichu bro's still flat out on the floor. The Pichu bros now wake up and get scared by Azumarill who aims a water gun at them but misses and then ends up soaking Magby, Smoochum and Teddiursa.Smoochum looks in her mirror noticing she is all wet and gets mad and starts using a Icy wind attack everywhere. Now every time Azumarill uses her water gun it gets frozen by Smoochum's icy wind until a bit of ice falls down and hits Magby on the head which gets him angry and makes him use flamethrower and now when Azumarill uses water gun and Smoochum uses icy wind, Magby's flamethrower carves the ice into a slide until the whole place is covered with an icy slide. This makes the Pok&eacute;mon stop what their doing and forget about everything as they gaze at the beautiful sight.They all decide to go on it and line up and as before Pichu's younger bro goes at the front but Pichu's older bro reminds him about not pushing in and he embarrassedly agrees whilst everyone goes on the slide and has fun as the story comes to a close.",5,friends to the

Nickerson,"[2, 2]","Entei's line &quot;You are MAMA!&quot; was probably the corniest line in the entire movie, but still, it doesn't detract from the fact that this was probably the best Pokemon movie yet. I admit, the first movie was kinda lame, but I enjoyed the second one (I'm a sucker for Luiga and Slowking) and I'm pleased to say that unlike most movie series, the Pokemon movies seem to get better with age. Now, I could go on, talking about how smooth the animation has gotten, how great the story is, that Pikachu and Pichu was the best of all the mini-movies or how Team Rocket had so little screen time, but everyone else has already raved about this movie. I want to go into detail about how well done this DVD is. Perhaps the best part is the Commentary by the writer and director of the movies. They talk about the troubles of translating and editing in the movie to appeal (and make sense) to a western audience, about how most people don't really give Pokemon movies any credit, and at some parts even MST the movie! Other bright spots include the original Japanese trailer for Pokemon 4 (which sadly confirms that WB will NOT be releasing the fourth movie in theaters), and the Pokerap GS, which I actually like for some sick reason. But there are still a couple of problems. For one, there's no widescreen version, which really stinks. In full screen, there are a couple of instances of characters speaking, but they've been cut off the screen. Another is the making of To Know the Unknown video. It just feels like filler material, and they could have at least included the actual music video.Otherwise, it was a groovy movie.

Many intresting special features were included that made the price well worth it!  However the Pokemon 2000 DVD was a joke.  It lacked everything.  The only thing you could really say for it was that it had the theatrical trailer (Sad huh?)!  However I am pleased to say Warner has gotten this one right!  We have the free trading card, a COMMENTARY, DVD-Rom features, and the best part (Or one of the best things to come out of edited anime DVD's that is) THE JAPANESE TRAILER FOR POKEMON 4!!!!!!!  This makes me so happy to see that WB is making the Japanese stuff known (That, or mabye they were trying to save some money on making a trailer for the forth movie themselves.  Sneaky.)!However there are still some flaws even though they did MUCH better then last year!  For one thing, there's no option for widescreen (Which dissapoints me GREATLY!).  No Japanese audio track.  They have the making of &quot;To Know The Unknown&quot; music video, but they don't have the ACTUAL music video on the disk!  And the Johto Pokerap is TERRIBLE (Even though I already knew it was after listening to the CD)!  I never dreamed I would miss the old Pokerap ao much.  And the last problem is they still have the mini-movie there (WB, if I wanted to buy the mini-movies, I'LL BUY THE MINI-MOVIES!!!!

663581,AQGCART9DSM8B,B00005LKI1,"""lugia2010""","[12, 12]","I wasn't sure if this movie would be anywhere near as good as Revelaton Lugia, the second Japanese Pok&eacute;mon movie. However, when I saw the original Japanese version in January, I knew that it was! Something previously unheard of in a Pok&eacute;mon film was developed: a plot! In this movie, the characters all have clear, simple objectives and we know from the start what this film is going to be about. This doesn't mean that the movie doesn't have its moments of suspense. This structure simply allows the movie to progress more 'naturally', without some of the restrictive assumptions that were made in the first two films, such as having Pikachu in every other frame!The Spell of the Unown tells the story of the legendary Pok&eacute;mon Entei and the Unown, and how one little girl's unhappiness almost brought about disaster. The movie starts with the Molly's (the little girl) father disappearing. We also learn later that her mother has disappeared also. Feeling alone and sad, Molly discovers the box of Unown letters that had been found where her father was last seen. These letters (which are symbols of the Unown) summon forth a hoard of Unown, that seem to sense her unhappiness and try to make her wishes come true. Thus, the legendary Pok&eacute;mon Entei is summoned, whom Molly believes to be her father. The Unown form a crystal tower around the mansion where Molly lives, which slowly begins to extend into the surrounding countryside. Also, Molly asks Entei to find her a mother. Once kidnapped, Ash begins his efforts to rescue her from Molly's 'crystal tower'.I won't spoil the ending for you, but the message behind this movie is that of the bond between parents and their children. All of the Pok&eacute;mon movies have themes (in Mewtwo Strikes Back we learned that senseless fighting was wrong - in the second movie the theme was that of believing in yourself), and this movie is the first to portray that message so clearly inside the film. One of the final scenes in the end credits is that of Molly being reunited with her real mother.The 'Pichu and Pikachu' short was great! Perhaps not quite so good as the original 'Pikachu's Summer Vacation' but still great. For the first time, the original Japanese music was carried over from Japan and left in the US editon. I am all for this as the US music tends to be somewhat inappropriate for the shorts, always being far too kiddy.As usual, the animation and CGI are up to their normal high standards, and the background music for the film was very good. Again, it was a shame that the movie score was made overly 'poppy', but this was balanced out by the retention of the original score for the short 'Pichu and Pikachu'. The music for the short was all carried over from the original Japanese production.Overall, this movie is evidence that the US producers have listened to fans' requests to keep to the original storyline as much as possible. It's also nice to see that this film was completely Tracy free! This film is recommended to all ages, even those who may find the television series a little stodgy.

Neither the characters nor the story were strong enough to elevate it above the level of Saturday morning cartoons. The second Pokemon movie showed a great improvement in the story with the underlying theme of man vs. nature, but no improvement was made on the development of the characters except for Delia, Ash's mom. This latest endevour has done a much better job of developing the characters of Ash, Delia, and the little girl Molly. The movie opens, Molly's mother had mysteriously vanished some years earlier and soon her father also disappears while researching the lengendary Pokemon called Unown. Now alone in the world Molly investigates a box of strange tablets sent to her by her father. These tablets turn out to be the Unown in some dormant state. The power of Molly's grief and sadness awaken them and begin to transform the world into an alternate reality composed of her dreams and wishes. I have been a rabid sci-fi nut for many years so this concept was quite easy to grasp - it was done very well in the original Star Trek pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;. However I think this would be quite difficult for young children to comprehend, even though it is explained fairly well in the movie. Molly's lonliness, her fear of the outside world trying to harm her is brought out very well - she is very human, very easy to identify with. In many ways she is like the villain Yugi of the third Tenchi Muyo series, but without Yugi's malicious streak. One last thing I really enjoyed was Ash's quest to rescue his mom from Molly, here he shows a very strong bond to his mom. It was so good to see him so passionate about something besides Pokemon! This is what I think sets this film apart from all of the previous Pokemon material, the characters are human, you know their feelings, and they leave something behind in you when it's all over.

All I know is that everything about Pokemon is completely annoying and if you are over 12 years old, then it should be avoided at all costs! This movie makes me barf. And that little &quot;cute&quot; Pikachu is so annoying. Agh! Pokemon makes me scream! I hate all Japaneese animation because while it may look all cute and everything, it is really bad animation. Also, when the characters speak, their mouths move way too fast and they talk way too fast, too. This movie isn't even worth taking your kids to see...you'll be too embarrassed being there to even sit straight up in your seat! All this movie's about is fighting, fighting, fighting. Fighting over what? There really is no point to this movie! Is there even a a real script? Who cares if the little fuzzy furrballs are cute? I think they're horrible-looking creatures from Planet Hell. It is totally unrealistic and is just a way to kill time and to get your kids to shut up for a few hours. So I guess it is good for that.

Many fans were upset with the way the first movie was translated, including Pok&eacute;mon errors, and also the fact that the second movie's script was rewritten with a short scene removed at the end of it.  But even with those two put together, they are completely outranked by this film...Again, the script translation of this film was pretty much dead on.  I even read the producer's success of the third movie, which included going over the small plot holes that may have been in the Japanese version of this film.The voice acting of this film is also a class of its own.  The movie really shines with the performances of Veronica Taylor (Ash/Ash's mother), Rachel Lillis (Misty/Jessie) and Eric Stuart (Brock/James).The battle scenes may be a bit too intense for younger viewers, and even though it's Rated G, I really don't recommend some of the movie's contents for children under 8.  This is also a bonus for those who are fans of the Japanese series, to see that no actual footage from the original film was removed for the English dub release.Overall, this Pok&eacute;mon film, even though the trend is dying a slow and painful death, is the best out of the three released so far.  Why?  Complete and total translation.  Japanese to English, with slight grammar changes.  That's all 4Kids needs to do, and that's exactly what they did with this film.  Hopefully the fourth film will follow the exact same steps as this one.",4,Top notch translation with fine acting makes this film great,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",2001,1478,"['was', 'actually', 'very', 'pleased', 'film', 'Many', 'fans', 'were', 'upset', 'way', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'translated', 'including', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'mon', 'errors', 'also', 'fact', 'second', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'rewritten', 'short', 'scene', 'removed', 'end', 'even', 'two', 'put', 'together', 'are', 'completely', 'outranked', 'film', 'Again', 'script', 'translation', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'even', 'read', 'producer', 'success', 'third', 'movie', 'included', 'going', 'small', 'plot', 'holes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Japanese', 'version', 'film.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'film', 'also', 'class', 'own', 'movie', 'really', 'performances', 'Veronica', 'Taylor', 'Ash/Ash', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'Lillis', 'Misty/Jessie', 'Eric', 'Stuart', 'Brock/James', '.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'intense', 'younger', 'viewers', 'even', 'Rated', 'G', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'contents', 'children', '8', 'also', 'bonus', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Japanese', 'series', 'see', 'actual', 'footage', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'removed', 'English', 'dub', 'release.Overall', 'Pok', 'eacute', 'film', 'even', 'trend', 'dying', 'slow', 'painful', 'death', 'best', 'three', 'released', 'so', 'far', 'Why', 'Complete', 'total', 'translation', 'Japanese', 'English', 'slight', 'grammar', 'changes', '4Kids', 'needs', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'fourth', 'film', 'will', 'follow', 'exact', 'same', 'steps', 'one']",N/A
