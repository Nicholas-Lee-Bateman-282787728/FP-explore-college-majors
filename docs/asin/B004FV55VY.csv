1405446,A2AVYSXICESSTK,B004FV55VY,E. Kerby,"[4, 5]","I had no idea that things were like this in Iran.  Here I'd been feeling depressed about my life today, and then I watched this movie, and I feel like I am so lucky to have my relatively simple problems.Here are a few things you may want to know if you're considering this movie:1. This movie is subtitled in English.2. This is not a very political movie.  There are some brief explanations periodically throughout the movie, so I came away with a very, very basic idea of how the political situation led to the existing conditions.  It wasn't preachy at all, though, and after watching the movie I don't have any clear sense of what the filmmaker thinks politically.  It was really much more focused on the lives of specific people.3. This movie is extremely tasteful.  Despite being about prostitution, I'm pretty sure this movie does not include any nudity or sex scenes.  There are a lot of conversations that mention sex, but nothing obscene.  There is a lot of drug use in the movie, and that is shown.  I think this movie would probably be the equivalent of PG-13--for the drug use and prostitution theme.  It seems like something that could be shown as part of a high school class.  I thought the filmmaker was very respectful of the people she was filming--and that was evidenced by how they treated her and how they responded when she asked the people questions.  This movie's themes are kind of intense, though.The movie also seems well produced.  Some scenes linger a little, so you get a sense of the slow pace of life, instead of having rapid scene changes, yet the little bits of silence here and there add to the movie instead of making it boring.  The progression of the movie seems pretty natural.  For something that isn't a mainstream popular movie, I felt like it was produced really smoothly.If you're thinking of watching this movie, I'd highly recommend it.  It was really very interesting, and sobering.  Some of the scenes are just kind of amazing--the ladies take their kids along when they go looking for ""clients"", and their lives are so pathetic in general.  I felt especially bad for the kids.",5,"Eye-opening, yet tasteful.",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2124,"['had', 'idea', 'things', 'were', 'Iran', 'Here', ""'d"", 'been', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'life', 'today', 'then', 'watched', 'movie', 'feel', 'am', 'so', 'lucky', 'have', 'relatively', 'simple', 'problems.Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'may', 'want', 'know', ""'re"", 'considering', 'movie:1', 'movie', 'subtitled', 'English.2', 'not', 'very', 'political', 'movie', 'are', 'brief', 'explanations', 'periodically', 'movie', 'came', 'away', 'very', 'very', 'basic', 'idea', 'how', 'political', 'situation', 'led', 'existing', 'conditions', 'was', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clear', 'sense', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'politically', 'was', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'focused', 'lives', 'specific', 'people.3', 'movie', 'extremely', 'tasteful', 'being', 'prostitution', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'movie', 'not', 'include', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'lot', 'conversations', 'mention', 'sex', 'nothing', 'obscene', 'lot', 'drug', 'use', 'movie', 'shown', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'equivalent', 'PG-13', 'drug', 'use', 'prostitution', 'theme', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'part', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'thought', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'very', 'respectful', 'people', 'was', 'filming', 'was', 'evidenced', 'how', 'treated', 'how', 'responded', 'when', 'asked', 'people', 'questions', 'movie', 'themes', 'are', 'kind', 'intense', 'though.The', 'movie', 'also', 'well', 'produced', 'scenes', 'linger', 'little', 'get', 'sense', 'slow', 'pace', 'life', 'instead', 'having', 'rapid', 'scene', 'changes', 'little', 'bits', 'silence', 'here', 'there', 'add', 'movie', 'instead', 'making', 'boring', 'progression', 'movie', 'pretty', 'natural', 'something', ""n't"", 'mainstream', 'popular', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'produced', 'really', 'smoothly.If', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'was', 'really', 'very', 'interesting', 'sobering', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'kind', 'amazing', 'ladies', 'take', 'kids', 'when', 'go', 'looking', 'clients', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'pathetic', 'general', 'felt', 'especially', 'bad', 'kids']",N/A

Living in a country where cruel oppression of women is law, where prostitution and drugs are rife, despite the official propaganda of the state, due to the depsarvations and destitution that is prevalent on the ground. And where both of these things go together with hypocrisy.High ranking government officials often exploit these women for sex before turning them in and having them tortured and executed.The director and narrator of this documentary is herself from Iran, who fled with her family to Sweden after the Ayatollah seized power and began massacring those associated with the deposed Shah.Iran under the Shah was one of the most liberal, tolerant and open societies in the Muslim world, especially with regards to the rights of women , which were on a par with those enjoyed by women in the West.After the Islamist took power in 1979, personal issues of morality and faith became criminalized and women were turned into dehumanized chattels. Islamic police monitor all activities of females outside their houses. Women are arrested for being lax in Islamic dress codes or being with a man other than their husband or relative. Childhood for females ends in the eyes of the regime's cruel laws at nine, (as opposed to a male at fifteen) and girl children after that age are judged as punished as adults (executed for any sexual activity or wearing 'immodest clothes' , even for being raped)The tale of these two women is a tragic one, beneath the degradation of their lives though one can detect two beautiful souls. Living in a society that crushes the human spirit and where cruelty and despotism are order of the dayshame on the West for allowing this regime to come to power and for the Left in the West and elsewhere for supporting tis regime to this day",5,Candid and disturbing,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1964,"['disturbing', 'candid', 'window', 'realities', 'today', 'Iran', 'focusing', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'Mina', 'Farida', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'sell', 'bodies', 'order', 'survive', 'feed', 'children', 'Living', 'country', 'where', 'cruel', 'oppression', 'women', 'law', 'where', 'prostitution', 'drugs', 'are', 'rife', 'official', 'propaganda', 'state', 'due', 'depsarvations', 'destitution', 'prevalent', 'ground', 'where', 'things', 'go', 'together', 'hypocrisy.High', 'ranking', 'government', 'officials', 'often', 'exploit', 'women', 'sex', 'turning', 'having', 'tortured', 'executed.The', 'director', 'narrator', 'documentary', 'Iran', 'who', 'fled', 'family', 'Sweden', 'Ayatollah', 'seized', 'power', 'began', 'massacring', 'associated', 'deposed', 'Shah.Iran', 'Shah', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'liberal', 'tolerant', 'open', 'societies', 'Muslim', 'world', 'especially', 'regards', 'rights', 'women', 'were', 'par', 'enjoyed', 'women', 'West.After', 'Islamist', 'took', 'power', '1979', 'personal', 'issues', 'morality', 'faith', 'became', 'criminalized', 'women', 'were', 'turned', 'dehumanized', 'chattels', 'Islamic', 'police', 'monitor', 'activities', 'females', 'houses', 'Women', 'are', 'arrested', 'being', 'lax', 'Islamic', 'dress', 'codes', 'being', 'man', 'other', 'husband', 'relative', 'Childhood', 'females', 'ends', 'eyes', 'regime', 'cruel', 'laws', 'nine', 'opposed', 'male', 'fifteen', 'girl', 'children', 'age', 'are', 'judged', 'as', 'punished', 'adults', 'executed', 'sexual', 'activity', 'wearing', ""'immodest"", 'clothes', 'even', 'being', 'raped', 'tale', 'two', 'women', 'tragic', 'one', 'degradation', 'lives', 'one', 'can', 'detect', 'two', 'beautiful', 'souls', 'Living', 'society', 'human', 'spirit', 'where', 'cruelty', 'despotism', 'are', 'order', 'dayshame', 'West', 'allowing', 'regime', 'come', 'power', 'Left', 'West', 'elsewhere', 'supporting', 'tis', 'regime', 'day']",N/A

Because it is a microcosm of the entire society, and can't be thought of the entire story of all Iranian women in general. I personally know and have worked with Iranian women who still have family in Iran. America has it's stories of female abuse as well, it's just that American women have far more choices in life and far more resources to help them -- thankfully.Okay, let the hate toward my review begin:This could be the story of American Black Muslims, White Nationalist, Far-Right Christians, Mormons (sister-wife ring a bell), as well as many others, given enough leave-way and left on their own without supervision. If you look closely at these groups, you will see what they really believe the role of the woman should be. They believe that women to should stay at home, have children, and allow men to lead. Most hate perceived feminist (or Fema-Nazis as they are called by hate-radio). BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AND LISTEN VERY CLOSELY, OR YOU MIGHT MISS IT.Let's talk about the ""good old days."" Perhaps we have all forgotten that over 100 years ago in America and elsewhere, women could NOT vote, and were considered property. In the 1800's and earlier, 12 year old girls could and did get married legally, and others were prostitutes in the Old West. This is why we had to create laws regarding legal marriage age, statutory rape and such. In England, there were documented 100 year old hospital records of 14 year old girls pregnant by their own fathers (still happens today), so let's not get some ""wow, sure are glad we aren't those people"" attitude. WE ARE THOSE PEOPLE!I believe our fore-fathers created ""separation of church and state"" for this very reason.

I know that Iran is run by a fundamentalist Islamist government but I was still shocked by the desperation portrayed in this documentary which examines the lives of two women on society's fringes. Fariba is the mother of a young three or four-year-old boy and Mina is the young mother of a baby girl. Both women's husbands are not in the picture due to being incarcerated in prison for drug-related offences. The documentarian, an Iranian woman who left Iran after the revolution that deposed the Shah and has since settled in Sweden, takes a close, unflinching look at the lives of these two women as they struggle to eke out a living in a society where male and female roles are strictly mapped out under Sharia law.Fariba and Mina live in terrible conditions and their situation is desperate. Both women are drug addicts and prostitute themselves for a living, and some of the most disturbing scenes are those where the women take their children with them when they go with clients. I could not imagine the level of desperation these women must feel to place their children in such dangerous situations.There are also scenes involving drug use where both women are taking drugs in front of their young children. The children are there inhaling the fumes and going around their moms - it is just heartbreaking to see. The film also shows some of the cultural practices in Iran such as the ""sighe"", a marriage-like alliance between a man and woman, except that it is temporary, lasting between a couple of hours to a couple of months, depending on the man's wishes. Apparently, girls as young as nine can be taken on as temporary wives or ""sighes"". In the documentary, a street fortune teller, a 65-year-old man by the name of Habib casually requests one of his young clients, a 17-year-old runaway to become his sighe. She agrees and the deed is done quickly and without any witnesses, except for the mullah (religious official) performing the deed.This brought another societal problem to the forefront, that of young female runaways who leave their villages for the cities hoping for a better life and end up in abusive and dangerous situations, often resorting to prostitution or temporary marriages to live. It is a desperate and horrible situation and the documentary captures the evils of a society where fundamentalism rules, where the victims are women who are marginalized to the point where there is no refuge for them and no real hope of a better life.",4,Insightful and harrowing documentary on the plight of marginalized women in Iran,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,2566,"['knowledge', 'Iran', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'country', ""'ve"", 'never', 'visited', 'know', 'Iran', 'run', 'fundamentalist', 'Islamist', 'government', 'was', 'still', 'shocked', 'desperation', 'portrayed', 'documentary', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'society', 'fringes', 'Fariba', 'mother', 'young', 'three', 'four-year-old', 'boy', 'Mina', 'young', 'mother', 'baby', 'girl', 'women', 'husbands', 'are', 'not', 'picture', 'due', 'being', 'incarcerated', 'prison', 'drug-related', 'offences', 'documentarian', 'Iranian', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'Iran', 'revolution', 'deposed', 'Shah', 'settled', 'Sweden', 'close', 'unflinching', 'look', 'lives', 'two', 'women', 'struggle', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'society', 'where', 'male', 'female', 'roles', 'are', 'strictly', 'mapped', 'out', 'Sharia', 'law.Fariba', 'Mina', 'live', 'terrible', 'conditions', 'situation', 'desperate', 'women', 'are', 'drug', 'addicts', 'prostitute', 'living', 'most', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'are', 'where', 'women', 'take', 'children', 'when', 'go', 'clients', 'could', 'not', 'imagine', 'level', 'desperation', 'women', 'must', 'feel', 'place', 'children', 'such', 'dangerous', 'situations.There', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'involving', 'drug', 'use', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'taking', 'drugs', 'front', 'young', 'children', 'children', 'are', 'there', 'inhaling', 'fumes', 'going', 'moms', 'just', 'heartbreaking', 'see', 'film', 'also', 'cultural', 'practices', 'Iran', 'such', 'sighe', 'marriage-like', 'alliance', 'man', 'woman', 'temporary', 'lasting', 'couple', 'hours', 'couple', 'months', 'depending', 'man', 'wishes', 'Apparently', 'girls', 'as', 'young', 'nine', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'temporary', 'wives', 'sighes', 'documentary', 'street', 'fortune', 'teller', '65-year-old', 'man', 'name', 'Habib', 'casually', 'one', 'young', 'clients', '17-year-old', 'runaway', 'become', 'sighe', 'deed', 'done', 'quickly', 'witnesses', 'mullah', 'religious', 'official', 'performing', 'deed.This', 'brought', 'societal', 'problem', 'forefront', 'young', 'female', 'runaways', 'who', 'leave', 'villages', 'cities', 'hoping', 'better', 'life', 'end', 'up', 'abusive', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'often', 'resorting', 'prostitution', 'temporary', 'marriages', 'live', 'desperate', 'horrible', 'situation', 'documentary', 'evils', 'society', 'where', 'fundamentalism', 'rules', 'where', 'victims', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'marginalized', 'point', 'where', 'refuge', 'real', 'hope', 'better', 'life']",N/A
