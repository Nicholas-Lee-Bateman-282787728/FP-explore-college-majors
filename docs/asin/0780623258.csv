Crystal is his usual competent self in a role obviously written with him in mind.  In his film debut, Muresan brings an affable presence in his role as a 7 1/2 ft. giant Crystal stumbles on while visiting his current client in Romania.  The young actor (Rider Strong) fires Crystal and Crystal decides to put the rather naive giant into the same movie.  Muresan agrees only to find the love his youth who now lives in Galloop, USA.  (Gallup, New Mexico).  A subplot involves Crystal's failed marriage with Kathleen Quinlan (who doesn't get to do a whole lot, but is always watchable).  Martial arts star Steven Segal plays himself, and Joanna Pacula appears as the rather disappointing love of Muresan's life.  Hokey and often trite, MY GIANT is fun to watch because of its two stars.",3,BIG STAR ON THE HORIZON,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,959,"['relationship', 'self-centered', 'agent', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'real-life', 'NBA', 'star', 'Gheorghe', 'Muresan', 'main', 'reason', 'watch', 'otherwise', 'sentimental', 'few', 'laughs', 'comedy', 'Crystal', 'usual', 'competent', 'self', 'role', 'obviously', 'written', 'mind', 'film', 'debut', 'Muresan', 'affable', 'presence', 'role', '7', '1/2', 'ft.', 'giant', 'Crystal', 'stumbles', 'visiting', 'current', 'client', 'Romania', 'young', 'actor', 'Rider', 'Strong', 'Crystal', 'Crystal', 'put', 'rather', 'naive', 'giant', 'same', 'movie', 'Muresan', 'only', 'find', 'love', 'youth', 'who', 'now', 'Galloop', 'USA', 'Gallup', 'New', 'Mexico', 'subplot', 'Crystal', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'whole', 'lot', 'always', 'watchable', 'Martial', 'arts', 'star', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Joanna', 'Pacula', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'love', 'Muresan', 'life', 'Hokey', 'often', 'trite', 'MY', 'GIANT', 'fun', 'watch', 'two', 'stars']",N/A

And there are actually a fair amount  of laughs along the way.It helps to know that this picture was inspired  by the late Andre the Giant, who worked with Crystal on &quot;The Princess  Bride.&quot; Giants' lives are never easy, and that's why this picture has  to be serious as well as fun.I have the feeling this picture may play  better on video.
