All characters were done great, well developed and some were very charming. The plot of the story is interesting and reminded me of some other fairy tales. Voice acting is really good and witty humor in some places just makes the story and characters look even better. The soundtrack is just fine and the animation is not short in duration, which I liked and was right for the animation. It isn't too short and isn't too long. However, I would still probably enjoy it if the animation was even longer in time. The story goes in depth and is really interesting. The created world is also very beautiful. I didn't make the wrong choice and was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was created. This is the animation that must stand among my favorite animations on my shelf.

1405825,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,B004G6009K,"A Conrad ""Ask Conrad""","[5, 6]","I enjoyed growing up with the musical scores of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman in Disney movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.  The songs were fun and memorable, I still remember the lyrics, and I occasionally watch these movies on DVD with my family.  Menken wrote and produced the music and songs in ""Tangled,"" and I eagerly yet cautiosly anticipated watching the movie.  I really did not know what to expect from this movie (nor did I have high expectations), yet I found Disney's version of ""Tangled"" to be quite enjoyable, and I would rank it one of my new favorites from the newer Disney movie repertoire that includes The Princess and the Frog, Cars, and the Toy Story trilogy.  My wife, daughter, and I were pleasantly surprised with the storyline, and thoroughly enjoyed the move in 3D.  It is based on the classic story ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, but with a twist.In this version Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kept isolated in a hidden tower by her mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) under the guise of protecting her naivet&eacute; from the wickedness of the world.  Her real motive is basic yet excessive egotism.  Although Rapunzel follows her mother's wishes to stay safe and secure up in her tower, she is not the clich&eacute; ""damsel in distress"" and is able to hold her own.  Having lived most of her life locked away, she is also highly curious about the outside world.  Along comes the handsome, charming and witty Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and gives her the opportunity of a lifetime.  Fed up with her sheltered life, and with the battle cry of ""carpe diem,"" she convinces Rider to assist her with realizing her dream.What did I like about it?  To preface, I am a bit sick of the whole ""prince looking to save his princess"" or ""princess looking for her prince charming.""  Yes, this movie involves a princess, but not in the typical/traditional way one would expect.  It does not involve a prince saving the princess or a frog turning into a prince.  The story hinges on our heroine and her curiosity of a mystical and magical event from a land nearby.  She does not want to find her prince charming or be saved by one, nor does she want to kiss a frog (though she has a chameleon sidekick, which I thought was a cute alternative).  She does not need assistance with getting down from the tower.  And the hero is not out to save the princess, has a somewhat charming egocentric quality who is out only for himself, and only accidentally stumbled into her presence.Absotely loved the animation!  I saw both normal and 3D versions (in that order), was thoroughly impressed with the animation in 2D, and was completely blown away in 3D!  This is not your standard Mickey Mouse animation in Fantasia.  All stops were pulled for this movie.  I didn't find the colors nor the story to be dark.  The ending was a bit violent (IMHO), though relative to the movies today I suppose it is not far from the norm.  My daughter closed her eyes through a few of the scenes, but she still loved the movie.The movie has lots of singing and dancing, and stunning animation effects (especially in 3D).  It has a nice story for the kids and a pleasant plot for the older kids.  In summary, we utterly and totally loved ""Tangled.""  Highly recommend for the young and young-at-heart.Note:  This review is for the movie.

1405826,A276WKUGQB1MZ0,B004G6009K,Adam C Kuykendall,"[0, 0]","My wife and our three year old daughter sat down to enjoy this film, and I can actually say that the three year old sat through almost the entire film glued to the screen (and the popcorn).  Tangled is quite enjoyable.  The plot and characters are all wonderfully portrayed and can engage a wide age range and sophistication of various audience members.  Though the songs are all great fun, none of them will necessarily stick in your head.  They service the narrative more than lyrical.The only negative I can really point out, which is near impossible to avoid with most fairy tales and is at the very heart of this well known classic, is the inherent mother issues.  Not sure how you can avoid the evil-mother archetype grounded in this particular story, amongst others, but it shouldn't be ignored.  Depending on your child's age and comprehension level it might be something worth discussing with them.  Let them know that their own mother isn't out to steal their youth to remain young forever.  I may be being oversensitive here but Disney is riddled with characters that walk a thin line with regard to stereotypes, most prevalently in their female ones: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, etc.With all that warning aside, Tangled has an excellent female lead who, though they've been sheltered and left in a tower most of their life, can assert herself and take control of her destiny and become whatever she dreams.  That's a role model I can get behind and hopefully so can my daughter.",4,A Good Hair Day,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1507,"['wife', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'sat', 'down', 'enjoy', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'say', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'sat', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', 'glued', 'screen', 'popcorn', 'Tangled', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'can', 'engage', 'wide', 'age', 'range', 'sophistication', 'various', 'audience', 'members', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'none', 'will', 'necessarily', 'stick', 'head', 'service', 'narrative', 'more', 'lyrical.The', 'only', 'negative', 'can', 'really', 'point', 'out', 'impossible', 'avoid', 'most', 'fairy', 'tales', 'very', 'heart', 'well', 'known', 'classic', 'inherent', 'mother', 'issues', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'can', 'avoid', 'evil-mother', 'archetype', 'grounded', 'particular', 'story', 'amongst', 'others', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'Depending', 'child', 'age', 'comprehension', 'level', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'worth', 'discussing', 'Let', 'know', 'own', 'mother', ""n't"", 'out', 'steal', 'youth', 'remain', 'young', 'forever', 'may', 'be', 'being', 'oversensitive', 'here', 'Disney', 'riddled', 'characters', 'walk', 'thin', 'line', 'regard', 'stereotypes', 'most', 'prevalently', 'female', 'ones', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Cinderella', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'etc.With', 'warning', 'aside', 'Tangled', 'excellent', 'female', 'lead', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sheltered', 'left', 'tower', 'most', 'life', 'can', 'assert', 'take', 'control', 'destiny', 'become', 'role', 'model', 'can', 'get', 'hopefully', 'so', 'can', 'daughter']",N/A

Or, at least, that's what I'm rediscovering now that my girls are getting at the age of watching a film all the way through. While ""Tangled"" doesn't surpass ""Toy Story 3,"" it comes in a close second. Especially among the animated fare this year. Super-cute Repunzel is a welcome princess to join the ranks of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Belle, Ariel, Tiana, Jasmine, Mulan and Pocahontas (can't you tell I have two young daughters?). There's plenty of romance for the girls, action for the boys and laughs for everyone! The music is OK (not as good as ""Princess and the Frog""), but the film itself has a lot of heart. Also, Donna Murphy (who some might remember as the wife of Dr. Otto Octavious (Alfred Molina) inSpider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)) is excellent as the newest villain, Mother Gothel. I did see this in 3-D (which I'm not too crazy about) and it was great, especially with my daughter reaching out for the floating lanterns.

We had a great time among three generations: grandparents, parents, and 11-year old.  The audience was mostly families with younger kids, which was a mistake for some.  At least one family with two kids under 6 left a half hour into the movie and didn't come back.  Many parents might hear ""Disney"" and  not notice that the film is rated PG.  It gets that rating for a good reason, with some creepiness that may resonate more on an adult level (Mother Gothel kidnapping Rapunzel and their weird faux-mother-innocent-daughter interactions) but also some cartoon violence that comes across as scary on a little kid level.  When Flynn and Rapunzel venture into the tavern ""The Snuggly Duckling"" they meet a cast of scary-funny rogues like you haven't seen since ""The Poison Apple"" in ""Shrek.""For ages ten and up (or a little younger if the idea of ""intense"" doesn't worry you), it's raucous fun with an almost Monty-Python-esque twist at some times; Indiana Jones action at others;  and romance reminiscent of the ""Kiss the Girl"" scene in ""The Little Mermaid.""Rapunzel and Flynn were winning characters, and you'll be treated to the funniest horse I've ever seen on film.  The backstory of the King and Queen losing their baby princess stayed mainly in the background, but added a lot of emotional weight threaded through the story.You see the Pixar storytelling fingerprints all over this Disney film, with animation legend John Lasseter producing, and that's a GREAT thing.

Yes, `Tangled' is bursting at the seams with love, danger, charm and MUSIC!  With infectious songs that swell in the heart, `Tangled' revisits the days of old, the days when Disney made us feel all warm and cuddly on the inside.`Tangled' makes my heart feel super happy.Taking the classic story of Rapunzel and giving it a facelift, `Tangled' tells the poetic tale of a beautiful young princess named Rapunzel who is kidnapped and locked away in a hidden tower by the evil Mother Gothel, a woman who uses Rapunzel's magical golden hair to stay young forever.  Over the years, Rapunzel dreamed of leaving the tower, hoping to see the beautiful lanterns the filled the sky every year on her birthday, but her mother (err, abductor) refused to let her leave, stating that her hair was too valuable and that outsiders would try to take advantage of her.  Remaining in the tower at all times was her only protection from the evils of the outside world.  Rapunzel's whole world is turned upside down the day she meets the thief, Flynn Rider.  Fresh off of stealing a royal crown, Flynn winds up hiding out in the tucked away tower that houses our young princess, and with a little persuasion, Rapunzel is able to get Flynn to agree to take her to see the lanterns.  Obstacles abound and life lessons are learned, with spunk and charm and a whole lot of beauty dripping from every frame (OMG this movie is a CGI dreamsticle).While the overall lay of the plot may be a bit conventional (especially concerning the `love' story angle), there is so much excitement to be found in this animated gem that one can't help but fall in love with it.  The voice work is astonishing (YES, THEY CAN ALL SING) and the emotional connection is certainly felt.  Happy endings are what Disney was made for, and they deliver a magical one that will make anyone smile.  Each scene is laid out with the viewer in mind, creating gorgeous backdrops to plop our cast of characters in, and each character certainly has a life all their own; even Maximus the horse.A true crowd pleasure, and every little girls dream (my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie), `Tangled' is a true return to form for Disney; a modern masterpiece of animated proportions.At last, I see the light!:-D",5,The magic of Disney...,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,2488,"['wonderful', 'thing', 'Tangled', 'instantly', 'mind', 'glory', 'days', 'Disney', 'years', 'followed', 'glorious', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'led', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'two', 'greatest', 'animated', 'films', 'time', 'Yes', 'Tangled', 'bursting', 'seams', 'love', 'danger', 'charm', 'MUSIC', 'infectious', 'songs', 'swell', 'heart', 'Tangled', 'days', 'old', 'days', 'when', 'Disney', 'made', 'feel', 'warm', 'cuddly', 'inside.', 'Tangled', 'heart', 'feel', 'super', 'happy.Taking', 'classic', 'story', 'Rapunzel', 'giving', 'facelift', 'Tangled', 'poetic', 'tale', 'beautiful', 'young', 'princess', 'named', 'Rapunzel', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'locked', 'away', 'hidden', 'tower', 'evil', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'woman', 'who', 'Rapunzel', 'magical', 'golden', 'hair', 'stay', 'young', 'forever', 'years', 'Rapunzel', 'dreamed', 'leaving', 'tower', 'hoping', 'see', 'beautiful', 'filled', 'sky', 'year', 'birthday', 'mother', 'err', 'abductor', 'refused', 'let', 'leave', 'stating', 'hair', 'was', 'too', 'valuable', 'outsiders', 'would', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'Remaining', 'tower', 'times', 'was', 'only', 'protection', 'evils', 'outside', 'world', 'Rapunzel', 'whole', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'day', 'thief', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'Fresh', 'stealing', 'royal', 'crown', 'Flynn', 'up', 'hiding', 'out', 'tucked', 'away', 'tower', 'houses', 'young', 'princess', 'little', 'persuasion', 'Rapunzel', 'able', 'get', 'Flynn', 'agree', 'take', 'see', 'lanterns', 'Obstacles', 'life', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'spunk', 'charm', 'whole', 'lot', 'beauty', 'dripping', 'frame', 'OMG', 'movie', 'CGI', 'dreamsticle', 'overall', 'lay', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'conventional', 'especially', 'concerning', 'love', 'story', 'angle', 'so', 'much', 'excitement', 'be', 'found', 'animated', 'gem', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'voice', 'work', 'astonishing', 'YES', 'THEY', 'CAN', 'ALL', 'SING', 'emotional', 'connection', 'certainly', 'felt', 'Happy', 'endings', 'are', 'what', 'Disney', 'was', 'made', 'deliver', 'magical', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'smile', 'scene', 'laid', 'out', 'viewer', 'mind', 'creating', 'gorgeous', 'backdrops', 'plop', 'cast', 'characters', 'character', 'certainly', 'life', 'own', 'even', 'Maximus', 'horse.A', 'true', 'crowd', 'pleasure', 'little', 'girls', 'dream', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'LOVES', 'movie', 'Tangled', 'true', 'return', 'form', 'Disney', 'modern', 'masterpiece', 'animated', 'proportions.At', 'last', 'see', 'light', '-D']",N/A

1405867,A2VT7D4E6NR97Y,B004G6009K,Anonymous,"[7, 9]","When I saw the first advertisement for this film, I was a bit turned off because it looked like one of those twisted alternate fairy tale movies; where something goes wrong that's totally unexpected and hilarity (or just plain wrongness) ensues.  The title change was a bit of a turnoff for me at first too.  But as I did some research on the film and started seeing the previews, I started to think that maybe I was wrong.  I also came to forgive the title change because I realized that judging a film by its title is just like judging a book by its cover.  And because I found out that they did that because they wanted a title that represented both main characters, not just the female lead.  I was also pleased to find that the company was now trying to market more towards boys; which as a man, I appreciate.  After all, the princesses have been getting all the attention for years.  Let the heroes have some!Right, so anyhue...Not only did the movie have some real catchy songs, memorable characters, and parts that were absolutely hilarious; but despite a few changes, the movie's basic plot remained mostly true to the original story.  I don't want to spoil any of it though.  If there was one thing I didn't like, it was seeing the short old guy traipsing around in his underwear.  Although there was a scene later on where he made me laugh.Another great thing about this movie is that in most CGI films there are 2 things you don't see being animated since it apparently takes a lot of work: hair and bare feet.  But Disney stepped up to the challenge and did an excellent job animating both of those things.  You never even see characters doing so much as combing their hair in most CGI movies, whereas Rapunzel's hair... well, need I say more?  CGI movie characters also have shoes on all the time and in the extremely rare cases when they don't, you don't see much of their feet (not that that's necessarily a bad thing).  Rapunzel on the other hand, is always barefoot in the movie and her feet are almost always visible.  Just a little side note: Quentin Tarintino apparently said that Tangled was one of his favorite films of all time.  Hmm... I wonder why that is.  Anyway, all that just goes to show what a better job Disney does when it comes to animation.In conclusion, Tangled has turned out to become an outstanding movie; which I can't wait to own on DVD.  Oh, but that brings me to one more tiny little thing I didn't like about the movie: it was released in theaters in November, so it couldn't be released on DVD in time for Christmas.",5,Vastly underestimated,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2562,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'advertisement', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'turned', 'off', 'looked', 'one', 'twisted', 'alternate', 'fairy', 'tale', 'movies', 'where', 'something', 'wrong', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'hilarity', 'just', 'plain', 'wrongness', 'title', 'change', 'was', 'bit', 'turnoff', 'first', 'too', 'did', 'research', 'film', 'started', 'seeing', 'previews', 'started', 'think', 'maybe', 'was', 'wrong', 'also', 'came', 'forgive', 'title', 'change', 'realized', 'judging', 'film', 'title', 'just', 'judging', 'book', 'cover', 'found', 'out', 'did', 'wanted', 'title', 'represented', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'also', 'pleased', 'find', 'company', 'was', 'now', 'trying', 'market', 'more', 'towards', 'boys', 'man', 'appreciate', 'princesses', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'attention', 'years', 'Let', 'heroes', 'have', 'Right', 'so', 'anyhue', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'movie', 'have', 'real', 'catchy', 'songs', 'memorable', 'characters', 'parts', 'were', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'few', 'changes', 'movie', 'basic', 'plot', 'remained', 'mostly', 'true', 'original', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'seeing', 'short', 'old', 'guy', 'traipsing', 'around', 'underwear', 'was', 'scene', 'later', 'where', 'made', 'laugh.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'most', 'CGI', 'films', 'are', '2', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'animated', 'apparently', 'lot', 'work', 'hair', 'bare', 'feet', 'Disney', 'stepped', 'up', 'challenge', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'animating', 'things', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'characters', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'combing', 'hair', 'most', 'CGI', 'movies', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'well', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'CGI', 'movie', 'characters', 'also', 'have', 'shoes', 'time', 'extremely', 'rare', 'cases', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'feet', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'Rapunzel', 'other', 'hand', 'always', 'barefoot', 'movie', 'feet', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'visible', 'Just', 'little', 'side', 'note', 'Quentin', 'Tarintino', 'apparently', 'said', 'Tangled', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'Hmm', 'wonder', 'why', 'Anyway', 'just', 'show', 'what', 'better', 'job', 'Disney', 'when', 'animation.In', 'conclusion', 'Tangled', 'turned', 'out', 'become', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'own', 'DVD', 'Oh', 'one', 'more', 'tiny', 'little', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'November', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'time', 'Christmas']",N/A

Eugene Sebastian. Flynn is extremely entertaining, both to young kids and adults.  One can't help but crack up at Flynn's ""Smoulder"" or his conversations with Rapunzel that often go like this:Rapunzel: ""Something brought you here...fate...destiny...""Flynn: ""A horse.""Rapunzel is good too - the filmmakers found a mix of damsel-in-distress and action heroine that works. The antagonist role is filled by Mother Gothel - a ample villain without that air of menace that ruined childhoods, unlike almost any character in Pinocchio or The Black Cauldron. I particularly liked the Stabbington Brothers - two thugs (Ron Perlman) double-crossed by Flynn.But Tangled's biggest success is one that no one ever notices.Tangled is a movie about a girl with 70-foot long hair. Therefore, the movie will succeed or fail ON THE HAIR ALONE. If the hair was animated badly - if it looked fake, then the entire film would be lost.Yet no one ever mentions the hair - it looks so lifelike, so beautiful. The CGI, which animator Kelly Ward spent 6 years designing, is so good - so lifelike, it looks almost like an oil-painting. The whole film is visually beautiful.No one ever talks about a movie ""with good hair"", but if there ever was one, it would be Tangled.Quirky, memorable characters, rousing, hilarious, musical numbers, gorgeous, lush, animation, and clean, witty, hilarious humour boost Tangled to one of Disney's most entertaining films, even if it's not the most memorable or groundbreaking of family features.5 Stars for Tangled - a fun, enjoyable, hilarious comedy for the whole family!",4,"Entertaining, Colourful, Original, FUN!",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,1936,"['Disney', 'made', 'great', 'films', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Lion', 'King', 'lot', 'good', 'films', 'Mulan', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'bad', 'films', 'Black', 'Cauldron', '.Tangled', ""n't"", 'great', 'wo', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'cartoon', 'immortality', 'Snow', 'White', 'boy', 'hilarious', 'first', 'reason', 'are', 'characters', 'namely', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'a.k.a', 'Eugene', 'Sebastian', 'Flynn', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'young', 'kids', 'adults', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'crack', 'up', 'Flynn', 'Smoulder', 'conversations', 'Rapunzel', 'often', 'go', 'Rapunzel', 'Something', 'brought', 'here', 'fate', 'destiny', 'Flynn', 'horse', 'Rapunzel', 'good', 'too', 'filmmakers', 'found', 'mix', 'damsel-in-distress', 'action', 'heroine', 'antagonist', 'role', 'filled', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'ample', 'villain', 'air', 'menace', 'ruined', 'childhoods', 'almost', 'character', 'Pinocchio', 'Black', 'Cauldron', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Stabbington', 'Brothers', 'two', 'thugs', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'double-crossed', 'Flynn.But', 'Tangled', 'biggest', 'success', 'one', 'one', 'ever', 'notices.Tangled', 'movie', 'girl', '70-foot', 'long', 'hair', 'Therefore', 'movie', 'will', 'succeed', 'fail', 'THE', 'HAIR', 'ALONE', 'hair', 'was', 'animated', 'badly', 'looked', 'fake', 'then', 'entire', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'lost.Yet', 'one', 'ever', 'hair', 'so', 'lifelike', 'so', 'beautiful', 'CGI', 'animator', 'Kelly', 'Ward', 'spent', '6', 'years', 'designing', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'almost', 'oil-painting', 'whole', 'film', 'visually', 'beautiful.No', 'one', 'ever', 'movie', 'good', 'hair', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'Tangled.Quirky', 'memorable', 'characters', 'rousing', 'hilarious', 'musical', 'numbers', 'gorgeous', 'lush', 'animation', 'clean', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'humour', 'boost', 'Tangled', 'one', 'Disney', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', 'even', 'not', 'most', 'memorable', 'groundbreaking', 'family', 'features.5', 'Stars', 'Tangled', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

1405878,A3LPA9D5IOQ1XY,B004G6009K,Ashley Billings,"[1, 1]","Tangled is a animated comedy/musical film by produced by Disney and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.  It features the voice talents of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, Donna Murphy, Brad Garrett, as well as others.  The story is based on the old fairy tale, ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm.The movie takes place in a royal castle during medieval times with a little girl named Rapunzel(Mandy Moore), with magical golden hair that has healing powers and can restore youth.  An evil witch who is trying to stay young, Mother Gothel, (Donna Murphy) kidnaps the child and holds her captive in a remote, elevated tower.  Rapunzel grows up believing that Gothel is her mother and has never been outside the tower as a result of her ""mother"" telling her the world is filled with horrible dangers.  So Rapunzel has never known anyone else except her mother and her pet Chameleon Pascal.  Every year on her birthday, as Rapunzel looks out her window, she can't help but notice an arrangement of floating lights hovering in the sky, and she can't help but feel as if the lights are meant for her.  So on her 18th birthday she plans to ask her mother to leave the tower and head for the mysterious floating lights and find out what they are.  Her mother forbids it, so Rapunzel comes up with a plan, she asks for a special kind of paint that's 3 days journey away, after which Rapunzel plans to leave the tower.  As all this is happening, we meet the narrator of the story, Flynn Rider, (Zachary Levi) a hotshot thief who had stolen a tiara from the royal castle, on the run from the castle guards, and a hyperactive horse named Maximus, he takes refuge in the same tower that holds Rapunzel.  Rapunzel frightened, knocks him out with of all things a frying pan and ties him up, she hides the tiara and when he awakes she tells him that if he agrees to take her the floating lights she will reveal the location of the tiara, he accepts, and the two set off on an adventure to the castle, all the while trying to avoid Mother Gothel, Maximus the Horse, and two old partners of Flynn who also want the tiara.  The two go through many crazy experiences meeting friends and foes as Rapunzel learns what the outside world is like and learns what love is as well.I was very impressed with the animation in this movie, everything seems to go together, it has bright, vibrant colors, and the special effects are beautiful and work with the movie.  I love the way they portrayed certain characters, the chameleon, Pascal, is sooo cute and is always doing silly gestures towards Flynn, although he can't speak you always know what he's trying to say, kids will love him.  I also love the way they depicted Flynn Rider, his funny faces and his eccentric personality really adds something great to the movie, he's a very likeable character, and finally, the horse Maximus, has to be my favorite.  He is a very determined horse who will stop at nothing to get his man.  The funniest thing about him is not how crazy he acts but the fact that he acts like a dog, he sniffs around on the ground, he growls, and even the characters in the movie treat him as a dog, (even saying things like ""good boy, you wanna play fetch"" and such) he's definitely the craziest character in the movie.Another thing I enjoyed in this movie was the fact that it's a musical, I grew up in the 90s when all the Disney movies had great songs to go along with them that you remembered all throughout your childhood and that is pretty much non-existent now.  Although I do love a lot of movies out nowadays I miss the musical aspect of children films.  Tangled has done a swell job of bringing that back into Disney Films and I don't know about the rest of the world, but I found that very gratifying.

For one thing, it never did get tangled, for all the title suggests. As someone whose hair was nowhere near that long when a week's worth of bed head was bad enough to cut it off, I find it very hard to believe that she was able to keep it so smooth and clean and healthy. Imagine what it must have been like to wash!Unfortunately, the movie does not explore these practical matters. What's more, her hair often seems to change in length, which is an inconsistency not common in Disney films. Still, the girl is undeniably pretty, even if she sounds far more 21st century than back in the ""once upon a time"" days. This is not particularly unusual for Disney princesses, however.Just in case anyone has missed the basic premise, a princess was born with long, magical golden hair. It could cure anything, including injuries and old age. She was therefore kidnapped by an old witch who kept her locked in a tower, claiming to be her mother who was protecting her from the mean old world outside, and using Rapunzel's hair to keep herself young.Rapunzel remembers nothing of her former life consciously, but some of it comes out in her painting, which she does all around the walls and ceiling of her tower chamber. But all she knows of the world outside is what she can see from her window. And one thing she can see is that on her birthday every year, thousands of glowing lights appear in the distance, all different colors and floating on the wind. Her mother says they are stars, bur Rapunzel is smart enough to know that they don't act like the stars do. She does not know it, but her royal parents have made a tradition of setting lamps like tiny hot air balloons adrift on her birthday, in her memory and in the hope that she may see them and know that they are calling to her.Of course there must be a handsome rescuer, but this time it is a thief who has just broken into the palace and stolen the crown which sat on an altar waiting for the return of the golden-haired princess. I doubt that he knows that story, or he would probably have known who Rapunzel was when he met her.In any case, the story is the traditional one with lots of amusing additions, including a little chameleon who is Rapunzel's pet. It's pretty and it's fun, but it's Disney, which means it's a pretty high sugar content for me.",4,"But Her Hair Never Gets Tangled, Only the Plot",1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2392,"['OK', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'magical', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'tangled', 'title', 'someone', 'hair', 'was', 'nowhere', 'long', 'when', 'week', 'worth', 'bed', 'head', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'cut', 'off', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'so', 'smooth', 'clean', 'healthy', 'Imagine', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'wash', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'not', 'explore', 'practical', 'matters', 'What', 'more', 'hair', 'often', 'change', 'length', 'inconsistency', 'not', 'common', 'Disney', 'films', 'Still', 'girl', 'undeniably', 'pretty', 'even', 'far', 'more', '21st', 'century', 'back', 'once', 'time', 'days', 'not', 'particularly', 'unusual', 'Disney', 'princesses', 'however.Just', 'case', 'anyone', 'missed', 'basic', 'premise', 'princess', 'was', 'born', 'long', 'magical', 'golden', 'hair', 'could', 'cure', 'anything', 'including', 'injuries', 'old', 'age', 'was', 'therefore', 'kidnapped', 'old', 'witch', 'who', 'kept', 'locked', 'tower', 'claiming', 'be', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'protecting', 'mean', 'old', 'world', 'using', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'keep', 'young.Rapunzel', 'remembers', 'nothing', 'former', 'life', 'consciously', 'out', 'painting', 'walls', 'ceiling', 'tower', 'chamber', 'world', 'outside', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'window', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'see', 'birthday', 'year', 'thousands', 'glowing', 'lights', 'appear', 'distance', 'different', 'colors', 'floating', 'wind', 'mother', 'are', 'stars', 'bur', 'Rapunzel', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'act', 'stars', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'royal', 'parents', 'have', 'made', 'tradition', 'setting', 'lamps', 'tiny', 'hot', 'air', 'balloons', 'adrift', 'birthday', 'memory', 'hope', 'may', 'see', 'know', 'are', 'calling', 'her.Of', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'handsome', 'rescuer', 'time', 'thief', 'who', 'just', 'broken', 'palace', 'stolen', 'crown', 'sat', 'altar', 'waiting', 'return', 'golden-haired', 'princess', 'doubt', 'story', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'known', 'who', 'Rapunzel', 'was', 'when', 'met', 'her.In', 'case', 'story', 'traditional', 'one', 'lots', 'amusing', 'additions', 'including', 'little', 'chameleon', 'who', 'Rapunzel', 'pet', 'pretty', 'fun', 'Disney', 'pretty', 'high', 'sugar', 'content']",N/A

But this movie leaves me no choice, as an Apostolic Pentecostal. This movie offended me, and my wife. I find it interesting that Disney, and most people today. Say that the hair means nothing, but that's not true. The Bible is very specific about a woman's hair, and I find it interesting that those who defend the short brown hair look. Over look the fact, that after that happens. Rapunzel is the one who asks Flynn to marry her, not the other way around. Which by the way, is a feminist view on things. I'll get comments for that. How dare the man be the one to ask, woman are equal to men. Said sarcastically, and yes. The mother figure, portrayed as being evil, is killed. But it's okay to disobey, because we don't believe in absolutes anymore. such as, an authority figure can't tell me what to do, I'm my own person.

The story has its ups and down, and is pretty simple overall, without quite as many twists and turns as even films like ""The Little Mermaid"". However, it does have enough body in the plot to interest viewers young and old. It also has both dramatic and humorous sections.Mandy Moore is quite believable as the voice of Rapunzel, and Zacary Levi (Chuck) does a wonderful job as the rogue she becomes involved with. A tavern scene provides wonderful short performances by the likes of Brad Garret and Ron Perlman. Max the animated horse almost steals the show.However, the real achievement of this movie is the gorgeous animation. Scenery is detailed and better than realistic. Faces are emotional and expressive. Action sequences are fluid and exciting, if of course entirely unbelievable. The imagination of the writers and animators was functioning at a very high level in this film. The floating lantern sequence is a truly unique and spectacular piece of film-making that should not be missed. Sequences involving the sun-flower and its latent effects are beautiful.Criticisms that the film sends the wrong message to youngsters concerning Rapunzel's desire to find freedom from her ""fake mother"" are ill thought and completely unfounded. She never desired to ""rebel"" and ""seek freedom"". Something was obviously wrong in the relationship and she could feel that.

I remember one of the animators saying, ""How do you animate 70 feet of hair?""Well, they did, & dd a magnificent job of it.And not just of her hair, but if the individual hairs in Flynn Ryder's beard, Mother Gothel's hair, as well as the hair on the various characters in the scene in the Snuggly Duckiling Tavern.And the detail!The individual characters in the town where Flynn took Rapunzel to see the lanterns, the launching of the lanterns from all around the kingdom, the individual movements of the thugs in the Snuggly Duckling, the blades of grass & the water, just after Rapunzel first set foot outside of the tower-it was all there!Never before in the history of animation had such incredible attention been paid to even the smallest detail in a movie-like the lace on the end of the sleeves of Rapunzel's dress.And then there was the voice casting, something Disney has always excelled at.Singer Mandy Moore, as Rapunzel, Zachary Levi as Flynn, Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel, Brad Garrett as Hook Hand, & Jeffery Tambor as Big Nose.Every single one of those voices and all the others were perfect for the characters.The music by Alan Menken, who has been with Disney, & was there when the new generation of Disney artists took over with the Little Mermaid.Everything that Disney does, is brilliantly designed to achieve the maximum enjoyment value.I remember, before the TANGLED came out, that the opinions from clips that had been released, were not all together positive.Many people were disappointed that Disney had called the movie TANGLED, instead of Rapunzel.Many thought that they story would be completely different & nothing like the story of Rapunzel that we ave all grown up with.These views were completely silenced when TANGLED did come out, however.Just as Disney set the standard for ink & pen animation, with Beauty & The Beast, so too, did they set the standard for CGI animation with Tangled-proving that they are the best!",5,Disney Does It

Loosely based on the story of Rapunzel, it stays a lighthearted adventure that doesn't insult anyone. Disney is very much on track these days putting out the types of movies we all enjoyed in the past that you could take the family to see and not worry about obnoxious characters that set bad examples. My wife and I enjoyed it and agreed to get it for the children, and the grandchildren to enjoy. If you like the classic Disney movies you will probably enjoy it.Spoiler alert:Rapunzel is kidnapped and kept in a tower so that she may keep an evil woman young with her magic hair. When a thief climbs into her tower trying to escape the law he learns it is not wise to enter without announcing themself. Rapunzel strikes a bargain with the thief to escape the tower and see the town. As the thief avoids the law he does his best to show Rapuzel what she has missed locked away in the tower. All good fun as they are chased and make new friends and become close to each other.

As it is, a lot of people are just groaning because it resembles so many past formulaic outings of Disney.But this one is particularly well-done.  There's a reason you keep seeing formulas in movies:  THEY WORK.

This was my attitude towards ""Tangled"".Also, the trailer looked cute, but would the movie really be more than just fluff? On the other hand, did the trailer truly reflect the feel of the movie? Take, for instance ""UP"" which was portrayed as a light-hearted and funny film in the trailers, and not the slightly scary and slightly dark film with mean pack dogs and a villain trying to kill a cute, small kid.But, as the mother of a 7 year old girl who was dying to see it, I gave in, and we saw it. And, I'm happy to say. I loved it, and so did my 7 year old and my 12 year old girl. It was charming and funny and had just the right variety of characters - light and dark - to make it interesting without being too scary, as well as, just the right amount of action versus mushy scenes to make it enjoyable, not too fast moving to be impossible to keep up with, and not so slow to wonder when it would end. We loved the songs, the silliness, Rapunzel, Flynn, the king's horse out to get them both, Rapunzel's strength and building realization of who she was. Also, there were no adult-humor hidden inuendos (like in Shrek and other not-G-rated movies that really are not for kids).We loved it. It would be hard to beat the magic of The Little Mermaid, which was hard to beat till Beauty and the Beast came along.

Velasquez,"[2, 2]","Beautiful Rapunzel's story is as old as I can remember, and it's almost impossible not to think about her every time you see a girl with extremely long hair. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the creative minds at Disney adapted it into an animated movie, the result being the delightful and very entertaining ""Tangled.""The story revolves around a magical flower that has healing powers, something that a lady named Mother Gothel has known for years. She knew the location of the flower in the wild, and used it for years to prevent aging and keep herself young and beautiful. However, one day the Queen, who was pregnant, became ill, and the King, knowing about the plant, sent his soldiers to search for it. They eventually find it and the flower's power cured her and she was able to give birth to Princess Rapunzel. Because Rapunzel's hair was golden like the flower, Mother Gothel realized that the baby's hair would also keep her young. So she decides to kidnap Rapunzel one night and take her to the tall tower where she lives. Time passes and the Princess grows up alone in that tower, thinking that Mother Gothel was her mother. She was not allowed to step out of the tower, so that she could not discover the truth. Enter Flynn Rider, a handsome thief, who has a charm of his own. He will be the key to Rapunzel's freedom.As every Disney movie, ""Tangled"" is full of fun characters that create hilarious situations. It is very colorful in every sense of the word. Never mind, of course, about the thief-princess formula. Disney always finds a way to keep the story fresh and engaging. This is fun for all family. The remarkable two-disc Blu-ray / DVD edition includes deleted scenes, a making-of feature, storyboard openings, and much more.

The Disney princess has gone from demure, subservient beauty to confident, robust and  self realizing beauty. No longer will Rapunzel hide in the corner when an uninvited intruder scales her tower and climbs through her window. Instead, she repeatedly knocks him unconscious with an iron skillet, locks him in a closet, ties him up with her hair in a chair, interrogation style, and then forces him to agree to a deal. In the process, she directly contradicts her faux mother's deepest fears and warnings about leaving the tower. Nope, this is not your 20th century Disney princess. Its the 21st century Disney princess. This is one tough young woman who sets her own destiny, although not without deep-felt feelings of ambiguity and guilt about disobeying mother's orders (albeit a faux mother who definitely does not have the best interests of the young Rapunzel in mind).For the lesser sex (aka, male homo sapiens), sit up and learn a few lessons. In spite of the  string of garbage you have consumed from Pixar for the last 12 or so years, the modern world is  not a series of testosterone-laden misadventures. Nope, to compete in this world, you had better learn to value and depend on Rapunzel's golden fleece as Flynn Rider does throughout this movie, particularly during the action sequences. In fact, you are only a secondary player in life.It is fortunate that Disney chose Tangled, its 50th animated feature, to stay relevant. This film will likely go down as its greatest triumph, much better than those male-dominated also rans, such as the Lion King or Alladin. The visuals are strikingly gorgeous, perhaps even better than Miyazaki. It uses a rich cadre of characters and formats to present the content, including slapstick, mime, melodrama, Broadway musical, action, occasional Faustian undercurrents, and so forth. It pulls all the right emotional strings, supported by a wonderful musical score.

I've watched approximately 20 of them such as Snow White, Wall-e, Lion King, Finding Nemo, Mulan, Dumbo, etc. Tangled is the only one that I bought a copy of its DVD because I love it so much. The reasons why are listed below.- The face movements of the main characters such as the horse and Flynn and are lively and so human-like that they captivate me. For example when the horse was angry with Flynn, it frowned its face just like a man! It's hilarious and fascinating. Or when Flynn tried to convince Rapunzel to give him back the the tiara, he raised one of his eybrows and half-closed his eyes. The facial expression was just like that of a man who's trying to come up with a trick.- There are a lot of humour.- Most of the time, the color are bright and beautiful. It does birghten up my mood.- The animals do not speak human language. This feature makes this film more suitable for adults like me.- There are two scenes that touch my heart the most.

1405943,A32LY2NXFZD2J7,B004G6009K,chris,"[0, 0]","Disney comes with a fresh look for their standard princess film, and a modern twist on the classic Rapunzel. It is enjoyable for kids and adults alike. It was refreshing that Disney has broken off from the stereotypical helpless princess character. Instead of a silly girl who ends up marrying a prince because he saves her, we have a real relationship that forms through teamwork. We really feel like these two care about each other as a person. And best of all, the 'princess' does some of the saving as well. Certainly Shrek beat Disney to the punch here, and the parallels on the ""modern princess story"" are obvious, but other than the character dynamics there is no copying going on.The protagonist and the antagonist are excitedly complex in this film, for a kid flick. We have a hero who doesn't really want to be a hero. A victim of neglect and abuse breaking from her bonds. The villain, a witch, isn't really an evil person at the core. She has lived for centuries by using a magic flower, which is then stolen by the kingdom and destroyed to heal the dying queen. She tries to take just a cutting of the princesses hair for her use, to keep herself alive, and only kidnaps the girl out of desperation. These characters aren't the black and white cardboard cutouts that we are used to from Snow White and Cinderella. The King, a desperate man trying to save his family, is unwittingly dooming another to death and selfishly uses a miracle healing flower for his own instead of sharing it with his kingdom.

1405951,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B004G6009K,Craig MACKINNON,"[1, 5]","Tangled is the 50th film produced by Walt Disney's animation studio (for clarity, that number does not include joint productions, or Disney releases from other animation studios like Pixar).  This list of 50 includes some of the greatest movies of all time - Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, The Lion King, and 101 Dalmations.  Unfortunately, Disney studios has ceded the animation mantle to Pixar, and their last 10 films cannot hold a candle to the likes of Toy Story and The Incredibles.  So I was expecting, for the 50th film, a better effort, especially with John Lassiter as producer.  While Tangled does not quite live up to its more distant predecessors, it at least is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and it does contain some very nice animation and some big laughs.  It is also likely to be remembered as an ""also ran"" when compared to Disney's other release of 2010, Toy Story 3, which won an Oscar and set the box office record for most successful animated film of all time.Tangled is an adaptation of the Rapunzel story, elaborating and making Rapunzel's hair the fountain of youth (it's not as absurd as it sounds!).  I suppose that explains how she can drag it through meadows, rivers, and forests and never get it dirty.....  Unfortunately for Rapunzel, the hair needs to be attached to her head for it to work its magic, therefore she is held prisoner in the tower to satisfy the selfish needs of her adoptive mother, Gotha.  A thief named Ryder, fleeing from his latest caper, uses Rapunzel's tower as a hiding place, and their meeting sets in motion a chain of events involving Rapunzel and Ryder travelling to the royal city, pursued by the local constabulary, Ryder's disgruntled henchmen, and Rapunzel's ""mother"".Ryder's quipping asides generate many laughs, as do the antics of Maximus, a horse from the city guard that goes beyond the call of duty in trying to bring Ryder to justice.  There is also the joy of a remarkable action set-piece involving a breaking dam that is (dare I say it?) astonishing in it's animation (akin to the scale of Mulan's avalanche or the Lion King's stampede).  There is also the usual cast of Disney minor characters to lend colour and fun to the proceedings.  Certainly children will enjoy it, male or female, at least, if my 2 sons (5 and 3) and their female cousin (5) are any indication.  And it's ultimately harmless, certainly there are no traumatizing moments like Mufasa's death, and the violence is FAR less than that seen in The Incredibles or even Sleeping Beauty.But it doesn't quite all add up to a classic film.  I think the problem lies in the backstory - Rapunzel is kidnapped by Gotha from her parents, but there is no emotion in their plight because no time is spent in developing their characters or any relationship with their daughter.  By contrast, King Stephan has a prolonged scene in the middle of Sleeping Beauty, Mufasa teaches Simba and plays with him in the Lion King, and Belle's sacrifice for her father in Beauty and the Beast is not taken until after a number of establishing scenes showing Maurice by himself and with Belle.  Thus the reunion in Tangled has no particular emotion in it.  The second problem is with the music - there are a number of songs by Alan Menken (with lyricist Glenn Slater), but they sound like they belong in a Saturday afternoon teenage sitcom on the Disney Channel (e.g. ""When Will My Life Begin"" and ""I See the Light""). True, ""I've Got a Dream"" is a joyous setpiece to rival ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" or ""Under the Sea"", but one song does not a musical make.  Finally, I would be remiss if I neglected to point out that this is not a good value-for-money DVD.  Considering I paid the same price for Toy Story 3 and Tangled, the former has a number of neat extras, including a featurette on Pixar's modelling process, various short tours of Pixar's studio, and footage of a Buzz action figure on the International Space Station.  All Tangled has is footage on an alternate beginning which, while interesting, is paltry indeed compared to most Disney releases.  (of course, the intended audience will not care one whit that the DVD has no extras....)Overall, I'd place Tangled in with the likes of lesser (but still enjoyable) films such as Atlantis, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or Pocahontas (but better than The Rescuers or Tarzan).  And it's certainly better than most other animation out there that passes for children's entertainment, such as Will Farrell's Curious George, the Rugrats Movie, the Clone Wars film, and even Pixar's A Bug's Life.",3,A middling Disney film on a bargain-basement DVD,1305072000,"05 11, 2011",2011,4561,"['Tangled', '50th', 'film', 'produced', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'animation', 'studio', 'clarity', 'number', 'not', 'include', 'joint', 'productions', 'Disney', 'releases', 'other', 'animation', 'studios', 'Pixar', 'list', '50', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Cinderella', 'Lion', 'King', '101', 'Dalmations', 'Unfortunately', 'Disney', 'studios', 'ceded', 'animation', 'mantle', 'Pixar', 'last', '10', 'films', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'likes', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Incredibles', 'So', 'was', 'expecting', '50th', 'film', 'better', 'effort', 'especially', 'John', 'Lassiter', 'producer', 'Tangled', 'not', 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'more', 'distant', 'predecessors', 'least', 'enjoyable', '90', 'minutes', 'contain', 'very', 'nice', 'animation', 'big', 'laughs', 'also', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'also', 'ran', 'when', 'compared', 'Disney', 'other', 'release', '2010', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'won', 'Oscar', 'set', 'box', 'office', 'record', 'most', 'successful', 'animated', 'film', 'time.Tangled', 'adaptation', 'Rapunzel', 'story', 'elaborating', 'making', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'fountain', 'youth', 'not', 'as', 'absurd', 'suppose', 'how', 'can', 'drag', 'meadows', 'rivers', 'forests', 'never', 'get', 'dirty', '..', 'Unfortunately', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'be', 'attached', 'head', 'work', 'magic', 'held', 'prisoner', 'tower', 'satisfy', 'selfish', 'needs', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Gotha', 'thief', 'named', 'Ryder', 'fleeing', 'latest', 'caper', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'hiding', 'place', 'meeting', 'sets', 'motion', 'chain', 'events', 'involving', 'Rapunzel', 'Ryder', 'travelling', 'royal', 'city', 'pursued', 'local', 'constabulary', 'Ryder', 'disgruntled', 'henchmen', 'Rapunzel', 'mother', '.Ryder', 'quipping', 'asides', 'generate', 'many', 'laughs', 'do', 'antics', 'Maximus', 'horse', 'city', 'guard', 'call', 'duty', 'trying', 'bring', 'Ryder', 'justice', 'also', 'joy', 'remarkable', 'action', 'set-piece', 'involving', 'breaking', 'dam', 'dare', 'say', 'astonishing', 'animation', 'akin', 'scale', 'Mulan', 'avalanche', 'Lion', 'King', 'stampede', 'also', 'usual', 'cast', 'Disney', 'minor', 'characters', 'lend', 'colour', 'fun', 'proceedings', 'Certainly', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'male', 'female', 'least', '2', 'sons', '5', '3', 'female', 'cousin', '5', 'are', 'indication', 'ultimately', 'harmless', 'certainly', 'are', 'traumatizing', 'moments', 'Mufasa', 'death', 'violence', 'FAR', 'less', 'seen', 'Incredibles', 'even', 'Sleeping', ""n't"", 'quite', 'add', 'up', 'classic', 'film', 'think', 'problem', 'backstory', 'Rapunzel', 'kidnapped', 'Gotha', 'parents', 'emotion', 'plight', 'time', 'spent', 'developing', 'characters', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'contrast', 'King', 'Stephan', 'prolonged', 'scene', 'middle', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Mufasa', 'Simba', 'plays', 'Lion', 'King', 'Belle', 'sacrifice', 'father', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'not', 'taken', 'number', 'establishing', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Maurice', 'Belle', 'Thus', 'reunion', 'Tangled', 'particular', 'emotion', 'second', 'problem', 'music', 'are', 'number', 'songs', 'Alan', 'Menken', 'lyricist', 'Glenn', 'Slater', 'sound', 'belong', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'teenage', 'sitcom', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'e.g', 'When', 'Will', 'My', 'Life', 'Begin', 'See', 'Light', 'True', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Dream', 'joyous', 'setpiece', 'rival', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Wait', 'be', 'King', 'Sea', 'one', 'song', 'not', 'musical', 'make', 'Finally', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'neglected', 'point', 'out', 'not', 'good', 'value-for-money', 'DVD', 'Considering', 'paid', 'same', 'price', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Tangled', 'former', 'number', 'neat', 'extras', 'including', 'featurette', 'Pixar', 'modelling', 'process', 'various', 'short', 'tours', 'Pixar', 'studio', 'footage', 'Buzz', 'action', 'figure', 'International', 'Space', 'Station', 'Tangled', 'footage', 'alternate', 'beginning', 'interesting', 'paltry', 'indeed', 'compared', 'most', 'Disney', 'releases', 'course', 'intended', 'audience', 'will', 'not', 'care', 'one', 'whit', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'place', 'Tangled', 'likes', 'lesser', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'such', 'Atlantis', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Pocahontas', 'better', 'Rescuers', 'Tarzan', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'animation', 'there', 'children', 'entertainment', 'such', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'Curious', 'George', 'Rugrats', 'Movie', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'film', 'even', 'Pixar', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life']",N/A

Gainey and Jeffrey Tambor,WRITTEN BY: Dan FoglemanDIRECTED BY: Nathan Greno and Byron HowardRated: PGGenre: Animation / ComedyRelease Date: 24 November 2010Review Date: 31 December 2010Now here is a film I was not expecting much from, that delivered an amazing time at the movies! What a discredit to the film, the trailer for Tangled was. It's a take on the timeless tale of Rapunzel: the girl with incredibly long hair who has been locked away in a tower. Disney has revamped the story, complete with some zany modern day jargon and the vocal talent of Mandy Moore.Disney takes us back to the likes of classic stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Tangled is a much simpler film than those, as far as plot and characters are concerned, but it feels just as magical. The animation is stunning, and there is some amazing cinematography; something I really enjoy seeing amidst the colorful backdrop of an animated landscape. Oh, Rapunzel's tall tower, tucked away at the edge of a forest by a waterfall. It reminded me of something Lara Croft would stumble across in a Tomb Raider game.The movie is also very funny. We meet a guy named Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) who much like Aladdin, is a thief but isn't the worst of guys. He's hilarious, charming and cunning and he's about to meet his match: Rapunzel.Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kidnapped at a young age by an evil woman fed up with her aging looks. She took her from her home because she possesses a few very strange gifts that allow her to work miracles. The one of most importance to our villain being that when she sings, her hair glows and can transform the decrepit old woman into one hot little animated dish of yummy. The woman raises Rapunzel as her own daughter.Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, magical lights that hold meaning to the story, light up the sky. She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window. For fear that she will be found out; the mother forbids her from ever leaving the dusty old tower that is so high up, access can only be gained by the lowering of a very long rope. Or a very long ponytail!Naturally, Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower by mistake when fleeing from someone he's just robbed. While her mother is away on a three day trip, Rapunzel decides to call on the aid of Flynn. Stashing away his precious stolen high dollar item, she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights before she will return it to him.And thus their adventure begins, and only looks better in 3D, so go see it!",4,Tangled Review,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2649,"['TANGLEDSTARRING', 'voices', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'Ron', 'Pearlman', 'M.C', 'Gainey', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'WRITTEN', 'BY', 'Dan', 'FoglemanDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Nathan', 'Greno', 'Byron', 'HowardRated', 'PGGenre', 'Animation', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '24', 'November', '2010Review', 'Date', '31', 'December', '2010Now', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'delivered', 'amazing', 'time', 'movies', 'What', 'discredit', 'film', 'trailer', 'Tangled', 'was', 'take', 'timeless', 'tale', 'Rapunzel', 'girl', 'incredibly', 'long', 'hair', 'who', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'tower', 'Disney', 'revamped', 'story', 'complete', 'zany', 'modern', 'day', 'jargon', 'vocal', 'talent', 'Mandy', 'Moore.Disney', 'back', 'likes', 'classic', 'stories', 'such', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Aladdin', 'Tangled', 'much', 'simpler', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'just', 'as', 'magical', 'animation', 'stunning', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'something', 'really', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'colorful', 'backdrop', 'animated', 'landscape', 'Oh', 'Rapunzel', 'tall', 'tower', 'tucked', 'away', 'edge', 'forest', 'waterfall', 'reminded', 'something', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'would', 'stumble', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'game.The', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'meet', 'guy', 'named', 'Flynn', 'voiced', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'who', 'much', 'Aladdin', 'thief', ""n't"", 'worst', 'guys', 'hilarious', 'charming', 'cunning', 'meet', 'match', 'Rapunzel.Rapunzel', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'young', 'age', 'evil', 'woman', 'fed', 'up', 'aging', 'looks', 'took', 'home', 'few', 'very', 'strange', 'gifts', 'allow', 'work', 'miracles', 'one', 'most', 'importance', 'villain', 'being', 'when', 'hair', 'glows', 'can', 'transform', 'decrepit', 'old', 'woman', 'one', 'hot', 'little', 'animated', 'dish', 'yummy', 'woman', 'Rapunzel', 'own', 'daughter.Every', 'year', 'Rapunzel', 'birthday', 'magical', 'lights', 'hold', 'meaning', 'story', 'light', 'up', 'sky', 'fascinated', 'dreams', 'seeing', 'up', 'close', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'window', 'fear', 'will', 'be', 'found', 'out', 'mother', 'ever', 'leaving', 'dusty', 'old', 'tower', 'so', 'high', 'up', 'access', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'gained', 'lowering', 'very', 'long', 'rope', 'very', 'long', 'ponytail', 'Naturally', 'Flynn', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'mistake', 'when', 'fleeing', 'someone', 'just', 'robbed', 'mother', 'away', 'three', 'day', 'trip', 'Rapunzel', 'call', 'aid', 'Flynn', 'Stashing', 'away', 'precious', 'stolen', 'high', 'dollar', 'item', 'taking', 'see', 'lights', 'will', 'return', 'him.And', 'thus', 'adventure', 'only', 'better', '3D', 'so', 'go', 'see']",N/A

I was very surprised by the quality of the animation in this film. They put some serious effort into the background scenery, the water flowing, the lighting, ect. Many of those shots are worthy of framing. I did not like the character style, however. It reminded me of my daughter's Barbie movies and was very un-Disneylike when compared to the classics. Not bad, but not what I have grown to love.The story moved along fairly well with nothing terribly unexpected happening. My biggest disappointment was the music. A great Disney movie uses the music to set the theme for the movie and the music moves the story along. With a few notes you can pick out the theme songs of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, or even the Rescuers. I can't remember a single song from this forgettable score and I just saw it yesterday. I got the impression the songs were stuck in there because all animated Disney  movies have songs, and not because they actually cared what the songs were.In the end, my daughter loved this movie and my wife enjoyed it. So it is better than the component parts.

I loved that she is smart and able to do anything she sets her mind too and is not in any way a damsel in distress. She can take care of herself that's for sure and I think that's a super strong role model for any little girl! I love the songs and music especially during the lanterns.. it's so beautiful it reminded me of the Little Mermaid in a lot of scenes and had all the makings of a classic Disney Movie on the order of the Lion Kind, Beauty and The Beast, it's perfect for girls and boys alike too. It has some particularly touching moments where the lead characters go into detail about their unique pasts and gradually fall in love with each other, they don't just get married and ride off to a castle for the sake of it, not that there is anything wrong in that..just saying. I was torn about the Mother Gothel Character, I was glad that Rapunzel was free of her no question, but I don't like that she died, I would have liked, for Rapunzel's sake to see her maybe change and realize she really does love the little girl she raised from a baby.. it is as Rapunzel says ""Complicated"". It's hard to stomach that all she really was interested in was the eternal youth that Rapunzel's magic hair provided.. but the story ends on a high note, a still very young Rapunzel will have the rest of her life to live and her real family back to get to know and love all over again, all in all, this is arguably my new favorite classic Disney Movie!",5,I love this movie!,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,1553,"['movie', 'beautifully', 'told', 'deals', 'not', 'so', 'pretty', 'details', 'very', 'easy', 'understand', 'way', 'loved', 'smart', 'able', 'do', 'anything', 'mind', 'too', 'not', 'way', 'damsel', 'distress', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'sure', 'think', 'super', 'strong', 'role', 'model', 'little', 'girl', 'love', 'songs', 'music', 'especially', 'lanterns..', 'so', 'beautiful', 'reminded', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'lot', 'scenes', 'had', 'makings', 'classic', 'Disney', 'Movie', 'order', 'Lion', 'Kind', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'perfect', 'girls', 'boys', 'alike', 'too', 'particularly', 'touching', 'moments', 'where', 'lead', 'characters', 'go', 'detail', 'unique', 'pasts', 'gradually', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'married', 'ride', 'off', 'castle', 'sake', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'that..just', 'saying', 'was', 'torn', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'Character', 'was', 'glad', 'Rapunzel', 'was', 'free', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'died', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Rapunzel', 'sake', 'see', 'maybe', 'change', 'realize', 'really', 'love', 'little', 'girl', 'raised', 'baby..', 'Rapunzel', 'Complicated', 'hard', 'stomach', 'really', 'was', 'interested', 'was', 'eternal', 'youth', 'Rapunzel', 'magic', 'hair', 'provided..', 'story', 'high', 'note', 'still', 'very', 'young', 'Rapunzel', 'will', 'have', 'rest', 'life', 'live', 'real', 'family', 'back', 'get', 'know', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'arguably', 'new', 'favorite', 'classic', 'Disney', 'Movie']",N/A

There were the rare exceptions like Mulan in 1998 and the incredible Lilo & Stitch in 2002, but overall the glory days of Disney were in the past.  I heard that 'Tangled' had gotten great reviews, and man were those reviews right!!!This isn't just a good movie, but a GREAT one that excels in all areas which are important with 1 small exception:- animation is some of the greatest I have ever seen, it's absolutely gorgeous- story is fresh and new, a great new spin on an old story- score is spot on throughout- voice acting is exceptionalThe only caveat I have is that the songs were very good, just not on the level with the Lion King, but this isn't a fair critique.I have no qualms with recommending this movie to EVERYONE.  A rare CGI movie that has a feel that isn't CGI and another gem that is on the same level as Pixar.

1405973,A8S11VP9Z36D6,B004G6009K,"Dave ""Davelandweb""","[2, 4]","I was really surprised by ""Tangled."" It is everything i had hopedThe Princess and The Frogwould be. Sure, I loved ""Princess And The Frog,"" but ""Tangled"" is close to perfection in all the major ways: characterization, story, style, and even song. Although I question all the brouhaha about renaming ""Rapunzel"" so that the male audience wouldn't get turned off by another Princess movie, I fully support the final product! The movie is current yet classic; edgy yet traditional; in short...great Disney entertainment.Flynn Rider is one of the first truly dimensional male leads in a Disney film in years; Zachary Levi does a great job of voicing a character who is more than just a handsome piece of cardboard. Mandy Moore is more than able as the voice for the lead, giving Rapunzel plenty of gumption and a thirst for life after having been couped up in the tower for so long. Although I LOVED the movieEnchanted, I was less than thrilled with Susan Sarandon's villainess. She almost seemed to walk through the role, lacking the proper subtle menace needed to really create a dark and scary character capable of doing evil deeds. Not a problem here though; Donna Murphy makes Mother Gothel, the evil woman who stole Rapunzel from her royal parents at birth, one of the scariest (albeit subtly) Disney villainesses in a long time. When she tells Rapnzel not to ask her about leaving the tower again, you know she means it!The story is familiar, but here goes a Reader's Digest version: Mother Gothel steals Rapunzel as a baby so that her magical hair will keep her (Mother Gothel) eternally young. To ensure Rapunzel doesn't get wise to the theft, she poses as Rapunzel's mother and locks the young girl away in a secluded tower, constantly warning her that the outside world is evil. As fate would have it, a handsome Robin Hood-esque young man named Flynn Rider is attempting to escape the guards at the Royal Palace, and naturally happens upon Rapunzel's tower while Gothel is gone. Rapunzel sees Flynn as her ticket for a quick escape to see the wonders of the world without Gothel knowing. It should come as no surprise that the best laid plans go awry, and Rapunzel ends up getting much more than she bargained for, with Gothel hot on her trail, desperate to recapture  her fading youth.So why 4 stars instead of 5? First, the picture is perfect. You can practically count the hairs on Rapunzel's head. The beautiful lighting and shading from the Disney Animation Team is shown to its full advantage. And as for the sound...awesome as well! The music surrounds you and you'll be singing the memorable music (""Mother Knows Best"" and ""When Will My Life Begin"") right along with the movie. Obviously, my slight beef is not with the music. Instead, it's with the features. It seems obvious that this set is aimed towards the regular (and possibly more youthful) viewer as opposed to the animation-junkie who wants to see the behind-the-scenes documentaries, intense storyboard sessions, and other rare material that would satisfy the deep cravings of a Disneyphile. Instead, there are hip and comical features that are more fun than informative.Here's what you get:-Untangled: The Making of a Fairy Tale: Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi host this featurette that is more trivia-based than anything very serious or scholarly. Again, definitely aimed at the younger set and those who just want to be entertained. For me, the most interesting part was seeing how the hair of Rapunzel was actually animated. Wow...what a challenge to make it look natural.-Deleted Scenes: Co-directors Byron Howard & Nathan Greco introduce 3 scenes (""The Jaunty Moose,"" ""Chemistry Develops,"" and ""Vigor The Visionary"") and explain why they were cut. I have to admit I get a little annoyed with the Disney ""deleted scene"" features on their discs. Most of these haven't even gotten beyond the storyboard point, so I'm not sure they really qualify as ""deleted."" Instead, these are more like ideas that were explored but never really quite finished. All of them slow down the pace and definitely are not missed. Enjoyable, but not missed.-Two Original Storybook Openings: Alternate versions of the film's opening, again introduced by Byron  & Nathan. This is at least interesting to see how it pays homage to classic Disney animation as well as how it evolved over each attempt.-50th Animated Feature Countdown: Fun, but again...more on the fluffy side is this montage of the 49 Disney animated films that preceded ""Tangled.""-9 Tangled Teasers: Another fluff piece...entertaining, funny, and witty...but again, fluff. A series of ""trailers"" that take the form of parodies of infomercials and other current commercials/news bits.And that's it...other than the usual bag of previews/plugs for upcoming Disney releases.Please don't let the 4 stars deter you; this is truly a fantastic Disney animated classic that deserves to stand proudly with its predecessors. CGI detractors: it's just another art tool like a pencil...this film has many stunning moments, especially the scenes with the lanterns (you just have to get it to see!).SPECS: 1.78:1 widescreen/enhanced for 16x9 with 7.1 DTS-HD, 2.0 Dolby Digital DVS for Bluray and 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.1 Dolby Digital DVS for DVD.

This is THE BEST princess movie Disney has produced, and yes, that includes all the classics... Snow White is a beautiful movie and was an exceptional achievement for it's time, but if you leave outside the ""this is the untouchable all time classic princess story"" factor, you will find that these two musicals are similar in many ways (the hilarious and visually stunning singing act performed by the criminal gang in the Little Duck resembles so much the Silly Song act), the biggest difference being that Tangled ads an adventurous side to the story wich makes it both appealing to girls and boys, my four year old boy gets bored with Snow White but enjoys Tangled from start to end. All the singing acts are excellent and deserve to be staged in Broadway (no kidding).

1405993,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B004G6009K,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 4]","""Tangled"", by all means, represents Disney's return to the true princess fairy tales since decades.  Last year's ""The Princess and The Frog"" may seem like a princess tale due to the title itself, but it was a princess tale based on technicalities and loopholes (which, btw, were pretty clever approaches to that movie's story); it's Disney's return to traditional animated films, but not a proper return to the golden era where marketable animated girls of royal background take center stage.  ""Tangled"" actually is, and this film feels very reminiscent to Disney's hand-drawn classics, even though it's computer-animated: it has a chivalric setting, vibrant scenery, a female lead who wishes for something more, a dashing hero/rebel, an evil step-mother, songs of whimsy, goofy comic-reliefs, 'dreams come true' speeches, and a valiant story filled with contrived set-ups and implausibilit---I mean, filled with magic. Not only does it capture these elements with a sense of nostalgia that will cater to the old as well as the young (fun for the whole family and all), it manage to be refreshing and bold while staying true to its roots.Typing from someone who has seen more than his share of fairy tale movies than he's willing to admit, this has a by-the-books story; not a lot of surprises to be had from a narrative standpoint, but then again, Disney doesn't enjoy subverting its own formula.  It has its leads, they go on a journey (trials and romance abound), and the simple audience gets what they want.  But much like ""The Social Network"", which is also formulaic in its story, this film manages to be very good because of its execution.For one thing, it's the musical numbers.  Being an animated musical, and also the first computer-animated musical made by Disney, one has to face the fallacies ofembarrassingly weak songsandtacked-on musical transitions; Disney movies aren't really known by them, but I can't say its characters suddenly go into song really makes sense to me.  However, Disney managed to step up its game by making the act of singing an integral part of this movie's plot.  See, the evil Gothel had to sing to a magical macguffin flower so she won't grow old, and when she kidnapped Rapuznel as a child and raise her as her own daughter due to backstory-related reasons regarding that flora of youth, Gothel made her sing so hermagical haircan glow and revitalize Gothel's age; since Gothel and the now-legal age Rapunzel made chirping a tune routine, their singing came naturally for them.  There was also a well-crafted musical number that took place in a saloon, where all the grunts and vikings were singing about their dreams; one of the lead characters didn't want to sing, but they threatened him to sing anyway, which made the number delightfully humorous.  If there's one musical number I thought was 'tacked on', it's the ""I See the Light"" sequence...and yet it's not tacked on; it's hard to explain, but maybe because the sequence itself is so enchanting, it can get away with being tacky.  For the most part, the musical sequences were excellently handled.Comparing to ""Princess and Frog"", character-wise, the leads in this film were more engaging and interesting than Tiana and Naveen.  But when it comes to villains, Gothel is pretty weak compared to the conniving Shadow Man.  While I appreciate that she treated her 'daughter' with some degree of humanity compared to other Disney step-mothers, her obsession to keep Rapunzel secluded in a tall tower for the sake of eternal youth made her appear less sinister and moreJoan Crawford.  Back to the leads, Flynn the dashing thief has to be the smuggiest smug-face smuggers I've ever smuggin' seen this side of Dreamworks; even when he had a change of heart, found a person that's more important to him than what he stole and all that usual character development, he still had that arrogant smirk.  However, I grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.  There's a strong chemistry between him and Rapunzel, and there's a lot of joy to be had from those two; the funniest scene of the film happened when Flynn took Rapunzel out of her tower for the first time and she goes through a schizophrenic blast of exuberance and misery while Flynn just sulks, which was ingenious in both comic delivery and juxtaposition.  Nice that the movie took the ""Aladdin"" approach in having the animal sidekicks not talk but rely on physical gestures to give them personality, and I really dig the chameleon as well as the brave steed; they don't hog much of the screen time, but that's a good thing.I'm amazed at how the Disney princess archetype has evolved over the years.  The likes of Snow White and Cinderella don't have much in the way of multi-layered personalities outside of being kind and pretty (orBelldandy), and it's only until ""The Little Mermaid"" that princesses started to have some depth to them; although, the deepest some can go is being assertive and independent, pretty much the 'woman in a man's world' mentality that grew to succession in reality.  And then comes Rapunzel, a proper evolution to the stereotype.  She's such an amazing character, because she has that dainty innocence as the old princesses as well as the defiant attitude of new princesses; it all says she's a woman in heart and body, but can still hold her ground, which is more than I can say about many tough action girls.  Rapunzel also has some unique quirks to give her distinction, like her hyperactivity; she's practically a child, going bananas at all the new things she sees or wanted to see.  The fact that her life was explored from the beginning made me understand her, made her compelling as she journeys not only to know her past, but to maturity.  No doubt she's right up there with Jasmine as one of the best Disney princesses.Again, ""Tangled"" is following a familiar tale, but such familiarity comes with great characters, a solid adventure that's clever and exciting, moments of levity and grim, and a resolution that, while not quite as good in the same manner as ""Wall-E"", is so moving that it's worth suspending one's predictions.  The songs themselves are very moving; each song is catchy, energetic, and easily inviting.  These compliments come as no surprise since Alan Menken composed for this movie, who also wrote music for most of the Disney Renaissance films and had a history of turning sappy love ballads into diamonds.  Speaking of, ""I See the Light"" is personally the highlight of the soundtrack, a sublimity that owes much from ""A Whole New World"". I really like this song and I can't wait to see the accolades it deserves, and I can't wait forAmericato try and ruin it in a few years; good thing I have a frying pan to beat myself senseless when the latter happens.",4,"Long Beautiful Hair, Shining and Gleaming",1291507200,"12 5, 2010",2010,6833,"['Tangled', 'means', 'Disney', 'return', 'true', 'princess', 'fairy', 'tales', 'decades', 'Last',

Based on the fairy tale ""Rapunzel"" by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the film adaptation is directed by Nathan Greno (""Bolt"", ""Meet the Robinsons"", ""Chicken Little"", ""Mulan"") with Byron Howard (""Chicken Little"", ""Brotehr Bear"", ""Lilo & Stitch"", ""Mulan"", ""Pocahontas"") and a screenplay by Dan Fogelman (""Bolt"", ""Cars"", ""Fred Claus"").""Tangled"" would feature the voices of Mandy Moore (""A Walk to Remember"", ""Saved"", ""The Princess Diaries""), Zachary Levi (""Chuck"", ""Less Than Perfect"", ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel""), Donna Murphy (""The Fountain"", ""Spider-Man 2', ""Trust Me""), Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"" films, ""Sons of Anarchy"", ""Chronus""), M.C. Gainey (""Beerfest"", ""Sideways"", ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines""), Jeffrey Tambor (""The Hangover"", ""Arrested Development"", ""The Larry Sanders Show"") and Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ""`Til Death"", ""Ratatouille"").The film was a success in the box office as the $260 million film would make over $551 million worldwide and has received mostly positive reviews from film critics.VIDEO:""Tangled"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 Aspect Ratio) and I don't think anyone has found anything negative to say about a modern Disney animated film on Blu-ray and the same can be said for ""Tangled"".  Immediately when you start watching ""Tangled"", you are greeted with vibrant colors, black levels are nice and fine detail crammed into every frame.  From the detail on the trees, to the detail of Rapunzel's hair, watching the folds on the clothing of the characters to the details of the Tower, the greenery...""Tangled"" features colors and detail galore.If there was one scene that really caught my eyes was during the chase scene (which applies to audio as well).  The way the mountains look, the way the water looks, even down to the grain of the wood, ""Tangled"" looked absolutely fantastic.  I was very impressed by the animation for this film.I detected no artifacting, digital noise, edge enhancement but I did detect slight banding in two spots.  One where both Flynn and Rapunzel were sitting near a camp fire and another scene with a lot of red.  It was noticeable but aside from those short moments, I detected nothing that would have spoiled the film.Personally, for the majority of the film, ""Tangled"" was a visual feast and I was quite impressed by how detailed the film was but also how much went into the physics for Rapunzel's hair.  Overall, awesome PQ!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Tangled"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio, French  Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD NR and English 2.0 DVS.  While not as strong as other Disney action-based films, still ""Tangled"" is no slouch as you can hear the wind, plants rustling, the stomping of the hooves of Maximus, the arrows being shot by the guards who are trying to get Flynn Rider and the bumps and slams into Flynn Rider's noggin from the pan used by Rapunzel.But possibly the best segment where LFE, surround and rear-surround channels come into play is the chase scene when the guards and Maximus are going after Flynn and Rapunzel.  That was quite impressive audio-wise!So, there are many moments of immersive audio that you can hear from the surround channels but because this is not an all-action film, one can expect crisp dialogue through the center channels and the score by Alan Menken as well as the music from ""Tangled"" through the front channels but also at times utilizing the surround and rear-surround channels.The lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate for a film like ""Tangled"" and I don't think anyone can be disappointed by it.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Tangled"" comes with the following special features:* Deleted Scenes - (12:36) Featuring three deleted scenes: The Jaunty Moose, Chemistry Develops and Vigor the Visionary featuring intros by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard on why the scenes were cut.  Note: Scenes are sketches and not 3D rendered.* Original Storybook Opening - Originally, the film would feature a storybook opening but the directors felt they wanted to do something different.  So, included are the the two storybook openings version 1 (3:57) and version 2 (4:02).* 50th Animated Feature Countdown - (2:03) A countdown featuring clips of all 50 Disney Animated films.* Extended Songs - Featuring the extended songs ""When Will My Life Begin"" (3:35) and ""Mother Knows Best"" (4:12) with intro by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.* Untangled - The Making of a Fairy Tale - (12:28) Featuring the making of ""Tangled"" hosted by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi.* Tangled Teasers - (9:12) Featuring nine animated teasers for ""Tangled"".EXTRAS:""Tangled"" comes with a slip-over cardboard case.  The accompanying DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1), English & Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 DVS with subtitles in English SDH and French Subtitles.JUDGMENT CALL:This is an update to my previous review as I decided that I had to watch this film again as the first time, I felt I was concentrating too much on the visuals but this time around, I wanted to embrace the musical side to the film as well and I'm glad I did!Not only did I enjoy it much more the second time, I just realized how awesome this Blu-ray release is by just really focusing on the lossless soundtrack and just finding that right position where the sound effects, especially the music just came alive.""Tangled"" turned out to be a wonderful, delightful animated film by Disney and a wonderful experience that had that romantic comedy but yet darker and magical feel such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and even ""Snow White"".And as mentioned earlier in my review, this is a wonderful Disney film that wasn't made by Pixar and perhaps that is a good thing because Disney animated classics have built themselves upon fantasy and adventure and what best to have their 50th animated film to carry on the tradition that Walt Disney had done long ago for his films and that is to have a film that can entertain people of all ages but to also to have elements based on a well-written script.Sure, John Lasseter may have had his hand in this film as an executive producer but you have to give credit to directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, especially screenwriter Dan Fogelman for taking on a well-known fairy tale and making an enjoyable film out of it.  Personally, I felt that the creators and staff were able to create a fresh and innovative storyline based on the fairy tale of ""Rapunzel"" but not make it so kitschy and keeping it fun, humorous and even heartfelt.While a few may have felt that it was wrong for Disney to use the title of ""Rapunzel"" and go with the title of ""Tangled"", I can understand why they did it.  With ""The Princess and the Frog"", many felt the film did skew towards a younger female demographic and ""Rapunzel"" would have probably done the same.  Enough of the foolishness of even debating about the name, focus on the film and you realize how fantastic of an animated film ""Tangled"" truly is.This time, you have Rapunzel and the swashbuckling thief, Flynn Rider and you have a film that the boys and girls will love, but throw in a few deeper and slightly darker elements to make the film rated PG and you have all the ingredients to make a wonderful animated film.The voice acting for the film was wonderful.  Both Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi have wonderful chemistry ala voice acting and for the most part, the characters and the talented hired for the film were well-cast by Disney.  I'm not sure who did the singing voice for Rapunzel (as I know Mandy Moore can sing) and even for Flynn (can Zachary Levi sing?), but will say that I was quite pleased with both talent's voice acting performance.The musical score by Alan Menken was actually quite memorable and like he has done for animated films like ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", the music is quite strong.  The musical numbers for ""Tangled"" are catchy and fun but while the music and the songs really provided a wonderful backdrop to the awesome visuals.  At first, I felt that I was unfair to the music as I kept complimenting the visuals but the second time around, I made it priority to listen to the music and I found myself absolutely loving it.  Menken really created music that complimented the film and once again, he has done a fabulous job.As for the Blu-ray release, ""Tangled"" looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and the music and lossless audio soundtrack is wonderful and works for this type of film.  While there are a good amount of special features with this release, I have to admit that I was a bit surprised as I was expecting a whole lot more (as Disney tends to spoil you with a lot of special features) for ""Tangled"".  But still, that's after years of being spoiled by Blu-ray releases from Disney but for what was included, there are still a good number of special features to keep viewers busy.Overall, ""Tangled"" is a delightful film that will entertain families although because it's rated PG and does nearly show a death scene, it was a necessary move by Disney that made the film work.  The film still manages to display the magic of Walt Disney through it's look and feel and also continuing the tradition of quality with its Blu-ray releases as ""Tangled"" simply looks beautiful and sounds great via HD.While not as special features heavy as I would have hoped (and expected) to see from a Walt Disney film, ""Tangled"" is still an enjoyable and wonderful film for the entire family and I definitely recommend it!",5,"Blu-ray: Disney's 50th Walt Disney Animated feature ""Tangled"", is a delightful & heartfelt animated film for the entire family.",1302652800,"04 13,

1405995,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B004G6009K,Derek,"[1, 4]","Overall, not a bad film. Not the best Disney animated film, but I would say it's better than the other non-Pixar, computer-animated films.Tangled is Disney's interesting take on the tale of Rapunzel, with a few twists and turns added in.This film has a lot to like as well as a lot left to be desired. The story is a classic Disney princess tale and follows the same pattern as previous Disney princess films, which is good. The characters are engaging and the comedic moments add up to a lot of fun. On the flip-side, the film would have faired better as a non-musical. The songs in the film were random, unnecessary, and, at times, a bit too ridiculous. Like previous Disney films, the music is meant to add to the film and build the emotion of a character or scene. The music did not do this in Tangled; it almost seemed thrown in there just to make it a musical or to use Mandy Moore's talent.Also, I think we've been quite spoiled by Pixar and their amazing animation skills. The animation in this just doesn't match the quality and believability that Pixar and DreamWorks have achieved in their films (especially with fire and water effects).Also, I saw a lot of other Disney movies incorporated in this one, as if they took a bunch of previous Disney animated films and cut them together into one: The mother-daughter relationship as well as the daughter's wish to leave the tower for a day is almost exactly replicate of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Quasi and Rapunzel even sing a similar-themed song about going outside). The almost-kiss scene in the boat on the lake was scene-stealing from The Little Mermaid without the singing fish. And - without going into great detail - the sacrifice and miracle at the end of the film was copied almost straight from Beauty and the Beast, from wound down to the tear drop.Okay, I'm done ranting.

1406012,A11C43I615R52G,B004G6009K,"Don Vito Corleone ""The Joker""","[0, 0]","Since John Lasseter took over Walt Disney Animation Studios, a trend of quality has been noted in the features released since his commanding. Disney Animation Studios has a rich history and was one of the best (if not the best studio) in the animtion field. But since the 2000s, the studio became less and less succesful with awful movies that not only did not resonate with audiences but also were box office bombs. Since Lasseter took over the studio, only four films (Meet the Robinsons, Bolt, The Princess and the Frog and Tangled)had been released but each one of them are compelling and have pushed the studio up again. Following the phenomenal The Princess and the Frog (which also set the return of glourious hand-drawn animation into the studio), Tangled became Disney's 50th Animated film and I'm happy to report that is a sensational film that proudly fits that milestone.Struggling almost 8 years in production and costing over $260 million, Tangled had a very troubled production. Formerly knwon as Rapunzel, the title was changed in order to appeal to boys and to draw more money from the box office. While the title change is somewhat a debatable decision, it seems it worked because Tangled became a major box office success earning almost $600 million in receipts. Although the title was changed and the trailers showed a ""contemporary"" story, make no mistake: Tangled is a tradional musical fairy tale and is a really good one.I won't tell the plot here but let me tell you that the movie has a lot going for it: a compelling and likeable heroine, a brave and funny hero, adorable animal sideckicks and a memorable villain. Rapunzel is a very strong, free-spirited young woman who is easy to root for, the same can be said for Flynn Ryder the thief with a heart of gold. Pascal the chameleon and Maximus the horse are really funny and Mother Gothel is a very amusing villain. The animators and the voice actors have to be credited for doing such roundable palpable characters.The animation is simply amazing!!! It's the first time that a CGI Disney film can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. The humans are rendered marvelousy and the sceneries are breathtaking (specially the lantern sequence). But what struck me the most was how amazing Rapunzel's hair is. Is so beautiful and believable that really adds to the picture value.The score and the songs were done by legend composer Alan Menken and his new lyricist Glenn Slater. While the songs are good and serve their purpose in the film, they are far from memorable. They are not the best Menken has done and they are not at the same level as others like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin. Still the ones that I really like were ""When will my Life Begin?"", its reprise and of course the Oscar nominated ""I see the Light"" (which should've won the Oscar).Wrapping up, Tangled is an excellent film with outstanding animation, great characters and nice songs. An excellent Disney film.Video & Audio:Unsurprisingly by now, Tangled BD looks absolutely spectacualar. A lot of things can be said about the transfer but let me tell you that this disc is demo quality and will completely blew your mind. The same can be said for the 7.1 DTS-HD MA track which is dynamic, clear and potent.The DVD also boasts a fairly impressive transfer for SD and a good 5.1 Dolby Audio.Bonus Material:You have some deleted scenes, two storybooks openings, a 50th animated countdown (which is great), a making-of featurette, two extended songs and 9 teasers.While all the material is great, the making-of featurette feels really promotional and too short to be entirely valuable. I was hoping for a more compelling documentary that will talk about the music in the film, the anination and the production overall. Overall they are entertaining pieces but Disney could've done a lot more in the special features department.Sneek Peeks:You got some interesting Sneek peeks like:The Lion King: Diamond Edition (Coming this fall!!!)Winnie the Pooh (in theaters July 15, same day as Harry Potter)Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (not release date but is definetely coming this year)The Incredibles on BD (already released)And more that for me are not worth mentioning. Also is worth noting that in an insert that came in the box, The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary Edition and TFATH2 are also listed in a 2-movie collection 3-disc combo pack which will include a BD and a DVD for the original film and one DVD for the cheapquel. This set is going to be released this September.Final Thoughts:Tangled is another example that Disney is recapturing its magic again and delivering good quality animated films. With stunning video and excellent audio and a good (if lacking) assortment of bonus features, Tangled is a must-own title on BD. This set is great for the majority of us who won't buy 3D crap and doesn't care for digital copies. Tangled on BD comes highly recommended!!!",5,Disney Animated Classic #50: Disney's 50th Animated Feature is a Winner!!,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,4961,"['John', 'Lasseter', 'took', 'over', 'Walt',

Ocasio,"[0, 0]","Yes there are a ton of reviews for thias film, so first of all amazon should divide them among the feature film, then the DVD, and the other DVD versions that include BlueRay and 3D-DVD formats.Disney have made fairy tales and they way they present them in their own verison their forte, and this one's one of their crown jewels worthy of the same praise as Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid. Their take on the Rapunzel story is very unique. The film gives us a wonderful prologue, completely animated, and narrated by the would be love interest of Rapunzel a thief known as Flynn Rider, who has another name, but is ashamed of it.Rapunzel is anything but a damsel in distress as in previous versions of the stories in both books and animated films. She is very talented, curious, clever and 18 years old. Her ""prince"" is actually a thief who in the end saves her from a life of imprisonment in exchange for his own, not before striking a deal with Rapunzel, getting her out the tower, making her dream come true and giving the audience a fun thrilled and happy adventure., but the film does indeed has a happy ending and both end up together.Like in Disney's Aladdin the jokes and gags come at the audience at tremendous speed, you barely finished laughing at something when there's another joke on your face. And it does include several songs weaved into the story, but Tangled is not really a full musical like Beauty And The Beast or The Little Mermaid. You can tell the writers did tons of reasearch of the Rapunzel story, and incorporated many elements from various versions, plus their own Disney magic. Visually being completely computer generated every single frame of the movie is nothing but stunning, a true work of art.The DVD single disk edition includes two different opening sequences made by the studio artists, introduced on camera by the producers and director. Sadly that is the only extra available, as Disney felt compeled to include all the extra goodies for the Blue-Ray release. There is language selection for original English, and the Spanish or French dubs, but no scene selection. The other feature is a countdown of all their 50 animated feature films set to a song.I give the single DVD 4 stars for lack of extras, or not including another disk like they do with so many others, and 5 stars for the movie, a new Disney classic has born!

If you have kids and are the kind of person who prefers to have the DVD in their collection rather than rent them, then I can safely say, it is a good addition to a collection.People have written reviews breaking down the specifics of the movie and the product description basically tells you the story so there is no need to go into those details.This is a Disney return to clean, family fun. It is a real family movie. It is a well animated and well voiced film. Many movies today, even though they are animated for kids have some adult oriented humor slipped in. I don't think I saw any of this in this film. It was a kids film all the way.Misrepresented DVD vs. Bluray special features: On the regular DVD, there are no special features except 50th anniversary sneak peaks. That's it. The Bluray has all the special features. I watched the Bluray + DVD edition twice and can verify this.EDIT: The only thing that made the Bluray better is the witty banter in the Making of Tangled extra feature between Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. It was probably scripted but was a good, funny, entertaining behind the scenes.I really didn't see a big reason for this to be in Bluray. Like any Bluray movie compared to reg.

1406045,A3OZ7RXT1XGZR9,B004G6009K,freeismylife,"[2, 3]","About this time last year, Disney introduced Princess Tiana in the movie ""The Princess and the Frog"".  Well, Tiana is about to be dethroned as the newest Disney princess by none other than Princess Rapunzel in the new Disney movie ""Tangled"".Thursday, my son and I saw an advance screening of ""Tangled"" at the Birmingham Uptown Palladium.  But that was not my first time seeing the movie.  When I was in New York for the BlogHer conference, I saw an advance screening of the Disney movie ""Secretariat"".  Before ""Secretariat"" was shown, we bloggers were treated to the first 7 minutes of ""Tangled"", so I knew a few months ago that the Disney version of the story of Rapunzel was going to be out of this world exciting and like no version of the story that I had previously read.The movie ""Tangled"" starts out telling the Disney version of the story of how Rapunzel came to be trapped in that tower that we all read about as children.  Rapunzel's mother falls ill while in childbirth and is about to die.  To save his dying wife and unborn child, the king sends his army to look for a special flower that legend says can heal any sickness. The flower has been hidden for years by an evil old woman who has been using the flower's healing powers to keep herself young. The soldiers find the flower and the queen is healed and gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. Rapunzel is born with the power of healing in her hair and the old evil woman steals the baby and raises her as her own child so that she can use Rapunzel's power to stay young.The king and queen are devastated by the kidnapping of their child. So every year, on Rapunzel's birthday, they release thousands of lanterns in the sky in the hope that one day Rapunzel will return to them. Rapunzel (voiced by Manny Moore) has been trapped in the tower for 18 years and has never left, although she longs for freedom and to see the magic lanterns that mysteriously appear every year on her birthday.One day a handsome thief (voiced by Zachery Levi) steals Rapunzel's crown from the castle of the king and queen and that theft sets off a chain of events that finally releases Rapunzel from her tower and from the fears of the unknown that she has carried around since she was a baby.Like every Disney princess tale, ""Tangled"" is an exciting, complex story about goodness, evil, hate, love, fear, destiny, selfishness and total sacrifice.  Although we did not see it in 3D, this movie should be seen in 3D because of the bigger than life scenes in the film and the exciting storyline. I had to hold my son in his seat at times during the numerous chase scenes in the movie.Speaking of exciting, the character of Princess Rapunzel is no shrinking violet in this story. She is not waiting for a prince to save her in this tale. She is both sweet as pie and a tough cookie who fights evil better that any solider.  Everyone will love the intricate things that Rapunzel does with her piles of hair from using it as a elevator to turning it into every kind of fighting weapon imaginable. Despite the traditional story setting, Princess Rapunzel is a modern, highly intelligent princess who falls in love not with a prince, but with a bad boy with a good heart.I and my son really enjoyed ""Tangled"" and I predict when the movie debuts on November 24th, Princess Rapunzel will become the new reigning queen of the Disney Princesses. And if Disney were smart (if they have not already), they should buy the rights to Willow Smith's new tween pop song ""Whip My Hair"" and use it in the marketing of ""Tangled"".",5,"Disney has a new Princess and she's the queen of ""Whip My Hair""",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,3548,"['time', 'last', 'year', 'Disney', 'introduced', 'Princess', 'Tiana', 'movie', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'Well', 'Tiana', 'be', 'dethroned', 'newest', 'Disney', 'princess', 'none', 'other', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'new', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Tangled', '.Thursday', 'son', 'saw', 'advance', 'screening', 'Tangled', 'Birmingham', 'Uptown', 'Palladium', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'movie', 'When', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'BlogHer', 'conference', 'saw', 'advance', 'screening', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Secretariat', 'Secretariat', 'was', 'shown', 'bloggers', 'were', 'treated', 'first', '7', 'minutes', 'Tangled', 'knew', 'few', 'months', 'Disney', 'version', 'story', 'Rapunzel', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'out', 'world', 'exciting', 'version', 'story', 'had', 'previously', 'read.The', 'movie', 'Tangled', 'out', 'telling', 'Disney', 'version', 'story', 'how', 'Rapunzel', 'came', 'be', 'trapped', 'tower', 'read', 'children', 'Rapunzel', 'mother', 'ill', 'childbirth', 'about', 'die', 'save', 'dying', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child', 'king', 'army', 'look', 'special', 'flower', 'legend', 'can', 'heal', 'sickness', 'flower', 'been', 'hidden', 'years', 'evil', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'using', 'flower', 'healing', 'powers', 'keep', 'young', 'soldiers', 'find', 'flower', 'queen', 'healed', 'birth', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'Rapunzel', 'born', 'power', 'healing', 'hair', 'old', 'evil', 'woman', 'baby', 'own', 'child', 'can', 'use', 'Rapunzel', 'power', 'stay', 'young.The', 'king', 'queen', 'are', 'devastated', 'kidnapping', 'child', 'So', 'year', 'Rapunzel', 'birthday', 'release', 'thousands', 'lanterns', 'sky', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'Rapunzel', 'will', 'return', 'Rapunzel', 'voiced', 'Manny', 'Moore', 'been', 'trapped', 'tower', '18', 'years', 'never', 'left', 'freedom', 'see', 'magic', 'lanterns', 'mysteriously', 'appear', 'year', 'birthday.One', 'day', 'handsome', 'thief', 'voiced', 'Zachery', 'Levi', 'Rapunzel', 'crown', 'castle', 'king', 'queen', 'theft', 'sets', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'finally', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'fears', 'unknown', 'carried', 'was', 'baby.Like', 'Disney', 'princess', 'tale', 'Tangled', 'exciting', 'complex', 'story', 'goodness', 'evil', 'hate', 'love', 'fear', 'destiny', 'selfishness', 'total', 'sacrifice', 'did', 'not', 'see', '3D', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', '3D', 'bigger', 'life', 'scenes', 'film', 'exciting', 'storyline', 'had', 'hold', 'son', 'seat', 'times', 'numerous', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movie.Speaking', 'exciting', 'character', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'shrinking', 'violet', 'story', 'not', 'waiting', 'prince', 'save', 'tale', 'sweet', 'pie', 'tough', 'cookie', 'who', 'fights', 'evil', 'better', 'solider', 'Everyone', 'will', 'love', 'intricate', 'things', 'Rapunzel', 'piles', 'hair', 'using', 'elevator', 'turning', 'kind', 'fighting', 'weapon', 'imaginable', 'traditional', 'story', 'setting', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'modern', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'princess', 'who', 'love', 'not', 'prince', 'bad', 'boy', 'good', 'heart.I', 'son', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Tangled', 'predict', 'when', 'movie', 'November', '24th', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'will', 'become', 'new', 'reigning', 'queen', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'Disney', 'were', 'smart', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'should', 'buy', 'rights', 'Willow', 'Smith', 'new', 'tween', 'pop', 'song', 'Whip', 'My', 'Hair', 'use', 'marketing', 'Tangled']",N/A

When I saw the trailer for it I thought ""Oh great, another boring princess movie"".  To me, tangled looked like it was cheesy and not worth my time.  Boy was I wrong!  Ok, what made me want to see Tangled was when they begin to advertise that it was available on DVD and Blue-ray and they would show Repunzel getting coverd by all her hair with only her eyes being visible.  So, finally I broke down and bought the movie and now I love it!!The story is great and Repunzel (played wonderfully by Mandy Moore) isn't your typical disney princess.  She's not some air-head bimbo waiting for a charming prince to come rescue her.  In fact, that's not even important to her.  What is important to her however, is that she be able to see the beautiful ""stars"" that are seen only on her birthday.  And seeing as her 18th birthay is the next day, she wants for her mother to let her out of the tower so she can finally see the ""stars"" up close for the first time.  But her mother who is actually the evil Mother Gothel (played by Donna Murphy) won't hear of it.  And the reason she won't let her go is because if she lets Repunzel go, she'll lose her youth because its Repunzel's long, flowing, golden hair, that keeps her young.So enter Flynn Rider (played by Chucks Zack Levi) a self-absorbed jerk who thinks the world revolves around him.  One day as fate would have it, he's running through the forest trying to keep two thugs who are chasing him; from getting their hands on a crown that's hidden in his satchel.  While trying to run from the two thugs, he comes upon Repunzel's tower although he doesn't know it, and climbs into the tower to get away from his pursuers.  Where he is whacked on the head by a frying pan.  When he finally comes to, he realizes that he's tied to a chair with long golden hair.  And understandably, he freaks.  At that point he confronted by Repunzel the one whose hair holds him captive. Once Repunzel realized that Flynn is not after her golden hair she agrees to let hiim go on one condition: that he gets her out of the tower and takes her to see the ""stars"" that appear every year on her bithday.  She tells that if he does this for her, she'll give him back his satchel; he agrees.  And what starts out as a matter of convenience for both, soon becomes a journey of self-discovery and personal growth.I love Repunzel, she has spunk and is full of energy.  And although she's naive she soon learns how to think for herself and to become her own person.  And Flynn Rider who is a jerk in the beginning, learns to think of others instead of always thinking of himself.  He also learns what true love is, and the meaning sacrifice.  And I must not forget Pascal (Repunzel's pet cameleon) and Maximus (Flynn Rider's horse).  They still show sometimes and you can't help but love them.  I mean this movie has everything, beautiful music, great songs, and amazing backgrounds.  And here's one more neat bit of info, all the actors do their own singing and they all do a wonderful job in my opinion. And hey, who knew Zack Levi could sing!!  I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, if want to know how Tangled ends; you'll have to see the movie for yourself.

1406054,A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,B004G6009K,G. Max Gooding,"[2, 3]","Background:Tangled has its origins from the German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.It was first published in 1812 as part of a collection of children's tales. It is believed that this story was an adaptation from a fairy tale called Persinette by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force which was originally published in 1698. It is a story that has been beaten to a pulp, and is best know for the line: ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair"".Even further back, this story may seem to be a modified feminized version of the Biblical story of Samson as related to in the book of Judges chapter 13. Here because Samson was a Nazarite a razor was never allowed to touch his hair.Marketing and Sales:This film was originally titled and marketed as Rapunzel, however, at the last minute the name was changed to Tangled. It is the second most expensive film ever made and most expensive animated film ever made with a budget of $260 million. Tangled is also notable for being the third-highest grossing animated film in the Disney animated canon (unadjusted for inflation), behind The Lion King ($783,841,776) and Aladdin ($504,050,219).Overview:Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is just about to turn 18 years old. She wants a special gift, to go outside of the tower that she has been in for her entire life. Her mother, Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) buntly refuses. As an alternative, she asks for more paint (she paints as one of her many past times in the tower). Mother Gothel agrees to go for it, but it's a 3-days journey away.While she is away, Rapunzel manages to strike up a bargain with Flynn Rider, a thief on the run (voiced by Zachery Levi). At this point her voyage to the outside world begins.Rating:It is quite surprising that this 100 minute animated feature has been given a rating of PG instead of G. In my opinion this may be due to the emotional and psychological content that Mother Gothel generates by her deceptive and manipulative relationship with Rapunzel. (since there is no nudity or offensive language in this film)Plot:Gothel observes a single drop of pure sunlight hit the ground, creating a magical flower with the ability to heal the sick and injured, as well as keep someone young by singing to it. Centuries past as she maintains her youth. Until the pregnant queen of a nearby kingdom gets sick. Her guards manage to retrieve the flower and make a broth out of it. The queen is healed, however, as a side-effect, her daugther is born with hair with the same magical properties.Gothel realises this and kidnaps the child and raises her as her own.

She keeps the girl in the tower, saying she is her loving mother and wants to protect the girl from the terrible outside world but as Rapunzel reaches her 18th birthday she longs to step outside just to feel grass under her feet.Into this comes Flynn. not exactly prince charming he's a fast talking thief and con man on the run from his former partners whom he left in a tight spot.  He agrees to help her out of the tower and well...Disney magic follows. It is great to look at. The characters are better developed than the usual 2 dimensional characters and the writing might be a little much for small children. But I enjoyed it, EXCEPT for the songs. They were too many, too repetitive and didn't stand out. All too often the score came I just thought of Little Mermaid or Pocahantas Lite. The only one that really worked was `mother knows best' as the hag justifies keeping Rapunzel locked up but that got old fast. Also there are too many songs early on and I found myself reaching for the remote to fast forward. Even a pythonesque routine with thugs singing and dancing about their dreams didn't hold me.In the end this is a fun Disney film that is a wonder to look at and gives a novel twist to an old fairy tale, just be prepared to skim over the songs.",4,Great toon let down by unremarkable score,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,1630,"['great', 'tale', 'Disney', 'great', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'look', 'songs', 'seem', 'drag', 'down', 'whole', 'affair', 'being', 'unremarkable', 'boring.A', 'variation', 'Rapunzel', 'where', 'lost', 'princess', 'locked', 'up', 'tower', 'evil', 'hag', 'altered', 'little', 'saying', 'magical', 'hair', 'can', 'heal', 'sick', 'hag', 'stay', 'eternally', 'young', 'girl', 'tower', 'saying', 'loving', 'mother', 'protect', 'girl', 'terrible', 'outside', 'world', 'Rapunzel', '18th', 'birthday', 'step', 'outside', 'just', 'feel', 'grass', 'feet.Into', 'Flynn', 'not', 'exactly', 'prince', 'charming', 'fast', 'talking', 'thief', 'con', 'man', 'run', 'former', 'partners', 'whom', 'left', 'tight', 'spot', 'help', 'tower', 'well', 'Disney', 'magic', 'great', 'look', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'developed', 'usual', '2', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'writing', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'much', 'small', 'children', 'enjoyed', 'EXCEPT', 'songs', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'too', 'repetitive', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'too', 'often', 'score', 'came', 'just', 'thought', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Pocahantas', 'Lite', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'worked', 'was', 'mother', 'best', 'hag', 'justifies', 'keeping', 'Rapunzel', 'locked', 'up', 'got', 'old', 'fast', 'Also', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'songs', 'early', 'found', 'reaching', 'remote', 'fast', 'forward', 'Even', 'pythonesque', 'routine', 'thugs', 'singing', 'dancing', 'dreams', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'me.In', 'end', 'fun', 'Disney', 'film', 'wonder', 'look', 'novel', 'twist', 'old', 'fairy', 'tale', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'skim', 'songs']",N/A
1406058,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B004G6009K,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[4, 5]","Rumors of the end of the Disney Princess movies, to paraphrase Mark Twain, ""have been highly exaggerated."" Tangled proved it by being a huge theatrical hit. Part fairy tale, part musical, part romantic comedy, somehow it all came together despite a long, difficult history of behind-the-scenes changes and rearranges, including giving the film a ""hip"" title instead of Rapunzel (or as it was known in one incarnation, Rapunzel Unbraided).When the Tangled trailers originally aired, I was apprehensive because of the title change and the skewed trailers with their blaring pop music tracks. Would it be a spoofy, Shrek-y send up? Would Rapunzel herself be the tough-talking ""today"" lady so common in recent animation? Would it end with a boogie dancing '80s top-40 chestnut?I needn't have been concerned. Tangled turns out to be a Disney fairy tale in the classic sense that straddles the difficult line between ""straight"" storytelling, screwball comedy, romance and yes, even a little suspense -- because, like Cinderella, we know it's all going to be fine but we want to see how it works out.And speaking of Cinderella, there has never been a Disney animated film with a more complicated villain than Mother Gothel since the Stepmother in Cinderella (Cruella and Madame Medusa are close contenders). The evil is all about psychological abuse, the manipulation of a person into submission that is so effective that the victim is compelled to sustain it, even though they yearn for more.How many of us have experienced, or know someone who has experienced, a situation in which we are led to believe that we're ""lucky to be here"" or ""better off than the alternative"" by a person or a group who knows your true worth but conceals it by convincing you you're not capable otherwise? Who hasn't had the boss/parent/partner/friend who criticized you so much you started to believe you really were worthless? I was astounded to see this complex dynamic dealt with in a Disney animated film.Both Rapunzel and Flynn have self-doubt but they trod on anyway. They didn't start out contemptuously loathing each other the way couples do in way too many films nowadays, either. Their character arcs were the most plausible we'd seen since Beauty and the Beast.The Alan Menken/Glenn Slater songs were not tossed in at random just to fill up an album or make a great theme park number (though they probably would), but because they had a crucial book requirement. They all served the story -- and I've Got a Dream"" was the funniest number since ""Gaston.""Often when the story was just about to approach a clich&eacute;, there was a gag or twist that punctured it. And the horse -- Maximus -- stole every scene.Animation-wise, there was a hand-drawn quality to the expressions that I don't recall in most CG films, especially in the more human-styled characters. In his commentary on Toy Story 3, Lee Unkrich said there had been huge strides in CG humans and clearly both films were able to benefit.Tangled didn't make me get all misty eyed the way that Toy Story 3 did, but it was, in tone, more of a grand epic romp overall. I liked it much more than I thought I would. My wife and kids loved it.The Blu-ray is truly dazzling, making full use of meticulous detail, design and color. The DVD does not contain as many bonus features as the Blu-ray, but there aren't all that many anyway. One highlight is a segment in which lead voice actors Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi breeze through a lighthearted trivia trek which includes a quick rundown of all 50 Disney animated features (a list that has, historically, changed a little bit over the years).There seemed to be no doubt that Mandy Moore was a perfect fit for the singing and acting duties of playing a Disney princess. The surprise is Levi, who has far more range than he often is allowed to display on TV. Clearly he has more stage experience than the unpretentious persona evidenced in various appearances. He even has a decent singing voice.Like Mickey Mouse, who started it all, the fairy tale is the heart of Disney storytelling. They can and should stretch and go outside the box but they should never totally abandon the core form. Nobody does it better.

They've been making quality, family-friendly movies since 1937 and still going strong. View it in 3-D. It's so worth it.The movie begins with a clip of Mickey Mouse in ""Steamboat Willie"" then the camera pans back to show Mickey in the 0 for ""Walt Disney's 50th Animated Feature."" Very good reference to the past.The story is based on the fairy tale ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, and the film was originally titled ""Rapunzel"" but changed by the studio to lure boys in. Not a bad move, marketing-wise, but Disney should have kept the original title.Biblically-speaking, there is no swearing or sex (it's A DISNEY movie, people!! What would you expect other than singing, dancing, good old-fashioned fun and clean humor?). There is some mild violence, but it's handled discreetly, and it's usually comic (though there are some frightening scenes for little ones). ***BEGIN SPOILER*** One scene towards the end is adapted straight from the fairy tale, in which Rapunzel heals the Prince through her tears and his sight is restored (after he's blinded by falling into thorn bushes while jumping from the tower in rage at not finding Rapunzel there). Obviously, Disney changed it a bit to make it more family-friendly, but still, parents should still be there to reassure their little ones, AND never does the movie pretend to be anything more than a fairy tale (ie. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" etc).***END SPOILER***Alan Menken, the Academy Award winning composer of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty And The Beast,"" wrote the songs for the film. My personal favourite song is ""I See The Light""; a very heartwarming and romantic ballad that conjures up the ballroom scene from ""Beauty And The Beast."" All the songs, though, are equally enchanting and fun. Pascal reminds me of a certain Caribbean crab. This film is reminiscent of the Disney films we know and love. I highly recommend it; the perfect film either for a date night, a family movie night or just for your own  entertainment. The casting and production values are simply amazing, just what you would expect from a top-notch Disney production. The soundtrack is also Tangamazing.

1406066,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B004G6009K,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","In Disney's long line of animated feature films, Mother Gothel just may be its most passive aggressive big bad. It's interesting to note that Mother Gothel, for a witch, doesn't really exhibit much magical mojo. Instead she manipulates people by applying that vile eldritch technique popularly known as psychology. To me, this makes her more memorable. I think guilt trips and ego tilting are more deadly than dragons and ogres.""Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens. And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower. It had the ability to heal the sick and injured."" It's how the fairy tale begins. Except that Mother Gothel, selfish witch, got to it first and proceeded to harvest the petals to rejuvenate her youth. When the Queen of the land falls ill during her pregnancy, a desperate search unearths the golden flower. The Queen's health improves dramatically and she gives birth to a baby daughter whose hair unfurls long and golden and imbued with the enchanted flower's properties. Mother Gothel, an opportunist, promptly steals away with the baby. So it happens that, each year after, on their vanished child's birthday, the king and queen and all in the kingdom loose thousands of floating lantern lights into the night sky in hopes that they would guide the lost princess back home. Crazy thing, many years would elapse, but this far-fetched, wistful plan actually will work.In a remote forest, confined in a hidden tower, Rapunzel gazes out each day, dreaming big dreams, open to adventure, longing to see the world. Obedient child that she is, Rapunzel heeds her mother's behest that she not venture outside, the world being too perilous for the likes of her. For years Rapunzel has made the best of it, carving out her own little world but marveling, always marveling, at the mysterious floating lights which emerge each year on her birthday. On her eighteenth birthday, her hope is that her mother will at last allow her a measure of freedom. It's cramped in that tower, what with her 70-foot-long tresses taking up a lot of room. Her hair has never been cut, lest it loses its uncanny properties.""Flower, gleam and glow, let your power shine. Make the clock reverse. Bring back what once was mine... what once was mine."" It's what her mother, Mother Gothel, croons to her whenever she visits Rapunzel at the tower, combing her hair. It doesn't enter Rapunzel's thoughts that Mother Gothel fosters ulterior motives. Why would she? But there's a rebellious streak in Rapunzel. And when the dashing (but vain) bandit Eugene Fritzherbert - er, Flynn Rider stumbles onto her tower, she seizes this opportunity to embark on a forbidden road trip, with Flynn Rider serving as her guide. She hopes to track down the source of those floating lights.Disney did us a solid by trotting out TANGLED for its milestone 50th animated film. This is an instant classic, a top notch animated tale with something for the kids and the grown-ups. I think I'm past the stage of going gaga over Disney or Pixar's animated virtuosity. Nowadays, I expect it. Still, the fabulous scene in which our leads are on a boat watching the rise of the lantern lights is one of the most moving and spectacular moments Disney has ever produced. And you have to laud the work that the animators put into making Rapunzel's expressive hair come to life. The laughs come plenty, with Rapunzel's animal friends predictably delivering much of the humor, although Zachary Levi, who voices Flynn Rider, occasionally contributes an arch one-liner, including the bit about the smolder. Broadway vet Donna Murphy is very good as Mother Gothel who alternates from faux cheeriness to openly manipulative. Another fun character is Maximus, the proud and tenacious Royal Guard's stallion. You have to admire how this dedicated steed goes above and beyond to apprehend the wanted Flynn Rider. There's also a shy chameleon lizard who tries to look after Rapunzel.Mandy Moore anchors the movie. She's tremendous in inhabiting the role of Rapunzel; her voice is ideally suited to playing a high-spirited and inquisitive Disney princess (a princess who swings a mean frying pan). I'm probably dissing Mandy Moore's live action r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but this may be the most disarming performance she's done in cinema. Sorry, Mandy.For all its hip sensibilities, TANGLED still clings to Disney's traditional themes, which I think is a good move. Too much adult snarkiness could've undermined the sweetness and the heart of the story. And this story does have heart, to go along with a sweet, relatable romance, Mother Gothel's showstopping tune ""Mother Knows Best,"" wet wi11ies, a pack of Viking ruffians to stir the plot whenever it threatens to bog down, and a thoughtful curveball ending. And a broken smolder.This single disc's extra features (and it's not much): ""Original Storybook Openings"" - two different versions of the film's prologue; and ""50th Animated Feature Countdown"" -

1406083,A2CL75941NO9W4,B004G6009K,Jason C,"[5, 11]","To get to the point. What worked: the look. This film is gorgeous, particularly on Blu-Ray! The villain: Mother Gothel is the most manipulative of any Disney or Pixar character, awesome. You WANT to see her go down and it's satisfying when she does. The female empowerment stuff: Rapunzel is definitely the hero of this film, and only rarely is she annoying. The ending: excellent, surprisingly emotionally affecting. The Blu-Ray version is beautiful, but animation isn't the best place to show-case HD.What didn't work: the songs. A grand total of only two songs were firing on all cylinders, the best of which is ""Rapunzel Knows Best"" about 58 minutes in. Almost none of them came together that well, a real disappointment in an integral part of any animated Disney movie. The humor: intermittent at best. You'll chuckle, but don't expect consistent laughter if you're an adult viewer. The plot: incredibly simplistic, don't worry about having to use your brain at any point. The sidekick: that stupid, pointless gecko. You can always rely on Disney's dogged determination for every protagonist to have a sidekick.

1406092,A1FSLE0YF3BKVQ,B004G6009K,Jeannie Tran,"[3, 5]","I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would. From the previews it had a very Shrek feel about it, with the 3D animation and adult humor. While I enjoyed Shrek, when I think of a Disney cartoon my mind immediately goes to the 'Renaissance' movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and The Lion King and the wonderful warm and fuzzy feelings attributed to watching those movies. I have been waiting a long time for the return of those warm fuzzies. Princess and the Frog was an ok movie, but not anywhere near `Renaissance' quality. So when I heard Disney was doing Rapunzel my hopes soared... and crashed when I saw the previews. But the previews were very misleading; even the movie poster tricks you. She's not mischievous as her smirk implies; she's quite nave and sweet. I wouldn't put Tangled in the `Renaissance' category, but I liked the film a lot and laughed for about an hour and half.Mother Gothel is awesomely evil. She plays mind games with Rapunzel, making her believe everyone is out to capture her for her magical powers and the only way for her to be safe is to remain in the tower. She doesn't hurt Rapunzel and actually takes quite good care of her, making meals she enjoys and buys paints for her murals. But psychological evil is so much more formidable than a poison apple or time-sensitive curse. And really, who doesn't to want to remain young and beautiful? Flynn the bandit is a charming narcissist who only looks after number one, until he meets Rapunzel and can only seem to look at her. He has great one-liners, scruff, and knee-high boots. Pretty much the perfect man. And Rapunzel fits in well with the other Disney Princesses - pretty, kind, and innocent but with a streak of sass. Poor sartorial choices though.I thought the animation would bother me but I can see why they chose to go that route. There's a lot of hair swinging and flying around that was enhanced by the 3Dness, although it did give the people very plastic-looking faces. One thing that did bother me about this movie was the length of her hair seemed to be really inconsistent. At times it appeared to be crazy long, wrapping around and around in the tower in a dozen loops. Other times it seemed to only trail about a few feet behind her, and at one point it gets braided up in a plait that doesn't even hit the floor.There aren't any annoying animals, in fact, Rapunzel's little chameleon sidekick is quite the little scene stealer. His facial expressions and gestures are hilarious and adorable. Tangled is fun, humorous, and all around entertaining. It could have been great if the musical numbers were more memorable. In my heart I keep wishing for another ""Part of Your World"" or ""One Jump Ahead,"" but I think it's time to accept that the `Renaissance' era has ended.[...]",4,Tangled,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,2788,"['liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'previews', 'had', 'very', 'Shrek', 'feel', '3D', 'animation', 'adult', 'humor', 'enjoyed', 'Shrek', 'when', 'think', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'mind', 'immediately', ""'Renaissance"", 'movies', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Aladdin', 'Lion', 'King', 'wonderful', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feelings', 'attributed', 'watching', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'long', 'time', 'return', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'not', 'anywhere', 'Renaissance', 'quality', 'when', 'heard', 'Disney', 'was', 'doing', 'Rapunzel', 'hopes', 'soared', 'crashed', 'when', 'saw', 'previews', 'previews', 'were', 'very', 'misleading', 'even', 'movie', 'poster', 'tricks', 'not', 'mischievous', 'smirk', 'implies', 'quite', 'nave', 'sweet', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'Tangled', 'Renaissance', 'category', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'laughed', 'hour', 'half.Mother', 'Gothel', 'awesomely', 'evil', 'mind', 'games', 'Rapunzel', 'making', 'believe', 'everyone', 'out', 'capture', 'magical', 'powers', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'safe', 'remain', 'tower', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Rapunzel', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'care', 'making', 'meals', 'paints', 'murals', 'psychological', 'evil', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'formidable', 'poison', 'apple', 'time-sensitive', 'curse', 'really', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'remain', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Flynn', 'bandit', 'charming', 'narcissist', 'who', 'only', 'number', 'one', 'Rapunzel', 'can', 'only', 'seem', 'look', 'great', 'one-liners', 'scruff', 'knee-high', 'boots', 'Pretty', 'much', 'perfect', 'man', 'Rapunzel', 'fits', 'well', 'other', 'Disney', 'Princesses', 'pretty', 'kind', 'innocent', 'streak', 'sass', 'Poor', 'sartorial', 'choices', 'thought', 'animation', 'would', 'bother', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'chose', 'go', 'route', 'lot', 'hair', 'swinging', 'flying', 'was', 'enhanced', '3Dness', 'did', 'give', 'people', 'very', 'plastic-looking', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'bother', 'movie', 'was', 'length', 'hair', 'seemed', 'be', 'really', 'inconsistent', 'times', 'appeared', 'be', 'crazy', 'long', 'wrapping', 'around', 'around', 'tower', 'dozen', 'loops', 'Other', 'times', 'seemed', 'only', 'trail', 'few', 'feet', 'one', 'point', 'braided', 'up', 'plait', ""n't"", 'even', 'hit', 'floor.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'animals', 'fact', 'Rapunzel', 'little', 'chameleon', 'sidekick', 'quite', 'little', 'scene', 'stealer', 'facial', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'are', 'hilarious', 'adorable', 'Tangled', 'fun', 'humorous', 'entertaining', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'were', 'more', 'memorable', 'heart', 'keep', 'wishing', 'Part', 'Your', 'World', 'One', 'Jump', 'Ahead', 'think', 'time', 'accept', 'Renaissance', 'era', 'ended.', '[', ']']",N/A

I just never liked them. Of course, I was never the target market for most of them, as I am not a little girl with aspirations of becoming a princess and being wooed by prince charming. I realize this, and have conceded that most of the stuff my girls are going to watch is going to be really sappy and painful for me to endure. However, I have to say I was really surprised by how entertaining Tangled was. From start to finish the Animation and voice acting is exciting and funny. The delivery of the lines is witty, and all of the characters are really well developed. The plot is entertaining and there is some action but it's pretty mild for the most part. There is one scene at the end that I won't mention here but I had some issues with my girls seeing it and had to do a lot of explaining over it, but other than that it seemed suitable for small children. Really though the most exciting part for me is the fact that I actually enjoyed watching it. I get the songs stuck in my head which is amazing because usually the songs are the worst part for me to watch. Overall I am happy to have something my girls and I can both watch and enjoy. My oldest daughter wants to watch this movie every day and if we didn't limit her TV I'm certain she would just have it playing all the time. She likes other princess movies, but none of them as much as this one, although that could just be because Daddy actually enjoys watching it with her. I would recommend this for anyone with little girls who want to be princesses and if you're lucky, they'll like this more than most of the other ones that make me want to vomit.",5,Review from a father of two little girls,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,1757,"['Okay', 'remember', 'watching', 'Disney', 'movies', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'aside', 'maybe', 'Aladdin', 'Lion', 'King', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'awful', 'just', 'never', 'liked', 'course', 'was', 'never', 'target', 'market', 'most', 'am', 'not', 'little', 'girl', 'aspirations', 'becoming', 'princess', 'being', 'wooed', 'prince', 'charming', 'realize', 'have', 'conceded', 'most', 'stuff', 'girls', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'sappy', 'painful', 'endure', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'entertaining', 'was', 'start', 'finish', 'Animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'exciting', 'funny', 'delivery', 'lines', 'witty', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'developed', 'plot', 'entertaining', 'action', 'pretty', 'mild', 'most', 'part', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'here', 'had', 'issues', 'girls', 'seeing', 'had', 'do', 'lot', 'explaining', 'other', 'seemed', 'suitable', 'small', 'children', 'Really', 'most', 'exciting', 'part', 'fact', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'get', 'songs', 'stuck', 'head', 'amazing', 'usually', 'songs', 'are', 'worst', 'part', 'watch', 'Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'something', 'girls', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'watch', 'movie', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'limit', 'TV', ""'m"", 'certain', 'would', 'just', 'have', 'playing', 'time', 'other', 'princess', 'movies', 'none', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'because', 'Daddy', 'actually', 'watching', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'princesses', ""'re"", 'lucky', ""'ll"", 'like', 'more', 'most', 'other', 'ones', 'make', 'want', 'vomit']",N/A

That may have been a slight mistake as it does wash out the color impact of the film but I do appreciate how far 3-D technology has come.While Tangled was probably a very smart balancing act between emotional depth and quick-paced breezy comedy to keep the kid's attention I left the theater feeling there was a missed opportunity.  Although there is probably a strong cross-pollination between DreamWorks and PIXAR now, I'd love to know what a PIXAR screenplay could have looked like.  Something darker, maybe even Shakespearian (with an up-beat ending), could have created a true CGI classic (although Toy Story 3 was getting close).The simple incorporation of some true emotional problems experienced by anyone locked in a tower for 18 years by a self-serving witch could have been a step off in a totally different direction... but, yes, it's hard to sell dolls that way.  If Mother Gothel in the original story was a kind of witch-for-hire then what if Rapunzel were a witch-for-hire-in-training?  This would be her excuse to have a mission to leave the tower, even if it wasn't technically authorized.  Madcap mayhem, cold terror, and redemptive love would ensue.While comparisons with Aladdin, Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, are obvious and relevant, this was in many ways a much more intimate film.  The entire film was based around the initially divergent interests of three people, and other than a very short production number in a bar and an equally short and spontaneous dance in the village square there were no big crowd scenes having to do with oddly dancing to choreography or carrying pitch forks and torches.Unfortunately it's hard to appreciate the subtleties of all aspects of the animation in one viewing pass and there are certainly things to appreciate in Tangled that can easily be missed the first time around.

It is more than a Disney update of a classic fairy tale, it is a complete reworking.  The original story by The Brother's Grimm is only 3  pages in length.  As you can imagine, a lot had to be added to make it into a 140 minute move.  What was added makes the story considerably more exciting than the original, with an action scene that Indiana Jones would be proud of; in fact it looks a lot like a similar scene from Raiders.  The villainess is one of the vilest characters in Disney history, while the heroine is one of the most vulnerable and loveable.  The hero is a typical anti-hero that turns good for the sake of love, but who can blame him; Rapunzel is absolutely charming.  The scene with the floating lanterns is gorgeous.  Even the animal characters are perfect, as good those in Cinderella.

So I knew nothing at all about this other than it was a Disney movie.  Nothing online, hadn't heard anyone talk about it, I mean it was an absolute null to me. But I generally really like Disney and Pixar movies, so when I came across it, I had to see it with my 7 year old.To say I was blown away would be putting it mildly.  I didn't know Mandy Moore did the voice, but as soon as the first song started, I recognized it straight off.  Same with Zachary Levi.  Now Mandy I could see, since I've loved her voice ever since I saw A Walk to Remember.  Zachary was a surprise, having known him only from the series Chuck, I never thought of him as a voice actor.And after seeing the movie a few times, I can't picture any other choices doing as good of a job.  They both do an outstanding job of emoting.  Both in the songs and in the dialog, the inflections are just absolutely perfect.  Her squeak when she first hits him.  His ""Surrounded by enormous piles of money"" in the ""I've Got a Dream"" song...  The way her voice shifted so well in her bipolar scene...  It was the little touches like that which put this movie right to the top for me.Songs?  I had to buy the soundtrack and it's all my son wants to listen to now, whether on the TV (I use a media center PC for my TV so it's all available), on the computer, or on the ipod in the car.  We're singing tangled songs all over the place.  I found these songs to be my all time favorites now from any of the animated musicals.  I never thought they'd get anyone to shine better in their musical animations than Jodi Benson (hope I spelled that right) from the Little Mermaid, but Mandy Moore nailed it.  Songs are incredibly rich and have a lot of depth musically, and as always, are hilarious and very, very enjoyable.  Even the score for the rest of the movie was great, and I crank the music from the dancing scene when I'm driving around too, great stuff.The animation was wonderful, and the job they did with her hair, as well as the horse's expressions (as someone else mentioned in a review, the horse is a riot), and Pascal, the Chameleon...  Was everything that Disney is known for when they're doing their jobs well.Another review also mentioned the poor marketing job and such, which I guess I can attest to at a different level, as I had not noticed anything at ALL about it until March 2011 here, a few weeks ago.  But despite that, this has shot right to my number one animated movie...  And I never thought I'd see ANYTHING supplant that spot for my 7 year old, above Cars and Wall-E...  But this one did for both of us.Great movie for all ages, and hopefully a sign that Disney is solidly back on track.",5,The best movie I never heard of,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,2776,"['do', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'trailers', 'TV', 'time', 'shift', 'everything', 'fast', 'forward', 'commercials', 'So', 'knew', 'nothing', 'other', 'was', 'Disney', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'online', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'anyone', 'talk', 'mean', 'was', 'absolute', 'null', 'generally', 'really', 'like', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'when', 'came', 'had', 'see', '7', 'year', 'say', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'putting', 'mildly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'did', 'voice', 'as', 'soon', 'first', 'song', 'started', 'recognized', 'straight', 'off', 'Same', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'Now', 'Mandy', 'could', 'see', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'voice', 'ever', 'saw', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'Zachary', 'was', 'surprise', 'having', 'known', 'only', 'series', 'Chuck', 'never', 'thought', 'voice', 'actor.And', 'seeing', 'movie', 'few', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'other', 'choices', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'emoting', 'songs', 'dialog', 'inflections', 'are', 'just', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'squeak', 'when', 'first', 'Surrounded', 'enormous', 'piles', 'money', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Dream', 'song', 'way', 'voice', 'shifted', 'so', 'well', 'bipolar', 'scene', 'was', 'little', 'touches', 'put', 'movie', 'right', 'top', 'me.Songs', 'had', 'buy', 'soundtrack', 'son', 'listen', 'now', 'TV', 'use', 'media', 'center', 'PC', 'TV', 'available', 'computer', 'ipod', 'car', ""'re"", 'singing', 'tangled', 'songs', 'place', 'found', 'songs', 'be', 'time', 'favorites', 'now', 'animated', 'musicals', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'anyone', 'shine', 'better', 'musical', 'animations', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'hope', 'spelled', 'right', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'nailed', 'Songs', 'are', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'have', 'lot', 'depth', 'musically', 'always', 'are', 'hilarious', 'very', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'Even', 'score', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'crank', 'music', 'dancing', 'scene', 'when', ""'m"", 'driving', 'around', 'too', 'great', 'stuff.The', 'animation', 'was', 'wonderful', 'job', 'did', 'hair', 'as', 'well', 'horse', 'expressions', 'someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'review', 'horse', 'riot', 'Pascal', 'Chameleon', 'Was', 'everything', 'Disney', 'known', 'when', ""'re"", 'doing', 'jobs', 'well.Another', 'review', 'also', 'mentioned', 'poor', 'marketing', 'job', 'such', 'guess', 'can', 'attest', 'different', 'level', 'had', 'not', 'noticed', 'anything', 'March', '2011', 'here', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'shot', 'right', 'number', 'one', 'animated', 'movie', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'ANYTHING', 'supplant', 'spot', '7', 'year', 'old', 'Cars', 'Wall-E', 'one', 'did', 'us.Great', 'movie', 'ages', 'hopefully', 'sign', 'Disney', 'solidly', 'back', 'track']",N/A

1406125,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B004G6009K,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[28, 71]","Disney animation certainly hasn't been what it used to be. After a share of mediocre to bad animated movies, they churned out an instant classic with the traditionally animated THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. But that film didn't catch on with the public as much as it should have (of course being released around the same time as the mega-super hit AVATAR didn't help matters either). Blaming the underperformance of their film on an assumption that boys were turned off by the phrase ""princess"", Disney decided to rename their subsequent feature, RAPUNZEL, a similar fairy tale in digital 3-D CGI. This name change is something that I still can't shake my head over. I realize the motivation was to try and attract more people, but c'mon, TANGLED? Sounds more like self-parody if you ask me!As expected, RAPUNZEL -- OK, OK, TANGLED -- is a very loose retelling of the famous Brother's Grimm tale. The title character is a young woman with the largest amount of golden hair imaginable shut away in a tower deep in the forest. Her only guardian is Mother Gothel, who stole the child away from her parents when she was very young. Rapunzel's hair has magic powers; it can heal cuts and make even a centuries-old being still appear young. It is for this latter reason that Gothel keeps Rapunzel captive, although of course our blonde heroine is told by her ""mother"" that the world is a dark and scary place and that she should stay in the tower. (If this doesn't give you echoings of Disney's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, then what will?) Of course, Rapunzel years to explore the outside world, namely to attend the ""festival of lights"" held once a year on her birthday. One day, Flynn Rider, a runaway thief who has just stolen a jeweled crown, sneaks into the tower to hide. Knocking him out cold with a frying pan, Rapunzel forces Flynn to take her to the Festival in exchange for the stolen crown. At first Flynn tries to weasel his way out of the deal, but as he falls in love with her, his motives naturally change. But Mother Gothel wants Rapunzel back at all costs....There are many moments when TANGLED truly shines, mainly anything involving genuine heart or magic. In the latter half of the film there is a breathtaking moment where glowing lanterns literally float up into the night sky while Rapunzel and Flynn sing the obligatory love song, ""I See The Light"". This is a truly colorful and imaginative sequence that ranks among the best at Disney. Similarly inspiring is when Rapunzel uses her enchanted hair to heal a cut on Flynn's hand. And the last half hour offers some powerful drama and heartbreaking emotion on the way to its happy ending (surprise).Arguably the triumph of the film is Mother Gothel, who ranks as one of Disney's finest villains in a long time. She has shades of Lady Tremaine from Cinderella, but there is also a little bit of Frollo from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. She's selfish, manipulative, greedy, and deceptive in every way imaginable. The dynamic between her and Rapunzel is both one of the strongest points of the movie and reminds one of the Witch/Rapunzel relationship from Steven Sondheim's dark fairy tale musical INTO THE WOODS. In fact, Gothel's signature song, ""Mother Knows Best"", one of many to be written for this film by Alan Menken, is strangely reminiscent of a Sondheim song. (The score is another highlight of TANGLED; Menken's songs are very pleasing to the ear, with some emerging as true stand-outs.Unfortunately TANGLED falls short of Disney classic status for the following reasons. One of them is the overemphasis on slapstick comedy for much of the first two-thirds of the film. Most of this consists of Flynn getting whacked around by Rapunzel's frying pan, comical sight gags, and Looney Tunes style goofiness. This gets pretty tiresome quickly after every five seconds. Other sources of comedy comes from Rapunzel's chameleon sidekick, Pascal, as well as a gang of burly bandits who break into song at one point in the film. Both are absolutely useless in that they don't contribute anything valuable to the plot. The bandits, in particular, only show up in one scene that by the time they reappear again toward the finale, I forgot who they were! Pascal seems to be mostly the typical Disney cartoon sidekick intended to provide laughs and/or lure kids into the theater, because that's exactly what he functions as. He doesn't even do anything during the finale.As far as the lead characters are concerned, Rapunzel is an appealing enough heroine, free-spirited and alternatingly schizophrenic (her various mood swings when she ventures out of the tower for the first time, for instance), while Flynn starts off as a smug, self-centered rogue who has a change of heart as he learns about Rapunzel's past. But while they both have a solid chemistry, there isn't enough of it in the film to emerge as emotionally impactful as it could have been. (Consequently, the climactic moments of the film, while otherwise very strong, don't resonate as dramatically as they would have with better realized leads.)Had the comedy level been cranked down by several notches and the story much tighter, TANGLED would truly be worthy of being Disney's 50th animated feature. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG was a much better production to earn that status. I did enjoy TANGLED overall, but I don't think it's one of Disney's greatest.",3,"Some magical moments, but no match for Disney's better films.",1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,5371,"['Disney',

1406140,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B004G6009K,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[5, 6]","TANGLED, the latest animated film by those clever Disney folks, is an updated take on the classic tale of Rapunzel.  I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law.  And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here.  However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century.  Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner.  She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is.  As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed.  And along the way, they and the ""prince"" end up helping each other.  These are the role models I want for my kids!The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent.  Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well.  Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well.  The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters.

1406155,A3OJJ7NEM84WAD,B004G6009K,"Kenneth Mark Hoover ""opinionated book worm""","[2, 6]","The story of Rapunzel is one of my favorite Grimms' fairy tale. The original story and many of its variations are quite dark. In the original story the prince calls for Rapunzel to let down her hair and sees her on the sly. One day she lets slip that her dress is getting too tight around her waist. (She's pregnant.) Gothel, the woman who kidnapped Rapunzel, traps the prince when he returns. He falls from the tower and lands in thorns, either blinding him or killing him outright depending on which cultural interpretation you read.Now I don't expect Disney to tell a story like that. It is Disney after all and the lost princess must remain virginal - while at the same time having an unusually close relationship with the animals around her. And, yes, the guy she loves in Tangled undergoes a life-changing (literally!) experience in the end. But for all that, I didn't like this movie as much. And I wanted to like it because as a writer I see a lot of potential in the basic story of Rapunzel. Rapunzel empoweredFirst, this movie came apart for me at the level of the story. There were good parts to it, but overall the story didn't do it for me. I liked many elements but once again I felt as if I was watching another formulaic effort from Disney. Captured/lonely princess. Check. Evil grandmother/stepmother. Check. Funny and helpful animals. Check.  Handsome single man comes into her life. Check. Beautiful background and story boardinng. Check. But there has to be more than that. We've seen all this before. There has to be a story that grabs us. We're not all eleven year old girls, Disney. Come on. Get out of the rut.Perfect example. In the beginning of the movie Rapunzel's mother is ill and needs a magic plant to heal her so Rapunzel can be born. But in the original fairy tale the mother needs lettuce (sometimes it's parsley) and the king makes a deal with Gothel in which he hands over the baby to save the life of the queen. Now that's pretty dark right there. Even if he is motivated by saving the life of his queen, and must be forced to make that choice, Disney doesn't tell it that way. In this retelling, Gothel steals the baby from its crib. We lose whole subterranean plots and motivations in this one move. Gothel kidnaps the baby because she's evil and greedy. It's Disney. Of course she is evil and greedy.Finally, for the prince, in which this case it's a lovable thief, well, he serves the same function as all other love interests in Disney animated films. He's a plot point. Albeit a funny one in this case, and one in which Disney worked to flesh out -- but still a plot point. After all, Rapunzel has to eventually give her virginity to somebody, and it's not going to be that chameleon that rides her shoulder or Maximus the palace horse. Thus, we have the prince/thief/substitute-male figure who comes into her life in order to round out the story.As far as the character of Rapunzel herself, I did like her a lot. She went through the motions we expect her to and we're on her side. The sight gags of her doing things with her hair were funny and the running gag with the frying pan was cute. We like her and we want her to win her freedom and her love in the end. But the story that surrounds her doesn't click. It's not the story that allows her to find true happiness, it's Disney that makes it come true. Just like always. And so the movie loses a lot of its impact right there because we are never frightened for Rapunzel. Come to think of it, we are never frightened by any Disney movies anymore. Which was not always the case. Disney used to have a reputation of showing some fairly dark things on screen. Or at least stories that demanded, and gave, emotional investment and experience.We don't get that at all with Tangled.Part of the problem, I think, is the animation. Sometimes it is absolutely gorgeous...and sometimes we are taken aback by how bad it looks and the jerks and stopRapunzel gets tangled in Tangleds between scenes. To be sure there are many nice scenes (from an artistic perspective) in this film. The scene where the dam bursts, the dance in the market square, the flight of the paper lanterns all stand out. The clothing and texture of trees and stone and water are phenomenal. But the characters themselves...well, sometimes they look kind of rubbery. Like walking dolls made out of wax. I was disappointed in that. If you're going to go the limit to make clothing have proper texture, and move correctly upon the frame, then why not make the skin and shading on the characters more realistic as well?The music was another big let down. None of the songs were memorable. Even Rapunzel's healing song doesn't stick with you, and that song, more than any other, ties the arc of the film together. Most of the humor works and some falls flat. But that's Disney and that's their trademark and they're not going to let it go no matter how much we groan. At least we see some effort at background and characterization for many of the secondary characters. That helps round out many of the other flaws.Not surprisingly, the one character that really stands out (and takes the stage away from Rapunzel when they're together) is Gothel. This is where Disney shines.  If there's one thing Disney knows it's ""evil stepmother"" and how to represent her as a multi-facted and three-dimensional character who is cruel, cunning, and manipulative. As much as I like Rapunzel, and the idea of story potential about Rapunzel, as a professional writer I am here to tell you that a story about Gothel is much more interesting. But, once again, we are limited by Disney and the parameters they set up for every film they make. We will never see a story about Gothel, or Rapunzel for that matter, the way it should be told from Disney. It's not what they do.As I said earlier I really wanted to like this film. But there's too much missing or awkward about it, or worse yet, formulaic. Tangled was billed as the 50th animated film by Disney. In all that time they have made groundbreaking strides in the technical department. But the story of Tangled is like every other Lonely Princess story we've seen from Disney and that, more than anything else, is why I can't recommend it.",3,Animated Hair Fetish,1316563200,"09 21,

Rampunzel's tower, the Castle and surrounding town)will take your breath away.2. Humor: Humor for the most part is a success. A lot of the humor is very cliche -- you've seen it all before in Disney features.There are several jokes that are work, however, and they are quite memorable.Cons: 1. Pacing: story really drags in a lot of places, and this ultimately the downfall of the movie. Every time the lead character would break into YETANOTHER musical, I would cringe.

1406169,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B004G6009K,K. Ostrowski,"[0, 0]","Looking back on my review of the Princess and the Frog, I feel I may have dropped the ball (no joke intended) in one respect.  I didn't give it sufficient credit for the fact that both main characters cared enough about each other to sacrifice themselves; in other words, true love.  I apologize for overlooking this.I only mention this because the very same thing is present to an even greater degree in Tangled; probably one of the better animated Disney movies I've ever seen in my life.  Not top three, certainly, but top ten at least.It's a story about Rapunzel and how she escapes from her tower to find out the secret of the lanterns that rise into the sky each year on her birthday.  In escaping, she enlists the assistance of a thieving, manipulative, philandering bandit named Flynn Ryder (he gets better,) and has to struggle to keep from being dragged back to the tower by the hag Gothel, who's been using her magic hair to stay young.Tangled has everything.  There are scenes with fun, fast-paced action and adventure, scenes with pure comedy, heartwarming scenes, goofy scenes, romantic scenes, tragic scenes, etc, and sometimes, a little overlap.  There are running gags that travel through the whole movie, characters who always bring a little levity to the scenes they're in, and Rapunzel's mile-long hair is easily as eye-catching and fun to watch in action as the balloon house from ""Up.""The horse Maximus is one of the coolest and funniest characters I've ever seen.  Utterly wordless, unquestionably upright and unshakably determined to see justice done, and yet, he pulls it off with a sort of goofy seriousness rivaling the vorpal bunny from Monty Python.  No matter what scenes Maximus is in, it always benefits from having him in it.  In fact, I'd say he's probably the best enforcer that the royal guards have at their disposal.Gothel is a surprisingly well-done villain.  She might be a witch, but there's no indication of it.  She never uses any magic.  She's just crafty and manipulative, and really, when you think about it, that's all that most real villains are too.  On top of that, having very little power makes it much more of a challenge to write for a villain, and yet, in a sense, much more rewarding.  Coming up with schemes for an intelligent villain requires intelligent writers, and I absolutely appreciate the effort that was put into this.Rapunzel's real parents never say a word, and neither does her best friend; the chameleon Pascal, but in a way, the fact that they can be so expressive and convey such a breadth and depth of emotions regardless, is itself quite an accomplishment.  I was amazed by just how much was accomplished with these characters, without ever saying a word.Flynn and Rapunzel both have basically the same problem, as characters, unfortunately, and that is that while their relationship is utterly serious in later scenes, they both start out more or less goofy and hyper.  Rapunzel uses a lot of modern, casual, teenagery terminology, and Flynn is even worse in this respect, since he starts out with so many character flaws.  Still, as I said, all of this gets better later on, so it's very well-done.  Flynn is played a little like Bill Murray's character from Groundhog Day.  You don't really like him at first, but as time goes on, he becomes a better person.Rapunzel is a little different in that respect.  She's likable from the very start; quirky and weird in a happy sense.  Energetic, intelligent and imaginative.  However, even she starts out the movie with nothing to really sacrifice, and no one to sacrifice for, and it really helps as the movie progresses, and this gradually changes, until she and Flynn both become truly heroic characters.Flynn is clearly shown stealing, betraying, philandering and so forth, so there's obviously a reason for this to be rated PG, but like I said, these aspects of his character don't last.  I was actually amazed by the quality of the music in this movie.  It's truly awesome; even the instrumental tracks.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of Beauty and the Beast; probably because they got the same guy to do it.The humor in the movie is wacky and weird at times, and very strongly character-driven at other times.  There was no toilet humor, no off-color jokes, etc...  I think that pleased me more than anything.  They had to get away from the Dreamworks/Fox trends of non-funny humor if they wanted to make a real masterpiece, and they did this magnificently.  In fact, I have only two gripes against this film, really.  One small, the other big.The small one is this; I didn't feel that the narration over the beginning and end of the film was helpful.  It's like the king and queen.  The visuals alone would have told me what I needed to know.  Hearing Flynn talking in modern casual slang over them doesn't improve their ability to tell me the story of what happened.  They could still have had narration, though.  Maybe if it was just a more dignified-sounding kind of narrator, like they got for Beauty and the Beast.The big gripe is this; something happens to Rapunzel near the end of the film, which drastically alters her appearance, and this truly troubled me.  Granted, this does show Flynn's development as a character more strongly, because it proves his willingness to give his life for her, but I much preferred Rapunzel's quirky looks at the beginning, to her more modern looks at the end.  Still, even this is just a surface-level complaint.  I tend to stop the movie before the ending these days, but if it doesn't bother you as much as it bothered me, have a field day.To sum it up, Tangled is far superior to the Princess and the Frog, and as I said, one of the better Disney films in general.  Watch it for yourself, and then decide what you like and don't like.  Like I said, a few things bothered me, but I still think it was a great flick, and I hope you'll like it as well.",4,The Best Disney Film in a While,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,5922,"['Looking',

The original ""fairy tale"" is hardly suitable subject matter for a Disney movie, but, as Disney tends to do, the story was adapted extensively for a modern family audience.  The result is a marvelous entertaining fantasy that is enjoyable from beginning to end.Mother Gothel kidnaps baby Rapunzel from her parents' room.  Gothel needs access to Rapunzel's hair because it has the ability to keep her young.  To maintain control over Rapunzel, Mother Gothel keeps her at the top of a high tower hidden in the mountains.  However, Rapunzel can see the world outside her window and her greatest fantasy is to see the flying lanterns that appear every year, strangely enough, on her birthday.  Things come to a head on Rapunzel's 18th birthday, when thief Flynn Rider comes into Rapunzel's life by scaling the wall of the tower.At first, this strange person frightens Rapunzel because of the stories Mother Gothel told her about the cruel and evil world outside the tower.  However, Rapunzel's desire to see the lanterns drives her to take charge of Flynn Rider as her guide to the source of the lanterns.  What follows is one of the fastest and funniest Disney animated features.Rapunzel, outstandingly voiced by Mandy Moore, charms everyone she meets.  She is usually cheerful and funny.  Though she is nave, she is also smart and clever.  She is also physically fit.  I guess there is little to do in the tower except work out.  She is also quite dexterous with her hair.Does Rapunzel make it to the launching of the lanterns?  Will Flynn Rider change his moderately wicked ways?  Will Mother Gothel have justice visited upon her?  What about the horse that acts like a bloodhound (you have to watch to understand - the horse is hilarious)?  You will have to watch this clever, funny, fast and charming movie to find out!This DVD has a dearth of extras, somewhat unusual when comparing this release against other recent Disney releases.  There are two alternate beginnings along with an explanation of both and a countdown of Disney's first 50 animated movie releases.  While this stuff is interesting, it is hardly earth shattering.  I suspect Disney is holding out more extras for a special release of some sort.  Oh well, another clever way to make money I guess.Disney has a good track record with its animated features.

I've been entertained but somewhat underwhelmed by Disney's animated films for at least ten years or so. I found Disney's marketing campaign for this film somewhat annoying, especially their unwillingness to title the film ""Rapunzel"". I was very angry at Disney for changing from hand-drawn animation to (mostly) computer animation. There are other things, but I'll stop there. Needless to say, I was at Defcon 2 when the lights went down for ""Tangled"", ready to see yet another example of Disney losing its magic. Well, I was wrong. I love this movie. This may be my favorite Disney movie since ""Beauty and the Beast"". I apologize for the cynicism, Disney. ""Tangled"" is simply magical!Where do I start? The animation is absolutely glorious! The backgrounds are so lush and beautiful, the characters are so vibrant and expressive. Every facial expression (well, HUMAN facial expressions - I don't think I'm in a position to comment on the accuracy of Pascal the chameleon's facial expressions) is absolutely convincing. Look into the eyes of Rapunzel or Flynn at any scene in the movie and you see their emotions reflected there perfectly. I know the eyes are the window to the soul and therefore critical to making an animated character seem alive, but the animators have outdone themselves (and everyone else) this time. And don't get me started on Rapunzel's hair! Amazing!The story is terrific, too - I can't remember the last time I laughed so much in a Disney film. Rapunzel is spunky and adorable, Flynn Rider is a sarcastic thief with (of course) a heart of gold, a hilarious horse named Maximus, a pub full of comic ruffians, a suitably sinister villain named Mother Gothel-  all great stuff! The romantic development in Rapunzel and Flynn's relationship is done extremely well, too, and never feels forced. We all know it's going to end happily, but getting there is such a joy in ""Tangled""!""Tangled"" seems to have been somewhat overlooked (though it was still a half-billion dollar success worldwide) when in theatres last fall, and so I really hope that it finds the audience it deserves on Blu Ray and DVD.

I would say it's a tad bit better than sleeping beauty.I thought the scenes with Mother Gothel and the ending were the best ones in the film andwhy I would give it at least 3 stars. I don't completely hate this film but I don't completelylove it either. I want to pinpoint the main problems of what I found in this film and what I felt was really lacking:HUMOR: The movie relies too much on comedy in that I felt it was overdone. At times, it felt more like Shrek. It's like they showcased that in everyscene whereas the older Disney films kept the comedy to a minimum and focused more on the serious parts.Examples: The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, The Lion King, and Beauty And The Beast. I think the comedy fit in morewith Aladdin and Hercules because they didn't dealt with darker themes.  I found movies like Aladdin andThe Lion King and maybe even Hercules to be far more funnier than this film.I felt that some of the scenes came off ascheesy and lame. I think the only funny moment for me was when Rapunzel kept hitting Flynn Ryder with the pan.CHARACTERS: I actually thought Mother Gothel was the best one in the film and she far outshines the characters in the movie.I just think the rest of the characters don't have nearly the wit and charisma like the ones in the older movies.Rapunzel is okay. I think the fact that she's artistic and sheltered reminded me more of myself and Quasimodo.Both of their parental figures would often tell them how they wouldn't fit in with society and that societywould be a threat to them. I think Mandy Moore gave a good job providing the voice for Rapunzel.But if I have to compare her to other Disney princesses, I choose Belle, Jasmine, Ariel, and Tiana over her.Pascal? Okay..but he doesn't even compare to Aladdin's Abu or Ariel's Sebastian.They definitely had more character and fondness about them. Flynn?? Not really my favorite at all. Did notcare for him at all. I didn't like how Disney changed his character froma prince to some lame thief named Flynn Ryder. One of the reasons why I choose Barbie's version of Rapunzelover this! They at least still stick with the originals instead of trying to sound so hip and cool like whatDisney is doing.Prince Stefan sounds waaaay more appealing than some stupid Flynn Ryder.He has no charm or charisma like the other male leads in the past.I much prefer Aladdin, the genie, mufasa, simba, and even my boo Quasimodo over him!!! He just doesn't have any special qualitiesthat make me want to fall in love with him. Maximus? I like him...he was funny at times. I have to take noticethat aside from the mental abuse and using Rapunzel for her selfish gain, I couldn't take Mother Gothel thatseriously as a villain like with Frollo or The Evil Step Queen. There were times where she seems likeable whenshe shows affection to Rapunzel just like any real, loving mother would.MUSIC: ""I See The Light"" and ""Mother Knows Best"" were the ones that only stood out for me. Most of the songswere just modern pop songs that didn't feel classic or magical. Neither catchy or memorable. They could havetaken a cue from the Hunchback of Notre Dame songs. The Princess and The Frog songs have more a classy, jazzy feeling andfit in more with the movie rather than relying on humor.SETTING: Felt too modernized for a historical setting. In fact, it feels like watching Shrek. What I likedfrom the older films was that they showed more culture. Like The Beauty and The Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame showedFrench culture. The Lion King showed African culture and wildlife. Pocahontas showed Native American culture.Aladdin showed the Arabic/Middle Eastern culture. The songs of the Little Mermaid reflect the Caribbean culture.The Princess and The Frog showed New Orleans/Jazz culture. What culture does Tangled have that we could learnand reflect on? I really couldn't help how Tangled seem to be reminiscent of Sleeping Beauty like when Rapunzelwas kidnapped and was raised by a witch just for 18 years...just like how Princess Aurora was kidnapped and raisedby fairies for 16 years.",3,It was good...but it's TERRIBLY overrated.,1364688000,"03 31, 2013",2013,4867,"['Rapunzel', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'elements',

1406199,A3INANJEZZL8ED,B004G6009K,"Luke Skywalker ""feilog""","[0, 0]","With a legacy that spans over several decades, we've come to expect greatness when it comes to Disney's animated features, and ""Tangled"" doesn't disappoint.  Initially I must admit that I was saddened to discover that Disney's take on the Rupunzel story was not to be traditionally animated.  I have a great respect for hand drawn animation and was hoping that this feature would follow in that proud tradition.  However, this wasn't to be, as disney decided to go the route of CGI.  Even with that disappointment to overcome, I found Tangled to be an adorable, heart-felt, tear jerking tale that touched the heart of this writer/viewer.  At its core, this is a story of an innocent young girl who yearns for more for her life.  Despite the horrible conditions which she was forced to grow up in, Rupunzel grows into a strong, kind, caring young lady who sees the good in everyone, and greatness for herself.  She therefore decides to make her own dreams come true by taking life by the reigns and living for a change.  In addition to a strong female lead, a lovable male side-kick, an engaging story, fantastic/breathtaking animation, and gorgeous music, ""Tangled"" has something else working for it; valuable life lessons weaved into its story.  There have been many authors, writers, and countless stories, that teach the lesson that life is meant to be lived.  ""It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live."" -Albus Dumbledore  ""Stop existing and start living"" -Michael Jackson ""I wanna live while I'm alive"" -Jon Bon Jovi, ""...Life's not a spectator sport. If watchin' is all you're gonna do, then you're gonna watch your life go by without ya."" -Mary Wicks.  ""Tangled"" communicates this message extremely well.  I am very happy that this movie is part of my video collection.  It is a ""feel good"" film with great music, a wonderful story, and beautiful animation.

1406200,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B004G6009K,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","Finally! Disney is back with a vengeance... eh, I mean, a princess! This is the great come back of Walt Disney Animation Studios to the classical fairy tales, which made the happiness of so many children since ""White Snow"" sang that first song... My daughter absolutely loved ""Tangled"" and I liked it at least as much, for all the reasons mentioned in the title:1. Princess Rapunzel - together with ""The Princess and the Frog"" in 2009, this is the return of Disney Princesses after a long leave of absence, and Rapunzel is certainly a great success. Her magic hair gives of course a great show but Rapunzel herself is the real star. Having spend all her life in a tower she is quite naive and can even seem simple, but her charm and courage are simply irresistible. The scene in which she handles alone a whole tavern full of mercenaries, rogues, brigands and other scum of the earth is a great moment of cinema!2. Flynn Rider, the thief - he is an extremely likable scoundrel, a perfect mix of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood and Douglas Fairbanks Jr Thief of Baghdad, with just a little something of Han Solo and Captain Jack Sparrow (just younger than both of them). It can seem an unlikely choice to make a thief in the hero of a child story, but Flynn Rider is hardly a real criminal, more like a wannabee - and for all his past misdeeds he is going to be seriously punished in this movie and will have ample occasion to redeem himself... He is also certainly a irresistibly charming character.3. Humor - well, other than Rapunzel's pet chameleon who loves stick his tongue in people's ears, humor is provided by shovels in almost every scene and by almost every character in the movie - but mostly by the brilliant dialogs between Rapunzel and Flynn. Grown ups will find this movie almost certainly as entertaining as children. And mind this frying pan!4. Horse power - I kept the best for the end. Maximus the horse is absolutely the greatest character in the whole movie! As promised on the poster this is a noble steed who can do everything, including sword fighting! In fact the more we progress through the movie, the more we realize that Maximus is in fact.. but no! I am not telling you anything more about him! If you missed this movie in the cinema, you deserve to discover everything about Maximus the horse by yourself!To conclude, this movie is a wonder!

1406213,A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,B004G6009K,Mary Kate,"[459, 502]","*contains some spoilery bits*Tangled, Disney's version of the oft-refashioned folk tale Rapunzel, is the studio's 50th animated film and one that is destined for classic status.The Synopsis:This latest retelling begins with a tiny piece of sunlight falling to earth and a magical golden flower sprouting where it lands. The flower, and its ability to restore youth, is discovered, used and kept secret by Mother Gothel. When the kingdom's beloved queen falls ill, a search for the flower (apparently its existence wasn't *completely* secret) is successfully undertaken and the healing potion brewed from it restores the queen's health. The flower's magical abilities are also transferred to the hair of the queen's unborn child, Rapunzel. When Mother Gothel discovers this and learns that the magical properties are only retained as long as the hair remains uncut, she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own child. Claiming that she wants to keep Rapunzel safe from a frightening world full of danger and thugs, Mother Gothel locks her away in a remote tower. While her hair (almost a character in and of itself) grows longer and longer, Rapunzel blossoms into a surprisingly well-adjusted young woman and gifted artist who longs to see the world - particularly the mysterious lights that appear in the night sky each year on her birthday.Enter our amusing narrator, Flynn Rider, a roguish thief who has just stolen a tiara and is on the run from palace guards when he comes across Rapunzel's tower and takes refuge there. The very competent Rapunzel restrains Flynn, hides the tiara and strikes a bargain with him - she will return the tiara to him if he will agree to take her to see those mysterious lights, which he tells her are floating lanterns. Flynn agrees and the two set off on a rollicking adventure. Pursued now, not only by Maximus - a horse from the palace guard who refuses to give up the chase - but also by a pair of thugs Flynn double-crossed AND Mother Gothel, Flynn and Rapunzel learn to trust each other as they make one narrow escape from their pursuers after another.Comments:Tangled is a laugh-out-loud funny family film that will thoroughly entertain both children and adults. The animation is stellar, the story engaging and the pacing excellent, never dragging for a moment. Rapunzel and Flynn are both charming and likeable, making it easy for viewers to root for them. Further, they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including tavern thugs with secret dreams and Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon. But it's Maximus who truly steals the show. The expressive horse is brave, determined, sometimes petty, and hilarious. Every scene he's in is solid gold. I would love to see some sort of sequel with Max and Flynn trading quips - particularly since Max doesn't speak at all and the two still seemed to be doing just that through much of Tangled.I did have a couple of quibbles, neither of which significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. First, the colors often seemed a bit too dark to me, rather grayed out. This impression may well have been exacerbated by the 3D glasses. (ETA: A couple of fellow reviewers have commented that they found the colors bright and vibrant when they viewed the film in 2D. It seems likely that my experience may have had more to do with the theater where I saw the film or with the 3D glasses - or a bit of both. This is especially important since I imagine most Amazon costumers will be purchasing this film in 2D. My thanks to Star Fire and Thomas Plotkin for their input - I really appreciate it!) Second, even though I felt they were well performed, the songs were, IMHO, largely under whelming. With the exception of the lovely ""I See the Light"", I felt they had neither the excitement of previous Disney showstoppers ""Be Our Guest"", ""Under the Sea"" or ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" nor the memorable melodies of ""Kiss the Girl"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Circle of Life"".On the plus side, the film is rich in emotional depth and is blessed with a number of wonderful scenes. My favorite sequence begins with Rapunzel and Flynn entering the village and dancing with the villagers and continues on through their scene on the lake among the floating lanterns. Their happiness in the village, Rapunzel's sense of wonder (and ours!) while surrounded by the lanterns, the romantic song they sing as they realize they're attracted to one another and may be falling in love - it's all perfect. The lantern scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous - well worth the price of admission on its own and the film's most effective use of 3D. Another scene that I loved for its poignancy centers on the silent communication between Rapunzel's parents as they mourn their lost daughter together just before releasing their floating lantern.I do want to alert parents to one element. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is difficult and layered, dealing with emotional abuse masked with concern and declarations of love. (Mother Gothel's frequent put-downs of Rapunzel, followed by a cheery ""Just kidding!"" had me clenching my teeth.) Young children who are used to a more black and white portrayal of good and evil may be confused by Rapunzel's oft-declared love for the woman she believes is her mother and by Rapunzel's conflicted feelings when she first leaves the tower with Flynn. This unhealthy relationship doesn't overshadow the film, nor does it steal the humor and fun from it, but parents should be prepared for questions children might ask and concerns they might have. These questions may not come until a second or third viewing, when children have already seen the scenes where Mother Gothel more explicitly reveals her true nature and so have that knowledge when viewing the early mother/daughter scenes.That said, I still loved the film and believe it's a great addition to Disney's animated classics. Lastly, let me just add a big ""Yeah!"" to the film's final moments when Flynn, back in narrator mode, reveals that it was several years before he and Rapunzel got married. A much better message for children than the more usual we-saw-each-other-twice-before-tying-the-knot which seems almost de rigueur in so many fairy tales.Highly recommended.Note: Author, editor and fairy tale aficionado Terri Windling has written a wonderful essay about the long history of the ""Maiden in a Tower"" story which, it turns out, predates the Brothers Grimm by more than 200 years. I found reading about how a story evolves over time and across cultures absolutely fascinating. (Essay is available at Windling's website. A simple google search - ""Rapunzel"" + ""Terri Windling"" - should get you there.)",4,Worthy Addition to Disney's Classic Films,1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,6680,"['*contains', 'spoilery',

There's nothing to complain when it comes to Disney art, but when will Disney (or other movie makers) ever learn that the plot is the most important point of a movie? Not the actors, not the special effects, not the music -- the plot!Other people seem to like the Princess and the Frog. Good for them, but more people like Tangled. The Frog story grossed 260 million; Tangled grossed 670 million. Almost three times. To me, that's totally right.Tangled's plot is pretty good, making the movie interesting all the way to the end. I do have a problem with the ending, though. For one thing, the bad witch fell to her death -- just like Snow White's bad witch! And further more, the relationship between the girl and her adopted mother is too easily erased. No matter what, that's the mother she knows her whole life and the only person she's ever interacted with. That relationship shouldn't be dismissed even if the mother isn't so wonderful, in my mind. She was at least fairly nice for a mother. The girl once asked for something, and the mother agreed to get it. Not like Cinderella's step mom, who was nothing but mean.I would say Tangled was worth watching. But it was nothing like the great movies of my childhood such as Aladdin or even Beauty and the Beast. I don't think it has the Disney magic.I think Disney movies are on its way out. Look at the recent disaster called John Carter. Pixar's new movie Brave is looking rather promising right now, or I would have said that Pixar's on its way out too. It's been rehashing old plots the last few years. But I suspect Pixar is going to run out of good ideas real soon.Disney's been busy buying stuff like ESPN and Marvel, plus building the Shanghai Disneyland. I think it's a huge mistake. They are forgetting who they are. They need to concentrate more in making good movies. For Disney to crank out a disaster is unforgivable. It sullies the great Disney name.But, I suppose all good things must come to an end.

Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[0, 0]","This is another Disney animated classic in the making...nearly as compelling and as visually stunning as SNOW WHITE, SLEEPING BEAUTY, CINDERELLA and other timeless Disney classics. This is primarily because the production team, while using CGI, made a concerted effort to create the fluidity of movement of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated features. They succeeded so well that, aesthetically, the visuals in TANGLED are even better than the old classics. And the adaptation of the Grimms fairy tale story of Rapunzel had been waiting in the wings for Disney Studios all these years...cant believe they never produced a Rapunzel feature-length film before now. A loose adaptation, since the rescuer of Princess Rapunzel is a lovable thief instead of a prince, it is still an exceptionally well written screenplay and the music and song just enhance the mood and the overall quality of the film. The casting of voice actors is also top drawer, with Mandy Moore as Princess Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as the thief, Flynn Rider. Also listen for Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel and Brad Garrett, Ron Perlman and Jeffrey Tambor as the voices of the hilarious pub thugs. While not voiced, the animated horse, Maximus, is also a highlight, mostly from a humorous perspective.

1406232,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B004G6009K,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 11]","How do you tell the traditional fairy tale - princess locked away in a tower only to be rescued by dashing hero - in a CGI format for modern audiences?  The answer is...Tangled.The staples are all here: the adorably wide-eyed princess Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), the handsome rogue Flynn (as in Errol) Rider (Zachary Levi), the villainous stepmother Gothel (Donna Murphy), and two heroic critters - Maximus the lawful good warhorse and Pascal the chameleon (voice by Frank Welker, master of the entire animal-voiced kingdom). A magical flower falls to earth that has restorative powers that heals the wounded and promise eternal youth, but when the queen's childbirth becomes...difficult, the flower is turned into a poultice, bestowing its curative effects on the young princess. The problem is that Mother Gothel was using the flower to keep her eternally youthful and, upon realizing that Rapunzel's hair now has the same powers, kidnaps the girl and raises the child as her own.Whew.  Got all that?  Early on, it becomes clear Gothel is blessed with superhuman abilities to do evil things.  She is basically an old lady who really, really likes being youthful.  We never get any insight as to why this is - she never flirts with anybody, so it's surely not for the obvious reasons - and so Gothel becomes a cipher helped conveniently by the plot.  She gets the drop on two huge thugs! Tangled was obviously uncomfortable turning Gothel into another witch, but I kept hoping she had some magical tricks up her sleeve.Speaking of Gothel, she acts like Faye Dunaway from Mommy Dearest and looks like Cher. She is manipulative, loving, protective, and saps her daughter's self-esteem at every turn.  Gothel is, in other words, a post-modern villain palatable to audiences who are unlikely to accept a stepmother that managed to keep her daughter in a tower for nearly two decades. And yet, once Gothel's secret is out she transforms into an unrepentant harpy.Gothel's manipulative skills are at their peak when she sings ""Mother Knows Best.""  Given the breathtaking old-school style of animation the film invokes, it's a shame that the music simply can't keep up. The actors rarely launch into full-throated song, preferring instead to half-talk, half-sing their way into and out of what should be true theatrics.  In fact, Tangled at times feels like a Broadway play, unwilling to go all-out because the director fears his cast can't hit the high notes.  There's not a single memorable song in Tangled's hairnet.Flynn Rider has his own problems.  His age is indecipherable, but it's certainly older than eighteen-year-old Rapunzel. He's been around long enough to have a reputation as a lady's man and an accomplished thief, which makes him old enough to know better, but never mind that. Rider narrates the tale but rarely hasn't much of interest to say- his narration could have been removed completely without affecting the story.  Also, Rider's a world class jerk, backstabbing his partners in crime for no other reason than greed.  Even the other characters point out that his dream (to have a private island with piles of money) is terrible. Rider eventually gets it knocked into his head (literally) that Rapunzel is his dream...which is a bit of an uncomfortable message (you're either greedy or utterly devoted to your spouse), but not unexpected for a Disney film.Just about every character in Tangled has a surprising dark streak that saps their fairy-tale qualities.  Maximus is willing to slit Rider's throat, Pascal gleefully defenestrates an old lady, and even Rapunzel turns on her formerly beloved stepmother in the blink of an eye. The most lovable characters are the self-confessed rogues at the Snugly Duckling.Tangled wants to have it both ways - edgy and innocent, fairy-tale and girl power - but ends up somewhere in between.

Mandy Moore is the acting and singing voice of Rapunzel and the whole cast is good (even the minor cast) but in some scenes it seems like the evil witch steals many of the scenes with her underhanded psychological abusive attacks on her fake daughterintertwined with a bit of defensive love.

As you would expect with almost all animation done in the U. S., the artwork is flawless.  For example, Sleeping Beauty...no I mean Cinderella...no wait, Rapunzel (a very good Mandy Moore) spends all of her time barefoot.  In close ups when her foot hits the turf, you can see her toes actually spread apart as they would in reality.  The detail is amazing.  The color as good as you will ever see.  I must confess, I knew literally nothing of the story of Rapunzel other than she had long hair.  Now I do.  She was born a princess, but kidnapped by an evil woman who knew the magic, the child's hair had.  When Rap' sang, the hair glowed and could cure injuries and other maladies, including aging.  Stroking the long golden locks kept the woman, Gothel (Donna Murphy) young.  Posing as her real mother, Gothel keeps Rap' in check in their hidden tower/home.  As she gets older, Rap' wants to see the outside world and gets her chance when a good natured thief stumbles upon the tower.  Naturally the thief, Flynn Rider/Eugene (Zachary Levi) is young and hunky.  They make a deal and he helps her see the kingdom for the first time.  You can pretty much guess the rest.  They meet interesting characters along the way, deal with evil, charm the townsfolk, dispatch the bad guys and live happily ever after.  The music is always important in these movies and here I would say it is pretty good, but far from great.  There are no memorable tunes.  The story is rote, but the comedy is pretty good.

1406263,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B004G6009K,Nathan L. Baker,"[2, 3]","I grew up in the 90s, with The Lion King and Toy Story representing the pinnacle of Disney animation--the pinnacle of animation period, from any studio. With the pool crowding, however, Disney has had trouble since I've been a kid. Shrek took over; Kung-Fu Panda; Ice Age. Sure, Disney has been a major presence throughout, but it's had to put up with some stiff competition the past 10-15 years. For the record: I'm aware that there's always been competition. My point is, that for someone such as myself, Disney has always come first; no-one else could top them, even if movies from other companies make good money and get good reviews too. With these others I've listed, that has changed a little bit as I've aged. Plus I've paid less attention to so-called ""kids movies"", so the significance of Disney, to me personally, has waned.With Tangled, however, Disney seems to have finally found its footing in this modern era. Wall-E and other recent Disney flicks have proven themselves capable of holding their own, but the difference with Tangled--and what makes it so significant to me--is the general storyline of a princess rather than a robot or a pack of anthropomorphic automobiles. Lion King had this to an extent (although it was a Prince/King); Toy Story didn't have this, although the story illustrated the fact that CG animation could elicit genuine emotion. Tangled, although perhaps not as memorable as either of these favorites of mine (time, as they say, will only tell) but it marks a major return to form for the king of animation. Unlike other ""kids"" movies, Tangled--which is full of humor, drama, and character growth--does not incorporate inappropriate humor to attract adult audiences. Rather, Tangled's humor, despite the fact that the movie is aimed at a younger audience, is genuine enough that it doesn't _have_ to have kid-proof adult-humor (ie: kids see and hear it, but probably don't understand the double entendre) to attract adult audiences. That's what I love about this movie--it's funny without resorting to low-brow inappropriate humor. No, I'm not some angry parent who hates Shrek for its gross-out raunchiness (I in fact enjoy Shrek quite a bit); I just appreciate good, classic funny and Tangled has a plenty of it.Rather than take the easy way out, the writers and animators have done a wonderful job of making the comedy work. The dialogue is fine, but what really stands out is the character ""acting"". The horse, Maximus, is especially well ""acted"". His facial expressions and body language (that of another animal altogether, which is for some reason very hilarious) fit perfectly with every situation in which he finds himself. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, also expresses himself very efficiently without having a line of dialogue in the film. As surprisingly good as Mandy Moore's voice acting is, the animated acting of Rapunzel herself is amazing. With just a look, a turn of the head, the way she walks, you know exactly what she's thinking. It's truly wonderful.Besides, the gags are all really funny too, without being raunchy. For instance, in one scene Maximus is hidden behind a peculiarly shaped and mossed-up rock, with a tree-branch conspicuously bent down--all of this with the effect of looking like a horse. All the sudden, Maximus jumps out from this situation. It may not sound funny on the page--and as I look at what I just wrote, I'm a bit unconvinced myself--but to actually see it is something else entirely. I was laughing when I saw it in the theater, along with my 35 year old aunt, 13 year old sister, and my 8 and 4 year old cousins.Pardon my random musings on this movie. I realize that it's not an in depth review, but as usual with any reviews I decide to make, I'm writing this for people like me, people who remember the Disney of _their_ childhood (not necessarily the ""classic"" Disney; Snow White, Pinocchio, etc); for the people who don't think Disney matters any more. It's like we've all grown up now, and no one bothers to watch a movie if it's not violent or R-rated. It's not gritty, it's not a representation of the real-world. It's a fantasy, a fairy tale, and so on. But so what? Who says that movies have to be that way to be deemed worthy of viewing? Tangled may be a ""kids movie"", but I like it quite a bit.I give it 5 stars not because I think it's a game-changing movie, not because I think it's perfect, or anything like that. Rather, it's a great ""kids movies"" that anyone and everyone can watch without feeling out of place. It's entertaining throughout, and that's what I look for in any movie.** UPDATE FOR 3D VERSION **[I apparently can't change this review to be specifically for the 3D version, so I'm just tacking this on here.]When I first bought my 3D TV, this (and Tron Legacy) were the first 3D Blu-Rays that I bought. Since then I've collected probably about half of the major movies that have been released in 3D, and of all of them (including Avatar) TANGLED 3D is my favorite in terms of stereoscopic 3D. The picture looks absolutely amazing and has impressed everyone I've shown it to. The 3D definitely adds to the experience, and the world really pops on screen (and ""behind"" screen). So if you're looking for just one 3D Blu-Ray to buy, this should be the one to add to your collection.",5,A fine example of new-age Disney ** 3D UPDATE**,1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,5306,"['grew',

It has a flippant, modern attitude in all of the dialog, a crisply appealing and smartly styled animated technique that brings the characters to life, and a pleasant score by Alan Menken that captures the essence of the fairy tale story in street smart style. In short, it's an instant classic for today's movie fans.With talented voice chores performed by ZACHARY LEVI, MANDY MOORE and DONNA MURPHY, the characters are given full-bodied images that are uncannily real. In fact, the chemistry between Flynn Rider (Levi) and Rapunzel (Moore) is a gradual thing (not instant falling in love as in most Disney features), and blends and ripens convincingly for the tender moments that follow.And aside from the key human characters and a horse named Maximus, there's plenty of fast-moving adventure as the evil Mother Gothel plans on keeping Rapunzel at her side forever as a way to retain the magic powers of her golden hair, lest she shrivel away to an old hag. And within the texture of the plot is always a sense of humor from either one-liner wisecracks or the animated expressions of the humans and Maximus, the stubborn horse.Easily one of the best animated features to come out of the Disney studio in some time despite the fact that the score is not as strong as other animated classics. Nevertheless, it has action and romance and an astounding beauty in its magnificent settings and polished art work.Absolutely a must for any animation fan.",5,More than a drop of golden sun...an instant classic with a modern twist but old-fashioned charm...,1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,1498,"['TANGLED', 'much', 'more', 'drop', 'golden', 'sun', 'flippant', 'modern', 'attitude', 'dialog', 'crisply', 'appealing', 'smartly', 'styled', 'animated', 'technique', 'characters', 'life', 'pleasant', 'score', 'Alan', 'Menken', 'essence', 'fairy', 'tale', 'story', 'street', 'smart', 'style', 'short', 'instant', 'classic', 'today', 'movie', 'fans.With', 'talented', 'voice', 'chores', 'performed', 'ZACHARY', 'LEVI', 'MANDY', 'MOORE', 'DONNA', 'MURPHY', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'full-bodied', 'images', 'are', 'uncannily', 'real', 'fact', 'chemistry', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'Levi', 'Rapunzel', 'Moore', 'gradual', 'thing', 'not', 'instant', 'falling', 'love', 'most', 'Disney', 'features', 'blends', 'ripens', 'convincingly', 'tender', 'moments', 'follow.And', 'aside', 'key', 'human', 'characters', 'horse', 'named', 'Maximus', 'plenty', 'fast-moving', 'adventure', 'evil', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'keeping', 'Rapunzel', 'side', 'forever', 'way', 'retain', 'magic', 'powers', 'golden', 'hair', 'lest', 'away', 'old', 'hag', 'texture', 'plot', 'always', 'sense', 'humor', 'one-liner', 'wisecracks', 'animated', 'expressions', 'humans', 'Maximus', 'stubborn', 'horse.Easily', 'one', 'best', 'animated', 'features', 'come', 'Disney', 'studio', 'time', 'fact', 'score', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'other', 'animated', 'classics', 'Nevertheless', 'action', 'romance', 'astounding', 'beauty', 'magnificent', 'settings', 'polished', 'art', 'work.Absolutely', 'must', 'animation', 'fan']",N/A

1406276,A1NMGCWGJ0BGVD,B004G6009K,nottheaveragemoviegoer,"[5, 20]","I consider this movie to be the ""dumb blonde"" of the Disney princess saga: pretty to look at but lacking real substance. This movie had 90% positive reviews on Rottentomatoes.com, so it peaked my interest. I was sadly disappointed. This movie is what I like to call ""overrated animated"". I even took my 15-year old sister to see this movie, and even she hated it.The movie isn't SO bad that it should be missed, but it's a pretty standard movie. If it were anything else, it would be tolerable, but this is a DISNEY PRINCESS movie. This isn't just a pedigree; it's a genre of its own. Disney has always been the biggest name in princess movies because they have offered us many of the best. It's not just that they are prolific but also crafted. Tangled was just playing it safe and thus offered nothing new to the experience. In fact, one could say that it is a rehash of other Disney princess movies.The love interest is a thief, not a prince (Aladdin). The princess is taken away from her family at a young age not knowing she's a princess (Sleeping Beauty). The male and female leads hate each other first but wind up falling in love (Beauty and the Beast and any other romance). The story is incredibly cliche and predictable. You have a crucial misunderstanding that leads to ""the potential split"". You have thugs that ""don't dream of being mean"", much like in Shrek the Third. The one cliche that really ticked me off (as well as my sister) is the magical tear. I won't tell you who gets it, but you can guess. This deus ex machina has been done to death, and it's always silly and trite.Because this is a Disney princess movie, the filmmakers saw it fitting to write new songs for it. Every song is forgettable and unnecessary. There is no cardinal rule that EVERY DISNEY PRINCESS MOVIE NEEDS A SONG, but at least those that do have at least one memorable song. In fact, it doesn't contribute anything new to the princess genre. Let's look back: Snow White ate a poison apple. Cinderella had the glass slipper say she was the one. Sleeping Beauty had the spinning wheel put her to sleep. All had princes save them. Then came the Disney Renaissance. Aladdin had no prince. In fact, the movie may have made fun of it with the whole ""Prince Ali"" schtick. The Little Mermaid had a princess who is a mermaid falling in love with a human. Beauty and the Beast: the prince was an actual beast who falls in love with a village girl. Hell, the Princess and the Frog had the prince and princess turn into frogs and becoming human after marrying and kissing. What does Tangled offer? the hair? It's not symbolic enough.However, as I have said, Tangled isn't so bad that it should be missed. Despite its massive faults, it does have some positive qualities. The animation was pretty and creative. Disney knows how to mix and match the colors and make some really nice scenes. The scenes where Rapunzel and Flynn go to the kingdom look really good. The voice acting is pretty good despite the songs. Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy all match their voices with their characters. There are a number of entertaining scenes, especially with the horse Maximus. That horse single-handedly (or hoovedly) stole the show every time it was on screen. If only it was on screen in every scene.Bottom line: Tangled isn't awful, but it doesn't help that everything good about it is offset by something bad. The voice acting is good, but the songs are forgettable. The animation is pretty, but the story is ungodly formulaic and cliche. There are a number of entertaining moments, but there aren't enough to make this movie entertaining on the whole. The fact that Disney focused more on making a successful princess movie and less on making a good one is really annoying. Tangled offers nothing that the other Disney princess movies haven't. It's not one of those Disney movies that will be remembered.",2,Definitely NOT the best Disney Princess Movie,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,3895,"['consider', 'movie', 'be', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'Disney', 'princess', 'saga', 'pretty', 'look', 'lacking', 'real', 'substance', 'movie', 'had', '90', '%', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Rottentomatoes.com', 'peaked', 'interest', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'overrated', 'animated', 'even', 'took', '15-year', 'old', 'sister', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'hated', 'it.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'SO', 'bad', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'pretty', 'standard', 'movie', 'were', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'tolerable', 'DISNEY', 'PRINCESS', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'pedigree', 'genre', 'own', 'Disney', 'always', 'been', 'biggest', 'name', 'princess', 'movies', 'have', 'offered', 'many', 'best', 'not', 'just', 'are', 'prolific', 'also', 'crafted', 'Tangled', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'safe', 'thus', 'offered', 'nothing', 'new', 'experience', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'rehash', 'other', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movies.The', 'love', 'interest', 'thief', 'not', 'prince', 'Aladdin', 'princess', 'taken', 'away', 'family', 'young', 'age', 'not', 'knowing', 'princess', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'male', 'female', 'leads', 'hate', 'other', 'first', 'wind', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'other', 'romance', 'story', 'incredibly', 'cliche', 'predictable', 'have', 'crucial', 'misunderstanding', 'potential', 'split', 'have', 'thugs', 'do', ""n't"", 'dream', 'being', 'mean', 'much', 'Shrek', 'Third', 'one', 'cliche', 'really', 'ticked', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'magical', 'tear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'can', 'guess', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'always', 'silly', 'trite.Because', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'filmmakers', 'saw', 'fitting', 'write', 'new', 'songs', 'Every', 'song', 'forgettable', 'unnecessary', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'EVERY', 'DISNEY', 'PRINCESS', 'MOVIE', 'NEEDS', 'A', 'SONG', 'least', 'do', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'memorable', 'song', 'fact', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'anything', 'new', 'princess', 'genre', 'Let', 'look', 'back', 'Snow', 'White', 'ate', 'poison', 'apple', 'Cinderella', 'had', 'glass', 'slipper', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'had', 'spinning', 'wheel', 'put', 'sleep', 'had', 'princes', 'save', 'Then', 'came', 'Disney', 'Renaissance', 'Aladdin', 'had', 'prince', 'fact', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'fun', 'whole', 'Prince', 'Ali', 'schtick', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'had', 'princess', 'who', 'mermaid', 'falling', 'love', 'human', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'prince', 'was', 'actual', 'beast', 'who', 'love', 'village', 'girl', 'Hell', 'Princess', 'Frog', 'had', 'prince', 'princess', 'turn', 'frogs', 'becoming', 'human', 'marrying', 'kissing', 'What', 'Tangled', 'offer', 'hair', 'not', 'symbolic', 'enough.However', 'have', 'said', 'Tangled', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'massive', 'faults', 'have', 'positive', 'qualities', 'animation', 'was', 'pretty', 'creative', 'Disney', 'how', 'mix', 'match', 'colors', 'make', 'really', 'nice', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'where', 'Rapunzel', 'Flynn', 'go', 'kingdom', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'songs', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'match', 'voices', 'characters', 'are', 'number', 'entertaining', 'scenes', 'especially', 'horse', 'Maximus', 'horse', 'single-handedly', 'hoovedly', 'stole', 'show', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'only', 'was', 'screen', 'scene.Bottom', 'line', 'Tangled', ""n't"", 'awful', ""n't"", 'help', 'everything', 'good', 'offset', 'something', 'bad', 'voice', 'acting', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'forgettable', 'animation', 'pretty', 'story', 'ungodly', 'formulaic', 'cliche', 'are', 'number', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'fact', 'Disney', 'focused', 'more', 'making', 'successful', 'princess', 'movie', 'less', 'making', 'good', 'one', 'really', 'annoying', 'Tangled', 'offers', 'nothing', 'other', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movies', 'have', ""n't"", 'not', 'one', 'Disney', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'remembered']",N/A

1406281,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B004G6009K,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[5, 8]","Disney looks like it's going to have a great year. With the eye-popping TRON: Legacy recently unleashed on cinemas, its follow up is the equally impressive, though decidedly more traditional Disney fare of Tangled, a clever reworking of the Rapunzel fairy story.Both are supposed to be amongst the most expensive movies ever made. That's a pretty big punt for one studio in the austere times of 2010.But then, when you celebrate, you should do it in style. As the opening titles roll, Disney announces that Tangled is its 50th feature length animation, and in that spirit I suppose it has tried to throw in something for everyone, and impressively, has succeeded. There's the princess in the tower, musical numbers, a Robin Hood- like rascally hero, and a wide cast of hilarious bit parts including a gang of villainous but kind-hearted ruffians and what has to be the most scene-stealing horse in motion picture history.Tangled certainly passed the real acid test: I went armed with two sceptical boys (who professed they'd rather watch TRON: Legacy) and a highly enthusiastic five year old girl, who wanted nothing more than to see a beautiful princess, and all of them came out fizzing.It's interesting where this places Disney. In the same month that Disney demonstrates with TRON its technical credentials and, perhaps, how far In George Lucas' direction it is prepared to stray from its original mandate, it also shows a marked return to its most classic era - something that has been a deliberate strategy for the company over the last couple of years. For Tangled is fundamentally, an innocent, fun tale. It harks back to Disney's heyday: It is populated by a tried and true Disney archetypes: a classic evil witch of the Cruella de Ville mould, a feisty but fundamentally pre-feminist 18 year-old heroine in Rapunzel herself (in this way contrasting quite markedly with Shrek's Fiona), sidekicks in the form of unlikely but adorable animals, and a cuddly rogues gallery intended only to provide comic relief.And true to this description Tangled is an altogether less knowing, less arch adventure than any of the Pixar outings to date, where you fancy they've targeted the parents and thrown in the odd jokes to keep the kids engaged. Here, this is a kids' movie pure and simple, and is none the worse for it either: as long as you check your cynical fin-du-si&egrave;cle attitude at the door, you'll have a ball.Regular readers will know I'm no great fan of 3D for the sake of it, but here I must say the 3D, and the animation generally, is continually impressive. I find myself rather fatigued by technological advances for the sake of it (well - it's shooting fish in a barrel: after all, there's not much you can't do with enough computer horsepower), but what impresses is the artfulness in which the technology is employed. The sweeping camera angles, clever use of perspective; the beautiful framing of every scene - the musical numbers particularly are brilliantly staged (for me to enjoy them, they'd have to be: I can't stand musicals). A bunch of Pentium processors won't give you that - but it's something Disney has always had a long suit in, and Tangled certainly measures up well against the studio's esteemed standards.In terms of characters, the cast are (to my limited outlook) relative unknowns and perform a workmanlike fashion, and are never allowed get in the way of the animated wizardry (which is how it ought to be in a Disney film). Mandy Moore does a fine job as Rapunzel; Zachary Levy had a little more trouble with Flynn Rider (or perhaps the character was just less appealing) and Donna Murphy seems to have come direct from Central Casting to play the role of Gothel but in any case all, and every other presence on the screen, was blown out of the water by Maximus, a centurion's horse, who was separated from his rider in a chase scene and made the most of his fifteen minutes of fame (they lasted an hour and a half, at any rate!). Somewhat galling, I dare say, for the voice actors to be outdone by an unvoiced animation, and he wasn't even the only one - there's a delightful running gag about a Marcel Marceau mime also!Look, it's not Citizen Kane, but if you're nostalgic for the sorts of films Disney used to make, and you're jaded by the world-weary attitude that seems to infect every ""kids"" movie in the digitally animated era, this one will be a breath of fresh air.Olly Buxton",4,A kingdom for this horse,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,4428,"['Disney', 'going', 'have', 'great', 'year', 'eye-popping', 'TRON',

1406282,AHF97M45JFCB,B004G6009K,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","Long-time readers (sufferers as the case may be) of my critical efforts may have noticed a certain pattern whereby I locate, for purpose of review, animated feature films so obscure that even the individuals responsible for their creation have long forgotten about them.  Usually (but not always), it isn't very difficult for me to find fault in these works but alas, to insure the accuracy of my whole scale of judgment, I proudly visit the latest, greatest, high-budgeted, much hyped, talk-of-the-town animated pieces as well.As such I think it's safe to presume you've heard of Tangled prior to indulging in my evaluation but in case you have not, a brief refresher is in order: Tangled is Disney Studios' computer-generated 2010 big budget retelling of the timeless German fairy tale Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm.Tangled starts at the beginning and not just Rapunzel's beginning but her mother's.  It turns out the pregnant queen needs a bit of a miracle to overcome illness and that miracle comes in the form of a flower said to have come directly from the sun.With a droplet of the flower's potency, the queen overcomes her affliction and gives birth to the baby Princess Rapunzel.  It turns out the flower's amazing abilities not only cured the ill queen but found their way into the hair follicles of the yet unborn child.  Because of the young princess' magical locks, one Mother Gothel kidnaps her from the palace under the veil of darkness.Mother Gothel just so happens to know a thing or two about the flower's magical abilities and decides that she will stave off the effects of aging by locking Rapunzel in her hidden tower.Fast-forward to a 17-year-old Rapunzel with hair over ten times longer than her body; tower ridden and utterly bored when a fleeing bandit by the name of Flynn Ryder takes refuge in her hidden crib.Rapunzel works out a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to the mysterious and perilous land beyond the tower and the adventure ensues the moment her bare feet feel the green grass of the meadow for the first time.So now that we're up to snuff on what Tangled is and how it came to be, the all-important question then centers on entertainment.  Does Tangled deliver in terms of amusement?  Absolutely and perhaps better still, it manages to do so with the first genuine signs of ""classic Disney"" sensibilities that have been largely absent since the industry started making the move from 2D drawn animation to computer generated 3D in the mid-1990s.I could be mistaken of course, but it has long since been my assertion that a majority of the CG features thus far have been created by individuals so awed by the medium itself that what resulted were closer to showcases of the technology first and foremost with story-development taking the back seat.  A sort of ""because we could doesn't mean we should"" mentality.Of course there are exceptions to this trend, many of them in fact coming from the geniuses at Pixar (which has since become absorbed by Disney anyway) on account of the fact that they seemed to be oddly in tune with what kind of stories could lend themselves perfectly to the computer-generated world.Disney, however, hasn't been so successful.  Anyone who has witnessed earlier solo-efforts like Valliant, The Wild, Chicken Little or Bolt can attest to the fact that while passable, none of these films could even come close to mastering the art ala Pixar.  That brings us back to Tangled.  Rather than create another attempt to cut into the lucrative CG glory shared by Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on, Disney finally seems comfortable (or perhaps confident) enough to get back to telling a tale their way- medium be darned.What results is the formula that has made countless prior Disney films ultra-successful: A slightly modernized take on a classic fairy tale, a musically laced prose (yes the characters break out into song quite frequently here), personified animals with just enough actuality left in tact to still be considered realistic, dashing heroes, perfectly timed comedic efforts, evil old ladies and just a touch of magic.  It's all here- the precise recipe that has charmed fans for years across films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and to an extent even Aladdin.  This time however the clarity and attention to detail that can only be achieved via the technique of computer-generated textures factor in to aid the material rather than try to make-up for a lack thereof.At 100-minutes, this film hints toward the marquee's return to longer runtimes and comes feeling as though that is simply how long it takes to weave its tale (rather than rushed to completion or stretched out with filler).The casting is, as is customary for a major Disney effort, spot-on with Mandy Moore doing a bang-up job as the title character and Zachary Levi is equally captivating as Ryder.  Additional props are due to Donna Murphy as Gothel.I came into this piece a bit jaded from the onset, feeling as though the classic fairy tale retold through CG has been done to death.  Perhaps four Shreks, two Happily N'ever Afters, three Unstable Fables, one Pinocchio 3K and countless other attempts will do that to a critic.  However, I must confess to having been swept up in the revelry with Tangled right from the onset.  Truly Disney retains its throne in terms of mastery of facial animation techniques and the hair textures here are absolutely astonishing.By going back to their roots and doing what they do best, Disney has (finally) notched its place in the computer animated feature film hierarchy and has done so without relying upon the Pixar co-brand to make it happen.  Sure John Lasseter's name finds its way to the credits as Executive Producer, it's undeniably apparent that this was a Disney piece through and through.  I like to think that had this one been released back in the 2D era it would have gone by the simple title ""Rapunzel"" but if we have to try to isolate Pixar's influence on the project in some capacity, surly they had to have come up with the hip title.  Ironic when you stop to consider that from a puritan perspective, this is Disney's most untangled computer-generated piece to date.",4,"In A Tale About Hair, Disney Finds Its Roots",1302307200,"04 9,

1406283,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B004G6009K,Oscar L. Colombo,"[0, 0]","First, a little background, to give some perspective as to what the Disney animators have achieved with this movie:The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, great XIX Century scholars of all things related to the German language, collected popular folk stories, refined them, removing blatant inconsistencies to make them easier to understand, eliminating obviously non-Christian and sexual elements, and began publishing their monumental collection of ""Children and House Fairy Tales"" in 1812. In the end it consisted of nearly 300 tales, including ""Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Snow White"", ""Puss in Boots"", ... and ""Rapunzel"".My paternal grandmother used to read me fairy tales at bedtime, or when I was sick in bed, which was often. So she read me ""Rapunzel"". All that I remember of her reading was that a girl with very long hair was locked up by a witch in an isolated tower and used her hair as a rope to lift, with the help of a pulley, the witch. One day a prince happened by, saw her lifting the witch into the tower, fell in love on sight with the hairy maiden, and somehow they ended up married, and lived happily ever after.The actual story was only memorable to me because of the maiden's very long hair (more than 20 yards) and its use as an elevator, as well as the witch's call: ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let your hair down"".The story itself is, briefly, thus: A poor couple is expecting a child. The pregnant mother craves some rapunzel lettuce from their neighbor's garden. The neighbor is an unfriendly witch. The husband climbs her garden's wall, steals lettuce. The wife craves some more. At his second attempt, the witch catches him in the act. They make a deal: her lettuce for their child, when it is born. The child is a girl, they call her ""Rapunzel""; the witch takes her away promising to treat her as her own daughter, which she does, but then locks her up in a room atop a tower once she reaches puberty. A handsome prince happens by, sees her, falls in love, watches in hiding and so figures out how to get in via her hair. The witch, after many a visit by the prince to the little room atop the tower, finds out. When the prince shows up, she confronts him and he jumps out the window. Lands on some briers and the thorns pierce his eyes. He is left to wander in despair for years, while the witch takes Rapunzel, who is now pregnant, to an undisclosed location, far, far away. One day the blind prince stumbles on Rapunzel's hideout, they recognize each other, she cries for joy and her tears restore his sight. They, and their twins, a boy and a girl, go together to the prince's kingdom, where there is great rejoicing, and they live ""happily for a long time afterwards.""Now, about the movie:The tale told in the movie is a very different story: the prince is here a charming rogue, a fugitive of justice, the hair is not just very long, but magical, with life-prolonging and healing properties, and glows when certain incantation is sang. Rapunzel is a princess, and she was kidnapped by the witch, not given to her. Also, she does not get pregnant (she has no occasion, what with all the action). And the story is so changed that now it has also poetic touches and flights of imagination that the Grimm brothers conscientiously avoided. But that was because their purpose was a scholarly one. The creators of the movie worked under no such constraints, and set out to make a swan out of an interesting but rather drab duckling. They succeeded, producing another memorable Disney film. First of all, this is the best CGI animation I remember ever seeing (if only, alas!, in 2-D). The figures are fully animated, with skins that look warm and soft, not plastic-like, as in many otherwise good CGI animation films. The all-important hair truly flows and moves naturally and credibly (and it is moved a lot, being an essential participant in the action), it also looks and feels ""as fine as spun gold"" in the words of the original tale.But there is more here than great technical achievement. There is also sparkling dialog (by some excellent voice actors), some serviceable songs that, at worst, do not get in the way. And very importantly: no cute talking animals, or even remarkable ones -- with one exception.Finally, there are two sequences that, in my opinion, must rank among the best ever in animation history: a dance started spontaneously by Rapunzel, in one of the squares of the kingdom's capital, that then grows and grows in excitement until the dancers reach the point of wild abandon; and the scene in the boat, just after sunset, during the launching of the lanterns that slowly lift into the air, forming a floating, golden constellation, and about which others have already commented with obvious, and deserved, admiration. During these sequences the movie is not only a technical triumph, but also becomes memorable cinematography. With them, it does touch the heart, filling it with enchantment and awe, as only true art can do.And then there is ""Maximus"", the horse. Here is a character that, if there was any justice, should have gotten the ""best supporting actor"" Oscar in the 2010 Academy Awards.It is both a truly horsey and truly intelligent (if non-speaking) individual with lots of attitude.I rarely watch a movie more than once. Because of circumstances beyond my control, I have seen ""Rapunzel"" three times already (always in 2-D), and every time it has been a real pleasure to watch.I firmly believe that this is a movie that will long be remembered for: wondrous animated hair, engaging characters, the two superb sequences already mentioned, and, last but not least, for Maximus, the horse.",5,"Rapunzel,

1406295,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B004G6009K,P. Hardy,"[1, 4]","FOR A FILM that's been in production almost as long, if not longer than,The Princess and The Frog, the film formerly known as Rapunzel, Tangled, has nothing to show for it besides some really glossy animation and some impressive singing and acting from Mandy Moore. While Disney films are notorious for flipping copyright free fair tales or true stories on their heads with their vision or parody of how the tale should go, Tangled goes so far with this concept that it barely even has any relevance with the tale its based off besides the character's name, her impossibly long hair and the situation of being confined in a tower by an old hag that snatched her from her parents. (Originally she was taken by the old woman after Rapunzel's parents struck a deal with her. At least that's how it went in version I read byPaul O. Zelinsky(if I recall correctly) which everyone should pick up and read because its amazing).---- TANGLED begins with a disembodied narration of Flynn Ryder (or Eugene Fitzherbert) describing in witty detail how the circumstances around the girl known as Rapunzel came to be. At some unknown point of time, a ""drop of the sun"" from the heavens and landed upon a plant. And old woman, Lady Gothel, discovers it and learns that it grant her eternal youth if she sings to the plant. Meanwhile, the woman who would give birth to Rapunzel fell sick around the time she was supposed to be giving birth to her (I think) and the kingdom was at a loss as to how to help her. By twist of fate the kingdom's guardsmen come across the magical flower when Gothel fails to hide it properly in a rush to hide from them. The plant is then used as a medicine to revive the Rapunzel's mother and in no time she gives birth to a beauty baby daughter with sunshine hair.Not long after her birth, Gothel sneaks into her bedroom and attempts to steal a lock of her hair, but upon cutting it the hair looses its magical qualities and thus Gothel decides to snatch the baby in full and Rapunzel's parents are left grief stricken when their child is taken from them. Rapunzel lives the next eighteen years of her life in seclusion with ""Mother Gothel"", who fills the girl's head with fears of the outside world and the promise that everyone wants to chop her hair off. Upon the day before Rapunzel's birthday, a thief named Flynn Ryder steals the crown of the lost princess and double crosses his partner's in crime.After a close encounter with a royal horse named Maximus (who, along pretty much all the soldiers in the kingdom, are hellbent on catching Flynn to the point of hilarious obsession), he comes across Rapunzel's tower, takes refuge inside and is promptly defeated by a simple whack to the head by Rapunzel's frying pan.With Flynn as her captive (who fails repeatedly to charm himself out of her hair and out of the tower, quite literally), she strikes a deal with him. He is to take her out of the tower to see the magical floating lights for her 18th Birthday while her ""Mother"" is away from the tower. However, what was supposed to be a simple excursion outdoors and Flynn's meager a attempt to get his hidden ""spoils of war"" from Rapunzel, turns into a chaotic two(?) days when the kingdom's soldiers catch up with them and Mother Gothel returns early and finds her ""Daughter"" missing from the tower-----For all intents and purposes, likeTron: Legacyafter it, Tangled is in too much of a rush to get into the meat and potatoes of its storyline to focus on any sort of development for character or story (those healthy vegetables). While the Paul O. Zelinsky book allowed you to get to know the parents on some marginal level, Rapunzel's parents here are just voiceless characters akin to that of Aurora's parents inSleeping Beautynear the end of that film. The voice narration at the beginning and the end is so rushed it leaves the viewer (or me) wanting more than what they got. You never create any sense of attachment for these characters, not even Flynn Ryder or Rapunzel herself. And the thing that killed the movie the most was the Dues Ex Machina ploy in which Rapunzel remembers her entire past life in a blurry montage via baby vision. Insult me why don't you Disney? I would've liked it better if someone had sat her aside after the crisis was over and explained her situation to her or better yet, have Gothel do that stupid Villain Monologue and accidentally slip the truth to her.Rapunzel for all her perky adorableness falls on the short side of a interesting character. While is true enough that she's the true hero of the film and the only one that appears to get any sort of character development tailor made for all ""Disney Princesses"" of past generations (with the exceptions of Mulan, Tiana, Belle and Pocahontas who are true examples of characterization that don't fall on the ""spoiled child learns her lesson"" or ""romantic, waiting for her prince to come [and rescue her]"" tropes), the writing that surrounds the character never lifts her up to the Plato of the aforementioned female heroines. Mandy Moore's acting and singing on the other hand, are exemplary; the one scene that probably made me laugh was Rapunzel's constant back and forth of ""BEST DAY EVER!"" and ""OH, I'M SUCH A TERRIBLE DAUGHTER!"" when she finally leaves the tower for the first time.While Zachary Levi's comic timing falls somewhere between excellent and bland, the character this movie's PR campaign spent so much time promoting to the masses, in hopes of garnering a larger male audience, is also not as hilarious as they would have you believe. Flynn Ryder's evolution to self-serving thief who'd double cross you in a heartbeat and further more attempt to slink his way out of the retribution that he's got coming, to the man who falls in love with Rapunzel and finds there more in life worth fighting for (besides stolen goods and the like) is just a non-event. The ""romance"" between Rapunzel and Ryder was so rushed and lacking of any real spark that I wondered why they even tried to begin with.Their relationship never seemed to rise above the ""cute friendship"" as there is little to no development in their relationship (believable enough for me to buy it). The ""death scene"" wasn't even long enough to monetarily mourn the passing of Eugene because his revival happened almost barely five minutes after he got shanked by Mother Gothel. And while we're on the subject, Mother Gothel is probably one of the weakest Disney Villains in the entire history of their villains (unless I can think of someone else), with her only positive points being the design of her character. Also, her death scene was probably only second to McLeech (Rescuers Down Under) or Clayton (Tarzan) in the long line of lame ""implied deaths"".Neither the horse or the tiny lizard (you truly DO forget is in the movie because he's that small) are funny as they should've been. I will admit that the begrudging truce subplot between Maximus and Flynn was amusing. However, most of the humor in this movie just got a chuckle and one or two laughs from me, everything felt terribly forced or too tried to be too witty for its own good; everything to the humor at Flynn's expense to the amended Will Smith line:""Oh, I've got to get me one of these!"", just tried too hard to make you laugh. And the musical themes were terribly forgettable, which surprised me because this is a DISNEY MOVIE. They may not have hit the nail on the head everytime in the days of old, but to have a film that's COMPLETELY devoid of a memorable theme? That's a first! There wasn't a single lyric from the themes that I could remember after the movie ended and the DVD was out of the player. They never hit home with the emotions, the thieves song was just ""there"" killing time and the duet theme was especially bland outside of the complimentary vocal harmony between Moore and Levi.Overall, the best thing about Tangled is the CGI, you'll most likely spend more time focusing all the little details in the movement of the fabric and the character's expressions when they speak (exaggerated as they are). Whatever their intentions, Tangled lacks heart and it lacks a serious attention to detail for its story. Everything feels as though it just wants to get done and over with and as it stands this film is a major step down from The Princess and the Frog, which combined everything great and special about past 2D animated Disney films of the 1990s into one neat package. One that left a lasting impression on me. Tangled, on the other hand, doesn't even scratch the surface of ""memorable"" or ""remarkable"" outside of its technical achievements.

It is!  First off, I like this movie a lot.  It's an 8.5/10 for me, but that's not what I'm reviewing.  I watched Avatar, Finding Nemo and Tangled in 3D the first night I had my 3D TV (yes, my eyes were tired when I was done, it was a bit much) and I wanted to give feedback on which movies are worth buying (or especially buying again) for 3D.Tangled blew me away in 3D.  Nemo really didn't even compare, obviuosly partly because it wasn't originally made to be 3D.  And honestly as a whole, it was more impressive than Avatar.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few scenes in Avatar that blow you away in 3D, but there are a lot of filler scenes that are either not very impressive or sometimes almost look ""too 3D"" if that even makes since like the seen where Jake wakes up out of his sleeping chamber at the beginning.  For me, Avatar almost created a sense of nausea, like parts of my brain were conflicted like it knew there wasn't as much depth as the eyes were seeing (sorry if that doesn't make a lick of sense).Tangled is gorgeous in 3D through the entire movie.  Every blade of grass, Rapunzel's hair and especially the Lanterns just look amazing.

1406305,A29XMCU3LHV9NB,B004G6009K,Prince Charming,"[2, 2]","Our entire family loves Tangled, the story of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider.  It is up there with the classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.The story begins with a drop of sunlight falling to Earth and a magic golden flower sprouting.  An old woman finds it and discovers if she sings to it she becomes young again.  She hides the flower for many, many years until the pregnant queen falls ill and the king's men go searching for it.  She accidentally knocks the basket covering it over and they find the flower, pick it, and the queen drinks a tonic and is cured.  Rapunzel is born and her hair contains the magic of the flower.The old woman, named Gothel, breaks into Rapunzel's room and finds that when she sings, Rapunzel's hair glows and works its magic.  Incidentally, the baby version of Rapunzel is seriously adorable. Gothel tries to take just a lock of the hair but when she cuts it, it shrivels up and turns brown.  She then takes the baby and escapes, raising her as her own and forbidding the child to ever go outside to &#34;protect her&#34; from the bad world.Rapunzel grows up with her only friend, a chameleon named Paschal.  She is cheerful, happy, but somewhat bored.  Every year she notices floating lanterns on her birthday and wants to get a closer look.  She asks Mother Gothel if she can go see the lanterns for her 18th birthday.  Gothel refuses and gets angry.  Rapunzel gets smart and asks Gothel for some special paints that will entail a 3 day trip for Gothel and Gothel agrees.  She leaves.Meanwhile, Flynn Rider and his pals are stealing Rapunzel's crown from the palace and escaping.  He ditches his thief buddies and climbs up Rapunzel's tower to hide out.  She clocks him with a frying pan and ties him up with her hair.  She holds the crown hostage and says he can have it back after he takes her to see the floating lanterns.  He finally agrees and they leave the tower.Flynn takes Rapunzel to a local tavern, the Snuggly Duckling, for lunch to freak her out but she wins over the thugs and ruffians with a song and dance.  They help the two escape when the palace guards come looking for Flynn.  Meanwhile, Mother Gothel hatches her own plan to get Rapunzel back when she comes back early and sees Rapunzel is gone from the tower.*Spoiler alert if you continue reading*Rapunzel and Flynn fall in love as they see the floating lights but afterward his thief buddies capture him and corner Rapunzel and Gothel (who has been scheming with them) knocks them out and &#34;saves&#34; Rapunzel.  Flynn is sent to the palace where they are going to execute him but Maximus (a palace horse) and the ruffians from the Snuggly Duckling save him.  Meanwhile, Rapunzel figures out that she is the lost princess and that Gothel is the enemy.Flynn comes to save Rapunzel but Gothel stabs him when he enters the tower.  She plans to leave him for dead and run away with Rapunzel.  Rapunzel tells her she will always try to escape Gothel and will only go with her willingly if she is allowed to save Flynn with her magic hair.  Gothel reluctantly agrees.  Before Rapunzel can heal Flynn, he cuts her hair off with a shard of broken glass and it turns brown.  Gothel starts aging, falls out the window, and is dust before she hits the ground.  Rapunzel starts crying over Flynn as he &#34;dies&#34; and her tear falls on him and heals him.  The happy couple goes to the palace where she is reunited with her parents, the queen and king, and the whole kingdom celebrates.  Ultimately, the happy couple becomes engaged (see the short &#34;Tangled Ever After&#34; for the wedding).Overall, a wonderful Disney movie filled with memorable and catchy songs and far superior to &#34;Brave&#34; and &#34;The Princess and the Frog&#34; (the movies that came out before and after Tangled).

1406309,AQR22MPF45M3P,B004G6009K,Rachel Ford,"[0, 0]","As someone who grew up watching Disney (and other animated) movies and appreciates the art form as much as live action films for its freedom and creative license, I'm often one of the few childless adults in the theater when new animated films come out. There have been a rash of really good animated movies lately, and I was excited about this one. I think, for kids, this movie hits the mark very well; for adults, it's good but not quite classic material.The story has all the potential to be a classic, and the animation - while not the quite the same style as the hand-drawn classics - has its own charm that makes up for the occasional plasticy look. Mother Gothel (the villain) had the potential to be a villain on par with Frollo (Hunchback of Notre Dame) himself - a weaselly, malicious, evil user who plays mind games to keep their charge in line. And the music was beautiful, with good to great lyrics (depending on the song). So why on earth did they choose a pop singer for their music, or turn Mother Gothel's potential complex and brilliant character into a snide, obvious, one-dimensional meanie?The great music from the Disney classics is great because it is sung by people with the proper vocal range and steady voices; perhaps most importantly of all, they are singing to make beautiful music, not because of their trademark genre. From Hunchback of Notre Dame to Aladdin, Mulan to Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas to Sleeping Beauty, these songs are memorable for their classic beauty. No offense to Mandy Moore - who is a fine pop singer - but her singing was not at all suited for this role, and strongly detracted from the film.As for Mother Gothel's character, her constant snide-jabs-followed-by-quick-apologies had the effect of weakening the character greatly. I know people like this - who insult you and then laugh it off with, ""Sorry, just kidding."" Other than themselves, I don't know anyone who thinks they are clever or witty; they are clearly, obviously nasty, and not even terribly intelligent in going about voicing their malice. Gothel, however, is not supposed to be an annoying, mean dimwit; she's supposed to be very clever and manipulative. Had they had her insult without offering apologies, or insult without laughing it off - and, when Rapunzel was insulted, chided her for being too touchy or sensitive, the effect would have been much better. She would not only have been mean and hurt her daughter's feelings, but she would have then laid a guilt trip on her as well for being ""too sensitive"". (I've known people like this, too, and they are a heck of a lot more effective than the other type). Disney * tried * to do this, but failed - instead, Mother Gothel comes across as a mean (but obviously so), catty, snide witch, rather than a clever manipulator. Instead of a female Frollo personality, they got a mosquito.These were my two biggest gripes with this movie, and what, to me, kept it from 5-star-classic material. Now, that said, this is still a good film - and one of the best ones Disney has put out in years, literally. Younger kids will probably not notice either of these points, and older ones may or may not find them as significant as I did.

And it still nags at me.Was it the message to young girls?  I think partly.  In order for Rapunzel to be ""normal"" person she has to lose part of her beauty?  I think you can be both, and not have to chance your physical appearance to do so.  I think if Rapunzel had been artificially been made into some golden haired enchantress, and all the negative overtones flowing from that were shown, then this would have been a better film.  But, as it stands now, Rapunzel needed to mutilate herself in order to be with her family, as well as lose her magical gift, which was only shown to work once or twice in the film in the first place.  That bothers me.  But, then again, maybe I'm over-thinking it.The bright point for this film is the humor.  Unlike some of Disney's other offerings the humor in this film makes sense.  It's a little cliche here and there, but it makes people laugh and is harmless, albeit somewhat silly.All in all it's a decent watch.

I don't really remember being so awed by a cartoon until many years later when I saw Beauty and the Beast.  Lion King, of course, is in a class by itself.  Now I must add Tangled to the list of great Disney animation.  I never expected to see an animated film this well done again in my lifetime.  The characters are exceptional.  Rapunzel is an absolute delight.  I cannot imagine how Rapunzel could be improved.  The villain, Mother Gothel, is a complex, chilling character, again nearly perfect.  The music is divine.  The songs and dance (this is a musical) are wonderfully Broadway-like.  Except for the fancy new animation technology, this film could have been made, as is, in any Disney era, all the way back to the time of Snow White.  That is great praise indeed.

Rapunzel, with the help of Flynn (the handsome rogue) decides she needs to experience the outside world and leaves the tower. The emotions erupt...guilt to excitement and then the real story begins.

1406334,A4FX5YCJA630V,B004G6009K,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[1, 1]","It seems a little strange that it took Disney this long to adapt ""Rapunzel"" for the big screen, for it seems the natural sequel to the myraid of other fairytale movies that they've released over the years. Apparently Walt Disney himself was exploring the possibilities that the story afforded way back in the 1940s, but it's only now that the company has put their own spin on the tale and released it under the title of ""Tangled"" - apparently so as not to alienate a young male audience. I'm not sure why they bothered since every child I've come across, boy or girl, invariably calls this movie ""Rapunzel"".The original fairytale is rife with symbolism and unanswered questions. There, the infant girl is spirited away from her parents as part of a deal her father made after he was caught stealing rampion from a witch's garden to sate his wife's cravings. In that version, the grieving parents never see their daughter again, and the stolen child is called Rapunzel by the witch, whose names her after the edible plant that led the child's father into her garden in the first place.But the witch cares for Rapunzel until her twelfth birthday, at which time she moves her foster-daughter into a tower deep in the forest, seen and heard by no one besides herself. So isolated is the girl that the only way in and out of the tower is for the witch to use her impossibly long hair as a ladder - a security measure that is thwarted when a passing prince hears Rapunzel's singing voice and discovers the way up into her rooms...The Disney version plays out a little differently. Here Rapunzel is called as such by her birth parents, not poor cottagers but the king and queen of a prosperous kingdom. When the queen sickens prior to her daughter's birth, the citizens of the kingdom go in search of a flower that is said to have grown from a drop of sunlight, imbued with mystical healing properties. This they find and administer to the queen - but unbeknownst to them a sorceress by the name of Gothel was using the flower to keep herself youthful.She therefore slips into the palace under the cover of darkness and steals the baby away, the flower's magic having transferred to Rapunzel's beautiful golden hair. It is to keep Rapunzel secret, not safe, that Mother Gothel keeps her locked away in a tower, visiting periodically in order to glean magical youth from her ""daughter's"" hair.The original fairytale offers little in the way of why the witch might want to steal away a child, but you can see the potential for crafting a powerful and potent villain from the source material. The archetype of the Malevolent Mother is a compelling figure, all the more so because her power does not come from strength or sorcery, but from emotional manipulation and psychological control. It's actually quite harrowing to watch as Disney's spin on the character expertly handles Rapunzel with a series of put-downs, passive-aggressive comments, condescending pats on the head, and subtle insults that always end with the phrase ""just teasing!""After the lengthy introduction, the story starts proper when Rapunzel is eighteen years old. Her hair is impossibly long and beautifully golden, imbibed with healing powers and apparently elastic in quality given her ability to swing, lasso, whip and climb it, apparently with no harmful effects to her scalp. But the teenager is tired of her monotonous lifestyle, and begins dropping hints to her mother that she's ready to leave the nest - but Mother Gothel will hear none of it.The chance for escape comes in the form of Flynn Rider, a thief that has just stolen a tiara from the palace and stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower as he makes his escape. She knocks him out with her frying pan, hides the tiara, ties him to a chair, and makes a deal with him: in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns that appear every night of her birthday, she'll return his stolen treasure. Though reluctant, Flynn agrees and the adventure begins...The colour scheme of the film is beautiful. It's like a series of oil paintings done in luminous pastel shades, and there's a subtle but lovely use of the colour palette and various symbols to connect Rapunzel's longing for the outside world with her instinctual awareness of her true parents. Things such as the Chinese lanterns, a stylized sun, the colour purple and the tiara all guide Rapunzel to her true home, and the film uses these repeating images, motifs and colours to paint a richly animated world of beauty and magic.The climatic scene does end with a rather shameless ""deus ex machina"" lifted straight from the fairytale (it works there, but just feels a bit random here) and Rapunzel's requisite ""cute animal sidekick"" feels a little superfluous, but ""Tangled"" is an interesting take on an old fairytale, giving it the Disney treatment by infusing it with backstory, songs, gags and romance. Perhaps it doesn't *quite* recapture the magic of the Disney Renaissance, but it's sweet and charming and beautiful to look at.",4,"""I've Got a Dream!""",1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,5003,"['little', 'strange', 'took', 'Disney', 'long', 'adapt', 'Rapunzel', 'big', 'screen', 'natural', 'sequel', 'myraid', 'other', 'fairytale', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'released', 'years', 'Apparently', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'exploring', 'possibilities', 'story', 'afforded', 'way', 'back', '1940s', 'only', 'now', 'company', 'put', 'own', 'spin', 'tale', 'released', 'title', 'Tangled', 'apparently', 'so', 'not', 'alienate', 'young', 'male', 'audience', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'bothered', 'child', ""'ve"", 'come', 'boy', 'girl', 'invariably', 'movie', 'Rapunzel', '.The', 'original', 'fairytale', 'rife', 'symbolism', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'infant', 'girl', 'spirited', 'away', 'parents', 'part', 'deal', 'father', 'made', 'was', 'caught', 'stealing', 'rampion', 'witch', 'garden', 'sate', 'wife', 'cravings', 'version', 'grieving', 'parents', 'never', 'see', 'daughter', 'again', 'stolen', 'child', 'called', 'Rapunzel', 'witch', 'names', 'edible', 'plant', 'led', 'child', 'father', 'garden', 'first', 'witch', 'Rapunzel', 'twelfth', 'birthday', 'time', 'foster-daughter', 'tower', 'deep', 'forest', 'seen', 'heard', 'one', 'So', 'isolated', 'girl', 'only', 'way', 'tower', 'witch', 'use', 'impossibly', 'long', 'hair', 'ladder', 'security', 'measure', 'thwarted', 'when', 'passing', 'prince', 'Rapunzel', 'singing', 'voice', 'way', 'up', 'rooms', 'Disney', 'version', 'out', 'little', 'differently', 'Here', 'Rapunzel', 'called', 'such', 'birth', 'parents', 'not', 'poor', 'cottagers', 'king', 'queen', 'prosperous', 'kingdom', 'When', 'queen', 'prior', 'daughter', 'birth', 'citizens', 'kingdom', 'go', 'search', 'flower', 'said', 'have', 'grown', 'drop', 'sunlight', 'imbued', 'mystical', 'healing', 'properties', 'find', 'administer', 'queen', 'unbeknownst', 'sorceress', 'name', 'Gothel', 'was', 'using', 'flower', 'keep', 'youthful.She', 'therefore', 'palace', 'cover', 'darkness', 'baby', 'away', 'flower', 'magic', 'having', 'transferred', 'Rapunzel', 'beautiful', 'golden', 'hair', 'keep', 'Rapunzel', 'secret', 'not', 'safe', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'locked', 'away', 'tower', 'visiting', 'periodically', 'order', 'glean', 'magical', 'youth', 'daughter', 'hair.The', 'original', 'fairytale', 'offers', 'little', 'way', 'why', 'witch', 'might', 'want', 'steal', 'away', 'child', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'crafting', 'powerful', 'potent', 'villain', 'source', 'material', 'archetype', 'Malevolent', 'Mother', 'compelling', 'figure', 'more', 'so', 'power', 'not', 'come', 'strength', 'sorcery', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'psychological', 'control', 'actually', 'quite', 'harrowing', 'watch', 'Disney', 'spin', 'character', 'expertly', 'Rapunzel', 'series', 'put-downs', 'passive-aggressive', 'comments', 'condescending', 'pats', 'head', 'subtle', 'insults', 'always', 'end', 'phrase', 'just', 'teasing', 'lengthy', 'introduction', 'story', 'when', 'Rapunzel', 'eighteen', 'years', 'old', 'hair', 'impossibly', 'long', 'beautifully', 'golden', 'imbibed', 'healing', 'powers', 'apparently', 'elastic', 'quality', 'given', 'ability', 'swing', 'lasso', 'whip', 'climb', 'apparently', 'harmful', 'effects', 'scalp', 'teenager', 'tired', 'monotonous', 'lifestyle', 'dropping', 'hints', 'mother', 'ready', 'leave', 'nest', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'will', 'hear', 'none', 'it.The', 'chance', 'escape', 'form', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'thief', 'just', 'stolen', 'tiara', 'palace', 'stumbles', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'escape', 'out', 'frying', 'pan', 'tiara', 'chair', 'deal', 'exchange', 'taking', 'see', 'lanterns', 'appear', 'night', 'birthday', ""'ll"", 'return', 'stolen', 'treasure', 'Though', 'reluctant', 'Flynn', 'adventure', 'colour', 'scheme', 'film', 'beautiful', 'series', 'oil', 'paintings', 'done', 'luminous', 'pastel', 'shades', 'subtle', 'lovely', 'use', 'colour', 'palette', 'various', 'symbols', 'connect', 'Rapunzel', 'longing', 'outside', 'world', 'instinctual', 'awareness', 'true', 'parents', 'Things', 'such', 'Chinese', 'lanterns', 'stylized', 'sun', 'colour', 'purple', 'tiara', 'guide', 'Rapunzel', 'true', 'home', 'film', 'repeating', 'images', 'motifs', 'colours', 'paint', 'richly', 'animated', 'world', 'beauty', 'magic.The', 'climatic', 'scene', 'end', 'rather', 'shameless', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'lifted', 'straight', 'fairytale', 'there', 'just', 'feels', 'bit', 'random', 'here', 'Rapunzel', 'requisite', 'cute', 'animal', 'sidekick', 'little', 'superfluous', 'Tangled', 'interesting', 'take', 'old', 'fairytale', 'giving', 'Disney', 'treatment', 'infusing', 'backstory', 'songs', 'gags', 'romance', 'Perhaps', ""n't"", '*quite*', 'recapture', 'magic', 'Disney', 'Renaissance', 'sweet', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'look']",N/A

But a slow Sunday afternoon came around, and having seen pretty much everything else...I was coaxed into attending.  And now the film is on my Top 10 for 2010 list!This is a Disney picture, with the graphic sensibilities of a Pixar film.  I know the two companies are allied, but what I mean is this:  Pixar has had the corner on smart, modern looking, genre-twisting films.  Nary a fairy-tale in sight.  And Disney has the lock on the ""princess"" fairy tale.  Heroine tackles adventures, including some kind of wicked witch-type character, with the help of her animal sidekicks and to a greater-or-lesser degree, the help of a male character destined to be her one true love.  And generally, the Disney movie is in the old, hand-drawn style (such as the excellent PRINCESS AND THE FROG).But with TANGLED, we get a terrific ""princess"" story, coupled with outstanding CGI animation from Pixar.  It's in 3D, and features the best 3D of the year, in my opinion.  There's a gorgeous scene where thousands of paper lanterns are released into the night sky at once, and as they carry over a lake, their number is multiplied by the reflection in the water.  The moment is jaw-dropping in its beauty...and to be honest, it's worth the price of the 3D upgrade.TANGLED is the story (loosely) of Rapunzel...the girl who is kept in a tall tower by a wicked old woman who accesses the tower by climbing Rapunzel's LOOOONG hair.  In this film, Rapunzel isn't merely rescued by a roaming prince.  She's spunky, smart and nave about the world about her.  She yearns to leave, even for a short time...and when fate puts a reluctant rescuer in her path (in the form of Flynn Rider...a charming bandit), she sets off on an adventure full of excitement, humor & romance.  And Rapunzel, with her blonde hair and green eyes, looks refreshingly different from Disney beauties of the past.It sounds very tired...but trust me, Disney makes all the old stand-by themes seem new and fresh.  The animal sidekicks:  a cute-as-can-be chameleon and a tough-as-nails horse.  Song about yearning to see another part of the world:  yep, but it's cute and touching.  Colorful villains: check, but this gang gets to sing one of the funniest songs since Gaston used antlers in his decorating in BEAUTY & THE BEAST.  Chase scenes:  a couple of good ones, including one featuring a collapsing dam.  Pretty scenery:  yep.  This movie has it all.There are minor problems here and there.  A king and queen who never speak for some reason.  Flynn looks vaguely generic (he's a fun character, though).  But really, the film delivered all I could hope for.  See it...and don't just drag the kids; bring the adults too!",5,"Enjoyable blend of traditional Disney sensibilities with a modern, Pixar influence",1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,2775,"['was', 'not', 'terribly', 'enthusiastic', 'seeing', 'TANGLED', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'several', 'weeks', 'slow', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'came', 'around', 'having', 'seen', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'coaxed', 'attending', 'now', 'film', 'Top', '10', '2010', 'list', 'Disney', 'picture', 'graphic', 'sensibilities', 'Pixar', 'film', 'know', 'two', 'companies', 'are', 'allied', 'what', 'mean', 'Pixar', 'had', 'corner', 'smart', 'modern', 'looking', 'genre-twisting', 'films', 'Nary', 'fairy-tale', 'sight', 'Disney', 'lock', 'princess', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Heroine', 'adventures', 'including', 'kind', 'wicked', 'witch-type', 'character', 'help', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'greater-or-lesser', 'degree', 'help', 'male', 'character', 'destined', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'generally', 'Disney', 'movie', 'old', 'hand-drawn', 'style', 'such', 'excellent', 'PRINCESS', 'THE', 'FROG', '.But', 'TANGLED', 'get', 'terrific', 'princess', 'story', 'coupled', 'outstanding', 'CGI', 'animation', 'Pixar', '3D', 'best', '3D', 'year', 'opinion', 'gorgeous', 'scene', 'where', 'thousands', 'paper', 'lanterns', 'are', 'released', 'night', 'sky', 'once', 'carry', 'lake', 'number', 'multiplied', 'reflection', 'water', 'moment', 'jaw-dropping', 'beauty', 'be', 'honest', 'price', '3D', 'upgrade.TANGLED', 'story', 'loosely', 'Rapunzel', 'girl', 'who', 'kept', 'tall', 'tower', 'wicked', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'tower', 'climbing', 'Rapunzel', 'LOOOONG', 'hair', 'film', 'Rapunzel', ""n't"", 'merely', 'rescued', 'roaming', 'prince', 'spunky', 'smart', 'nave', 'world', 'leave', 'even', 'short', 'time', 'when', 'fate', 'reluctant', 'rescuer', 'path', 'form', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'charming', 'bandit', 'off', 'adventure', 'full', 'excitement', 'humor', 'romance', 'Rapunzel', 'blonde', 'hair', 'green', 'eyes', 'refreshingly', 'different', 'Disney', 'beauties', 'past.It', 'very', 'tired', 'trust', 'Disney', 'old', 'stand-by', 'themes', 'seem', 'new', 'fresh', 'animal', 'sidekicks', 'cute-as-can-be', 'chameleon', 'tough-as-nails', 'horse', 'Song', 'yearning', 'see', 'part', 'world', 'yep', 'cute', 'touching', 'Colorful', 'villains', 'check', 'gang', 'sing', 'one', 'funniest', 'songs', 'Gaston', 'used', 'antlers', 'decorating', 'BEAUTY', 'THE', 'BEAST', 'Chase', 'scenes', 'couple', 'good', 'ones', 'including', 'one', 'featuring', 'collapsing', 'dam', 'Pretty', 'scenery', 'yep', 'movie', 'are', 'minor', 'problems', 'here', 'there', 'king', 'queen', 'who', 'never', 'speak', 'reason', 'Flynn', 'vaguely', 'generic', 'fun', 'character', 'though', 'really', 'film', 'delivered', 'could', 'hope', 'See', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'drag', 'kids', 'bring', 'adults', 'too']",N/A
1406336,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004G6009K,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","&lt;strong>Tangled&lt;/strong> (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, 2010)I am a believer, and a firm one, in the caveat that ""Disney corrupts, absolute Disney corrupts absolutely."" And yet I have to give them credit where credit is due. Disney pretty much holds a lock on naked emotional manipulation through cute anthropomorphic animals (in this case, a chameleon and a horse, who play straight men to the female and male, respectively, romantic leads) and songs that sound like they were written after the consultation of what's-hip trend reports, rather than being from the heart. All of which is a long way of saying that I really liked &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, though I hate myself for really liking it, and I understand all the reasons why I shouldn't like it. But there it is.Plot: loosely based on the Rapunzel fairy tale, so the main character's name, Rapunzel (teen singing sensation Mandy Moore), make perfect sense. As we open, Rapunzel is stolen from the royal crib by an evil old witch, Gothel (&lt;em>Spider-Man 2&lt;/em>'s Donna Murphy), because the royal guard harvested the flower Gothel uses to keep herself young to try and save the queen's baby in the womb. Which worked, obviously, but now the magic of the flower can only be found in Rapunzel's hair... as long as it's not cut. Fast-forward umpteen years, as we're never quite sure how old Rapunzel is in the bulk of the film, and Rapunzel, who has never left Gothel's hidden tower, is bored, restless, wants to see the world, and has seventy-foot-long hair that provides the only entrance to Gothel's tower. Not that anyone but Gothel needs it, and she only goes out for monthly trips to the market. Enter Flynn Rider (&lt;em>Chuck&lt;/em>'s Zachary Levi), a small-time crook on the run both from the law--in the persona of Maximus, a horse of the royal guard who kept up the hunt when the humans abandoned it--and his former associates, whom Rider left to be captured, getting away with their latest acquisition--the royal tiara. While hiding, Rider stumbles into the hidden valley where Gothel's tower is located while she's off to market, touching off a long string of events that lead to, well, all the stuff you expect from a Disney princess film.It's all phenomenally cute, and you can't help but admire the animation, which co-director Byron Howard envisioned as a blend of traditional Disney animation and CGI (and how they pulled it off I'm not sure I will ever know). And yet there's always a voice in the back of my head telling me exactly how much I'm being manipulated by every last aspect of this film. To its credit, &lt;em>Tangled&lt;/em>, like most Disney films, is absolutely transparent about this, and so I guess I should give it points for honesty. I definitely give it points for the fact that I just don't care as much as I should about how certain minor characters are there just to advance the plot, and that whole ""the songs sound like they were written by committee"" thing; if you're going to hire a major recording star, why not let her write her own stuff? (And the switch some years ago from hiring straight voice actors to hiring major stars is a whole other rant in itself, and it's infuriating, and I'll stop now or we'll be here all day on that subject.)And yet despite all that I'm attacking all the things about the movie that SHOULD be attacked is how much I enjoyed the silly thing. Yes, it's predictable, as predictable as any Disney princess movie, and yes, you will know from the outset this film is manipulating you (the first line of spoken dialogue, from Flynn Rider's voiceover: ""this is the story of how I died.""), and it doesn't matter one bit. No matter how hard you resist, you will be assimilated, at least for the hour and a half it takes to watch this movie. *** ",4,Succeeds despite itself.,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",2011,3783,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Tangled', 'lt', '>', 'Nathan', 'Greno', 'Byron', 'Howard', '2010', 'am', 'believer', 'firm', 'one', 'caveat', 'Disney', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'Disney', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', 'yet', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'Disney', 'pretty', 'much', 'lock', 'naked', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'cute', 'anthropomorphic', 'animals', 'case', 'chameleon', 'horse', 'who', 'play', 'straight', 'men', 'female', 'male', 'respectively', 'romantic', 'leads', 'songs', 'sound', 'were', 'written', 'consultation', ""what's-hip"", 'trend', 'reports', 'rather', 'being', 'heart', 'long', 'way', 'saying', 'really', 'liked', 'lt', '>', 'Tangled', 'lt', '>', 'hate', 'really', 'liking', 'understand', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'is.Plot', 'loosely', 'based', 'Rapunzel', 'fairy', 'tale', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'Rapunzel', 'teen', 'singing', 'sensation', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'open', 'Rapunzel', 'stolen', 'royal', 'crib', 'evil', 'old', 'witch', 'Gothel', 'lt', '>', 'Spider-Man', '2', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'royal', 'guard', 'harvested', 'flower', 'Gothel', 'keep', 'young', 'try', 'save', 'queen', 'baby', 'womb', 'Which', 'worked', 'obviously', 'now', 'magic', 'flower', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'cut', 'Fast-forward', 'umpteen', 'years', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'old', 'Rapunzel', 'bulk', 'film', 'Rapunzel', 'who', 'never', 'left', 'Gothel', 'hidden', 'tower', 'bored', 'restless', 'see', 'world', 'seventy-foot-long', 'hair', 'only', 'entrance', 'Gothel', 'tower', 'Not', 'anyone', 'Gothel', 'only', 'out', 'monthly', 'trips', 'market', 'Enter', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'lt', '>', 'Chuck', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'small-time', 'crook', 'run', 'law', 'persona', 'Maximus', 'horse', 'royal', 'guard', 'who', 'kept', 'up', 'hunt', 'when', 'humans', 'abandoned', 'former', 'associates', 'whom', 'Rider', 'left', 'be', 'captured', 'getting', 'away', 'latest', 'acquisition', 'royal', 'tiara', 'hiding', 'Rider', 'hidden', 'valley', 'where', 'Gothel', 'tower', 'located', 'off', 'market', 'touching', 'off', 'long', 'string', 'events', 'lead', 'well', 'stuff', 'expect', 'Disney', 'princess', 'film.It', 'phenomenally', 'cute', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'admire', 'animation', 'co-director', 'Byron', 'Howard', 'envisioned', 'blend', 'traditional', 'Disney', 'animation', 'CGI', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'ever', 'know', 'yet', 'always', 'voice', 'back', 'head', 'telling', 'exactly', 'how', 'much', ""'m"", 'being', 'manipulated', 'last', 'aspect', 'film', 'credit', 'lt', '>', 'Tangled', 'lt', '>', 'most', 'Disney', 'films', 'absolutely', 'transparent', 'so', 'guess', 'should', 'give', 'honesty', 'definitely', 'give', 'fact', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'how', 'certain', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'advance', 'plot', 'whole', 'songs', 'sound', 'were', 'written', 'committee', 'thing', ""'re"", 'going', 'hire', 'major', 'recording', 'star', 'why', 'not', 'let', 'write', 'own', 'stuff', 'switch', 'years', 'ago', 'hiring', 'straight', 'voice', 'actors', 'hiring', 'major', 'stars', 'whole', 'other', 'rant', 'infuriating', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'now', ""'ll"", 'be', 'here', 'day', 'subject', 'yet', ""'m"", 'attacking', 'things', 'movie', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'attacked', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'silly', 'thing', 'Yes', 'predictable', 'as', 'predictable', 'Disney', 'princess', 'movie', 'yes', 'will', 'know', 'outset', 'film', 'manipulating', 'first', 'line', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'voiceover', 'story', 'how', 'died', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'bit', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'resist', 'will', 'be', 'assimilated', 'least', 'hour', 'half', 'watch', 'movie', '***']",N/A

1406344,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B004G6009K,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, ""Tangled"" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to ""reality"" than most such films - if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose ""Prince Charming"" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside.  But ""Tangled"" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena.  There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary).  The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world.  Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty.  However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this nave but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years.  So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.""Tangled"" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick - indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room - and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust.  The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy.  The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, ""Tangled"" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness.  It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements.  It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence.  And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.",4,"refreshingly ""square"" and straight-forward fairy tale",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2934,"['50th', 'animated', 'feature', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Animated', 'Classics', 'series', 'Tangled', 'little', 'less', 'flashy', 'little', 'less', 'hectic', 'average', 'animated', 'feature', 'days', 'hewing', 'closer', 'reality', 'most', 'such', 'films', 'one', 'can', 'stretch', 'term', 'include', 'tale', 'beautiful', 'tower-dwelling', 'princess', 'blonde', 'tresses', 'glow', 'when', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'form', 'roguish', 'thief', 'face', 'plastered', 'wanted', 'posters', 'countryside', 'Tangled', ""n't"", 'overplay', 'hand', 'storytelling', 'arena', 'are', 'fire-breathing', 'dragons', 'talking', 'animals', 'over-extended', 'action', 'sequences', 'least', 'more', 'necessary', 'focus', 'mainly', 'two', 'attractive', 'likable', 'characters', 'coming', 'know', 'accept', 'one', 'course', 'adventures.The', 'adventure', 'when', 'Rapunzel', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'who', 'just', 'turned', 'eighteen', 'leave', 'castle', 'been', 'locked', 'away', 'old', 'crone', 'posing', 'mother', 'out', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'confers', 'eternal', 'youth', 'anyone', 'who', 'order', 'experience', 'what', 'life', 'outside', 'world', 'Rapunzel', 'finally', 'wish', 'when', 'thief', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'who', 'fleeing', 'law', 'two', 'cohorts', 'just', 'betrayed', 'attempts', 'hide', 'tower', 'empty', 'However', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'nave', 'feisty', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'opportunity', 'escape', 'been', 'pining', 'years', 'So', 'go', 'see', 'world', 'many', 'unexpected', 'adventure', 'awaiting', 'way', 'Tangled', 'little', 'more', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'typical', 'kids', 'flick', 'indeed', 'full', 'half-hour', 'even', 'get', 'tower', 'room', 'scenes', 'run', 'little', 'longer', 'usual', 'Rapunzel', 'Flynn', 'take', 'time', 'establish', 'relationship', 'mutual', 'respect', 'trust', 'humor', 'gentle', 'tone', 'sweet', 'yet', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'starch', 'characters', 'crone', 'nicely', 'voiced', 'Donna', 'Murphy', 'Flynn', 'aggrieved', 'criminal', 'cohorts', 'keep', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'sappy', 'soft-focus', 'backgrounds', 'provide', 'appropriately', 'comfy', 'setting', 'tale', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Alan', 'Menken', 'Glenn', 'Slater', 'have', 'appealing', 'Broadway', 'show-tune', 'brassiness', 'audience', 'spirits.As', 'written', 'Dan', 'Fogelman', 'directed', 'Nathan', 'Greno', 'Byron', 'Howard', 'Tangled', ""n't"", 'come', 'sailing', 'wings', 'so', 'many', 'similar', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'trying', 'impress', 'postmodern', 'revisionism', 'cynical', 'self-awareness', 'elements', 'classic', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'genre', 'be', 'sure', 'also', 'respects', 'elements', 'really', ""n't"", 'business', 'tearing', 'things', 'down', 'just', 'can', 'congratulate', 'own', 'iconoclasm', 'irreverence', 'one', 'am', 'tremendously', 'grateful']",N/A

1406352,A1BPCX5TX2HNRQ,B004G6009K,Russ Nickel,"[58, 65]","Without female companionship, it's hard to go see Tangled and still maintain an air of manliness and virility. So, abandoning all hope of preserving that faade, I decided to go all the way to the deep end of the lame pool and see it with my parents. And for once, the dearth of self-confidence that inspired me to long ago stop vying for success with the fairer sex paid off, because when the dust settled and the credits rolled, there was only one fact left standing, and it towered above all other thoughts and insecurities: Tangled was AWESOME!What a cast of characters! Zachary Levi, or Chuck from Chuck (for those of you who watch my favorite television show), is perfectly charming as Flynn Rider, the shallow and selfish thief whose good looks are rivaled only by Narcissus. Immediately likeable despite his negative qualities, Flynn Rider's journey toward empathy is one which is quickly obvious, and yet it is so flawlessly executed that I found his transformation transfixing at every turn.As for Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), well, I was pretty much in love with her the moment I saw her. The epitome of innocence, Rapunzel is a drop of sunshine in the darkness. Her unadulterated joy is contagious, infecting even the most jaded and cynical. It was a pleasure to see how people changed when touched by such a fair creature, whether it be a group of thugs singing about their dreams or innumerable citizens breaking out into dance in the streets. Again, Rapunzel's character arc was rather obvious: from an obedient girl afraid of the world to a real person living her life. And again, it didn't matter, because that arc was artfully crafted.Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) is an understandable villain. I mean, Rapunzel's magic hair gives her eternal youth. If that's not a good reason for keeping your daughter in a tower, I don't know what is. The two characters of a different genus deserve quite a bit of recognition themselves. Pascal the chameleon makes for an excellent sidekick to Rapunzel. He's just about the cutest thing ever (right behind How to Train Your Dragon's Toothless), and his indignant looks are a great counterpoint to Rapunzel's innocent absurdity. Even Maximus, the head guard's horse, is an amazing character with a story of his own. He tracks Flynn Rider with brutal determination, but as per usual, ends up joining the team.Honestly, this movie has the perfect setup. You see, Flynn Rider is a character you can really get behind. Sure, he doesn't care about other people, but his charm makes him unarguably, well, charming. Oh, and Rapunzel is a character you can really get behind. The opposite of Flynn, she is trusting and cares deeply for everyone, and yet she has much to learn about the world. We love both characters from the beginning, and the traits that make each of them so great directly reflect the other's flaws, so when fate brings them together, we get to watch an incredible relationship blossom.Plus, there were a couple of little lines that broke the fourth wall in an amusing way. At one point, Flynn Rider calls Pascal a frog. Rapunzel, offended, points out that it's a chameleon, to which Flynn responds ""Nuance."" Bringing up the clich&eacute; of a princess and a frog is especially amusing, since Disney's last animated film was titled The Princess and the Frog. Also, like I said, Mother Gothel isn't particularly villainous during the film, just a bit attached to the idea of immortality. Now, when she argues with Rapunzel, she always complains that Rapunzel is ""making her the bad guy."" Well, I really wanted her to be the bad guy so I could cheer when she got her comeuppance, and then finally, much to my delight, she snaps, saying ""You want me to be the bad guy? Fine. Now I'm the bad guy."" To her, she was harkening back to those old arguments, but to me, she was talking directly to the audience, letting us know that it was ok to root against her.If I had one complaint, and I do, it would be that the songs didn't quite live up to my expectations. They were still excellent, but they were a bit more ponderous than some Disney tunes. With the exception of ""I've Got a Dream,"" they were slow, character-heavy numbers that, while still of a high quality, lacked the pizzazz that got the Aladdin soundtrack stuck so firmly in my head.But the songs certainly didn't detract from the experience. The dialogue was sharp, the animation was beyond beautiful, and the movie was both touching and hilarious. And as an added bonus, there was a lot of great insight into human nature. I cared for those characters, and the film was able to jerk my emotions around however it wanted. My sides hurt from laughing, my eyes ached from tears. Flynn's charm and Rapunzel's joy didn't just affect the other characters; they reached right out of that screen and touched me too, and because of that, I give Tangled:5/5 StarsThe only truly sad thing about this movie was that Rapunzel ended up becoming a brunette.

I thought the ads looked very appealing and couldn't wait to see it and wasn't disappointed at all.  Both my mom and I went to see it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm going to see it again this weekend and can't wait; it's like I'm a little kid again.  The movie is witty and hilarious, the story charming and heartwarming, and the lantern scene really is beautiful to watch and listen to.  Maximus by the way is honestly my most favorite Disney animated character EVER.  He completely steals the show!  Pascal and the Snuggly Ducklings thugs do too, to a degree, but no one is better than Maximus.I must say that I'm very impressed that Disney managed to both modernize the Rapunzel fairy tale while keeping it very true to the spirit of the classic tale.  All the classic Disney fairy tale elements are there but unlike some past Disney princesses, Rapunzel is feisty and determined and not at all the usual passive damsel-in-distress waiting to be rescued by a handsome prince who she marries five seconds later.  Thank you Disney for finally bringing a princess to screen who has her own mind and courage and determination and isn't afraid to use them!  And also major props to Disney for the character of Mother Gothel, probably one of the most interesting but also complex Disney animated movie villainess we've ever had.  (Btw she may be mean and evil but I still want her outfit she wore in the movie).The only minor quibble I can add to this is (and I will get flamed for this)...as good as Zach Levi's singing voice is, I kind of wish they'd gotten an actual singer to do it.  Zach had a good and solid voice but I felt like Mandy's voice really outshone his in ""I See the Light"" and wished they'd gotten someone like Josh Groban to sing his part.  Sorry, Zach.  But both his and Mandy's acting were wonderful, as was Donna Murphy as the fantastically theatrical Mother Gothel.  The songs are great though and I enjoyed all of them.

Little does Rapunzel know at first that her ""guardian"" actually kidnapped her as a child and is only keeping her in the tower for herself.

Watching them now takes me back to a simpler time when all I had to worry about was what kind of jelly I wanted on my PB&J.; This took me back while bringing a fresh new face to the princess collection.Tangled is the story of Rapunzel, the stolen princess with awesome hair. This version is different than most I've heard or read. I'm more familiar with a witch holding Rapunzel captive and a prince coming to the rescue; instead our story here is of a stolen princess with magic hair, a greedy old woman wanting to stay young forever, and a dashing young rogue just after money. The changes to the traditional story kept the movie fresh and interesting to watch.Some characters feel like throwbacks to some older Disney movies- Max, the horse, reminds me of the horse in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer)reminds me a good bit of the soldier guy from Hunchback, too, but I think the hair has a lot to do with that. I really love that Disney put music in this- other than The Princess and the Frog, Disney seems to have strayed away from singing characters. Growing up, those musical elements were my favorite and probably influenced me to pursue a professional music career. Personally, I like that this movie reminds me of older movies. The animation is really nice- it doesn't feel totally computer generated.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. No sketchy stuff to worry about with little kids, humor for the adults without crossing a line, and a band of unwashed miscreants singing about their dreams.

The Disney BD did not disappoint on quality and value for the price, albeit several features are worth skipping.The picture quality is as expected - virtually flawless and very colorful. The 7.1 DTS is great, though most of the outer channel usage was with Maximus and the dam breaking, still worthwhile to have the extra two speakers going though. The supplements are a mixed bag and include:* Deleted scenes, 3 @ 12:36 minutes. Directors intro for each, all still in the sketch mode. Nothing worth watching unless you like the rough draft edits.* Original Storybook Openings, 2 versions @ 8 minutes. Both with intros, and both providing only a couple tidbits of additional details.* 50th Feature Countdown, 2 minutes. Way too fast as they show a brief clip from each film accompanied by a number but no titles. Even pausing each one for customers to guess was not enough - too quick and not enough info.* Extended Song Sequences, 2 @ 7:48 minutes. The ""Life Begin"" and ""Mother Knows Best"" songs, mixed in with sketch and CGI animation to show the extensions, glad they were cut down.* Untangled, making of, 12:27 minutes. Hosted by Mandy Moore and Zach Levi. Shows some decent background on the production process mixed in with trivia and lots of cheese by those two as they try to provide some painful laughs. Not sure what the target audience was as I liked some of the information (that might bore kids) but their comedy attempts were horrible.* Tangled Teasers, 9 totaling 10 minutes. Each is an animated minute of almost South Park-themed skits. One was an obvious take on a certain prescription medication that helps men. Wish I could say why these were even included...kids will miss some of the humor.* The Disney 3D intro with the Lion King critters - old.* The Disney intro to Digital Copy.* Info: The pointless paragraph about commentaries.* Disc 2 is theTangledDVD.French and Spanish soundtracks with English 2.0 Descriptive Service and subs in same. I enjoyed the movie and BD quality, but the extras are almost bizarre in both production and/or why they were included. Still have to give it a 5-star review for overall worth with the DVD and Solid BD specs. Region coded A/B/C.EDIT: Forgot to mention that the opening of the BD has a VERY small menu along the bottom that you have only a few seconds to select that allows you to bypass the hideous amounts of Disney material/trailers/promos. It goes by fast but it is sooooo worth it - I was giving this a 5-star before even seeing the rest just for that.

1406393,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B004G6009K,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Tangled (animation, comedy, family, musical)Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron HowardStarring the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi and Donna MurphyDisney / Buena Vista | 2010 | 100 min | Rated PG | Released Mar 29, 2011Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.78:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1French: DTS-HD HR 7.1Spanish: DTS-HD HR 5.1English: Dolby Digital 2.0Subtitles:English SDH, French, SpanishDiscs:50GB Blu-ray DiscDVD copyThe Film 4.5/5Disney has been responsible for some wonderful films since releasing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. I remember being taken to the cinema as a child to see Bambi and The Jungle Book, and anxiously awaiting holiday specials showing classic Disney clips. What's more, all of Disney's releases are suitable for family viewing.While I appreciate all of the above, many of Disney's classic titles are formulaic. It seems like there's a princess in every story, although there are only nine official Disney princesses. The movies feature numerous songs and often start with the image of a storybook which is used to set the scene. All of those things work, but it's a little too predictable for my liking.Tangled is different.Instead of using a storybook for the exposition, it uses a narrator. The narrator is Flynn Rider, our hero, and he's sarcastic and genuinely funny. There are songs, but they are short, infrequent, and also funny. There's a princess, but she doesn't act like one. This is a story that doesn't take itself too seriously. It feels fresh and contemporary. Quite frankly, I was surprised and delighted with the whole thing.We learn during the opening scenes that an old woman, Mother Gothel (Murphy), possesses a golden flower with the power to heal and reverse the effects of aging. The queen is sick and needs the flower to heal her, so a party of soldiers is sent to find it. It works and newly-born princess Rapunzel (Moore) is infused with the plant's powers. Mother Gothel wants to appear young so she kidnaps the princess and keeps her in a tower. The king and queen release floating lanterns each year on Rapunzel's birthday and hope that she will eventually be found.Rapunzel thinks that Mother Gothel is her real mother and that she's being kept in the tower to protect her from the dangers of the real world. Her main wish is to see the lights that appear on her birthday. Her only friend is Pascal, a chameleon. He doesn't speak, but does a good job of expressing his feelings through body language.Flynn Rider is a notorious thief who stumbles across Rapunzel's tower while evading capture from the king's soldiers. Rapunzel hits him over the head with a frying pan and locks him in her closet. She's convinced that the outside world poses no threat to her.We learn that her hair has many uses. It's one way into the tower, but she also uses it to pick things up and to tie Flynn to a chair. The two enter into a bargain; he'll take her to see the floating lanterns and she'll give him back the tiara he stole. She sends Mother Gothel on an errand and leaves the tower with Flynn.Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling inn which is supposed to represent a sort of biker pub. The patrons aren't what they seem and end up liking her. Mother Gothel tracks the pair down and Flynn is also found by one of the king's horses, Maximus. The horse doesn't speak either, but is one of the funniest characters in the movie. He feels that he isn't appreciated, but Rapunzel wins his loyalty.There's plenty of action during the ensuing chase scenes, and the pair are forced to use their wits to escape all kinds of peril. Mother Gothel is the most evil character in the story, although her selfish actions are understandable when you consider that she'll die without the effects of Rapunzel's magic hair.There's considerable character development in the story and, being Disney, it has a happy ending. The mix of humor, action and romance works well. The characters are easy to like and there's always something interesting happening.Video Quality 5/5I recently reviewed Megamind and mentioned that, as well as aliasing, the backgrounds appeared unfinished. Watching Tangled, the difference is easy to spot. There is so much detail and depth in each frame. Take a look at the background shots and you'll see what I mean. Leaves rustle in the breeze, clouds drift and water ripples. This image is comparable to Bolt or the recent Pixar releases. It's another perfect transfer from Disney.Audio Quality 5/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix also receives a perfect score. There's a lot happening at times, and every little sound is heard. Background noises such as hooves or running water enhance the experience and you'll hear things coming at you from all directions. Dialogue and music also receive the correct treatment. It's hard to fault anything in the presentation.Special Features 3/5Deleted Scenes (13 minutes) - Directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard introduce this segment and explain how and why certain scenes were changed.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 3]","Disney's 50th Animated feature is entertaining and plays well even on a standard dep TV.Tangled is the 50th full-length animated FEATURE film from Disney and they are using that number to promote the film and its new DVD release. It's ""interesting"" that the DELUXE FOUR-DVD set (DVD+ Digital+Blu-ray+ Blu-ray 3D) is priced at $49.99 and not an even $50.Anyway, there are MANY reviews already posted based on the theatrical version of the film so I won't re-hash the plot here. You probably will be more interested in the home version of the film.As noted above, there is the 4-disc Deluxe version, but Disney has also released a 2-discv version without the 3-D disc, and a single-disc DVD version. Unless you are one of the few with a 3D TV the Deluxe version probably won't be of much use.To date I still haven't gone Blu-ray so I was unable to watch the bonus features exclusive to BR, which include A ""Making of"", Deleted scenes and two extended songs. The other two minor bonuses are on the standard DVD version. These are two interesting ""original storybook openings"" - running just over 3 minutes each - and a two-minute ""countdown"" compilation of the 50 animated features - to a soundtrack of Stevie Nicks' ""Dreams"" - with no identification of each film.I've watched the film on my standard large screen TV and its really sharp. The computer animation gets better and better. And the sound on the standard DVD was perfect too!As for the film itself, I liked it though I don't think its Disney's best. The songs by Alan Menken sound more like they were written for a Broadway show then for the films he previously composed for.So, yes I enjoyed it. And would recommend. I just wish that Disney would provide those people with standard DVD players some of the bounues that is only on the BR disc.

Probably nothing, but I felt I should say something anyways (and perhaps to prove Disney wrong about young girls not liking fairy tales anymore). I won't repeat the movie synopsis; others have done it already, and better than I could. It's almost impossible to think of enough adjectives to describe this fantastic movie. Let's start with the animation: it is, without a doubt, the most realistic animated movie I have EVER seen. Some shots (especially of people from the back) looked so real I thought the movie had switched to live-action. I didn't see it in 3D, but I didn't have to to be impressed with the very well-executed animation (no wonder this is the second most-expensive movie ever made).Next, we have Rapunzel herself. I think something I really liked about this movie is how she was portrayed. She's not the typical female you usually see in movies nowadays. She's not the Angelina Jolie action-packed I-can-do-anything-and-don't-you-say-different; she's unsure, somewhat shy, and innocent as a lamb. Yet these qualities are not brought across as something to look down upon, which many movie companies would have you believe. She doesn't flirt once with Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer), which is unbelievably refreshing.Then there's Flynn Rider. I just love how he was transformed over the course of the movie. In the beginning, he's a selfish, snarky thief who cares only about himself. As the show goes on, Rapunzel slowly (and quite unintentionally) changes him. By the end of the film, he's learned to care about someone else, to the point where he's willing to put his own life on the line to protect her. The change is gradual enough that it's made fairly believable, so don't be sitting there thinking, ""Oh brother, how unlikely is that?""And of course, we can't forget Maximus and Pascal. As someone else said, the horse really steals the show. Every time he was on the screen, I ended up laughing. His quick, jerking movements and facial expressions evoked laughter from our audience every time. Pascal is funny as well, with lots of sly looks and a bit of attitude.I agree with others who have said the music isn't as knock-out as some of the songs from the Disney Renassaince. But they're not terrible, either. I actually found myself humming ""I've Got a Dream"" the other day. And ""I See the Light,"" when coupled with the beautiful floating lantern scene, could almost bring tears to one's eyes.""Tangled"" is the perfect blend of plot, laughter, and just down-to-earth good-old-fashioned Disney magic. They really out did themselves on this one; I know it's going to be a favorite of mine for years to come.",5,"Worthy of the ""50th Animated Film"" Honor",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2714,"['What', 'can', 'say', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'well-written', 'reviews', 'Probably', 'nothing', 'felt', 'should', 'say', 'something', 'anyways', 'perhaps', 'prove', 'Disney', 'wrong', 'young', 'girls', 'not', 'liking', 'fairy', 'tales', 'anymore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'movie', 'synopsis', 'others', 'have', 'done', 'already', 'better', 'could', 'almost', 'impossible', 'think', 'enough', 'adjectives', 'describe', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'Let', 'start', 'animation', 'doubt', 'most', 'realistic', 'animated', 'movie', 'have', 'EVER', 'seen', 'shots', 'especially', 'people', 'back', 'looked', 'so', 'real', 'thought', 'movie', 'had', 'switched', 'live-action', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3D', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'impressed', 'very', 'well-executed', 'animation', 'wonder', 'second', 'most-expensive', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', '.Next', 'have', 'Rapunzel', 'think', 'something', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'portrayed', 'not', 'typical', 'female', 'usually', 'see', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'not', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'action-packed', ""I-can-do-anything-and-don't-you-say-different"", 'unsure', 'somewhat', 'shy', 'innocent', 'lamb', 'qualities', 'are', 'not', 'brought', 'across', 'something', 'look', 'down', 'upon', 'many', 'movie', 'companies', 'would', 'have', 'believe', ""n't"", 'flirt', 'once', 'Flynn', 'Eugene', 'prefer', 'unbelievably', 'refreshing.Then', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'just', 'love', 'how', 'was', 'transformed', 'course', 'movie', 'beginning', 'selfish', 'snarky', 'thief', 'who', 'only', 'show', 'Rapunzel', 'slowly', 'quite', 'unintentionally', 'end', 'film', 'learned', 'care', 'someone', 'else', 'point', 'where', 'willing', 'put', 'own', 'life', 'line', 'protect', 'change', 'gradual', 'enough', 'made', 'fairly', 'believable', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sitting', 'there', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'brother', 'how', 'unlikely', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Maximus', 'Pascal', 'someone', 'else', 'said', 'horse', 'really', 'show', 'time', 'was', 'screen', 'ended', 'up', 'laughing', 'quick', 'jerking', 'movements', 'facial', 'expressions', 'evoked', 'laughter', 'audience', 'time', 'Pascal', 'funny', 'as', 'well', 'lots', 'sly', 'looks', 'bit', 'attitude.I', 'agree', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'music', ""n't"", 'as', 'knock-out', 'songs', 'Disney', 'Renassaince', ""'re"", 'not', 'terrible', 'either', 'actually', 'found', 'humming', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Dream', 'other', 'day', 'See', 'Light', 'when', 'coupled', 'beautiful', 'floating', 'lantern', 'scene', 'could', 'almost', 'bring', 'tears', 'one', 'eyes', 'Tangled', 'perfect', 'blend', 'plot', 'laughter', 'just', 'down-to-earth', 'good-old-fashioned', 'Disney', 'magic', 'really', 'out', 'did', 'one', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'favorite', 'mine', 'years', 'come']",N/A

1406414,A31ACI0E88ORDE,B004G6009K,The Great White Father,"[1, 1]","In this day and age that has rejected God and traditional fairy tales, it's a refreshing change of pace to see a traditional fairy tale (or at least most of one) in a film that was made so recently, and that even went so far as to change the title simply to avoid alienating the male audience.Except for the fact that Flynn Rider is not a heroic prince but a thief, and the fact that he initially neither loves Rapunzel nor is trying to free her from her tower (and perhaps a deus ex machina at the end), the basic story template here is a traditional fairy tale, it is not an &#34;anti-fairy tale&#34; that is arrogantly trying to cram propaganda down our throats at the expense of the story.  My only lament is that it didn't go further--there are still too many modern elements, and too much of the film is forgettable.However, the reason I don't dare knock off more than one star is not only because the plot template is so right, but because of the one element that they got SO, so right....  Mother Gothel.Mother Gothel is easily one of the most memorable and frightening Disney villains in recent memory--indeed, the only song from this film that I remember anything from is &#34;Mother Knows Best&#34;.  Indeed, she almost seems to step out of the screen and threaten us in the audience!  At least, that was the experience that I had, seeing this film for the first time.  When Rapunzel stepped out of that tower for the first time, I was as frightened about Mother Gothel finding out, and what she would do in that event, as if it had been ME that she'd kept trapped in that tower all that time!  In fact, Mother Gothel was so stamped into my brain that I found myself distrusting Rapunzel's REAL mother...for no reason other than that she was &#34;Mother&#34;!  I didn't feel that way about her father!  Mother Gothel was such a presence for evil here that, even if only for the duration of the film, she had made the very word &#34;mother&#34; a dirty word for me!What makes Mother Gothel so great is that the magic element here is mirroring a tragically real-life phenomenon: the &#34;maternal vampire&#34;.  Because the female sex is the more beautiful sex, women tend to take it harder when they start seeing even the merest first signs of aging (a single gray hair, a single pair of tiny wrinkles under the eyes, etc.).  The &#34;maternal vampire&#34; is the mother who, as she ages, is so determined not to accept this that she will go to any lengths to &#34;turn back the clock&#34;--not just in terms of her appearance and demeanor, but in terms of continuing to treat her grown children as though they were still children, and especially in terms of dominating them (using emotional manipulation if they dare to assert themselves, to prey upon their feelings of guilt at &#34;ungratefully&#34; &#34;breaking mother's heart&#34;), and discouraging anything in the way of romance.  After all, romance might lead to her becoming a...*shudder*...GRANDMOTHER!But it's worse when the child of a maternal vampire is female, as she is here, because then the daughter becomes precisely what her mother once was: a beautiful young woman, who attracts the attention of male suitors.  (In fact, I should mention one line here, although I have to paraphrase: at the beginning, Mother Gothel looks at herself and Rapunzel in the mirror and says something like &#34;Do you know what I see?  I see a beautiful, strong, confident young woman.  Oh look, you're there too!  [chuckling]  I'm just kidding!&#34;  This was the second time she said &#34;I'm just kidding&#34; after a comment like this, and it was here that I knew what kind of person Mother Gothel was.)  Consequently the maternal vampire sees her own grown daughter as a threat, as a rival.  Indeed, I found myself wondering where this was in &#34;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&#34;!  But it's definitely at play here, even though it is mirrored by magic elements in this film.  For the sake of her own youth and beauty being retained, Mother Gothel selfishly uses emotional manipulation to keep Rapunzel in the tower, so that she won't leave her, and tries to frighten her about men and lust, to prevent Rapunzel from desiring romance.And in keeping with this theme, Rapunzel has to deal with her inner conflict: on the one hand, she feels stifled by her &#34;mother&#34; and yearns for freedom--on the other, she loves her &#34;mother&#34; (thinking that Mother Gothel is in fact her real mother) and doesn't want to let her down, so that Rapunzel feels guilt feelings for desiring freedom from her.  In fact, they demonstrate this literally in the film, and my only real problem is that it was done for laughs, and that's a serious situation that many grown children, probably of both sexes, go through in real life.Again, even just for these elements alone Tangled deserves high praise, and I'm only sorry that the film wasn't better or more memorable, since there is excellence here, especially given when the film came out--but because of that lack I had to knock off at least one star, but again, I don't dare knock off more.  So watch the film and enjoy it, but beware of Mother Gothel--you can never be quite sure that the screen is keeping you safe from her....God bless you all.",4,A welcome surprise--my only lament is

1406420,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B004G6009K,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 4]","""Tangled"" continues the rich Disney tradition of adapting age-old fairy tales to the big screen. As with most of their animated films, they start with a well-worn fairy tale, in this case ""Rapunzel"" by the Brothers Grimm, make it a little more modern, add some songs, in this case, all pretty forgettable, and toss in some amusing sidekicks. The twist on this ""Princess"" (I hope Disney doesn't have the word trademarked) tale is the addition of a male hero who has as much, if not more, screen time as Rapunzel. And, of course, the film is presented in 3-D, which now seems to be required of all animated features.""Tangled"" follows a tried and true formula, the same formula that helps make ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" such classics. John Lasseter, the force behind Pixar, is now in charge of both Disney and Pixar. Thank goodness he recognizes that this formula is necessary and has resurrected it. Disney films will only benefit; they once again have a zippier, funnier pace, more wild and funnier sidekicks and better lead characters. Strangely, these are all of the same things Pixar films are known for.One of the first things Lasseter did when he took the reigns was to revitalize the animation wing of Disney. How could anyone with even an inkling of childhood magic left within them let such a magical institution lapse? They were no longer going to produce 2-D animation, but Lasseter changed course and the company made ""The Princess and the Frog"", introducing Disney's first African-American princess. ""Frog"" is a lively film set in New Orleans in the 20s featuring a lively, eclectic score. It is a very good film but it is also considered a financial flop. I hope they will continue to make more films in the traditional way. It often creates a much more artistically superior film. They just need to ramp up the creative juices and come up with the next ""Little Mermaid""-esque hit.Next up, ""Rapunzel""... er, ""Tangled"" which really shows a lot of Lasseter's influence. While the characters have that classic Disney look, they are created by CGI. But this CGI is actually really good. The animation gives everything a rich, full quality, almost as though you are watching a 3-D film without the glasses. The wild and wacky quotient has been upped, giving Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder an assortment of funny supporting characters. Most of these take the form of a group of traveling marauders the heroes encounter at an alehouse. Ron Perlman, Brad Garret, Richard Kiel (Jaws from the James Bond films), MC Gainey and others give these characters voice. There is also a little drunk man who frequently appears with wings and a harp. It sounds strange, but the bizarre quality of some of the characters helps the story move along at a fast, refreshing pace.The one thing Lasseter seems to have been unable to help is the handful of forgettable songs included throughout. But then again, the Pixar films aren't known for their songs either. I honestly can't remember a single lyric which is shameful given they were all composed by Alan Menken, one half of the duo who made ""Mermaid"", ""Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" so memorable. Mr. Lasseter, if you can't create enough memorable songs, leave them out all together. A bunch of forgettable songs stick out for all of the wrong reasons.Also, leaving the songs out might prevent you from using pop music stars that provide less than memorable voice work for the lead character. Yes, I'm talking about you Mandy Moore.Because of the perceived mixed reaction to ""The Princess and the Frog"", the focus of the story was shifted to feature more of the dashing hero, Flynn Ryder (Zach Levi, TV's ""Chuck""), a bandit marauding through the kingdom, trying to get his hands on anything valuable. Given the ""Princess"" phenomenon at the Disney marketing machine, they need to have a pretty young girl at the center of the story, but in an effort to also attract young boys, Flynn becomes the narrator of the story and our guide.After stealing a crown, Flynn runs from the royal guard and soon finds himself in the middle of the glen, deep in the forest, looking at a tall tower. He climbs to the chamber sitting at the top and feels he is safe. But he is quickly knocked out. When he comes to, he realizes Rapunzel, a teenager with seventy-foot long hair, has captured him. Rapunzel lives in the tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who is away, and the young lady has never left the tower. Flynn desperately searches for his satchel (and the crown) and learns Rapunzel has hidden it. Her ransom? She wants Flynn to take her to see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday. If he does this, he will get his satchel back. He reluctantly agrees and they are off. Shortly thereafter, Mother Gothel returns and panics. She has her own selfish reasons for keeping Rapunzel in the tower. Along the way, Flynn and Rapunzel run into an odd assortment of characters.""Tangled"" is beautiful to watch, funny, moving at times and a worthy addition to the Disney tradition. Too bad they couldn't come up with more memorable songs to add to the magic.I really, truly hope this is the beginning of a new renaissance at Disney. It would be so nice to start to see some films that can once again rival the magic of the more recent classics """"Mermaid"", ""Beast"", ""Lion King"". It would be even more spectacular to see some films that might be able to rival the original classics ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Lady and the Tramp"", ""Cinderella"". If anyone can pull this off, it is Lasseter.",4,A Worthy Addition to the Legacy,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,5553,"['Tangled', 'rich', 'Disney', 'tradition', 'adapting', 'age-old', 'fairy', 'tales',

My biggest problem with the movie is the villain, Mother Gothel. She's Frollo all over agin, although I don't think she's as bad as someone like Frollo. She is a little more humorous. Also, I don't like how the king and queen don't search for Rapunzel for all these years. I also wish there were more animal side characters. Pascal is cool, and Maximus is funny, but he's Flynn Rider's enemy until the end. The song ""Mother Knows Best"" is mediocre. I can't even remember the melody! I also think the climax is one of Disney's weakest. Okay, I've complained about ""Tangled"" enough. What DO I like about this movie. The Pub Thugs are the funniest in this film, as well as their song ""I've Got A Dream"". Flynn and Maximus's slapstick comedy relationship IS hilarious, the main characters are funny, likable, and have good looks. I also like how the lantern song sequence is a combination of ""Kiss the Girl"", Beauty and the Beast"", and ""A Whole New World"". It's just so beautiful. Overall, I think ""Tangled"" is okay.

1406423,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B004G6009K,titania86,"[0, 0]","Rapunzel has 70 feet of golden magical hair that has healing powers. Her guardian, Mother Gothel, stole her as a baby because she wanted to stay young and beautiful forever. The flower that did the same thing was taken from her and given to Rapunzel's mother as a remedy, passing the power on to her daughter. She tried to cut off Rapunzel's hair, but it loses its magical properties and becomes useless. Rapunzel is now a young adult and reasonably would like to see the floating lights that happen every year on her birthday. Mother Gothel refuses to let her go, even if it's for her birthday, and explodes in true evil stepmother fashion. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals a crown from the royal family, ditches his accomplices, and hides in Rapunzel's tower. She subdues him and plans to show her mother she can handle herself, but Mother Gothel explosion ensues before she can show anything. Instead, Rapunzel asks for paints that take 3 days to get so she can force Flynn to take her to see the floating lights. Her journey with Flynn Rider will take her places she has never been and change her life forever.The first time I saw Tangled, I was completely unimpressed. I thought the story was ok, but the songs just fell flat for me. I have no idea why I thought this, but upon a great many rewatchings, I grew to love everything about: the characters, the songs, and those small moments you only notice after watching it at least a dozen times. Something just clicked in me and I fell in love with the film. The characters are dynamic and wonderful. Rapunzel is incredibly naive because she's never been in the outside world, but she definitely isn't stupid. Her naivete and kindness actually helps them cross the land to the castle to see the lanterns of her dreams. Plus her hair gets them out of a lot of sticky situations. Flynn Rider is a cocky, egotistical, self serving jerk on the outside, but a sweetheart on the inside. I really liked that their relationship is built on friendship and getting to know each other as opposed to the typical fairy tale instalove. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, is just about the cutest thing ever and plays an instrumental role in the story. Maximus, the horse bent on capturing Flynn, is more like a dog than a horse, which was kind of weird, but still cute.The best part of the whole film is Mother Gothel and her relationship with Rapunzel. Their relationship is built on a heap of lies and Mother Gothel only wants Rapunzel for her hair. Mother Gothel only calls Rapunzel endearing names like Flower (for the original flower that kept her young) and constantly strokes her hair because it is valuable to her and the actual girl is not. She is pretty evil, but not in the black and white, easily discerned way like most Disney villains. She's more like an actual abusive mother. She laces veiled insults with compliments to Rapunzel and says she's just kidding after many of the hurtful things she says. She also never admits being wrong and never really apologizes for anything. This is to keep Rapunzel under control, but keep her marginally content so she won't run away. It's heartbreaking to watch because Rapunzel lived with this her whole life and internalized many of Mother Gothel's insults. The damage of this is most apparent in the scene when she first leaves the tower, alternating between celebrating loudly and crying over betraying her mother. Mother Gothel manipulates everyone around her and will do anything to get what she wants.The music really grew on me over time and I've fallen in love with all of the songs. When Will My Life Begin is a fun song describing the many many things Rapunzel does in a day while she feels like she's really doing nothing in the bigger picture. The song is upbeat and fun, but with longing behind the happiness, just like Rapunzel. My other favorite song is I See the Light. It depicts the moments when Flynn and Rapunzel's relationship moves to more than friendship and feature the most beautiful moment in the film when the lanterns are released above them. The harmonies are beautiful and their feelings are completely believable.Tangled is a complex film that appeals to children as well as adults. It's the best Disney movie since the 90's in my opinion. It's a little darker and more believable than the usual Disney fare because there are people in the world just like Mother Gothel. She manipulates everyone around her to get what she wants and psychologically and verbally abuses Rapunzel to keep her complacent. I think this is a wonderful retelling of Rapunzel and I would recommend to any fan of fairy tales. I would also recommend a viewing of the short Tangled Ever After because it's hilarious and adorable!",5,A wonderful retelling of Rapunzel,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,4725,"['Rapunzel', '70', 'feet', 'golden', 'magical', 'hair', 'healing', 'powers', 'guardian', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'stole', 'baby', 'wanted', 'stay', 'young', 'beautiful', 'forever', 'flower', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'was', 'taken', 'given', 'Rapunzel', 'mother', 'remedy', 'passing', 'power', 'daughter', 'tried', 'cut', 'off', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'magical', 'properties', 'useless', 'Rapunzel', 'now', 'young', 'adult', 'reasonably', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'floating', 'lights', 'happen', 'year', 'birthday', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'let', 'go', 'even', 'birthday', 'explodes', 'true', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'fashion', 'Meanwhile', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'crown', 'royal', 'family', 'accomplices', 'hides', 'Rapunzel', 'tower', 'subdues', 'plans', 'show', 'mother', 'can', 'handle', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'explosion', 'ensues', 'can', 'show', 'anything', 'Instead', 'Rapunzel', 'paints', 'take', '3', 'days', 'get', 'can', 'force', 'Flynn', 'take', 'see', 'floating', 'lights', 'journey', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'will', 'take', 'places', 'never', 'been', 'change', 'life', 'forever.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Tangled', 'was', 'completely', 'unimpressed', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'ok', 'songs', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'thought', 'great', 'many', 'rewatchings', 'grew', 'love', 'everything', 'characters', 'songs', 'small', 'moments', 'only', 'notice', 'watching', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'Something', 'just', 'clicked', 'fell', 'love', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'dynamic', 'wonderful', 'Rapunzel', 'incredibly', 'naive', 'never', 'been', 'outside', 'world', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'naivete', 'kindness', 'actually', 'cross', 'land', 'castle', 'see', 'lanterns', 'dreams', 'hair', 'lot', 'sticky', 'situations', 'Flynn', 'Rider', 'cocky', 'egotistical', 'self', 'serving', 'jerk', 'outside', 'sweetheart', 'inside', 'really', 'liked', 'relationship', 'built', 'friendship', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'opposed', 'typical', 'fairy', 'tale', 'instalove', 'Pascal', 'Rapunzel', 'pet', 'chameleon', 'just', 'cutest', 'thing', 'ever', 'instrumental', 'role', 'story', 'Maximus', 'horse', 'bent', 'capturing', 'Flynn', 'more', 'dog', 'horse', 'was', 'kind', 'weird', 'still', 'cute.The', 'best', 'part', 'whole', 'film', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'relationship', 'Rapunzel', 'relationship', 'built', 'heap', 'lies', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'only', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'only', 'Rapunzel', 'endearing', 'names', 'Flower', 'original', 'flower', 'kept', 'young', 'constantly', 'hair', 'valuable', 'actual', 'girl', 'not', 'pretty', 'evil', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'easily', 'discerned', 'way', 'most', 'Disney', 'villains', 'more', 'actual', 'abusive', 'mother', 'veiled', 'insults', 'compliments', 'Rapunzel', 'just', 'kidding', 'many', 'hurtful', 'things', 'also', 'never', 'being', 'wrong', 'never', 'really', 'anything', 'keep', 'Rapunzel', 'control', 'keep', 'marginally', 'content', 'wo', ""n't"", 'run', 'away', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'Rapunzel', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'internalized', 'many', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'insults', 'damage', 'most', 'apparent', 'scene', 'when', 'first', 'tower', 'alternating', 'celebrating', 'loudly', 'crying', 'over', 'betraying', 'mother', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'everyone', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'what', 'wants.The', 'music', 'really', 'grew', 'time', ""'ve"", 'fallen', 'love', 'songs', 'When', 'Will', 'My', 'Life', 'Begin', 'fun', 'song', 'describing', 'many', 'many', 'things', 'Rapunzel', 'day', 'really', 'doing', 'nothing', 'bigger', 'picture', 'song', 'upbeat', 'fun', 'longing', 'happiness', 'just', 'Rapunzel', 'other', 'favorite', 'song', 'See', 'Light', 'moments', 'when', 'Flynn', 'Rapunzel', 'relationship', 'more', 'friendship', 'feature', 'most', 'beautiful', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'lanterns', 'are', 'released', 'harmonies', 'are', 'beautiful', 'feelings', 'are', 'completely', 'believable.Tangled', 'complex', 'film', 'appeals', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'best', 'Disney', 'movie', '90', 'opinion', 'little', 'darker', 'more', 'believable', 'usual', 'Disney', 'fare', 'are', 'people', 'world', 'just', 'Mother', 'Gothel', 'everyone', 'get', 'what', 'psychologically', 'verbally', 'Rapunzel', 'keep', 'complacent', 'think', 'wonderful', 'retelling', 'Rapunzel', 'would', 'recommend', 'fan', 'fairy', 'tales', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'short', 'Tangled', 'Ever', 'hilarious', 'adorable']",N/A

1406427,AMF52GSX309V0,B004G6009K,Tony S.,"[1, 1]","It's been a while and I may be rusty, and I know I'm about 2 weeks late on this film, but let's get started. I am a male, and didn't really grow up knowing this fairy tale. I knew Tangled was originally titled &#34;Rapunzel&#34; though. Disney attributed the failure of The Princess & The Frog to one thing; little boys didn't want to see it. I enjoyed the that film, but could see where little boys had no desire to watch it. So Disney quickly changed it's title and marketing scheme; showcase the male character! And so the adventure began.What I liked about the movie:The AnimationPixar gets a lot of credit for their films, as well they should. Dreamworks has always been in second place with their films. Disney's in-house animation doesn't get the credit it deserves though. They now have three successful films in a row (Chicken Little & Bolt).This is probably the last time I'm going to list this on my &#34;likes&#34; list. The quality of the animation SHOULD be spectacular. The animators have no boundaries to make these films look amazing. Tangled does not let us down. From the different settings to all the various characters and of course, Rapunzel's insanely long hair. There are a few fight sequences that stand out in my mind that showcase the animation. There is one involving Rapunzel and the other involves the male lead character, Flynn Ryder, awesome!The Voice ActingThis is going to be a tough pill to swallow folks; but Mandy Moore did a great job as Rapunzel. There I said, don't make me say it again. So you know why that was tough... I can't STAND Mandy Moore's acting. This is sort of a nice fit for her though. She started as a singer and this movie showcases that &#34;talent&#34;.Zachary Levi from &#34;Chuck&#34; is a great lead. His character, Flynn Ryder, is funny, and this is due to Levi's delivery. The character has to be witty, charming and sarcastic, Levi conveyed all of those things. Ron Perlman, Jeffrey Tambor and Brad Garrett round out the supporting cast who are great.The Story/HeartThis is pretty cheesy to talk about, considering I'm almost 30 years old, but hey, it's true. Disney has always done well in this department. Their stories can be summarized into one sentence and this movie is no different; its about an innocent girl eager to learn more about the world. There is one scene in particular that has no dialogue that had my wife and I reaching for tissues. You'll know it when you see it, as most of the people in our theater were teared up (it was a packed house by the way).What I didn't like about the movie:The SettingsOne thing Pixar does so well is create a larger than life experience in their films. Whether its Nemo in the ocean or Woody and Buzz in a daycare, they create these amazing worlds for the characters. Tangled didn't offer up the same. Most of the movie takes place in the tower where Rapunzel is being held captive. When our characters do venture out into the world, it's not very far. There's the woods, a bar and the tiny village. It didn't have the scope of other Disney films like Aladdin for example. With Aladdin, you felt how big Agrabah was, the marketplace, the palace, etc.There really wasn't too much else I didn't like. I wish there was just a bit more humor to appeal to adults, but overall I was very entertained the entire time. The cast was great, the story was solid and the execution was there. The songs were very fitting on the story and that's always nice, unlike some B movies out there. I would recommend this movie to young and old, but keep in mind it's very G Rated. My wife and I watched in 2D and believe me, it was just fine that way. Save your money and avoid the 3D version, I just don't see it adding much to the experience.

1406429,A3QQG1WGTK1OO8,B004G6009K,"T. Schott ""tschottoon""","[1, 1]","""Tangled"" is spectacular, but it's not because it's a 3D cgi movie. The fact is, Disney has regained its magic and they did it with some hand-drawn veterans. Kudos to John Lasseter for once again pushing story rather than technology. It's why Brad Bird's ""Incredibles"" for Pixar was so fantastic and now Lasseter has pushed Disney back on track with their 50th animated feature. I wish it had happened one movie sooner to prove traditional animation isn't dead. ""Princess & the Frog"" almost made it, but they just threw songs everywhere most of which could have been deleted. Anyway, back to ""Tangled"". Some of the artists that made ""Tangled"" so spectacular are Glen Keane, Donna Murphy, Alan Menken and Lisa Keene.First, executive producer Glen Keane was the lead animator for Ariel, Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas to name a few. He apprenticed under Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston and obviously their brilliance is now found in him. Donna Murphy is one of the strongest voices on Broadway. She was lead in Sondheim's ""Passion"" and anyone who knows Sondheim's rigorous selection process knows amateurs need not apply. As soon as I heard Murphy's voice in ""Tangled"" I recognized it immediately and knew Disney had struck gold there.

This is a family picture everyone can enjoy, telling a good story about characters you relate to, with a healthy dose of action and comedy. But what is most impressive is the film's breathtakingly beautiful colors that saturate the animation's fairy tale world.Based on a tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, ""Tangled"" revolves around a 18-year-old girl Rapunzel living in a high tower among the woods. In fact, she was kidnapped as a baby from the king and the queen by Gothel, an elderly woman who knows the special power Princess Rapunzel possesses. Not knowing the world outside (and her true identity), Rapunzel dreams of traveling to see thousands of lights that float in the sky once a year.""Tangled"" mixes the orthodox ""boy-meets-girl"" theme with fairy tale elements (though any sexual allusions of the original tale are carefully removed). The film keeps a steady pace with musical sequences, action scenes and nice comic turns from fearsome-looking (but actually likable) thugs drinking at a tavern, plus one non-speaking animal, Pascal the chameleon. Also, Maximus, a white horse of the royal guard, is a real scene stealer, who deserves his own movie.But what makes ""Tangled"" really special is its rich colors and lush textures. The amazing sky lantern scene is one of the many highlights of the film. This alone would be enough to give the film four stars or even more.",5,"Romance, Action and Humor: What Else Do We Need?",1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1500,"['Disney', 'long', 'tradition', 'musical', 'animation', 'never', 'Once', 'again', 'company', 'latest', 'work', 'Tangled', 'family', 'picture', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'characters', 'relate', 'healthy', 'dose', 'action', 'comedy', 'what', 'most', 'impressive', 'film', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'saturate', 'animation', 'fairy', 'tale', 'world.Based', 'tale', 'collected', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'Tangled', 'around', '18-year-old', 'girl', 'Rapunzel', 'living', 'high', 'tower', 'woods', 'fact', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'baby', 'king', 'queen', 'Gothel', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'special', 'power', 'Princess', 'Rapunzel', 'possesses', 'Not', 'knowing', 'world', 'true', 'identity', 'Rapunzel', 'dreams', 'traveling', 'see', 'thousands', 'lights', 'float', 'sky', 'once', 'year', 'Tangled', 'orthodox', 'boy-meets-girl', 'theme', 'fairy', 'tale', 'elements', 'sexual', 'allusions', 'original', 'tale', 'are', 'carefully', 'removed', 'film', 'steady', 'pace', 'musical', 'sequences', 'action', 'scenes', 'nice', 'comic', 'turns', 'fearsome-looking', 'actually', 'likable', 'thugs', 'drinking', 'tavern', 'one', 'non-speaking', 'animal', 'Pascal', 'chameleon', 'Also', 'Maximus', 'white', 'horse', 'royal', 'guard', 'real', 'scene', 'stealer', 'who', 'own', 'movie.But', 'what', 'Tangled', 'really', 'special', 'rich', 'colors', 'lush', 'textures', 'amazing', 'sky', 'lantern', 'scene', 'one', 'many', 'highlights', 'film', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'even', 'more']",N/A

The characters are all endlessly interesting, especially the two animal side-kicks who absolutely steal the show (despite being mute.)  The music is good, perhaps not '90s good, but still very enjoyable.  Mother Gothel is among Disney's best villains and her deliciously wicked song ""Mother Knows Best"" deserves to be among the greatest hits of all Disney musical numbers.The animation is, of course, breathtaking to behold--especially on Blu Ray.  The attention to detail and setting is what sets Disney apart from other computer animations.  Like the Beast's library or Belle walking through town, there are an endless number of images that will remain frozen in your mind for weeks, months, and probably years at a time.  I collect a lot of Disney movies but I still consider myself somewhat of a snob, if it's not during the Walt era (or one of the better '90s releases) I have a hard time justifying it for my collection.

Simply put, ""Tangled"" succeeds once again in that vein.For a basic plot summary, ""Tangled"" tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it.  Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave.  One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud.  Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is ""stuffy"" about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible.  The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Tangled"" and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare.

This is miles beyond what animated 3D movies looked like 10 years ago. The colors are so rich and nice to look at, I cannot believe I once that Shrek looked this good. But sadly, this is probably one of the few extremely positive things I am going to say about this film. Tangled fails to live to expectations of it's older princess films such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid and it fails to live up to it's contemporaries such as Up! and The Incredibles. When the children I babysit suggested we watch this movie, I was excited. But as it went on I was disappointed with the lack of caring and intelligence that went into this film. Let me explain.Rapunzel was a good idea for a new princess movie! The last time I saw any adaption of it was, well, the skit on Rocky and Bullwinkle I watched when I was about 8 years old. And honestly? I was more entertained by that than this. Tangled starts out with the song ""When Will My Life Begin"" that really never picks up or stay in your head. Actually, no songs do that in this film which was a big let down. I love musical films and Disney's Enchanted had a lot of cute and catchy songs. The soundtrack to this will not be remembered. Anyways, the story is all about Rapunzel escaping this tower her evil mom put her in and some tiara. I did not really find any of compelling or all that interesting but I am sure it is still fun for younger children. Predictable and standard Disney delivered hot and fresh! Another big complaint I have with this movie, despite Rapunzel being a strong character and delivering good messages, Flynn, her love interest, is a total flake. I really did not enjoy his character and would have enjoyed a more interesting male sidekick. Oh well.Despite the remarkable and amazing animation, Tangled really offers nothing new or fresh to the Disney Princess genre which is really a shame considering I usually like those films and Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. The next time Disney attempts to make another movie of this kind, I would really like to see a better and more memorable soundtrack and supporting cast of characters. Not to mention, I would appreciate a Disney movie without a concrete plot and black and white 'bad vs good' theme. But that is probably asking too much.To conclude, I do feel guilty for putting a cute movie that has probably made many children happy down. This is better than Wreck Em' Ralph, the new Shrek movies, Cars 2, etc. I do not hate this movie but I do not find it to be classic or a perfect Disney movie as others have been proclaiming.",3,It looks beautiful but I was disappointed,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,2682,"['Tangled', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'Just', 'look', 'Rapunzel', 'hair', 'miles', 'what', 'animated', '3D', 'movies', 'looked', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'colors', 'are', 'so', 'rich', 'nice', 'look', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'once', 'Shrek', 'looked', 'good', 'sadly', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'extremely', 'positive', 'things', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'film', 'Tangled', 'fails', 'live', 'expectations', 'older', 'princess', 'films', 'such', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'live', 'up', 'contemporaries', 'such', 'Incredibles', 'When', 'children', 'babysit', 'suggested', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'excited', 'went', 'was', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'caring', 'intelligence', 'went', 'film', 'Let', 'explain.Rapunzel', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'new', 'princess', 'movie', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'adaption', 'was', 'well', 'skit', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'watched', 'when', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'honestly', 'was', 'more', 'entertained', 'Tangled', 'out', 'song', 'When', 'Will', 'My', 'Life', 'Begin', 'really', 'never', 'up', 'stay', 'head', 'Actually', 'songs', 'do', 'film', 'was', 'big', 'let', 'love', 'musical', 'films', 'Disney', 'Enchanted', 'had', 'lot', 'cute', 'catchy', 'songs', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'remembered', 'Anyways', 'story', 'Rapunzel', 'escaping', 'tower', 'evil', 'mom', 'put', 'tiara', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'find', 'compelling', 'interesting', 'am', 'sure', 'still', 'fun', 'younger', 'children', 'Predictable', 'standard', 'Disney', 'delivered', 'hot', 'fresh', 'big', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', 'Rapunzel', 'being', 'strong', 'character', 'delivering', 'good', 'messages', 'Flynn', 'love', 'interest', 'total', 'flake', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'interesting', 'male', 'sidekick', 'Oh', 'remarkable', 'amazing', 'animation', 'Tangled', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'fresh', 'Disney', 'Princess', 'genre', 'really', 'shame', 'considering', 'usually', 'like', 'films', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'one', 'favorite', 'animated', 'movies', 'time', 'next', 'time', 'Disney', 'attempts', 'make', 'movie', 'kind', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'see', 'better', 'more', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'Not', 'mention', 'would', 'appreciate', 'Disney', 'movie', 'concrete', 'plot', 'black', 'white', ""'bad"", 'vs', 'good', 'theme', 'probably', 'asking', 'too', 'much.To', 'conclude', 'do', 'feel', 'guilty', 'putting', 'cute', 'movie', 'probably', 'made', 'many', 'children', 'happy', 'down', 'better', 'Wreck', 'Em', 'Ralph', 'new', 'Shrek', 'movies', 'Cars', '2', 'etc', 'do', 'not', 'hate', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'be', 'classic', 'perfect', 'Disney', 'movie', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'proclaiming']",N/A
