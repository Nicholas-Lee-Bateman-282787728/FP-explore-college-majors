1412122,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004K9I06I,Amit Talpade,"[2, 3]","When you have a director like Farah Khan, naturally the expectations are sky high especially if you have given two blockbusters in a row, i.e. Main Hoon Na and Om Shanti Om both with Shahrukh Khan. Then there was the rumored fallout with SRK and Farah changed sides to make Tees Maar, a remake of Peter Sellers' 1966 Italian film AFTER THE FOX with Akshay Kumar.Tees Maar has the right ingredients to be entertaining but the execution, acting, direction all fall apart. TMK is about Akshay Kumar a brazen thief who has attempted several bold heists in the past. He is going to attempting the biggest heist of all time with the help of his cronies and a film crew...The action and the narration increasingly become incoherent. None of the goofs or one liners work and instead end up sounding cheesy. Akshay Kumar, who has never found a script that he did not like, hams like he never has before. If this was his debut movie he would not have a chance in films, I guess he is hell bent on destroying his success. Katrina Kaif briefly sizzles in `Sheila Ki Jiwani' and then fizzles. The biggest disappointment in the movie was in the form of Akshaye Khanna whom the director chose to project her obsession or disappointment with Shahrukh. He enacts the role of an actor who refused Slumdog millionaire (Remember SRK refused the role that Anil Kapoor did), the needless jokes about back surgery. I remember that someone once said that for an entertainer to succeed there should be something significant unfolding on the screen every 10 minutes, this was the also the recipe for success of her idol Manmohan Desai.  In this film she tries to attempt that with cameos by Salman, and Anil Kapoor but things really don't happen. I hope with this movie she does not go the way of her brother Sajid Khan turning out celluloid atrocities. I guess this is the first time in the history of cinema that siblings have released their movies in the same year, Housefull 2 and TMK and both are strong contenders for the worst movie of 2010. If only we had the Razzies in Bollywood.....Possibly the worse movie I have watched in 2011 and definitely the worst of 2010.

1412124,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B004K9I06I,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","I am not overly familiar with Bollywood films but I understand that, as many of them as they make, they are the same few plot lines over and over again. Here they remake an old Peter Sellers movie 'After the Fox.' Tees Maar Khan is a master criminal who is going to pull off a huge heist. To do so he poses as a film director who will shoot his next masterpiece in a small village and use the villagers in the film and unwittingly in the heist.This is a comedy but the Indian sense of comedy isn't the same as ours so it just doesn't generate many laughs. Their facial expressions and physical movements are all over-exaggerated. Pretty much like something you'd see from Jerry Lewis in the 60s. Those days are long and gratefully gone.The cast is OK. Katrina Kaif is stunningly beautiful as the female lead. Akshay Kumar is so-so as the male lead. He has a decent screen presence but I found nothing particularly appealing about him. The secondary characters didn't do much for me. Their performances, along with the writing, are out of step with the times.Surprisingly, at almost two and a half hours, there are only three dance numbers. The first, featuring Katrina, is great. The choreography is outstanding and she is a thrill to watch. The other two are good but pale by comparison. The other production values are OK. The color schemes are vibrant. A lot of primary colors blast their way off the screen. The set compositions are OK as is the directing.This is not a bad movie but there are better Hindi movies out there and at this length I really cannot recommend it.",3,Fun......Sort Of,1301875200,"04 4, 2011",2011,1576,"['am', 'not', 'overly', 'familiar', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'understand', 'that', 'many', 'make', 'are', 'same', 'few', 'plot', 'lines', 'over', 'again', 'Here', 'remake', 'old', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'movie', 'Fox', 'Tees', 'Maar', 'Khan', 'master', 'criminal', 'who', 'going', 'pull', 'off', 'huge', 'heist', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'director', 'who', 'will', 'shoot', 'next', 'masterpiece', 'small', 'village', 'use', 'villagers', 'film', 'unwittingly', 'heist.This', 'comedy', 'Indian', 'sense', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'same', 'ours', 'just', ""n't"", 'generate', 'many', 'laughs', 'facial', 'expressions', 'physical', 'movements', 'are', 'over-exaggerated', 'Pretty', 'much', 'something', ""'d"", 'see', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', '60s', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gratefully', 'gone.The', 'cast', 'OK.', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'female', 'lead', 'Akshay', 'Kumar', 'so-so', 'male', 'lead', 'decent', 'screen', 'presence', 'found', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'appealing', 'secondary', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'performances', 'writing', 'are', 'step', 'times.Surprisingly', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'dance', 'numbers', 'first', 'featuring', 'Katrina', 'great', 'choreography', 'outstanding', 'thrill', 'watch', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'good', 'pale', 'comparison', 'other', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'OK', 'color', 'schemes', 'are', 'vibrant', 'lot', 'primary', 'colors', 'blast', 'way', 'screen', 'set', 'compositions', 'are', 'OK', 'directing.This', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'are', 'better', 'Hindi', 'movies', 'there', 'length', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'recommend']",Tees Maar Khan

But, this character, played by Askshay Kumar (AK), seems within the realm of reality. AK's acting has been the pillar in this fast paced farcical comedy. He is the heart and soul of this movie.The story is that he wants to loot treasure which is being transported by special train under guard. AK impersonates as a film Director, enrols an entire village in his ""movie"" and pulls off the heist.The narration makes the appropriate leaps and reaches a climax without seeming to meander at any point. There is no dull moment. Even so, the Director finds the opportunity to squeeze in the famous item number ""Shiela ki jawani"". The jungle chase in the night also weaves into the story. This is masala movie created by pros.Katrina Kaif has danced with gusto to the ""Sheila"" number. Akshay Khanna has portrayed the right mix of a Bollywood star desperate to win an Oscar, which promise is part of AK's caper.The movie could have done vastly better at the box office with a few more hit numbers, including the one where Salman Khan makes a guest appearance.This is a well crafted Bollywood masala entertainment, and not to be missed.",4,A Laugh Riot!,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,1257,"['baddie', 'who', 'outrageous', 'show', 'off', 'camera', 'sidekicks', 'once', 'minute', 'invincible', 'character', 'played', 'Askshay', 'Kumar', 'AK', 'realm', 'reality', 'AK', 'acting', 'been', 'pillar', 'fast', 'paced', 'farcical', 'comedy', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie.The', 'story', 'loot', 'treasure', 'being', 'transported', 'special', 'train', 'guard', 'AK', 'film', 'Director', 'entire', 'village', 'movie', 'off', 'heist.The', 'narration', 'appropriate', 'leaps', 'climax', 'seeming', 'meander', 'point', 'dull', 'moment', 'Even', 'so', 'Director', 'opportunity', 'squeeze', 'famous', 'item', 'number', 'Shiela', 'ki', 'jawani', 'jungle', 'chase', 'night', 'also', 'story', 'masala', 'movie', 'created', 'pros.Katrina', 'Kaif', 'danced', 'gusto', 'Sheila', 'number', 'Akshay', 'Khanna', 'portrayed', 'right', 'mix', 'Bollywood', 'star', 'desperate', 'win', 'Oscar', 'promise', 'part', 'AK', 'caper.The', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'vastly', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'few', 'more', 'hit', 'numbers', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'guest', 'appearance.This', 'well', 'crafted', 'Bollywood', 'masala', 'entertainment', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Tees Maar Khan

It has some uproarious moments like the Bin khopdi ka bhoot track and Atish Kapoor (Akshaye Khanna) constant desperation to bag an Oscar Award. But the digs taken at Aamir Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Danny Denzongpa are certainly below the belt.Akshay Kumar plays his role well. But he has nothing new to offer as we have seen him playing several similar roles in the past. Katrina Kaif plays a wannabe actress to perfection and completely sizzles in Sheila ki Jawani. Akshaye Khanna is brilliant. It's actually good seeing him overact as his role demanded that. Raghu Ram and Rajiv Laxman don't have much to do. Salman Khan's guest appearance in Wallah re wallah is first-rate. Chunky Pandey is hilarious. Arya Babbar is decent. Ali Asgar is passable.
