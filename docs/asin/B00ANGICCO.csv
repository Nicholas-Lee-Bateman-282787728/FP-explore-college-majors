It's hard to fathom how the little town of Hastings could be perpetually in the front line of the war. It's a supreme irony since the series commences with Foyle complaining about how he'd rather be assigned to a job with more significance in fighting the war.

As I write this review it is currently $44.99, which is still a steal!The show begins in the early years of World War 2 and is based along the south coast of England in and around Hastings (apparently quite a sketchy place in these years! - kidding!).  Micheal Kitchen plays Detective Foyle, a very wry and intelligent police officer stationed on the home front.  During the years of the war and even in some of the post-war years, he is tasked with various duties such as solving murders, investigating other crimes, unraveling espionage and spy networks, and all the other home front fun.  The series could have been a letdown but the writing and acting are top notch.  Even the supporting cast is amazing.Each episode is film length (90 to 100 minutes), so the viewer has plenty of time to get into the plot and become acquainted with the characters.  Some of the characters appearing in individual episodes are known for other series and films, and it is quite fun to see some decently high profile British actors appearing in this series (such as David Tennant - shame on you if you don't know 'Who' he is).I wouldn't say this is in the same style as other top British series such as Downton Abbey, so it is hard to compare it to some of the other favorites.  As far as comparing this to other crime themed dramas, I feel this might be the best in years, if not the best ever.  Each time I thought I might lose interest, something happened that caught my attention - or Micheal Kitchen uttered another snarky response!  In any case, I highly recommend this series for those fans of intelligent crime dramas that have a little more story and aren't afraid to explore some of the story surrounding the crimes.I would rate 6 stars if I could!!!",5,Awesome series!,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1887,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'involved', 'plots', 'mainly', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'nabbed', 'when', 'Amazon', 'dropped', 'price', '39.99', 'write', 'review', 'currently', '44.99', 'still', 'steal', 'show', 'early', 'years', 'World', 'War', '2', 'based', 'south', 'coast', 'England', 'Hastings', 'apparently', 'quite', 'sketchy', 'place', 'years', 'kidding', 'Micheal', 'Kitchen', 'Detective', 'Foyle', 'very', 'wry', 'intelligent', 'police', 'officer', 'stationed', 'home', 'front', 'years', 'war', 'even', 'post-war', 'years', 'tasked', 'various', 'duties', 'such', 'solving', 'murders', 'investigating', 'other', 'crimes', 'unraveling', 'espionage', 'spy', 'networks', 'other', 'home', 'front', 'fun', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'letdown', 'writing', 'acting', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'Even', 'supporting', 'cast', 'amazing.Each', 'episode', 'film', 'length', '90', '100', 'minutes', 'viewer', 'plenty', 'time', 'get', 'plot', 'become', 'acquainted', 'characters', 'characters', 'appearing', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'known', 'other', 'series', 'films', 'quite', 'fun', 'see', 'decently', 'high', 'British', 'actors', 'appearing', 'series', 'such', 'David', 'Tennant', 'shame', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'Who"", '.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'style', 'other', 'top', 'British', 'series', 'such', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'hard', 'compare', 'other', 'favorites', 'As', 'far', 'comparing', 'other', 'crime', 'themed', 'dramas', 'feel', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'years', 'not', 'best', 'ever', 'time', 'thought', 'might', 'lose', 'interest', 'something', 'happened', 'caught', 'attention', 'Micheal', 'Kitchen', 'uttered', 'snarky', 'response', 'case', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series', 'fans', 'intelligent', 'crime', 'dramas', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'explore', 'story', 'surrounding', 'crimes.I', 'would', 'rate', '6', 'stars', 'could']","Foyle's War: The Homefront Files, Sets 1-6"

SETS 1-6 (22 EPISODES), ACORN AMP-8600.This DVD series is about a fictional DCS (Detective Chief Superintendent) dealing with crime and criminals in WWII England, and is supposedly based on a compilation of actual police cases, with a little artistic license tossed in to make the stories more interesting.  DCS Christopher Foyle has to do his job while also dealing with allied military personnel, as well as German spies, saboteurs, and the crews of shot down German aircraft.  He manages to juggle all these conflicting agendas, personalities and egos, while remaining calm and perceptively going about his job, like it was just another day in his small rural police department, the Hastings Borough Police.The only gripes I had were a couple of DVD glitches, and the often tedious behind-the-scenes extra segments that were yawn producing and had to be taken in small doses to prevent dozing off.  I finally gave up on the extra segments. Another gripe I had was with the flimsy cardboard box that the DVD containers were packaged in. The box is open on one side, and the DVD containers can easily fall out into a pile on the floor. What is needed, is a sturdier box with a Velcro closure, a snap closure, or some other type of locking closure on a wraparound lid or overlapping lids.Is it worth buying? Yes.

1614294,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B00ANGICCO,Kathy-W,"[1, 1]","Michael Kitchen is a rare treat. On-screen and off, he goes at his own pace and does whatever projects he pleases. Stage theatre being his first love, his film or TV appearances are relatively few (outside of some U.K.-only programs and a fair bit of more classical ""Masterpiece Theatre"" appearances). ""Foyle's War"" is finally a meaty and sustained program for hungry fans to feast on.Christopher Foyle is a perfect gentleman - never raising his voice and only rarely losing his composure - but now and then, there's a twinkle in his eye and a barely perceptible but mischievous smirk on his face. Kitchen makes a fascinating character study out of a potentially dry and overused character framework (the ""aging detective""), but viewers who aren't used to paying attention will miss out on some of the fun. This is not a ""listen only"" show; while the dialogues are usually excellent, the scripts also depend heavily on body language and good camerawork (which this show has in spades). Yes, Foyle is at the start of being an old dog, but his patience and stillness are what very often allow him to spot details that everyone else misses. It's also a delicious cover for the scores of people who are too foolish (or guilty) to realize his observation skills.In contrast to Foyle's succinct demeanor, we have Sam Stewart (courtesy of the delightful Honeysuckle Weeks). Sam is breezy and precocious (sometimes dangerously so), but not frivolous. Her dogged nagging and motormouth tendencies are sometimes a great asset to solving a case, yet many of her observations are simply incidental ""thought overflow"" rather than attempts to outshine her superiors. I personally was impressed that the writers/producers were able to walk the tightrope so well with regards to the role of women during the war: they neither minimize nor magnify Sam's presence but simply point out that women did have certain capacities in war efforts other than typing and the tea cart.Foyle's other sidekick, Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), is a different breed of sorts. His temper can cloud his judgment (caused partially by a P.T.S.D. ""prototype"" that is subtly explored in early episodes). He can be quite impatient and doesn't have the quiet wit of Foyle, yet his intelligence usually restrains him from doing anything truly foolish. His ambition is more extroverted than Foyle's, so he has a more ""hungry"" approach to catching criminals.One nice thing about this show is that the tranquility of rural life shows through so well without diminishing the urgencies of war and crime. The London air raids have been oft explored in film, but the effects of war on smaller towns and country dwellers are still a bit murky. This show is not a constant barrage of white-knuckle murders, thefts, and other unpleasantness (it's certainly the main point of the show, but a historical ""Prime Suspect"" this show is NOT). Foyle might not have much of a social life, but Milner and Sam certainly do, and the plots weave together work and play in a beautiful way. This brand of whodunit sometimes hinges on one or two tiny details or misunderstandings (some of the deaths are actually quite accidental and only appear grisly at the beginning), so the endings are not always as sad as you would expect them to be. This show's typical mood is a good exercise in melancholy because it is more observation than adrenaline rush. There are no serial killers or terrorists in the genuine definition of the terms. This show is slick without being ""plastic"" - 95% of the time, you believe the sets and the people populating them.I'm not necessarily a history buff, but when I prompted several friends (who adore WW2 history) about this series, they all agreed that a surprising amount of details were very accurate in the show (not a perfect 10, of course, but not bad at all compared to other shows). Visually, there are some lovely sights to take in. Scenery, set, and costume are equally pleasing to take in (and Kitchen sure looks sharp in a hat and tie). For any driving or flight fans, there are plenty of old planes and shiny cars to look at.The pacing of each episode will seem slow to some viewers, but if you find yourself getting sucked in, the minutes will pass by in an instant and you might just find yourself galloping through the whole series.",5,A superior cast and a decent historical series,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",2013,4309,"['Michael', 'Kitchen', 'rare', 'treat', 'On-screen', 'off', 'own', 'pace', 'projects', 'Stage', 'theatre', 'being', 'first', 'love', 'film', 'TV', 'appearances', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'U.K.-only', 'programs', 'fair', 'bit', 'more', 'classical', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'appearances', 'Foyle', 'War', 'finally', 'meaty', 'sustained', 'program', 'hungry', 'fans', 'feast', 'on.Christopher', 'Foyle', 'perfect', 'gentleman', 'never', 'raising', 'voice', 'only', 'rarely', 'losing', 'composure', 'now', 'then', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'barely', 'perceptible', 'mischievous', 'smirk', 'face', 'Kitchen', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'potentially', 'dry', 'overused', 'character', 'framework', 'aging', 'detective', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'paying', 'attention', 'will', 'miss', 'out', 'fun', 'not', 'listen', 'only', 'show', 'dialogues', 'are', 'usually', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'also', 'depend', 'heavily', 'body', 'language', 'good', 'camerawork', 'show', 'spades', 'Yes', 'Foyle', 'start', 'being', 'old', 'dog', 'patience', 'stillness', 'are', 'what', 'very', 'often', 'allow', 'spot', 'details', 'everyone', 'else', 'misses', 'also', 'delicious', 'cover', 'scores', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'foolish', 'guilty', 'realize', 'observation', 'skills.In', 'contrast', 'Foyle', 'succinct', 'demeanor', 'have', 'Sam', 'Stewart', 'courtesy', 'delightful', 'Honeysuckle', 'Weeks', 'Sam', 'breezy', 'precocious', 'sometimes', 'dangerously', 'so', 'not', 'frivolous', 'dogged', 'nagging', 'motormouth', 'tendencies', 'are', 'sometimes', 'great', 'asset', 'solving', 'case', 'yet', 'many', 'observations', 'are', 'simply', 'incidental', 'thought', 'overflow', 'rather', 'attempts', 'outshine', 'superiors', 'personally', 'was', 'impressed', 'writers/producers', 'were', 'able', 'walk', 'tightrope', 'so', 'well', 'regards', 'role', 'women', 'war', 'minimize', 'magnify', 'Sam', 'presence', 'simply', 'point', 'out', 'women', 'did', 'have', 'certain', 'capacities', 'war', 'efforts', 'other', 'typing', 'tea', 'cart.Foyle', 'other', 'sidekick', 'Paul', 'Milner', 'Anthony', 'Howell', 'different', 'breed', 'sorts', 'temper', 'can', 'cloud', 'judgment', 'caused', 'partially', 'P.T.S.D', 'prototype', 'subtly', 'explored', 'early', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'impatient', ""n't"", 'have', 'quiet', 'wit', 'Foyle', 'yet', 'intelligence', 'usually', 'doing', 'anything', 'truly', 'foolish', 'ambition', 'more', 'extroverted', 'Foyle', 'more', 'hungry', 'approach', 'catching', 'criminals.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'show', 'tranquility', 'rural', 'life', 'shows', 'so', 'well', 'diminishing', 'urgencies', 'war', 'crime', 'London', 'air', 'raids', 'have', 'been', 'oft', 'explored', 'film', 'effects', 'war', 'smaller', 'towns', 'country', 'dwellers', 'are', 'still', 'bit', 'murky', 'show', 'not', 'constant', 'barrage', 'white-knuckle', 'murders', 'thefts', 'other', 'unpleasantness', 'certainly', 'main', 'point', 'show', 'historical', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'show', 'NOT', 'Foyle', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'social', 'life', 'Milner', 'Sam', 'certainly', 'do', 'plots', 'weave', 'together', 'work', 'play', 'beautiful', 'way', 'brand', 'whodunit', 'sometimes', 'one', 'two', 'tiny', 'details', 'misunderstandings', 'deaths', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'accidental', 'only', 'appear', 'grisly', 'beginning', 'endings', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'as', 'sad', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'show', 'typical', 'mood', 'good', 'exercise', 'melancholy', 'more', 'observation', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'are', 'serial', 'killers', 'terrorists', 'genuine', 'definition', 'terms', 'show', 'slick', 'being', 'plastic', '95', '%', 'time', 'believe', 'sets', 'people', 'populating', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'necessarily', 'history', 'buff', 'when', 'prompted', 'several', 'friends', 'who', 'adore', 'WW2', 'history', 'series', 'agreed', 'surprising', 'amount', 'details', 'were', 'very', 'accurate', 'show', 'not', 'perfect', '10', 'course', 'not', 'bad', 'compared', 'other', 'shows', 'Visually', 'are', 'lovely', 'sights', 'take', 'Scenery', 'set', 'costume', 'are', 'equally', 'pleasing', 'take', 'Kitchen', 'sure', 'sharp', 'hat', 'tie', 'driving', 'flight', 'fans', 'are', 'plenty', 'old', 'planes', 'shiny', 'cars', 'look', 'at.The', 'pacing', 'episode', 'will', 'seem', 'slow', 'viewers', 'find', 'getting', 'sucked', 'minutes', 'will', 'pass', 'instant', 'might', 'just', 'find', 'galloping', 'whole', 'series']","Foyle's War: The Homefront Files, Sets 1-6"

1614321,A3TP7YO9V2AT63,B00ANGICCO,"Rwc ""Noblesse Oblige""","[9, 15]","The series excels at interweaving the traditional English murder mystery into the WWII backdrop.  It is a brilliant premise. Very often the murders evoke the ambiguities of war, not just the conflicts.  Michael Kitchen is simply a wonderful actor.  His expressive face and subtle body language convey much more than his lines.  And the camera catches this beautifully.  Honeysuckle Weeks and Anthony Howell are also fine in support.  Generally the writing is first rate with elaborate set-ups and linkings between the various plot characters.My two beefs are first that the DVDs need concurrent subtitles along with the audio (they are available only in set 6).  As it is the subtitles are accessible only with audio off.A more serious distraction is the level of stretch needed to introduce current political correctness into many of the story lines.  The businessmen are always greedy capitalists out for mere profits at the expense of the war effort.  We are repeatedly reminded of how the working women were terribly exploited with poor pay relative to men.  Black American soldiers are discriminated against (true) but nevertheless exude the essence of nobility (in reality no more or less than anyone else). Aristocrats can be expected to be hiding some terrible past secret, usually having killed off their past wives.  Almost all German soldiers and spies are depicted as innocent victims of circumstance; one doomed spy even gives critical and voluntary testimony to aid a criminal investigation in the country he is pledged to defeat. Really?  Sometimes the viewer can get the feeling that the talented writers are out to demythologize and stereotype the Brits of that era.  The series would have been more challenging to watch and better overall if it had mixed in an element of unpredictability into these otherwise tiresome patterns.The writing for Set 6 does not quite live up to the level of the first 5.  More stereotypical characters and predictable plots prevail.
