Well, it's not, at least, not really.Synopsis:One of Bobby Garfield's (adult Bobby played by David Morse) childhood friends dies and Bobby goes to the funeral.  As a result he finds out that his childhood sweetheart has also passed away.  In reminiscing he returns to his childhood home and remembers...On Bobby Garfield's (young Bobby played by Anton Yelchin) 11th birthday, Ted Brautigan (played by Anthony Hopkins) moves in.  Bobby and his mother Liz (played by Hope Davis) are without a father/husband in the home as he passed away when Bobby was 5.  Ted is on the run from the FBI or aliens or someone because of his psychic abilities and is hiding out with the Garfield's.Well, Bobby and Ted hit it off and Ted becomes something like a father/grandfather figure for Bobby.  Bobby, with Ted's help, ends up having a successful summer of sorts by beating up the local bully (who isn't incorporated very well into the movie) and kissing Carol Gerber (played by Mika Boorem).  At the end of the summer, Liz turns Ted in and he is captured by whoever is following him.  Then Liz and Bobby move away....Return to Present, Bobby runs into Carol's daughter Molly and gives her a picture of her mother.  Movie ends.My Comments:The story doesn't make much sense in a logical fashion and a lot of things are kind of left unresolved.  We never really find out what was going on with Ted Brautigan nor do we find out what happened to him.  Bobby didn't keep in touch with Carol and is stunned to find out she has died.  Liz Garfield is raped by her boss and nothing is really said of it.  I guess this is supposed to represent real life in a sense, but I'm not quite sure it works to tell a coherent story.Overall, though I was entertained, I was also baffled.  When the movie ended I asked my wife, ""What was that?""  We didn't really have much of an answer for it.  Though there were some very endearing moments in the movie, it also left you kind of wondering what we were supposed to get from it.  For the good acting, especially by the young Bobby and Carol, I'm giving it 3/5, but the story just doesn't make all that much sense.",3,I'm just not sure what this was supposed to be about,1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,2229,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'book', 'Giver', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', 'Well', 'not', 'least', 'not', 'really.Synopsis', 'One', 'Bobby', 'Garfield', 'adult', 'Bobby', 'played', 'David', 'Morse', 'childhood', 'friends', 'dies', 'Bobby', 'funeral', 'result', 'out', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'also', 'passed', 'away', 'reminiscing', 'childhood', 'home', 'remembers', 'Bobby', 'Garfield', 'young', 'Bobby', 'played', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', '11th', 'birthday', 'Ted', 'Brautigan', 'played', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Bobby', 'mother', 'Liz', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'are', 'father/husband', 'home', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'Bobby', 'was', '5', 'Ted', 'run', 'FBI', 'aliens', 'someone', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'hiding', 'out', ""Garfield's.Well"", 'Bobby', 'Ted', 'hit', 'off', 'Ted', 'something', 'father/grandfather', 'figure', 'Bobby', 'Bobby', 'Ted', 'help', 'up', 'having', 'successful', 'summer', 'sorts', 'beating', 'up', 'local', 'bully', 'who', ""n't"", 'incorporated', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'kissing', 'Carol', 'Gerber', 'played', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'end', 'summer', 'Liz', 'Ted', 'captured', 'whoever', 'following', 'Then', 'Liz', 'Bobby', 'move', 'away', '.Return', 'Present', 'Bobby', 'Carol', 'daughter', 'Molly', 'picture', 'mother', 'Movie', 'ends.My', 'Comments', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'logical', 'fashion', 'lot', 'things', 'are', 'kind', 'left', 'unresolved', 'never', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Ted', 'Brautigan', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Bobby', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'touch', 'Carol', 'stunned', 'find', 'out', 'died', 'Liz', 'Garfield', 'raped', 'boss', 'nothing', 'really', 'said', 'guess', 'supposed', 'represent', 'real', 'life', 'sense', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'tell', 'coherent', 'story.Overall', 'was', 'entertained', 'was', 'also', 'baffled', 'When', 'movie', 'ended', 'asked', 'wife', 'What', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'answer', 'were', 'very', 'endearing', 'moments', 'movie', 'also', 'left', 'kind', 'wondering', 'what', 'were', 'supposed', 'get', 'good', 'acting', 'especially', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Carol', ""'m"", 'giving', '3/5', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

685462,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B00005UQ9V,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[0, 0]","HEARTS IN ATLANTIS the book was an 800-page work that represents author Stephen King's take on the tumultuous 1960s. The book consists of a number of separate pieces of writing which (just barely) share characters. This movie covers the biggest part of the book, and just for convenience I'll call it ""the novel.""It is 1960 in a lower-middle class suburb of Bridgeport, CT. Eleven-year-old fatherless Bobby wants his own bicycle but his mother Liz tells him he has to earn the money himself if he wants it. (Liz's common refrain: ""Your father didn't exactly leave us well off, you know.) Liz's work in a realty firm provides them just the essentials. After getting to know Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), the new neighbor upstairs, Bobby starts earning a dollar a day reading to him from the newspaper. Ted is somewhat of an enigma but enjoys literature and helps Bobby reach into the realm of adult fiction. Although mother Liz initially trusts Brautigan ""about as far as I could sling a piano,"" eventually she becomes more tolerant--but certainly not friendly--with this enigmatic man.Ted tells Bobby that the ""low men"" are out to get him and has Bobby scour the local telephone poles for lost-dog flyers of an unusual nature. The first one Bobby sees, he sloughs off because it could have been a real ad. A mistake.In ""Hearts in Atlantis"" a good movie? Very good, in my opinion. It uses a bracketing device of a 52-year-old Bobby revisiting his home town, which has become a semi-slum in the intervening four decades. (The movie was actually filmed at several towns in central Virginia, not in New England.) Attention to period detail, everything from greeting cards to Liz's elegant new clothes for a seminar, to what's on TV to automobiles, is spot-on.Anthony Hopkins, as Ted, is wonderful. His role causes him to be warm yet introspective and mysterious, and he brings real convinction to the role. The boy who played Bobby was fine. I had a little trouble with the ""Liz"" character because she didn't come out anywhere near as bee-witchy as in the novel. (Of course, the novel had the advantage of seeing straight into Liz's character.) The actress who played Liz comes across as distracted, not mean, but I don't have the heart to point the finger at the actress. The actress who played Carol, Bobby's first girlfriend, demonstrates a remakable acting range. I hope we see more of her.Like so many other Amazon reviewers, I read Stephen King's writing and I found this movie to be a very good adaptation of the novel. Of course, a novel of several hundred pages cannot be made into a hundred-page movie script without cutting, but the whole work is coherent and believable. Essentially it goes with the largest chapter of the King book.  IMHO the movie was a little underappreciated when it played in theaters and I for one had hoped the Oscar people would nominate it as Best Screenplay From Another Source (no such luck).Non-Stephen King followers, I think you will find this a good solid movie with just a hint of the supernatural (much less than in the novel), and a convincing look at a boy's coming-of-age. There are also some points made about male sexuality that, because of montage, are actually a little more intense in the film than in the novel. And I was impressed at how much of the original novel's language was kept intact in the film. Given that Hollywood has certain technical limitations in what it can portray, to me this was a convincing and gripping film.Surely there are many more North American households who will be glad they bought HEARTS IN ATLANTIS in DVD . . .  ?",4,ENCYCLOPEDIC STEVEN KING NOVEL YIELDS SOLID FILM,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,3601,"['HEARTS', 'IN', 'ATLANTIS', 'book', 'was', '800-page', 'work', 'author', 'Stephen', 'King', 'take', 'tumultuous', '1960s', 'book', 'number', 'separate', 'pieces', 'writing', 'just', 'barely', 'share', 'characters', 'movie', 'biggest', 'part', 'book', 'just', 'convenience', ""'ll"", 'call', 'novel', '1960', 'lower-middle', 'class', 'suburb', 'Bridgeport', 'CT.', 'Eleven-year-old', 'fatherless', 'Bobby', 'own', 'bicycle', 'mother', 'Liz', 'earn', 'money', 'Liz', 'common', 'refrain', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'leave', 'well', 'off', 'know', 'Liz', 'work', 'realty', 'firm', 'just', 'essentials', 'getting', 'know', 'Ted', 'Brautigan', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'new', 'neighbor', 'upstairs', 'Bobby', 'earning', 'dollar', 'day', 'reading', 'newspaper', 'Ted', 'somewhat', 'enigma', 'literature', 'Bobby', 'reach', 'realm', 'adult', 'fiction', 'mother', 'Liz', 'initially', 'Brautigan', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'sling', 'piano', 'eventually', 'more', 'tolerant', 'certainly', 'not', 'friendly', 'enigmatic', 'man.Ted', 'tells', 'Bobby', 'low', 'men', 'are', 'get', 'Bobby', 'scour', 'local', 'telephone', 'poles', 'lost-dog', 'flyers', 'unusual', 'nature', 'first', 'one', 'Bobby', 'sloughs', 'off', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'ad', 'mistake.In', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'good', 'movie', 'Very', 'good', 'opinion', 'bracketing', 'device', '52-year-old', 'Bobby', 'revisiting', 'home', 'town', 'become', 'semi-slum', 'intervening', 'four', 'decades', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'several', 'towns', 'central', 'Virginia', 'not', 'New', 'England', 'Attention', 'period', 'detail', 'everything', 'greeting', 'cards', 'Liz', 'elegant', 'new', 'clothes', 'seminar', 'what', 'TV', 'automobiles', 'spot-on.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ted', 'wonderful', 'role', 'be', 'warm', 'yet', 'introspective', 'mysterious', 'real', 'convinction', 'role', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Bobby', 'was', 'fine', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'Liz', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'anywhere', 'as', 'bee-witchy', 'novel', 'course', 'novel', 'had', 'advantage', 'seeing', 'straight', 'Liz', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Liz', 'distracted', 'not', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'point', 'finger', 'actress', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Carol', 'Bobby', 'first', 'girlfriend', 'remakable', 'acting', 'range', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'her.Like', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'writing', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'course', 'novel', 'several', 'hundred', 'pages', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'hundred-page', 'movie', 'script', 'cutting', 'whole', 'work', 'coherent', 'believable', 'Essentially', 'largest', 'chapter', 'King', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'underappreciated', 'when', 'played', 'theaters', 'one', 'had', 'hoped', 'Oscar', 'people', 'would', 'nominate', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Source', 'such', 'luck', '.Non-Stephen', 'King', 'followers', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'good', 'solid', 'movie', 'just', 'hint', 'supernatural', 'much', 'less', 'novel', 'convincing', 'look', 'boy', 'coming-of-age', 'are', 'also', 'points', 'made', 'male', 'sexuality', 'montage', 'are', 'actually', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'film', 'novel', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'original', 'novel', 'language', 'was', 'kept', 'intact', 'film', 'Given', 'Hollywood', 'certain', 'technical', 'limitations', 'what', 'can', 'portray', 'was', 'convincing', 'gripping', 'film.Surely', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'North', 'American', 'households', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'bought', 'HEARTS', 'IN', 'ATLANTIS', 'DVD']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

685467,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B00005UQ9V,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[1, 1]","I bought this title because Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors.  No matter how dull the theme may be he is always brilliant and always worth watching.  Always.The story is one of those nostalgia films, where the hero, Bobby Garfield,  returns as an adult (played by  David Morse) to his old home town, ala The Big Chill, after the death and funeral of a friend where he learns also that the love of his life has died a few years previously.  Visiting their old neighborhood, he learns as we all do the old adage that we can't go home again.  Nothing is ever the same.Standing in the ruins of the old house in which he had lived with his widowed mother, he recalls his eleventh birthday and the days following during which he meets a mysterious border in the apartment upstairs and develops a growing loyalty to him.The story has the appeal of a time past, the early 60s when life was supposedly simpler, but probably--almost certainly--wasn't.  The young Bobby is living with his angry, self centered and rather naive mother who has intimated that Bobby's father was an irresponsible gambler whose death left them destitute.  She gives the boy a free library card as his birthday gift, emphasizing that she would love to have given him a new bike as he wishes, but his father has left them with nothing but bills.  When his friend Carol notes that he hasn't gotten his bike, the boy defends his mother by reiterating her own excuse, but Carol notes that Bobby's mother has plenty of money for pretty new dresses.The tone of the movie is set in these relationships until the arrival of the mysterious Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins ) who has taken the apartment upstairs in the old house.  Here the story truly begins as Bobby learns lessons important to his life.  He learns the truth about his father, confronts the reality of his mother's selfishness and comes to view and forgive her as the human being she is, and most importantly, he comes to realize the power in himself to make decisions and take command of his destiny.The story is a little far fetched with respect to Hopkin's character, though he's at his best as usual.  It's as though the author (Stephen King) doesn't quite know where to go with the interesting beginning to the story, follows up the paths of the various characters adding mystery as spice, and ends up with two stories: that of a mystic character pursued by villains and that of a boy growing up in difficult circumstances.  The relationship of the stories seem tenuous at best, but it's a charming tale for the most part.

If he touches someone, he can read their minds. Sometimes he knows things about people without even touching them. He moves into the upstairs apartment above a widow and her 11-year-old son Bobby. In fact, the story opens on his 11th birthday. (Shades of Harry Potter, eh?)The boy makes friends with the old man, in spite of his mother's suspicions, and undertakes to do two things for him for a dollar a week (this is 1960). First, he is to read the newspaper to him, as his eyes are ""not what they once were."" The second is to keep an eye open for the ""Low Men,"" who are stalking Ted. They want to use his psychic gift for their own purposes, and he doesn't want to work for them. It's not entirely clear who they are, but they may be FBI.Anyway, Ted volunteers to look after Bobby for a week-end while his mother goes to a ""convention"" which has something to do with her job. Bobby is fine until his friend Carol is attacked by a bully in the park, and seems to have a broken arm. He carries her home, and Ted discovers that the arm is not broken, but her shoulder is dislocated. He fixes it, and just then Bobby's mother walks in and freaks out because Ted had Carol's blouse open to examine her shoulder. She had an undershirt on, after all, but Mom was hysterical, having just been raped by her boss in the hotel that week-end.There are ""missing"" posters up all over town now offering a reward for Brautigan, and Bobby's mother finds one and turns him in.

However if you are looking for crazed space monsters or spooky girls then this is not the movie for you.No movie can cram a whole novel into the limited time available and William Goldman, did a great job of picking while still making the story coherent.  The funereal scene and ending scene to make a complete story bracketed the ""Low Men"" story.  He removed all the supernatural references with the exception of being psychic.  Then Scott removed all the supernatural gimmicks and let the actors do their jobs.  William removed Kings potty mouth and Scott moves the gory scenes off screen, as viewing these is not necessary to the story.What's left is ""Hearts in Atlantis.""  As with many movies such as ""Thin Man, The"" (1957) by Dashiel Hammett, the movie transcends the writer to become something better then just an animated version of the book.

I read Hearts in Atlantis awhile back, so I don't remember every detail of the book.  I wonder if screenplay writer William Goldman ever read the book at all.The movie is based on the first part of Hearts in Atlantis called ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""  Set in the late 1950's, these Low Men are after Ted Brautigan, who is a border at Bobby Garfield's house.  Brautigan has psychic powers that cause him to be on the run from the FBI and also to help Bobby out in certain situations.  The magic of the book lies in Bobby's relationships with his best friends Carol Gerber and John Sullivan.The movie decides that telling the story of Bobby and Carol is good enough.  The two child actors are sweet together as they discover what it is like to be in love at that young age.  Bullies pick on Carol and Bobby gets revenge.The movie falls apart because of the framing of the story about Bobby and Carol and Ted.  The movie opens in the present with Bobby preparing to go to the funeral of John Sullivan (who is hardly in the movie at all).  Then Bobby receives a package containing an old baseball glove.  The movie ends with Bobby going back to where he grew up and reminiscing about his childhood.I don't want to give away anything, but the movie had no magic, no spine-tingling moments, like the book did.  Stephen King wrote a great book and tied it all together with a baseball glove, a note, and Bobby and Carol.  The movie version takes out all of the magic created by Stephen King and instead tells a simple coming of age story.I know that if I hadn't read the book, I would have still wondered what the point of this movie was.  This movie could have been a lot better if they had added a few minutes and followed the book more closely.I do not recommend this movie at all.

685477,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,B00005UQ9V,Carlisle Wheeling,"[3, 3]","The trailer looked great, but of course it would.  That's the way they sucker the novel's fans into renting this turkey.  If you have read the book, you will know that the title is already off and that this is a miscarriage of justice to the section they concentrated on.  The book Hearts in Atlantis is long and has five different stories in it that tie the entire theme together.  If you haven't read the book, you might like this movie as I see a lot of positive reviews for it.  If you have read King's novel and love every page of it, to be impressed with this cinematic blasphemy is not to be a true fan of King's extraordinarily magical and thoughtful work.Obviously funded by a low budget (most of which probably went to pay Anthony Hopkins), the movie centers on the first and longest section of the novel, Low Men in Yellow Coats.  Well, there are no yellow coats, and the villains aren't the edgy and scary aleins they are supposed to be.  What are they here, gangsters?  Is anyone even sure?  Though there is a very good cast here, the script is horribly adapted from just this one excerpt of the novel, and when it's done with, you feel cheated.  So many things that were wonderful about this story were changed so that there was no magic or point to it.  King writes in a manner--especially in this case--that makes you aware of how all the pieces fit together.  This movie is awful and painfully disjointed in so many places that, were it not for some of the dialog and certain situations adapted from the book, you would never recognize it as the same story.  They should have called it The Low Men.  Hearts in Atlantis belongs to another section of the book in which college students were so addicted to the card game that they ended up flunking out of school and getting drafted in Vietnam, all while listening to artists like Donovan and the Beatles.There's one saving grace:  the soundtrack.  It is basically consistent with King's story, but not much else is.  They change so many things that the magic of the story is lost, and none of the actors can save it.  I'm surprised that Anthony Hopkins would even associate himself with this project, because it's just that bad.  What happened to any mention of Lord of the Flies, a book that was terribly important to Bobby once Ted introduced it to him, and the parallels the book had in his own life?I could go on and on about everything that was wrong in contrast to the book, but I won't.  NOW HERE IS A MAJOR SPOILER FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE NEITHER SEEN THIS MOVIE OR READ KING'S NOVEL:  I was particularly displeased with the way Sully was barely mentioned, and the fact that they killed off Carol Gerber.  Carol was alive at the end of the book after hiding out for years, having gotten into trouble with a group of extreme radicals in the late 60s, providing for a bittersweet ending.  No, they had to spoil that too.  That's what really upset me the most, let alone how they handled the three bullies in the story.To wrap things up, all I can tell you is to get King's novel, especially the audio book narrated by William Hurt and King himself.  It is truly excellent and worth the time invested.  There you will find all the magic that's missing from this drivel, and you will appreciate King as more than just a horror writer.  The book is beautiful, poetic, touching, and an honest assessment of the loss of America's innocence.  Don't waste your time with this movie.

That was alright, for it was the longest and the best of the stories in the book. I watched it last night, and I loved it. It mainly stuck to the story on which it was based (The screenwriter to this film is William Goldman who wrote the great adaptation of Stephen King's Misery). Sure, it got rid of the references to Stephen King's The Dark Tower book series, but that was perfectly fine. My guess for why they got rid of the links from that series is because no one has filmed them. Well anyways, the acting in this film is exceptional (especially by Anthony Hopkins and David Morse). The cinematography and music are well done too. I will recommend this to fans of Stephen King and of this kind of genre. I hope that someday the studios direct a sequel or sequels based on the other story segments in the book. They could film the second story (which is also the title story) and call it Hearts In Atlantis II. Then they can film the last three stories Blind Willie, Why We're In Vietnam, and Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling into one film and call it Hearts in Atlantis III. We could have a Trilogy of movies based on the book.

The mystery is supplied by Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), the upstairs boarder with a psychic gift and a fear of the 'low men' who are hunting him.  The disillusionment comes from his own mother (Hope Davis), a struggling single woman whose dreams are rather cruelly crushed in the course of the film.This film revisits territory mapped out in a previous film based on a King story, ""Stand By Me,"" in which the idyllic world of youth, marked by standard childhood preoccupations (friends, a new bike) and terrors (the neighborhood bully) is invaded by the macabre or supernatural, which stands for the unknowns of the wider world.  King has used this device repeatedly and effectively.  Played by a gifted cast, it works again here, although it offers few surprises.  Brautigan's psychic power is handled in a low-key manner, which has frustrated some reviewers.

In the book the cars they drove were glowing, monstrous variations of actual luxury cars.  In the movie they were just big black cars.

Despite its supernatural shadows, this film is, at its core, about the friendship between a man and a young boy. A stranger, Ted Brautigan (played by Anthony Hopkins) arrives in a small town and takes a room in a boarding house where an emotionally-broken woman (Hope Davis) and her son Bobby (Anton Yelchin) live.  Bobby, who is hungry for a father figure, finds companionship in Ted's quiet, wise manner as they read, and discuss, the daily newspaper. But Ted is a wanted man.  He is being sought by the &quot;low men,&quot; mysterious mind-readers who want Ted for their government project and who thus endanger the blossoming relationship between man and boy.&quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is beautifully filmed and edited, with shadows and visual flashes and an eeriness that creates an atmosphere lurking with uncertainty and danger.  The scenes between Hopkins and Yelchin are taut and subtle.  Actress Hope Davis as Bobby's selfish mother is less convincing.  Despite this unevenness, I thoroughly enjoyed this mesmerizing movie.This is Hopkins's showcase, through and through, and he does not disappoint.  The story is suspenseful, the underlying currents strong, and the acting competent at its worst.  Only near the end does it get sentimental.Those who have read and loved King's novel might best steer clear, since I've been told by several people that this film disappoints in comparison.

Scott Hicks directs the Stephen King story with the utmost perception and attention to detail, and the result is absolutely spellbinding, striking such an emotional chord that the film becomes one of the year's finest cinematic achievements.But Hicks' vision is not the only thing in the film's favor: along with the visual beauty of the movie comes a glorious coming-of-age story in which a small boy's life is forever changed by a mysterious stranger. That boy is Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), who lives with his widowed mother in a small Connecticut town. His mother, who works as a secretary for a realtor, makes excuses for not having enough money to buy Bobby nice things. His life seems glum and uneventful, until the new tenant for the upstairs apartment arrives.Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) senses right from the start the inner turmoil in young Bobby's life, and offers him his friendship and a chance to earn his keep by reading him the newspaper each day. Bobby jumps at the chance, and soon becomes fascinated by Ted's stories from his life. However, Ted also reveals to Bobby that there are men in search of him, referring to them as the &quot;low men,&quot; who drive shiny cars and post signs all over town.The story progresses quite nicely. Hicks' pacing gives the audience a chance to get into the story, as well as allowing the narrative to develop its characters, something many modern films ignore. In effect, we feel more for these characters, and can share their pain in their struggles. The attention to the friendship between Bobby and Carol (Mika Boorem) is intricate and detailed, and just as their friendship is given a chance to flourish, so is that of Bobby and Ted, whose careful examinations of the world provide some of the most moving dialogue of this or any movie.Like his previous novel, &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; Stephen King dabbles a little in the supernatural with &quot;Atlantis,&quot; though the presence of such elements in this film is kept at a minimum. Ted's ability to read people's thoughts is a plot device that will come back to take him away before the movie's finale, and aside from a few singled-out observations by Ted and a sequence involving Bobby playing cards at the fair, there is little supernatural goings-on present. But in the interest of the story's greater good, it matters little. This is not a story about otherworldly ability as much as it is one about coming-of-age, and the people who affect this passage of time.Anthony Hopkins is in his finest form yet, in perhaps the best performance of his life. He plays Ted with intellect and passion for the simple things in life, embodying in him a soul and spirit that becomes the heartbeat of the film. His child costars, Yelchin and Boorem, are two of the most talented child actors I've seen to date; even Haley Joel Osment pales in comparison to the emotions these two young actors are able to evoke and portray. The interaction among these three stars is compelling and full of heartwarming tenderness, moving me many times to tears of sadness and joy.It is rare that a movie has such a great emotional effect on me, but &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is one of them. A stellar combination of superb acting, brilliant direction, lucid storytelling and excellent pacing, the film is one of the most visionary and exuberant coming-of-age stories committed to film, a portrait of the time in each of our lives that we are too quick to forget. It bleeds of innocence gone by, of human spirit and emotion, and earns itself a place among the best movies of this or any year.",5,One of the year's best!

685488,A17DIJKOYG916E,B00005UQ9V,"Don A. Frascinella ""Don F 2009""","[5, 5]","Once more, Anthony Hopkins proves that he is one of the finest actors of our time in this excellent adaptation of the Stephen King novel (when you get William Goldman adapting a King novel, you can't go too far wrong).Hopkins stars at Ted Brautigan, a mysterious man who comes to live with 11 year old Bobby Garfield (a teriffic performance by Anton Yelchin) and his widowed mother, a bitter woman who hates Bobby's late father, herself and even her son (another wonderful role for the underrated Hope Davis). Ted and Bobby soon develop a bond and Ted becomes a surrogate father to the boy. Ted has these unusual powers - he can read people's thoughts - which Bobby soon acquires. All the while, Ted is on the run from the ""Low Men"", a mysterious group of men who are never clearly explained, but it is obvious that Ted's powers are something they want for themselves.The scenes between Bobby and Ted are very touching, as are the scenes with Bobby and his girlfriend Carol (yet another 4 star performance from a young actress named Mika Booren). The scene where Bobby carries the injured Carol on his back, inspired by the feats of Chicago Bears great Bronco Nagurski, is very moving.There appear to be many themes to the story - a person's need for friendship and love, loyalty and trust, and appreciating what you have before it is gone. I did not read the Steven King story so I had no preconceived notions about the movie. Although the story is very complicated and a bit complex, it is thoroughly involving and the 2 hours were up in a flash.This is a movie that I will buy when it gets to DVD.

685489,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00005UQ9V,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[2, 3]","Screenwriter William Goldman had quite a challenge adapting the most unusual of Steven King's books to film.  King's original is a collection of 5 loosely related stories and only the first (and longest) of these is presented in the film.  To make matters more challenging, that particular story is a spin-off from King's Gunslinger series; without knowledge of that series his readers are likely to be scratching their heads in puzzlement.  So how to deal with this dilemma?  Goldman's answer is to ignore it completely.Only the skeleton of the story Low Men in Yellow Coats remains in the film.  Anthony Hopkins' character is no longer a Breaker who escaped from the world of the Dark Tower and the thrall of the Crimson King; now he is merely a psychic from our own world.  The Low Men have inexplicably doffed their Yellow Coats in favor of dark suits (did they have their colors done and discover that they aren't Warm Spring?).  More importantly, rather than being hideously evil supernatural demons who only temporarily wear a human disguise, they are hideously evil humans, er, I mean, they are FBI guys, sorta...(Hopkins only says ""something like that"" and we learn nothing more.)  Those elements that made such a strange, bizarre and consequentially intriguing story have been stripped away from the film.  The climactic scene in which the protagonist is captured by the Low Men in Yellow Coats is missing entirely.Instead, except for a few moments, it is an almost gentle coming-of-age story.  Without considering the original, the movie is an effective piece of work, with excellent performances by the child actors Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem, and a somewhat disengaged reading by Hopkins.  But given that his character was written (in the script, not the book) as disengaged, it's hard to know what else he could have done--although his mumbling often had me wondering exactly what he'd just said.  Honestly, Goldman was not at the top of his form.  The last lines sound like words of wisdom--""There was an enduring gift Ted gave me.  What he did was open my eyes and let the future in...""  But what do they actually mean?  What child does not, at some point, open his eyes to the future?  Is this such a special gift, the loss of innocence?  I'm baffled, and frankly disappointed.One final note for you music buffs--composer Mychael Danna makes a clever allusion to the love theme from Prokofiev's ballet Romeo and Juliet in the scene on the Ferris Wheel, when the hero's first kiss occurs.",3,What Might Have Been,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,2507,"['Screenwriter', 'William', 'Goldman', 'had', 'quite', 'challenge', 'adapting', 'most', 'unusual', 'Steven', 'King', 'books', 'film', 'King', 'original', 'collection', '5', 'loosely', 'related', 'stories', 'only', 'first', 'longest', 'presented', 'film', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'challenging', 'particular', 'story', 'spin-off', 'King', 'Gunslinger', 'series', 'knowledge', 'series', 'readers', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'scratching', 'heads', 'puzzlement', 'how', 'deal', 'dilemma', 'Goldman', 'answer', 'ignore', 'completely.Only', 'skeleton', 'story', 'Low', 'Men', 'Yellow', 'Coats', 'film', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'character', 'no', 'longer', 'Breaker', 'who', 'escaped', 'world', 'Dark', 'Tower', 'thrall', 'Crimson', 'King', 'now', 'merely', 'psychic', 'own', 'world', 'Low', 'Men', 'have', 'inexplicably', 'doffed', 'Yellow', 'Coats', 'favor', 'dark', 'suits', 'did', 'have', 'colors', 'done', 'discover', 'are', ""n't"", 'Warm', 'Spring', 'More', 'importantly', 'rather', 'being', 'hideously', 'evil', 'supernatural', 'demons', 'who', 'only', 'temporarily', 'wear', 'human', 'disguise', 'are', 'hideously', 'evil', 'humans', 'er', 'mean', 'are', 'FBI', 'guys', 'sorta', 'Hopkins', 'only', 'something', 'learn', 'nothing', 'more', 'elements', 'made', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'consequentially', 'intriguing', 'story', 'have', 'been', 'stripped', 'away', 'film', 'climactic', 'scene', 'protagonist', 'captured', 'Low', 'Men', 'Yellow', 'Coats', 'missing', 'entirely.Instead', 'few', 'moments', 'almost', 'gentle', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'considering', 'original', 'movie', 'effective', 'piece', 'work', 'excellent', 'performances', 'child', 'actors', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'somewhat', 'disengaged', 'reading', 'Hopkins', 'given', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'script', 'not', 'book', 'disengaged', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'mumbling', 'often', 'had', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'just', 'said', 'Honestly', 'Goldman', 'was', 'not', 'top', 'form', 'last', 'lines', 'sound', 'words', 'wisdom', 'was', 'enduring', 'gift', 'Ted', 'gave', 'What', 'did', 'was', 'open', 'eyes', 'let', 'future', 'what', 'do', 'actually', 'mean', 'What', 'child', 'not', 'point', 'open', 'eyes', 'future', 'such', 'special', 'gift', 'loss', 'innocence', ""'m"", 'baffled', 'frankly', 'disappointed.One', 'final', 'note', 'music', 'buffs', 'composer', 'Mychael', 'Danna', 'clever', 'allusion', 'love', 'theme', 'Prokofiev', 'ballet', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'scene', 'Ferris', 'Wheel', 'when', 'hero', 'first', 'kiss', 'occurs']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

While I am no fan of King's in general, he occasionally writes 'above' his station and even more rarely, finds a decent company to make the film version. So it is one of those happy coincidences. Based on the story ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" which is taken from King's 5-short-story bookHearts In Atlantis.Sir Anthony Hopkins plays Ted, a remote-viewing psychic fleeing from the government in the early 1960s, when Nixon was Vice President. He alights on a town I'd swear is called St. Gaines (Hopkins confronts three bullies and calls the ""the unholy trio of St. Gaines"", so it could be an obscure literary thing). Actually this film was shot on location in Richmond Beach, Virginia which makes an excellent stand-in for Connecticut where the story is set.He boards with a mother and son (respectively played by Hope Davis and a very young Anton Yelchin), quickly making pals with the boy. Soon the boy learns of Ted's powers, and of ""the low men"" who are seeking him: the original Men in Black as I see it. Ted is a psychic remote viewer, and whether this is true or film fantasy, the gimmick is Hoover was recruiting psychics at the time to catch commies.Rumor is, since I never read King, that old Ted is actually an extraterrestrial, but the director did not wish to go down that road. Clever move in my opinion. You can catch a final glimpse of Ted in the seventh (and last) book of King'sThe Dark Tower Boxed Set (Books 1-4)series. The Men in Black were originally aliens too. See how a good director can wring the best juice out of a mediocre writer like King?Hey, but I'll believe almost anything about Hoover. So the Men in Black are his ""thugs, bullies"" as Ted calls them. And they want Ted back. Rounding out this interesting cast is a very sweet young girl named Carol (the stunning Mika Boorem, a versatile child actress who has since hit the skids), Yelchin's ""little girlfriend"".The tale is about growing up - just a little - and about the boy's bond with the old English psychic. Naturally, in the end the old man plans to go, and the rest I will not spoil in case you haven't seen this yet. I watch it as often as I'm in the mood, since I think the director did a terrific job. He took King's normally eerie writing and made it a lot more family-friendly. David Morse, playing the adult Bobby to Anton Yelchin's little kid, adds to the time-span atmosphere covering 40 years.Overall this is an excellent film that could have been ruined utterly, had they stuck with King's original. Get it as a family film and savor the wonderful moments which fill this weird, gentle movie.And never forget the Low Men in dark clothes and dark hats.",4,"""One feels them first in the back of one's eyes.""",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2737,"['HEARTS', 'IN', 'ATLANTIS', 'Writ', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Dir', 'Scott', 'Hicks', '2001', 'so', 'easy', 'review', 'am', 'fan', 'King', 'general', 'occasionally', 'station', 'even', 'more', 'rarely', 'decent', 'company', 'make', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'happy', 'coincidences', 'Based', 'story', 'Low', 'Men', 'Yellow', 'Coats', 'taken', 'King', '5-short-story', 'bookHearts', 'Atlantis.Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ted', 'remote-viewing', 'psychic', 'fleeing', 'government', 'early', '1960s', 'when', 'Nixon', 'was', 'Vice', 'President', 'town', ""'d"", 'swear', 'called', 'St.', 'Gaines', 'Hopkins', 'confronts', 'three', 'bullies', 'unholy', 'trio', 'St.', 'Gaines', 'could', 'be', 'obscure', 'literary', 'thing', 'Actually', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Richmond', 'Beach', 'Virginia', 'excellent', 'stand-in', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'story', 'set.He', 'boards', 'mother', 'son', 'respectively', 'played', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'very', 'young', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'quickly', 'making', 'pals', 'boy', 'boy', 'learns', 'Ted', 'powers', 'low', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'original', 'Men', 'Black', 'see', 'Ted', 'psychic', 'remote', 'viewer', 'true', 'film', 'fantasy', 'gimmick', 'Hoover', 'was', 'recruiting', 'psychics', 'time', 'catch', 'commies.Rumor', 'never', 'read', 'King', 'old', 'Ted', 'actually', 'extraterrestrial', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'wish', 'go', 'down', 'road', 'Clever', 'move', 'opinion', 'can', 'catch', 'final', 'glimpse', 'Ted', 'seventh', 'last', 'book', ""King'sThe"", 'Dark', 'Tower', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'Books', '1-4', 'series', 'Men', 'Black', 'were', 'originally', 'too', 'See', 'how', 'good', 'director', 'can', 'wring', 'best', 'juice', 'mediocre', 'writer', 'King', 'Hey', ""'ll"", 'believe', 'almost', 'anything', 'Hoover', 'Men', 'Black', 'are', 'thugs', 'bullies', 'Ted', 'want', 'Ted', 'back', 'Rounding', 'out', 'interesting', 'cast', 'very', 'sweet', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Carol', 'stunning', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'versatile', 'child', 'actress', 'who', 'hit', 'skids', 'Yelchin', 'little', 'girlfriend', '.The', 'tale', 'growing', 'up', 'just', 'little', 'boy', 'bond', 'old', 'English', 'psychic', 'Naturally', 'end', 'old', 'man', 'go', 'rest', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'case', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'watch', 'as', 'often', ""'m"", 'mood', 'think', 'director', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'took', 'King', 'normally', 'eerie', 'writing', 'made', 'lot', 'more', 'family-friendly', 'David', 'Morse', 'playing', 'adult', 'Bobby', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'little', 'kid', 'time-span', 'atmosphere', 'covering', '40', 'years.Overall', 'excellent', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ruined', 'utterly', 'had', 'stuck', 'King', 'original', 'Get', 'family', 'film', 'savor', 'wonderful', 'moments', 'fill', 'weird', 'gentle', 'movie.And', 'never', 'forget', 'Low', 'Men', 'dark', 'clothes', 'dark', 'hats']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)
685492,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,B00005UQ9V,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[2, 3]","I only read one persons review about this movie. I wanted to just come here and post this from the Heart; my heart, right to you after watching it. So I apologize to you if many things are said that are redundant.'Yorgos' I think kind of told the masses here, in essence, how I felt while viewing this absolute delight, this wonderment and uplifting spirit that soared through my tears and my memories, and transgressed to a space that only few films can migrate to. My inner child.I wont dissect the film and compare it to this or that, like so many ignorant reviewers do all the time referring to its cinematic wonder and transform a simple spirited, heart touching movie into some frog dissecting assignment in 10th grade biology. I think, intrinsically, a film can be so much deeper than it was orginally intended. You can talk about how loosely it was adapted from ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"", and how dismel and paltry audience reaction was to this (didn't it gross only around 20 million or so?), but can you blame the masses? Where the next Fantastic Four or Spiderman await the naivete and senses of broad age specific persons, a film like this naturally, in almost any case, would seep through the cracks. There are only a specific genre of people, and children, who would find this movie uplifting and cherish its message. Not everyone can dance between the raindrops friends.Like 'Yorgos' review below, I had mixed reviews throughout as well. However the nostalgic warmth I felt as the movie progressed, gave me this euphoric cheek to cheek smile, this wonderful aura created itself upon where I was viewing this, and perhaps the 'Barefoot' Merlot I was drinking, gave my senses and emotions a bigger lift than if I wasn't having a glass, however I felt so good about life, and people, and wonders of the world after viewing this. Is that not what film, friends, what film in all it's purity and saturation to our keen senses is supposed to do for us? Touch something inside, and leave its message their long after viewing is over? Don't we all want one of life's greatest wonders to move in above our parents home?I think the chemistry and at times sheer brilliant cinematography was incandescent with the times, and 'Anton Yelchin' (who was recoginzed for a Young Arist award evidentally) and 'Mika Boorem' play off each other wonderfully. They absolutely radiated on screen. It must be hard for a director to do very intimate scenes with pre-teens, or cusping teenagers, and the scene on the ferris wheel was no different. Kudos for not making it to sentimental, or too over the top. I wanted to be 14 again, at the state fair, and budding up with my guy friends, waiting to see the beautiful Sally spring forth from somewhere behind the Tilt-O-Whirl. In my minds eye, I caught that grace and splendid camera view as well.The horrors of ignorance of the jilded over protective ignorant mother, and society as a whole, when coming upon children with men, and realizing that perhaps almost immediately, the thought of something 'not normal' or 'disturbing' enters into the psyche. That is such a shame that we live in a world where an old man cannot befriend a boy, in fear of him being a diddler. Truly sad. How many boys need mentors, how many fatherless boys would have yearned to have a Ted in their lives, even for a small fraction of time. The difference could shape a persons life.Upon going into a film, save for the latest '300', I rarely if ever read a review about it. I wonder why I would let someone else put emotions or loathing in my head about something that will, in essence, be my eyes watching it. I thought Hearts in Atlantis was about the lost city of Atlantis perhaps, and that maybe Ted was from there. Since it was from King, I ignorantly thought it would be more on the supernatural side. How wrong I was in so many ways, and that is my point. How wonderfully suprised and uplifted I was after this movie. If I read anything about it before seeing it, I might have already formed pre-conceived notions about its subject matter or had a spoiler or two thrown in for good measure. I called several people to tell them about it immediately after viewing.For this reviewer, 'Hearts in Atlantis' was sappy, it was nostalgic, it was bittersweet, it was full of such amazing songs, it was evoking memories in me that few movies get to do, and it showed me how powerful that a movie from nowhere, can come up and grab us in the behind, and tickle our eyes to water, just for a bit, and then round it out, with an amazing performance by a young gentleman; and Hopkins, in his pure metaphysical craft, can send a kiss in the wind, and lend us a quote for the cosmos: ""Sometimes when you're young, you have moments of such happiness, you think you're living in someplace magical, like Atlantis must have been? Then we grow up and our hearts break into two.""Thank you Scott Hicks.",3,"""It's funny how when you're a kid, a day can last forever.

685493,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005UQ9V,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[1, 4]","In more ways than one, Hearts in Atlantis is can be compared, and could be considered worse than Twilight: New Moon. I don't know how the book is, but Hearts in Atlantis is one of the most paint-by-numbers Steven King works I've ever watched, and what's worse is that the filmmaking behind it is deplorable, with a basic misunderstanding of how a film works.The story is that of a coming-of-age tale of three kids in the 1960s. The film will tell you this by showing you pictures of the trio playing set to period music like ""The Twist."" Did I also mention that it barrows HEAVILY from Stand By Me, with none of the interesting plot, conversations or acting that made that movie good. Anton Yelchin is an ok actor, but when this movie asks him to carry it, he simply can't do it. Thus, all the ""acting"" in the movie is centered around Anthony Hopkins. But I even have a problem with him. Granted, I can't tell when the man is mailing in a performance anymore, but if you wanted Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, then by golly, you get Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins. Defenders may say, 'Oh, it's so well acted!' No, it's just Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins.Let's get back to the story. Essentially, what make this film interesting is that Anthony Hopkins has some sort of psychic ability which I believe he passes along to the boy. At one point, Anthony Hopkins relocates a girl's shoulder, psychically. This should be one of the more critical emotional points of the film, but instead it's presented in such a lifeless form that it fails on any level of what it was trying to achieve. Maybe this is a side-effect of the pacing. The pacing is such that when something actually happens, you just get angry because you were waiting for something to happen. Guess what folks, NOTHING DOES. The grand finale of the movie is Anthony Hopkins being taken away by the ""low men"" and Anthony Hopkins yelling out to Bobby, ""I wouldn't have missed it for all the world!"" Looking back on it as an adult, Bobby also says this line as if to reinforce the fact that the characters believe this to be true, even though you could really find no evidence of this being true upon looking back on the film. I mean, besides the fact that I've never met a psychic old guy, I've had more interesting coming-of-age stories myself, and I consider myself a fairly ordinary person.Other Quibbles: Hope Davis plays Bobby's self-centered mom. Granted, I don't think they were going for a likable character here, but it's hard not to be at least the slightest bit happy when she gets raped by her boss whom she's been sleeping with.Overall, this is movie makes Hearts In Atlantis Steven King's ""Twilight: New Moon."" It's a coming-of-age story where two people form a supposedly interesting relationship where there is no interest to be found with characters, who lack any sense of depth, which is not helped by the fact that the acting is poor. Plus, NOTHING HAPPENS. It may be good for hardcore Steven King fans, or hardcore Anthony Hopkins fans, because God only knows you get a lot of Anthony Hopkins acting like Anthony Hopkins, but otherwise, this is a BAD film in almost every sense of the word. I watched it for free on Netflix Watch Instantly and found my free time with the film wasted.

Its one of those movies that stands on its own from the compelling acting and the portrayal of the characters.  I loved this film enough to give it four stars but I see where the negative reviews come from at the same time.  The book was a phenomenal piece of fiction, one of King's best.  Ok, I always say every newer book he writes is his best but this ranks up at the top.  Ted and Bobby share a very great friendship in the film, fulfilling their need for companionship.  Bobby and Caroline's friendship is portrayed well in this film along with the hints of supernatural.It keeps your interest from beginning to end, it has a very good build to the conclusion and yet, there is so much that should have been added to the film that it makes you shake your head and wonder why so much was left out.  There was no explanation for who the low men were and they concentrated on the friendship of the man and boy yet at the same time left out almost the entire book.  I don't get that.  So I'm left shaking my head, enjoying the movie but disappointed ultimately.This is a prime example of why movies are never as good as books. Still if you haven't read the book, its a five star film.

685497,A2JIU9KUIZ71E2,B00005UQ9V,"Gina Marie Warswick ""lover of the arts""","[0, 0]","Do we ever REALLY have doubts about Anthony Hopkins?  No.  He is one of the finest actors to grace this earth, so it is no wonder how the best moments in the film revolve around him interacting with his young co-star, Anton Yelchin.  Sadly, though, when the two of them aren't interacting, the action is painfully slow.  There is some pleasant humor involved in the film, but for a two hour work, the film runs LONG.  I think this is just something indicative of Scott Hicks' work, as I thought much the same thing of his acclaimed Shine with Geoffrey Rush.The main thing which was off-putting was the story was advertized quite differently in the theatrical trailer.  The trailer leads us to believe Hopkins' character has some sort of mystical, other-worldly powers (almost like Michael Clarke Duncan's Green Mile character), and so you come to expect something along those lines...like perhaps Stephen King was repeating himself.  The trailer also leads you to believe these mystical powers are then passed on to the young boy.  As I don't want to spoil the film for anyone who wasn't as fortunate as I was to catch this in sneak preview, I will just say the trailer doesn't exactly give the viewer the correct impression of the storyline.  Also, the trailer doesn't even make serious mention of Hope Davis as the boy's mother, in a dynamically painful role.  Her character was a dispicable example of a mother, yet the performance was beautifully executed.There are some powerful moments in this film, to be sure.  Hopkins has a monologue about sports, which is later echoed in a scene where the young boy must carry his hurt girlfriend up a huge hill, and the cinematography is tight, airy, and dark when it needs to be.  The whole concept of &quot;the lowman&quot; character seems a little too 1950sish to work on our jaded, 21st century eyes, but the film IS set in the 50s, so go figure.Hopkins' character is soft and approachable, which is a nice change from seeing him eat &quot;liver and fava beans&quot;, but there is a moment where he threatens a neighborhood boy bully with information, and you see that magnificently intense power he always possesses in every role he takes.Bottom line, go see it to appreciate the acting, but don't count on the story to move you as much as you would think.  Some holes and unanswered questions make the story suffer, but Hopkins, Yelchin, and Davis are great.",3,"Preview is a bit misleading, but competent is Hopkins!",1001721600,"09 29, 2001",2001,2409,"['Do', 'ever', 'REALLY', 'have', 'doubts', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'No', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'grace', 'earth', 'wonder', 'how', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'revolve', 'interacting', 'young', 'co-star', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Sadly', 'though', 'when', 'two', 'are', ""n't"", 'interacting', 'action', 'painfully', 'slow', 'pleasant', 'humor', 'involved', 'film', 'two', 'hour', 'work', 'film', 'LONG', 'think', 'just', 'something', 'indicative', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'work', 'thought', 'much', 'same', 'thing', 'acclaimed', 'Shine', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush.The', 'main', 'thing', 'was', 'off-putting', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'advertized', 'quite', 'differently', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'trailer', 'believe', 'Hopkins', 'character', 'sort', 'mystical', 'other-worldly', 'powers', 'almost', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Green', 'Mile', 'character', 'so', 'come', 'expect', 'something', 'lines', 'perhaps', 'Stephen', 'King', 'was', 'repeating', 'trailer', 'also', 'believe', 'mystical', 'powers', 'are', 'then', 'passed', 'young', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'fortunate', 'was', 'catch', 'sneak', 'preview', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'give', 'viewer', 'correct', 'impression', 'storyline', 'Also', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'serious', 'mention', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'boy', 'mother', 'dynamically', 'painful', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'dispicable', 'example', 'mother', 'yet', 'performance', 'was', 'beautifully', 'are', 'powerful', 'moments', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'Hopkins', 'monologue', 'sports', 'later', 'echoed', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'boy', 'must', 'carry', 'hurt', 'girlfriend', 'up', 'huge', 'hill', 'cinematography', 'tight', 'airy', 'dark', 'when', 'be', 'whole', 'concept', 'quot', 'lowman', 'quot', 'character', 'little', 'too', '1950sish', 'work', 'jaded', '21st', 'century', 'eyes', 'film', 'IS', 'set', '50s', 'so', 'go', 'figure.Hopkins', 'character', 'soft', 'approachable', 'nice', 'change', 'seeing', 'eat', 'quot', 'fava', 'beans', 'quot', 'moment', 'where', 'neighborhood', 'boy', 'bully', 'information', 'see', 'magnificently', 'intense', 'power', 'always', 'role', 'line', 'go', 'see', 'appreciate', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'story', 'move', 'as', 'much', 'would', 'think', 'holes', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'make', 'story', 'suffer', 'Hopkins', 'Yelchin', 'Davis', 'are', 'great']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

He said the book actually continues long past where the movie left off.  So, being a huge King fan, I am going to tell you that I think this is not such a bad thing. Would he rather you read his book? Maybe? I think it's a teaser and a great marketing skill at that (James Patterson is guilty of the same with his ""Roses Are Red""). If you saw the movie (without reading the book) you are going be curious enough to read his novel to find out what happens next. Then, I imagine he will not leave us hanging, but release the rest of the book to film at a later date. I hope I am right.

The book is a great book about the growing process of a young teenager when confronted to a substitute of his dead father that can open his mind to life, to culture, to literature, to danger and to love. The film is by far too short to show all the details of this essential situation for any kid : the opening of a mind and a personality to the wide wild world. By being too short it looks like a sketch if not a caricature. The whole cultural dimension is lost, particularly the discovery of literature and the pleasure to read books. Actually no book is read in the film, and no book is discussed in the film. The danger that is chasing Ted Brautigam is not clearly shown and identified, though it is not identified in the book either, but it is described in many details. Here things go too fast, the mouse falls in the trap too quickly. We are and remain hungry after this meal. The mother, on the other hand, is quite clearly shown has a naive and selfish bigot. She spends most of her income on dresses and accuses her dead husband to have left her miserable and with many debts, which is quickly shown as false. But she is naive to the point of not seeing that her boss is inviting her to a  convention  over a week-end, because he wants a woman to be at her service during that time. She ends up raped, and she had not even thought of her boss's duplicity, in spite of previous situations that she had had to face. The film is maybe a little bit sketchy on that point. But this woman is a bigot at the same time and sees evil everywhere, particularly in this male stranger that arrives one day and rents the second floor apartment. And yet she is a bigot as long as she does not need the man to take care of her son during her  convention  weekend. And she does not seem to wonder too hard where the two thousand dollars come from on the night the neighbor goes away. She just takes the money, though she will, to compensate maybe for her lack of love, buy the dream bike her son had coveted all summer long. In other words this film could have been a lot better.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,11 is a difficult age that needs a door to life,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2201,"['film', 'aging', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'adapted', 'book', 'Stephen', 'King', 'same', 'title', 'book', 'great', 'book', 'growing', 'process', 'young', 'teenager', 'when', 'confronted', 'substitute', 'dead', 'father', 'can', 'open', 'mind', 'life', 'culture', 'literature', 'danger', 'love', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'show', 'details', 'essential', 'situation', 'kid', 'opening', 'mind', 'personality', 'wide', 'wild', 'world', 'being', 'too', 'short', 'sketch', 'not', 'caricature', 'whole', 'cultural', 'dimension', 'lost', 'particularly', 'discovery', 'literature', 'pleasure', 'read', 'books', 'Actually', 'book', 'read', 'film', 'book', 'discussed', 'film', 'danger', 'chasing', 'Ted', 'Brautigam', 'not', 'clearly', 'shown', 'identified', 'not', 'identified', 'book', 'described', 'many', 'details', 'Here', 'things', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'mouse', 'trap', 'too', 'quickly', 'are', 'remain', 'hungry', 'meal', 'mother', 'other', 'hand', 'quite', 'clearly', 'shown', 'naive', 'selfish', 'bigot', 'most', 'income', 'dresses', 'dead', 'husband', 'have', 'left', 'miserable', 'many', 'debts', 'quickly', 'shown', 'false', 'naive', 'point', 'not', 'seeing', 'boss', 'inviting', 'convention', 'week-end', 'woman', 'be', 'service', 'time', 'up', 'raped', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'thought', 'boss', 'duplicity', 'spite', 'previous', 'situations', 'had', 'had', 'face', 'film', 'maybe', 'little', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'point', 'woman', 'bigot', 'same', 'time', 'sees', 'evil', 'everywhere', 'particularly', 'male', 'stranger', 'one', 'day', 'second', 'floor', 'apartment', 'yet', 'bigot', 'as', 'long', 'not', 'need', 'man', 'take', 'care', 'son', 'convention', 'weekend', 'not', 'seem', 'wonder', 'too', 'hard', 'where', 'two', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'come', 'night', 'neighbor', 'away', 'just', 'money', 'will', 'compensate', 'maybe', 'lack', 'love', 'buy', 'dream', 'son', 'had', 'coveted', 'summer', 'long', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

Young Anton Yelchin was equally great as Bobby Garfield, he showed a lot of maturity in the role, and many of his scenes with Hopkins were well acted including some of the best dialogues.

685510,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00005UQ9V,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[7, 8]","With 'little' not being a derogatory adjective.  This is a 'little' story lifted from a larger Stephen King project, a tale that is altered a 'little' bit by William Goldman and Scott Hicks, and is presented as a 'little' slice of the growing up years of a young boy, Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) in a Connecticut town (though filmed in Virginia).  I call the film 'little' because even though told in flashback from the memories of the now grown-up Bobby (David Morse) it is about just a little bit of the summer of his 11th birthday and we, the viewers, get to sneak a peek at that precious time in Bobby's life.The acting however, is anything but little.  Anton Yelchin is a seasoned actor, able to bring out the best of his role.  In direct comparison, Anton makes the acting abilities of Haley Joel Osment appear one-dimensional.  However, the role of Carol did not pale in comparison as Mika Booren was more than able to hold her own.  Add the grand acting abilities and screen presence of Anthony Hopkins (Ted Brautigan) and you have a cast of extraordinary artists helping to make this little movie into a very enjoyable film.  David Morse and Hope Davis (Bobby's mother) carry their roles equally well.If nothing else, one should consider purchasing the DVD for the interview of Anthony Hopkins by Scott Hicks.  Not only do you learn something about the changes made from King's original novel, but more importantly you get to hear Anthony Hopkins discuss his evolution as an actor and treasured little memories from his childhood all wrapped up with admiration for the youngsters starring in the film and presented with a genuine humility you just would not expect from this extraordinarily talented man.  I love him in everything he does, but I believe he brings a special charm and presence to his smaller more personable roles, such as in this film and in 'The Mask of Zorro'.I listened to the unabridged edition of Stephen King's original novel 'Hearts In Atlantis' narrated by William Hurt.  While certainly not my favorite King novel, it was a very, very good large tale told through five intertwined short stories.  That is really why the movie 'Hearts In Atlantis' seems little to me, because I recognize it as a little cherished piece of a larger, more comprehensive and detailed story, but it is an important and sweet little piece.Not about the war, not about college, not about the big world, just about Bobby-O's little world the last summer of his childhood.  About his loneliness, his self-absorbed mother, his dear childhood sweetheart Carol, and the wonderful bond he builds with Ted Brautigan, a father-figure sorely needed in Bobby's small bittersweet world, as well as a window through which Bobby catches a glimpse of a few harsher truths outside his 11-year-old world.Having read many of these reviews, I believe I have what appears to be quite a novel idea; why not treat yourself, don't be stingy with yourself, this situation doesn't call for an 'instead of' decision.

I noticed though that the style was very similar to how Green Mile was written &amp; made for film.  It's a flashback story, telling how the lead character (in this case, Bobby-o) met &amp; got involved with the 'supernatural' character (Ted Brautigan).  A drama with a touch of the 'supernaturals' to add some mystery.  However, the reference to the &quot;low men&quot; was so superficial that it did not leave any mark at all.  Maybe, that idea was more explained in the book.Whatever shortcomings the film had were tremendously offset by the acting of our lead characters.  As usual, Anthony Hopkins was great.  His subtle performance as an aging psychic leaves a lasting &amp; distinct mark.  Not to be outperformed were the child artists Anton Yelchin (Bobby) &amp; Mika Boorem (Carol) who were likewise exceptional.Overall, I found the movie satisfactory.

In much of his work, there is a nihilism, almost to the point of total despair, a feeling that good, if not quite nonexistent, is so weak or remote that it is utterly inconsequential. Here, good is a force to be reckoned with. Another difference, something that makes this stand out, is that the supernatural, though present, is only one of the forces that drive the story. The hunting of Ted, a boarder with mysterious powers, by the equally mysterious &quot;low men&quot; is less important that the relationship that develops between him and Bobby, a young boy desperately in need of, if not exactly a father figure, then of a wise and kindly grandfather. The self-absorbed mother and the child characters, particularly the girl Carol, are utterly believable and the sweet little romance, utterly innocent, is touching and real. Anthony Hopkins was wonderful as always, playing the role with a kind of wistful and humane sadness. As someone who was a child in the 1950's, let me tell you the makers of this film did a superb job recapturing the feel of that vanished world.

Bernabo,"[5, 7]","You can always tell the best movies adapted from Stephen King novels because the advertising for such films never trumpets the author's or puts his name over the title (the trailer points out this is from the author of ""The Green Mile,"" whoever he might be).  ""Hearts in Atlantis"" the film is essentially the first novella from ""Hearts in Atlantis"" the novel, and tells the story of the last summer of Bobby Garfield's childhood.  This is one of King's nostalgia stories, set in 1960 when Bobby (Anton Yelchin) has just turned 11 and been given a library card (an adult library card) by his mother (Hope Davis) instead of the new bike he really wants.  His mother launches into what is clearly a standard speech about how the death of his father years earlier left the family destitute, but we cannot help notice that she always has new dresses to wear.  Bobby has his best friend Sully (Will Rothhaar) and gal pal Carol (Mika Boorem) to fill the holes in his life, but then Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) moves into the upstairs apartment.Bobby and Ted become friends, although his mother is uneasy over their relationship from the start.  Ted hires Bobby to read him the newspaper each week and also asks him to look out for ""low men"" (low in the Dickensian sense).  Bobby dismisses this later task as some sort of private joke until he learns that there are indeed strange people after his friend.  This introduces the element of fear into Bobby's life, not only as he realizes that his friend might have to go away, but as he comes to understand that his selfish mother has no love to share with him.  Consequently the film moves back and forth between the sweetness of nostalgia, which reaches its highest point when Bobby and Carol share ""the kiss by which all others in your life will be judged,"" and the fear that Bobby's precarious world is going to crumble apart.  When this world does fall apart, in several different ways, Bobby does more that survive.  He grows up.""Hearts in Atlantis"" is a period piece, but the television being black & white and the cars having fins fades into the background as King investigates the eternal world of adolescence.  Ted has a strange gift, the reason why he is being sought out by the shadowy figures that arrive in town, but we keep pushing that out of the way because it only gets in the way of the relationship between Ted and Bobby.  Of course, having such a gift bears a price that becomes unavoidable.  Director Scott Hicks and cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski invest Bobby's neighborhood with a grandeur that we know is nothing more than the product of young mind's, who insist on seeing things better than they are.  The images are reinforced by William Goldman's literate script, which transforms King's story into poetry, and the actors are equal to the words in their performances.  The result is a lovely little intimate film.",4,The kiss by which all others in your life will be judged,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,2887,"['can', 'always', 'tell', 'best', 'movies', 'adapted', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'advertising', 'such', 'films', 'never', 'author', 'name', 'title', 'trailer', 'out', 'author', 'Green', 'Mile', 'might', 'be', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'film', 'essentially', 'first', 'novella', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'novel', 'story', 'last', 'summer', 'Bobby', 'Garfield', 'childhood', 'one', 'King', 'nostalgia', 'stories', 'set', '1960', 'when', 'Bobby', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'just', 'turned', '11', 'been', 'given', 'library', 'card', 'adult', 'library', 'card', 'mother', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'instead', 'new', 'bike', 'really', 'mother', 'what', 'clearly', 'standard', 'speech', 'how', 'death', 'father', 'years', 'earlier', 'left', 'family', 'destitute', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'notice', 'always', 'new', 'dresses', 'wear', 'Bobby', 'best', 'friend', 'Sully', 'Will', 'Rothhaar', 'gal', 'pal', 'Carol', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'fill', 'holes', 'life', 'then', 'Ted', 'Brautigan', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'upstairs', 'apartment.Bobby', 'Ted', 'become', 'friends', 'mother', 'uneasy', 'relationship', 'start', 'Ted', 'Bobby', 'read', 'newspaper', 'week', 'also', 'look', 'out', 'low', 'men', 'low', 'Dickensian', 'sense', 'Bobby', 'later', 'task', 'sort', 'private', 'joke', 'are', 'indeed', 'strange', 'people', 'friend', 'element', 'fear', 'Bobby', 'life', 'not', 'only', 'friend', 'might', 'have', 'go', 'away', 'understand', 'selfish', 'mother', 'love', 'share', 'Consequently', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'sweetness', 'nostalgia', 'highest', 'point', 'when', 'Bobby', 'Carol', 'share', 'kiss', 'others', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'fear', 'Bobby', 'precarious', 'world', 'going', 'crumble', 'apart', 'When', 'world', 'fall', 'apart', 'several', 'different', 'ways', 'Bobby', 'more', 'survive', 'up', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'period', 'piece', 'television', 'being', 'black', 'white', 'cars', 'having', 'fins', 'fades', 'background', 'King', 'eternal', 'world', 'adolescence', 'Ted', 'strange', 'gift', 'reason', 'why', 'being', 'sought', 'out', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'arrive', 'town', 'keep', 'pushing', 'way', 'only', 'way', 'relationship', 'Ted', 'Bobby', 'course', 'having', 'such', 'gift', 'price', 'unavoidable', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'cinematographer', 'Piotr', 'Sobocinski', 'invest', 'Bobby', 'neighborhood', 'grandeur', 'know', 'nothing', 'more', 'product', 'young', 'mind', 'who', 'insist', 'seeing', 'things', 'better', 'are', 'images', 'are', 'reinforced', 'William', 'Goldman', 'literate', 'script', 'King', 'story', 'poetry', 'actors', 'are', 'equal', 'words', 'performances', 'result', 'lovely', 'little', 'intimate', 'film']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)
685520,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00005UQ9V,Lawyeraau,"[34, 38]","Not having read the Stephen King book upon which this movie was based, I had no expectations of this film. In fact, after seeing the film, I was surprised that it had been based upon a Stephen King book, as it seemed so far removed from anything to do with horror, the supernatural, or science fiction. It also has nothing to do with the lost continent of Atlantis.The movie is, essentially, a coming of age film, and a particularly good one, at that. It opens with a middle aged man, Bobby Garfield (David Morse), returning home for the funeral of his childhood best friend. While there, he stops by his old home and begins reminiscing in his mind's eye, remembering growing up with those with whom he had lost touch, his now deceased friend and his first girl friend, Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem).The viewer then sees eleven year old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) living with his selfish, self absorbed, widowed mother, Liz Garfield (Hope Davis) in that very same house. A mysterious older man, loner Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins), takes up residence in an upstairs apartment in that house. He becomes a sort of a grandfather figure to Bobby, and a warm relationship develops between the two. Bobby gets from Ted what he is unable to get from his mother. Ted helps Bobby at a time in his life, when he sorely needed an interested adult, as his mother seems unable or unwilling to step up to home plate.Ted reveals to Bobby that some mysterious people, referred to only as the &quot;low men&quot; are after him. Ted enlists Bobby's aid in looking out for them. It also appears that Ted has some kind of extra sensory perception. It is a gift of which Bobby becomes aware, as Ted and Bobby begin to look out for each other. This apparent psychic ability, however, is not the focus of the movie and is somewhat incidental.The film  is simply an atmospheric, well rendered coming of age film, marked by nostalgia and the strong performances of its actors. Velvet voiced Anthony Hopkins is superb as the perceptive Ted Brautigan, giving yet another beautifully nuanced performance. Anton Yelchin is wonderfully natural in the role the young Bobby Garfield. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.The only thing that mars the film is the reference to the &quot;low men&quot;. At first, I thought it was to &quot;law men&quot; that Ted was referring. I found the use of the term &quot;low men&quot;, without some explanation, distracting. Since William Goldman had apparently made changes to the book when he wrote the screenplay, he should have excised this term, as it serves only to be distracting rather than mysterious, especially as the &quot;low men&quot; seemed likely to be simply some sort of secret government agents.The DVD provides the usual excellent sound and audio a viewer has come to expect from a high quality DVD.

I sure didn't expect to be bored, which I was, even though the acting was so good.  The film is set in a small town the late 1950s and Anthony Hopkins stars as a the stranger who moves in upstairs in the home of a single mother and her 11 year old son, played by Anton Yelchin.  The boy bonds with the older man, who seems to have some strange psychic power, and gets drawn into a mystery.  The boy's mother, played by Hope Davis is dumb and selfish and the boy really needs this father figure.  There's also a pretty little girlfriend of the boy, played by Mika Boorem.  All are well cast and do good jobs.Problem is that the story just couldn't hold my attention.  It's much too slow and obtuse.  And I felt almost no tension or curiosity as to how it would play out. There was a nostalgic musical score including such tunes as &quot;Sha Boom&quot;, &quot;Ain't That a Shame,&quot; and &quot;The Twist.&quot;  This music brought back memories for me but I found myself annoyed because the music spanned at least a five-year period and I wanted to be able to place the exact year.

I wish I hadn't waited so long.It's a nice simple story of childhood memories and it tells the story of Bobby Garfield who lives with his mom (his father has passed away).  Into their lives as a border, comes the mysterious Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins - who Oprah has even said that he can captivate her by simply reading the Yellow Pages).  He befriends Bobby and while this doesn't please Bobby's mother, it is good for him because he's lost his father.  Bobby comes to see that Ted has special powers.  The story goes on to show the two spending the summer together and with Bobby's friends Carol and Sully.I don't want to spoil this by sharing too much, but you should know that this is a nice film that is really adult Bobby's reflections of his past after he learns of a friends death.  I found it touching and sweet and very different to how I imagined.  Anthony Hopkins is such a brilliant actor and in fact all of the acting was done well by the entire cast.If you are looking for an innocent, moving movie, then try this.  It might be based on a Stephen King book, but it's not filled with any horror that some of his books contain.

In some respects, I wasn't disappointed.  Hearts In Atlantis has some tonalities in common with these other films (all of which are based upon Stephen King stories).  It comes closest in tone to Stand By Me, which is not surprising given that both films involve the coming of age of almost-teens.  It also has some similarities in tone to This Boy's Life (which, if you hate Leonardo DiCaprio, give him a second chance and watch This Boy's Life.  An awesome performance, I'm afraid.)And it is worth watching, if for no other reason than sheer sentimentality.  After all, who isn't waiting to be reminded of their first love, the first girl (in my case) who grabbed your heartstrings and brought you your first, deepest emotions (Barbara, if you're out there, I would have spoken to you about that if I had to do it all over again), your first adult mentor, and the hazy moments when you first developed a voice of your own.  Hearts In Atlantis has some success on this level.But, there are great disappointments.  The you lead actor, Anton Yelchin, just isn't up to the task.  He'd probably be better suited to doing commercials.  I can only imagine what Haley Joel Osment might have done with this role.  And Anthony Hopkins not only mumbles many of his lines, but he starts sounding like Hannibal Lecter--&quot;What do you see, Bobby/Clarice.&quot;  (Although that might be just me.  His performance in Silence of the Lambs kind of typecast him for me.)This is a sentimental tone poem--and one whose instruments are, admittedly, a little blunt.

685529,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005UQ9V,Matthew Horner,"[3, 3]","Hearts in Atlantis is a poignant and rather somber movie based on a book by Stephen King. This is not King, the master of horror, but King, the writer of psychological thrillers with splashes of the supernatural. Readers of the book should be warned that the movie eliminates all references to the main character's being an alien and changes him to a mere Earthling with psychic abilities. I think this was done to make the protagonist more accessible and plausible.Bobby [David Morse] is a successful photographer in his early fifties. One day he gets a FedEx package containing an old baseball glove. In this way he learns that one of his best childhood friends has died. He goes back to his hometown for the funeral. He visits his old house, now forlorn and abandoned, and begins to remember the summer he turned eleven years old.Young Bobby [Anton Yelchin] is a bright kid. His Dad died a few years ago. His relationship with his mother [Hope Davis] is tenuous because she isn't very happy. She doesn't make much money and blames the little family's circumstances on her dead husband, whom she claims was an irresponsible gambler. Bobby loves her, but she's hard to live with. The joys of his life are all outside his home and revolve around his best friends, Carol [Mika Boorem] and Sully [Will Rothhaar].His life begins to change when Ted [Anthony Hopkins] moves into the apartment upstairs. Ted is a warm man by nature, but life has thrown him some curves that make him a reluctant loner. He has an air of mystery around him. He makes most people uncomfortable, but Bobby is too young and open to be anything but fascinated by him. They develop a deep friendship, and Ted becomes a sort of father figure to Bobby. Ted thinks that a group of strange men are looking for him. At first, Bobby accepts this notion as just part of the man's eccentricity. Later, he wonders if Ted is crazy after all.While there are many good elements in Hearts of Atlantis, it is ultimately a rather slight movie. It doesn't have the depth or the fascination of some other movies based on this type of King book, such as Stand by Me and Delores Claiborne.I suspect that any weaknesses here come from the source material. Like most extremely prolific writers, King's work is not consistently strong.Scott Hicks is a gifted, thoughtful director, and I am sure he gave his best efforts to this project. You don't get any better than Anthony Hopkins, who could mesmerize an audience by reading a tax return. Davis, Yelchin, Boorem and Morse are first rate. Along with fine efforts by the technical crew, which provide a movie that's lovely to look at, as well as listen to, they give Hearts in Atlantis a polish and an entertainment value that far exceeds its merits as a story. In doing so, they have made it a decent and enjoyable movie.",4,Lovely but lightweight film,1015632000,"03 9, 2002",2002,2820,"['Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'poignant', 'rather', 'somber', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'King', 'master', 'horror', 'King', 'writer', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'splashes', 'supernatural', 'Readers', 'book', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'movie', 'references', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'alien', 'mere', 'Earthling', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'protagonist', 'more', 'accessible', 'plausible.Bobby', '[', 'David', 'Morse', ']', 'successful', 'photographer', 'early', 'fifties', 'One', 'day', 'FedEx', 'package', 'containing', 'old', 'baseball', 'glove', 'way', 'one', 'best', 'childhood', 'friends', 'died', 'back', 'hometown', 'funeral', 'old', 'house', 'now', 'forlorn', 'abandoned', 'remember', 'summer', 'turned', 'eleven', 'years', 'old.Young', 'Bobby', '[', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', ']', 'bright', 'kid', 'Dad', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'relationship', 'mother', '[', 'Hope', 'Davis', ']', 'tenuous', ""n't"", 'very', 'happy', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'money', 'little', 'family', 'circumstances', 'dead', 'husband', 'whom', 'was', 'irresponsible', 'gambler', 'Bobby', 'hard', 'live', 'joys', 'life', 'are', 'home', 'revolve', 'best', 'friends', 'Carol', '[', 'Mika', 'Boorem', ']', 'Sully', '[', 'Will', 'Rothhaar', ']', '.His', 'life', 'change', 'when', 'Ted', '[', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', ']', 'apartment', 'upstairs', 'Ted', 'warm', 'man', 'nature', 'life', 'thrown', 'curves', 'make', 'reluctant', 'loner', 'air', 'mystery', 'most', 'people', 'uncomfortable', 'Bobby', 'too', 'young', 'open', 'be', 'anything', 'fascinated', 'develop', 'deep', 'friendship', 'Ted', 'sort', 'father', 'figure', 'Bobby', 'Ted', 'group', 'strange', 'men', 'are', 'looking', 'first', 'Bobby', 'notion', 'just', 'part', 'man', 'eccentricity', 'Later', 'Ted', 'crazy', 'are', 'many', 'good', 'elements', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'ultimately', 'rather', 'slight', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'depth', 'fascination', 'other', 'movies', 'based', 'type', 'King', 'book', 'such', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Delores', 'Claiborne.I', 'suspect', 'weaknesses', 'here', 'come', 'source', 'material', 'most', 'extremely', 'prolific', 'writers', 'King', 'work', 'not', 'consistently', 'strong.Scott', 'Hicks', 'gifted', 'thoughtful', 'director', 'am', 'sure', 'gave', 'best', 'efforts', 'project', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'could', 'mesmerize', 'audience', 'reading', 'tax', 'return', 'Davis', 'Yelchin', 'Boorem', 'Morse', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'fine', 'efforts', 'technical', 'crew', 'provide', 'movie', 'lovely', 'look', 'as', 'well', 'listen', 'give', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'polish', 'entertainment', 'value', 'far', 'merits', 'story', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'made', 'decent', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

The movie doesn't fully explain who they are, but there are some indications that they are FBI men out to snare Ted Brautigan, whose psychic abilities are &quot;requested&quot; by J. Edgar Hoover.  Anthony Hopkins, always the professional, has some very tender moments, but much of the time he appears to be &quot;acting&quot; rather than filling the role.  However, again, his character's motivation is veiled and never fully explained, so Hopkins may not have felt he could do any more with it.  Hope Davis as Bobby's mother does a good job, but she is so consistent in her tone that we never fully understand what she goes through and whether she loves Bobby or not.  David Morse, who has worked in King material before (he was excellent in GREEN MILE), plays the adult Bobby, and even though he has few scenes, he is quite good in them.  The true stars of this movie, however, are Anton Yelchin and Mika Boorem as young Bobby and Carol.  Yelchin is so natural it's hard to believe he's acting; he doesn't try and say &quot;Hey look I'm a kid and I'm a good actor.&quot;  He just seems to inhabit Bobby's shoes, and does a remarkably good job.  Boorem as Carol is likewise down to earth and believable in her role as the young &quot;girlfriend&quot; of Bobby.  Their little love scene on the ferris wheel is as tender and realistic as any you'll see by mature adults.  Hicks does well in directing the young actors, and the camera work is evocative and plaintive.  However, at times it's like he's saying &quot;Remember me..I got nominated for an Oscar for directing &quot;Shine&quot;, so I have to be as artsy and esoteric as I can.&quot;Stephen King's track record for good movie adaptations of his novels has been hit and miss.

I found the book to be terrible; I found it to be one of King's worst efforts, and made me think that he should hang up his typewriter.Certainly, I don't expect a movie to play-out exactly as the book it is based upon. The Hearts in Atlantis movie bears very little resemblence to the book of the same title, and I find that to be a tremendous relief!The book tried, and failed, to give a story that was too profound, told with too little continuity, and never completely resolved. The movie relaxed its goals, but still ends up telling only a sketch of a story. The viewer is left to induce their own meaning into the few details given to them, and I just don't find that satisfying.So vague is this movie that I'm surprised an incredible cult hasn't sprung up around it. After all, its &quot;true meaining&quot; is subject to wide interpretation, but is certainly &quot;obvious&quot; to a few. Those few would be the leaders of the cult, and those who believe their interpretations would help convince and recruit more members, and so on.Much of the books content is missing from the movie, and that's an improvement as it helps the film focus on one set of characters in one time and place. But it does nothing to make the characters more interesting, the conflict more interesting, or the resolution more satisfying.Hopkins holds up a gang of B-list and fledgeling actors with a decent performance. But the rickety plot and ill-defined story are this movie's true failing.I appreciated the camera work in this film, as many of the scenes were carefully lit, beautifully composed, and exceptionally set.

Other times and places and the domain of a lost era stolen by the lurking boogey men, based on Stephen King's writings.No explosions. No nudity. No profanity.Unexpectedly sweet and touching, yet a bit haunting.The early nineteen sixties is the backdrop for this sleepy small town dealing with the issues of coming of age and the bittersweet journey of innocence that always slips away forever from our grasp.The supernatural and and the shadowy are featured in a strangely enchanting but reflective moodiness concerning a time gone by.This film is about the forgotten charms of ebbing childhood as much as it is about the mystical realm. It's a precious change from the junky trash entertainment out there.Quietly exceptional and worth repeated viewings with its wonderfully rich reflections of the early 1960's, including popular songs.Sadly all summers must end but its not so bad once you've had the best of all first kisses on a Ferris wheel.

But it has a good shot at Oscar nominations.I liked this movie-- liked it a lot. I almost gave it four stars because it does drag a bit at times. But I figure that a less frenetic pace for a film is fine, can even be a welcome change from the trend to fast, short cuts with lots of shots and scenes. This film takes a slower approach, and it produces a different feel-- one that helps take you back to the late fifties setting.But you may not like this if you are expecting something like 60 minutes or 15 seconds. Time feels different here, and that's not all that feels different. While there is no big &quot;magic&quot; or anything horrific in this story, like you'd find in something like Steven King's Carrie or IT, there is a subtly nuanced psi element that adds an occasional mirage-like shimmer to moments in the story. It is wonderfully acted and filmed.

Anthony Hopkins is mysterious, perhaps gifted or crazy, Ted Brautigan, a senior boarder at the home of a self-involved mother (Hope Davis)and her fatherless, sensitive boy (Anton Yelchin) on the brink of adolescence.The trailers, ads and box art do nothing to dispel the implication that this is a compelling supernatural tale, perhaps something as dramatically griping as ""Shawshank Redemption"" or ""The Green Mile."" It is not. Hopkins does his best with what he is given and kid actor Anton Yelchin holds his own in scenes they have together.Scott Hicks' (""Shine"") direction calls a lot of attention to itself and the irritating compositions that repeat ad nauseam multiple doorways or passageways within scenes.

This one in particular would have been better served with an original score rather than the classic 50's golden goldies. It comes across as cheesy. The story of a young boy coming of age rather quickly one fall in latter 1950's when he and his single, wayward mom take in a rather eccentric boarder, played deftly by Anthony Hopkins. The renter in turn becomes the boy's best friend and confidant. As this rather austere mystery unfolds, we learn this secretive, ellisive character is prone to lapses - pyshic window watching, if you will allow, that gives him a peek into the future - his own and those surrounding him. Seems he's on the run from FBI for his gift of vision. A weapon in the wrong hands; an insightful tool when shared. As the heat turns up, we know low men are closing in. A somewhat muddled affair, we are treated to glimpses of what makes childhood moments infinitely special, and the learning bonds that children can make with a total stranger in lieu of inadaquet parental participation.

Felton,"[1, 1]","I rented this movie some months ago, liked it a lot, then decided tolisten to the audio book (on the recommendation of Roger Ebert's review).I somehow got through 19 hours of listening, but I think reading the bookwould have been a much better idea. Last night I watched the movie again tocomplete the ""gestalt.""It's hard for me to understand quite a few of the comments I've readabout this movie. Some people seem to think that if a movie is based ona Stephen King novel it must be full of ""terror."" Others claim that thescreenplay does not do justice to the novel. My opinion is a big thumbs upfor ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" a very well done, touching movie, and thank God,almost no violence!One can only assume that when filmmakers decide to do a movie based ona novel they've got to make choices. Clearly with ""Hearts in Atlantis"" theychoose to focus on the ""coming of age"" of the main character, Bobby Garfield,who in the book is in the first and final sections. Thus the thrust of themovie is Bobby's maturation, specifically in his relationships with his Motherand girlfriend, and the huge transformation he undergoes after he bonds withthe mysterious psychic Ted Brautigan.So while it can be claimed that the movie doesn't follow the book(I think it does), I was very moved by the outstanding performances ofAnthony Hopkins and the 2 child actors, and I feel that the depiction oftheir relationships and growth are superb. Even the elderly Brautigancharacter is transformed, which he admits when he is being taken away bythe low men in his final moments in the movie - he shouts from the car to Bobbythat he wouldn't have missed a moment of their relationship. To me the success of adrama is judged precisely in the interactions and transformations of the characters,and on this criterion ""Hearts in Atlantis"" easily gets an A from me. And I givethe moviemakers a lot of credit, because, as another reviewer noted, many pagesof the book are often portrayed very well in just a few seconds in the movie.Indeed the psychic aspect of Brautigan's character, and who he really is,is not done as well as in the book, but to me this is a relatively minor issue.I want to ""give away"" that the title of the movie has really nothing to do withthe movie's plot. In the book we learn that ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is about anothercharacter who goes to college, gets addicted to playing Hearts with his dormmates,who also listen to the ""overly idealistic"" song ""Atlantis"" by Donovan (from thelate '60's). One final comment - if you had any interest in the movie, please getthe book and read the last few pages, for the ending in the book is much betterthan the ending in the movie.

The film begins in 2001 (The year the film was made) we are quickly introduced to a character named Bobby (played as an adult by David Morse) Bobby begins to recollect memories from his past, memories from his eleventh birthday and spending time with his friends in the summer. Including the memory of a mysterious individual named Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins)Ted Brautigan moves in next door to Bobby's house (played at the age of 11 by, Anthon Yelchin) Bobby lives with his mom only, his father is rarely mentioned. Bobby begins to find a father figure in Ted...but there is a special gift that Ted has inside. I will not give more details as to what happens. The only thing about the film that bothered me a little was the pace; it can be a little slow and sad in some points. Though I also don't understand why this film received a PG-13 rating.

He is so real and the film is so well directed, you quickly forget you're watching a film and soon become a voyeur in the lives of Ted Brautigan (Hopkins) and 11-year-old Bobby Garfield, who find themselves as neighbors and fast friends.Young Bobby Garfield (superbly acted by Anton Yelchin) lives with his widowed mother, who is a bitter, self-absorbed and very selfish woman.  She has her own car and is constantly buying herself new dresses, but the only gift she has for her son on his birthday is a free public library card.  He is forced to ride on the handlebars of his girlfriend's bike as the two youngsters bond through difficult circumstances.It's the early 60s... post McCarthy era and during the Cold War... and the &quot;low men,&quot; assumingly government agents, are seeking Ted for his uncanny gift of reading the hearts of people and seeing things before they happen.  While Ted could obviously make a financial killing by placing bets on races he all-too-well knows the outcome of, but we see him do this only once, out of desparation, to be able to skip town to avoid the &quot;low men.&quot;  He otherwise lives in obscurity and in very modest means.Ted's failing eyesight has him &quot;employing&quot; young Bobby to read the newspaper to him and to keep his eyes out for the &quot;Low men.&quot; In return, Ted tutors Bobby and treats him with respect and as a true friend.A father-son relationship soon develops that Bobby's mother is intensely jealous and suspicious of.Bobby is torn... do the &quot;low men&quot; really exist? When he sees signs that they might... does he warn Ted, thereby having Ted flee the town and be out of Bobby's life forever, or does he keep it to himself and hope it all just goes away.Ted is a kind spirit... much like the literary Christ-figures so popular in the &quot;mainstream&quot; Stephen King films such as &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;  The emotional bond between Bobby and Ted brings you in and you feel like you are a part of the bond.Many of the scenes are too long and/or too intense for very young viewers, but the PG-13 rating is appropriate. My only regret is that there are no &quot;behind the scenes&quot; clips or interviews w/ the cast on this disc.

685563,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005UQ9V,Stephen A. Haines,"[3, 6]","Although not a Stephen King fan, the name &quot;Anthony Hopkins&quot; on a DVD label always chains my eye.  Hopkins' ability to impart many facets to a character always makes watching him work a keen pleasure.  It's disheartening, however, to watch a superiour talent squandered on a weak plot.  Hopkins strains to cast off King's sparse characterisations, very  nearly succeeding.  Hicks and his cinemetographer also struggle to impart life into the otherwise narrow roles.  King's insistence on portraying life as if we all lived in a dark Bedlam limits their options.  The result is a sequence of tight focus, either through narrow apertures or as mirror reflections, on people and events.  Given the plot restrictions, there's little else they could do.  It makes for grand visual dramatics, but leaves little scope for the cast to maneuvre.  Even a county fair is squeezed into a shill's booth and a Ferris wheel seat.Hopkins, in a supporting role to young Anton Yelchin, is a fugitive.  The parable of the kindly old surrogate father with special talents is so hoary it bears whiskers.  In this case the &quot;special talent&quot; is that of a psychic with wide-ranging capabilities.  Hopkins, as Ted Brautigan, doesn't want to fall again under the clutches of anti-communist J. Edgar Hoover's minions.  They're &quot;low men&quot;.  He enlists bobby [Yelchin], an 11-year old in a mid-sized Connecticut town, to keep nit.  The &quot;low men&quot; will put up posters on telephone poles [in the name of reason, why??], wear dark suits and drive flash cars.  No stereotyping, here, folks!  Yelchin, feeling the first stirrings of testosterone, is caught between lusts - his neighbour Carol and the bicycle in a shop window.  Of course, Bobby and Carol are victimized by the local bullies.  And, of course, Hopkins . . .  whell, you work it out.Child actors like Anton Yelchin are enigmas.  If you can't get the little buggers to brush their teeth or go to bed on time, how do you get them to take direction in front of a camera? Especially in a film with all those intense close-ups?  In the Special Features with this film, Hopkins and Hicks laud Yelchin for his &quot;natural talent&quot;.  It's not a contestable point. Whatever Yelchin is to his mum and schoolmates, he's outstanding here.  He exhibits no outsized affectations - he appears fully natural.  His moods reflect his [too rapidly] growing awareness of the adult world's complexities and disillusionments.  As he gropes with these challenges, he matures, but not beyond reasonable bounds.  It will be interesting to see what else he achieves.  Good fortune will keep him away from further Stephen King enterprises.  Perhaps something with Harrison Ford would hone his skills.

Sweeping a path, carrying water and even cooking a simple meal can bring a sense of wonder.  The true beauty lies in their execution.  This movie is a lot like that.There is nothing new in Hearts in Atlantis.  We've all seen the coming of age story done before.  The first kiss on the Ferris wheel, lazy summer afternoons spent with friends in the huge, cool forests that seemed to shrink down to small groves of trees in our adulthood.  They're all there.  The mother who doesn't understand and won't listen? She's there too.  What about the older man that not only remembers what it's like to be a kid, but seems to know the young hero better than he knows himself?  Yep, him too.The bicycle that must be earned and the bully that must be fought and conquered are present,  along with the loss of innocence and journey to understanding of the parent.  Everything you expect to be there is there, but there's more.For those that haven't read the book (or seen the film yet) I won't spoil anything here, but Ted isn't quite what he seems.  It's a twist that could have been added and dominated the film, but doesn't. Ted is what he is and it is a part of the story, but not the biggest part.  The greatest achievement here is the melding of everything we've seen before into a film that is greater than the sum of it's cliches.Anthony Hopkins wonderfully underplays his role here.

The engaging supernatural premise of ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is left at the door as Hicks takes a lugubrious detour into memoir.  The central problem here is the story. It made sense alongside the others in Stephen King's book, but here, deprived of its context and ultimate meaning, it just doesn't play. It looks, sounds and feels like a film that should have you crying, and gives you everything but a reason to. Hopkins still manages to be excellent as Ted Brautigan, Anton Yelchin is superb as the young Bobby, and Hicks does evoke the period extremely well. But in the end there's something missing at the heart of it all - a point.  The film can't seem to decide if it's a coming-of-age drama or a supernatural thriller, and settles for being neither.  So when Brautigan cries out at the climax, ""I wouldn't have missed a minute of it, not for all the world..."" the audience is left wondering what he's talking about.  There's a lesson here in the adaptation of Stephen King's stories: if you're going to tone down the violence or the supernatural elements on which his stories hinge, you need to replace them with something else.

However, I don't think that was the case here.This movie starts off really great.  It has a great cast of characters, a nice little feel about it, and the story starts off intriguing.  A strange man shows up this family's house, and befriends the kids.  However, there's more to him than meets the eye.  He has some sort of unusual powers, and he has these premonitions that someone's coming after him.  A plot seems to be lain out, and the story gets interesting.  But......Just as the movie hooks you, it suddenly ends abruptly.  This movie has NO END whatsoever!  The story does not go anywhere at all, and at the end you're left with more questions than answers.  With an actual end, this could have been a great movie.  The kids are very likable, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, does a great job.  But, does anything else think he still had some residual creepiness left over from &quot;Hannibal&quot;?  He's supposed to be a friendly, good-natured guy, but in some places he's creepy for no reason.

In Hearts in Atlantis, I couldn't get past how unrealistic the lines of dialog assigned to the children were.  They spoke and acted with a maturity that is way beyond their tender ages of eleven, and it didn't seem natural.  It ruined the movie for me.  I kept thinking ""real people don't speak and act this way.""  The plot just dragged along, and I kept waiting for the movie to ""start.""  And then it was over.

Portions of the film are quite faithful to the novel, but much of the nuance of King's excellent novel is lost in the translation to the screen.Still, when considered on its own merits, the film is really quite good.  The child actors are very believable, and the interplay between Anthony Hopkins' enigmatic telepath and the children is really quite subtle and very touching.  Hope Davis also plays the main character's tortured, conflicted mother tragically and convincingly.Unlike Green Mile or Shawshank, the film does not end with a &quot;wow&quot; moment.  The film is much more intimate and subtle than either of these other King adaptations, and that is the beauty of it.

685577,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005UQ9V,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","How to evaluate this film means, ultimately, how to bring the novels of Stephen King onto a big screen.  In other words, to make the argument short, to ask you what part of King's hugely popular books exactly attract millions of readers.  The answer is simple to me: his incredible gift of storytelling.  Which, sadly, is totally missing here.The film version of ""Heart in Atlantis"" covers only the first part of the original book, but it still feels to be running pretty long.  This means, we sense a kind of lack of King's knack for grabbing the audience's hearts, and of the heart of the film itself.  The coming-of-age tale about a boy Bobby (Yelchin) living in the year of 1960 goes on in no steady course, getting interesting by fits and starts, first diving into  a flashback scene of a newly moved tenant Ted (always good Hopkins) and Bobby's rather self-centered mother (as well good Hope Davis).  Bobby soon finds a father figure in mysterious but kind Ted, to establish a friendship with him, while Ted is afraid of being spotted by ""THEY"" who want his unusual ability.Thus we see the Bobby's growing pains, but too many episodes seem to be thrown into the course, in a disjointed and fragmentary way.  One instance would illustrate my point.  Bobby's mother Liz has a date with a guy who she thinks is her future, only to be sexaully abused in a hotel room.  At the same time (and virtually, simultaneously on the screen) Bobby's girlfriend Carol is also abused (sexually perhaps) by one of the local bullies, receiving a shcokingly brutal hitting from his baseball bat.  AND, when dismayed Mother Liz came back home, she finds Ted nursing wounded Carol, and instantly jumps to conclusion that HE is unashamedly molesting the girl (or, including Bobby, the children) under the roof of her own house.  Maybe, King's fluent pen would get away with this incredible coincidence, but not Scott Hicks, whose previous films ""Shine"" and ""Snow Falling on Ciders"" are, though both a good work with  its own merit, not distinguished works of a good storyteller.In addition, we have anecdotes on supernatural power; we have secret organization; we  have metaphorical story about American football.  To make matters more complicated, the story starts with a flashback, with adult Ted (David Morse), in a ""Stand By Me"" fashion.  Like the town of Castlerock, King's favorite theme would turn up here and there, but without making themselves organized in a coherent way, giving us impressions as if we were watching bits of some other King adaptations such as ""The Green Mile.""  In his stories, it causes no problem, with his speedy development of situations, his books being real page-turner.  But on the screen, everything simply drags.These complaints aside, the film turns out fairly successeful, largely owing to good acting of the able cast.  No need to mention Anthony Hopkins, I believe, but the real find here is Mika Boorem (""The Patriot"" of Mel Gibson, and ""Along Came a Spider"") who plays the role of young Carol.  She, with her beauty, gives a believable figure of a girl who is apparently strong, but inwardly very sensitive.  Though a mixed bag, ""Hearts in Atlantis"" should be called good all in all, and also note that without the script William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"") gave, the film could have been less effective.",3,Worth a Look: Fair Adaptaion of Stephen King's Novel,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",2002,3351,"['How', 'evaluate', 'film', 'ultimately', 'how', 'bring', 'novels', 'Stephen', 'King', 'big', 'screen', 'other', 'words', 'make', 'argument', 'short', 'ask', 'what', 'part', 'King', 'hugely', 'popular', 'books', 'exactly', 'attract', 'millions', 'readers', 'answer', 'simple', 'incredible', 'gift', 'storytelling', 'Which', 'sadly', 'totally', 'missing', 'here.The', 'film', 'version', 'Heart', 'Atlantis', 'only', 'first', 'part', 'original', 'book', 'still', 'be', 'running', 'pretty', 'long', 'sense', 'kind', 'lack', 'King', 'knack', 'grabbing', 'audience', 'hearts', 'heart', 'film', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', 'boy', 'Bobby', 'Yelchin', 'living', 'year', '1960', 'steady', 'course', 'getting', 'interesting', 'fits', 'starts', 'first', 'diving', 'flashback', 'scene', 'newly', 'moved', 'tenant', 'Ted', 'always', 'good', 'Hopkins', 'Bobby', 'rather', 'self-centered', 'mother', 'well', 'good', 'Hope', 'Davis', 'Bobby', 'soon', 'father', 'figure', 'mysterious', 'kind', 'Ted', 'establish', 'friendship', 'Ted', 'afraid', 'being', 'spotted', 'THEY', 'who', 'want', 'unusual', 'ability.Thus', 'see', 'Bobby', 'growing', 'pains', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'seem', 'be', 'thrown', 'course', 'disjointed', 'fragmentary', 'way', 'One', 'instance', 'would', 'illustrate', 'point', 'Bobby', 'mother', 'Liz', 'date', 'guy', 'who', 'future', 'only', 'be', 'sexaully', 'abused', 'hotel', 'room', 'same', 'time', 'virtually', 'simultaneously', 'screen', 'Bobby', 'girlfriend', 'Carol', 'also', 'abused', 'sexually', 'perhaps', 'one', 'local', 'bullies', 'receiving', 'shcokingly', 'brutal', 'hitting', 'baseball', 'bat', 'when', 'dismayed', 'Mother', 'Liz', 'came', 'back', 'home', 'Ted', 'nursing', 'wounded', 'Carol', 'instantly', 'jumps', 'conclusion', 'HE', 'unashamedly', 'molesting', 'girl', 'including', 'Bobby', 'children', 'roof', 'own', 'house', 'Maybe', 'King', 'fluent', 'pen', 'would', 'get', 'away', 'incredible', 'coincidence', 'not', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'previous', 'films', 'Shine', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Ciders', 'are', 'good', 'work', 'own', 'merit', 'not', 'distinguished', 'works', 'good', 'storyteller.In', 'addition', 'have', 'anecdotes', 'supernatural', 'power', 'have', 'secret', 'organization', 'have', 'metaphorical', 'story', 'American', 'football', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'complicated', 'story', 'flashback', 'adult', 'Ted', 'David', 'Morse', 'Stand', 'Me', 'fashion', 'town', 'Castlerock', 'King', 'favorite', 'theme', 'would', 'turn', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'making', 'organized', 'coherent', 'way', 'giving', 'impressions', 'were', 'watching', 'bits', 'other', 'King', 'adaptations', 'such', 'Green', 'Mile', 'stories', 'problem', 'speedy', 'development', 'situations', 'books', 'being', 'real', 'page-turner', 'screen', 'everything', 'simply', 'drags.These', 'complaints', 'aside', 'film', 'out', 'fairly', 'successeful', 'largely', 'owing', 'good', 'acting', 'able', 'cast', 'No', 'need', 'mention', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'believe', 'real', 'find', 'here', 'Mika', 'Boorem', 'Patriot', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Along', 'Came', 'Spider', 'who', 'role', 'young', 'Carol', 'beauty', 'believable', 'figure', 'girl', 'who', 'apparently', 'strong', 'inwardly', 'very', 'sensitive', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'good', 'also', 'note', 'script', 'William', 'Goldman', 'Butch', 'Cassidy', 'Sundance', 'Kid', 'gave', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'effective']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)

Nostalgia to what I'm not really sure. To the time in which the movie takes place? Not really, the movie took place way before my time and in a country I have been to.It's probably the nostalgia connected with childhood in general, and the inevitable loss of it, that is so typical in a good Stephen King story.Like ""Stand by be"", ""Christine"" and ""It"", ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is more about childhood and coming of age than anything else. Instant-likable characters (so characteristic for King), the growing relationships between them and finally the horror from outside that wants to destroy the group so it can get to the individuals.The threat is all the more omnipresent because King manages to make us part of the relationship, and part of the group.We walk along with the for kids in ""Stand by me"", sharing their joys and fears and late-night camp fire stories. We share the feeling of being a loner and a looser as the kids are in ""It"", but we also join in and hold hands with them when they find each other. Together they are strong, and as a group, working, feeling and thinking together, they might fight of the evil and defeat the darkness.The transformation from individual to group is the key element in these stories, without it, the entire story would fail. But Stephen King always finds ways to make characters come close to each others. They share each others fears and secrets, their lonelyness, their seperation from their parents who cannot or will not understand the longings and wanderings of their kids.In ""Heart in Atlantis"" a boy, Bobby, whose mother is more occupied with her own little worries, befriends an elderly man. Because he lacks parental warmth Bobby feels attracted to the mysterious man as if he was his father (who wouldn't when this man is a mirror image of Anthony Hopkins).Next to this man is a young girl on whom he has a crush. Of course for a kid this relationship is more healthier than that with the old man and there are signs that the latter is in some sort of trouble. ""Lowmen"" are roaming the countryside in search for him. Not much detail is layed out here; we have to guess, we have to ponder, but who ever they are, and what ever the connection is between them and Bobby's surrogate father, they slowely close in for the kill.Caught (and lost) in between emotions, Bobby has to learn quickly to understand these new frightning sensations and is more and more forced to think and act like an adult.When the mother is away on business, the relationship with the strange but very appealing man grows tight, but everytime we see Hopkins' estranged gaze when he sences the ""lower men"" closing in on him, we slowly realize that this will not have a happy end. This is no spoiler however, because this multi-layered story has more endings, and not all of them are sad.The actual story provided here is rather thin and the movie is deliberatly paced, but it gives the two main characters all the more chance to get to know each other just as the audience has a chance to get to know the charcters. Hopkins hits all the right notes being both fatherly warm and yet, keeping a little distance all the time, like a real father who knows that some day the kid has to ""leave the nest"" and has to fly out into the world all by himself.That's what parenthood is all about and consequently, this movie too.",4,This Atlantis has a heart in the right place,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,3462,"['Watching', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'gave', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'end', 'was', 'filled', 'warmth', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'Nostalgia', 'what', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'time', 'movie', 'place', 'Not', 'really', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'way', 'time', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'probably', 'nostalgia', 'connected', 'childhood', 'general', 'inevitable', 'loss', 'so', 'typical', 'good', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Stand', 'be', 'Christine', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'more', 'childhood', 'coming', 'age', 'anything', 'else', 'Instant-likable', 'characters', 'so', 'characteristic', 'King', 'growing', 'relationships', 'finally', 'horror', 'destroy', 'group', 'can', 'get', 'individuals.The', 'threat', 'more', 'omnipresent', 'King', 'manages', 'make', 'part', 'relationship', 'part', 'group.We', 'walk', 'kids', 'Stand', 'sharing', 'joys', 'fears', 'late-night', 'camp', 'fire', 'stories', 'share', 'feeling', 'being', 'loner', 'looser', 'kids', 'are', 'also', 'join', 'hold', 'hands', 'when', 'find', 'other', 'are', 'strong', 'group', 'working', 'feeling', 'thinking', 'together', 'might', 'fight', 'evil', 'defeat', 'darkness.The', 'transformation', 'individual', 'group', 'key', 'element', 'stories', 'entire', 'story', 'would', 'fail', 'Stephen', 'King', 'always', 'ways', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'close', 'others', 'share', 'others', 'fears', 'secrets', 'lonelyness', 'seperation', 'parents', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'longings', 'wanderings', 'kids.In', 'Heart', 'Atlantis', 'boy', 'Bobby', 'mother', 'more', 'occupied', 'own', 'little', 'worries', 'elderly', 'man', 'parental', 'warmth', 'Bobby', 'feels', 'attracted', 'mysterious', 'man', 'was', 'father', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'when', 'man', 'mirror', 'image', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', '.Next', 'man', 'young', 'girl', 'whom', 'crush', 'course', 'kid', 'relationship', 'more', 'healthier', 'old', 'man', 'are', 'signs', 'latter', 'sort', 'trouble', 'Lowmen', 'are', 'roaming', 'countryside', 'search', 'Not', 'much', 'detail', 'layed', 'out', 'here', 'have', 'guess', 'have', 'ponder', 'who', 'ever', 'are', 'what', 'ever', 'connection', 'Bobby', 'surrogate', 'father', 'slowely', 'close', 'kill.Caught', 'lost', 'emotions', 'Bobby', 'learn', 'quickly', 'understand', 'new', 'frightning', 'sensations', 'more', 'more', 'forced', 'think', 'act', 'adult.When', 'mother', 'away', 'business', 'relationship', 'strange', 'very', 'appealing', 'man', 'tight', 'see', 'Hopkins', 'estranged', 'gaze', 'when', 'lower', 'men', 'closing', 'slowly', 'realize', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'happy', 'end', 'spoiler', 'however', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'more', 'endings', 'not', 'are', 'sad.The', 'actual', 'story', 'provided', 'here', 'rather', 'thin', 'movie', 'deliberatly', 'paced', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'just', 'audience', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'charcters', 'hits', 'right', 'notes', 'being', 'fatherly', 'warm', 'yet', 'keeping', 'little', 'distance', 'time', 'real', 'father', 'who', 'day', 'kid', 'leave', 'nest', 'fly', 'out', 'world', 'what', 'parenthood', 'consequently', 'movie', 'too']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)
685580,AP3B615GM191G,B00005UQ9V,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 1]","At face value, this is a decent film.  The relationship between Bobby Garfield and Carol Gerber (a brilliant performance from Mika Boreem)) is the centerpiece of the film, and will really tug at your heartstrings as the film comes to a close.  Also, the eccentric Ted Brautigan is perfectly cast in Anthony Hopkins, while Bobby's mother Liz Garfield adds a dark aspect.  So, all in all, the film is a decent little story that, while never really resolving itself fully, does capture your interest and really make you feel for the protagonists.However, titling the film ""Hearts in Atlantis"" in trying to capture the essence of Stephen King's masterful novel was an injustice to King's original story, which tells 5-6 different stories and weaves recurring characters into each.  In fact, the ""Hearts"" in the title of King's book is actually a play on words for the card game that Carol Gerber's college friends play relentlessly, day and night.Thus, this film really should have been called ""Low Men In Yellow Coats"", as that is the King tale that really is being told.  Even if that would have happened, though, I think that telling this singular tale does a great injustice to King's great novel.  Whereas in the book the story just sets the stage for the drama to come, the film tries its best to inject that drama into only the one story, which is sad.  A great attempt is made to do so, but ultimately it will leave you wanting, as it seems (for much of the film) that it is building towards a bigger resolution that never comes.If you read the book, I wouldn't spend too much time/effort acquiring this film, as it doesn't come close to equaling the success of the original novel.  However, if you didn't read the book and are a sucker for a good love story, you very well may like this movie much more than I.",3,Title A Misnomer As It Only Focuses On One Book Story,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1815,"['face', 'value', 'decent', 'film', 'relationship', 'Bobby', 'Garfield', 'Carol', 'Gerber', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Mika', 'Boreem', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'film', 'close', 'Also', 'eccentric', 'Ted', 'Brautigan', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Bobby', 'mother', 'Liz', 'Garfield', 'dark', 'aspect', 'So', 'film', 'decent', 'little', 'story', 'never', 'really', 'resolving', 'fully', 'capture', 'interest', 'really', 'make', 'feel', 'protagonists.However', 'titling', 'film', 'Atlantis', 'trying', 'capture', 'essence', 'Stephen', 'King', 'masterful', 'novel', 'was', 'injustice', 'King', 'original', 'story', '5-6', 'different', 'stories', 'weaves', 'recurring', 'characters', 'fact', 'Hearts', 'title', 'King', 'book', 'actually', 'play', 'words', 'card', 'game', 'Carol', 'Gerber', 'college', 'friends', 'play', 'relentlessly', 'day', 'night.Thus', 'film', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Low', 'Men', 'Yellow', 'Coats', 'King', 'tale', 'really', 'being', 'told', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'think', 'telling', 'singular', 'tale', 'great', 'injustice', 'King', 'great', 'novel', 'Whereas', 'book', 'story', 'just', 'stage', 'drama', 'come', 'film', 'best', 'inject', 'drama', 'only', 'one', 'story', 'sad', 'great', 'attempt', 'made', 'do', 'so', 'ultimately', 'will', 'leave', 'wanting', 'much', 'film', 'building', 'towards', 'bigger', 'resolution', 'never', 'comes.If', 'read', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time/effort', 'acquiring', 'film', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'equaling', 'success', 'original', 'novel', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'are', 'sucker', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'may', 'like', 'movie', 'much', 'more']",HEARTS IN ATLANTIS (DVD)
