He's been replaced by some other guy that acts just LIKE him in every single (sometimes annoying) way.Alright, you probably know what to expect- a bunch of teenagers (and one older man who's the main character) all get together to form a rock band.  They start performing at high school proms, get famous, have amazingly insane adventures along the way, and.... that's the main problem with the movie.  It was VERY predictable storyline-wise.Everything that happens in real life to rock bands about how they start drinking heavily, doing drugs, getting chicks, and party the night away happens to the fictional band in this movie.  It's nothing new- you KNOW exactly what to expect.  It's been done before in other movies (such as that one Jack Black one about the guitar) and it's been done in real life thousands of times across the world.At least some of the acting was decent, some of the jokes were pretty good, and the story was told nicely with a heavy focus on the fact that the oldest member of the band was 20 years older than the other band members (and how he got kicked out of his previous band 20 years before).

1184872,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001E95ZHY,Chris Pandolfi,"[14, 19]","""The Rocker"" is a surprisingly enjoyable movie, with engaging performances, jokes that are suited for the material, and a fairly solid premise. I was consistently interested in what was going on, and I actually cared about the characters. In a sense, it's like a sports movie, in which we root for the heroes to fight the good fight and emerge victorious. I'm hard pressed to say it was any better than it wanted to be, however. Had this story been told dramatically, it probably would have been much more powerful; the rise to fame is not without its turmoil, especially when the celebrities are teenagers. The idea of an adult drummer leading a teenage rock band from the garage to the arena is full of emotionally charged possibilities. Many of them weren't explored because ""The Rocker"" was made as a comedy. But that's okay. It still works.The story begins in 1986, just as a popular heavy metal band called Vesuvias finishes a gig in Cleveland. Despite their success, the drummer, Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson), is unceremoniously kicked out of the band. He swears that he'll make it no matter what, but when we flash forward twenty years, it's clear that things haven't worked out as planned; Fish spends his days doing the tasks of a soul-crushing desk job. When he's fired for unruly behavior (namely attacking a coworker for playing the new Vesuvias album), he's forced to leave his apartment and move in with his disapproving sister, Lisa (Jane Lynch), her thrill-seeking husband, Stan (Jeff Garlin), and their quarrelsome children, Violet (Samantha Weinstein) and Matt (Josh Gad). Matt and his high school friends Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger) have formed a rock band called A.D.D.; after weeks of trying, they will finally have their first gig at the prom.But there's a problem: the drummer was suspended from school and grounded by his mother. With little resources available, and with only one day to go until the gig, Matt asks Fish if he would be willing to once again pick up his drumsticks. Fish accepts, and when prom night arrives, everything goes smoothly. At least, it does at first; things go wrong when Fish ruins A.D.D.'s rendition of Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes."" When the smoke clears, everyone decides to give Fish another chance, but only if he can get them another gig. Then comes the night all four members practice with each other via webcams--Fish, not realizing the device on his laptop is a camera and not a microphone, sits completely naked at his drum set. ""Hello, YouTube,"" says Violet maliciously, watches everything on her computer.Before anyone knows it, the video known as ""The Naked Drummer"" is an Internet sensation. It isn't long before a scummy L.A. agent named David Marshall (Jason Sudeikis) enters with promises of fame and fortune. Thus begins A.D.D.'s Midwest tour, in which they open for other various bands. Hopefully, this will pave the way to more serious venues, maybe even their first solo gig. Of course, nothing like this can happen without some trouble along the way; Fish, hoping to loosen up the other members, encourages reckless behavior, like destroying hotel rooms and attending wild parties (by some miracle, the issue of alcohol never comes up). While all the parents recognize that Fish is a bad influence, Curtis' mother, Kim (Christina Applegate), believes that the kids should follow their hearts. She volunteers to stay with the band for the rest of the tour to keep an eye on things.At a certain point in the film, Fish is faced with a very tough decision. I won't reveal what it is, but I will say it creates the first real rift between him and the rest of the band. The question is raised: Was Fish always meant for a life of rock and roll, or is he just a sloppy, irresponsible dreamer that refuses to grow up? One could ask the same thing about most music superstars, which is why it's almost impossible to get an answer. Some are famous because they got lucky while other have actual talent. It seems that everyone in A.D.D. is talented enough: Fish certainly knows his way around a drum set; Amelia's good with a guitar, and Matt can really work a synthesizer; Curtis is a natural songwriter, although one wonders if he'll ever get past his abandonment issues. His father left him when he was only four, and he's been brooding about it ever since.If this movie is, in fact, giving us a message, then it's probably the most obvious one we can think of: we have to do what we love and not let anyone stand in the way. We're also told about sticking together no matter what, since a band is essentially like a family. In this case, it's a family that doesn't want to ""grow up""; they want to eat, breathe, and sleep music without becoming corporate-run zombies that sit behind desks staring at computer screens. Fish suffered that fate for twenty years, making a living but not being alive. All he wanted was to have a good time, and he finds that passion once again helping his nephew's band. The movie itself shares that same passion for fun, which is a nice change from some of the raunchier immature comedies released over the past couple of months (""Step Brothers"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"" come to mind). ""The Rocker"" is funny without being excessive, and it actually tells us a story we can believe in. While it wasn't made as a drama, there are moments that are a bit more thoughtful in their approach. The fact that the filmmakers knew when to let the humor simmer down tells me they took their work seriously.",4,Let the Music Play,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,5517,"['Rocker', 'surprisingly',

This is not a heavy metal movie; anyone that expects that would be sorely disappointed. Come on, Rainn Wilson as a drummer in a rock band, and somebody expects that to be a heavy metal movie? It's not ""This is Spinal Tap"" by a long margin. It's not ""Almost Famous."" It's one of those silly movies where the geek kids conquer the world.

Amelia (Emma Stone) never learned how to play the bass, sing, or really move like somebody in a band. So she is forgettable during the band performances. However, she is a decent actress and does well the rest of the time. The others look reasonably good during band performances.The movie is decent funny for a Saturday or Friday night of escapism. It's kind of a guy film (you know Stooges humor). It's PG-13, on the rough side of PG-13. Rainn Wilson is naked or in his underwear quite a bit. There's some rough language.

By and large they're anti-authority, eccentric, immature partay animals; but a good drummer can hold a band together like super glue.  And into this quirky realm enters Rainn Wilson as Robert Fishman (Fish)--the original drummer of legendary rock band Vesuvius, which summarily dumped him 20 years before as the band was entering its heyday.  Fish has a grudge, he detests normal things like. . .working. . .and he never wants to grow up.  So when his high school nephew (Josh Gad) appeals to Fish to bail out the nephew's band by playing the drums for the prom, Fish agrees, then readily gets bit by the rock 'n roll bug.  Subsequently a sight gag (not pleasant to watch) gets on YouTube, the band (named ADD) gets a following, then a sleazy agent (Jason Sudeikis), then goes on tour--and THE ROCKER takes off as a vehicle for Wilson's irreverent antics.With a predictable plot and ADD's maddening bubblegum music and lyrics, I still got a hoot watching Wilson dominate scene after scene.  This guy really has a knack for physical comedy, and enough facial expressions to form his own area code.  He's often over the top, but it's needed to offset his surprisingly stoic and composed fellow band members (Gad, Teddy Geiger, Emma Stone), and a traveling band mom (Christina Applegate is gorgeous).  I really got a kick out of Will Arnett and Bradley Cooper playing self-absorbed, perpetually stoned, Vesuvius front men, and it's great to see Howard Hesseman still commanding a pulse.

But against all expectations, not only did I get through the movie, but it was pretty good. Granted, it is a bit formulamatic, predictable, and some of the jokes fell flat, but it succeeded where you'd least expect. In fact, it was sweet, engaging, it did have some great jokes, but also good performances and a soundtrack that anchors it all.It mostly rides on the concept of missing out on your dream by *this* much, leaving you with only a bunch of 'what-ifs.' In this case, it's a rocker who missed his chance on being part of one of the biggest groups in the world. A deleted scene with former-Beatle Pete Best anchors in this fact, and the concept actually is quite interesting in of itself. Add to that themes of moving on, maturity, and following your dreams, and you're hooked.Another thing that is surprising is characterization, as you see this motley crew who make up a band develop and mature through their journey on the road to stardom. Rainn Wilson, Emma Stone and even Christina Applegate are great in their roles, and bring something extra to their characters that probably wouldn't have been there otherwise. Teddy Geiger is also a good actor, playing an emoish kid who through his journey develops into a sunny pop/rock artist. And this is where the soundtrack comes in, because even though it doesn't sound all that great by itself, it sounds pretty impressive within the movie.Overall, you should at least check it out as a rental, and come into the movie with an open mind. You might just like what you hear and see in this underrated flick. Granted, it's not amazing, but it is worth a watch, and your support.

1184876,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B001E95ZHY,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","The Rocker speaks to all those who want to live out their rock `n' roll dream of making it big, and playing in front of a huge crowd. At times you get a sense where the film is heading, and can predict some parts, especially towards the end, but it is a very engaging and light-hearted comedy about fame, loyalty, and, of course, rock. What was refreshing was that there wasn't an overabundance of profanity or crudeness in a film that could have easily gone that route; instead, the film's comedy relies more on great lines from its main character ""Fish"" and parody-like situations with the band. Comparisons between The Rocker and School of Rock seem to abound in the reviews, and Rainn Wilson seems to bring the same energy to this role as Jack Black did in School of Rock, but I thought this was the better of the two films.The film's premise: After Vesuvius' show before a Cleveland crowd in 1986, the band decides to drop drummer Robert Fishman (""Fish"") in hopes of their shot at big-time fame. Twenty years later, Fish is spurned by Vesuvius' popularity and fame as one of the greatest bands ever, and bitterly contemplates what could have been as he works in his cubicle while coworkers listen to Vesuvius. After being fired, Fish's nephew offers him a chance to play with them in a school prom, and Fish begins to realize that this might be his new-found chance at realizing his long lost dreams. His new band, A.D.D., begins to make waves in the music scene after sudden YouTube fame, and with their scumbag hipster agent (played by Saturday Night Live's Jason Sudeikis) they make their way up to the top and the eventual chance to play in front of a Cleveland crowd. However, there is a catch to this opportunity for Fish. He has a big dilemma: does he choose his pride, or loyalty?Overall, this is quite an enjoyable and funny film. There are some laugh out loud scenes, and the casting for the various roles is fantastic. It is funny enough to be engaging, yet not too over the top to make one disgusted. Among other stars in the film are Christina Appelgate as one of the band member's moms and Saturday Night Live's Fred Armisen as one of the members of Vesuvius. Rainn Wilson really brings an exceptional amount of humor to his role. Another great aspect of this comedy is that you seem to care, and root, for the main character along the way.Great film!",4,Living the Rock 'n' Roll Dream,1243641600,"05 30, 2009",2009,2370,"['Rocker', 'who', 'want', 'live', 'out', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'dream', 'making', 'big', 'playing', 'front', 'huge', 'crowd', 'times', 'get', 'sense', 'where', 'film', 'heading', 'can', 'predict', 'parts', 'especially', 'end', 'very', 'engaging', 'light-hearted', 'comedy', 'fame', 'loyalty', 'course', 'rock', 'What', 'was', 'refreshing', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'overabundance', 'profanity', 'crudeness', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'route', 'instead', 'film', 'comedy', 'more', 'great', 'lines', 'main', 'character', 'Fish', 'parody-like', 'situations', 'band', 'Comparisons', 'Rocker', 'School', 'Rock', 'seem', 'abound', 'reviews', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'bring', 'same', 'energy', 'role', 'Jack', 'Black', 'did', 'School', 'Rock', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'two', 'films.The', 'film', 'premise', 'Vesuvius', 'show', 'Cleveland', 'crowd', '1986', 'band', 'drop', 'drummer', 'Robert', 'Fishman', 'Fish', 'hopes', 'shot', 'big-time', 'fame', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Fish', 'spurned', 'Vesuvius', 'popularity', 'fame', 'one', 'greatest', 'bands', 'ever', 'bitterly', 'contemplates', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cubicle', 'coworkers', 'listen', 'Vesuvius', 'being', 'fired', 'Fish', 'nephew', 'chance', 'play', 'school', 'prom', 'Fish', 'begins', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'new-found', 'chance', 'realizing', 'long', 'lost', 'dreams', 'new', 'band', 'A.D.D.', 'make', 'waves', 'music', 'scene', 'sudden', 'YouTube', 'fame', 'scumbag', 'hipster', 'agent', 'played', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'make', 'way', 'top', 'eventual', 'chance', 'play', 'front', 'Cleveland', 'crowd', 'However', 'catch', 'opportunity', 'Fish', 'big', 'dilemma', 'choose', 'pride', 'loyalty', 'Overall', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'film', 'are', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'casting', 'various', 'roles', 'fantastic', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'engaging', 'yet', 'not', 'too', 'top', 'make', 'one', 'disgusted', 'other', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'Christina', 'Appelgate', 'one', 'band', 'member', 'moms', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'one', 'members', 'Vesuvius', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'really', 'exceptional', 'amount', 'humor', 'role', 'great', 'aspect', 'comedy', 'seem', 'care', 'root', 'main', 'character', 'way.Great', 'film']",N/A

From the start, you can tell something is up and it's no holds barred hilarity from many cleverly (or not so cleverly) disguised stars of SNL!  The plot is reminiscent of ""School of Rock"", but takes the situation in a different direction, while amplifying the differences between past and present musical styles.  The movie features the parenting team of Jane Lynch and Jeff Garlin (from ""Sleepover"") and Christina Applegate really out of character as a somewhat overprotective mom.  The gags are sometimes cliche, but not always, and fairly enjoyable, except for the pocket of puke scene (blech).  Otherwise...Rainn Wilson is very charming and endearing (not nearly as creepy as Dwight Schrute, his character from ""The Office"") as he portrays an aging 80's rocker who was NEARLY famous before being axed from his band at the height of their popularity.  Twenty years later, he is unexpectedly given another chance to rock and make a run for the top with his nephew and his band!  Will they succeed?  Will uncle get axed again?

1184881,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B001E95ZHY,Kelly Klepfer,"[6, 7]","""Dwight"" from The Office fans should find enough Dwight in this film to satisfy. Those of you who can't stand ""Dwight"" well, you may not find The Rocker experience a great one. The story is amusing enough. Twenty years previously, Fish (Wilson) is the drummer for the band Vesuvius. Good news for the band, a big label wants to sign them. Bad news for Fish, the president of the label has a drummer nephew who will be the band drummer. Fish never gets over this slight. As the band Vesuvius grows in popularity, Fish grows in bitterness. After losing his job, girlfriend and apartment he moves into his sister's attic. His nephew has a garage band with a gig at the prom. They lose their drummer and, well, you can figure it out from here.Surprisingly clean, there are no sex scenes, the language is tolerable and low-key. However, there is a scene with an angry mother who shares the fact that her son drew a male body part on a female teacher's face....which is a very funny scene, but contains the anatomically correct word several times. There is also a band manager who is very free with come-on's and has a sexually oriented potty mouth. A scene of Fish drumming naked becomes the YouTube hit -- The Naked Drummer -- and propels the band to popularity. Viewers are treated to a whole lot of naked man rear shots.The humor level is moderate. Like I said, you probably need to be amused by Dwight to fully appreciate Fish's humor. He has a very unique delivery, sweet blended with doofusy sarcasm/nastiness. There are several amusing one-liners and situations that are laugh out loud including quite a bit of physical humor. Christina Applegate delivers some great sarcastic lines. The writing is good. The songs are easy to listen to and I really liked their sound. Solid friendship, do-the-right thing and forgiveness themes run through the film. Fish is a classic 80's rocker who likes the party scene, including the trashing of hotel rooms. The three younger band members are annoyed with his boorish behavior and that's a nice refreshing change from the usual teen movie.",4,"Kind of Sweet, Completely Weird, But Fun.",1236384000,"03 7, 2009",2009,2080,"['Dwight', 'Office', 'fans', 'should', 'find', 'enough', 'Dwight', 'film', 'satisfy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Dwight', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'Rocker', 'experience', 'great', 'one', 'story', 'amusing', 'enough', 'Twenty', 'years', 'previously', 'Fish', 'Wilson', 'drummer', 'band', 'Vesuvius', 'Good', 'news', 'band', 'big', 'label', 'sign', 'Bad', 'news', 'Fish', 'president', 'label', 'drummer', 'nephew', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'band', 'drummer', 'Fish', 'never', 'slight', 'band', 'Vesuvius', 'popularity', 'Fish', 'grows', 'bitterness', 'losing', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'apartment', 'sister', 'attic', 'nephew', 'garage', 'band', 'gig', 'prom', 'lose', 'drummer', 'well', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'here.Surprisingly', 'clean', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'language', 'tolerable', 'low-key', 'However', 'scene', 'angry', 'mother', 'who', 'shares', 'fact', 'son', 'drew', 'male', 'body', 'part', 'female', 'teacher', 'face', '.which', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'anatomically', 'correct', 'word', 'several', 'times', 'also', 'band', 'manager', 'who', 'very', 'free', 'come-on', 'sexually', 'oriented', 'potty', 'mouth', 'scene', 'Fish', 'drumming', 'naked', 'YouTube', 'hit', 'Naked', 'Drummer', 'propels', 'band', 'popularity', 'Viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'whole', 'lot', 'naked', 'man', 'rear', 'shots.The', 'humor', 'level', 'moderate', 'said', 'probably', 'need', 'be', 'amused', 'Dwight', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Fish', 'humor', 'very', 'unique', 'delivery', 'sweet', 'blended', 'doofusy', 'sarcasm/nastiness', 'are', 'several', 'amusing', 'one-liners', 'situations', 'are', 'loud', 'including', 'quite', 'bit', 'physical', 'humor', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'great', 'sarcastic', 'lines', 'writing', 'good', 'songs', 'are', 'easy', 'listen', 'really', 'liked', 'sound', 'Solid', 'friendship', 'do-the-right', 'thing', 'forgiveness', 'themes', 'run', 'film', 'Fish', 'classic', '80', 'rocker', 'who', 'party', 'scene', 'including', 'trashing', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'three', 'younger', 'band', 'members', 'are', 'annoyed', 'boorish', 'behavior', 'nice', 'refreshing', 'change', 'usual', 'teen', 'movie']",N/A

Passed over when it was released, never making the ranks of quality films for most critics, it offers nothing less than what most viewers are looking for. Pure entertainment, fun and a chance to escape the mundane world we all live in. Unfortunately, that is not what most critics look for in a movie. Their loss.Rainn Wilson of TV's THE OFFICE stars as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, the drummer for heavy metal hair band Vesuvius as the film opens in 1988. The band has just been offered the big time if they will only dump their wild man drummer. The temptation is too great and after a hilarious dumping, the band heads to the big time and Fish heads to 20 years of drudgery.After losing his job, getting dropped by his girlfriend and having to endure the success of his former band mates, Fish retires to his sister's home until he can find work. His high school age nephew Matt (Josh Gad) plays in a band of his own with several friends called A.D.D.  When their drummer gets suspended and grounded, they find themselves in need of a drummer. Unable to find one on short notice, they elect Fish.All doesn't go well but eventually they begin working together. Songwriter-singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger) comes up with dynamite lyrics that Fish finds amazing. Bass player and attitude champion Amelia (Emma Stone) broods and pines for Curtis but never lets on. Matt dreams of losing his insecurity and meeting a girl. Things would be back to normal with the exception that Matt's brat sister puts in motion a video that will change their lives.Matt has a 4 way online video conference hook up allowing the band to practice at home in their rooms. Non-tech savvy Fish practices in the buff and once the video hits online, The Naked Drummer gets tons of hits as well as the attention of a record company.With the offer to record and then tour, things seem to be going great for both the band and Fish. The band because a young, fresh sound gets the chance to be heard. Fish because he now has a second chance to make his dream come true.But that dream comes with a price. Still trapped in his youthful ideas of the rock and roll lifestyle, Fish attempts to get the kids to be the bad boys (and girl) of rock. But they just want to relax and play X Box after a gig. A few weeks on the road and the bands parents are required to bail them out of jail led by Curtis' mom Kim (Christina Applegate). The only way they will allow the tour to continue is if she goes along as well. Hello mom.A smarmy record exec tries to put members of the band against one another, tries to shape them into something they are not and in general screws things up between this extended family. The result is Fish dumping the rocker lifestyle, cutting his hair and taking a responsible job. The band suffers with his loss. And eventually they come around to bringing him back in the fold.The only problem is that as popular as they've become, their next big opportunity is to open up for Vesuvius at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Can Fish put aside his grievances with the old band? Can A.D.D. remain on top? Watch and see!There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in this film. The characters are pat ones. Wilson does a goofball like most actors these days resulting to gross out humor. But it doesn't matter! The film plays for laughs, for fun, for entertainment. Along the way Wilson's character adopts a fatherly attitude towards Curtis, offering great advice he never seems to be able to apply to himself. It makes Fish seem not only the wild man but an endearing soul as well.This is by no means a movie to make others pale in comparison. It is not a classic that will be treasured forever.

Rios,"[5, 7]","i keep seeing these reviews and remarks that The Rocker is a rip off of Jack Black's The School of Rock.expect for a line or part here or there, The Rocker stands on it's own merit and is completely awesome, just like The School of Rock.Robert Fishman, aka FISH was the drummer for the band Vesuvius before they hit legendary status. When the manager asks the band to fire Fish and replace him with the Producer's nephew and get the big contract, they oblige and Fish is out.20 years later, Vesiuvus is the biggest band in America and Fish is bouncing from job to job feeling sorry for himself that he could have and should have been the drummer for Vesuvius, even naming a couple of their songs before they hit big.He's fired from his current job after getting into a fight with a co-worker who puts on the newest CD of Vesivus, which Fish doesn't want to hear.He dumps, or rather, is dumped by his girlfriend so he moves in with his sister, played by Jane Lynch (Role Models, 40 Year Old Virgin). His nephew Matt is in a band called A.D.D., and they are scheduled to play at the upcoming prom. The band includes signer-songwriter Curtis (Teddy Gieger who actually is a real life musician) and gutiarist Amelia (Emma Stone,  Jules from Superbad). Their drummer is suspended from school, can't walk the graduation line, and is grounded by his mother, so the hunt begins for a new drummer.With all options exhausted, they ask Uncle Fish, and he agrees to play drums at the Prom after a heart to heart with his nephew Matt. He shows up rock star style with backstage passes and without ever practicing, rocks the drums and band starts off awesome, but during the king-queen song, Fish gets overexcited being that it was the first time he had played drums or in a concert in over 20 years, and flies off on a drum solo during a slow dance and ruins the band's performance.Feeling bad, he meets with the band a couple of days later and tells them that they are good and that their songs need to be heard, so he proposes a deal to get the band a gig with himself as the lead drummer.Fish gets the gig, but in Indiana (the story takes place in Cleveland), so the kids cop up a fake story and Fish ""borrows"" his sister's car, she calls the cops, the kids get grounded, and Fish gets kicked out of his sister's house.She keeps asking him to grow up, but as he says, ""you can never take away the dream"".The band continues to practice, as Matt is good with computers and sets up 4 different webcams so they can continue to all practice despite being all grounded, but Fish, being old school, thinks the camera is a microphone and plays the drums completely naked!Matt's sister sees the video and puts it on Youtube and BANG........Internet sensation.They get signed to a contract and start touring, and i don't want to give away the story, but it's awesome, really enjoyable.Christina Applegate (Curtis' Mom) and SNL's Jason Sudeikis (plays Joe Biden on SNL) also come out the movie with Jason playing the role of David Marshall, the band's manager. It's hilarious watching Jason's character trying to hit on Christina Applegate, and his lines are funny, like ""yeah well, your body's changing."" LOL!!! ;) (inside joke-you need to watch the movie to understand). My favorite line was the John Lennon line.Great movie overall, the soundtrack is awsome, Rainn Wilson is AWESOME and his drum playing is authentic. What makes the movie even better is the authenticity of the music, because Teddy Geiger, who plays Curtis is actually singing the song, and the 2 Vesivus songs that come out in the movie also come out on the soundtrack.I know The Rocker didn't do so hot in the theaters, but I really liked this movie. it's very original (based in part on the story of Pete Best, original drummer of The Beatles before they fired him and before the Beatles hit it big. Best BTW, was replaced by Ringo Starr.but overall, great movie, great songs, great comedy, good clean Rock movie.",5,Go back to Cleveland Cleveland!,1237420800,"03 19, 2009",2009,3965,"['i', 'keep', 'seeing', 'reviews', 'remarks', 'Rocker', 'rip', 'Jack', 'Black', 'School', 'Rock.expect', 'line', 'part', 'here', 'there', 'Rocker', 'own', 'merit', 'completely', 'awesome', 'just', 'School', 'Rock.Robert', 'Fishman', 'aka', 'FISH', 'was', 'drummer', 'band', 'Vesuvius', 'hit', 'legendary', 'status', 'When', 'manager', 'band', 'fire', 'Fish', 'replace', 'Producer', 'nephew', 'get', 'big', 'contract', 'oblige', 'Fish', 'out.20', 'years', 'later', 'Vesiuvus', 'biggest', 'band', 'America', 'Fish', 'bouncing', 'job', 'job', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'drummer', 'Vesuvius', 'even', 'naming', 'couple', 'songs', 'hit', 'big.He', 'fired', 'current', 'job', 'getting', 'fight', 'co-worker', 'who', 'newest', 'CD', 'Vesivus', 'Fish', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear.He', 'dumps', 'rather', 'dumped', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'sister', 'played', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'Role', 'Models', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'nephew', 'Matt', 'band', 'called', 'A.D.D.', 'are', 'scheduled', 'play', 'upcoming', 'prom', 'band', 'signer-songwriter', 'Curtis', 'Teddy', 'Gieger', 'who', 'actually', 'real', 'life', 'musician', 'gutiarist', 'Amelia', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Jules', 'Superbad', 'drummer', 'suspended', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'graduation', 'line', 'grounded', 'mother', 'hunt', 'new', 'drummer.With', 'options', 'exhausted', 'ask', 'Uncle', 'Fish', 'play', 'drums', 'Prom', 'heart', 'heart', 'nephew', 'Matt', 'up', 'rock', 'star', 'style', 'backstage', 'passes', 'ever', 'practicing', 'drums', 'band', 'awesome', 'king-queen', 'song', 'Fish', 'overexcited', 'being', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'played', 'drums', 'concert', '20', 'years', 'flies', 'off', 'drum', 'solo', 'slow', 'dance', 'band', 'performance.Feeling', 'bad', 'band', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'tells', 'are', 'good', 'songs', 'need', 'be', 'heard', 'deal', 'get', 'band', 'gig', 'lead', 'drummer.Fish', 'gig', 'Indiana', 'story', 'place', 'Cleveland', 'kids', 'cop', 'up', 'fake', 'story', 'Fish', 'borrows', 'sister', 'car', 'cops', 'kids', 'get', 'grounded', 'Fish', 'kicked', 'sister', 'house.She', 'keeps', 'asking', 'grow', 'up', 'can', 'never', 'take', 'away', 'dream', 'band', 'practice', 'Matt', 'good', 'computers', 'up', '4', 'different', 'webcams', 'can', 'continue', 'practice', 'being', 'grounded', 'Fish', 'being', 'old', 'school', 'camera', 'microphone', 'drums', 'completely', 'naked', 'Matt', 'sister', 'video', 'Youtube', 'BANG', '..Internet', 'sensation.They', 'get', 'signed', 'contract', 'start', 'touring', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'awesome', 'really', 'enjoyable.Christina', 'Applegate', 'Curtis', 'Mom', 'SNL', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'Joe', 'Biden', 'SNL', 'also', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'Jason', 'playing', 'role', 'David', 'Marshall', 'band', 'manager', 'hilarious', 'watching', 'Jason', 'character', 'trying', 'hit', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'lines', 'are', 'funny', 'yeah', 'well', 'body', 'changing', 'LOL', 'joke-you', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'understand', 'favorite', 'line', 'was', 'John', 'Lennon', 'line.Great', 'movie', 'overall', 'soundtrack', 'awsome', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'AWESOME', 'drum', 'playing', 'authentic', 'What', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'authenticity', 'music', 'Teddy', 'Geiger', 'who', 'Curtis', 'actually', 'singing', 'song', '2', 'Vesivus', 'songs', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'also', 'come', 'out', 'soundtrack.I', 'know', 'Rocker', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'hot', 'theaters', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'very', 'original', 'based', 'part', 'story', 'Pete', 'Best', 'original', 'drummer', 'Beatles', 'fired', 'Beatles', 'hit', 'big', 'Best', 'BTW', 'was', 'replaced', 'Ringo', 'Starr.but', 'overall', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'songs', 'great', 'comedy', 'good', 'clean', 'Rock', 'movie']",N/A

I'd rate this film a buy-it in a heartbeat if the price was about 30 percent lower than it is (yes, I know that Amazon keeps their Blu-rays on sale regularly, so it's already discounted... what I am wishing is that the MSRP was lower so that Amazon's price could be lowered in which case I'd probably buy this without even pausing).  Thanks to the higher MSRP I'm left to say this one is at least worth a rental, but probably would have to be on sale to really pull the buy it rating.No, there's nothing wrong with the film in my book, in fact it's a pretty likable and entertaining comedy.  While critics gave the film a mixed reception (39 percent rotten), there've been plenty of films that are worse and which fail to deliver anything close to the entertainment value found here.The Rocker features a fairly talented cast that seem to fit the roles they were in, though star Rainn Wilson (The Office, Six Feet Under, others) and his bandmates don't necessarily look that young at the start of the film (20 years ago), and don't necessarily seem all that old so much later in the film either.So here's the story, in case you are not familiar with The Rocker: an up-and-coming rock band is about to hit it big, with the record company scout in the audience as they are playing to a packed house.  As the show wraps up the record company exec comes in and sends the band's drummer out to go get some beer.  Not just any beer, but the good stuff.  Imported even.  The band knows that must mean good news, and yes, it really does, though not for everyone in the band.  It seems that the record company president has a relative that wants to be a rockstar who just happens to play the drums.  You'd have to blind not to see where things are going there...Flash forward 20 years to find that former drummer Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) can't seem to escape the loss of his chance at fame and rockstar fortune.  One of his cubicle mates has purchased the latest CD from his old band and forces Fish (and the rest of the office) to give it a listen.  Needless to say Fish isn't particularly pleased by that idea :-/Fish winds up out of work, tossed out by his girlfriend and with no where to go but to his sister's house.  There he renews acquaintances with his nephew Matt Gadman (Josh Gad, formerly in FOX's short-lived TV series Back to You) and Matt's parents (Jeff Garlin of Curb Your Enthusiasm and others along with Jane Lynch of The L Word, The 40 Year Virgin and others).  It seems that Matt is in a band with a few of his high school friends: Curtis (Teddy Geiger, formerly on the CBS series Love Monkey), Amelia (Emma Stone of FOX's short-lived series Drive and others) along with a drummer that finds himself grounded for a few pranks he's pulled at school.The band has already been booked to play the prom, so as a favor Fish joins the band and takes up the role of drummer.  Sensing how talented Curtis is, and perhaps sensing another shot at the rockstar life, Fish promises to get a gig for the band and winds up doing just that.  Soon, through a happy accident involving You Tube, Fish has done more than just get a gig for the band, he's gotten them interest from a record label that wants to send the band on the road.The rocker doesn't always hit all of the notes it aims for, but more often than not it delivers fairly solid entertainment value for viewers.  Fish gets to have some of the fun that he missed out on while his old band was working their way to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Unfortunately some of that fun is a little too much for the parents of the band mates to live with, so Curtis mother Kim (Christina Applegate) becomes a chaperon on the tour.Be sure to look for a few cameos and small roles by a few notable individuals and also enjoy the short performances by Fish's old band mates, at least one of which was barely recognizable until well into his appearance.Making the film a bit more enjoyable is a solid sound track with an enjoyable collection of rock anthems along with 'original music' from A.D.D. (the kids band).Video quality is quite solid, and looks quite nice for the concert type footage.  There's some nice shots of the Cleveland cityscape included too.  With the film being a recent release, the source material is all clean and was obviously ready for transfer to high-definition disc format.In addition to other bonus features, the Blu-ray includes Digital Copy, though again the price for purchase is still higher than I'd prefer.",4,A 'rock' solid comedy or something slightly less?,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,4553,"['Argh', 'Curse', '20th', 'Century', 'FOX', 'pricing', 'structure', ""'d"", 'rate', 'film', 'buy-it', 'heartbeat', 'price', 'was', '30', 'percent', 'lower', 'yes', 'know', 'Amazon', 'keeps', 'Blu-rays', 'sale', 'regularly', 'already', 'discounted', 'what', 'am', 'wishing', 'MSRP', 'was', 'lower', 'Amazon', 'price', 'could', 'be', 'lowered', 'case', ""'d"", 'probably', 'buy', 'even', 'pausing', 'Thanks', 'higher', 'MSRP', ""'m"", 'left', 'say', 'one', 'least', 'rental', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'sale', 'really', 'pull', 'buy', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'book', 'fact', 'pretty', 'likable', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'critics', 'gave', 'film', 'mixed', 'reception', '39', 'percent', 'rotten', ""'ve"", 'been', 'plenty', 'films', 'are', 'worse', 'fail', 'deliver', 'anything', 'close', 'entertainment', 'value', 'found', 'here.The', 'Rocker', 'fairly', 'talented', 'cast', 'seem', 'fit', 'roles', 'were', 'star', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'Office', 'Six', 'Feet', 'others', 'bandmates', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'look', 'young', 'start', 'film', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'seem', 'old', 'so', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'either.So', 'here', 'story', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Rocker', 'up-and-coming', 'rock', 'band', 'hit', 'big', 'record', 'company', 'scout', 'audience', 'are', 'playing', 'packed', 'house', 'show', 'up', 'record', 'company', 'exec', 'band', 'drummer', 'go', 'get', 'beer', 'Not', 'just', 'beer', 'good', 'stuff', 'Imported', 'even', 'band', 'must', 'mean', 'good', 'news', 'yes', 'really', 'not', 'everyone', 'band', 'record', 'company', 'president', 'relative', 'be', 'rockstar', 'who', 'just', 'play', 'drums', ""'d"", 'have', 'blind', 'not', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'there', 'Flash', 'forward', '20', 'years', 'find', 'former', 'drummer', 'Robert', ""'Fish"", 'Fishman', 'Wilson', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'escape', 'loss', 'chance', 'fame', 'rockstar', 'fortune', 'One', 'cubicle', 'purchased', 'latest', 'CD', 'old', 'band', 'forces', 'Fish', 'rest', 'office', 'give', 'listen', 'Needless', 'say', 'Fish', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'pleased', 'idea', '-/Fish', 'winds', 'work', 'tossed', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'where', 'go', 'sister', 'house', 'acquaintances', 'nephew', 'Matt', 'Gadman', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'formerly', 'FOX', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'Back', 'Matt', 'parents', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'others', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'L', 'Word', '40', 'Year', 'Virgin', 'others', 'Matt', 'band', 'few', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'Curtis', 'Teddy', 'Geiger', 'formerly', 'CBS', 'series', 'Love', 'Monkey', 'Amelia', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'FOX', 'short-lived', 'series', 'Drive', 'others', 'drummer', 'grounded', 'few', 'pranks', 'pulled', 'school.The', 'band', 'already', 'been', 'booked', 'play', 'prom', 'so', 'favor', 'Fish', 'band', 'up', 'role', 'drummer', 'Sensing', 'how', 'talented', 'Curtis', 'perhaps', 'sensing', 'shot', 'rockstar', 'life', 'Fish', 'promises', 'get', 'gig', 'band', 'up', 'doing', 'just', 'Soon', 'happy', 'accident', 'involving', 'Tube', 'Fish', 'done', 'more', 'just', 'get', 'gig', 'band', 'gotten', 'interest', 'record', 'label', 'send', 'band', 'road.The', 'rocker', ""n't"", 'always', 'hit', 'notes', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'fairly', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'value', 'viewers', 'Fish', 'have', 'fun', 'missed', 'out', 'old', 'band', 'was', 'working', 'way', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'Unfortunately', 'fun', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'parents', 'band', 'live', 'so', 'Curtis', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'chaperon', 'tour.Be', 'sure', 'look', 'few', 'cameos', 'small', 'roles', 'few', 'notable', 'individuals', 'also', 'enjoy', 'short', 'performances', 'Fish', 'old', 'band', 'mates', 'least', 'one', 'was', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'well', 'appearance.Making', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'solid', 'sound', 'track', 'enjoyable', 'collection', 'rock', 'anthems', ""'original"", 'music', 'A.D.D', 'kids', 'band', '.Video', 'quality', 'quite', 'solid', 'quite', 'nice', 'concert', 'type', 'footage', 'nice', 'shots', 'Cleveland', 'cityscape', 'included', 'too', 'film', 'being', 'recent', 'release', 'source', 'material', 'clean', 'was', 'obviously', 'ready', 'transfer', 'high-definition', 'disc', 'format.In', 'addition', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'Blu-ray', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'though', 'again', 'price', 'purchase', 'still', 'higher', ""'d"", 'prefer']",N/A
1184904,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001E95ZHY,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 4]","Though it borrows liberally from its genre brethren, The Rocker showcases a keen sense of parody and heart with a powerful star performance from the Jack Black-channeling Rainn Wilson. The ""naked drummer"" doesn't stray too far from his Office persona, but the random foul-mouthed spurts and goggle-eyed expressions certainly add a welcome layer of comic ingenuity.In 1986, Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson) drums for the popular rock band Vesuvius and a lucrative career seems destined to embrace him. However, a chance to play at a killer gig causes his bandmates to sell him out for fast fame, and the drummer is literally kicked to the streets. Twenty years later, Robert finds himself in a dead-end desk job with no hope of escaping his mundane lifestyle. But good luck and misfortune strike simultaneously leaving him jobless, homeless, and shacked up at his sister's house - where the desperation of his nephew's rock band lands him a spot as their drummer. What starts off as a rocky, mismatched collaboration inadvertently becomes a rapid success and Robert, along with Amelia (Emma Stone), Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and Matt (Josh Gad) may finally get to live the dream they've worked so hard to obtain.For his debut leading film role, Rainn Wilson manages a diverse blend of comedy and emanates the better qualities of funnyman Jack Black. Rainn keeps his character under control so as not to get annoying but remains erratic enough to evoke plenty of laughs. Most of the physical comedy (and nudity, unfortunately) belongs to the Office veteran who competently handles elaborate falls and crazed expressions with sincere enthusiasm. Spouting off random quotable gibes, Wilson utilizes a copious amount of offbeat one-liners and bizarre references that will result in a hearty chuckle for those attuned to the borderline-offensive brand of comedy.While the primary band members fill their roles quite ably, a surprising amount of laughs come from the hilarious supporting characters and their moments of inspired lunacy. Most notable are Will Arnett as a crazed 80's rocker and Jason Sudeikis as an arrogant record label agent whose offensive pick-up lines never fail to amuse. Numerous cameos also fill the screen, from stand-up comedian favorites to famous musicians and anchored comedy character actors.Though the whole cast turns in fine performances and Rainn Wilson conjures up a delirious beast of a drummer, The Rocker's downfall may be its heavily treaded subject matter. The clich&eacute;-filled plot resembles far too many others and even the rather unique pieces feel drowned out by the surplus of stereotypical events. What clearly rocks though is the hysterical frontman and a host of great cameos and fantastic supporting characters who bring an edgy absurdity to the whole affair.- Joel Massie",3,The Rocker Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2819,"['liberally', 'genre', 'brethren', 'Rocker', 'keen', 'sense', 'parody', 'heart', 'powerful', 'star', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Black-channeling', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'naked', 'drummer', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'Office', 'persona', 'random', 'foul-mouthed', 'spurts', 'goggle-eyed', 'expressions', 'certainly', 'add', 'welcome', 'layer', 'comic', 'ingenuity.In', '1986', 'Robert', 'Fish', 'Fishman', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'drums', 'popular', 'rock', 'band', 'Vesuvius', 'lucrative', 'career', 'destined', 'embrace', 'However', 'chance', 'play', 'killer', 'gig', 'bandmates', 'sell', 'out', 'fast', 'fame', 'drummer', 'literally', 'kicked', 'streets', 'Twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Robert', 'dead-end', 'desk', 'job', 'hope', 'escaping', 'mundane', 'lifestyle', 'good', 'luck', 'misfortune', 'strike', 'simultaneously', 'leaving', 'jobless', 'homeless', 'shacked', 'up', 'sister', 'house', 'where', 'desperation', 'nephew', 'rock', 'band', 'spot', 'drummer', 'What', 'off', 'rocky', 'mismatched', 'collaboration', 'inadvertently', 'rapid', 'success', 'Robert', 'Amelia', 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Curtis', 'Teddy', 'Geiger', 'Matt', 'Josh', 'Gad', 'may', 'finally', 'get', 'live', 'dream', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'obtain.For', 'debut', 'leading', 'film', 'role', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'diverse', 'blend', 'comedy', 'better', 'qualities', 'funnyman', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Rainn', 'character', 'control', 'so', 'as', 'not', 'get', 'annoying', 'erratic', 'enough', 'evoke', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'Most', 'physical', 'comedy', 'nudity', 'unfortunately', 'Office', 'veteran', 'who', 'competently', 'elaborate', 'falls', 'crazed', 'expressions', 'sincere', 'enthusiasm', 'Spouting', 'off', 'random', 'quotable', 'gibes', 'Wilson', 'copious', 'amount', 'offbeat', 'one-liners', 'bizarre', 'references', 'will', 'result', 'hearty', 'chuckle', 'attuned', 'borderline-offensive', 'brand', 'comedy.While', 'primary', 'band', 'members', 'fill', 'roles', 'quite', 'ably', 'surprising', 'amount', 'laughs', 'come', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'characters', 'moments', 'inspired', 'lunacy', 'Most', 'notable', 'are', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'crazed', '80', 'rocker', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'arrogant', 'record', 'label', 'agent', 'offensive', 'pick-up', 'lines', 'never', 'fail', 'amuse', 'Numerous', 'cameos', 'also', 'screen', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'favorites', 'famous', 'musicians', 'anchored', 'comedy', 'character', 'whole', 'cast', 'fine', 'performances', 'Rainn', 'Wilson', 'up', 'delirious', 'beast', 'drummer', 'Rocker', 'downfall', 'may', 'be', 'heavily', 'treaded', 'subject', 'matter', 'clich', 'eacute', '-filled', 'plot', 'resembles', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'even', 'rather', 'unique', 'pieces', 'feel', 'drowned', 'out', 'surplus', 'stereotypical', 'events', 'What', 'clearly', 'hysterical', 'frontman', 'host', 'great', 'cameos', 'fantastic', 'supporting', 'characters', 'who', 'bring', 'edgy', 'absurdity', 'whole', 'affair.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",N/A

Twenty years later still disgruntled Robert is seen working in office cubicle. When Robert loses the job, he is asked by his nephew Matt (Josh Gad) to play for his band's prom gig. As you will see, this turns out to be a good thing for Robert , Matt and other members of the band ""A.D.D."" - Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and Amelia (Emma Stone).The introductory part of ""The Rocker"" is clearly inspired by the real-life story of Pete Best (who appears briefly at the bus stop scene), the drummer replaced by Ringo Starr just before the Beatles made their debut, but the storyline itself is similar to some of the recent rock-themed films such as ""The School of Rock"" and ""Rock Star."" This is a story you heard before, and it seems director Peter Cattaneo (""The Full Monty"") is aware of that. There are new ideas (the jam session on the net with the naked drummer and its consequences) and some of them are very good, sometimes hilarious, but they are not fully developed.Even those who don't mind the predictability of the film might find the unlikely hero ""Fish"" a bit annoying. If you don't like Jack Black's character in ""School of Rock,"" you will probably don't find Rainn Wilson's character very attractive, who is ten times louder than Jack Black's wannabe rocker. Fans of Christina Applegate (as Curtis's mother and Robert's love interest) and Emma Stone would be disappointed with the underwritten characters they are required to play.""The Rocker"" is a box-office flop in 2008 and I am not surprised to know that.
