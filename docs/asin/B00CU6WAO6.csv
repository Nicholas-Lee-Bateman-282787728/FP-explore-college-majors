1651015,A1MT637T99B3RZ,B00CU6WAO6,AdamW,"[0, 0]","I loved this series back when it was brand new in 2011 in sub.My only complaint which could be no ones fault except production error, is that the bluray version of the in episode commentaries is distorted. Only way to &#34;fix&#34; is to fast forward. But thankfully this comes with the dvd version as well and that works fine.Thankfully with anime in dubbed, they also include the sub. Me personally i prefer dub over sub but some voices in here are not fitting, like Shu or Tsugumi. (Tsugumi played by Monica Rial, normally I love her Dubbing but her voice for Tsugumi is not fitting.) I will be watching this in subbed again but in HD!Overall i personally loved guilty crown a lot, those who loved it should definetly buy the limited edition version.

1651017,A2V0P9FMG2996Y,B00CU6WAO6,Cassandra (The Huge Anime Fan),"[1, 1]",Check out more anime reviews: The Huge Anime Fan via WordpressI had previously heard some negative reviews of the series so almost passed it up but in the end watched it throughout online and thought it had such wonderful animation and music.The ending and each episode progresses the character development just enough. There are so many heart-moving themes in this series. It has such an epic feel that feel sorry didn't get my hands on this sooner. After watching online decided to invest on it for a physical copy of Guilty Crown.With Guilty Crown have to say love the voice actors Yuki Kaji and Ai Kayano. They are so talented and made the characters all  have a feeling of otherworldly and human traits which as have said before felt very epic. The English voice actors did a pretty good job after the Japanese voice cast.Guilty Crown has so much to offer thanks to its complexity and it helps to dig deep to continue to see what all the themes and connections are since there is so much beyond the surface.,5,Guilty Crown really is a true legendary anime series,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1012,"['Check', 'out', 'more', 'anime', 'reviews', 'Huge', 'Anime', 'Fan', 'WordpressI', 'had', 'previously', 'heard', 'negative', 'reviews', 'series', 'so', 'almost', 'passed', 'up', 'end', 'watched', 'online', 'thought', 'had', 'such', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'music.The', 'ending', 'episode', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'enough', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'heart-moving', 'themes', 'series', 'such', 'epic', 'feel', 'feel', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'hands', 'sooner', 'watching', 'online', 'decided', 'invest', 'physical', 'copy', 'Guilty', 'Crown.With', 'Guilty', 'Crown', 'have', 'say', 'love', 'voice', 'actors', 'Yuki', 'Kaji', 'Ai', 'Kayano', 'are', 'so', 'talented', 'made', 'characters', 'have', 'feeling', 'otherworldly', 'human', 'traits', 'as', 'have', 'said', 'felt', 'very', 'epic', 'English', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast.Guilty', 'Crown', 'so', 'much', 'offer', 'thanks', 'complexity', 'dig', 'deep', 'continue', 'see', 'what', 'themes', 'connections', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'surface']",N/A

It has great artwork from Redjuice and an amazing soundtrack by Supercell; how by the way, made music for Hatsune Miku. The show does has some clich&eacute;s but all in all it's a great watch.

1651019,A21IFUGVOAMTRD,B00CU6WAO6,DvtDude,"[39, 44]","I'm not sure if there is a Manga regarding this show or any other sort of Media, my review for this is based only on the actual Anime, for that is all I have seen.That being said I find people are being a bit on harsh on the reviews, at least in my opinion. To be honest the plot is doing nothing new. A military organization is trying to wipe out Japan and it's up to the resistance to fight back and keep Japan out of the clutches of this organization. It's not something new but the way the fights, the plot, and the characters are presented seemed fresh and new to me, for the most part I very much found myself enjoying the series.The stand out here for me was the music and art. If you are a huge fan of soundtracks this is one you may not want to miss. The show does a wonderful job of setting the mood, from sad moments to some of the most epic fights the show can offer. And when it comes to over the top fights this show is not hurting at all, it has enough action to suit almost anyone needs.When it comes to the characters themselves I found myself connection with quite a few and feeling their pain when the plot turned against them. A couple of reviews I have seen said, the characters seemed almost ""robotic"" or they changed to follow the plot. Personally I didn't see any of that at all. Sure the characters change throughout the show but it's because of traumatic events that affect them, I can't recall a single time where they changed their personality without some reason at all.Overall I found myself enjoying this show, it's something I will watch again and I always find myself listening to the Soundtrack. I don't think this is one that should be missed. Take the show for what it is, and I think you will enjoy it.",4,I think people are being a little harsh.,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1739,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Manga', 'regarding', 'show', 'other', 'sort', 'Media', 'review', 'based', 'only', 'actual', 'Anime', 'have', 'seen.That', 'being', 'said', 'find', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'bit', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'least', 'opinion', 'be', 'plot', 'doing', 'nothing', 'new', 'military', 'organization', 'trying', 'wipe', 'out', 'Japan', 'up', 'resistance', 'fight', 'back', 'keep', 'Japan', 'clutches', 'organization', 'not', 'something', 'new', 'way', 'fights', 'plot', 'characters', 'are', 'presented', 'seemed', 'fresh', 'new', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'much', 'found', 'enjoying', 'series.The', 'stand', 'here', 'was', 'music', 'art', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'soundtracks', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'miss', 'show', 'wonderful', 'job', 'setting', 'mood', 'sad', 'moments', 'most', 'epic', 'fights', 'show', 'can', 'offer', 'when', 'top', 'fights', 'show', 'not', 'hurting', 'enough', 'action', 'suit', 'almost', 'anyone', 'needs.When', 'characters', 'found', 'connection', 'few', 'feeling', 'pain', 'when', 'plot', 'turned', 'couple', 'reviews', 'have', 'seen', 'said', 'characters', 'seemed', 'almost', 'robotic', 'changed', 'follow', 'plot', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Sure', 'characters', 'change', 'show', 'traumatic', 'events', 'affect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'time', 'where', 'changed', 'personality', 'reason', 'all.Overall', 'found', 'enjoying', 'show', 'something', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'always', 'find', 'listening', 'Soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'missed', 'Take', 'show', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A
1651020,A1H4NFXAJQRQ2K,B00CU6WAO6,Fred,"[2, 3]","Decent anime, could have been a lot better. The concept of voids is great but they didn't really realize the idea very well via the graphics. Also things like mechs are generic looking and not out of the ordinary from a design perspective.The main complaint i have after watching the complete anime part 1&2 is the music... it just doesn't set the tone one way or the other. It's horrible singing and a portion of the theme is Inori's singing and Supercell just didn't fit the bill for me because the main theme song is just irritating especially when you have to hear it over and over again or skip the opening sequence to avoid it.The main characters are ok, and the story develops to a fair degree but i never really felt anything strong for any one character other than Shu which makes sense, but that's a lot of focus just on the main character so the anime lacks depth for me. They toss in that guy? the blond government type attack dog blond guy so generic I forget or never remembered his name... he's in a mech, kills infected citizens like they are threatening scum to be feared and loathed but they never really flesh out his character and he just seemed like they same guy in Escaflowne, or Last Exiles Dio... they just tossed him into the mix and that's kind of how a lot of the characters come off in the anime overall.Oh yeah, the extra art booklets are excellent with quite a few pages in the two beautiful little books. A big plus is that if you bought both part 1&2 there is enough room in the art sleeve to hold everything unlike some other collection box/art sleeves.",4,Not Perfect But Decent Concept 3.5 stars in reality,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,1587,"['Decent', 'anime', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'concept', 'voids', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'realize', 'idea', 'very', 'well', 'graphics', 'Also', 'things', 'mechs', 'are', 'generic', 'looking', 'not', 'ordinary', 'design', 'perspective.The', 'main', 'complaint', 'i', 'have', 'watching', 'complete', 'anime', 'part', '1', '2', 'music', 'just', ""n't"", 'set', 'tone', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'horrible', 'singing', 'portion', 'theme', 'Inori', 'singing', 'Supercell', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bill', 'main', 'theme', 'song', 'just', 'irritating', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'hear', 'over', 'again', 'skip', 'opening', 'sequence', 'avoid', 'it.The', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'ok', 'story', 'fair', 'degree', 'i', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'anything', 'strong', 'one', 'character', 'other', 'Shu', 'sense', 'lot', 'focus', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'anime', 'depth', 'toss', 'guy', 'blond', 'government', 'type', 'attack', 'dog', 'blond', 'guy', 'generic', 'forget', 'never', 'remembered', 'name', 'mech', 'kills', 'infected', 'citizens', 'are', 'threatening', 'scum', 'be', 'feared', 'loathed', 'never', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'just', 'seemed', 'same', 'guy', 'Escaflowne', 'Last', 'Exiles', 'Dio', 'just', 'tossed', 'mix', 'kind', 'how', 'lot', 'characters', 'come', 'anime', 'overall.Oh', 'yeah', 'extra', 'art', 'booklets', 'are', 'excellent', 'few', 'pages', 'two', 'beautiful', 'little', 'books', 'big', 'plus', 'bought', 'part', '1', '2', 'enough', 'room', 'art', 'sleeve', 'hold', 'everything', 'other', 'collection', 'box/art', 'sleeves']",N/A

1651023,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00CU6WAO6,Stephen M. Lerch,"[3, 3]","Great animation. Good story. Likeable characters. Guilty Crown is worth a purchase or at least a viewing. If you want to sample the show before buying, I believe FUNimation still offers it for free streaming, so try before you buy.Animation is done by Production IG and looks really, really good.The story goes that Shu gets caught up in a shadow organization trying to right the wrongs of the Japanese government. He winds up with a genetic enhancement that he was supposed to deliver to the shadow organization (called Funeral Parlor). This power allows him to pull weapons (and some defensive items) out of whomever seems to be around at the moment of need. Funeral Parlor is fighting to stop those running GHQ (a temporary government overseeing Japan after Japan was infected with a killer virus) from destroying the population of not just Japan, but all of the earth.Video:I only watched the Blu Ray and spot checked the DVD. The Blu Ray is AVC encoded and was originally animated in 2011/2012, so was created digitally. The animation is smooth, the bit rate is high and there are no video blemishes to be seen. The DVD quality is MPEG video and looks really good for a DVD.There isn't anything amazing about the encode or the show itself that would lend this to being an Anime to showcase your awesome home theater system, but it's rock solid regardless.Audio:You have two options. You can watch in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD in English or Dolby TrueHD in stereo for the Japanese language track. The English track uses the 5.1 sound stage nicely, and doesn't overpower you with effects all over the place all the time. The acting is OK as well, so that's a plus.The Japanese language tracks seems to be a bit quieter than the English track (I've noticed a slight difference in other FUNi releases in the past as well). This is no problem, just turn up the volume. The stereo sound stage has really good separation as well, so there's another plus.Subtitles aren't 100% direct translations, but do a really good job of mimicking the intent of the original. Very good.Extras:So if you buy the LE of the set, you get a very nice, high quality chipboard box to hold the 2 releases of the series in. Also included is a pretty nice book that includes character sketches and similar. I'm not sure the higher price is really justified with these extras, but they are very nice regardless. If you are a big fan of the series, the price is DEFINITELY worth paying for the box and especially the booklet, no question there.Promo videos, clean op/ending and the US trailer. English language commentaries on 2 episodes.Over all the video extras are worth a viewing and if you like to listen to English language commentaries and gain some insight into the dubbing process, and a little on the show, definitely worth a listen.Overall:Guilty Crown's story is good, a little cliched but good. The animation, being Production IG, is really good as well. Audio is solid and the video is solid as well.Recommended.",4,"Great mastering, OK story",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,2990,"['Great', 'animation', 'Good', 'story', 'Likeable', 'characters', 'Guilty', 'Crown', 'purchase', 'least', 'viewing', 'want', 'sample', 'show', 'buying', 'believe', 'FUNimation', 'still', 'free', 'streaming', 'so', 'try', 'buy.Animation', 'done', 'Production', 'IG', 'really', 'really', 'good.The', 'story', 'Shu', 'caught', 'up', 'shadow', 'organization', 'trying', 'right', 'wrongs', 'Japanese', 'government', 'up', 'genetic', 'enhancement', 'was', 'supposed', 'deliver', 'shadow', 'organization', 'called', 'Funeral', 'Parlor', 'power', 'pull', 'weapons', 'defensive', 'items', 'whomever', 'be', 'around', 'moment', 'need', 'Funeral', 'Parlor', 'fighting', 'stop', 'running', 'GHQ', 'temporary', 'government', 'overseeing', 'Japan', 'Japan', 'was', 'infected', 'killer', 'virus', 'destroying', 'population', 'not', 'just', 'Japan', 'earth.Video', 'only', 'watched', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'spot', 'checked', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'AVC', 'encoded', 'was', 'originally', 'animated', '2011/2012', 'so', 'was', 'created', 'digitally', 'animation', 'smooth', 'bit', 'rate', 'high', 'are', 'video', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD', 'quality', 'MPEG', 'video', 'really', 'good', 'DVD.There', ""n't"", 'anything', 'amazing', 'encode', 'show', 'would', 'lend', 'being', 'Anime', 'showcase', 'awesome', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'rock', 'solid', 'regardless.Audio', 'have', 'two', 'options', 'can', 'watch', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'English', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'stereo', 'Japanese', 'language', 'track', 'English', 'track', '5.1', 'sound', 'stage', 'nicely', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'effects', 'place', 'time', 'acting', 'OK', 'as', 'well', 'plus.The', 'Japanese', 'language', 'tracks', 'be', 'bit', 'quieter', 'English', 'track', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'slight', 'difference', 'other', 'FUNi', 'releases', 'past', 'well', 'problem', 'just', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'stereo', 'sound', 'stage', 'really', 'good', 'separation', 'well', 'plus.Subtitles', 'are', ""n't"", '100', '%', 'direct', 'translations', 'do', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'mimicking', 'intent', 'original', 'Very', 'good.Extras', 'So', 'buy', 'LE', 'set', 'get', 'very', 'nice', 'high', 'quality', 'chipboard', 'box', 'hold', '2', 'releases', 'series', 'Also', 'included', 'pretty', 'nice', 'book', 'character', 'sketches', 'similar', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'higher', 'price', 'really', 'justified', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'regardless', 'are', 'big', 'fan', 'series', 'price', 'DEFINITELY', 'worth', 'paying', 'box', 'especially', 'booklet', 'question', 'there.Promo', 'videos', 'clean', 'op/ending', 'US', 'trailer', 'English', 'language', 'commentaries', '2', 'episodes.Over', 'video', 'extras', 'are', 'viewing', 'like', 'listen', 'English', 'language', 'commentaries', 'gain', 'insight', 'dubbing', 'process', 'little', 'show', 'definitely', 'listen.Overall', 'Guilty', 'Crown', 'story', 'good', 'little', 'cliched', 'good', 'animation', 'being', 'Production', 'IG', 'really', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'Audio', 'solid', 'video', 'solid', 'well.Recommended']",N/A
