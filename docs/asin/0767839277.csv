21853,A11JZYOPFMDGXW,0767839277,"A Quiet Conscience ""Q.C.""","[1, 2]","We enjoy this film in our house and the music is very cute, Elmo is sweet, his little adventure into Grouchland is fun and all of the good things you come to expect from Sesame Street. There is one thing that stands out as being kind of wonky, though: Elmo happens upon Zoe, who is crying because her father had to work and couldn't take her out. Elmo consoles her by allowing her to hold his precious blanket and when he decides he'd like it back, she replies, ""In a minute, Elmo."" So Elmo says, ""Elmo wants his blanket back now."" The ensuing tug of war ends up with a rip in the blanket which then gets lost in a series of unfortunate events. The problem here is that when Elmo asked for his blanket back, Zoe should have given it to him and thanked him rather than insisting on holding it to the point where he had to forcibly try to reclaim it. Now the blanket also wouldn't have ripped if Zoe hadn't been fighting to hold onto an item that wasn't hers and which had been requested returned by the owner. I think the story goes on to teach kids to not be selfish and greedy like Huxley, and at one point the Queen of Trash compares Elmo to Huxley because Elmo wanted his own blanket back. There's a difference between Huxley, who took anything and everything and made it his, and Elmo who rightfully owned his blanket. Kids shouldn't be forced to share. Kids should not be taught that anyone OWES them their stuff, that when they borrow something they can refuse to return it and so on. Ultimately the film is cute and had some funny bits and nice songs, but the message is a real stinker.",4,Forcing kids to share?,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,1593,"['enjoy', 'film', 'house', 'music', 'very', 'cute', 'Elmo', 'sweet', 'little', 'adventure', 'Grouchland', 'fun', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'expect', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'one', 'thing', 'out', 'being', 'kind', 'wonky', 'Elmo', 'Zoe', 'who', 'crying', 'father', 'had', 'work', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'out', 'Elmo', 'consoles', 'allowing', 'hold', 'precious', 'blanket', 'when', ""'d"", 'like', 'back', 'minute', 'Elmo', 'Elmo', 'Elmo', 'blanket', 'back', 'now', 'ensuing', 'tug', 'war', 'up', 'rip', 'blanket', 'then', 'lost', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'problem', 'here', 'when', 'Elmo', 'asked', 'blanket', 'back', 'Zoe', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'thanked', 'rather', 'insisting', 'holding', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'forcibly', 'try', 'reclaim', 'Now', 'blanket', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'ripped', 'Zoe', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'fighting', 'hold', 'item', 'was', ""n't"", 'hers', 'had', 'been', 'requested', 'returned', 'owner', 'think', 'story', 'teach', 'kids', 'not', 'be', 'selfish', 'greedy', 'Huxley', 'one', 'point', 'Queen', 'Trash', 'Elmo', 'Huxley', 'Elmo', 'wanted', 'own', 'blanket', 'back', 'difference', 'Huxley', 'who', 'took', 'anything', 'everything', 'made', 'Elmo', 'who', 'rightfully', 'owned', 'blanket', 'Kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'forced', 'share', 'Kids', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taught', 'anyone', 'OWES', 'stuff', 'when', 'borrow', 'something', 'can', 'refuse', 'return', 'so', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'cute', 'had', 'funny', 'bits', 'nice', 'songs', 'message', 'real', 'stinker']",The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland

21859,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0767839277,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 14]","Never let it be said that I've forgotten the way to Sesame Street.  It had been quite a while since my last visit, but it was great to see all of the familiar faces again: Bert & Ernie, The Count, Grover, Oscar, Big Bird, etc.  I was rather surprised to see that some of the human actors I remember are still Sesame Street regulars, as well.  Then there's Elmo.  Up until now, I only knew Elmo from all the commercials for Elmo-related products, so it was good to finally see just what all the fuss has been about.  He's a cool little monster, and it's easy to see how he has become so popular with the youngsters; I especially love the way he always refers to himself in the third person.  I also was gratified to find out just what lies inside and beneath Oscar's garbage can after all these years.  Throw in some music and dancing as well as a couple of notable guest appearances, and you've got yourself a movie I really enjoyed.Elmo really loves his blanket, and he could never bear to part with it.  He loves it so much that he doesn't want to share it, even for a few minutes, with one of his little friends.  About this time, a series of humorous mishaps occur to land Blanket (it's essentially a character rather than an object) inside Oscar's garbage can.  Elmo dives it to get it, only to be transported (along with Blanket) to Grouchland.  This is a strange new world for Elmo, a place where you aren't supposed to ask for help or be kind to others.  Elmo's beloved blanket ends up in the hands of the mean and greedy Huxley (Mandy Patinkin), a man who lives by the creed ""Whatever I touch is mine.""  In order to get to Huxley's house and reclaim what is his, Elmo must overcome a number of challenges placed in his way and must even pass the ultimate challenge of the Queen of Garbage (Vanessa Williams).  There is of course a message to the whole story, with children (and adults) seeing why it is important to share what you have rather than be greedy.I'm not sure I would have wanted to see The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland at the theatre, but youngsters would surely have loved such an experience.  Elmo asks the audience for help on several occasions, so parents should be prepared for having their kids yell out helpful words and sounds from time to time (FYI - I wouldn't recommend sitting directly in front of your children during the Queen of Trash sequence).  Parents also shouldn't worry too much about children becoming too upset over Elmo's misfortunes.  Whenever things start to look bad, Bert comes out and has the movie stopped and Ernie explains to him that there's still time for a happy ending.I have to say I really loved this movie.  It is funny, the musical scenes are quite good, and I can't get enough of seeing Elmo getting down with his bad self.  This movie has everything that makes Sesame Street so great, and now I'm wishing I would have bought the DVD instead of just renting it.",5,Now I know why Elmo is so popular,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,2927,"['Never', 'let', 'be', 'said', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'way', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'had', 'been', 'quite', 'while', 'last', 'visit', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'familiar', 'again', 'Bert', 'Ernie', 'Count', 'Grover', 'Oscar', 'Big', 'Bird', 'etc', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'see', 'human', 'actors', 'remember', 'are', 'still', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'regulars', 'as', 'well', 'Then', 'Elmo', 'now', 'only', 'knew', 'Elmo', 'commercials', 'Elmo-related', 'products', 'was', 'good', 'finally', 'see', 'just', 'what', 'fuss', 'been', 'about', 'cool', 'little', 'monster', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'youngsters', 'especially', 'love', 'way', 'always', 'third', 'person', 'also', 'was', 'gratified', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'inside', 'beneath', 'Oscar', 'garbage', 'can', 'years', 'Throw', 'music', 'dancing', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'notable', 'guest', 'appearances', ""'ve"", 'got', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed.Elmo', 'really', 'blanket', 'could', 'never', 'bear', 'part', 'so', 'much', ""n't"", 'want', 'share', 'even', 'few', 'minutes', 'one', 'little', 'friends', 'time', 'series', 'humorous', 'mishaps', 'occur', 'land', 'Blanket', 'essentially', 'character', 'rather', 'object', 'Oscar', 'garbage', 'can', 'Elmo', 'get', 'only', 'be', 'transported', 'Blanket', 'Grouchland', 'strange', 'new', 'world', 'Elmo', 'place', 'where', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'ask', 'help', 'be', 'kind', 'others', 'Elmo', 'beloved', 'blanket', 'up', 'hands', 'mean', 'greedy', 'Huxley', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'man', 'who', 'creed', 'touch', 'mine', 'order', 'get', 'Huxley', 'house', 'reclaim', 'what', 'Elmo', 'must', 'overcome', 'number', 'challenges', 'placed', 'way', 'must', 'even', 'pass', 'ultimate', 'challenge', 'Queen', 'Garbage', 'Vanessa', 'Williams', 'course', 'message', 'whole', 'story', 'children', 'adults', 'seeing', 'why', 'important', 'share', 'what', 'have', 'rather', 'be', 'greedy.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'Adventures', 'Elmo', 'Grouchland', 'theatre', 'youngsters', 'would', 'surely', 'have', 'loved', 'experience', 'Elmo', 'audience', 'help', 'several', 'occasions', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'prepared', 'having', 'kids', 'yell', 'out', 'helpful', 'words', 'sounds', 'time', 'time', 'FYI', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'sitting', 'directly', 'front', 'children', 'Queen', 'Trash', 'sequence', 'Parents', 'also', 'should', ""n't"", 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'children', 'becoming', 'too', 'upset', 'over', 'Elmo', 'misfortunes', 'Whenever', 'things', 'start', 'look', 'bad', 'Bert', 'out', 'movie', 'stopped', 'Ernie', 'still', 'time', 'happy', 'ending.I', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'funny', 'musical', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'seeing', 'Elmo', 'getting', 'down', 'bad', 'self', 'movie', 'everything', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'so', 'great', 'now', ""'m"", 'wishing', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'instead', 'just', 'renting']",The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland

Explain to me, even more, what Mandy Patinkin was thinking. (Vanessa Williams barely rates a mention, and here it is, now forget she exists.)It's become obvious down through the years that, as cartoons list  their stylish subtlety and went increasingly towards a specific aim at the  juvenile crowd, that Jim Henson and his band of merry monsters would take  up the slack that the golden age of Warner Brothers and Looney Toons had  left-- material that was aimed at kids, but with enough adult-oriented  material to keep the adults watching, as well. (Go back and watch those old  cartoons. You'll be amazed at what passed you over when you were a tot that  you find hilarious now, such as Porky Pig's many jabs at Hitler.) Henson's  bunch created two of television's finest, and most underrated, variety  shows, The Muppet Show and Muppets Tonight, both of which played the  balance between kid-oriented slapstick and more adult humor that could have  come straight from the joke book of Don Rickles. And when they started  making movies, they opted for the same approach, and when parents went to  see The Muppet Movie with the little ones, they ended up laughing just as  much.When Jim Henson died, Brian took over, and the Creature Factory  was born. Muppets in Space proved that the son had capably stepped into the  shoes of the father. And now... we get this sickly, stupid, ungainly,  ludicrous mess that can only be called a film because somewhere someone is  burning miles of celluloid with these images on it. At least, I fervently  hope so. Even the kids in the audience (all four of them) were relatively  bored with this pathetic attempt at making a kid-friendly version of The  Rocky Horror Picture Show (with audience participation and all). We're long  past the point where we feel we need to overly simplify moral lessons for  kids, aren't we? Yet the &quot;learning&quot; imparted in this film  sounds-- and smells-- like a dead haddock hitting you in the face.If  your kid is the world's biggest Elmo fanatic, wait until the video comes  out, and then tape it off PBS. But my kid is probably #2, and at least  twice she asked &quot;is it time to go home yet?&quot; (This is a kid who  sat through A Bug's Life and The Wizard of Oz with no problems, mind you.)

It is about Elmo, and  how he gets in a fight with his friend over sharing his blanket. Well, alot  of things go wrong and Elmo's blanket ends up at Grouch's trashcan. The  Grouch throws the blanket down the garbage can and Elmo dives in after it,  only to realize that it has been spirited to a place called Grouchland.  What he dosen't know is that Grouchland is being ruled over by a guy named  Huxley who has a problem with sharing things, and he has been stealing from  the townsfolk, always telling them, &quot;If I touch it...it's MINE!&quot;  Elmo has to figure out how to get his blanket back, with the help of many  colorful characters. The whole movie is great for small children. It  teaches them the value of friendship and sharing, which is something they  need to know about at a young age. The movie also allows the children to  participate in certain scenes (ex. singing along, helping Elmo to blow  raspberries, helping Elmo find his way through a dark cave). Overall, this  is a great movie for children, and I really did enjoy it, which is why I  have to recommend it!",5,Great kid's flick,965865600,"08 10, 2000",2000,1214,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'small', 'children', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'cute', 'entertaining', 'Elmo', 'how', 'fight', 'friend', 'sharing', 'blanket', 'Well', 'alot', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Elmo', 'blanket', 'up', 'Grouch', 'trashcan', 'Grouch', 'blanket', 'down', 'garbage', 'can', 'Elmo', 'dives', 'only', 'realize', 'been', 'spirited', 'place', 'called', 'Grouchland', 'What', 'dose', ""n't"", 'know', 'Grouchland', 'being', 'ruled', 'over', 'guy', 'named', 'Huxley', 'who', 'problem', 'sharing', 'things', 'been', 'stealing', 'townsfolk', 'always', 'telling', 'quot', 'touch', 'MINE', 'quot', 'Elmo', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'blanket', 'back', 'help', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', 'small', 'children', 'value', 'friendship', 'sharing', 'something', 'need', 'know', 'about', 'young', 'age', 'movie', 'also', 'children', 'participate', 'certain', 'scenes', 'ex', 'singing', 'along', 'helping', 'Elmo', 'blow', 'raspberries', 'helping', 'Elmo', 'find', 'way', 'dark', 'cave', 'Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'children', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'why', 'have', 'recommend']",The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland

However, I do love Sesame Street and have enjoyed just about everything I have ever seen that featured the Muppets. So, I watched THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND with an open mind full of trepidation.I was rather surprised. Elmo didn't seem as annoying as he usually is. The movie was fun and though meant for children, contained several points of humor for parents and other adults (the Sesame Street gang is largely a group of Muppets after all). There was a nice moral and the guest peformances of Mandy Patinkin as the evil Huxley and Vanessa Villiams as the Queen of Trash were rather enjoyable and added a touch of class (another Muppet trait) to the movie. I especially liked the breaks in the film by Bert and Ernie that may help ease the youngest child's fears, but also provide some great comic relief for nostalgic adults.A delightful film that most children 5 and under will probably enjoy.",4,Better Than Expected.,1043539200,"01 26, 2003",2003,1049,"['know', 'most', 'toddlers', 'preschoolers', 'seem', 'love', 'Elmo', 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'furry', 'red', 'monster', 'Muppet', 'much', 'However', 'do', 'love', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'everything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'featured', 'Muppets', 'So', 'watched', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'ELMO', 'IN', 'GROUCHLAND', 'open', 'mind', 'full', 'trepidation.I', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'Elmo', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'annoying', 'usually', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'meant', 'children', 'contained', 'several', 'points', 'humor', 'parents', 'other', 'adults', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'gang', 'largely', 'group', 'Muppets', 'was', 'nice', 'moral', 'guest', 'peformances', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'evil', 'Huxley', 'Vanessa', 'Villiams', 'Queen', 'Trash', 'were', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'added', 'touch', 'class', 'Muppet', 'trait', 'movie', 'especially', 'liked', 'breaks', 'film', 'Bert', 'Ernie', 'may', 'help', 'ease', 'youngest', 'child', 'fears', 'also', 'provide', 'great', 'comic', 'relief', 'nostalgic', 'adults.A', 'delightful', 'film', 'most', 'children', '5', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy']",The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland
