747019,A2WTN1GAIBOZU,B00008RH1F,J. Pinkerton Snoopington,"[3, 3]","First things first: &quot;Hand of Death&quot; is packed to the gills with fight scenes. I don't think five minutes go by without there being a fight. The fights (choreographed by none other than Jackie Chan) are well-done, too, and they usually go on for extended periods of time. With that out of the way, I might as well say that the plot (about a woman, yawn, avenging someone's death) is weak and the comedy regrettable, but, really, who cares? Lots of people get kicked in the head. If you can find this for $4, like I did, you'll have fun.The DVD from Ground Zero's Wu-Tang Clan line has the image in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, severely cropped from its probable 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is scratchy and faded - not a surprise for something found in the bargain bin. The audio is dubbed, which sort of adds to the movie's campy charm.There are surprisingly quite a few extras, the best of which are a bunch of bonus fight scenes from other Ground Zero releases. There's also a featurette called &quot;Secrets of the Young Master&quot; (basically, a guy showing some kung-fu moves), a Wu-Tang Clan music video, and a few Ground Zero trailers.",3,Satisfyingly Fight-Filled Kung Fu Movie,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,1151,"['First', 'things', 'first', 'quot', 'Hand', 'Death', 'quot', 'packed', 'gills', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'five', 'minutes', 'go', 'being', 'fight', 'fights', 'choreographed', 'none', 'other', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'are', 'well-done', 'too', 'usually', 'go', 'extended', 'periods', 'time', 'way', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'plot', 'woman', 'yawn', 'avenging', 'someone', 'death', 'weak', 'comedy', 'regrettable', 'really', 'who', 'Lots', 'people', 'get', 'kicked', 'head', 'can', 'find', '4', 'did', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun.The', 'DVD', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'Wu-Tang', 'Clan', 'line', 'image', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'severely', 'cropped', 'probable', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'image', 'scratchy', 'faded', 'not', 'surprise', 'something', 'found', 'bargain', 'bin', 'audio', 'dubbed', 'sort', 'movie', 'campy', 'charm.There', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'quite', 'few', 'extras', 'best', 'are', 'bunch', 'bonus', 'fight', 'scenes', 'other', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'also', 'featurette', 'called', 'quot', 'Secrets', 'Young', 'Master', 'quot', 'basically', 'guy', 'showing', 'kung-fu', 'moves', 'Wu-Tang', 'Clan', 'music', 'video', 'few', 'Ground', 'Zero', 'trailers']",Dance of Death

I though this flick was just o.k,,,,I'm a big fan of the ""crazy horse kung fu"", which is very rare in kung fu movies. This movie highlighted that kung fu style very nicely I though,,,however, I felt it went over-board in the final fight scene, which resulted the fight became extremely boaring,,,I swear,,this went on for approximately 20 mins. That is why I ended up giving this film a 3 star.  However, the choreography was nicely done.",3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!",1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,530,"['flick', 'was', 'directed', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Dance', 'Death', 'could', 'have', 'been', '4', 'star', 'easily', 'flick', 'was', 'just', 'o.k', ',I', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'crazy', 'horse', 'kung', 'fu', 'very', 'rare', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'movie', 'highlighted', 'kung', 'fu', 'style', 'very', 'nicely', 'however', 'felt', 'went', 'over-board', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'resulted', 'fight', 'became', 'extremely', 'boaring', 'swear', ',this', 'went', 'approximately', '20', 'mins', 'why', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'film', '3', 'star', 'However', 'choreography', 'was', 'nicely', 'done']",Dance of Death
747022,APIW11UEPKIC2,B00008RH1F,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[1, 1]","Angela Mao first of all plays a man in this movie.  It just didn't make sense to me.  If they would have at least made a joke out of it ONCE I would have been fine with it but she plays a man the whole movie from what I can tell.  Now apart from that the story is not outstanding but does manage to make sense for the most part.  The only reason I say for the most part is because there is a scene about 20 minutes in where Angela Mao is with her father and then the crazy horse gang shows up to help out another gang kill Mao's father.  It is a misplaced scene.  The movie starts out with her meeting 2 kung fu masters who have been trying to find out for many years who is better.  Mao decides to learn form them in hopes of helping them resolve this issue and learn more styles for hherself(himself I guess). The scene with Mao's father and then another one right afer just seem injected even though they don't fit into the sotry chronologically.  Right after Mao's dad is killed they go into a scene where she doesn't even  know kung fu.  It is hard to explain but there are 2 scenes out of place and this actually seems to be a director's touch from what I can tell.  This problem is the same with any version ever found of this movie.  Now Jackie Chan does not direct this but he is the action director.  He used the alias Chen Lung a few times and his choreography is easy to spot with the patented comeic kung fu he used around the year 1980.  While the action is for the most part average, Angela Mao is great, there is a TON of fighting, and the white haired villian and his crazy horse kung fu are very good.  You will also recognize the short kung fu master who Mao learns from from the movie 'Fighting Ace' with Mr right-leg John Liu.  He provides some of the good comedy in the film and helps to makes it watchable.The version that I have viewed is the Wu Tang Clan version from Groundzero.  It has bad picture quality, is full screened, and is cut by at least 5 minutes.  The Crash Cinema version is uncut and is widescreened with MUCH better picture quality.  Obviously you can tell which version I would recommend.",2,Good action with Angela Mao Ying but just a poor film,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2131,"['Angela', 'Mao', 'first', 'man', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'made', 'joke', 'ONCE', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'man', 'whole', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'Now', 'apart', 'story', 'not', 'outstanding', 'manage', 'make', 'sense', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'reason', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'scene', '20', 'minutes', 'where', 'Angela', 'Mao', 'father', 'then', 'crazy', 'horse', 'gang', 'up', 'help', 'out', 'gang', 'kill', 'Mao', 'father', 'misplaced', 'scene', 'movie', 'out', 'meeting', '2', 'kung', 'fu', 'masters', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'who', 'better', 'Mao', 'learn', 'form', 'hopes', 'helping', 'resolve', 'issue', 'learn', 'more', 'styles', 'hherself', 'guess', 'scene', 'Mao', 'father', 'then', 'one', 'right', 'afer', 'just', 'seem', 'injected', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'sotry', 'chronologically', 'Right', 'Mao', 'dad', 'killed', 'go', 'scene', 'where', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'kung', 'fu', 'hard', 'explain', 'are', '2', 'scenes', 'place', 'actually', 'be', 'director', 'touch', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'problem', 'same', 'version', 'ever', 'found', 'movie', 'Now', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'not', 'direct', 'action', 'director', 'used', 'alias', 'Chen', 'Lung', 'few', 'times', 'choreography', 'easy', 'spot', 'patented', 'comeic', 'kung', 'fu', 'used', 'year', '1980', 'action', 'most', 'part', 'average', 'Angela', 'Mao', 'great', 'TON', 'fighting', 'white', 'haired', 'villian', 'crazy', 'horse', 'kung', 'fu', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'also', 'recognize', 'short', 'kung', 'fu', 'master', 'who', 'Mao', 'movie', ""'Fighting"", 'Ace', 'Mr', 'right-leg', 'John', 'Liu', 'good', 'comedy', 'film', 'watchable.The', 'version', 'have', 'viewed', 'Wu', 'Tang', 'Clan', 'version', 'Groundzero', 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'full', 'screened', 'cut', 'least', '5', 'minutes', 'Crash', 'Cinema', 'version', 'uncut', 'widescreened', 'MUCH', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'Obviously', 'can', 'tell', 'version', 'would', 'recommend']",Dance of Death
