829293,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B0002B14UC,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[1, 1]","I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories. This one seems very, very real. And it is very, very potent medicine.Coming so soon after ""American History X,"" I'm still mystified about the whole gang phenomenon, but Stan ""Tookie"" Williams (played with incredible energy by Jamie Foxx) has gone a long, long way to explain it to me. He was the founder of the Crips, the gang that consolidated many other gangs in Los Angeles, and eventually went national and apparently even international. But Tookie went to San Quentin's death row for the murder of four men in gang violence.Enter Professor Barbara Bechnel (played by Lynn Whitfield), who has a teenage son she's terribly worried about. She wants to write a book about Tookie and the origins of the Crips. But when she goes to Quentin to visit him, she gradually finds that there's a lot more going on here than a biography. He wants to write books for children warning them away from gangs, and against her literary agent's advice, she does it.Despite the title, the movie is not particularly religious in nature. Tookie is a theist, but not a church member. His attitude is that he must face God on his own.Powerful movie; powerful enough that I'm determined to look for those books.",5,Not Really a Religious Story,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1236,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'movies', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'very', 'potent', 'medicine.Coming', 'so', 'soon', 'American', 'History', 'X', ""'m"", 'still', 'mystified', 'whole', 'gang', 'phenomenon', 'Stan', 'Tookie', 'Williams', 'played', 'incredible', 'energy', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'gone', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'explain', 'was', 'founder', 'Crips', 'gang', 'consolidated', 'many', 'other', 'gangs', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'eventually', 'went', 'national', 'apparently', 'even', 'international', 'Tookie', 'went', 'San', 'Quentin', 'death', 'row', 'murder', 'four', 'men', 'gang', 'violence.Enter', 'Professor', 'Barbara', 'Bechnel', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'who', 'teenage', 'son', 'terribly', 'worried', 'write', 'book', 'Tookie', 'origins', 'Crips', 'when', 'Quentin', 'visit', 'gradually', 'lot', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'biography', 'write', 'books', 'children', 'warning', 'away', 'gangs', 'literary', 'agent', 'advice', 'it.Despite', 'title', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'religious', 'nature', 'Tookie', 'theist', 'not', 'church', 'member', 'attitude', 'must', 'face', 'God', 'own.Powerful', 'movie', 'powerful', ""'m"", 'determined', 'look', 'books']",N/A
829294,A209QRVZ99UQDC,B0002B14UC,Calamity Jane,"[3, 5]","Hollywood places Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams on a pedestal and raises him to Heaven. They gloss over the violence and murders committed by Williams, and focus solely on his book-writing achievements and his quest to save the children.  Hollywood portrays him as a victim of injustice, not only from society, but from prison officials as well. The correction officers are almost subliminally shown as dark, evil and uneducated characters who pale in William's ""light"" and wisdom.  He is the perpetrator of peace, the savior of innocent gang kids, and a lover and follower of God. Pathetic, to say the least.The perceived message is that Tookie redeemed himself through his writings. The question remains, from whom did he find that redemption, and how? Are we to believe that his books cancel out his killing spree?The horror of William's crimes make this a very difficult movie to like. If you can separate Tookie's deeds from Jamie Fox's portrayal of the man, and Hollywood's attempt to conceal the crimes of this mass murderer while demonizing society at the same time, you may enjoy the movie.

Karasik,"[1, 6]","This film based on the life of gang cofounder and death row inmate Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams is inherently fascinating (how often does a murderer get nominated for a Nobel Prize?), but the icing on the cake is that the acting, cinematography, and editing on this film are also excellent.  There are a number of fine films about prison inmates (""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"" come to mind), and this one holds its own, most impressively because it is a true story.  Perhaps we're drawn to this genre because we are reminded of how amazing life is and how much of it we take for granted.

This movie is certainly not a prison film. If your looking for a great prison film I suggest ""Lockdown"" with Master P. Also if you have hopes of seeing gang violence, you wont see much in this film. Personaly, I think this film could have benefited from having more action and showing some of Williams past gang violence. A film like ""American History X"" did a great job of blending violence and action with regret and reform better then this film. This film at times Romanticized Williams way too much (showing him as the hero and victim of society figure).Overall, this is a very good made for TV movie, but you should be warned that this film is more drama then action. I liked the movie and I will keep it in my collection, but I felt that I should warn others that this film is not the action film you might expect. There is no way I can give this movie 5 stars. Although the reformed leader of the crips may not want to glorify violence in this movie (which is why there's hardly any), it's still neccessary to portray the full story. The director rushed passed all of Tookies wrongs and only showed his rights. How can we understand the full message of redemption if we dont know what he is remorseful about? Throughout the entire film we never hear one time what he is in prison for.

Boy that was interesting to see it. I haven't even bought the DVD yet, but once I'll get it, I'll see it's still good since it aired on FX Networks. It also features Lynn Whitfield (one of my all-time girls and definitely a good actor) does play the client who interviews Tookie about where he begin as a child, how his childhood became a mess, and why did he shoot somebody, and soon end up in jail for doing that. Y'know long story short. I actually liked to say thanks to Jamie Foxx for doing such a good job on this movie and congrats on him winning an Oscar for the first time on his role on ""Ray"", the biopic on the life of the legend himself. Ok that's all I gotta 4. After that, I'ma read his memoir and then tell all the details about him.

829301,AOSF1U99TAISB,B0002B14UC,maze,"[33, 48]","I work in an anti-gang program and alot of people around me disagree, but this is what I feel: If Tookie's anti-gang work meant anything at all, he should take the punishment that was given to him like a man. He should take a stand and be the example to the youths and gang memebers by showing them what will happen to them if they continue.....THEN he can get his Nobel Peace Prize. Otherwise, we are just influenced that he was bored in jail all these years with nothing else to do.  As usual, the victims are forgotten.  There is no bringing back his innocent victims, they are gone forever, and there would be no justice for their families. And for the people that are rallying to stop his execution - what if it was one of your family members that was killed by him, would you be supporting him then ?  I dont think so.  I understand that cultures have their ways and people do what they do to survive, but in no way should that lifestyle be glamourized to the extent that it is today.  We've got to stop seeing gang members, drug dealers, pimps, etc as heroes.  Everyone is on the African-American tip these days, but this is not about racism, or being on their side, this side or that side.  When it comes to being so inhumane as to end someone's life, there is no 'side', that is a crime against human nature.  Jamie Foxx is an excellent actor, but he's got to stop and think what he's doing - if that was one of his family members that was killed by Tookie, i bet you he would not be promoting his clemency.  I say all this because of our children, our youths.  They have such limited freedom these days, and its a shame that they cannot experience the wonderful childhood that most of us adults in our 30's (and above) had when we were children.",3,THIS MAN SHOULD TAKE THE STAND AND BE AN EXAMPLE,1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,1755,"['work', 'anti-gang', 'program', 'alot', 'people', 'disagree', 'what', 'feel', 'Tookie', 'anti-gang', 'work', 'meant', 'anything', 'should', 'take', 'punishment', 'was', 'given', 'man', 'should', 'take', 'stand', 'be', 'example', 'youths', 'gang', 'memebers', 'showing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'continue', 'can', 'get', 'Nobel', 'Peace', 'Prize', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'just', 'influenced', 'was', 'bored', 'jail', 'years', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'usual', 'victims', 'are', 'forgotten', 'bringing', 'back', 'innocent', 'victims', 'are', 'gone', 'forever', 'would', 'be', 'justice', 'families', 'people', 'are', 'rallying', 'stop', 'execution', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'was', 'killed', 'would', 'be', 'supporting', 'then', 'dont', 'think', 'so', 'understand', 'cultures', 'have', 'ways', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'survive', 'way', 'should', 'lifestyle', 'be', 'glamourized', 'extent', 'today', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stop', 'seeing', 'gang', 'members', 'drug', 'dealers', 'pimps', 'etc', 'heroes', 'Everyone', 'African-American', 'tip', 'days', 'not', 'racism', 'being', 'side', 'side', 'side', 'When', 'being', 'so', 'inhumane', 'end', 'someone', 'life', ""'side"", 'crime', 'human', 'nature', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'excellent', 'actor', 'got', 'stop', 'think', 'what', 'doing', 'was', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'was', 'killed', 'Tookie', 'i', 'bet', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'promoting', 'clemency', 'say', 'children', 'youths', 'have', 'such', 'limited', 'freedom', 'days', 'shame', 'can', 'not', 'experience', 'wonderful', 'childhood', 'most', 'adults', '30', 'above', 'had', 'when', 'were', 'children']",N/A

He's a man on death row and as he's thrown in solitary confinement his life takes on another level.  He's given a window to finally live.

This film based on the life of gang cofounder and death row inmate Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams.  What kept me so mesmerized was to the story was not only the great acting, but the fact that Mr. Williams truly realized the error of his way, he recognized his ignorance, and he was sorry, and he wanted to share his true story to prevent other young men from doing the same ignorant thing he did.  The very thing he started, he wanted to bring to an end.  The fact that someone in prison won a Nobel Peace Prize was amazing.  While watching this film you could feel the different emotions.  You can feel his anger, and then his remorse.  When you can feel emotion, you know you know you have yourself a good quality film, with good quality acting.

I thought that this movie was supposed to show gang life, how ""Tookie"" started his gang, his bad choices, what he actually did to get convicted, and some actual drama. But none of these are to be found in this movie.  What you get instead is an entire movie about Tookie being locked up in a cell where he speaks very, very low key to some lady who wants to listen to him and help him with his books.  And as for the violence in this movie, it is practically non-existant.  The so called violence in this movie lasts about 1 minute and is comprised of two separate fight sences, each lasting about half a minute each.  I truly think that the only people who would be interested in this movie would have to be die-hard fans of Jamie Fox.  If you are not a die-hard fan, I suggest that you save your money and your time and stay away from this movie that nearly puts you to sleep.I do have one last suggestion. If you want a really good movie about gangs, their theology, and about prison life, then you need to see ""American Me."" This movie is very well acted, full of drama, and has a great script. And by the way, it doesn't have a happy ending - but this is what is to be expected when one joins a gang - because gang members are not really your family or your friends.

829312,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0002B14UC,V. Marshall,"[15, 32]","WATCH THIS MOVIE because of its message and its importance in the death penalty debate within this country.Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams (Jamie Foxx) founded the LA gang ""The Crips"" as an outlet towards a violent and often un-regulated community. His intention was not to form a world of calculated killing but rather to protect his small part of the world. But unfortunately with power comes arrogance and violence begets additional violence. Williams lived a superficial life within this turmoil so the so-called monster that emerged should be no surprise. However Williams discovered his purpose and spirituality while confined within the walls of San Quentin Prison and I believe his life was redeemed. Through his writing with the help of journalist Barbara Becnel (Lynn Whitfield) he managed to bring moments of peace and brotherhood to many notorious gangs as his apology to society.Jamie Foxx is brilliant in his portrayal as `Tookie,"" capturing the essence of the man and providing a glimpse of what it must have been like to be Williams. Lynn Whitfield is as always wonderful in her role as the steadfast reporter who begins to see the human side of a world she once looked down upon. Brendan Jefferson emerges as the young ""Tookie"" and matches Foxx with his intensity. But it is the director Vondie Curtis-Hall who deserves a round of applause for bringing forth such a tragic and encouraging story about Williams who is now only a part of history. My only criticism on the film would be the fact that the evidence and crime that convicted ""Tookie"" were not really dealt with...for that we have court documents which are questionable at best.The death penalty debate will rein supreme after watching this important film especially now that ""Tookie"" has been executed. Is a life in prison for 25 years really the point at which a criminal should be put to death? While the victims that ""Tookie"" was convicted of killing can never speak is his death their only redemption? It seems that ""Tookie"" became a real man in the process of his life by overcoming a life of violence and external living and emerging a deeply reflective human being. It seems then that hard and fast rules about the death penalty cannot be cast in stone because some of our country's men are indeed redeemable after all. R.I.P. ""Tookie"" your last judge is before you!
