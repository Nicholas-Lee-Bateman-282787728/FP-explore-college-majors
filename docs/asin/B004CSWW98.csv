Now, I have been doing many courses from The Great Courses, and I find I really like history, particularly when I am not going to be tested on it!  This DVD set was a marvelous adjunct to the more formal course material, and it is good to see the same battles from numerous perspectives.  The price was excellent also - about half the price in most of the catalogs I receive.",5,Victory at Sea DVD,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,503,"['brother', 'used', 'watch', 'Victory', 'Sea', 'time', 'when', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'terribly', 'interested', 'point', 'Now', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'many', 'courses', 'Great', 'Courses', 'find', 'really', 'history', 'particularly', 'when', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'tested', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'marvelous', 'adjunct', 'more', 'formal', 'course', 'material', 'good', 'see', 'same', 'battles', 'numerous', 'perspectives', 'price', 'was', 'excellent', 'also', 'price', 'most', 'catalogs', 'receive']",Victory at Sea - The Emmy Award-Winning Series!

1396321,A84TOOCIEF6FX,B004CSWW98,David Webb,"[0, 0]","I saw this on TV when I was growing up in the 50s, and my brother bought the entire score for his reel to reel tape machine. My response is doubtless influenced by these factors. Yes, the narrative is a bit over the top, and it is partly propaganda. However, it is appropriate for the time. My brother served in the Korean War and it probably hit him at a deep level.There is a small section of the score that is transcendental. When I watched the film I saw that it corresponded to the end of the battle on Guadalcanal which was the turning point in the island land war. The musical score is a masterpiece by Richard Rodgers. I would urge people to buy the two CDs which stand on their own.I bought the HBO series ""The Pacific"" which is superb. Having lived in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, I can't imagine the courage and stamina that our Marines faced. Try digging a fox hole in coral or lava. Try crawling across these in blazing tropical heat!

But having said that; it is still a great set to have and the tin box it comes in is a nice addition as well. We also need to take in consideration that the demand for this set is most likely not all that great. I wonder if the Timeless Media Group listed Peter (not Leonard) Graves as the narrator on the 2-disc case to see if someone would notice; I did.I do really enjoy these because it reminds me of sitting with my dad in front of a black and white G.E television set and watching them, when they were 1st shown, back in the day. I spent 10 years in the U.S. Navy and I sometimes wonder if these awesome episodes influenced my decision to go into that branch of service.ANCHORS AWEIGH!",4,And now.......,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,749,"['transfer', 'film', 'DVD', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'having', 'said', 'still', 'great', 'set', 'have', 'tin', 'box', 'nice', 'addition', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'need', 'take', 'consideration', 'demand', 'set', 'most', 'likely', 'not', 'great', 'wonder', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'listed', 'Peter', 'not', 'Leonard', 'narrator', '2-disc', 'case', 'see', 'someone', 'would', 'notice', 'did.I', 'do', 'really', 'enjoy', 'sitting', 'dad', 'front', 'black', 'white', 'G.E', 'television', 'set', 'watching', 'when', 'were', '1st', 'shown', 'back', 'day', 'spent', '10', 'years', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'awesome', 'episodes', 'influenced', 'decision', 'go', 'branch', 'service.ANCHORS', 'AWEIGH']",Victory at Sea - The Emmy Award-Winning Series!
