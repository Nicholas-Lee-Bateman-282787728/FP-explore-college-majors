This film is a about a young beautiful German girl who is raped by 4 American soliders. In the town that she lives in, the local folks treat her like damaged goods and degrade her beyond belief. Douglas is brought in to slam the girl on the witness stand, and he does without a doubt. The ending is very sad but I couldn't truly find anything concrete about this film. Disappointing but the story is heartbreaking.",3,Strange little film.,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,593,"['Town', 'Without', 'Pity', 'film', 'mainly', 'known', 'Gene', 'Pitney', 'song', 'Town', 'Without', 'Pity', 'love', 'song', 'way', 'drama', 'moments', 'thanks', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'film', 'young', 'beautiful', 'German', 'girl', 'who', 'raped', '4', 'American', 'soliders', 'town', 'local', 'folks', 'treat', 'damaged', 'goods', 'degrade', 'belief', 'Douglas', 'brought', 'slam', 'girl', 'witness', 'stand', 'doubt', 'ending', 'very', 'sad', 'could', ""n't"", 'truly', 'find', 'anything', 'concrete', 'film', 'Disappointing', 'story', 'heartbreaking']",N/A
681162,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005S8KS,Annie Van Auken,"[2, 2]","In TOWN WITHOUT PITY (1961), director Gottfried Reinhardt uses some innovative techniques. For one, when the four prisoners charged with rape of a 16-year-old are interviewed, we see only portions of these, with one segueing into the next via quick crossfades. Also, since this picture is set in a German town near an American military base, much of the early scenes are in German. Instead of subtitles, one of the movie's characters, a young woman reporter, translates the on-screen dialogue (""She said: 'You're just a mama's boy!' ""). Although preferable to bad dubbing or the actors delivering their lines in German-accented English, it does seem rather peculiar.Dimitri Tiomkin, who's turned out so many memorable film scores, cheesed by on this one. The underlying music throughout is the title tune, introduced in the first reel via Gene Pitney's single playing on a tavern jukebox. There's even a ""Town Without Pity"" Twist. Feh!The injured girl in this story has enemies in her community: a voyeur that lives next door, an old woman who may be jealous of a remarkable beauty, her boyfriend's mother and perhaps her own father.Kirk Douglas as the soldiers' lawyer is a sort of sympathetic villain. He clearly doesn't like his clients, yet has a job to do-- a vigorous defense. Although he tries but fails to convince the young victim's father to not allow her to testify, Douglas ultimately destroys her credibility in court when she does take the stand. This event leads to a logically inevitable conclusion.As to the defendants:Frank Sutton (Sgt. Carter on TV'sGOMER PYLE, USMC) is properly repulsive as leader of the debauchers.Robert Blake (BARETTA) plays a remorseful man. He's branded an impotent nutcase by a defense shrink and reacts angrily to the charge.Richard Jaeckel seems to use his shielding of Blake from Sutton's cruel barbs as an excuse to feed some inner violent tendencies.Mal Sondock's character is a meat-headed cypher and of little consequence.The story itself is pure tragedy. After a river swim the girl is assaulted, and then undergoes a second attack in court. The four soldiers have justice served to them. The defense lawyer wins a partial victory but maybe loses his soul in the process. There's simply no winners here.Rating: 3 stars out of 5, only because calling such an exercise in several forms of inhumanity ""good"" just doesn't seem right somehow.",3,Pitiless against the pitiable,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,2389,"['TOWN', 'WITHOUT', 'PITY', '1961', 'director', 'Gottfried', 'Reinhardt', 'innovative', 'techniques', 'one', 'when', 'four', 'prisoners', 'charged', 'rape', '16-year-old', 'are', 'interviewed', 'see', 'only', 'portions', 'one', 'segueing', 'next', 'quick', 'crossfades', 'Also', 'picture', 'set', 'German', 'town', 'American', 'military', 'base', 'much', 'early', 'scenes', 'are', 'German', 'Instead', 'subtitles', 'one', 'movie', 'characters', 'young', 'woman', 'reporter', 'on-screen', 'dialogue', 'said', ""'You"", ""'re"", 'just', 'mama', 'boy', 'preferable', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'actors', 'delivering', 'lines', 'German-accented', 'English', 'seem', 'rather', 'peculiar.Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'film', 'scores', 'cheesed', 'one', 'underlying', 'music', 'title', 'tune', 'introduced', 'first', 'reel', 'Gene', 'Pitney', 'single', 'playing', 'tavern', 'jukebox', 'even', 'Town', 'Without', 'Pity', 'Twist', 'Feh', 'injured', 'girl', 'story', 'enemies', 'community', 'voyeur', 'next', 'door', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'jealous', 'remarkable', 'beauty', 'boyfriend', 'mother', 'perhaps', 'own', 'father.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'soldiers', 'lawyer', 'sort', 'sympathetic', 'villain', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'like', 'clients', 'yet', 'job', 'do', 'vigorous', 'defense', 'convince', 'young', 'victim', 'father', 'not', 'allow', 'testify', 'Douglas', 'ultimately', 'credibility', 'court', 'when', 'take', 'stand', 'event', 'logically', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.As', 'defendants', 'Frank', 'Sutton', 'Sgt', 'Carter', ""TV'sGOMER"", 'PYLE', 'USMC', 'properly', 'repulsive', 'leader', 'debauchers.Robert', 'Blake', 'BARETTA', 'remorseful', 'man', 'branded', 'impotent', 'nutcase', 'defense', 'shrink', 'reacts', 'angrily', 'charge.Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'use', 'shielding', 'Blake', 'Sutton', 'cruel', 'barbs', 'excuse', 'feed', 'inner', 'violent', 'tendencies.Mal', 'Sondock', 'character', 'meat-headed', 'cypher', 'little', 'consequence.The', 'story', 'pure', 'tragedy', 'river', 'girl', 'assaulted', 'then', 'second', 'attack', 'court', 'four', 'soldiers', 'have', 'justice', 'served', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'partial', 'victory', 'maybe', 'soul', 'process', 'simply', 'winners', 'here.Rating', '3', 'stars', '5', 'only', 'calling', 'such', 'exercise', 'several', 'forms', 'inhumanity', 'good', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'somehow']",N/A

Finally, after all these years, I know why.  Well, actually, I know a lot of reasons why, but some of them would constitute spoilers.For one thing, I know I would have been upset that this girl's rape was treated as a very serious matter, and in fact the four soldiers who raped her faced the death penalty.  She was 16; I was 13, and my rapists were charged with statutory rape: that is, the grand jury concluded that I had not fought.  In those days, stat rape was a &#34;boys will be boys&#34; minor offense.  None of them even got jail time, only probation.But this really isn't about me, it's about a young German girl raped by four American soldiers.  (Or maybe three, with one somewhat questionable.)  She was the town's banker's daughter, and had been swimming in a brief 2-piece bathing suit (not really a bikini, as it was described in court) with her boyfriend.  They quarreled, and she swam across the river to where she had left her clothes while he pouted on the other shore.  Unfortunately, as she was changing her clothes, the half-drunk soldiers were spying on her, and came out of the bushes to rape her.The basic facts were there from the start, although of course the soldiers claimed she wanted it.  There was a rule that the death penalty could not be imposed unless she held up throughout the trial, including all cross-examination, and so all the defense attorney even tried to do was to rattle her so badly that she withdrew from the trial.  He had offered to settle the case for sentences at hard labor before the trial began, but the prosecution was not willing to deal.  So nobody believed there was really a question of guilt, except perhaps of the degree of guilt.It's a pretty good movie overall, although the rather insipid theme song is played way too much, including coming from the juke box at the Florida Bar even before the rape took place.  Some of the secondary actors are a bit over-played, but both Kirk Douglas and E.G. Marshall are their professional best, and very believable.",4,Kirk Douglas v. E.G.

The crime is quickly uncovered and the soldiers are put on trial for court martial.Kirk Douglas, playing defense attorney Major Steve Garrett has been commissioned to defend the soldiers.  A crime of this magnitude could warrant the death penalty.  Prosecuting attorney E.G. Marshall, in a familiar role is pushing for exactly that outcome.  Poignantly, Douglas while compelled to defend his clients, feels remorse when confronted by the realization that he will have to humiliate the victim, played by 16 year old and future Mrs. Tony Curtis, Christine Kauffman during cross examination to save their lives.  He begs the girl's father a proud and stubborn man to spare his daughter from this fate but is rebuffed.The film takes us through the unfortunate trial and the lack of compassion for the victim as show by the townsfolk.

681174,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B00005S8KS,Roger J. Buffington,"[5, 5]","This is an excellent film and a story well told.  The time is 1960, the place, West Germany, in a town in which a large US Army contingent is based.  The story deals with a tragic rape of a young German girl by four GIs.Of course, the entire town is howling for the death penalty to be meted out to the four soldiers, three of whom are clearly guilty.  The American command is equally horrified and determines that the crime of the four soldiers is an outrage and will be tried and treated as one, with an open trial in the center of town.  Much of the town attends.The film brilliantly develops the theme of the story--the town is riven by hatreds and divisions of wealth and class.  Its outrage over the crimes of the soldiers becomes overshadowed by the rivalries and resentments involving the young victim's family.  Soon the trial becomes a forum for ridiculing the girl and her family, and ruining what should have been a spotless reputation.Kirk Douglas turns in a fine performance as the defense counsel, who is both sympathetic to the victim, and ruthless in his tactics aimed at sparing his four clients the death penalty.  The courtroom drama here is superb and for once, generally true to life.

Clemett ""Brujarubia""","[10, 10]","Town Without Pity could have been the ultimate exploitation film, if it didn't go beyond the sensationalism of the trailers.  Instead it is an excellent character study of a conflicted military lawyer with an impossible job, a victim whose suffering doesn't stop, and a father whose position is endangered by the prejudices or envy of the townspeople. Their attitudes toward poor Karin are poorly explained; we have only Major Garrett's speculation on why they turn against this innocent girl.  They tell outrageous lies, repeat rumors, and do whatever they can to sully her reputation.  Their motives, however, are less important than how this film indicts a legal system that allows an accused rapist's counsel to blame the victim.Kirk Douglas gives a stellar performance as the officer who does the dirty job he is assigned and later feels a remorse he isn't permitted to show.  Frank Sutton and the other actors playing the defendants paint a picture of pure evil.  The best performances are by Christine Kaufmann as the tragic Karin, Hans Nielsen as Karin's deceived father, and Gerhart Lippert as her justifiably outraged boyfriend.  Tieing it all together is Barbara Rutting as the German journalist who may be the only person to see through what is going on, but who is straitjacketed by the journalistic responsibility to remain neutral, if only in print.It is shocking that this film didn't provoke earlier passage of rape shield laws, and for this reason should be mandatory viewing whenever those laws are threatened.",5,Still Relevant After All These Years,1203465600,"02 20, 2008",2008,1529,"['Town', 'Without', 'Pity', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ultimate', 'exploitation', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'sensationalism', 'trailers', 'Instead', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'conflicted', 'military', 'lawyer', 'impossible', 'job', 'victim', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'stop', 'father', 'position', 'endangered', 'prejudices', 'envy', 'townspeople', 'attitudes', 'poor', 'Karin', 'are', 'poorly', 'explained', 'have', 'only', 'Major', 'Garrett', 'speculation', 'why', 'turn', 'innocent', 'girl', 'tell', 'outrageous', 'lies', 'repeat', 'rumors', 'do', 'can', 'sully', 'reputation', 'motives', 'however', 'are', 'less', 'important', 'how', 'film', 'legal', 'system', 'accused', 'rapist', 'counsel', 'blame', 'victim.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'stellar', 'performance', 'officer', 'who', 'dirty', 'job', 'assigned', 'later', 'feels', 'remorse', ""n't"", 'permitted', 'show', 'Frank', 'Sutton', 'other', 'actors', 'playing', 'defendants', 'paint', 'picture', 'pure', 'evil', 'best', 'performances', 'are', 'Christine', 'Kaufmann', 'tragic', 'Karin', 'Hans', 'Nielsen', 'Karin', 'deceived', 'father', 'Gerhart', 'Lippert', 'justifiably', 'outraged', 'boyfriend', 'Tieing', 'together', 'Barbara', 'Rutting', 'German', 'journalist', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'who', 'straitjacketed', 'journalistic', 'responsibility', 'remain', 'neutral', 'only', 'print.It', 'shocking', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'provoke', 'earlier', 'passage', 'rape', 'shield', 'laws', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'whenever', 'laws', 'are', 'threatened']",N/A

The trailer for TOWN WITHOUT PITY practically screams steamy sleaze. It's today, 1960, and the place is a US Army base in Germany. Four drunk US soldiers, in civilian dress, stumble out of a bar.  The soldiers are either troubled or tough, and include a young Robert Blake, the reliably perverse Richard Jaeckel, and square-jawed Frank Sutton, who's probably best remembered as the oft-angered Sgt. Carter on `Gomer Pyle, USMC.'  Here he's just tough and mean.  Still got the buzz cut going, though. Cut to a loving shot of pretty Christine Kaufmann in bikini.  Think there's a guy in the shot with her.  Cut to a below-the-knee shot of Christine, minus boyfriend, minusing herself of her bikini. Cut to a shot of a j'accusing Kirk Douglas, prowling the courtroom floor, asking a quailing Christine if she enjoys parading her body in front of men! On the basis of what the trailer shows, this one looks like a cross between Perry Mason, The Dirty Dozen, and Peyton Place.TOWN WITHOUT PITY is quite a bit less salacious than the trailer suggests.  Douglas waxes histrionic as the defense attorney with an impossible task - the pitiless town wants the maximum penalty meted out to the accused soldiers, and the only way that can happen is if the young Christine is called to testify.  Douglas, befitting his star status, is a slick lawyer who anticipates cross-examining the young girl with a great deal of dread.  In a bold stroke of typecasting E.G. Marshall plays the prosecuting attorney.  Marshall usually brought a stoic, stolid and understated determination to the characters he played.  That quality serves him well here, and allows him to maintain a rather dull dignity in the face of a legal barracuda like Douglas.One of the better courtroom dramas around, TOWN WITHOUT PITY offers an honest and at times harrowing portrayal of the effects a trial has on the victim of rape. Less compelling is the tabloid newspaper writer, a female muckraker and the movie's overhead narrator.  The movie introduces her, I guess, to give someone for Douglas to grumble at while he investigates the crime.  Her purpose in a movie like this - exploiting a terrible crime for a gossip-hungry public - is underdeveloped.  Perhaps most mystifying is the attitude of German citizens toward a foreign military presence in their midst.  We never learn whether the soldiers are loved, hated, resented, or what have you.  In fact, we never know whether the pity is being withheld from the men or from the girl.  If you like courtroom dramas this one will satisfy, but don't expect much from the rest of the story.",3,Underdeveloped outside the courtroom,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2743,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'trailer', 'love', 'trailers', 'can', 'give', 'different', 'impression', 'movie', 'what', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'filmmaker', 'intended', 'trailer', 'TOWN', 'WITHOUT', 'PITY', 'practically', 'steamy', 'sleaze', 'today', '1960', 'place', 'US', 'Army', 'base', 'Germany', 'Four', 'drunk', 'US', 'soldiers', 'civilian', 'dress', 'stumble', 'bar', 'soldiers', 'are', 'troubled', 'tough', 'include', 'young', 'Robert', 'Blake', 'reliably', 'perverse', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'square-jawed', 'Frank', 'Sutton', 'who', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'oft-angered', 'Sgt', 'Carter', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'USMC', 'Here', 'just', 'tough', 'mean', 'Still', 'got', 'buzz', 'cut', 'going', 'though', 'Cut', 'loving', 'shot', 'pretty', 'Christine', 'Kaufmann', 'bikini', 'Think', 'guy', 'shot', 'Cut', 'below-the-knee', 'shot', 'Christine', 'minus', 'boyfriend', 'minusing', 'herself', 'bikini', 'Cut', 'shot', ""j'accusing"", 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'prowling', 'courtroom', 'floor', 'asking', 'quailing', 'Christine', 'parading', 'body', 'front', 'men', 'basis', 'what', 'trailer', 'one', 'cross', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'Peyton', 'Place.TOWN', 'WITHOUT', 'PITY', 'quite', 'bit', 'less', 'salacious', 'trailer', 'Douglas', 'histrionic', 'defense', 'attorney', 'impossible', 'task', 'pitiless', 'town', 'maximum', 'penalty', 'meted', 'out', 'accused', 'soldiers', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'happen', 'young', 'Christine', 'called', 'testify', 'Douglas', 'befitting', 'star', 'status', 'slick', 'lawyer', 'who', 'cross-examining', 'young', 'girl', 'great', 'deal', 'dread', 'bold', 'stroke', 'typecasting', 'E.G', 'Marshall', 'prosecuting', 'attorney', 'Marshall', 'usually', 'brought', 'stoic', 'stolid', 'understated', 'determination', 'characters', 'played', 'quality', 'well', 'here', 'maintain', 'rather', 'dull', 'dignity', 'face', 'legal', 'barracuda', 'Douglas.One', 'better', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'TOWN', 'WITHOUT', 'PITY', 'honest', 'times', 'harrowing', 'portrayal', 'effects', 'trial', 'victim', 'rape', 'Less', 'compelling', 'tabloid', 'newspaper', 'writer', 'female', 'muckraker', 'movie', 'overhead', 'narrator', 'movie', 'guess', 'give', 'someone', 'Douglas', 'grumble', 'crime', 'purpose', 'movie', 'exploiting', 'terrible', 'crime', 'gossip-hungry', 'public', 'underdeveloped', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'mystifying', 'attitude', 'German', 'citizens', 'foreign', 'military', 'presence', 'midst', 'never', 'learn', 'soldiers', 'are', 'loved', 'hated', 'resented', 'what', 'have', 'fact', 'never', 'know', 'pity', 'being', 'withheld', 'men', 'girl', 'like', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'one', 'will', 'satisfy', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'rest', 'story']",N/A
