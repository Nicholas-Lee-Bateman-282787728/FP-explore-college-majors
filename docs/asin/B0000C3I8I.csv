If you love art and especially if Vermeer is a favorite of yours ( even though none of his work shows up in this movie, or does it at least in idea and memory) you are in for a treat and a keeper of a movie.As beautful as an art book, as thought provoking as the most difficult mystery you have ever tried to unravel, all the characters in this movie are well thought out and wonderfully developed for the time periods they are set in. Time Periods?  Hummmmmm.....  With characters that you will remember days after you have seen the movie, each vignette is art within itself and leaves you  regretting having to go on to the next, yet longing to know what the next plan life has for this aresstingly beautiful painting of the 'Girl in Hyacinth Blue' . Why can't more fabulous movies like this be made.",5,A Brush With Brilliance!!!!!,1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,1019,"['love', 'mysteries', 'movie', 'more', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'love', 'period', 'pieces', 'heart', 'will', 'smile', 'get', 'movie', 'everything', 'else', 'show', 'front', 'fades', 'away', 'love', 'art', 'especially', 'Vermeer', 'favorite', 'yours', 'even', 'none', 'work', 'up', 'movie', 'least', 'idea', 'memory', 'are', 'treat', 'keeper', 'movie.As', 'beautful', 'art', 'book', 'thought', 'provoking', 'most', 'difficult', 'mystery', 'have', 'ever', 'tried', 'unravel', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'time', 'periods', 'are', 'set', 'Time', 'Periods', 'Hummmmmm', '..', 'characters', 'will', 'remember', 'days', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'vignette', 'art', 'regretting', 'having', 'go', 'next', 'yet', 'longing', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'plan', 'life', 'aresstingly', 'beautiful', 'painting', ""'Girl"", 'Hyacinth', 'Blue', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'more', 'fabulous', 'movies', 'be', 'made']",N/A

773421,A3SR7NIG9KBMYE,B0000C3I8I,"G. Gupton ""Author of spiritual growth books.""","[16, 18]","Based on the Bestselling book by Susan Vreeland, this is an excellent portrayal of the historical passing of an unknown and unseen painting by a famous artist. The author brought the painting's path to life by depicting the owners through centuries of time.'Girl in Hyacinth Blue' was a finalist for Book Sense Book of the Year in 1999. It has become part of the curriculum for many schools and universities. I was privledged to meet the author, Susan Vreeland, and saw this film as a private theater viewing during a literary festival in Dahlonega, Georgia. Vreeland's novels have been translated into 25 languages.In Brush with Fate, the woman who lost the bid for the painting when it was up for auction was 'Magdalena', the girl in the painting and daughter of Vermeer, but now grown and poor. She wished to buy it back, but could not afford it. This is evident in the hard version, but Hallmark edited some scripting to allow for time. Also edited were scenes of the illicit affair to make it more for family viewing.The film was shot entirely in the Netherlands. Although Vermeer was an actual painter, he only painted about 40 canvases. Magdalena was not one of the them, but rather a figment of the author's imagination, and depicted extremely well in the film version. It shows the influence of art upon those who appreciate art.Vreeland focuses on bringing art to life through its alleged history. Her inspiration came after viewing artifacts in a museum and wondering how many hands and lives it went through to get to its current place.According to Vreeland, it was actress Glenn Close who suggested the near-sighted Cornelia to be the eccentric woman she portrayed. In the original book, Cornelia was 'Cornelius', but when the movie was made the producer could not find a suitable man to play the part, thus it was changed to be played by Close.I thought this movie was superb. Excellent cast, excellent script. The author was present and got a standing ovation, after which she took questions and answers.Worthy of purchase. I bought the book.Gail Gupton, author The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth",5,"Made From The Book,  'Girl in Hyacinth Blue'",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2140,"['Based', 'Bestselling', 'book', 'Susan', 'Vreeland', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'historical', 'passing', 'unknown', 'unseen', 'painting', 'famous', 'artist', 'author', 'brought', 'painting', 'path', 'life', 'depicting', 'owners', 'centuries', 'time', 'Hyacinth', 'Blue', 'was', 'finalist', 'Book', 'Sense', 'Book', 'Year', '1999', 'become', 'part', 'curriculum', 'many', 'schools', 'universities', 'was', 'privledged', 'meet', 'author', 'Susan', 'Vreeland', 'saw', 'film', 'private', 'theater', 'viewing', 'literary', 'festival', 'Dahlonega', 'Georgia', 'Vreeland', 'novels', 'have', 'been', 'translated', '25', 'languages.In', 'Brush', 'Fate', 'woman', 'who', 'lost', 'bid', 'painting', 'when', 'was', 'up', 'auction', 'was', ""'Magdalena"", 'girl', 'painting', 'daughter', 'Vermeer', 'now', 'grown', 'poor', 'wished', 'buy', 'back', 'could', 'not', 'afford', 'evident', 'hard', 'version', 'Hallmark', 'edited', 'scripting', 'allow', 'time', 'Also', 'edited', 'were', 'scenes', 'illicit', 'affair', 'make', 'more', 'family', 'viewing.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'entirely', 'Netherlands', 'Vermeer', 'was', 'actual', 'painter', 'only', 'painted', '40', 'canvases', 'Magdalena', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'rather', 'figment', 'author', 'imagination', 'depicted', 'extremely', 'well', 'film', 'version', 'influence', 'art', 'who', 'appreciate', 'art.Vreeland', 'focuses', 'bringing', 'art', 'life', 'alleged', 'history', 'inspiration', 'came', 'viewing', 'artifacts', 'museum', 'wondering', 'how', 'many', 'hands', 'went', 'get', 'current', 'place.According', 'Vreeland', 'was', 'actress', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'who', 'suggested', 'near-sighted', 'Cornelia', 'be', 'eccentric', 'woman', 'portrayed', 'original', 'book', 'Cornelia', 'was', ""'Cornelius"", 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'producer', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'suitable', 'man', 'play', 'part', 'thus', 'was', 'changed', 'be', 'played', 'Close.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'superb', 'Excellent', 'cast', 'excellent', 'script', 'author', 'was', 'present', 'got', 'standing', 'ovation', 'took', 'questions', 'answers.Worthy', 'purchase', 'bought', 'book.Gail', 'Gupton', 'author', '31-Day', 'Diet', 'Spiritual', 'Enlightenment', 'Seekers', 'Truth']",N/A
