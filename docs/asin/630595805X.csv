484775,A3CGVO10F7NPMJ,630595805X,A Customer,"[5, 6]","&quot;High Fidelity&quot; is a romantic comedy with the ever famous John Cusack one-of-a-kind touch. John plays a bumbed out high school dropout who tries to find the truth in relationships while managing his own record store. The movie, which features fresh-on-the-scene actor Jack Black (who gives one of the most hilarious supporting roles ever), and the Cosby show's Lisa Bonet also gives small roles to big names like Tim Robbins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and of course John's award-winning older sister Joan Cusack. John Cusack steals the show with his well known anxious and often frantic on-screen persona, and I dont think you know just how much you might relate to some of the scenes and dialogue until you see it. Much like John's 1999 release &quot;Pushing Tin&quot; (also a great movie), the movie features plenty of background side comments and conversation, no matter how small or insignificant, that just make watching the film less like viewing a daytime soap, and more like talking with friends at the local bar. The movie's got some really memorable moments too, like being inside John Cusack's confused head during a confrontation with Tim Robbins, and sweet little Joan Cusack we all thought we knew for years expands her on-screen vocabulary for just a second (also giving a terrific as usual but rather small performance). This movie is just more proof that if you go to see a movie staring John Cusack, it's guaranteed to have a great comediic flow-thru and aim you in the exact direction its meant to. Thumbs up to the cast and a great director...(wonder who that could be?).",5,Another Great John Cusack Movie,983923200,"03 7, 2001",2001,1609,"['quot', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'quot', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ever', 'famous', 'John', 'Cusack', 'one-of-a-kind', 'touch', 'John', 'bumbed', 'out', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'find', 'truth', 'relationships', 'managing', 'own', 'record', 'store', 'movie', 'fresh-on-the-scene', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'roles', 'ever', 'Cosby', 'show', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'also', 'small', 'roles', 'big', 'names', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'course', 'John', 'award-winning', 'older', 'sister', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'John', 'Cusack', 'show', 'well', 'known', 'anxious', 'often', 'frantic', 'on-screen', 'persona', 'dont', 'think', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'relate', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'see', 'Much', 'John', '1999', 'release', 'quot', 'Pushing', 'Tin', 'quot', 'also', 'great', 'movie', 'movie', 'plenty', 'background', 'side', 'comments', 'conversation', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'insignificant', 'just', 'make', 'watching', 'film', 'viewing', 'daytime', 'soap', 'more', 'talking', 'friends', 'local', 'bar', 'movie', 'got', 'really', 'memorable', 'moments', 'too', 'being', 'inside', 'John', 'Cusack', 'confused', 'head', 'confrontation', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'sweet', 'little', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'thought', 'knew', 'years', 'on-screen', 'vocabulary', 'just', 'second', 'also', 'giving', 'terrific', 'usual', 'rather', 'small', 'performance', 'movie', 'just', 'more', 'proof', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'staring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'guaranteed', 'have', 'great', 'comediic', 'flow-thru', 'aim', 'exact', 'direction', 'meant', 'Thumbs', 'cast', 'great', 'director', 'wonder', 'who', 'could', 'be']",High Fidelity VHS
484776,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,630595805X,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[3, 5]","My top 5 lines of High Fidelity:1. Jack Black:  ""There's no way your daughter likes that record...Wait, is she in a coma?""2. Jack Black: ""Let's see-ee-ee-ee""3. Todd Louiso: ""You wanna talk about it...that kinda thing?""4. John Cusack: ""No woman has ever had sex as great as the sex Laura is having with Ian...in my head.""5. John Cusack: ""What does this sentence mean to you: 'I haven't seen Evil Dead 2...Yet'""?High Fidelity is a tour-de-force high level comedy based on Nick Hornby's presumably autobiographical novel.  Most of the film's dialogue and story are taken directly from the novel, with a smooth transplant from London to Chicago.  It centers around Rob's (Cusack's) obsession with his past and present relationships while set in a record store.  Rob, Dick, and Barry make up a great ensemble of alternative music snobs.  The film's women seem to be played with intentional airheadedness, especially Rob's past girlfriends, one a lost soul who looks to anti-depressants for peace of mind.  And I'm sorry Lisa Bonet is not believable as a singer/songwriter.  Anyway it's a unique original film, but I'd like to give Rob some advice: Get over it.Anyway here are my top 5 scenes of High Fidelity:1. The gang attacks Ian (Tim Robbins) with an air-conditioner ""Get him Man!""2. The ending featuring Sonic Death Monkey.3.

The information that the movie is a remake of something British helped me to sort it off. Vaguely boring charm of the USA's former rulers was to be transplanted to the American soil. I had the feeling not dissimilar to the one I have reading GQ's US and British editions consequently. In American issue you read about something almost worldchanging - like NASDAQ crash - while a British magazine regals you with the excessively illustrated story of a pale girl from Manchester who had made it at the national level and now is proclaimed the Miss Fish'n'Chips-2000.The sweet little story of the record store owner and his friends'n'lovers is intended to be cute and John Cussak does his best to keep the film afloat but I could not help wondering - How is it humanly possible to seat for two hours constrained by the cinema's chair feeling just a vague sympathy for the guy and - let's be frank about that - wishing the movie to end faster than your watch tells you it will.I have a suspicion that despite the recent trend to encourage all things warm and human as the antidote for the mindless and hollow mega-budget productions you need a great measure of self-convincing to tell yourselves you've really liked that film.Of course that's only my opinion but I've felt exactly that way.Being British production could've given High Fidelity a bigger credit in viewer's interest - we are used to that provincial eccentricity and the fumblings of these grownup children are usually endearing and funny but as an American production the film looks just mildly irritating.It's a sweet little thing but the films auditorium should ideally consist of the cast &amp; crew's  friends,relatives &amp; neighbors.I just have to repeat that's only my humble opinion and I would not be surprised if there are some viewers that see that movie as something much more inspiring, entertaining and wholesome.",3,Failed to convince myself it's good.,982713600,"02 21, 2001",2001,2081,"['Never', 'fan', 'magablockbusters', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'predisposed', 'like', 'film', 'prepared', 'nearly', '2', 'hours', 'good-natured', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'charming', 'big', 'city', 'misfits.But', 'information', 'movie', 'remake', 'something', 'British', 'helped', 'sort', 'off', 'Vaguely', 'boring', 'charm', 'USA', 'former', 'rulers', 'was', 'be', 'transplanted', 'American', 'soil', 'had', 'feeling', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'one', 'have', 'reading', 'GQ', 'US', 'British', 'editions', 'consequently', 'American', 'issue', 'read', 'something', 'almost', 'worldchanging', 'NASDAQ', 'crash', 'British', 'magazine', 'regals', 'excessively', 'illustrated', 'story', 'pale', 'girl', 'Manchester', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'national', 'level', 'now', 'proclaimed', 'Miss', 'Fish', ""n'Chips-2000.The"", 'sweet', 'little', 'story', 'record', 'store', 'owner', 'friends', ""n'lovers"", 'intended', 'be', 'cute', 'John', 'Cussak', 'best', 'keep', 'film', 'afloat', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'wondering', 'How', 'humanly', 'possible', 'seat', 'two', 'hours', 'constrained', 'cinema', 'chair', 'feeling', 'just', 'vague', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'let', 'be', 'frank', 'wishing', 'movie', 'end', 'faster', 'watch', 'have', 'suspicion', 'recent', 'trend', 'encourage', 'things', 'warm', 'human', 'antidote', 'mindless', 'hollow', 'mega-budget', 'productions', 'need', 'great', 'measure', 'self-convincing', 'tell', 'yourselves', ""'ve"", 'really', 'liked', 'film.Of', 'course', 'only', 'opinion', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'exactly', 'way.Being', 'British', 'production', 'could', ""'ve"", 'given', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'bigger', 'credit', 'viewer', 'interest', 'are', 'used', 'provincial', 'eccentricity', 'fumblings', 'grownup', 'children', 'are', 'usually', 'endearing', 'funny', 'American', 'production', 'film', 'just', 'mildly', 'irritating.It', 'sweet', 'little', 'thing', 'films', 'auditorium', 'should', 'ideally', 'consist', 'cast', 'amp', 'crew', 'friends', 'amp', 'just', 'have', 'repeat', 'only', 'humble', 'opinion', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'are', 'viewers', 'see', 'movie', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'inspiring', 'entertaining', 'wholesome']",High Fidelity VHS

This film is based on the book by Nick Hornby, but adapted for a Chicago setting because Cusack and Co. are from there.  An interesting film of one man's discovery that the reason his other female conquests didn't succeed, was because all he cared about was sex and the fantasy.  He didn't care about the real woman he had in the palm of his hand and the center of his heart.  Interestingly, I'm sure that some people will come away from this film thinking that it ( the film) is shallow when in actuality it's a criticism and wink at it.  I'm sure that popular music lovers will also relate to the film because Cusack's character owns a record shop and relates his existence around top ten lists.  A work of truth, slapstick (at times), and subtle humor.  I recommend it.

484780,AGEIT17HENDIS,630595805X,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Modern age issues can be very trying things, very trying indeed. Oh no, not the questions of war and peace, the degradation of the planet, the struggle against the three great tragedies of life-hungers, death, and sex but, well wait a minute let me back up, because we do want to deal with that last issue in the film under review, High Fidelity, Yes, we want to deal with the very modern issue of, uh, boy and girl relationships, a staple of the Hollywood production line. But in a little different way because instead of the person who is suffering youthful angst and alienation being a young woman that is the usual vehicle for introducing this subject we have a guy, played John Cusack, who is unman-like, if there is such a word, spilling his guts out (sorry) about his lifelong trial and tribulations with, uh, boy-girl relationships. Stuff that most guys keep deep within their psyches but which in the modern confessional age is open for public inspection. The way this introspection is dealt with in the film is by a verbal dairy of sorts with Brother Cusack giving us a blow by blow description of his personal wars going back, going back to middle school for chrissakes. I had better give the skinny of the plotline so you know what I mean.Take one confused record store owner specializing in rarer and hard to get oldies but goodies and one public service lawyer who are having, well, having trouble in their relationship, and are ready to split up and go their separate ways. Reason, public service lawyer reason, one sad sack record store owner is not ""growing."" (By the way for those who are young, who live in mall country, or who satisfy their musical tastes by down-loading their selections on every conceivable electronic gadget a record store is a place where you go in and buy records.  You know, vinyl, 45s, 78s. Still don't get it, then look it up on Wikipedia please.) The film revolves around the hard fact that Brother Cusack has always been, or thinks that he has always been, a loser in the boy-girl love wars and he takes us back through his stormy relationships (to him but to us we have seen and heard that song before) going back to middle school for chrissakes (oops, I already said that). So we are treated to a trip down memory lane (aided by many, many songs from various periods as background-kudos for that) through the litany. Of course when the deal goes down, this is after all a Hollywood boy-girl story, he sees where he could be a little less shallow, a little more open, and so he is redeemed in the end. Gets the girl, again.Well, okay it is not the stuff of great tragedy, modern or ancient, and his character flaws do not doom him to the depths of hell but that main story line is not what makes this one so entertaining. What does is the interplay between Cusack and his employees at the record store, mainly one mad man Jack Black. Now a lot of what Jack Black does is frankly sophomoric and sometimes it seems like he has only one note to play but every time he was on-screen he redeemed this thing. Made me laugh despite myself.  Not bad, huh. Makes you want to go out and buy records (see note above for the clueless on this word).

484781,A15S44J4NHU4LS,630595805X,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[0, 0]","I watched this video last night after hearing a lot of good things about it.  First off, I want to say I really enjoyed the film.It's about a guy named Rob (John Cussack) whose long-time relationship with Laura (Iben Hjejle) has just come to an end.  This causes Rob to reflect on why his past relationships have ended the way they did.  It also makes him realize how much he wants her back in his life.  Most of the story takes place around a record store Rob owns called Championship Vinyl (set in Chicago).  Rob has 2 employees -- Barry and Dick (who in the words of the director ""Make Rob look sane"").  According to Laura, Rob doesn't embrace the changes that are going on in the people around him, and that's when it hits him.  That in order to move on, he has to figure out why he wants her back.I titled this review as ""A movie that exposes the immaturity of men"" not because I think it's a bad thing.  In fact, quite the opposite.  I liked this movie for all its honesty and humor.  There is a scene in the later part of the movie where Rob talks to the camera (a technique employed throughout the film that shares Rob's thoughts with the audience).  In this scene he reflects on his inability to commit to Laura.  ""I've always had a foot out the door.  It made sense not to commit.  Keep my options open.""  He pauses and continues ""That's just suicide.""  Another poignant scene comes close to the ending when Rob asks Laura ""Would you consider marrying me?""  He then talks about how all his infidelity was just chasing after a fantasy.  A fantasy he knows he'll never have, but doesn't necessarily want.Perhaps I've said more than I should about this film for those among the readers that haven't watched this film.  But I believe when you get a chance to watch Rob's epiphany through the course of the film, you will further appreciate what a good film this is.It's one of those art-imitates-life stories.  I was once in a long term relationship, but I feared commitment.  I couldn't rationalize it, yet the fear was there.  And so I watch movie after movie and read book after book searching for a clear articulation of reasoning behind these fears.  This film achieves that purpose for me; as I'm sure it will achieve some purpose for other viewers.A few interesting facts about this film:* based on a British novel by the same title written by Nick Hornby* the screenplay was co-written by Cusack and 2 of his friends a year before they approached Frears for the directing role* the setting in the book was London, whereas the movie takes place in Chicago* the original theme of the book was meant to be about the British way of life (as far as relationship goes), but Cusack and his friends have proved the universality of the underlying themes of love and relationships by writing the screenplay* Jack Black was the only person the Cast considered to play the part of Barry (in the words of the director, ""He's brilliant!"")* the DVD has 9 deleted scenes, 5 short interviews (2 minutes each) with John Cusack, and another 5 with the directorThis DVD is worth owning.",5,A movie that exposes the immaturity of men,1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,3080,"['watched', 'video', 'last', 'night', 'hearing', 'lot', 'good', 'things', 'First', 'want', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film.It', 'guy', 'named', 'Rob', 'John', 'Cussack', 'long-time', 'relationship', 'Laura', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'just', 'come', 'end', 'Rob', 'reflect', 'why', 'past', 'relationships', 'have', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'also', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'back', 'life', 'Most', 'story', 'place', 'record', 'store', 'Rob', 'called', 'Championship', 'Vinyl', 'set', 'Chicago', 'Rob', '2', 'employees', 'Barry', 'Dick', 'who', 'words', 'director', 'Make', 'Rob', 'look', 'sane', 'According', 'Laura', 'Rob', ""n't"", 'embrace', 'changes', 'are', 'going', 'people', 'when', 'order', 'move', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'back.I', 'titled', 'review', 'A', 'movie', 'immaturity', 'men', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'thing', 'fact', 'quite', 'opposite', 'liked', 'movie', 'honesty', 'humor', 'scene', 'later', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'Rob', 'camera', 'technique', 'employed', 'film', 'shares', 'Rob', 'thoughts', 'audience', 'scene', 'inability', 'commit', 'Laura', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'foot', 'door', 'made', 'sense', 'not', 'commit', 'Keep', 'options', 'open', 'just', 'suicide', 'poignant', 'scene', 'close', 'ending', 'when', 'Rob', 'Laura', 'Would', 'consider', 'marrying', 'then', 'how', 'infidelity', 'was', 'just', 'chasing', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want.Perhaps', ""'ve"", 'said', 'more', 'should', 'film', 'readers', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'film', 'believe', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'Rob', 'epiphany', 'course', 'film', 'will', 'further', 'appreciate', 'what', 'good', 'film', 'is.It', 'one', 'art-imitates-life', 'stories', 'was', 'once', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'feared', 'commitment', 'could', ""n't"", 'rationalize', 'yet', 'fear', 'was', 'there', 'so', 'watch', 'movie', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'book', 'searching', 'clear', 'articulation', 'reasoning', 'fears', 'film', 'purpose', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'achieve', 'purpose', 'other', 'viewers.A', 'few', 'interesting', 'facts', 'film', '*', 'based', 'British', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'written', 'Nick', 'Hornby*', 'screenplay', 'was', 'co-written', 'Cusack', '2', 'friends', 'year', 'approached', 'Frears', 'directing', 'setting', 'book', 'was', 'London', 'movie', 'place', 'Chicago*', 'original', 'theme', 'book', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'British', 'way', 'life', 'as', 'far', 'relationship', 'Cusack', 'friends', 'have', 'proved', 'universality', 'underlying', 'themes', 'love', 'relationships', 'writing', 'screenplay*', 'Jack', 'Black', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'Cast', 'considered', 'play', 'part', 'Barry', 'words', 'director', 'brilliant', '*', 'DVD', '9', 'deleted', 'scenes', '5', 'short', 'interviews', '2', 'minutes', 'John', 'Cusack', '5', 'directorThis', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning']",High Fidelity VHS

The script is wittily devised so as to throw in scenes of candid drama and seriousness, intermingled with scenes of ingenious humor. Throughout the history of films, this task of creating a movie with an intelligent, serious plot, as well as terrific comedic prospects has been a tremendous risk. Few films have actually succeeded. High Fidelity has overcome this arduous challenge and succeeded with flying colors thanks to a stylish soundtrack, fresh ideas, sharp dialogue, and marvelous acting.John Cusack is Rob Gordon, the pathetic, yet somehow very cool owner of a record store. His greatest passion is music and he obsessively creates his Top 5 lists for best rock album, best track one song on a record, best songs to play at a funeral, etc. Donning a black leather jacket and sunglasses, Rob is both hip and stylish, as well as down and out and washed up. He has had too many relationships that have ended in misery. As his current girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), dumps him, Rob sets out on a crusade to determine why every relationship he becomes involved in goes bad. We learn a great deal about Rob. We also learn about his two ""friends""(if that is what you choose to call them), Dick and Barry, as well as about his five most memorable break-ups. His life is dismal because of his inability to establish a lasting relationship, but from the viewer's perspective, it is so sad that we have to laugh. We laugh at his attitude towards women, his attitude towards life, his experiences, and all of his idiosyncrasies. On Rob's ""what does it all mean"" journey, he stumbles across some uproarious mishaps, and learns some valuable lessons.The filming of the movie is flawless. The various camera angles, editing, voice-overs, and settings are perfect for the mood and overall presentation. The story by Nick Hornby is unique and sophisticated. The characters are well developed, each with his/her own eccentricities. And the dialogue is superb. Each line that the narrator (Cusack as Rob) utters is crisp and heartfelt. Each line that, Barry (Jack Black of the offbeat, talented and funny rock band Tenacious D), pronounces, on the other hand, is idiotic, snappish, and hysterical.By far, the greatest, most hilarious scene of the movie takes place in Rob's record store after he finds out that his most recent flame, Laura, has been seeing the Zen, yoga, martial arts, spiritual creep who has been living in the apartment above Rob. He earlier describes this man, Ian, by saying ""I didn't like him much then, I @^#$*% hate him now!"" Rob finally comes face to face with the dreaded Ian when Ian attempts to settle things peacefully with him once and for all so that he stops pointlessly chasing after Laura. ""Conflict resolution is my job,"" he says in justifying his visit. When Rob is confronted, he cannot hold back, or at least not mentally. He unleashes an onslaught of brutality on Ian, which cannot and should not be described in words. It must be seen. One of the film's secret weapons is a highly respected actor who has achieved success in Hollywood largely as a serious dramatic actor, playing the role of Ian, who for our purposes will go unnamed.In any case, High Fidelity is filled with such beautifully funny high jinks and sheer brilliance that it is hard not to enjoy it. Look out for breakout performances by Todd Louiso, and most notably, Jack Black.Directed by Stephen Frears, also starring Catherine Zeta Jones, Lili Taylor, Sara Gilbert, and Lisa Bonet, I would highly recommend that just about anyone see High Fidelity for its valuable insights and outstanding sense of humor A+.",5,One Of My Top 5 Best Movies:,1001116800,"09 22, 2001",2001,3717,"['High', 'Fidelity', 'rated', 'R', '1', 'hour', '47', 'minutesHigh', 'Fidelity', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'debating', 'script', 'wittily', 'devised', 'so', 'throw', 'scenes', 'candid', 'drama', 'seriousness', 'intermingled', 'scenes', 'ingenious', 'humor', 'history', 'films', 'task', 'creating', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'serious', 'plot', 'as', 'well', 'terrific', 'comedic', 'prospects', 'been', 'tremendous', 'risk', 'Few', 'films', 'have', 'actually', 'succeeded', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'overcome', 'arduous', 'challenge', 'succeeded', 'flying', 'colors', 'thanks', 'stylish', 'soundtrack', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'marvelous', 'acting.John', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'pathetic', 'yet', 'somehow', 'very', 'cool', 'owner', 'record', 'store', 'greatest', 'passion', 'music', 'obsessively', 'Top', '5', 'lists', 'best', 'rock', 'album', 'best', 'track', 'one', 'song', 'record', 'best', 'songs', 'play', 'funeral', 'etc', 'Donning', 'black', 'leather', 'jacket', 'sunglasses', 'Rob', 'hip', 'stylish', 'as', 'well', 'down', 'washed', 'up', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'relationships', 'have', 'ended', 'misery', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Laura', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'Rob', 'out', 'crusade', 'determine', 'why', 'relationship', 'involved', 'bad', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'Rob', 'also', 'learn', 'two', 'friends', 'what', 'choose', 'call', 'Dick', 'Barry', 'as', 'well', 'five', 'most', 'memorable', 'break-ups', 'life', 'dismal', 'inability', 'establish', 'lasting', 'relationship', 'viewer', 'perspective', 'so', 'sad', 'have', 'laugh', 'laugh', 'attitude', 'towards', 'women', 'attitude', 'towards', 'life', 'experiences', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Rob', 'what', 'mean', 'journey', 'uproarious', 'mishaps', 'valuable', 'lessons.The', 'filming', 'movie', 'flawless', 'various', 'camera', 'angles', 'editing', 'voice-overs', 'settings', 'are', 'perfect', 'mood', 'overall', 'presentation', 'story', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'unique', 'sophisticated', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'his/her', 'own', 'eccentricities', 'dialogue', 'superb', 'line', 'narrator', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'utters', 'crisp', 'heartfelt', 'line', 'Barry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'offbeat', 'talented', 'funny', 'rock', 'band', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'pronounces', 'other', 'hand', 'idiotic', 'snappish', 'hysterical.By', 'far', 'greatest', 'most', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'movie', 'place', 'Rob', 'record', 'store', 'out', 'most', 'recent', 'flame', 'Laura', 'been', 'seeing', 'Zen', 'yoga', 'martial', 'arts', 'spiritual', 'creep', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'apartment', 'Rob', 'earlier', 'man', 'Ian', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'then', '@', '^', '*', '%', 'hate', 'now', 'Rob', 'finally', 'face', 'face', 'dreaded', 'Ian', 'when', 'Ian', 'settle', 'things', 'peacefully', 'once', 'so', 'pointlessly', 'chasing', 'Laura', 'Conflict', 'resolution', 'job', 'justifying', 'visit', 'When', 'Rob', 'confronted', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'least', 'not', 'mentally', 'onslaught', 'brutality', 'Ian', 'can', 'not', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'described', 'words', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'One', 'film', 'secret', 'weapons', 'highly', 'respected', 'actor', 'who', 'achieved', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'largely', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'playing', 'role', 'Ian', 'who', 'purposes', 'will', 'go', 'unnamed.In', 'case', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'filled', 'such', 'beautifully', 'funny', 'high', 'jinks', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'hard', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Look', 'out', 'breakout', 'performances', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'most', 'notably', 'Jack', 'Black.Directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'also', 'starring', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'just', 'anyone', 'see', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'valuable', 'insights', 'outstanding', 'sense', 'humor', 'A+']",High Fidelity VHS

Vegan,"[0, 4]","High Fidelity is a comedy about Rob Gordan (John Cusack), a record store owner/operator who has recently split with his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and now is trying to get it all together. The movie opens with her leaving and Rob giving us his top five list of the most painful breakups. At work, his two ""employees"" Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) share his passion for music and to tell people that what to listen to. The top five motif is present throughout the entire movie, giving it a unique take on life. Rob cheated on Laura, borrowed money from Laura and hasn't given it back to her, and caused Laura to have an abortion. He pretty much feels like a jerk, but it all goes away when he finds out that she is living with Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins), his former neighbor known as ""Ray"".When Rob realizes that he is miserable from thinking about his breakups from past years, he has an epiphany. If he just confronts each one individually, the pain will go away. To just see that they have moved on so he can move on as well, but the anguish over Laura resonates due to the fact that she keeps coming over to get her stuff. Now Rob must figure out if he should just move or try to make amends with Laura and get back together.Cusack is fantastic as the funny, sometimes self loathing music enthusiast. He narrates just about the entire movie and some of the dialogue he gives us is priceless. Black and Louiso seem to be on opposite ends of the rock and roll spectrum but they come together to appreciate the art of making music even with their sometimes totally different styles. Black is very energetic as the self-proclaimed 'know it all' of rock music and Louiso is the calm, quiet rocker. Even Hjejle and Cusack's sister Joan give great performances.

John Cusack is the best he's ever been since his breakout performance in ""Say Anything..."" as Rob Gordon, the depressed, dissatisfied owner of an unfrequented record store in Chicago. The films tone, the same tragicomic, personal, fourth-wall-breaking style perfected in Woody Allen's landmark ""Annie Hall,"" is set beautifully at the very beginning, when Rob, sitting alone, sadly listening to music, says to the audience,""Which came first, the music or the misery? Everyone worries about kids growing up with guns, as if some culture of violence will take them over, but nobody worries about kids listening to literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery, and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?""Wow.After that glance into Rob's soul, he doesn't let up, describing in detail his Top Five Worst Breakups.

The script gives Cusack a lot to work with, and he handles it beautifully, telling the camera everything. He's especially profound when he reveals that his #5 Worst Breakup actually meant nothing too him and was in fact merely a way to bump his current ex-esque-girlfriend out of the top five.

However, this movie won me over in about five minutes' time.I go to Wicker Park several times a month and always stop by to look at the shop which was turned into Championship Vinyl at the cover of Milwaukee and Honore.  It is empty and covered over with boards.  Although the entire neighborhood is thriving economically, for some reason there is nobody who ever rents out this particular shop.  It's a quandary.  Ever worse, there is no placard or memorial alerting visitors that this was the place where the action took place in one of the best films of the last decade.  A pity.I consider High Fidelity a modern masterpiece.  Cusack is great and very believable as Hornby's main character, Rob.  The lesser characters, especially the ""musical moron twins"", are superb as well.  Jack Black is a very special supporting actor and this was the first time that I recall seeing him before.  Tim Robbins, I hate to say it, once again displayed immense talent in the role of Ian who is Cusack's nemesis.  High Fidelity was also my first sighting of the precious Catherine Zeta Jones.The insight that there is something of your first breakup in every ensuing relationship strikes me as being quite true and a point with which most of us can identify.  The pain that Rob feels throughout these (nearly) two hours is palpable, but it is balanced out by tremendous joy and humor.

The first misconception is that this movie is about music. It is not  at all. It is about love and life and how music lover's will equate things  in their lives to records.Cusack's two employees are really the show  stealers. Each has a different taste and their constant bickering really  shines. (&quot;What is this crap?&quot; - &quot;No, leave it, this is the  new Belle and Sebastian.&quot;) They, like Cusack are record junkies and  frequently make lists like top five songs that would be played at your  funeral. In one hilarious scene they are too snobbish to serve a mainstream  customer and boot him out of the store.Tim Robbins gives a wonderful  performance as well as an avant garde new boyfriend of Cusack's ex  lover.All in all, the fact that this movie speaks to such a small  hardcore audience is what will determine weather you like it or not. If you  can understand the refernces to The Velvet Underground and The Beta Band  then you will know exactly where the characters are coming from. Otherwise  you may just find this a typical love story.My sole complaint lies in  the films two hours and ten minute running time. No love comedy should be  that long ever.

484796,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,630595805X,Brett Johnson,"[4, 11]","""High Fidelity"" is a real low point in John Cusack's career.  His character, Rob, is so unappealing and obnoxious that he is practically impossible to have sympathy for.  The number one problem with this film concerns a device which is supposed to be quirky and funny.  Rob absolutely loves making Top 5 lists regarding just about everything.  If this had been used with care a few times throughout the movie then it might have been rather entertaining.  However, it is used over and over and over and over and over again ad nauseum.  Very unoriginal and irritating.The second major problem with this film is connected to the main plot of the movie.  You see, ""High Fidelity"" deals with Rob's past breakups and the current breakup he is going through now.  His current girlfriend Laura is played quite nicely by Iben Hjejle.  She is actually concerned about such things as responsibility and personal growth.  We, the viewer, are supposed to be cheering for Rob to salvage his relationship with Laura before it's too late.  Thing is...Laura is so great and Rob is such a loser that I found it near impossible to want them to stay together.  I kept hoping that Laura would break free and find someone who appreciates her more.What I did enjoy about the movie was some of the supporting roles, Jack Black and Joan Cusack, in particular.  Jack Black plays one of Rob's employees at the record store he owns.  He is given most of the funny lines in the film.  Joan Cusack is her usual wonderful self and remains one of the most underappreciated comic actresses of our time.  A final note on the supporting cast...I have never been one to enjoy a good actor being used for what amounts to nothing more than an extended cameo.  Sara Gilbert is grossly misused in this film and it was actually frustrating to see her occasionally appear briefly in a scene.  If you are able to secure a good actor for your film than you should use them and not have them around simply for window dressing.  Overall, ""High Fidelity"" has an air of apathy and pretentiousness running throughout and it can never fully shake these negative qualities.  I would recommend just about any other John Cusack film over this one for those of you who enjoy his work.",2,TOO PRETENTIOUS AND IRRITATING.,1013040000,"02 7, 2002",2002,2230,"['High', 'Fidelity', 'real', 'low', 'point', 'John', 'Cusack', 'career', 'character', 'Rob', 'so', 'unappealing', 'obnoxious', 'practically', 'impossible', 'have', 'sympathy', 'number', 'one', 'problem', 'film', 'device', 'supposed', 'be', 'quirky', 'funny', 'Rob', 'absolutely', 'making', 'Top', '5', 'lists', 'regarding', 'just', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'care', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'However', 'used', 'over', 'again', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'Very', 'unoriginal', 'irritating.The', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'connected', 'main', 'plot', 'movie', 'see', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'deals', 'Rob', 'past', 'breakups', 'current', 'breakup', 'going', 'now', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Laura', 'played', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'actually', 'concerned', 'such', 'things', 'responsibility', 'personal', 'growth', 'viewer', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'cheering', 'Rob', 'salvage', 'relationship', 'Laura', 'too', 'late', 'Thing', 'Laura', 'so', 'great', 'Rob', 'such', 'loser', 'found', 'impossible', 'want', 'stay', 'together', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Laura', 'would', 'break', 'free', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'more.What', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'particular', 'Jack', 'Black', 'one', 'Rob', 'employees', 'record', 'store', 'given', 'most', 'funny', 'lines', 'film', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'usual', 'wonderful', 'self', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'comic', 'actresses', 'time', 'final', 'note', 'supporting', 'cast', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'enjoy', 'good', 'actor', 'being', 'used', 'what', 'amounts', 'nothing', 'more', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'grossly', 'misused', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'frustrating', 'see', 'occasionally', 'appear', 'briefly', 'scene', 'are', 'able', 'secure', 'good', 'actor', 'film', 'should', 'use', 'not', 'have', 'around', 'simply', 'window', 'dressing', 'Overall', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'air', 'apathy', 'pretentiousness', 'running', 'can', 'never', 'fully', 'shake', 'negative', 'qualities', 'would', 'recommend', 'just', 'other', 'John', 'Cusack', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'enjoy', 'work']",High Fidelity VHS
484797,A1STJE8KFRWK3S,630595805X,Brian Glass,"[4, 4]","The film is honest and hilarious.  I've always enjoyed John Cusack's work all the way back to Better Off Dead and One Crazy Summer.  There is something always charming about him even when he plays a complete jerk as he does here.  I wouldn't say his character, Rob Gordon, is a typical man but he is one type of man.  The director,  Stephen Frears,  shows him warts and all.  Cusack's honest performance keeps Rob from being totally unsympathetic.  His monologues hit the truth so many times I was actually astounded.  Agree or disagree with what he says but you can't deny there is more than a little truth there.  While everyone involved does a great job, this film rides completely on John Cusack's performance.It amazes me how many reviews here talk about how much they identify with this film and I'm no exception.  I've known record store geeks like Jack Black and Todd Louiso's characters.  I've spent nights in bars having the same juvenile conversations on pop culture.  I also like the constant references to the Clash as being one of the all time great bands.The way Rob matures through the film is well handled and realistic.  There is no blatant attempt to manipulate emotions or any sudden, sappy epiphany.  When Rob finally tells his girlfriend he's ready for a real relationship it's a pleasant suprise.

This isn't on the same level as Cusack's &quot;The Grifters&quot; or Frears' &quot;Dangerous Liasions.&quot; Perhaps this would have been more of a personal hit with me if Cusack's character had been obsessed with music itself as a musician than obsessed with it as someone who listens to and sell records (yes, records not CDs). Some of the very best scenes in the movie are in his record store itself with his 2 employees and him. I've known people like this, who are absolutely obsessed about knowing everything that ever played in the music world, and they can be very funny. However, the real thrust of the movie is Cusack's character's failed love life.  Going through his latest breakup, this time with his current live-in girlfriend, he reviews the 5 greatest romantic breakups in his life and revisits those girlfriends.  Seeing how he is and was with these women, I was not surprised that his love life never worked out long range with anyone. I also had mixed reactions to Cusack's contantly breaking into first person narration before the camera, facing us and talking directly to us as the audience.

484799,A2PBV1899CX3TE,630595805X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[5, 5]","John Cusack is handsome, but in a strange way. As a leading man, he remains an Everyman, or even an Underdog. In fact, the perfect role for him would have been Jughead Jones if they ever made a live-action version of Archie. But the next best role for John Cusack would have to be Rob Gordon, record store owner, the role he plays in High Fidelity. It is next to perfect for him.A break up with his girl friend Laura causes him to re-evaluate his whole life, and since he is accustomed to making lists, of his top five favorite records, for instance, he makes a list of his top five break ups, and tries to track them all down and ask them each what went wrong.He is semi-cool, but as he looks down on his customers, record geeks with a vinyl fetish, mostly young men - who spend all their time looking for deleted Smith singles and original, not re-released - underlined - Frank Zappa albums, he admits that, well, he is one of them.Tearing down the fourth wall, he speaks directly to the camera, and lets you in on how men really think about women and life in general. He exposes all of his fears, insecurities, and vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, he is compiling lists of his top five break ups, his top five favorite songs, and his top five dream careers. It sounds like it would be dreary, like being stuck at a non-alcoholic cocktail party with insufferable bores talking endlessly about their stamp collections, but it is great, it is funny, and it is insightful; because I know this guy. I am this guy. I make his lists. I love this movie. High Fidelity is on my list of the top five films of all time.If I was hired to work in his record store part time, I would show up every day, just like Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black).Though based on a book by Englishman Nick Hornby, the story was moved to Chicago, and all the cultural reference points were adjusted accordingly by screen writer D.V. DeVincentis. It is amazing how astute he is. He either venerates or abhors said cultural reference points, with laser-like accuracy.Jack Black is an incredible comedian with precise comedic timing. In High Fidelity he is in top form, playing over the top, admittedly, but as long as the director (Stephen Frears) doesn't exceed the recommended dosage -- and he doesn't -- Black is perfect. Black is the new black. Todd Louiso as the shy Dick also scores highly in the humor department, but his is the understated humor of a Buster Keaton.Iben Hjejle as Laura does a great job. Some other reviewers complained about her fake sounding American accent, but I didn't notice that, even after it was pointed out. I think she did a splendid job. She may be Danish, but she ain't no cheese danish. She was by turns funny, angry, sexy, supportive, despondent -- whatever the scene called for, she delivered.John Cusack really carried the whole movie, but he was ably supported at every turn by the excellent cast. Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, and Sara Gilbert, along with all the rest, really made High Fidelity an excellent example of cinematic art. Jokes, epiphanies, cultural reference points, and astute observations were thrown at Cusack and the ensemble, but they juggled all the flaming chainsaws with aplomb, imperturbable self-possession, and panache. High Fidelity can be watched again and again. Each time you watch you will discover new jokes, new juxtapositions, and new nuances to enjoy. I cannot recommend High Fidelity highly enough. If I could give it up to ten stars, I would give it eleven.---------------Customer: Do you have Soul?Rob: That all depends.==========================THE TOP 5 JOHN CUSACK FILMS BESIDES HIGH FIDELITY1.Being John Malkovich(1999) ....

My feeling is that regardless how ""unlikeable"" or ""likeable"" Mr. Cusack and Mr. Black's characters are, they seem real to me.  I can relate to them as people I know in real life.  It is really important for a contemporary comedy about relationships like this one to have characters people can relate to.  As for the music, the record store characters are your everyday music lovers.  Some they like, some they don't.  And we all know that musical taste is highly subjective and personal.The self-dialoguing in Mr. Cusack's Rob to me is as close to a honest confession of a man's view point as can be.  How Rob sees women and relationships are how many men (regardless of age) see women and relationships.  Men are in general not as self-aware and as emotionally mature as women are (not a put-down here).  This movie gives me an insight into how men's mind at work on a sub-conscious level.This movie deserves a 5 star because of its realness and the great ensemble cast.  A true conversational topic if you ever wanted to talk about relationship and movie in a social situation.  :)",5,Why do I like this movie -- my two cents,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",2002,1219,"['read', 'others', 'reviews', 'great', 'deal', 'amusement', 'When', 'movie', 'can', 'elicit', 'such', 'polarized', 'feedback', 'got', 'something', 'interesting', 'feeling', 'regardless', 'how', 'unlikeable', 'likeable', 'Mr.', 'Cusack', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'characters', 'are', 'seem', 'real', 'can', 'relate', 'people', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'really', 'important', 'contemporary', 'comedy', 'relationships', 'one', 'have', 'characters', 'people', 'can', 'relate', 'music', 'record', 'store', 'characters', 'are', 'everyday', 'music', 'lovers', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'musical', 'taste', 'highly', 'subjective', 'personal.The', 'self-dialoguing', 'Mr.', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'as', 'close', 'honest', 'confession', 'man', 'view', 'point', 'can', 'be', 'How', 'Rob', 'sees', 'women', 'relationships', 'are', 'how', 'many', 'men', 'regardless', 'age', 'see', 'women', 'relationships', 'Men', 'are', 'general', 'not', 'self-aware', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'put-down', 'here', 'movie', 'insight', 'how', 'men', 'mind', 'work', 'sub-conscious', 'level.This', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'realness', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'true', 'conversational', 'topic', 'ever', 'wanted', 'talk', 'relationship', 'movie', 'social', 'situation']",High Fidelity VHS

Then one day, a Blockbuster employee said to me, &quot;If you liked Grosse Pointe Blank, then you'll love this movie!&quot;. That wasn't the first time I heard that remark either. So I rented it, and she was WRONG!! High Fidelity doesn't even come close to how good Grosse Pointe Blank is.John Cusack plays Rob, a late 20's/30 something guy that owns a record store. Rob feels that he's fine where he's at in life. His girlfriend Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, thinks otherwise. Laura leaves Rob for his neighbor, played by Tim Robbins. Rob then goes on one of his &quot;Top 5 list&quot; trips and recalls the worst breakups in his life, and it goes from there.The movie reminds me of a post-John Hughes type of movie. Like a &quot;This is what they would be...&quot; after Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club, etc.. If you grew up with John Hughes movies (even though he's not tied in at all with this movie), then you're probably around my age and can relate with this movie. John Cusack has been in numerious films; such as, Sixteen Candles (a John Hughes film), Say Anything, Con Air, Being John Malkovich and many others. I think he's one of the most under-rated actors in the business today! He delivers another great performance in this movie. I was very disappointed on length of time that Tim Robbins was in the movie. I believe that he was only in 3 scenes! Katherine Zeta Jones and Lisa Bonet (where has she been?) are also in the movie.

484802,A3OUNPPWYVAWIH,630595805X,Chris Maverick,"[0, 1]","Much like Grosse Pointe Blank (a film by the same team as High Fidelity), this film takes advantage of John Cusack's skills.Cusack is the everyman. In the 80s he appeared in a slew of teen love comedy's that a whole generation learned to identify with. In High Fidelity he does it again for Gen-Xers.The movie has a certain poignancy that I think many late-20 to early 30-somethings of today can easily understand. One might almost call it a chick flick for guys. The tone of the movie is prefectly set by a complimentary mix of humor and subject matter. The characterization is strong for the most part, however there are some plot holes and slow points that keep this from being a five star film. Still, the film is too enjoyable to vote it at a 3 or lower.The DVD contains several deleted scenes. Generally this is a mixed blessing. I will watch these scenes and then drop to my knees and praise the editor for doing his job correctly. However in the case of High Fidelity, there were several scenes that I actually wish had remained included. This miht have added some cohesiveness to the plot. Still, as I said above, there were points that the film did move slowly, particularly towards the end. So perhaps, adding more minutes to the film would have been the wrong idea. One might imagine that the movie could have been cut better to include the key points of some of these scenes while still keeping the film at a length where there was no attention drain.All in all, I do recommend this movie. Particularly for anyone who has a love of counterculture or has found themselves feeling as though their life, and especially their love-life, was ever in a point where they felt lost or hopeless and they have enough masochism in their hearts to want to relive that. As horrible as it sounds, i think there is some of that in all of us.",4,John Cusack knows what he is good at.,975628800,"12 1, 2000",2000,1839,"['Much', 'Grosse', 'Pointe', 'Blank', 'film', 'same', 'team', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'film', 'advantage', 'John', 'Cusack', 'skills.Cusack', 'everyman', '80s', 'appeared', 'slew', 'teen', 'love', 'comedy', 'whole', 'generation', 'learned', 'identify', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'again', 'Gen-Xers.The', 'movie', 'certain', 'poignancy', 'think', 'many', 'late-20', 'early', '30-somethings', 'today', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'One', 'might', 'almost', 'call', 'chick', 'flick', 'guys', 'tone', 'movie', 'prefectly', 'set', 'complimentary', 'mix', 'humor', 'subject', 'matter', 'characterization', 'strong', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'slow', 'points', 'keep', 'being', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'Still', 'film', 'too', 'enjoyable', 'vote', '3', 'lower.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Generally', 'mixed', 'blessing', 'will', 'watch', 'scenes', 'then', 'drop', 'knees', 'praise', 'editor', 'doing', 'job', 'correctly', 'However', 'case', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'actually', 'wish', 'had', 'remained', 'included', 'miht', 'have', 'added', 'cohesiveness', 'plot', 'Still', 'said', 'above', 'were', 'points', 'film', 'did', 'move', 'slowly', 'particularly', 'end', 'So', 'perhaps', 'adding', 'more', 'minutes', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wrong', 'idea', 'One', 'might', 'imagine', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'better', 'include', 'key', 'points', 'scenes', 'still', 'keeping', 'film', 'length', 'where', 'was', 'attention', 'drain.All', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Particularly', 'anyone', 'who', 'love', 'counterculture', 'found', 'feeling', 'life', 'especially', 'love-life', 'was', 'ever', 'point', 'where', 'felt', 'lost', 'hopeless', 'have', 'enough', 'masochism', 'hearts', 'want', 'relive', 'As', 'horrible', 'i', 'think']",High Fidelity VHS

484805,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,630595805X,C. Middleton,"[1, 2]","This delightful comedy explores the limited emotional capacity of thirty-something males in their relationships with the opposite sex. Based on the best selling novel of the same name, the text was originally set in London, and per the author, Nick Hornby, the novel's theme was the setting -London. John Cusack and company adapted the novel to a wonderful screenplay set in Chicago. In the film the focus is on relationships, particularly the central character, Rob Gordon, a second hand record store owner, who has an obsession for making lists: top five relationships, top five break-ups, top five careers, top five favourite songs, etc. Rob Gordon is not a very likable fellow: self-absorbed, hypocritical, emotionally challenged though one can relate to his feelings when it comes to grappling with sex and love.John Cusack in the lead carried the film a long with his high energy, great skill and that renowned Cusack charisma. But Jack Black stole the show as the witty and comically sarcastic music-dweb and pop-culture snob. I think we've all met `Rob' at one point or another, where `taste' is accountable. Rob's estranged girlfriend, Laura, played by unknown, Iben Hjejle, really captured the kind of girl that most of us mere males would fall in love with. Her performance was understated, sensitive and believable - she also has a great smile. Tod Louiso as the quiet underachiever, Dick, had the most expressive close-ups, communicating exactly what he was thinking and feeling. In the interview section of the DVD, Cusack comments that Tod was an assassin when it came to close-ups. Dick is another character that most of us have met somewhere along the line - another great performance.One can see that the actors and crew had a great time making this film.

484806,A2VB13MDBBC62M,630595805X,"""cwlova""","[1, 1]","Believe the positive reviews that both critics and consumers are giving this movie. It's easily one of the most honest contemporary films around and it explores issues that real people have.  It's about Rob, a guy who owns a hip LP store in downtown Chicago, and the reasons why he can't maintain a long lasting romantic relationship, and the path he follows to not be a schmuck and win back the woman, Laura (Iben Hjejle) he really does love, who recently dumped him. This path includes recounting why 5 of his ex-girlfriends dumped him. It also includes trying to understand Laura and realizing all the bad things he did to her, like how he slept with someone else and borrowed money from her without paying her back.  Rob is often a shallow person, which is to say that he's like a lot of real-life men and a lot of women, self-absorbed yet essentially a good person. The first time I saw this film, I thought it was a lot of like Rob: good but childish and shallow.  By the third time I saw it, I really liked everything about it, especially the actors and the characters they play.  Firstly, John Cusack, who I'd never seen in anything before, is funny as hell as Rob and gives a likable and natural performance.  Barry and Dick, the guys who work at Rob's record store, are very funny too, always discussing their inconsequential music tastes with utter conviction and importance.  Jack Black as Barry is a gifted comedian and singer, although for some reason, his meanness towards the customers was not initially something I found funny, but eventually it grew on me.  His improvisational song called &quot;the day Laura's daddy died&quot; is my favorite part of Barry's scenes.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is really very stunning in this film.  She plays Charlie, one of the five women who dumped Rob.  Rob's reason for the failure of their relationship is that he could never get comfortable with such a beautiful woman, but then again, what man could?  Michael Douglas.  Charlie's reason for the failure is that Rob wasn't &quot;glamourous enough.&quot;  Charming even in a strange role, Tim Robbins camps it up as the pony-tailed Ian, one of Rob's neighbors who Rob sees as competition for Laura.  And how about Laura.  She is played with the right note of vulnerability and strength by Iben Hjejle.  The chemistry between her and Rob is so convincing that they seemed like they were just about ready to giggle and have fun once the cameras stopped rolling.  Although smart (she's a lawyer and her sensible and intelligent actions in everyday life coincide with how professionally accompolished she is), friendly, and pretty, this is a woman whose true beauty comes from her warm and kind heart, and though it's always clear to the audience, it takes a while for Rob to figure this out.  Without the lead performance of Hjejle, the movie would not have been what it is.  What is it exactly?  A great film that needs to be viewed repeatedly to (a) catch all the inside jokes that were missed and (b) discover the characters' complexities more and more.",5,High Fidelity: Hjejle is the heart of the film,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,3056,"['Believe', 'positive', 'reviews', 'critics', 'consumers', 'are', 'giving', 'movie', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'contemporary', 'films', 'issues', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'Rob', 'guy', 'who', 'hip', 'LP', 'store', 'downtown', 'Chicago', 'reasons', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'long', 'lasting', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'path', 'not', 'be', 'schmuck', 'win', 'back', 'woman', 'Laura', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'really', 'love', 'who', 'recently', 'dumped', 'path', 'recounting', 'why', '5', 'ex-girlfriends', 'dumped', 'also', 'trying', 'understand', 'Laura', 'realizing', 'bad', 'things', 'did', 'her', 'how', 'slept', 'someone', 'else', 'borrowed', 'money', 'paying', 'back', 'Rob', 'often', 'shallow', 'person', 'say', 'lot', 'real-life', 'men', 'lot', 'women', 'self-absorbed', 'yet', 'essentially', 'good', 'person', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'Rob', 'good', 'childish', 'shallow', 'third', 'time', 'saw', 'really', 'liked', 'everything', 'especially', 'actors', 'characters', 'play', 'Firstly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'funny', 'as', 'hell', 'Rob', 'likable', 'natural', 'performance', 'Barry', 'Dick', 'guys', 'who', 'work', 'Rob', 'record', 'store', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'too', 'always', 'discussing', 'inconsequential', 'music', 'tastes', 'utter', 'conviction', 'importance', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Barry', 'gifted', 'comedian', 'singer', 'reason', 'meanness', 'customers', 'was', 'not', 'initially', 'something', 'found', 'funny', 'eventually', 'grew', 'improvisational', 'song', 'called', 'quot', 'day', 'Laura', 'daddy', 'died', 'quot', 'favorite', 'part', 'Barry', 'scenes', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'really', 'very', 'stunning', 'film', 'Charlie', 'one', 'five', 'women', 'who', 'dumped', 'Rob', 'Rob', 'reason', 'failure', 'relationship', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'comfortable', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'man', 'could', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Charlie', 'reason', 'failure', 'Rob', 'was', ""n't"", 'quot', 'glamourous', 'enough.', 'quot', 'Charming', 'even', 'strange', 'role', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'camps', 'up', 'pony-tailed', 'Ian', 'one', 'Rob', 'neighbors', 'who', 'Rob', 'sees', 'competition', 'Laura', 'how', 'about', 'Laura', 'played', 'right', 'note', 'vulnerability', 'strength', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'chemistry', 'Rob', 'so', 'convincing', 'seemed', 'were', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'giggle', 'have', 'fun', 'once', 'cameras', 'stopped', 'rolling', 'smart', 'lawyer', 'sensible', 'intelligent', 'actions', 'everyday', 'life', 'coincide', 'how', 'professionally', 'accompolished', 'friendly', 'pretty', 'woman', 'true', 'beauty', 'warm', 'kind', 'heart', 'always', 'clear', 'audience', 'while', 'Rob', 'figure', 'out', 'lead', 'performance', 'Hjejle', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'What', 'exactly', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'viewed', 'repeatedly', 'catch', 'inside', 'jokes', 'were', 'missed', 'b', 'characters', 'complexities', 'more', 'more']",High Fidelity VHS

Instead, this movie drags you through the Cusack character's romantic life, where he seems to learn nothing, and he doesn't change -- he's the same person at the end that he was at the beginning.The female characters are largely ciphers for Cusack, and one particular female character is forced (by a bolt from the blue by the 4 screenwriters, one of whom is Cusack himself!) into pulling a 180-degree turn. The moment it happened, I felt bad for the character (Laura), and the actress who played her, for being stuck in such a reactive, derivative role.I found myself imagining that Cusack's character had gone insane, and the last 75% of the movie was mere hallucination; that made it more entertaining than the onscreen wish-fulfillment that went on. There are a couple of amusing moments, but the story rings so false, it's amazing to me that it got good reviews. I think they should have ditched the romantic story, period, and stuck with the record store setting, which (along with the musical references) is only window dressing in the current incarnation.Tim Robbins is woefully underused, too -- again, the writers' aversion to challenging the protagonist ensured that Robbins was doomed from the start.The only nice thing about the movie are the shots of Chicago, which look great, even though I found myself laughing at the El train scenes, since they're apparently riding westbound on northbound/southbound trains.

Think about it, it's all dialogue-driven, the main character, well-played by Cusack, does nothing but talk, talk, talk, as he agonizes over every relationship he's ever had, which he can break down and list in order of pain and regret, and it centers around the one person he is convinced he loves.

And that's sad because High Fidelty isn't making any of its subjects look good.I can't imagine what people see in this movie. The lead character is completely unlikeable and his unhappiness is all that he deserves. He spends most of the movie talking into the camera, a passive and highly uninteresting way to tell a story. And the top-five-list gimmick that he uses incessantly gets old long before the director stops using it.This film is so unimaginative, that it puts Cusack wandering pitifully in the rain in three separate scenes. It also has three scenes in which someone gets angry at someone else in a restaurant and walks out on them. How hard is it to come up with new ideas for scenes? High Fidelty runs out of originality about 10 minutes into its too-long two hours.Some people will flip out over Bruce Springsteen's cameo not noticing what a poor actor he is. Others will say that Jack Black is uproarious. I'd say mildly amusing, but so underused that even at his zaniest, he couldn't save this muddle. What a waste of an evening.

484811,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,630595805X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Either the world is getting weirder or I'm finally starting to recede toward normality, as High Fidelity actually plays at a level I can relate to.  Now, there's no shortage of films like this - man enters 30s and has to finally grow up, doesn't have a clue about love or life, and tries to figure everything out and get his girl back in the process.  Surprisingly, most of these films are pretty good.  High Fidelity is excellent.  It has a compelling, human, believable story, lots of comedy (much of it high-brow disguised as common), a great cast, and all kinds of great music that could really be described as a passable soundtrack to life itself.John Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a pretty normal guy who happens to be living in an emotional bubble - and it has just burst.  His girlfriend of the past two years, Laura (Iben Hjejle) has just left him, triggering a sort of early midlife crisis in his life.  Rob doesn't like change.  He runs a record shop with the help of two guys even weirder than he is - Dick (Todd Louiso), a shy, bumbling, Moby-like guy and Barry (Jack Black), who never fails to entertain.  The guys like to expound upon their musical knowledge, usually in the form of top five lists of everything.  Rob has top five lists for everything, including his most traumatic breakups.  He tries to pretend that his recent breakup with Laura isn't top five material, although it obviously is - especially when he learns she seems to have left him for Ian (Tim Robbins), the schmaltzy pseudo-loverboy upstairs.  He simply must know why Laura dumped him, and that sends him down memory lane thinking about all of the other girls that dumped him through the years - going all the way back to junior high.  Seeing some of these women again, including a beautiful yet shallow ex-flame played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, he gets a whole new perspective on life.  Not completely, though, as he's still tearing his heart out over Laura and engaging in some activities that could be construed as harassing in nature.For an ex-couple, he and Laura seem to stay in touch a great deal, as she's always coming over to get more of her stuff, calling him on the phone, etc.  (For his part, Rob also spends an inordinate amount of time out in the pouring rain.)  As time passes, Rob comes to evaluate his real feelings for Laura, even as he hopes to somehow get her back, and comes to know himself a lot better in the process.  He never really figures things out, nor does he truly reinvent himself, but he matures.  He's going to be OK - no matter how things work out with Laura in the end.Basically, this is a romantic comedy for guys.  For once, guys won't have to sleep through a sappy love story their better halves force them to watch; Rob is sort of speaking for guys as a whole here.  There's plenty of dry, witty humor to keep you sustained, much of it supplied by Jack Black, and you might even find yourself wanting to watch the whole film over again.  Plus, it features not one but two Bob Dylan tracks, so you know it must have something going for it.",5,A quality romantic comedy for guys,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,3061,"['world', 'getting', 'weirder', ""'m"", 'finally', 'starting', 'recede', 'normality', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'actually', 'level', 'can', 'relate', 'Now', 'shortage', 'films', 'man', '30s', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'love', 'life', 'tries', 'figure', 'everything', 'out', 'get', 'girl', 'back', 'process', 'Surprisingly', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'excellent', 'compelling', 'human', 'believable', 'story', 'lots', 'comedy', 'much', 'high-brow', 'disguised', 'common', 'great', 'cast', 'kinds', 'great', 'music', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'described', 'passable', 'soundtrack', 'life', 'itself.John', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'pretty', 'normal', 'guy', 'who', 'be', 'living', 'emotional', 'bubble', 'just', 'burst', 'girlfriend', 'past', 'two', 'years', 'Laura', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'just', 'left', 'triggering', 'sort', 'early', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'life', 'Rob', ""n't"", 'like', 'change', 'record', 'shop', 'help', 'two', 'guys', 'even', 'weirder', 'Dick', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'shy', 'bumbling', 'Moby-like', 'guy', 'Barry', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'never', 'entertain', 'guys', 'expound', 'musical', 'knowledge', 'usually', 'form', 'top', 'five', 'lists', 'everything', 'Rob', 'top', 'five', 'lists', 'everything', 'including', 'most', 'traumatic', 'breakups', 'pretend', 'recent', 'breakup', 'Laura', ""n't"", 'top', 'five', 'material', 'obviously', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'left', 'Ian', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'schmaltzy', 'pseudo-loverboy', 'upstairs', 'simply', 'must', 'know', 'why', 'Laura', 'dumped', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'thinking', 'other', 'girls', 'dumped', 'years', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'junior', 'high', 'Seeing', 'women', 'again', 'including', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'shallow', 'ex-flame', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'whole', 'new', 'perspective', 'life', 'Not', 'completely', 'though', 'still', 'tearing', 'heart', 'out', 'Laura', 'engaging', 'activities', 'could', 'be', 'construed', 'harassing', 'ex-couple', 'Laura', 'seem', 'stay', 'touch', 'great', 'deal', 'always', 'coming', 'get', 'more', 'stuff', 'calling', 'phone', 'etc', 'part', 'Rob', 'also', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'pouring', 'rain', 'time', 'passes', 'Rob', 'evaluate', 'real', 'feelings', 'Laura', 'even', 'somehow', 'get', 'back', 'know', 'lot', 'better', 'process', 'never', 'really', 'things', 'out', 'truly', 'reinvent', 'going', 'be', 'OK', 'matter', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'Laura', 'end.Basically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guys', 'once', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'sleep', 'sappy', 'love', 'story', 'better', 'halves', 'force', 'watch', 'Rob', 'sort', 'speaking', 'guys', 'whole', 'here', 'plenty', 'dry', 'witty', 'humor', 'keep', 'sustained', 'much', 'supplied', 'Jack', 'Black', 'might', 'even', 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'again', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'tracks', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'something', 'going']",High Fidelity VHS
484812,A2GYX971VETQBV,630595805X,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[1, 2]","""High Fidelity"" is the only movie, at least that I can think of off the top of my head, that deals with relationships from a purely male perspective.  Most romantic comedies these days are bogged down with feminine insight.  Generally we see a woman who laments the fact that chivalry is dead and we get to see how she finds the right guy (though he may not seem right at first).  But in this film, we get to deal with the male side of relationships up close and personal.  I find many aspects of myself reflected in Cusack's performance.  This is not surprising: John Cusack is quite possibly the perfect ""everyman"" character.  While this film is hilarious, it does not descend into the romantic comedy genre.  It remains a cult-classic that, in my opinion, has much to say about the male psyche (at least as far as relationships are concerned).The dialogue flows nicely and I enjoy Cusack's personal connection with the camera.  The film does lack plot (as one reviewer mentioned), but I don't think that the audience is keenly aware of this fact.  There is far too much interesting character development going on in this film.

484816,A36L1F0YECOAW8,630595805X,David Grant,"[2, 2]","There's a scene in HIGH FIDELITY that's so truthful and so real it's embarrassing to watch. Rob stands in front of Charlie's house in the pouring rain. She has just broken up with him. He screams at the top of his lungs &quot;Charlie, you f****** B****!!! Let's talk about it!!!&quot;. Oh boy. That is sad. You see, Rob Gordon (a thirty-something vinyl record store owner, played with equal parts charm and annoyance by John Cusack) is a failure when it comes to relationships. Every relationship he gets into falls apart. And he is constantly the victim... at least in his own mind. Rob is the type of guy who is never happy with a girl, never really wants them, until he can't have them anymore. When Charlie (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) asks him out and they start a relationship together, Rob's thoughts aren't ever 'man, she's beautiful - I'm such a lucky guy'. His thoughts are 'man, she's beautiful - what the heck is she doing with me?' In it's examination of the thought process of the terminally pessimistic, HIGH FIDELITY is dead-on. I'd encourage any man who has ever felt truly screwed over by a woman to see this movie. You just might learn something. What Rob cannot get through his head is why so many women have dumped him. He has compiled a list of his top five breakups (he makes top 5 lists for EVERYTHING) and decides to see these women again in an attempt to find out why they dumped him - completely oblivious to the fact that sometimes it isn't the guy's fault and sometimes it just happens that way. It's a stream-of-consciousness movie, with Rob often breaking out of character to talk directly to the screen, and we follow him through a current breakup with Laura (played with great sensitivity by newcomer Iben Hjejle) and through his day-today misadventures at his record store. The other examination made in the film is that of obsessive music fans (you know, the ones who endlessly debate and fight over whether or not the real title of the record is &quot;THE Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; or just &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon - believe me, I work in a record store and this type of person really exists). But the object of this obsession doesn't really matter. It could be film, books, comics, television - it's just something these characters use to feel more elite then the casual fan. It's an ego-boost. The clerks at Rob's store are the outspoken, snobbish Barry (played with extreme energy and hilarity by the wonderful Jack Black) and the quietly opinionated Dick (played with shy charm by Todd Louiso) and the scene inside the store are easily the best in the film. One wishes the camera stayed in there more often. This film could have easily been another CLERKS and I for one would have been more then happy. But the film has other plans and other points to make and it handles itself with sincerity, wit, charm, and honesty. It is a great film, punctuated by some great cameos (by the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Tim Robbins, and Harold Ramis) and amazingly assured and utterly truthful writing. Director Stephen Frears handles the films gritty look with ease and Cusack's performance is top-notch. It's a film where you might not know what the record store guys are talking about (but you really wish you did) but everything else - all the painful relationship revelations - ring true.",5,One of the best films of 2000.,982540800,"02 19, 2001",2001,3330,"['scene', 'HIGH', 'FIDELITY', 'so', 'truthful', 'so', 'real', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'Rob', 'front', 'Charlie', 'house', 'pouring', 'rain', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'top', 'lungs', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'f******', 'B****', 'Let', 'talk', 'quot', 'Oh', 'boy', 'sad', 'see', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'thirty-something', 'vinyl', 'record', 'store', 'owner', 'played', 'equal', 'parts', 'charm', 'annoyance', 'John', 'Cusack', 'failure', 'when', 'relationships', 'relationship', 'falls', 'apart', 'constantly', 'victim', 'least', 'own', 'mind', 'Rob', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'happy', 'girl', 'never', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'anymore', 'When', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'out', 'start', 'relationship', 'together', 'Rob', 'thoughts', 'are', ""n't"", 'ever', ""'man"", 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'such', 'lucky', 'guy', 'thoughts', 'are', ""'man"", 'beautiful', 'what', 'heck', 'doing', 'examination', 'thought', 'process', 'terminally', 'pessimistic', 'HIGH', 'FIDELITY', 'dead-on', ""'d"", 'encourage', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'truly', 'screwed', 'over', 'woman', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'might', 'learn', 'something', 'What', 'Rob', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'head', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'have', 'dumped', 'compiled', 'list', 'top', 'five', 'breakups', 'top', '5', 'lists', 'EVERYTHING', 'see', 'women', 'again', 'attempt', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'dumped', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'fact', ""n't"", 'guy', 'fault', 'just', 'way', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'movie', 'Rob', 'often', 'breaking', 'character', 'talk', 'directly', 'screen', 'follow', 'current', 'breakup', 'Laura', 'played', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'newcomer', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'day-today', 'misadventures', 'record', 'store', 'other', 'examination', 'made', 'film', 'obsessive', 'music', 'fans', 'know', 'ones', 'who', 'endlessly', 'debate', 'fight', 'not', 'real', 'title', 'record', 'quot', 'THE', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Moon', 'quot', 'just', 'quot', 'Dark', 'Side', 'Moon', 'believe', 'work', 'record', 'store', 'type', 'person', 'really', 'object', 'obsession', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'could', 'be', 'film', 'books', 'comics', 'television', 'just', 'something', 'characters', 'use', 'feel', 'more', 'elite', 'then', 'casual', 'fan', 'ego-boost', 'clerks', 'Rob', 'store', 'are', 'outspoken', 'snobbish', 'Barry', 'played', 'extreme', 'energy', 'hilarity', 'wonderful', 'Jack', 'Black', 'quietly', 'opinionated', 'Dick', 'played', 'shy', 'charm', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'scene', 'store', 'are', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'One', 'camera', 'stayed', 'there', 'more', 'often', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'CLERKS', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'then', 'happy', 'film', 'other', 'plans', 'other', 'points', 'make', 'sincerity', 'wit', 'charm', 'honesty', 'great', 'film', 'punctuated', 'great', 'cameos', 'likes', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Harold', 'Ramis', 'amazingly', 'assured', 'utterly', 'truthful', 'writing', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'films', 'gritty', 'look', 'ease', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'top-notch', 'film', 'where', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'record', 'store', 'guys', 'are', 'talking', 'really', 'wish', 'did', 'everything', 'else', 'painful', 'relationship', 'revelations', 'ring', 'true']",High Fidelity VHS

However, a friend finally convinced me that all the changes were cosmetic and the story was true to the text, so I finally broke down and got the DVD.I'm glad I did.  The movie adds up to a case of &quot;just because everything is different doesn't mean anything has changed&quot;.  Moving the setting from London to Chicago and Americanizing the concept to a certain extent in fact has not really changed the feel and impact of the story one bit.  What that probably means is the story really is universal in character and the window dressing is irrelevant.The book worked because at a certain level it wasn't a book so much as a long discussion between guys (you and the author) about the vicissitudes of life and dating.  Cusack has brilliantly managed to keep that feel within the movie context.  His frequent one-on-one's with the audience eerily capture the sense that you and he are conversing about things as the film progresses.The other element that Cusack manages well is the women-they are all well chosen to fit well with the descriptions in the book and the interplay of their characters within the movie are enough to provide the historical context of their stories sufficiently to catch their emotional significance without intruding into the ""conversational"" aspect of the movie.Finally, Rob's two record store assistants are perfect-as is the venue of the store itself.

484822,AVCRD98TH48RN,630595805X,D. Knouse,"[5, 6]","One look at the credits for this film and it is obvious that John Cusack really wanted to make this film.  He co-produced, co-wrote the adapted screenplay, and stars in the leading role.  Overall, this film is a great success.  Pick up a solid director in Stephen Frears, who also directed John Cusack in the film noir gem ""The Grifters,"" collect a memorable cast of actors, then load up on the songs for a fantastic soundtrack.  John Cusack is great here.  I've been a fan of his since the days of ""Better Off Dead"" and ""Say Anything"" so I guess my opinion about his underrated talent is biased in the best sense.  The supporting actors are all excellent, with a special mention going to Jack Black of ""Tenacious D"" who steals every scene he is in and invokes heart-felt, belly-bursting laughter at his antics and unique physical humor.  The script is crammed with superb dialogue, John Cusack's character speaking directly into the camera as a confidential insider frequently pointing out his personal ""Top 5"" lists to fine effect.  However, this movie will find fewer and fewer fans the older the viewers are.  For instance, both my parents are Baby Boomers and both thought this film was rubbish, to put it mildly; but everyone from Generation X that I've spoken to thinks this film resonates with heartache, hope, and humor that scoffs in the face of those older folks who said Generation X is comprised only of cynical slackers.  The center of this story is that human nature does not change.  These characters long for deeper understanding and emotional stability.  All that, and the script referrence to the film ""Evil Dead II"" is a welcome, surprising ode to an incredible Cult Horror film.

Ah, the variables of relationships that we men torture ourselves with.Aside from the venerable Cusack the film also features Catherine Zeta Jones as the paridigmatic ""perfect"" girl who is continually just-out-of-reach for we mere mortals.  She sizzles in her role and it's obvious that she relished the chance to play a sort of Supermodel-type girl who is a femme fatale.There is a hilarious scene of Cusack's persona standing in the rain outside her home that perhaps every single heterosexual male will be able to relate to (from one point of his life or other).  A nice touch in the story is how they bring out the fact that old boyfriends are incessantly contacting her to find out why she dumped them.If you're interested in watching a Romantic Comedy that's a bit bleaker than most, this one might be for you.  If you're a male like me who has undergone myriad rejections in his life, this DVD is a MUST see.

Eccentric and clever at times, he's also a bit of a selfish, standoffish prick and that duality, combined with a stern lack of motivation to do something with himself, has long wreaked havoc with his love life. Very funny at moments and stretched thin at others, it's a wordy dissection of Generation X's slow, sad loss of touch with their adolescence and the lies we tell ourselves and our loved ones. Though angled and multi-dimensional, Cusack's character never turns the corner into someone worth rooting for, so his chase after a nearly-lost girlfriend lacks teeth.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Not really a comedy, not really a drama, not really a relationship movie and despite the overflowing soundtrack, not really a music movie either. I have no idea what ""High Fidelity"" counts as, because it's a bit of all of the above. It's pretty entertaining and sometimes quite insightful, certainly very touching and pleasant. No a comedy in the belly-laugh sense, but amusing.Rob (John Cusack) is an ordinary guy who owns a small record store (aside from the usual CDs, he has actual RECORDS), and has just broken up with his beautiful girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle), who is now dating their obnoxious ex-neighbor. He has a long history of getting together with women, only to lose them to other men.But Laura's leaving is a bit of a wakeup call to Rob, especially considering the weirdo she is now dating. So he drifts back into contact with his previous girlfriends (including the one from seventh grade). Laura tells him that they have a nine percent chance of getting back together, and spells out why she got together with her new boyfriend. And in doing so, he learns some new things about life, love, and commitment.If you dislike the above description, then ""High Fidelity"" won't be a good movie for you. It's not a ha-ha-knee-slapping comedy, and it definitely has its share of unhappy moments. But it's very wry, witty, and well-written. (After having read the book, I conclude that it's probably also one of the most faithful adaptations too) And I felt like it gave me a bit of insight into the male brain, although I don't think that Rob is really representative of the male population in general.The scripting is pretty good, although I got a bit tired of Rob addressing the camera. The camerawork is very good, as is the music; all sorts of music are presented throughout the story, ranging from very loud to quiet and somewhat cheesy ballads that are redeemed by the singer.Theoretically, I shouldn't like Rob -- he's somewhat stagnated, quite self-pitying and a bit whiny. But Cusack manages to give his character a certain odd likeability, because I wanted him to live happily ever after (or at least happily for a while). Jack Black is hysterically funny as the abrasively elitist rock snob who jeers a customer out of the store when the guy asks for a sappy record; Todd Louiso (as Dick) is equally good as the sort of nice guy who always talks in a loud whisper. Iben Hjejle wasn't quite as good; she always seemed to be channeling Claire Danes, but not very well. And there are brief appearances by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Bruce Springsteen.""High Fidelity"" has a few flaws, but it's quite an enjoyable movie about maturity and love.

He's asks Cusack if the sort sequence will be chronological.  Nope.  &quot;Not alphabetically?&quot;, as if this is too mundane.  Nope, Cusack is going to arrange them autobiographically, meaning in the order that he acquired them.  There was a time in my life when this this would have been a perfectly normal discussion, and I'm sure the character would have been able to accomplish the feat.  I miss that part of my life.This is a very realistic portrayal of people who live and breathe rock and roll.  While I myself still keep in touch, it's unfortunately at arm's length while more the more pressing responsibilities of life take a higher priority.  While some may think life has passed these characters by, they proudly stay right where they are, as if someone has to hold up the banner.  They are even snobbish about it, and will not sell records to customers they don't consider &quot;worthy&quot;.  I find these admirable qualities.With that as background, the Cusack character now finds that he may have to make that jump to the responsible world or lose yet another girlfriend that has made that jump.  Being of the mentality where all music can be categorized into &quot;Top 5&quot; lists, he chooses five of his past relationships to explore what happened.The fact that he throws a 7th grade, two-week relationship into the mix shows his maturity level outside his record passion may not be that high.  He finds that, in several cases, he didn't realize at the time what a good thing he had, and it's his own fault he lost the girl.  His struggles with this, and what to do with his current situation make this one of the most intelligent movies with a rock and roll setting ever made.I was very satisfied with the ending.  I believe his character will probably never abandon his lifestyle to the degree that I did.  But then he's incredibly lucky to find someone that is willing to accept him for that lifestyle.

His life is populated with strange characters, like the two guys who work in the store (the character played by Jack Black is particularly funny although a bit overdone at times).

484836,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,630595805X,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 7]","High Fidelity is an angst ridden narrative comedy about Rob's (John Cusack) bad luck with women.  His girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has just dumped him.  This sends him into a hurricane of self-doubt and introspection about all the most traumatic breakups in his life complete with flashbacks of each of the top five.  While vainly trying to get Laura back, he contacts all the other breakup perpetrators in an attempt to exorcise the ghosts of relationships past.The film has plenty of funny moments and a high identification factor for single adults suffering through the dating scene.  Director Stephen Frears gives it a Woody Allenesque presentation and does it as well as if had been done by Allen himself.  Though there is not much that is original about the story, it borrows good techniques and ideas from various romantic comedy formats, and melds them together effectively.The biggest problem for me was the main character, Rob.  This was more the way he was written than the way Cusack played him, because I thought the acting was excellent.  Rob was seriously out of touch with his hand in his own demise, which made him seem like a jerk.  His rationalizations for relieving his guilt and sense of failure for past relationships made him a very superficial and hollow character, regardless of the sincerity of his self inflicted torment.  This inability for me to identify with the lead detracted somewhat from a story that was otherwise well done.John Cusack was terrific.  He was fabulous at licking his litany of self-inflicted wounds, and though I didn't fall in love with the character, his portrayal of this anguished lovelorn puppy was first rate.  Iben Hjejle was also very good as Laura, giving her a sort of dignified confusion as she tried to sort things out.This film was good and definitely worth seeing, but it didn't send me over the edge.  As is often true, the hype was overblown.  I rated it a 7/10.

484840,A1RJJ56MBJMX87,630595805X,Gavin Wilson,"[2, 4]","This is a movie about men, their possessions and how they order them. For Rob, it's all about pop music and women. Nothing else, besides the odd film, matters to him. And it's pretty much the same for his two male colleagues at the record shop, who exist at opposite ends of the forcefulness spectrum. They form a self-selected elite who look down on the musical taste of nearly everyone they meet.But actually their hyper-critical views are pretty close to the mark. It's great to hear someone else noticing and lamenting the 1980s decline of Stevie Wonder, for example. One might criticise author Hornby for selecting Rob's dream job as record producer in the punk era (1976-79) when he could have chosen, say, late 1960s Beach Boys / Beatles psychedelia. But you can never find someone with the identical taste as your own. Strangely, the music is not particularly central to this movie, in the sense that it probably generated fewer album sales for featured artists like Marvin Gaye than say 'The Big Chill'.The structure of the movie takes a little getting used to. The first time you see it can be a disappointment -- there's no upbeat climactic ending, unless you count the improbable, rather obviously tacked-on, disco/concert by Sonic Death Metal, or whatever they happened to be called at the time. John Cusack's frequent chats to camera seem altogether natural (except when he's sauntering backwards and forwards on some wooden bridge-cum-platform in downtown Chicago).What I like about this film is that, from a male viewpoint, it rings true so often. Men do behave treacherously, and the behaviour often looks worse at first sight. I like the fact that the actress who played Laura wasn't stunningly attractive. Even Lisa Bonet didn't seem particularly beautiful in the movie. (But yes, that really is Catherine Zeta-Jones discreetly stripping off in a role just before she became famous enough to warrant a major Hollywood film credit.)This is not the perfect movie, but it contains a message about the male psyche that I hadn't extracted from any other movie, and that revelation in itself is sufficiently uplifting to distract from the artificial attempt by the film to uplift via the back-together-again concert/disco scenario.",4,Possessions and obsessions,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,2244,"['movie', 'men', 'possessions', 'how', 'order', 'Rob', 'pop', 'music', 'women', 'Nothing', 'else', 'odd', 'film', 'matters', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'two', 'male', 'colleagues', 'record', 'shop', 'who', 'exist', 'opposite', 'ends', 'forcefulness', 'spectrum', 'form', 'self-selected', 'elite', 'who', 'look', 'down', 'musical', 'taste', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'meet.But', 'actually', 'hyper-critical', 'views', 'are', 'pretty', 'close', 'mark', 'great', 'hear', 'someone', 'else', 'noticing', 'lamenting', '1980s', 'decline', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'example', 'One', 'might', 'criticise', 'author', 'Hornby', 'selecting', 'Rob', 'dream', 'job', 'record', 'producer', 'punk', 'era', '1976-79', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'chosen', 'say', 'late', '1960s', 'Beach', 'Boys', '/', 'Beatles', 'psychedelia', 'can', 'never', 'find', 'someone', 'identical', 'taste', 'own', 'Strangely', 'music', 'not', 'particularly', 'central', 'movie', 'sense', 'probably', 'generated', 'fewer', 'album', 'sales', 'featured', 'artists', 'Marvin', 'Gaye', 'say', ""'The"", 'Big', ""Chill'.The"", 'structure', 'movie', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'disappointment', 'upbeat', 'climactic', 'ending', 'count', 'improbable', 'rather', 'obviously', 'tacked-on', 'disco/concert', 'Sonic', 'Death', 'Metal', 'happened', 'be', 'called', 'time', 'John', 'Cusack', 'frequent', 'chats', 'camera', 'seem', 'altogether', 'natural', 'when', 'sauntering', 'backwards', 'forwards', 'wooden', 'bridge-cum-platform', 'downtown', 'Chicago', '.What', 'like', 'film', 'male', 'viewpoint', 'true', 'so', 'often', 'Men', 'do', 'behave', 'treacherously', 'behaviour', 'often', 'worse', 'first', 'sight', 'fact', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Laura', 'was', ""n't"", 'stunningly', 'attractive', 'Even', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'yes', 'really', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'discreetly', 'stripping', 'off', 'role', 'just', 'became', 'famous', 'enough', 'warrant', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'credit', 'not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'message', 'male', 'psyche', 'had', ""n't"", 'extracted', 'other', 'movie', 'revelation', 'sufficiently', 'uplifting', 'distract', 'artificial', 'attempt', 'film', 'uplift', 'back-together-again', 'concert/disco', 'scenario']",High Fidelity VHS

It's funny, it's thoughtful, and its music to my ears.In a dingy part of Chicago, in a record store called ""Championship Vinyl"", three men are at work. Well, they would be if there was any regular business. There's Dick (Todd Louiso) - a quiet, sensitive, awkward guy. There's Barry (Jack Black) a kooky in-your-face audiophile who dreams of starting a band. Then there's Rob (John Cusack), the owner of the store, the most thoughtful of the bunch. Just as well he's thoughtful, he's got a lot to think about. Just recently, his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) broke up with him. Why does this keep happening, Rob thinks to himself. Determined to find out, he sets out to find the women of his top 5 most painful breakups list. When he finds them, he'll ask them what he's doing wrong. While he does, there's lots of music, snobbery, shoplifting, philosophizing and heartbreak on the way.Though I haven't read the book yet, I thought the characters were very well cast. Director Stephen Frears commented that the scenes in the record store were the easiest to film, and it shows. There's a lot of chemistry in there between level headed Cusack, nervy Lousio and manic Black. The secondary characters seem to love their parts too, and are just as complex and relevant. The locations too, capture the muso vibe really well, I thought.Being a bit of a hardcore music fan, I couldn't help getting excited over little references to bands, either in the dialogue or in the background. ""Look, there's King Crimson's Discipline LP"", ""Hear that, that's a Smog song in the background."", etc. Pretty sad, I know, but finding little things like that was fun for me. Just wish the characters had music taste a little similar to mine.

It was easy for me to identify with the lead character, based on the book, but adapted into modern Chicago urbana, and Cusack was the a-typical confused, self-doubting single 30-something who really never wanted to do anything other than find substance in a loving relationship and well, listen to music or do something he enjoys. His top five lists of break-ups in his life, top five albums for every occasion, day and circumstance, were incredibly witty and humorous, as was the entire film those were centered around.The supporting actors really make the film that much more enjoyable, they are both someone you know, at some point in your life possibly, and the indie record store he owns will remind music lovers of their local swap shop they spent too much time and money in at some point.  Your favorite little dusty, vinyl library with pretentious employees and customers who all generally liked anything but the mainstream top 40 garbage on the radio (sans the ""Green Day"" references).Cusack's character, Rob, isn't perfect, he has made mistakes, been a jerk, and has borrowed money he's never paid back and has jealous fits over men his recent girlfriends leave him for. Tim Robbin's ponytail'd, beeper wearing snob character is a memorable one, as are his ex-girlfriends, best buddies and young skateboard punk kids who hang outside of his store.This is one great low budget film, the kind I love to discover and enjoy, and it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time. Cusack's character I found to be very likeable and relatable, for the first time I saw someone who actually stored old address books and nick-nacks in crumpled boxes and lives in a relatively [bad] apartment just like I do!

484847,A2MMIZ653FBNPT,630595805X,Ian Creamer,"[25, 30]","My top 5 reasons as to why this is a must see film are as follows;1)The story-The character played by John Cusack has reached his late 20's and he's just split up with his girlfriend of the past 2 years.He owns a 2nd hand record store and he's struggling to survive financially.His best frined are 2 fellow music loving eccentrics with whom he has this sort of love hate relationship.He knows he's coming to an age where he should maybe think of settling down and start making concrete plans for a secure future,yet he's been living in some sort of denial.It's the break up of this relationship that makes him suddenly question the way his life has been going.This is portrayed through the various scenes in the film but it's also totally original in the way that Cusack delivers this really funny yet at times pitiful narrative to the camera in a way that puts everything going on around him in a state of freeze-frame.He goes through the pain of trying to sort out his life during the course of the film.2)Comedy-There are some really funny moments in the movie.The main character Cusack himself is a witty and yet comically pitiful figure.Even better are the two sidekicks he works with.They are musical snobs and the scenes in the record store are often hilarious as they deal with the less &quot;musically-educated&quot; customers who come to the store.One middle-aged customer who comes in to buy Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Just Called To Say...&quot; is dealt with in the funniest put-down manner imaginable.The contrast between his two assistants is also a source of amusement.The cameos by Tim Robbins and Bruce Sprinsteen are also hilarious-especially Robbins who is a high-flying,world music loving,martial arts expert who also looks like some sort of new age hippy and worst of all he's living with Laura,Cusack's ex-girlfriend.The scene where he confronts Cusack in the record store is totall original and is also hilarious.3)The Girlfriends-Cusack decides to give you a glimpse of his past life by telling us his worst 5 break ups in his life.Each one is so different and it goes from the time he was in 7th grade right up to current events.He tries to meet up with all these girls again to see if there's a pattern in to where he's going wrong-usually ending up in hilarious and unexpected consequences.4)The Music-Well it's really good.As you'd expect from the owner of a 2nd hand record store it's not your average commercial stuff but a wide range of classics and alt from the 60's through to modern times.At one stage Cusack says &quot;I'm going to now sell 5 copies of The Beta Bands 3 E.P's&quot;.As someone who often frequents record stores myself the scene was just so accurate as the customers hear this wonderful track for the first time and immediately go from just nodding their heads in rhtyhm to the music to enquiring as to who it is?Straight after the movie I dug out my own copy of the c.d. and started to play it again for the first time in years.5)The top 5 lists-this was a particularly strong element in Nick Hornby's book from which the film is based.It's not only the variety of lists from funeral music,to break-up tracks-but it's also the way they are compiled,the useless trivia that precludes certain items,the arguments and dissing of other people's choices.It's the sort of useless arguments that many groups of guys of that age spend hours upon hours discussing.All in all this is a really enjoyable movie.It's funny and it also has a &quot;feel good&quot;

It may well have been my 10th or 11th viewing, but it remains can't miss entertainment.Despite the fact that the Nick Hornby book is transplanted from England to Chicago, darn near everything about this movie works. John Cusack as Rob Gordon is inspired casting and as a special added bonus, we get Jack Black as Barry. Black very nearly steals the movie everytime he is in a scene, but ultimately it is Cusack who delivers a perfect performance as Rob.In fact, you have to wonder, was Cusack actually acting? Rob Gordon is an everyman who to some degree is leading a dream life. He owns a record store and has had more than his fair share of gorgeous girlfriends. But he's also always borderline broke and can't seem to keep his relationships with women together.  His current relationship is on the rocks as his girlfriend has moved out and moved in with another guy (Tim Robbins as a guy all too familiar to many of us; a guy we love to hate).Rob is depressed, but he's also a list maniac, continually coming up with lists that relate to his life, although most of them are based on music from some period in his life. In an effort to figure out why he keeps losing the women in his life, he decides to contact his all-time top five break-ups to learn what keeps leading his relationships with women to an end.There's a lot of talking to the camera here, as Rob keeps us cued in on what's on his mind. This may well be the single best use of this effect I've ever seen in a film.

This movie would have been more aptly titled, ""A Day in the Life of a Loser"".  That's pretty much the only point I got out of it.  The film chronicles a short segment in time of the life of John Cusack's ill-adjusted, stuck in some other era, character.  Jack Black adds nothing to this movie.  If you saw anything remotely funny in the previews, it was misleading.  I do not recall laughing once.  I wasn't emotionally moved in any direction.

It was one of my &quot;all time top five books&quot;.  Those of you who have read it, or have seen this movie, will &quot;get&quot; the joke I just made.John Cusack, in my opinion, is not underrated, by the way--he just chooses to do his own thing. Always.  And in this movie, he comes through, as always.  With his sister, the hysterically funny Joan, backing him up, once again.What we have here is a film that is able to stand on its own without the viewer reading the book first, however. It IS slightly darker in style, I think, but the humor that leavened this tale of a hopelessly lost man groping for some sort of anchor in life through his endless reinvestigation of his past, in women and music, still stands as a classic symbol of the type of male who cannot commit to much, and therefore cannot find much happiness in life.Whenever a woman dumps Rob, he rearranges his vast record collection.  Sometimes it will be alphabetical, sometimes it will be genres of music, and once, astoundingly, he  manages to rearrange his collection autobiographically...eg: what he was listening to at different points in different time periods.  hahaha. This is a typical example from the movie of how absurd this &quot;lost soul&quot; is.John Cusack, standing in the rain, looking like a lost dog... wanting an old lover. John Cusack, directly facing the screen, making remarks to us, the viewers, with more energy and insight than he would seem to be capable of, about how he REALLY feels.  John Cusack...John Cusack carrying this movie with some strong and amusing backing from the other members of the cast. You must LOVE the losers who work in his store.  I insist. They are perfectly portrayed nerds, and yet even they leave him in the dust, ultimately, and find their places in life.As a woman?  I have certainly known guys like &quot;Rob&quot;.  Guys who seem more interested in music, or in loves that eventually dwindle because of no paticular reason.  But as a person, watching this, I certainly held no malice toward Rob.  He hurts only himself as he wends his way through his past and stops short of getting on with growing up.Sort of a funny and sweet feeling to this  movie.  Very little bitterness.  A poignant movie, well directed, well acted.  A loving look ultimately at those guys you gotta love but who can't give you much back except, in Rob's case, a really great tape mix of your affair when it's over.See it for yourself and you will understand the mix of humor and pain that is at the bottom of this gentle obsevation on &quot;guyness&quot;.best,Jean",5,High Five for Cusack,969667200,"09 23, 2000",2000,2640,"['adored', 'book', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'adapted', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'quot', 'time', 'top', 'five', 'books', 'quot', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'will', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'joke', 'just', 'made.John', 'Cusack', 'opinion', 'not', 'underrated', 'way', 'just', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'Always', 'movie', 'through', 'always', 'sister', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Joan', 'backing', 'up', 'once', 'have', 'here', 'film', 'able', 'stand', 'own', 'viewer', 'reading', 'book', 'first', 'however', 'slightly', 'darker', 'style', 'think', 'humor', 'leavened', 'tale', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'man', 'groping', 'sort', 'anchor', 'life', 'endless', 'reinvestigation', 'past', 'women', 'music', 'still', 'classic', 'symbol', 'type', 'male', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'commit', 'much', 'therefore', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'happiness', 'life.Whenever', 'woman', 'Rob', 'vast', 'record', 'collection', 'will', 'be', 'alphabetical', 'will', 'be', 'genres', 'music', 'once', 'astoundingly', 'rearrange', 'collection', 'autobiographically', 'eg', 'what', 'was', 'listening', 'different', 'points', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'hahaha', 'typical', 'example', 'movie', 'how', 'absurd', 'quot', 'lost', 'soul', 'quot', 'is.John', 'Cusack', 'standing', 'rain', 'looking', 'lost', 'dog', 'wanting', 'old', 'lover', 'John', 'Cusack', 'directly', 'facing', 'screen', 'making', 'remarks', 'viewers', 'more', 'energy', 'insight', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'capable', 'how', 'REALLY', 'John', 'Cusack', 'John', 'Cusack', 'carrying', 'movie', 'strong', 'amusing', 'backing', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'must', 'LOVE', 'losers', 'who', 'work', 'store', 'insist', 'are', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'nerds', 'yet', 'even', 'leave', 'dust', 'ultimately', 'find', 'places', 'life.As', 'woman', 'have', 'certainly', 'known', 'guys', 'quot', 'Rob', 'quot', 'Guys', 'who', 'seem', 'more', 'interested', 'music', 'loves', 'eventually', 'paticular', 'reason', 'person', 'watching', 'certainly', 'held', 'malice', 'Rob', 'only', 'way', 'past', 'short', 'getting', 'growing', 'up.Sort', 'funny', 'sweet', 'feeling', 'movie', 'Very', 'little', 'bitterness', 'poignant', 'movie', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'loving', 'look', 'ultimately', 'guys', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'back', 'Rob', 'case', 'really', 'great', 'tape', 'mix', 'affair', 'when', 'over.See', 'will', 'understand', 'mix', 'humor', 'pain', 'bottom', 'gentle', 'obsevation', 'quot', 'guyness', 'quot', '.best', 'Jean']",High Fidelity VHS

484860,AD89XR3O6MKW9,630595805X,john27,"[1, 2]","Being a big fan of the book, I was eagerly awaiting the movie.  I was caressing the DVD cover as I quickly plowed through the book.  In watching the DVD, I was absolutely impressed with how very closely the book related to the movie.  One who read the book can recite the movie lines before they happen.However, as other reviewers have written, there is something missing.  The roles played by Laura and Barry were very well done.  John Cusack makes a very disappointing Rob.  He plays the role well in actuality, but his narrative to the camera is not at all convincing.  Furthermore, we do not get a sense of the evolution of Rob (please read my book review).  When one reads the book, the astute reader can see the point of High Fidelity is to allow Rob to mature, get onto the next phase of life.  This is only inferred in the movie, while it is overstated in the book.  One cannot blame the reason as there is too much information the screenplay writers needed to mirror the book.  The all important part in the book (where Rob meets with Laura's friends...Miranda and David maybe?) was crucial as it revealed that Rob had been successful in turning into a mature adult.  This was only implied in the movie, and its omission did more harm than good.  The whole notion of Rob's relationships being correlated with death was completely abandoned.So four stars for an excellent portrayal of the book (a feat very few movies can do.)  Most fans who love the movie will have read the book only on level 1 (the surface level, strictly about his relationships and pop music.)  Those who read the book on level 2 about his self-evolution will find this missing from the film.  Again, one cannot blame the screenplay writers.  With such limited time allowed for content, as well as the hacking by editors (notice the deleted scenes from the movie also being loyal to the book), one needs to lean one way or the others.  The screenplayers leaned towards level 1 which is fine if that is your motivation.",4,"Loyal to the book on level 1, not level 2",993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,1998,"['Being', 'big', 'fan', 'book', 'was', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'movie', 'was', 'caressing', 'DVD', 'cover', 'quickly', 'plowed', 'book', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', 'absolutely', 'impressed', 'how', 'very', 'closely', 'book', 'related', 'movie', 'One', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'recite', 'movie', 'lines', 'happen.However', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'something', 'missing', 'roles', 'played', 'Laura', 'Barry', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'John', 'Cusack', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Rob', 'role', 'well', 'actuality', 'narrative', 'camera', 'not', 'convincing', 'Furthermore', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'evolution', 'Rob', 'please', 'read', 'book', 'review', 'When', 'one', 'book', 'astute', 'reader', 'can', 'see', 'point', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'allow', 'Rob', 'mature', 'get', 'next', 'phase', 'life', 'only', 'inferred', 'movie', 'overstated', 'book', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'reason', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'needed', 'mirror', 'book', 'important', 'part', 'book', 'where', 'Rob', 'Laura', 'friends', 'Miranda', 'David', 'maybe', 'was', 'crucial', 'revealed', 'Rob', 'had', 'been', 'successful', 'turning', 'mature', 'adult', 'was', 'only', 'implied', 'movie', 'omission', 'did', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'whole', 'notion', 'Rob', 'relationships', 'being', 'correlated', 'death', 'was', 'completely', 'abandoned.So', 'four', 'stars', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'book', 'feat', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'Most', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'only', 'level', '1', 'surface', 'level', 'strictly', 'relationships', 'pop', 'music', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'level', '2', 'self-evolution', 'will', 'find', 'missing', 'film', 'Again', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'screenplay', 'writers', 'such', 'limited', 'time', 'allowed', 'content', 'as', 'well', 'hacking', 'editors', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'also', 'being', 'loyal', 'book', 'one', 'lean', 'one', 'way', 'others', 'screenplayers', 'leaned', 'towards', 'level', '1', 'fine', 'motivation']",High Fidelity VHS

Now the only things in his life are his Used Record Store, and the two people that work with him. This could possibly be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.. The only problem is they show too much about Rob's love life than him working in the store--which the scenes in the store are the funniest parts of the movie.

But WARNING!! This is not a ""stupid humor"" movie (for those of you who think because Jack Black is in it).

The ""non-musical"" are excluded from their club, and they even have issues with each other.Throw a break-up with a long-term girlfriend in the mix and watch as the world begins to crash for Rob (Cusack).

He consults his Five Worst Break-ups and attempts to discover why he has such lousy luck with women.Warning to the sensitive....and I hesitated to rent this because of the R rating for sex and language...you never really know how bad it's going to be.

All three of the guys that work at the record store eat, breathe and sleep music. I am not as obsessed as they are but damn close and I have never seen this mentality on screen. If you love music you will like this film is only for the way it attempts to make all of its viewers music lovers. It puts into action the feelings that revolve around music. It is nice to see that others make lists of everything. Warning: After seeing this film you may stay up half the night listening to records.2. The humor. This is a hilarious movie and its comedy is quite fresh and is a different form of humor that is a pleasant juxtaposition to today&#65533;s gross-out and stupid humor. It is nice to see that there are alternatives. A few scenes really show the film&#65533;s interesting brand of humor such as when John Cusack&#65533;s character Rob imagines beating up his ex&#65533;s new boyfriend Ian and every scene with Jack Black is great. He steals every scene he is in and makes the film worth seeing for repeated viewings. Much of Rob&#65533;s little observances about life are also very amusing but at the same time they sure do say a lot.3. The acting. John Cusack is great as Rob who narrates his life for us on screen. John Cusack portrays Rob so well that we as the audience feel his every pain and victory and can relate it to our own lives. It is a hard role to play due to the fact that that through most of the film he is talking to the camera and does not have the other actors to fall back on. He pulls it off nicely though. Of course Jack Black is great and his character perfectly captures the essence of the collector. When he corrects Dick for accidentally putting a &#65533;the&#65533; at the beginning of an album title he verbalizes the compulsive-obsessive disorder known as &#65533;collecting&#65533;. The guy who play Dick is also great (sorry, not sure of actor&#65533;s name) as is Tim Robbins as Ian.4. The directing. Stephen Frears does an excellent job of putting Nick Hornby&#65533;s book on the screen. He directs in an understated, non-flashy way and that is exactly what the film needed. He does add enough gimmicks to keep the film interesting but for the most part he lets the actors carry the film and in this case that is an excellent move. He obviously trusted his actors and that was a good thing. The credit sequences are among the highlights of his directing and very few films have interesting credit sequences.5. The music.  Everything from The Velvet Underground to Stereolab is used in the film to a high level of success. Each song fits perfectly and provides a strong backbone to the film. It helps to make the viewer understand the musically obsessed frame of mind. Buy the soundtrack too. Some of the most effective song&#65533;s are Stevie Wonder&#65533;s &#65533;I Believe (When I Fall in Love it Will be Forever)&#65533; and The Thirteenth Floor Elevator&#65533;s &#65533;You&#65533;re Gonna Miss Me&#65533;. Also it was nice to see The Beta Band get mentioned in such a flattering way.So, a great film that all should see. I would give it four and a half stars for although it is great I reserve my five stars for true classics. This is close but not perfect. Still go see it.Thanxs...",4,Top Five Things About This Film (Concept Review):,997660800,"08 13, 2001",2001,3414,"['1', 'portrayal', 'musically', 'obsessed', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'revolve', 'music', 'film', 'successfully', 'collector', '65533', 's', 'mentality', 'obsessions', 'three', 'guys', 'work', 'record', 'store', 'eat', 'breathe', 'sleep', 'music', 'am', 'not', 'as', 'obsessed', 'are', 'damn', 'close', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'mentality', 'screen', 'love', 'music', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'viewers', 'music', 'lovers', 'action', 'feelings', 'revolve', 'music', 'nice', 'see', 'others', 'make', 'lists', 'everything', 'Warning', 'seeing', 'film', 'may', 'stay', 'night', 'listening', 'records.2', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'comedy', 'quite', 'fresh', 'different', 'form', 'humor', 'pleasant', 'juxtaposition', 'today', '65533', 's', 'gross-out', 'stupid', 'humor', 'nice', 'see', 'are', 'alternatives', 'few', 'scenes', 'really', 'show', 'film', '65533', 's', 'interesting', 'brand', 'humor', 'such', 'when', 'John', 'Cusack', '65533', 's', 'character', 'Rob', 'imagines', 'beating', 'up', 'ex', '65533', 's', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Ian', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Black', 'great', 'scene', 'film', 'seeing', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Much', 'Rob', '65533', 's', 'little', 'observances', 'life', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'amusing', 'same', 'time', 'sure', 'do', 'say', 'lot.3', 'acting', 'John', 'Cusack', 'great', 'Rob', 'who', 'life', 'screen', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'so', 'well', 'audience', 'feel', 'pain', 'victory', 'can', 'relate', 'own', 'lives', 'hard', 'role', 'play', 'due', 'fact', 'most', 'film', 'talking', 'camera', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'actors', 'fall', 'back', 'off', 'nicely', 'course', 'Jack', 'Black', 'great', 'character', 'perfectly', 'essence', 'collector', 'When', 'Dick', 'accidentally', 'putting', '65533', '65533', 'beginning', 'album', 'title', 'compulsive-obsessive', 'disorder', 'known', '65533', 'collecting', '65533', 'guy', 'who', 'play', 'Dick', 'also', 'great', 'sorry', 'not', 'sure', 'actor', '65533', 'name', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Ian.4', 'directing', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'Nick', 'Hornby', '65533', 'book', 'screen', 'understated', 'non-flashy', 'way', 'exactly', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'add', 'enough', 'gimmicks', 'keep', 'film', 'interesting', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'carry', 'film', 'case', 'excellent', 'move', 'obviously', 'trusted', 'actors', 'was', 'good', 'thing', 'credit', 'sequences', 'are', 'highlights', 'directing', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'interesting', 'credit', 'sequences.5', 'music', 'Everything', 'Velvet', 'Underground', 'Stereolab', 'used', 'film', 'high', 'level', 'success', 'song', 'perfectly', 'strong', 'backbone', 'film', 'make', 'viewer', 'understand', 'musically', 'obsessed', 'frame', 'mind', 'Buy', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'most', 'effective', 'song', '65533', 's', 'are', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', '65533', 's', '65533', 'Believe', 'When', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Will', 'be', 'Forever', '65533', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'Elevator', '65533', 's', '65533', '65533', 're', 'Gon', 'Miss', 'Me', '65533', 'Also', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Beta', 'Band', 'get', 'mentioned', 'such', 'flattering', 'way.So', 'great', 'film', 'should', 'see', 'would', 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'great', 'reserve', 'five', 'stars', 'true', 'classics', 'close', 'not', 'perfect', 'Still', 'go', 'see', 'it.Thanxs']",High Fidelity VHS
484877,A2EF64HUKVH6IU,630595805X,Lee Gaiteri,"[6, 7]","When I saw High Fidelity I expected something of a relationship comedy. The truth was more engaging. High Fidelity is one man's quest to make sense  of why his longest-running, most meaningful relationship has suddenly  broken up. And we learn, as he does, that things aren't always as simple as  they seem, and that he bears some responsibility (though not all--that  would be too simple) for most of his loves lost. His former girlfriends are  a parade of cameos including Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones, and his  history with each is very different. And a lot like real life, there was no  knowing what to expect, whether he would get back together with one  girlfriend or end up with someone new, or just keep going as he was.High  Fidelity is more a clever comedy-drama for dramaphobics than a simple  comedy. Although many scenes are funny and some are side-splitting, the  story runs deeper than that. I've heard complaints about Cusack's  monologues to the camera throughout the film, yet I think they're  indispensible. His monologues are key to the story--because it's all about  his perspective and how it matures--and they add humorous touches that  otherwise couldn't be drawn out without straining the dialogue.What's  great about High Fidelity is that its characters are real people. They  think in real ways, react to things like people we know would react. They  deliver witty lines only if it suits their character, not if the  screenwriter wishes to inject a cheap laugh. The obnoxious characters have  their quiet moments; the beautiful people show ugly rough patches; some  shoplifting nobodies turn out to be talented guys with a future. At every  turn the movie encourages viewers to look beneath the surface of every  character. The entire cast gives a solid, believable performance.The  down side: It's a tad long, and it doesn't really &quot;click&quot; until  the first twenty or thirty minutes are past. At that point it's revealed as  something more involved than a simple comedy, though none the worse for it.  But these are minor flaws and will probably do the film no harm over time.  I believe this movie to be one of the new classics, or at least one of the  films that will inspire the next generation of revolutionary filmmakers to  do something different and truly unique. High Fidelity doesn't try to fit  the mold of a comedy or a drama, but sets its own pace and its own rules.",5,"Surprisingly deep and well-done, not just a comedy.",966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,2423,"['When', 'saw', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'expected', 'something', 'relationship', 'comedy', 'truth', 'was', 'more', 'engaging', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'one', 'man', 'quest', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'longest-running', 'most', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'suddenly', 'broken', 'up', 'learn', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'as', 'simple', 'seem', 'responsibility', 'not', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'simple', 'most', 'loves', 'lost', 'former', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'parade', 'cameos', 'including', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'history', 'very', 'different', 'lot', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'would', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'end', 'up', 'someone', 'new', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'was.High', 'Fidelity', 'more', 'clever', 'comedy-drama', 'dramaphobics', 'simple', 'comedy', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'side-splitting', 'story', 'deeper', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'complaints', 'Cusack', 'monologues', 'camera', 'film', 'yet', 'think', ""'re"", 'indispensible', 'monologues', 'are', 'key', 'story', 'perspective', 'how', 'add', 'humorous', 'touches', 'otherwise', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'drawn', 'out', 'straining', 'dialogue.What', 'great', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'think', 'real', 'ways', 'react', 'things', 'people', 'know', 'would', 'react', 'deliver', 'witty', 'lines', 'only', 'suits', 'character', 'not', 'screenwriter', 'inject', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'obnoxious', 'characters', 'have', 'quiet', 'moments', 'beautiful', 'people', 'show', 'ugly', 'rough', 'patches', 'shoplifting', 'nobodies', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'talented', 'guys', 'future', 'turn', 'movie', 'viewers', 'look', 'surface', 'character', 'entire', 'cast', 'solid', 'believable', 'performance.The', 'down', 'side', 'tad', 'long', ""n't"", 'really', 'quot', 'click', 'quot', 'first', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'are', 'past', 'point', 'revealed', 'something', 'more', 'involved', 'simple', 'comedy', 'none', 'worse', 'are', 'minor', 'flaws', 'will', 'probably', 'do', 'film', 'harm', 'time', 'believe', 'movie', 'be', 'one', 'new', 'classics', 'least', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'inspire', 'next', 'generation', 'revolutionary', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'truly', 'unique', 'High', 'Fidelity', ""n't"", 'try', 'fit', 'mold', 'comedy', 'drama', 'own', 'pace', 'own', 'rules']",High Fidelity VHS

The transfer of any book to the big screen is always a crapshoot, especially when you re-situate the story on a different continent, but Hollywood got it right this time.  The film not only captures both the humor and the pathos of the book, but also it's corp wisdom about growing up.  That may seem sappy and a bit of a cliche but the film avoids both with very satisfying results.

This is more a guy movie, but women will like it too.  John Cusack stars as Rob Gordon.  Cusack also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film.  High Fidelity is based on the book by Nick Hornsby.High Fidelity is full of great characters. The characters are not always likeable, but you recognize them from your own life. Jack Black as Barry almost steals the movie from Cusack.  Barry and Dick are Cusacks' employees/co-workers who help him run his little record store in Chicago.  Lisa Bonet is a groovy, smoky, exotic singer whom John has a crush on.  Iben Hjejle (god, she looks like Rebecca DeMornay) is Rob's punker-turned-lawyer girlfriend. Joan Cusack is his long-suffering friend.  She is long-suffering because John is a neurotic, obsessive, selfish guy who, like the records he sells, keeps spinning around and going nowhere in his life.The movie is so delightful because there are so many possible ways it can go, as well as so many delightful surprises like Bruce Springsteen doing a sincere cameo as a vision in Rob's fat head.  The film is not predictable.  There are many laugh-out-loud moments. The end is very rewarding.  This movie plays like a theatre play, and would make a great one.Some may hate Rob.

Obviously, the soundtrack to go with these record store freaks is hard to top, bringing together a very eclectic mix of talent, ranging from The Beta Band and Marvin Gaye to Bob Dylan and Stevie Wonder.

484883,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,630595805X,Marc Cabir Davis,"[10, 24]","I fail to understand the high praise lavished upon this film. Roger Ebert named it one of the ten best films of the year, which is why I saw it, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The story revolves around John Cusack, a used-record store manager, who has just broken up with his latest girlfriend. Unfortunately for him, the girl he has just broken up with is the only one of his women he has truly been in love with, and this causes him an extra-special discomfort. Thus, he takes us, the viewers, on a grand tour of the women in his life. The scenes shift from past to present effortlessly, and by the end of it we learn that John is a complete loser and a total mongrel. Many, many audiences have found this revelation to be the reason they liked John's character even more, but to me, the movie ended at this point. How, pray tell me, can you respect a man who borrows money from his girlfriend, breaks up with her, and then orders her to have an abortion? What kind of vile audience would accept such an anti-hero?The answer to that, is thousands. While `High Fidelity' is by no means a good film, it plays with audiences who are irretrievably immoral by finally giving them a character just as vapid, self-indulgent and egocentric as themselves. This is not a movie about music - it's a movie about how one should never admit one is wrong, and continue blaming the other person till Kingdom come. With such wonderful lessons at hand, I cannot but help feeling sorry for the professional reviewers who called this film a `masterpiece'.While the film does somewhat redeem itself by making John Cusack `take back' his girlfriend in the end, its also a playground for a more commercially viable ensemble cast, headed by Catherine Zeta Jones and Lisa Bonet as two of John's `conquests'. One wonders how a character as boring and sloppy as he would even manage to find such interesting women. One could say `charm', but John Cusack has none of that. Sadly, though, it's the ensemble cast that manages to string this pathetic movie along. The Director's motive seem to be easily visible. Throw in a lead that audiences can readily relate to, pile in a heap of old rock-and-roll songs, and add on a few lovely women and presto! You have a movie that most people would most probably want to see.Naturally, there are those who found beauty and fun in `High Fidelity'. I did not. It is a base, soulless film masquerading as a `rockumentary'.

484887,A152C8GYY25HAH,630595805X,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","High Fidelity is a smart, infectious and funny movie. It is the best romantic comedy in some time. Touchstone Pictures made a misguided attempt to sell it to the teen market. It is certainly not beyond the understanding of teenagers, but it is a story about adults. It is they who will most appreciate it. Thirtysomethings will find that it strikes a cord in most of them. Every character in it is like someone most of us know. Viewers older than that will find it brings back memories, for, while the characters are very hip and modern on the outside, inside they have the same fears and insecurities people have had for eons.Rob [John Cusack] is in trouble. Laura [Iben Hjejle], his live-in girlfriend, is walking out of his life. He is about to take stock, and we are invited to share his very personal inventory. What, he wants to know, causes him always to be on the losing end of a relationship? And what can he do to fix this? These are very good questions for a man who is thirty-five years old. Rob has a Top Five list for everything in his life, so he makes a list of the five greatest heartbreakers who ever came into his life. We watch as he goes back in time, and shows us these five women. He begins when he was thirteen. That relationship lasted six hours. He shows us the ones from high school and college, then moves on to his young adult period. At the end of this, he decides to revisit these women to find out if what he sees now is what he saw then.Rob runs a retro record shop. He doesn't sell CDs, he sells vinyl. His employees are two of the great movie characters of all time, Dick and Barry [Todd Luiso and Jack Black]. Dick is the shy one. Barry is the loudmouthed, opinionated, never wrong one, the kind of guy we all know and have a love/hate relationship with. The store is full of delightful, eccentric customers. Rob, Dick and Barry know pop music. They love to make Top Five lists of songs that are perfect for every mood and situation. So the title High Fidelity refers both to relationships and to how pop music pervades, underscores and sometimes defines our lives.John Cusack is in top form here. This is the kind of character he plays best. Rob is a guy who is aware of his character defects but is clueless as to how to fix them. We can relate to him because, while we may not admit to it, most of us are also painfully aware of our weak points. Cusack also must talk to the camera a lot. This can be very difficult to do, but he pulls it off with style. Jack Black, a hard working character actor, gives an Oscar worthy performance as Dick. In real life, Black is the lead singer in a band. He is so convincing as Dick that when he finally sings in the movie, it's hard to believe it's really him. Tim Robbins is hilarious as Ian, the pseudo modern guru whom Laura leaves Rob for.High Fidelity doesn't break new ground or teach us important lessons in life. Instead, the story and the characters flow naturally, and the result is one delightful movie.",5,One of my top 10 From 2000,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2991,"['High', 'Fidelity', 'smart', 'infectious', 'funny', 'movie', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'time', 'Touchstone', 'Pictures', 'made', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'sell', 'teen', 'market', 'certainly', 'not', 'understanding', 'teenagers', 'story', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'most', 'appreciate', 'Thirtysomethings', 'will', 'find', 'cord', 'most', 'character', 'someone', 'most', 'know', 'Viewers', 'older', 'will', 'find', 'back', 'memories', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'hip', 'modern', 'outside', 'have', 'same', 'fears', 'insecurities', 'people', 'have', 'had', 'eons.Rob', '[', 'John', 'Cusack', ']', 'trouble', 'Laura', '[', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', ']', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'walking', 'life', 'take', 'stock', 'are', 'invited', 'share', 'very', 'personal', 'inventory', 'What', 'know', 'always', 'be', 'losing', 'end', 'relationship', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'fix', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'questions', 'man', 'who', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'old', 'Rob', 'Top', 'Five', 'list', 'everything', 'life', 'list', 'five', 'greatest', 'heartbreakers', 'who', 'ever', 'came', 'life', 'watch', 'back', 'time', 'five', 'women', 'when', 'was', 'thirteen', 'relationship', 'lasted', 'six', 'hours', 'ones', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'then', 'young', 'adult', 'period', 'end', 'revisit', 'women', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'now', 'what', 'saw', 'then.Rob', 'retro', 'record', 'shop', ""n't"", 'sell', 'CDs', 'vinyl', 'employees', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'movie', 'characters', 'time', 'Dick', 'Barry', '[', 'Todd', 'Luiso', 'Jack', 'Black', ']', 'Dick', 'shy', 'one', 'Barry', 'loudmouthed', 'opinionated', 'never', 'wrong', 'one', 'kind', 'guy', 'know', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'store', 'full', 'delightful', 'eccentric', 'customers', 'Rob', 'Dick', 'Barry', 'know', 'pop', 'music', 'love', 'make', 'Top', 'Five', 'lists', 'songs', 'are', 'perfect', 'mood', 'situation', 'title', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'relationships', 'how', 'pop', 'music', 'pervades', 'underscores', 'sometimes', 'defines', 'lives.John', 'Cusack', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'kind', 'character', 'best', 'Rob', 'guy', 'who', 'aware', 'character', 'defects', 'clueless', 'how', 'fix', 'can', 'relate', 'because', 'may', 'not', 'admit', 'most', 'are', 'also', 'painfully', 'aware', 'weak', 'points', 'Cusack', 'also', 'must', 'talk', 'camera', 'lot', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'do', 'off', 'style', 'Jack', 'Black', 'hard', 'working', 'character', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Dick', 'real', 'life', 'Black', 'lead', 'singer', 'band', 'so', 'convincing', 'Dick', 'when', 'finally', 'movie', 'hard', 'believe', 'really', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'hilarious', 'Ian', 'pseudo', 'modern', 'guru', 'whom', 'Laura', 'Rob', 'for.High', 'Fidelity', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'teach', 'important', 'lessons', 'life', 'Instead', 'story', 'characters', 'flow', 'naturally', 'result', 'one', 'delightful', 'movie']",High Fidelity VHS

Hind ""daria_m""","[4, 5]","""High Fidelity"" is an unusual movie that maps out Rob Gordon's struggle to deal with his current break-up and his history of bad relationships.  With a record store serving as the backdrop, Rob (played with cool conviction by John Cusack) gets to the root of his problem by exploring his past and stating his case through dialogues with the camera.This film is not everyone's cup of tea, mainly because it is more character-driven and not heavy with action.  If you don't find humor and meaning in Rob's dialogues, the movie may drag for you.  This was not the case for me.  I felt that much like Kevin Smith's ""Clerks,"" the speeches (which I found clever) were coupled nicely with a mix of both humorous and touching moments.  Why, the knee-slapping stylings of Jack Black alone help the movie avoid becoming too cerebral.  Viewers have to accept the character of Rob Gordon for what he is: complex and confused.  Things are not going to be easy for him because he is not the subject of a Hollywood fairy tale.  His tale is more lifelike, more internal, and less perfect.If you enjoy more independent, lower budget movies, then check out ""High Fidelity.""

484897,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,630595805X,Michael Bulger,"[2, 4]","&quot;High Fidelity&quot; is the Americanized movie version of British writer Nick Hornby's novel of the same name; if you want a capsule summary of the premise and the plot, Amazon.com provides one in the space above these reviews.  The transfer from one side of the Atlantic to the middle of North America (Chicago, to be exact) may or may not be an issue with you (chances are, if you're British, you won't like the change), but the translation from book to movie does serve to mute some of the distinctive voice of the work.  Thus, although every attempt is made at a faithful reproduction, right down to the main character (Cusack) addressing the audience directly several times like a conventional narrator, some of the immediacy and relevance of, for example, the compulsive composition of top-5 lists for every subject, is partially lost.It is not completely lost, however, and in any case a movie and a book are always entirely different things.  Approached on its own terms, this is not what one might call great filmmaking, but in its own understated way this is one of the more enjoyable films of the past year, at least for me.  The characters are deftly drawn, and notably for a modern work, they change as the story progresses in ways with which a viewer may empathize readily--although, at the same time, I can sympathize with the movie critic who noted that certain of the supporting characters, especially the two record store employees, seem to be auditioning for roles in the TV sitcom version...Regardless, and despite the numerous cameo appearances (Lili Taylor, Tim Robbins, Bruce Springsteen, Catherine Zeta-Jones) which are more distraction than attraction, I enjoyed this film because it was about humans (not, as most Hollywood fare seems to be, about super-humans) and their imperfections.

484898,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,630595805X,Michael Crane,"[1, 2]","""High Fidelity"" still remains as one of my favorite comedies.  Although I do have a lot of them, this is one I can watch over and over again without it getting boring or old.  I am currently reading the book now, which I found that the movie follows it pretty closely at times.  (Except for the location.  In the book, it took place in London.)  This film is about relationships, and yes, music.Rob Gordon is going through a pretty rough break-up, and he has no idea how to deal with it.  He tries to play it cool and like it's really nothing, but it doesn't work.  He talks to the camera, very much like Wayne in ""Wayne's World,"" and reveals all of his worst break-ups and other information.  He also owns a record store and has the ""musical moron twins"" work for him.  They don't make the break-up process any easier.  Oh yeah, he constantly makes Top 5 Lists of almost anything that comes to mind.Then one day, Rob gets a fantastic idea.  Why not call all of those top 5 women who broke up with him and see what happened?  To his surprise, he finds out that some of the break-ups had nothing to do with him, or that he is no longer interested in them.  He feels better, and they feel better.  (Well, actually it's him who feels better the most, but who's counting?)  All of this is a setup for one hillarious comedy about life, relationships, and yes, music.The acting is great in the movie, and is what makes it work really well.  John Cusack is outstanding in the role as Rob Gordon.  Jack Black is hillarious and outrageous as the cold and sarcastic Barry, who doesn't make Gordon's life any easier (one of Jack Black's best roles and performances).  Other players include Lisa Bonet, Joelle Carter, Joan Cusack, Todd Louiso, Lili Taylor, and many MANY more.  They all do their parts justice.The DVD is pretty neat as well.  Not the best, but not the worst as well.  There's a fine amount of extras, including conversations with writer/producer John Cusack and Director Stephen Frears, deleted scenes, and the theatrical trailer.  The movie is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital and Widescreen Aspect Ratio 1.85:1 (which is enhanced for 16x9 TVs).  If you have read the book and are a little bummed out that a lot of the funny stuff didn't make the movie, then try the deleted scenes.  Chances are they are there.  I really think most of them should've been left in.  (Especially the part where Rob goes to buy a record collection from a vengeful wife who wants to sell them to him for a very VERY cheap price.)""High Fidelity"" is a hillarious ride into the mind of a guy.  It's a great film filled with humor and brutal honesty.  From what I have read of the book so far, the film does a good job of staying true to it, with a few subtle differences.  If you're looking for a great comedy that's smart and funny, this is the one for you.",5,"""What came first?

484902,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,630595805X,"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[2, 3]","Being a little older than the characters in HIGH FIDELITY, I wasn't sure at first if I could relate to the immature angst suffered by vintage record store owner Rob (played by John Cusack) as the result of a series of failed relationships. But then I realized that I had been there, done that and bought the same t-shirt and that Rob was me (Everyman?) when I was his age before I realized that failed relationships did not mean the end of the world. So I was able to settle in and enjoy looking at myself from a period of maybe 20 years ago when I was obsessing over why girlfriends left and wondering, like Rob, if it was my fault. Of course, now I know that it was just as likely their fault as mine or both of our faults. It was a little difficult at first to overcome the idea of Rob worrying over rejection when he was obviously scoring with very attractive women. I mean, why would a guy who attracts girls like flies to honey worry about losing one girl? Although a bit of an under achiever, Rob is charming and handsome and has something on the ball. But when you are 30 you don't realize that if a relationship doesn't work out it doesn't necessarily say anything about you. And that is why this movie is so powerful: it speaks for all generations because we have all been there. HIGH FIDELITY might be categorized ultimately as a chick flick but I think it is also a thinking man's film. The script (co-written by John Cusack) is intelligent without being intellectual and is essentially about how Rob deals with rejection and grows up. Iben Hjejle is fresh and stunning as Laura, Rob's main love. Catherine Zeta-Jones makes an appearance as another girlfriend. Stephen Frears directs. Apparently the script was based on a cult novel of the same title by Nick Hornby which might be worth checking out.

Well, this movie helped me make sense of my problems with the first person, interruptive narrative. From the first scene, Cusack is talking right to the camera, without even building a rapport with the viewer. There's no premise or context for his conversation. It's rather startling, in fact.There are a few bright spots in the movie, mostly humourous results of Rob meeting his ex-girlfriends and learning how different his relationships could have been, and how his lot is actually a little better than he realizes.The scene where he busts some shoplifters is a crackup.The dating aspect of the movie is kind of cute, but doesn't go off well because it's told from a male perspective. Men aren't interested in this kind of movie, so who is it that Cusack is talking to?The movie's cast features many stars. Lisa Bonet came out of hiding to make it onto the screen, and Catherine Zeta-Jones has a small part. Even Bruce Springsteen has an extended cameo. But Cusack's marginal acting and whitebread narrative just sinks it. ""High Fidelity"" has no meaning and no message, and isn't entertaining.The movie was well produced; the photography was well done, though the conversation scenes are marred with terrible, spastic editing that makes modern movies miserable.

Some poeple, i like not to include myself, have a difficult job realising that film is a different medium to book, and therefore things will be changed or added or taken away from a book in order to make it a good film. Stephen King couldn't understand that when Stanley Kubrick made The Shining, and i know people who thought Brando's performance in the Godfather went against everything in the book. But that's films! Leave your preconceptions behind, and start with a blank canvas. If you start comaprisons, you might as well not watch High Fidelity because you won't like it.Luckily, i was at no risk of having preconceptions, and i feel i am a lucky man for it. High Fidelity is an eccentric, funny and poignant look at relationship breakdown and self reflection... and of course, pop music. John Cusack has effortlesly transported the action from London to Chicago and has stamped his own mark on the story. A soundtrack and cast to die for, and blessed with a wit and wisdom that is pure Nick Hornby, delivered with a perfect mix, of vulnerability, charm and paranoia by the irrepressible John Cusack.Having broken up with my girlfriend, and having a strong interest in music, i found this film relevant and painfully accurate, but also tremendously funny and enjoyable. Jack Black does his best to steal the show, but i think the film belongs to Cusack as jilted Rob Gordon. This guy has done some unkind things in his time, is hugely anally retentive, paranoid, depressed and constantly self analysing, yet Cusack's likeability in the role means we're always on his side against his new love rival, the slimy Ian (Tim Robbins).If you like music, like comedy and like romance, this is for you.

He teams up with director Stephen Frears (Grosse Pointe Blank) again for High Fidelity and the results are nothing short of entertaining.This adaptation of Brit Nick Hornby's novel sees the world through top five and top ten lists.  Cusack's character, Rob Gordon, is a man in progress, in fact a man in need of very much progress.  He owns a record store, works with two other man-boy vinyl purists (well-played by Jack Black and Todd Louiso), and refuses to be committed to any one relationship or any pursuit in life.  Cusack's latest love interest Laura, played by Iben Hjejle, is left wanting.  The acting is left wanting and the chemistry is left wanting.  The electricity is never very apparent between Cusack and Hjejle like that with Cusack and Minnie Driver in Grosse Pointe Blank.  But it's a minor flaw really.There are many funny moments here.  There are many hip moments here.  One of the hippest being Bruce Springsteen's cameo appearance dispensing sage observations while playing an incredible blues riff.  As Cusack goes hunting for someone to anchor his wandering soul, things almost rap up in the end in too neat of a package.  But the minor detractions really aren't enough to keep you away, especially with music as the common thread.  Needless to say we get to hear much good music as Cusack muses to the camera.This movie may not be Cusack's best, but it's right up there.

Black utterly steals the show, which is saying a lot, as Cusack himself completely nails the lead character, in whom all males of a certain generation will intantly, and horrifyingly recognise themselves.High Fidelity almost loses impetus in the middle, but pulls itself around with a storming finale in which, appropriately enough, Jack Black features, in a scene stealing act.The fact that Cusack et all were able to craft such a winning film out of such an irritating book earns this effort the big rack of five in my book.",5,Jack be nimble...,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1249,"['intensely', 'disliked', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'book', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'fact', 'dislike', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'Hornsby', 'contemporary', 'British', 'literature', 'so', 'only', 'ever', 'came', 'see', 'courtesy', 'losing', 'game', 'Scissor-Paper-Stone', 'video', 'store', 'one', 'game', ""'m"", 'glad', 'lost.This', 'terrific', 'intelligent', 'comedy', 'set', 'fire', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'cast', 'especially', 'comedy', 'double', 'act', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'John', 'Cusack', 'geeky', 'sidekicks', 'record', 'store.Black', 'particular', 'should', 'take', 'credit', 'converting', 'half-chance', 'record-store', 'geek', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'accutely', 'observed', 'perfectly', 'executed', 'comedy', 'supporting', 'roles', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'Black', 'utterly', 'steals', 'show', 'saying', 'lot', 'Cusack', 'completely', 'lead', 'character', 'whom', 'males', 'certain', 'generation', 'will', 'intantly', 'horrifyingly', 'recognise', 'themselves.High', 'Fidelity', 'almost', 'impetus', 'middle', 'around', 'storming', 'finale', 'appropriately', 'enough', 'Jack', 'Black', 'features', 'scene', 'stealing', 'act.The', 'fact', 'Cusack', 'et', 'were', 'able', 'craft', 'winning', 'film', 'such', 'irritating', 'book', 'effort', 'big', 'rack', 'five', 'book']",High Fidelity VHS

All meld together to make a challenging viewing experience which could be repeated  painlessly and necessarily, if we geeks are to catch every reference.  Can  it please the mainstream?  The love interest is fairly universal, and the  supporting cast uses plenty of postmodern slapstick to keep others  interested.  For what it's worth, the record store scenes are dead-on,  playing stereotypes harmlessly and often hilariously.  Tim Robbins gets the  standout scene (alternate responses in the store), although the script  writes in a chance for each character to unwind, usually quite  comically.This will easily gain lasting cult status, however, little or  nothing explodes, thus limiting its popular appeal.  That and a few nits  keep it from being a real classic.  Things move a little too fast later on;  when things start to look bright, one can only gaze in obsequious  disbelief.  The top five lists get a little tedious, and real-life geeks  will inevitably wonder why their lives aren't so action-packed.  In that  case, it's an inspiring kick in the [tattered, dirty corduroy] pants.  The  film ends somewhat abruptly, with much unresolved, vaguely happy and  therefore unrealistic.

The lessons he learns along the way in regards to the current and all past relationships are universal ones. The movie gives you the option to think deeply about certain life issues or block them out and laugh at the intelligent and witty dialogue. I happen to enjoy both parts. I am, however, a person who pretends to take some huge life altering tenet away from everything I see/read. Feel free to take a stab at what you'd think I would walk away from this movie having gained, just understand I'll neither confirm nor deny.It is pretty neat that a movie that you talk about with your friends who appreciate suggestions is set around a record store with employees that sit around discussion small bands who are worth trying.

The movie starts with Rob's breakup with his current girlfriend Laura, leading us into an explaination of his five worst breakups. Cusack  delivers a superb preformance (he also co-wrote the film) with the same  charm that made him so popular back in the eighties. There are many famous  notables. Tim Robins plays Rob's new-age neighbor, who dates Laura after  her bad breakup with Rob. Catherine Zeta Jones and Lili Taylor appear as  two of Rob's worst breakups. Also keep your eyes open for the whole Cusack  family. Once again this is a movie saved by the greatness of John Cusack,  by both his personal charm and his ability as a writer. Remember, Cusack is  an actor who helped make the romantic comedies of the 80's great.

When his girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), leaves him for the guy upstairs in their apartment building, Rob Gordon (Cusack) begins to take stock of his life by reflecting upon the ""top five break-ups"" he's suffered over the years, seeking answers to the seeming pattern of rejection that has plagued him since Junior High School.  As he does so, it establishes a thread that runs throughout the film through which some insight into Rob's (as well as some of the others) character is gleaned:  ""Top five"" lists that reference music (Rob owns a specialty record store, specializing in ""vinyl"") based on category and sub-category, with his ""break-ups"" and finally ""top five jobs,"" framing the story.  Set in Chicago, with Rob's store in a neighborhood not especially conducive to ""walk-in"" trade, Frears sets a mood and atmosphere that conveys the freedom of a rock n' roll lifestyle and evokes the yearnings of youth on the threshold of discovering reality.  Though Rob personifies an entire generation that has ""been to the mountain,"" only to be faced with coming back down again, Frears takes something of a lighthearted approach to Rob's angst, with a brisk pace and by infusing enough subtle humor (though somewhat dark at times) into the proceedings to keep it lively and entertaining.  There's a gritty, down-to-earth feel to the film, along with a sense of time and place with which anyone in the audience will be able to relate on a personal level, for this is the kind of territory, in one way or another, that most people have traversed; a vicarious route to self-discovery, if you will.  John Cusack is perfectly cast as Rob, carrying his cloud of burden with wry, almost self-deprecating amusement.  His naturally outgoing persona is just right for illuminating Rob's introspective thoughts, which he shares with the viewer by speaking directly into the camera, and it works exceptionally well, for it conveys a sense of being privy to a most intimate confidence.  And Cusack lends something of a Nicolas Cage ""hang-dog"" look to Rob, which gives him a quirky, likable appeal.  Hjejle gives a notable performance as well, as the woman in Rob's life who at last precipitates his life altering musings.  The supporting cast includes Jack Black, who turns in an exuberant, memorable performance as Barry, one of Rob's employees with aspirations of becoming a rock star; and Todd Louiso, as Dick, Rob's other employee, whose stark contrast in personality to Barry makes him equally as memorable.  Rounding out the supporting players are Lisa Bonet (Marie DeSalle), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Charlie), Joan Cusack (Liz), Tim Robbins (Ian), Lili Taylor (Sarah) and Natasha Gregson Wagner (Caroline).  Cleverly written (screenplay by D.V. DeVincentis from the book by Nick Hornby) and well presented, ""High Fidelity"" succinctly captures a specific culture and a lifestyle of ambivalence invested with obsessions and eccentricities (Rob, for example, sorts his personal record collection ""autobiographically"").  It's an entertaining, funny and sometimes insightful look at life as we know it; a good story with plenty of music, some laughs, and engaging performances, which make this film more than worth seeing, especially for fans of John Cusack, and for anyone who wants some insight into the influence popular music has indeed made upon the world in which we live.",4,"&quot;Name the top five, ALL TIME--&quot;",982540800,"02 19, 2001",2001,3618,"['man', 'suddenly', 'closer', 'middle', 'age', 'carefree', 'frivolous', 'years', 'youth', 'begins', 'understand', 'consequences', 'non-commitment', 'terms', 'relationships', 'women', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'When', 'girlfriend', 'Laura', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'guy', 'upstairs', 'apartment', 'building', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'Cusack', 'take', 'stock', 'life', 'reflecting', 'top', 'five', 'break-ups', 'suffered', 'years', 'seeking', 'answers', 'seeming', 'pattern', 'rejection', 'plagued', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'so', 'thread', 'film', 'insight', 'Rob', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'character', 'gleaned', 'Top', 'five', 'lists', 'reference', 'music', 'Rob', 'specialty', 'record', 'store', 'specializing', 'vinyl', 'based', 'category', 'sub-category', 'break-ups', 'finally', 'top', 'five', 'jobs', 'framing', 'story', 'Set', 'Chicago', 'Rob', 'store', 'neighborhood', 'not', 'especially', 'conducive', 'walk-in', 'trade', 'Frears', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'freedom', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'lifestyle', 'yearnings', 'youth', 'threshold', 'discovering', 'reality', 'Rob', 'entire', 'generation', 'been', 'mountain', 'only', 'be', 'faced', 'coming', 'back', 'down', 'again', 'Frears', 'something', 'lighthearted', 'approach', 'Rob', 'angst', 'brisk', 'pace', 'infusing', 'enough', 'subtle', 'humor', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'times', 'proceedings', 'keep', 'lively', 'entertaining', 'gritty', 'down-to-earth', 'feel', 'film', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'anyone', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'personal', 'level', 'kind', 'territory', 'one', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'traversed', 'vicarious', 'route', 'self-discovery', 'will', 'John', 'Cusack', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Rob', 'carrying', 'cloud', 'burden', 'wry', 'almost', 'self-deprecating', 'amusement', 'naturally', 'outgoing', 'persona', 'just', 'right', 'illuminating', 'Rob', 'introspective', 'thoughts', 'shares', 'viewer', 'speaking', 'directly', 'camera', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'sense', 'being', 'privy', 'most', 'intimate', 'confidence', 'Cusack', 'something', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'hang-dog', 'look', 'Rob', 'quirky', 'likable', 'appeal', 'Hjejle', 'notable', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'woman', 'Rob', 'life', 'who', 'last', 'precipitates', 'life', 'altering', 'musings', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jack', 'Black', 'who', 'exuberant', 'memorable', 'performance', 'Barry', 'one', 'Rob', 'employees', 'aspirations', 'becoming', 'rock', 'star', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'Dick', 'Rob', 'other', 'employee', 'stark', 'contrast', 'personality', 'Barry', 'equally', 'memorable', 'Rounding', 'out', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Marie', 'DeSalle', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones', 'Charlie', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Liz', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'Ian', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Sarah', 'Natasha', 'Gregson', 'Wagner', 'Caroline', 'Cleverly', 'written', 'screenplay', 'D.V', 'DeVincentis', 'book', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'well', 'presented', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'succinctly', 'specific', 'culture', 'lifestyle', 'ambivalence', 'invested', 'obsessions', 'eccentricities', 'Rob', 'example', 'personal', 'record', 'collection', 'autobiographically', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'look', 'life', 'know', 'good', 'story', 'plenty', 'music', 'laughs', 'engaging', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', 'especially', 'fans', 'John', 'Cusack', 'anyone', 'who', 'insight', 'influence', 'popular', 'music', 'indeed', 'made', 'world', 'live']",High Fidelity VHS

I have now seen this movie over ten times and I don't foresee a moment when I will get tired of watching it. Even if it's a 'little movie' (i.e. no special effects, no big epic scenes), it has it all, but mostly it is one funny, funny movie.Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a record store owner who recently broke up with his live-in girlfriend Laura (danish newcomer Iben Hjejle) and starts asking himself that old age question: what is wrong with me? He recalls his top five most hurtful breakups and starts going back to each of them in order to exorcise his relationship demons as he starts to realize that Laura might very well be the love of his life.Corny and chick-flick-y as all that sounds, this is essentially the male's equivalent of a date movie. John Cusack has forever been 'one of the guys' and most male viewers relate to his everyman screen persona. His acting here is his usual level of greatness as this is one of those characters that no other actor could have made better (he did co-write the script, so that might have helped). Bonus points come in the way of Jack Black and Todd Louiso, hilariously cast as Rob's two store assistants. Black's character Barry is basically a human Tazmanian devil and he goes and steals practically every single scene he's in. Louiso's character Dick is weirder in an introverted-loserish kind of way, but he also has some great scenes and the facial expressions on this guy are simply side splittingly funny. The dialogues between this two and Cusack are definetely the highlight of the movie.As far as the rest of the cast, it's a little 'almost' all-star ensemble of supporting characters that include Joan Cusack (John's little sister) as Rob's and Laura's friend Liz, Tim Robbins in a hilarious cameo as Ian, the upstairs neighbor with whom Laura moves after the breakup, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Charlie and Lili Taylor as Sarah, two of Rob's top five breakup exs, Lisa Bonet as Marie DeSalle, a singer with whom Rob has a little fling, Natasha Gregson-Wagner as a music columnist and Sarah Gilbert as Annaugh Moss, Todd Louiso's character's date.Aside of the wonderful dialogues that fill this movie almost start to end, the use of music is simply fantastic. You should also check out this movie's songtrack as it is full of true musical gems like Stevie Wonder's 'I believe (when I fall...)' and a very cool cover of Marvin Gaye's 'Let's get it on' performed by Jack Black.Another interesting thing about this film is the fact that Cusack's character breaks the so-called fourth wall, meaning that he speaks directly into the camera.This movie is one to buy friends.

484934,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,630595805X,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 9]","Are modern movie romances stuck in a rut?  Even the best ones lately - and ""High Fidelity"" certainly fits into that category - seem to feature characters who find themselves mired in a kind of fashionable self-centered angst that has simply become too predictable and familiar to sustain much audience interest anymore.  Infidelity, the fear of commitment, the never-ending struggle to find the perfect balance between sex and love - certainly these issues exist in exelsis in real relationships and these movies merely reflect that reality.  Yet, how many times can one watch films built around these themes without eventually becoming as inured and jaded as the lost-souled characters who comprise their worlds?  Could it be that - after years of carbon copy retreads - the romantic film genre has simply played itself out?For my money, the modern romantic comedy reached its apotheosis way back in 1977 with Woody Allen's landmark masterpiece, ""Annie Hall,"" undoubtedly the funniest and most keenly observant study of a modern day relationship.  Since that time, virtually every movie romance has borrowed heavily from that earlier film's style, theme and substance.  ""High Fidelity"" is no exception.  In this film, John Cusack delivers a high-energy performance as Rob Gordon, a 30-something Chicago record shop owner whose life seems to have come to a standstill.  Not only does he work in an environment guaranteed to keep him mired in the past - his shop sells vinyl records rather than CD's - but his most recent girlfriend has decided to walk out on him because of what she perceives to be his lack of ambition to move ahead in life.  Confronted with yet another failed relationship, Rob decides to go back and contact several earlier partners and discover why it is that he always seems to be left out in the cold.""High Fidelity"" is at its most amusing and likeable when it concentrates on the milieu of the vinyl record shop and the minions who haunt it, and less interesting when it focuses on the romantic travails of its main character.  Jack Black steals the film with his hilarious portrayal of Barry, a cocky music snob who would rather insult a customer whose taste he finds objectionable than make a profit by selling the said offender the execrable product for which he is asking.  Screenwriters D. V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg astutely zero in on this strange esoteric world where a person's innate value as a human being is determined by the kind of music he or she happens to like.  The scenarists and director Stephen Frears demonstrate a truly genuine affection for these socially backward losers who have convinced themselves that they alone hold the key to determining musical greatness and - by extension - the meaning of life itself.It is when the focus in ""High Fidelity"" moves from background to foreground that the film loses much of its uniqueness and passion.  Rob's romantic obsessions simply mirror those of far too many characters in recent similar romantic comedies.  How many more self-absorbed, whining, commitment-phobic romantic leads can we handle?  But ""High Fidelity"" borrows not merely its themes, but much of its style from ""Annie Hall"" as well.  Like Allen's character in that film, Rob often turns directly to the camera and addresses the audience with running commentary monologues that are never quite as witty or profound as the filmmakers undoubtedly intend them to be.  In another example of stylistic cribbing, Frears also occasionally interrupts the realistic flow of the action by intercutting fantasy sequences, one of which involves a guest appearance by none other than Bruce Springsteen himself (shades of Marshall McLuhan's cameo turn in ""Annie Hall"").Frears has assembled a youthful, attractive cast for the occasion including Lisa Bonet, Sara Gilbert, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner.  The fact that some of these performers have had very little screen time accorded them in the film obviously implies that they may have signed onto the project as a labor of love.  The same could probably be said for Joan Cusack, but really must she and her brother co-star in EVERY movie together?  I'm certainly not opposed to sibling devotion - but isn't it time they cut themselves loose from this rather strange tie that binds them?Like so many films, ""High Fidelity"" tends to concentrate on its majors when its minors are so much more interesting.  It is certainly a likeable enough film - but only when Jack Black is up-front and center stage does it ever really soar into comic delirium.",3,"nice background, weak foreground story",969753600,"09 24, 2000",2000,4582,"['Are', 'modern', 'movie', 'romances', 'stuck', 'rut', 'Even', 'best', 'ones', 'lately', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'certainly', 'category', 'seem', 'feature', 'characters', 'who', 'find', 'mired', 'kind', 'fashionable', 'self-centered', 'angst', 'simply', 'become', 'too', 'predictable', 'familiar', 'sustain', 'much', 'audience', 'interest', 'anymore', 'Infidelity', 'fear', 'commitment', 'never-ending', 'struggle', 'find', 'perfect', 'balance', 'sex', 'love', 'certainly', 'issues', 'exist', 'exelsis', 'real', 'relationships', 'movies', 'merely', 'reflect', 'reality', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'one', 'watch', 'films', 'built', 'themes', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'inured', 'jaded', 'lost-souled', 'characters', 'who', 'comprise', 'worlds', 'Could', 'be', 'years', 'carbon', 'copy', 'romantic', 'film', 'genre', 'simply', 'played', 'out', 'money', 'modern', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'reached', 'apotheosis', 'way', 'back', '1977', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'landmark', 'masterpiece', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'undoubtedly', 'funniest', 'most', 'keenly', 'observant', 'study', 'modern', 'day', 'relationship', 'time', 'virtually', 'movie', 'romance', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'earlier', 'film', 'style', 'theme', 'substance', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'exception', 'film', 'John', 'Cusack', 'high-energy', 'performance', 'Rob', 'Gordon', '30-something', 'Chicago', 'record', 'shop', 'owner', 'life', 'have', 'come', 'standstill', 'Not', 'only', 'work', 'environment', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'mired', 'past', 'shop', 'vinyl', 'records', 'rather', 'CD', 'most', 'recent', 'girlfriend', 'decided', 'walk', 'out', 'what', 'be', 'lack', 'ambition', 'move', 'ahead', 'life', 'Confronted', 'yet', 'failed', 'relationship', 'Rob', 'go', 'back', 'contact', 'several', 'earlier', 'partners', 'discover', 'why', 'always', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'most', 'amusing', 'likeable', 'when', 'milieu', 'vinyl', 'record', 'shop', 'minions', 'who', 'haunt', 'less', 'interesting', 'when', 'romantic', 'travails', 'main', 'character', 'Jack', 'Black', 'film', 'hilarious', 'portrayal', 'Barry', 'cocky', 'music', 'snob', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'insult', 'customer', 'taste', 'objectionable', 'make', 'profit', 'selling', 'said', 'execrable', 'product', 'asking', 'Screenwriters', 'D.', 'V.', 'DeVincentis', 'Steve', 'Pink', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Scott', 'Rosenberg', 'astutely', 'zero', 'strange', 'esoteric', 'world', 'where', 'person', 'innate', 'value', 'human', 'being', 'determined', 'kind', 'music', 'like', 'scenarists', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'demonstrate', 'truly', 'genuine', 'affection', 'socially', 'backward', 'losers', 'who', 'have', 'convinced', 'alone', 'hold', 'key', 'determining', 'musical', 'greatness', 'extension', 'meaning', 'life', 'itself.It', 'when', 'focus', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'moves', 'background', 'foreground', 'film', 'much', 'uniqueness', 'passion', 'Rob', 'romantic', 'obsessions', 'simply', 'mirror', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'recent', 'similar', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'self-absorbed', 'whining', 'commitment-phobic', 'romantic', 'leads', 'can', 'handle', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'not', 'merely', 'themes', 'much', 'style', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'as', 'well', 'Allen', 'character', 'film', 'Rob', 'often', 'directly', 'camera', 'audience', 'running', 'commentary', 'monologues', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'witty', 'profound', 'filmmakers', 'undoubtedly', 'intend', 'be', 'example', 'stylistic', 'cribbing', 'Frears', 'also', 'occasionally', 'realistic', 'flow', 'action', 'intercutting', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'one', 'guest', 'appearance', 'none', 'other', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'shades', 'Marshall', 'McLuhan', 'cameo', 'turn', 'Annie', 'Hall', 'assembled', 'youthful', 'attractive', 'cast', 'occasion', 'including', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'Sara', 'Gilbert', 'Lili', 'Taylor', 'Natasha', 'Gregson', 'Wagner', 'fact', 'performers', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'accorded', 'film', 'obviously', 'may', 'have', 'signed', 'project', 'labor', 'love', 'same', 'could', 'probably', 'be', 'said', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'really', 'must', 'brother', 'co-star', 'EVERY', 'movie', 'together', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'opposed', 'sibling', 'devotion', ""n't"", 'time', 'cut', 'loose', 'rather', 'strange', 'tie', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'concentrate', 'majors', 'when', 'minors', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'certainly', 'likeable', 'enough', 'film', 'only', 'when', 'Jack', 'Black', 'up-front', 'center', 'stage', 'ever', 'really', 'soar', 'comic', 'delirium']",High Fidelity VHS

However, the reason that this movie is so good is that while it seems you are prompted to agree and sympathize with the characters, you are, beneath the surface, really supposed to shake your head most of the time and utter under your breath, ""That's just sad.""  It's a movie where the characters and situations are loveable and realistic, but at the same time, are disagreeable and hard to watch, making the characters seem more like people you know than just characters.John Cusack stars as Rob Gordon, the owner of a less-than-mediocre Independent Records type store called Championship Vinyl.  His two best friends, aptly knighted the ""Musical Moron Twins"" in the film, are played by Jack Black (in his best performance...ever, I don't care how good he was in Orange County) and the lesser known, but no less talented Todd Louiso.  As the film progresses, you start to feel less and less like you are watching Rob, but rather that you are standing right next to him.  Most of this is because of the fact that the script is flawlessly and brilliantly adapted from the book by Nick Hornby.  (Why it wasn't nominated for an Academy Award is still a mystery.)Rob and his girlfriend Laura have just broken up, causing Rob to sit back and finally say, ""Okay, where am I now"" instead of just hitch hiking on up another road like he has been doing for so long.  In doing so, no matter how pure or independent or happy you are, you start to see a little glimpse of Rob in yourself.  Do we compare some situations in our lives with songs and movies?  Yes we do.  It's weird, but we do things like that as human beings.  High Fidelity analyzes all these crude, tacky, tasteless things we do, and puts it all in perspective, saying that, sure, we do them, but how can we stop?  It's the small, simple things that make life what it is, and what makes relating to others so much easier.  Are we always going to know our best friend's favorite vegetable?  No!  Are we almost always going to know their favorite movie?  Yes.  Films, music, books...they bring our society together.It sure is weird to think about, and on first watching High Fidelity, it will seem like the movie is poking fun at these things, but what it is really doing is encouraging it.  It's a movie analyzing the effects of movies like itself in our culture.And how many movies can you say have that theme?",5,"""You Are What You Like...""",1029542400,"08 17, 2002",2002,2460,"['above', 'quote', 'one', 'many', 'themes', 'underrated', 'masterpiece', 'satire', 'humor', 'However', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'are', 'prompted', 'agree', 'sympathize', 'characters', 'are', 'surface', 'really', 'supposed', 'shake', 'head', 'most', 'time', 'utter', 'breath', 'just', 'sad', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'loveable', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'disagreeable', 'hard', 'watch', 'making', 'characters', 'seem', 'more', 'people', 'know', 'just', 'characters.John', 'Cusack', 'stars', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'owner', 'less-than-mediocre', 'Independent', 'Records', 'type', 'store', 'called', 'Championship', 'Vinyl', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'aptly', 'knighted', 'Musical', 'Moron', 'Twins', 'film', 'are', 'played', 'Jack', 'Black', 'best', 'performance', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'Orange', 'County', 'lesser', 'known', 'less', 'talented', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'film', 'start', 'feel', 'less', 'less', 'are', 'watching', 'Rob', 'rather', 'are', 'standing', 'right', 'next', 'Most', 'fact', 'script', 'flawlessly', 'brilliantly', 'adapted', 'book', 'Nick', 'Hornby', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'still', 'mystery', 'Rob', 'girlfriend', 'Laura', 'have', 'just', 'broken', 'up', 'causing', 'Rob', 'sit', 'back', 'finally', 'say', 'Okay', 'where', 'am', 'now', 'instead', 'just', 'hitch', 'hiking', 'road', 'been', 'doing', 'so', 'long', 'doing', 'so', 'matter', 'how', 'pure', 'independent', 'happy', 'are', 'start', 'see', 'little', 'glimpse', 'Rob', 'Do', 'compare', 'situations', 'lives', 'songs', 'movies', 'Yes', 'do', 'weird', 'do', 'things', 'like', 'human', 'beings', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'crude', 'tacky', 'tasteless', 'things', 'do', 'perspective', 'saying', 'sure', 'do', 'how', 'can', 'stop', 'small', 'simple', 'things', 'make', 'life', 'what', 'what', 'relating', 'others', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'Are', 'always', 'going', 'know', 'best', 'friend', 'favorite', 'vegetable', 'No', 'Are', 'almost', 'always', 'going', 'know', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Films', 'music', 'books', 'bring', 'society', 'together.It', 'sure', 'weird', 'think', 'first', 'watching', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'will', 'seem', 'movie', 'poking', 'fun', 'things', 'what', 'really', 'doing', 'encouraging', 'movie', 'analyzing', 'effects', 'movies', 'culture.And', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'theme']",High Fidelity VHS

The tale of Rob Gordon(John Cusak) a socially awkward, music elitist who owns a small vinyl record store.When his live-in girlfriend Laura(Iben Hjejle) leaves him, Rob begins to further to wallow in his own sadness by relieving his top five heartbreaks and rejections. From his first junior high girlfriend of three days to the woman who can never be single but left him for a better option, Rob is set on deciphering exactly what it is about him that always leaves him rejected.Perhaps a slow and boring plot to some, High Fidelity is carried if nothing more, by the brilliance and pathetic portrayal of Cusak.

484943,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,630595805X,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","Nick Hornsby cracks his knuckles and flexes his literary muscle of myriad expertise on classic rock with Jon Cusack serving as interpreter in this wry adaptation of a thirty-something slummer who works in a vinyl shop on a street corner in bustling Chicago (a minor amendment from the original London locale in the novel). He and fellow companions and employees Dick and Barry wax musical theorem while relentlessly bullying each other intermittently about life's mundane grievances, the primary woe being the deteriorating relationship between Rob Gordon (Cusack) and his live-in girlfriend Laura. Upon the painful incident of Laura packing her bags, Rob reexamines his past relationships and revisits each erstwhile acquaintance to translate the mystery of why he is always destined to be discarded. Along his quixotic jaunt for explanation to his romantic blunders, his own faults begin to surface and he makes the daring transition to compromise, eventually winning his lovelorn Laura and her worldly possessions back to his lower-class bungalow and newly autobiographical assorted LPs.Cusack is a veteran at these brands of characters, and if I didn't know that Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons, The Grifters) directed this movie, I would be led to believe it is the &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; alumnus Cameron Crowe that is responsible for the critical acclaim of this film. So many faces from Crowe's &quot;Say Anything&quot; appear in this movie that it makes it that much more deceiving besides the fact that Jon is reprising one of those familiar sardonic slacker roles and the comical content of the film. However, Crowe would never attempt the first-person narrative style that Frears puts to use here, Cusack making direct eye contact with the camera and addressing his audience with endless rhetoric and emotional outbursts. What with this amusing directorial method and the string of existing monologues, this movie could successfully be converted into a stage comedy. The sets are minimal (providing opportunity for easy scene changes) and a great deal of the dialogue is simple human interaction, a character study at best description.I felt an uncontrollable smile cross my face every time Jack Black (Barry) whirled into action with his wired temperament and snide charisma. He is a robust comedic presence in this film, detracting from all other performers every he bursts onto the scene. I particularly enjoyed his cynical tirades and the befitting physical appearance of a stereotypical small-business clerk (scraggly, greasy hair and vintage duds paired with worn jeans and low-top Converse). He is a rabid but skilled scene-stealer in my amateur-but-soon-to-be-professional opinion and I am glad he finally gets his chance to shine, quelling the sideman routine in such films as &quot;Cable Guy&quot;, opposite the full-out farce of Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick. Todd Louiso (Dick) was too perfect as the queerly-calm loner who contains encyclopedic knowledge of every underground musical group ever created. This is not his first acting affiliation with mystifying composition: he played the &quot;child technician&quot; in the yet-again-mentioned film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, obssessed with the beauty of &quot;jaaazzz&quot;. He is the perfect compliment to the slacker trio and a pure joy to watch.Newcomer Iben Hjejle was a talented and intriguing neophyte as Rob's weepy-eyed lover suffering from a mid-life crisis and nomadic tendencies. Her character was somewhat complex and mistrusting, the male-view quintessence of the enigmatic female species. She conveyed her mental struggle with her situation well and I hope to see her in the future in lucrative projects. Lastly, the many cameos from well-known actors/actresses and close, personal friends of Cusack were amusing and apposite. Lili Taylor was perfect as the clingy, rebound girlfriend Sarah(similar situation in &quot;Say Anything&quot; as the ditched musician) and Catherine Zeta-Jones was sparkling and charismatic as the unearthly Charlie Nickelson, Rob's favorite of his five failed relationships. Joelle Carter was perky and pretty as Penny Harwick, her All-American, Wrigley Spearmint visage reminding me greatly of the overly-elated actress who played Patty Simcox in 1978's &quot;Grease&quot;. Tim Robbins was a weird choice as the Zen-infused playboy Ian/Ray but he did a good job portraying an &quot;I-am-cooler-than-an-ice-cube&quot; front. Not a big surprise to again see Cusack's actress-sister Joan playing a close friend. She did the same in &quot;Say Anything&quot; except as his sister (whoa, big surprise there, huh?).As a whole, this movie is intelligent and whimsical, providing much insight into the pathos of relationships and the effort it takes to recognize and hold a valuable one together. I enjoy seeing Cusack play roles like this but I think it's time he broke the barrier and pursued more diverse and more promising projects. Kudos Jon. Just don't wear it thin...",4,"Romantic Hijinks, Musical Theorem (4.5 stars)",970185600,"09 29, 2000",2000,4991,"['Nick', 'Hornsby', 'knuckles', 'flexes', 'literary', 'muscle', 'myriad', 'expertise',

484944,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,630595805X,Steve,"[4, 7]","Hi Fidelity is one of the many movies that comes highly recommended and fails to deliver. In keeping with the spirit of it, however, let me present The Top Five reasons that Hi Fidelity is an average movie:1. John Cusack. He is an actor I'm not sold on by any means despite having seen many of his films. Herein he does his Woody Allen best to talk to the audience about his failed relationships. I don't know what it is about Cusack specifically, maybe it's his weasely look, maybe it's the lack of charisma that some actors have and that others don't, or maybe it's the fact that all the smoking, hunched over slacker posing, and Intro to Drama mannerisms he employs fail to convince me that he is capable of carrying a film, especially as an adult. For comparative purposes, Jack Black steals every scene he is in, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones.2. The film fails to deliver on either the romantic or comedic level, the two genres it's targeted towards. Not ever funny enough (save the fantasy sequence with Robbins in the record store) or romantic enough, it left me wanting so much more.3. The premise is clogged by errors that undermine it completely. More glaring; how is it that this man of Top Five lists, who obsesses about chronicling his life and the minutiae therein into portable containers of memory, not realize until years afterward that one of his five biggest break-ups was caused by him and thus not even a part of his list? It would be akin to maintaining a Top Five records list that features a t.v. show. That seems so incredible to me that I almost wondered why the film put it in. I assume it's to show that his hindsight has sharpened some and he can absorb the blame that he used to reflect onto others, but I'm not convinced.4. Given number three, I'm not sold on his relationship and life epiphanies, and so, reason four. Zeta-Jones' character has it right when she rolls her eyes in exasperation at yet another ""what is it all about?"" person who can solve such a momentous question by focusing solely on failed relationships. It's the equivalent of trying to find a cure for cancer by focusing on male enhancement formulas. Furthermore, when he does make some realizations, he makes the wrong ones! Say what you want about her shallow character or Black's elitist music geek; they both stay honest to their core personality.5. He chooses the wrong girl. He settles. He makes the choice that this woman, for whom he clearly has major problems, is the answer to his dreams simply because he is tired of looking. That's it. You can couch it in your own terms, but for me, his revelation to his on/off girlfriend that he has decided against pursuing the record reviewing woman who recently entered his life for her and their problematic relationship is a safe, scared, and uninspired moment of clarity. Call me bitter, a romantic idiot, a dreamer, a relationship elitist, or whatever you wish, but if you are really happy with the person you are with, if you really can't wait to see them each day, if the rest of the people in the world disappear when they enter the room, why would you ever find yourself considering someone else? That's not true love, that's settling for satisfactory. He should have moved forward and tried life with the other girl instead of moving backward. Maybe he grew up some and assumed some responsibility and ownership for his life. If that's the moral of the story, forgive me for not agreeing. If you believe that growing up and maturing means settling into the slow, passive crawl to death, go right ahead. Cusack's Rob character is thus a faux-rebel; a person who outwardly wants to be different and unique and fight the system that grinds romantic souls into complacent couples, but inwardly he longs to get off the train at Cul de Sac, USA where satisfied couples gather on Saturdays with the women drinking Merlot inside and talking about their new house additions or taking care of the kids and the guys in the back yard drinking light beer and comparing barbecue grills or titanium drivers. The moral of that story? Find any way you can to stuff material items into the emptiness in your heart and soul. Can you smell the banality? Me, I'm going after The One until I find her and I won't settle for less and I'll consequently avoid ever repeating those pathetic suburban nightmares that I once endured.Hi Fidelity settles.",2,Settling for the safe route,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,4386,"['Hi', 'Fidelity', 'one', 'many', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommended', 'deliver', 'keeping', 'spirit', 'however', 'let', 'present', 'Top', 'Five', 'reasons', 'Hi', 'Fidelity', 'average', 'movie:1', 'John', 'Cusack', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'sold', 'means', 'having', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'Herein', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'best', 'talk', 'audience', 'failed', 'relationships', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Cusack', 'specifically', 'maybe', 'weasely', 'look', 'maybe', 'lack', 'charisma', 'actors', 'have', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'fact', 'smoking', 'hunched', 'slacker', 'posing', 'Intro', 'Drama', 'mannerisms', 'fail', 'convince', 'capable', 'carrying', 'film', 'especially', 'adult', 'comparative', 'purposes', 'Jack', 'Black', 'steals', 'scene', 'Catherine', 'Zeta-Jones.2', 'film', 'deliver', 'romantic', 'comedic', 'level', 'two', 'genres', 'targeted', 'towards', 'Not', 'ever', 'funny', 'enough', 'save', 'fantasy', 'sequence', 'Robbins', 'record', 'store', 'romantic', 'enough', 'left', 'wanting', 'so', 'much', 'more.3', 'premise', 'clogged', 'errors', 'undermine', 'completely', 'More', 'glaring', 'how', 'man', 'Top', 'Five', 'lists', 'who', 'chronicling', 'life', 'minutiae', 'therein', 'portable', 'containers', 'memory', 'not', 'realize', 'years', 'afterward', 'one', 'five', 'biggest', 'break-ups', 'was', 'caused', 'thus', 'not', 'even', 'part', 'list', 'would', 'be', 'akin', 'maintaining', 'Top', 'Five', 'records', 'list', 't.v', 'show', 'so', 'incredible', 'almost', 'wondered', 'why', 'film', 'put', 'assume', 'show', 'hindsight', 'sharpened', 'can', 'absorb', 'blame', 'used', 'reflect', 'others', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced.4', 'Given', 'number', 'three', ""'m"", 'not', 'sold', 'relationship', 'life', 'epiphanies', 'so', 'reason', 'four', 'Zeta-Jones', 'character', 'right', 'when', 'eyes', 'exasperation', 'yet', 'what', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'solve', 'momentous', 'question', 'focusing', 'solely', 'failed', 'relationships', 'equivalent', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'cancer', 'focusing', 'male', 'enhancement', 'formulas', 'Furthermore', 'when', 'make', 'realizations', 'wrong', 'ones', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'shallow', 'character', 'Black', 'elitist', 'music', 'geek', 'stay', 'honest', 'core', 'personality.5', 'wrong', 'girl', 'choice', 'woman', 'whom', 'clearly', 'major', 'problems', 'answer', 'dreams', 'simply', 'tired', 'looking', 'can', 'couch', 'own', 'terms', 'revelation', 'on/off', 'girlfriend', 'decided', 'pursuing', 'record', 'reviewing', 'woman', 'who', 'recently', 'entered', 'life', 'problematic', 'relationship', 'safe', 'scared', 'uninspired', 'moment', 'clarity', 'Call', 'bitter', 'romantic', 'idiot', 'dreamer', 'relationship', 'elitist', 'wish', 'are', 'really', 'happy', 'person', 'are', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'day', 'rest', 'people', 'world', 'disappear', 'when', 'enter', 'room', 'why', 'would', 'ever', 'find', 'considering', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'true', 'love', 'settling', 'satisfactory', 'should', 'have', 'moved', 'forward', 'tried', 'life', 'other', 'girl', 'instead', 'moving', 'backward', 'Maybe', 'grew', 'up', 'assumed', 'responsibility', 'ownership', 'life', 'moral', 'story', 'forgive', 'not', 'agreeing', 'believe', 'growing', 'up', 'maturing', 'means', 'settling', 'slow', 'passive', 'crawl', 'death', 'go', 'right', 'ahead', 'Cusack', 'Rob', 'character', 'thus', 'faux-rebel', 'person', 'who', 'outwardly', 'be', 'different', 'unique', 'fight', 'system', 'romantic', 'souls', 'complacent', 'couples', 'inwardly', 'get', 'off', 'train', 'Cul', 'Sac', 'USA', 'where', 'satisfied', 'couples', 'gather', 'Saturdays', 'women', 'drinking', 'Merlot', 'inside', 'talking', 'new', 'house', 'additions', 'taking', 'care', 'kids', 'guys', 'back', 'yard', 'drinking', 'light', 'beer', 'comparing', 'barbecue', 'grills', 'titanium', 'drivers', 'moral', 'story', 'way', 'can', 'stuff', 'material', 'items', 'emptiness', 'heart', 'soul', 'Can', 'smell', 'banality', 'Me', ""'m"", 'going', 'One', 'find', 'wo', ""n't"", 'settle', 'less', ""'ll"", 'consequently', 'avoid', 'ever', 'repeating', 'pathetic', 'suburban', 'nightmares', 'once', 'endured.Hi', 'Fidelity', 'settles']",High Fidelity VHS

What I got was one of John Cusack's best performances, as the insecure, brooding, introspective record shop owner.I likely was one of those vinyl geeks that populated Cusack's store in my earlier years, though I don't recall ever getting quite so cranked up as Jack Black did on that customer who wanted the Stevie Wonder record.Black by the way is obnoxious as hell, but here it worked brilliantly.  Todd Louiso as the painfully shy co-worker was also good, and the list of fine supporting actors made this film exceptional.Cusack's Woody Allenesque discussions about his screwed up life with the viewers lend some insight to just how he got where he did, and it seemed like everyone I know who saw it caught some of themselves in there.So if you've ever wondered why people keep around stacks and stacks of vinyl, here's a possible answer...just don't start thinking institutionalization for them.",4,"A great view of human nature, and ourselves",1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,971,"['was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'rented', 'High', 'Fidelity', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'one', 'John', 'Cusack', 'best', 'performances', 'insecure', 'brooding', 'introspective', 'record', 'shop', 'owner.I', 'likely', 'was', 'one', 'vinyl', 'geeks', 'populated', 'Cusack', 'store', 'earlier', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'getting', 'quite', 'so', 'cranked', 'up', 'Jack', 'Black', 'did', 'customer', 'who', 'wanted', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'record.Black', 'way', 'obnoxious', 'hell', 'here', 'worked', 'brilliantly', 'Todd', 'Louiso', 'painfully', 'shy', 'co-worker', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'list', 'fine', 'supporting', 'actors', 'made', 'film', 'exceptional.Cusack', 'Woody', 'Allenesque', 'discussions', 'screwed', 'up', 'life', 'viewers', 'lend', 'insight', 'just', 'how', 'got', 'where', 'did', 'seemed', 'everyone', 'know', 'who', 'saw', 'caught', 'there.So', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'people', 'keep', 'stacks', 'stacks', 'vinyl', 'here', 'possible', 'answer', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'thinking', 'institutionalization']",High Fidelity VHS

Although the novel by Nick Horby is set in London and the movie is in Chicago, the overall vibe and feel of the book is still present in the movie.2) John Cusack is wonderful as Rob, the thirtysomething who is still walking wounded from breaking up with his girlfriend.  His performance hits all the right notes.  You can see the sadness in his eyes when he pleads with Laura to stay.  Even though he is clearly flawed and did some nasty things with Laura, we build rapport with him and feel sympathetic.3) The soundtrack rocks!  No trendy, of-the-moment, TRL pop.4) The references to musicians and records are always witty.  Music lovers and record collectors will be smiling and nodding their heads in approval.5) This is a great, honest film about male heartbreak, medning broken relationships, and growing up.

I think a lot of people will  see it that way.Anyhow, John Cusack whose niche seems to be playing  losers (Better Off Dead, Say Anything, Being John Malkovich, Tapeheads,  etc.) plays one of the most appealing losers since Lloyd from Say Anything.  His girlfriend has left him. His career is running a failing record store.  He decides to go over all his past relationships to figure out what went  wrong. Worse is that his girlfriend keeps coming back for her stuff and you  start to realize that she is perfect for him, even as she walks off to  start something with the politically correct granola ponytail wearing  upstairs neighbor played with smug self-satisfaction by Tim Robbins (in the  scene where John Cusack wants to beat him senseless, Tim Robbins plays the  part so you the audience would also like to beat him senseless)Through a  series of lists (five most humiliating breakups, five best songs about  burning things up. four things that my ex- told her best friend to make her  best friend hate my guts)his two friends at the record store (they fit the  record store stereotype clerk to the hilt - or comic book store clerk or  any store with a cool selection. one's a jerk and the other one's a freaky  loner) and a brief affair with Lisa Bonet (whose version of &quot;Baby I  Love Your Ways&quot; SHOULD be on the soundtrack but isn't.) and the  meetings with the previously mentioned five most humiliating breakups, the  main character stops relating to the world as a carnival that's out to  stick him in the lion cage and starts gaining perspective, even  maturity.By the end with John Cusack back with his girlfriend, you have  absolutely no idea if they are going to stay together or break up again,  but you really want them to stay together. If only to give the notion that  it's worth growing up. This is a long movie, a movie with many subplots and  counter subplots but an honest movie and a movie that will go down as one  of the classics of honest romance movies in a sea of saccharine junk with  plots that were written from a standard romantic plotline (they meet, they  go out, they sleep together, they break up, they get back together in a  funny sequence at the end, the audience falls asleep, etc.) Original beauty  and it makes me hope that the rest of Hornby's books should also be adapted  for the screen.",5,"One of the best movies about love, whining, ambivalence",962582400,"07 3, 2000",2000,2611,"['are', 'rare', 'movies', 'watch', 'go', 'quot', 'Me', 'quot', 'are', 'especially', 'great', 'movies', 'next', 'thought', 'head', 'quot', ""'m"", 'idiot', 'quot', 'watched', 'movie', 'missed', 'fighting', 'ex-girlfriend', 'who', 'still', 'best', 'friend', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'way.Anyhow', 'John', 'Cusack', 'niche', 'be', 'playing', 'losers', 'Better', 'Off', 'Dead', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Tapeheads', 'etc', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'losers', 'Lloyd', 'Say', 'Anything', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'career', 'running', 'failing', 'record', 'store', 'go', 'over', 'past', 'relationships', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Worse', 'girlfriend', 'keeps', 'coming', 'back', 'stuff', 'start', 'realize', 'perfect', 'even', 'walks', 'off', 'start', 'something', 'politically', 'correct', 'granola', 'ponytail', 'wearing', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'played', 'smug', 'self-satisfaction', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'scene', 'where', 'John', 'Cusack', 'beat', 'senseless', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'part', 'audience', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'beat', 'senseless', 'series', 'lists', 'five', 'most', 'humiliating', 'breakups', 'five', 'best', 'songs', 'burning', 'things', 'up', 'four', 'things', 'ex-', 'told', 'best', 'friend', 'make', 'best', 'friend', 'hate', 'guts', 'two', 'friends', 'record', 'store', 'fit', 'record', 'store', 'stereotype', 'clerk', 'hilt', 'comic', 'book', 'store', 'clerk', 'store', 'cool', 'selection', 'one', 'jerk', 'other', 'one', 'freaky', 'loner', 'brief', 'affair', 'Lisa', 'Bonet', 'version', 'quot', 'Baby', 'Love', 'Your', 'Ways', 'quot', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'meetings', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'five', 'most', 'humiliating', 'breakups', 'main', 'character', 'stops', 'relating', 'world', 'carnival', 'out', 'stick', 'lion', 'cage', 'gaining', 'perspective', 'even', 'end', 'John', 'Cusack', 'back', 'girlfriend', 'have', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'are', 'going', 'stay', 'together', 'break', 'up', 'again', 'really', 'want', 'stay', 'together', 'only', 'give', 'notion', 'growing', 'up', 'long', 'movie', 'movie', 'many', 'subplots', 'counter', 'subplots', 'honest', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'classics', 'honest', 'romance', 'movies', 'sea', 'saccharine', 'junk', 'plots', 'were', 'written', 'standard', 'romantic', 'plotline', 'meet', 'go', 'out', 'sleep', 'together', 'break', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'funny', 'sequence', 'end', 'audience', 'asleep', 'etc', 'Original', 'beauty', 'hope', 'rest', 'Hornby', 'books', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'adapted', 'screen']",High Fidelity VHS

Its really sad to think that the only reason some people are together is just because they have nothing better to do, but I guess it happens.The plot is that this guy (John Cusack, ""Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil"") who owns a record store (CHAMPIONSHIP VINYL, but only in the movie, in real life its called something else, of course) has two friends and a girlfriend who are basically the only three people in his life at the moment. But Then, his girlfriend leaves him, and then he starts this crazy TOP 5 LIST of his worst breakups that ultimatly leads to a trip to find the past girlfriends to get ""The MEANING of it all"" (Why he is destined to be left by the only girl he truly has feelings for).The movie has a bit of a confused ending where it seems like the only reason for what takes place, is because Someone dies and the girl just wants to ""FEEL SOMETHING DIFFERENT"" (something other than the pain of loss I guess). sorry for those that liked it but it was a STUPID ENDING.It was a very poorly done film with holes in the script that I think Could have been done a Lot Better with a little more thought put into it, sort of a sleeper hit.

His acting and the way he goes through the dialogues and monologues are very satisfying to watch. I am sure everyone will be able to identify Rob with himself at some part of the movie.

What if you decided to forsake everything else in your life to make a career out of those passions? Looking back, what would you think?Rob Gordon (played by John Cusack) is a lifelong Chicago resident and owner of his own record store. The store, Championship Vinyl, attracts very few window shoppers and almost as few intentional customers. The staff consists of Rob, Barry (played by Jack Black), and Dick (played by Todd Louiso). Originally hired to work two days a week, Barry (Black) and Dick (Louiso) decided instead to show up every day. Their personalities are complete mirror images of each other, Barry being loud and opinionated (one of many reasons that Jack Black was perfect for the role) and Dick being soft-spoken and deferential. What they and Rob have in common with each other is an almost encyclopedic knowledge of music and a superior attitude as a result. When we join the story, Rob is being dumped by his live-in girlfriend, Laura. Laura (played by Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has chosen to leave in the evening and Rob, vehemently opposed to the idea, elects to shout out the window as Laura drives away. Rob then proceeds to list the five most devastating breakups in his romantic past, purposely excluding Laura from the list. Noticing that all those relationships ended at the urging of the other party, Rob decides that he is doomed to be rejected. He reaches out to his first girlfriend, a girl he kissed for two hours a day for three days before finding her kissing someone else on the fourth day. While he fails to find his middle school love, her sister informs him that the boy Rob saw her kissing on the first day is now her husband and that they live in Australia. In fact, the woman he speaks to is under the impression that her sister's husband was actually her first boyfriend. Rob tries to disabuse her of this notion but the sister, believing him to be delusional, hangs up. Rob, now believing that his circumstances are the result of fate and not any sort of failure on his part, plans to reach out to his other former partners. Penny Hardwick (played by Joelle Carter) who would not allow the intimacy between them to progress past kissing, Charlie Nicholson (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) who rejected him and began a relationship with a coworker, and Sarah Kendrew (played by Lily Taylor) who found the ideal relationship with each other, both having been rejected and fearing they would never find their true soul mate. Sarah found someone else while still with Rob and ended things with absolutely no warning.This is one of those rare comedies that displays truly inspiring performances. Jack Black is, well Jack Black, but he is a valuable addition to the cast and the story. Cusack as Rob plays a character that we lose sympathy for on more than one occasion but ultimately find ourselves rooting for.

Rob, in accord with his professional interests, seems to relish the initial part of his romantic relationships, as he begins each such relationship with compiling a mixtape for the latest object of his affection.  After losing Laura, however, he begins to question his approach to women, and so embarks on a quest involving catching up on former girlfriends with an eye to figuring out where he went wrong.For me, the most interesting part of this quest was Rob visiting his college girlfriend ""Charlie"" played by Catherine Zeta Jones. Although his initially idealized recollection of their time as a couple filled him with wonder at her many brilliant insights, meeting her again brought about the realization that virtually every thing she said (and continued to say) was ridiculous!  Rob's reassessment of Charlie went a long way to him adopting more realistic expectations of the women in his life and helped him to move closer to a sustainable relationship.",5,Record store owner comes to terms with the women in his life--and the broader issues they represent,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",2013,1146,"['John', 'Cusack', 'character', 'Rob', 'Gordon', 'record', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'falling', 'out', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'Laura', 'charming', 'woman', 'played', 'Danish', 'actress', 'Iben', 'Hjejle', 'Rob', 'accord', 'professional', 'interests', 'relish', 'initial', 'part', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'such', 'relationship', 'compiling', 'mixtape', 'latest', 'object', 'affection', 'losing', 'Laura', 'however', 'question', 'approach', 'women', 'so', 'embarks', 'quest', 'involving', 'catching', 'up', 'former', 'girlfriends', 'eye', 'figuring', 'out', 'where', 'went', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'quest', 'was', 'Rob', 'visiting', 'college', 'girlfriend', 'Charlie', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Zeta', 'Jones', 'initially', 'idealized', 'recollection', 'time', 'couple', 'filled', 'wonder', 'many', 'brilliant', 'insights', 'meeting', 'again', 'brought', 'realization', 'virtually', 'thing', 'said', 'continued', 'say', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'Rob', 'reassessment', 'Charlie', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'adopting', 'more', 'realistic', 'expectations', 'women', 'life', 'helped', 'move', 'closer', 'sustainable', 'relationship']",High Fidelity VHS

There is some good acting all around but not much of a story. Cusack has a fantasy job; no boss, no apparent concern about cash flow or creditors. And a fantasy girlfriend; attractive, slim, blond, high paying job, professional degree, wealthy parents, expensive car. Hey, isn't that supposed to be the guy?The conflict stems from the fact that Cusack hasn't grown up yet. He doesn't grow up in the film either.  He spends so much time talking to the camera it ends up as a little bit of a movie superimposed over Cusack's monologue. I welcomed the closing credits just to hear him shut up.  To add to the annoyance he chain smokes through the whole thing.To be fair it's probably a good date movie but nothing more.
