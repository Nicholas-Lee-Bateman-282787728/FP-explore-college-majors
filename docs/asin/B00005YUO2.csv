Set in the year 1977, the film revolves around the efforts of his younger brother Mikal (Giovanni Ribisi) to stop the execution, even against his brothers wishes; because Gilmore sees himself gaining permanent notoriety, he even has t-shirts with GILMORE printed on them. While well acted, the film's pace is rather stodgy and interesting only occasionally. That same year a punk song by The Adverts called GARY GILMORE'S EYES was released. The song is only a couple of minutes long. This movie is over 90 minutes. Download the song and try and find it in your heart to forgive screenwriter Frank Pugliese for making such a snoozer out of potentially interesting material.

The allusions and foreshadowing are so well done, and the references to blood atonement made my jaw drop. I had no clue this even happened until I watched this movie, but I'm glad I have an idea now. I know what &quot;Looking Through Gary Gilmore's Eyes&quot; is about now! But besides that, Elias Kotes is amazing as Gary, especially during the shoelace scene. And Giovanni Ribisi - I won't even begin to describe how wonderful he was. His character portrayed that of a man still growing up, and it was really cool to watch.I seriously would have given this movie 5 stars, except that I'm a really weird person and not many people have the ability to sit and watch movies like this - it's a slow drama, and I can understand why others might click it off before giving it a chance.

690757,AGSWTH7SP2256,B00005YUO2,R. W. Rasband,"[2, 2]","This is HBO's movie version of director Agnieszka Holland's adaptation of Mikal Gilmore's book ""Shot In the Heart"". It is produced by Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, the guys behind the late, great TV series ""Homicide"" and ""Oz"", and the end credits say the film was shot mostly in Baltimore, the locale of ""Homicide"" (there are some exterior shots of Salt Lake, including Temple Square; and Provo canyon.) Giovanni Ribisi plays Mikal Gilmore and Elias Koteas is Gary Gilmore (a far cry from his kind-hearted soldier in the movie ""The Thin Red Line."") The playwright Sam Shepard portrays Frank Gilmore, Sr. and Amy Madigan is Bessie Gilmore. The film lacks the epic, time- and space-spanning quality of Mikal's book. It's more an intense chamber piece; I can easily envision a stage version. It's very reminiscent of an episode of ""Homicide""; it has the same dark intensity. It uses Mikal's scary tales of rural Utah Mormon mythology: blood atonement, three Nephites (pronounced here ""Neff-ites"") and ghosts. We see things from Mikal's perspective, so it's possible to see these elements as part of a depiction of a disturbed family's collective world-view. We choose to see what we want to see, and the bloody ethos depicted here is real, but it's only a partial glimpse of the local heritage. It's a gripping film, but for LDS viewers, caveat emptor.",4,"Moody, Absorbing Adaptation Of A Great Book",1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1351,"['HBO', 'movie', 'version', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'adaptation', 'Mikal', 'Gilmore', 'book', 'Shot', 'Heart', 'produced', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'Tom', 'Fontana', 'guys', 'late', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'Homicide', 'Oz', 'end', 'credits', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'Baltimore', 'locale', 'Homicide', 'are', 'exterior', 'shots', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'including', 'Temple', 'Square', 'Provo', 'canyon', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'Mikal', 'Gilmore', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'Gary', 'Gilmore', 'far', 'cry', 'kind-hearted', 'soldier', 'movie', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'playwright', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Frank', 'Gilmore', 'Sr.', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Bessie', 'Gilmore', 'film', 'epic', 'time-', 'space-spanning', 'quality', 'Mikal', 'book', 'more', 'intense', 'chamber', 'piece', 'can', 'easily', 'envision', 'stage', 'version', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'episode', 'Homicide', 'same', 'dark', 'intensity', 'Mikal', 'scary', 'tales', 'rural', 'Utah', 'Mormon', 'mythology', 'blood', 'atonement', 'three', 'Nephites', 'pronounced', 'here', 'Neff-ites', 'ghosts', 'see', 'things', 'Mikal', 'perspective', 'possible', 'see', 'elements', 'part', 'depiction', 'disturbed', 'family', 'collective', 'world-view', 'choose', 'see', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'bloody', 'ethos', 'depicted', 'here', 'real', 'only', 'partial', 'glimpse', 'local', 'heritage', 'gripping', 'film', 'LDS', 'viewers', 'caveat', 'emptor']",N/A

At times this film dragged and I liked the flashbacks the most. Where you got to know what made Gilmore the man he became.

I think incarceration for life is enough and let God be the judge.
