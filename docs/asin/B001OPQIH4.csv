1222984,A3QO324Z4CUNNO,B001OPQIH4,"Charles Stuckey ""stuck-fla""","[0, 0]","First, the first half of the series might have been suitable for older children and teens if not for the opening, closing and commercial break markers, and is still probably fine for mid to upper teens. Some of the subject matter on relationships may not be so suitable for immature teens. Note also, some of the subject matter may be disturbing to some parents, especially toward the end and at the ending of the series, which gets a little dark in parts.Before getting into the sticking points, I'll say it's a pretty good series for mature audiences. (Due to conceptual content). I think it was worth the time to watch.Despite there being magic in the setting and series, it's mostly played down and uncommon. The setting is modern day high school students stuff. The story is fairly standard One Boy, Four (plus) girls chasing him to be his girlfriend/wife type romantic comedy, at least to start with. The second half shifts to a lot of serious moments about the meaning of relationships and where to draw the line between friendships and competition (teen angst type stuff, but handled more maturely than most). Pulling the ""there's a second person inside of me"" trick twice seemed a bit flat. The final ""choice"" becomes predictable by (or before) 2/3 through the series, but seeing how he finally gets there and what he does about it keeps it interesting. Overall I'd call it above average, with excellent writing in the area of relationships and the dumb things some people do in or for them. The comedy drops off to a large extent in the second half of the series and it leans more toward a romantic drama. Personally I found this a little disappointing, but it didn't hurt the series overall. I'd say it was probably worth the money.",4,"Romantic comedy, personal choices.",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,1743,"['First', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'suitable', 'older', 'children', 'teens', 'not', 'opening', 'closing', 'commercial', 'break', 'markers', 'still', 'probably', 'fine', 'mid', 'upper', 'teens', 'subject', 'matter', 'relationships', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'suitable', 'immature', 'teens', 'Note', 'also', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'be', 'disturbing', 'parents', 'especially', 'end', 'ending', 'series', 'little', 'dark', 'parts.Before', 'getting', 'sticking', 'points', ""'ll"", 'say', 'pretty', 'good', 'series', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Due', 'conceptual', 'content', 'think', 'was', 'time', 'watch.Despite', 'being', 'magic', 'setting', 'series', 'mostly', 'played', 'down', 'uncommon', 'setting', 'modern', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'stuff', 'story', 'fairly', 'standard', 'One', 'Boy', 'Four', 'girls', 'chasing', 'be', 'girlfriend/wife', 'type', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'least', 'start', 'second', 'half', 'shifts', 'lot', 'serious', 'moments', 'meaning', 'relationships', 'where', 'draw', 'line', 'friendships', 'competition', 'teen', 'angst', 'type', 'stuff', 'handled', 'more', 'maturely', 'most', 'Pulling', 'second', 'person', 'trick', 'twice', 'seemed', 'bit', 'flat', 'final', 'choice', 'becomes', 'predictable', '2/3', 'series', 'seeing', 'how', 'finally', 'there', 'what', 'interesting', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'call', 'above', 'average', 'excellent', 'writing', 'area', 'relationships', 'dumb', 'things', 'people', 'do', 'comedy', 'large', 'extent', 'second', 'half', 'series', 'more', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Personally', 'found', 'little', 'disappointing', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'series', 'overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'probably', 'money']",Shuffle!: The Complete Series
1222985,A182VTJIIEVM37,B001OPQIH4,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","Over the summer, I decided before going to college was to look for a harem series on Netflex and watch the dub. This series is known for having a good English dub despite how most people always say the Japanese version is better. This claim is false because not only is the dub better, some things are changed to make thing easier. Its already stupid when the main guy Rin and one of his love interest is also named Rin so they changed her name to Nerine, and that sounds way better.The story as mentioned is about an ordinary high school student Rin who as normal as he is and then suddenly God and Satan's child come to him and want to marry him because of something he did for them in the past. Their fathers encourage the battle for Rin's heart (and he's not too amused at this).I like this harem series because there is so much character development within the episodes given. Each girl has their own arc so they're not being overshadowed by the other and all have an equal chance of getting Rin EXCEPT Primula (and this is because she has the body of a little girl and not wanting to go the controversial route in the anime, Primula is kept as a little sister despite having an arc midway through the season.) Each girl is shown to have strengths and weaknesses and all of them have issues that you wouldn't think this series would touch on.Of course, everyone knows this series for the box cutter scene that a lot of people blow out of proportion and try to put this anime in School Days category.That's the problem of this anime. Out of all the girls in the harem, I really hate Kaede. Now I already spoke in my Baka to the Test review that I have a strong hate for yandere characters given how much they can get away with despite them physically or emotionally hurting the people they claim to love. A lot of people feel sorry for what Kaede has to go through as the series goes on, but I honestly could not sympathize with Kaede. This jealousy she has for the girl that Rin has his sights on comes out of nowhere. She didn't show signs of this insanity when the other girls are around, so for her to flip out on this particular girl just seem to be her lashing out at the fact that she lost the guy she loved despite being there from the beginning. Plus given her backstory, I don't feel bad for her at all when she's the reason for the box cutter scene and I just see her whining during her arc when she needs to get over herself. I know this sounds harsh, but this is how I honestly feel about Kaede and I feel like her arc while it brought tension was just there to add a yandere given that not a lot of harem series actually have a yandere that actively tries to attack the competition and its played seriously (School Days doesn't count). I think the worse part is how Rin and the girl he likes are blamed for her craziness (I admit Rin is at fault for not paying attention to her mental health but she's been fine ever since her breakdown so how was he supposed to know she would crack again and only Primula watched it happen. Then the girl is blamed because she stole Rin away (and Kaede says she did) when Rin never even liked Kaede and even though she knew Kaede had feelings for Rin, all was fair in love and war and the other girls slowly gave up when they realized that Rin liked this girl.)Beside my ranting, I think the missed opportunity was not expanding on the world of Shuffle. Shuffle is a world where demons, Gods and humans live in harmony and beside the Primula and Nerine arc (they share it), the Heaven/Hell is never touched upon and its just a waste given how all the girls seems to have some sort of magical power never touched on.So overall I give the anime an 8/10 because of the unnecessary yandere arc (though I admit that during the breakdown, the English dub nailed Kaede's insanity perfectly and I give props for that) and not expanding on the magic world.",4,Great Harem but There are Some Flaws,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,3900,"['summer', 'decided', 'before', 'going', 'college', 'was', 'look', 'harem', 'series', 'Netflex', 'watch', 'dub', 'series', 'known', 'having', 'good', 'English', 'dub', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'always', 'say', 'Japanese', 'version', 'better', 'claim', 'false', 'not', 'only', 'dub', 'better', 'things', 'are', 'changed', 'make', 'thing', 'easier', 'already', 'stupid', 'when', 'main', 'guy', 'Rin', 'one', 'love', 'interest', 'also', 'named', 'Rin', 'changed', 'name', 'Nerine', 'way', 'better.The', 'story', 'mentioned', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Rin', 'who', 'as', 'normal', 'then', 'suddenly', 'God', 'Satan', 'child', 'come', 'want', 'marry', 'something', 'did', 'past', 'fathers', 'encourage', 'battle', 'Rin', 'heart', 'not', 'too', 'amused', 'harem', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'development', 'episodes', 'given', 'girl', 'own', 'arc', ""'re"", 'not', 'being', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'have', 'equal', 'chance', 'getting', 'Rin', 'EXCEPT', 'Primula', 'body', 'little', 'girl', 'not', 'wanting', 'go', 'controversial', 'route', 'anime', 'Primula', 'kept', 'little', 'sister', 'having', 'arc', 'midway', 'season', 'girl', 'shown', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'have', 'issues', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'series', 'would', 'touch', 'on.Of', 'course', 'everyone', 'series', 'box', 'cutter', 'scene', 'lot', 'people', 'blow', 'proportion', 'try', 'put', 'anime', 'School', 'Days', 'problem', 'anime', 'girls', 'harem', 'really', 'hate', 'Kaede', 'Now', 'already', 'spoke', 'Baka', 'Test', 'review', 'have', 'strong', 'hate', 'yandere', 'characters', 'given', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'hurting', 'people', 'claim', 'love', 'lot', 'people', 'feel', 'sorry', 'what', 'Kaede', 'go', 'series', 'honestly', 'could', 'not', 'sympathize', 'Kaede', 'jealousy', 'girl', 'Rin', 'sights', 'nowhere', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'signs', 'insanity', 'when', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'around', 'so', 'flip', 'out', 'particular', 'girl', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'lashing', 'out', 'fact', 'lost', 'guy', 'loved', 'being', 'beginning', 'given', 'backstory', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'when', 'reason', 'box', 'cutter', 'scene', 'just', 'see', 'whining', 'arc', 'when', 'get', 'know', 'harsh', 'how', 'honestly', 'feel', 'Kaede', 'feel', 'arc', 'brought', 'tension', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'add', 'yandere', 'given', 'not', 'lot', 'harem', 'series', 'actually', 'have', 'yandere', 'actively', 'attack', 'competition', 'played', 'seriously', 'School', 'Days', ""n't"", 'count', 'think', 'worse', 'part', 'how', 'Rin', 'girl', 'are', 'blamed', 'craziness', 'admit', 'Rin', 'fault', 'not', 'paying', 'attention', 'mental', 'health', 'been', 'fine', 'ever', 'breakdown', 'how', 'was', 'supposed', 'know', 'would', 'crack', 'again', 'only', 'Primula', 'watched', 'happen', 'Then', 'girl', 'blamed', 'stole', 'Rin', 'away', 'Kaede', 'did', 'when', 'Rin', 'never', 'even', 'liked', 'Kaede', 'even', 'knew', 'Kaede', 'had', 'feelings', 'Rin', 'was', 'fair', 'love', 'war', 'other', 'girls', 'slowly', 'gave', 'up', 'when', 'realized', 'Rin', 'liked', 'girl', 'ranting', 'think', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'was', 'not', 'expanding', 'world', 'Shuffle', 'Shuffle', 'world', 'where', 'demons', 'Gods', 'humans', 'live', 'harmony', 'beside', 'Primula', 'Nerine', 'arc', 'share', 'Heaven/Hell', 'never', 'touched', 'upon', 'just', 'waste', 'given', 'how', 'girls', 'have', 'sort', 'magical', 'power', 'never', 'touched', 'overall', 'give', 'anime', '8/10', 'unnecessary', 'yandere', 'arc', 'admit', 'breakdown', 'English', 'dub', 'nailed', 'Kaede', 'insanity', 'perfectly', 'give', 'props', 'not', 'expanding', 'magic', 'world']",Shuffle!: The Complete Series

The series for the most part is a romantic comedy with some dramatic parts as well a little similar to the series Chobits and Ah My Goddess series.  The series does have a little nudity not full just some topless shots but if you feel that's offensive or don't want the chance of any younger kids seeing those scenes just quickly skip over those parts because all in all the series is still a good show for people to watch.  Like a lot of anime shows of this nature you have one male character(Rin) who seems to attract a group of beautiful girls who want to be his one true love and he must choose who really has his heart, and it's sometimes very funny as you watch these girls compete against each other for Rin's heart.  The series video is in wide-screen format with the usual 5.1 English audio or 2.0 English/Japanese audio,  the video quality is clear and sharp like most anime series that have come out these last ten years and the voice cast for both the Japanese and English cast were incredible for their character roles.  Though the extras aren't much just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs and that's about it,  the only complaint again is the way Funimation put the box set which if you've been buying the last few like the Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE or Mushi-Shi box sets is that the series comes in four dvds which are placed in two thin pack dvd cases which hold two dvds each and placed in a thin paper sleeve with some of the female shuffle cast on the front.  So the question is is this series worth getting at this price and for myself I say yes, though if you like more of the mecha fighting series and don't care for much else than you might want to pass this over otherwise a great series awaits you...",5,An Entertaining And Romantic Harem Series Worth Checking Out,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,1932,"['saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'website', 'HULU', 'instantly', 'knew', 'series', 'was', 'must', 'have', 'now', 'seeing', 'series', 'have', 'regrets', 'having', 'bought', 'incredible', 'series', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'similar', 'series', 'Chobits', 'Ah', 'My', 'Goddess', 'series', 'series', 'have', 'little', 'nudity', 'not', 'full', 'just', 'topless', 'shots', 'feel', 'offensive', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'chance', 'younger', 'kids', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'just', 'quickly', 'skip', 'parts', 'series', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'people', 'watch', 'lot', 'anime', 'shows', 'nature', 'have', 'one', 'male', 'character', 'Rin', 'who', 'attract', 'group', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'must', 'choose', 'who', 'really', 'heart', 'sometimes', 'very', 'funny', 'watch', 'girls', 'compete', 'other', 'Rin', 'heart', 'series', 'video', 'wide-screen', 'format', 'usual', '5.1', 'English', 'audio', '2.0', 'English/Japanese', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'clear', 'sharp', 'most', 'anime', 'series', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'English', 'cast', 'were', 'incredible', 'character', 'roles', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'only', 'complaint', 'again', 'way', 'Funimation', 'put', 'box', 'set', ""'ve"", 'been', 'buying', 'last', 'few', 'Tsubasa', 'RESERVoir', 'CHRoNiCLE', 'Mushi-Shi', 'box', 'sets', 'series', 'four', 'dvds', 'are', 'placed', 'two', 'thin', 'pack', 'dvd', 'cases', 'hold', 'two', 'dvds', 'placed', 'thin', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'female', 'shuffle', 'cast', 'front', 'question', 'series', 'getting', 'price', 'say', 'yes', 'like', 'more', 'mecha', 'fighting', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'else', 'might', 'want', 'pass', 'over', 'otherwise', 'great', 'series', 'awaits']",Shuffle!: The Complete Series

1222991,A1JEHPPJ4475HP,B001OPQIH4,W. Watson,"[2, 2]","I've watched a lot of Anime lately.  I have always liked the action/adventure type anime, but this is one of the first ones I've watched that wasn't really focused on any sort of action.  I checked it out mainly because I was tired of my daughter making me watch iCarly all the time and since we like watching TV together I set off in search of some Anime shows she might like.I'd intended to watch just one or two episodes to see if it was too violent or suggestive. She's 10, so I have to be careful what she watches. I ended up watching the whole series while I was at work over the last week or so. I'm not afraid to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I won't mind watching it again with her. I wasn't really concerned with the brief scenes of nudity in this series. It wasn't anything more than a flash here and there which I can stomach. We've watched Ranma 1/2 for a long time so I'm used to the cultural differences. I wouldn't suggest it for young children, but with supervision, I don't think there's anything too racy. They see worse just turning on the TV these days.I have to say after watching shows like this that I can see why so many people enjoy Anime. The concepts aren't dumbed down because it's a cartoon.  So many American cartoons seem to think that children aren't capable of understanding subtlety. This series does not. The characters are deeply flawed in their own respects and make mistakes. Even Rin isn't perfect. I have to agree with most--I would have liked to have seen a longer story. But honestly, I think this is a story you could return to a year later and still have material to cover.  Plus I like the idea of telling a story from start to finish and not killing the characters over changing writers and new creative directions that happens in American series TV.I really enjoyed this show, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something different from the standard faire. It was an enjoyable experience.
