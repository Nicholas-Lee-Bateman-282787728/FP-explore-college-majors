I won't explain the plot here, but be assured it is formulatic and flowed with ease out of some hollywood writers pen. What makes this movie fun is the drumming, the choreography and the small look into the life of a marching band, a subject not touched on to much. the performances were pretty strong, the music fine and fit the movie. Orlando Jones did a great job as the band leader.

601008,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLH2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 7]","Sometimes predictable can work if it's crafted right.  Predictable is all around us.  Nearly every teen movie follows the same formula and so to nit-pick as it may seem can be tedious and about as predictable as the movie itself.  But, at the end of the day, I really want more from my popcorn fluff, and `Drumline' drops the ball in a very important area.  If you are going to regurgitate the same plot that every other film in your genre attempts to immortalize, you need to back it up with some solid acting and chemistry, because lets face it; that is what will keep you coming back.  Sadly, Nick Cannon really doesn't possess either.  He has limited acting skills and his charisma comes off fake.  He tries way too hard to be so cool, and it shows.  I hate that he's likened to Will Smith because Smith exudes confidence and has bountiful amounts of charisma; it's just who he is.  Cannon has the disservice of playing a very unlikable character (I hate people who feel entitled), but he doesn't bring anything fresh to it.  Sure, Zoe Saldana is gorgeous and I love looking at her, but her presence cannot save this flop.  The final showdown is wonderfully choreographed, and so I'd watch that for sure, but outside of that the actual story is a clich&eacute; ridden mess that follows the `formula' to a T without any interpretation or originality.  On top of that fopaux, the script contains so many illogical plot points that it does itself a major disservice.  Instead of just appearing to be a lazy attempt at making some quick cash off of the apparent newfound stardom of a semi-attractive young man, `Drumline' comes off like a STUPID and lazy attempt at making some quick cash off of the apparent newfound stardom of a semi-attractive young man.

601016,A3LRFGYJVXKPDI,B00005JLH2,Bennett Turk,"[19, 22]","My review of ""Drumline"" is based on what I saw at the theater, not on home video.  First of all, the plot is pure formula, inspired by ""An Officer and A Gentleman"".  Remove that complaint, and it's a great film. The movie is highly original in that it shows, (perhaps for the first time on the screen), what it's really like to be in a marching band in college. This film does an excellent job in showing a real-life school, with real people, in a way that should not offend that many people.  There's no real gratutious sex, violence, or bad language. What it has is in keeping with it's PG-13 rating.  Nick Cannon graduates from a high school in a lower-income neighborhood in New York City.  He was raised by his mother, his father having little to do with either one of them.  He gets a musical diploma to a college in Atlanta.  He has an attitude; he's a great drummer and he knows it.  We later find out he cann't read sheet music, (he lied on his college application), but he has the ability to learn very fast by hearing alone. The fact that Nick was raised by a single parent also contributes to his bad attitude towards the world.  Nick does have some good morals, but, it takes some attitude adjustment to bring them out. Orlando Jones, the only big name in the cast, is very believable as the musical director who is stuck on out-of-date music, that while nice to listen to, is not winning the big competition with the other schools.  The college pricipal really wants a winning band, much like another pricipal would want a winning football team.  The movie shows that being on a marching band means being on time, being part of a team, constant workouts, (just as hard as the football players), and when one person makes a mistake everyone suffers. Also there are four levels in the band from the most talented down to the rookiees.  A person on a lower lever can challenge a person on a higher level to a one-on-one musical competition for their seat. The nerve-racking fact that college students, many in their teens or early twenties, have to be near perfect in front of a stadium filled with thousands of people is also shown.I doubt if what it really means to be in a band in college has ever been shown in such detail in a movie before.  For the record, I was never in a band in school, but those who were, have said what is shown on the screen  is very accurate.  ""Drumline"" does have moments when what the viewer expected to happen does occur, but, it has enough surprises to keep the film-goer engaged.  The acting, camera work, music, and location filming are all first rate.  This is more than a ""fish out of water"" film, this is a movie about real people at a real college playing in a real marching band.",4,"A  ""feel-great"" movie that everyone should enjoy!",1050969600,"04 22, 2003",2003,2731,"['review', 'Drumline', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'theater', 'not', 'home', 'video', 'First', 'all', 'plot', 'pure', 'formula', 'inspired', 'Officer', 'A', 'Gentleman', 'Remove', 'complaint', 'great', 'film', 'movie', 'highly', 'original', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'screen', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'be', 'marching', 'band', 'college', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'real-life', 'school', 'real', 'people', 'way', 'should', 'not', 'offend', 'many', 'people', 'real', 'gratutious', 'sex', 'violence', 'bad', 'language', 'What', 'keeping', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'high', 'school', 'lower-income', 'neighborhood', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'was', 'raised', 'mother', 'father', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'one', 'musical', 'diploma', 'college', 'Atlanta', 'attitude', 'great', 'drummer', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'can', ""n't"", 'read', 'sheet', 'music', 'lied', 'college', 'application', 'ability', 'learn', 'very', 'fast', 'hearing', 'alone', 'fact', 'Nick', 'was', 'raised', 'single', 'parent', 'also', 'bad', 'attitude', 'world', 'Nick', 'have', 'good', 'morals', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'bring', 'out', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'only', 'big', 'name', 'cast', 'very', 'believable', 'musical', 'director', 'who', 'stuck', 'out-of-date', 'music', 'nice', 'listen', 'not', 'winning', 'big', 'competition', 'other', 'schools', 'college', 'pricipal', 'really', 'winning', 'band', 'much', 'pricipal', 'would', 'want', 'winning', 'football', 'team', 'movie', 'being', 'marching', 'band', 'being', 'time', 'being', 'part', 'team', 'constant', 'workouts', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'football', 'players', 'when', 'one', 'person', 'mistake', 'everyone', 'suffers', 'Also', 'are', 'four', 'levels', 'band', 'most', 'talented', 'down', 'rookiees', 'person', 'lower', 'lever', 'can', 'challenge', 'person', 'higher', 'level', 'one-on-one', 'musical', 'competition', 'seat', 'nerve-racking', 'fact', 'college', 'students', 'many', 'teens', 'early', 'twenties', 'have', 'be', 'near', 'perfect', 'front', 'stadium', 'filled', 'thousands', 'people', 'also', 'shown.I', 'doubt', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'band', 'college', 'ever', 'been', 'shown', 'such', 'detail', 'movie', 'record', 'was', 'never', 'band', 'school', 'who', 'were', 'have', 'said', 'what', 'shown', 'screen', 'very', 'accurate', 'Drumline', 'have', 'moments', 'when', 'what', 'viewer', 'expected', 'happen', 'occur', 'enough', 'surprises', 'keep', 'film-goer', 'engaged', 'acting', 'camera', 'work', 'music', 'location', 'filming', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'more', 'fish', 'water', 'film', 'movie', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'college', 'playing', 'real', 'marching', 'band']",Drumline VHS

So the marching band was always a very important part of my life, even though I wasn't in the band.During the summer, when they would practice, I would go to the football field and watch them get their routines and formations together.  In the movie, where the band members have to run around the track when one person messes up, I have witnessed numerous time.During football season, the band would make a short appearance at the pep rally in the gym.  They would march in, high steppin, do a number or two, and high step on back out of the door.  The acoustics were fantastic.During Mardi Gras, to see my marching band or any other of the two major black marching bands coming down the street was pure excitement.  We would pray that they would stop in front of us and play a song.Everybody and dey mama would go to the foot games when we played against two of our rival black high schools, just to see who whupped butts on the field during half time.  We only considered each other as being real competition.  You know black folks got their own style and ways of during things. We are so unique and innovative.In saying all of this, I enjoyed this movie for all the memories it brought back of the Black Marching Bands.  Yeah, when I was in high school, the only girls who could be majorettes were the ""brick houses.""  You could not be fat or skinny.  You had to have back, a small waist, flat stomach, thick and shapely thighs and legs, and easy on the eyes.  The majorettes made the first impression, and it better be a good one.To the folks complaining about the technical aspect and such, y'all it is a movie for entertainment.  It is not a documentary.

601019,A2FS38D943KX12,B00005JLH2,chefdevergue,"[8, 20]","Good Lord, how many of these movies do we have to see?  Cocky-but-brilliant misfit spends most of his time clashing with a) unsympathetic Establishment figures (in this case, the band director & the section leader) and b) the villain from the ""rival"" band.  In his spare time, he engages in a roller-coaster romance with a woman who just ""doesn't get it,"" that he just has to express himself in his own special way, even if he has to ""break the rules.""  Ooooh, such drama, such conflict.  Of course, he ultimately is redeemed, as are all misunderstood individualistic, rule-breakin' heroes.  Blah blah blah blah blah.  One can see this ending coming from a mile away.  This tortuous storyline is broken up by seemingly endless band sequences, some that are not bad, others that really aren't as spiffy as some viewers may think.  Someone watching this on a DVD may be tempted to skip large numbers of scenes to get to the ending that all of us already know.Just a note on the believability of the whole ""dude can't read music, but is such a genius that he can fake his way through anyway"" premise which is one of the building blocks of the movie:  while I am not a percussionist, I am nonetheless a musician with 30 years professional experience, and I have NEVER had an audition for an ensemble where sight-reading was not involved.

Is it any wonder percussion sections are often comprised of flamboyant, overly-confident, enthusiastic showboaters?  And there's nothing wrong with that:  after all, these guys have to strut their stuff, entertain the crowd, and hold the band together--all at the same time.The movie DRUMLINE pays homage to the determined percussionists who entertain college football crowds on Saturday afternoons.  The story itself is formulaic and predictable:  young Devon (Nick Cannon), a snare drummer with buckets of talent but a serious attitude, is constantly on the outs with his no-nonsense band director, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones, forever known to me as the 7UP dude).  But the story is enhanced by the fascinating trials and tribulations of the (fictitious) Atlanta A&amp;T marching band as it progresses through a long football season.  The viewer is privy to the band's countless practices, personality clashes, section challenges, and performances.  But the performances make this movie so entertaining; director Charles Stone III and his crew really knew their stuff, as DRUMLINE vividly portrays the gritty and glittery realism of a big-time college marching band.I even get a nice little workout while I watch this film--especially when Atlanta A&amp;T's percussion section must meet a challenging drumline in a &quot;face-off&quot; to determine the winner of a national marching band contest.  The drum cadences, the pounding and clashing rhythms, are so clean, crisp, and compelling that I find myself first bobbing my head to the beat, then swaying and strutting to the delightful sounds.  Finally, I'm slapping my beer belly in unison with the cadence (and I keep up pretty well, if I do say so myself).  The workout provides a fresh burst of energy, and so does DRUMLINE.--D.

Devon's ego about being the best causes problems between him, Sean, and their coach, Dr. Lee. Eventually, Dr. Lee goes back and forth about firing Devon and letting him back on the team.

601038,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,B00005JLH2,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""","[1, 1]","This fictionalized account of what life is like to have ""the black marching band experience,"" brings back so many memories, that each year before the super bowl, I drag it out and watch as if it were a family religious rite. Why do I do this?Because, although the movie conflates the marching band and college fraternity experiences -- obviously in a crude attempt to enrich the former -- that conflation was totally unnecessary. For, of all the experiences that a young struggling black student could have, it would be difficult to beat that of becoming a member of a marching band. To wit: learning how to master a musical instrument; how to read and appreciate music of all varieties; gaining self-confidence through this mastery; and most important of all learning how to excel at a craft whose only predicate is not just ""making money.""As well, there is the constructive collaboration with fellow students, other schools, professional artists, etc. that the movie brings out beautifully. There is also the intense competition and rivalries, which although they also have many positive aspects, can and often do get out of hand. There is the close interaction between students and their band directors, who, more often than not, are proficient in music and on several musical instruments themselves. And thus more often than not, band directors serve as more than just overseers and administrators of the students they teach. They are more like mentors, with the students being their apprentices.But this is not all: The movie did not depict what happens to those who find success in those bands. Not only do most of them go one to become well-adjusted, socially successful productive citizens, but also successes professionally. In fact one of the best kept secrets in the black social realm is that it is the black college band that is the ""feeder system"" for most of the black professional musicians, including Jazz musicians and concert and symphony orchestra musicians. And as strange as it may seem, it is the black college band that is also in large measure responsible for black professionals in other areas such as law, medicine, and even engineering.Why is this so? I think it is mainly true for two reasons. First there are so few opportunities for black kids to get on a secure track that can lead to consistent self-development. The band, like sports is one such alternative track. And second because of the Darwinian process involved in both sports and music: only the strong can survive the rigorous schedules involved in balancing normal studies with the discipline involved in mastering a horn or sports at the same time. Everything about the black band experience as it turns out is profound and sound preparation for life. When you complete your tenure in a band, you are master of at least one important thing in life: your instrument.Which brings me to my final point about the movie. When I saw this year's Fourth of July parade, in which the DC black high schools were represented by overweight baton twirlers accompanied by a ragtag drum corps, it took my breath away and left a knot in my stomach. I was not ready for this surprise. For in that instant, viewing these faux black bands, I saw the arc of a whole generation of black failures marching in lock step into a dark American future.By not supporting inner city music programs, while hiring an expensive Superintendent, Michelle Rhee, to further cut the budgets, under the pretext of making the schools better, DC had made its choice: ""To hell with enriching the lives of inner city kids, we are trying to save the taxpayer money at all cost?

She is a percussionist and at that time, wasn't interested in marching band at the high school level, but we wanted to see the movie due to her interest in drumming.  Since that time, she has gotten into marching band and an indoor drumline at her high school and the indoor drumline she participates in came in 14th at national competition last month (proud mom here).The first time I saw the movie, it really seemed over the top to me and while I enjoyed it, it seemed unrealistic in many ways.  This is a feel-good movie with a talented but arrogant under-priviledged kid getting the opportunity of a lifetime and showing how he responds.  I am always a sucker for this type of film.  The second time I watched this just this past weekend, I enjoyed it even more.  After going through a high school marching band season and an indoor drumline season, this all seemed perfectly normal.  The number of hours, the discipline, the hardwork these kids put into this are very accurately portrayed based upon my own experience.To sum it up -- a fun, entertaining movie that anyone who has participated in marching band (and drummers in particular) will enjoy.

601041,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JLH2,Jason,"[0, 0]","Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a drum prodigy, a talent so profound he managed to receive a drum scholarship to Atlanta A&T;, a school with a powerful band led by Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), a band director who believes in the structure and beauty of old-school music.  In other words, Dr. Lee takes music seriously.  Too bad Devon doesn't.Unfortunately, Devon is anything but a team-player, butting heads with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), Section Leader of the Drumline.  Despite his unquestionable musical ability, it doesn't take long to learn that Devon is a rebellious malcontent, an arrogant show-off, and an individual amongst the team concept.  On top of that, he's a fraud and a liar - something clear because of the fact that a term of his scholarship offer was the ability to read music, something Devon can't do.  In general, his hindrance to the band exceeds his abilities, and he is rightfully put on suspension from the band's activities.  To be quite honest, I'm not sure why anyone would befriend Devon, let alone someone from the band he's so clearly trying to sabotage.Eventually Dr. Lee gets soft, and succumbs to the pressures of competition during the final showdown at the BET Championship against Morehouse Marching Band.  He lets Devon back on the band, thereby contradicting his own word and making a mockery of discipline.  The movie culminates in an amazing musical display that relies heavily on great epic music and beats, but also showmanship and a one-ups-manship similar to ""You Got Served"".  In the final battle, it's A&T; versus Morehouse, a team known for slick, new sounds based upon today's top R&B; and hip hop hits.I'm sure nobody would disagree with the notion that the true star of this movie is the music.  The underlying, predictable romance is pointless, and the entire performance by Cannon is forgettable.  This movie would have been better served if it were cut in half and just used as a showcase for the incredible bands.  From the tubas to the trumpets, and of course the dynamic drumline, the music is really the only real reason to watch this otherwise tiresome, banal waste of time.",3,Awesome beats.  Great music.

He's part of a band in a Harlem high school and is so good at what he does that he gets a full scholarship to a Atlanta A&amp;T, a black university in the South.  The school is fictional but the band politics are not and he is soon goes though his own coming-of-age experience as he learns about competition and teamwork and growing up. In this school the band is everything, and when he and an slightly older classmate, played by Leonard Roberts, lock horns, there is conflict.

601054,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JLH2,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 4]","I had always mistakenly assumed that college marching bands were much like high school marching bands. In other words, in college you marched because you had to, not because you wanted to. I also thought that the big deal about marching was learning the moves, and that playing was something the band members already knew how to do. This movie corrected me with respect to both these points and many more. I came to realize that for some bands there are competitions as serious as those between sports teams, though I should point out that to the best of my knowledge there is no BET Southern Classic.Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is an incredibly good drummer on a scholarship to fictional Atlanta A&T; University. As fast as someone can play a piece Devon not only picks it up, he plays it. However, Devon has the problem of youth; he is cocky and self-centered and frequently outruns the ability of the band to keep up. His actions do little to put him in good stead with the old-school leader of the band, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), and the senior section leader of the drumline, Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts).The plot throws some additional spice into the story. Dr. Lee's job is on the line because his band is so old school that Dr. Lee's band is playing ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" to a yawning crowd while the opposing band plays hip-hop with sexily-dressed coeds swinging in time to the crowd's pleasure. Devon and Sean Taylor have their own little spats partially because Devon is very good and partially because of Devon's lack of discipline. Of course there is the obligatory love interest for Devon, Laila (Zoe Saldana), who cares for Devon very much, but is exasperated at his (ever hear this before?) lack of discipline and immaturity. Devon also has a secret, which I leave for the viewer to discover.While I was bored from time to time as the movie progressed, the payoff is the scenes involving the bands, particularly the final scenes in the movie. While the ending is somewhat clich&eacute;, I remained glued to the television screen for every single minute, with only an occasional pause to review a particular detail. Sure, the acting is a bit weak. Sure, the movie uses a rehashed plot. But, as the credits rolled and the ending arrived I knew I was going to watch this movie again.",3,Play with the Band,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2298,"['had', 'always', 'mistakenly', 'assumed', 'college', 'marching', 'bands', 'were', 'much', 'like', 'high', 'school', 'marching', 'bands', 'other', 'words', 'college', 'marched', 'had', 'not', 'wanted', 'also', 'thought', 'big', 'deal', 'marching', 'was', 'learning', 'moves', 'playing', 'was', 'something', 'band', 'members', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'do', 'movie', 'corrected', 'respect', 'points', 'many', 'more', 'came', 'realize', 'bands', 'are', 'competitions', 'as', 'serious', 'sports', 'teams', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'best', 'knowledge', 'BET', 'Southern', 'Classic.Devon', 'Miles', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'incredibly', 'good', 'drummer', 'scholarship', 'fictional', 'Atlanta', 'A', 'T', 'University', 'As', 'fast', 'someone', 'can', 'play', 'piece', 'Devon', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'However', 'Devon', 'problem', 'youth', 'cocky', 'self-centered', 'frequently', 'ability', 'band', 'keep', 'up', 'actions', 'do', 'little', 'put', 'good', 'stead', 'old-school', 'leader', 'band', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'senior', 'section', 'leader', 'drumline', 'Sean', 'Taylor', 'Leonard', 'Roberts', '.The', 'plot', 'additional', 'spice', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'job', 'line', 'band', 'so', 'old', 'school', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'band', 'playing', 'Flight', 'Bumblebee', 'yawning', 'crowd', 'opposing', 'band', 'hip-hop', 'sexily-dressed', 'coeds', 'swinging', 'time', 'crowd', 'pleasure', 'Devon', 'Sean', 'Taylor', 'have', 'own', 'little', 'spats', 'partially', 'Devon', 'very', 'good', 'partially', 'Devon', 'lack', 'discipline', 'course', 'obligatory', 'love', 'interest', 'Devon', 'Laila', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'who', 'Devon', 'very', 'much', 'exasperated', 'ever', 'hear', 'lack', 'discipline', 'immaturity', 'Devon', 'also', 'secret', 'leave', 'viewer', 'discover.While', 'was', 'bored', 'time', 'time', 'movie', 'progressed', 'payoff', 'scenes', 'involving', 'bands', 'particularly', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'remained', 'glued', 'television', 'screen', 'single', 'minute', 'only', 'occasional', 'pause', 'review', 'particular', 'detail', 'Sure', 'acting', 'bit', 'weak', 'Sure', 'movie', 'rehashed', 'plot', 'credits', 'rolled', 'ending', 'arrived', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'again']",Drumline VHS

Dr. Lee's (Orlando Jones) insistance on ""One Band, One Sound"" and his passion for musicianship will endear musician and watcher alike.On that same note, Orlando Jones' performance in this movie is outstanding and uncharacteristic of his usual roles.

I don't know if I would have thought that the plot would adapt well to a story about elite college marching bands, but it does.Since that plot must follow certain lines there is little that is surprising, so the success of such a film depends on the performances and ""little things"".  Drumline gets ""the little things"" right.Nick Cannon plays our hero, a snare drummer so talented that he is recruited from his NYC High School on a scholarship to play at fictional Atlanta A&T.;  (Of note: many REAL college marching bands are represented and, as Roger Ebert noted in his review, the famous Morehouse Marching Band figures prominently and was a good sport to allow their leader to serve as the ""bad guy"" in the story.) Devon Miles is proud and hard-headed, and doesn't tell the bandleader that he plays from memory because he can't read music - obviously a shortcoming in a band member.  But he is also a spectacular drummer, and in one of the brilliant early scenes he tracks his uninvolved father down to tell him that he is graduating from high school, going to college, is not on drugs and doesn't have any illegitimate kids running around.There is the expected ""love interest"".  There is the realistic mentoring, courtesy of Orlando Jones as Dr. Lee, the bandmaster.  There is the tense rivalry between hot upstart freshman Devon and Leonard Roberts as Sean Taylor, the Senior Section Leader of the Drumline.

601060,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005JLH2,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","If you were fortunate enough to see the film DRUMLINE when it played in theaters you got to witness a telling coming of age story with a dynamic musical touch on a huge screen, complete with tricked out stereo no doubt. If you didn't, then take advantage of the recent blu-ray release of the title along with a wide screen HD television.For those who aren't aware of the story we have Nick Cannon as Devin Myles, a young high school graduate and a showboat with dreams of playing drums in a college marching band. He gets the chance when he the director of a band at a southern college, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones) recruits him to help kick their drum line up a notch. Having come in second place for some time, Dr. Lee needs a win to retain his job.Devon shows to school with enough arrogance to fill the field. He has yet to learn the basics of earning your place and feels he deserves it. Conflicts with his section leader, Sean (Leonard Roberts) present a ton of tension for the better part of the film. But as in most movie stories, it ends in a mutual respect.Along the way to the final showdown, the BET Nationals, Devon finds time to have a romance as well as develop into a man. He is revealed to having a problem reading music that is solved. And he learns that respect is earned and not presented on a silver platter.Sound simple? Actually it is. The underdog, rising to the challenge is a standard in movies and has been for years. What makes this one stand out among the rest are two things: the engaging performances by all involved and the thrill of the competition that ends with a drum off between the two rival bands.One of the nicest things to see here is black actors playing something other than criminals, hip hop stars or drug pushers. Instead we see the characters as real people and not stereotypes. With the exception that the film takes place at a mostly black college, the roles could have been played by any race. First and foremost we have a story here to tell.Cannon shines as the smart aleck upstart who thinks the world revolves around him. His Devon smiles and preens but when revealed that he has problems sulks until he gets the chance to improve. Roberts as his first foe and later friend provides enough of a big brother attitude to try and whip him into shape that the character is believable. Outstanding is Jones, an actor who deserves more parts than he seems to get, as the director who wants his students to realize that there is history in the music he chooses rather than simply victory over the other college.The competition is an amazing thing to watch, even more so if you've ever been in marching band or taken an interest in it. The precision and skills observed make this a moment to enjoy for all. Want to know who wins? Then watch the movie.So what makes this movie so special that it deserves blu-ray status? The sights and sounds of the bands and the competition. This movie is a visual and auditory treat for anyone possessing a large TV and surround sound system. The colors of everything from the field to the uniforms nearly pop off of the screen and attack the eyes. The sound places you in the center of the field, in the midst of the competition listening to the steady beat of the drum line. Short of a 3-D experience, you are there.The final drum battle between the two bands brings all of these items into clear cut focus for the enjoyment of the viewer. The flash of the cymbals and drummers, the rhythmic bear that spurs them on, the desire to win above all else fills you with emotion as you wait for the final verdict.This movie deserved the blu-ray treatment. Perhaps it will give people a chance to find it for the first time. I know it will give those who enjoyed it the first time around a reason to cheer.",5,THE BEAT GOES ON,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,3776,"['were', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'see', 'film', 'DRUMLINE', 'when', 'played', 'theaters', 'got', 'witness', 'telling', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'dynamic', 'musical', 'touch', 'huge', 'screen', 'complete', 'tricked', 'out', 'stereo', 'doubt', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'take', 'advantage', 'recent', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'title', 'wide', 'screen', 'HD', 'television.For', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'story', 'have', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'Devin', 'Myles', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'showboat', 'dreams', 'playing', 'drums', 'college', 'marching', 'band', 'chance', 'when', 'director', 'band', 'southern', 'college', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'help', 'kick', 'drum', 'line', 'notch', 'Having', 'come', 'second', 'place', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'win', 'retain', 'job.Devon', 'school', 'enough', 'arrogance', 'fill', 'field', 'yet', 'learn', 'basics', 'earning', 'place', 'feels', 'section', 'leader', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Roberts', 'present', 'ton', 'tension', 'better', 'part', 'film', 'most', 'movie', 'stories', 'mutual', 'respect.Along', 'way', 'final', 'showdown', 'BET', 'Nationals', 'Devon', 'time', 'have', 'romance', 'as', 'well', 'develop', 'man', 'revealed', 'having', 'problem', 'reading', 'music', 'solved', 'respect', 'earned', 'not', 'presented', 'silver', 'platter.Sound', 'simple', 'Actually', 'underdog', 'rising', 'challenge', 'standard', 'movies', 'been', 'years', 'What', 'one', 'stand', 'rest', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'engaging', 'performances', 'involved', 'thrill', 'competition', 'drum', 'off', 'two', 'rival', 'bands.One', 'nicest', 'things', 'see', 'here', 'black', 'actors', 'playing', 'something', 'other', 'criminals', 'hip', 'hop', 'drug', 'pushers', 'Instead', 'see', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'stereotypes', 'exception', 'film', 'place', 'mostly', 'black', 'college', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'race', 'First', 'foremost', 'have', 'story', 'here', 'tell.Cannon', 'shines', 'smart', 'aleck', 'upstart', 'who', 'world', 'Devon', 'smiles', 'preens', 'when', 'revealed', 'problems', 'sulks', 'chance', 'improve', 'Roberts', 'first', 'foe', 'later', 'friend', 'enough', 'big', 'brother', 'attitude', 'try', 'whip', 'shape', 'character', 'believable', 'Outstanding', 'Jones', 'actor', 'who', 'more', 'parts', 'get', 'director', 'who', 'students', 'realize', 'history', 'music', 'rather', 'simply', 'victory', 'other', 'college.The', 'competition', 'amazing', 'thing', 'watch', 'even', 'more', 'so', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'marching', 'band', 'taken', 'interest', 'precision', 'skills', 'observed', 'make', 'moment', 'enjoy', 'Want', 'know', 'who', 'Then', 'watch', 'movie.So', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'blu-ray', 'status', 'sights', 'sounds', 'bands', 'competition', 'movie', 'visual', 'auditory', 'treat', 'anyone', 'possessing', 'large', 'TV', 'surround', 'sound', 'system', 'colors', 'everything', 'field', 'uniforms', 'nearly', 'pop', 'screen', 'attack', 'eyes', 'sound', 'center', 'field', 'midst', 'competition', 'listening', 'steady', 'beat', 'drum', 'line', 'Short', '3-D', 'experience', 'are', 'there.The', 'final', 'drum', 'battle', 'two', 'bands', 'items', 'clear', 'cut', 'focus', 'enjoyment', 'viewer', 'flash', 'cymbals', 'drummers', 'rhythmic', 'bear', 'desire', 'win', 'else', 'emotion', 'wait', 'final', 'verdict.This', 'movie', 'deserved', 'blu-ray', 'treatment', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'give', 'people', 'chance', 'find', 'first', 'time', 'know', 'will', 'give', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'time', 'reason', 'cheer']",Drumline VHS

Nick Cannon plays a gifted drummer from the inner city who gets a full scholarship to Atlanta T&T;, a predominantly black college which has a long history of having an exceptional marching band.Most of the characters are black. A few well placed faces are white. The story, of gifted ambition fighting against the system, is universal. Nick's love interest is Zoe Saldana, a lovely cheerleader (whom I had seen in Center Stage and Crossroads). Orlando Jones (Evolution, The Time Machine) plays an overly conservative band director who is challenged to bring more excitement to defeat longtime rival, Morris Brown College, at the upcoming band competition classic.Nick wears his motor-board and graduates from high school. There's a touching scene where he goes to see his father, who works as a ticket taker - and ""thanks"" him for not being there when he needed him. In college, Nick's rebellious nature gets him into trouble and eventually kicked off of the band. He makes a triumphant return - and everyone lives happily ever after (but, of course).Along the way, however, we are treated to the most exciting display of marching band prowess - and drum line percussion riffs - I've ever enjoyed anywhere! Take it from me, you'll never in a million years view such an exhibition on Saturday afternoon NCAA football!The finale is spectacular. On the field, you'd be life-challenged to see black cheerleader mid-driffs more sensual; or black drum beats so inspirational. The bands duel, and tie; and the drum lines face-off for the conclusion. Not a word was spoken, but I've never experienced anything so dramatic; and I literally ended the film with my heart pounding in my chest, and tears streaming down my cheeks.There's a touching moment in the deleted scenes where Nick goes to thank his father - who turned out to offer him a key piece of inspiration in the film.Drumline is viscerally and emotionally powerful; and it is easily one of the best movies I've seen all year (black or otherwise).

A shame but the beauty of DVD is that you can pick up what you missed.This is a fun little film with the old story of the kid with great musical talent who has nothing; get's his big break with a full scholarship to a university.Miles shows up expecting to be treated like royalty but ends up becoming the  problem of the band.Extremely talented drummer with a bad attitude challenges and shows up the line leader.  Who later learns Miles can't read music.It turns out that he lied to the music director and on his application.  Rather then take his way out and study he gets an even bigger attitude which leads to him ""showboating"" during a band competition which ends in a fight between the two bands.  He of course gets booted.Things look bad as the band directory faces a firing for refusing to adopt to the new music of today.  The drum line leader forgets he used to love the sound of the line more then his playing and Miles faces loosing his scholarship and his girlfriend.A box arrives and it contains music from his estranged father to which Miles is surprised to music of his father.  It gets him thinking and he goes to the drum line leader to get some help on an idea.  They have a drum off and the line leader remembers his job and accepts the fact Miles is a better drummer but he points out to Miles that even though he is the best; the crowd can't hear him because they hear the band playing.  He also works with Miles to help him learn to read Music.They collaborate and present their Music to the band director who thinks it's a great idea.The final showdown happens at the big competition to which there is a tie that must be settled with the drum lines.  Miles gets his chance and this time he does not showboat.Overall it's a nice film if you like the music.  The side stories are ok and they don't distract.  However, I would have liked to have seen something with the father where Miles sends him music.  Just seemed the right thing to do for me.There are extras and some music videos but they are are watch once and move on.",5,I liked it.,1203811200,"02 24, 2008",2008,2126,"['was', 'film', 'missed', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'fact', 'shame', 'beauty', 'DVD', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'what', 'missed.This', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'old', 'story', 'kid', 'great', 'musical', 'talent', 'who', 'nothing', 'get', 'big', 'break', 'full', 'scholarship', 'university.Miles', 'up', 'expecting', 'be', 'treated', 'royalty', 'up', 'becoming', 'problem', 'band.Extremely', 'talented', 'drummer', 'bad', 'attitude', 'challenges', 'up', 'line', 'leader', 'Who', 'later', 'Miles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'music.It', 'out', 'lied', 'music', 'director', 'application', 'then', 'take', 'way', 'study', 'even', 'bigger', 'attitude', 'showboating', 'band', 'competition', 'fight', 'two', 'bands', 'course', 'booted.Things', 'look', 'bad', 'band', 'directory', 'firing', 'refusing', 'adopt', 'new', 'music', 'today', 'drum', 'line', 'leader', 'forgets', 'used', 'love', 'sound', 'line', 'more', 'then', 'playing', 'Miles', 'loosing', 'scholarship', 'girlfriend.A', 'box', 'music', 'estranged', 'father', 'Miles', 'surprised', 'music', 'father', 'thinking', 'drum', 'line', 'leader', 'get', 'help', 'idea', 'have', 'drum', 'line', 'leader', 'remembers', 'job', 'fact', 'Miles', 'better', 'drummer', 'out', 'Miles', 'even', 'best', 'crowd', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'hear', 'band', 'playing', 'also', 'Miles', 'help', 'learn', 'read', 'Music.They', 'collaborate', 'present', 'Music', 'band', 'director', 'who', 'great', 'idea.The', 'final', 'showdown', 'happens', 'big', 'competition', 'tie', 'must', 'be', 'settled', 'drum', 'lines', 'Miles', 'chance', 'time', 'not', 'showboat.Overall', 'nice', 'film', 'like', 'music', 'side', 'stories', 'are', 'ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'However', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'father', 'where', 'Miles', 'music', 'Just', 'seemed', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'me.There', 'are', 'extras', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'are', 'watch', 'once', 'move']",Drumline VHS
601064,A3OUKV8KBGUPS4,B00005JLH2,M. Casarino,"[7, 7]","&quot;Drumline&quot; is a sterling example of a movie that works because it follows a winning formula while avoiding cliche. So many movies force their characters to march through the elements of the formula, treating them as nothing more than pawns. But &quot;Drumline&quot; gives us characters with ideas, souls, and intelligence, so that they drive the plot, rather than let the plot drive them. And it even offers a few surprises.Devon (well-played by Nick Cannon) is our hero, and even though he grew up poor in Harlem, he's proud that he lives clean, has fathered no children, and earned his full scholarship to college. He's cocky, but with good reason, as he's the best drummer in school - and he plans to be the best drummer in college, as well.The college scenes, incidentally, are a band geek's dream. We see how band camp is run as sort of a Basic Training Lite, and how there's a hierarchy that has to be followed. But then the movie does an interesting thing - it gives the characters in Devon's life dimensions. Sean, Devon's section leader, isn't a villain but a kid given a tough job who makes bad choices while trying to do the right thing. And the band director, Dr. Lee, is immediately set up as a no-nonsense, pro-education hero - but toward the middle of the movie, we suspect that his point of view might not be the only acceptable one.The formula presses on, and while the film inevitably builds to a big (and kind of awesome) showdown between rival drumlines, there are nifty surprises along the way. It's inevitable that Devon's antics get him suspended from the band, but watch how they happen, and how they defy expectations. And watch how Dr. Lee has to make some difficult decisions and be true to himself, even as he defines what that truth is.There's a reason why we like movies about cocky underdogs with talent. &quot;Drumline&quot; knows this and exploites it to the hilt - and sure enough, we end up with big, goofy smiles on our faces and hearts. And along the way we get to see some great marching bands and a lot of genuine comedy - who can ask for more than that?",5,Hear the Drummer get Wicked!,1085097600,"05 21, 2004",2004,2103,"['quot', 'Drumline', 'quot', 'sterling', 'example', 'movie', 'winning', 'formula', 'avoiding', 'cliche', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'force', 'characters', 'march', 'elements', 'formula', 'treating', 'nothing', 'more', 'pawns', 'quot', 'Drumline', 'quot', 'characters', 'ideas', 'souls', 'intelligence', 'drive', 'plot', 'rather', 'let', 'plot', 'drive', 'even', 'few', 'surprises.Devon', 'well-played', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'hero', 'even', 'grew', 'up', 'poor', 'Harlem', 'proud', 'clean', 'fathered', 'children', 'earned', 'full', 'scholarship', 'college', 'cocky', 'good', 'reason', 'best', 'drummer', 'school', 'be', 'best', 'drummer', 'college', 'well.The', 'college', 'scenes', 'incidentally', 'are', 'band', 'geek', 'dream', 'see', 'how', 'band', 'camp', 'run', 'sort', 'Basic', 'Training', 'Lite', 'how', 'hierarchy', 'be', 'followed', 'then', 'movie', 'interesting', 'thing', 'characters', 'Devon', 'life', 'dimensions', 'Sean', 'Devon', 'section', 'leader', ""n't"", 'villain', 'kid', 'given', 'tough', 'job', 'who', 'bad', 'choices', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'band', 'director', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'immediately', 'set', 'up', 'no-nonsense', 'pro-education', 'hero', 'middle', 'movie', 'suspect', 'point', 'view', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'acceptable', 'one.The', 'formula', 'presses', 'film', 'inevitably', 'big', 'kind', 'awesome', 'showdown', 'rival', 'drumlines', 'are', 'nifty', 'surprises', 'way', 'inevitable', 'Devon', 'antics', 'get', 'suspended', 'band', 'watch', 'how', 'happen', 'how', 'defy', 'expectations', 'watch', 'how', 'Dr.', 'Lee', 'make', 'difficult', 'decisions', 'be', 'true', 'even', 'what', 'truth', 'reason', 'why', 'movies', 'cocky', 'underdogs', 'talent', 'quot', 'Drumline', 'quot', 'hilt', 'sure', 'enough', 'end', 'up', 'big', 'goofy', 'smiles', 'hearts', 'way', 'get', 'see', 'great', 'marching', 'bands', 'lot', 'genuine', 'comedy', 'who', 'can', 'ask', 'more']",Drumline VHS

I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline and acting in this movie are painfully bad. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words.  The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melo dramatic.  I know we can expect movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at one university, drop out and transfer to another university, and then return to the first university... all in one semester was absurd.  Have the writers of this movie ever attended college?  Have they ever MET anyone who has?I am no expert on drumlines so I cannot judge the authenticity of the musical sequences.  I enjoyed them.  I would have enjoyed the musical sequences more if they did not include a ludicrous number of close ups of the dance squads that accompany the bands performances.  Their ridiculously tight, not to mention sparse costumes coupled with them writhing on the field left me with the impression that the dance squads in this movie looked more like they should have been pole dancing in a cheap strip dive, rather than performing as part of a marching band.I would not reccommend purchasing this movie.  It is not worth the money.  If you feel you must see it, I would rent it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances.  The performance that's played with the closing credits is entertaining as well.

The old story has a new setting this time though, in the world of competitive college marching bands, which makes it reasonably entertaining. The movie's biggest obstacle is that the main character isn't the least bit likable.  I hope that actor Nick Cannon's better work is ahead of him because in this movie he just does a lot of pouting and not much acting.

But it still succeeds, by the subtle and utterly believable performance given by Orlando Jones as a band teacher trying to stick to his principals and by shining a light on the no-nosense world of upper-level band programs.  Even in high school, it wouldn't be that absurd to think that the band works harder and trains more intensely than the athletes that they are there to support.  It is expected that you have every little detail down, every note crisply played, and every move memorized.  Into this world comes a cocky street drummer named Devon Miles (Nick Cannon in an auspicious screen debut) who thinks he can waltz through the band program.  However, that makes him butt heads with his line captain Sean (Leonard Roberts), which leads to dismay for their teacher, Dr. Lee (Jones).  Even through that turmoil, Miles still manages to pick up a girl, an uppercassman named Laila (Zoe Saldana) and prepare for a showdown with a rival band school in the movie's flashy and exuberant finale.Director Charles Stone lll is as auspicious as Cannon in his directorial debut.  He pays enough attention to character to help the film move along, but his real strength lies in his staging of the energetic marching routines pulled off by dozens of actors and extras carrying various instruments and wearing colorful uniforms.  They are an absolute delight to watch, and Stone makes it all look easy.  And even Cannon and Roberts get in the act with their snare drums, showing off snappy solos and amazing routines.Is the movie formulaic, and done before?  Probably so.  But it still succeeds  by paying enough attention to character and definitly by staging those marching routines.

Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a Harlem teenager who receives a full scholarship to attend Atlanta A&T; University based on his excellent percussion talents. However, making the transition from hip-hop street drumming to the drumline of the school`s legendary marching band is more challenging than Miles expected. For one, the band director, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), is determined to reclaim the national championship using old-school tactics, even though his traditional beliefs appear to be leaving A&T; in the dust. And then there is Sean (Leonard Roberts), the current drum leader, who is threatened by Devon`s skills and frustrated by his fierce individuality. These  forces, as well as the addition of a cheerleading love interest (Zoe Saldana), combine to test Devon`s previously unshakeable confidence. As the season builds toward the BET Big Southern Classic and a showdown with rival Morris Brown University, Devon must swallow his pride and learn to be a team player if he wants his band to win the championship.

Also the movie focuses mostly on the drummers themselves while the rest of the band kind of takes a back seat. While being in a band like this does require serious commitment and hard work to pull these types of field shows off, it's not exactly as ""boot camp"" like as the movie tries to portray. Although i'm just speaking from personal experience with my school. Also, it may be difficult for someone who is more used to the corps style of marching to understand what's going on with band like this, but just open yourself up to learn something new and you may enjoy it. As for the movie itself, it's nothing to write home about. The best reason to watch this movie is just to see the performances of some of these bands.

It is an entertaining look at a part of black culture rarely seen in film or television, black college marching bands.  The main character is Devon Miles (Nick Cannon), a snare drummer from New York City attending fictional Atlanta A&T; on a band scholarship.  Devon is extremely talented but his cocky arrogant attitude and defiance to authority immediately causes conflict with his prideful section leader Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts) and straitlaced band director Dr. James Lee (Orlando Jones).  On top of that, it's later revealed that he can't read music and that he lied on his application about it.Dr Lee reluctantly puts up with Devon and his bad attitude because his job is on the line due to his insistence on playing old school music only (playing ""Flight Of The Bumblebee"" while his own band is jamming to the opposition's music) until Devon goes too far.  Devon later realizes that no matter how talented he is, he can never be bigger than the band.  Sean gets over his jealousy for the good of the band and helps Devon earn his way back into favor with Dr Lee and Dr Lee himself relaxes his standards without compromising himself.  Along the way, Devon forges a relationship with a beautiful drill team member (Zoe Saldana).  Seen it all before?  Some may have, some may not have but never like this!  It's a thrill ride from the first day of training all the way to the big showdown near the end!  Credit should also be given to the Morris Brown Marching Wolverines, a very respected band in real-life, for allowing themselves to be portrayed as the antagonists (not to mention having the guts to have J. Anthony Brown portray their band director).Don't listen to the overly technical critics of this film.  They really need to lighten up and get a life.  I hardly think that anyone really cares about the tips of Nick Cannon's drumsticks among the other nitpicky things people have commented on.  Drumline's main purpose was to entertain and to give further exposure to an unexplored part of black culture and I hardly think a better job could have been done doing it!

Those of us that fit the bill can relate to the events portrayed here: the stern taskmasters, the long hours of practice, the rivalry between band members and the visiting bands, the majorettes/dance line shaking to the sounds, the alumni expecting to get their monies worth, the intricacies of the halftime performance, and the blossoming romance between some band mates.All of these and more are captured in this entertaining chronicle of band life. While popular Nick Cannon is the star, the best performance goes to Orlando Jones as &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;. The actor is quite effective as the disciplined and dedicated-to-his-craft band director, allowing nothing else to stand in the way of his band producing skilled performances. Previously known primarily for his comic work, Jones gets to really stretch his acting chops here.Hopefully, Hollywood will offer more dramatic work to the actor and he may join the ranks of those performers that alternate between genres.It is also refreshing to find radio personality Jay Anthony Brown helming the role of Jones' rival, the fictional director of Atlanta's Morris Brown College.

Eventually, though, he finds out that if he doesn't use his brain, and check his attitude at the door, he won't really get anywhere, and probably will be kicked out of this university.  Of course, he has to deal with all this while trying to fit into the musical program's militaristic-like band culture & keep a burgeoning relationship with a brainy, hot woman (who, for some reason, puts up with his ""game"") going strong.

There's a lot of extraneous stuff going on in Drumline, and the movie would have benefitted from a far sterner hand in the editing department. The trite, predictable romance and the rebelling-against-authority could have been dispensed with completely, and then we would have been left with the drums.The drums are, of course, the reason to watch Drumline. Band camp as boot camp. Endless practicing. The heat of competition and the struggle to outwit the Smiths, the Joneses, and all other comers. Band not just as an after-school activity, but as an obsession.Would the viewership of the film have been smaller without the silly subplots? It might have been, and the movie might not have gotten the kind of distribution it did if it could be billed as a love story. Ultimately, though, it would have been a better movie.

If anything, they were alternate versions of many of the scenes already included.I saw this purchase as a guilty pleasure, impulse buy when I went to the store.  Glad I bought it.The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and the transfer blew me away, especially early on, with some fantastic directionality from the discreet channels.  There are a couple of scenes where the audio is DEMO worthy.  Great props to the sound editors.The video transfer is free from artifacting, aliasing or any stair stepping which would have shown itself most in the stadium scenes filled with students and other personnel.  Colors popped as they should have with eye catching uniforms and field movements.  The yellow of Mr. Lee's suit and the blue of his opponents suit were almost cartoonish with such deeply saturated colors from the transfer.

Devon has a great deal of talent but his self-centeredness causes him to lose sight of the goal of the band (""One Band! One Sound!"") and to clash with his section leader, Sean aka Big Brother ""Iron Man"" (well played by Leonard Roberts), who disapproves of Devon's attitude and resents Devon's natural talent.  Sean finally gets through to Devon about his attitude (""So go on at be the man - without the line.  You're the best, Devon, but when you're on the field, nobody hears you.  They hear the band, one band."") and together they help put together a routine that helps win the big marching band tournament.  The main side plot involves the band director's clash with the university president.  The director Dr. Lee (fine performance by Orlando Jones) places a great deal of importance on musicianship but sometimes loses sight that music is about entertainment as well.  In the end, Devon, Sean, and Dr. Lee all gain a new and broader perspective.  In the other side plot, Devon meets a great girl (played by the extremely hot and talented Zoe Saldana) with looks and brains who has her own issues about pursuing her desires and what her parents want.Let me comment for a moment about the Editorial Reviews above.  First, I marched ""corps"" style in marching band and then military style in the Marine Corps and this style of marching is exactly opposite of ""military precision of college football marching bands.""  It is high stepping and full of highly choreographed dance.  Second, Devon is not a ""street drummer"" as in the first scene he is playing with his high school band and you never see him playing on the street.  My two cents on the Editorial Reviews.I found ""Drumline"" to be a great film which I can watch again and again.  The bands are fantastic, the story is entertaining, and the music is ""off the chain.""  It's the kind of film of which I wish I could be a part.  Aside from a few bad words and some sexy dancing, this film is suitable for families with older children and the PG-13 rating is apt.

The football contest's controlled mayhem makes way for the blaring sound of trumpets and the heart-thumping rhythm of drums. This movie can't be beat for its dazzling theatrics and foot-stomping fun.

601105,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLH2,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","&quot;Drumline&quot; is a surprisingly good film about music, or beat.  At first, you may dislike its almost military-like discipline shown in the story, but the music and drama will gradually win you over, with the great showdown about &quot;the battle of drumlines&quot; which is a minor classic.New star Nick Cannon is Devon, New-York born freshman in the University in Atlanta.  He is a skilled drummer (of snare drum), recruited to make it as a musician there, and possibly win the love of a girl Laila (Zoe Saldana).  Well, that was his idea.However, to his dismay, the &quot;band&quot; of the university turns out something different.  It is, though within the reasonable rules, something like army, where you have to wake up at 4 am.; where you have to train your bodies even in the hard rain; or -- this is the most important part -- the ego clashes between him and one senior member Sean, who thinks this able rookie can be the threat to his role.The film's greatest merit is its beat, most eloquently shown in the final scene -- the national contest for the band.  In it, you experience the thrill and excitement of the marching band's incredibly rousing beat, which would justify the film's overlong and a little predictable story.  In other words, once you see it, the &quot;half-time&quot; itself becomes the sports.The school drama is not particularly great, but reasonably presented, without relying on cliched storytelling.  Besides Zoe Saldana (&quot;Crossroads&quot;), you will see GQ, Leonard Roberts as Sean, Jason Weaver, and Orlando Jones as the coach, whose quiet but assured manners as teacher add the convincing touch to the film.Like &quot;Bring it on,&quot; &quot;Drumline&quot; will change the image and definition of marching band.  It takes what it describes seriously, and rightly so.  And it finally pays off.",4,"Bang the Drum Loudly, and Beautifully: Real Showtime!",1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,1842,"['quot', 'Drumline', 'quot', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'music', 'beat', 'first', 'may', 'dislike', 'almost', 'military-like', 'discipline', 'shown', 'story', 'music', 'drama', 'will', 'gradually', 'win', 'over', 'great', 'showdown', 'quot', 'battle', 'drumlines', 'quot', 'minor', 'classic.New', 'star', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'Devon', 'New-York', 'born', 'freshman', 'University', 'Atlanta', 'skilled', 'drummer', 'snare', 'drum', 'recruited', 'make', 'musician', 'there', 'possibly', 'win', 'love', 'girl', 'Laila', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'Well', 'was', 'idea.However', 'dismay', 'quot', 'band', 'quot', 'university', 'out', 'something', 'different', 'reasonable', 'rules', 'something', 'army', 'where', 'have', 'wake', 'up', '4', 'am', 'where', 'have', 'train', 'bodies', 'even', 'hard', 'rain', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'ego', 'clashes', 'one', 'senior', 'member', 'Sean', 'who', 'able', 'rookie', 'can', 'be', 'threat', 'role.The', 'film', 'greatest', 'merit', 'beat', 'most', 'eloquently', 'shown', 'final', 'scene', 'national', 'contest', 'band', 'experience', 'thrill', 'excitement', 'marching', 'band', 'incredibly', 'rousing', 'beat', 'would', 'justify', 'film', 'overlong', 'little', 'predictable', 'story', 'other', 'words', 'once', 'see', 'quot', 'half-time', 'quot', 'sports.The', 'school', 'drama', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'reasonably', 'presented', 'relying', 'cliched', 'storytelling', 'Zoe', 'Saldana', 'quot', 'Crossroads', 'quot', 'will', 'see', 'GQ', 'Leonard', 'Roberts', 'Sean', 'Jason', 'Weaver', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'coach', 'quiet', 'assured', 'manners', 'teacher', 'convincing', 'touch', 'film.Like', 'quot', 'Bring', 'quot', 'quot', 'Drumline', 'quot', 'will', 'change', 'image', 'definition', 'marching', 'band', 'what', 'seriously', 'rightly', 'so', 'finally', 'off']",Drumline VHS
