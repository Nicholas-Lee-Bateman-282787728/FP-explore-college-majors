Michael Click,"[3, 4]","Although I'm a huge fan of Burt Lancaster, with an affinity for Westerns, even I have to admit that ""Apache"" is not one of Burt's best films.  Very loosely based on the true story of the last member of the title tribe to resist the sociological and cultural changes brought about by the advancement of the white man, the film is well-acted, ably directed, and impressively photographed.  However, the script by James R. Webb too often sacrifices characterization and context for action, and thus the audience is never really given the opportunity to learn much about the background of Lancaster's character, Massai, and what has made him into the man we meet in the film's opening sequence.  ""Apache"" runs roughly an hour and a half; had an extra fifteen to twenty minutes been added showing Massai's early years and establishing his tribe's cultural heritage, the movie would have taken on additional dimensions and layers and might have been a great motion picture rather than just a good one.Speaking of the film's length, its actual running time has been in dispute since its original theatrical release back in 1954.  Even then, various resources listed it as running as short as 86 minutes, and as long as 91 minutes.  The MGM ""Western Legends"" DVD release (copyrighted in 2001) runs 87 minutes, and there is no solid evidence to indicate that any footage is missing from this version.  Similarly, although some modern sources claim that ""Apache"" was originally exhibited in a 1.85:1 widescreen format, that ratio would have made the film an anomaly back in 1954 when CinemaScope was still in its infancy and most features were still being produced in the standard 1.37:1 format.  The ""Western Legends"" release notes that the DVD is presented in a standard, ""modified to fit your screen"" ratio, but my research has lead me to conclude that the film was modified from 1.37:1 down to 1.33:1, not from 1.85:1 down to 1.33:1.What is certain is that the ""Western Legends"" DVD release does not offer the best print of the film now available in terms of visual clarity.  While some scenes are remarkably sharp and clear, others are too soft, with improper color balance.  A more consistent, seemingly restored print has been screened on various premium cable TV channels during the past few years.  Hopefully, this improved edition will be made available on DVD and/or Blu-Ray in the future, now that the ""Western Legends"" DVD has gone out-of-print.",3,"APACHE:  Film, Format, Timing & Quality of the 2001 DVD Release",1295049600,"01 15, 2011",2011,2448,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'affinity', 'Westerns', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'Apache', 'not', 'one', 'Burt', 'best', 'films', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'last', 'member', 'title', 'tribe', 'resist', 'sociological', 'cultural', 'changes', 'brought', 'about', 'advancement', 'white', 'man', 'film', 'well-acted', 'ably', 'directed', 'impressively', 'photographed', 'However', 'script', 'James', 'R.', 'Webb', 'too', 'often', 'characterization', 'context', 'action', 'thus', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'given', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'much', 'background', 'Lancaster', 'character', 'Massai', 'made', 'man', 'meet', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Apache', 'roughly', 'hour', 'half', 'had', 'extra', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'been', 'added', 'showing', 'Massai', 'early', 'years', 'establishing', 'tribe', 'cultural', 'heritage', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'additional', 'dimensions', 'layers', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'motion', 'picture', 'rather', 'just', 'good', 'one.Speaking', 'film', 'length', 'actual', 'running', 'time', 'been', 'dispute', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'back', '1954', 'Even', 'then', 'various', 'resources', 'listed', 'as', 'running', 'as', 'short', '86', 'minutes', 'as', 'long', '91', 'minutes', 'MGM', 'Western', 'Legends', 'DVD', 'release', 'copyrighted', '2001', '87', 'minutes', 'solid', 'evidence', 'indicate', 'footage', 'missing', 'version', 'Similarly', 'modern', 'sources', 'claim', 'Apache', 'was', 'originally', 'exhibited', '1.85:1', 'widescreen', 'format', 'ratio', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'anomaly', 'back', '1954', 'when', 'CinemaScope', 'was', 'still', 'infancy', 'most', 'features', 'were', 'still', 'being', 'produced', 'standard', '1.37:1', 'format', 'Western', 'Legends', 'release', 'DVD', 'presented', 'standard', 'modified', 'fit', 'screen', 'ratio', 'research', 'lead', 'conclude', 'film', 'was', 'modified', '1.37:1', 'down', '1.33:1', 'not', '1.85:1', 'down', '1.33:1.What', 'certain', 'Western', 'Legends', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'offer', 'best', 'print', 'film', 'now', 'available', 'terms', 'visual', 'clarity', 'scenes', 'are', 'remarkably', 'sharp', 'clear', 'others', 'are', 'too', 'soft', 'improper', 'color', 'balance', 'more', 'consistent', 'seemingly', 'restored', 'print', 'been', 'screened', 'various', 'premium', 'cable', 'TV', 'channels', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Hopefully', 'improved', 'edition', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'available', 'DVD', 'and/or', 'Blu-Ray', 'future', 'now', 'Western', 'Legends', 'DVD', 'gone', 'out-of-print']",N/A

This one (Apache) is one of my all time favorite western movies and stars Burt Lancaster as Masai and Jean Peters, as his wife and lover.  This movie came out in 1954 and I saw it at the movies at that time as well as purchased the DVD when it came out in order to view it again and again.There may be a question as to it being totally accurate from a historical perspective; however, for pure entertainment and great acting, you can't beat this fantastic action movie.  Historically, there was an Apache named Masai who in fact resisted giving up to authorities when Geronimo and other Indian warriors were sent to Florida reservations.I used to be a real fan of the late Burt Lancaster and think he was one of the very best actors who ever lived.  The natural beauty and great acting of Jean Peters has always impressed me.  In fact, I remember as a young kid I thought I was in love with Jean Peters after seeing her in a few early 1950s movies.In conclusion, if you are a western movie fan you may want to check out this DVD.  Do not believe some of the negative reviews of this movie.  This is an entertaining and exciting movie with two great legends of the screen.Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J.

574628,A1ORZ2ZH5MIZCG,B000059TFS,Kay's Husband,"[1, 1]","I have seen this film since it was first released and now also own a DVD of it too.  I have always viewed the movie as first class entertainment and never as a historical documentary. I feel many people go astray when viewing anything as one thing when in actuality it is entirely a different thing.The film may be termed a historical fiction but it will never be a historical documentary.  The story is based on the 1936 novel by Paul I. Wellman entitled BRONCO APACHE, published by Macmillen. Though the movie script was written by James R. Webb, the novel was the basis for the movie. And mostly the movie is just that, a fiction set in Arizona Territory late in the Apache Wars.History can be brought into this in some ways, as Frederick Remington published an article in the January, 1898, Harper's Monthly, entitled ""Massai's Crooked Trail"".  I have a copy of that article in which Remington calls Massai a 'Chiricahua warrior', yet Dan Thrapp in his 1964 biography of Al Seiber entitled AL SEIBER, CHIEF OF SCOUTS, mentions Massai as 'a Warm Springs Apache'.  Remington goes on in his article to recite the little that is known about Massai.  As one chief of scouts said: the story of Massai was not as long as his trail. Many saw his footprints but never his face.  No one knows what Massai looked like, nor do we know how his name should be spelled.  Dan L. Thrapp mentions several possible variations: ""Massa"", ""Massi"", ""Masai"", ""Wasse"" or ""Massey"".  Most of what Dan Thrapp wrote concerning Massai was based on the story told by Jason Betzinez.Remington relates his story based on both Apache and 10th Cavalry views, that Massai did escape a train east of Kansas City, moved south and then west till at ""last he came to the lands of the Mescalero Apaches, where he stayed for some time.""  It is said it had taken him a full year to make this journey.  According to Remington, Massai abducted several different women over time, killing some, while allowing others to go free. His story is based primarily on one young woman named, Natastale, who, after Massai had murdered her mother, spent a considerable time as a captive with Massai.  She was one similar to that portrayed by Jean Peters in the movie as tied up by the feet so she could sleep on her back.  Massai kept her tied up during much of their time together.  Though they lived as man and wife, Massai as far as known never married Natastale.  All this is related by Frederick Remington in his 1898 article.From what history does tell us Massai was never taken prisoner, there are some stories that say he was killed, but with all the mist surrounding this story no one can say for certain. Massai was what was known then in Arizona Territory as a 'wild one' or 'netdahe'.  As such he was a dedicated killer, one who would kill Mexicans, whites, or other Indians without compunction. Massai was a warrior killer, always a destroyer, never a builder during these years, whether he later became a productive member among the Apaches remains unknown by the whites. Possibly the Apaches know more, but they aren't talking.  Though I have never read of the Apaches at this period of time growing corn, it is said that Geronimo ended his days at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, growing pumpkins and squash.The movie does a great job for a 1950s venture for both providing entertainment and entering into the semi-historical, fictional area of the Apache Wars. In Arizona Territory of that day violence was done by each side to the other, but it also must be remembered equal amounts of good also existed in some members of both sides.  In time both sides needed this war to end.  Each viewer will need to decide just what view he or she will take away from this movie.As the old chief of scouts once said: ""that's the story of Massai. It is not as long as his trail.""Semper Fi.",5,ENTERTAINMENT AND SAGA ROLLED INTO ONE,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,3831,"['have', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'now', 'also', 'own', 'DVD', 'too', 'have', 'always', 'viewed', 'movie', 'first', 'class', 'entertainment', 'never', 'historical', 'documentary', 'feel', 'many', 'people', 'go', 'astray', 'when', 'viewing', 'anything', 'one', 'thing', 'when', 'actuality', 'entirely', 'different', 'thing.The', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'termed', 'historical', 'fiction', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'historical', 'documentary', 'story', 'based', '1936', 'novel', 'Paul', 'I.', 'Wellman', 'entitled', 'BRONCO', 'APACHE', 'published', 'Macmillen', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'James', 'R.', 'Webb', 'novel', 'was', 'basis', 'movie', 'mostly', 'movie', 'just', 'that', 'fiction', 'set', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'late', 'Apache', 'Wars.History', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'ways', 'Frederick', 'Remington', 'published', 'article', 'January', '1898', 'Harper', 'Monthly', 'entitled', 'Massai', 'Crooked', 'Trail', 'have', 'copy', 'article', 'Remington', 'Massai', ""'Chiricahua"", 'warrior', 'yet', 'Dan', 'Thrapp', '1964', 'biography', 'Al', 'Seiber', 'entitled', 'AL', 'SEIBER', 'CHIEF', 'OF', 'SCOUTS', 'mentions', 'Massai', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Apache', 'Remington', 'article', 'recite', 'little', 'known', 'Massai', 'one', 'chief', 'scouts', 'said', 'story', 'Massai', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'trail', 'Many', 'saw', 'footprints', 'never', 'face', 'one', 'what', 'Massai', 'looked', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'name', 'should', 'be', 'spelled', 'Dan', 'L.', 'Thrapp', 'mentions', 'several', 'possible', 'variations', 'Massa', 'Massi', 'Masai', 'Wasse', 'Massey', 'Most', 'what', 'Dan', 'Thrapp', 'wrote', 'concerning', 'Massai', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'told', 'Jason', 'Betzinez.Remington', 'story', 'based', 'Apache', '10th', 'Cavalry', 'views', 'Massai', 'did', 'escape', 'train', 'east', 'Kansas', 'City', 'moved', 'south', 'then', 'west', 'till', 'last', 'came', 'lands', 'Mescalero', 'Apaches', 'where', 'stayed', 'time', 'said', 'had', 'taken', 'full', 'year', 'make', 'journey', 'According', 'Remington', 'Massai', 'abducted', 'several', 'different', 'women', 'time', 'killing', 'allowing', 'others', 'go', 'free', 'story', 'based', 'primarily', 'one', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Natastale', 'who', 'Massai', 'had', 'murdered', 'mother', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'captive', 'Massai', 'was', 'one', 'similar', 'portrayed', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'movie', 'tied', 'up', 'feet', 'could', 'sleep', 'back', 'Massai', 'kept', 'tied', 'much', 'time', 'together', 'lived', 'man', 'wife', 'Massai', 'as', 'far', 'known', 'never', 'married', 'Natastale', 'related', 'Frederick', 'Remington', '1898', 'what', 'history', 'tell', 'Massai', 'was', 'never', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'are', 'stories', 'say', 'was', 'killed', 'mist', 'surrounding', 'story', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'certain', 'Massai', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'known', 'then', 'Arizona', 'Territory', ""'wild"", 'one', 'such', 'was', 'dedicated', 'killer', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'Mexicans', 'whites', 'other', 'Indians', 'compunction', 'Massai', 'was', 'warrior', 'killer', 'always', 'destroyer', 'never', 'builder', 'years', 'later', 'became', 'productive', 'member', 'Apaches', 'unknown', 'whites', 'Possibly', 'Apaches', 'know', 'more', 'are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Apaches', 'period', 'time', 'growing', 'corn', 'said', 'Geronimo', 'ended', 'days', 'Fort', 'Sill', 'Oklahoma', 'growing', 'pumpkins', 'squash.The', 'movie', 'great', 'job', '1950s', 'venture', 'providing', 'entertainment', 'entering', 'semi-historical', 'fictional', 'area', 'Apache', 'Wars', 'Arizona', 'Territory', 'day', 'violence', 'was', 'done', 'side', 'other', 'also', 'must', 'be', 'remembered', 'equal', 'amounts', 'good', 'also', 'existed', 'members', 'sides', 'time', 'sides', 'needed', 'war', 'end', 'viewer', 'will', 'need', 'decide', 'just', 'what', 'view', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'old', 'chief', 'scouts', 'once', 'said', 'story', 'Massai', 'not', 'as', 'long', 'trail', 'Semper', 'Fi']",N/A

The Apache had happy lives before the government came along and tried to squish them onto reservations. Masai, a member of the Apache tribe, is rightfully indignant when they unceremoniously toss him into a boxcar and ship him off to Florida with Geronimo.True to the famed Apache long distance running talent, Masai escapes and manages the long, arduous trek back to his homeland. He even has a right to be cynical about his native american friends, when he is sometimes helped and sometime hindered by them. It gets to the point that he wages a one man feud against everyone around him.That all being said, it was hard for me to setle into a mindset where I could really relate to Masai *being* a Native American. He's played by Burt Lancaster. He always looked like Burt Lancaster with red paint on him. His sweetheart in the film is Jean Peters, who looks like a white woman with red paint on her. Masai is really foul to her throughout the movie. You would think, if he really wanted to perpetuate the Apache way, that he'd want to have a female around to do this with. Instead, he actively torments the only ally he has in his fight.When he finally does weaken enough to allow her to stay with him, the movie becomes unbelievable. The ending sequence does not make a lot of sense.Most of the movie focusses on the towns of the old west. You get to see very little of the culture that Masai was trying to preserve. You get much more of what the natives had been assimilated into. If we are going to see hours of Masai fighting for what he believes in, I would have loved to have seen that ground laying time, to really appreciate what the Apache culture was all about.

Apache had been my 1st language; however, Catholic Nuns taught me English but also encouraged me to retain my original language.  I have seen the movie.  In my family, I have relatives who were scouts for the US Calvary (Chief Alchesay) and others who were renegades.  This movie does have have some level of of historical realism.  It shows the excessive use of Apache Scouts and the fact that not all Chiricuahua Apaches surrendered.  There was actually a small group that never did, and their story parallels those of the Seminoles who hid out in the Everglades.  I am related to Massai, who escaped from St. Louis.  I am also related to Chief Alchesay, the head scout whose warriors captured Geronimo.  He was constantly on the run from Apache scouts closely on his trail in the most remote and inaccessible canyons of the southwest.  It had been the strategy of General Crook and readopted by General Miles in the closing end of his campaign.Al Sieber admitted that he failed in finding the Apache Kid and Massai, the renegades who were still at large at the end of the 19th century.  Sieber was also very racist and referred to Apaches as ""Red N-----s.""  So much for his being politically correct.  I am related to Massai on my mother's side and the Apache Kid on my father's side.  Massai was dying of tuberculosis and reportedly killed in the early 1900s, and his widow and children returned to Mescalero.  The Apache Kid was last seen by his relatives in San Carlos around 1935.  As for the scouts, Alchesay's relatives were WWII veterans.  One of them died during the allied invasion of Germany while attacking Nazi gunner pits.  Another was an Apache US Marine at Iwo Jima in 1945 (Semper Fidelis - USMC).In regards to negative feedback from others, there are parts of the movie that are historically or culturally incorrect.  In the first place, the entire movie is made with white actors who only speak English.  Secondly, the scene with Massai tying up his wife is incorrect.  In addition, there was a slave trade imposed upon Apaches by Mexico.  The Mexican government also offered money for Apache scalps.The rugged terrain and mountain running are most accurate.

Geronimo's ceremonious surrender is disrupted by Massai, who is quickly captured by Indian scout Al Sieber (another real person, played by John McIntyre).  Sieber denies him a warrior's death and, instead, has him join the herd on the Florida bound train.What follows is a blend of historical fictionalization and Hollywood hooey.  Massai escapes the deportation train and arduously makes his way back to his home, now a reservation, which he detests.  As Massai, alienated from his subjected people and loathing those who subject them, says at one point ""Every white man, every Indian is my enemy.... I can't stop fighting.  I'm the last real Apache left in the world.""All fodder for a terrific western, but APACHE is far from that.  In fact, save for the energetic Lancaster, this movie lacks the dramatic punch you'd expect from the source material.  Granted, the real story of depredations and atrocities, on both sides, is a little too messy for Hollywood.  Even though there's not much known about Massai, you'd think they could have concocted something a little more stirring than this whitewash.Love interest Jean Peters, the beautiful Jean Peters, although cast in a rugged enough role, proves the maxim that women are death to action movies.

Massai begins to cut telegraph lines, burn bridges, and even attacks a fort single-handedly in the night.  All through his war, the army sends a scout and several Indians who now work for the army after him to bring him in so he does not start a another war.

Jean Peters plays his wife even though for much of the movie, he either ignores her or mistreats her.  John McIntire is very good as the scout sent to track Massai down.

574640,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000059TFS,trebe,"[4, 4]","Robert Aldrich's Apache (1954) features Burt Lancaster as Massai, supposedly an actual Apache brave who escapes capture by the white man and continues to fight a personal battle.  Historical accuracy is open to question, but the athletic Lancaster, has ample opportunities to display his physical prowess, running, jumping, diving, and fighting anyone that gets in his way.After being defeated by the US Calvary, Apache braves located in what is now the state of New Mexico, are placed on a train bound for Florida.  Somewhere near St. Louis, Massai escapes and heads back to his tribal lands.  On the long journey back, he encounters a member of the Cherokee tribe living as a farmer, who gives him some seed corn, and advice about farming and living in peace with the white man.Returning to his defeated tribe, Massai is betrayed by his own people, but manages to turn the tables on his captors again.  He takes his revenge on the Calvary, and abducts Nalinle (Jean Peters) the Chief's daughter, who he mistakenly believes has betrayed him.  Massai brutally mistreats her, but does not break Nalinle's spirit, which is probably even stronger than his own.  Eventually, the two marry, and are expecting a child.  After a life of violence, impending fatherhood causes Massai to give farming corn a try.  Still pursued by the army, there is one last battle.  Although the real Massai apparently perished in a cornfield, United Artists was apparently concerned that the death of Lancaster's character would negatively affect the film's profitability, so the film ends in a most unconvincing fashion.  Although with a Hollywood perspective, Apache is an interesting tale, one of the first sympathetic to the native Indian point of view.  Aldrich and Lancaster would team up again in another western, Ulzana's Raid in 1972.Apache was physically demanding for Burt Lancaster, and also for Jean Peters, who endured numerous hardships in the production.  She apparently did not have the warmest of feelings for her co-star, and would only do a couple more films in the 50's, before marrying Howard Hughes in 1957, and then retiring from the business.
