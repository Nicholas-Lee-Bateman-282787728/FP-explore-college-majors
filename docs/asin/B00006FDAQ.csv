713104,A2Q5K1G3S8RLWX,B00006FDAQ,"Lunar Strain ""Thrash, don't mind if I do""","[7, 11]","After recently purchasing the Missing in Action 2 & 3 double feature dvd, I have have noticed many plot holes in connecting the series. Missing in Action 2 isn't near as guilty as part 3, but it still has a few. MIA 2 is a prequel to the original so hence it takes place befor it with Braddock getting captured and held in a POW camp. The only real plot holes it it doesn't contain the characters out of Braddocks past that were present in the first film. These characters are the sadistic guard that tortured Braddock and his war time buddy M. Emmit Walsh. These plot holes were acceptables as the filmmakers didn't know they were going to make a sequel when the first film was made so the actors were probably not available or maybe the writers just found it easier to ignore the characters altogether. Now moving on to MIA 3. MIA 3 begins with Braddock being in Siagon when America is pulling out. Anyone who has seen the first two films know that this cannot be as Braddock was captured before teh war was over and was held in a POW camp for 7 years in which during that time the war ended. It mentions in the second film that the POWs didn't even know that the war was over. The film also has Braddock have a Vietamanese wife which he presumes is dead after an explosion in Siagon. This also cannot be as it says in MIA 2 that Braddock has a wife back in the states. Its as if the writers decided to go a whole new direction with the character Braddock and totally ignore the first two films. Maybe they were hoping that the audiences wouldn't remember the plots of the first films or that they just wouldn't care, but there are a few people like me that do care and such carelessness for plot holes makes us a little angry. But then again its only a MIA movie so I shouldn't get too worked up over it. Even though they have plot holes, I found both films to be highly entertianing B-Grade action films in the vein of the Rambo series. I even found it interesting on how the title Braddock: Missing in Action III is reminicent of Rambo: First Blood, Part II. Maybe the filmmakers were trying to get Braddock to be a household action name as with Rambo, which obviously they did not succeed in.",4,Plot holes abound....,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,2198,"['recently', 'purchasing', 'Missing', 'Action', '2', '3', 'double', 'feature', 'dvd', 'have', 'have', 'noticed', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'connecting', 'series', 'Missing', 'Action', '2', ""n't"", 'near', 'as', 'guilty', 'part', '3', 'still', 'few', 'MIA', '2', 'prequel', 'original', 'so', 'hence', 'place', 'befor', 'Braddock', 'getting', 'captured', 'held', 'POW', 'camp', 'only', 'real', 'plot', ""n't"", 'contain', 'characters', 'Braddocks', 'were', 'present', 'first', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'sadistic', 'guard', 'tortured', 'Braddock', 'war', 'time', 'buddy', 'M.', 'Emmit', 'Walsh', 'plot', 'holes', 'were', 'acceptables', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'sequel', 'when', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'so', 'actors', 'were', 'probably', 'not', 'available', 'maybe', 'writers', 'just', 'found', 'easier', 'ignore', 'characters', 'altogether', 'Now', 'moving', 'MIA', '3', 'MIA', '3', 'begins', 'Braddock', 'being', 'Siagon', 'when', 'America', 'pulling', 'out', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Braddock', 'was', 'captured', 'teh', 'war', 'was', 'was', 'held', 'POW', 'camp', '7', 'years', 'time', 'war', 'ended', 'second', 'film', 'POWs', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'film', 'also', 'Braddock', 'have', 'Vietamanese', 'wife', 'dead', 'explosion', 'Siagon', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'MIA', '2', 'Braddock', 'wife', 'back', 'states', 'writers', 'decided', 'go', 'whole', 'new', 'direction', 'character', 'Braddock', 'totally', 'ignore', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'Maybe', 'were', 'hoping', 'audiences', 'would', ""n't"", 'remember', 'plots', 'first', 'films', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'do', 'care', 'such', 'carelessness', 'plot', 'holes', 'little', 'angry', 'then', 'again', 'only', 'MIA', 'movie', 'so', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'worked', 'up', 'Even', 'have', 'plot', 'holes', 'found', 'films', 'be', 'highly', 'entertianing', 'B-Grade', 'action', 'films', 'vein', 'Rambo', 'series', 'even', 'found', 'interesting', 'how', 'title', 'Braddock', 'Missing', 'Action', 'III', 'reminicent', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Part', 'II', 'Maybe', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'Braddock', 'be', 'household', 'action', 'name', 'Rambo', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'succeed']",N/A

713109,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B00006FDAQ,Sid the Elf,"[4, 6]","Missing In Action II: The Begining. What a prophetic title for this unintentional comedy classic. It was the begining of many things. It is the trailblazer in explosions occuring behind guys, and having them jump off a springboard to appear as if they're getting blown away. It started the template for every WWF match of the late 80's(it even featured Mr. Fuji as one of the evil henchmen)in the way that Chuck and his co-star Soon-Teck Oh Yeah obviously got together just 5 minutes before the final fight scene to rehearse their slow motion punches and kicks. The film is really a thing of beauty. And as far as we, Sid the Elf know, it was the first film in which a flamethrower was used. Read that again. Yes! Awesome! Major bonus points here.Sid was nearly moved to tears when the evil Col. Yin placed a bag containing a provoked rat on a bound Chuck's head. The cruelty was alarming. But, a simple rhodent going up against the all-knowing, all-powerful Chuck was no competition at all. Sid called it when he said, ""Chuck's going to eat the rat and have the tail hanging out of his mouth when they pull the bag off."" This is the kind of knowlwdge gained by THE B expert from his vast experiance. We knew Chuck was eating the rat. And we wouldn't have it any other way. Well, now that Chuck had nourished his body with the high protein content of Vietnimeese rat meat, he was as strong as a POW could ever be.Still, Chuck was keeping his cool against the provocation of his captors all while never rebuking US and A, greatest country in the world. That is, until he was pushed over the edge. Then evil Col. Yin and his crew of flunkies were like a cobra's prey, ready to be pounced upon and struck at a moment's notice. At this point in the film, Sid found himself saying, ""May Chuck Norris drink the blood of every man, woman, and child of Vietnam."" And fortunately, Norris is a better man than Sid. He only drank the blood of all of his captors! He rescued his men, sent them away in a stolen drug chopper(don't ask) and stayed behind.Why, you ask? Then you obviously don't know the Chuck formula. It goes like this: always be loyal, take the bad guys and finish them, and stay behind at a prison camp of which nobody knows the location and noone knows you are there to have a final showdown with the main bad guy, throw away your gun so you can fight him fair eventhough he has been tourturing you and your comrades long enough for you to grow a horrific 70's porn beard, kick the wontons out of him while saying, ""This is for (fill in name of fellow inmate). Then, a split second before you press the button to blow his lair to pieces, say, ""And this is for me."" Huge explosion (just one of the many in the film). And roll closing credits.If you remember to abandon logic like with all unintentional comedy you should love this film. It is legitamately good. It really doesn't matter that they made a prequel that ignored all the flashbacks from the first movie right? Well, at least Sid thinks it can be made up for with some good old-fashioned American propoganda and a flamethrower.Chills, right? Your goosebumps' goosebumps have goosebumps don't they? Exactly. Take Sid the Elf's word for it and see Missing in Action II. Oh, yeah you will freaking love it.",5,"In Missing in Action II: The Begining, Chuck Norris ends the POW crisis one snapped neck at a time.",1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3269,"['Missing', 'Action', 'II', 'Begining', 'What', 'prophetic', 'title', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'classic', 'was', 'begining', 'many', 'things', 'trailblazer', 'explosions', 'occuring', 'guys', 'having', 'jump', 'off', 'springboard', 'appear', ""'re"", 'getting', 'blown', 'away', 'started', 'template', 'WWF', 'match', 'late', '80', 'even', 'featured', 'Mr.', 'Fuji', 'one', 'evil', 'henchmen', 'way', 'Chuck', 'co-star', 'Soon-Teck', 'Oh', 'Yeah', 'obviously', 'got', 'together', 'just', '5', 'minutes', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'rehearse', 'slow', 'motion', 'punches', 'kicks', 'film', 'really', 'thing', 'beauty', 'as', 'far', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'know', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'flamethrower', 'was', 'used', 'Read', 'again', 'Yes', 'Awesome', 'Major', 'bonus', 'points', 'here.Sid', 'was', 'nearly', 'moved', 'tears', 'when', 'evil', 'Col.', 'Yin', 'placed', 'bag', 'containing', 'provoked', 'rat', 'bound', 'Chuck', 'head', 'cruelty', 'was', 'alarming', 'simple', 'rhodent', 'going', 'up', 'all-knowing', 'all-powerful', 'Chuck', 'was', 'competition', 'Sid', 'called', 'when', 'said', 'Chuck', 'going', 'eat', 'rat', 'have', 'tail', 'hanging', 'mouth', 'when', 'pull', 'bag', 'off', 'kind', 'knowlwdge', 'gained', 'THE', 'B', 'expert', 'vast', 'experiance', 'knew', 'Chuck', 'was', 'eating', 'rat', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way', 'Well', 'now', 'Chuck', 'had', 'nourished', 'body', 'high', 'protein', 'content', 'Vietnimeese', 'rat', 'meat', 'was', 'as', 'strong', 'POW', 'could', 'ever', 'be.Still', 'Chuck', 'was', 'keeping', 'cool', 'provocation', 'captors', 'never', 'rebuking', 'US', 'A', 'greatest', 'country', 'world', 'was', 'pushed', 'edge', 'Then', 'evil', 'Col.', 'Yin', 'crew', 'flunkies', 'were', 'cobra', 'prey', 'ready', 'be', 'pounced', 'struck', 'moment', 'notice', 'point', 'film', 'Sid', 'found', 'saying', 'May', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'drink', 'blood', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'Vietnam', 'fortunately', 'Norris', 'better', 'man', 'Sid', 'only', 'drank', 'blood', 'captors', 'rescued', 'men', 'sent', 'away', 'stolen', 'drug', 'chopper', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'stayed', 'behind.Why', 'ask', 'Then', 'obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chuck', 'formula', 'always', 'be', 'loyal', 'take', 'bad', 'guys', 'finish', 'stay', 'behind', 'prison', 'camp', 'nobody', 'location', 'noone', 'knows', 'are', 'there', 'have', 'final', 'showdown', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'throw', 'away', 'gun', 'can', 'fight', 'fair', 'been', 'tourturing', 'comrades', 'long', 'enough', 'grow', 'horrific', '70', 'porn', 'beard', 'kick', 'wontons', 'saying', 'fill', 'name', 'fellow', 'inmate', 'Then', 'split', 'second', 'press', 'button', 'blow', 'lair', 'pieces', 'say', 'Huge', 'explosion', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'film', 'roll', 'closing', 'credits.If', 'remember', 'abandon', 'logic', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'should', 'love', 'film', 'legitamately', 'good', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'made', 'prequel', 'ignored', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'movie', 'right', 'Well', 'least', 'Sid', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'up', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'American', 'propoganda', 'flamethrower.Chills', 'right', 'goosebumps', 'goosebumps', 'have', 'goosebumps', 'do', ""n't"", 'Exactly', 'Take', 'Sid', 'Elf', 'word', 'see', 'Missing', 'Action', 'II', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'will', 'freaking', 'love']",N/A
