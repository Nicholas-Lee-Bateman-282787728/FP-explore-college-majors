And it's great because the lead character isn't portrayed as a stereotypical gay.

The smart was that they are showing a gay character in a movie who is like everyone else, just gay.  But again, that is the way it has always been, Hollywood just has rarely ever shown the character that way.  Excellent acting, and the Chemistry between the two guys just feeds the plot all the more.  The supporting characters were all amazing, this was a fine production, the writing was top notch, I just can't say enough, it was a great experience.  I am so glad I rented this, now I'm going to buy it.

Their big plan is to lose their virginity by prom night and eat a huge pot brownie afterwards. This becomes more difficult as both break up with their girl friends. Then Matty comes out to Mike. While Matty is gay, he is not comfortable with the gay scene. Mike tries to help Matty get a guy, but has problems with life's recent changes.The film is a comedy, which was amusing but not terribly funny. I was hoping for something more funny than guys taking their clothes off jumping around in foam.
