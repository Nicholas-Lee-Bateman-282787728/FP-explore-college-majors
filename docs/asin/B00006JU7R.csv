718987,A91BK8S5QH98K,B00006JU7R,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[1, 1]","This movie held my interest from start to finish, even though, I guessed who did it early on.  It is set in an elite all boys' boarding school.  With the focus being on a group of the boys who have formed their own independent clique (fraternity).  A murder happens disguised as an accident and we are held on the edge of our seat to find out the mystery of how, who, and why it happened.  It has some swearing throughout the movie.  And there is one scene where the girl visits the lead guy in his room and is very seductive which seems misplaced.  However, overall, the movie was a very good one.",5,This movie captures your interest!,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,598,"['movie', 'held', 'interest', 'start', 'finish', 'even', 'guessed', 'who', 'did', 'early', 'set', 'elite', 'boys', 'boarding', 'school', 'focus', 'being', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'own', 'independent', 'clique', 'fraternity', 'murder', 'disguised', 'accident', 'are', 'held', 'edge', 'seat', 'find', 'out', 'mystery', 'how', 'who', 'why', 'happened', 'swearing', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'girl', 'lead', 'guy', 'room', 'very', 'seductive', 'misplaced', 'However', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'one']",N/A

718989,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00006JU7R,Michael Butts,"[5, 5]","Action director Sidney J. Furie tries a change of pace with this leisurely, convoluted thriller set in a private boys school.  Treat Williams is the headmaster of the Runcie Academy, handed down from his late father.  He is a man of little elasticity, a firm hand on these predominantly rich young men.  Within the school are five students who have formed a &quot;circle&quot;, in which they have placed listening devices in several of the offices, rounded up drug dealers and other covert actions, not always in the best of interests.  When they decide to steal the test results for a major exam, one of them is caught, and an informant makes sure that the student is expelled.  Said informant is suddenly dead, a victim of either suicide, accident or murder!  One stalwart member of the group (Robin Dunne) starts to investigate when it appears that the dead student was murdered by one of his fellow fraternal brothers.There are some nice twists, and overall the acting is credible.  Some beautiful snowy shots of the countryside and school are also attractive.Not a truly menacing movie, but it is worth watching.",3,NOT SO BROTHERLY LOVE,1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,1117,"['Action', 'director', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', 'change', 'pace', 'leisurely', 'convoluted', 'thriller', 'set', 'private', 'boys', 'school', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'headmaster', 'Runcie', 'Academy', 'handed', 'down', 'late', 'father', 'man', 'little', 'elasticity', 'firm', 'hand', 'predominantly', 'rich', 'young', 'men', 'school', 'are', 'five', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'formed', 'quot', 'circle', 'quot', 'have', 'placed', 'listening', 'devices', 'several', 'offices', 'rounded', 'up', 'drug', 'dealers', 'other', 'covert', 'actions', 'not', 'always', 'best', 'interests', 'When', 'decide', 'steal', 'test', 'results', 'major', 'exam', 'one', 'caught', 'informant', 'sure', 'student', 'expelled', 'Said', 'informant', 'suddenly', 'dead', 'victim', 'suicide', 'accident', 'murder', 'One', 'stalwart', 'member', 'group', 'Robin', 'Dunne', 'investigate', 'when', 'dead', 'student', 'was', 'murdered', 'one', 'fellow', 'fraternal', 'are', 'nice', 'twists', 'overall', 'acting', 'credible', 'beautiful', 'snowy', 'shots', 'countryside', 'school', 'are', 'also', 'attractive.Not', 'truly', 'menacing', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
