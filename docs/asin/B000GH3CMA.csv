1004149,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,B000GH3CMA,A. Pierre,"[0, 0]","When I read the synposis for this movie I figured it would be some horror comedy. Damn was I wrong. It begins with a family of three with there dog getting slaughtered on a deserted road but we flash foward to five college students heading to a party on the same road. They see the accident but think nothing of it as they hear a cop horn in the distance. They end up in a deserted town ala Twilight Zone. The movie gets better as the town is deserted, phones are down, and they cannot find any radio stations. The reeker is a monster that smells, you can tell as the movie gets all wavy when he appears. You really dont see him tell the last half hour or so but he does look quite impressive. One thing I enjoyed is when he kills someone, there life flashes before there eyes in a nice little, unique touch. The ending was a head scratcher, probably rewind it a few times.Overall, cannot recommend this film enough. If you enjoy movies about deserted towns, you'll enjoy this.

But as horror fans know great ideas get done over and over again until they become annoying or just plain stupid. There is never a dull moment whether it was the humor, the tension, good gore scenes, or the character developement. We have five teenagers that are all very different, A blind guy, a skater, a goody too shoes girl, a druggy, and a girl that likes to have fun. They are all interesting characters that can be quite funny. The druggy scream has to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen or the fact that he doesn't believe the blind guy is blind for a long time, so he sends him into the ladies bathroom. I honestly think as a horror fan you have to have a very open mind. Otherwise you miss out on 90% of horror. Not all films can be as perfect as The Exorcist.We start out with a family driving down the highway with the mom and son playing I spy. When the son states he spies something with a D, they slam into a deer in the road. After getting control of the vehicle they pull over to see the damages that occured. When the dog disappears the father goes to look for him. After a few seconds the dog comes back as only half a dog, the bottom half no longer attached. A moment of looking at the dog the mother goes to get up when her husband is standing in front of her with only half a face. The scene is ended with the father getting dragged away. After the family getting decimated we have five teenagers that are on their way to a party. They stop at a resturant to grab some food, then start off on their adventure . When the druggy states that he has enough pills on him to get a hundred people screwed up the girl driving drives him back to the resturant to find another way home. When trying to drive away they find they have run out of gas. Looking to find if someone has some gas they learn that the resturant is now deserted. So they decide to spend the night at the place until someone can find help. Not knowing the terror that awaits them, the five teenagers soon find out that there is something far beyond their comprehension waiting for the right moment to end their existence. Who can survive this unknown presence?I usually never tell that much about a film, but I believe that the first scene in the movie is the best scene. There is also a toilet scene that horror fans will enjoy. There is some originality to Reeker, which makes up for the fact of it taking ideas from other great films. I do recommend this to everyone that can appreciate all horror.",4,Your sense of smell is the last thing that goes before you die.......3 1/2 stars,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,2601,"['Reeker', 'list', 'good', 'horror', 'not', 'genius', 'means', 'yes', 'idea', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'horror', 'fans', 'know', 'great', 'ideas', 'get', 'done', 'over', 'again', 'become', 'annoying', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'was', 'humor', 'tension', 'good', 'gore', 'scenes', 'character', 'developement', 'have', 'five', 'teenagers', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'A', 'blind', 'guy', 'skater', 'goody', 'too', 'shoes', 'girl', 'druggy', 'girl', 'have', 'fun', 'are', 'interesting', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'funny', 'druggy', 'scream', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'fact', ""n't"", 'believe', 'blind', 'guy', 'blind', 'long', 'time', 'ladies', 'bathroom', 'honestly', 'think', 'horror', 'fan', 'have', 'have', 'very', 'open', 'mind', 'Otherwise', 'miss', 'out', '90', '%', 'horror', 'Not', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'perfect', 'Exorcist.We', 'start', 'out', 'family', 'driving', 'down', 'highway', 'mom', 'son', 'playing', 'spy', 'When', 'son', 'something', 'D', 'slam', 'deer', 'road', 'getting', 'control', 'vehicle', 'pull', 'see', 'damages', 'occured', 'When', 'dog', 'father', 'look', 'few', 'dog', 'back', 'only', 'dog', 'bottom', 'half', 'no', 'longer', 'attached', 'moment', 'looking', 'dog', 'mother', 'get', 'up', 'when', 'husband', 'standing', 'front', 'only', 'face', 'scene', 'ended', 'father', 'getting', 'dragged', 'away', 'family', 'getting', 'decimated', 'have', 'five', 'teenagers', 'are', 'way', 'party', 'stop', 'resturant', 'grab', 'food', 'then', 'start', 'off', 'adventure', 'When', 'druggy', 'enough', 'pills', 'get', 'hundred', 'people', 'screwed', 'up', 'girl', 'driving', 'drives', 'back', 'resturant', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'When', 'trying', 'drive', 'away', 'find', 'have', 'run', 'gas', 'Looking', 'find', 'someone', 'gas', 'learn', 'resturant', 'now', 'deserted', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'place', 'someone', 'can', 'find', 'help', 'Not', 'knowing', 'terror', 'five', 'teenagers', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'far', 'comprehension', 'waiting', 'right', 'moment', 'end', 'existence', 'Who', 'can', 'survive', 'unknown', 'presence', 'usually', 'never', 'tell', 'much', 'film', 'believe', 'first', 'scene', 'movie', 'best', 'scene', 'also', 'toilet', 'scene', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'originality', 'Reeker', 'up', 'fact', 'taking', 'ideas', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'do', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'can', 'appreciate', 'horror']",Reeker

""Daniel""","[10, 13]","REEKER is a movie written and directed by Dave Payne who was responsible for, among others,Alien Terminatorin 1996 andJust Can't Get Enough: The True Story of the Chippendales' Murdersin 2001. The plot of this horror film is far from being original : five students, stranded in the Californian desert, are attacked by an unknown entity and must fight it to survive.The good news is that REEKER is not boring at all for several reasons. Firstly, we become soon eager to discover the identity of the bad guy as David Payne disseminates conflicting clues along the road such as the presence in the neighborhood of a drug dealer who's threatened earlier one of the passengers, the eventuality of the presence of a serial killer in the vicinity or the possibility of an hypothetical biochemical disaster. Another strange clue introduced to the confused audience is the alteration or the distortion of the space-time continuum when a murder is about to be committed.The movie's direction is professional, the actors pretty good for this kind of production, and the special effects don't interfere too much with the action.

You've seen these same characters in a million other horror movies, but they really try to ""spice it up"" by throwing a blind guy in the mix - which, once again, is absolutely ridiculous.

While the plot seems to be set up for what could be a decent horror movie, the movie obviously never took itself too seriously by virtue of the extreme gore scenes that were sadly unrealistic to the point of being comical as well as terrible acting in situations where the characters act ridiculous making terrible jokes in what are supposed to life and death situations.There is a twist at the end, but with this twist, ""Reeker"" basically rips off another movie that I will not mention as that will completely give the movie away, not that it would be much of a loss.  Suffice it to say, the other movie did it better although the ending basically makes the movie pointless in my opinion, anyway.Named aptly enough, ""Reeker"" is a real stinker of a movie that is really complete and total waste of time.

I like the idea of this story and I LOVE how the 'Reeker' looks!  I'm not asking for nonstop, total-fast pace and extreme gore, but come on, a creature/killer like  the 'Reeker' needs better/creative ways for killing!  I'm thinking 'Final Destination' style!  The tools it uses seems out of place to me because the 'Reeker' seemed more of a supernatural being to me.  Getting that one guy to jump out the window as a way of killing himself, makes more sense to me.  Again, all of the kills, in my opinion, should of been like that.  Everything else about the 'reeker' creature looked just fine.  After the first few minutes, ( about 5 minutes), into this film, I was excited but 35 minutes after that, the flick just dragged and dragged.  Thank God it picked up with some good 'horror action' in the last 20 to 25 minutes!  Even though I knew what to expect, I still loved the ending.  I'm glad I bought it.

Someone then throws a bucket of fake blood all over the windshield as they show a very poor imitation prop deer fall to the side of the road dead. Now that the mom cannot see anything at all after just hitting an animal does she hit the brakes and pull over? No, she actually speeds up while the son is screaming his a$$ off and attempts to get the `blood' off by using the windshield wipers. Oh btw, the husband is just now waking up (heavy sleeper).After this fast paced opening the movie basically comes to a halt for the next hour. Don't know why the director decided to do this but if it was for character buildup, he was not successful. During the last 30 minutes we start to get some action but some of it is hard to understand. The `reeker' smells really bad when he comes to get you so they show these cheesy wavy lines that show that it does indeed 'reek' in the scene after the bad actors are already impersonating a cough and facial movements to let you know it smells. He seems to float around and actually jump time and space when they show him moving to and from victims, shooting him doesn't work but if you stick him with a shovel that does hurt him. Like I said he seems to float but in another instance he is on the top of the victim's car and by braking he is affected by gravity and falls off the car only to get run over. These are not things that I usually care to much about but I would like some consistency.The ending is graced with a little twist that I actually thought was kind of left up to us to decipher. Were they dead the whole time? Were they in limbo? I dont know but it didn't work.  They did not explain how everyone who was in the movie had died was part of this `dream' but yet there were 2 survivors-how were they in this `dream/limbo'with the dead people?I was expecting a `B' movie of course so I gave it plenty of slack but this is just plain bad. My 11 year old who loves horror said `this is boring' and my 9 year old stated `yea, but it's not as bad as Dracula 3000'.I guess if you are familiar with that movie then  you know where this one ranks!!-do not buy, catch it on cable and that's only if you need to fall asleep.",1,Better than Dracula 3000 and thats not a good thing...........,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,2516,"['**SPOILERS**College', 'age', 'humans', 'way', 'big', 'bash', 'get', 'together', 'road', 'trip', 'end', 'up', 'stuck', 'deserted', 'diner/motel', 'middle', 'desert', 'hard', 'believe', '.This', 'movie', 'out', 'ridicules', 'fashion', 'mom', 'driving', 'husband', 'son', 'driving', 'desert', 'mom', 'deer', 'standing', 'middle', 'road', 'Someone', 'then', 'bucket', 'fake', 'blood', 'windshield', 'show', 'very', 'poor', 'imitation', 'prop', 'deer', 'fall', 'side', 'road', 'dead', 'Now', 'mom', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'just', 'hitting', 'animal', 'hit', 'brakes', 'pull', 'No', 'actually', 'up', 'son', 'screaming', 'attempts', 'get', 'blood', 'off', 'using', 'windshield', 'wipers', 'Oh', 'btw', 'husband', 'just', 'now', 'waking', 'up', 'heavy', 'sleeper', '.After', 'fast', 'paced', 'opening', 'movie', 'basically', 'halt', 'next', 'hour', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'director', 'decided', 'do', 'was', 'character', 'buildup', 'was', 'not', 'successful', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'start', 'get', 'action', 'hard', 'understand', 'reeker', 'smells', 'really', 'bad', 'when', 'get', 'show', 'cheesy', 'wavy', 'lines', 'show', 'indeed', ""'reek"", 'scene', 'bad', 'actors', 'are', 'already', 'impersonating', 'cough', 'facial', 'movements', 'let', 'know', 'float', 'around', 'actually', 'jump', 'time', 'space', 'when', 'show', 'moving', 'victims', 'shooting', ""n't"", 'work', 'stick', 'shovel', 'hurt', 'said', 'float', 'instance', 'top', 'victim', 'car', 'braking', 'affected', 'gravity', 'car', 'only', 'get', 'run', 'over', 'are', 'not', 'things', 'usually', 'care', 'much', 'would', 'like', 'consistency.The', 'ending', 'graced', 'little', 'twist', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'left', 'up', 'decipher', 'Were', 'dead', 'whole', 'time', 'Were', 'limbo', 'dont', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'did', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'died', 'was', 'part', 'dream', 'yet', 'were', '2', 'survivors-how', 'were', ""dream/limbo'with"", 'dead', 'people', 'was', 'expecting', 'B', 'movie', 'course', 'gave', 'plenty', 'slack', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', '11', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'horror', 'said', 'boring', '9', 'year', 'old', 'stated', 'yea', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Dracula', ""3000'.I"", 'guess', 'are', 'familiar', 'movie', 'then', 'know', 'where', 'one', '-do', 'not', 'buy', 'catch', 'cable', 'only', 'need', 'fall', 'asleep']",Reeker

To make matters worse, one of them is being persued by an ostensibly ex-doctor because he stole a bag of drugs from him to take to the party.Reeker is scary and suspenceful and is quite gorey but not gruesome enough as to make you feel sick or look away from the screen.

The begining is scary and makes a good start to the movie because it gives a good impression of what is to come in the main storyline. The ending is a huge twist and it is very clever, it is one of those twists that you will never see coming and its a very intelligent twist because there are no plot holes or mistakes and everything that happens in the movie joins together.The charactors are origional and not the stereotypes you would expect.

1004165,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000GH3CMA,Only-A-Child,"[0, 0]","""Reeker"" is decently executed with excellent production design, and good editing;  with competent special effects about midway between those in ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Silent Hill"",  two films with much the same premise.  That it is not in the same league as those two efforts is that the script (or pre-production in general) does not begin to measure up.  You can fault the casting and the acting-for-the-camera direction but the real problem is the lack of enough brainpower to incorporate an actual point-of-view into the storytelling.  With that element missing it simply fails to engage the viewer and pull them into the story.Caution Spoilers Ahead:  Like a lot of third rate horror genre scripts ""Reeker"" is unable to effectively plant the clues that would make its ""Sixth Sense""  ending an effective surprise,  with viewers looking back at how cleverly the pieces fit together.  The storytelling challenge is to plant clues but not give away too much.  Great writers are able to do this with misdirection and other creative devices.  Everyone else does it by simple confusion,  telling the story so poorly that viewers have nothing to logically process.  Which leaves most viewers staring at the closing credits and going WTF as they strain their brain cells for any sort of coherent explanation.  So if you are confused, here is my interpretation of the basic premise - which may help you sort out a story from the jumble of poorly told plot elements:The underlying premise is that some events (accidents) happen so quickly that those involved don't realize what has happened to them (much like how you felt after watching this film).  If they died or are to die, they travel into a limbo parallel to the real world, but it is sparsely populated, slightly off-kilter, and time is fractured (what is a long time in this limbo may only be a brief moment in the real world). The title character is a grim reaper (Reeker) who then stalks and kills them,  which is necessary for them to pass on.  The assortment of ancillary characters popping up in flashbacks or hallucinations throughout the film are glimpses of the earlier accident victims (such as the family in the opening scene) whom the Reeker has already killed.Then again, what do I know?

In fact, I'd have to say it stands head and shoulders above everything else. I mean, when your big twist at the end of the movie explains everything...except for the first scene...someone obviously wasn't paying attention.Story: a bunch of kids are going to a big music festival out in the desert (think Burning Man here). After a stop at a diner, they discover that one of their number, Trip (All In's Scott Whyte), is carrying about twenty thousand dollars' worth of stolen drugs. Gretchen (The Quarry's Tina Illman), who's driving, stops and orders Trip out of the car. When Trip can't get a signal in the desert, she agrees to drive him back to the diner to use their pay phone. When they get back, though, the diner and accompanying motel are deserted. Except, that is, for whatever it is that did very, very bad things to the family in the first scene. (It took me reading the message board to understand what that all had to do with the rest of the flick. I have to say that in general, I don't miss that sort of thing, and usually I'm the person doing the explaining. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm thinking if I didn't put the pieces together until getting outside help, most others won't either.)As with most recent no-budget schlockfests like this one, you can count on all the basic, and clich&eacute;d, things that are supposed to make you jump. You can count on a couple of scenes of supposed levity. You can count on pedestrian camerawork, competent direction at best, and terrible acting. Reeker delivers on all counts, including having one of the dumbest names I've ever seen on a horror film.

They then find themselves hunted down by a maniacal killer. Sounds like the plot of about hundred horror films except Reeker takes this tired plot and twists it into something surprisingly fresh and original. First, the leader of the group is a strong female lead, Gretchen (Tina Illman). Second, there are no gratuitous sex scenes or nudity in Reeker. The female characters Gretchen and Cookie are attractive but their not your typical horror movie dumb blondes. Even the male roles are nonconforming...the men aren't brawny jocks but regular guys who are just as terrified as the women are. One of them, Jack (Devon Gummersall) is even blind and has to rely on Gretchen to lead him about.The five get stranded at a roadside diner/motel with not another person in site. The phones are dead and they can get only static on the radios. You start to wonder if this is some sort of an extraterrestrial phenomena. Reeker holds its cards extremely tight! The first hint of a threat is the smell of death that comes in waves of nauseous vapors that end in a character being shredded by a whirling blade. Finally an RV pulls into the diner. Henry (Michael Ironside) is looking for his wife who has been missing since morning. Henry seems to know more than he is letting on, however and the rest of the group are happy to let him stay locked in his RV. Reeker is a film that leads you in one direction, making you think you know exactly what is going on, and then pulls the rug out from under you and says, ""Got Ya!"" Without providing any spoilers, it's a film where you really need to pay attention to all the little details that you thought were not important. The hints are there if you look for them.While the cast members are not household names (except perhaps for the fine character actor, Ironside) they are an experienced group with a lot of acting credits. Eric Mabius was in the first Resident Evil film and since has had numerous TV credits, most recently a recurring role in Ugly Betty. Gummersall as Jack presents a unique horror film male lead, a blind man who provides a calming influence on the rest of the terrified group.It's not a terribly gory film but it uses the gore effectively, more for shock than for the sake of it. These scenes are meant to unsettle the viewer as opposed to merely spilling buckets of blood. In one part, Nelson finds a man yelling for help from inside a trash dumpster. He helps the old man out only to find that the man's body as seen severed at the waist and he merely goes crawling off on his hands as fast as he can.Reeker is a solid, original horror film that will have you asking questions and re-watching it over just so you get the full effect of what is going on.

For most of this movie, I was unimpressed, thinking that it wasn't bad enough to turn off, but wasn't good enough to ever see again. I decided to finish it and that's when I got hit with one of the best endings I have seen in any horror film ever! I never even had a clue that it was coming. It tied up all the loose ends and weird things that I had just associated with it being a B-movie. Like I said, the acting is nothing special, the story is nothing different, and for the most part this film is ""OK"", but that ending, I just can't get it out of my mind, it really makes this one worth seeing.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,738,"['majority', 'film', 'typical', 'basic', 'B-horror', 'movie', 'formula', 'lots', 'gore', 'good', 'looking', 'people', 'very', 'bad', 'acting', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'thinking', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'turn', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'enough', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'decided', 'finish', 'when', 'got', 'hit', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'have', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'ever', 'never', 'even', 'had', 'clue', 'was', 'coming', 'tied', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'weird', 'things', 'had', 'just', 'associated', 'being', 'B-movie', 'said', 'acting', 'nothing', 'special', 'story', 'nothing', 'different', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'OK', 'ending', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'mind', 'really', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing']",Reeker
1004173,A31BDEUO4D8X6W,B000GH3CMA,wade,"[0, 1]","i really liked this somewhat weird horror movie, with the storyline and filming. it is about 2 sexy chicks and 4 guys who go on a trip in the desert and break down at an abandoned motel. we have a tough as nails brunette, a cute sexy but silly blond chick, a blind guy with incredible senses, a drug addict guy, and a macho hitchhiker dude. they decide to spend the night at the motel but there are no telephones, television, or phone reception. there is however a very evil but unexplained invisible but foul smelling demon who appears out of nowhere. the blind guy can sense this evil presence but nobody else can until it is too late. there are several unexplained scenes of deformed people that first appear then disappear. i wonder if there is more to this film explaining the reason these people are disfigured and tortured. the overall mood of this film was quite dreary and foreboding. A make out scene between the hunk guy and sexy blond was great but could have shown just a tad more sexiness and nudity. a scene of the blond going to the outside privy half dressed was a little erotically charged but it is never shown what eventually happens to her when she is pulled down in the privy. overall this was a creepy somewhat scary film where all the characters meet their demise. just wish that a little more story would explain the evil presence and how or what brought it about. great horror movie for guys and gals",5,a unique but bizarre horror movie,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,1426,"['i', 'really', 'liked', 'somewhat', 'weird', 'horror', 'movie', 'storyline', 'filming', '2', 'sexy', 'chicks', '4', 'guys', 'who', 'go', 'trip', 'desert', 'break', 'down', 'abandoned', 'motel', 'have', 'tough', 'nails', 'brunette', 'cute', 'sexy', 'silly', 'blond', 'chick', 'blind', 'guy', 'incredible', 'senses', 'drug', 'addict', 'guy', 'macho', 'hitchhiker', 'dude', 'decide', 'spend', 'night', 'motel', 'are', 'telephones', 'television', 'phone', 'reception', 'however', 'very', 'evil', 'unexplained', 'invisible', 'foul', 'smelling', 'demon', 'who', 'nowhere', 'blind', 'guy', 'can', 'sense', 'evil', 'presence', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'too', 'late', 'are', 'several', 'unexplained', 'scenes', 'deformed', 'people', 'first', 'appear', 'then', 'disappear', 'i', 'wonder', 'more', 'film', 'explaining', 'reason', 'people', 'are', 'disfigured', 'tortured', 'overall', 'mood', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'dreary', 'foreboding', 'make', 'out', 'scene', 'hunk', 'guy', 'sexy', 'blond', 'was', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'sexiness', 'nudity', 'scene', 'blond', 'going', 'outside', 'privy', 'half', 'dressed', 'was', 'little', 'erotically', 'charged', 'never', 'shown', 'what', 'eventually', 'when', 'pulled', 'down', 'privy', 'overall', 'was', 'creepy', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'meet', 'demise', 'just', 'wish', 'little', 'more', 'story', 'would', 'explain', 'evil', 'presence', 'how', 'what', 'brought', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'guys', 'gals']",Reeker
1004174,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B000GH3CMA,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[8, 11]","I'm not the biggest fan of the teenie slasher genre. But I like the idea every now and then to just send a bunch of teenies somewhere dangerous just to see what happens and where the danger comes from. When I began watching reeker I had absolutly no idea what to expect, which is - especially with horror movies - always the better starting point.Reeker begins like any other teenie horror movie: the introduction shows us something evil going on somewhere (think the dog in cabin fever, the workers in creep etc.), then the title and then the teenies appear, hot for a trip to ""somewhere"". It's the same thing here, but I definetly prefer this movie in comparison to many other, modern teenie horror films. For one: this one is scary for sure, and that also on a psychological level because the actors are good, making you really care for the characters they play. (especially the disco-retro-guy was great, even in the making-of: ""Anyway he dies on page 67.""). Two: it's a gory, but not all too brutal film. A miracle to me how reeker got m-rated, but creep didn't (creep is four times more brutal). I think it's more important to make a death scary instead of just brutal. Three: there's a story here, folks. Wouldn't call it SO INTELLIGENT, but it's got more to it than just teenies being chased. The conclusion is pretty cool, especially when you begin thinking about the details and how they made it all fit together, even they way people die. Still, there's some unexplained stuff here, which is good. You can see a connection between all things and draw some sort of explanation out of this.Unpredictable, fun, scary, and sometimes a bit dumb, when you imagine that they sometimes see strange things they logically should warn their friends of but don't even mention a word about it. A bit of a repetion of ""Hey man you okay what did you see?"" - ""uhm... nothing."" (instead of ""I just killed a guy with no lower parts."") Thinking of it, this happens several times. Maybe they think they're hallucinating so they don't dare to tell the others. The only ""illogical"" thing that can be funny even.Ah did I tell you about the film's content anyway? Oh it's about these teenagers on a road trip to a rave party in the deserts. One has E-pills that he'd stolen from a friend. This friend had this recorded on film and later was on the road to the same party, warning his friend that if he doesn't give him the pills back, he will go after him for sure. When the driver lady gets informed about the pills, she decides not to take the owner any further, instead she would bring him to the restaurant they had just visited some miles ago. When they get back there they realize that in the meantime everybody had gone, leaving all the food behind. The car is broken, there's no gas, so they're stuck out there. It's a bit like with IDENTITY, only that they are more friendly to each other here. Great they didn't use the clichee of everybody thinking against everybody again. When one of them tries to get help he finds an older man in a truck (M. Ironside) who is searching his wife since morning. He seems strange and dangerous at first, but in the end he's just as lost as the others, looking for answers and help. The drug dealer also is appearing every now and then somewhere, but he's worked out very well as you don't know if he's part of the danger or if he's in danger himself, he's acting very strangely which follows suit to the whole film.Watch this film for sure.
