807454,ASB7N755S4EVJ,B0001IN08U,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This DVD is much better than the 25th Anniversary one.  I loved the vintage shorts.  Sony wonder and Sesame Street wonder should bring out a DVD with classic shorts for the adult fans of the show who would love to walk down memory lane.  I love the Music works wonders  in the ""for parents"" section, but my daughter has yet to warm up to it. It's great to see Gaby and Miles but I miss Snuffy, doesn't he have a song too?  I've seen Bert's doing the pigeon so many times that I can't stand it.  It's on at least 3 of my sesame street dvd's already. Most of the cast isn't there for a grand finale like on the 25th Anniversary edition. Another problem I have is  with the package.  I love that it's a book and my daughter loves to watch the pictures and flip the pages.  However the DVD often slips out  as the case doesn't close properly.  Next time I would like to have the dvd in a secure non-slip case and a nice lyric book for the kids to use.Update 2010I recently purchased another copy of this dvd for my daughter because I wanted the Music Makes Wonders bonus feature.  However when I did purchase the new dvd, I couldn't find that feature on the disc.  The bonus section only has the trivia, cast interview and bonus shorts.  Come on, if you do something, do it right.  I now have to search for the older edition dvd which I originally had.  I am so disapointed in this product.",4,A pretty good buy.,1112572800,"04 4, 2005",2005,1386,"['DVD', 'much', 'better', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'one', 'loved', 'vintage', 'shorts', 'Sony', 'wonder', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'wonder', 'should', 'bring', 'out', 'DVD', 'classic', 'shorts', 'adult', 'fans', 'show', 'who', 'would', 'love', 'walk', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'love', 'Music', 'wonders', 'parents', 'section', 'daughter', 'yet', 'warm', 'up', 'great', 'see', 'Gaby', 'Miles', 'miss', 'Snuffy', ""n't"", 'have', 'song', 'too', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bert', 'doing', 'pigeon', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'least', '3', 'sesame', 'street', 'dvd', 'already', 'Most', 'cast', ""n't"", 'grand', 'finale', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'edition', 'problem', 'have', 'package', 'love', 'book', 'daughter', 'watch', 'pictures', 'flip', 'pages', 'However', 'DVD', 'often', 'out', 'case', ""n't"", 'close', 'properly', 'Next', 'time', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'dvd', 'secure', 'non-slip', 'case', 'nice', 'lyric', 'book', 'kids', 'use.Update', '2010I', 'recently', 'purchased', 'copy', 'dvd', 'daughter', 'wanted', 'Music', 'Makes', 'Wonders', 'bonus', 'feature', 'However', 'when', 'did', 'purchase', 'new', 'dvd', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'feature', 'disc', 'bonus', 'section', 'only', 'trivia', 'cast', 'interview', 'bonus', 'shorts', 'Come', 'do', 'something', 'do', 'right', 'now', 'have', 'search', 'older', 'edition', 'dvd', 'originally', 'had', 'am', 'so', 'disapointed', 'product']",SST: What's the Name of That Song?

She never gets tired of the songs and the characters. After seeing everyone singing different songs, Super Grover is on a mission to find the one song that will unite the world and so he finds Elmo and Big Bird and they go on a mission to find that one song that everybody can sing. There are so many different types of songs in this DVD from Jazz, rock, opera and r&b to even rap. They are all educational and put a light fun twist on learning and introducing young ones to different types of music. My daughter loves Patti Labelle, loves Denyce Graves and even Queen Latifah. I would recommend this DVD all over again. The skits are funny (numbers vs letters) and Super Grover, Big Bird and even Oscar (yes Oscar) are all hilarious!! Plus it has a eyeful of celebrities....

Hays,"[42, 43]","Although, like other Sesame Street made-for-sale products, the storyline is a little weak (Super Grover looks for the Song Everyone Can Sing,) this DVD is still great fun.  It's mostly comprised of song clips from the show, including a montage of ""Sing,""  Wayne Brady singing ""Between"" from the 2003 season, ""Operatic Lullaby"" with Denyce Graves, ""Soul Alphabet"" with Patti LaBelle, ""The Letter O"" with Queen Latifah, and ""Everybody's Song"" with Diana Krall.  Muppet clips include ""Do de Rubber Duck,"" ""Doin the Pidgeon,"" ""Eight Balls of Fur,"" and ""You Made Me Love You"" with Cookie Monster.Performances on this DVD are terrific: it's great to see SuperGrover crashing his way through the screen again.  If not for the credits, you'd never know Frank Oz isn't a performer -  Cookie and Grover are rock-solid, just like I remember them!  They could have skipped the letters/numbers homage to West Side Story, but otherwise, it's great to see Oscar and Big Bird interact with Elmo and SuperGrover,The extras on this DVD really made it worth buying for this vintage Sesame Street fan, though:  There are four vintage clips in their entirety: ""ABC-DEF-GHI,"" ""I Like You,"" ""Captain Vegetable,"" and, best of all, a montage of the ""Pinball Number Count""(same as the song on the 35th anniversary CD.)
