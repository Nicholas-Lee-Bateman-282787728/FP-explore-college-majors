1495638,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B005NHZAOQ,Amit Talpade,"[0, 0]",The final film from Alan Corneau takes place in the board room of a Parisian headquarters of a multinational. This is about a cruel executive Christine ( Kristin Scott Thomas) who is evil and plays with peoples lives by using them to her advantage. She is enthralled by Isabelle (Ludvine Sagnier) who appears to be weak.  However Isabelle is not easily manipulated because beneath that veneer lies a person that is equally malicious. The film is strictly a game of chess between the two women until Cristine makes a false move that sends Isabelle over the edge.The movie has a surprising turn half way but patience is rewarded. Just as in a good detective tale there are a couple of red herrings but this is a decent watch.,3,Engaging at times,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,723,"['final', 'film', 'Alan', 'Corneau', 'place', 'board', 'room', 'Parisian', 'headquarters', 'multinational', 'cruel', 'executive', 'Christine', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'who', 'evil', 'peoples', 'lives', 'using', 'advantage', 'enthralled', 'Isabelle', 'Ludvine', 'Sagnier', 'who', 'be', 'weak', 'However', 'Isabelle', 'not', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'beneath', 'veneer', 'person', 'equally', 'malicious', 'film', 'strictly', 'game', 'chess', 'two', 'women', 'Cristine', 'false', 'move', 'Isabelle', 'edge.The', 'movie', 'surprising', 'turn', 'half', 'way', 'patience', 'rewarded', 'Just', 'good', 'detective', 'tale', 'are', 'couple', 'red', 'herrings', 'decent', 'watch']",Love Crime

Whether it's Kristin Scott Thomas' delicious take on corporate villainy or the absurd proposition of Ludivine Sagnier (known simply as 'The Body' in France) as a frumpy, repressed workaholic brainiac, this movie - meant as a taut thriller - is equally enjoyable for delighting in the juicy turns of its two stars.  They are clearly enjoying themselves with this material.  In turn, so did I.The thriller hidden inside here is a pretty cool one.  Tough to say much about it without getting into spoiler alert territory but, suffice to say, Sagnier's Isabelle is one smart cookie.I love the way writers Alain Corneau (who also directed) and Natalie Carter talk about business.  We never really find out what Barney & Johnson (the company Isabelle and Christine - Thomas' character - work for) does, but there are enough plausible meetings, proposals, outcomes, trips and deals that it doesn't really matter.  It's the business of business that Corneau and Carter give us, rather than a specific business.  I really like the way that all played out.

More than half the movie seemed to be covering up a crime.  When you have a film as amazing as Basic Instinct where the entire movie was engrossing this is ""slow kill"" and almost all cover up.  The two main woman were great in their roles and I would have liked to see one not simply kill the other but instead develop in what appeared originally to be their strange & twisted ""friendship"".

1495642,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,B005NHZAOQ,"cs211 ""cs211""","[0, 0]","I thoroughly enjoyed Love Crime.  It provides an intriguing look at the game of office politics as played by the top executives of the Paris office of a multinational firm.  It is intricately plotted, with a storyline that starts out simple but is actually much more complex than the viewer originally thinks.  Ludivine Sagnier is, as always, a pleasure for the eyes to behold, and she gives a very credible performance in one of the lead roles.  And for American viewers such as myself the film provides a glimpse into the culture of the French business world, although it is probably no more representative of reality than the film ""Wall Street"".  But at the very least you get to see what high-end office space in Paris' modern business district looks like.Because the plot is so important to the overall impact of the movie, I won't mention any details about it.  Once the storyline unfolds completely, the plot makes complete sense and helps to illustrate the actual power relationships between the characters.  If Love Crime has some lessons to teach, it is that the most ruthless person can indeed rise to the top, but only for a while, and only to be replaced by someone even more ruthless.  The cycle will repeat, because that is the nature of the beast.  There is no way to know how applicable this lesson is to the real world of business as practiced in France, but it does make for a very interesting two hour movie.Ludivine Sagnier gives a strong performance, as does her co-star, Kristin Scott Thomas.  Some of the supporting acting seems a bit stiff.  Kudos to the screenwriter Nathalie Carter, who came up with the delicious plot.  My only complaint about the plot is a very minor one: the headquarters for the multinational company was given as Washington, D.C., although the firm also has a New York office.  Multinational firms with U.S. headquarters are much more likely to be headquartered in New York and not the nation's capital, which is different than France (Paris), the U.K. (London) or Germany (Berlin).  But perhaps the headquarters was purposely placed in Washington D.C. to emphasize the importance of politics in this particular company.See Love Crime if you like French cinema and might be interested in a movie for adults about office politics.",4,French office politics played at the highest level,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2278,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Love', 'Crime', 'intriguing', 'look', 'game', 'office', 'politics', 'played', 'top', 'executives', 'Paris', 'office', 'multinational', 'firm', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'storyline', 'out', 'simple', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'viewer', 'originally', 'Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'always', 'pleasure', 'eyes', 'behold', 'very', 'credible', 'performance', 'one', 'lead', 'roles', 'American', 'viewers', 'such', 'film', 'glimpse', 'culture', 'French', 'business', 'world', 'probably', 'more', 'representative', 'reality', 'film', 'Wall', 'Street', 'very', 'least', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'high-end', 'office', 'space', 'Paris', 'modern', 'business', 'district', 'plot', 'so', 'important', 'overall', 'impact', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'details', 'storyline', 'completely', 'plot', 'complete', 'sense', 'illustrate', 'actual', 'power', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Love', 'Crime', 'lessons', 'teach', 'most', 'ruthless', 'person', 'can', 'indeed', 'rise', 'top', 'only', 'while', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'someone', 'even', 'more', 'ruthless', 'cycle', 'will', 'repeat', 'nature', 'beast', 'way', 'know', 'how', 'applicable', 'lesson', 'real', 'world', 'business', 'practiced', 'France', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'two', 'hour', 'movie.Ludivine', 'Sagnier', 'strong', 'performance', 'co-star', 'Kristin', 'Scott', 'Thomas', 'supporting', 'acting', 'bit', 'stiff', 'Kudos', 'screenwriter', 'Nathalie', 'Carter', 'who', 'came', 'up', 'delicious', 'plot', 'only', 'complaint', 'plot', 'very', 'minor', 'one', 'headquarters', 'multinational', 'company', 'was', 'given', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'firm', 'also', 'New', 'York', 'office', 'Multinational', 'firms', 'U.S.', 'headquarters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'headquartered', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'nation', 'capital', 'different', 'France', 'Paris', 'U.K.', 'London', 'Germany', 'Berlin', 'perhaps', 'headquarters', 'was', 'purposely', 'placed', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'emphasize', 'importance', 'politics', 'particular', 'company.See', 'Love', 'Crime', 'like', 'French', 'cinema', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'movie', 'adults', 'office', 'politics']",Love Crime
1495643,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B005NHZAOQ,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[22, 23]","Love Crime is a film about people trying to control each other.This was a movie of small details. During the opening montage, it becomes clear there is some kind of underlying intimate relationship between Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier) and Christine (Kristen Scott Thomas). In the first cuts, it becomes clear Christine is the boss and Isabelle is a colleague or subordinate. As the work session in Christine's house progresses, each advances toward the other. It's a slow intimate tender dance. The sharp contrast though, they both use vous, the formal you in French. There's no equivalent in English, but that layer adds to the clear distance and formality Isabelle feels. In fact until about three quarters of the way through the film, Isabelle uses vous with everybody - except for a critical plot moment where she uses the familiar tu with her doctor. At just the moment when it seems like something will happen between them, in bursts Philippe. He and Christine attack each other like animals. Cut away to Christine lying bored in bed with Philippe pounding away on top of her. Ultimately this is contrasted to Isabelle lying perfectly straight in her bed.This film twists and turns a few directions. The story climaxes just past halfway and it then becomes a mystery of why people are doing what they do. The ending is somewhat of a surprise.There are a few moments where I had to suspend belief, just go along with the movie. It is true; the kind of advances a boss made to her employee isn't tolerated at work. However, it isn't too hard to imagine that this is some kind of cutthroat business where people do whatever it takes to get ahead. Christine is young and ambitious; it isn't too hard to imagine her doing some of these things. Americans were portrayed as not being very bright, or at least they were the bull in the china shop in a very formal business. The police couldn't possibly be that stupid, they do not come off as particularly good at solving a crime. The French criminal system may have been portrayed accurately. To American eyes, I would hate to be accused of a crime in France, the police and the judge seemed to arrive at a conviction incredibly quickly. Due process appears to be non-existent, or they have their version of due process.The director, Alain Corneau, uses the frame surprisingly well. Shots that appear too wide frequently have a small detail that is important. The pacing of the film is pretty good. There is a very difficult moment at exactly halfway through the film. I found myself wondering when the story would take off, change direction, and deliver the dramatic conflict. It took a good fifteen minutes before that happened. The black and white flashback scenes were almost too much. Corneau went just over the fine line of showing too much detail and not enough in those flashbacks.Kristen Scott Thomas is perfectly cast. She can be nasty mean, sexy, then sweet all in a few minutes. She is a beautiful British actress that has a perfect French accent (yes she moved to France when she was 19, but there are so many people that carry their original accent as a badge). Thomas has a long filmography both in French and English. She was particularly good in I've Loved You So Long (I've Loved You So Long). Ludivine Sagnier was an interesting choice. Her range was amazing, at times she looked incredibly beautiful and others she just looked like that insane person on the street corner homeless person. Sagnier was the out of control daughter in Swimming Pool (Swimming Pool (Unrated Version)). She was also in the unfortunately awful Love Songs (Love Songs). The supporting cast was there to do exactly that, support these two as the story revolved entirely around them.The film is not rated. It's difficult to decide what rating this film would get, possibly near an R rating. There were several bedroom scenes, but everything was covered up (oh there was a very brief flash of Kristen Scott Thomas' breast). On the other hand, what people were doing in those bedroom scenes was pretty clear, not much was left to the imagination. What strong language was said in French was never translated (the f bomb was thrown a few times in French but they chose to use other words). Frankly the big dramatic moment, much worse is shown on television. Yes, this film would get an R rating, there is a moment where somebody is shown using cocaine. This is a film that deals with a mature subject. Honestly, a mature younger viewer would not have a lot of trouble with this film.The movie is presented in French with English subtitles. The French translation is not great. This was a hard film to translate since the use of vous and tu (formal and familiar) were important to the plot, both words translate to one word, you. There were a number of times where the subtitle wasn't exactly what was said. The DVD has no bonus features, only a set of trailers. This is an IFC / Sundance film, so the trailers were very good.Love Crime isn't for everybody. It is very French and has a number of twists and turns in the mystery. It is an intimate film about psychological control. I enjoyed the details the director carefully placed in this film. I smiled at the end, more of an ironic smile than a funny smile.",4,Control,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,5249,"['Love', 'Crime', 'film', 'people', 'trying', 'control', 'other.This', 'was', 'movie',

1495645,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005NHZAOQ,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Alain Corneau wrote (with Nathalie Carter) and directed this little French thriller about the extremes to which people will go to maintain their goals - and the spatter of mess they leave behind on everyone who comes into contact with them.  Despite a fine cast of actors this story is one in which the audience simply doesn't care about anyone involved.  Bad things happen to bad people, and that concept is taken to extremes.Christine (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a wealthy corporate executive in Paris who makes international deals through her brainy cunning. Her prot&eacute;g&eacute; is the equally bright but less world-wise Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier).  At times it appears that Christine wants to be in a relationship with Isabelle but at the same time Christine has a lover Philippe (Patrick Mille) who works for her and who incidentally is also sleeping with Isabelle. Games are played; Christine takes credit for Isabelle's ideas in a manipulative way to gain a position in the US.  Two tigers cannot in the same environment survive and Isabelle carefully plots the murder of Christine: we see Isabelle stabbing Christine to death. After the murder Isabelle, in an apparent drugged state, confesses to the murder and is sent to jail.  But the story is far from over as Isabelle's brilliant and now criminal mind knows how to manipulate this predicament as well as Christine would have had the tables been turned.Despite the fact that both Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier are both extraordinarily beautiful women and superb actors, neither is a character with whom we can empathize much less care.  Yes the plot is a brilliant Hitchcock type story and the film, though it drags in many places, is very well made.  But in the end we are left in an emotional vacuum. Where is the love of the title?

Kristin Scott Thomas shows her fluency in French as the head of a Paris company that is a division of an American based conglomerate that works in agricultural supplements (as near as I could determine).  Her right hand ""man"" is also a woman.  Younger, but smart, energetic, determined and motivated, Isabelle (Ludivine Sagnier) is also a bit nave, shy and not quite up to the social aspects of corporate leadership.Christine decides to mentor Isabelle to replace her as she has her eyes on a senior position in New York.  Christine (Scott Thomas) sends Isabelle on a trip to Egypt to make a presentation that Isabelle had developed.  She even sends her boy toy Philippe (Patrick Mille) along for moral support knowing that it would lead to more.  When Isabelle closes the deal, Christine takes all the credit in a conference call with her American bosses.  Isabelle is pissed and decides to pursue another assignment without Christine's knowledge.This time Isabelle gets the credit in a presentation to the Americans.  They are excited about Isabelle's future, but now Christine is pissed, really pissed.  As Christine's promotion is put on hold she does everything she can to sabotage Isabelle's future including using Philippe with whom Isabelle has now fallen in love. This plot point never made much sense as we are never led to believe that union was about anything more than sex.Aided by information provided by an assistant (Guillaume Marquet), Isabelle concocts an elaborate plot to get rid of Christine and frame her former lover.  This subterfuge is the heart of the movie.  Without giving away too much, the idea of everything isn't always what it seems is the crux of the mystery.  There are no good guys here and no one to cheer for.  But it is fun from the aspect of trying to figure out what Isabelle is up to.

The fact that this was the last movie directed by damed French director Alain Corneau before he passed away, only added to the lure.""Love Crime"" (2010 release from France; 106 min.; original title ""Crime d'Amour"") brings the story of Christine (played by Scott Thomas) as the ruthless local (i.e. Paris) CEO of a global marketing firm headquartered in Washington, DC. Christine is on a fast track towards a top position in the firm's New York office, as a result of some great marketing successes which in fact were developed by Christine's right hand woman, Isabelle (played by Ludivine Sagnier).

The tale of a modern businesswoman wrapped up in jealousy and skullduggery office politics.Kristin Scott Thomas, plays Christine, the boss, who steps on the coattails of her underlings. We are told at one point that the last young woman to work with Christine is now in a mental institution. Christine has taken on a new young woman, Isabelle, played by Ludivine Sagnier. Christine has latched on to her because she is brilliant, and because Christine thinks she is naive and easily intimidated. The place is Paris, and the countryside and city, is, of course, beautiful. These are high stakes, and, at one point, Christine sends Isabelle to Cairo to represent the company. She also sends her lover, Phillipe to Cairo. Whether Christine has planned that Phillipe will seduce Isabella is not clear, but that does indeed occur. And, now, Isabella is in love. This presents a conundrum, just at the point when Isabella discovers that Christine is taking all the credit for their recent business coup. Christine is quite open about how she operates with Isabella, and tells her this is how all businesses operate. In many ways, Christine is trying to seduce Isabella. And, then, a startingly event occurs that puts Isabella in the spotlight, and she has to account for her actions. How Isabella moves through this time is extraordinary. Isabella is quite clever and her intelligence and foresight is quite evident.Alain Corneau, has given us a modern day mystery with many plots and turns. Once we think we understand, we are then turned upside down with a great splash. This film is well written and acted, the characters completley believable. Some of the events are so clever, that we wonder about the persons involved. Are they OK, or is this some fiendish one time event.

I just don't get it.  A country with as much ""culture"" and history as France has, you would think would be up there creating great films filled with action and drama.  But none such is the case.  I'm not sure whether it's because they've lost nearly every war they've fought, or because the last Concorde when down in flames in their nation, or the fact that even though they were one of the first to make the net public but failed to progress their nation's internet any further during the 80s, it just seems like the French and their advancements always get stymied.
