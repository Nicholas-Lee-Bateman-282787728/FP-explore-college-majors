(Be sure to look for a young, but tough-taking, Angela Lansbury, and a youthful and very beautiful Cyd Charisse in prominent roles.)Don't look for deep meaning in any of these four; that's not what most of the Hollywood musicals were about.  But, oh, the music is so wonderful you'll find yourself humming the tunes for days after watching any or all of these.&#34;Summer Stock&#34; is the weakest of the 4 and always makes me a little sad even with the terrific songs.  That's because this is her last movie under contract to MGM and reminds me of the shoddy way the studio treated Garland after it had made millions from her performances for so many years.Still, the stars, the music and the dances take you back to a time when life seemed simpler and more full of promise.Buy this film collection.

No one ever did it like Judy Garland and there have been many fine actresses along the way...all supremely talented...but the Garland legend is not just legend...it is fact.  She remains the best of the best and her musicals have a touch of genius added to them...they are magic and the magic is Judy Garland. No matter who her co-star was and no matter what the premise of the film...the Garland films are as golden as she was.  Every bit of celluloid proves the absolute foresight and genius stroke of why the studio chose her talents over those of Deanna Durbin at the time.  In the studio that boasted more stars than there are in the heavens...surely hers was the highest and brightest of them all. This collection is just a sampling of a talent so rare that it makes one wish for more and more and more.

1607471,A1XDN8H4MZK2TT,B00AATGDY8,Lorenzo,"[0, 0]","Gudy Garland really was a fantastic, very talented actress. The stories in the movies are ones that are good for families. At a time when American education is stultifying this generation, movies like this enrich our culture. They promote values of hard work and treating people with respect. Young people would benefit greatly by seeing older movies like these. They have great talent and stories that might wake up young people and get them off texting, cell phone addiction, and Face book. As someone who has taught for 35 years, these types of films are great investments for family life. Keep your kids at home, teach them yourself, because public education has been reduced to indoctrination into political correctness. Even your grandmother could do a better job. She would take they kids to the library and made shure they learned something. Whereas, many schools pass out work, students copy, can't pass the tests. Then, they are given tests for learning disabilities. Of course they find them. Why would they not find them, since no effort at teaching is being made. Teachers are clerks, tools of the state. Students are forced to practice for state tests, but never to think. So you have school with 10-30% of students with learning disabilities.Their solution for the common ADD disability are drugs: now you have real zombies, not just in the movies. Keep your kids at home, get some good movies and materials.
