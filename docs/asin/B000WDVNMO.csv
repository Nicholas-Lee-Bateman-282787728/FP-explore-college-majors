Diego is also gay, but closeted from his family, and dating the even further closeted Pablo, a status-seeking realtor.  When Diego is inadvertently ""outed"" by his aunt, Pablo decides he has to avoid him, and begins dating the aunt, pronouncing his secret affair with Diego as ""just a phase."" Meanwhile, Diego meets a gringo couple who moved in across the street, among the many gays who settled in the area to ""turn it around"", angering many of the current Latino residents.  One half of the couple, Wesley, takes an immediate liking to Diego, which sets his partner, Jonathan, into a jealous hissy-fit. Diego's grandmother returns from a month-long trip to Mexico, to find her restaurant being boycotted by homophobic locals, while her daughter is making wedding plans with her grandson's former male lover!It is a refreshing and highly amusing romantic comedy, presented by a talented cast of mostly newcomers.  With a pollished look that belies its relative low budget, it's a noteworthy first-time writer/director credit for Carlos Portugal, one that received audience awards at several gay movie festivals.  It is sexy without being overt, funny without being cartoonish or stereotypical, and the emotions portrayed can be related to by anyone, gay or straight.

The quality of acting is so so at best (and mostly uneven) and it is the story that either saves or kills the effort. ""East Side Story"" fortunately has a plot which should keep the viewers (gay viewers most likely) interested.Diego works in a family restaurant owned by his grand-mother Sara. He is gay but he believes that nobody knows about it except his closeted lover Pablo. He is obviously wrong. His affair with Pablo goes sour when he refuses to continue playing his friend's erotic games. Fortunately, his neighbourhood begins to change and as a part of the change a gay couple moves next door.Pablo makes an attempt to turn straight and marry Diego's crazy aunt Bianca/Blanca but Diego stops her short of taking the vows. In the meantime Diego starts falling for his neighbour Wes but Wes moved in with his BF Jon who only dreams of leaving the barrio and cashing in on the price increase (remember, it's 2006!).

1108818,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000WDVNMO,Grady Harp,"[22, 23]","Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written (Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo), well directed (Carlos Portugal) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community.  Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience. With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion.Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos (a fine debut by Ren&eacute; Alvarado) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's (elegant Irene DeBari) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio (Luis Accinelli) presides in the kitchen.  Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded.  Diego's campy Aunt Bianca (Gladise Jimenez) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen.  Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales (David Ber&oacute;n) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego, claiming that the union is a 'passing fancy'.  When Bianca enters, Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted.Into this m&eacute;lange enters a white gay couple who buy a 'flip' house across the street, a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner.  The couple - Wesley (Steve Callahan) and Jonathan (Cory Schneider) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley.  Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit.  The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance  that is encouraged by Diego's family.  How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line.  It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the 'outing' that make the film so personal and successful.Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch, as are his attractive and talented cast members.  EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons!

Diego (Rene Alvarado) is a young, gay Latino who dreams of leaving his East Los Angeles neighborhood.  He works in the family restaurant run by his loving grandmother (Irene DiBari).  New neighbors move in across the street:  a gay couple--handsome Wesley (Steve Callahan) and neurotic, jealous Jonathan (Cory Schneider)--who have purchased the house as an investment.  Naturally, Diego falls for Wesley.While maintaining its lighthearted tone, the film touches on a number of issues, including homophobia within the Latino community, and the condescending attitude of the West Hollywood types who are gentrifying the neighborhood toward the Latino residents.The actors are uniformly good, particularly Alvarado, DiBari, and Gladise Jimenez as Diego's sex-crazed, jet-setting aunt.Alvarado and Callahan make a charming couple.

1108839,A342EHO42V2G38,B000WDVNMO,"Terran ""Terran""","[5, 6]","This is a fun, but heavily flawed, movie.  It's charming as eye candy, and the story is light and amusing enough that it certainly passes the time favorably.  But sometimes the comedy is too broad, the characters have crossed the line from believable to not, so the entire film suffers as a result of a screenplay and director who needed to take a heavy handed approach, or at least needed to know what the target was.  Was the film meant to be a light-hearted romance, or over-the-top nonsense?  We've got both here, and that means we've also got characters of little depth.The villain, and I am referring to the live-in parter, one third of the romantic triangle that has developed, has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and is of so little appeal overall that one can't figure out how he's managed to have a faithful, devoted, good guy lover for two years.We open with an over-the-top homosexual-hating chef who is nearly frothing at the mouth, who after being fired by the part-owner of the restaurant who is himself gay (almost angelically gay, in fact, we nearly envision him with a halo, he is so perfect), the dying chef places a curse upon the place of business with his final words.  After that, either because of the curse or more likely the owner's being an outed gay in a neighborhood culture that is vehemently anti-maricon (so to speak) the business starts to fail.The owner might be more upset about this except he has other worries: his one-time real estate agent lover who has just rejected him after the ""I love you"" words is now dating his young and vibrant aunt, determined to stay in that closet forever, and out angelic hero is now newly attracted to one half of the gay couple who has just moved in across the street.The couple across the street are an unlikely pair, if merely because one is so straight-acting, he doesn't seem gay at all, and he seems unaware of the true character of his partner (a deleted scene clues us in even more to how bad the guy is), which means he is not overly bright, yet otherwise seems intelligent and sensitive.  The other half of the pair is a snob from Mississippi (that has to be meant as a joke; it's such a contradiction) who isn't very bright but whose best friend is also his letching wealthy boss - but at least these two talk the same language.The aunt is a real hoot and steals the show.  She is vitality plus, and is the one who goes through the greatest amount of character growth through the paces of the film.  From a globe-trotting, social-climbing ""Blanca who has changed her name to Bianca"" we see her begin to own up to her responsibilities to her family and her heritage.  In a gay romance story, it's the female who owns the film.Obviously we're touching on racism and homophobia, and a Mexicana strong cultural vocal rejection of homosexuality.  We also have self-loathing types, both the real estate agent who is striving to pass as straight, and a woman who is self-loathing as to her heritage, who obviously wishes she'd been born anything but Mexican, as Mexican probably means she can only rise so far in class, and no more.Some hot kissing scenes, and definitely good-looking male leads, but nothing too explicit.  Just randy, hot guys looking for love and finding their place at the end.
