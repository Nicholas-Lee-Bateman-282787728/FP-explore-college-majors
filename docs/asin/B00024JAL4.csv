While they are not crystal clear, they are certainly better than the worn syndicated prints which turn up on local TV stations. Very enjoyable and highly recommended to all vintage TV westerns fans.Volume 4 is rumored to be slated for February, 2005 release. I certainly hope so.",4,Cisco delivers!!,1101340800,"11 25, 2004",2004,408,"['third', 'series', 'Cisco', 'Kid', 'Collections', 'winner', 'are', 'best', 'prints', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'crystal', 'clear', 'are', 'certainly', 'better', 'worn', 'syndicated', 'prints', 'turn', 'up', 'local', 'TV', 'stations', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'recommended', 'vintage', 'TV', 'westerns', 'fans.Volume', '4', 'rumored', 'be', 'slated', 'February', '2005', 'release', 'certainly', 'hope', 'so']",The Cisco Kid - Collection 3

Hopefully some company will see the interest in this and other classic TV shows, & digitally remaster them. But again, the picture is not bad at all, and watching these episodes of the Cisco Kid sure beats looking at what Hollywood flings at us today!
