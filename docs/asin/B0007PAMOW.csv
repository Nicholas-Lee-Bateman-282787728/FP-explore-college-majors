886467,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0007PAMOW,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 8]","This PBS Mystery offering was interesting, with the usual great production values. It featured a first-class performance by Ben Miller as Dr. Edmund Bickleigh. On balance, though, I think it suffered by having no sympathetic characters and a plot, which seemed so original when the novel was published in 1931, that now seems a little ho hum. There is no mystery in this mystery, so it depends on how much we can empathize, or at least smile at, the lethal doings of the doctor.Bickleigh is a country doctor who has risen above his station in life, married well, and whose wife never lets him forget who has the money and the status in their little English town. He is a man with an inferiority complex and a passion for affairs. When he thinks he has actually fallen in love, his wife finds out and commands that it stop. His solution? Murder...which is determined by the authorities to have been an accidental drug overdose by the deceased. But Bickleigh's love leaves him for another, tongues begin to wag and it is clear he has never really been accepted by the town's upper crust. Even with this, life for the doctor is better than it has ever been when he was under the thumb of his wife. But still, a few loose ends must be taken care of. The doctor finally is accused of his wife's murder, but through a loving intervention he is acquitted. Then he is accused of another murder. This he didn't actually do, but the evidence, being a potted meat sandwich which cannot be interrogated, is incriminating. Justice triumphs in her own sweet way.This is a black comedy with British upperclass superiority matched against Bickleigh's feelings of inferiority and his complacent belief that some murder is justified. Miller does a great job, as does Barbara Flynn as Bickleigh's wife, an upperclass, domineering shrew. Twenty years ago Flynn played an entirely sympathetic, funny and slightly skeptic co-lead in The Beiderbecke Affair, an amusing and romantic mystery which is still available on DVD.",4,"A Better Than Average Mystery, With Class",1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,1999,"['PBS', 'Mystery', 'offering', 'was', 'interesting', 'usual', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'featured', 'first-class', 'performance', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'Dr.', 'Edmund', 'Bickleigh', 'balance', 'think', 'suffered', 'having', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'plot', 'seemed', 'so', 'original', 'when', 'novel', 'was', 'published', '1931', 'now', 'little', 'ho', 'hum', 'mystery', 'mystery', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'empathize', 'least', 'smile', 'lethal', 'doings', 'doctor.Bickleigh', 'country', 'doctor', 'who', 'risen', 'station', 'life', 'married', 'well', 'wife', 'never', 'forget', 'who', 'money', 'status', 'little', 'English', 'town', 'man', 'inferiority', 'complex', 'passion', 'affairs', 'When', 'actually', 'fallen', 'love', 'wife', 'out', 'stop', 'solution', 'Murder', 'determined', 'authorities', 'have', 'been', 'accidental', 'drug', 'overdose', 'deceased', 'Bickleigh', 'love', 'begin', 'wag', 'clear', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'accepted', 'town', 'upper', 'crust', 'Even', 'life', 'doctor', 'better', 'ever', 'been', 'when', 'was', 'thumb', 'wife', 'still', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'care', 'doctor', 'finally', 'accused', 'wife', 'murder', 'loving', 'intervention', 'acquitted', 'Then', 'accused', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'evidence', 'being', 'potted', 'meat', 'sandwich', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'interrogated', 'incriminating', 'Justice', 'triumphs', 'own', 'sweet', 'way.This', 'black', 'comedy', 'British', 'upperclass', 'superiority', 'matched', 'Bickleigh', 'feelings', 'inferiority', 'complacent', 'belief', 'murder', 'justified', 'Miller', 'great', 'job', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'Bickleigh', 'wife', 'upperclass', 'domineering', 'shrew', 'Twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Flynn', 'played', 'entirely', 'sympathetic', 'funny', 'slightly', 'skeptic', 'co-lead', 'Beiderbecke', 'Affair', 'amusing', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'still', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A

""Malice Aforethought"" is certainly a ""jolly good Murder/Mystery!"" It has everything in its list of ""ingredients"" that I feel a good Murder/Mystery should  include in order to make for a good and savory (what I call) ""Murder/Mystery broth"". ""Malice Aforethought"" certainly has the right ""ingredients"" to make it a most enjoyable 180 minutes of viewing.  The ""ingredients"" comprising the (""Malice Aforethough) ""Murder/Mystery broth"" are as follows:(1)  Good suspense with the murderer appearing to have gotten away with murder, but as they always say: ""murder will out"".  In this case, it's Typhoid Fever will out.(2)  Interesting characters consisting of an outwardly meek, masochistic letch of a philandering, obsessed with sanitation  husband/doctor; a shrew of a wife that by her own personality and ways would certainly drive even a saint to want to murder her; a blond artistic vamp (with certain demands) for the ""put upon"" husband to lust after making the murder of the wife even more desirable: a ""must get rid of (long standing) girlfriend"" that becomes dispensable in order to get to what and/or to whom is really wanted.  This girlfriend is very willing to (lie) in order to prove that she really loves her man; plus some innocent looking but irritating, see-all, know-all, town gossips that keep the ""low cast"" doctor and his philandering in their sights with the kindest word for the doctor/husband being ""he's a beastly man"".  In addition there is a see all sickly gardener that too must be disposed of before he tells all of what he has seen.(3)  Great script that is written very well with nary a dull moment keeping this viewer on the edge of his seat.(4)  Wonderful recreation and depiction of a fascinating decade and/or era (the 1920s).(5)  Great acting with Ben Miller playing the lower class, seemingly ""hen- pecked"", letch, ""scum-burger"" of a husband marvelously; Barbara Flynn (in a role switch for her--she usually plays the Victorian fragile type of woman) is wonderful as his domineering, upper class very irritating, brow-beating, pretentious, full of herself harpy of a wife; and Megan Dodds is great as the conniving, money seeking would be artistic vamp.(6)  An intriguing setting for the entire ""goings on""--a rural, picturesque and peaceful (at least on the surface) small English village with cobblestone walkways and small sheep herds.The entire above ingredients meld together marvelously to make a wonderfully delicious concoction.  Added, to the cauldron and to the above listed ""ingredients"", is just a pinch of so-called British ""black humor"" making for a most enjoyable and savory ""Murder/Mystery broth"".This mystery is not a ""detective driven"" Murder/Mystery.  Although there is a detective in the story his investigation does not bring the culprit to justice; potted meat and flies see that justice prevails.To sample a ""jolly good"" example of some very savory steaming ""Murder/Mystery broth"", purchase this DVD.",5,A SAVORY MURDER/MYSTERY BROTH,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,3045,"['have', 'previously', 'indicated', 'Board', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'British', 'Murder/Mysteries', 'Malice', 'Aforethought', 'certainly', 'jolly', 'good', 'Murder/Mystery', 'everything', 'list', 'ingredients', 'feel', 'good', 'Murder/Mystery', 'should', 'include', 'order', 'make', 'good', 'savory', 'what', 'call', 'Murder/Mystery', 'broth', 'Malice', 'Aforethought', 'certainly', 'right', 'ingredients', 'make', 'most', 'enjoyable', '180', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'ingredients', 'comprising', 'Malice', 'Aforethough', 'Murder/Mystery', 'broth', 'are', '1', 'Good', 'suspense', 'murderer', 'appearing', 'have', 'gotten', 'away', 'murder', 'always', 'say', 'murder', 'will', 'out', 'case', 'Typhoid', 'Fever', 'will', 'out', '2', 'Interesting', 'characters', 'consisting', 'outwardly', 'meek', 'masochistic', 'letch', 'philandering', 'obsessed', 'sanitation', 'husband/doctor', 'shrew', 'wife', 'own', 'personality', 'ways', 'would', 'certainly', 'drive', 'even', 'saint', 'want', 'murder', 'blond', 'artistic', 'vamp', 'certain', 'demands', 'put', 'upon', 'husband', 'lust', 'making', 'murder', 'wife', 'even', 'more', 'desirable', 'must', 'get', 'rid', 'long', 'standing', 'girlfriend', 'dispensable', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'and/or', 'whom', 'really', 'wanted', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'willing', 'lie', 'order', 'prove', 'really', 'man', 'innocent', 'looking', 'irritating', 'see-all', 'know-all', 'town', 'gossips', 'keep', 'low', 'cast', 'doctor', 'philandering', 'sights', 'kindest', 'word', 'doctor/husband', 'being', 'beastly', 'man', 'addition', 'see', 'sickly', 'gardener', 'too', 'must', 'be', 'disposed', 'what', 'seen', '3', 'Great', 'script', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'dull', 'moment', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'edge', 'seat', '4', 'Wonderful', 'recreation', 'depiction', 'fascinating', 'decade', 'and/or', 'era', '1920s', '5', 'Great', 'acting', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'playing', 'lower', 'class', 'seemingly', 'hen-', 'pecked', 'letch', 'scum-burger', 'husband', 'marvelously', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'role', 'switch', 'usually', 'Victorian', 'fragile', 'type', 'woman', 'wonderful', 'domineering', 'upper', 'class', 'very', 'irritating', 'brow-beating', 'pretentious', 'full', 'harpy', 'wife', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'great', 'conniving', 'money', 'seeking', 'would', 'be', 'artistic', 'vamp', '6', 'intriguing', 'setting', 'entire', 'goings', 'rural', 'picturesque', 'peaceful', 'least', 'surface', 'small', 'English', 'village', 'cobblestone', 'walkways', 'small', 'sheep', 'herds.The', 'entire', 'ingredients', 'meld', 'together', 'marvelously', 'make', 'wonderfully', 'delicious', 'concoction', 'Added', 'cauldron', 'above', 'listed', 'ingredients', 'just', 'pinch', 'so-called', 'British', 'black', 'humor', 'making', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'savory', 'Murder/Mystery', 'broth', '.This', 'mystery', 'not', 'detective', 'driven', 'Murder/Mystery', 'detective', 'story', 'investigation', 'not', 'bring', 'culprit', 'justice', 'potted', 'meat', 'flies', 'see', 'justice', 'prevails.To', 'sample', 'jolly', 'good', 'example', 'very', 'savory', 'steaming', 'Murder/Mystery', 'broth', 'purchase', 'DVD']",N/A

886473,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0007PAMOW,mirasreviews,"[4, 5]","""Malice Aforethought"" is a wry mystery based on the 1931 novel by Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox). This novel is widely considered the mystery writer's best work, but it is unlike conventional mysteries in that we know who commits the murder and why. We are privy to the murderer's plan, and we watch the darkly comic consequences play out.In the small English town of Wyvern's Cross, lover's trysts and hypochondriacs occupy most of Doctor Edmund Bickleigh's (Ben Miller) time. Dr. Bickleigh's constantly critical, domineering wife Julia (Barbara Flynn) owns the couple's home and never allows her husband to forget that for a moment. He's carrying on an affair with an adoring young lady named Ivy (Lucy Brown). But when the airheaded, artistic Miss Madeleine Cranmere (Megan Dodds) takes up residence in town, Dr. Bickleigh becomes infatuated with her. The socially conscious Julia has forbidden Bickleigh from ever seeing Madeleine, though. And Madeleine is not forthcoming with her affections without a promise of marriage. So Dr. Bickleigh decides that murder is the solution. But that's just the beginning of his troubles.""Malice Aforethought"" is black comedy revolving around the sociopathic, self-absorbed, but laughably foolish Dr. Bickleigh. Those traits actually don't distinguish him from most of the townsfolk. The film's characters could be as tiresome to the audience as they are to one another if we didn't see everyone through Dr. Bickleigh's eyes. Ben Miller gives a stand-out performance as this man who is oblivious to ethics and entirely single-minded. But instead of belonging to someone shrewd and ambitious, these traits belong to a dull-witted, passive-aggressive country doctor -who earnestly applies them to his problems. Thus ""Malice Aforethought""'s mocking, ironic humor.",4,"A Darkly Comic, Entirely Unmysterious, Murder Mystery.",1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,1805,"['Malice', 'Aforethought', 'wry', 'mystery', 'based', '1931', 'novel', 'Francis', 'Iles', 'Anthony', 'Berkeley', 'Cox', 'novel', 'widely', 'considered', 'mystery', 'writer', 'best', 'work', 'conventional', 'mysteries', 'know', 'who', 'murder', 'why', 'are', 'privy', 'murderer', 'plan', 'watch', 'darkly', 'comic', 'consequences', 'play', 'small', 'English', 'town', 'Wyvern', 'Cross', 'lover', 'trysts', 'hypochondriacs', 'occupy', 'most', 'Doctor', 'Edmund', 'Bickleigh', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Bickleigh', 'constantly', 'critical', 'domineering', 'wife', 'Julia', 'Barbara', 'Flynn', 'couple', 'home', 'never', 'husband', 'forget', 'moment', 'carrying', 'affair', 'adoring', 'young', 'lady', 'named', 'Ivy', 'Lucy', 'Brown', 'when', 'airheaded', 'artistic', 'Miss', 'Madeleine', 'Cranmere', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'up', 'residence', 'town', 'Dr.', 'Bickleigh', 'infatuated', 'socially', 'conscious', 'Julia', 'forbidden', 'Bickleigh', 'ever', 'seeing', 'Madeleine', 'though', 'Madeleine', 'not', 'forthcoming', 'affections', 'promise', 'marriage', 'So', 'Dr.', 'Bickleigh', 'murder', 'solution', 'just', 'beginning', 'troubles', 'Malice', 'Aforethought', 'black', 'comedy', 'revolving', 'sociopathic', 'self-absorbed', 'laughably', 'foolish', 'Dr.', 'Bickleigh', 'traits', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'most', 'townsfolk', 'film', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'tiresome', 'audience', 'are', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'everyone', 'Dr.', 'Bickleigh', 'eyes', 'Ben', 'Miller', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'oblivious', 'ethics', 'entirely', 'single-minded', 'instead', 'belonging', 'someone', 'shrewd', 'ambitious', 'traits', 'belong', 'dull-witted', 'passive-aggressive', 'country', 'doctor', '-who', 'earnestly', 'problems', 'Thus', 'Malice', 'Aforethought', 'mocking', 'ironic', 'humor']",N/A

His perspective of life is not much improved by the endless humiliations imposed upon him by his notably older and noxious wife. He could simply divorce her were it not for the fact that she's of the rich nobility and he's the spawn of a nefarious quack.The doctor's over-active libido plunges him (double entendre intended) into even deeper difficulties -- he encounters all manner of trouble in maintaining a professional relationship with attractive, young patients of the opposite sex. When he drops one mistress in pursuit of another, the jilted lady tosses him to the wolves (her vengeful husband!), a result which is particularly inconvenient for the doctor as he has just murdered his wife!The doctor is the topic of the entire hamlet's gossip and yet he presses forward for love and for status... and to eliminate trouble-making tongue-waggers. Just as life begins to look up for him, a nosey and intuitive Scotland Yard inspector appears on the scene.This story is set in the early days of 20th Century England and the locations and cinematography could not be better.
