But in this case I feel it's important to let people and governments know that we're not a bunch of idiots. The truth will out.Here's the scoop. Dr. Burzynski has developed a non-toxic method for curing most cancers. His success rate is at about 25% though some trials showed it as high as 50%. One of the important aspects of his treatment is, even if it doesn't cure you, it won't put you through the same hell as chemo-therapy or radiation treatment. The FDA didn't like that so they kept dragging him in front of Grand Juries. After all, they have a multi-billion dollar industry in place. So what if it isn't all that good. We're talking money here. He survived the Grand Juries, so they figured, if you can't beat him, steal his patents. Which is exactly what they did.This is an outstanding documentary. It starts by showing the reasoning behind his treatment as well as the process. You get the testimonies from all the cured patients, along with their words on what they were told from various other doctors on how they, or their child wouldn't live past ""X"" months. These ducks are all lined up in a row and there is little, if any question, that the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies are a bunch of scumbags that aren't as interested in helping people as they are in helping themselves. One of the worst aspects of their witch hunt was that they weren't questioning the efficacy of his treatment. They were trying to nail him on more commerce related issues. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the value of the treatment the first consideration? Can't the irrelevant details be worked on later?The ""Walk for Cancer"" and the pink ribbons are a good show, but, as of now, I wouldn't give them one thin dime or a minute of my time.

After hearing about the harassment and lawsuits Dr. Burzynski endured over the past two decades, Eric signed on to direct and produce a full-length film highlighting the unbelievable perseverance and determination Dr. Burzynski had to stand up for the patients he had helped beat their cancer without the use of chemotherapy. You must watch this film to gain an appreciation for the man behind this miracle cancer-fighting treatment.In this DVD, Eric Merola tells the story of Dr. Burzynski in compelling language and discusses:- The incredible discovery Dr. Burzynski found to treat cancer- Why nobody has paid attention to Dr. Burzynski's story before- How this documentary shows abundant proof- Why Dr. Burzynski remained defiant against his detractors- How he was able to leave Poland with $15 and his peptide discovery- The meticulous record-keeping methodology used by Dr. Burzynski- Why the fight isn't over because Phase 2 of his study is complete- How the government tried to steal his idea for treating cancer- The promotion of the benefits of Antineoplastons for cancer patientsYou really owe it to yourself to watch this film and decide for yourself whether you think Dr. Burzynski is a hero or a goat. I'm convinced he's a hero who is deserving of the Nobel Prize in science someday soon.",5,A Powerful Documentary On An Alternative Approach To Chemotherapy For Cancer Patients,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,1724,"['one', 'most', 'powerful', 'films', 'subject', 'cancer', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'first', 'heard', 'buddy', 'Sean', 'Croxton', 'Underground', 'Wellness', 'Radio', 'Show', 'called', 'Burzynski', 'Movie', 'filmmaker', 'Eric', 'Merola', 'background', 'making', 'documentaries', 'television', 'Eric', 'decided', 'use', 'skills', 'bring', 'light', 'story', 'medical', 'doctor', 'PhD', 'biochemist', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Stanislaw', 'Burzynski', 'hearing', 'harassment', 'lawsuits', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'endured', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'Eric', 'signed', 'direct', 'produce', 'full-length', 'film', 'highlighting', 'unbelievable', 'perseverance', 'determination', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'had', 'stand', 'up', 'patients', 'had', 'helped', 'beat', 'cancer', 'use', 'chemotherapy', 'must', 'watch', 'film', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'man', 'miracle', 'cancer-fighting', 'treatment.In', 'DVD', 'Eric', 'Merola', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'compelling', 'language', 'discusses', 'incredible', 'discovery', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'found', 'treat', 'cancer-', 'Why', 'nobody', 'paid', 'attention', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'story', 'before-', 'How', 'documentary', 'abundant', 'proof-', 'Why', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'remained', 'defiant', 'detractors-', 'How', 'was', 'able', 'leave', 'Poland', '15', 'peptide', 'discovery-', 'meticulous', 'record-keeping', 'methodology', 'used', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski-', 'Why', 'fight', ""n't"", 'Phase', '2', 'study', 'complete-', 'How', 'government', 'tried', 'steal', 'idea', 'treating', 'cancer-', 'promotion', 'benefits', 'Antineoplastons', 'cancer', 'patientsYou', 'really', 'watch', 'film', 'decide', 'think', 'Dr.', 'Burzynski', 'hero', 'goat', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'hero', 'who', 'deserving', 'Nobel', 'Prize', 'science', 'someday', 'soon']","Burzynski, the Movie"

Have you ever wondered, after having spent hundreds of billions of dollars on cancer research over the last 60 years, why we still rely on decades old radiation and chemotherapy that makes people sick while trying to make them better?Burzinsky is a sobering look at how collusion, greed, arrogance and power have stymied collaboration, outstanding research, and incredible breakthroughs in this so called ""Best HealthCare System in the World"".  The gut wrenching injustice directed toward a brilliant, driven, medical research oncologist, Dr. Stanislaw Burzinsky, who stumbled upon and patented a class of biological compounds that cure cancer, is the subject of this movie.The way that the NCI, FDA and Big-Pharma tried to ruin this scientist was simply appalling!

His weight dropped from 150 lbs to 98 lbs. Dr. Lee Cowden cured him and is curing terminal patients and putting serious chronic diseases in remission, much like Dr. Burzynski. There is life saving natural medicine out there, folks, but it is being withheld from the sick and dying.Jack was in his 20's in 1991, He had always been healthy, industrious, full of life and enthusiasm, but, began to not feel well and started seeing doctors and having test to rule out conditions but nothing significant was found. He was spiraling downward into disability without a diagnosis to the point that I moved in with him as a caretaker and after seeing many doctors in our state we traveled to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or anywhere we had a shred of hope for improvement.Conventional Medicine was making Jack worse and personally insulting him. They used nuclear medical testing that made him worse and only offered drugs and psychriatric counseling.  He was suffering and we were desperate. Psychoanalysis labeled him as a malingerer.(pretends to be ill to avoid work)We heard about an Environmental Clinic in Dallas, Tx so we were there off and on for several years and eventually got a diagnosis of Lyme disease. He got better doing Dr. Rae's sauna detoxification program but reached a plateau still disabled.  Dr. Rae put him on IV nutrition thru a shunt in his chest that brought his weight back up to 150 lbs.  It saved Jack's life but he was still not well.We were fortunate to come in contact with Dr. Lee Cowden in Dallas by Jack participating in a Lyme study about ten years ago.Dr. Cowden is an MD and practiced Cardiology for many years before turning to natural medicine to cure a serious personal health issue and has practiced Natural Medicine ever since.Thru the years we noticed that we would lose access to natural supplements that were really helping Jack. You just couldn't get it anymore. It was suspicious. But, there are so many new ones becoming available all the time that it would be difficult to shut down all of them.  Other countries are far ahead of the U.S. in producing these vital supplements and giving their people access.Dr. Burzynski and Dr. Cowden are not giving up.

The FDA must be one of the most evil organizations to have ever existed. Nevermind whether this doctor was or was not a ""quack"", and it seems that he was far from that. Actually, it seems that he may have cured or invented rather, a cure for cancer. The key importance of this film is to show the evil of Statist philosophy at work in the USA. It is a bleak reminder that we are living in that 1984...it has come to pass.If Jefferson was still alive, this movie alone would have sparked a revolution.Pharmaceutical firms are not the enemy here, although clearly the people at the FDA have destroyed the free market in medicine. Big Pharma has become the enemy, forced to be the enemy by the Government. And doctors are all criminals...when they use their brains to discover new and impossible cures.In this case, we're talking about people who had zero options. And even then--prevented from saving themselves by the same people who would force a woman to give birth...oh yes...this is the same philosophy at work. The idea that Government owns your body.

If you want to know what is destroying your world...what made Nazi Germany and Communist Russia possible...it is right here, in your Government, and it's already won half the battle. Not just that man must live for the state, but that we must sacrifice reason, our reason and facts...to the power and emotional impotence of bureaucrats.I'll leave you with a quote from the book I mention above...which hated as it is...demonstrates and predicted the very thing that is now happening, about 50 years ago.""Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed? We want them broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against . . . We're after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you'd better get wise to it. There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.
