1105663,AOW7M9ULF0JND,B000VZADNI,Alec Martin,"[0, 0]","Musicals, when you get to the core of it, are hard to do. Over the years, the stereotypes of a ""musical"" - a story told through an abundant amount of signing and / or dancing - have changed; it ranges from ""for hippies"" to ""cool"" , from ""well done"" to ""gay."" Musicals, when done well, can tell a story and release some catchy, memorable numbers; a good musical is well-done, professional, and often times has wonderful music. A bad musical has pointless songs, unmemorable characters, the vividness of a Saturday morning cartoon, and can be pretty damn boring. For Colma: The Musical, H.P. Mendoza's inexpensive debut, it sandwiches itself somewhere in between that fine line between 'good' and 'gay'.Colma's catalyst was in fact, a present that H.P. Mendoza had given to his friend on his birthday. This was around the time when the up-and-coming director was still trying to figure out really what to do with his life; and then he met director Richard Wong, in fact a student friend of his. The two more than likely had a few shots, devised an idea, got the money, and after 18 days and surely a lot of procrastinating came Colma: The Musical - a small, immature, low tech film that cost about $15,000 to actually make. There is a list of 'the least expensive films of all time', ranging from $500 to $30,000 to make; Colma comes right in the middle.The problem with Colma is that its problems are way too evident from the beginning. For a film that shares the same budget with Eegah, one of the single worst movies to ever come out of the womb, you'd expect it to have major technical problems. In several scenes, often times the acoustics aren't strong enough, and the characters' voices will come out as either muffled, or alternatively, too loud. The cinematography is ridiculously bad at points; the scene in the musical number ""Crash the Party"" (where the female lead takes control of the song) was done in one take; while it was clear it was meant as a realistic metaphor, like you were at the party, we didn't need it. Often times, the film will just zoom in or zoom out on the characters while they sing entire songs; the song ""Tara"" is just in front of Billy's face with people jumping in the background for humorous effect (for example). Yeah...The story is gagworthy to begin with, and doldrums might set in by the sound of it. Colma, a little city near San Francisco, is the main setting for this movie, made obvious by the title. It's famous for having... more dead people than the whole population combined. (And yet apparently entire people in this population will randomly break out into song) The film's relatively small cast focuses around three teenagers: Billy (Jake Moreno), a nasally, deadpan, often times mean Target employee; Rodel (H.P. Mendoza himself), a gay, witty, slightly hipsterish poet who struggles with coming out of the closet; and Maribel (L.A. Renigen), the boisterous, black, fun girl who doesn't even get a solo number. The film is more of a character study, focusing around the their positive and negative aspects and their struggles with actually becoming adults.To add to the thin plotline and the low tech, some of the songs are... unflattering, to say the least. It's clear that there was effort put into Colma, but it just doesn't show here. The songs do follow tunes and rhythms, but these are flawed, to say the least. The opening number, 'Colma Stays', played over an electronic drumset and a flat bassline, has a very awkward vocal rhythm when the actors sing, and at a few times they can stumble to keep up with it. Often times, there are some songs that should of been kept out all together, whether due to the weak vocal strength, the second rate instruments, or the overall feel of it.Despite all of its quirks, however, Colma: The Musical is a surprisingly good, stable movie. The story is driven by the characters, mostly by Rodel's sexual and familial problems and Billy's romantic problems and his rebounding from a bad relationship. It's towards the second half of the movie when the story really starts to pick up, and is where we are really introduces to the characters after a slow start.While Colma can be immature (very, at times), it does have a sub-par sense of humor. Some of Rodel's one-liners, either about himself or the people around him, are very quick-witted and humorous. The barroom shanty, ""Goodbye Cupid"", played over a piano and a 3/4 time signature, does feature a funny idea; a bunch of men glad to be single. The stories that back up the song, like Billy's story about his ex meeting his cousin, are definitely laugh-worthy. There are a few really good references to various modern culture. While all of the characters have their moments, it's clear that Rodel definitely powers the story and adds a few interesting elements to it.Song-wise (and that's what makes a musical), Colma is a mixed bag. While each of the characters have their moments, Maribel is definitely the strongest out of the three; the other two more or less just keep going. Billy's voice is, at best, deadpan, and at worst, the guy can't sing. His solo songs in the musical don't amount to much, but the finale ""Nothing and Everything"" shows more promise than the others. Rodel's solo songs are slightly better, such as 'One Day (Pt. 2)' and 'Crazy Like Me'. The movie really shines when multiple people are involved in a song; ""Things Will Get Better"" is a great triplet between our three protagonists, featuring an upbeat, poppy tone driven by guitars and keyboards. ""Goodbye Cupid"" and ""Crash the Party"" are both decent ensemble tracks, though there are times when the latter can go on for too long.The general worldly consensus on musicals is that they can either suck or be good. It's never in between, but in Colma's case, it did it. The idea of Colma is really, really good; the characters make it interesting, there are a few toe-tappin' songs here and there, and for a debut, H.P. Mendoza does a great job. However, the painfully low budget, off-key singing, and a good deal of the lame humor in Colma sort of bring it down; while there are some really good jokes in Colma, a lot of it can be flat-out unimpressive, which doesn't set up a very good example for the film's climatic finish. But that being said, this film is both too much fun and has too much heart for you to really hate it. It can be stale as an out-of-date vanilla wafer, but you can forgive it, right?",3,"Can be stale as a wafer cracker, but it's got heart.",1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,6434,"['Musicals', 'when', 'get',

1105666,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000VZADNI,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 7]","There's a simple emotional acuity at the heart of this 2007 coming-of-age musical. True, at a poverty row budget of $15,000, it has the production values of a direct-to-hotel porn movie, but first-time director Richard Wong and first-time screenwriter, songwriter and co-lead H.P. Mendoza manage to make something substantive from the tired premise of three close friends just out of high school and still reeling from painful romantic breakups and experiencing the social alienation that makes their respective roads to self-discovery bumpy ones. The acting feels stilted and the music rather derivative, but the film somehow makes it to the finish line through its honesty about how life is for social outcasts living in San Francisco's suburban necropolis. It's all the more forgivable for the enthusiastic effort that shows.Shot on digital video in the real town of Colma, the movie opens with the three leads singing theRent-inspired rave-up, ""Colma Stays"", which describes the anonymous small town with clever imagery. Lanky Jake Moreno plays Billy, the most inchoate of the trio, an aspiring actor who not only lands a sales job at the mall (Serramonte for all you SF locals) but also a supporting role in a local community theater production. He can't seem to get over his ex-girlfriend much to the chagrin of not only a smitten fellow actress but also close pal Maribel. With a cheery spark masking an uncertain melancholy, the cherubic L.A. Renigen makes party girl Maribel the earthbound glue holding the trio together just barely. Her shining moment comes with ""Crash the Party"", a dead ringer forBlondie's ""Dreamin'"", preceded by the film's funniest moment, a frozen-stare purchase of alcohol with fake IDs similar to the liquor store scene inSuperbad.The most challenged and challenging character is Rodel, played with studied deadpan by Mendoza. Rodel is a gay poet and slacker, closeted from his traditional Filipino father and increasingly jealous of Billy's ability to move on with his life. He provides the film's most painfully realistic moments, as well as the most lacerating lines. Yet, his plaintive rendition of ""One Day (Pt. 2)"" provides genuine heart to the story's climactic moment. Not everything is wondrous. Moreno's nasal vocals, which make him sound like Bert onSesame Street, get wearing for the repetitive monotone. The barroom shanty scene runs too long, especially in  time, and the ""Deadwalking"" duet between Renigen and Mendoza is marred by the arty Bergmanesque intrusion of ghostly couples dancing in the cemetery. The 2007 DVD offers a few surprising extras given the film's low budget - an infectious and insightful commentary track from Wong and Mendoza and fifteen minutes of deleted and extended scenes that were wisely excised from the final cut.

1105669,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000VZADNI,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","What would it be like to grow up in a town where the dead outnumber the living by a ratio of more than a-thousand-to-one?  That's the case with Colma, a working-class community located just south of San Francisco that is more notable for its vast cemeteries than for anything related to the folk who actually live there.  Dubbed The City of the Dead, Colma has a population of around 1500 above ground but over a million-and-a-half below, with roughly 75% of the town's land given over to tombstones and gravesites.  That hardly seems the ideal setting for a movie musical, but then ""Colma: The Musical"" is not your average, run-of-the-mill, afraid-to-take-a-risk movie.  Thankfully.Three of the live people who call Colma home are Billy (Jake Moreno), an aspiring actor who`s so straight-arrow he`s never even had a drink; Rodel (H.P. Mendoza, who also co-wrote the screenplay), a gay prankster who fears coming out to his traditionalist dad;  and Maribel (L.A. Renigen), a fun-loving free spirit, who often has to serve as mediator between the two guys.  Recently graduated from high school, these three best buddies suddenly discover themselves on the brink of adulthood, trying to find their way in the world and wondering what the future holds for them.Like a modern-day ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" ""Colma: The Musical"" is a cinematic operetta in which the characters define their relationships and express their feelings almost entirely through song.  The score by Mendoza is lively and bouncy - if a trifle redundant at times - with lyrics that capture the fears and yearnings of the teenage heart with uncanny accuracy.  In addition, this stylish and stylized  movie features appealing performances, an endearing sense-of-humor, a hint of surrealism, and an artful use of that rarely employed, but often highly effective, tool of cinematic grammar, the split-screen.With its youthful exuberance and anything-goes audaciousness, this quirky, independent feature has much of the feel of experimental regional theater about it.  And the fact that it's still a trifle rough around the edges only adds to its authenticity and charm.Filled with amusing and touching insights into this wonderfully complex and exciting thing we call ""growing up,"" the movie understands the paradox that Colma, like all hometowns, serves both as the soil to plant one's roots in and as the place to break away from when the time is right.  That's the lesson that these three likable young people learn in the end - just as the countless others, now residing in those graveyards, learned before them.",4,charming coming-of-age musical,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",2009,2580,"['What', 'would', 'be', 'grow', 'up', 'town', 'where', 'dead', 'living', 'ratio', 'more', 'a-thousand-to-one', 'case', 'Colma', 'working-class', 'community', 'located', 'just', 'south', 'San', 'Francisco', 'more', 'notable', 'vast', 'cemeteries', 'anything', 'related', 'folk', 'who', 'actually', 'live', 'there', 'Dubbed', 'City', 'Dead', 'Colma', 'population', '1500', 'ground', 'million-and-a-half', 'below', 'roughly', '75', '%', 'town', 'land', 'given', 'tombstones', 'gravesites', 'hardly', 'ideal', 'setting', 'movie', 'musical', 'then', 'Colma', 'Musical', 'not', 'average', 'run-of-the-mill', 'afraid-to-take-a-risk', 'movie', 'Thankfully.Three', 'live', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'Colma', 'home', 'are', 'Billy', 'Jake', 'Moreno', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 's', 'so', 'straight-arrow', 's', 'never', 'even', 'had', 'drink', 'Rodel', 'H.P', 'Mendoza', 'who', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'gay', 'prankster', 'who', 'coming', 'out', 'traditionalist', 'dad', 'Maribel', 'L.A.', 'Renigen', 'fun-loving', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'often', 'serve', 'mediator', 'two', 'guys', 'Recently', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'three', 'best', 'buddies', 'suddenly', 'discover', 'brink', 'adulthood', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'wondering', 'what', 'future', 'modern-day', 'Umbrellas', 'Cherbourg', 'Colma', 'Musical', 'cinematic', 'operetta', 'characters', 'define', 'relationships', 'express', 'feelings', 'almost', 'entirely', 'song', 'score', 'Mendoza', 'lively', 'bouncy', 'trifle', 'redundant', 'times', 'lyrics', 'capture', 'fears', 'yearnings', 'teenage', 'heart', 'uncanny', 'accuracy', 'addition', 'stylish', 'stylized', 'movie', 'features', 'appealing', 'performances', 'endearing', 'sense-of-humor', 'hint', 'surrealism', 'artful', 'use', 'rarely', 'employed', 'often', 'highly', 'effective', 'tool', 'cinematic', 'grammar', 'split-screen.With', 'youthful', 'exuberance', 'anything-goes', 'audaciousness', 'quirky', 'independent', 'feature', 'much', 'feel', 'experimental', 'regional', 'theater', 'fact', 'still', 'trifle', 'rough', 'edges', 'only', 'authenticity', 'charm.Filled', 'amusing', 'touching', 'insights', 'wonderfully', 'complex', 'exciting', 'thing', 'call', 'growing', 'up', 'movie', 'paradox', 'Colma', 'hometowns', 'soil', 'plant', 'one', 'roots', 'place', 'break', 'away', 'when', 'time', 'right', 'lesson', 'three', 'likable', 'young', 'people', 'learn', 'end', 'just', 'countless', 'others', 'now', 'residing', 'graveyards', 'learned']",N/A
