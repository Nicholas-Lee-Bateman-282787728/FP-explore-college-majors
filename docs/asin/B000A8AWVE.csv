But really there's no reason to start up any disputes as to whether Pete or Ringo was the better of the two drummers. That's because they're just two drummers who played better on different kinds of music.Obviously, it's absurd to claim Best was a lousy drummer, or else he could never have soonafter helmed the Pete Best Combo, which recorded and toured for a few years in the mid-'60s. Likewise, Ringo was hardly lacking, given that he was first brought in as an outright ringer, hot off his duties with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Just listen to the two drum styles - Best is more of a jazz or pop drummer, while Ringo was more suited for the surf and rock 'n' roll style of the time.The Beatles could have also gone in a jazz direction - who knows? But they didn't, since George Martin was then looking to develop a rock 'n' roll group. Had he wanted them to be a different sort of group, maybe they would have gone in that slightly altered direction instead.

This story is from the man himself, Pete Best, and many insider interviews, Among them Astrid Kircherr, Cynthia Lennon, George Martin, Rory Best, Klaus Voohrman, Stu Sutcliff's sister Pauline, John Lennon's sister Julia, just to name a few.It all boils down to this, It was a dirty deal they handed Pete. IMHO, I believe that once George Martin made a comment about the Pete's drumming, John and Paul took it to Brian and that was it. No doubt Brian felt terrible because he knew what a terrible thing it was. I think Lennon and McCartney put it in Brian's hands and let it go with the guilt and obviously Brian was left holding the bag.I always loved the Beatles, although after seeing this, my feelings have been slightly changed. Love the music, but the Beatles were not always nice guys. Come to think of it, Lennon was not always a nice guy anyway. I cannot hand off my love of their music, but I know Pete Best could have easily been one of the greats himself and one of the drumming greats.We hear samples of Pete's band performances in this documentary.

Gorman ""John Lee Booker""","[0, 1]","If you claim to be a Beatles' fan, or think you know their history, you don't 'til you've seen this fascinating documentary DVD. It's directed by Geoff Wonfor, the same genius who gave us ""The Beatles Anthology"". Consider ""Best of the Beatles"" a prequel to the ""Anthology"" series, and it's every bit as enthralling.Pete was the Beatles' original drummer from Day One in August, 1960, 'til his mysterious ouster in August, 1962. (To quote John Lennon, ""We were cowards when we sacked Pete""). Why Pete was fired had nothing whatsoever to do with the quality of his drumming, FYI. Best, I've found, in talking to those who were there at the time, is a guy who laughed, partied, and messed around with girls at at least the same rate as the others, so the idea of him ""not fitting in"" is sheer nonsense! As to his drumming, I can personally attest to Pete being a first-rate drummer, and actually better than Ringo, having heard both Mr. Best and Mr. Starr live.As they say on the BBC, ""And now, to our film!"" In regards to this DVD, you'll just have to watch this documentary to learn the whole story. You'll also see, among much more:- The earliest color footage of The Beatles, performing live in February, 1962.- The Casbah Coffee Club, the place where the Beatles first concerts were played, as The Casbah's ""house band"". The Casbah is still in its original location, in mint condition, preserved on Liverpool's list of historic places!- Compelling interviews with people who were there with Pete, John, Paul, George, and their first bassist, Stu Sutcliffe.- Pete reminisces with Beatles' photographer, Astrid Kircherr. Stu Sutcliffe quit the band to marry her....- How a 33 to 1 longshot bet on a horse paid off, figuring hugely in The Beatles' early success.As to Amazon reviewer Sam Graham saying that Pete ""wasn't (truly) a Beatle"", you haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about, Mr. Graham. You weren't there, nor have you talked to Liverpudlians who actually saw Pete play with the Beatles. I have! He fit in perfectly well. Pete himself has only said regarding his dismissal that, ""In the end, it boils down to this: ""I had a legion of fans. John had his legion, Paul had his legion, and George had his, too. As to why I was let go, somehow in some way it wasn't meant to be.""Best has C-L-A-S-S, too, unlike his detractors! At one Beatles' Convention, I asked Pete directly, ""But where's your justifiably righteous anger?"" His reply, ""You can let things like that eat you alive, or you can choose to move on. I chose to move on!""I can also recommend the companion book on Amazon.com, ""The Beatles: The True Beginnings"", and his musical autobiography, ""Haymans Green"" CD. They're not only the story of the band's start, but the color photos alone are worth the price of the book!",5,"Pete's Neither Mean Nor Moody, Just Magnificent!

923811,A8Q25HOX0IKN0,B000A8AWVE,J. Youngblood,"[10, 14]","Yes, I am a Beatle freak, and will remember the night they were on the Ed Sullivan show as strongly as I remember the day JFK was assassinated.  But as in all success stories the rise to fame is always the most interesting, and the Beatles' is hard to match.  What makes this set so interesting is the thoroughness of it.  The appearances of so many people from those days (who have rarely been seen) was astonishing.  There are many books that will spell out incomparable details of those years, but visually, this is the most in-depth and accurate look at what really happened.  Like Lennon said many times, the Beatles would never have happened without Hamburg.I write this partly because of another reviewer who was correct that Pete Best simply wasn't a first class drummer.  He was little more than a novice when the Hamburg scene started, and regular gigs at bars is hardly a good way to develop style.  It gets so noisy that all one can do is bash away and keep the beat, that's all.  And most people don't realize (many musicians too) that the drummer is the most important part of a band.  The drummer is the foundation of it, and if the foundation is shaky, then the house will fall down sooner than later.  The 'clinical', clean, precision-minded environment of a professional recording studio compared to a rowdy bar is indescribable, and it was clear to Parlophone that the Beatles had a lot of drawbacks, not just Best's drumming.  Plus, Parlophone was a 'specialty' label.  Their sales were so low that the parent company (EMI) was considering shutting them down completely.  George Martin was in serious need of a rock 'n' roll band - ANY band with potential - which he saw in the Beatles, and why he gave them a try.  Of all that came before and was to follow, this was the Beatles key stroke of luck.  Without Parlophone's predicament the Beatles would have been a 'local' band forever because they had already been turned down by every record label in the country.  Martin's plan was to refine their sound, find better songs, maybe change their name, and use a session drummer for recordings instead of Pete Best.  At the threshold of professional entertainment - no more bars - and not being aware of Martin's full assessment of them, the only real impact personally was the drumming glitch.  Heck, I know fellows who might trade in their Mothers for a chance like that, so the Beatles weren't going to risk a contract on a so-so drummer.  Since Ringo was the best drummer in town he was their choice.  It might have been the worst thing Pete Best would ever experience, but what Ringo brought to the Beatles is unquestionable.  History now speaks for itself.It's very sad that Pete Best will always be remembered as the 'former Beatle', but the truth is, there were many others who came and went before him.  It's an anguish he'll always feel, but the one great thing he can be proud of is being exactly that - a former Beatle.  Even with Ringo, a twist of fate could easily have made the Beatles a 'one hit wonder', and today nobody would know anything about Pete Best.  But he was there in those magic, wistful days, and he'll be well remembered for it.  I think it's extremely commendable of him to come forward and share all those fantastic memories.  ""Best of the Beatles"" is a must have.  It's a much closer, more personal look at those wonderous days.  It's so well made, and presented with such zest that even a moderate Beatle fan would find it hard not to watch.  The cast of characters included in this DVD was a phenomenal feat.  Many of them are only names we've read in endless books, have never been seen before, never even heard their voices.  ""Best of the Beatles"" is far more in-depth than the Beatles Anthology, to the point where one is tempted to 'fast forward' through it.  The most telling importance of the early years was a quote from Lennon: ""We were performers in Liverpool and Hamburg.  What we generated was fantastic.  But as soon as we made it, the edges were knocked off.  Brian put us in suits and all that, we made it very, very big, but we'd sold out...  The Beatles died then, as musicians.  We never improved as musicians.  We missed the club dates because THAT'S when we were playing real music...""",5,Absolutely fascinating,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,4258,"['Yes', 'am', 'Beatle', 'freak', 'will', 'remember', 'night', 'were', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'as', 'strongly', 'remember', 'day', 'JFK', 'was', 'assassinated', 'success', 'rise', 'fame', 'always', 'most', 'interesting', 'Beatles', 'hard', 'match', 'What', 'set', 'so', 'interesting', 'thoroughness', 'appearances', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'days', 'who', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'seen', 'was', 'astonishing', 'are', 'many', 'books', 'will', 'spell', 'out', 'incomparable', 'details', 'years', 'visually', 'most', 'in-depth', 'accurate', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Lennon', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'Beatles', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'Hamburg.I', 'write', 'partly', 'reviewer', 'who', 'was', 'correct', 'Pete', 'Best', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'first', 'class', 'drummer', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'novice', 'when', 'Hamburg', 'scene', 'started', 'regular', 'gigs', 'bars', 'hardly', 'good', 'way', 'develop', 'style', 'so', 'noisy', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'bash', 'away', 'keep', 'beat', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'many', 'musicians', 'too', 'drummer', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'band', 'drummer', 'foundation', 'foundation', 'shaky', 'then', 'house', 'will', 'fall', 'down', 'sooner', 'later', ""'clinical"", 'clean', 'precision-minded', 'environment', 'professional', 'recording', 'studio', 'compared', 'rowdy', 'bar', 'indescribable', 'was', 'clear', 'Parlophone', 'Beatles', 'had', 'lot', 'drawbacks', 'not', 'just', 'Best', 'drumming', 'Parlophone', 'was', ""'specialty"", 'label', 'sales', 'were', 'so', 'low', 'parent', 'company', 'EMI', 'was', 'considering', 'shutting', 'down', 'completely', 'George', 'Martin', 'was', 'serious', 'need', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'band', 'band', 'potential', 'saw', 'Beatles', 'why', 'gave', 'try', 'came', 'was', 'follow', 'was', 'Beatles', 'key', 'stroke', 'luck', 'Parlophone', 'predicament', 'Beatles', 'would', 'have', 'been', ""'local"", 'band', 'forever', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'turned', 'down', 'record', 'label', 'country', 'Martin', 'plan', 'was', 'refine', 'sound', 'find', 'better', 'songs', 'maybe', 'change', 'name', 'use', 'session', 'drummer', 'recordings', 'instead', 'Pete', 'Best', 'threshold', 'professional', 'entertainment', 'more', 'bars', 'not', 'being', 'aware', 'Martin', 'full', 'assessment', 'only', 'real', 'impact', 'personally', 'was', 'drumming', 'glitch', 'Heck', 'know', 'fellows', 'who', 'might', 'trade', 'Mothers', 'chance', 'Beatles', 'were', ""n't"", 'going', 'risk', 'contract', 'so-so', 'drummer', 'Ringo', 'was', 'best', 'drummer', 'town', 'was', 'choice', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'worst', 'thing', 'Pete', 'Best', 'would', 'ever', 'experience', 'what', 'Ringo', 'brought', 'Beatles', 'unquestionable', 'History', 'now', 'itself.It', 'very', 'sad', 'Pete', 'Best', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', ""'former"", 'Beatle', 'truth', 'were', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'came', 'went', 'anguish', ""'ll"", 'always', 'feel', 'one', 'great', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'being', 'exactly', 'former', 'Beatle', 'Even', 'Ringo', 'twist', 'fate', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'made', 'Beatles', ""'one"", 'hit', 'wonder', 'today', 'nobody', 'would', 'know', 'anything', 'Pete', 'Best', 'was', 'there', 'magic', 'wistful', 'days', ""'ll"", 'be', 'well', 'remembered', 'think', 'extremely', 'commendable', 'come', 'forward', 'share', 'fantastic', 'memories', 'Best', 'Beatles', 'must', 'have', 'much', 'closer', 'more', 'personal', 'look', 'wonderous', 'days', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'presented', 'such', 'zest', 'even', 'moderate', 'Beatle', 'fan', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'watch', 'cast', 'characters', 'included', 'DVD', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'feat', 'Many', 'are', 'only', 'names', ""'ve"", 'read', 'endless', 'books', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'voices', 'Best', 'Beatles', 'far', 'more', 'in-depth', 'Beatles', 'Anthology', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'tempted', ""'fast"", 'forward', 'most', 'telling', 'importance', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'quote', 'Lennon', 'were', 'performers', 'Liverpool', 'Hamburg', 'What', 'generated', 'was', 'fantastic', 'as', 'soon', 'made', 'edges', 'were', 'knocked', 'off', 'Brian', 'put', 'suits', 'that', 'made', 'very', 'very', 'big', ""'d"", 'sold', 'out', 'Beatles', 'died', 'then', 'musicians', 'never', 'improved', 'musicians', 'missed', 'club', 'when', 'were', 'playing', 'real', 'music']",N/A

In essence, he makes his point and the Beatles are found guilty as charged and should be ashamed of themselves. At the least, they should have provided a cut of the profits as to reward Peter for his work and helping them succeed. This peevish act of the Beatles is a smear on a musical legacy.One comment on some reviewers here who seem to think that Peter Best was holding up the success of the Beatles and that his sacking was neccessary. PUHLEEZEEEE!!! This is rock n roll folks not brain surgery.As someone who has played drums, if their is some problem a studio guy can get everyone over the hump and eventually the regular drummer can work it out. Look at Hal Baline doing studio work for Dennis Wilson. Was Denny sacked because he wasn't some genius on the drum kit? No, because his brothers loved him and worked with him and he stayed in the band.Pete Best never should have been sacked and it was a disgrace to have been involved with this mean spirited act. Pete should be given credit for carving out a life despite the negative actions of his former friends in the Beatles.
