87833,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,0790728354,audrey,"[10, 14]","What a mess!  Tolkien wrote 4 books -- The Hobbit and its sequel, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, made up of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King -- which together tell the story of the resurfacing and the destruction of the One Ring of Power wielded by Middle Earth's evil nemesis, Sauron.  The animated trilogy consists of The Hobbit and two films that should divide the trilogy in half, Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King, though so much material and so many characters are written out that they bear scant resemblance to the source material.  To further complicate matters, The Hobbit and The Return of the King are produced and directed by Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, the team that brought to television almost every holiday classic that concerns Santa Claus, Frosty, Rudolph or the Easter Bunny, while the second film, The Lord of the Rings, was directed by Raph Bakshi.  Confused yet?  It's important to remember these facts because, other than catering to your need to be comprehensive, you will most likely enjoy Bakshi's effort but should run from the other two as if hellhounds were on your tail.There is so much missing here (including dropping major characters that were in the second instament!) that you will never comprehend the story as written by Tolkien, and even more importantly, the ubiquitous songs are SO plentiful, SO saccharin and SO dated that you may damage your fingers trying to fast forward through them all. DVD extras are slim -- textual screens about Tolkien, Middle Earth and the cast &amp; crew that were on the previous disks.Voice talent is good:  John Huston narrates and plays Gandalf, Orson Bean repeats as Bilbo and Frodo, and Roddy McDowall comes on board as Sam.  Also, the animation of scenery and sets is very good, though weaker with the characters.  Great liberties are taken with Tolkien's material.  Great honking abysmal liberties.The word 'travesty' may be a bit strong, but not by much.  I am generally a forgiving Tolkien fan, and indeed I enjoyed the animated Lord of the Rings directed by Bakshi just fine, but this is drek by a team that treated Tolkien as if he were just Jack Frost with hobbits.  For example, when he runs to Gandalf to let him know that Denethor is attempting suicide, Pippin yells, &quot;He's gone loony I tell ya!&quot;  I don't think you have to be a Tolkien geek to think that's just wrongThis film may appeal to the very young or the very deaf, but for anyone who has read the books, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this song-filled pillage of the 20th century's greatest work of literature.",2,Yikes!

87837,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0790728354,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","First of all, I don't think it's fair to compare this 1980 version of ""Return of the King"" to the eventual Peter Jackson version. PJ had much more money and technological resources available.I would like to point out that I prefer the 1977 animated ""The Hobbit"" to the 2012 version. Also, I have respect for the 1978 ""Lord of the Rings.""Now, to the subject at hand. This final story starts with Bilbo having his 129th birthday. Gandalf, Elrond, Frodo, Pippin, and Merry are there. Bilbo seems unaware of the full potential the ring had to harm everyone. He is upset that Frodo has destroyed it. A moment later, he is surprised to see that Frodo has lost not only the ring, but the finger on which he wore it. A musician then comes in to tell Bilbo (as well as the audience) what happened so many years ago.Like I said, it isn't fair to compare this to the eventual Peter Jackson ""Return of the King."" But first of all, Faramir, Legolas, and Gimli are NEVER PRESENT. True, Aragorn is there. However, he has very little time on screen.Another thing is they try to make this film in the same style of ""The Hobbit."" By that I mean narration alternates with brief scenes of action. This worked very well in the 1977 animated ""The Hobbit."" But that was because ""The Hobbit"" was a story of a hobbit's journey that involved SOME violence.It doesn't work so well here. For example, Gandalf tries to confront the Witch King, and the Witch King says: ""No living man can kill me."" Then the scene ends. Did Gandalf just accept the words of the Witch King and walk away?Even if we avoid the temptation to compare it to the later Peter Jackson version, this animated version does have visible shortcomings.But now the good points. Despite its shortcomings, this version is still worth having. The music is beautiful. The animation carries a charm of its own. Roddy McDowall almost steals the film as Sam.Also, this film made some attempt to humanize the orcs a bit and allow us a moment of sympathy for them. Through clever use of an eerie song 'Where There's a Whip, There's a Way,' we see that the orcs are not so happy about going off to war. And add to that, Sam has a vision of a day where hobbits and orcs may walk by each other, smile, and wave.All in all, the film is flawed. But it does however have some good things about it. And it is worth having.My advice is to accept that this film came over 20 years before the Peter Jackson trilogy, accept that has its problems, and just give it a chance.",3,"Worth Having, But Missing Crucial Elements",1368403200,"05 13, 2013",2013,2491,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fair', 'compare', '1980', 'version', 'Return', 'King', 'eventual', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'PJ', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'money', 'technological', 'resources', 'available.I', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'prefer', '1977', 'animated', 'Hobbit', '2012', 'version', 'Also', 'have', 'respect', '1978', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Now', 'subject', 'hand', 'final', 'story', 'Bilbo', 'having', '129th', 'birthday', 'Gandalf', 'Elrond', 'Frodo', 'Pippin', 'Merry', 'are', 'there', 'Bilbo', 'unaware', 'full', 'potential', 'ring', 'had', 'harm', 'everyone', 'upset', 'Frodo', 'destroyed', 'moment', 'later', 'surprised', 'see', 'Frodo', 'lost', 'not', 'only', 'ring', 'finger', 'wore', 'musician', 'then', 'tell', 'Bilbo', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'what', 'happened', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'said', ""n't"", 'fair', 'compare', 'eventual', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Return', 'King', 'first', 'Faramir', 'Legolas', 'Gimli', 'are', 'NEVER', 'PRESENT', 'True', 'Aragorn', 'there', 'However', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'screen.Another', 'thing', 'try', 'make', 'film', 'same', 'style', 'Hobbit', 'mean', 'narration', 'alternates', 'brief', 'scenes', 'action', 'worked', 'very', 'well', '1977', 'animated', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'Hobbit', 'was', 'story', 'hobbit', 'journey', 'involved', 'SOME', 'violence.It', ""n't"", 'work', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'example', 'Gandalf', 'confront', 'Witch', 'King', 'Witch', 'King', 'No', 'living', 'man', 'can', 'kill', 'Then', 'scene', 'Did', 'Gandalf', 'just', 'accept', 'words', 'Witch', 'King', 'walk', 'away', 'Even', 'avoid', 'temptation', 'compare', 'later', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'animated', 'version', 'have', 'visible', 'shortcomings.But', 'now', 'good', 'points', 'shortcomings', 'version', 'still', 'worth', 'having', 'music', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'charm', 'own', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'almost', 'film', 'Sam.Also', 'film', 'made', 'attempt', 'humanize', 'orcs', 'bit', 'allow', 'moment', 'sympathy', 'clever', 'use', 'eerie', 'song', 'Whip', 'Way', 'see', 'orcs', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'happy', 'going', 'off', 'war', 'add', 'Sam', 'vision', 'day', 'where', 'hobbits', 'orcs', 'may', 'walk', 'other', 'smile', 'wave.All', 'film', 'flawed', 'however', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'worth', 'having.My', 'advice', 'accept', 'film', 'came', '20', 'years', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'trilogy', 'accept', 'problems', 'just', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

I mean what is a movie with out someone killing something else? Nothing. That is how society now works, thats crap. This DVD takes a look at the real version of Lord of the Rings. Yes, this movie has action. It isnt a gore fest but it's action. This animated version of the book actually follows the book step by step, everything the book has, except for the beginning with the flash-backs. This movie is sort of like a musical with songs, and war songs that fit the story line. My personal favorite from this movie is ""Where there is a whip"" I like it because of the well, beat that it moves at. At a slow disgruntled pace just like the way the orc's sing it.The movie begins with a party, with Elrond, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin and good old uncle Bilbo. It's Bilbo's birthday party, and they are about to cut the cake but everytime Bilbo is about to cut it he falls asleep. ""Will he ever cut the cake?"" says Merry. Very funny childly humor, so during this time Bilbo notice's that Frodo is missing a finger. So Gandalf brings in a minstrel who has written a ballad of Frodo's adventure. So he begins to sing his song, about Frodo.The ballad begins when Frodo was captured in the tower (like in the book, some of you think that it doesn't on account of Peter Jacksons films but they're wrong) Sam is trying to save Frodo, but runs into obstacles on the way, like an invisble wall. The true power of the ring and its mind bending torture and Orcs. Meanwhile at Minas Tirith, Gandalf is prepping for battle with Gondor. Mostly everything that happens in the book happens during the Minas Tirith parts, well all of the movie is accurate to the book. If you watch the Peter Jackson films and think that everything is accurate your wrong. I'm not saying the Peter Jackson films are bad. I'm definately not saying that, they're superb.If you are a ""Rings"" fans, I strongly suggest you watch this Musical version of ""Return of the King"" it features the voice of Orson Bean the voice of Frodo and Bilbo from the Hobbit Feature.

Having read the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings Several times since then, I can only use one word to describe how watching this movie now that I am an adult made me feel: aghast. The movie starts off with Bilbo's final birthday before he leaves Middle-Earth, the number of which they promptly got wrong, and Bilbo cannot remember why Frodo no longer had the Ring. Then they bring a minstrel out to tell him why. The tale they tell from that point is very much disjointed and far removed from the story that the Professor created, touching it and coming back to it only when whatever demagogue who controlled this production's direction felt like a little veracity. The whole story is given as a narrative from the point of view of Gandalf, and Gandalf in this story is not even a shadow of the one in the books.The specific points that make this production so horrid are:Aragorn is portrayed as a lord driven into exile, as opposed to the heir of a line of kings who have stopped claiming the title of king because they are too busy trying to rebuild their kingdom in the North, as well as supporting the kingdom in the South;the whole story is supposed to take place according to a Prophecy, when in fact the Lord of the Rings had nothing to do with prophecy and the only foretelling in it was about the paths of the dead;the voices, while all talented, were miscast, particularly the Lord of the Nazghul and Meriadoc(Kasey Kasem just does NOT work as a hobbit);they had to throw in the element that this was a proto-history that took place in our world which was exactly not what the Professor intended(Gandalf's disertation and ascertation that hobbits were going to evolve into men at the end of the movie was really, really too much);the dialogue of the hobbits was almost completely made out of anything other than what the Professor wrote,the dialogue of the other characters being not much better;they cut out all mention of the quest, the fellowship, the dwarves, and stripped out of it all the background history that makes this such a rich story. To sum-up, they raped this story, and raped perfectly describes it. I see no merit in any adult watching this production.As to why this production is so bad, I can only speculate. My hypotheses are as follows:they could not finish it before they ran out of money;they needed a quick influx of cash to keep from going out of business;they thought that nothing could be worse than Ralph Bakshi's production( they could not be more wrong:this production's existence makes that production five star by comparison/at least he tried to not mess anything up);they thought they were untouchable;mass-insanity;someone influential in the production had an attack of megalomania;several people important to the production died or were lost in a contract dispute and they had to go with an out-line;or they simply wanted to anger the family of the Professor to such a degree that they would never give permission to cinema-ize the works again.I have tried to keep my possible explanations from being too far-fetched, but this is the worst adaptation of any book that I have encountered. The best thing about it is the animation, and the best thing that can be said about that was that it was a knife taken to a gunfight. It is written as propaganda that has no ideal to uphold, and I had to force myself to finish watching it, several hours later than I started it. I would give it no stars if the option were availible, and if this production were a book, the publishing house would have burned it.",1,No Title can describe this(grammar corrected),1067558400,"10 31, 2003",2003,3613,"['watched', 'movie', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'child', 'Having', 'read', 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Several', 'times', 'then', 'can', 'only', 'use', 'one', 'word', 'describe', 'how', 'watching', 'movie', 'now', 'am', 'adult', 'made', 'feel', 'aghast', 'movie', 'Bilbo', 'final', 'birthday', 'Middle-Earth', 'number', 'promptly', 'got', 'wrong', 'Bilbo', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'why', 'Frodo', 'no', 'longer', 'had', 'Ring', 'Then', 'bring', 'minstrel', 'out', 'tell', 'why', 'tale', 'tell', 'point', 'very', 'much', 'disjointed', 'far', 'removed', 'story', 'Professor', 'created', 'touching', 'coming', 'back', 'only', 'when', 'demagogue', 'who', 'controlled', 'production', 'direction', 'felt', 'little', 'veracity', 'whole', 'story', 'given', 'narrative', 'point', 'view', 'Gandalf', 'Gandalf', 'story', 'not', 'even', 'shadow', 'one', 'books.The', 'specific', 'points', 'make', 'production', 'so', 'horrid', 'are', 'Aragorn', 'portrayed', 'lord', 'driven', 'exile', 'opposed', 'heir', 'line', 'kings', 'who', 'have', 'stopped', 'claiming', 'title', 'king', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'kingdom', 'North', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'kingdom', 'South', 'whole', 'story', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'according', 'Prophecy', 'when', 'fact', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'prophecy', 'only', 'foretelling', 'was', 'paths', 'dead', 'voices', 'talented', 'were', 'miscast', 'particularly', 'Lord', 'Nazghul', 'Meriadoc', 'Kasey', 'Kasem', 'just', 'NOT', 'work', 'hobbit', 'had', 'throw', 'element', 'was', 'proto-history', 'took', 'place', 'world', 'was', 'exactly', 'not', 'what', 'Professor', 'intended', 'Gandalf', 'disertation', 'ascertation', 'hobbits', 'were', 'going', 'evolve', 'men', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'hobbits', 'was', 'almost', 'completely', 'made', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'Professor', 'wrote', 'dialogue', 'other', 'characters', 'being', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'cut', 'out', 'mention', 'quest', 'fellowship', 'dwarves', 'stripped', 'background', 'history', 'such', 'rich', 'story', 'sum-up', 'raped', 'story', 'raped', 'perfectly', 'see', 'merit', 'adult', 'watching', 'production.As', 'why', 'production', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'hypotheses', 'are', 'could', 'not', 'finish', 'ran', 'money', 'needed', 'quick', 'influx', 'cash', 'keep', 'going', 'business', 'thought', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'production', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'wrong', 'production', 'existence', 'production', 'five', 'star', 'comparison/at', 'least', 'tried', 'not', 'mess', 'anything', 'up', 'thought', 'were', 'untouchable', 'mass-insanity', 'someone', 'influential', 'production', 'had', 'attack', 'megalomania', 'several', 'people', 'important', 'production', 'died', 'were', 'lost', 'contract', 'dispute', 'had', 'go', 'out-line', 'simply', 'wanted', 'anger', 'family', 'Professor', 'such', 'degree', 'would', 'never', 'give', 'permission', 'cinema-ize', 'works', 'again.I', 'have', 'tried', 'keep', 'possible', 'explanations', 'being', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'worst', 'adaptation', 'book', 'have', 'encountered', 'best', 'thing', 'animation', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'was', 'knife', 'taken', 'gunfight', 'written', 'propaganda', 'ideal', 'uphold', 'had', 'force', 'finish', 'watching', 'several', 'hours', 'later', 'started', 'would', 'give', 'stars', 'option', 'were', 'availible', 'production', 'were', 'book', 'publishing', 'house', 'would', 'have', 'burned']",N/A

87850,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0790728354,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[20, 30]","For all the fuss about problematic portrayals, additions and omissions in Bakshi and Jackson's LOTR productions, nothing ever came close to this. This movie only barely resembles the climax of Tolkien's masterpiece -- and in many areas, it doesn't resemble that! Their production of ""Hobbit"" was far better.This movie attempts to wrap up the story that Ralph Bakshi's darker, more serious and better-made ""Lord of the Rings"" began (and was not finished, due to lack of finances). We have Frodo and Sam struggling through Mordor with orcs and the creepy Gollum coming after them, Gandalf and Merry and Pippin trying to defend Gondor from hordes of orcs and a hysterically insane Denethor, and Aragorn is off on a ship striking kingly poses.Perhaps one of the most unforgivable things done here is character omission: Legolas and Gimli. Everyone's favorite elf and dwarf are completely absent, apparently because they aren't vital to the plot. That is irrelevant -- they rounded out the cast of characters to include all the Free Peoples, and added a little wry humor to it as well. (Though Rankin-Bass would probably have shown them as a garden gnome and a distended Yoda, as they did in ""Hobbit"", so maybe it's just as well) Other fan favorites that are nowhere to be seen are Arwen, Eomer, Faramir, Saruman, Imrahil, Rosie Cotton, and uncounted others.And the characters who are retained aren't really recognizable from the other LOTR productions or from the book. Frodo seems to be sleepwalking through ninety-five percent of the movie, without the childlike sweetness of Bakshi's Frodo or the adorable, wide-eyed solemnity of Elijah Wood/Peter Jackson's. He never gives any feeling of real temptation toward the Ring; and if he whined about physical weakness or addressed Sam as ""dear Sam"" one more time, I was going to throw up. He is also unconvincing in the fight with Gollum: There are lines from the book, but he delivers them with all the pain and anguish of a paper cut victim. Sam has the same personality as Frodo, and just as boring; he talks a lot to himself and to the Ring, and exhibits Shakespearean verbosity -- which, as we all know, is not how the sweet, humble gardener talks! Aragorn has apparently been attacked by a personality vampire, as he does nothing but pose, make ultra-serious pronouncements, and call Gandalf ""wizard.""Eowyn is also sucked dry of all personality. There is no reason for her to ride with her uncle's army (as there is in the book), and once she's killed the Witch King she vanishes except for a cameo at the end. Merry and Pippin are interchangeable and boring (one is a beanpole and the other is a blob. The Entwash is also edited out -- and the explanation for why they are taller than Frodo will elicit screams of pain from Tolkien fans). Bilbo is almost senile. Gollum appears for about five minutes -- and he's a giant green frog. Denethor is a raving loon with no firm reason to be so. Gandalf is too deadpan to be convincing, and his true nature as an Istar is ignored completely (why is he saying ""we're old""? He's immortal) The Witch King, lord of the Nazgul, is turned from a menacing and hideous demonic creature into a bizarre Disney villain with a nails-on-chalkboard cackle.Another problem is the setup. It's a little hard to be worried for any of the main characters when we see them chatting and relaxing at the end -- everything is in flashback. And little or no explanation is given for the characters: Do Merry and Pippin know Frodo? Why is Gandalf wearing different clothes? Why is Merry so upset about Theoden? Why is Sam so desperate to rescue Frodo? How did Frodo get captured in the first place? Why does Gollum say ""wicked master [Frodo] cheats us""? Who is Galadriel and where did Frodo get the vial? (Readers of the books will know, but if you simply watch you won't have a clue)Terrible direction peppers the whole thing. All the villains cackle maniacally, while the heroes talk in a monotonous deadpan manner -- except for a few exceptions. When they get really upset, they cry or yell. And one confrontation is downright silly, even by kiddie standards: Frodo's maniacal laughter made me giggle out loud, and Sam lets loose a melodramatic ""Nooooooooooo!"" that would put Luke Skywalker to shame. Sam's temptation fantasy will have you rolling on the floor. And when your heroes are all of three and a half feet tall, it's a little hard for them to look menacing and sinister -- EVER.As for the new cover for the movie... um, what is that? What horse is that? Why are there TWO Sams on the horse? Why are there two generic dwarves on it, when no dwarves are featured in this film? What are those two castles?Scripting is also terrible. They intersperse bits of dialogue from the book in all the wrong places, resulting in the heroes saying nothing during ""dead"" moments, and talking endlessly during crises. ""Thees"", ""thous"", ""nays"" and ""yeas"" are sprinkled seemingly at random, and other formal bits of speech crop up a lot. And WHY won't that annoying minstrel shut up about ""Frodooooooo of the Niiiiiine Fingers""?This movie should never have been made, period. Watch ""Hobbit,"" watch Bakshi's LOTR, and if you want to see the finale of the trilogy, wait a couple years and see how Peter Jackson does it.

Given the venomous vibs against this film, you would think it was a musical vaudeville remake of The Godfather.  Sure, the animation is not up to Disney standards, but remember that this was a 1980s TV production, not a big budget theatrical release. The film focuses on the two hobbits, Frodo and Samwise, as they near the completion of their quest to destroy the One Ring; in its own way, the film is actually quite faithful to the spirit of the novel. Though the film may appear as a children's film, it is neither juvenile nor dumbed-down in its presentation. Yes, there are songs in this Middle-Earth tale (most all Rankin-Bass productions had songs), but have people actually listened to the lyrics? The songs are quite stirring and well-crafted; give them a chance. For instance, ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers"" starts the film on an immediate note of uncertainty and suspense and draws the audience quickly into the story, which is important considering that this film is a sequel to...nothing! (There were no prior Rankin-Bass productions of Fellowship or Two Towers, just an UNRELATED theatrical animated Lord of the Rings around this time).  Other songs also impart some valuable lessons, of which my favorite is ""It's So Easy Not to Try.""This isn't a typical kiddie film where everything ends happily after ever.  The film deals honestly with death, duty, and friendship.  In many ways, these themes can be found also in Rankin-Bass' likewise mature, animated production of The Last Unicorn, a film with a massive cult following.  Watch The Last Unicorn, then re-watch The Return of the King.

The mystery and dark tidings of Middle-Earth captivated my attention, and soon after I began reading the original works.  So I'll say one good thing about these adaptations: in the very least, they inspired a child to read.Unfortunately, fourteen years later the `nostalgia-cloud' has evaporated: recently I viewed `Return of the King' with a friend, and was thoroughly shocked at this pastiche mess of an adaptation.  The animation is adequate, barely.  Gandalf delivers his lines with the woodenness of a WB teen star.  The Nazgul resemble KISS groupies.  Frodo is an unsympathetic runt with oversized eyes; Pippin is a cockney-blathering bloke appearently raised on the bad food and bad weather of lower-class London.  The Witch-king, with his steel crown and glowing eyes and invisible head, inspired nightmarish awe in me at twelve; now, when the wretch throws back its hood with a screech of electronic laughter, my friend and I burst into derisive laughter.  And don't get me started on those John Denver-esque songs, delivered in prompt ten-minute intervals--obviously meant to extend this into 90 minutes, they start as annoying and quickly devolve into teeth-grinding badness...

I just assumed that this horrid wretch of a production was quietly swept under a very thick rug many years ago and certainly would have been quickly shuffled away after the Peter Jackson films were released.I saw this as a child of about 12 years old.  I thought it was mildly interesting but then I read the books.  BAM right in my face.  This movie took the (arguably) most wonderful fantasy story ever told and reduced it to a trite, banal story for 6 year olds raised on Saturday morning cartoons.  I can still see the orcs singing ""where there's a whip, there's a way"" and hear Gandalf explain to the hobbits that ""each year the hobbits are getting bigger, maybe there's a little hobbit in YOU"" as he broke the ""3rd wall"" and spoke directly to the audience.  At 12 years old I found this insulting, as an adult I don't think I could hold this DVD in my hand without feeling rage enough to snap it in half.I also assumed that this DVD would have no more than an average of 1 1/2 stars.  Color me surprised.  The only argument for more than a 1 star rating that I've read that makes the slightest of sense is that the Peter Jackson movies are too grown up for the younger crowd and this is a good introduction to Middle Earth.  That reasoning is spurious.  First, though the Peter Jackson movie is clearly not for kids, the books are.  Have the young ones read the Hobbit (or *gasp!* read it to them yourself) and when they are about 10 or 12, have them read the books.  At about 13 or 14 they will be old enough to handle the imagery of the movies and will (even better) have read the books too.  Second, Having them watch this movie doesn't give them an introduction to Middle Earth, it gives away THE ENDING!  There are many excellent movies that children aren't ready for, do we prepare the kids by telling them how it ends?  Ridiculous.

Or... you can make it a drinking game! Every time the narrator or a character mispronounces a name or place, take a drink. If the pronounciation was made explicit in the book, as with THE'oden or KIRith Ungol, take two. When they make up stupid dialogue, or when they actually stick to dialogue (it does happen!), take a drink. When they burst into a song suggested by a single line of the book (i.e. ""where there's a whip there's a will""), take a drink. When they skip over huge events and pretend they never happened (like Aragorn seeming not to know about the quest of the ring), just down the whole bottle. The movie is probably a lot more fun for an adult when you're drunk.It does have its good features.  While the animation is not and never was state-of-the-art, the backgrounds are, I think, quite lovely -- all moody, evocative watercolors.  While the songs are not exactly canon (as they are in ""The Hobbit""), they make sense in the context of the movie (where the tale is being told by a bard, who is actually canon).And it's a lot of fun for kids. My sister and I saw this on TV about 18 years ago, and will still laugh ourselves silly with the songs. (We did a rendition of ""Frodo of the Nine Fingers"" that went, ""Frodo of the no earlobe, and the earring of doom... Frodo of the no breath, and the Dentene of doom..."" etc.) My son, two years old, learned the word ""Frodo"" from the movie, which was very cute to my husband and I, both Tolkien fans.If you prefer your Tolkien unadulterated, don't watch this.

87859,A1J4RAKN3MSUWH,0790728354,"J. Collins ""JCollins""","[1, 3]","I strongly recommend potential viewers of this telefilm abandon ALL expectations regarding Tolkien lore before hitting ""play"". This animated story wasn't made to fill the gap left after Bakshi's feature film, or even ""complete"" the Rankin/Bass ""Hobbit"" adaptation. Instead, it's a hodgepodge chronology lifted from LOTR's ""Return of the King""...and a pretty shrewd one at that. R&B; likely balked at the task of making three LOTR installments; the same scale and financial demands applied as with adaptations in the traditional film business. Left with a choice of which (manageable) story within LOTR to bring to television, R&B; wisely choose the events preceding LOTR's climax.The movie opens on Bilbo's 129th birthday at Rivendell, some time after the destruction of the One Ring. Flashbacks quickly ensue, and viewers are brought short with Samwise outside the walls of Cirith Ungol. From this point, the major events from ""The Return of the King"" unfold, though story emphasis is given to Sam and Frodo's relationship as they traverse Mordor. The inclusion of scenes from the siege of Minas Tirith are a small gift for Tolkien fans, but they are also a minor distraction in the context of this production.I should also add that this movie's soundtrack is overripe with folky ""message songs,"" an obvious sop to young children who are unfamiliar with adult responsibilities and relationships. The music would be an incidental annoyance for older viewers, if not for the nasal trilling of Glen Yarbrough, which defies even a deaf ear. Unless you have children doting on the singalong soundtrack, keep your finger near the ""fast forward"" or ""mute"" key. Take a minute to listen to the ""Where There's A Whip, There's A Way"" musical interlude, during Sam & Frodo's march with the orcs of Mordor.  The lyrics are humorous and/or amusing on several levels, a rarity in the rest of the soundtrack.As others have mentioned here, the animation in this movie is pretty poor fare, but wholly in keeping with both ""The Hobbit"" and Rankin/Bass' standard adaptations. Everyone, ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" is craggy, or just ugly. This in itself isn't a major fault, unless you are expecting the type of glamor painting found in Tolkien calendars and the like. The animation is charmingly old-fashioned, and the color tones in this transfer are appropriately rustic.Though the script for this adaptation is patched together, occasionally a bit of genuine Tolkien dialogue pops up, or a minor detail from the book is carefully included. These little touches are what save the movie from being a throwaway, or a kids-only flick. If Tolkien fans are willing to ignore the occasional pronunciation flub or thematic error, they should be able to find something to enjoy in this DVD. Certainly, there is much more to find fault with in this production, but why watch it if your only motivation is the desire to criticize?Adolescents who are fond of fantasy may well find this film a good jumping off point, before tackling the actual books in the LOTR.

For its time, it was an entertaining look at the last segment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Keep in mind that this was targeted at a younger audience, especially those who watched the animated Hobbit film. I recall watching this in middle school, my first taste of the fantasy genre.And I will admit, I did compare one scene from the animated Return of the King (1980) with the live-action Return of the King (2003). It was the scene with Eowyn facing off against the Lord of the Nazguls. The animated movie hewed closer to the book in that more of the actual dialogue was used.Eowyn's speech is a bit wordy and seems more at place in a stage play than in a fast moving battle. But I did enjoy how it paused the momentum of the Battle of Pelenor Fields and you get this beauty standing on the battlefield with her long blonde hair flowing in the wind like a banner of courage. I was hoping for equal treatment from Peter Jackson, but he kept this scene short. It is a critical moment in Eowyn's character development.",3,There seems to be a bit of confusion,1085529600,"05 26, 2004",2004,1337,"['review', 'here', 'dated', 'May', '24', '2004', 'anonymous', 'viewer', 'NJ', 'home', 'state', 'CONFUSED', 'animated', 'movie', 'recently', 'released', 'Peter', 'Jackson-', 'Return', 'King', 'DVD.THESE', 'ARE', 'TWO', 'ENTIRELY', 'DIFFERENT', 'FILMS', 'MADE', 'MORE', 'THAN', '20', 'YEARS', 'APART.The', 'animated', 'Return', 'King', 'was', 'TV', 'special', 'released', '1980', 'time', 'was', 'entertaining', 'look', 'last', 'segment', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'Keep', 'mind', 'was', 'targeted', 'younger', 'audience', 'especially', 'who', 'watched', 'animated', 'Hobbit', 'film', 'recall', 'watching', 'middle', 'school', 'first', 'taste', 'fantasy', 'genre.And', 'will', 'admit', 'did', 'compare', 'one', 'scene', 'animated', 'Return', 'King', '1980', 'live-action', 'Return', 'King', '2003', 'was', 'scene', 'Eowyn', 'facing', 'off', 'Lord', 'Nazguls', 'animated', 'movie', 'hewed', 'closer', 'book', 'more', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'was', 'used.Eowyn', 'speech', 'bit', 'wordy', 'more', 'place', 'stage', 'play', 'fast', 'moving', 'battle', 'did', 'enjoy', 'how', 'paused', 'momentum', 'Battle', 'Pelenor', 'Fields', 'get', 'beauty', 'standing', 'battlefield', 'long', 'blonde', 'hair', 'flowing', 'wind', 'banner', 'courage', 'was', 'hoping', 'equal', 'treatment', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'kept', 'scene', 'short', 'critical', 'moment', 'Eowyn', 'character', 'development']",N/A

87864,A3VE5XJZ4MMWWH,0790728354,"Kyle Bolme ""Kyle""","[5, 17]","Watching this movie is the most fun I've ever had in my ilfe.  It is absolutely the worst movie that has ever been made, and it's so so funny to see how STUPID they made this.  You can tell straight from the beginning.  Just listen to that guy's voice.  You know, the guy with so much vibrato you can't tell which one of the 10 notes he's actually trying to sing.  I was rolling on the ground in hysterics when I heard his singing voice.The Return of the King was not by Bakshi.  It was by the guys who made the Hobbit movie (which was actually pretty good): Rankin and Bass.  But there is one difference between the Hobbit and Return of the King: they really messed up in Return of the King.  This might be because the cutesy-wutesy-ness actually worked in the Hobbit.  But Return of the King is a much darker book.  At least, so I thought.  Maybe they didn't think that.For one thing, how many Tolkien names can you mispronounce in one sentence?  ""Gore-uh-gore-uth"", ""Sore-awn"", ""Sear-ith Un-gawl"", ""Mine-us"" Tirith and Morgul, etc. etc. etc.For another thing, Glenn Yarbrough should be shot.  Although it is quite hysterical to listen to him sing.  Kind of like it's hysterical to watch the auditions for American Idol every year.  And Maury Laws should be shot too, at least if it weren't for ""Where there's a whip there's a way"", the only good song in the whole movie.  Which is ruined by the funny-looking orc choir, anyway.And how many times can you say ""festering malignance"" in  the first five minutes of a movie?  They say that so much that you wonder if they knew what the hell they were talking about.  ""Sore-awn's evil lay over the land like a festering malignance!""And the voice-actors should be shot too.  I'm not going to go into that--it would take me forever.But wait, there's more!  Where the they get the part about Hobbits eventually evolving into Men?  According to Tolkien, Hobbits are still around today.  They didn't EVOLVE into Men!  Seems like a terrible excuse to stick one of the corniest lines in the movie in: ""Men will look back and wonder... 'Is there Hobbit in me?'""  Tolkien must be rolling over in his grave every time somebody turns on this movie.And what's with the ringwraiths?  Or, as this movie puts it, skeletons with hair.Not to mention the weird voices for people like The Mouth of Sauron and the Lord of the Nazgul.  And Aragorn.  Speaking of which, why did they turn him into some sort of evil Hitler figure?  And why did he only get a cameo, anyway?  He was more important than that.  Plus the fact that Legolas and Gimli aren't shown or even mentioned at all.And what's with the SAMWISE THE STRONG segment?  Possibly the least emphasized part of the books, if it was in the books at all, has now been turned into the climactic  centerpiece of the first half of the movie.  Plus the fact that he goes on to console himself with images of little Hobbit babies.  And then there's Frodo's dream about a free Mordor.  I don't think I'm even going to go into that, or I'll start rambling even more than I already am.  I mean, seriously, the orc walks by and waves to Frodo as if they were the best friends in the world.  And was that a streak of a tear on Frodo's face as he waved back?  Ugh.And the eye of Sauron didn't look like an eye at all.  It looked like an oddly small red crystal ball.  Which doesn't make sense at all.  I didn't even know what it was until near the very end when I saw it was at the top of a tower.Also, the dialogue is absolutely absurd.  Just think about this exchange, after Denethor has ordered himself executed.Pippin: No!  You can't!Guard: His word is law.Pippin: I'll find Gandalf.What spontanaiety.And what's the point of showing Eowyn with Faramir at the very end, when you don't even know who the hell Faramir is?  Hello, this is a different movie than the Bakshi Lord of the Rings, and therefore Faramir looks different anyway!  Err... come to think of it, I can't remember if Faramir was even in the Bakshi film.  I think he was though.And why does it look like Theoden jumps off of his horse, instead of falling off?  And the horse should trample him or fall on him or something, because a fall of that little magnitude wouldn't hurt a guy enough to kill him.  Especially a tough guy like Theoden.  Or maybe that's another alteration from the book.  Theoden is a weakling?  Hmm.  Whatever.And their stuff about Bilbo falling asleep and not cutting the cake?  Was that supposed to be funny?  Oh.  Ha ha.  He's falling asleep.  What in the world could be more hysterical?That was sarcasm.I could go on and on.

Tolkien's works.  One has to bear in mind that it was an animated prime-time television special aimed at children, that it was intended to be at least halfway comprehensible to viewers whose only previous Middle-earth knowledge came from the Rankin-Bass ""Hobbit"", and that the filmmakers were apparently unable to use any material whatsoever from the previous two volumes of Tolkien's trilogy.Given all those restrictions and obstacles, it's amazing how good the Rankin-Bass RotK is and how much of Tolkien's work it captures.  Viewers get to see many elements of the book that were excluded from the Peter Jackson films, from little things like the all-white standard of the Stewards of Gondor to big moments like Sam feeling pity for Gollum on Mount Doom.  I also think Rankin-Bass' ending is sadder, and closer to the spirit of Tolkien's ending, than that of Jackson's trilogy.So I wholeheartedly recommend this film for younger viewers.

87866,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790728354,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","To be accurate, Ralph Bakshi's animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; only made it halfway through &quot;The Two Towers&quot; before suddenly concluding. My understanding was that because Bakshi did not get to &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; the rights were available for Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. to do their own version for television in 1980 in the same style they had employed for &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; In fact, Orson Bean is back to do the voices of not only Bilbo but also Frodo, and John Huston returns to provide a perefect voice for the wizard Gandalf.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; certainly begins in the middle of things, with Sam (Roddy McDowell) trying to rescue the captive Frodo from the orcs and Gollum scrambling after his &quot;precious&quot; ring. Those who have read the trilogy will be able to pick up the narrative without any problem, but for the uninitated who have to try and enjoy this without some sort of &quot;Previously on 'The Lord of the Ring,'&quot; it is going to be quiet disconcerting. Clearly this version is geared for the kids, in the grand tradition of &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which was far and away the best of these three animated Tolkein films. Adults will undoubtedly cringe at some of these moments, as when the Orcs sing &quot;Where There's a Whip There's a Way,&quot; but hopefully you will find a few small moments that you can enjoy. The chief charm of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; for me is that it does a decent job with my favorite scene of the Trilogy, when &Eacute;owyn, the shield maiden of Rohirrim engages the Lord of the Nazgul in mortal combat during the Battle of Pellennor Fields.Glenn Yarborough again does the music, as he did with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but with notably less success. Except for the first little ditty about &quot;Frodo of the Nine-Fingers and the Ring of Doom,&quot; the songs this time around add nothing to the telling of the tale. When you consider all the great moments from the book that were cut because of time constraints and then add to that list those that were jettisoned because of Yarborough's songs, it is the proverbial example of adding insult to injury.The best case scenario is to show young children &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; and use that as a way of inspiring them to read the book and then move on to the Trilogy or the Peter Jackson film's.

Don't get me wrong, its cool that they went through all that trouble to make this flik, but don't you think if your going to do it , shouldn,t you leave out all the musical numbers? Which brings me to my next point. Alot of these glowing reviews say that this is much better than Peter Jackson's version because it sticks more to the source material. WHAT! Where did that come from? I'm  sure Tolkien just forgot to write sappy seventies music every other chapter. Oh yeah, and he probably didn't want Legolas and Gimli in the third book anyhow. He just needed someone like Rankin to figure how to write them out. To bad Tolkien was already gone to fix his mistake.Best parts of the movie you say? Well seeing anything of Tolkien usually gives me goosebumps, and at least seeing the title brings some nice memories of the book and P.J.'s film. ( Finally the bumbling, fat faced cartoon version of Sam is purged from my mind!! Thank you Astin!!)Its almost worth viewing just to see the two greatest scences ever penciled on paper. (Just kidding). Frodo's lovely little dream with the orc wandering by and waving to him as if to say ""thanks for the tea!"" while he just lounges back against a tree has got to be seen to be believed. And the wonderful little song ""Where thrers a whip, Theres a way"" is hilarious. Orcs singing about not wanting to fight just tickled me all over. Can't believe Tolkien left out that part.But wait, there's more. The Witch King was just an electronic laugh just like in the Transformers. Really it was. And Gandalf? He was nothing more than somebody reading a script in a nice monotone voice that was even more perfected as the battles rose in a fevered pitch around him.All I can say is that even if you like it (or dare I say Love it), at least strike up the courage to say that the Peter Jackson version is closer to the book.ThanksOh yeah, I gave it two stars because at least it has Tolkien's name on it.",2,What Happened????,1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2020,"['am', 'stunned', 'rave', 'reviews', 'well', 'nonsensical', 'garbage', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'cool', 'went', 'trouble', 'make', 'flik', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'going', 'do', 't', 'leave', 'out', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Which', 'next', 'point', 'Alot', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'more', 'source', 'material', 'WHAT', 'Where', 'did', 'come', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Tolkien', 'just', 'forgot', 'write', 'sappy', 'seventies', 'music', 'other', 'chapter', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'Legolas', 'Gimli', 'third', 'book', 'anyhow', 'just', 'needed', 'someone', 'Rankin', 'figure', 'how', 'write', 'out', 'bad', 'Tolkien', 'was', 'already', 'gone', 'fix', 'mistake.Best', 'parts', 'movie', 'say', 'Well', 'seeing', 'anything', 'Tolkien', 'usually', 'goosebumps', 'least', 'seeing', 'title', 'nice', 'memories', 'book', 'P.J', 'film', 'Finally', 'bumbling', 'fat', 'faced', 'cartoon', 'version', 'Sam', 'purged', 'mind', 'Thank', 'Astin', 'almost', 'worth', 'viewing', 'just', 'see', 'two', 'greatest', 'scences', 'ever', 'penciled', 'paper', 'Just', 'kidding', 'Frodo', 'lovely', 'little', 'dream', 'orc', 'wandering', 'waving', 'say', 'thanks', 'tea', 'just', 'back', 'tree', 'got', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'wonderful', 'little', 'song', 'Where', 'thrers', 'whip', 'way', 'hilarious', 'Orcs', 'singing', 'not', 'wanting', 'fight', 'just', 'tickled', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tolkien', 'left', 'out', 'part.But', 'wait', 'more', 'Witch', 'King', 'was', 'just', 'electronic', 'laugh', 'just', 'Transformers', 'Really', 'was', 'Gandalf', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'somebody', 'reading', 'script', 'nice', 'monotone', 'voice', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'perfected', 'battles', 'rose', 'fevered', 'pitch', 'him.All', 'can', 'say', 'even', 'like', 'dare', 'say', 'least', 'strike', 'up', 'courage', 'say', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'version', 'closer', 'book.ThanksOh', 'yeah', 'gave', 'two', 'stars', 'least', 'Tolkien', 'name']",N/A

87875,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,0790728354,"Mike London ""MAC""","[11, 17]","I cannot believe the sheer number of negative reviews for this movie. Granted, THE HOBBIT was a more successful film. The reason is because these movies are for children, and written as such. THE HOBBIT does well in this situation because it is for children. THE RETURN OF THE KING not so much. The animation style is the same as THE HOBBIT. Gollum is good. The best part of this particular film is the sequence between Eowyn and the Witch-King of Angmar. That is well done. The Mouth of Sauron is also in there*. Orodruin is done well too.One thing I don't like about both films is current packaging. I bought them before they turned over, and each is well represented with original art from the film. These new covers, however, go totally away from the animation style used to convey Tolkien's world to the audience. Bad cover art. Almost as bad as the phallus on the original cover of THE LITTLE MERMAID.John Huston makes the ultimate Gandalf.  His voice sounds exactly like a Gandalf would sound.  One thing I don't like is in the end of the movie they have Gandalf imply hobbits evolved into men, which is against Tolkien's conceptions and his Christian view of the world and its inhabitants.THE RETURN OF THE KING suffers simply because of how much they had to cut away. One of the funniest things I have ever heard in the movies is here: they state of the first two books, over 800 pages, that Frodo and Sam had many brave adventures until they got the to gate of Cirith Ungol. Legolas and Gimli are nowhere to be seen. Aragorn is poorly portrayed, and based on interaction between him and Gandalf it seems they dislike each other, which is of course not true. You don't get the feel of Aragorn like you do in the books. There is much cut away from THE RETURN OF THE KING. The Scourging of the Shire has no place in this one. Indeed, they say it is based off Part III of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. But because of its limits, THE RETURN OF THE KING cannot adequately show the grandeur and epic scale of THE LORD OF THE RINGS.The best thing about this is it gets exposure to people that might otherwise not watch or know about Tolkien. This film in particular, because of its limited time and scope, does well in portraying the book. But lets face it, any 365 book that is adapted to a 98 minute movie is, of course, going to not be totally represented. Overall, they've done a good job on this film, considering the audience and that they've been able to shine just a little light on Tolkien's achievement. Of course, these two films (this and THE HOBBIT) are much better than that horrible Bakshi adaptation. (The animation was some of the most realistic, but the film itself was terrible). But between these three films, we still have not gotten a good picture of THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a whole. The last half of THE TWO TOWERS hasn't been touched at all. Lets hope this new three film version by Peter Jackson will be up to snuff. This will be live action, and I'm really looking forward too it.As I watched this as a child, the chief thing I remembered was the song &quot;The end of the ring, the return of the king.&quot; I never could find it when I read through the novel. Too bad...I liked that. For its effort and exposure to children - **** stars.*An interesting note: Aragorn says in THE TWO TOWERS that Sauron does not let his name be spelt or spoken, and then the ambassador says he is the Mouth of Sauron.

It was the audio recordings of Rankin&Bass;'s The Hobbit that I listen to before I ever picked up the book when I was about 8 or 9. I read and reread the book numerous times until I picked up the LOTR then reread that many of times before tackling the Simarrillion in 7th Grade. And later I read several of the other texts like Unfinished Tales and Lost Tales etc... so needless to say I am quite familiar with Tolkien from a young age so one might easily think I would naturally detest this version of his work. Far from it.While Return of the King certainly doesn't capture the accuracy of the book, it does capture the overall spirit of Tolkien's world and his views of good vs evil. It has a certain magic quality about it like those good children stories that stay with children and awaken nostalgic memories in adulthood. Some of the hatred of this is more from obsessive fanboys who don't really get the underlying spirit and magic of Tolkien's works. The songs are really good and often carry a good message.I really liked Sam's portrayal in this version  - he's stout and plain but not simple minded like the bumbling oaf in Ralph Bakeshi's version. I like Sam in the scene where he is tempted by the Ring but rejects it for the simple life of a gardner. Frodo is good as the suffering despairing hero who nonetheless struggles on despite his burden. And overall Gandalf voiced by the magnificent John Huston is the epitome of how Gandalf should sound. The scene where he faces the Witch King is especially moving.This movie is not for anyone over 12 and who never saw it when they were under 12.

Both are made for a younger audience.Overall, I prefer Return of the King because of the songs. Although I don't hate them, I'm not a big fan of folk-type songs. Return of the King has more songs that are easier for me to listen to. I prefer the deeper voices used in the songs that make use of a chorus.Since I haven't read the book, I can't comment on what might be missing.

The guy who keeps singing, all through the film, over and over again, was mind-numbingly irritating.  He really wrecked the whole thing.  It was as if Rankin and Bass wanted to make a musical, and not a film portraying the dire events in Tolkein's tale.  There was a song in nearly every scene!  The only things the characters were missing, during these warbling little sing-song episodes, were ice-skates.  Ugh!  One other point that spoiled the film was the poorly contrived dialogue.  Granted, this word-waxing excess was somewhat present in the Rankin/Bass release of The Hobbit, but not to the overblown, and wretchedly unabashed heights of this production.  It just didn't carry very well at all: especially when Samwise is talking to himself, like some Shakespearean sycophant on an amphetamine binge, while Frodo is locked in the tower.  The Bible had less &quot;thee's&quot; and &quot;thou's&quot; strung through it's whole breadth than were encapsulated in that one scene.  My advice is to enjoy Rankin/Bass's version of The Hobbit, (where exposure to bad singing, and over-emphasis, are muted by some very good craftsmanship), then get Bakshi's Lord of the Rings, (because THAT is as good a movie adaptation, for this story, as we have gotten: to this date), skip Rankin/Bass's Return of the King, (it's just not what it could have been, and if you're of an age above 10 it will probably nauseate you) and get ready for the LOTR Trilogy movies, starting Christmas 2001! (Don't forget Tolkien's books, though.  They are better than any film about them will ever hope to be.

Of course, it was only the first half of the trilogy and I was eagerly looking forward to seeing the second half.  But for reasons unknown to me, the creative team behind LOTR did not film the second half.Alas, Return of the King was made for television by the same team behind 'The Hobbit'.  Consequently, the quality of the animation suffered, plus many of the characters were not properly portrayed.  For example, Gollum was once a hobbit himself, and in LOTR he appears as he should.  But in Return of the King he looks like some giant frog.  Merry and Pippin also looked ridiculous.  I agree with some of the other critics and was turned off by a lot of the singing too.  When I first saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel that all of us LOTR fans were cheated out of seeing a more authentic rendition of the rest of the story.  Return of the King is more geared towards young children, whereas LOTR can be appreciated by teens and adults, particularly the depiction of the battle scenes.But the goods news is that the LOTR trilogy is currently being filmed in its entirely and there is a hope that Tolkien's classic work will get its definitive rendition on the silver screen.

""The Hobbit"" was much better than this crap. They should have called it ""Frodo and Sam"", considering 95% of the movie is their side of the story (Book 6 of LOTR). The King isn't really in this movie, Aragorn's in it for maybe 60-70 seconds at most. My favorite part is when Sam decides to abandon Frodo and destroy the ring himself. After 10 minutes and 2 musical numbers he comes to his senses and goes back. My other favorite part is when Theoden is killed by dark clouds when his horse goes crazy.
