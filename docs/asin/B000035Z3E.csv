516678,A1LGDLGQXO4XO0,B000035Z3E,Jackie Morton,"[0, 0]","I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that they may have lost a step or two, but Detective Dooley and his four-legged partner Jerry Lee are still fighting crime with their band of heroics and hilarity. Now reluctantly partnered with a younger K-9 team: the beautiful, no-nonsense detective named Welles and her highly-disciplined Doberman, Zeus. Dooley figures he needs Welles and Zeus like a hole in the head and he nearly gets one when a mysterious attacker tries to gun him down. Reluctantly, Dooley and Jerry Lee make a plan with their new partners to trap the madman and then spring into action as fast as their legs will carry them! With its entertaining mix of action and laughs, K-911 spells fun for everyone.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",5,K-911,1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,872,"['choose', 'rating', 'movie', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'step', 'two', 'Detective', 'Dooley', 'four-legged', 'partner', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'are', 'still', 'fighting', 'crime', 'band', 'heroics', 'hilarity', 'Now', 'reluctantly', 'partnered', 'younger', 'K-9', 'team', 'beautiful', 'no-nonsense', 'detective', 'named', 'Welles', 'highly-disciplined', 'Doberman', 'Zeus', 'Dooley', 'Welles', 'Zeus', 'hole', 'head', 'nearly', 'one', 'when', 'mysterious', 'attacker', 'tries', 'gun', 'down', 'Reluctantly', 'Dooley', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'make', 'plan', 'new', 'partners', 'trap', 'madman', 'then', 'spring', 'action', 'as', 'fast', 'legs', 'will', 'carry', 'entertaining', 'mix', 'action', 'laughs', 'K-911', 'fun', 'everyone', 'What', 'dislike', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'people']",N/A
516679,ATSNSN593RYIG,B000035Z3E,James Edwards,"[3, 4]","For anyone who saw K-9 (1989), this is police dog Jerry Lee, and his handler officer Dooley, of the LAPD, back again 10 years later. However, for the 1999 sequel they are teamed up with police dog Zeus and his handler  sergeant Welles. The actors are Jim Belushi (Dooley), Christine Tucci  (Welles), Mac the German Sheperd (Jerry Lee), and Lucan the Doberman  Pinscher (Zeus). There are two themes to the story. The first is a worry  that Jerry Lee might be getting to old for the job. The second concern is  that a crazy stalker wants to rub Dooley out. (Apparantly Dooley made a  disparaging remark about this person's manuscript for a film! Anyway, he  has taken the slight very personally, and has decided to use Dooley as  target practice) So for his safety and protection sergeant Welles along  with Zeus (who answers to Dutch commands) are assigned to help him figure  out who the crazy might be and arrest the person. Initially, this foursome  are not happy campers (they drive around in Dooley's 1967 Mustang  convertible - until it's blown up with a surface to surface missile) and  Zeus lets Dooley know he takes no instructions except from sergeant Welles.  The script runs like a comic book and so does the action, but the dogs are  a joy to watch and Belushi and Tucci work well with the canines. Universal  never released K911 never to the big screen. It was released strait to  video.",2,Dog picture!,945907200,"12 23, 1999",1999,1400,"['anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'K-9', '1989', 'police', 'dog', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'handler', 'officer', 'Dooley', 'LAPD', 'back', 'again', '10', 'years', 'later', 'However', '1999', 'sequel', 'are', 'teamed', 'up', 'police', 'dog', 'Zeus', 'handler', 'sergeant', 'Welles', 'actors', 'are', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Dooley', 'Christine', 'Tucci', 'Welles', 'Mac', 'German', 'Sheperd', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'Lucan', 'Doberman', 'Pinscher', 'Zeus', 'are', 'two', 'themes', 'story', 'first', 'worry', 'Jerry', 'Lee', 'might', 'be', 'getting', 'old', 'job', 'second', 'concern', 'crazy', 'stalker', 'rub', 'Dooley', 'out', 'Apparantly', 'Dooley', 'made', 'disparaging', 'remark', 'person', 'manuscript', 'film', 'Anyway', 'taken', 'slight', 'very', 'personally', 'decided', 'use', 'Dooley', 'target', 'practice', 'So', 'safety', 'protection', 'sergeant', 'Welles', 'Zeus', 'who', 'Dutch', 'commands', 'are', 'assigned', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'crazy', 'might', 'be', 'arrest', 'person', 'Initially', 'foursome', 'are', 'not', 'happy', 'campers', 'drive', 'Dooley', '1967', 'Mustang', 'convertible', 'blown', 'up', 'surface', 'surface', 'missile', 'Zeus', 'Dooley', 'know', 'instructions', 'sergeant', 'Welles', 'script', 'comic', 'book', 'so', 'action', 'dogs', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'Belushi', 'Tucci', 'work', 'well', 'canines', 'Universal', 'never', 'released', 'K911', 'never', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'released', 'strait', 'video']",N/A
