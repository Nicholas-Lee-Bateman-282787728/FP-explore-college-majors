In other words, if you are going to buy only one Girls Aloud concert video, I recommend the Out of Control concert live at the O2 instead of this one.  Unless you must have the songs featured in this concert instead I suppose...  Nevertheless, this is still pretty good, although in hindsight I probably wouldn't have purchased it.  But I just had to find out what format this came in to see if it would play on my North American PS3.  Doesn't the listing say NTSC, and isn't that what I want?  Anyway, the one I received is in PAL format and my PS3 will not play it.  My PC will play it though...",3,Not too bad... and it is PAL.,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,836,"['Not', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'great', 'Out', 'Control', 'tour', 'concert', 'sound', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'done', 'mixed', 'vocals', 'could', 'be', 'cranked', 'up', 'little', 'more', 'show', 'general', 'not', 'visually', 'entertaining', 'Out', 'Control', 'concert', 'video', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'only', 'one', 'Girls', 'Aloud', 'concert', 'video', 'recommend', 'Out', 'Control', 'concert', 'live', 'O2', 'instead', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'songs', 'featured', 'concert', 'instead', 'suppose', 'Nevertheless', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'hindsight', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'purchased', 'just', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'came', 'see', 'would', 'play', 'North', 'American', 'PS3', ""n't"", 'listing', 'say', 'NTSC', ""n't"", 'what', 'want', 'Anyway', 'one', 'received', 'PAL', 'format', 'PS3', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'My', 'PC', 'will', 'play']",Tangled Up Tour 2008

After catching a clip of Girls Aloud performing my favorite song, ""Call The Shots"" on YouTube, I was mesmerized at how crystal clear the DVD was and how stunning the ladies looked in their outfits. Nadine, Cheryl, Nicola, Sarah and Kimberley put on an excellent show with their choreography, vocals, and gorgeous attire and makeup.
