Would Hollywood exploit this concern? The film starts by showing an elevated subway train in New York city. Richard Dadier applies for job as an English teacher at North Manual High School. ""There is no discipline problem."" The students assemble to meet the new teachers. Some students have an attitude problem. Dadier takes charge of his class. Later he rescues a new teacher from unwanted attention, and establishes a reputation. One teacher is devoted to jazz music; is he too naive? Two teachers take a short cut and are ambushed. The police arrive to rescue them. It was too dark to identify anyone.Dadier sees other classes where students care about their education. Dadier wants to reach young minds. Unattended children do not get a decent home life, and join gangs for companionship. Is it just a lack of parental control? They have to work long hours and can't be home all day. [No church or relatives?] Some students hijack a newspaper truck. A teacher brings rare recordings to class - someone gets an education about this. The teachers have different ways of coping with their students. Dadier is challenged by this school. The students have a discussion about ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". What is the real meaning of this story? Can students be reached by ""visual education'? What about reading, writing, and arithmetic? One scene shows Miller working on a 1930s car, a side-valve six with an oil bath air cleaner.Dadier's wife is brought to the hospital. Ann has some worries about something. Their son is born premature. Richard learns about the poison pen letters and considers quitting. Their pay rate then was $2 an hour, many earned far more. [Teacher's unions have solved this problem.] A crisis develops when West is caught cheating. Most of the students back Dadier, and two will be brought to the Principal. ""Everybody learns something in school, even the teachers.""""Evan Hunter"" went on to write many more novels, as well as ""Ed McBain"". But Aldous Huxley wrote an earlier novel about a class-based educational system - ""Brave New World"". Were there such schools in the 19th century? This film has remained entertaining and educational. Was it based on the author's experiences? The name ""Hunter"" may be a tribute to his college.",4,Teaching at the Bottom Rung,1188432000,"08 30, 2007",2007,2366,"['problem', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'schools', 'rock', 'roll', 'destroying', 'youth', 'America', 'Would', 'Hollywood', 'exploit', 'concern', 'film', 'starts', 'showing', 'elevated', 'subway', 'train', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'Richard', 'Dadier', 'applies', 'job', 'English', 'teacher', 'North', 'Manual', 'High', 'School', 'discipline', 'problem', 'students', 'assemble', 'meet', 'new', 'teachers', 'students', 'have', 'attitude', 'problem', 'Dadier', 'charge', 'class', 'Later', 'new', 'teacher', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'reputation', 'One', 'teacher', 'devoted', 'jazz', 'music', 'too', 'naive', 'Two', 'teachers', 'take', 'short', 'cut', 'are', 'ambushed', 'police', 'arrive', 'rescue', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'identify', 'anyone.Dadier', 'sees', 'other', 'classes', 'where', 'students', 'care', 'education', 'Dadier', 'reach', 'young', 'minds', 'Unattended', 'children', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'decent', 'home', 'life', 'join', 'gangs', 'companionship', 'just', 'lack', 'parental', 'control', 'have', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'home', 'day', '[', 'church', 'relatives', ']', 'students', 'hijack', 'newspaper', 'truck', 'teacher', 'brings', 'rare', 'recordings', 'class', 'someone', 'education', 'teachers', 'have', 'different', 'ways', 'coping', 'students', 'Dadier', 'challenged', 'school', 'students', 'have', 'discussion', 'Jack', 'Beanstalk', 'What', 'real', 'meaning', 'story', 'Can', 'students', 'be', 'reached', 'visual', 'education', 'What', 'reading', 'writing', 'arithmetic', 'One', 'scene', 'Miller', 'working', '1930s', 'car', 'side-valve', 'six', 'oil', 'bath', 'air', 'cleaner.Dadier', 'wife', 'brought', 'hospital', 'Ann', 'worries', 'something', 'son', 'born', 'premature', 'Richard', 'poison', 'pen', 'letters', 'considers', 'quitting', 'pay', 'rate', 'then', 'was', '2', 'hour', 'many', 'earned', 'far', 'more', '[', 'Teacher', 'unions', 'have', 'solved', 'problem', ']', 'crisis', 'when', 'West', 'caught', 'cheating', 'Most', 'students', 'back', 'Dadier', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'Principal', 'Everybody', 'something', 'school', 'even', 'teachers', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'went', 'write', 'many', 'more', 'novels', 'as', 'well', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'Aldous', 'Huxley', 'wrote', 'earlier', 'novel', 'class-based', 'educational', 'system', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'Were', 'such', 'schools', '19th', 'century', 'film', 'remained', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'Was', 'based', 'author', 'experiences', 'name', 'Hunter', 'may', 'be', 'tribute', 'college']",Blackboard Jungle VHS

406745,AGEIT17HENDIS,6304196873,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Film noir as a genre came in all shapes and sizes, mainly the best being the crime noir saga. Occasionally though other subjects received royal treatment, as here on the troubling rise of juvenile delinquency in the cities (and maybe elsewhere too) of America in the film under review, Blackboard Jungle. Although a re-viewing of this classic noir reveals some pretty ham-handed notions about the subject of JD's and about schools it still has some ""socially redeeming qualities."" For one, as the vehicle that connected film with the emerging be-bop rock sound being heard on the AM radio in the early 1950s, at least as heard in some places, through the use of Billy Halley and the Comets' smash hit of 1955, Rock Around The Clock. Beyond that some of the performances, especially that of Sidney Portier, as a young alienated, ""talented tenth"" black student who could go either way, fame or crime also sticks out.The plot of this thing though even for its red scare- moral uplift-we-had better-get-a-handle-on-these-troubled-youth-or-the-Russkies-will-beat us time seems well, corny. Corny because the characters from Glenn Ford's worldly-wise but idealistic and frustrated young teacher to the white (represented by Vince Morrow), black (Portier), Spanish and other city ethnic group students are wooden when I compare them to my own similar working-poor neighborhood (minus the blacks) of the time. In short, youth here are merely misunderstood and with the right formula (some version of tough love and a peek at Ozzie and Harriet) they will, except those few rotten apples who we will put in stir for good, change their ways.A little plot summary will give you an idea of what I mean. Ford, hires on in a deeply troubled urban (New York but could have been a lot of places, including on a smaller scale my hometown, North Adamsville) school beset by racial, ethnic, class and social tensions. He is just idealistic enough, like many before and after him, to try to make a difference despite the heavy odds against him. Of course the first rule of teaching, thugs or princes, is who rules the classroom. For much of the film that is an open question as he seeks allies among the motley crew of students, especially Portier. Of course not everybody makes it, student or teacher alike. The be-bop jazz-loving nerdish math teacher (played by Richard Kiley) and the Irish gang leader thug (played by Vince Morrow)to name two. But in the end the key figures have an epiphany and the uphill education struggle goes on.Moral uplift and due regard for the efforts of generations of teacher to make a different aside you can see where the holes in the plot shine through. The hard reality is that, like at my school, the thugs were weeded out long before high school, or they ran the show, mostly the former. This brings to mind a character from my working class streets, ""Stewball"" Stu (we never called him that to his face because we would have been shivved but that is what we called him among our younger set because the guy was a heavy, heavy whiskey drinker, day and night, walking or driving). Stu dropped out, or rather was kicked out of school, in the ninth grade, I think. But he had a ""boss"" '57 Chevy when they were the rage, about ten million girls around him (and no ""dogs"" either) and all kind of criminal enterprises running. The reason that he got kicked out of school? Oh ya, he threw a teacher, and not a small one out the window, fortunately it was only from the first floor. And they never did squat about it. So see that moral uplift stuff is good for the 1950s movies but just yawn stuff in the real world. Oh ya, Stu's luck ran out later, like sometimes happens but in the 1950s he was the be-bop max daddy king of the jungle. And no blackboard jungle either. Later, fortunately, more realistic troubled youth films were made, like the film adaptations of S.E. Hinton's works, and made without the heavy-handed cautionary tale.",4,"Be-Bop, Be-Bop",1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,3946,"['Film', 'genre', 'came', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'mainly', 'best', 'being', 'crime', 'noir', 'saga', 'Occasionally', 'other', 'subjects', 'received', 'royal', 'treatment', 'here', 'troubling', 'rise', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'cities', 'maybe', 'elsewhere', 'too', 'America', 'film', 'review', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 're-viewing', 'classic', 'noir', 'pretty', 'ham-handed', 'notions', 'subject', 'JD', 'schools', 'still', 'socially', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'one', 'vehicle', 'connected', 'film', 'emerging', 'be-bop', 'rock', 'sound', 'being', 'heard', 'AM', 'radio', 'early', '1950s', 'least', 'heard', 'places', 'use', 'Billy', 'Halley', 'Comets', 'smash', 'hit', '1955', 'Rock', 'Clock', 'Beyond', 'performances', 'especially', 'Sidney', 'Portier', 'young', 'alienated', 'talented', 'tenth', 'black', 'student', 'who', 'could', 'go', 'way', 'fame', 'crime', 'also', 'out.The', 'plot', 'thing', 'even', 'red', 'scare-', 'moral', 'uplift-we-had', 'better-get-a-handle-on-these-troubled-youth-or-the-Russkies-will-beat', 'time', 'well', 'corny', 'Corny', 'characters', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'worldly-wise', 'idealistic', 'frustrated', 'young', 'teacher', 'white', 'represented', 'Vince', 'Morrow', 'black', 'Portier', 'Spanish', 'other', 'city', 'ethnic', 'group', 'students', 'are', 'wooden', 'when', 'compare', 'own', 'similar', 'working-poor', 'neighborhood', 'blacks', 'time', 'short', 'youth', 'here', 'are', 'merely', 'misunderstood', 'right', 'formula', 'version', 'tough', 'love', 'peek', 'Ozzie', 'Harriet', 'will', 'few', 'rotten', 'apples', 'who', 'will', 'put', 'stir', 'good', 'change', 'ways.A', 'little', 'plot', 'summary', 'will', 'give', 'idea', 'what', 'mean', 'Ford', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'urban', 'New', 'York', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'places', 'including', 'smaller', 'scale', 'hometown', 'North', 'Adamsville', 'school', 'beset', 'racial', 'ethnic', 'class', 'social', 'tensions', 'just', 'idealistic', 'enough', 'many', 'before', 'try', 'make', 'difference', 'heavy', 'odds', 'course', 'first', 'rule', 'teaching', 'thugs', 'princes', 'who', 'rules', 'classroom', 'much', 'film', 'open', 'question', 'allies', 'motley', 'crew', 'students', 'especially', 'Portier', 'course', 'not', 'everybody', 'student', 'teacher', 'alike', 'be-bop', 'jazz-loving', 'nerdish', 'math', 'teacher', 'played', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'Irish', 'gang', 'leader', 'thug', 'played', 'Vince', 'Morrow', 'name', 'two', 'end', 'key', 'figures', 'have', 'epiphany', 'uphill', 'education', 'struggle', 'on.Moral', 'uplift', 'due', 'regard', 'efforts', 'generations', 'teacher', 'make', 'different', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'holes', 'plot', 'shine', 'hard', 'reality', 'school', 'thugs', 'were', 'weeded', 'out', 'long', 'before', 'high', 'school', 'ran', 'show', 'mostly', 'former', 'mind', 'character', 'working', 'class', 'streets', 'Stewball', 'Stu', 'never', 'called', 'face', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shivved', 'what', 'called', 'younger', 'set', 'guy', 'was', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'whiskey', 'drinker', 'day', 'night', 'walking', 'driving', 'Stu', 'dropped', 'out', 'rather', 'was', 'kicked', 'school', 'ninth', 'grade', 'think', 'had', 'boss', 'Chevy', 'when', 'were', 'rage', 'about', 'ten', 'million', 'girls', 'dogs', 'kind', 'criminal', 'enterprises', 'running', 'reason', 'got', 'kicked', 'school', 'Oh', 'ya', 'threw', 'teacher', 'not', 'small', 'one', 'window', 'fortunately', 'was', 'only', 'first', 'floor', 'never', 'did', 'squat', 'see', 'moral', 'uplift', 'stuff', 'good', '1950s', 'movies', 'just', 'yawn', 'stuff', 'real', 'world', 'Oh', 'ya', 'Stu', 'luck', 'ran', 'out', 'later', 'sometimes', '1950s', 'was', 'be-bop', 'max', 'daddy', 'king', 'jungle', 'blackboard', 'jungle', 'either', 'Later', 'fortunately', 'more', 'realistic', 'troubled', 'youth', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'adaptations', 'S.E', 'Hinton', 'works', 'made', 'heavy-handed', 'cautionary', 'tale']",Blackboard Jungle VHS
406746,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6304196873,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 7/13Rate: 97/13: Although the portrayal of the events in Blackboard Jungle was unrealistic when it came out, it's as realistic as ever today, at least to the extent of urban schools. I used to work in one as a high school mathematics teacher for one year as a first-year teacher and then quit the job. The character, played by Glenn Ford, is perfectly illustrated as an idealistic teacher who wanted to teach and convey his love of learning to his students. I had the same mind-set when I first entered the teaching profession. Then, the unthinkable happened. The educational system that I worked in was nowhere near what I had ever in my life. In fact, I've never seen anything like it, and it was equally surprising and disappointing. I've never felt that I belonged there or didn't appreciate being the enemy for no apparent reason. I continually had to lower my standards on the job, and then I lowered them even more until I hit the rock bottom because nobody, save a dozen or so, had the necessary basic skills or academic discipline. So, I decided that I've had enough with the students, and the money wasn't worth the mental and physical drain that I was constantly enduring week in, week out. While the job wasn't a total loss, I ended up getting the standard certifications (also in special education) and a year of experience. It left me realizing that I needed to work for a school that fits what I want out of a school, so I got what I want. Anyway, Blackboard Jungle reminds me perfectly of that year I worked for an urban school. I've had too many similar episodes to Mr. Dadier's except I would never bring anything valuable to the school. I think that I wished that I saw Blackboard Jungle earlier to have a better idea of what to expect. All in all, Blackboard Jungle is a very realistic, accurate portrayal of what an urban school looks like if the administration and the teachers have lost a lot of control over the students.",5,Tells It Like It is.,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1953,"['Viewed', '7/13Rate', '97/13', 'portrayal', 'events', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'as', 'realistic', 'ever', 'today', 'least', 'extent', 'urban', 'schools', 'used', 'work', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'mathematics', 'teacher', 'one', 'year', 'first-year', 'teacher', 'then', 'quit', 'job', 'character', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'perfectly', 'illustrated', 'idealistic', 'teacher', 'who', 'wanted', 'teach', 'convey', 'love', 'learning', 'students', 'had', 'same', 'mind-set', 'when', 'first', 'entered', 'teaching', 'profession', 'Then', 'unthinkable', 'happened', 'educational', 'system', 'worked', 'was', 'nowhere', 'what', 'had', 'ever', 'life', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'was', 'equally', 'surprising', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'belonged', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'being', 'enemy', 'apparent', 'reason', 'continually', 'had', 'lower', 'standards', 'job', 'then', 'lowered', 'even', 'more', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'nobody', 'save', 'dozen', 'so', 'had', 'necessary', 'basic', 'skills', 'academic', 'discipline', 'So', 'decided', ""'ve"", 'had', 'enough', 'students', 'money', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'mental', 'physical', 'drain', 'was', 'constantly', 'enduring', 'week', 'week', 'out', 'job', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'standard', 'certifications', 'also', 'special', 'education', 'year', 'experience', 'left', 'realizing', 'needed', 'work', 'school', 'what', 'want', 'school', 'got', 'what', 'want', 'Anyway', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'perfectly', 'year', 'worked', 'urban', 'school', ""'ve"", 'had', 'too', 'many', 'similar', 'episodes', 'Mr.', 'Dadier', 'would', 'never', 'bring', 'anything', 'valuable', 'school', 'think', 'wished', 'saw', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'earlier', 'have', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'very', 'realistic', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'what', 'urban', 'school', 'looks', 'administration', 'teachers', 'have', 'lost', 'lot', 'control', 'students']",Blackboard Jungle VHS

406753,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6304196873,David Baldwin,"[4, 6]","""The Blackboard Jungle"" raises many interesting questions about the root causes of student apathy and delinquency in the inner-city schools.  At the same time it seems to wallow in the most extreme behavior of students i.e. a near rape of an attractive female teacher, multiple assaults on teachers, a student brandishing a switchblade in the classroom.  One character is enigmatic to me, the Artie West character played by Vic Morrow.  Not to say that Morrow doesn't play the character well because he is sufficiently menacing but it seemed over-the-top for the film.  There is much to recommend in this film particularly the starring role of Richard Dadier played by Glenn Ford.  Ford's solid acting keeps the film from veering into melodrama.  A young Sidney Poitier as Gregory Miller, a gifted student whose superior intellect is wasted in this apathetic environment, does a charismatic turn.  In a note of irony, in 1967 Poitier portrayed a teacher attempting to make a difference in an inner-city school in what I feel is a superior film, ""To Sir, With Love"".",4,More Exploitation Than Exploration of Juvenile Delinquency,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,1065,"['Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'many', 'interesting', 'questions', 'root', 'causes', 'student', 'apathy', 'delinquency', 'inner-city', 'schools', 'same', 'time', 'wallow', 'most', 'extreme', 'behavior', 'students', 'i.e', 'near', 'rape', 'attractive', 'female', 'teacher', 'multiple', 'assaults', 'teachers', 'student', 'brandishing', 'switchblade', 'classroom', 'One', 'character', 'enigmatic', 'Artie', 'West', 'character', 'played', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'Not', 'say', 'Morrow', ""n't"", 'play', 'character', 'well', 'sufficiently', 'menacing', 'seemed', 'over-the-top', 'film', 'much', 'recommend', 'film', 'particularly', 'starring', 'role', 'Richard', 'Dadier', 'played', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Ford', 'solid', 'acting', 'film', 'veering', 'melodrama', 'young', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Gregory', 'Miller', 'gifted', 'student', 'superior', 'intellect', 'wasted', 'apathetic', 'environment', 'charismatic', 'turn', 'note', 'irony', '1967', 'Poitier', 'portrayed', 'teacher', 'attempting', 'make', 'difference', 'inner-city', 'school', 'what', 'feel', 'superior', 'film', 'Sir', 'Love']",Blackboard Jungle VHS

Daniel,"[1, 1]","Today's schools can be a lot scarier than the one Glenn Ford steps into, but this movie's message - teachers can have an impact - remains true.That was the message writer-director Richard Brooks developed when he adapted the best-selling novel by Evan Hunter a/k/a Ed McBain. Growing up poor in Philadelphia, Brooks had been to tough schools and understood how one teacher could change a life. According to the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), that happened to Brooks. He never forgot the teacher who taught him how to read and thus opened a new world for him.Funny thing was, none of MGM's big contract stars wanted to be in the lead role. Among those turning it down were Robert Taylor and Mickey Rooney. Glenn Ford's career, though, was in a downturn at the time and asked for the part. And he helped make the movie one of the most memorable looks at teen life in the 1950's.The depiction of juvenile delinquency in ""Blackboard Jungle"" sparked huge controversy, too, and some communities sought to ban the movie because they feared it would lead to violence. Some even called it communist-inspired because it didn't portray schools in a positive light.""Blackboard Jungle"" is remembered for many things. It was the first movie to feature a rock and roll song, ""Rock Around the Clock,"" which Brooks personally chose for the soundtrack. (It wasn't until the movie came out that the song hit No. 1.) ""Blackboard Jungle"" was a huge hit, MGM's top earner that year, and on a shoestring budget to boot. It helped make a star out of Sidney Poitier, one of the kids in the classroom. And it helped Brooks gain more control over his films.Keep an eye on the classroom and look for future writer-director Paul Mazursky, future ""Combat!"" star Vic Morrow (he won the part over Steve McQueen) and future ""MASH"" TV star Jamie Farr.Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks (Wisconsin Film Studies)",4,"A cultural milestone, still packs some punch",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,1956,"['Today', 'schools', 'can', 'be', 'lot', 'scarier', 'one', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'movie', 'message', 'teachers', 'can', 'have', 'impact', 'was', 'message', 'writer-director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'developed', 'when', 'adapted', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'a/k/a', 'Ed', 'McBain', 'Growing', 'up', 'poor', 'Philadelphia', 'Brooks', 'had', 'been', 'tough', 'schools', 'understood', 'how', 'one', 'teacher', 'could', 'change', 'life', 'According', 'new', 'book', 'Tough', 'Nails', 'Life', 'Films', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'available', 'amazon.com', 'happened', 'Brooks', 'never', 'forgot', 'teacher', 'who', 'taught', 'how', 'read', 'thus', 'opened', 'new', 'world', 'him.Funny', 'thing', 'was', 'none', 'MGM', 'big', 'contract', 'stars', 'wanted', 'be', 'lead', 'role', 'turning', 'down', 'were', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'career', 'was', 'downturn', 'time', 'asked', 'part', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'looks', 'teen', 'life', ""1950's.The"", 'depiction', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'sparked', 'huge', 'controversy', 'too', 'communities', 'sought', 'ban', 'movie', 'feared', 'would', 'lead', 'violence', 'even', 'called', 'communist-inspired', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'schools', 'positive', 'light', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'remembered', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'feature', 'rock', 'roll', 'song', 'Rock', 'Clock', 'Brooks', 'personally', 'chose', 'soundtrack', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'song', 'hit', 'No', '1', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'MGM', 'top', 'earner', 'year', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'boot', 'helped', 'make', 'star', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'one', 'kids', 'classroom', 'helped', 'Brooks', 'gain', 'more', 'control', 'films.Keep', 'eye', 'classroom', 'look', 'future', 'writer-director', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'future', 'Combat', 'star', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'won', 'part', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'future', 'MASH', 'TV', 'star', 'Jamie', 'Farr.Tough', 'Nails', 'Life', 'Films', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'Wisconsin', 'Film', 'Studies']",Blackboard Jungle VHS

From driving downbeat to throbbing close, Bill Haley's title tune promises a party around-the-clock -- from twelve midnight to broad daylight -- to which teens of the day responded with uncaged delight, raucous cheers, and spontaneous twirling in the aisles. A full year before Elvis, a new generation was on its feet, the legendary youth culture was born, and Rock and Roll was here to stay. America would never be the same -- a mighty heavy load for one modest B-movie from famously conservative  MGM!Needless to say, the film is an absolute must. Minimize the story line which veers from 50's-style social realism to mild reassurances from writer-director Richard Brooks, (this was, after all, the height of the Cold War and the restrictive production code). Instead, concentrate on the seminal images and associations, so vividly presented, whose residue continues to the present day: Rock-music -- unruly youth -- alcohol and violent sex --  menacing urban underclass. And in two of the most symbolic scenes -- the  trashing of Richard Kiley's record collection and the  thrusting arms through the iron bars --there are serious overtones of barbarians at the gates, against which Glenn Ford's reflex liberalism appears tellingly inadequate. From this point on, only communism was more feared than the spread of Rock-and-Roll and its seditious offspring, juvenile delinquency.Sure, there are better films from that era than Blackboard, maybe even better teen movies. But, arguably, none are more significant to the course of popular culture. For a brief accidental moment, a little movie from Hollywood not only reflected emergent trends from deep within society, but mobilized them as well. With: a grimly determined Glenn Ford, an arrogantly sinister Vic Morrow, a decidedly unthreatening Sidney Poitier, and in a usual thankless supporting role, the great John Hoyt, whose memorably cruel face was born to preside over either prisons or high schools, take your pick.",5,Awakening a Generation,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,2102,"['Restless', 'post-war', 'youth', 'may', 'have', 'hit', 'road', 'Brando', 'motorcycle', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'found', 'sound', 'driving', 'downbeat', 'throbbing', 'close', 'Bill', 'Haley', 'title', 'tune', 'party', 'around-the-clock', 'twelve', 'midnight', 'broad', 'daylight', 'teens', 'day', 'responded', 'uncaged', 'delight', 'raucous', 'cheers', 'spontaneous', 'twirling', 'aisles', 'full', 'year', 'Elvis', 'new', 'generation', 'was', 'feet', 'legendary', 'youth', 'culture', 'was', 'born', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'was', 'here', 'stay', 'America', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'mighty', 'heavy', 'load', 'one', 'modest', 'B-movie', 'famously', 'conservative', 'MGM', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'absolute', 'must', 'Minimize', 'story', 'line', 'veers', ""50's-style"", 'social', 'realism', 'mild', 'reassurances', 'writer-director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'was', 'height', 'Cold', 'War', 'restrictive', 'production', 'code', 'Instead', 'concentrate', 'seminal', 'images', 'associations', 'so', 'vividly', 'presented', 'residue', 'present', 'day', 'Rock-music', 'unruly', 'youth', 'alcohol', 'violent', 'sex', 'menacing', 'urban', 'underclass', 'two', 'most', 'symbolic', 'scenes', 'trashing', 'Richard', 'Kiley', 'record', 'collection', 'thrusting', 'arms', 'iron', 'bars', 'are', 'serious', 'overtones', 'barbarians', 'gates', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'reflex', 'liberalism', 'tellingly', 'inadequate', 'point', 'only', 'communism', 'was', 'more', 'feared', 'spread', 'Rock-and-Roll', 'seditious', 'offspring', 'juvenile', 'delinquency.Sure', 'are', 'better', 'films', 'era', 'Blackboard', 'maybe', 'even', 'better', 'teen', 'movies', 'arguably', 'none', 'are', 'more', 'significant', 'course', 'popular', 'culture', 'brief', 'accidental', 'moment', 'little', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'only', 'reflected', 'emergent', 'trends', 'deep', 'society', 'mobilized', 'as', 'well', 'grimly', 'determined', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'arrogantly', 'sinister', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'decidedly', 'unthreatening', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'usual', 'thankless', 'supporting', 'role', 'great', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'memorably', 'cruel', 'face', 'was', 'born', 'preside', 'prisons', 'high', 'schools', 'take', 'pick']",Blackboard Jungle VHS
406758,A679NFY5Y1M70,6304196873,drew behr,"[7, 7]","I first saw this movie in the early 70s on TV and have rented it numerous times since the advent of VHS. It is an eye-opening portrayal of Richard Daddiere, an eager navy veteran who giddily wins his first teachng assignment at a hopelessly urban hellhole of a school. Right from the start though, one can immediately sense that his altruistic belief in the nobility of teaching will be reduced that of a desperate corrections officer doing his best to quell a daily uprising. And this does become the case very early into the film and serves as the film's central conflict. His first day of class begins with one of the punks hurling a baseball within inches of his head the first moment he turns his back on them, blasting a cracked hole into the blacboard. Daddiere wryly retorts with, &quot;Well...whoever threw that will never play centerfield for the Yankees.&quot; This is our introduction to the likes of Artie West, more than convincingly played by the late Vic Morrow, a vicious punk whose demeanor instantaneously reveals that it is lkely that he'll not live a day beyond his twenty-first birthday. Then there is Gregory Miller, smoothly played by Sidney Poitier-a cool black cat who knows the score and is inherently decent. Daddiere smells this in him and encourages him to put his keenness to good use rather than waste his potential by being a lowlife like West and the rest of hs ilk. But Miller's race justifies his roguery, and he remains a sympathetic character for the duration. Then there is Bilozzi, a frightened punk and who takes sides with West because he's too afraid to be his own man and think for himself. I really admired this film, as it credibly depicted one man's quest to teach the unteachable, even though he well realizes that it is an unwinnable battle. Glenn Ford's performance is astonishingly good. His character seethes with a relentless desire to achieve his goal despite whatever these delinquents do to deter him. Louis Calhern also turns in a wonderful performance as a jaded, veteran history teacher who serves as a type of Greek chorus for Daddiere, constantly reminding him from the start that all that is does not glitter. When Daddiere insists to him at one point that &quot;If only I could just reach them...get inside their minds!&quot;, Calhern wittily replies, &quot;Mind? A mind would indicate the presence of a brain!&quot;.

This is the 1950's version  of the problem in a  decaying urban setting, far from the safe neighborhoods & suburbs Americans were flocking to at the time. The presentation is reminiscent of the live TV dramas of the day: cheap & with minimal production values relying on the talents of the actors. And excellent acting it is. Glenn Ford is Richard Didier, at first glance, a  milquetoast English teacher. His mettle is quickly tested by angry, violent, young punks posing as his students. He rises to the challenge, including a vicious physical attack, to win them over with his refusal to quit & his courage. The picture is to some extent, incomplete, providing little context in which ""this garbage"" as one teacher discribes the students was produced. Vic Morrow is remarkable as the unrepentant, particlarly menacing student/criminal. Sidney Poiter plays an alienated, cynical student with a class & dignity that becomes his trademark in future films. This movie, dated though it is, has been the subject in many college level course through the years.

406770,A2VUP5US1F5HG5,6304196873,K. Jump,"[6, 6]","1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle"" remains a poignant, relevant portrayal of life in America's public schools.  The story of WWII vet turned English teacher (Glenn Ford)as he struggles to reach a class of apathetic teens who do not want to be reached, the movie takes us from Ford's unsuspecting classroom debut through his efforts to lead a normal home life despite the pressures of his new job and finally to a climactic showdown with his most evil of students.The movie's cast is thoroughly excellent.  Ford is at once tough and terribly vulnerable as the embattled new teacher, Margaret Hayes is all patrician slinkiness as For'd wanne-be paramour, Sidney Poitier is convincing as the slowly mellowing student, and Anne Francis is even sexier than she was in ""Forbidden Planet"" as Ford's supportive but insecure wife.There's much to appreciate in this film.  Partly intended to help comat the growing problem of juvenile delinquency in 50s America, the film tries hard to achieve realism and generally succeeds.  The students in Ford's class are disillusioned, lazy, suspicious, arrogant, obnoxious, and sometimes dangerous--which is exactly how teens are in real life.  The only typical teenage bad habit that's not portrayed (or at least suggested) is cursing, which of course 50s moral standards would not allow on the big screen.  But if they don't swear, Ford's students have no trouble finding other ways to be both annoying and anarchic, just like real kids.  Interestingly, Ford discovers (much like this reviewer did) that sometimes the best way to reach apathetic kids is with a cartoon.  Sad.Another great thing about this movie is its approach to the politics of the school world.  The movie's teachers argue and struggle not only with their students, but amongst themselves.  Moreover, the encroaching dangers of multiculturalism are, perhaps inadverdantly, accurately addressed as Ford must deal with ethnic divisions amongst his students which some are eager to exploit for their own gain, as when Ford is unfairly accused of racism simply because of some careless word choices.  In today's schools Political Correctness is indeed the rule, often to the detriment of real learning and growth, so at least one of the film's pertinent warnings has gone ignored.Though some might find ""The Blackboard Jungle"" dated, it is in fact as timely in all the important ways as it was in the 50s.  The American educational problem continues to undercut many of society's more noble aims, and it will do so as long as the powers that be refuse to take the necessary steps to reach a solution.  Teens must be taught there are absolutes in life and be expected to live up to them, not encouraged to simply indulge their every whim.  Perhaps if enough of us adults in liberated America come to realize this for ourselves, we can at least begin to convince our children of it.",4,IT REALLY IS A JUNGLE OUT THERE,1031961600,"09 14, 2002",2002,2874,"['1955', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'poignant', 'relevant', 'portrayal', 'life', 'America', 'public', 'schools', 'story', 'WWII', 'vet', 'turned', 'English', 'teacher', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'reach', 'class', 'apathetic', 'teens', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'reached', 'movie', 'Ford', 'unsuspecting', 'classroom', 'debut', 'efforts', 'lead', 'normal', 'home', 'life', 'pressures', 'new', 'job', 'finally', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'most', 'evil', 'students.The', 'movie', 'cast', 'thoroughly', 'excellent', 'Ford', 'once', 'tough', 'terribly', 'vulnerable', 'embattled', 'new', 'teacher', 'Margaret', 'Hayes', 'patrician', 'slinkiness', ""'d"", 'wanne-be', 'paramour', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'convincing', 'slowly', 'mellowing', 'student', 'Anne', 'Francis', 'even', 'sexier', 'was', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'Ford', 'supportive', 'insecure', 'wife.There', 'much', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Partly', 'intended', 'help', 'comat', 'growing', 'problem', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', '50s', 'America', 'film', 'hard', 'achieve', 'realism', 'generally', 'students', 'Ford', 'class', 'are', 'disillusioned', 'lazy', 'suspicious', 'arrogant', 'obnoxious', 'sometimes', 'dangerous', 'exactly', 'how', 'teens', 'are', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'typical', 'teenage', 'bad', 'habit', 'not', 'portrayed', 'least', 'suggested', 'cursing', 'course', '50s', 'moral', 'standards', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'big', 'screen', 'do', ""n't"", 'swear', 'Ford', 'students', 'have', 'trouble', 'finding', 'other', 'ways', 'be', 'annoying', 'anarchic', 'just', 'real', 'kids', 'Interestingly', 'Ford', 'much', 'reviewer', 'did', 'best', 'way', 'reach', 'apathetic', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'Sad.Another', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'approach', 'politics', 'school', 'world', 'movie', 'teachers', 'argue', 'struggle', 'not', 'only', 'students', 'amongst', 'Moreover', 'encroaching', 'dangers', 'multiculturalism', 'are', 'perhaps', 'inadverdantly', 'accurately', 'addressed', 'Ford', 'must', 'deal', 'ethnic', 'divisions', 'students', 'are', 'eager', 'exploit', 'own', 'gain', 'when', 'Ford', 'unfairly', 'accused', 'racism', 'simply', 'careless', 'word', 'choices', 'today', 'schools', 'Political', 'Correctness', 'indeed', 'rule', 'often', 'detriment', 'real', 'learning', 'growth', 'so', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'pertinent', 'warnings', 'gone', 'ignored.Though', 'might', 'find', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'dated', 'fact', 'timely', 'important', 'ways', 'was', '50s', 'American', 'educational', 'problem', 'undercut', 'many', 'society', 'more', 'noble', 'aims', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'long', 'powers', 'be', 'refuse', 'take', 'necessary', 'steps', 'reach', 'solution', 'must', 'be', 'taught', 'are', 'absolutes', 'life', 'be', 'expected', 'live', 'up', 'not', 'encouraged', 'simply', 'indulge', 'whim', 'Perhaps', 'enough', 'adults', 'liberated', 'America', 'come', 'realize', 'can', 'least', 'begin', 'convince', 'children']",Blackboard Jungle VHS

406783,AK61LQI92GTCH,6304196873,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[17, 19]","Mix a dash of earnest social consciousness, a pinch of rock `n roll (""One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock ROCK...""), a dollop of exploitation (A shock story of today's high school hoodlums!) and you've got the recipe for BLACKBOARD JUNGLE (1955), director Richard Brooks' highly successful and award winning movie.BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is the story of Richard Dadier (Glenn Ford), a rookie teacher newly hired at Emmanuel High School, an inner-city school that one of the veteran teachers aptly, we soon learn, refers to as a `garbage can.'  Dadier - immediately and inevitably `Daddy-O' to his class full of juvenile delinquents - is an idealist of sorts who, against the stream, believes that he can reach and teach the kids.  In the class is a glowering Vic Morrow and an apathetic Sidney Poitier - Poitier's character is apathetic, that is - and various other representatives of inner-city hoodlums.  It's in this corrosive environment that Dadier's liberal idealism is buffeted and, finally, put to the acid test. Ford, Morrow and Poitier are outstanding in a story that seems quite dated today.  Although it presents itself as an unblinking expos&eacute; of juvenile delinquency, there's an awful lot missing from this one - parents are never seen, nor students' homes nor, surprisingly, does there seem to be any female students.  Perhaps, as is suggested on the commentary track, the school was originally supposed a trade school but changed when the powers that be checked what side their bread was buttered on.  As it is, there's seems to be no reason given as to why these kids are so rotten, or whether anyone but Dadier really cares about them.Still, BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is a great leap forward from Hollywood's last examination of troubled youth, namely the Dead End Kids, aka the East End Kids, aka the Bowery Boys.  The kid/boys began their career in the 1930s in a number of Warner Brothers' tough guy movies - Dead End with Humphrey Bogart, Angels With Dirty Faces with Jimmy Cagney, They Made Me a Criminal with John Garfield - before des-ing and dos-ing themselves into America's heart as the Bowery Boys in a popular and prolific series of b-flicks in the 40s and 50s. If the Bowery Boys were wise cracking punks whose golden hearts were only a little obscured by the grime of the slums, director Richard Brooks's jungle denizens are outright sociopaths.  Rapists and murderers, stalkers and racial bigots, urban terrorists with a blood lust for intimidation and a virulent disdain for authority.Mazursky, Farr, Ford and Freeman tell us, on the comfortable and reminiscence filled commentary track, that Robert Taylor and Mickey Rooney (!?) were considered for the lead role.  It's impossible to imagine anyone but Glenn Ford in the part.  Ford ably conveys the gentle idealism and intelligence that the untested Dadier begins with.  Ford also had the toughness, the ability to express contained rage that burbles to the surface after Dadier has spent a couple of semesters in the garbage can.  In short, he was perfect for the part. BLACKBOARD JUNGLE may not contain Ford's best performance, but it's the best I've seen.If the movie doesn't deliver the promised penetrating insight into juvenile delinquency, it dealt honestly with its subject and opened the topic up for a nation-wide discussion.Besides the commentary track, the dvd also includes a trailer and a pretty weak MGM cartoon titled Blackboard Jumble and featuring Droopy.  Ah, well, I guess it's nice that they included a cartoon so directly related to the feature presentation.",4,Rock around the clock,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,3560,"['Mix', 'dash', 'earnest', 'social', 'consciousness', 'pinch', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'One', 'two', 'three', ""o'clock"", 'four', ""o'clock"", 'ROCK', 'dollop', 'exploitation', 'shock', 'story', 'today', 'high', 'school', 'hoodlums', ""'ve"", 'got', 'recipe', 'BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', '1955', 'director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'highly', 'successful', 'award', 'winning', 'movie.BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', 'story', 'Richard', 'Dadier', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'rookie', 'teacher', 'newly', 'hired', 'Emmanuel', 'High', 'School', 'inner-city', 'school', 'one', 'veteran', 'teachers', 'aptly', 'soon', 'learn', 'refers', 'garbage', 'can', 'Dadier', 'immediately', 'inevitably', 'Daddy-O', 'class', 'full', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'idealist', 'sorts', 'who', 'stream', 'can', 'reach', 'teach', 'kids', 'class', 'glowering', 'Vic', 'Morrow', 'apathetic', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Poitier', 'character', 'apathetic', 'various', 'other', 'representatives', 'inner-city', 'hoodlums', 'corrosive', 'environment', 'Dadier', 'liberal', 'idealism', 'buffeted', 'finally', 'put', 'acid', 'test', 'Ford', 'Morrow', 'Poitier', 'are', 'outstanding', 'story', 'quite', 'dated', 'today', 'unblinking', 'expos', 'eacute', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'awful', 'lot', 'missing', 'one', 'parents', 'are', 'never', 'seen', 'students', 'homes', 'surprisingly', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'female', 'students', 'Perhaps', 'suggested', 'commentary', 'track', 'school', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'trade', 'school', 'changed', 'when', 'powers', 'be', 'checked', 'what', 'side', 'bread', 'was', 'buttered', 'be', 'reason', 'given', 'why', 'kids', 'are', 'so', 'rotten', 'anyone', 'Dadier', 'really', 'them.Still', 'BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', 'great', 'leap', 'forward', 'Hollywood', 'last', 'examination', 'troubled', 'youth', 'namely', 'Dead', 'End', 'Kids', 'East', 'End', 'Kids', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'kid/boys', 'began', 'career', '1930s', 'number', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'tough', 'guy', 'movies', 'Dead', 'End', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Angels', 'Dirty', 'Faces', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'Made', 'Me', 'Criminal', 'John', 'Garfield', 'des-ing', 'dos-ing', 'America', 'heart', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'popular', 'prolific', 'series', 'b-flicks', '40s', '50s', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'were', 'wise', 'cracking', 'punks', 'golden', 'hearts', 'were', 'only', 'little', 'obscured', 'grime', 'slums', 'director', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'jungle', 'denizens', 'are', 'outright', 'sociopaths', 'Rapists', 'murderers', 'stalkers', 'racial', 'bigots', 'urban', 'terrorists', 'blood', 'lust', 'intimidation', 'virulent', 'disdain', 'authority.Mazursky', 'Farr', 'Ford', 'Freeman', 'tell', 'comfortable', 'reminiscence', 'filled', 'commentary', 'track', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'Mickey', 'Rooney', 'were', 'considered', 'lead', 'role', 'impossible', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'part', 'Ford', 'ably', 'conveys', 'gentle', 'idealism', 'intelligence', 'untested', 'Dadier', 'Ford', 'also', 'had', 'toughness', 'ability', 'express', 'contained', 'rage', 'surface', 'Dadier', 'spent', 'couple', 'semesters', 'garbage', 'can', 'short', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'BLACKBOARD', 'JUNGLE', 'may', 'not', 'contain', 'Ford', 'best', 'performance', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen.If', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'promised', 'penetrating', 'insight', 'juvenile', 'delinquency', 'honestly', 'subject', 'opened', 'topic', 'up', 'nation-wide', 'commentary', 'track', 'dvd', 'also', 'trailer', 'pretty', 'weak', 'MGM', 'cartoon', 'titled', 'Blackboard', 'Jumble', 'featuring', 'Droopy', 'Ah', 'well', 'guess', 'nice', 'included', 'cartoon', 'so', 'directly', 'related', 'feature', 'presentation']",Blackboard Jungle VHS
406784,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,6304196873,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[0, 0]","Blackboard Jungle is cited so often in rock bios (Keith Richards, Bill Wyman, Ron Woods, Bobby Keys) that I simply had to see it. Sure, after a long scrolling introduction set to wild rock drumming you do get the opening sounds of Bill Haley and his Comets doing &#8220;Rock Around The Clock&#8221;, which is good fun, but you really don&#8217;t hear much more rock music in the film after that at all &#8211; once more in the middle, in an instrumental piece, and once at the end (the producers had paid $5,000 to use it three times), although there&#8217;s a bit of jazz at one point a propos of the book, which cites jazz as the music of the film. The film shows a bunch of creepy juvenile delinquents in class getting tough and nasty, tough yet nave new teacher (played by Canadian actor Glenn Ford) learning the ropes as a new teacher (and walking them through awful top-down lessons), young thug nastiness, knife fights, and sympathetic character turnarounds who oppose the bad-to-the-bone villains, with the teacher Mr Dadier (daddy-o!) using a Jack and the Beanstock cartoon to impress his students and win them over! Sydney Poitier is good as the only black kid in the class (it seems &#8211; a few are seen later on), who&#8217;s also the most handsome, and the natural leader (Vic Morrow, as the drunken, crazed gang leader is less &#8220;leaderly&#8221;). Plenty of tinges of racism, which even back then they were pretending was an old-fashioned way of thinking. Ford, of course, has a winging, scrawny wife who gets frantic and is generally no fun. Jamie Farr, who plays Corporal Klinger in M*A*S*H, credited here with his real name Jameel Farah, played the smiley Santini in the film. Some good action, some great ideas, and some great in-class dialogue! A blockbuster and revolutionary social realism film that really busted things open, and not just about rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll!For the 2005 50th anniversary DVD edition there&#8217;s great commentary from Paul Mazursky, Jamie Farr, the film&#8217;s assistant director Joel Freeman and Glenn Ford&#8217;s son Peter Ford (Glenn was probably too weak to attend, having suffered a series of strokes at the end of his life &#8211; he died in 2006). The commentary starts off with Jamie Farr&#8217;s tale of how he came to be cast in the film, Paul Mazursky pitches in, explaining mechanics like how it was all filmed on back lot, gives lots of names, tells studio stories, identifies Jim Baccus&#8217; wife Henny Baccus, talks about how there was dancing in the aisles in Boston when the movie started, had to show the film without the music of the opening, giving personal anecdotes like how the New York actors were picked up from the airport in a limo although they had never seen a limo before, director Richard Brooks was an ex-Marine and very tough, &#8220;get my gun, where&#8217;s my gun, shoot that man, get him out of here.&#8221; Mickey Rooney was wanted for Glenn Ford&#8217;s role, but nobody thought it appropriate. Took four hours to convince Glenn Ford to lose his long hair (which he never grew back after that!). Steve McQueen was considered for the Artie West role that went to Vic Morrow &#8211; now that would have been great! The boys were excited to see Erroll Flyn, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck in the commissary! American censorship offices like the Legions Of Decency and others were against so many parts of the film, especially the adulterous hints, or how bad the film made American schools look. They wanted to film a school in Moscow to provide negative contrast (!!!), eventually putting in a superfluous scene of a wretchingly &#8220;good&#8221; American school to provide positive American contrast. Was nominated for Directors Guild awards, but not for an Oscar. After Blackboard Jungle, Bad Day At Black Rock, The Next Voice You Hear, MGM made more stark films with serious themes, less family fare. Mazursky can&#8217;t bear to watch the gratuitous &#8220;good school&#8221; scene, which was not in the book and had to be written in by Richard Brooks at studio urging. Film shot over four weeks for close to $1.5 million (more that what Mazursky paid to do &#8220;Harry And Tonto&#8221;, he adds) from November 15th to December 20th 1954, and they worked on Saturdays. The film was banned in 15 countries anyway. &#8220;This is emboldening the Communists and is making us look bad,&#8221; were some of the things said at the time. The movie seemed revolutionary, nobody had made a movie about bad behavior in schools, although  Mazursky knew all of this was real as he was from a tough school in Brooklyn, and his wife worked in a school in East Brooklyn, Maruzrsky had just gotten married, went to the school and did some research. The guy from Naked City, Horace MacMahon, plays the detective in the film also. Rafael says &#8220;stinkin&#8217;&#8221; instead of &#8220;finkin&#8217;&#8221;, like they did in the book. &#8220;Anytime you wanna come by, just come over,&#8220; the guys say to each other in the commentary. &#8220;He&#8217;s high on Sneaky Pete.&#8221; They wanted to film it in colour, but didn&#8217;t. Wanted to film it in Chicago, but didn&#8217;t have the budget. In the film they used Jack and the Beanstalk, in the book it was the allegory 51st Dragon. Ford was in demand as an actor, but badly needed for this film &#8211; he finished Interrupted Melody on a Friday, Blackboard Jungle started on a Monday. When asked who the modern-day Glenn Ford is, Mazursky says it must be Tom Hanks, Farr backs this up by mentioning the Jimmy Stewart stutter and the likability. Paul Mazursky hinted at hanky panky happening at Trader Vics during the shooting, but didn&#8217;t give details, pissing everybody else off. Talked about memoirs that everyone&#8217;s writing. Had to change the detail about Ann losing the  baby, as in the book, and it&#8217;s born premature. The school was named Manual Trades School, changed to North Manual High School for some silly reason, although it&#8217;s referenced earlier in dialogue. Had submitted it to Venice Film Festival, but US ambassador to Italy Claire Booth Lewis said she would not attend because she objected to the film, and it was pulled. The guys laugh hard over the following lines from the Jack and the Beanstalk scene:&#8220;The cops would have kept the loot for themselves.&#8221;&#8220;Not the FBI!!&#8221;Extras were from a tough school, they needed policing. The crying kid with the tie was Tommy Ivo, who went on to be a famous race car driver. Jamie Farr asks Paul Mazursky if he thought about ever being a writer/director/producer at the time, while he was working in a health food store, and if Richard Brooks influenced him as an artist, says that Brooks helped him get his start with his first agent. In the scene when someone threw a ball at the blackboard, the ball actually hit Glenn Ford in the throat, he didn&#8217;t flinch &#8211; ex-Marine. Mazursky was close to Vic Morrow. Poitier was 27, Vic was 25, although they were mostly cast to look the same age. MGM was able to make Ben Hur on the profits from Blackboard Jungle. They tell the story of how Rock Around The Clock was chosen for the soundtrack - Brooks and Ford would have planning meetings, they hadn&#8217;t picked music for it, because although jazz is mentioned in the book they wanted something more contemporary. They&#8217;d heard lots of albums and records from Ford&#8217;s son, Brooks brought in Rock Around The Clock, and they both agreed on it. Someone mentions that Glenn Ford got his stage name after the town of Glennford. On other sound stages Doris Day was filming Love Mr Or Leave me with Jimmy Cagney, and It&#8217;s Always Fair Weather on the same lot.Extras include also &#8220;Blackboard Jumble&#8221;, a 6:30 MGM Hanna Barbara cartoon by Droopy, &#8220;cease fire, man!&#8221; Hilarious triple apple bomb!
