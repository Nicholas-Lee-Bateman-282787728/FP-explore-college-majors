818546,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0001ZMWXW,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","Families are an interesting thing. The trials and tribulations of families have been playing on our TV sets for decades and decades. ELR is one of the finest and sharpest family sitcomes to ever air. Not to mention one of the most truthful and realistic as well. The show is about Ray Barone(Ray Romano), a sportswriter living in Long Island. His wife Debra(Patricia Heaton), a typical, everyday housewife and loving wife and mother to their three kids, Ally, and twin boys, Michael and Jeffrey. Across the street is Ray's family. His mother Marie(The brilliant Doris Roberts), is a loving, but somewhat suffocating mother and mother in law, who only wants to help and nurture, even when she comes off as intrusive and mind numbingly insufferable. Dad Frank(Peter Boyle), is a loutish type guy who only wants a sofa, snacks, and TV. Then their is big brother Robert(Brad Garrett), an incredibly tall cop with an eating problem still living at home. The first season sets up what the show is and what it will be in the future, when it really settles in and becomes a classic. This first season is full of great moments. ""I Love You"" has Debra wondering why Ray can't say those three little words. Ray becomes jealous of Frank when the older Barone gets published in Reader's Digest in ""Frank, The Writer"". ""Turkey Or Fish"" has Debra preparing the Thanksgiving meal and offers fish instead. Ray learns some disappointing news about a childhood keepsake from his father in ""The Ball"", and there are a number of others. The writing on the show is some of the sharpest and intelligent writing seen on any sitcome of any era. It is whipsmart funny and hits close to home. The real truth of this will continue to evolve over the season. I have never seen a family show that is so real, it feels like it could exactly be you. It was also a smart move on the show's part by not falling into the usual family sitcom cliches and have it be about the cute kids while everyone else plays second fiddle. No, the show may be about family, but it's mostly about the adults. You barely see the kids much. Romano's deadpan delivery and hound dog look makes him one of the best regular joe schmo's to be on TV. It is also different to see his portrayal of a dad that isn't a doofus for the sake of comedy, or a real doting dad type. Heaton's Debra is the ultimate wife/mother. A lot of her work are what Emmy's for comedy were made for. And what can be said about Doris Roberts?. A mother in law finally depicted in a way so many of us can relate to. The ongoing friction between her and Debra are some of the funniest and most entertaining material on TV. And the rest of them?. Perfection. Peter Boyle is the only one not to win an emmy, and it is long overdue. His portrayal of Frank is priceless. Brad Garrett is a man of many talents, and his performance as Robert has been one of the most intriguin ones on a sitcom in a long time. Everybody truly does love Raymond, and so will you. If only the dying art of the sitcom world can be more like this show.",5,Mi Famiglia,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,3040,"['Families', 'are', 'interesting', 'thing', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'families', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'TV', 'sets', 'decades', 'decades', 'ELR', 'one', 'finest', 'sharpest', 'family', 'sitcomes', 'ever', 'air', 'Not', 'mention', 'one', 'most', 'truthful', 'realistic', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'Ray', 'Barone', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'sportswriter', 'living', 'Long', 'Island', 'wife', 'Debra', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'typical', 'everyday', 'housewife', 'loving', 'wife', 'mother', 'three', 'kids', 'Ally', 'twin', 'boys', 'Michael', 'Jeffrey', 'street', 'Ray', 'family', 'mother', 'Marie', 'brilliant', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'loving', 'somewhat', 'suffocating', 'mother', 'mother', 'law', 'who', 'only', 'help', 'nurture', 'even', 'when', 'off', 'intrusive', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'insufferable', 'Dad', 'Frank', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'loutish', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'sofa', 'snacks', 'TV', 'Then', 'big', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'incredibly', 'tall', 'cop', 'eating', 'problem', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'first', 'season', 'up', 'what', 'show', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'future', 'when', 'really', 'classic', 'first', 'season', 'full', 'great', 'moments', 'Love', 'Debra', 'wondering', 'why', 'Ray', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'three', 'little', 'words', 'Ray', 'jealous', 'Frank', 'when', 'older', 'Barone', 'published', 'Reader', 'Digest', 'Frank', 'Writer', 'Turkey', 'Fish', 'Debra', 'preparing', 'Thanksgiving', 'meal', 'fish', 'instead', 'Ray', 'disappointing', 'news', 'childhood', 'keepsake', 'father', 'Ball', 'are', 'number', 'others', 'writing', 'show', 'sharpest', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'seen', 'sitcome', 'era', 'whipsmart', 'funny', 'hits', 'close', 'home', 'real', 'truth', 'will', 'continue', 'evolve', 'season', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'family', 'show', 'so', 'real', 'could', 'exactly', 'be', 'was', 'also', 'smart', 'move', 'show', 'part', 'not', 'falling', 'usual', 'family', 'sitcom', 'cliches', 'have', 'be', 'cute', 'kids', 'everyone', 'else', 'second', 'fiddle', 'No', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'family', 'mostly', 'adults', 'barely', 'see', 'kids', 'much', 'Romano', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'hound', 'dog', 'look', 'one', 'best', 'regular', 'joe', 'schmo', 'be', 'TV', 'also', 'different', 'see', 'portrayal', 'dad', ""n't"", 'doofus', 'sake', 'comedy', 'real', 'doting', 'dad', 'type', 'Heaton', 'Debra', 'ultimate', 'wife/mother', 'lot', 'work', 'are', 'what', 'Emmy', 'comedy', 'were', 'made', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'mother', 'law', 'finally', 'depicted', 'way', 'so', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'ongoing', 'friction', 'Debra', 'are', 'funniest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'material', 'TV', 'rest', 'Perfection', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'only', 'one', 'not', 'win', 'emmy', 'long', 'overdue', 'portrayal', 'Frank', 'priceless', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'man', 'many', 'talents', 'performance', 'Robert', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'intriguin', 'ones', 'sitcom', 'long', 'time', 'Everybody', 'truly', 'love', 'Raymond', 'so', 'will', 'only', 'dying', 'art', 'sitcom', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'show']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 1
818547,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0001ZMWXW,B. E Jackson,"[2, 14]","I don't understand the major appeal of this show.  Do you think this style of comedy was meant to hang around for nine years?  Surely that's too long.  Maybe one or two seasons.Raymond's character comes across as just a regular family man.  Everyone points to him as being the star of the show, and a genius for comedy.  Since when?  Sometimes he might say a couple decent things.  I certainly don't consider him some kind of cozy, lovable guy like apparently most people do.It's probably not Raymond himself that's the biggest problem with the show.  It's the way the storylines always flow *so* slowly, and they never pick up at all for the course of an entire episode.  Every episode does the same thing.  You really have to force yourself to pay attention to the lines each of the characters are saying, because the show drags on and on.  It feels like a comedy for old people.Why am I picking on Season One, you ask?  This is where it all began, and it's also the worst season because everything is so quiet, and the beginning stages were just that- the beginning of a long, successful series.  Did the show improve as the years went on?  Yeah, but slowly, and it never reached a point where I'd jump up and scream ""genius"" or anything.I guess this is the style of comedy Americans like the most.  It boggles my mind how that's possible, but whatever.With that said, the guy who plays the father IS funny.

Following on the heels of a series of successful sitcoms starring stand-up comics - Seinfeld, Home Improvement, The Drew Carey Show, etc., Everybody Loves Raymond drew upon the comedic talents of Ray Romano who plays the role of the title character Ray Barone...A successful Long Island-based sportswriter, Ray and his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton) enjoy a happy marriage and the company of their three children - daughter Ally (Madylin Sweeten) and twin sons Geoffrey (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael (Sullivan Sweeten). But they also happen to live directly across the street from Ray's parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts), who take it upon themselves to enter their son and daughter-in-law's house whenever they wish (without knocking) and dispense advice and sometimes insults. Joining Frank and Marie is Ray's brother Robert (Brad Garrett), a divorced policeman, who periodically lives with Frank and Marie and is often jealous of Ray's idyllic life.

I was very surprised at how good it was. The reason for its success is that it is not about just the nuclear family.

So they can never get away from the in-laws and they are up to one crazy thing after another. Patricia Heaton as Ray's wife Debra is the voice of sanity (the straight woman) in this show whereas Ray and his family are the comics.  They are utterly zany.

Of course, the humor may be lost on anyone who has never had to change a typewriter ribbon like the one Marie was using.  I also loved how Frank calls the Reader's Digest, &#34;The Digest&#34; and Raymond offers him $1,000 to stop calling it that.

818573,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B0001ZMWXW,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[5, 5]","When EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND got started, back in 1996, it started out at a slow and unassuming pace, introducing us to the delightfully off-the-wall shenanigans of the Barone family.  Ray Barone (Ray Romano) is a sports writer with two beautiful twin boys and a daughter (all played by the Sweetin children, younger siblings of Jodi Sweetin of FULL HOUSE fame), as well as a long suffering wife, Debra (Patricia Heaton), his older brother, Robert (Brad Garrett) and his parents, Marie (Doris Roberts) and Frank (Peter Boyle of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN fame).What sets this show apart from other programs is its matter-of-fact approach to the trials and tribulations of a very close knit family (sometimes, painfully close knit!).  These early episodes really set the pace for future episodes that only grew more and more hilarious.  The formative shows introduced us to the neurotic Robert, who went through a painful divorce and moved back in with his parents.  His mother, Marie, is overbearing, perfectionist and narcissistic, yet, she also genuinely wants what's best for her kids.  Granted, Ray and Robert are both in their mid thirties.  Frank, on the other hand, is unabashedly blunt, harsh and apathetic to human suffering (with the exception of the time he spent in Korea during the war).

Many shows hit their stride right out of the box and others have to adapt to the talents on hand and run with things that explode later on. It took a while for the writers of ""Raymond"" to find the voice of each character and form them accordingly. The now-iconic personalities didn't gel until the middle of the first season. But when they did, it became a legend.The writers weren't the only ones searching about. As just one example, actor Brad Garrett tinkered around before he found the literal voice of Robert: He completely altered his delivery from a coarse baritone to a mopey bass as he learned what clicked with the audience.It's fun watching the characters develop and the actors begin to own their parts. Romano will readily admit he's the weakest actor but - like Jerry Seinfeld - he tethers the rest of the cast together. And what a cast! Special props to Patty Heaton. She goes so much against the ""beleaguered sitcom wife"" stereotype that it's absolutely refreshing.My only complaint? No Play All function.

(It is WAY funnier that Seinfeld, which was more clever than funny, but apparently people confuse the two.) There is a real innocence to the first season that gradually eroded as the show progressed. It's as if the writers made a conscious decision to sacrifice the ""clean family sitcom"" image for ""edgy family sitcom"", without going so far as to sacrifice what made the show so enduring. When watching the first season in retrospect it's almost weird how well Ray and Debra get along here. Debra practically never yells at Ray and there's a cheesy ""conflict resolution"" scene between them at the end of almost every episode. Some people liked this side of their relationship when compared to other seasons and started to hate the show when it started to move away from this device. I don't care for it. I'd much rather have Debra yelling at Ray or vice versa every episode, it's funnier that way. Their constant arguing started getting annoying in the sixth season, but thankfully the writers got things back on track for the final three seasons.Season one has many typical sitcom plots and some are pulled of better than others. Only the episode ""Standard Deviation"" seems like it would be at home in later seasons. The actors were still trying to find their way as well. Brad Garret doesn't alter his baritone delivery until late in the season and Romano speaks in a bored, monotone voice.The pilot episode does a nice job of introducing the characters and setting up the premise as well as some running gags. Fans should get this season set just to see how radically different it is from the others and how far it came.

818612,A2AOC1GWSMD42O,B0001ZMWXW,Mad Track,"[7, 9]","This is one of the best family-oriented sitcom this decade.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" put a new twist on the family sitcom.  Most good ""family"" sitcom we know, such as Fullhouse, Growing Pains, and the Cosby Show, deals mostly with parents-children situation and tension.  ELR is different as it really focuses on the tension between a middle-aged man and his meddlesome parents.  Raymond's young children have relatively little cameo, though some episodes deal with them (e.g., Pet Cemetary, Micheal's Basketball).I think this TV show is great, simply because we all have similar situations that we can relate to.  And the older we get (middle-aged), the more likely these situation occurs.  For example, parents who come over all the time, or your mom who doesn't think your wife is ""good"" enough.  ELR takes those cases and put it in a comedic light.  The typical spousal tension is there as well, and the best episode for that is ""the Can Opener,"" shown in a later season.  There are other episodes where Debra (Ray's wife) and Ray get into each other nerve, but there are too many to count.For this first season, my favorite episodes are ""Standard Deviation"" and ""Who's Handsome.""  The first pilot episode is definitely different, and you can tell that the actors and actresses are still a little rusty and starting to get used to working among each other.  If you follow the first episode onward, you'll realized that certain things carried over to the next year and the next.  The ""fruit-of-the-month"" first brought up in the 1st episode has carried on to the 9th season!My girlfriend thinks that Friends is the best sitcom today, but she said that she enjoys ELR because it is more family-oriented.  I like it because I love to see Brad Garrett, the guy who plays Raymond's older and quirky brother.  He plays a brother who always feels second-place, and you can feel that weight in his face as the years go on.  How can you not like this guy!

In any case, this season is a very fun one to revisit and will undoubtedly take you back to the cast's much earlier days.Seasons 1 and 2 focused mostly on Ray, Debra and their very young family. 5-year-old Madylin Sweeten and her real-life brothers, 1-year-old twins Sullivan and Sawyer Sweeten, were sweet and fun to watch as such little kids. The characters, in general, were not nearly as developed as they became, which is all too natural, but the storylines were fresh and genuinely funny.It's not my favorite season, just because the characters were brand new and didn't have much to them quite yet (Ray and Debra barely even argued), but I enjoy watching the episodes to see how far everyone has come in these past 9 years. As always, it's nearly impossible not to pinpoint at least one of these characters who reminds you of someone you know from your own life, which is why it's so hilarious to watch.

The ""Roy"" joke is funny.YOUR PLACE OR MINE?: 3.5/10 Not really a good one, and it's kind of disturbing to see Marie babying Ray and Rob.IN-LAWS: 11/10: Mabye the best one? I think so.

818639,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B0001ZMWXW,Sylviastel,"[3, 6]","This show was probably a sleeper hit in a time of Friends and it's many copied sitcoms. This show is a family based sitcom with a stellar cast like New York Long Island comedian Ray Romano who finally got out of doing the standup routines that we knew him for finally got his own show like Drew Carey. The First season is still stellar when it comes to casting like PAtricia Heaton as the long-suffering wife and mother who stays home to take care of the kids. Ray's parents are perfectly casted with Emmy winners Peter Boyle and DOris Roberts as the veteran couple. Who doesn't love Frank and Marie? They live across the street from her son, his wife and grandchildren. THeir older son, Robert, lives with them also. He is played by another standup comedian, Brad Garrett. The show doesn't revolve around the children as much as it revolved around the interactions between Ray and Debra, Frank and Marie, Robert and Raymond, etc. Their plots are never stupid or out of this world or crazy like some shows. They all learn learn something from each other especially about tolerating each other's annoying habits like Marie comes over and criticizes Debra's household from cleaning to cooking, etc. According to Marie, Debra is sloppy and a terrible cook but she's not. Marie is acting like a typical mother-in-law and grandmother. Her husband, Frank, likes to sit with his zippers unzipped watching games. RObert is a police officer who always has an unhappy look on his face because his brother Raymond gets all the love including mom and dad. Ray is a sports writer who travels mostly in the first season. I love the episode in the first season where Debra's parents come from Connecticut and they are played by Robert Culp and Katherine Helmond to take the whole family out to a fancy French restaurant. Frank and Marie act like they have never been to somewhere there are too many silverware and glassware on the table and worrying about the cost. Ray remarks ""your parents and my parents don't belong in the same state."" After all, Debra's parents are cultured, world travellers who are planning a trip to Vietnam. Frank and Marie are just lucky enough to leave Long Island. They're just satisfied as they are but the two parents are worlds apart as we learn and Debra's upbringing included trips to museums and shows.",5,Why Everbody still loves this show?,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,2322,"['show', 'was', 'probably', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'time', 'Friends', 'many', 'copied', 'sitcoms', 'show', 'family', 'based', 'sitcom', 'stellar', 'cast', 'New', 'York', 'Long', 'Island', 'comedian', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'who', 'finally', 'got', 'doing', 'standup', 'knew', 'finally', 'got', 'own', 'show', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'First', 'season', 'still', 'stellar', 'when', 'casting', 'PAtricia', 'Heaton', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'mother', 'who', 'home', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'Ray', 'parents', 'are', 'perfectly', 'casted', 'Emmy', 'winners', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'DOris', 'Roberts', 'veteran', 'couple', 'Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'live', 'street', 'son', 'wife', 'grandchildren', 'older', 'son', 'Robert', 'also', 'played', 'standup', 'comedian', 'Brad', 'Garrett', 'show', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'children', 'as', 'much', 'revolved', 'interactions', 'Ray', 'Debra', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'Robert', 'Raymond', 'etc', 'plots', 'are', 'never', 'stupid', 'world', 'crazy', 'shows', 'learn', 'learn', 'something', 'other', 'especially', 'tolerating', 'other', 'annoying', 'habits', 'Marie', 'Debra', 'household', 'cleaning', 'cooking', 'etc', 'According', 'Marie', 'Debra', 'sloppy', 'terrible', 'cook', 'not', 'Marie', 'acting', 'typical', 'mother-in-law', 'grandmother', 'husband', 'Frank', 'sit', 'zippers', 'unzipped', 'watching', 'games', 'RObert', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'always', 'unhappy', 'look', 'face', 'brother', 'Raymond', 'love', 'including', 'mom', 'dad', 'Ray', 'sports', 'writer', 'who', 'mostly', 'first', 'season', 'love', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'Debra', 'parents', 'come', 'Connecticut', 'are', 'played', 'Robert', 'Culp', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'take', 'whole', 'family', 'fancy', 'French', 'restaurant', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'act', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'somewhere', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'silverware', 'glassware', 'table', 'worrying', 'cost', 'Ray', 'remarks', 'parents', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'same', 'state', 'Debra', 'parents', 'are', 'cultured', 'world', 'travellers', 'who', 'are', 'planning', 'trip', 'Vietnam', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'are', 'just', 'lucky', 'enough', 'leave', 'Long', 'Island', ""'re"", 'just', 'satisfied', 'are', 'two', 'parents', 'are', 'worlds', 'apart', 'learn', 'Debra', 'upbringing', 'included', 'trips', 'museums', 'shows']",Everybody Loves Raymond: Season 1
