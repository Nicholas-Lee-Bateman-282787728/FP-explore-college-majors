255178,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,630155163X,Alex Udvary,"[1, 3]","Bernardo Bertolucci is one of the all-time great directors. His films have an unmistakeable quality to them that just cry out Bertolucci.For the next two weeks there is going to be a Bernardo Bertolucci fest in town playing all of his feature films. Today I went to see this one. It was one of two films directed by Bertolucci I haven't seen (The other is ""La Luna"", which I also plan on seeing).At the time ""Before the Revolution"" was made Bertolucci was only 24 and had only directed one previous movie, ""The Grim Reaper"".While watching this movie one can gather Bertolucci is struggling for a style of his own. In his first film he burrowed from Kurosawa (Namely ""Rashomon"") here Bertolucci is influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, and would further explore this ""experiment"" in his next film, and one that I prefer over this ""Partner"". The first half of the movie is Godard and by the second half Bertolucci seemed to find his own rhythm. The movie contains that element of sexuality we expect from Bertolucci, but, it doesn't have the impact. He uses it in a more subtle context and not in the frank way he would later do in films such as ""Last Tango in Paris"", ""Stealing Beauty"", and his most recent film ""The Dreamers"".Another problem I had with the film is one that has already been addressed by reviewer ""R Jess"" who was correct when he said the movie carries a monotone feel to it. It does. The movie never quite goes from point ""A"" to ""B"", but instead seems stuck in first gear. The plot doesn't go anywhere.The movie is about Fabrizio (Francesco Barilli) a member of the Communist party and an affair he has with his aunt played by Adriana Asti after a friend named Agostino (Allen Midgette) meets an unfortunate fate.You're probably thinking I've given away too much just now, but, don't worry. That's just used as a springboard for where the film ultimately wants to go. Only I'm not convinced it reaches its destination.For one reason, and perhaps the most important, the politcal message of the film is not strong enough. The script written by Bertolucci and Gianni Amico doesn't devote enough time to this aspect of the film and no point is really made. The movie is not as clearly defined as should be.Bertolucci would later work with similiar material in his masterpiece ""The Conformist"". There Bertolucci is able to balance the sexuality and the politics of his story. ""Before the Revolution"" had the makings of a great film. I walked into it with very high hopes, but ""Revoltion"" was made by a director who was trying to find his voice. He would later find that voice and when he would few directors would be able to match his talent.But I've spent so much time telling you what I disliked about the film I haven't explained why I'm recommending it.The movie has beautiful cinematograpy by Aldo Scavarda. It's shot in black&white; and adds a tenderness to the story. The performances are fine, not entirely convincing, but not bad either. And finally I'm a sucker for Bertolucci. The talent was there but not put to its full effect.Bottom-line: This is one for fans of art films and Bertolucci buffs. Has a monotone feel to it and never quite takes off. The story doesn't go anywhere though Bertolucci does his best.",3,"Bertolucci ""Before"" He Found His Voice",1092441600,"08 14, 2004",2004,3230,"['Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'one', 'all-time', 'great', 'directors', 'films', 'have', 'unmistakeable', 'quality', 'just', 'cry', 'out', 'Bertolucci.For', 'next', 'two', 'weeks', 'going', 'be', 'Bernardo', 'Bertolucci', 'fest', 'town', 'playing', 'feature', 'films', 'Today', 'went', 'see', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'directed', 'Bertolucci', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'La', 'Luna', 'also', 'plan', 'seeing', 'time', 'Revolution', 'was', 'made', 'Bertolucci', 'was', 'only', '24', 'had', 'only', 'directed', 'one', 'previous', 'movie', 'Grim', 'Reaper', '.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'gather', 'Bertolucci', 'struggling', 'style', 'own', 'first', 'film', 'burrowed', 'Kurosawa', 'Namely', 'Rashomon', 'here', 'Bertolucci', 'influenced', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'would', 'further', 'explore', 'experiment', 'next', 'film', 'one', 'prefer', 'Partner', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Godard', 'second', 'half', 'Bertolucci', 'seemed', 'find', 'own', 'rhythm', 'movie', 'element', 'sexuality', 'expect', 'Bertolucci', ""n't"", 'have', 'impact', 'more', 'subtle', 'context', 'not', 'frank', 'way', 'would', 'later', 'do', 'films', 'such', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Stealing', 'Beauty', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Dreamers', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'one', 'already', 'been', 'addressed', 'reviewer', 'R', 'Jess', 'who', 'was', 'correct', 'when', 'said', 'movie', 'monotone', 'feel', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'point', 'A', 'B', 'instead', 'stuck', 'first', 'gear', 'plot', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere.The', 'movie', 'Fabrizio', 'Francesco', 'Barilli', 'member', 'Communist', 'party', 'affair', 'aunt', 'played', 'Adriana', 'Asti', 'friend', 'named', 'Agostino', 'Allen', 'Midgette', 'unfortunate', 'fate.You', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'given', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'just', 'used', 'springboard', 'where', 'film', 'ultimately', 'go', 'Only', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'destination.For', 'one', 'reason', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'politcal', 'message', 'film', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'script', 'written', 'Bertolucci', 'Gianni', 'Amico', ""n't"", 'devote', 'enough', 'time', 'aspect', 'film', 'point', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'not', 'clearly', 'defined', 'should', 'be.Bertolucci', 'would', 'later', 'work', 'similiar', 'material', 'masterpiece', 'Conformist', 'Bertolucci', 'able', 'balance', 'sexuality', 'politics', 'story', 'Revolution', 'had', 'makings', 'great', 'film', 'walked', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'Revoltion', 'was', 'made', 'director', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'voice', 'would', 'later', 'find', 'voice', 'when', 'would', 'few', 'directors', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'match', 'talent.But', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'telling', 'what', 'disliked', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'explained', 'why', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'it.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'cinematograpy', 'Aldo', 'Scavarda', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'tenderness', 'story', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'not', 'bad', 'finally', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'Bertolucci', 'talent', 'was', 'there', 'not', 'put', 'full', 'effect.Bottom-line', 'one', 'fans', 'art', 'films', 'Bertolucci', 'buffs', 'monotone', 'feel', 'never', 'quite', 'off', 'story', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'Bertolucci', 'best']",N/A

This attractive price makes it affordable to some of us on a budget. This Korean import plays on all U.S. DVD players and the English subtitles come on automatically, so it is easier to navigate than a lot other Asian imports with instructions written in their particular language of origin.The print is quite sharp with good contrast, and as far as my research went, it is also complete. The only drawback for today's buyers is that it is offered only in Wide Screen LETTERBOX format for older 4X3 TV sets, and is not Wide Screen ANAMORPHIC for HD Panels unlike the current Korean releases of ""Circus World"" and ""55 Days At Peking."" But, if you can live with this, this DVD of Bertolucci's first international hit, will do just fine.

255180,A280GY5UVUS2QH,630155163X,Doug Anderson,"[4, 4]","This is an early Bertolucci near masterpiece, directed in 1965 when he was 22. It is based on the novel Charterhouse of Parma by Stendhal. Its lead character Fabrizio like the novels character has an affair with his aunt. But the movie takes place in the 1960's and instead of fighting with Napolean at Waterloo as the earlier Fabrizio did this Fabrizio toys with communism. Of course anyone who knows Bertolucci knows he himself has toyed with communism(most notably in the film 1900)and the film is perhaps an autobiographical one in part. What prevents the film from rising to a higher level is the theatricality, perhaps artificiality, of certain scenes, but the overall feeling of student idealism is convincing probably because Bertolucci is still young. Fabrizio, like Bertolucci, is more artist than revolutionary and this film is dedicated more to beauty and music and artistic possibility than to social revolution. Not as great nor as sure footed an effort as the fully realized 1971's Conformist or 1972's Last Tango in Paris but if you love those films you will want to see this interesting and formidable though imperfect early effort as well. Spiders Stratagem is also available and recommended, a 1970 made for Italian television story of an anti-fascist murdered during a performance of Rigoletto based on a Borges story. The Partner, 1968, (which I would not recommend) is also available, a confused telling of a Dostoyevsky story, ""The Double"".",4,Bertolucci's early literary efforts,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1463,"['early', 'Bertolucci', 'masterpiece', 'directed', '1965', 'when', 'was', '22', 'based', 'novel', 'Charterhouse', 'Parma', 'Stendhal', 'lead', 'character', 'Fabrizio', 'novels', 'character', 'affair', 'aunt', 'movie', 'place', '1960', 'instead', 'fighting', 'Napolean', 'Waterloo', 'earlier', 'Fabrizio', 'did', 'Fabrizio', 'communism', 'course', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bertolucci', 'toyed', 'communism', 'most', 'notably', 'film', '1900', 'film', 'perhaps', 'autobiographical', 'one', 'part', 'What', 'film', 'rising', 'higher', 'level', 'theatricality', 'perhaps', 'artificiality', 'certain', 'scenes', 'overall', 'feeling', 'student', 'idealism', 'convincing', 'probably', 'Bertolucci', 'still', 'young', 'Fabrizio', 'Bertolucci', 'more', 'artist', 'revolutionary', 'film', 'dedicated', 'more', 'beauty', 'music', 'artistic', 'possibility', 'social', 'revolution', 'Not', 'great', 'sure', 'footed', 'effort', 'fully', 'realized', '1971', 'Conformist', '1972', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'love', 'films', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'interesting', 'formidable', 'imperfect', 'early', 'effort', 'well', 'Spiders', 'Stratagem', 'also', 'available', 'recommended', '1970', 'made', 'Italian', 'television', 'story', 'anti-fascist', 'murdered', 'performance', 'Rigoletto', 'based', 'Borges', 'story', 'Partner', '1968', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'also', 'available', 'confused', 'telling', 'Dostoyevsky', 'story', 'Double']",N/A

Fear not, this is not a clunky ideologue rendering Freud and Marx, but a lyric poet who spins what is poignant and wise about these thinkers into a black and white dream.  This movie has something to say about almost everything, but it is especially profound, absurdly funny, and heartbreaking on the subject of the middle class family.  It anticipates the 60s in a way that is also oddly prescient--this is a 60s movie made  just before the 60s.  Bertolucci's later films about youth and/or the 60s seem to be playing about the base of a summit established by this early movie.

255182,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,630155163X,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","While hailed as many as a masterpiece (or near), I struggled somewhat with Bertolucci's 2nd film, made when he was only 23, although I am a fan of his in general. Beautifully shot, great use of music and unconventional editing, the film is excellent on a film-making and craft level (although it perhaps borrows too liberally from leading film-makers of the era, especially Godard, Antonioni and Resnais).The story of a young bourgeois man trying to come to terms with his tear between his attraction to communism and his desire for an easier life leads him into an incestuous affair with his somewhat older aunt. I found it's themes somewhat muddled, alternating between being heavy-handedly spelled out, or so obtuse I wasn't sure what a given scene was saying.The acting in particular seems a bit all over the place; understated to the point of flatness in one scene, and then almost theatrically over the top the next. At the end I felt glad I'd seen the film, but it didn't stick with me the way Bertolucci's first film &#34;La Commare Secca&#34; or his third &#34;Partner&#34; did. (&#34;Partner&#34; deals with some of the same themes, but in a far more playful, often comedic way). There was a film-school sort of pretentiousness and emotional distance in &#34;Before the Revolution that kept me from feeling moved or from being led to think deeply about its ideas.That said, I plan to revisit it and see if my reaction changes, and certainly I enjoyed Bertolucci's already masterful use of image and sound, even if the ends he was using them to were a bit muddled for me.The region 2 BFI blu-ray is a gorgeous transfer, with only some odd dirt, and a short annoying section of stains on the print taking away from a generally first rate and striking looking disc.",4,Flawed but always interesting second feature by Bertolucci,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1772,"['hailed', 'as', 'many', 'masterpiece', 'struggled', 'somewhat', 'Bertolucci', '2nd', 'film', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'only', '23', 'am', 'fan', 'general', 'Beautifully', 'shot', 'great', 'use', 'music', 'unconventional', 'editing', 'film', 'excellent', 'film-making', 'craft', 'level', 'perhaps', 'too', 'liberally', 'leading', 'film-makers', 'era', 'especially', 'Godard', 'Antonioni', 'Resnais', '.The', 'story', 'young', 'bourgeois', 'man', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'tear', 'attraction', 'communism', 'desire', 'easier', 'life', 'incestuous', 'affair', 'somewhat', 'older', 'aunt', 'found', 'themes', 'somewhat', 'muddled', 'alternating', 'being', 'heavy-handedly', 'spelled', 'out', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'given', 'scene', 'was', 'saying.The', 'acting', 'particular', 'bit', 'place', 'understated', 'point', 'flatness', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'almost', 'theatrically', 'top', 'next', 'end', 'felt', 'glad', ""'d"", 'seen', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'way', 'Bertolucci', 'first', 'film', '34', 'La', 'Commare', 'Secca', '34', 'third', '34', 'Partner', '34', 'did', '34', 'Partner', '34', 'deals', 'same', 'themes', 'far', 'more', 'playful', 'often', 'comedic', 'way', 'was', 'film-school', 'sort', 'pretentiousness', 'emotional', 'distance', '34', 'Revolution', 'kept', 'feeling', 'moved', 'being', 'led', 'think', 'deeply', 'ideas.That', 'said', 'plan', 'revisit', 'see', 'reaction', 'changes', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'Bertolucci', 'already', 'masterful', 'use', 'image', 'sound', 'even', 'ends', 'was', 'using', 'were', 'bit', 'muddled', 'me.The', 'region', '2', 'BFI', 'blu-ray', 'gorgeous', 'transfer', 'only', 'odd', 'dirt', 'short', 'annoying', 'section', 'stains', 'print', 'taking', 'away', 'generally', 'first', 'rate', 'striking', 'looking', 'disc']",N/A
255183,A220FJEQNGMSRN,630155163X,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Before the Revolution is a ravishingly cinematic piece of work, with Bertolucci showing a real confidence with both camera and location that both serves and enhances the script. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it's an outstanding piece of cinema first and foremost - the politics is more a reflection of a universal weakness of character than a specific moment in time a la Godard (the film was adapted and updated from Stendhal's The Charterhouse of Parma). Even the movie references don't gall the way they almost always do in modern films because Bertolucci not only puts them into context with the other arts (literature, music, painting, photography) but makes them personal obsessions that are part of character - the movie buff isn't just there to talk about Bertolucci's favorite films, or even to point out that in cinema style is content: it's simply how that character communicates by equating life to art. A surprisingly exciting piece of cinema.The very impressive Italian PAL 2-disc set offers a superb widescreen transfer with English subtitles and a wide array of interviews, all with English subtitles, with cast, crew, academics and directors influenced by the film, including several not included on the BFI's forthcoming Blu-ray release.
