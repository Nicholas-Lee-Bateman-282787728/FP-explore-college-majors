486133,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,6305972885,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[4, 4]","One of the best WWII movies I have ever seen, and the only one I recall from Holland. The first time I saw this I was amazed by the fact this was one of the best foreign films I had seen up to the mid 80s. I had seen Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner a few years before I caught this movie and I thought he was great. After I saw this I knew it. This is by far one of his best dramatic roles, if not his best. Anyone that enjoys war movies will probably like it. If you enjoy the dramatic ones like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Das Boot"" you will definitely enjoy it. Although it is a bit long it did not seem long to me since the pace was good. Keep an open mind about when it was made when you see the special effects and you will find it both compelling and a movie of craftmanship. I have ordered this on DVD because it is difficult to find anyone renting this any longer. Unfortunately it is not a mainstream war movie so most the local rental stores don't carry it. I highly recommend you see it and any fan of war movies will probably want it for their collection.",4,Excellent Foreign WWII movie,1080864000,"04 2, 2004",2004,1061,"['One', 'best', 'WWII', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'recall', 'Holland', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'amazed', 'fact', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'foreign', 'films', 'had', 'seen', 'up', 'mid', '80s', 'had', 'seen', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'few', 'years', 'caught', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'saw', 'knew', 'far', 'one', 'best', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'not', 'best', 'Anyone', 'war', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'dramatic', 'ones', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Das', 'Boot', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'long', 'pace', 'was', 'good', 'Keep', 'open', 'mind', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'see', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'find', 'compelling', 'movie', 'craftmanship', 'have', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'difficult', 'find', 'anyone', 'renting', 'longer', 'not', 'mainstream', 'war', 'movie', 'so', 'most', 'local', 'rental', 'stores', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'fan', 'war', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'collection']",Soldier Of Orange
486134,A3N94LNED0IF0R,6305972885,Charles S. Tashiro,"[16, 23]","I first saw ""Soldier of Orange"" in the early '80s and remembered it as a well-made, intelligent war/action film. I looked forward to seeing it again, both to see if my memory was justified and to answer a question that had been nagging me for several years. Nothing about my memory of the film suggested much similarity to the subsequent work of its director, Paul Verhoeven. So I was curious to see what, if anything, looked forward to his other films.That question was answered in the first sequence, as the protagonist, Eric (Rutger Hauer) is initiated into the boyish antics of university life. As punishment for trying to shirk the hazing, Eric's future friend Gus (Jeroen Krabbe) smashes a bowl of soup over his head. As Eric falls to the floor unconscious, the blood, noodles and broth mingle in a mess on the floor. This combined carnality and violence is Verhoeven's signature, and while the film doesn't have as much sex as some of the director's later work, it otherwise is in keeping with his almost obsessive fixation on sensuality.Still, the DVD was vaguely disappointing, partly because the transfer is rather dark. More fundamentally, while ""Soldier"" is indeed intelligent, it may be too sophisticated for its own good. We get a believably broad look at the range of reactions among the Dutch to the Nazi occupation, from resistance, to acquiescence, to active collaboration. Far from the flawless heroes of Hollywood, Eric, Gus and their friends are frail, fearful, heroic almost by accident. The problem is, these Realistically drawn characters do not make very compelling centers for an epic. We may sympathize, even recognize a bit of ourselves, but it's hard to get excited by action caused as much by the characters' blunders as by their intentions.Yet despite these Realistic details, the characters drop in and out of the story so frequently it's difficult to recognize who they are. This fragmentation of the relationships may be necessary to preserve the forward movement of the action, but the result is neither a compelling war drama, nor an insightful exploration of character. Only Gus and Eric are portrayed in any depth, but that doesn't help either, since they are marked as much by their posing and vacillation as by their heroism.The film moves quickly, and despite the messiness of the story, no one will be bored by it. You are equally unlikely, however, to be very satisfied by it. In the last scene, one of the other characters says to Eric about his wartime experiences ""I survived."" (I'm not giving anything away, here, incidentally, since the film starts in flashback.) That comment summarizes the film's interests and limitations. ""Soldier of Orange"" is ultimately not about Idealistic Heroes proving themselves but the grubby realities of getting on in an ugly situation. Interesting, perhaps, but not an epic.",3,Not Quite,989712000,"05 13, 2001",2001,2854,"['first', 'saw', 'Soldier', 'Orange', 'early', ""'80s"", 'remembered', 'well-made', 'intelligent', 'war/action', 'film', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'see', 'memory', 'was', 'justified', 'answer', 'question', 'had', 'been', 'nagging', 'several', 'years', 'Nothing', 'memory', 'film', 'suggested', 'much', 'similarity', 'subsequent', 'work', 'director', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'So', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'anything', 'looked', 'forward', 'other', 'films.That', 'question', 'was', 'answered', 'first', 'sequence', 'protagonist', 'Eric', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'initiated', 'boyish', 'antics', 'university', 'life', 'punishment', 'trying', 'shirk', 'hazing', 'Eric', 'future', 'friend', 'Gus', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'bowl', 'soup', 'head', 'Eric', 'floor', 'unconscious', 'blood', 'noodles', 'mingle', 'mess', 'floor', 'combined', 'carnality', 'violence', 'Verhoeven', 'signature', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'sex', 'director', 'later', 'work', 'otherwise', 'keeping', 'almost', 'obsessive', 'fixation', 'sensuality.Still', 'DVD', 'was', 'vaguely', 'disappointing', 'partly', 'transfer', 'rather', 'dark', 'More', 'fundamentally', 'Soldier', 'indeed', 'intelligent', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'sophisticated', 'own', 'good', 'get', 'believably', 'broad', 'look', 'range', 'reactions', 'Dutch', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'resistance', 'acquiescence', 'active', 'collaboration', 'Far', 'flawless', 'heroes', 'Hollywood', 'Eric', 'Gus', 'friends', 'are', 'frail', 'fearful', 'heroic', 'almost', 'accident', 'problem', 'Realistically', 'drawn', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'very', 'compelling', 'centers', 'epic', 'may', 'sympathize', 'even', 'recognize', 'bit', 'ourselves', 'hard', 'get', 'excited', 'action', 'caused', 'much', 'characters', 'blunders', 'intentions.Yet', 'Realistic', 'details', 'characters', 'drop', 'story', 'so', 'frequently', 'difficult', 'recognize', 'who', 'are', 'fragmentation', 'relationships', 'may', 'be', 'necessary', 'preserve', 'forward', 'movement', 'action', 'result', 'compelling', 'war', 'drama', 'insightful', 'exploration', 'character', 'Only', 'Gus', 'Eric', 'are', 'portrayed', 'depth', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'are', 'marked', 'much', 'posing', 'vacillation', 'heroism.The', 'film', 'moves', 'quickly', 'messiness', 'story', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'are', 'equally', 'unlikely', 'however', 'be', 'very', 'satisfied', 'last', 'scene', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'Eric', 'wartime', 'survived', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'here', 'incidentally', 'film', 'flashback', 'comment', 'film', 'interests', 'limitations', 'Soldier', 'Orange', 'ultimately', 'not', 'Idealistic', 'Heroes', 'proving', 'grubby', 'realities', 'getting', 'ugly', 'situation', 'Interesting', 'perhaps', 'not', 'epic']",Soldier Of Orange
486135,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6305972885,C. O. DeRiemer,"[31, 31]","This is a first-rate movie of WWII and, in my view, the best movie Paul Verhoeven has made to date. The Germans invade The Netherlands and a group of six university friends are caught up in the events that follow. Some join the Resistance and remain in the country, one tries to ignore what's happening, two escape to England to be trained for a dangerous mission, one joins the SS. The lead character is played by Rutger Hauer. It is he and his friend, played by Jeroen Krabbe, who make their way across the Channel. The movie is long but moves briskly and is full of incidents that are gripping and cinematic. The mission that sends Hauer and Krabbe back to their country goes very wrong, and people die as a result. The Hauer character, who was based on a real person, survives the war. Most of his friends don't. One who does, managed to survive by having to make a terrible choice. In fact, all the choices this group of friends make are simply shown with the consequences. There are no false heroics or tin nobility. Perhaps because of this, the movie was not especially well-received when it first opened in The Netherlands.If any of Verhoeven's movies are watched forty years from now, I suspect this will be the one. Starship Troopers and RoboCop are a lot of fun, but they're essentially comic book movies before comic book movies became Hollywood's latest fashion. Total Recall and Basic Instinct are, to me, efficient but little more. Soldier of Orange is the work of a guy who understands a character-driven story and who has the skills to turn it into a dramatic but still character-driven movie.Hauer and Krabbe are both excellent. Krabbe continues to work at being an excellent actor. He takes the money for some foolish stuff, but also selects many interesting films to appear in. But what happened to Hauer? He took on so many fifth-rate starring roles it was almost as if he were challenging someone to dare try to talk to him about his choices. I don't know if it was pig-headed self-destruction, but I find it hard to look at Hauer's career without shaking my head. And he is so good in this movie.If you like RoboCop and Starship Troopers -- and I do -- (or Fatal Instinct or Total Recall), do yourself a favor and check out Soldier of Orange. I doubt you'll regret it.The DVD transfer is excellent.",5,An Excellent Movie From Verhoeven,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,2321,"['first-rate', 'movie', 'WWII', 'view', 'best', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'made', 'date', 'Germans', 'invade', 'Netherlands', 'group', 'six', 'university', 'friends', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'events', 'follow', 'join', 'Resistance', 'remain', 'country', 'one', 'tries', 'ignore', 'what', 'happening', 'two', 'escape', 'England', 'be', 'trained', 'dangerous', 'mission', 'one', 'SS', 'lead', 'character', 'played', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'friend', 'played', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'who', 'make', 'way', 'Channel', 'movie', 'long', 'briskly', 'full', 'incidents', 'are', 'gripping', 'cinematic', 'mission', 'Hauer', 'Krabbe', 'back', 'country', 'very', 'wrong', 'people', 'die', 'result', 'Hauer', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'war', 'Most', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'One', 'who', 'managed', 'survive', 'having', 'make', 'terrible', 'choice', 'fact', 'choices', 'group', 'friends', 'make', 'are', 'simply', 'shown', 'consequences', 'are', 'false', 'heroics', 'tin', 'nobility', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'especially', 'well-received', 'when', 'first', 'opened', 'Netherlands.If', 'Verhoeven', 'movies', 'are', 'watched', 'forty', 'years', 'now', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'RoboCop', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', ""'re"", 'essentially', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'became', 'Hollywood', 'latest', 'fashion', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'are', 'efficient', 'little', 'more', 'Soldier', 'Orange', 'work', 'guy', 'who', 'character-driven', 'story', 'who', 'skills', 'turn', 'dramatic', 'still', 'character-driven', 'movie.Hauer', 'Krabbe', 'are', 'excellent', 'Krabbe', 'work', 'being', 'excellent', 'actor', 'money', 'foolish', 'stuff', 'also', 'many', 'interesting', 'films', 'appear', 'what', 'happened', 'Hauer', 'took', 'so', 'many', 'fifth-rate', 'starring', 'roles', 'was', 'almost', 'were', 'challenging', 'someone', 'dare', 'try', 'talk', 'choices', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'pig-headed', 'self-destruction', 'find', 'hard', 'look', 'Hauer', 'career', 'shaking', 'head', 'so', 'good', 'movie.If', 'RoboCop', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'do', 'Fatal', 'Instinct', 'Total', 'Recall', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'Soldier', 'Orange', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'regret', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent']",Soldier Of Orange
486136,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6305972885,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[35, 42]","I first saw SOLDIER OF ORANGE several years ago and then rewatched it this week. My reaction to the film on the second viewing was very different. I've visited the Netherlands many times (my mother was Dutch descent) and have known for years Rotterdam was leveled by the Nazis. Since it has been completely rebuilt, the sadness of the WWII bombing for me until now has been that I could no longer visit the lovely old buildings that existed before the war. How shallow I have been.I live 5 blocks from the Pentagon, and on Sept. 11 when I drove home from work, I saw first hand the aftermath of an act of war. (My husband saw the blast from his office window.) I have friends who were in NYC or the at the Pentagon on Sept. 11. My friend Mike was in NYC for a meeting and packing to return when he heard the first explosion. As the first tower fell, he ran like mad from the Marriott that used to be in the WTC complex. Mike was barefooted and cut his feet to pieces. I asked him why he did not slip on his shoes before he ran. He says he did not want to appear in public wearing loafers with no socks. As Mike ran body parts rained down on him. He is shaking and breaks down in tears everytime he talks about it, but his psychiatrist tells him to keep talking about it.So, when I watched SOLDIER OF ORANGE last night, and I saw Rutger Hauer's reaction to seeing body parts and broken babbling people after a Nazi bombing, I understood how little I had known before Sept. 11 and that bravery is relative. Some people like Donald Rumsfield stay on the job and pull people out of the wreckage. Some people run like mad. Some hide until the dust clears. Not until terrible events occur do any of us know how we will react.Verhoeven's rendering of SOLDIER OF ORANGE is brilliant. The story concept is straighforward--follow the experiences of an ordinary group of young Dutch men who are all friends at university, who over the course of the film experience the halcyon days of college life and the destruction of their homeland via war and its aftermath.Verhoeven shows how each of these young men reacts to events beyond their control. These are ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances. A few of them do end up in uniform (opposing sides). One man cannot stand to see a Jew mistreated and he intervenes to his sorrow. Another has a German mother so he joins the Nazis. One is Jewish and must attempt an escape. Another hides out and continues his eductation, acquiring his degree behind closed doors. Another dies in a concentration camp. Yet another joins the RAF after a series of misadventures and becomes a hero.Someone once said to me they thought Tom Hanks was miscast in Speilberg's RYAN, to which I replied, but he's just like my Uncle Paul who received a battlefield commission and a chest full of medals when he was the last man standing in a fight in southern France. Gentle Uncle Paul who went home to Illinois after the war, resumed his life as a printer and never did another bold thing.I think this story is fabulous--an exploration of how real people behave during unreal times, which Verhoeven seems to understand. My DVD is excellent with vivid shots of the Netherlands and England twenty years ago when folks still rode bicycles. What a hoot to see a troop of soldiers on bikes!! (The film contains some hilarious scenes, even in war funny things happen.) The DVD contains a commentary with  Verhoeven and others similar to the CRITERION films.",5,"Real people, real events.....",1004745600,"11 3, 2001",2001,3465,"['first', 'saw', 'SOLDIER', 'OF', 'ORANGE', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'rewatched', 'week', 'reaction', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'very', 'different', ""'ve"", 'visited', 'Netherlands', 'many', 'times', 'mother', 'was', 'Dutch', 'descent', 'have', 'known', 'years', 'Rotterdam', 'was', 'leveled', 'Nazis', 'been', 'completely', 'rebuilt', 'sadness', 'WWII', 'bombing', 'now', 'been', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'visit', 'lovely', 'old', 'buildings', 'existed', 'war', 'How', 'shallow', 'have', 'been.I', 'live', '5', 'blocks', 'Pentagon', 'Sept.', '11', 'when', 'drove', 'home', 'work', 'saw', 'first', 'hand', 'aftermath', 'act', 'war', 'husband', 'saw', 'blast', 'office', 'window', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'NYC', 'Pentagon', 'Sept.', '11', 'friend', 'Mike', 'was', 'NYC', 'meeting', 'packing', 'return', 'when', 'heard', 'first', 'explosion', 'first', 'tower', 'fell', 'ran', 'mad', 'Marriott', 'used', 'be', 'WTC', 'complex', 'Mike', 'was', 'barefooted', 'cut', 'feet', 'pieces', 'asked', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'slip', 'shoes', 'ran', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'appear', 'public', 'wearing', 'loafers', 'socks', 'Mike', 'ran', 'body', 'parts', 'rained', 'down', 'shaking', 'breaks', 'down', 'tears', 'everytime', 'psychiatrist', 'keep', 'talking', 'it.So', 'when', 'watched', 'SOLDIER', 'OF', 'ORANGE', 'last', 'night', 'saw', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'body', 'parts', 'broken', 'babbling', 'people', 'Nazi', 'bombing', 'understood', 'how', 'little', 'had', 'known', 'Sept.', '11', 'bravery', 'relative', 'people', 'Donald', 'Rumsfield', 'stay', 'job', 'pull', 'people', 'wreckage', 'people', 'run', 'mad', 'hide', 'dust', 'clears', 'Not', 'terrible', 'events', 'occur', 'do', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'react.Verhoeven', 'rendering', 'SOLDIER', 'OF', 'ORANGE', 'brilliant', 'story', 'concept', 'straighforward', 'follow', 'experiences', 'ordinary', 'group', 'young', 'Dutch', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'university', 'who', 'course', 'film', 'experience', 'halcyon', 'days', 'college', 'life', 'destruction', 'homeland', 'war', 'aftermath.Verhoeven', 'how', 'young', 'men', 'events', 'control', 'are', 'ordinary', 'men', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'few', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'uniform', 'opposing', 'sides', 'One', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'see', 'Jew', 'mistreated', 'sorrow', 'German', 'mother', 'Nazis', 'One', 'Jewish', 'must', 'attempt', 'escape', 'out', 'eductation', 'acquiring', 'degree', 'closed', 'doors', 'concentration', 'camp', 'RAF', 'series', 'misadventures', 'hero.Someone', 'once', 'said', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'miscast', 'Speilberg', 'RYAN', 'replied', 'just', 'Uncle', 'Paul', 'who', 'received', 'battlefield', 'commission', 'chest', 'full', 'medals', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'fight', 'southern', 'France', 'Gentle', 'Uncle', 'Paul', 'who', 'went', 'home', 'Illinois', 'war', 'resumed', 'life', 'printer', 'never', 'did', 'bold', 'thing.I', 'think', 'story', 'fabulous', 'exploration', 'how', 'real', 'people', 'behave', 'unreal', 'times', 'Verhoeven', 'understand', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'vivid', 'shots', 'Netherlands', 'England', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'folks', 'still', 'rode', 'bicycles', 'What', 'hoot', 'see', 'troop', 'soldiers', 'bikes', 'film', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'even', 'war', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Verhoeven', 'others', 'similar', 'CRITERION', 'films']",Soldier Of Orange

486142,A319KYEIAZ3SON,6305972885,Mary Whipple,"[8, 8]","Winner of the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Foreign Film in 1979, Soldier of Orange is based on the memoir of the same name by Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, one of the founders of the Dutch Resistance, aide to Queen Wilmelmina during her exile in England, and RAF Pathfinder pilot in the last days of the war. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, the film dramatizes the traumatic effects of the Nazi occupation on Holland, and the often futile attempts to form a local Dutch Resistance.Location scenes provide stunning realism--from the boisterous hazing of students in Leyden, where Hazelhoff (known in the film as Lanshof) was a law student, to the beach of Scheveningen, where Lanshof and his friends attempted to cross the Channel to England by small boat, and the streets of The Hague, where one of Lanshof's friends is seen late in the war.Often said to be the best film ever made in Holland and the best film ever made by Paul Verhoeven, the film is also the best film ever made by Rutger Hauer, who plays the role of Lanshof with great panache. Jereoen Krabbe, playing his best friend, Guus LeJeune, is equally good in his role as a long-time friend from Leyden and hero of the Resistance. Focusing on these two men and four friends who react to the Occupation in different ways, the film brings to life the choices made by people in occupied Holland. Of the 144 who, like Lanshof and LeJeune, escaped and then made the decision to return to Holland to set up a Resistance, only 28 survived.Beautifully photographed by Jost Vacano, the film gives a sense of the helplessness of Holland's small army against the Nazi juggernaut, the beauty of the countryside, and the victimization of the Dutch people as they faced subjugation.  Though the torture scenes are graphic and brutal, the film is so well done and so involving that one even forgets the film has subtitles.  Hazelhoff continues this story in his recent autobiography, In Pursuit of Life, which I strongly recommend, not only to fans of this film and the book which inspired it, but to anyone interested in fine writing and a fascinating life story.

Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do.  Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role.  Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.  So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end, &quot;april fools day&quot;, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.)  See this as soon as possible.
