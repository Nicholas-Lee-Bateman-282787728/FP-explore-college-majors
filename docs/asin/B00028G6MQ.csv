Enter this DVD. What was an impulse buy at (forgive me, I attend college in a small town that doesn't even have a Best Buy) Wal-Mart, has instantly become one of my favorites discs. This guy does stand-up in a truly unique way, at no point in his act does he ever appear to be having anything but a good time. I can appreciate anyone who loves their job that much! Plus the guy's freakin' hilarious. Buy this DVD!

Be warned though, he uses a TON of profanity in here. Seeing him on TV, I thought he was relatively clean. That's not the case. Most of his jokes rely on profanity for the punchline.

826644,A9WXHV15BK7W,B00028G6MQ,Emil Sinclair,"[9, 9]","While most Americans do not know who he is, Pablo Francisco gained national attention in the late 1990s when he became a regular performer on MADtv. After his stint at Fox, he appeared in other TV shows doing live stand-up comedy and went on tour with Carlos Mencia and the late Freddy Soto. He still maintains a busy schedule performing around the country, especially at his favorite venue, the Improv in Los Angeles where many famous American comedians have performed.In this DVD, Francisco gives his most brilliant comedic performance. His vocal impressions of famous personalities, combined with his ability to devise ridiculous yet hilarious situations, make him a pleasure to watch. For example, he impersonates Don LaFontaine to simulate a fictional movie trailer about Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting the Italian mafia's encroachments on his tortilla-selling business.Throughout Bits and Pieces, Francisco jokes about many things like strip club dancers, body piercings, NASCAR racing, Viagra users, Latino music, and softcore pornography. While he lacks the genius of comedians such as Richard Pryor, his work is still very funny. His ability to keep audience members in a continued state of laughter is a testament to his excellent comedic skills.",5,Outstanding,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,1256,"['most', 'Americans', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'Pablo', 'Francisco', 'gained', 'national', 'attention', 'late', '1990s', 'when', 'became', 'regular', 'performer', 'MADtv', 'stint', 'Fox', 'appeared', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'doing', 'live', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'went', 'tour', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'late', 'Freddy', 'Soto', 'still', 'busy', 'schedule', 'performing', 'country', 'especially', 'favorite', 'venue', 'Improv', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'where', 'many', 'famous', 'American', 'comedians', 'have', 'performed.In', 'DVD', 'Francisco', 'most', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'performance', 'vocal', 'impressions', 'famous', 'personalities', 'combined', 'ability', 'devise', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'make', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'example', 'Don', 'LaFontaine', 'simulate', 'fictional', 'movie', 'trailer', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'fighting', 'Italian', 'mafia', 'encroachments', 'tortilla-selling', 'business.Throughout', 'Bits', 'Pieces', 'Francisco', 'about', 'many', 'things', 'strip', 'club', 'dancers', 'body', 'piercings', 'NASCAR', 'racing', 'Viagra', 'users', 'Latino', 'music', 'softcore', 'pornography', 'genius', 'comedians', 'such', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'work', 'still', 'very', 'funny', 'ability', 'keep', 'audience', 'members', 'continued', 'state', 'laughter', 'testament', 'excellent', 'comedic', 'skills']",Pablo Francisco - Bits And Pieces: Live From Orange County

826647,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00028G6MQ,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[9, 9]",Pablo Francisco is funny as hell. Pure and simple. He's got way different material than most comedians today and he uses sound effects he produces himself to make things funny. He has your typical comedian jokes about porn. But then he'll begin to talk about the music they play in porn. And his impressions are great too. Like of the guy who narrates the movie commercials is just brilliant and then doing an impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger selling tacos on TV. Stuff like that. This guy is a step behind George Carlin in my oppinion. Absolutely hilarious. A++++,5,Funny As Hell.
