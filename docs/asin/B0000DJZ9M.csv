While some of the video is inoffensive, most of it is simply political and personal Ono promotional propaganda.  I felt as it she was in the room picking my pocket.  And what she did to the ""Happy Christmas"" video is a crime!  I'll never be able to listen to it again without images of dead babies coming to mind.  Yes, Lennon was a peace activist. I get it!  But give it a rest Yoko.  My advice is to either pass on this DVD (and buy the CD) or turn the cr@ppy video off while listening to the beautiful 5.1 mix.",2,"Beware, Ono promo video...",1170720000,"02 6, 2007",2007,667,"['love', 'music', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'hear', 'many', 'John', 'best', 'solo', '5.1', 'surround', 'BUT', 'where', 'praise', 'release', 'video', 'inoffensive', 'most', 'simply', 'political', 'personal', 'Ono', 'promotional', 'propaganda', 'felt', 'was', 'room', 'picking', 'pocket', 'what', 'did', 'Happy', 'Christmas', 'video', 'crime', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'listen', 'again', 'images', 'dead', 'babies', 'coming', 'mind', 'Yes', 'Lennon', 'was', 'peace', 'activist', 'get', 'give', 'rest', 'Yoko', 'advice', 'pass', 'DVD', 'buy', 'CD', 'turn', 'cr', '@', 'ppy', 'video', 'listening', 'beautiful', '5.1', 'mix']",N/A

But the working class was not and is still not restricted to the West, nor are the fans for John Lennon nor indeed the Beatles. He was big and exceedingly memorable in our time on this planet something that we all share.This DVD is a very good biography of John Lennon with loads of his photos when he was a small kid: of his home, his parents etc. And with the coming of the videos, we have ample clips of him singing or else in his own words, ""doing time"" watching the ""wheels""... Without the consent of his wife, the viewers may not be able to have sight of them all.The video starts from his complaint (in his song) that his parents brought him into this lonely world (obviously without his consent) without giving him sufficient support: young Lennon felt he needed his parents more than they needed him! The tone was that of a rebel and was rather coarse. And then as seen from his lyrics, it was his wife who taught him ""the meaning of success"", something that we expect his parents or else his teachers to have done. Then in ""Woman"", his tone started to change. It became more and more tender and was wonderfully sublime in ""Beautiful Boy"". And then his attention turned to the injustice of this crazy world reaching a climax at ""Happy X'mas"" which was so ironic... Obviously, the focus changed from the meaning of success to the meaning of life itself.Even as an oriental, I take no delight in watching his wife on this DVD. But without his wife, John Lennon would not be the same. Maybe he would be better off, we really don't know. But the choice was purely his, and without his wife his songs would be very different. We won't be able to see lots of things here or anywhere else to start with...Since my love for music is not restricted to the classics, or the pop or even jazz, I feel touched by the life of Lennon even as depicted here or at least by the path that he had taken as shown here. And, other than fame and fortune, isn't his life essentially the same as ours after all: the same fluidity, the same fragility and the same stupidity, albeit at different spots on this lonely planet?The music here is great, and so precious are the pictures and the clips albeit that occasionally things had been inserted or deleted. But so long as Lennon was there, it is good enough. Photography was superb or even a bit far fetched, well, it is only a matter of taste after all.In any event, for those who don't have more authentic videos of John Lennon and if you are looking for a comprehensive and enjoyable overview of him, sound and sight, or even as a historical documentary, this might be the one for you.",5,Let There be No Provinciality in Music,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,2702,"['one', 'lyrics', 'Lennon', 'was', 'someone', 'big', 'working', 'class', 'working', 'class', 'was', 'not', 'still', 'not', 'restricted', 'West', 'are', 'fans', 'John', 'Lennon', 'indeed', 'Beatles', 'was', 'big', 'exceedingly', 'memorable', 'time', 'planet', 'something', 'share.This', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'biography', 'John', 'Lennon', 'loads', 'photos', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'kid', 'home', 'parents', 'etc', 'coming', 'videos', 'have', 'ample', 'clips', 'singing', 'else', 'own', 'words', 'doing', 'time', 'watching', 'wheels', 'consent', 'wife', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'sight', 'all.The', 'video', 'starts', 'complaint', 'song', 'parents', 'brought', 'lonely', 'world', 'obviously', 'consent', 'giving', 'sufficient', 'support', 'young', 'Lennon', 'felt', 'needed', 'parents', 'more', 'needed', 'tone', 'was', 'rebel', 'was', 'rather', 'coarse', 'then', 'seen', 'lyrics', 'was', 'wife', 'who', 'taught', 'meaning', 'success', 'something', 'expect', 'parents', 'else', 'teachers', 'have', 'done', 'Then', 'Woman', 'tone', 'started', 'change', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'tender', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'sublime', 'Beautiful', 'Boy', 'then', 'attention', 'turned', 'injustice', 'crazy', 'world', 'reaching', 'climax', 'Happy', ""X'mas"", 'was', 'so', 'ironic', 'Obviously', 'focus', 'changed', 'meaning', 'success', 'meaning', 'life', 'itself.Even', 'oriental', 'take', 'delight', 'watching', 'wife', 'DVD', 'wife', 'John', 'Lennon', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'choice', 'was', 'purely', 'wife', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'lots', 'things', 'here', 'anywhere', 'else', 'start', 'love', 'music', 'not', 'restricted', 'classics', 'pop', 'even', 'jazz', 'feel', 'touched', 'life', 'Lennon', 'even', 'depicted', 'here', 'least', 'path', 'had', 'taken', 'shown', 'here', 'other', 'fame', 'fortune', ""n't"", 'life', 'essentially', 'same', 'ours', 'same', 'fluidity', 'same', 'fragility', 'same', 'stupidity', 'albeit', 'different', 'spots', 'lonely', 'planet', 'music', 'here', 'great', 'so', 'precious', 'are', 'pictures', 'clips', 'occasionally', 'things', 'had', 'been', 'inserted', 'deleted', 'so', 'long', 'Lennon', 'was', 'there', 'good', 'enough', 'Photography', 'was', 'superb', 'even', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'well', 'only', 'matter', 'taste', 'all.In', 'event', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'authentic', 'videos', 'John', 'Lennon', 'are', 'looking', 'comprehensive', 'enjoyable', 'overview', 'sound', 'sight', 'even', 'historical', 'documentary', 'might', 'be', 'one']",N/A

Mother is a new one. Jealous Guy is taken from ""Gimme Some Truth"". Power to the People looks like the one from Lennon Collection with some new editing. Cold Turkey:  John and Yoko made a video for this one, which I remember on the ""Collection"" and liked it... but this was made from the NYC concert. They should have put both on there, but I guess footage of John singing won out. I liked ""Mind Games"" in this version though. ""Whatever Gets You..."" is from the Collection, a cartoon based on John's drawings (not really for kids but cute). #9 Dream and Stand by Me you've probably seen before. ""Starting Over"" is an all new video similar to the Beatles ""Free as a Bird"" montage, it would fit in with today's music videos. ""Woman"" is the original promo. ""Beautiful Boy"" and ""Watching the Wheels"" look like new versions of home movie footage. ""Nobody Told Me"" has been reedited from the original promo. ""Borrowed Time"" is another one that looks like the same people who made ""Starting Over"" did this one. Pretty cool. ""Working Class Hero"" is dark, but why is it near the end?""Happy Xmas"" is definitely not for kids, lots of shocking graphic footage of war wounded and war dead, some of it recent.""Give Peace a Chance"" is reedited somewhat.The videos are more hit than miss.The extras are great: two J& Y films (it's clean), ""Imagine"" from 1975 for Lew Grade (John's last live appearance), ""Slippin and Slidin"" (from OGWT), and ""Working Class Hero"" plays behind John talking about his life, which is pretty cool. A picture gallery is on there, as well as some of John's well-known drawings and poetry.The surround mix is a nice welcome addition, and the 1980-era recordings sound great.

779294,A1XN4GCNV16DF0,B0000DJZ9M,M. Neal,"[104, 106]","I have so many mixed feelings about this DVD. While I welcome and look forward to all John Lennon releases, this particular collection has both great features and some stumbling points.To begin with, the sound is stunning. Most of the songs have been remixed in 5.1 and are almost revelatory in their clarity and power.The only problem I have with the release are some of the actual videos themselves. It should be noted that all of the video used itself looks fabulous, considering it was primarily sourced from obsolete analog formats. Here goes:1. Imagine: More or less the same footage we've all come to know and love, with much greater clarity.2. Instant Karma: This is a live performance, and really great to watch.3. Mother: A simple montage of photos, but effective. Can someone explain the strange addition of Brian Epstein in this video however?4. Jealous Guy: Footage of John singing the vocal track in the studio, mixed with the boat rowing footage from Imagine.5. Power to the People: A truly bad video visually, it looks like a seventh grade slide-show presentation6. Cold Turkey: Another live performance synched to the studio version.7. Mind Games: This has some really wonderful footage of John wandering around NYC mingling with people, dancing, and such. One of the better videos, and only marred by a quick shot of John from the morgue. I found that element really distasteful.8. Whatever Gets You Through the Night: This video is superb. It features a number of John's drawings animated and colorized.9. #9 Dream: This is an interesting video with footage from one of John and Yoko's short films called Smile. Something about the footage of John really struck me, as he appears so natural and relaxed. It's kind of amusing that May Pang's vocals on the song are made to appear to be Yoko's in the video.10. Stand by Me: Live footage previously seen on ""The Old Grey Whistle Test""11.(Just Like) Starting Over: This is initially a very, very emotional and harrowing video. It begins with the premise of where John would be now had he lived, which is a terrific and powerful concept. However, rather than sticking with that idea, the video degenerates into cheesy looking graphics of the photos flying around everywhere. It's ultimately redeemed, but I think they bungled the chance for something truly great.12. Woman: Footage of Yoko...the same video that was released by Yoko in 1981.13. Beautiful Boy: This is a home video of Sean playing and talking with Yoko, and John sort of sitting there and talking to other people. I think this video was in really poor taste as it's a song that John wrote about how much he loved Sean. Shouldn't the video focus on--maybe I'm crazy--him and Sean?? Especially considering ALL the footage of the both of them available?14. Watching the Wheels: Okay, there's some redemption to the above as this video features mostly footage of John and Sean together. Very nice to watch.15. Nobody Told Me: A compilation of old Imagine footage and clips of John with Andy Warhol, Miles Davis, etc. It's ok, but not really anything we haven't seen before.16. Borrowed Time: Has lots of home footage and outtakes from previously unavailable sources...17. Working Class Hero: A really good video filmed at Strawberry Fields and John's childhood home. It's nice to see that footage, but again, the phantom of John's death is paraded out again. Sadly, these images are prevalent throughout the DVD. It's just not something I think John would want drawn so much attention, too. Why not focus on the positive aspects of his life, and message more?18. Happy Xmas (War Is Over): This is a brilliant video, and while some have critized it as Yoko politicizing, I think it's artistically great and I think John would have completely approved.19. Give Peace a Chance: Includes the Bed-in footage, various protests, and--again--vigils for John in 1980.Overall, it's a must buy if you're any kind of John Lennon fan. It's good in that either the beginning John Lennon fan, or the long time devotee is going to find something good to see.
