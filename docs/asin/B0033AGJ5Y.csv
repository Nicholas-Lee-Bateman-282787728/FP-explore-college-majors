1319753,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0033AGJ5Y,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 1]","Eat Pray Love starring Julia Roberts has gotten some harsh reviews but I enjoyed this real-life story about a woman's journey to find her own path in life. Roberts performance is quite good and I like how she takes time to really learn who she is as a woman without a man defining who or what she is. Yes, she does break some hearts including her husbands and her rebound boy toy but Robert's character is trying to find her own happiness instead of depending on a man's ""idea"" of happiness. Along the way, she does learn to love again but first she must learn to love herself.

1319761,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0033AGJ5Y,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I have so many issues with this film I'm almost hesitant to even write this review, since I don't really know how to start it.  I mean, what is there to say that wouldn't sound like a random checklist of insults to the film?Maybe I should start with a synopsis.Based on the memoirs of Elizabeth Gilbert, a young woman who abandoned her marriage and her `life as she knew it' for a lesson in self-discovery by scouring the globe in search of meaning in her life.  She went to Rome, India and Bali.  She ate, with little regard for her waistline.  She meditated with mixed results and she fell in love for the second (and longest) time.Sadly, that is kind of all there is here.  The film doesn't dig into the meat of Liz well enough to create something more than superficial.  Even the basis for her divorce seems selfish and underdeveloped.  I understand that she and her husband were `different people' but that is the case in every relationship and Liz came across as a selfish and stubborn woman who was tired of not getting everything she wanted, despite not fully knowing what it was that she wanted.  The places she goes are beautiful and the food she eats looks scrumptious, but there is no weight added to her actions.  She seems one-note, desperate for something but not fully aware of what that something is.  And her revelations come about in a way that breathes a lot of contradiction into the film; for the message seems unevenly toned.  Her adventures lack depth and development and give the air of pointless pandering, failing to emotionally connect to the audience.  And then there are sequences and plot lines that defy all logic.  Normally one would have to suspend disbelief with cinematic musing, but a film that is adapted from a memoir needs to have a feeling of realism that `Eat Pray Love' lacks.It makes no sense to me that Liz would be so well received instantaneously by complete strangers, but that is just me.Julia Roberts is a good actress.  She's not great, but she's good, and she's better when she allows the natural charm of her comedic skills to take over (don't take yourself too seriously) so when she gets angry and tries to act upset she comes across awkward and unsure of herself, but when she giggles and smiles and charms the audience it works gloriously.  Thank god for Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem, who OWN this film.  Their supporting characters are the most engaging, and their superior acting skills completely take over their scenes; especially Jenkins who breaks your heart in a million pieces while maintaining quick wit and sharp delivery.  Viola Davis is underused (I wish she had been the film's star) and James Franco is a hot mess, emphasis on `mess'.  UGH, and Billy Crudup, who is not high on my list of favorite actors, was just PERFECT here.But really, cast aside, it was Ryan Murphy who destroyed this film.  His handling of the material was so vapid, and the poor editing choices (the flashback scenes were terribly spliced in) made the actors performances seem worse than I'm sure they were (especially Franco, who came across terribly green).With moments of manipulated sympathies that come across more corny than sincere, `Eat Pray Love' will make you want to fast.",2,Longwinded lack of substance...,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,3233,"['have', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'film', ""'m"", 'almost', 'hesitant', 'even', 'write', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'start', 'mean', 'what', 'there', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'sound', 'random', 'checklist', 'insults', 'film', 'Maybe', 'should', 'start', 'synopsis.Based', 'memoirs', 'Elizabeth', 'Gilbert', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'abandoned', 'marriage', 'life', 'knew', 'lesson', 'self-discovery', 'scouring', 'globe', 'search', 'meaning', 'life', 'went', 'Rome', 'India', 'Bali', 'ate', 'little', 'regard', 'waistline', 'meditated', 'mixed', 'results', 'fell', 'love', 'second', 'longest', 'time.Sadly', 'kind', 'here', 'film', ""n't"", 'dig', 'meat', 'Liz', 'well', 'enough', 'create', 'something', 'more', 'superficial', 'Even', 'basis', 'divorce', 'selfish', 'underdeveloped', 'understand', 'husband', 'were', 'different', 'people', 'case', 'relationship', 'Liz', 'came', 'selfish', 'stubborn', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'tired', 'not', 'getting', 'everything', 'wanted', 'not', 'fully', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'wanted', 'places', 'are', 'beautiful', 'food', 'scrumptious', 'weight', 'added', 'actions', 'one-note', 'desperate', 'something', 'not', 'fully', 'aware', 'what', 'something', 'revelations', 'come', 'way', 'lot', 'contradiction', 'film', 'message', 'unevenly', 'toned', 'adventures', 'lack', 'depth', 'development', 'give', 'air', 'pointless', 'pandering', 'failing', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'audience', 'then', 'are', 'sequences', 'plot', 'lines', 'defy', 'logic', 'Normally', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'cinematic', 'musing', 'film', 'adapted', 'memoir', 'have', 'feeling', 'realism', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'lacks.It', 'sense', 'Liz', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'well', 'received', 'instantaneously', 'complete', 'strangers', 'just', 'me.Julia', 'Roberts', 'good', 'actress', 'not', 'great', 'good', 'better', 'when', 'natural', 'charm', 'comedic', 'skills', 'take', 'over', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'so', 'when', 'angry', 'tries', 'act', 'upset', 'awkward', 'unsure', 'herself', 'when', 'smiles', 'audience', 'gloriously', 'Thank', 'god', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'who', 'OWN', 'film', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'engaging', 'superior', 'acting', 'skills', 'completely', 'take', 'over', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'heart', 'million', 'pieces', 'maintaining', 'quick', 'wit', 'sharp', 'delivery', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'underused', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'film', 'star', 'James', 'Franco', 'hot', 'mess', 'emphasis', 'mess', 'UGH', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'who', 'not', 'high', 'list', 'favorite', 'actors', 'was', 'just', 'PERFECT', 'here.But', 'really', 'cast', 'aside', 'was', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'who', 'destroyed', 'film', 'handling', 'material', 'was', 'so', 'vapid', 'poor', 'editing', 'choices', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'were', 'terribly', 'spliced', 'made', 'actors', 'performances', 'seem', 'worse', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'especially', 'Franco', 'who', 'came', 'terribly', 'green', '.With', 'moments', 'manipulated', 'sympathies', 'come', 'more', 'corny', 'sincere', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'fast']",Eat Pray Love

1319763,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B0033AGJ5Y,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[1, 2]","This excellent movie begins as the Roberts character's life is falling apart after divorce so much so that she can not even enjoy the things she previously enjoyed food and love,and can not even be comforted by a teacher(being under the influence of teachers gurus or a theme here). This type of story was made in the 40's and later remade by bill murray(one of the best of modern comics)as Razor's edge(somerset maugham). This is  a different story based on a new book. The divorce shows the man looking for traditional values,stability,where as the woman flighty,seems to move among many relationships, a very commom feature of modern culture,normalized,as the animating romantic figures as our mind are looked for on the outside world rather than the other way around,or as the movie shows in terms of values. So where off to Italy,to a home with little running water,and none of the comforts science has brought to modern life,from here on the lack of typical comforts are important and the character muses inanger 'jesus' as if in shock. She also changes perspectives,she is shown around an italian home situation, and around the city of naples,and the values are'experienced' not authorized by the men,a theme in this movie. This is a similar theme of a man looking for values and stability in her earler filmmystic pizza. we also hear a great man,someone to look for,is someone who cares for children,but she also comments on the many good women shes talked too.Then where off to India the land of 'bagavad giya.' Here we are seen the value of service in this religious culture,however it was in the west as well but never really taught. She feels disconnected..a texan who is briefly on the scene tells her you must master your mind...she has control isues...unspiritual and to the religious 'sick.' A typical modern man..Jesus' sermons can always be seen in this kind of controlling person. Using everyone for theor own ends....she needs to be transformed however she does get married...then off to bali single again...she meets a brazilian...i guess showing an american inrelation to people from different backgrounds. She doesnt want a husband...but healing,like the old shamans can perform. She is injured..bloody...and gets a medicine person offering this kind of service. She meets a brazilian whorepresents the old portugueese,the wisdom of the west who was too disposed ofafter caring for children,they both seek enlightenment a catch phrase in the west where after the decline of religion a new life was opening up...but here in its reverse format saving them from what science has brought the modernworld...the story ends showing her as someone who lost her balance in waywardsociety and learning through traditional religion of east and west and finding wholeness and help...and she learns all  ""given my experience""...and the film ends on a boat trip a phallic symbol of love...Julia roberts has brought a really grown up story to the screen and she really plays the role great! We are interested in her personal story and the tale is not lost in its myriad locations as we develop greater interest in her as the tale moves on...and we see the changes in the story. The director-writer may disagree and star on how i see their story,but its a story all too people have gone through all over the place..that's why everyone should see it",4,great movie..very original,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",2012,3355,"['excellent', 'movie', 'Roberts', 'character', 'life', 'falling', 'apart', 'divorce', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'enjoy', 'things', 'previously', 'enjoyed', 'food', 'love', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'comforted', 'teacher', 'being', 'influence', 'teachers', 'gurus', 'theme', 'here', 'type', 'story', 'was', 'made', '40', 'later', 'remade', 'bill', 'murray', 'one', 'best', 'modern', 'comics', 'Razor', 'edge', 'somerset', 'maugham', 'different', 'story', 'based', 'new', 'book', 'divorce', 'man', 'looking', 'traditional', 'values', 'stability', 'where', 'woman', 'flighty', 'move', 'many', 'relationships', 'very', 'commom', 'feature', 'modern', 'culture', 'normalized', 'animating', 'romantic', 'figures', 'mind', 'are', 'looked', 'outside', 'world', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'movie', 'terms', 'values', 'So', 'where', 'off', 'Italy', 'home', 'little', 'running', 'water', 'none', 'comforts', 'science', 'brought', 'modern', 'life', 'here', 'lack', 'typical', 'comforts', 'are', 'important', 'character', 'inanger', ""'jesus"", 'shock', 'also', 'perspectives', 'shown', 'italian', 'home', 'situation', 'city', 'naples', 'values', ""are'experienced"", 'not', 'authorized', 'men', 'theme', 'movie', 'similar', 'theme', 'man', 'looking', 'values', 'stability', 'earler', 'filmmystic', 'pizza', 'also', 'hear', 'great', 'man', 'someone', 'look', 'someone', 'who', 'children', 'also', 'comments', 'many', 'good', 'women', 'shes', 'talked', 'too.Then', 'where', 'off', 'India', 'land', ""'bagavad"", 'giya', 'Here', 'are', 'seen', 'value', 'service', 'religious', 'culture', 'however', 'was', 'west', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'really', 'taught', 'disconnected..a', 'texan', 'who', 'briefly', 'scene', 'must', 'master', 'mind', 'control', 'isues', 'unspiritual', 'religious', 'typical', 'modern', 'man..Jesus', 'sermons', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'seen', 'kind', 'controlling', 'person', 'Using', 'everyone', 'theor', 'own', 'ends', '.she', 'be', 'transformed', 'however', 'get', 'married', 'then', 'bali', 'single', 'again', 'brazilian', 'i', 'guess', 'showing', 'american', 'inrelation', 'people', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'doesnt', 'want', 'husband', 'healing', 'old', 'shamans', 'can', 'perform', 'injured..bloody', 'medicine', 'person', 'offering', 'kind', 'service', 'brazilian', 'old', 'portugueese', 'wisdom', 'west', 'who', 'was', 'too', 'disposed', 'ofafter', 'caring', 'children', 'seek', 'enlightenment', 'catch', 'phrase', 'west', 'where', 'decline', 'religion', 'new', 'life', 'was', 'opening', 'up', 'here', 'reverse', 'format', 'saving', 'what', 'science', 'brought', 'modernworld', 'story', 'showing', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'balance', 'waywardsociety', 'learning', 'traditional', 'religion', 'east', 'west', 'finding', 'wholeness', 'help', 'given', 'experience', 'film', 'boat', 'trip', 'phallic', 'symbol', 'love', 'Julia', 'brought', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'story', 'screen', 'really', 'role', 'great', 'are', 'interested', 'personal', 'story', 'tale', 'not', 'lost', 'myriad', 'locations', 'develop', 'greater', 'interest', 'tale', 'moves', 'see', 'changes', 'story', 'director-writer', 'may', 'disagree', 'star', 'how', 'i', 'see', 'story', 'story', 'too', 'people', 'have', 'gone', 'place..that', 'why', 'everyone', 'should', 'see']",Eat Pray Love
1319764,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B0033AGJ5Y,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[6, 11]","My friend Pati read this book and was bowled away by it, so when my friend Madeleine decided she wanted to see the movie I willingly agreed.  After seeing it, my impression of the movie's message is that ""the meaning of life is guys.""  Wow, what a concept.The heroine started out the film with a perfectly nice guy, went through a mid-life crisis and dumped him to eat her way through Italy, meditate and scrub floors in India, and find another guy in Bali.  She just came full circle.  It seemed to me she'd have saved herself a whole lot of money--let alone scrubwoman's hands--by simply staying with the first guy.  Oh well, what do I know?It's not that I didn't understand where she was at; God knows I've done my own world travelling trying to find happiness and meaning, and I've done my own fair share of soul searching in the process.  Heaven knows I've certainly tried finding the meaning of life in one guy or another, but the truth is, there is no meaning of life beyond what you yourself give it.  If guys are your thing, then guys it is.The fairy princess notion, however, that guys are the ""meaning"" of it all places a huge burden on them, and it's one that no human being can or even should attempt.  It's doomed to failure from the outset, which is probably why so many marriages collapse.  The whole notion of ""happily ever after"" in which people, especially female people, are encouraged to believe is very unstable.  That happy couple in the wedding photo will probably be the grumpy pair arguing over breakfast about some trivial difference of opinion.  Our society's answer to the disappointment is to discard one relationship for another that will be ""better"" than the last.  In the end marriage becomes ""all about me.""  While this makes big bucks for the billion dollar wedding industry, I doubt it does anything for anyone else.  It certainly doesn't help the children sometimes caught up in the discord.The most important thing that people need to remember is that romance novels rarely have sequels that feature the same lovers.  This is a telling detail.  Once the ""happily ever after"" arises out of the turmoil of frustrated love, the lovers cease to exist for us.  After all, did the movie go on to tell us all about the boring details of the lives of the new ""happy couple?""  Nope.  Unfortunately it's the boring details that constitute most of life.  The couple may cease to be lovers, but they don't ""go on"" as they were before.  Either their relationship matures, or it doesn't and they're both back where they started again.The most important things I learned in my own odyssey were about me.  I'm still learning them, too, because like most people, I don't really think I need to change.  I just know you can't run away from yourself.  You're always there, where ever it is you go, and you need to learn to live with the person you are no matter where you are!  As the heroine says midway through the movie, ""Ruins are life's way of teaching us something.""  Yup, it's ""live with it!""By the end of the film I felt like the producers had foisted off another romance movie on me.  I felt that they said, ""Yup. It's all true; all you need to do is find the ""right guy,"" and you'll live happily ever after. And that's the meaning of life.""

She comes across despite her obvious attractiveness as a genuine person with many levels on the screen. This role was no exception.Having not read the book, I have nothing but, the movie to comment on. I enjoyed it.  The characters were interesting and complex. Liz, Julia's character, essentially did what many women do, absorb their boyfriend's/husband's interests and make them their own. Often time, laying their own interests aside.This character combines her interests in travel with her search for herself.  Ironically one of her choices India combines a former boyfriend's interest in a particular guru. This I found a bit odd. Maybe his interest awakened one in her.The ending which I will not reveal here, was to me a bit ironic and counter-intuitive.  Especially with the character's gut punch reaction.

Now don't get me wrong, I've been a long time fan of Julie Roberts since the early days, and thoroughly enjoyed Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill, and Charlie Wilson's War.  What's happened to her acting talents since then is a mystery.  Roberts acting range these days seems to be limited to either a fast talking loud mouth adolescent or an emotionally collapsed, poor me, lost soul wandering through life.  I think directors, producers, and writers get blindsided by all of the hype around a star. From my point of view, Julia Roberts amazing lack of depth in this role is responsible for the failure of the film. Even Javier Bardem couldn't save it.  Julia's song I fear, has been sung.Eat, Pray, Love's heroine should have been a younger, more earthy woman who could bring to life the emotional trauma in her marriage, her lusty full bodied eating adventures in Italy, and finally some reasonable realistic interpretation of having found some serenity and peace through self-exploration and the mysteries of meditation.  They should have held auditions before committing.(Perhaps Rachel McAdams in The Notebook - an Oscar performance if I ever saw one).Ryan Murphy is a talented writer and director who produced the racy Nip/Tuck, and the now highly popular Glee.  We know he's talented so what happened with Eat, Pray, Love? Did he allow Roberts to interpret the role for him?  Sure looks that way, as hischaracters on Nip/Tuck were complex. At least Viola Davis was in it, and she brings a depth to any role you see her in. The film for all its beauty in parts was as shallow as Roberts acting.  What a shame!  So many of us who read the book were looking forward to a great fun movie and in the end it was disposable.Viola Davis - A+ - Javier Bardem - A - Richard Jenkins - A -Julia Roberts - D.",2,Retire Julia Roberts!,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,1916,"['knew', 'moment', 'heard', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'was', 'cast', 'lead', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'movie', 'was', 'doomed', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'been', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'early', 'days', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Charlie', 'Wilson', 'War', 'What', 'happened', 'acting', 'talents', 'then', 'mystery', 'Roberts', 'acting', 'range', 'days', 'be', 'limited', 'fast', 'talking', 'loud', 'mouth', 'adolescent', 'emotionally', 'collapsed', 'poor', 'lost', 'soul', 'wandering', 'life', 'think', 'directors', 'producers', 'writers', 'get', 'blindsided', 'hype', 'star', 'point', 'view', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'amazing', 'lack', 'depth', 'role', 'responsible', 'failure', 'film', 'Even', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'Julia', 'song', 'fear', 'been', 'sung.Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'heroine', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'younger', 'more', 'earthy', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'bring', 'life', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'marriage', 'lusty', 'full', 'bodied', 'eating', 'adventures', 'Italy', 'finally', 'reasonable', 'realistic', 'interpretation', 'having', 'found', 'serenity', 'peace', 'self-exploration', 'mysteries', 'meditation', 'should', 'have', 'held', 'auditions', 'committing', 'Perhaps', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Notebook', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', '.Ryan', 'Murphy', 'talented', 'writer', 'director', 'who', 'produced', 'racy', 'Nip/Tuck', 'now', 'highly', 'popular', 'Glee', 'know', 'talented', 'so', 'what', 'happened', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'Did', 'allow', 'Roberts', 'interpret', 'role', 'Sure', 'way', 'hischaracters', 'Nip/Tuck', 'were', 'complex', 'least', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'was', 'depth', 'role', 'see', 'film', 'beauty', 'parts', 'was', 'as', 'shallow', 'Roberts', 'acting', 'What', 'shame', 'So', 'many', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'were', 'looking', 'forward', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'end', 'was', 'disposable.Viola', 'Davis', 'A+', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', '-Julia', 'Roberts', 'D']",Eat Pray Love

Yet not even her enormous mouth can save this mess.You can fast-forward the first 29 minutes or so as it's all slow back story. I did not and now I'll never get those 29 minutes of my life back.Now once Ms. Roberts lands in Italy the movie starts to come to life. The friends she makes in Italy and the scenarios involving food, gestures, joining soccer fans in Napoli and exploring Rome make for a fantastic movie. That movie I wanted to see.Sadly, as soon as that gets started it's over and off to India. Landing in India we get that helter skelter taxi cab ride through the bizarre culture shock that is the Asian subcontinent. Then the movie reverts back to slow as molasses boredom in an ashram. Sorry, I just cannot handle navel-gazing hippy nonsense. That whole section of the flick I did fast-forward.Then onto Bali where the story of Julia's journey actually started in the ""fillum."" There it's pretty much hit and more miss as Javier No Country and her start a romance that is fine for what it is but involves way too much neurosis on Julia's part.So I'd say overall Eat is excellent, Pray is hideous and Love is just mediocre. Personally, I would have liked to have dumped Julia and stayed in Rome to follow her close friends--the Swedish woman and her Italian boyfriend. Now they were an infinitely more interesting couple than No Country for Bali and Erin Bali-no-vich.DVD has a director's cut and a making of extra with the director going on and on about how wonderful this tale was.

We should all be as lucky as Elizabeth Gilbert. Her memoir, ""Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia,"" has sold millions, been on the ""New York Times"" Best Seller list for 158 weeks, and touched the lives of thousands. One of them was Oprah Winfrey, who devoted two whole episodes of her show to the book. I admit that I haven't read it, but I have done a little research on it and on Gilbert herself. I have to say, I don't much care for her or her story. Her journey of discovery, paid for by an advance on a novel she plans to write, seemed awfully selfish, for she had no real absences in her life; she was married, had an education, was a successful writer, and lived comfortably in New York. This wasn't enough for her?The film ""Eat Pray Love,"" which adapts Gilbert's story and has her portrayed by Julia Roberts, tells us that no, it wasn't enough. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), who, in an early divorce settlement scene, gave me more reason to side with him than with her. She has an affair with an attractive and all-around nice young actor (James Franco), which she then ends in a brazen display of tears brought on by God knows what. She then decides that it's time to take a year off and travel the world, to reconnect with herself, to once again have a zest for life - in other words, to escape from all the good things she had but never appreciated. She proceeds to spend four months in Italy, where she happily eats as much pasta and pizza as she can, with a few Napoleons on the side. She then spends the next four months in an Indian ashram, where the tries her hand at meditation, apparently under the impression that God can be grasped in one fell swoop. Finally, she goes to Bali, where she's presented with, but not necessarily willing to accept, love.Along the way, she just happens to meet a number of people. Never mind the fact that they all greatly impact her life, as such people tend to do in stories like this; it's a miracle they can all speak fluent English. One of them, wouldn't you know it, just happens to be from the great state of Texas. In Italy, she befriends a sassy Swede and a charming Italian, a couple who look like they stepped out of a Giorgio Armani ad. In India, she meets the Texan (Richard Jenkins), a loveably gruff old man whose every line sounds like it originated from a fortune cookie. He, of course, has his own tragic back story, although he only shares it at just such a time when it's most convenient for the plot. In Bali, she reunites with the obligatory wise elder (Hadi Subiyanto), the long suffering divorcee (Christine Hakim), and Felipe (Javier Bardem), who enters her life as men tend to do in most forgettable romantic comedies.There's nothing about this movie that feels authentic, and that's what infuriates me; it has the gall to pass itself off as an autobiography. I don't care how accurate Elizabeth Gilbert claims it is (she said during a ""Good Morning America"" interview that it played like a ""surreal home movie""). I don't believe her. This is the stuff of movies, not real life. Besides, she didn't visually document her journey at all - not a single photo, not a frame of film. All the more reason not to believe her. With so much doubt about the story's authenticity, and with Gilbert's questionable dismissal of the good life she so clearly had before making the journey, the film lacks any sense of spiritual enlightenment or emotional awakening; it comes off as little more than a portrait of a selfish woman on a sightseeing trip.Julia Roberts is a wonderful actress, and even though I disliked the woman she played, I still thought she gave a good performance. Javier Bardem seems to be channeling the same dashing mystique he employed in the much, much better ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" which is to say he seems to be repeating himself, albeit competently. As for James Franco, let's just say that my mother has coined the perfect phrase for actors that display no range and speak in monotone lulls: ""They've just gotten a Novocain enema."" I don't know what director Ryan Murphy told him, but whatever he said, it was terrible advice. Franco is usually a very reliable, very convincing actor. Ever seen ""Milk""? Hell, ever seen ""Spider-Man""?""Eat Pray Love"" is phony, contrived, and unpleasant, made worse by the fact that we're supposed to take it as fact. Don't bother sending me comments that I'm wrong and that everything in the film comes directly from Gilbert's actual experiences. I'm not going to believe you. If the filmmakers had followed the leads of the people behind ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and ""Letters to Juliet,"" who had the decency to label their films as works of fiction, then maybe I would have appreciated it more. But then again, no, I wouldn't have; there's still the matter of Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quest for meaning and happiness was really an exercise in trendy New Age mantra-talk and selfishness.

1319785,A3E8BTA2SXPV3P,B0033AGJ5Y,cinemagirl,"[336, 459]","Let me preface this by mentioning I haven't read the book, though I've been meaning to, and after seeing the film first, I can only hope the book form is better. As a travel buff, I've been looking forward to watching this film, and I knew from the get-go that this would be a film about a woman's ennui and unfulfilled life. Yes, I know, first world problems--cue roll of the eyes. But I think many people can relate to the emptiness that pervades life on occasion.That being said, even as someone sympathetic to this kind of plight, I found the character Liz to be utterly insufferable and a practically impossible woman to relate to. The film has Liz, lying in bed with her husband, looking bored and lonely. She gets out of the bed she shares with her husband to go downstairs to literally kneel down and ask for God's help for the first time, sobbing in the room of her multi-million dollar home. The problem with this entire premise is that her emptiness isn't presented in a way that is relatable to the audience. With film, the exercise is to convey what is inside by external means; the audience cannot magically divine what is going on with the characters. I understand what the INTENT was: her husband doesn't have the travel bug; her husband has ideas but doesn't stick to a single one to make it his passion; her husband doesn't share her curiosity of life, an inclination for what is MORE; she has it all but is still unsatisfied--there's no spark, no excitement. But for me these were not conveyed convincingly. Instead, we have Julia Roberts (playing Julia Roberts) crying, staring at the wall, yelling, acting like an overgrown brat with an alarming sense of entitlement. She purports to look within, but she doesn't. She turns her rage to those around her, and that's a fatal flaw in the film from which it never recovers.The premise is very promising and intriguing: woman with all the trappings of life searches for more meaning in life by empowering herself--after all, it is often touted that money cannot buy happiness, and there are situations in real life where people who don't have much are happier than those with a lot (more money, more problems). Depression, for example, doesn't skip a person just because he or she is wealthy. Money and material goods are clearly not guaranteed keys to happiness and fulfillment. But instead of taking the opportunity to lay that foundation and build upon this premise, the filmmakers seem to skip it altogether in favor of pretty travel shots, apparently unable to take on the storytelling task. Is it difficult, especially in this economy, to make a film about the dissatisfaction and existential angst of a well-off woman? Yes. But it is not impossible, and if they are going to make a film based on this premise, they better well try to sway the audience. Unfortunately, they seem to just rely on Julia Roberts' ""America's Sweetheart"" status to replace effective narrative. The idea itself is interesting; the execution is the problem (most people can relate to the experience of seeing a fantastic trailer for a film or reading a film summary and getting excited, only to be disappointed after seeing the actual film).In a meeting with the lawyers and her husband, Liz glares at her husband with the fire of a thousand suns, resenting him for being, well, him. Rightfully, her husband frustratingly informs her that she never sat him down to tell him what's wrong, never gave him a chance to try to fix it if she had such a problem in the marriage. The audience really only sees what ANNOYS her (e.g., he wants to do a postgraduate degree, he doesn't want to go to Aruba). Are these ""flaws"" big enough for her to just walk out one day? At least this warrants a serious sit-down talk about each of their goals and feelings, right? No. Liz doesn't feel connected to him, and instead of sitting down like adults, she decides to leave, cold turkey, because if you don't get what you want out of life, the lesson is you must drop all your problems and run. It is understandable for someone to want to end a marriage if she is unhappy, but to just cut it off abruptly without a serious discussion (and assuming abuse or infidelity haven't occurred, which, in this film, they haven't) is unreasonable and paints the person as a spoiled brat who never learned how to navigate life in an adult world. This is a bad start to a film...an unsympathetic protagonist. Oh, God, how many more minutes do we have to spend with this woman? Did she really just leave her husband because some medicine man in Bali six months before told her one of her marriages would be short? Really? How gullible are you, Liz? The filmmaker really missed out on capitalizing on one genuine moment in the film -- her husband, in the elevator after the meeting with the lawyers, looking truly broken by his wife's abrupt abandonment. Do we get to explore her need to do this in spite of her husband's deep love for her? No, we get Liz's three-second look at his broken figure before she decides to run abroad an cavort with strangers who are meant to fix all her problems.Throughout the film, Liz makes no real decisions; rather, she allows others to do the thinking for her, which makes for tiresome viewing. The writing and direction are aimless and sloppy. Far too much of the film is spent on her romance with a struggling actor, David (James Franco), who is more of a caricature than someone along the road who truly enlightens Liz and helps her on her journey. He's young. He's handsome. He follows an Indian guru (shrine adorning his apartment), sounds like a fortune cookie, and is a complete poser. He states he has never been to India, but he wants to one day, and spends his day looking sexily forlorn, a tortured soul, when, in fact, he's just like those wannabe Goths who shop at Hot Topic (except he's the hippie version). One day, he wakes up to find half of his bed empty. Where's Liz? She has moved herself to the floor beside the bed, looking like someone just killed her puppy. Again, she doesn't talk about the problem. She just moved her bed to the floor like a petulant child because, again, as with her husband, she's unfulfilled and wants to break up for no discernible reason. Okay, maybe Prozac is in order?We are meant to take away from this romance the idea that David inspired Liz's trip to India. After all, she never would have known about that guru if it weren't for this poser. Get it, audience? Each person she meets is like a clue to the next spot on the treasure map. Get it? Except the character of David is so hastily written and lazily portrayed that the impact of his influence is negligible (seriously, James Franco looked like he phoned-in his scenes, and even he admitted that he knows the film is terrible and that he only did this film to have the experience of working with Julia Roberts).The Italy chapter of the film is the most enjoyable, simply because it plays like a fun travelogue -- food porn, fun people, pretty sights. Here, we get a little break from Liz's overbearing personality. We meet some other characters who welcome Liz with open arms, and there are beautiful shots of quaint cafes and restaurants, plates of delicious food, and beautiful cityscapes. For once, we get to see Liz just ENJOYING herself without lashing out, and for a moment the audience can forget Liz as Liz; she's just an American enjoying Italy like any tourist would, looking at Italy with new eyes.I expected the film to escalate and become even more profound as we head to India, but the narrative takes a serious and boring dip here. You know all the foodcentric tie-ins in the promotion of this movie? It ends with Italy, and it is understandable, seeing that Italy is the ""eat"" of the triumvirate, but since the spirituality aspects of India and Bali are so clumsily portrayed that one cannot help but feel cheated by the rest of the film. Okay, if we can't have genuine spirituality, at least show how decadent the other places are. There's more to India and Bali than ashrams and huts. It's as if the writers and filmmaker didn't know what to do about India. ""Hm, what's India known for? Gods! And poor people. Okay, this part of the film will be about Gods and poor people. It'll be like a spiritual thang."" So we have Liz living in an ashram, cleaning and doing practically nothing, and this is where she meets a Texan named Richard, played by the amazing Richard Jenkins, the highlight of the film. Though his character is paper-thin, Jenkins is so gifted and nuanced in his acting that he's able to flesh out a full character out of practically nothing. He's like your favorite uncle who wise-cracks and kicks you in the seat of your pants once in a while to set you straight. It is too bad that his character disappears rather quickly, which deflates the rest of the film. The writers try to flesh out India by introducing a 17-year-old girl forced into an arranged marriage (a heavy-handed parallel to Liz's own marriage, complete with flashbacks), but by then it is too late. Chapter 2 is already dead in the water. There's no spiritual enlightenment, just a disrespectful fast food approach to prayer and meditation. You just sit quietly, cross your legs, close your eyes, and spread your arms out. That's all, folks.The film then skips abruptly to Bali, as if it did all it could do in India. Here we have the return of the toothless guru, who, like the Franco character, speaks like a fortune cookie and appears more like a stereotype more than anything else. Liz refers to him as ""Yoda."" He's quirky, speaks with an accent, wears a sarong, and reads your palm...OF COURSE he's enlightened! He's from Bali! He's infused with magic! All the houses have no walls. It's really weird here! When the quirkiness of Bali runs thin, it's time to introduce Felipe (Javier Bardem), an affectionate grizzly bear of a man who kisses his son on the mouth and cries at the drop of a hat. He's not American! He's Brazilian! Passionate! That's what Liz needs! But after his profession of his love, Liz immediately pulls away and starts screaming at him, feeling suffocated. Really, Liz? It's his fault for falling in love and cramping your style? How dare he say it! He's supposed to be passionate -- but to a point, to some invisible marker that Liz draws in the air. Here, Liz comes off as bipolar, running hot and cold at the drop of a hat without rhyme or reason; she is angry at anyone who doesn't read your mind. At this point, the film suffers even more because it is unclear to the audience WHY he's in love with her. He professes to be madly in love with Liz, but it's a head-scratcher why because we do not see her as very lovable at all. She's a screeching banshee of a woman who doesn't seem to be aware of her own motivations, so the relationship itself seems forced, and, by this time in the film, it is too late to build this relationship up as The Relationship in the entire film (yet it is, to the detriment of the narrative; it wasted far too much time with David before introducing Felipe late in the game). She runs away, but one last minute trip to the all-knowing toothless guru, who tells her to open her heart, magically clicks in her head (despite people saying this throughout the film), and she runs back to Felipe and they live happily ever after. Instead of giving any of the foreign characters some real depth, the film paints them in broad stereotypical strokes.The film never recovers from its biggest malaise: Liz is not sympathetic or relatable. We The Audience watch her cry, look empty, wander, and we can imagine what that's like from drawing on our own lives, but we do not FEEL for her because she isn't even active in her own life. Throughout the film, she is passive (funny, considering all the traveling she decides to do), but in every scene she doesn't seem to help herself, and feels like it is life's duty to provide others who will help her out of her slump. Liz begins the film financially comfortable, with an enviable job, a nice husband, a gorgeous home, and loving friends and family -- it will take some good strong storytelling to convince the audience why she feels unsatisfied. But the director and writers rely too much on the audience just being able to GET IT so the film can skip off to the three countries for the pretty shots. There is no compelling scene that shows Liz and her husband's true unfixable disconnect. We're just supposed to accept there is one from Liz's tears and blank stares at the wall and move on. There's nothing at all that convinces the audience that this gilded cage is suffocating; if anything, we understand Liz as a woman who just needs a good therapist and some volunteer work around the corner (but no, the film seems to say...you can't volunteer at home; you must have a profound experience with poor people abroad). The shot at the end of her ex-husband with a baby and new wife, strolling happily down the street, is meant to show the audience that Liz was right all along, that they were never meant to be, but it feels false and tacked-on instead of true vindication. The problem is, most people in the audience don't have the luxury of taking a year off to vacation in three countries to find themselves, so if you are going to make a film about an unfulfilled woman who CAN do all of this (and a film with merchandise tie-ins that include BUDDHIST prayer beads), it  would be nice for the filmmakers to make the point that happiness doesn't merely lie in stamps in your passport; rather, it's a journey you can take at home. You can meet wonderful people at your corner coffee shop and develop meaningful friendships. You can volunteer at a local shelter and find purpose. If you stopped enjoying food, you can find new recipes or cuisines to try. Unfortunately, the film clearly pushes the idea that for Liz, her existing family and friends aren't enough; she feels an ashram or guru (both stereotyped in the film) is the secret of finding herself; and she even proclaims that the food in her current area doesn't do it for her anymore. The whole film reads like a commercial for the travel industry more than an illuminating lesson of a woman at a crossroads in her life that each audience member can apply to his or her own life. If you want to make a film about a woman who is empowered by dropping it all to find more meaning out of life (and more power to her for doing that), great; it'd just be a lot more effective sans the cultural appropriation (the East is so mystical and weird!) and commercialization. For example,  take the $36 Eat Pray Love Lancome lip glosses, one of the many official merchandise tie-ins). It's kind of incongruent to market a film about materialism not buying happiness by selling lipglosses.In short, the film is like one of those gimmicky Zen boxes you see by the registers at Borders: watered-down to non-existence and insulting.",2,"Selfish, Unsympathetic, Shallow",1290643200,"11 25, 2010",2010,14936,"['Let', 'preface', 'mentioning', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'ve"",

In work and play, I know how the world works, but I am always willing and eager to learn more. That said, EAT PRAY LOVE is a movie and adaptation you will either get or you don't. Either you enjoy it and appreciate it or you don't. And I am ok with that. Every movie is subjective to the viewer. With this film, it will either touch you deeply or disgust you. Let's start with touching.Not everyone is lucky enough to have experienced the pain Liz does (Julia Roberts). I say lucky because in order to grow, you must feel pain I believe. And while some people found Roberts' portrayal of Liz Gilbert trite and shallow, I found it deeply moving and an effort I could relate to. For two and a half hours, I was removed from my living room and moved along the journey of Liz through Julia Roberts. She WAS Liz and even as an actor, I think Julia Roberts was showing she is still learning about the world around her. I found her pain and sorrow and eventual growth very real. Call me what you wish, but no film needs to follow a standard formula to appeal to the masses. EAT PRAY LOVE is an interpretation of the artist and this film clicks on all cylinders.As for the disgusting part that some people label the entire film, I think perhaps they expect too much from movies and actors. To jettison the world around you as you sit in a movie theater or living room takes a talent many don't have. The message of this film and its characters is to let yourself go and create an open minded approach and view to the world around you and the world within you. Not everyone can do that and I am ok with that too. But call it what you will, EAT PRAY LOVE is an adoring look at one person's life among many. You will feel the energy and beauty of it or you won't. I applaud the filmmakers and actors for an escape that even men can, not should, appreciate. It's not just a chick flick, it's a snapshot of one person's life that is far from shallow.

1319792,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0033AGJ5Y,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","One quarter of this movie is excellent. The other three quarters is just barely acceptable.The story follows Liz Gilbert from her divorce in New York City, to Rome, to India, and then Bali. The film is pretty well evenly divided twenty five percent to each location. Supposedly, Liz eats in Rome, prays in India, and loves in Bali. I would guess that the book does a wonderful job making these three distinctions at each location. Sadly, the film bungles the division up very badly. Each theme is badly mixed in at each location. A key example from a trailer clip, so I'm not spoiling the film, Felipe is clearly coming on to Liz; they are both attracted to each other. He gives her a tour of a market, and then says they need to eat at the best restaurant in the city. Liz, says yes they do and where is that restaurant? Felipe responds, my house. Eating is a huge portion of the last segment. Oddly, the Rome segment, food had little to do with the motivation of that location (yes there was a horrible close up montage of Liz eating spaghetti, but that had so little to do with the story). The film does a good job with flashbacks, where Liz is reminded of something that happened in New York. Unfortunately, it was sometimes difficult to tell who was Stephen (her ex-husband) and David (her ex-boyfriend).The worst non-sequitur of the film, clearly something had been cut from the film. Liz and many friends make Thanksgiving dinner in Rome. The pack of friends has gotten large, an older woman (somebody's momma), a couple with a baby, the overweight bearded guy coupled with some other woman (but seemed to be headed toward Liz earlier in the film), the Swedish blonde and her Italian language teacher. Liz either makes a toast or does a voice over narration about how fabulous her friends are. How they are powerful people that show the importance of family. Seeing one of the men put their baby to sleep. She is just full of love and admiration for these people. Unfortunately everything leading up to that scene was about Liz more or less partying with some of these friends and being very alone. The toast came completely out of left field, and made absolutely no sense. The film is riddled with these problems.Julia Roberts is perfectly cast and delivers a marvelous performance. I believed completely that Julia had taken this journey; she lived the main character Liz. Javier Bardem (Vicky Christina Barcelona and No Country for Old Men) as Felipe, Liz's final love interest, is incredible. He is sexy Latin without being a caricature (like he was in Vicky Christina), his whole demeanor is attractive to males and females. Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) is the other standout performance. He plays a Texan in an Indian ashram. The best line of the film, ""Has anyone ever said that you look like James Taylor?"" There was a very long pause and then the question was repeated. Apparently this is something Jenkins gets in real life all the time. Frankly, the other performances were pretty much cardboard (save the lady assistant at Ketut Liyer house, she is hilarious). The worst was the blonde Swedish woman that spoke perfect English and Italian in Rome.The soundtrack is outstanding, Eddie Vedder wrote two gorgeous acoustic songs that fit so well in this film. It is worth staying for the credits just to hear his closing song. The range is sweet, from Fleetwood Mac to Sly And The Family Stone to Neil Young (two songs). The orchestra music is a whole other beast; it detracted horribly from the film. Opera or classical music is brought up to make the audience feel more touched by the action, the use backfired horribly for me, and it all just slipped into melodrama.This is a very long film; runtime is clocked at 133 minutes. The director could have cut out at least 30 minutes in the first two portions of the film, although they clearly deleted some critical story line component in the Rome sequence. The filming in Rome is very poor; the look and feel is of bad stock travel footage. India is marginally better. Early in that sequence the hackneyed images of crowded dirty India are repeated. Later at the ashram, the cinematography is much better. On the other hand, Bali is simply gorgeous, beautiful exotic images, with excellent camera work.The film is rated PG-13. The f bomb is thrown at least twice. There is a fairly extended scene of completely naked male behind, this is a full body shot and by millimeters didn't show any private parts. Sadly, this particular scene goes on a bit too long. And frankly, Liz laughing so hard at his naked body, she sees the full frontal nudity, is poorly done. Although the eye candy guy does blow off the laughing rather well. Everyone is fully clothed in the bedroom scenes, not even a hint of underwear.This is a review of the theatrical release of the film. The DVD is not yet released. I expect the transfer to DVD will be well done. It's hard to say what bonus features will be added. After over two hours of this, I probably would never watch the bonus features anyway.I really loved the last quarter of this film. My wife and I saw this together; it was a nice afternoon date film. Her comment was, the book was much better, the last quarter really was good, and the rest was not so good. I only say this to balance my male view of the film. My lower rating of this film is not because this is a romantic comedy or a chick flick; it is because the first three quarters lacked motivation. I actually happen to rather enjoy romantic comedies or what would be classified as chick flicks.",3,One Quarter Of A Movie,1282867200,"08 27, 2010",2010,5559,"['One', 'quarter', 'movie', 'excellent',

There are some very pretty images onscreen of beautiful people lounging and engaging in shallow, narcissistic, pseudo-spiritual preening and posing, some nice, crunchy, flowing, draping, tie-dyed, robes and scarves, and some heaping plates of pasta gorged down by people with perfect teeth. It's like looking at a spiritually pretentious, multi-culti American Express commercial for two and a half hours. The travelogue scenes are undermined, though, by inappropriate camera work. Director Ryan Murphy uses a shaky, handheld camera, spinning scenes, and extreme close-ups. His cinema-verite style is very out of place with this material.Other than Richard Jenkins' performance, ""Eat Pray Love"" has not one second of integrity. It wants to be about the nature of love, the mystery of life, and the search for the transcendent. The main stars and Ryan Murphy, the writer-director, show no evidence of any depth or insight on any of these questions. I pity the fool who takes this film on as a spiritual guide or love guru.I'm not sure if viewers were supposed to have as much contempt for the characters as I ended up having. Was I supposed to regard Elizabeth (Julia Roberts) as a passive, parasitic, narcissist, coward, and tramp who slept with anyone who was almost as good looking as she? She's coupled with three men in the movie, and flirts seriously with two more, and they are all pretty enough for a travel layout in Vanity Fair. None has any discernable personality. The only reason Elizabeth has for hooking up with these guys is that he and she are the two best looking characters onscreen at any given moment.Even though Elizabeth embarks on a life-changing world tour, and does one charitable deed, she comes across as passive. Others in the film have lives; Elizabeth stands on the sideline, watching. She lives through others. This is especially evident when her Indian friend, Tulsi, is forced into an arranged marriage at age 17.I've met Hindu women in their forties and fifties who could still cry real tears over that moment when they came home and found the red sari and were forced to start producing children for a strange man they didn't know and didn't much like. This film treats forced, child marriage as just another chance for stunning wardrobe changes and shots suitable for a National Geographic spread.The multi-culti ""It's a Small World"" approach is morally grotesque, especially in a film that wants to be about searching for the big truths. In terms of the structure of the film itself, showing Julia Roberts, no doubt the tallest person there, hanging out at an Indian wedding just makes the character into a dilettante, someone the viewer finds hard to like.In addition to being shallow, the script is at times incoherent. I had no idea what was going on in the first twenty minutes of the film. I didn't know - and I still don't - what Elizabeth does for a living, how she lost all her money, as the film tells us she does, or how she got the money back. She appears to give all her money to her layabout (but pretty) husband; why? Couldn't she get a better divorce lawyer?Then she's off to Italy to eat pasta and tease a sexually frustrated language tutor and annoy traditional Italian matrons who don't understand her lifestyle choice; where'd this woman who just lost everything get the cash to do that? Viola Davis is compelling, but I have no idea who her character was or what she was doing in the film, except as a racial token, which is sad. I kept thinking how much better of a film this would have been had someone with Davis' depth been a main character.James Franco pops up as one of Elizabeth's lovers, but his entire, tedious and uninteresting segment could have been deleted, and nothing would have been lost.Elizabeth has a Balinese guru named Ketut. No idea whether we are supposed to take Ketut seriously or not. He is a fortune teller who repeats the same tired spiel to each new client: ""You are a world traveler."" Mind, he's reading the palms of world travelers. He smiles without letup, which gets creepy.Had I not seen this film, I never would have known how bad an actor Javier Bardem can be when he has contempt for his project. As one of Elizabeth's boytoys, Bardem gives one of the single worst screen performances I've ever seen. He slums through the film with a phony, creepy smile on his face, the kind of smile that hides something. I was hoping that he might be a slasher; now that would have perked the film up.There are a couple of utterly phony scenes, one with an Aussie lad we could never believe is Bardem's son, one where Bardem invites Roberts to an island getaway, that are overcooked to scorching point - you can practically smell the phony emoting - and that cheapen the film beyond redemption. What was going on with the director? Did he not see what Bardem was doing?Richard Jenkins, as a soul-wrecked Texan seeking enlightenment, or at least the ability to sleep at night, is the one integral, worthy feature of the film. His character is real, and believable, so well-written I have to guess someone other than the main writer created him, and perfectly well acted.See a really brilliant film about a beautiful woman on an international quest for spiritual transcendence: Fred Zinnemann's 1959 ""The Nun's Story"" starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter Finch.",2,"Pretentious, Shallow, Travel Ad; Bardem esp.

Hartley,"[14, 21]","You know, any schlub who has been to at least two world's fairs and a rodeo could have saved the protagonist of this film a lot of time and trouble by quoting Buckaroo Banzai's favorite adage:Wherever you go, there you are.Unfortunately for the audience, it takes the globe-trotting heroine of Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir ""Eat Pray Love"" 133 minutes to reach that same conclusion (OK, so it took Tyrone Power 145 minutes in ""The Razor's Edge""...but who's counting?)Julia Roberts stars as Gilbert's avatar in the film, where she is briefly introduced to us as a (seemingly) happy, thirty-something NYC-based writer with a loving and supporting husband (Billy Crudup). I say ""briefly introduced"", because soon after a research trip to Bali, during the course of which a shaman (Hadi Subiyanto) foretells that she will lose all her money, but eventually return to study under him so that he may impart his great wisdom, Liz decides that she needs to bolt from the marriage (much to the puzzlement of husband and audience).While the ink is still drying on her divorce papers (at least in screen time), Liz tumbles headlong into a relationship with a hunky young off-off Broadway stage actor (James Franco). The lust, however, soon turns to wanderlust, and Liz decides that maybe what she really needs is to take a year off from...everything. So, leaving her new relationship somewhere in the neutral zone, she embarks on a three-pronged attack in order to ""find herself"", first to Italy (eat), then India (pray) and then Bali (love...oops, is that a spoiler?)So what does she learn? Want the speed-dating version? Here goes! In Italy, they have like, killer pasta and pizza. Awesome! And the gelato...it's to die for! Oh...and Italians live in the moment, and they talk with their hands...just like the people on Jersey Shore! And when Liz decides to treat her new Italian friends to an all-American style home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings, one of the Italians, being unfamiliar with our ways and customs, forgets to defrost the bird. But, not to worry-Liz puts it in the oven, they all go to bed, and then, they have turkey for breakfast. How whimsical! Next stop: India, where Liz learns piety by scrubbing floors at an ashram. Oh, and gurus live in the moment. Then, it's back to Bali, where she goes back to the shaman who started the whole thing (he lives in the moment). Then, she meets a sexy Brazilian! (Javier Bardem).Roberts is suitably radiant, flashes her million dollar smile and delivers her patented hearty guffaws right on cue, but she oddly seems to spend a good portion of this (very long) film as an observer of her character's journey, rather than an active participant. Consequently, it's hard for us to really care about what happens to our leading lady; and that is a fatal flaw. The always wonderful Richard Jenkins (as another American at the ashram) briefly perks up the middle third. But as soon as his character disappears, so does the spirit and energy he brings to the film. The locales are gorgeous, and there's plenty of food porn for the gastronomiques, but that doesn't candy-coat Robert's phoned-in performance and the flat, soap opera-ish dialog (co-written by Murphy and Jennifer Salt). It's like randomly surfing between Lifetime, The Food Network and The Travel Channel.I have not read the source book, nor frankly am I ever likely to. The Pottery Barn angst on display here is tough to sympathize with in these hard economic times (how many of us can afford the luxury of ""taking a year off"" to navel-gaze?), and seems bent on perpetrating the Ugly American meme. In fact, I thought that the depictions of the ""colorful locals"" encountered by the protagonist on her whistle stops bordered on the kind of colonial stereotyping I assumed Hollywood had abandoned ages ago.

1319799,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B0033AGJ5Y,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[6, 9]","Whether or not ""Eat, Pray, Love"" adequately represents the bestselling memoir of the same name (Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia) by author Liz Gilbert or not doesn't really matter.  Is it the fault of the filmmaker or the writer when the piece attempts to hit the side-of-the-barn of greater meaning and just barely skims the surface?""Eat, Pray, Love: the Phenomenon"" recounts the year long journey of writer Liz Gilbert as she recovers from a messy divorce and an unfulfilling affair/relationship with a very 21st century self-absorbed pragmatism that appeals to both aging flower children and their ""look-inward"" progeny.  By combining worldly angst with the spiritual fascination of Eastern religions made fashionable by the Beatles in the 60s, Gilbert attempts to fill many different types of holes in the spirit of self-development simultaneously.  Although she succeeds somewhat in her book, director Ryan Murphy's film stalls when it fails to define itself within a particular genre.  Not that this ambiguity alone causes the film to fail--it ambles along prettily enough but unfortunately without enough thrust to make it stand out as a must-see event.Murphy/Gilbert's audience contains the wide subset of Oprah Winfrey watchers--those of the ""live your dream"" mantra that desire nothing more than to be able to make a lucrative career out of facilitating something they love.  Gilbert surely fits the bill here: her publisher financed her journey of discovery to three foreign countries where she could eat, pray and love her way to bigger pay check.Just what Gilbert is fleeing is up for grabs.  Her marriage to Billy Crudup doesn't work and neither does her affair with the young hottie actor (James Delicious Franco)--how sad is that? Neither of these man ask her to sacrifice her livelihood for them--Crudup is depicted as financially dependent on her and Franco blows her off emotionally when he realizes she is looking for him to save her.  As she wanders through the streets of Rome on the first leg of her trek, the audience senses her confusion--is the melancholy of her past preventing her from enjoying the pleasurable sensations of the present and the future?The juxtaposition of the ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" theme while in Italy--mucho plated food porn, the hum of Vespas and so many leather-clad Italians looking chic in skinny jeans--with the austere loneliness of the Augusteum in Rome to depict the change that the world and time has on one's inner identity marries the desire to splurge with a sad introspection that tries too hard--hinting at depression but not quite spelling it out.  Perhaps knowing that Gilbert actually battled depression with medication may help the audience better understand and relate to the confused emotional shifts through which the main character traverses.Murphy avoids this descent within the modern mindset for pharmacopia focusing instead for more than half of the film on Gilbert's sojourn at the Indian ashram.  Is he commenting on the fact that the status of being a spiritual seeker is just part of a look at the ersatz intelligentsia--those who emote often and within the boundaries of copious self-development/how-to realms where just living a good life with great companions isn't quite en vogue anymore?  Is he telling us that enlightenment has become the newest and trendiest goal?  In this sense, is it any wonder that the most predominant self-help guru of our time (Oprah Winfrey) has taken Gilbert under her lofty wings and is promoting not only the author's bestselling memoir but also the film and its star, Julia Roberts?  Is he helping to build an ""Eat, Pray, Love"" franchise that advocates taking a long break from reality while attempting to peel away the layers that hide the inner self?Who knows?Gilbert's activities at the ashram are never really defined--her inner journey becomes trite and cutesy rather real and mind-boggling.  Whatever conclusion she reaches doesn't really reach the viewer--the audience waits for the ""love"" leg of the triangle because that is how a film as attractive as this with an attractive main character should end--with love.All this would be very cool if the film defined itself in more universal terms.  As a travelogue, the cinematography lovingly captures the Eternal City, the riotous humanity of Mumbai and the lush jungles of Bali with a glossy expertise that would do both National Geographic and Travel & Leisure proud.  As a romantic fantasy--girl is married to wrong guy, has affair with younger actor and than finds the hunkiest Brazilian ex-pat this side of Ipanema even after gorging herself with indulgent amounts of pizza, pasta and gelato--'EPL' might work.  However, the screenplay makes the mistake of dictating a New Age panacea for the ennui of modern life.  Whereas the average viewer expects a visual nirvana of charming faraway places, he/she is force-fed the not-so-palatable pill of Liz's self-absorption.  The result confuses; the storyline seems over-edited.  The overall messages gleaned from the experiences in the three places don't really flow with any real meaning because even though we are treated to some voiceover, we are not privy to the progression (if any) of Liz's without-rhyme or reason thought as we are in her equally poorly formatted book.  The bulk of the film's time is spent focusing on the routine of the ashram in Ganeshpuri, India where Liz fumbles through meditation, her early morning devotionals and some textbook feminism regarding the woman-unfriendly aspects of marriage.  Why she is there and what she hopes to gain other than to meet the guru of her ex-boyfriend is never fully mapped out.  She snaps with frustration at the gruff Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) also playing pilgrim at the hermitage and he speaks in zen to get her to the point where she can get between the sheets with Javier in an Indonesian hut.  Huh?  The amalgamation of the material world with that of the spiritual and the sensual covers too much ground in too little time while the formulaic ending of girl riding the waves with her new man trivializes the more somber issues introduced but never fully developed or rectified in the first two segments of the trek.As ""Eat, Pray, Love"" can't figure out just exactly what its point is, the actors can't figure out how to play it. Choreographed with MTV-ish segments of Julia as Liz in different parts of the world, the audience strives to participate but cannot--Liz's pain is explained, but it is too nebulous--too deep and indulgent to fully understand.  All Julia Roberts can do is alternatively look sad or happy.Bottom line?  Watching Julia Roberts travel to three different world venues as she ponders the big question of life's meaning doesn't quite work in this film adaptation of Liz Gilbert's bestselling book ""Eat, Pray, Love.""  A better venue for this soul trek would have been a National Geographic series where the points of scenery and dogma could have been better exemplified in documentary format.  ThinkJapan (4 tape set) [VHS] hosted by Jane Seymour.  More clearly introduced information would have fleshed out the personal stuff giving the audience more background and less muddle.

I missed the very beginning, so I didn't even know the name of the movie until I searched for it on the internet.  I had never read the book, and I had never heard of the movie either.  I think Julia Roberts is a great actress, and have loved everything I've seen her in.  But, I guess this movie never got much attention, or maybe the name wasn't something that attracted movie goers to see it.  I can honestly say it was a wonderful heartfelt movie about a woman, who after a bad time in her life, went on a journey to find inner peace.  The countries she visited had some beautiful scenery and lots of adventure, and there were so many wonderful surprises in store for her during her journey.

1319804,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0033AGJ5Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 5]","Like anyone who has the slightest interest in seeing this 2010 film, I was seduced by the Travel Channel images in the trailer and the sight of a radiant Julia Roberts in her first full-fledged star vehicle since 2003'sMona Lisa Smile. She appears in almost every frame of this 133-minute emotional travelogue, and the introspective story based on Elizabeth Gilbert's 2006 memoir,Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia, needs someone of Roberts' star wattage to give it a recognizable pulse. The challenge faced by director/writer Ryan Murphy (Glee) and his co-screenwriter, former actress Jennifer Salt, is how to make something dramatic out of what is essentially an inward quest toward self-fulfillment without turning the whole venture into a mire of clich&eacute;s that passes for dramatic structure. They don't actually succeed, but somehow Roberts' goodwill and infectious manner, missing for most of the decade, overcome much of this obstacle in her sympathetic portrayal of Gilbert.After a brief preface in Bali where Gilbert interviews a prophetic medicine man who forecasts her love life, the plot begins in earnest with Gilbert's emotional meltdown back in New York six months later. Liz (as the character is called in the movie) divorces her flaky husband Stephen who has upended their marriage with plans to go back to school. She rebounds in a passionate affair with David, a younger actor, but recognizes how she again submerges her own identity in the relationship. In order to halt this recurring pattern and find enlightenment toward her true self, Liz decides to take a trip around the world with three destinations in mind - Italy where she eats, India where she prays, and Bali where she falls in love. Her first stop is Rome, where a young Italian tutor teaches her the art of doing nothing. With the help of her new Swedish best friend, this means accepting the ten extra pounds on her frame due to a steady diet of pasta and pizza. Liz then moves on to an Indian ashram where she receives essential spiritual guidance from a tough-talking Texan named Richard.She finally comes back to Bali to reunite with the medicine man and then accidentally meets Felipe, a recently divorced Brazilian who may or may not turn out to be her soul mate. Because Murphy and Salt appear intent on remaining faithful to the book, they attempt to cover too much for a feature-length film. Secondary characters become trivialized, and situations become rushed and pat. Take, for example, Liz's relationship with a healer named Wayan in Bali. So moved is Liz by Wayan's plight, she emails all her previous travel acquaintances to send money in order to buy Wayan and her young daughter a house. Yet, we get very little sense of any meaningful friendship between the characters. That's because the movie fails to capture the deep emptiness of Liz's soul that would drive her to make this life-altering journey. This is what the author did better in the source book, i.e., show the underbelly of Liz's despair through insightful comments and some pithy prose. As the movie stands, it's left to Roberts to flesh out the character's emotions without sounding like a whining, privileged woman of means. It's no small feat.When not providing the sometimes smug narration, Roberts is luminous but not the film's only standout. Even though his character has to provide the hoariest bromides, Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) manages to bring fiery heart and gravitas to the Texan who forces Liz to take a hard look at herself. As Felipe, Javier Bardem (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) has to play the feminist ideal of the modern man and consequently comes across almost too evolved to be honestly compelling. Less impactful turns are provided by Billy Crudup as Stephen (though his scene at Liz's divorce lawyer's office provides a much-needed edge to the story), James Franco rather morose as David, and Viola Davis (Doubt) as wisecracking best friend and editor Delia (similar to the role she played inNights in Rodanthe). Robert Richardson provides the rich cinematography that captures the ripeness of each exotic location down to the luscious pasta dishes in Rome. In fact, aficionados of both the Food Network and the Travel Channel will likely rejoice at the visual pleasures in this film. The rest of us will have to make do with Julia in her prime.",3,"Julia Not Only Eats, Prays and Loves But Also Cries, Meanders and Resonates",1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,4390,"['anyone', 'who', 'slightest', 'interest', 'seeing', '2010', 'film', 'was', 'seduced', 'Travel', 'Channel', 'trailer', 'sight', 'radiant', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'first', 'full-fledged', 'star', 'vehicle', ""2003'sMona"", 'Lisa', 'Smile', 'almost', 'frame', '133-minute', 'emotional', 'travelogue', 'introspective', 'story', 'based', 'Elizabeth', 'Gilbert', '2006', 'memoir', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'One', 'Woman', 'Search', 'Everything', 'Across', 'Italy', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'someone', 'Roberts', 'star', 'wattage', 'give', 'recognizable', 'pulse', 'challenge', 'faced', 'director/writer', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'Glee', 'co-screenwriter', 'former', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Salt', 'how', 'make', 'something', 'dramatic', 'what', 'essentially', 'inward', 'quest', 'self-fulfillment', 'turning', 'whole', 'venture', 'mire', 'clich', 'eacute', 'dramatic', 'structure', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'succeed', 'somehow', 'Roberts', 'goodwill', 'infectious', 'manner', 'missing', 'most', 'decade', 'overcome', 'much', 'obstacle', 'sympathetic', 'portrayal', 'Gilbert.After', 'brief', 'preface', 'Bali', 'where', 'Gilbert', 'prophetic', 'medicine', 'man', 'who', 'love', 'life', 'plot', 'earnest', 'Gilbert', 'emotional', 'meltdown', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'Liz', 'character', 'called', 'movie', 'flaky', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'who', 'upended', 'marriage', 'plans', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'passionate', 'affair', 'David', 'younger', 'actor', 'how', 'again', 'own', 'identity', 'relationship', 'order', 'halt', 'recurring', 'pattern', 'find', 'enlightenment', 'true', 'self', 'Liz', 'take', 'trip', 'world', 'three', 'destinations', 'mind', 'Italy', 'where', 'India', 'where', 'Bali', 'where', 'love', 'first', 'stop', 'Rome', 'where', 'young', 'Italian', 'tutor', 'art', 'doing', 'nothing', 'help', 'new', 'Swedish', 'best', 'friend', 'accepting', 'ten', 'extra', 'pounds', 'frame', 'due', 'steady', 'diet', 'pasta', 'pizza', 'Liz', 'then', 'Indian', 'ashram', 'where', 'essential', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'tough-talking', 'Texan', 'named', 'Richard.She', 'finally', 'back', 'Bali', 'reunite', 'medicine', 'man', 'then', 'accidentally', 'Felipe', 'recently', 'divorced', 'Brazilian', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'soul', 'mate', 'Murphy', 'Salt', 'appear', 'intent', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'book', 'attempt', 'cover', 'too', 'much', 'feature-length', 'film', 'Secondary', 'characters', 'become', 'trivialized', 'situations', 'become', 'rushed', 'pat', 'Take', 'example', 'Liz', 'relationship', 'healer', 'named', 'Wayan', 'Bali', 'So', 'moved', 'Liz', 'Wayan', 'plight', 'previous', 'travel', 'acquaintances', 'send', 'money', 'order', 'buy', 'Wayan', 'young', 'daughter', 'house', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'meaningful', 'friendship', 'characters', 'movie', 'capture', 'deep', 'emptiness', 'Liz', 'soul', 'would', 'drive', 'make', 'life-altering', 'journey', 'what', 'author', 'did', 'better', 'source', 'book', 'i.e.', 'show', 'underbelly', 'Liz', 'despair', 'insightful', 'comments', 'pithy', 'prose', 'movie', 'left', 'Roberts', 'flesh', 'out', 'character', 'emotions', 'sounding', 'whining', 'privileged', 'woman', 'means', 'small', 'feat.When', 'not', 'providing', 'sometimes', 'smug', 'narration', 'Roberts', 'luminous', 'not', 'film', 'only', 'standout', 'Even', 'character', 'provide', 'hoariest', 'bromides', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Visitor', 'bring', 'fiery', 'heart', 'gravitas', 'Texan', 'who', 'Liz', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'Felipe', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Vicky', 'Cristina', 'Barcelona', 'play', 'feminist', 'ideal', 'modern', 'man', 'consequently', 'almost', 'too', 'evolved', 'be', 'honestly', 'compelling', 'Less', 'impactful', 'turns', 'are', 'provided', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Stephen', 'scene', 'Liz', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'office', 'much-needed', 'edge', 'story', 'James', 'Franco', 'rather', 'morose', 'David', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Doubt', 'wisecracking', 'best', 'friend', 'editor', 'Delia', 'similar', 'role', 'played', 'inNights', 'Rodanthe', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'ripeness', 'exotic', 'location', 'down', 'luscious', 'pasta', 'dishes', 'Rome', 'fact', 'aficionados', 'Food', 'Network', 'Travel', 'Channel', 'will', 'likely', 'rejoice', 'visual', 'pleasures', 'film', 'rest', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'do', 'Julia', 'prime']",Eat Pray Love
1319805,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0033AGJ5Y,Elisabeth,"[3, 6]","This is a movie about a woman (played by Julia Roberts) who feels stuck in a rut.  She copes with her rut by filing for divorce and traveling abroad for a year with the hopes of finding her passion for life again.  The title, ""Eat, Pray, Love"" comes from her rekindling her lust for food in Italy, learning how to meditate in India, and learning how to accept and give love in Bali.I had mixed feelings about the main character.  On the one hand, she seemed rather flaky to just end her marriage without trying to make it work first.  But on the other hand, if the passion to make it work  just  wasn't there  (and probably never was), then  it's probably in her husband's best interest to set him free to find someone just as passionate about him as he is about her.I also had  a problem with  the main character  using the word ""love"" to describe how she felt towards her ex, her rebound guy, and the man she meets in Bali.  Because she's able to quickly walk away from all 3 without warning, it made me question  how meaningful that word was for her .I thought the countries she visited were depicted realistically as well as beautifully.  For example, in Italy, she stays in a run-down place with no bath water, but also walks  along  beautiful cobblestone streets.  In India, she's  pestered by  flies, but also surrounded by lush color.As someone who's traveled a lot,  I could relate with having to take the  ugly with the beautiful.This movie ends on a feel-good note, leaving you wanting to take more risks in life.

Maze Sallas ""The Author's Mentor""","[2, 4]","I give this movie 2 and 1/2 stars, but not quite 3 for the reasons stated below.Liz's (lead character) journey to find God and herself falls short and is impossible to identify with. Her NYC life isn't detailed enough for us to believe she just ""up and left"" for Italy, India and Bali. The time spent in Italy was boring and too long, the time spent in India shorter on film, but too long in meaningless moments that the writers hoped we would find deep and moving.The movie is pulled out of the muck when she reaches Bali and meets Felipe, another divorced person healing from a broken heart. Major difference -- Felipe is a real person we can love, cuddle, and pray for. He loves his grown son and cries with joy when he sees him and with grief when they part.

Nothing happened--no adventure, no enlightenment, no interesting conversations, no revelations, no self-discovery (or discovery of anything else, for that matter).Second, this movie was trite.  Reminiscent of the ego tripping of the 1960's, it added nothing new to any debate about anything--humanity, nature, individualism, all of these were possible topics.  The movie touched on none of them.Third, this movie was improbable.  Liz wakes up one morning, deciding (for no ascertainable reason) to dump her husband and go on a year-long odyssey to discover something, or recover something, or whatever.  She apparently has the funds to do this, which should come as a surprise to everyone (including herself) after her divorce.  We certainly never see her worried about money or whether her mail will catch up with her, or how to pay her income taxes or credit card bills.  In Italy, she eats pasta and moans about an increasing weight we certainly never see.  In India, she stays on an ashram that seems to cater to spiritual tourists, but we never see her eating or sick.  She never even gets dirty.  In Bali, she takes on a huge commitment to transcribe ancient Balinese wisdom for a wise man, but abandons this endeavor without warning or excuse to spend three weeks (!) in bed with a handsome and very unusual Brazilian man.  (When did any of you ever meet a gorgeous Brazilian man who was willing to be a househusband?)Fourth, this movie represented selfishness and hypocrisy at extraordinary levels.  She dumps her husband with no warning, no counseling, nothing.  She goes where she wants and tramples upon whomever she wishes to crush.  Given that she is on a mission of self-indulgence, it is shocking that she works to persuade a 17 year old Indian woman to marry the man her family has chosen for her.  Why isn't this girl entitled to the same freedom that Liz feels is her own right?  She does one thing that might be considered to be outside the solipsistic world she has created:  she writes to her friends to ask them to donate money to a Balinese healer who desperately needs a house.  But even that is staggeringly self-centered:  she bases her request to them on the premise that, if she were in New York, her friends would be throwing a very expensive birthday party for her, to which they would bring expensive bottles of wine as gifts.

Unfortunately, this was the movie I most wanted to see when it came out on DVD.

Never being happy or finding her hearts content. Common story for just about EVERYBODY I KNOW. How they went about resolving her dilemma was just not that interesting. Her trip to Italy was relatively uneventful and the lesson to gain from it was to eat what you want and buy bigger pants. Basically, we got that from the watching previews. Then in India, she didn't find anything beyond that either.I was hoping for her to find some degree of benefit from each location, putting it all together in the end to become a whole, happy person. None of this actually happened.The last trek to Bali was when it got interesting and is the ONLY reason I give this movie three stars. The adventure and love story there was filled with interesting characters that finally made the movie more interesting than watching paint dry. Javier Bardem really brought something into the movie that simply didn't exist before. He played a great character and his acting was done very well. I liked this entire segment.

1319815,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0033AGJ5Y,Grady Harp,"[2, 4]","There are many mixed reactions to both the popular book EAT LOVE PRAY by Elizabeth Gilbert and the cinematic transcription by Jennifer Salt and director Ryan Murphy - from adoration to loathing. And exploring the reasons for this spectrum probably would result in a hint as to how far in life's journey each responder has gone.  The general theme of the fallout from sustaining a broken heart and being the perpetrator of breaking a heart makes for a thoughtful discussion on where we are in our ability to form lasting relationships today. The movie may be awash in color and overwhelm the viewer with National Geographic-like splendors of the world, but at the fore of the film is a little tale that deserves telling - or at least thinking about.Writer Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) sees what is lacking in her early marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup) and realizes as a couple they have grown apart.  She tells Stephen quite frankly that the marriage is over - leaving a broken heart in Stephen.  Liz's editor Delia (Viola Davis) supports Liz's sense of being lost and encourages her to follow her instincts and set out to see the world and in the process to find herself.  After a ricochet romance with young actor David Piccolo (James Franco) who is a free spirit and introduces Liz to meditation, Liz gathers her courage and sets off to see the world.  She visits Bali, meets healer Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto), who encourages her to deal with her inner self and follow her heart.  Liz is off to Rome where she discovers the secret of simply relaxing to enjoy being alive - while she consumes plentiful Italian cooking! - and engages an Italian language teacher Giovanni (Luca Argentero) and a mutual friend Sofi (Tuva Novotny) and in time absorbs the sense of family and unconditional love and the beauty and gestural language of Italy.  She then travels to India where she joins an ashram to concentrate on meditation and makes friends with a young girl Tulsi (Rushita Singh) who is facing a forced marriage (Liz offers her advice that marriage is what you make it), and a Texan Richard (Richard Jenkins, offering the strongest performance in the film) who ultimately shares his sad past of broken hearts with Liz as they bond. Liz then is off to Bali to see Ketut again and discovers Felipe (Javier Bardem) who is likewise distancing himself from a ruined marriage but retains a close love for his children.  It is this final coming together of two souls with similar needs who form the ending of the story.Yes, the story tugs at the heartstrings at bit heavily but perhaps being a little more vulnerable to the ideas about which this book/film speak is what we all need more than chat room cold distancing.  The cinematography by Robert Richardson is lushly colorful and the original music score by Dario Marianelli enhances each step of the film's journey.  The cast is well chosen, even in the small roles (one would expect only the best from the all star cast assembled), and the direction keeps the at times confusing back and forth process of storytelling fluid.  Maybe it is the approaching season that makes this film feel warm, but that is really OK.

Unfortunately, I had to shake my head at this film, after forcing myself not to walk out mid-way.Perhaps I should have read the book first, and saved myself the trouble of actually seeing the film.First off, the good points--the photography in the various locales (Bali, Italy, and India) was stunning.  The vibrancy of the photography was brilliant, and to say they were breathtaking would be an understatement.  The story had potential, so I believed, but I was vastly disappointed.  Overall, it drew away from the glamor emitted from the great photography.Roberts played her role with the same skill she has demonstrated in her other films, reaching to envelop the character with an all-encompassing grace.  Her  male co-stars (Billy Crudup and  James Franco) provided perfect foils to her acting. It was the story line that was lacking.Centered around her divorce, I understand that this is  a difficult medium for anyone to reach in their lifetime.  Liz Gilbert's journey from her divorce to her self-realization was just a little too much to handle, filled with (what I interpreted) as self-absorption before she reached self-realization.  My belief has always been ""When times get tough, aren't you supposed to pull up your pants and tackle life head-on.  Running away never solves anything.""  That is precisely what the leading lady did when she encountered trying times.Goodness, wouldn't we all love to go through a trying time in our lives, and manage to jet off to some exotic locale (for a year!)  to get away from it all?

How can a journey of self-discovery make an interesting film, even if it is set in three of the most amazing places on the planet?Somehow it works seamlessly.  Eat Pray Love is a gorgeous film. It's funny and poignant and mesmerizing and moving, and it's restored my faith in movies. The filmmakers took a few liberties with Gilbert's book in the interest of pacing and story and the changes made it better.Casting Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert was brilliant. Though we never forget we're watching Julia Roberts, in much the same way Bette Davis and Joan Crawford dominated their roles, she manages to be endearing and believable as she flounders in the wreckage of her life and tries to figure out what's next.  The amazing thing is that the effort behind her progress from depression to joy never shows.  It's demonstrated in subtle ways--roars of laughter at a still-frozen Thanksgiving turkey, pangs of memory and release of pain evoked by a wedding, mischievous glee at giving up her ""I'm in silence"" badge at the ashram. Julia Roberts' Elizabeth Gilbert is likeable and charming and her internal journey is wonderful to watch.I liked the book, Eat Pray Love for the travel and the characters, but thought the self-discovery was a 'meh'--yet another spoiled baby-boomer dissatisfied with a life far better than that of 99.9% of the rest of the world who spent 400 pages and a year in the most amazing places on earth crying, ""Me me me"". I didn't like Elizabeth Gilbert very much and didn't totally buy a lot of the internal story, though I lapped up the tales of her experiences and the people she met on her travels.  Thanks to a really fine screenplay, we see the point to Eat Pray Love in a way that was sometime obscured in the book.  Thanks to a really fine cast, the supporting characters are just that, from Billy Crudup as Gilbert's hurt and bewildered ex-husband, James Franco as the actor who introduces Gilbert to meditation and Viola Davis as the best friend and sounding board.  Gilbert's circle of people in each of the three places she visits are pitch-perfect and never succumb to stereotype.

1319837,A10OSAEVTA4FKY,B0033AGJ5Y,John A. Hart,"[8, 16]","There are two types of people who watch this movie: those who get it, and those who don't.  Those who don't may learn to appreciate it but it will never become a part of their souls.  If movies ever define what a person is going through in life, then this is one of those movies.Based on the memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert, it follows Gilbert (played wonderfully by Julia Roberts) in her attempt to find herself after her divorce and a failed romance.  She decides to do this by spending the year in Italy (""eat""), India (""pray""), and Bali (""love"").  In each of these regions of the world she rediscovers a part of her that she had lost over the years: in Italy she discovers not just an appetite for food but for life in general; in India she finds her spiritual center while in Bali she learns that she can love again.This is a simplistic description of the movie, but to go into more detail would simply take too much space.  Chances are if you are female over the age of 40 you may understand where Liz is coming from and learn something from her experience.  Most men might not get it -- a neighbor of mine who saw was utterly clueless about the subtext; I myself did see some of my own journey through life in what Liz went through and ended up seeing the movie three times in the theater (my wife saw it six times).  If you are hardcore in your religious beliefs you may have a problem with her seeking spirituality in a non-Christian/Western setting (in fact, the Vatican itself condemned the movie saying Liz should have stopped eating while in Rome and visited one of the many churches in the Eternal City for spiritual guidance rather than go to India).  But that's the whole point of the movie: Liz needed to find what worked for her, and each part of the film represents a step in that discovery.  Could she have gone into the churches?  Perhaps, but at that point she wasn't ready to find that part of her soul and she didn't need the church to tell her what she HAD to do which, frankly, she got tired of doing throughout much of her life.Julia Roberts' performance is excellent, and I will be sorely disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar nomination next year for it.  It easily surpasses her work in ""Erin Brockavich"".  The cinematography is excellent, the musical score is uplifting (and it's a shame that only one song from the original score is on the soundtrack album), and the supporting cast is so well that several should be up for their own Oscar noms.  If you're especially interesed in cinematography and acting, pay attention to the scene between Liz and Richard from Texas that takes place on the roof of their ashram in India -- that's all one take without edits.This isn't a movie to watch.  This is a movie to experience.  This is a movie that wants you to feel something.  I know my wife and I did.

Rooney,"[7, 11]","In ""Eat Pray Love"" you are going to see a lot of Julia Roberts as Liz exhibiting every possible facial expression for the doting camera that couldn't seem to get enough close-ups of her. This is a long movie which seems even longer than it is. We are going on a quest with Liz to Rome, to an ashram in India, and to Bali. I think she's looking for the meaning of her life, although I'm not quite sure because the movie seems to be sending out a lot of mixed messages.Liz wakes up to find her marriage is a failure, and I never do quite figure out what's wrong with it. Do people mumble in movies these days, is the sound track turned down too low, or am I going deaf? Then she falls in love (maybe) with an aspiring actor, but that fizzles out so she goes searching the world for sustenance, revelation, and romance.In Rome she meets a passel of friends, but mainly she seems to be pigging out on the delicious Italian food. I have never seen Italian food so attractively and lovingly photographed. Of the three locations, Rome is conveyed more thoroughly and evocatively than the other stops.When she gets to the ashram in India, she finds that the lady guru is off in New York so she has to learn meditation from others. We really see only the ashram and don't see much of India. At the ashram she meets Richard, a man who really is in bad mental shape (played excellently by Richard Jenkins).Did you ever get one of those fortune cookies at the end of a Chinese dinner which contains the blandest, most generic piece of advice you could find, advice that can fit anyone and doesn't offend anyone? That's the way I feel about this movie. Liz keeps meeting people including a medicine man in Bali who come up with handy aphorisms, truisms, palliatives, and nostrums which seem inane and goofy. She gets a lot of counsel and meets happy couples, but this chick has to keep looking, searching, discovering, looking...Borrowing a line from the movie: unless you buy a lottery ticket, you can't win the lottery of life. Everywhere Liz seems to be having epiphanies and gaining insights. Some people in the theater walked out in India and never did get to Bali where she met Mr. Right. Don't ask me why he was the right guy. He badly needed a shave, was a sensitive guy, but so were the other two in her life. Is it a feel-good movie? Hard to say. She's a confused gal who left me in the dark, hoping the Bali section wouldn't be too draggy.",3,"A Long, Long Movie with a Fortune Cookie",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,2437,"['Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'lot', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Liz', 'exhibiting', 'possible', 'facial', 'expression', 'doting', 'camera', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'enough', 'close-ups', 'long', 'movie', 'even', 'longer', 'are', 'going', 'quest', 'Liz', 'Rome', 'ashram', 'India', 'Bali', 'think', 'looking', 'meaning', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'movie', 'be', 'sending', 'out', 'lot', 'mixed', 'messages.Liz', 'up', 'find', 'marriage', 'failure', 'never', 'do', 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'Do', 'people', 'mumble', 'movies', 'days', 'sound', 'track', 'turned', 'down', 'too', 'low', 'am', 'going', 'deaf', 'Then', 'love', 'maybe', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'out', 'so', 'searching', 'world', 'sustenance', 'revelation', 'romance.In', 'Rome', 'passel', 'friends', 'mainly', 'be', 'pigging', 'out', 'delicious', 'Italian', 'food', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Italian', 'food', 'so', 'attractively', 'lovingly', 'photographed', 'three', 'locations', 'Rome', 'conveyed', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'evocatively', 'other', 'stops.When', 'ashram', 'India', 'lady', 'guru', 'off', 'New', 'York', 'learn', 'meditation', 'others', 'really', 'see', 'only', 'ashram', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'India', 'ashram', 'Richard', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'bad', 'mental', 'shape', 'played', 'excellently', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', '.Did', 'ever', 'get', 'one', 'fortune', 'cookies', 'end', 'Chinese', 'dinner', 'blandest', 'most', 'generic', 'piece', 'advice', 'could', 'find', 'advice', 'can', 'fit', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'way', 'feel', 'movie', 'Liz', 'meeting', 'people', 'including', 'medicine', 'man', 'Bali', 'who', 'come', 'up', 'handy', 'aphorisms', 'truisms', 'palliatives', 'nostrums', 'seem', 'inane', 'goofy', 'lot', 'counsel', 'meets', 'happy', 'couples', 'chick', 'keep', 'looking', 'searching', 'discovering', 'looking', 'Borrowing', 'line', 'movie', 'buy', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'lottery', 'life', 'Everywhere', 'Liz', 'be', 'having', 'epiphanies', 'gaining', 'insights', 'people', 'theater', 'walked', 'out', 'India', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'Bali', 'where', 'met', 'Mr', 'Right', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'right', 'guy', 'badly', 'needed', 'shave', 'was', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'so', 'were', 'other', 'two', 'life', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'Hard', 'say', 'confused', 'gal', 'who', 'left', 'dark', 'hoping', 'Bali', 'section', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'draggy']",Eat Pray Love

1319843,A123TO6OM5CG9T,B0033AGJ5Y,Judith T. Giles,"[4, 7]","I read the book when it came out, and just watched the movie. I enjoyed it. The very first words spoken by the lead character, Julia Roberts, are about a friend of hers who was called upon, as a psychologist, to aid Cambodian refugees in dealing with their feelings about the many trials they have gone through. Surprisingly, it seemed, they mostly wanted to discuss their men/women relationship issues. From there the story proceeds about her quest to sort out her relationship issues, mostly by developing a relationship with herself, something that she never really noticed was underdevoloped, mostly because since 15 yrs. of age she had either been super involved in maintaining a relationship with a man, or ending one so she could start anew with another.There are films that deal with weighty issues. This is one about a woman who wants to redirect her life, so that she doesn't define it so much by other people and external trappings. She will not become a Saint. I don't think she wants to be one anyway. She won't change the world (but she does give a woman some money toward the building of a house she needs). Because of these things, I found the movie to be one that I think many people can relate to. If she had made incredible changes in many, many lives, she would be a great person, for sure, but not someone that so many can relate with - someone whose identity invariably become lost once in a relationship with someone else.She visits some exotic locations. I would have enjoyed seeing some more scenic shots. I thought the tempo of the movie was great. Some might think it slow, but it seems European with its pace, and since the film is about her travels - it seemed fitting.Some of the spoken parts from Julia (Elizabeth) are word for word from the book. The way the author arranged her words is quite amazing, and worth reading or hearing spoken. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very talented author.

1319845,AES7RYBQDI2T2,B0033AGJ5Y,Kari Murphy,"[0, 1]","I enjoyed this movie, but felt the screenplay was much too long...Julia Roberts exhibits her talented magic, as Liz Gilbert, a journalist who is spiritually and emotionally bereft. Roberts does a great job with capturing a confused, control freak, who is uncertain, generous in spirit, affable and vulnerable. Emerging from an ill matched marriage, to dating a more spiritually enlightened boy toy....Liz recognizes there is more to life and something very wrong with the men she chooses. So...with the amicable encouragement of her friends, she sets out to do something different! Viola Davis is very likeable as her BFF, a juggler supreme (super busy) life chaotically wonderful, supportive and self confident friendship. Liz makes an unexpected proposal to take a sabbatical from her normal life and journals her adventures along the way.The script was good, the cinematography great, and the director captured the essence of the woman and her companions. But the film was contradictory and just about 30 minutes too long. To say Liz was in an unhappy marriage bothered me...Liz was in an unhappy life (her own) and engages on an outer journey to places of inner discovery. She sets sail for Bali to find her journey's map, then on to Italy where she easily makes friends and revels in the wonders of a culture who is like a relaxed pair of jeans...you know, with the expandable waist? Liz even delivers a lecture on how unhealthy America is to women and their body image (gasp...muffin top stomachs!) She pledges to defy social mores to her newfound Swedish friend...to just ""let go and live"" while in the land of love and culinary delight. The problem is the camera then follows them to a boutique where they painfully, dully, try on several pairs of too tight pants, enduring the torture of having someone help them pull the zipper shut, whilst lying down for maximum flatbelly...ultimately buying another denim corset. It just doesn't compute. I guess I was hoping for more scenes of the history of Rome and more of the amazing food and drink...too much time on spaghetti (uhm, yeah, we have that here in the USA). Found myself wishing i could see the Sistine Chapel and more of the local, delights in bread, cheese, and pasta. Okay, so a letdown with the Italian sequence....the saving grace was the beautiful language and total lack of neuroses in the Italian culture,...at least within the confines of Liz's encounters.India was my favorite part of the story, it was humorous, capturing both the ruinous filth of the city and its collective devotion to prayer and enlightenment. Liz transcends her privileged, neurotic, monkey chatter thoughts by forming an intimate, platonic bond with another American devotee (played wonderfully by Richard Jenkins), who shares his story and prompts her (sometimes with an emotional cattle prod) to keep walking the inner path. Again though...too much time on watching someone meditate...uhm, hello? Its kind of like watching someone take a nap... not really engaging...unless you are going to throw in special effects. Our Liz was just not experiencing any significant inner plateaus during meditation, so no swirly whirly colors or visions...I would humbly suggest leaving some of this segment on the cutting floor.Back to Bali for the final installment, where Liz reconnects with her Yoda like shaman,""Ketut,"" who gives her tasks,throwing in niblets of common sense, with an adorable toothless grin and weird accent. To give the story credit, Liz (Julia Roberts) does her best work here....in particular, a scene on the beach where she portrays abject horror at the reality of being alone with the very vulnerable, and sensitive Javier Bardem I(""Felipe"")...a guarded, yet affable divorced gentleman she is growing very close to. Felipe is so diametrically different that he can easily see she is seeking a ""champion,"" instead of the ""boys"" her history involves. Liz resists, of course, in her typical New Yorky stubborness of trying to find something on the exterior to ""fix"" her interior flaws. Many referenced the fortune cookie ending where she runs toward discomfort, risk, uncertainty and another chance at love. This time with someone who brings out the best in her...All in all, i would suggest this movie as a video rental...the movie theatre involved me eating too much popcorn and milkduds, during the parts that i would have left out. Cutting 30 minutes would have been way cool. Roberts, Jenkins, Bardem....all wonderful, and its admirable when anyone, from any class (even the well heeled upper, elite) takes the path less traveled...",3,"A LONG, different path...",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,4596,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'felt', 'screenplay', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'talented', 'magic', 'Liz', 'Gilbert', 'journalist', 'who', 'spiritually', 'emotionally', 'bereft', 'Roberts', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'confused', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'uncertain', 'generous', 'spirit', 'affable', 'vulnerable', 'Emerging', 'ill', 'matched', 'marriage', 'dating', 'more', 'spiritually', 'enlightened', 'boy', 'toy', '.Liz', 'more', 'life', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'men', 'So', 'amicable', 'encouragement', 'friends', 'out', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'very', 'likeable', 'BFF', 'juggler', 'supreme', 'super', 'busy', 'life', 'chaotically', 'wonderful', 'supportive', 'self', 'confident', 'friendship', 'Liz', 'unexpected', 'proposal', 'take', 'sabbatical', 'normal', 'life', 'journals', 'adventures', 'way.The', 'script', 'was', 'good', 'cinematography', 'great', 'director', 'captured', 'essence', 'woman', 'companions', 'film', 'was', 'contradictory', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'say', 'Liz', 'was', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'bothered', 'Liz', 'was', 'unhappy', 'life', 'own', 'outer', 'journey', 'places', 'inner', 'discovery', 'sail', 'Bali', 'find', 'journey', 'map', 'then', 'Italy', 'where', 'easily', 'friends', 'revels', 'wonders', 'culture', 'who', 'relaxed', 'pair', 'jeans', 'know', 'expandable', 'waist', 'Liz', 'even', 'lecture', 'how', 'unhealthy', 'America', 'women', 'body', 'image', 'gasp', 'top', 'stomachs', 'defy', 'social', 'mores', 'newfound', 'Swedish', 'friend', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'live', 'land', 'love', 'culinary', 'delight', 'problem', 'camera', 'then', 'boutique', 'where', 'painfully', 'dully', 'try', 'several', 'pairs', 'too', 'tight', 'pants', 'enduring', 'torture', 'having', 'someone', 'help', 'pull', 'zipper', 'shut', 'whilst', 'lying', 'down', 'maximum', 'flatbelly', 'ultimately', 'buying', 'denim', 'corset', 'just', ""n't"", 'compute', 'guess', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'scenes', 'history', 'Rome', 'more', 'amazing', 'food', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spaghetti', 'uhm', 'yeah', 'have', 'here', 'USA', 'Found', 'wishing', 'i', 'could', 'see', 'Sistine', 'Chapel', 'more', 'local', 'delights', 'bread', 'cheese', 'pasta', 'Okay', 'letdown', 'Italian', 'sequence', '.the', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'beautiful', 'language', 'total', 'lack', 'neuroses', 'Italian', 'culture', 'least', 'confines', 'Liz', 'encounters.India', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'story', 'was', 'humorous', 'capturing', 'ruinous', 'filth', 'city', 'collective', 'devotion', 'prayer', 'enlightenment', 'Liz', 'privileged', 'neurotic', 'monkey', 'chatter', 'thoughts', 'forming', 'intimate', 'platonic', 'bond', 'American', 'devotee', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'who', 'shares', 'story', 'sometimes', 'emotional', 'cattle', 'prod', 'keep', 'walking', 'inner', 'path', 'Again', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'watching', 'someone', 'meditate', 'uhm', 'hello', 'kind', 'watching', 'someone', 'take', 'nap', 'not', 'really', 'engaging', 'are', 'going', 'throw', 'special', 'effects', 'Liz', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'experiencing', 'significant', 'inner', 'plateaus', 'meditation', 'swirly', 'whirly', 'colors', 'visions', 'would', 'humbly', 'suggest', 'leaving', 'segment', 'cutting', 'floor.Back', 'Bali', 'final', 'installment', 'where', 'Liz', 'Yoda', 'shaman', 'Ketut', 'who', 'tasks', 'throwing', 'niblets', 'common', 'sense', 'adorable', 'toothless', 'grin', 'weird', 'accent', 'give', 'story', 'credit', 'Liz', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'best', 'work', 'here', '.in', 'particular', 'scene', 'beach', 'where', 'abject', 'horror', 'reality', 'being', 'alone', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'sensitive', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Felipe', 'guarded', 'yet', 'affable', 'divorced', 'gentleman', 'growing', 'very', 'close', 'Felipe', 'so', 'diametrically', 'different', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'seeking', 'champion', 'instead', 'boys', 'history', 'Liz', 'course', 'typical', 'New', 'Yorky', 'stubborness', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'exterior', 'fix', 'interior', 'flaws', 'Many', 'referenced', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'ending', 'where', 'discomfort', 'risk', 'uncertainty', 'chance', 'love', 'time', 'someone', 'who', 'out', 'best', 'i', 'would', 'suggest', 'movie', 'video', 'rental', 'movie', 'theatre', 'involved', 'eating', 'too', 'much', 'popcorn', 'milkduds', 'parts', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'Cutting', '30', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'cool', 'Roberts', 'Jenkins', 'Bardem', '.all', 'wonderful', 'admirable', 'when', 'anyone', 'class', 'even', 'well', 'heeled', 'upper', 'elite', 'path', 'less', 'traveled']",Eat Pray Love

No doubt this film will bring in many viewers due to the high-grossing memoir and what has been come to be called the Oprah effect. Oprah Winfrey has devoted TV shows to the book (one of her book club's selections) and recently a show was aired featuring Julia Roberts.Julia, as Elizabeth Gilbert, is thirty-something, married and working in New York as a writer. She comes to the realization that she feels nothing for the life she has created and her marriage ends. After a messy divorce and another failed relationship, Elizabeth embarks on a year round trip to Italy, India and Bali.In Italy, Elizabeth finds friendship and discovers how to relax and enjoy life. In India, her quest becomes more spiritual and she befriends Richard from Texas, played by Richard Jenkins. By example, Richard helps Elizabeth find forgiveness in herself. In Bali, she continues her spiritual pursuit while trying to find balance in life. Elizabeth becomes smitten with a Brazilian, played by Javier Bardem, and must decide if she can maintain her own individuality while falling in love.The story line is well written by Ryan Murphy (of Glee Fame) and Jennifer Salt and the acting is top notch as it should be with such a gifted cast. This will become a highly regarded film for Roberts, although not to the degree as her Oscar-winning portrayal of ""Erin Brockovich."" If any actors are noticed during award season, Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem may have to compete with each other for supporting nods. The movie is beautifully film by Cinematographer Robert Richardson and will be a delight for anyone starved for beautiful scenery.Yes, this film could be classified as a chick film, but the lessons of a life well lived make the film more than just a nice interlude. It is a thoughtful film with messages that are deeper than any chick flick could ever hope to produce. This film will speak to anyone that has found times when they were in need of nourishment, inspiration and love.""Eat Pray Love"" is rated PG-13 and has a run time of 2 hrs. and 13 minutesEnjoy this review?

1319849,AHQBXGFFMBBC9,B0033AGJ5Y,kazper,"[0, 0]","I borrowed this movie from a local library after hearing so many good comments about it. Perhaps we watched different movies, because I was was rather disappointed.The story revolves around Liz, a woman who visits a medicine man that reads her palm and tells her about the future. She decides to take his information to heart and begins making major changes in her life based on this knowledge. She begins by divorcing her husband, a man with lots of ambition but lacks focus. She finds comfort in the arms of a younger stage actor but shortly after realizes it was more of a rebound relationship than anything.In an attempt to figure out her priorities, she decides to take a year long trip through various locations hoping to find whatever it is she is missing. Her travels begin in Italy where she happens upon an English speaking Swedish woman at a local coffee shop. The two of them become friends and her social network in Italy begins expanding. Here she learns that sometimes doing nothing is alright, which is probably the best advice in the whole movie.Next she moves on to India to visit a spirtual leader she became interested in while dating the actor/yoga instructor. This seemed rather odd because it seemed like she wasn't all that interested in the leader while dating her boyfriend, so why would she travel around the world to attend her retreat in a different country? Here she is able to forgive herself for the divorce and any other wrongdoings in her life.The final locale is Bali where she reunites with the medicine man from the beginning and becomes his temporary assistant. He teaches her to find her balance in life, but ultimately tells her to forget the balance if she can find a love strong enough.Maybe the book is better because it can dwell more on tiny details and personal reflections. The movie, however, came across as a woman who had a pretty good life (successful author, large circle of friends, and a caring husband) who decides she wants more/something different. It seemed very much like a man's mid-life crisis taken to the extreme. At least with a mid-life crisis you might buy an expensive car or &#34;toy&#34;, but Liz decides to leave everyone she loves behind in order to go on a self imposed mission to discover herself mentally and spiritually. For the average person this type of &#34;retreat&#34; would not be monetarily obtainable, but due to her success she is able to shirk all obligations for an entire year.",2,Unimpressed,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,2465,"['borrowed', 'movie', 'local', 'library', 'hearing', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'comments', 'Perhaps', 'watched', 'different', 'movies', 'was', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Liz', 'woman', 'who', 'medicine', 'man', 'palm', 'future', 'take', 'information', 'heart', 'making', 'major', 'changes', 'life', 'based', 'knowledge', 'divorcing', 'husband', 'man', 'lots', 'ambition', 'focus', 'comfort', 'arms', 'younger', 'stage', 'actor', 'shortly', 'realizes', 'was', 'more', 'rebound', 'relationship', 'attempt', 'figure', 'out', 'priorities', 'take', 'year', 'long', 'trip', 'various', 'locations', 'hoping', 'find', 'whatever', 'missing', 'travels', 'begin', 'Italy', 'where', 'English', 'speaking', 'Swedish', 'woman', 'local', 'coffee', 'shop', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'social', 'network', 'Italy', 'expanding', 'Here', 'sometimes', 'doing', 'nothing', 'alright', 'probably', 'best', 'advice', 'whole', 'movie.Next', 'India', 'visit', 'spirtual', 'leader', 'became', 'interested', 'dating', 'actor/yoga', 'instructor', 'seemed', 'rather', 'odd', 'seemed', 'was', ""n't"", 'interested', 'leader', 'dating', 'boyfriend', 'so', 'why', 'would', 'travel', 'world', 'attend', 'retreat', 'different', 'country', 'Here', 'able', 'forgive', 'divorce', 'other', 'wrongdoings', 'life.The', 'final', 'locale', 'Bali', 'where', 'medicine', 'man', 'beginning', 'temporary', 'assistant', 'find', 'balance', 'life', 'ultimately', 'forget', 'balance', 'can', 'find', 'love', 'strong', 'enough.Maybe', 'book', 'better', 'can', 'dwell', 'more', 'tiny', 'details', 'personal', 'reflections', 'movie', 'however', 'came', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'life', 'successful', 'author', 'large', 'circle', 'friends', 'caring', 'husband', 'who', 'more/something', 'different', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'man', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'taken', 'extreme', 'least', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'might', 'buy', 'expensive', 'car', '34', 'toy', '34', 'Liz', 'leave', 'everyone', 'behind', 'order', 'go', 'self', 'imposed', 'mission', 'discover', 'mentally', 'spiritually', 'average', 'person', 'type', '34', 'retreat', '34', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'monetarily', 'obtainable', 'due', 'success', 'able', 'shirk', 'obligations', 'entire', 'year']",Eat Pray Love

I think it's probably a testament to many relationships these days where people just leave over tiny shreds.I didn't read the book so I imagine it was probably fantastic, but it's my understanding that some of what really happened to this author were adjusted in the movie.  If you can believe that the author's life was even more selfish than the way the movie portrays.  They actually had to tone it down a little or she would've really been vilified.For example: In the movie the Julia Roberts character wakes up one day from her marriage to the Billy Crudup character and decides she wants a divorce.  He presses her for a good reason which she's unable to divulge eloquently.  She then proceeds to fall into a passionate romance with a younger guy played by James Franco.  She goes through the same turmoil with him and leaves him setting off on a year journey to Italy, India and Bali to find herself.How it allegedly really went down was the real author cheated on her husband with this younger guy and left her husband for him.  That younger guy then cheated on her and left her in the end.  Now that should've been in the movie to teach one a lesson about how you treat others will come back to bite you.  I guess the filmmakers thought that the audiences would think she deserved it.  There is no way around her life.  It was all me-me-me and I-I-I.She spends a good portion in Italy eating her way through it and hanging with new friends.  Her friend complains that she needs to stop eating because she's gaining a few pounds.  The Julia Roberts character says, ""Has a guy ever thrown you out or said something?"" The friend says, ""No.""  Julia says, ""Because he hit the jackpot he's with a naked woman.""  Um - obviously she doesn't know much about what the man is REALLY thinking.All in all the story could've been worked a bit more to make her more of a likable protagonist.  The reason she's likable at all is because we're watching Julia Roberts who brings good things to the screen.  The message is hidden in there deep if you can get past all that.  And the scenery, acting and the way the film is shot keeps you afloat and interested.  There is a message in it that were all looking for enlightenment or answers or to be happy, but just don't use others or jump into relationships you're not ready for, because you then you just look like a dishonest loser.Julia Roberts makes this work - an unknown actress might not have been able to bring as much light as possible to such a negative character.  Does the protagonist find everything she's looking for?  The last half hour of the movie is the more intriguing, so it does end with a bang, but will you be able to hold out until you get there?  If there is any great line it's the man-friend she meets while praying in India.  He says, ""To get to the castle - you got to swim through the moat.""  He's full of soliloquy's to which she asks, ""Do you always talk in bumper stickers?""  That was a line from the movie, ""Postcards from the Edge"" with Meryl Streep by the way.

She goes on a 1 year journey traveling to these 3 countries searching for happiness.I was inspired by the quote given by Ketut: ""In order to stay happy, you must always know where you are"". If you do know your place in the journey of life, you will accept everything that happens to you and will have inner peace, eventually becoming happy. I believe this could simply be done by grabbing a piece of paper and write/draw on it your journey through life. Put on it life's basic elements such as success, love, family, spirituality, health...etc. See where you are. See the big picture. See which areas you need to improve and perfect. Hang this paper somewhere in the house and look at it everyday. Keep thinking about it, and I believe this is how you could achieve inner peace and balance.I heard people criticize this movie for being slow and sometimes boring. Well, the pace of the movie MUST be slow since its about achieving inner balance. You can't expect a fast paced movie about inner balance to be effective and received well. It has to be slow and need to take its time, just like the journey for the quest of happiness.Good movie, I highly recommend it.",5,"In order to stay happy, you must always know where you are",1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,1322,"['Inspiring', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'role', 'heartbroken', 'divorced', 'women', 'who', 'travel', 'Italy', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'find', 'inner', 'peace', 'balance', '1', 'year', 'journey', 'traveling', '3', 'countries', 'searching', 'happiness.I', 'was', 'inspired', 'quote', 'given', 'Ketut', 'order', 'stay', 'happy', 'must', 'always', 'know', 'where', 'are', 'do', 'know', 'place', 'journey', 'life', 'will', 'accept', 'everything', 'will', 'have', 'inner', 'peace', 'eventually', 'becoming', 'happy', 'believe', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'done', 'grabbing', 'piece', 'paper', 'write/draw', 'journey', 'life', 'Put', 'life', 'basic', 'elements', 'such', 'success', 'love', 'family', 'spirituality', 'health', 'etc', 'See', 'where', 'are', 'See', 'big', 'picture', 'See', 'areas', 'need', 'improve', 'perfect', 'Hang', 'paper', 'somewhere', 'house', 'look', 'everyday', 'Keep', 'thinking', 'believe', 'how', 'could', 'achieve', 'inner', 'peace', 'balance.I', 'heard', 'people', 'criticize', 'movie', 'being', 'slow', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'Well', 'pace', 'movie', 'MUST', 'be', 'slow', 'achieving', 'inner', 'balance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'inner', 'balance', 'be', 'effective', 'received', 'well', 'be', 'slow', 'need', 'take', 'time', 'just', 'journey', 'quest', 'happiness.Good', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend']",Eat Pray Love

Sorry about that. I usually don't put them in my reviews.Every since I saw the cardboard standup at the movie theater, I wanted to see EAT PRAY LOVE. I didn't make to the theater when it was out and waited patiently in hopes that my local library would get it in. And they did. I waited three weeks on a waiting list and when I got the call it was my turn, I went in to pick it up immediately and planned to watch it that night.I must say I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I was really expecting something profound.  Yet as often as the case, I heard the book was really good by a few people. Still, having watched the movie I can't say I'm eager to read it. A positive note, the acting was good.I for one am a deeply committed person, so right off the bat the main character leaving her husband the way she did, didn't sit well with me. As the story unfolded, I kept waiting for something, something that never happened.The flashbacks of her husband put in my mind she'd come to her senses and discover she really did love him, and needed to give her marriage the work, commitment and chance every marriage deserves. It bothered me greatly that it never materialized.I totally get that people often make the wrong decision, and that one needs to discover who they are, their purpose in life and all that. In EAT PRAY LOVE, honestly, the only connection to the title I came away with is EAT. She did indulge in eating. As far as PRAY, I was thrown for a loop on the whole praying thing. As a Christian, did I miss something? Or was the PRAY part, praying to a picture of a woman. That was a little disturbing to me to say the least. As far as LOVE, well yeah, she quickly went from one guy to another with a hint of LOVE. Is it me or did she basically jump into another relationship like she confessed she had from the marriage she'd just ran away from?So in the end I was sorely disappointed in this movie.

I thought she brought a lot to the character - after all, this story is based on a real woman's life experiences.  At times, the movie seemed a bit rushed, but again, I think that has more to do with the fact that you're cramming a year long journey into 2 hours of film.A lot of people didn't like the book, and subsequently the movie, because they felt that it was all me, me, me and that the author was self-centered or self-righteous.

1319866,A18HHKM6WGEF9D,B0033AGJ5Y,"L. Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 4]","Unfortunately, I think this movie watered down some of the themes of the book, and the character of Elizabeth Gilbert, to the point where it lost its depth. Part of what makes Elizabeth Gilbert likable in the book (and in my opinion she is likable, although I know some people don't feel that way) is that she is a keen observer and social commentator, in addition to being funny. Her sharpness, particularly her ironic insights, and her humor were entirely lost in this movie, leaving the character kind of insipid.Themes were watered down too. In the book, Elizabeth Gilbert's uncertainty about wanting kids, and the resentment she feels at social and familial pressure to do so, is more of a driver in the dissolution of her marriage than it is here. Perhaps the writers/producers felt that a mainstream audience couldn't handle questioning of social convention on that scale. As another example, in the book when Elizabeth collects money from her Western friends to help her Balinese friend Wayan purchase a house, the resulting problems spur an interesting analysis of cultural differences, and the problems inherent in trying to help someone from another social world. In the movie it's watered down to a feel-good success story (as is Elizabeth's romance there, while in the book it is considerably more complicated.) The India spiritual scenes are pretty watered down too - her insights are more self-helpy than spiritual.All that being said, I enjoyed watching Julia Roberts most of the time, and most of the supporting cast was very strong, especially Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem. The shots of Italy, India and Bali were all lovely. So set your expectations accordingly, especially if you've read the book, and you can enjoy what there is to enjoy in this movie.

1319872,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B0033AGJ5Y,"L P ""lilip""","[1, 1]","The way they hyped up this movie and book - whose premise I really do like - I expected a nice piece depicting someone's journey through self-discovery. Instead, it turned out to be a trite two hour movie depicting the shameless self-indulgences and superficiality of a vain person on the quest for the elusive ""finding yourself"" mantra she undoubtedly read up upon in the self help aisle at Barnes and Noble. Because of how the character acted and was portrayed, the audience just never gets to identify and empathize with her and her ""problems"". For two hours you sit there and watch her whine about her life, how it is/was so unhappy and unfulfilled and what have you, but you never know why really. If the goal is to have the audience empathize with a character and identify with it, they have to know what's bothering them, be let in on their pain and unhappiness. That is what makes a great movie. The writers in this one seemed to want the audience to just take their word for it that she was unhappy and unfulfilled - despite all evidence to the contrary. Someone once said if the problem is in one's head, it still is a problem. But in this movie, we never get to see what that is - imagined or real. The worst thing a movie maker can do is create unrelateable characters.Julia Roberts did a lousy job and her character is both unlikeable and unrelateable. This movie is supposed to tell us that material things and money are not the source to happiness and that there are other sources of happiness unrelated to such external things. Yet the main character (Roberts) spends a year travelling around the world living in great places that cost a lot of money. Later on, this movie promoted a lip-gloss by Lnacome or something. Yeah...way to send a message about material things not mattering. They should have pointed out that trying to find yourself when you are broke is much harder to do. Luckily, Roberts in this movie didn't have to worry about that ""tiny detail"". One should be so lucky to have so much money that it is not worth mentioning anymore - even though it still is used to buy you all the sanity and self-discovery trips in the world.But it is not just that. The main character was annoying for other reasons as well. I mean her spiritual guide is a self-announced medicine man in Bali with amnesia. Yes amnesia, as in brain damage. She turns her life upside down because of the random crap he made up and told her, and then a year later when she goes back, to tell her ""mentor"" what she did, he doesnt even remember her!! It was hilarious. I thought they were kidding and that at this point the movie would take a turn; that her character would finally realize how immature and insane it was to do all those things to herself based on the random musings of a silly, old man who doesnt even know her. But NO. It stayed. That was it. Oh so conveniently, the shaman starts suddenly remembering her after she is about to burst into tears at the realization that she might have screwed up her life based on the words of a random, senile man.  That's deep.The movie went downhill from there at an alarming rate. I have never seen so much substance-deficiency and implausibility of both story and characters packed into two hours or so of narcissistic screen time for a middle-aged actress. The supporting characters were unlikable too and Julia Roberts just seemed too old and burned out for some of the ""boys"" she dated - like James Franco. They wanted to make it look like her relationship with Franco - which she started 5 minutes after her divorce by the way - didnt work out for other deep reasons, like she loved him, but it is obvious that it didnt work out cause she is too old for him and he a vacuous moron.  And then Javier Bardem. Obviously both of these people are on rebound, especially Bardem (who is 39 and has a 20 year old son but ok) but still after a couple of weeks of humping in the tropical hut, he confesses his ever endearing love for her like a starry-eyed 17 year old teenager. I seriously thought she knew better and would respond that she didnt feel the same way, that she didnt love him. But ta da, it turns out - despite all evidence to the contrary and what we see - she is in fact madly in love with him but (how original) is too scared to admit it cause she is afraid to get hurt. Yeah right. Could they have packed any more lame cliches into that?They could and they did because in the end, just like any other woman I guess, all she needed obviously to get out of her funk was love and riding off into the sunset (literally) with her man.Coming out of this garbage they tried to pass as a ""wonderful journey"" I figured that not only did I not get anything out of this movie and the supposed journey, but that obviously neither did the protagonist. Just as we never found out why she was really having a crisis and was unhappy, we also never find out why and how she got happy again. This movie is based on the premise that she lost her mojo and needed to find it, but looking closer it seems that she never had it. After that one year of travelling and exploring and meeting all these supposedly cool and enlightened people (quitters is more like it, see Bardem's character), she doesnt seem to have found more purpose in life than before. She doesnt look and act changed, enlightened or as if she had gained some insight into who she really is and what she really wants out of life. She spent a year travelling around, ""hanging out"" and having a good time and all she got to show for is a man. As expected, because by being a self-absorbed, spoiled brat who never had to do a hard day's work in life and doesn't listen to people you are not likely to gain insight into anything. Spiritually, she could have been Carrie Bradshaw's sidekick when she went into hysteria.In the end, she is exactly where she started: nowhere, drowning in her own superficiality and shallow-ness. The only exciting thing in her life will be a long distance relationship with Bardem between Bali and New York until she gets bored again and leaves, thinking that maybe the answers in life are to be found in the elusive wisdom of this one medicine man she read up upon on her last trip to the self help aisle - this time at Borders.",2,Superficial Movie with an Insipid Plot Line and an Unsympathetic Protagonist.

1319873,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B0033AGJ5Y,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[1, 3]","What did I think? Well, ""Eat Pray Love"" is way too long. At two hours and 20 minutes, a film has to be more than the sum of its parts to be memorable. ""Eat Pray Love"" is not. We're never really convinced why Roberts as Liz Gilbert needs to indulge in a year off to travel the globe, and to go to the three specific places she visits. We know she wants to go back to Bali to meet again with an elderly spiritual adviser she meets there at the start of the film. We know she decides to go to an ashram in India to follow the teachings of a spiritual leader her vacuous post-divorce lover (James Franco; wasting his considerable skills)followed. Unfortunately, Franco was totaling uninteresting and not believeable as a man that Liz could really care for. Her character doesn't even seem to be particularly taken with the vocation of his particular ashram. We know she decides to go to Italy because, well, if given the chance, wouldn't we all go?  Thus begins the ""Eat"" part of her journey.Along the way, the solo Roberts as Gilbert (from now on, I'll just say ""Liz"")meets many and makes friends in every venue. During the journey, the crystallized reason for my enjoyment makes itself known at several turns...all involve touching small moments of friendship shared between Liz and someone who has come to mean a lot to her. It goes without saying that I go to see tear-jerker movies (my latest was the schmaltzy and wonderful ""Letters to Juliet""), but they play and prey on their audience. Far more enjoyable are the movies which are subtle enough to create a lump in your throat, have your eyes well up, but allow you to flow through the moment on to the next scene. There are several times in the film that this happened to me, and those moments (and the cinematography and the incredible soundtrack) make me happy that I plunked down my $9.50.One of them involves Liz, who celebrates Thanksgiving with her adopted friends in Italy. As the dinner nears, it is discovered that the friend in charge of the turkey had not even defrosted it. The group enjoys the rest of the dinner, enjoys immensely the time they spend together, and then all nap through the night while the turkey cooks... waking in time to have it for breakfast. The scene where the camera pans across all the guests in ""group nap"" are charming, the reveal of the reason they stayed, the turkey, is one of those small chuckles and moments where you really feel the characters, because you have known people in your life who would have done exactly that with you.In India (""Pray""), Liz participates as a spectator at an arranged marriage between a young girl and her groom. During the ceremony, she pans back to her own wedding day, a wedding to Stephen (Billy Crudup) that ended in disaster when she abruptly determined that she could no longer pretend that she was happy with him, while pretending that their life together was enough for her. It wasn't. The poignancy of Liz' memories is when she imagines that they dance to the song that SHOULD have played at their wedding reception (the song that did play gives us another totally charming flashback, perhaps Crudup's only likeable moment in the movie). Into the mix comes the first 8 bars of ""Harvest Moon"", the ethereal love song that instantly makes you realize that Neil Young is a genius. I'm instantly transported by Young's imagery, and the lump comes back into my throat. I try hard to match my own memories of Harvest Moon with the dancing scene between Crudup and Roberts, but my own memories are more tangible and more connected to the song than the scene on film. However, the moment stands out as a reason for me to watch the film on DVD, and also wakes me up to how extraordinary and funky the soundtrack is; with two songs by Young, two by Eddie Vedder and some delicious Brazilian jazz, it is unforgettable.Also in India, the movie's best character, Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) makes an appearance, and from the casual nickname he gives Liz (based on her habit of eating everything in sight), ""Groceries"" , to the poignant scene in which he discloses the family tragedy that brought him on his own quest to India, Jenkins adds a friendship for Liz that feels more real than any that come first or follow later. Every scene that Jenkins is in is absorbing; you are left somewhat flat when he leaves and Liz is still in India, and you find yourself asking...why? Jenkins, a revelation in his role in the popular cable series, Six Feet Under, and a revelation as Theron's father in the bleak ""North Country"", has been wasting away, waiting for Hollywood to rediscover him. Looks like that wait is over.On to Bali, where the movie gets its biggest appeal; Javier Bardem as Felipe joins the film and finally Liz's quest doesn't seem so silly anymore. There is real chemistry between Roberts and Bardem, and the romance is so delicious that the lumps are back in my throat again. Also hard to beat are Bardem's moments on the phone and in person with the young actor who plays his son. His joy and sadness are so real. Liz's crusade to help a destitute mother in Bali by gathering donations from America also threatens to unravel me. Bali is so beautiful, Liz becomes so much more believable there, that the infinite 1.5 hours it took to get to this point don't matter so much anymore.And as the film wraps, I realize that, despite the harsh criticism from others, I appreciated Roberts' craft, her ability to capture you with facial expression, some of the supporting players, the beauty of her stops in the world, and the quirky soundtrack, far more than I ever enjoyed the book. Screenwriters Jennifer Salt and Ryan Murphy (who directed; also from ""Glee"", ""Nip Tuck"" and ""Running With Scissors"") may have left the audience stranded and muddled for long stretches, but they did manage to eke out a film that, in a way, was worth a look.",3,Eat Pray Love - the film.

1319877,AJ5247U67E5HB,B0033AGJ5Y,magicgirl,"[3, 4]","The movie was good for its entertainment value such as: beautiful scenes of italy, bali and india, her unique outfits, and just an excuse to be lazy and watch someone else travel. So overall it was nice, just not realistic.Now for the bad part. Its sooo fake. Its like a fairytale. Here's what they try to make us believe:1) MONEY IS OPTIONALShe allegedly got divorced and had no money. But yet, she manages to take a trip to 3 countries and stay there for several years?? Not once did she even get a job to support herself. She stayed in pretty nice places for it to be ""free"". She even had money to take italian classes from a hot tutor.2) DESIGNER CLOTHESHow did she have the money? How did she have the time to go shopping? I didn't see her go shopping. Her wardrobe was very nice despite the fact that she only traveled with ""one little bag"". Not realistic at all! For a girl to carry such a small bag with  barely any clothes or makeup, they would not look like julia roberts who would wake up freshly made up and with perfect boticelli curls. And we cannot forget how clean she looked while in India and Bali.3) GIRLS ARE SO NICE AND EASY TO MAKE FRIENDS WITHNot! In real life, girls couldn't care less about other girls. But in this movie, she makes girlfriends easily. And in all the cases, they approached her. She didn't have to do any effort. Its as if they knew she was the celebrity ""julia roberts"" even though shes ""acting"" like someone else. I'm sorry but in real life, girls are catty as can be!4) LIFE IS PERFECT WHEN YOU TRAVELNothing annoying or bad happened to her while she traveled. She wasn't mugged. She didn't really have a bad day. Things always worked out for her. That's not realistic. The only time something ""bad"" happened ended up being ""good"", like hurting her leg to meet the guy of her dreams.5) GURUS ARE WAITING AROUND TO HELP WHITE AMERICAN GIRLS FIND THEMSELVESIm not really sure what his intentions were. Exactly how was he benefiting from this relationship? Was he that lonely that she was his only friend? She only brought stress to the guru.6) GAINING WEIGHT IN THE MOVIE MEANS WEIGHING 125LBSThe girl she met in Italy was complaining about gaining weight and she was so skinny. So they set out on a journey to find bigger jeans...whoa thats a great story. If that girl is fat, then I must be obese. I was laughing out loud when they were both in the dressing room trying to close her size 4 jeans on her obviously tiny body. It was sooo ridiculous because the jeans obviously fit her tiny ass. But they kept acting like she was the girl in the movie ""Precious"".7) MEN ARE LINING UPFor us normal looking folk, men don't just appear the way they appear in this movie. If i  went to a crowded play, i certainly would not catch the eye of the lead character. 1) because its crowded 2) because i don't look like julia robertsThis movie is just an insight on what its like to be beautifully attractive.8) WHAT THE HELL WAS SHE LOOKING FOR? DID SHE EVEN FIND IT?I still don't know what she wanted in the first place. I mean, i just thought she wanted a long vacation. But isn't that what everyone wants? We just don't have the money like she did. She claimed she wanted peace. But how exactly? In the form of a man? I thought the movie would be a little deeper than that. I think she was just bored the whole time.9) POOR LIZ, HER LIFE WAS SO AWFUL BEFORE THE TRIP!They didn't convince me that her life was so bad beforeShe was in a mansion, friends, her cute husband, what was the problem? Well, they did'nt really show it if there was one. If it was an issue of editing, there were many other parts of the movie that i would have sacrificed so that they could add a scene about why she hated her life so much.10) LIZ WAS VERY RESPONSIBLE TO LEAVER HER MARRIAGE OF 8 YEARS SO ABRUPTLYI wonder if she even had a heartbeat. She didn't give him a chance to fix it. And she left halfway around the world. I don't think he was that bad. She acted like he abused her or something.11) SHE'S NOT INDEPENDENT, BUT SHE THINKS SHE IS.....Yeah, she did make the trip halfway around the world, BUT, she only makes decisions based on the guru/medicine healer's opinion. In the end, she has no mind of her own.12) LACK OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTjames franco (david), richard and her husband didn't really have good character development. They all just disappear into the void.13) How did Felipe fall in love with her so fast?They barely just met. I can't figure this one out. Was it because felipes son told his dad that its time he have sex again?14) POOR & MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS CAN'T HAVE ENLIGHTENMENTWhy? Because we don't have the money to take years off our jobs and go to 3 countries and go on vacation.15) The guru/medicine healer really needed subtitles. I tried hard to understand a word he said.16) THE TITLE OF THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ""SELFISH AROUND THE WORLD""Liz is selfish, not because she is trying to find herself but because of the way she is with other people in this movie. She doesn't think of others while she is trying to find herself. They tried to make her seem so nice by giving the house to the family, but that was the only nice gesture. She didn't care about anyone else 's feelings.HERE'S WHAT THE MOVIE HAS TO OFFER:1)A scenic break from our mundane lives that last about 2 hours.2)It will make you think its time to go on vacation.3)Will make you want to cook or eat italian food4)Its fun to make fun of this unrealistic movieBut that's all it is. Other than that, it was entertaining and i love julia roberts charisma and charm.But don't expect to find your own enlightenment here.",3,Unrealistic but  Entertaining,1305590400,"05 17,

1319880,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B0033AGJ5Y,Marc Cabir Davis,"[3, 4]","Is there a more wishy washy actress than Julia Roberts? I certainly haven't come across one. Perhaps the least deserving Best Actress Oscar winner in history, Roberts has relied on her 'charming smile' to get through roles without any discernible 'acting' going on. Case in point : ""Erin Brokovich"" and the woefully overwrought ""My Best Friends Wedding"". However, there are some of us who find Roberts' wide jawed smile rather disconcerting, unsettling and a little frightening, and lets just say this film does nothing to prove her case as an 'actress'.The book was bad enough (not many of you know that what happened to the author after the book was published and it is probably not going to make a very savory movie), but the film takes all of its vapid elements and multiplies it by a 100. The 'Pray' section for instance, is bewildering. Its difficult to ascertain what Roberts is going through when she closes her eyes on her meditative journeys, but on film these segments don't make any sense and don't reveal anything at all, except that a woman somewhere is closing her eyes. The director is especially gifted at sucking the life out of a scene, it has to be mentioned.The problem is with the script, as well as with Roberts over-confident performance. She might perhaps think that shes at a stage in her life where she can 'walk through' any role, but lets face it, the woman barely got through ""The Mexican"" without being upstaged by Pitt at every stage so she should really rethink her acting strategies. The worst part is the end, which neatly ties together her escapades and presents it as a more holistic episode of ""Sex and the City"" (should be seen to be believed). The supporting cast, often goodlooking but seldom talented, are totally wasted. The cinematography is beautiful but any of you with a home camera in any of these locations would find it hard to take a bad shot, so thats not saying much. Bali and Italy are pretty hard to tamper with on film. Sadly, they seemed to have captured the worst of India here, which is stereotypical of a film that tries to go the spiritual route (much like Kate Winslet in ""Holy Smoke""). Javier Bardem, who is one of the worlds most nuanced actors is relegated to the role of a caricature here, while James Franco (whos lets face it is not going to win an Oscar for expressionism) plays an enlightened palm reader in Bali, which doesn't at all help matters. Billy Crudup is the best thing about this film, and at least he has the decency to only appear for a few minutes here and there.Bottom line, if you don't like Roberts' 'work', stay far, far away. Also, it might be of note that was a lot of eating going on in the film, and much less praying and loving. Well, at least they could keep their lunch down.

The film puts into words and images one take on midlife.  I wonder if it mirrors/symbolizes Margaret Mahler's stages of development.  Italy for symbiosis as highlighted with the merging with spaghetti scene.  India with separation from other/outer focus to an inward one via learning to meditate and Bali with independence and a return to the world with her stepping back into romantic relationships at a more mutual level.The Grimm's tale Duration Of Life also comes to mind:  The first thirty years is filled with a zest for life (Italy), the next thirty with grief and inner work (India or in the Grimm's tale:  the donkey and dog years) and the last phase (Bali or ""the monkey years"") with play and a generative contribution to society (a house was built for a healer).If this movie can be viewed as a metaphorical story for the midlife passage, Robert Bly's words come to mind when he said that fairy tales give us empathy and support to look inward to search for our core beliefs.On another level, this movie reminded me of Holland's Opus which was said to be a comfort movie for those who didn't realize their dreams - this movie for those who didn't experiecne the level of self fulfillment they would have liked or felt designed to experience.The scenes with Richard, who ""speaks in bumper stickers,"" seem to serve as an image of a Boomer mentoring an Xer.

I was hoping for a foreign film, but the choices I looked at under ""video on demand"" at amazon didnt offer any of my choices, so I chose Eat Pray Love.I am glad I didnt read the book, because there is nothing worse than having to read about a woman who apparently has everything drone on and on and on and on and on about having looks, career, a handsome husband, and just be so unhappy.  She didnt drone on verbally, but it was the constant state of unhappiness the character was in that was droning. It sucked my energy.Having done my own spritual quest these past 7 years, it was topped off last June by me breaking my leg, dislocating my knee cap, and tearing ligaments, my meniscus and finally placing cracks between where the joints meet. I've done my share of spiritual quest and I approached this as teaching me something - what i learned I wont share.  Having had to use crutches since June of 2010 (its now december), I've learned to be more in tune with the disabled. I rarely see them in grocery stores, the mall, anywhere. And its taught me that we're so caught up in our own world, that the only time we care about those who live a slower life that is parallel to our superficial lives, is aroudn Christmas.So having to sit through a movie where this woman has looks, a career, money, a handsome husband, numerous friends, is able to walk, eat, cook, essentially take care of herself, travel, and pretty much has more going for her except that she's a dreary soul is hard to sit through.I fast forwarded through alot of it. I'm a Pisces and a big fan of Javier Bardem and he shined like a jewel; thus the 3rd star.I wouldnt recommend eat pray love because it is a homage to egotistical maniacs who bemoan there existence and are not grateful for anything.

1319887,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B0033AGJ5Y,M. Bullions,"[6, 13]","In 2006, a woman named Elizabeth Gilbert wrote a book called Eat Pray Love: A Woman's Search For Everything Across Italy, India, and Indonesia. This little book depicted her search for balance, and a better life. It was endorsed by the almighty Oprah, and therefore, millions of readers across the country, and across the world have been enlightened by her everywoman approach to spirituality, religion, and what needs to be done to live your best life.And, four years later, the film version is released. Naturally, Julia Roberts was selected to play the lead role. And, let me start out by saying, I was a huge fan of the book, and Julia Roberts was NOT who I had in mind to play Gilbert. I saw someone like Kate Winslet, or Anne Hathaway in the lead role. I thought that with Roberts playing the lead role, the story would be transferred from a deep, spiritual journey, to just another Julia Roberts movie.I was pleased to discover that I was wrong in these thoughts. Julia Roberts is a fabulous actress, and like any fabulous actress, she makes you believe that this part couldn't have been played by anybody else. She embodies the role, it's obvious that she spent months, perhaps even a year, getting into character. She is so reminiscent of the Elizabeth Gilbert character. After watching this film, it's clear that she was the obvious choice for the role.In the film, Liz Gilbert (Roberts) is a seemingly happy married woman. She has everything a modern American woman is supposed to want: husband, beautiful home, great friends, terrific job, etc. She discovers that that's not all it takes to make one happy. She divorces her husband (Billy Crudup), and starts to date an actor (James Franco) from a play that she wrote. She finds a beautiful human connection with him, but realizes that even he's not what she really needs.She breaks it off with him, quits her job, and decides to take a journey around the world, that would last one full year. This journey would start in Italy, where she would get in touch with her abandoned love for food, then moving to India, where she would find religion, and then to the Indonesian island of Bali, where she would try to find love again.A colorful array of supporting actors make this film what it is. Viola Davis plays Gilbert's BFF Delia, who is tragically underused, but she is a kind of voice of reason for the wishy-washy emotions of our heroine. Javier Bardem was the obvious choice to play her Indonesian lover Felipe, who has undeniable chemistry with Roberts. Richard Jenkins plays a man who Gilbert meets in India, who acts as sort of a confidante to our main character.The heart of this film, however, lies in the breathtaking cinematography, and beautiful soundtrack. Director Ryan Murphy, of Glee, and Nip/Tuck fame, treats this better than he did his previous adaptation Running With Scissors. It's directed with love, and it follows the book as well as can be expected. He fits alot of gorgeous architecture, and beauty into the massive scope. Each frame is a postcard, and makes the viewer long to take a journey like this at some point in their life. It also is very resonant on an emotional level. It makes you believe that even the most cynical person can find happiness if they allow themselves to.In the end, this isn't a romantic comedy. This isn't a chick flick, it isn't even a `Julia Roberts movie', it's a loving adaptation of an admired memoir. It will surely satisfy fans of the book, as well as fans of Julia Roberts. But, you don't need to be a Roberts fan to appreciate what this film has to offer. Its message is universal, beautiful, and breathtaking.

You could not help but believe that was her own biography, or the same replicated lifestyle of women getting lost in the underworld of acting to please others. The movie narrates the trauma inflicted on actors when acting stops and real living begins. Jane Fonda moved to France, sought spirit in India, peace in Vietnam, but at the end, Fonda ruined every thing in her life to return to the madness of Hollywood. When Hollywood has no need for a senile Fonda. Julia Roberts trailed Fonda in her agonizing loneliness.The eating part was disturbing as well. The Robert must travel to the carbohydrate kitchens of Italy to enjoy the lazy and purposeless life of Italians. In Italy, every one eats, talks, and sleeps. The movie displayed three scenes of the disgusting tradition of poking passerbys in their rear ends by locals with impunity. The assaulted targets have no option but to express anger and disdain, to no avail.Praying in India sounded odd also since all outsiders have no clue what they were reading, hearing, or doing. Intensive course in spirituality did little to reverse Hollywood's deep seated demons. India's spiritual setting sounded like self punishment by isolation and preoccupation as an escape from one's own vices. In comparison to the fat, lazy, and uncivil Italians, the Indians ate less and bothered no foreigner.Love was also missing all along. In America, the writer (Julia Robert) admits to have spent all her life between guys. In Italy, most women were fat, happy, senile, but married for eternity. India was entirely love-free, and spirit-rich. In Bali, love was of the American brand, induced by liquor, dancing, and physical attraction minus chemistry or character.Walking out of the movie, one could not resist the obnoxious and self absorbed role of Julia Robert contrasted with the laid back Italian women whose common sense belongs to the dark ages.",3,Jane Fonda revisited.

Fortunately there are better examples than this story of a woman (Julia Roberts) who realizes her marriage is a sham, gets a divorce then shacks up with a young actor (James Franco).  Na, this doesn't feel right either, so she puts her belongings in storage (what no furniture?) and heads out for a year long journey to Italy, India and Bali.  It's hard to feel too sorry for her.  How many of us could take a sabbatical like that?  She can, as she is a successful writer and speaker about the human condition.  The film is beautifully shot but seems to lack the heart and soul and emotional depth we chick flick types look for.  The movie isn't a total failure however.  The acting is fine; the music is really good, ranging from some nice Brazilian stuff to vintage Neil Young.

This time though I was itching for a magazine well before the movie was halfway through.A woman in mid-life crisis ends her unfulfilling marriage to her equally immature and directionless husband for no other major reason. The divorce is messy with a lot of guilt to be distributed around. A brief (cougar-)affair ends equally badly so she embarks in a year-long journey to redefine herself.The journey starts from Italy where apparently she learns to appreciate life's little pleasures and how to enjoy them guilt-free. This part made me hungry for good Italian pasta with fresh tomato sauce and basil but little else. Having said that I have been to Naples and (with all due respect to my Napolitano friends), one can find much better-tasting pizza in New York.By the way, when someone decides to accept her body no matter its imperfections and goes shopping for larger jeans, she does not then proceed to force the zippers of ...smaller sizes.India was next and it was a disaster. The guru she has traveled so far to meet is visiting the US and her disciples run her ashram like something between a hostel and a Scientology sweat-shop. She receives no enlightening guidance except some overused bromides from a Texan in his post-alcoholic guilt trip.I love Indian culture and have a great respect for Indian people. However, unlike SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, this movie will not make you want to visit this mesmerizing country.Finally, Bali where she meets again a toothless old medicine-man/palm reader. She copies some notes; she runs a short but effective charity fund; and she finds lust/love in the sad eyes of a Brazilian divorcee.

Again, if she hated cooking, she should have told him before getting married to him, such as, ""I hate cooking, so if you want a home-cooked meal, be prepared to do it yourself."" Cooking is a responsibility that can be shared as well, but she felt it necessary to divorce over that issue too.Then she decides everything is about her and what she wants, never mind what her husband wants.

Having a husband...another story.Before she splits for Europe, she shacks with a local actor-to-be, who encourages her to also check out a Mystic in India.

1319912,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0033AGJ5Y,"Promise ""promise""","[9, 17]","I was hesitant to see the film, knowing how Hollywood can take a good book and ruin it.  I was also dismayed at the choice of Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert.  Having read the book, I had a hard time imagining Roberts portraying the very intelligent, honest, and sincerely soul-searching Gilbert.  I can think of a number of finer actresses who would have been more convincing and perhaps contributed to a better film.However, it seems that the fault is not all with Roberts.  I think the director must have played a major role in diminishing the book.  Still, we have to thank him for bringing it to life.  It is, by the way, visually gorgeous.One of the major faults of the script is the way it didn't adequately show the depths of Gilbert's despair in the beginning.  It  actually portrayed her husband as a pleasant-enough guy which is contrary to the message in the book. The film almost makes it seem that she's leaving him just because he doesn't want to go to Aruba with her.  No wonder so many people who haven't read the book slam this character as empty, spoiled, whiney and selfish.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is her acute despair that propells her to make her amazing journey.About half way through the film, I overcame my dislike of Roberts.  It was, coincidently, in the India segment, about the time Gilbert began to face her own problems and discovered a new depth in herself.  Roberts rose to the occasion and showed the new maturity beautifully.  The scene where she offers her ""gift"" to the newlywed Indian girl is quite moving.Richard Jenkins is fun as the Texan she meets at the Ashram, although I did find his ""confession"" scene a little over-the-top.James Franco as the actor didn't really impress me either...maybe because he mumbled most of his lines, preferring a lot of loopy facial expressions to portray his ardor.The actors in Bali were good, especially the fellow who played the wise man.  He is almost worth the price of admission.  I agree with another reviewer that the interaction between Gilbert and Wayan, the medicine woman, was given short shrift.  But the importance of the Bali sequence was that this was where she found ""love.""  Bardem plays the charming Brazlian entrepreneur who overcomes her fear of love beautifully.  He's a little shaggy but that doesn't detract from his immense charm. He's perfect for the part--seems truly to be a man who is worth her attention, as opposed to the two she left behind.I thought the Amazon review was excellent except for the conclusion that the story was more escape than spiritual.  To me, this came across as a remarkable tale of a genuine spiritual voyage.  The fact that it has a happy ending shows that she did the hard work, faced her own inner demons and came out a better, happier person, more willing to love and to be loved. Doing this intense inner work is not self-indulgent or escapist; it's very hard and I commend Gilbert and anyone who endeavors to undertake it. It is hardly escapist.  I can only guess that people who haven't done this kind of inner jouney have no inkling of what they're missing.  Too bad...I hope this film helps some of them to wake up!Despite the flaws of the film, I give it five stars for it's theme.",5,In defense of Spiritual Journeys,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,3230,"['was', 'hesitant', 'see', 'film', 'knowing', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'take', 'good', 'book', 'ruin', 'was', 'also', 'dismayed', 'choice', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Liz', 'Gilbert', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'Roberts', 'portraying', 'very', 'intelligent', 'honest', 'sincerely', 'soul-searching', 'Gilbert', 'can', 'think', 'number', 'finer', 'actresses', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing', 'perhaps', 'contributed', 'better', 'film.However', 'fault', 'not', 'Roberts', 'think', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'diminishing', 'book', 'Still', 'have', 'thank', 'bringing', 'life', 'way', 'visually', 'gorgeous.One', 'major', 'faults', 'script', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'adequately', 'show', 'depths', 'Gilbert', 'despair', 'beginning', 'actually', 'portrayed', 'husband', 'pleasant-enough', 'guy', 'contrary', 'message', 'book', 'film', 'almost', 'seem', 'leaving', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'Aruba', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'slam', 'character', 'empty', 'spoiled', 'whiney', 'selfish', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'acute', 'despair', 'make', 'amazing', 'journey.About', 'half', 'way', 'film', 'overcame', 'dislike', 'Roberts', 'was', 'coincidently', 'India', 'segment', 'time', 'Gilbert', 'began', 'face', 'own', 'problems', 'discovered', 'new', 'depth', 'Roberts', 'rose', 'occasion', 'showed', 'new', 'maturity', 'beautifully', 'scene', 'where', 'gift', 'newlywed', 'Indian', 'girl', 'quite', 'moving.Richard', 'Jenkins', 'fun', 'Texan', 'Ashram', 'did', 'find', 'confession', 'scene', 'little', 'over-the-top.James', 'Franco', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'impress', 'maybe', 'mumbled', 'most', 'lines', 'preferring', 'lot', 'loopy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'portray', 'ardor.The', 'actors', 'Bali', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'fellow', 'who', 'played', 'wise', 'man', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'interaction', 'Gilbert', 'Wayan', 'medicine', 'woman', 'was', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'importance', 'Bali', 'sequence', 'was', 'was', 'where', 'found', 'love', 'Bardem', 'charming', 'Brazlian', 'entrepreneur', 'who', 'fear', 'love', 'beautifully', 'little', 'shaggy', ""n't"", 'detract', 'immense', 'charm', 'perfect', 'part', 'truly', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'attention', 'opposed', 'two', 'left', 'behind.I', 'thought', 'Amazon', 'review', 'was', 'excellent', 'conclusion', 'story', 'was', 'more', 'escape', 'spiritual', 'came', 'remarkable', 'tale', 'genuine', 'spiritual', 'voyage', 'fact', 'happy', 'ending', 'shows', 'did', 'hard', 'work', 'faced', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'came', 'out', 'better', 'happier', 'person', 'more', 'willing', 'love', 'be', 'loved', 'Doing', 'intense', 'inner', 'work', 'not', 'self-indulgent', 'escapist', 'very', 'hard', 'commend', 'Gilbert', 'anyone', 'who', 'undertake', 'hardly', 'escapist', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'kind', 'inner', 'jouney', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'Too', 'bad', 'hope', 'film', 'wake', 'up', 'flaws', 'film', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'theme']",Eat Pray Love

I could stomach about 10 minutes of her whining about how her privileged, upper-middle-class lifestyle just wasn't fulfilling her and how she had to give it up for a year to find herself. She had a good husband, she had a good job, she had a new home that she decorated just the way she wanted it, and yet, dang it all, it just wasn't quite enough. Why is that? Why is that? Ah, yes. Because she's selfish. And how cool is it that her lifestyle afforded her the luxury of finding herself during a year of travel to exotic places. Why, we all should do it. What the heck are we waiting for?I can recall that at the end of this ""Oprah,"" Liz was telling us that we can all have our own ""Eat Pray Love"" moment, even if it's just a ten-minute break in a quiet corner of our bedroom, away from the chaos of the kids, work, husband, and the bills. I don't know about you, but taking a break while sitting for ten minutes in a friggin' chair with the door locked while my sticky-fingered kids are pounding on said door, wondering why Mommy locked herself in her room, isn't quite the same thing as taking a year off of my life to travel to three exotic places most of us can only read about. Maybe it is the same, because enlightened Liz says so and she seems to have all the answers.Julia Roberts, I believe, tried to make Liz appealing/relatable, but who can relate to a woman like this? I mean, who can walk away from her marriage because her husband's, what, simply a nice guy with not enough ambition to satisfy her needs? Who can relate to a person who has the luxury of dropping out of life for a year to travel to Italy, India, and Bali? Who can relate to a woman who turns down a guy like James Franco (I know he was supposed to be a younger man, but I found Franco and Roberts to be a way awkward couple) or Javier Bardem (come on now).And what is it that makes Eastern religions so much more mystical and alluring to people looking to ""find themselves"" than, say, Christianity or Judaism? (I guess calling it ""meditating"" instead of ""praying"" is the key.)Well, there are some pluses to this film. The cinematography of Italy is a big plus. (India apparently is too harsh a reality to photograph much of, so all we see are interior shots and an occasional cow near a squatting boy--I guess this is supposed to symbolize the country's poverty, which is ignored throughout the film.) And the film is good for a two-hour escape from reality, because, after all, escapism is what it's all about.",1,"Eat (till your jeans don't fit), Pray (but call it the more exotic ""meditating""), Love (yourself)",1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,2610,"['remember', 'turning', 'Oprah', 'when', 'Liz', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'discussing', 'book', 'version', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'could', 'stomach', '10', 'minutes', 'whining', 'how', 'privileged', 'upper-middle-class', 'lifestyle', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fulfilling', 'how', 'had', 'give', 'up', 'year', 'find', 'had', 'good', 'husband', 'had', 'good', 'job', 'had', 'new', 'home', 'decorated', 'just', 'way', 'wanted', 'yet', 'dang', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'Why', 'Why', 'Ah', 'yes', 'selfish', 'how', 'cool', 'lifestyle', 'afforded', 'luxury', 'finding', 'year', 'travel', 'exotic', 'places', 'Why', 'should', 'do', 'What', 'heck', 'are', 'waiting', 'can', 'recall', 'end', 'Oprah', 'Liz', 'was', 'telling', 'can', 'have', 'own', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'moment', 'even', 'just', 'ten-minute', 'break', 'quiet', 'corner', 'bedroom', 'away', 'chaos', 'kids', 'work', 'husband', 'bills', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'taking', 'break', 'sitting', 'ten', 'minutes', 'friggin', 'chair', 'door', 'locked', 'sticky-fingered', 'kids', 'are', 'pounding', 'said', 'door', 'wondering', 'why', 'Mommy', 'locked', 'room', ""n't"", 'quite', 'same', 'thing', 'taking', 'year', 'life', 'travel', 'three', 'exotic', 'places', 'most', 'can', 'only', 'read', 'Maybe', 'same', 'enlightened', 'Liz', 'so', 'have', 'answers.Julia', 'Roberts', 'believe', 'tried', 'make', 'Liz', 'appealing/relatable', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'woman', 'mean', 'who', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'marriage', 'husband', 'what', 'simply', 'nice', 'guy', 'not', 'enough', 'ambition', 'satisfy', 'needs', 'Who', 'can', 'relate', 'person', 'who', 'luxury', 'dropping', 'life', 'year', 'travel', 'Italy', 'India', 'Bali', 'Who', 'can', 'relate', 'woman', 'who', 'down', 'guy', 'James', 'Franco', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'younger', 'man', 'found', 'Franco', 'Roberts', 'be', 'way', 'awkward', 'couple', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'come', 'now', '.And', 'what', 'Eastern', 'religions', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mystical', 'alluring', 'people', 'looking', 'find', 'say', 'Christianity', 'Judaism', 'guess', 'calling', 'meditating', 'instead', 'praying', 'key', 'Well', 'are', 'pluses', 'film', 'cinematography', 'Italy', 'big', 'plus', 'India', 'apparently', 'too', 'harsh', 'reality', 'photograph', 'much', 'see', 'are', 'interior', 'shots', 'occasional', 'cow', 'squatting', 'boy', 'guess', 'supposed', 'symbolize', 'country', 'poverty', 'ignored', 'film', 'film', 'good', 'two-hour', 'escape', 'reality', 'escapism', 'what']",Eat Pray Love

Don't expect anything too deep. The writers expected viewers to have read the books and so they don't give us much information as to what exactly causes her to feel such a lack of passion in the first place. Italy (Eat) provides a tourist's dream: good food, good friends, and basically the overall message of living a life of pleasure. India (Pray) is the more serious and the more interesting story here is not about Liz but of the Texan and young Indian girl we see in the movie. The message is meditation and learning to clear the mind. Bali (Love) is where it comes full circle so to speak. She learns that she is finally ready to love again. Once you love yourself, you can be free to dive into the chaos of loving someone else. The messages presented in the movie are things everyone already has heard which is why some other reviewers call it ""shallow"" which I can understand. The acting is so great that they bring more character to the screen than what the script gave them [excluding the husband and the actor, the script gave those characters no hope]. I picked Eat Pray Love so that I could watch someone do what I have always wanted...to go to a foreign place and immerse myself fully into the culture and learn some kind of lessons that could be applied in my everyday life.

1319935,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0033AGJ5Y,Spider Monkey,"[0, 0]","`Eat, Pray, Love' is an average film with a decent message and as I haven't read the book I can only review this film based on it's own merits, rather than comparing it to the message the book imparts.This film follows Liz (Julia Roberts) after she divorces her husband and travels to Italy, India and Bali as she tries to find some meaning in her life.  She learns about herself, makes some friends and has some amazing experiences, like travel will often do for anyone.I hate to say it, but this film is overly sentimental and whilst the basic message is a good one (being true to yourself and finding god within you) this film feels like it has to spell it out for you as if you are stupid and can't grasp the message being rammed down your throat at every turn.  This may sound harsh and I don't mean it to, as this is perfectly watchable and entertaining, but I don't know why film makers feel the need to dumb things down to such a degree that they almost insult the viewers intelligence.  The `meaningful' voice-overs spelling things out particularly started to grate by the end of the film.Roberts is pretty average in this film and Bardem is probably the best of the actors here.  Saying that, Richard Jenkins is very good as well and deserves a mention.  The direction is ok and is certainly very glossy and shows the countries off to spectacular effect (like a glorified tourist advert for each destination), but it lacks a certain depth and, like the film in general, it feels rather superficial.Don't get me wrong, this film is good enough and certainly has something to offer, but it has no nuance and isn't as `deep' as it likes to think it is.  The book may be a whole lot better, but judging this is on it's own merits I'd say this is a good but not great film and it is worth a watch; just don't expect too much and you should be fine.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",3,"Eat, Pray, Love",1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,1922,"['Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'average', 'film', 'decent', 'message', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'can', 'only', 'review', 'film', 'based', 'own', 'merits', 'rather', 'comparing', 'message', 'book', 'imparts.This', 'film', 'Liz', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'husband', 'travels', 'Italy', 'India', 'Bali', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'friends', 'amazing', 'experiences', 'travel', 'will', 'often', 'do', 'anyone.I', 'hate', 'say', 'film', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'basic', 'message', 'good', 'one', 'being', 'true', 'finding', 'god', 'film', 'feels', 'spell', 'out', 'are', 'stupid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'message', 'being', 'rammed', 'throat', 'turn', 'may', 'sound', 'harsh', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'perfectly', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'film', 'makers', 'feel', 'need', 'dumb', 'things', 'down', 'such', 'degree', 'almost', 'insult', 'viewers', 'intelligence', 'meaningful', 'voice-overs', 'spelling', 'things', 'out', 'particularly', 'started', 'grate', 'end', 'film.Roberts', 'pretty', 'average', 'film', 'Bardem', 'probably', 'best', 'actors', 'here', 'Saying', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'mention', 'direction', 'ok', 'certainly', 'very', 'glossy', 'countries', 'spectacular', 'effect', 'glorified', 'tourist', 'advert', 'destination', 'certain', 'depth', 'film', 'general', 'rather', 'superficial.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'certainly', 'something', 'offer', 'nuance', ""n't"", 'deep', 'think', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'judging', 'own', 'merits', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'fine.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",Eat Pray Love

I think there was great effort by the director to make you feel like you're there too.It doesn't matter that I read the book. This movie leaves far too much of the relationships to the imagination. Especially the two most important relationships of the main character, Liz. First we discover that Liz is unhappy in her marriage, but we're not exactly sure why. The dialogue makes an effort to try to fill us in... but we've arrived at the very end of the marriage and aren't privy to the WHY.What kinda bothers me about the character, Liz, is that she jumps right into another relationship while going through her divorce, but this time we see it through from beginning to end and STILL aren't privy to the ""fights"" they later discuss when breaking up.Do not read further if you don't want the story ruined...Liz's next relationship evolves the same way ... but there's no chemistry that I can see - although they seem to pretend there is - here it really seems like acting. The Brazilian boyfriend seems too course for her... he seems just WRONG... that's not to say I haven't seen this actor in other movies and thought he was fantastic... it's just that with Julia Roberts it doesn't work. But apparently as the movie ends, he's ""the one"". After less than a year in which she broke up her marriage, ended her interim relationship, she has found Mr. IT?

A memoir is full of inner monologue, emotion, endless stories that take place over a great amount of time and it's all told in a first person narrative. A screenplay has to be short, concise, pure dialogue and contain very little obvious emotion (thats for the actors to interpret). So when a memoir is chosen to be adapted into a feature film it's quite the challenge. You have to stay true to the events and the person telling them but you also have to work within the constraints that a feature film demands. This is what writer/director Ryan Murphy (Running with Scissors, TV's ""Glee"") was faced with on his film Eat, Pray, Love.Elizabeth Gilbert's classic memoir of self discovery, spirituality and love by traveling to Italy, India and Bali is a wonderful book full of wit, wisdom and meaning that can be appreciated by anyone; though only about 2/3s of that is translated to film. In any adaptation, whether it be novel, comic or memoir, there is one thing that I personally want to see faithfully portrayed: the themes (think Marry Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho). Of course there are going to be adjustments to the narrative and characters due to the difference of artistic mediums, but thankfully Murphy pulls it off with his film. He is able to find the right balance of addition and subtraction to properly honor the source material yet also create a satisfying stand alone film.The film beings with Liz (Julia Roberts, Erin Brockovich) struggling with her unfulfilled life and loveless marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup, Watchmen). Divorce proceeds and so does a rocky rebound relationship with David (James Franco, Milk). Living an aimless life without passion and against the better judgment of her best friend Delia (Viola Davis, Doubt), Liz embarks on a round the world journey to reconnect with pleasure (eat), her spirituality (pray) and self esteem (love). Along the way she meets many 'the wise stranger' (Richard Jenkins, The Visitor; Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men) and visits some of the most beautiful places on earth.Sure, this may sound like a seriously sappy and contrived film, but in all honesty, it's not. Murphy never lets the film dip into melodrama and handles his story with a smooth, confident hand. While he could have taken some of the more edgier parts of the book (ex: Liz's severe depression) to the screen, the movie ends up being cleaner and crisper and all the more fun without it. The picture is meant to inspire the audience to have fun, to connect and to live life, if the darker issues were included the message could have missed the mark. Murphy accomplishes this sense of euphoria visually and ascetically with the help of master cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds). The shots of Italy, India, Bali, and heck, even New York, are so georgous that if you can't afford to take a vacation this year, a ticket to Eat, Pray, Love will do the trick.What ties the film together is, of course, the luminous Roberts. She is, of course, a bon a fide movie star and this material is something that she can easily use to showcase her talents. She is backed by a terrific and believable supporting cast of Hollywood stars and native Italians, Indians and Balinese actors- all equally great.Eat, Pray, Love may not be a groundbreaking motion picture, but it's certainly a film that is enjoyable. It engages you emotionally and to me, that is the first and most important thing I look for in any film. It might not be the most faithful adaptation fans of the book were hoping for (and how could it have been?), but on it's own it's a picture with an easy charm and it's a harmless way to spend two and a half hours.Rating: B",4,A faithful adaptation of a beloved memoir,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,3954,"['Title', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'LoveDirector', 'Ryan', 'MurphyWriter', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'Jennifer', 'SaltCast', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'James', 'Franco', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Tuva', 'NovotnyYear', '2010A', 'memoir', 'exact', 'opposite', 'screenplay', 'memoir', 'full', 'inner', 'monologue', 'emotion', 'endless', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'great', 'amount', 'time', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'screenplay', 'be', 'short', 'concise', 'pure', 'dialogue', 'contain', 'very', 'little', 'obvious', 'emotion', 'thats', 'actors', 'interpret', 'So', 'when', 'memoir', 'chosen', 'be', 'adapted', 'feature', 'film', 'quite', 'challenge', 'have', 'stay', 'true', 'events', 'person', 'telling', 'also', 'have', 'work', 'constraints', 'feature', 'film', 'demands', 'what', 'writer/director', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'Running', 'Scissors', 'TV', 'Glee', 'was', 'faced', 'film', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love.Elizabeth', 'Gilbert', 'classic', 'memoir', 'self', 'discovery', 'spirituality', 'love', 'traveling', 'Italy', 'India', 'Bali', 'wonderful', 'book', 'full', 'wit', 'wisdom', 'meaning', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'anyone', 'only', '2/3s', 'translated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'be', 'novel', 'comic', 'memoir', 'one', 'thing', 'personally', 'want', 'see', 'faithfully', 'portrayed', 'themes', 'think', 'Marry', 'Harron', 'adaptation', 'Bret', 'Easton', 'Ellis', 'American', 'Psycho', 'course', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'adjustments', 'narrative', 'characters', 'due', 'difference', 'artistic', 'mediums', 'thankfully', 'Murphy', 'off', 'film', 'able', 'find', 'right', 'balance', 'addition', 'subtraction', 'properly', 'honor', 'source', 'material', 'yet', 'also', 'create', 'satisfying', 'stand', 'alone', 'film.The', 'film', 'beings', 'Liz', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'struggling', 'unfulfilled', 'life', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'Stephen', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Watchmen', 'Divorce', 'proceeds', 'so', 'rocky', 'rebound', 'relationship', 'David', 'James', 'Franco', 'Milk', 'Living', 'aimless', 'life', 'passion', 'better', 'judgment', 'best', 'friend', 'Delia', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Doubt', 'Liz', 'round', 'world', 'journey', 'reconnect', 'pleasure', 'eat', 'spirituality', 'pray', 'esteem', 'love', 'way', 'many', 'wise', 'stranger', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'Visitor', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'earth.Sure', 'may', 'sound', 'seriously', 'sappy', 'contrived', 'film', 'honesty', 'not', 'Murphy', 'never', 'film', 'dip', 'melodrama', 'story', 'smooth', 'confident', 'hand', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'more', 'edgier', 'parts', 'book', 'ex', 'Liz', 'severe', 'depression', 'screen', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'cleaner', 'crisper', 'more', 'fun', 'picture', 'meant', 'inspire', 'audience', 'have', 'fun', 'connect', 'live', 'life', 'darker', 'issues', 'were', 'included', 'message', 'could', 'have', 'missed', 'mark', 'Murphy', 'sense', 'euphoria', 'visually', 'ascetically', 'help', 'master', 'cinematographer', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'shots', 'Italy', 'India', 'Bali', 'heck', 'even', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'so', 'georgous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'take', 'vacation', 'year', 'ticket', 'Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'will', 'do', 'trick.What', 'film', 'together', 'course', 'luminous', 'Roberts', 'course', 'bon', 'fide', 'movie', 'star', 'material', 'something', 'can', 'easily', 'use', 'showcase', 'talents', 'backed', 'terrific', 'believable', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'native', 'Italians', 'Indians', 'Balinese', 'actors-', 'equally', 'great.Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'groundbreaking', 'motion', 'picture', 'certainly', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'emotionally', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'look', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'fans', 'book', 'were', 'hoping', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'own', 'picture', 'easy', 'charm', 'harmless', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'half', 'hours.Rating', 'B']",Eat Pray Love

1319946,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B0033AGJ5Y,taaj,"[2, 2]","Eat, Pray, Love is a true story about a writer who leaves her husband because she's overcome with the feeling that her life doesn't fit and isn't a real reflection of herself. She seeks escape in a younger man, doesn't find it, then decides that she may have better luck by doing a yearlong adventure in Italy, India, and Indonesia. Through those adventures she finds love and happiness again.I have mixed feelings about the movie. I read the book and felt it was a self-indulgent pity party. I didn't expect much from the movie, but wanted to give it a chance.CONS:Julia Roberts is horrible. I am not a Roberts fan, but seeing her in this was agony. I am so over her. She can't act. Period. She is the same in everything. Was this Erin Brockovich Goes to Italy or Julianne Porter (from My Best Friend's Wedding) Shacks Up? She looked depressed most of the time. When she lit up, it was a huge contrast, but that rarely happened. The only way I knew that she had transformed into a happy person was when the Balinese man (Ketut) said so.The pace was REALLY fast. I knew that there had to be a lot left out in order to cover adventures in three countries and give it a set up as well, but this was lightning speed. It didn't give a chance to really get the flavor of each location or how she was changed by the experiences there. We are just given dialog that tells us what happened. The segues from place to place were abrupt too.The ah ha! moments didn't translate to film. The first one was, ""Go to bed, Liz."" That wasn't illuminating to me in the book either, but I could see how she thought it was. In the film, it was as if God was not listening to her. All of the big turning points in the book were lost in the movie.It's unrelatable. It feels like a fantasy. ""Normal"" people just don't cry over nothing, run off for a year, forget all their friends, and come back happy. I think that is the big message of the movie and that falls flat...unless that is your fantasy.PROS:Despite all I just said, I actually ""got"" that her inner/outer journey was transformative. Maybe that was because I read the book. Maybe it's because I lead sacred travel tours and have experienced that same growth myself. Some of the things that may have seemed trite and New Age resonated with me. (Maybe because I'm trite and New Age? lol)The scenery was the big winner. As a world traveler myself, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE seeing new places. The locations weren't just shot as background. They were characters in the movie! That was very effectively done. Of the three locations, I have only been to Rome, but it IS everything you see and more!I hate when people can't review a product for what it is instead of comparing it to the book because often, I haven't read the book. Sorry for doing that to you. If you haven't read the book and are wondering whether to try it out, my advice is, if you like Roberts, the Hollywood formula and exotic locales, you will probably like it. If you want meaning, logic and good acting, forget it. :)",3,Mixed Feelings,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,3014,"['Eat', 'Pray', 'Love', 'true', 'story', 'writer', 'who', 'husband', 'overcome', 'feeling', 'life', ""n't"", 'fit', ""n't"", 'real', 'reflection', 'herself', 'escape', 'younger', 'man', ""n't"", 'find', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'better', 'luck', 'doing', 'yearlong', 'adventure', 'Italy', 'India', 'Indonesia', 'adventures', 'love', 'happiness', 'again.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'felt', 'was', 'self-indulgent', 'pity', 'party', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'wanted', 'give', 'chance.CONS', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'horrible', 'am', 'not', 'Roberts', 'fan', 'seeing', 'was', 'agony', 'am', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Period', 'same', 'everything', 'Was', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'Goes', 'Italy', 'Julianne', 'Porter', 'My', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Up', 'looked', 'depressed', 'most', 'time', 'When', 'lit', 'up', 'was', 'huge', 'contrast', 'rarely', 'happened', 'only', 'way', 'knew', 'had', 'transformed', 'happy', 'person', 'was', 'when', 'Balinese', 'man', 'Ketut', 'said', 'so.The', 'pace', 'was', 'REALLY', 'fast', 'knew', 'had', 'be', 'lot', 'left', 'out', 'order', 'cover', 'adventures', 'three', 'countries', 'give', 'set', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'lightning', 'speed', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'chance', 'really', 'get', 'flavor', 'location', 'how', 'was', 'changed', 'experiences', 'there', 'are', 'just', 'given', 'dialog', 'what', 'happened', 'segues', 'place', 'place', 'were', 'abrupt', 'too.The', 'ah', 'ha', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'film', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'Go', 'bed', 'Liz', 'was', ""n't"", 'illuminating', 'book', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'thought', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'God', 'was', 'not', 'listening', 'big', 'turning', 'points', 'book', 'were', 'lost', 'movie.It', 'unrelatable', 'fantasy', 'Normal', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'nothing', 'run', 'off', 'year', 'forget', 'friends', 'come', 'back', 'happy', 'think', 'big', 'message', 'movie', 'flat', 'fantasy.PROS', 'just', 'said', 'actually', 'got', 'inner/outer', 'journey', 'was', 'transformative', 'Maybe', 'was', 'read', 'book', 'lead', 'sacred', 'travel', 'tours', 'have', 'experienced', 'same', 'growth', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'trite', 'New', 'Age', 'resonated', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'trite', 'New', 'Age', 'lol', 'scenery', 'was', 'big', 'winner', 'world', 'traveler', 'LOVE', 'LOVE', 'LOVE', 'seeing', 'new', 'places', 'locations', 'were', ""n't"", 'just', 'shot', 'background', 'were', 'characters', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'effectively', 'done', 'three', 'locations', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'Rome', 'everything', 'see', 'more', 'hate', 'when', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'review', 'product', 'what', 'instead', 'comparing', 'book', 'often', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'Sorry', 'doing', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'are', 'wondering', 'try', 'out', 'advice', 'like', 'Roberts', 'Hollywood', 'formula', 'exotic', 'locales', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'meaning', 'logic', 'good', 'acting', 'forget']",Eat Pray Love

I hope this new/edited review at least helps people stop and think.]You've probably read the raves about the scenery and food. Yes, they're great. And probably seen that Julia did what she could with this role. Again that's true. Also that she plays a main character who leaves her life behind to find herself. At least, that's what the movie is supposed to be.But all I saw was that Liz had a great life, but thinks that friends, family, and relationships are disposable. Financial security is something to be discarded on a whim. Just go ahead and throw everything away, then focus on yourself, yourself, yourself.Everyone else in this movie had it harder than Liz did. Her husband was willing to talk things over with her, but she refused. Then she dove straight into the arms of another man, dumping him too when she didn't feel fulfilled enough. All around the world, Liz found people whose lives were more difficult than hers. Did it give her pause to think?Nope. All Liz learned is that she needs to be nicer to herself, to find people who make her happy, and that she can love others and herself at the same time. *gasp*After finding this revelation, does Liz make any effort to repair the trail of shattered relationships she left behind? Does she realize that all relationships take work, maintenance, and tender loving care?Nope. Instead, Liz just rides off into the sunset, finally knowing who she is and what she wants. Keep looking for your identity until you discover who you are. Then live happily ever after, as if relationships either work or they don't, like some kind of childhood fairy tale.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------But wait! This is supposed to be an inspirational movie! A movie that shows a brave woman's journey as she travels around the world determined to find herself. Ok, great, I get that.Now picture a MAN in this role. A MAN who divorces his rich wife and leaves all his friends because he isn't satisfied and doesn't know who he is anymore. A MAN who goes from woman to woman, feeling unloved by any of them.A MAN traveling around the world, eating until he bursts out of his clothes. A MAN learning to be nicer to himself. A MAN caring only about himself, until he realizes he can love others and himself, and then finally lets himself fall in love again.Is this STILL a beautiful movie?",1,This film is proof that many people are still sexist.,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,2487,"['[', 'NOTE', 'drastically', 'edited', 'review', 'essence', 'line', 'addition', 'hope', 'new/edited', 'review', 'least', 'helps', 'people', 'stop', 'think', ']', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'read', 'raves', 'scenery', 'food', 'Yes', ""'re"", 'great', 'probably', 'seen', 'Julia', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'role', 'Again', 'true', 'Also', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'life', 'find', 'least', 'what', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be.But', 'saw', 'was', 'Liz', 'had', 'great', 'life', 'friends', 'family', 'relationships', 'are', 'disposable', 'Financial', 'security', 'something', 'be', 'discarded', 'whim', 'Just', 'go', 'ahead', 'throw', 'everything', 'away', 'then', 'focus', 'yourself.Everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'had', 'harder', 'Liz', 'did', 'husband', 'was', 'willing', 'talk', 'things', 'refused', 'Then', 'dove', 'straight', 'arms', 'man', 'dumping', 'too', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'enough', 'world', 'Liz', 'found', 'people', 'lives', 'were', 'more', 'difficult', 'hers', 'Did', 'give', 'pause', 'think', 'Nope', 'Liz', 'learned', 'be', 'nicer', 'herself', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'happy', 'can', 'love', 'others', 'same', 'time', '*gasp*After', 'finding', 'revelation', 'Liz', 'make', 'effort', 'repair', 'trail', 'shattered', 'relationships', 'left', 'behind', 'realize', 'relationships', 'take', 'work', 'maintenance', 'tender', 'loving', 'care', 'Nope', 'Instead', 'Liz', 'just', 'rides', 'off', 'sunset', 'finally', 'knowing', 'who', 'what', 'Keep', 'looking', 'identity', 'discover', 'who', 'are', 'Then', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'relationships', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'kind', 'childhood', 'fairy', 'tale.', 'wait', 'supposed', 'be', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'movie', 'brave', 'woman', 'journey', 'world', 'determined', 'find', 'Ok', 'great', 'get', 'that.Now', 'picture', 'MAN', 'role', 'MAN', 'who', 'rich', 'wife', 'friends', ""n't"", 'satisfied', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'anymore', 'A', 'MAN', 'who', 'woman', 'woman', 'feeling', 'unloved', 'them.A', 'MAN', 'traveling', 'world', 'eating', 'clothes', 'MAN', 'learning', 'be', 'nicer', 'MAN', 'caring', 'only', 'can', 'love', 'others', 'then', 'finally', 'fall', 'love', 'again.Is', 'beautiful', 'movie']",Eat Pray Love

So, in order to find herself, she goes looking in places she's never been.The 'Eat' part of the story take place in Rome, where Liz discovers the wonder of 'dolce far niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. Except that it's not nothing, it's full involvement in the little things of each moment, and in turning the biological demand for fuel into a kind of making love. The mouth-watering, full-screen shots of pasta, melon, turkey, and more show just what there is to love, including a drumstick moment that approaches the one inTom Jonesfor sensuality. (In truth, this segment of the movie made me ashamed of the bland drink and stale popcorn I had inflicted on myself at the theater's concession stand.)Since I'm not in the ""chick flick"" demographic, the next two passages didn't do so much for me. Liz's next stop was India, where I hoped the culinary passion would play out among the complex flavors of India's cuisines. Although Liz brought a healthy appetite with her, the 'Eat', 'Pray', and 'Love' segments of the movie didn't overlap, and India marked the transition from 'Eat' to 'Pray'. As in any good spiritual journey, Liz encoutered new teachers during this phase, and not the ones she had expected. For reasons known only to Liz, the time in India came to its end, and she moved on to Bali and 'Love'. I was happy to see that 'Love' took many forms, and not just the mandatory romance.I'm more of a guy movie kind of guy, but I see my wife's movies almost as often as she sees mine. As estrogenic cinema goes, my taste tolerated this one quite well - but I'd come back to the 'Eat' portion of the movie any time.

It was exactly what I needed when it first came out, and it still is.Ignore the bad reviews; people judge things they don't understand. This is not a romantic comedy, so while it can be funny and romantic, that is not its purpose. It's the hero's journey from myth, but with a female hero.Nonattachment and choosing your own thoughts, subjects covered during her trip to India, are the key to happiness and are being taught in every spiritual discipline. Nonattachment is what spiritual teachers are teaching students right now. It's ironic in the best way that the attachment she ultimately had a hardest time giving up was her new dedication to nonattachment! She was terrified of wanting something again, and making a commitment.She is not selfish for choosing the life she wants. As women we're taught that we're bad people if we don't dance to everyone else's tune. I thought it was the bolder choice doing what they did, maintaining the first husband's personality from the book, and making him not a bad guy. It was no one's fault, it just wasn't working.I've been in her position, praying for something, anything, a way up off the floor. And education is almost always the answer. Yes, the fact that the character seemed to have a lot of money made her trips a lot easier but that's not a reason to be completely prejudiced against her. Starting with physical indulgence in Rome, exploring the power of pleasure, then turning completely spartan in India and concentrating only on the spirit, she had to find out if it was possible to do both -- to live in the modern world, enjoy herself, and maintain the spiritual life she needed. She got both, and the right man, in Bali.This movie is perfect for anyone having hard times, someone exploring spirituality, especially meditation, Eastern religions, or simply anyone who really wants to travel.
