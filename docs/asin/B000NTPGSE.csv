1060553,A3I9KRHK7DDG31,B000NTPGSE,msmar,"[1, 1]","I'll admitt that I'm a David Tennant fan. That's what drew me to this marvelous six-part series from the BBC. It's really a combination murder mystery/love triangle drama with some great acting from leads Tennant, Sarah Parish, and David Morrissey. Morrissey plays Ripley Holden, proprietor of an amusement arcade that he dreams of turning into a casino in Blackpool, Parish plays his wife Natalie, and Tennant plays DI Peter Carlisle. Musical numbers are used to further the plot several times per episode, with the actors singing along with the original recordings. I thought this was done very effectively. The songs are drawn from pop music ranging from the 1960s through today, from Elvis Presley to Elvis Costello to The Clash. It originally aired on the BBC in 2004 and slightly shortened episodes aired on BBC America several years later. The six episodes are terrific. I agree with another reviewer that it's great for brightening my mood.I haven't watched Viva Blackpool yet, which was filmed several years later and is on the third disk. The cast is a bit different for that, as Tennant was already playing The Doctor on Doctor Who.I love this series enough that I purchased a region-free Toshiba DVD player from Amazon so I could watch it as well as other BBC titles that have not been released for the American market. I'm so glad I did! If you're a David Tennant fan, I highly recommend Single FatherSingle Father ( Single Father - Season 1 ) ( Single Father - Season One ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom] as well. As long as you've got the region-free DVD player...",5,Mystery and drama combined into a delicious treat,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,1604,"[""'ll"", 'admitt', ""'m"", 'David', 'Tennant', 'fan', 'what', 'drew', 'marvelous', 'six-part', 'series', 'BBC', 'really', 'combination', 'murder', 'mystery/love', 'triangle', 'drama', 'great', 'acting', 'leads', 'Tennant', 'Sarah', 'Parish', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'Morrissey', 'Ripley', 'Holden', 'proprietor', 'amusement', 'arcade', 'turning', 'casino', 'Blackpool', 'Parish', 'wife', 'Natalie', 'Tennant', 'DI', 'Peter', 'Carlisle', 'Musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'used', 'further', 'plot', 'several', 'times', 'episode', 'actors', 'singing', 'along', 'original', 'recordings', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'effectively', 'songs', 'are', 'drawn', 'pop', 'music', 'ranging', '1960s', 'today', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Elvis', 'Costello', 'Clash', 'originally', 'aired', 'BBC', '2004', 'slightly', 'shortened', 'episodes', 'aired', 'BBC', 'America', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'terrific', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'great', 'brightening', 'mood.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Viva', 'Blackpool', 'yet', 'was', 'filmed', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'third', 'disk', 'cast', 'bit', 'different', 'Tennant', 'was', 'already', 'playing', 'Doctor', 'Doctor', 'Who.I', 'love', 'series', 'purchased', 'region-free', 'Toshiba', 'DVD', 'player', 'Amazon', 'could', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'BBC', 'titles', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'released', 'American', 'market', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', ""'re"", 'David', 'Tennant', 'fan', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Single', 'FatherSingle', 'Father', 'Single', 'Father', 'Season', '1', 'Single', 'Father', 'Season', 'One', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.2.4', 'Import', 'United', 'Kingdom', ']', 'as', 'well', 'As', 'long', ""'ve"", 'got', 'region-free', 'DVD', 'player']",Blackpool / Viva Blackpool
1060554,A188WBZZMNHMZ4,B000NTPGSE,tiggrie AKA Sarah,"[4, 4]","Disclaimer: I haven't seen the follow up - my review is of the original series.TV drama at its best, and clever into the bargain.I only rented this because I wasn't sure, from what I had read, what I would make of it.Now I've added it to my wishlist!It's a bit of an odd concept - gritty northern drama meets musical meets murder investigation meets comedy - but it's very very well done, with a brilliant cast.Morrissey is, as someone else has said, born to play this role; sleazy but compelling, by halfway through the first episode I very much wanted to see how he would turn out. A performance that makes what could have been a bit of a one-trick-pony character into a complex and interesting man, for whom, in spite of everything, one still has compassion. An outstanding performance.Parish and Tennant are the heart of the drama, at turns heartbreaking, beautiful, and sexually charged.Tennant in particular shines as the disciplined policeman falling into potential corruption and having his life turned upside down. Fascinating performance to watch and impossible to take your eyes off him in so many scenes. Compelling.All the supporting cast are strong, down to workers at the amusement arcade, Ripley's family, the religious ""nut"" outside the front door (fantastic - better known as Filch in the Harry Potter movies but a brilliant cameo in this role) and, possibly a personal favourite, DCI Carlisle's (Tennant) sidekick Blythe.Impeccable.
