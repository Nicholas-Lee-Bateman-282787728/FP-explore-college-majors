195362,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,1890228583,Ace-of-Stars,"[3, 23]","*It's a rare anime feature that moves me to rate it with the lowest marks possible, but this one accomplished the once-thought impossible!The premise sounds intriguing enough: A girl left orphaned after the double homicide of her parents is taken in (in more ways than one) by a couple of psychos with vigilante desires who groom her to become their instrument of assassination. Their targets tend to be high-profile members of society & public figures who have a tendency to stay just enough out of reach of the law to prevent being legally apprehended and paying the necessary penalties for their criminal misdeeds (child sexual abuse and related activities being high on their list). But suspicion mounts that she may be just being manipulated like a puppet and that the people she's being instructed to kill (all men, of course) may not necessarily be everything she is being informed that they are.Unfortunately, the execution (no pun intended) of the story & action, the lack of character development, the limited (almost non-existent) background & motivational information on the girl's ""mentor(s)"", the totally contrived plot devices, and the highly & irritatingly irrational action sequences (extremely absurd even by typical ""anime"" standards) makes this feature-length OAV the biggest animation TURKEY I have ever had the privilege(?) of viewing. Even the (very lame) ""fan service"" scenes cannot make up for its lack of interesting story and action. (Apparently, this is not the true ""unrated"" version as indicated, since reviewers make references to more graphic & disturbing ""hentai"" scenes. Still doesn't change my opinion of the whole thing, however.) Okay, I'll admit that it scores a couple of minor points for its visuals & animation, but that's about the only thing of any material substance I can come away with from this loser. In essence, if anime features were rides at the carnival, ""KITE"" would be the merry-go-round -- without any accompanying lights or music.Normally, something clocking in at only 45 minutes would get a point for ""fair consideration"" from me because of the feature's not being given enough time to really allow an indepth story to unfold (e.g., ""PLASTIC LITTLE,"" which I actually like, despite its oversaturation of needless ""fan service"" which serves no purpose), but I give NO such consideration for ""KITE"" -- I believe that any additional amount of time given to this animated drama would have made it only that much worse than it already is.Not an outright ""zero-stars"" junker, but I cannot in all good conscience rate it anything higher than a ""one-and-a-half"" at best.",1,"OUCH!!! ...And I thought ""ARMITAGE III"" was bad!",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2620,"['*It', 'rare', 'anime', 'feature', 'rate', 'lowest', 'marks', 'possible', 'one', 'accomplished', 'once-thought', 'impossible', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'girl', 'left', 'orphaned', 'double', 'homicide', 'parents', 'taken', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'couple', 'psychos', 'vigilante', 'desires', 'who', 'groom', 'become', 'instrument', 'assassination', 'targets', 'tend', 'be', 'high-profile', 'members', 'society', 'public', 'figures', 'who', 'have', 'tendency', 'stay', 'just', 'enough', 'reach', 'law', 'prevent', 'being', 'legally', 'apprehended', 'paying', 'necessary', 'penalties', 'criminal', 'misdeeds', 'child', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'related', 'activities', 'being', 'high', 'list', 'suspicion', 'mounts', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'being', 'manipulated', 'puppet', 'people', 'being', 'instructed', 'kill', 'men', 'course', 'may', 'not', 'necessarily', 'be', 'everything', 'being', 'informed', 'are.Unfortunately', 'execution', 'pun', 'intended', 'story', 'action', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'limited', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'background', 'motivational', 'information', 'girl', 'mentor', 'totally', 'contrived', 'plot', 'devices', 'highly', 'irritatingly', 'irrational', 'action', 'sequences', 'extremely', 'absurd', 'even', 'typical', 'anime', 'standards', 'feature-length', 'OAV', 'biggest', 'animation', 'TURKEY', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'privilege', 'viewing', 'Even', 'very', 'lame', 'fan', 'service', 'scenes', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'interesting', 'story', 'action', 'Apparently', 'not', 'true', 'unrated', 'version', 'indicated', 'reviewers', 'make', 'references', 'more', 'graphic', 'disturbing', 'hentai', 'scenes', 'Still', ""n't"", 'change', 'opinion', 'whole', 'thing', 'however', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'couple', 'minor', 'points', 'visuals', 'animation', 'only', 'thing', 'material', 'substance', 'can', 'come', 'away', 'loser', 'essence', 'anime', 'features', 'were', 'rides', 'carnival', 'KITE', 'would', 'be', 'merry-go-round', 'accompanying', 'lights', 'music.Normally', 'something', 'clocking', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'would', 'get', 'point', 'fair', 'consideration', 'feature', 'not', 'being', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'allow', 'indepth', 'story', 'unfold', 'e.g.', 'PLASTIC', 'LITTLE', 'actually', 'oversaturation', 'needless', 'fan', 'service', 'purpose', 'give', 'such', 'consideration', 'KITE', 'believe', 'additional', 'amount', 'time', 'given', 'animated', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'only', 'that', 'much', 'worse', 'already', 'outright', 'zero-stars', 'junker', 'can', 'not', 'good', 'conscience', 'rate', 'anything', 'higher', 'one-and-a-half', 'best']",N/A

195367,AGO5LRUVQLH0Q,1890228583,A. Schneider,"[21, 24]","[Cut version]The cut version of this anime is decent... the plot is kind of interested, a molested girl, school girl by day killer at night with some kick butt action sequences and supurb animation.I suppose one of a few of the major flaws in the production would be the bad guys... they aren't really all that interesting; neither is the technological aspects of this assassin group, so much so they don't really earn the title of ""assassin"" group in my mind and instead seem like low budget killers. And yet Sawa defies this, she downright rocks as does Obari,The cut version of this film is interesting if you like films like The Professional and the like and is most certainly worth the rent - if you can get it for a decent price, it might just be worth buying as well (I found myself heavily enthralled with the concepts though the delivery, again, was poor especially with silly enemies... the story is really about the main characters).The rating I gave this film is for the uncut version because that is the version that was intended to be released - the cut version was meant for clean sales on sites like these selling anime movies as well as to the general (mature) public. The uncut is the film the way it was meant to be... for good or ill.[Uncut version]As I said earlier, the story is about the main characters and if you are going to appreciate Kite in all of its magnificent (or cruel) glory, then this is the version I must recommend you buy OVER the cut version.If you like Hentai you might be slightly disappointed to know that there isn't much sex in this film: however if you are more interested in a good story mixed with some sex scenes, this is perfect.Sure people complain left and right about the child molestation, but the truth is that theme is high in hardcore ecchi productions like Cool Devices and the like... so most people getting into the movie will likely be informed H-viewers who decided to see the film for similar reasons. I'm not agreeing or disagreeing that it's disgusting, but proper viewing of this film requires you to experience it with the molestation attached.Thankfully the ecchi level of the film isn't high - they are standard vaginal rape scenes with a bit of fellatio mixed in - of course they are scenes involve underage individuals. For those of you who do watch such films of the genre you'll know this isn't exactly ""ecchi high"" as far as Hentai goes, and here serves only to enhance the story... again, for good or bad (after all Princess 69 of the genre disturbingly features extremely young girls doing a myriad of disgusting things - believe me, for a film categorized in the same genre, this is a masterpiece as far as they are concerned).Upon watching the uncut version of the film (having some experience watching Hentai in the past), I was deeply impressed with the amount of story attached to the movie. Typically in these types of films you very rarely see a good story, or characters you can really love.The story is about a child who was taken from her mother and father, raped, and then forced into a life of an assassin (whereby she is raped repeatedly and seemingly cares little for it). As time passes she opens up to another character - Obari - and tells him how her philosophy is to live life for the moment and care little about the future (since of course has no control over her future... ironically as the vivid rape scenes depict, she has little control over the present either).There are a few things with this uncut version which annoyed me. Since most of the individuals purchasing the uncut version of the film wanted to purchase a Hentai film, Sawa is depicted at times as enjoying the sex... certainly in the beginning, that to me doesn't flow with the fact that she was being forced into living a life she couldn't control. However it does make some sense, she isn't smiling at all... in fact, she does very little smiling, she's simply letting it happen, moaning. To me, her passive enjoyment and lack of emotions throughout the first half of the movie (before she speaks with Obari) strikes me as sad: if it wasn't stressed to produce a Hentai film that Hentai fans would love so much, perhaps then would could have seen more of her emotions early on. Just a theory though.[General notes]The music throughout the film is superb - jazz music lights the mood as neither happy nor sad, and does well to (as strange as it may sound) set the film up for future viewing by generations to come (the music is timeless so to speak, good and timeless).The film is a good one, but it isn't great, again there could have been a lot more... I half hoped for the film to go on an extra hour so I could see Sawa slaughter a few more ""targets"" with her exploding gun. But in the end the film left on a rather unfinished note.One last pro was the fact that the movie, although leaving on an unfinished note, had the viewer emotionally hooked (especially in the uncut version) - without a solid chain of events within the story (such as better ""bad guy"" killings and the like), it came across as surprising how well the director established emotional bonds throughout the film.This film scores a 4/5 for having its main plot device (an assassin hired to kill individuals) only half developed in my opinion, more effort could have been made to make it more interesting.

First off, the plot is very questionable, this movie has got to be the first I've ever seen that deals with a lot of...'DEPTH'. There are still many things in this movie that I still don't understand:  What's the real reason that Akai wants Sawa to assasinate certain innocent people, why can Sawa just have the heart to decide not to kill those people and find a solution to that, and mainly, why Akai killed Sawa's parents?  There are many more questions unanswered, but I don't want to spoil it to the people, all I can say is that none of this makes sense, except for the fact that Akai is a perverted, child-raping nutcase! The animation and characters in this anime is good, but not at a same level as 'Ghost In The Shell', and everything else..just forget it!Overall...this is very hard to give the final result for 'Kite' uncensored.

I'm an adult so the gratuotis sex/rape scenes didn't really bother me.  It actually played a part in the movie so it wasn't neccessarily random and pointless that the makers included those scenes.  The action is decent and the Sawa reminds me of Matilda in the movie Leon: The Professional.  Clocking in at 60 minutes it was all so short.  if it was longer and more to it I would definately vote it 5 stars.  I'm glad it's part of my collection none the less.  The flashbacks help tell the story of the characters and allow the viewer to follw the movie easily.  I'm glad the ending left off like it did.  It's good to see that not all films end on a positive happy go lucky tip.  In a way it was a new beginning for Sawa which was a positive in itself.

However, the story and action are outstanding. Kite centers on a teenage girl who is brainwashed into assassinating targets of a dirty police detective, and when I say dirty I mean dirty in every sense of the word. This is hentai, or Japanese kink, with a plot.In a lot of ways, this film bares striking similarities to Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer. Both involve emotionally traumatized individuals being manipulated by those with dubious agendas. And both  have a lot of sex, which seems to be a trademark with Japanese filmmakers who don't have the hangups we do over here in America. Guess that's why I like Japanimation, hee, hee, hee.But I do want to stress that this is definitely not kid's stuff or suitable for a lot of grownups for that matter. Pretty touchy stuff here, including pedophilia. But the action is off the chain, in fact, better than what you'll see in most live action movies made on this side of the pond.

However, with four graphic sex scenes, it's clear that ""Kite"" would cause quite a stir among American audiences.But anime viewers can't look away--""Kite"" is a gripping story of a girl trying to escape the sexual grasp of her captors.The tale centers around Sawa, a girl packing both regular and explosive bullets in her pistol, as well as miniature time bombs. She's an assassin who kills people for the male police officers who ""adopted"" her. Actually, they killed her parents. And they keep her for their own sexual pleasure and to kill other wanted criminals.Sawa's world is frightening, portrayed by grotesque sex scenes, in which her captors rape her if she makes a single mistake. While American audiences understandably would want to censor it, ""Kite"" is one of those dark films that shouldn't be censored.Certainly, ""Kite"" can easily be seen as a no-holds-barred post-war depiction of the sexual prostitution and injustice which took place after World War II. The film is an even sharper criticism of sexual violence in general. Anime fans will be frightened as Sawa struggles to survive against some of the most dangerous bodyguards in one of her jobs. However, Sawa finds a way to liberate herself, even if only for a short moment.The final resolution is even more antagonistic--showing that Sawa is not the only female assassin under the control of masochistic officers.

So this series is not for the light hearted, considering theres alot of un-remorseful violence and other objectional material. In light of all this the DVD version and a VHS version (brought to the US by a company called MediaBlaster) have cut out a lot of stuff, mainly the acts of rape and the little girl scenes.  There is one US VHS version by Kittymedia (mediablaster's dirty subsidiary) that releases a version that contains everything except the little girlie scenes(due to the US's child porn laws).Anyhow, some people say this distracts from the creators original intent to build up the characters.  Thats a big load of whatever, this &quot;Movie/Series&quot; is only 45 minutes and moves at the speed of light.  Character development is a consideration if this thing would of been 2 hours long, but the fact remains you know enough about the characters to just understand how they feel and what the movies about.

In my opinion there is also a lot of character devepement. Sawa was young and terrified when her parents were killed. The detective guy raped her at this time when she was most vulnerable and took her in. We know he then trained her to be a killer but I believe the anime does a wonderful job explaining how she succumbed to it.It actually reminds me of that old South Park episode where the volcano erupted while Stan's uncle Jim was taking the kids hunting. When it was Stan's turn to shoot, he aimed at the rabbit and then was like, ""I don't want to kill the bunny"" and it escaped and everyone got angry. At the end he finally ends up killing something for the sake of being accepted even though it was against his nature.Sawa is the same. Her face is always sad and she doen't like what she is doing. She's young and impressionable and doesn't have the mental strenth and confidence to get away. This is why I find the story so touching. It's really very sad.Oh yeah and about the violence, Maybe it is a littleexcessive but I thought the fight seens were absolutely awesome. I mean, a lot of anime is violent with teh whole neon pink blood thing happening so what's the problem?The sex though is a bit extreme. In a way, it better explains Sawa's situation and how she came to be tied to that detective guy. She doesn't have the strength to fight it (mentally that is since it is sooo obvious she's a great assasin). If u're that offended by graphic sex (there is a lot) then just watch the edited version. I didn't think it was all that bad. Actually the sex was almost what probably what made so many women not like the movie so the edited version is better for us females.

What started with a script of Luc Besson's 'La Femme Nikita' ended up being one of the most uninspired and dumbest pieces of crap ever made. Halfway through, you can't help but think this conversation took place:--Writer: ""Uh, sir, to tell you the truth, I have no idea where I'm going with the script, and the plot so far has no redeeming value whatsoever.""Boss: ""Add sex scenes.""Writer: ""Maybe if I add some character development and--""Boss: ""SEX SCENES!!""--Sawa is just a regular cute Japanese teenage girl. (sounds original already, doesn't it?) The thing is, if it seems like she's coming on to you, she's probably getting ready to shoot you in the head with an exploding bullet. Don't feel bad, though, it's nothing personal. She and a male assasin named Oburi-- who English voice actors pronounce ""Ovary"" for some inexplicable reason (something I don't believe is a coincidence... I thought there was something strange about that guy)-- systematically kill people who their employer decides are evil.The voice acting is laughable at times in the English dub (""I like teeeeaaaa. Stroooooong greeeeeeeen teeeeeeaaa.""). Monotony and raspy voices is the game here, apperantly. The script is not awe-inspiring, either (""Impressive, my cute little assassin. Too bad you're going to die ugly.""). In fact, just about everything in this movie in subpar.The ending is the epitome of all copped-out (not to mention inane) movie endings. Just why the basketball girl does what she does at the end has actually caused me to lose sleep over trying to figure it out.

No doubt about it.But the storyline of the anime left me unsatisfied in many respects.For one thing, the main character Sawa is working as a vigilante assassin under Akai's command, but she doesn't like it. So my question is, why the heck doesn't she just quit??? I mean, considering the stuff she has to endure and the stuff she knows, I don't know what binds Sawa to Mr. Akai to do his bidding.Secondly, the anime seems heavily edited (i.e. censored). There are several occassions where the screen simply goes into a freeze-frame for several seconds (complete with the tell-tale screen jitter). Other reviewers here wrote that these cut scenes involve VERY explicit sex scenes, some involving Sawa. Since Sawa is a high-school girl (just look at her school uniform), not a college girl like the DVD says, cutting away those scenes probably meant cutting away &quot;graphic sex with a minor&quot; element, a definite no-no in American marketing point of view.So it's understandable, but I don't really like it. Perhaps those missing scenes would have shed a better light on Sawa's character. Maybe it'll have shown Sawa's submissive side to Akai, explaining my aforementioned question of &quot;why doesn't she just quit?&quot; Who knows.All in all, it's a nice anime. The animation quality is just mediocre, but the music is quite nice, and overall the anime has a nice &quot;feel&quot; to it. Many of the action sequences (and the violence therein) are utterly cool, and I loved the ending. Unexpected, but fitting.Being something of a purist myself, however, I can't help but wish that the totally uncut version was on the DVD.

195396,A342YXQN4DLHL3,1890228583,Yui Hongo,"[0, 0]","Most of the summaries that I have seen regarding this anime go something like this when talking about the main character; Sawa appears to be an attractive, innocent, and naivee college student on the surface but is a  cold-blooded killer.  So when I bought this tape I was expecting to see a  story about a professional assassin with the perfect cover.  This however  is not the case.  Sawa is by no stretch of the imagination any kind of  professional assassin.  She is instead an extremely lucky, clumsy amateur  assassin.  I say amateur because her technique is sloopy, she made several  stupid mistakes when it came to attempting to assassinate a target, and I  do not honestly believe that she had the kind of skills need to prevent the  sort of injuries that she recieved from her carelessness.  The mistakes  that she made was leaving traceable evidence, and letting her guard down  way to easy.  What kind of assassin is really that careless?  Maybe I  should really say a good assassin wouldn't be that careless.I was also  expecting Sawa to be one touch chick (like Angel from Angel Cop), but she  wasn't tough at all.  She was instead a naivee, dependent, sad, abused  little girl trapped inside of a woman's body.  I felt really sorry for her.  The other assassin that she met seemed to have a much better technique and  better skills.  But he also had his share of flaws, because just like Sawa  he was naivee, and let his guard down way too easy for someone in his  profession.  I hear that this movie has been cut.  I would like to see what  they took out just so I'd experience the anime the way that the creator had  intended.The action sequences weren't all that great, but then again  most Japanime action stuff involving guns (such as Cop stuff, assassin  stuff) can't even begin to touch live action American movies of the same  nature.  So I think that this is important to keep in mind when viewing  this.  Also one of the action sequences was so far beyond the realm of  believeablity that it takes away part of the seriousness needed in a film  of this nature.",3,Professional What?,957312000,"05 3, 2000",2000,2085,"['Most', 'summaries', 'have', 'seen', 'regarding', 'anime', 'go', 'something', 'when', 'talking', 'main', 'character', 'Sawa', 'be', 'attractive', 'innocent', 'naivee', 'college', 'student', 'surface', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'when', 'bought', 'tape', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'story', 'professional', 'assassin', 'perfect', 'cover', 'however', 'not', 'case', 'Sawa', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'kind', 'professional', 'assassin', 'instead', 'extremely', 'lucky', 'clumsy', 'amateur', 'assassin', 'say', 'amateur', 'technique', 'sloopy', 'made', 'several', 'stupid', 'mistakes', 'when', 'came', 'attempting', 'assassinate', 'target', 'do', 'not', 'honestly', 'believe', 'had', 'kind', 'skills', 'need', 'prevent', 'sort', 'injuries', 'recieved', 'carelessness', 'mistakes', 'made', 'was', 'leaving', 'traceable', 'evidence', 'letting', 'guard', 'down', 'way', 'easy', 'What', 'kind', 'assassin', 'really', 'careless', 'Maybe', 'should', 'really', 'say', 'good', 'assassin', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'careless.I', 'was', 'also', 'expecting', 'Sawa', 'be', 'one', 'touch', 'chick', 'Angel', 'Angel', 'Cop', 'was', ""n't"", 'tough', 'was', 'instead', 'naivee', 'dependent', 'sad', 'abused', 'little', 'girl', 'trapped', 'woman', 'body', 'felt', 'really', 'sorry', 'other', 'assassin', 'met', 'seemed', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'technique', 'better', 'skills', 'also', 'had', 'share', 'flaws', 'because', 'just', 'Sawa', 'was', 'naivee', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'someone', 'profession', 'hear', 'movie', 'been', 'cut', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'took', 'out', 'just', 'so', ""'d"", 'experience', 'anime', 'way', 'creator', 'had', 'intended.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'then', 'again', 'most', 'Japanime', 'action', 'stuff', 'involving', 'guns', 'such', 'Cop', 'stuff', 'assassin', 'stuff', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'touch', 'live', 'action', 'American', 'movies', 'same', 'nature', 'So', 'think', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'viewing', 'Also', 'one', 'action', 'sequences', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'realm', 'believeablity', 'away', 'part', 'seriousness', 'needed', 'film', 'nature']",N/A
