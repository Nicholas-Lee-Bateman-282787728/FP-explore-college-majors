504736,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00000IQCG,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Pedro Almodovar is one of those directors who has such a vivid sense of self in all of his features, and a rabid fan base that appreciates everything he touches.  I am becoming more and more acquainted with his work with each passing year, and while I stand on the fence with his collective body of work, there is no denying that he can weave a crazy tale like no one else.  His soap opera tendencies serve to either aid or hinder his films, depending on the narrative and his use of restraint, but at the end of the day when he gets it right he gets it VERY right.`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' is a moment when he got it very right.Thrusting us into the lives of multiple women, all contending with various issues regarding men, Almodovar paints a colorful and flourishing picture of bickering, pleading, plotting and reminiscing all with surging splashing of charm, wit and loads of soap!Pepa is an actress in love with a married man.  That married man has been separated from his wife for some time, and now he is walking out on Pepa.  When he leaves for holiday, Pepa assumes he has gone back to his wife, while his wife is certain that he is taking Pepa.  There is a third woman involved, yet neither is aware of her.  Then Pepa is introduced to her lover's son and his fianc&eacute; when they come by coincidentally to buy her place.  When Pepa's best friend shows up with her own set of man problems (this time involving the cops), Pepa's place is turned into a circus complete with drugged gazpacho and loaded guns.Almodovar doesn't hold back here, but the film really called for such lavish helpings of `over the top'.  It benefits from an outlandish atmosphere because the narrative is just that farfetched.  It thrives.  The cast is uniformly great, with Carmen Maura and Julieta Serrano taking `best in show' notices from me.If you are new to the world of Almodovar, then check this one out.  It pretty much highlights the zone he is in for most of his films and gives you a taste of him at the tip top of his game.",5,Leave it to Almodovar...,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,2041,"['Pedro', 'Almodovar', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'vivid', 'sense', 'self', 'features', 'rabid', 'fan', 'base', 'everything', 'am', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'acquainted', 'work', 'passing', 'year', 'stand', 'fence', 'collective', 'body', 'work', 'denying', 'can', 'weave', 'crazy', 'tale', 'one', 'else', 'soap', 'opera', 'tendencies', 'serve', 'aid', 'hinder', 'films', 'depending', 'narrative', 'use', 'restraint', 'end', 'day', 'when', 'right', 'VERY', 'right.', 'Women', 'Verge', 'Nervous', 'Breakdown', 'moment', 'when', 'got', 'very', 'right.Thrusting', 'lives', 'multiple', 'women', 'contending', 'various', 'issues', 'regarding', 'men', 'Almodovar', 'colorful', 'flourishing', 'picture', 'bickering', 'pleading', 'plotting', 'reminiscing', 'surging', 'splashing', 'charm', 'wit', 'loads', 'soap', 'Pepa', 'actress', 'love', 'married', 'man', 'married', 'man', 'been', 'separated', 'wife', 'time', 'now', 'walking', 'out', 'Pepa', 'When', 'holiday', 'Pepa', 'gone', 'back', 'wife', 'wife', 'certain', 'taking', 'Pepa', 'third', 'woman', 'involved', 'yet', 'aware', 'Then', 'Pepa', 'introduced', 'lover', 'son', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'when', 'come', 'coincidentally', 'buy', 'place', 'When', 'Pepa', 'best', 'friend', 'up', 'own', 'set', 'man', 'problems', 'time', 'involving', 'cops', 'Pepa', 'place', 'turned', 'circus', 'complete', 'drugged', 'gazpacho', 'loaded', 'guns.Almodovar', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'here', 'film', 'really', 'called', 'such', 'lavish', 'helpings', 'top', 'benefits', 'outlandish', 'atmosphere', 'narrative', 'just', 'farfetched', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'great', 'Carmen', 'Maura', 'Julieta', 'Serrano', 'taking', 'best', 'show', 'notices', 'me.If', 'are', 'new', 'world', 'Almodovar', 'then', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'highlights', 'zone', 'most', 'films', 'taste', 'tip', 'top', 'game']",N/A

504739,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00000IQCG,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 3]","`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'  written and directed by Spaniard Pedro Almodovar has been described by some other reviewers as a `screwball comedy'. I generally agree with this assessment, except that compared to the greatest of this genre, for example, `Bringing Up Baby' with Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, this effort is just a bit weak, primarily in the weaknesses of the male protagonists, who generally make short appearances, largely as a means to introduce the various stressed out women of the story, of which there are four or five, depending on how you count them.Like `Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down, the next Almodovar film, this involves a film within a film in that the lead character played by Carmen Maura is a voiceover actress who dubbs female voices. They appear to be working on an American film starring Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden whose name escapes me.The lion's share of the story is the increasingly desperate efforts of two main characters to work out their failed relation with the primary male character, as one woman, the Maura character is the man's long time mistress, and the other, played by Julieta Serrano, is his wife. The other women are stressed out by an oddly contemporary subplot in which some Shiihite terrorists are planning to blow up a flight to Copenhagen, the very same flight the lead male character is to be taking with his new mistress.Oddly enough, Antonio Banderas, who gets second billing on the cover of the tape is hardly even the third or fourth most important character in the film. Either his credit is being boosted due to his more recent celebrity or he was among the best known Spanish film actors even in 1988.This is a very entertaining film, at least as good as a lesser Woody Allen movie, but not quite up to the best comedies.",4,Enjoyable Comedy.

In this fleet-footed comedy a woman (played by Carmen Maura) learns that she is pregnant by her married lover (Fernando Guillen) and spends two frantic days and nights trying to contact him with the news. This sets off a madcap series of ""adventures"" - each one enough to cause anyone a nervous breakdown - involving Shiite terrorists, her lover's wife and son, the police, and a mad chase to the airport. At the end Maura saves Guillen's life (his crazy wife was going to shoot him) but decides to throw him over.The camera technique here is flawless: with quick cutting and constant movement we feel Maura's anxiety. The maddening missed connections are handled brilliantly. Writer and director Almodovar has a sure comic touch.

504741,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,B00000IQCG,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[1, 9]","This film is not as funny as it thinks it is. The script is lacking in wit  and there is no coherent plot. Instead, in Almodovar's usual complex style,  we have a series of interrelated visual jokes hung loosely on one dramatic  thread: an abandoned pregnant woman's frantic search for the man who has  dumped her. This woman, Pepa, played with her usual skill by Almodovar  regular Carmen Maura, is a second-rate actress who performs in TV soap  commercials. We are shown her playing the part of a serial killer's wife  faced with the task, each time he comes home, of washing his blood-stained  shirts. What kind of visual joke is that?We have a blond, eccentric  taxi-driver, who has his colourful ""Mambo"" taxi stuffed with magazines,  drinks and every possible Medicare product, who, by coincidence, just  happens to be there on the three occasions Pepa needs him.  And then we have her  friend, Candella (Maria Barranco), a tall, slender girl, who, thinking she  is being pursued by the police because of  her involvement with a Shiite  terrorist, comes to Pepa's apartment for advise and succour and failing to  get either tries to throw herself off the balcony. She is saved by Pepa's  ex-lover's son, Carlos (Antonio Banderas), and his ugly girl-friend,  Marisa( Rossy de Palma). Pepa has not met Carlos before; he has come, by  coincidence, to view the apartment which Pepa now wants to let. Whilst the  others talk, Marisa drinks some Gazpacho, prepared earlier by Pepa with a  near lethal dose of barbiturates for her ex-lover, Ivan. She then spends  the rest of the film in a deep sleep thus giving Carlos and Candella time  and opportunity to fall in love.Towards the end, Pepa, in a wild chase  scene, follows her ex-lover's pyschotic  wife, Lucia  (Julieta  Serrano), who is on a motor bike with her hair flying, to the air-port and  arrives just in time to prevent her shooting her husband, Ivan (Fernando  Guillen). The latter is so grateful that he wants Pepa back but she will  have none of it.Despite its underlying theme of despair and occasional  descent into sick humour, this is, paradoxically, a happy film - bright,  colourful, fast-moving, with hardly a dull moment, the sort of film you  might turn to to help raise your spirits on a rainy afternoon.",4,A happy film,968371200,"09 8, 2000",2000,2278,"['film', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'script', 'lacking', 'wit', 'coherent', 'plot', 'Instead', 'Almodovar', 'usual', 'complex', 'style', 'have', 'series', 'interrelated', 'visual', 'jokes', 'hung', 'loosely', 'one', 'dramatic', 'thread', 'abandoned', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'frantic', 'search', 'man', 'who', 'dumped', 'woman', 'Pepa', 'played', 'usual', 'skill', 'Almodovar', 'regular', 'Carmen', 'Maura', 'second-rate', 'actress', 'who', 'TV', 'soap', 'commercials', 'are', 'shown', 'playing', 'part', 'serial', 'killer', 'wife', 'faced', 'task', 'time', 'home', 'washing', 'blood-stained', 'shirts', 'What', 'kind', 'visual', 'joke', 'have', 'blond', 'eccentric', 'taxi-driver', 'who', 'colourful', 'Mambo', 'taxi', 'stuffed', 'magazines', 'drinks', 'possible', 'Medicare', 'product', 'who', 'coincidence', 'just', 'be', 'there', 'three', 'occasions', 'Pepa', 'then', 'have', 'friend', 'Candella', 'Maria', 'Barranco', 'tall', 'slender', 'girl', 'who', 'thinking', 'being', 'pursued', 'police', 'involvement', 'Shiite', 'terrorist', 'Pepa', 'apartment', 'advise', 'succour', 'failing', 'get', 'tries', 'throw', 'off', 'balcony', 'saved', 'Pepa', 'ex-lover', 'son', 'Carlos', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'ugly', 'girl-friend', 'Marisa', 'Rossy', 'de', 'Palma', 'Pepa', 'not', 'met', 'Carlos', 'come', 'coincidence', 'view', 'apartment', 'Pepa', 'now', 'let', 'Whilst', 'others', 'talk', 'Marisa', 'Gazpacho', 'prepared', 'earlier', 'Pepa', 'near', 'lethal', 'dose', 'barbiturates', 'ex-lover', 'Ivan', 'then', 'rest', 'film', 'deep', 'sleep', 'thus', 'giving', 'Carlos', 'Candella', 'time', 'opportunity', 'fall', 'love.Towards', 'end', 'Pepa', 'wild', 'chase', 'scene', 'ex-lover', 'pyschotic', 'wife', 'Lucia', 'Julieta', 'Serrano', 'who', 'motor', 'bike', 'hair', 'flying', 'air-port', 'just', 'time', 'prevent', 'shooting', 'husband', 'Ivan', 'Fernando', 'Guillen', 'latter', 'so', 'grateful', 'Pepa', 'back', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'it.Despite', 'underlying', 'theme', 'despair', 'occasional', 'descent', 'sick', 'humour', 'paradoxically', 'happy', 'film', 'bright', 'colourful', 'fast-moving', 'hardly', 'dull', 'moment', 'sort', 'film', 'might', 'turn', 'help', 'raise', 'spirits', 'rainy', 'afternoon']",N/A

As a result she's had trouble sleeping & as she's forced to pack up his belongings, she finds herself becoming even more unhinged the more she packs. Meanwhile the lovely Candela has her own problems- she's discovered that her lover is a terrorist & that he has planned to hijack a plane. Terrified that the police will assume that she's in on the plot, Candela has escaped to Pepa's apartment.

504745,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B00000IQCG,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[4, 4]","Pedro Almodovar, an internationally and critically acclaimed Spanish director, takes eccentricity and neuroses to new heights in WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, one of his most well known films.  Pepa (Carmen Maura), an actress, has just been left alone and pregnant by her lover.  It turns out that this situation is only one of many problems that she encounters.  Her friend, Candela (Maria Barranco) is having a crisis of her own.  Then, there's the matter of the gazpacho that Pepa has prepared--spiked with thirty sleeping pills--but, I won't ruin that part of the story for you as to what prompts her to prepare such a sleep-inducing dish.  The whole mood is comparable to a telenovela (Spanish language soap opera).  The atmosphere is melodramatic (hence, the reason for the title), desperate and probes at the main character, her plight and whether she can hold herself together in the eye of so many simulataneous storms around her.I'll be honest in saying that I didn't ""get"" this film when I first saw it.  I can relate to viewers who didn't like it.  Initially, when it had finished, I thought, ""What was THAT?""  Almodovar's writing style really seems very analytical and feels more like a clinical study of what heights someone will go when emotionally instable.  It was hard for me to really feel connected to any of the characters, and the atmosphere felt more than a little like intersecting episodes in a serial.  Yet, upon reflection, I can appreciate the depth, skillful artistic direction and beauty of the characters that we come to know.

Her best friend may be wanted by the police for her association with a Shiite terrorist.  And now her lover's psychotic wife is knocking at the door.  Can she catch up with her lover, protect her friend, arrange a new romance for her lover's son, dodge the police, and disarm her lover's wife in time to foil an international terrorist plot?  Well... maybe after she serves her guests some gazpacho.In any other hands WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN would collapse into mere frantic farce, but Almodovar directs Carmen Marua and an ensemble cast to a brilliant series of plausible performances that allows the viewer to buy into the story, improbabilities and all--and the result is a hilarious, touching, and fascinating film that is considerably more than the sum of its parts.  This is certainly comedy at its most sophistocated, splashed with social satire and spangled with a touch of symbolism for those inclined to seek it.A number of motifs run through the film--recorded voices, telephones, and the color red are but a few examples--but Almodovar doesn't force his audience to deconstruct his film in order to enjoy it, and WOMEN ON THE VERGE is easily one of the funniest European films of the past fifty years.  Those who expect farce plain and simple or who like their movies to tie up into a neat package by the time the credits roll may be disappointed--but if you can make a leap of faith and meet the film on its own terms you'll find it sly, witty, often laugh-out-loud funny... and it will leave you with a feel-good afterglow too.

504750,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,B00000IQCG,Luis Hernandez,"[4, 4]","Filmed in the style of the screwball comedies of the 1950's, Pedro Almodovar's classic, &quot;Women on the Verge of the Nervous Breakdown,&quot; is widely seen as the Spanish director's greatest directorial effort ever, due to his witty script, wonderful use of colors and schemes, and his ability to capture the range of emotions women possess.The story, which revolves around a jilted woman (Carmen Maura in her final film collaboration with Almodovar) in search of her lover (Fernando Guillen) might sound like a melodrama at first, however if you mix in a bit of zany subplot and an array of classic characters, and you got yourself a comedy classic.Pepa (Maura) finds out that her longtime lover Ivan has left her for another woman. Pepa, who works with Ivan dubbing foreign films into Spanish, discovers that she is expecting a child, and must convey this important message to Ivan in hopes of convincing him to return.In her search for Ivan, she discovers that Ivan's ex-wife Lucia (Julieta Serrano) has been released from the asylum that has taken care of her since her breakup with Ivan. She also discovers that Ivan has a son (Antonio Banderas) she never was told about, and due to a series of coincidental encounters, they encounter each other.Pepa doesn't seem to be the only person having love problems. Her best friend Candela (Maria Barranco) has discovered that her Arab boyfriend and his friends are actually Shiite terrorists planning to hijack the next flight to Stockholm. Scared, confused, and out of her mind, Candela finds refuge in Pepa's penthouse, and along with Pepa, Carlos (Banderas), and Carlos' fiance (Rossie de Palma), the madcap hysteria that will overtake the later half of the film takes place.Using a wide selection of colors that benefit from the film's use of Technicolor, Almodovar has definitely creating a visual feats of patterns, objects (notice the clocks at the beginning), cityscapes (Madrid's famous skyline), and especially colors (as the main character, Pepa is identified by reds, which probably is Almodovar's tribute to American director Nicholas Ray and his famous use of Technicolor red in the classic &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;). Other eye-catching objects that make this film truly wonderful include Candela's coffeepot earrings (they became a major fashion accessory in Spain and Latin America in the early 1990's) and the campy cab decor that the driver of the Mambo Taxi (Guillermo Montesinos) has adopted for his cab.Almodovar also adopted a wide selection of beautiful and popular music and songs to tell his story. &quot;Soy Infeliz,&quot; by Lola Beltran and &quot;Puro Teatro,&quot; by La Lupe are eternal classics thanks to this film. His selection of the rarely heard, yet beautiful compositions by Russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov (&quot;The Story of the Kalandar Prince&quot; from Scheherezade-Symphonic Suite, Op. 35 AND the &quot;Fandango Asturiano,&quot; from Capriccio Espagnol. Op. 34) gives the film both a feeling of relaxation and fiery anger.&quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,&quot; marks a totally new direction in Spanish cinema. The end of the censorship that was widely well known during the Franco regime of the past allowed Almodovar and many new Spanish directors to explore filmmaking without any restrictions. This film, which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards in 1989, went on to win many awards including several Goya awards (Spain's highest film awards) and Maura went on to win Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival. Truly, this was her greatest role, and Almodovar knew that he wanted to give his audience a major overdose of Maura that the audience will likely beg for more. He was right, and Maura's performance is considered to be one of the greatest performances by non-English speaking actress in recent years.If you're looking for an amazing, funny, and visual film, then &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; is the best choice to fulfill your search.

Pepa (Carmen Maura) is a television actress living in Madrid and mistress to the older Ivan (Fernando Guillen), with whom she does voice acting on foreign films. But Ivan leaves her a few months after they move into a posh penthouse apartment, around the time Pepa gets some unexpected news from her doctor. She desperately wants to talk to Ivan but he's playing hard-to-reach. Best friend Candela (Maria Barranco) is in an even more harried state when she finds out that her lover and his friends are terrorists.Pepa's trying to track down Ivan. Candela is suicidally terrified of being found out by the police. And Ivan's insane estranged wife Lucia (Julieta Serrano) is seeking revenge. The chaos converges at Pepa's apartment, where ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" becomes full-blown farce. But it's not silly farce. Pepa and Candela have been ""on the verge"" of nervous collapse for a day. On day two, Almodovar makes it clear that life is not going to get the ladies down. Perhaps the increasing absurdity of the situation gets to Pepa. She takes control. It's over-the-top and somehow not. The emotions seem quite genuine.One source of frustration that we would not find in a film today is good old ""telephone tag"". Ivan is avoiding Pepa, Pepa seeking Ivan, and then Ivan seeking Pepa, and never do they meet....because there are no cell phones. The characters must resort to reaching each other on their home phones and leaving messages on answering machines. That as much as the `80s fashions make this a film that plainly represents a certain time. It is not as visually accomplished as some of Almodovar's later films, but the bold lines and vivid colors of the 1980s lend themselves well to his style. The action takes place over a period of just 48 hours, during which a sleep-deprived Pepa experiences a gamut of emotions. She's not having fun, but the audience is, as the stress and absurdity pile up.

You just cannot imagine your life could get this out of control.The opening scenes are dreamlike, colorful and only when you watch this for the second time do you fully understand the implications of all the movie making episodes and why Ivan is walking by woman after woman saying exactly what they want to hear.In this movie, there are a number of women who are involved with a number of men they should be running from instead of pursuing them endlessly in the hopes of returned affection.While I started watching this in English, you might also tend to agree it is best watched with the Castilian audio track and the subtitles of your choice.This story really begins with Pepa (Carmen Maura) oversleeping and hearing the love of her life leave a message on her answering machine asking her to pack all his things in a suitcase because he is leaving on a trip. Pepa does what any sane woman would do and tosses out everything that reminds her of Ivan. Except it takes almost the entire movie for this to happen. We wonder how she would have reacted if she had not wanted to tell Ivan she was pregnant.Candela (Maria Barranco) is one of her best friends she is trying to avoid so she can deal with her own heartbreak. Candela is running from the law and needs a safe place to escape to until she can figure out how to warn the world about a Shiite terrorist attack she found out about from her ex. Eventually Candela makes her way to Pepa's penthouse just as Pepa is flying out the door.Each woman is vulnerable in various ways. Lucia deals with her rejection in violent ways, Pepa by looking for her boyfriend endlessly and Candela by trying to jump from the balcony of Pepa's penthouse.This movie is so beautifully woven together with all sort of delicious connections including the gazpacho episodes and the taxi driver. Nothing in this movie is expected. You also see each character giving her view of the entire situation. Antonio Banderas appears as Ivan's son Carlos and is hardly recognizable at first. Must have been that he is so young and is wearing glasses.At times just the way the scenes are filmed gives it such visual appeal. It is a comedy, a mystery, a thriller depending on the music which is only used to maximum effect where needed. There is some brilliant symbolism like the bed going up in flames perhaps representing a relationship destroyed in a moment of misunderstanding or passion.With that said, this has to be the most hysterical film I have seen ""since"" I watched a movie when I was seven called ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963).""

She dubs foreign films into her native Spanish, and sometimes provides the voice for actresses in Spanish films who for whatever reason don't speak their own lines (this is common practice in many European film industries).As though Pepa's day weren't bad enough, because her lover Ivan has just broken up with her, and she's found out she's pregnant by him, people keep entering her life with strange demands on this day.First is her friend Candela, who is running from her Arab muslim boyfriend; he has turned out to be a shiite terrorist. After that, many new people pop up when least expected, each a little closer to a nervous breakdown than the last. And each, it would seen, more determined to push Pepa over the edge, but she somehow keeps her cool, and makes it through the day.Pepa is the one person in this film who seems to have the &quot;right&quot; to completely breakdown, and yet she is the sanestone here.This is screwball comedy (plus sex) just like Leo McCarey and Ernst Lubitsch used to make. I congratulate Almadovar on capturing this tenor. Recent American attempts to revive this style have usually digressed into tar pits of lame yet gross sex jokes, or played like two hour sit-coms. This film is quick and light, and none of the actors ever step outside their characters to say to the audience &quot;Look at me!

Suddenly, one of his earlier mistresses and their son  (a young Antonio Banderas) with fiancee appear almost by accident.  Add a friend who fell in love inadvertently with a terrorist  and now fears he will denounce her as an accomplice, and you have all the elements for a manic comedy, especially when the cops arrive.

I was satisfied by how well the movie still holds, the humor is still relevant, and the acting makes us wish average quality today was closer to what we had in the past. Also, it reminded me how it is possible to make a movie that leaves viewers happy and deliver it in 90 minutes instead of the 120+ minutes that are the norm nowadays.This movie clearly shows that a great script and excellent performances are all you need to deliver a top notch product. The string of events that are part of the story presents us with a series of picturesque characters, each of which has something special to provide us. It is hard to point out which performances are noteworthy, since from a young Antonio Banderas, to an experienced Carmen Maura, the cast is superb.
