It's really very funny, if you like slapstick, frat humor, and even genuine satire.  (I'm a university professor, so I don't only watch comedies like this, but if I like 'em, I love em, to paraphrase Yogi Berra.)There are references to dozens of movies.  ""Young Frankenstein"" is one, as an astute reviewer noted.  But it also skewers every pal picture I can think of, and the creepy night scenes are obviously a very funny parody of Kubrick's completely awful ""Eyes Wide Shut.""  Watch what happens in the background as they approach ""Beerfest,"" which is actually a mix of ""Eyes"" and about six other films.  This is a movie that appears dumb, a la ""Animal House,"" but if you know movies, it's actually really smart satire.  The final payoff is drop dead glorious.Sure, it's closer to Monty Python than  Ingmar Bergman (what a jokester!).  But like the Pythons (who also used boobie humor and creepy animal jokes, along with exaggerated violence), these guys know their sources and send them up most humorously.  Recommended.  DO fill the cooler with plenty of brew, but keep your eyes wide open, expecially for the stuff that happens in the background of the scenes leading up to Beerfest.  Watch for the movie references throughout.  It's sly stuff indeed.PC this ain't.  Thank you, Broken Lizard!A late addition:  The movie, in the tradition of a lot of buddy films, is also really about the families we construct for ourselves out of the random parts of our silly existences.  I was thinking of this while watching ""Dodgeball"" and the ridiculously under-rated ""The Watch.""  As America becomes increasingly more separatist--social media does not bring us together, dogs, it presses us into cuddly closets where we can breathe down each others' identical necks--these movies do serve a function:  disparate people and generations finding common ground in an idea.  Sure, this one is about drinking beer:  but it isn't.  It's about restoring family honor.

However, the more I watched it, the more I got to see the main characters interact with each other, and do very funny things.The story did a GREAT job with the whole ""beer contest"" thing.  They made the story seem like drinking beer as part of a contest to beat their opponents is the most important thing they will ever do.  A good, respectable amount of time was devoted to the storyline of a supposed silly comedy, and you have to admire that.  The previews led me to believe this was going to be an awful, go-nowhere party film.  Not really.Not all the jokes worked, just like in most comedies.  But the funny parts were golden, and every single character belonged in the film because they all got along great.

While doing so they stumble upon a secret Beer competition, held in the secret fashion of Fight Club but with Beer games between international teams. Jan and Todd discover there isn't an American team and on challenging the Germans they are humiliated. When the brothers arrive home they decide to put together their own beer drinking team to return to the festival and get revenge on the Germans. We are then introduced to Landfill, Barry & Fink who take us on a hysterical ride whilst they train for the competition.The Review: I must admit when I started watching this film I didn't expect much, in fact I expected it to just be another attempt at re-inventing the classic, slightly immature comedy style created by American Pie. I was truly mistaken as from the get go I was laughing out loud from start to finish, with the one liners and slapstick silliness.

Great Gam Gam with her unintentional inuendos, Barry with his un-matched hand eye co-ordination and Fink who has the ""Eye of the Jew.""This film has everything that a fan of these types of movies would want. Nudity, Great characters and satirical stereotypes. The Germans are simply the most amusing as they're the stereotype of what you would consider a German to be, Loud, obnoxious and arrogant.I absolutely loved this film, it was a genuine surprise to see a film like this come into its own.

1026619,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000JJ4DNW,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 8]","For this review of ""Beerfest,"" I'm going to say something I don't think I'm ever going to say again: this movie is so bad that I'm actually recommending it. It's the kind of bad that needs to be seen, if not for the joy of making fun of it, then for the understanding of what not to do when making a film. Rarely has it been this much fun to witness the unfolding of a cinematic disaster; believe it or not, I left the theater admiring Broken Lizard for having the guts to see this project through. To say that it's low-grade would be an understatement; it's so over the top that you just can't turn away from it. I found myself smiling at the puerile sexual innuendos, giggling at the offensive stereotypes, and relishing in the knowledge that I had absolutely nothing to do with its creation. The television spots pretty much capture the essence, despite being edited for content: this is a depraved film that has absolutely no redeeming qualities, going seamlessly from one tasteless joke to the next.I'm sure you already think I'm out of my mind, and to be honest, I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe some alcoholic fumes wafted from the screen and got me a little drunk. If that's the case, I'm not at all surprised; only someone with an altered consciousness would find anything about this movie funny or entertaining. When the end credits started to roll, I thought about what I had just seen and realized that I actually enjoyed myself. Watching the actors try to make something out of a hopeless situation was more than a little amusing, as was analyzing the attempts at plot and character development. Every misguided moment it has to offer will bring it closer and closer to Cult Film status. I say this because most cult films are terrible, and anyone who gets their kicks from terrible films will regard ""Beerfest"" with awe.The catastrophe begins when Donald Sutherland makes a cameo as the recently deceased Grandpa Wolfhouse, a German immigrant who spent most of his life in Colorado as a sausage maker. According to his mother--known only as Great Gam Gam (Cloris Leachman)--there's a special family tradition of returning a dead relative's ashes to Germany during the week of Oktoberfest. She knows her son would have wanted his remains returned to their home country; only there can he be buried peacefully in the family plot. Brothers Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd Wolfhouse (Erik Stolhanske) are more than willing to fulfill their grandfather's last request. This is not only because they loved him dearly, it's also because the two are unrestrained party animals. And everyone knows that at Oktoberfest, beer practically flows out of fountains.Once in Germany, they meet with Mr. Schniedelwischen (Bjorn Johnson), who immediately leads the boozy duo to a secret warehouse. Inside they discover Beerfest, an underground drinking competition where massive amounts of beer are consumed in one sitting. The atmosphere is fiercely competitive, with drinkers from all over the world gathering in the hopes of winning the title (no one seems to care that they'll also develop acute cirrhosis of the liver). Thus far, no one has beaten the German team; they train all year for this competition, downing enough beer to kill a normal person in a matter of minutes. You'd think the filmmakers would have paid attention to such a crucial detail, but realistic ideas don't even come into play here. And thank goodness for that; it only would have turned an already bad film into an entirely intolerable one.The German team is a family led by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen (Jurgen Pronchnow), Jan and Todd's distant relative. Unfortunately, the family reunion is spoiled by feelings of resentment; apparently, Grandpa Wolfhouse had stolen a secret beer recipe from Wolfhausen many years ago. Neither he nor his grandchildren--Otto (Will Forte), Rolf (Nat Faxon), and Gunter (Eric Christian Olsen)--have anything nice to say about such a dirty thief. This understandably doesn't sit well with Jan and Todd, and they challenge their foreign rivals to a drinking game. As you might expect, the brothers lose and are forced to leave in shame. And no wonder; an American has never competed in Beerfest, meaning they don't have what it takes to tolerate such large quantities of alcohol.Returning home, they vow to return to the next competition and win back their family honor. But because this requires a year of intense training, they know they're going to need some help. A ragtag gathering of old friends is formed, including: Barry Badrinath (Jay Chandrasekhar), a down and out male prostitute; Steve ""Fink"" Finkelstein (Steve Lemme), a Jewish scientist; and Landfill (Kevin Heffernan), a hefty competitor who was fired from his dream job at a beer bottling factory. You'd think the first two would be unlikely candidates for heavy drinkers, but they definitely know their way around a mug of beer. Not only that, but they happen to be good at drinking games, including Ping-Pong and coin tossing.Thus begins the comedic exploits of their yearlong training regimen. But I'm using the word ""comedic"" in the loosest possible context; each scene of ""Beerfest"" is filled with bottom-of-the-barrel gags that I can't describe on a public website. What classic moments these were: so shameless and unfunny that one just has to stick around and see what else the filmmakers have up their sleeves. And believe me when I say that there's plenty more, including some interesting moments with actress Mo'Nique. Does it ultimately matter whether or not the Wolfhouse brothers return to Germany to compete? I certainly don't think so; everything is too delightfully horrible to allow that kind of focus. Like some of the most classic cult films ever created, ""Beerfest"" is a movie that's so bad it's good. Yes, I thought it was likeable, but only because I had the time of my life in hating it.It opens with the disclaimer that anyone who actually attempts to drink such large quantities of beer will die. I'm closing with the disclaimer that this movie cannot in any way, shape, or form be taken seriously. I don't know if this is the right mindset, but frankly, I don't really care. I want this movie to be seen, especially by aspiring filmmakers. They will probably be the first to laugh at it, from the terrible story to the bad acting to the substandard sense of humor. If I had a beer right now, I'd drink this absolute disgrace of a film.

1026624,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000JJ4DNW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[15, 17]","You have to love any comedy that throws up a warning screen before the opening credits - in this case, it's a warning to leave the serious beer-drinking to the professionals (or else you will die).  Mr. Big Man on Campus may be able to drink his frat buddies under the table, but he probably wouldn't last five minutes at Beerfest.  It's much more than a contest to see who can drink the most beer in the shortest amount of time.  Beerfest is a veritable mini-Olympics of brewsky, with such games as beer pong, quarters, and the formidable Das Boot helping determine the overall champion team.  This is truly where the big boys play.Upon the death of their grandfather, Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd Wolfhouse (Erik Stolhanske) travel to Munich to carry out his last request - having his ashes scattered in his homeland during Oktoberfest.  There is nothing somber about this occasion, though, as an abundance of beer and women's breasts quickly extinguish whatever grief they may have been feeling.  Then their guide takes them to Beerfest, and they think they've died and gone to heaven - at first.  All that changes when their German cousin, Wolfgang von Wolfhaus (Jurgen Prochnow) orders them to leave and attacks their family honor by accusing their dead grandfather of stealing the renowned family beer recipe and fleeing to American with his prostitute of a mother.  Being humiliated by a bunch of pansy Germans with their Hans and Franz accents and tight little lederhosen doesn't sit well with the Wolfhouses.  Upon returning home, they vow to form a team and return to Beerfest next year so that they can have their revenge on the GermansAs far as team members go, the guys fall back on some old college drinking buddies.  ""Landfill"" (Kevin Heffeman), still bitter about having lost his job at a brewery for drinking too much of the outgoing beer, is an easy sell to join the team - and they don't call him Landfill for nothing.  ""Fink"" Finkelstein (Steve Lemme), now a scientist spending most of his time masturbating frogs, doesn't look like a beer drinker, but you know how those wiry guys can fool you - and he's smart, hopefully smart enough to figure out the trick of conquering Das Boot, Beerfest's ultimate tie-breaking contest.  Fink's not too high on the idea of participating at first - but his reluctance disappears completely when he learns that the enemy is German (never underestimate the power of the ""eye of the Jew"").  Then there's the somewhat controversial choice of Barry Badrinath (Jay Chandrasekhar, doing triple duty as actor, co-writer, and director).  Barry is really down on his luck nowadays, and there's also the fact that he slept with Jan's (or was it Todd's) girlfriend back in college), so there's always some underlying friction there.  As the guys begin their training, though, they all come together - putting their health, their jobs, their families, even their own lives on the line, super-focused on winning the championship.  The German team, especially Wolfgang von Wolfhaus, has some dirty tricks up its sleeve, though, making their play for the long-lost family beer recipe weeks before the contest.  Their sneaky blitzkrieg tactics threaten to break up the American team, but these guys are playing for everything they hold dear - the long-lost family beer recipe, their Great Gam Gam (Cloris Leachman), all underdogs, each other, as well as for America.  And so this becomes a story of the underdog daring to dream and trying to make that dream a reality.I thought this movie was pretty hilarious.  The whole Beerfest atmosphere is a hoot, the guys' training regimen produces many a funny moment, the dialogue holds many a good joke, and the actors really gel together quite well despite their obvious differences.

This will repeat.After 9 min. 20 sec. the movie will automatically begin if you have not made a choice in the menu.Johann Von Wolfhaus (Donald Sutherland) has given his grandchildren Jan (Paul Soter) and Todd (Erik Stolhanske) the family restaurant upon his death.  He has one request. They must take his ashes to Munich, Germany during the festival of Oktoberfest. They are to meet a Mr. Schniedelwichsen (Bjorn Johnson) who will show them where to place the urn.Not everything goes so smoothly with all the beer and food to be had. That is until Mr. Schniedelwichsen takes them to an underground Beerfest where they meet their cousins.The competitive cousins do not welcome their American relatives and throw grandpa's ashes on them.So Jan and Todd decide to train for next year's Beerfest competition with the help of their friends Barry (Jay Chandrasekhar), Fink (Steve Lemme) and Landfill (Kevin Heffernan).This unrated version is quite overlong, but you will find Cloris Leachman and Jay Chandrasekhar to be scene stealers.All five of the main stars (Jay Chandrasekhar, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, Erik Stolhanske, Kevin Hefferman) were also writers for this film.Directed by Jay Chandrasekhar.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","I have considered myself a fan since seeing ""Super Troopers"" for the first time and  ""Beerfest"" is filled with the Broken Lizard style of humor. Some of it is intentionally silly, such as the German brothers named Hammacher and Schlemmer. At other times, it's raunchy. One of the best examples of this is an extended sequence in which a drunken Barry picks up and beds a woman. We first see the event take place through his beer goggles, then again in reality. He envisions himself as a smooth-talking stud, like Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" but really he's slurring his speech and wearing an empty beer box on his head.This kind of thing represents Broken Lizard comedy at its best. Part of what I like about the group is that they aren't afraid to teeter the line of decency or good taste. Their movies are gleefully profane, this one in particular as it is filled with nudity, sexual humor, and rampant substance abuse. That doesn't mean I enjoy this sort of thing for its own sake (because I don't) but such take-no-prisoners humor can have a big payoff when done right. In each of their films, the comedians have managed at least a few of those payoffs, and this one is no different. I laughed loudly during certain scenes.While ""Beerfest"" has moments where the troupe is at its peak, the movie also exemplifies some of their biggest weaknesses. One of the things I've noticed is that only three out of the five members are really funny. Kevin Heffernan is the funniest; he's kind of like a much edgier John Candy. Jay Chandrasekhar (who directed all the Broken Lizard films as well as The Dukes of Hazzard) possesses a perfect sense of comic delivery, both in his verbal execution of lines and in his physical gestures. Steve Lemme, meanwhile, is gifted at disappearing into characters, Mike Myers-style. Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter are by no means untalented, but they get a significantly smaller laugh ratio than their counterparts. And they're technically the leads in this movie.A bigger problem that has also plagued Club Dread is that the Lizards are too in love with their own material. ""Beerfest"" runs an unconscionable 110 minutes, which is way too long for this thin premise. There just isn't enough inherent comedy in beer drinking contests or German jokes to warrant such a length. The film should reasonably run somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes. By dragging on for almost two hours, it starts to wear out its welcome. There's an old slogan for a popular beer company: ""Tastes great, less filling."" Beerfest would certainly have tasted better had it been less filling by about 30 minutes. Other than that  Broken Lizard need a sterner guiding hand to streamline their material, but their third film is amusing.",4,[3.5]--I Took this movie for what it is,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2741,"['have', 'considered', 'fan', 'seeing', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'first', 'time', 'Beerfest', 'filled', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'style', 'humor', 'intentionally', 'silly', 'such', 'German', 'brothers', 'named', 'Hammacher', 'Schlemmer', 'other', 'times', 'raunchy', 'One', 'best', 'examples', 'extended', 'sequence', 'drunken', 'Barry', 'up', 'beds', 'woman', 'first', 'see', 'event', 'take', 'place', 'beer', 'goggles', 'then', 'again', 'reality', 'smooth-talking', 'stud', 'Travolta', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'really', 'slurring', 'speech', 'wearing', 'empty', 'beer', 'box', 'head.This', 'kind', 'thing', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'comedy', 'best', 'Part', 'what', 'like', 'group', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'teeter', 'line', 'decency', 'good', 'taste', 'movies', 'are', 'gleefully', 'profane', 'one', 'particular', 'filled', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'humor', 'rampant', 'substance', 'abuse', ""n't"", 'mean', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'own', 'sake', 'do', ""n't"", 'such', 'take-no-prisoners', 'humor', 'can', 'have', 'big', 'payoff', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'films', 'comedians', 'have', 'managed', 'least', 'few', 'payoffs', 'one', 'different', 'laughed', 'loudly', 'certain', 'scenes.While', 'Beerfest', 'moments', 'where', 'troupe', 'peak', 'movie', 'also', 'biggest', 'weaknesses', 'One', 'things', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'only', 'three', 'five', 'members', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'funniest', 'kind', 'much', 'edgier', 'John', 'Candy', 'Jay', 'Chandrasekhar', 'who', 'directed', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'perfect', 'sense', 'comic', 'delivery', 'verbal', 'execution', 'lines', 'physical', 'gestures', 'Steve', 'Lem', 'meanwhile', 'gifted', 'disappearing', 'characters', 'Mike', 'Myers-style', 'Erik', 'Stolhanske', 'Paul', 'Soter', 'are', 'means', 'untalented', 'get', 'significantly', 'smaller', 'laugh', 'ratio', 'counterparts', ""'re"", 'technically', 'leads', 'movie.A', 'bigger', 'problem', 'also', 'plagued', 'Club', 'Dread', 'Lizards', 'are', 'too', 'love', 'own', 'material', 'Beerfest', 'unconscionable', '110', 'minutes', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'thin', 'premise', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'inherent', 'comedy', 'beer', 'drinking', 'contests', 'German', 'jokes', 'warrant', 'length', 'film', 'should', 'reasonably', 'run', 'somewhere', '80', '90', 'minutes', 'dragging', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'old', 'slogan', 'popular', 'beer', 'company', 'great', 'less', 'filling', 'Beerfest', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'tasted', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'less', 'filling', '30', 'minutes', 'Other', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'need', 'sterner', 'guiding', 'hand', 'streamline', 'material', 'third', 'film', 'amusing']",N/A

Some liked Super Troopers, but didn't like (or hated) club dread. Then there are those that liked club dread, but didn't like super troopers. Some like them all, some hate all of their films.  I for one LOVE Club Dread, and am only mildly impressed with Super Troopers, so know that before i continue my review of Beerfest.Beerfest is a loveable, lighthearted, and enjoyably random film that absurdly asserts the notion that a very hardcore underground international beer drinking sport is in existance. PShaw!The cast, as usual, are brilliant. To be smart about explaining it (and as seen in the commentary and suplemental features of this blu-ray) they drew upon their knowledge and experience of their college fraternity's Drinking games to give credence to the films realism and plot. Basically that means exactly what it sounds like it should mean. Its a comedy about drinking absurd amounts of beer. Seeing boobies welcomly flashed before your eyes in a random scene or two in a very lighthearted way, and MANY MANY MANY repeateable quotes.This Blu-Ray is fantastic, with the usual 1080p and AVC-1 50Gig dual layer treatment. The colors, definition, and detail are vibrant. The sound is amazing. The only real quibble i had with it was the lack of navigable menu's and especially the POP-UP menu, which is hands down a great technological leap forward that blu-ray has that HD DVD doesn't. (besides that coveted extra space per disc)You, the beer-swilling fan that knows you already want to buy this movie just by looking at this page and reading this review, would be rightly justified by picking up this blu-ray. Not only will it really get lots of play on your ps3 or BD player and make your nice HDTV shine, but you will find yourself playing with little dolls wearing lederhosen, while your professor or boss is trying to teach you something.

Jan and Todd Wolfhouse are charged with the task of taking their grandfather's ashes to be settled in the family plot in Germany. Little do they know, the family plot is actually Beerfest, ""the ultimate test of a beer gamer's mettle."" When they get there and are accused by their German cousins of having stolen the family beer recipe, they are quickly humiliated in a drinking contest and sent back to America with their tails between their legs. They vow to have their revenge and come back next year to win the Beerfest competition.Jan and Todd assemble a team of their best friends and former drinking buddies:Landfill - an overweight eating champion recently fired from his position at a brewery for drinking on the jobFink - a well-respected scientist at the National Institutes of Health, who is also Jewish and participates simply to get back at the GermansBarry - an all-out beer gaming champion who has since fallen on hard times and resorted to prostitution to make a livingThe journey that these five men embark on is nothing if not funny, but if you didn't like the other Broken Lizard movies, I don't think you will like this one. It's in the same vein as movies like Old School and Super Troopers--a buddy comedy with plenty of T&A.; The humor is a bit over the top at times and balances precariously on the edge of crass. For instance, there were at least five topless women within the first fifteen minutes of the film and there's a running joke that Jan and Todd's Great Gam Gam is a former whore.Still, I found parts of Beerfest extremely funny and there were definitely moments I laughed out loud. This movie evoked memories of college with its references to beer pong, quarters, card games, chugging contests, and funnels. It would be fun for a guy's night out, but be forewarned that all the drinking in the movie may make you decidedly thirsty.

His dying wishes were that his ashes be spread at Oktoberfest. Instead of sadness, they encounter awesomeness. Everywhere around them is beer and hot chicks. What a great way to send their grandfather off. Until they almost kill everyone around them by accident. They are kicked out from the fest and then, with the help of someone who once knew their grandfather, they come upon a secret sort of Olympic type games... one that involves beer. Beerfest! Within these games are teams from all types of countries, except for America. The Germans, who happen to be cousins of Jan and Todd, despise the two and destroy them at a mere chugging game. Humiliated, the two return home and decide to create a team to rival the Germans next year at Beerfest. After collecting three more, the team begins their beer drinking training, ranging from shooting quarters, chugging, high pouring, upside down chugging, and even trying to unlock the mystery of Das Boot (a huge glass boot that is chugged out of). While training, they find a lost beer recipe that makes one of the best beers they've ever tasted, and the Germans claim that the rightful owner is theirs and they want it back. Now the games are more than just respect, but also for actual ownership of the recipe.The first time I viewed this was on DVD, and I immediately started playing quarters with my roommate as soon as it was over and had to skip work the next day because I was hungover. Other than all the cool drinking games, the movie is hilarious. I love everything (even the hit or miss stuff like Club Dread) that Broken Lizard has put out. What is cool is that the movie really does get funnier with each viewing. Not really much to say about the movie since it really just deals around beer, beer games, hot women, hot topless women, and a lot of laughs. On the extras, there is some stuff where the guys are talking about some of their worst drinking moments and the one that involves Kevin Heffernan (Landfill) is hilarious. Talking about how they went to a restaurant and he got annihilated before it was even 2pm and he started puking right at the front door profusely had me cracking up.If you like beer, women, and some crude humor, then you definitely need to own Beerfest!P.S. - One time I lost a game of quarters to a girl at this huge house party. I had to bong two pitchers of beer within about 5 minutes of each other. It was not fun. I don't even remember much after that incident except for doing a few shots of something. What I do remember is waking up naked with a Santa Clause hat on in my friend's game room and searching the house for my clothes. I guess I got hot.",4,BEEEEEEER!!

As the movie started, I had my reservations. I am never one to shy away from gratuitous nudity, but I have often considered it a last-ditch effort to wrench a laugh from the audience. If they were resorting to that in the first few minutes of the movie, things did not look good. Little did I know at the time that there was a necessary set up for the storyline. There had to be some actual time spent on explaining a thing or two before things could progress. The nudity, reminiscent of comedies from nearly a generation ago, was only something to hold your attention while they warmed the engine. It was as if Broken Lizard said, ""We apologize that our plot line is a little far-fetched. We have to jump through a few hoops and clear up some red tape before we can get going. Oh, here are some topless girls to help pass the time and make up for any inconvenience we may have caused."" And then the movie took off...This is such a stupid idea -- getting five guys together to compete in a secret beer-drinking competition in Germany -- that the strength had to be in the writing. And it was. The dialogue was great, the sight gags were great.Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske are Jan and Todd Wolfhouse, brothers and the descendents of the Germans which lead them to Beerfest. Jay Chandrasekhar plays Barry, a character who was the best at all drinking games in college. Jan and Todd find him a bit down on his luck when they ask him to join the team. Aside from directing the movie, I have to say that Jay is the most talented of the Broken Lizard team. Kevin Heffernan who is most beloved as ""Farva"" (Super Troopers) plays ""Landfill,"" the team's former competitive eater. (According to the credits, he also painted the portraits of Stolhanske and Soter that appear in the Beerfest arena.) Steve Lemme is single handedly (pun only slightly intended) responsible for the beginning of the hilarity in the movie.This is the perfect movie for me to want to say, ""Hey, remember the part when..."" and when you do, we share a laugh. I would love to recite the movie for you quote by quote, but obviously that would ruin it.The movie was very funny and I loved it. I'm not ashamed to admit when a movie makes me cry. During Beerfest I had tears streaming from my eyes. I have not laughed that hard in a long time. Beerfest had my face contorted in laughter until my cheeks hurt.

It's everything that makes Broken Lizard great condensed.Okay, now that the rest of them are gone and I'm preaching to the choir, it's everything that makes Broken Lizard great condensed. There's intensely stupid humor, consumption of mass quantities of alcohol (to the point where a disclaimer is attached to the beginning of the movie), gratuitous nudity, no small amount of toilet humor, and major stars whose appearances will leave you wondering ""how on Earth did he get roped into being in this piece of crap?"". Ah, Broken Lizard, how we love you.In this most recent (as I write this) offering from the Lizards, Todd (Erik Stolhanske) and Jan (Pete Soter) Wolfhouse travel to Germany to inter their grandfather's ashes in the family crypt. While there, they discover that their grandfather's family, from whom he fled as a young man (carrying the secret family beer recipe), are the driving force behind Beerfest, an underground Oktoberfest version of Fight Club. The brothers, prodigious drinkers both, enter the contest and are humbled by their German cousins, who laugh them out of the competition hall. Suitably fired up, the two vow to put together an American drinking team and return the next year to claim the title that is rightfully theirs. (Not surprisingly, the team is composed of the rest of the Lizard crew--Jay Chandresakhar, Kevin Heffernan, and Steve Lemme.) Meanwhile, the Germans have waited decades to get the secret family recipe back, and will do so at any cost.At heart, Beerfest is every dumb, inspirational sports movie you've ever seen, and the Lizards know how to both parody the tropes and use them to great effect. (Given the choice between this and Talladega Nights? Well, there is no choice, really.) And that's what Broken Lizard do best, the same way they did it to the slasher genre in Club Dread. And if you like that sort of parody, this should be right up your alley. *** ",3,Return of the Lizards!,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2098,"['Beerfest', 'Jay', 'Chandresakhar', '2006', 'First', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'read', 'rest', 'review', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fond', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'movies', 'then', 'means', 'skip', 'one', 'everything', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'great', 'condensed.Okay', 'now', 'rest', 'are', 'gone', ""'m"", 'preaching', 'choir', 'everything', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'great', 'condensed', 'intensely', 'stupid', 'humor', 'consumption', 'mass', 'quantities', 'alcohol', 'point', 'where', 'disclaimer', 'attached', 'beginning', 'movie', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'small', 'amount', 'toilet', 'humor', 'major', 'stars', 'appearances', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'how', 'Earth', 'did', 'get', 'roped', 'being', 'piece', 'crap', 'Ah', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'how', 'love', 'you.In', 'most', 'recent', 'write', 'offering', 'Lizards', 'Todd', 'Erik', 'Stolhanske', 'Jan', 'Pete', 'Soter', 'Wolfhouse', 'travel', 'Germany', 'inter', 'grandfather', 'ashes', 'family', 'crypt', 'there', 'discover', 'grandfather', 'family', 'whom', 'fled', 'young', 'man', 'carrying', 'secret', 'family', 'beer', 'recipe', 'are', 'driving', 'force', 'Beerfest', 'underground', 'Oktoberfest', 'version', 'Fight', 'Club', 'brothers', 'prodigious', 'drinkers', 'enter', 'contest', 'are', 'humbled', 'German', 'cousins', 'who', 'competition', 'hall', 'Suitably', 'fired', 'up', 'two', 'vow', 'put', 'together', 'American', 'drinking', 'team', 'return', 'next', 'year', 'claim', 'title', 'rightfully', 'theirs', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'team', 'composed', 'rest', 'Lizard', 'crew', 'Jay', 'Chandresakhar', 'Kevin', 'Heffernan', 'Steve', 'Lem', 'Meanwhile', 'Germans', 'have', 'waited', 'decades', 'get', 'secret', 'family', 'recipe', 'back', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'cost.At', 'heart', 'Beerfest', 'dumb', 'inspirational', 'sports', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Lizards', 'know', 'how', 'parody', 'tropes', 'use', 'great', 'effect', 'choice', 'Talladega', 'Nights', 'Well', 'choice', 'really', 'what', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'do', 'best', 'same', 'way', 'did', 'slasher', 'genre', 'Club', 'Dread', 'like', 'sort', 'parody', 'should', 'be', 'right', 'alley', '***']",N/A

All the signs of wasted youth are there - cut-rate acting, gratuitous T&A;, double-entendres as subtle as a bazooka . . . it all amounts to a colossal waste of time.But if you watch ""Beerfest"" after 1 am when you've pounded a few too many microbrews and eaten an extra three slices of pizza, then the movie is an epiphany:  there is truth to be found in the bottom of the pitcher you just finished with your best friends, no matter how drunk and stupid you all might be.  Dean Wormer may have been right that ""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son,"" but he may have missed the part that doing so could be pretty darn hilarious.Essentially spoofing ""Bloodsport,"" ""Enter the Dragon,"" and all those martial arts flicks where some rich flamboyant guy hosts a super-secret combat tournament, ""Beerfest"" is an excuse for the Broken Lizard guys to drink a lot of beer and get paid for it.  The plot is threadbare - two American guys try to return Grandpa's ashes to his homeland in Germany, only to learn that Grandpa allegedly stole a cherished German beer recipe when he came to the States.  And Grandma's actually a whore.And worst of all, Germans think Americans can drink beer with the big boys.And so we get versions of the great cliches in this type of movie - the Building the Team sequence when various guys with bizarre special ""moves"" come together; the Training Sequence, where bonding goes hand in hand with self-improvement; the Mocking Sequence, where the villains show up to push around the heroes, causing them to second-guess themselves; and finally, the Big Bad Comeuppance, where the heroes vanquish the villains.But this is a Broken Lizard film, so cliches are skewered as ridiculously as possible.  Watch for masturbating frogs, drinking ram urine as ""training,"" and even Jurgen Prochnow spoofing ""Das Boot"" so expertly that he would turn over in his own grave if he were dead.  JP is sufficient by himself to prove that Germans can be funny.Don't try to explain why this movie works so well in circumstances and not in others - it's just a fact.  Your wife may not understand why you have it on the DVD shelf, but when The Guys come over and see it shelved in between ""Hot Dog - The Movie"" and ""The Longest Yard"" (the Burt Reynolds version), they will nod knowingly and with approval.Prost!",3,More funny after 1 am with too much pizza and beer,1234569600,"02 14, 2009",2009,2484,"['watch', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'latest', 'sophomoric', 'opus', 'Beerfest', 'Saturday', 'night', '8', 'pm', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wonder', 'what', ""'ve"", 'made', 'life', 'signs', 'wasted', 'youth', 'are', 'there', 'cut-rate', 'acting', 'gratuitous', 'T', 'A', 'double-entendres', 'as', 'subtle', 'bazooka', 'amounts', 'colossal', 'waste', 'time.But', 'watch', 'Beerfest', '1', 'am', 'when', ""'ve"", 'pounded', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'microbrews', 'eaten', 'extra', 'three', 'slices', 'pizza', 'then', 'movie', 'epiphany', 'truth', 'be', 'found', 'bottom', 'pitcher', 'just', 'finished', 'best', 'friends', 'matter', 'how', 'drunk', 'stupid', 'might', 'be', 'Dean', 'Wormer', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'Fat', 'drunk', 'stupid', 'way', 'go', 'life', 'son', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'part', 'doing', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'hilarious.Essentially', 'spoofing', 'Bloodsport', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'martial', 'arts', 'flicks', 'where', 'rich', 'flamboyant', 'guy', 'super-secret', 'combat', 'tournament', 'Beerfest', 'excuse', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'drink', 'lot', 'beer', 'get', 'paid', 'plot', 'threadbare', 'two', 'American', 'guys', 'try', 'return', 'Grandpa', 'ashes', 'homeland', 'Germany', 'only', 'learn', 'Grandpa', 'allegedly', 'stole', 'cherished', 'German', 'beer', 'recipe', 'when', 'came', 'States', 'Grandma', 'actually', 'whore.And', 'worst', 'Germans', 'think', 'Americans', 'can', 'drink', 'beer', 'big', 'boys.And', 'get', 'versions', 'great', 'cliches', 'type', 'movie', 'Building', 'Team', 'sequence', 'when', 'various', 'guys', 'bizarre', 'special', 'moves', 'come', 'together', 'Training', 'Sequence', 'where', 'bonding', 'hand', 'hand', 'self-improvement', 'Mocking', 'Sequence', 'where', 'villains', 'show', 'up', 'push', 'around', 'heroes', 'causing', 'second-guess', 'finally', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Comeuppance', 'where', 'heroes', 'vanquish', 'villains.But', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'film', 'cliches', 'are', 'skewered', 'as', 'ridiculously', 'possible', 'Watch', 'masturbating', 'frogs', 'drinking', 'ram', 'urine', 'training', 'even', 'Jurgen', 'Prochnow', 'spoofing', 'Das', 'Boot', 'so', 'expertly', 'would', 'turn', 'over', 'own', 'grave', 'were', 'dead', 'JP', 'sufficient', 'prove', 'Germans', 'can', 'be', 'funny.Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'circumstances', 'not', 'others', 'just', 'fact', 'wife', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'have', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'when', 'Guys', 'come', 'see', 'shelved', 'Hot', 'Dog', 'Movie', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'version', 'will', 'nod', 'knowingly', 'approval.Prost']",N/A

When you lost 99% of your coin, at least you could enjoy about 14 10 ounce cups of the stuff to make you feel a little better, even though it was one of the absolute worst beers ever brewed.That is more enjoyment than anything in 'Beerfest'.  In fact, this might be the worst movie ever made.The mark of being one of the worst movies ever made is when it's supposed to be a slapstick comedy and the muscles in your face don't work once over the course of 1 hour and 45 minutes.  There wasn't one laugh in this movie unless you like seeing actors who aren't funny try to steal Mike Myer's formula for making fun of German's on 'Sprockets'.  He had talent, these guys do not.The plot is asinine, and the two lead actors are absolutely atrocious.  These guys never even drink any beer throughout the movie and then we're supposed to believe that they can compete with (and defeat) English, Scottish and German folks?Place your six year old kid in front of the tellie and maybe they will find nearly two hours of people belching hilarious.

If you're with a bunch of guys and you all like to drink, this comedy induces such a euphoric blast.  I've seen the other Broken Lizard movies and I'm really let down by them when I compare them to Beerfest.  Beerfest is top notch comedy that barely ever has an unfunny moment.  Super Troopers and especially Club Dread felt a little bit dry, but this film is exciting and hilarious.Not only do we have the comedy troupe performing at the top of their game, but the supporting cast almost outstages them.  The Germans are outstanding comedians, some of them body-builders, and the two amazing actors, Will Forte and Nat Faxon tear up the stage.  This movie romps because of it's incredible cast and it's easily applicable subject matter.  Who couldn't have fun with a beer comedy? Don't answer that question.Bottom Line: Beerfest is a lot of fun, and is a must watch for any group of guys.  It defies that stereotype of low budget comedy films selling on the promise of sexuality.  They may have a cover that labels them as another ""Sex Drive"" or an awful American Pie spinoff, but this is true comedy.  It's cheap on Amazon, so grab this and some cheap beer and you will definately have a fun night.  It's too bad they can't duplicate their efforts in another film, but Broken Lizard does have one comedic masterpiece.",5,Broken Lizard's Best,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,1391,"['Beerfest', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'theaters', ""'re"", 'bunch', 'guys', 'all', 'drink', 'comedy', 'induces', 'such', 'euphoric', 'blast', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'movies', ""'m"", 'really', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'compare', 'Beerfest', 'Beerfest', 'top', 'notch', 'comedy', 'barely', 'ever', 'unfunny', 'moment', 'Super', 'Troopers', 'especially', 'Club', 'Dread', 'felt', 'little', 'bit', 'dry', 'film', 'exciting', 'hilarious.Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'comedy', 'troupe', 'performing', 'top', 'game', 'supporting', 'cast', 'almost', 'Germans', 'are', 'outstanding', 'comedians', 'body-builders', 'two', 'amazing', 'actors', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Nat', 'Faxon', 'tear', 'up', 'stage', 'movie', 'incredible', 'cast', 'easily', 'applicable', 'subject', 'matter', 'Who', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'fun', 'beer', 'comedy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'answer', 'question.Bottom', 'Line', 'Beerfest', 'lot', 'fun', 'must', 'watch', 'group', 'guys', 'stereotype', 'low', 'budget', 'comedy', 'films', 'selling', 'promise', 'sexuality', 'may', 'have', 'cover', 'Sex', 'Drive', 'awful', 'American', 'Pie', 'spinoff', 'true', 'comedy', 'cheap', 'Amazon', 'so', 'grab', 'cheap', 'beer', 'will', 'definately', 'have', 'fun', 'night', 'too', 'bad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'duplicate', 'efforts', 'film', 'Broken', 'Lizard', 'have', 'one', 'comedic', 'masterpiece']",N/A
