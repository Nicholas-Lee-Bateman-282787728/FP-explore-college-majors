789250,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B0000YTOKI,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[4, 5]","I wasn't expecting much when I rented this movie but I sure got a pleasant surprise. Danny DeVito is a true master of the wicked-old-lady-that-must-be-destroyed genre. Unlike the monstrous Momma in Throw Momma From The Train, the elderly tenant in Duplex could almost be likeable, and she is certainly more believable (I'm sure most of us have met and eldster like this at some point in our lives). She seems to spend the whole film sublimely unaware of how annoying she is, and the actress (whoever she is) ought to be congratulated on how convincingly she played the part.As the film progresses we come to learn that she is the tenant from hell - and each new horror she foists upon Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore's Alex and Nancy confirms it all the more. Their desperate attempts to cope with her as she ratchets up the pressure are almost as hilarious as their ham-fisted attempts to do away with her. Obviously, they haven't got a chance because they are just too darn nice, and as a result, the old lady makes mincemeat of them in a series of almost Loony Toon style ""get the rabbit"" schemes. I half expected to see ACME on the side of some of the items in their arsenal.Ben Stiller was at his best playing his typical poor-downtrodden-loser part as he has done in almost every film since ""There's Something About Mary."" Drew Barrymore was actually likeable as the sweet always-look-on-the-bright-side wife.I'm not sure why this film got so many bad reviews. Myself, I was barely able to breath I was laughing so hard. By the end I was doubled over and my face hurt. I know that the film wasn't Shakespere, but it was a million times better than ""Along Came Polly"" which, for some reason, was given more playtime and seemed to be better accepted by moviegoers. I know there were a lot of scenes that had really vile content (chewed up sausages, rotting noodles, vomit and saturation sneezing) but it was all very tastefully done (in comparison to others I've seen) and for the most part really funny. All I can say is, give this movie a chance - maybe it won't work for you, but you're bound to find something you'll like.",5,Another Great Evil Old Lady Movie From Danny DeVito,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2129,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'rented', 'movie', 'sure', 'got', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'true', 'master', 'wicked-old-lady-that-must-be-destroyed', 'genre', 'monstrous', 'Momma', 'Throw', 'Momma', 'Train', 'elderly', 'tenant', 'Duplex', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'likeable', 'certainly', 'more', 'believable', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'have', 'met', 'eldster', 'point', 'lives', 'spend', 'whole', 'film', 'sublimely', 'unaware', 'how', 'annoying', 'actress', 'ought', 'be', 'congratulated', 'how', 'convincingly', 'played', 'part.As', 'film', 'come', 'learn', 'tenant', 'hell', 'new', 'horror', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Alex', 'Nancy', 'more', 'desperate', 'attempts', 'cope', 'up', 'pressure', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'hilarious', 'ham-fisted', 'attempts', 'do', 'away', 'Obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'chance', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'darn', 'nice', 'result', 'old', 'lady', 'mincemeat', 'series', 'almost', 'Loony', 'Toon', 'style', 'get', 'rabbit', 'schemes', 'half', 'expected', 'see', 'ACME', 'side', 'items', 'arsenal.Ben', 'Stiller', 'was', 'best', 'playing', 'typical', 'poor-downtrodden-loser', 'part', 'done', 'almost', 'film', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'actually', 'likeable', 'sweet', 'always-look-on-the-bright-side', 'wife.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'was', 'barely', 'able', 'breath', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'end', 'was', 'doubled', 'face', 'hurt', 'know', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'Shakespere', 'was', 'million', 'times', 'better', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'reason', 'was', 'given', 'more', 'playtime', 'seemed', 'be', 'better', 'accepted', 'moviegoers', 'know', 'were', 'lot', 'scenes', 'had', 'really', 'vile', 'content', 'chewed', 'up', 'sausages', 'rotting', 'noodles', 'vomit', 'saturation', 'sneezing', 'was', 'very', 'tastefully', 'done', 'comparison', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'funny', 'can', 'say', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', ""'re"", 'bound', 'find', 'something', ""'ll"", 'like']",Duplex

And that information is saved until the end.  The reason the film didn't work for me was because I could always feel the film building to something at the end which I felt betrayed by.  Why do I feel betrayed?  I just don't believe the actions that happened in the movie were portrayed with enough weight to make the actions even an exaggeration of reality, it just felt like their hatred of the old woman came too easy.  That means the ending didn't work for me as well, but there were some funny moments and I won't go into them because they were such a small speck on a dreadful experience for me.  I could tell when they were reaching for a laugh, a more appropriate word for this would be straining.  It's this straining that took me out of the film.  It could have been a straighead black comedy and tried to correctly work the emotions, but it doesn't and sidesteps it at the end.  As a result it was a ripoff, in my opinion.  I think Devito may be losing his touch as a director after the abysmal ""Death to Smoochy.""  He may be laughing, but what about the audience that he created this for.  I don't know, it just didn't work for me because I could predict what was going to happen, I was looking forward in the story because what was going on presently wasn't good enough to sustain my interest.

They found a terrific place in Brooklyn, but it comes with an elderly woman who lives in the upstairs apartment. They buy the building and become her new landlord.The premise of the movie is that they want to try to get the old lady out of the apartment. Obviously she refuses and that's where the story really takes off.What promises to be a friendly old lady soon becomes an annoyance. While Barrymore is at work as a graphic designer in a magazine, Stiller tries to enjoy his new office to finish his 2nd book. If he doesn't, the publisher will cancel his contract.One thing after another follows Stiller and Barrymore until they seriously consider ending the life of their dear upstairs neighbor. The ending is very funny when all is revealed.It is somewhat predictable, but I really enjoyed this movie. The chemistry between Stiller and Barrymore is solid.

A movie starring Ben Stiller usually marks a hot, comedy success, and I'd say that to his movies such as &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; and &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.  However, all comedians tend to have at least one movie that's fails to pay the bill on humor.  Richard Pryor has his with &quot;Superman III&quot;, and Ben Stiller has his with &quot;Duplex&quot;, a movie that made a mediocre comedy like &quot;Zoolander&quot; seems like &quot;Monty Python's Holy Grail&quot;.Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore were newlyweds who just owned a Duplex(surprised?) in the Brooklyn neighborhood.  There, it lived an old Irish woman on the upper level of the Duplex who's &quot;delighted&quot; to see new landlords.  Courtesies and friendly greetings aside, its looks as though the couple will get used to the easy life as Ben would finish his second novel and Drew would be a more out-going as both a wife and a decorator, but they haven't a clue that living with the nice old lady would eventually bring them hell.  The old lady starts asking Ben to help around her room while he was doing his novel in a strict deadline, fixing the bathroom pipes and consuming dozens of hours of escorting the lady to the pharmacy, counting prescribed pills.  Drew, later, takes his place to share the torture.  Exhausted and peeved, Ben eventually loses his book deal, Drew loses her job at some newsletter business, and since their troubles came from the old lady's ranting, they decided to off her for good.This may sound like a good dark comedy by paper, but in its final product, this slapstick movie is really a punch in the face.  I found nothing funny about this movie.  Some of its sick humor, like the vomiting scene, was unnecessary and tedious.  In all honestly,  the whole movie really upset me.  Don't get the wrong idea to think that I don't get dark comedy.  I watch Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, and shows like Mad TV, these were funny in the dark comedy genre.  I can't say the same for this movie, it just isn't.  There's little humor that I haven't seen already and the deliveries were spastic.  The one thing in that REALLY got my knickers in a twist is the ending of this movie, which I didn't see it coming, and all the better to breaks this movie in two.Let's see:  it's not funny, it's insulting, and there's hardly any extras on this DVD.  This movie got me, got me questioning, &quot;Where is the love?&quot;  Danny Devito just overdid himself directing this flick, and because of that, I failed to see any humor in this movie, I failed to find any enlightening about this movie, and I failed to make any kind of recommendation for this to anybody.

They don't ""earn"" it. I just didn't buy it. And all the smothering, harpooning, and booby-trapping that follows.Kendricks especially doesn't feel right because Berrymore is miscast. Stiller is perfect for the movie. He's excellent at characters who barely suppress rage. It makes sense Rose would snap. But Berrymore plays characters who are light and optimistic, despite all the bad things that have happened to her. It's that tension between her simplicity now and her dark, complex past that creates laughs (see ""Charlie's Angels"").But it's the script that's the biggest failure. It feels like a pastiche of funny moments loosely based on an amusing premise. The scenes don't lead well into one another. It's stilted and unbelievable. It jolted me from the movie, made me aware I was watching a movie. But what did we expect from screenwriter Larry Doyle, whose credits before this comprise ""The Simpsons"" and ""Beavis and Butt-Head""?

789285,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0000YTOKI,Lawyeraau,"[4, 5]","I recently flew to Seattle, and this was the in-flight film. I was intrigued, as I had never heard of it, and I enjoy Ben Stiller's movies. Moreover, this one was directed by Danny DeVito, and I had loved what he did with &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;. So, I settled down to watch what I thought might be a somewhat dark comedy. After watching it, I decided that this film was chosen for in-flight viewing, as the audience was a captive one and could not leave. Had I seen it in the theatre, I am sure I would have been witness to people leaving mid-film. To add insult to injury, this film was the same one shown on the return flight.The plot is simple. A young couple, Alex and Nancy, buy their dream home, a large and lovely  apartment in a turn of the century brownstone in Brooklyn. Replete with period detail, they fall in love with it, probably paying more than they should. The good thing is that the price includes an upper apartment, which is also part of the deal and would convert their apartment into a duplex. The only caveat is that the upper apartment is rented by an ancient  crone, Mrs. Connelly, who pays under a hundred dollars a month in rent, as the apartment is rent controlled.Still, they love the apartment so much that they buy it anyway, figuring that the tenant, whom they met, would not be there much longer due to her age and seeming ill health. Once they move in, however, Mrs. Connelly appears to have recovered her health and turns out to be quite an active and spry old woman who seems determined, in her own sweet way, to make the lives of the new owners a living hell on earth. Alex and Nancy hurry and scurry to meet their tenant's insatiable demands, which wreak havoc with their personal lives. This compels them to resort to various ways of getting her to move, all of which she seemingly resists without batting an eyelash. Finally, the harried, beleaguered couple is driven to seek a more permanent solution to their landlord/tenant problem.The film was clearly meant to be a dark comedy. It was dark, alright, because most everyone associated with it seems to have lost their way, but there is nothing really comedic about it. Ben Stiller's performance is strained, as he must have recognized early on that this film was not particularly funny. Drew Barrymore sleepwalks through her role as if she were on thorazine to quell any potentially psychotic behavior should she realize the turkey of a film in which she was acting. Harvey Fierstein manages to be annoying in the small, but pivotal, role of the real estate agent, while Swoosie Kurtz plays her role straight, rather than for laughs, and manages to avoid personal embarrassment.  The only real saving  grace is the performance by veteran British television thespian, Eileen Essel, in the role of Mrs. Connelly. She is the only reason the film warranted a rating of even two stars. Ms. Essel, however, must surely have a contract out on her agent for inducing her to make her feature film debut in this flop.",2,DANNY DEVITO TAKES A DIVE WITH THIS ONE...,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,3011,"['recently', 'flew', 'Seattle', 'was', 'in-flight', 'film', 'was', 'intrigued', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'enjoy', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'movies', 'Moreover', 'one', 'was', 'directed', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'had', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'quot', 'War', 'Roses', 'quot', 'settled', 'down', 'watch', 'what', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dark', 'comedy', 'watching', 'decided', 'film', 'was', 'chosen', 'in-flight', 'viewing', 'audience', 'was', 'captive', 'one', 'could', 'not', 'leave', 'Had', 'seen', 'theatre', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'witness', 'people', 'leaving', 'mid-film', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'film', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'shown', 'return', 'flight.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'young', 'couple', 'Alex', 'Nancy', 'buy', 'dream', 'home', 'large', 'lovely', 'apartment', 'turn', 'century', 'brownstone', 'Brooklyn', 'Replete', 'period', 'detail', 'fall', 'love', 'probably', 'paying', 'more', 'should', 'good', 'thing', 'price', 'upper', 'apartment', 'also', 'part', 'deal', 'would', 'convert', 'apartment', 'duplex', 'only', 'caveat', 'upper', 'apartment', 'rented', 'ancient', 'crone', 'Mrs.', 'Connelly', 'who', 'hundred', 'dollars', 'month', 'rent', 'apartment', 'rent', 'controlled.Still', 'love', 'apartment', 'so', 'much', 'buy', 'anyway', 'figuring', 'tenant', 'whom', 'met', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'much', 'longer', 'due', 'age', 'seeming', 'ill', 'health', 'move', 'however', 'Mrs.', 'Connelly', 'have', 'recovered', 'health', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'active', 'spry', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'determined', 'own', 'sweet', 'way', 'make', 'lives', 'new', 'owners', 'living', 'hell', 'earth', 'Alex', 'Nancy', 'hurry', 'scurry', 'meet', 'tenant', 'insatiable', 'demands', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'personal', 'lives', 'resort', 'various', 'ways', 'getting', 'move', 'seemingly', 'batting', 'eyelash', 'Finally', 'harried', 'beleaguered', 'couple', 'driven', 'seek', 'more', 'permanent', 'solution', 'landlord/tenant', 'problem.The', 'film', 'was', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'dark', 'comedy', 'was', 'dark', 'alright', 'most', 'everyone', 'associated', 'have', 'lost', 'way', 'nothing', 'really', 'comedic', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'performance', 'strained', 'must', 'have', 'recognized', 'early', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'funny', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'sleepwalks', 'role', 'were', 'thorazine', 'quell', 'potentially', 'psychotic', 'behavior', 'should', 'realize', 'turkey', 'film', 'was', 'acting', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'be', 'annoying', 'small', 'pivotal', 'role', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'role', 'straight', 'rather', 'laughs', 'avoid', 'personal', 'embarrassment', 'only', 'real', 'saving', 'grace', 'performance', 'veteran', 'British', 'television', 'thespian', 'Eileen', 'Essel', 'role', 'Mrs.', 'Connelly', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'warranted', 'rating', 'even', 'two', 'stars', 'Ms.', 'Essel', 'however', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'contract', 'out', 'agent', 'inducing', 'make', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'flop']",Duplex

Not having too much money, they decide to invest in an income property, so they buy a duplex with a little old lady living on the second floor. She cannot be kicked out because of rent control, but since she is so old, the couple figure she will die soon anyway, and if she doesn't, well, a sweet old lady can't cause much trouble anyway, right?... Wrong. Once they move in, the old lady bugs them - CONSTANTLY - so the couple try to get her kicked out via various methods. They also try to find ways to deal with her while she's living there such as the fact that her TV is loud, so the husband buys a clapper and tries to use it to turn the TV off when they think the old lady is sleeping. Somehow, the lady is savvy, and just claps, so clapping goes back and forth.The ending reveals a few surprises about the old lady - but a couple of them felt rather unwelcome. The old lady is basically part of a scam, I wish the ending would have been different, so I could only give it a 3.

789295,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B0000YTOKI,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[2, 3]","I bought this film simply because I liked Drew Barrymore's hair on the cover. I like fringes, she looked cute with hers, and I seriously considered getting mine cut back in. But I won't. I've just finished growing it out.I loved the cartoon start to this, although was unimpressed with Danny DeVito's narrative. Why did he need to do a narrative? Just because he directed it, but couldn't be bothered to actually get in front of the camera, doesn't mean he needs to reinforce to the viewers that he directed, by doing a narrative.I actually liked Drew Barrymore in this movie as she's a terrific actress. Sometimes her hair can be a bit too brassy & platinum, but in this, it was the perfect shade. Ben Stiller's not bad - he's turning into Adam Sandler, and I often get the two muddled up. Plus, is it just me, or do they look really similar? Ben's character Alex is really sweet, when he gets teased about taking a nap during the day, simply because he got kept up the night before! Plus, Frank Hilliard from Mrs Doubtfire also appears as the estate agent!I'm not keen on how all blurbs say Alex (Alan) and Nancy want to kill their upstairs neighbour (Eileen Essel - who any Ali G fans might just recognise from Indahouse) - it's a very gradual, and only comes about in the last part of the movie. The neighbour an Irish woman, who claims her husband died years ago, after 58 years marriage, looks positively ancient by this point. She plays her television very loud all night long, leaving Alex & Nancy with no sleep & no love life either, and she called Alex Alan, and then claims she doesn't forget names.By the end of the movie, you will be fantasising about doing away with the sweet old lady too. Eileen is simply wonderful as the alternately appealing and excruciating tenant. She has the sweet old lady bit down pat to the point where you'll feel guilty for thinking about killing her yourself! Ben, Drew & Eileen have great chemistry, although there's some very crude scenes, including seeing an old woman get undressed and a vomit scene, that should have been left to the likes of American Pie standards.The film ends on a difficult note - Danny DeVito doesn't seem too sure how to tie it all up, and it's not the most memorable ending of movies. There's also your now standard Hollywood twist in the tale which doesn't come together easily, but is glaringly obvious when you remember the movie.I loved the Macaw (which is a parrot by the way), and it should have been included more in the movie, cos it caused some hilarious moments, simply just by being there.I can imagine quite a few people won't enjoy this movie, but I enjoyed it in the couple of hours I had to spare before I had to go out into the cold and slip on the ice to get to work.

The duplex is everything they could have hoped for, especially since the second floor will make the perfect nursery, but there is one little problem... the elderly woman living on the second floor.  But, as Fierstein explains of the woman's age and failing health, Alex and Nancy decide they can live with the tenant while they try to get pregnant.Upon moving in the building the elderly neighbor is sweet and kind, but things soon change.  Alex begins work on his new novel, complete with a short deadline, but his work day is constantly interrupted with requests by his neighbor.

Instead, the movie is about the frustration of dealing with this difficult tenant, to the point that the young couple wishes they could kill her, and almost go crazy trying not to---a very different thing.  Everyone has probably felt frustration like this about one thing or another, and that's part of what makes the movie so funny---you can identify with things you've gone really nuts over.

Or so they think...for, unfortunately, the place also comes replete with what turns out to be the tenant from hell, a doddering old woman who lives on the second floor and who makes life miserable for the two of them with her continually blaring television and her constant intrusions into their daily lives.  Finally driven to the breaking point, Alex and Nancy decide to take matters into their own hands in order to rid themselves of this human pest in any way they can.""Duplex"" is, essentially, a one-joke comedy and, as such, it does suffer from the occupational hazard common to all one-joke comedies of built-in repetitiousness.  However, the writing has a surprisingly dark edge to it that lifts the film above the run-of-the-Hollywood-comedy-mill.  I must confess to having a certain weakness for dotty old lady comedies, counting among my favorite films the original British classic ""The Lady killers"" from 1955.  Eileen Essel is so delightful as the bete noire of the piece that it's hard not to fall under the spell of both her character and the film itself.  De Vito, in a return to the black comedy form that served him so well in ""The War of the Roses,"" keeps the comedy tough and brutal, even if it means bludgeoning the audience over the head a bit in the process.  Stiller does his usual shtick as the put-upon Everyman, while Barrymore is able to use her customary cutesiness to full advantage as the sweet little ingenue driven to murder to save her own sanity.""Duplex"" is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, and I imagine that it would not win the stamp of approval from the AARP.

789318,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000YTOKI,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 10]","Probably the best effort from Danny DeVito as director would be 'Throw Momma from the Train' or 'The War of the Roses,' the latter being the ultimate battle of sex between Kathleen Turner and Micheal Douglas.  'Roses' was marred by occasional overdirection and presence of DeVito himself as lawyer, but certainly it was funny.  But those films were made back in the 80s, when he was in the prime.  With an exception of so-so 'Hoffa,' Danny DeVito has been doing the same pattern -- making comedies based on the battle between bickering characters.Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore (who are also co-producers of the film) play a married couple moving into a duplex.  For the reasons I do not know and do not care, the old lady (who must be more than 80 years old) living in the upper room starts annoying them, making big noises in the middle of the night for starters.  The ""battle"" begins between the owners and the tennant (even the clever old lady has a nice trick of smiling before the young couple), and the more fierce the battle gets, the funnier the film becomes.  That's how DeVito must have thought.  Just like 15 years ago, in 'The War of the Roses.'[JUST AWFUL] The results are awful mess, however.  Most of the situations are plain impossible; the stars are charmless; amd most of all, their bahaviors are not merely stupid, but predictable.  Ben Stiller does the same kind of character again, grumbling, always uptight and easily is persuaded to do something he never wants to do.  Drew Barrymore is nice and sweet to everyone, but her sweetness is there fot the director to make some goofy scenes later (like her 'funny' hair formed by 'electricity').  And veteran Eileen Essell, who, with all respect, is so hammy at times that I still am not sure she really thinks that this is not a comedy, but a serious BBC drama or something.  In short, she is devoid of the magic that is needed to make those potentially offensive characters charming to see.In short, for the majority of the viewers, 'Duplex' is not funny; even by any standard of so-called dark humor, it is terribly unfunny and unpleasant to see.  I found his comedy style pretty funny back in the 80s, but obviously it's time he quit.

He manages to create humor from characters that are struggling with their consequences.

But the duplex comes with conditions that unfold as the movie progresses. Living above the young couple is an old Irish lady (brilliantly played by Eileen Essel) who creates all sorts of comedic havoc. Appearing sweet and innocently feeble she irritates and riles her landlords with the blare of her TV, constant calls for assistance and a many more silly moments that will leave you in stitches. The young couple is driven crazy and that only leads to additional antics well written and as funny as can be.Stiller and Barrymore are perfectly cast as the young couple with Stiller stealing most of the scenes with his neurotic, paranoid and defensive acting. Just his facial expressions alone are enough to rob you of a few laughs. But the star of the movie is Eileen Essel who has an unending sense of humor and natural comedic energy that rivals Stiller's. Beside Essel is a macaw that adds a bit of animal life to the scenes and flaps about with additional value. Leave it to DeVito to add a bit of a dark twist at the end.
