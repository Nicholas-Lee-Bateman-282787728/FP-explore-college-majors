Beverly Hills factory worker Dreyfuss spots Jerry,the homeless man,one day while driving to work. Outspoken Midler refused to welcome Jerry but with her husband's persuasion,she reverses her decision. Bearded Jerry is shaved down to a moustache and he begins to enjoy his new life in the Beverly Hills mansion he now shares with the couple. One memorable scene is where a party is thrown and Little Richard Penniman,as himself,provides music on the piano(like he does professionally). Jerry ends up fed up living in the mansion that he decides to return to vagabond life. That decision is later reversed. Director Paul Mazursky is a very good friend of Dreyfuss's and Midler's and in fact,they,on separate occasions,would do more films together(MOON OVER PARADOR starring Dreyfuss and SCENES FROM A MALL starring Woody Allen and Midler).",5,"Richard,Bette and Nick deliver Oscar-worthy performances!",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1027,"['Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'deliver', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', '1986', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'comedy', 'wealthy', 'couple', 'Dreyfuss', 'Midler', 'who', 'take', 'homeless', 'man', 'Nolte', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'factory', 'worker', 'Dreyfuss', 'spots', 'Jerry', 'homeless', 'man', 'one', 'day', 'driving', 'work', 'Outspoken', 'Midler', 'refused', 'welcome', 'Jerry', 'husband', 'persuasion', 'decision', 'Bearded', 'Jerry', 'shaved', 'down', 'moustache', 'enjoy', 'new', 'life', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'mansion', 'now', 'shares', 'couple', 'One', 'memorable', 'scene', 'where', 'party', 'thrown', 'Little', 'Richard', 'Penniman', 'music', 'piano', 'professionally', 'Jerry', 'up', 'fed', 'up', 'living', 'mansion', 'return', 'vagabond', 'life', 'decision', 'later', 'reversed', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'very', 'good', 'friend', 'Dreyfuss', 'Midler', 'fact', 'separate', 'occasions', 'would', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'together', 'MOON', 'OVER', 'PARADOR', 'starring', 'Dreyfuss', 'SCENES', 'FROM', 'A', 'MALL', 'starring', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Midler']",N/A

I must admit, I often see homeless people and wonder what they would look like if given a new haircut, a bath, and a set of clothes, and cinema has given us some good transformation scenes of this type over the years. Where Nick Nolte excels is that his greying (real) beard just looks so scuzzy (he lived on the streets for a efew weeks before starting filming) yet once clean-shaven with just a moustache he looks really good. He is helped by a very fit body, with no sores or bruises, which is perhaps not so realistic. Nolte's performance in the role vindicates Paul Mazursky's decision to cast him in the role, something studio bosses were cynical about in view of his trouble with alcoholism. Similar reservations were voiced about co-stars Richard Dreyfuss and Bette Midler, yet all three turn in really good and funny performances. There is a great guest appearance from Little Richard, who also performs a couple of numbers in the film.This seems dated now, but not in a bad way. The hair salon scene and the son's new romantic pop group remind us of the worst excesses of 1980s style, while the remainder of the film reminds us of what we were really like in those days, with our over-reliance on fads (the guru, the dog psychologist, the radio psychologist) and neglect of important issues like homelessness and our own children.Above all, this is an enjoyable, thought-provoking comedy.If you can find it, I would also recommend the book by Ian Marter.",5,For some reason I really like this film!,1032220800,"09 17, 2002",2002,1575,"['story', 'tramp', 'who', 'way', 'household', 'rich', 'family', 'gradually', 'changes', 'lives', 'must', 'admit', 'often', 'see', 'homeless', 'people', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'look', 'given', 'new', 'haircut', 'bath', 'set', 'clothes', 'cinema', 'given', 'good', 'transformation', 'scenes', 'type', 'years', 'Where', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'excels', 'greying', 'real', 'beard', 'just', 'so', 'scuzzy', 'lived', 'streets', 'efew', 'weeks', 'starting', 'filming', 'yet', 'once', 'clean-shaven', 'just', 'moustache', 'really', 'good', 'helped', 'very', 'fit', 'body', 'sores', 'bruises', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'realistic', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'role', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'decision', 'cast', 'role', 'something', 'studio', 'bosses', 'were', 'cynical', 'view', 'trouble', 'alcoholism', 'Similar', 'reservations', 'were', 'voiced', 'co-stars', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'yet', 'three', 'turn', 'really', 'good', 'funny', 'performances', 'great', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Little', 'Richard', 'who', 'also', 'couple', 'numbers', 'film.This', 'dated', 'now', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'hair', 'salon', 'scene', 'son', 'new', 'romantic', 'pop', 'group', 'remind', 'worst', 'excesses', '1980s', 'style', 'remainder', 'film', 'what', 'were', 'really', 'like', 'days', 'over-reliance', 'fads', 'guru', 'dog', 'psychologist', 'radio', 'psychologist', 'neglect', 'important', 'issues', 'homelessness', 'own', 'children.Above', 'enjoyable', 'thought-provoking', 'comedy.If', 'can', 'find', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'book', 'Ian', 'Marter']",N/A

240552,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,630027649X,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[12, 12]","After more than 15 years, this comedy still elicits huge laughs and the primary reason for that is it's sharp.  It bites.  No comedy can last through the years without some noticeable degree of sharp social irreverence built into it.  It just can't be done.  And this comedy is nothing if not irreverent.Based on the '30s French farce Boudu Saved from Drowning, the American director Paul Mazursky does a terrific job of fusing stinging satire with mock pathos as Nick Nolte's street bum Jerry, having lost the last thing important to him--his dog--decides to end it once and for all.  Stumbling into the upper crustean Beverly Hills, he manages to locate a swimming pool at whose bottom he decides to meet his maker.  The pool, as it happens, belongs to Richard Dreyfuss' Dave Whiteman, a very wealthy wire hanger mogul, and his daffy wife played by Bette Midler.Dave's maid, the always fetching Elizabeth Pena, is playing hanky-panky with Dave, yet Dave is not without a heart.  He catches sight of Jerry right after his plunge and rescues him, and the rest, as they say, is hysterical.Everybody, as it happens, winds up loving Jerry--Dave's wife, Dave's maid, Dave's dog, Dave's son, and Dave's daughter.  And even Dave himself.  What 'love' means here depends on who is doing the loving.  Dave's neighbor is Little Richard who can't help but toss in a couple of his songs here and there, which adds to the romp that is this film.  Jerry manages to teach just about everybody a thing or two about life--even the dog learns how to eat regular dog food from him.These days, as the rich get slightly--but not a lot--less rich, and the poor definitely get poorer, it's refreshing to see a comedy that irreverently laces into both.  This really refers to class under attack here, and that word has more than one meaning.  Social class, what we think of as class (as in 'a class act'), and what we learn from each other (it's Jerry who leads the class--he's the real teacher here) all get the treatment.A great satire well worth watching, if not owning.

As such, it's got a solid basis upon which to build a movie.What is presented is a mildly amusing soft-hearted satire of contemporary life among the rich who spend more time self-analyzing than most people working. Richard Dreyfuss is fine as the suddenly successful manufacturer and Bette Midler is perfect as the suddenly rich spouse trying to put too many pieces together at the same time. Nick Nolte is the ""down and out"" (?) visitor who is saved from drowning in their swimming pool. He immediately becomes all things to all the neurotics involved. It's an obvious plotline which follows.In a scene seemingly derived from Mazursky's earlier ""I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!"", the madness culminates in a big party. Next door neighbor Little Richard, as the decidedly flambouyant Orvis Goodnight, gets down on piano and rocks out on the uptemo ""Great Gosh A'Mighty"" [a successful single for LR in '86, by the way]. It's a fun scene, but it's shot too much like a video and the music is not up front. Richard does a nice job in an earlier scene which does not involve music. He appears suddenly in Dreyfuss' backyard, raving about the kind of emergency help available for whites as opposed to blacks. The racial overtones seem dated here, as they do in scenes with Nolte and the domestic help.The movie has an under-developed air about it, like Mazursky's ""The Pickle"" and the above mentioned ""...Alice B. Toklas"". The viewer wants to be challenged into deciding if the suicide attempt was a put-on by Nolte so as to hang with rick folks for a while.

Paul Mazursky's ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" does neither.The play from which ""DOBH"" is adapted had been previously filmed by Jean Renoir (""Boudu Saved from Drowning""). It's considered a classic (though I'm not sure I completely agree), but it's a heck of a lot better than ""the Disney version"". (Ouch!)In the original, Boudu is a demented, possibly psychotic bum who, after his dog runs off, decides to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge into the Seine. He's rescued by a middle-class book dealer who decides to clean up the guy and introduce him to middle-class values. Of course, just the opposite occurs. Boudu is an id-monster who makes a shambles of the bookseller's home and life (including seducing his wife). He winds up marrying the maid (whom the bookseller had been regularly porking), but falls off the rowboat in which they're riding after the ceremony. He's presumed dead, but floats to shore and continues his crazy journey through life. (This makes the film seem a bit better than it actually is. ""Boudu"" suffers badly from the technical limitations of 1932 French films.)Mazursky destroys the point of the original by turning Boudu into an articulate, educated man who (as the character says) tells people what they want to hear. The effect he has on the household is thus ""transformative"", rather than ""disruptive"". And instead of returning to street life (which it's been made clear he prefers to the nouveau-riche lifestyle of the Whitemans), he decides to remain. If Mazursky is trying to suggest that the modern Boudu has been corrupted by the bourgeois lifestyle, he doesn't make it very clear /why/. The final scene is downright sappy, a ""happy ending"" designed to appease the audience.There are two good things about ""DOBH"", though. One is Mike, who plays ""Matisse"", the Whitemans' dog. If you thought Mushroom was great in ""Back to the Future"" and ""Gremlins"" (which, by the way, tips its hat to ""Boudu""), wait until you see Mike.The other good thing is the opportunity to view Nick Nolte's nekkid butt. Twice. Mazursky gives us sufficient screen time to enjoy the view, and it's worth every second (if you're into that sort of thing).Not Recommended, unless you wish to compare/contrast with ""Boudu Saved from Drowning"".",2,Yet another unnecessary remake...,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,2462,"['review', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'King', 'Kong', 'remarked', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'remake', 'film', 'something', 'wrong', 'original', 'fixing', 'one', 'found', 'new', 'take', 'material', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'Down', 'Out', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'neither.The', 'play', 'DOBH', 'adapted', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'filmed', 'Jean', 'Renoir', 'Boudu', 'Saved', 'Drowning', 'considered', 'classic', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'completely', 'agree', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'Disney', 'version', 'Ouch', 'original', 'Boudu', 'demented', 'possibly', 'psychotic', 'bum', 'who', 'dog', 'decides', 'commit', 'suicide', 'jumping', 'off', 'bridge', 'Seine', 'rescued', 'middle-class', 'book', 'dealer', 'who', 'clean', 'up', 'guy', 'introduce', 'middle-class', 'values', 'course', 'just', 'opposite', 'occurs', 'Boudu', 'id-monster', 'who', 'shambles', 'bookseller', 'home', 'life', 'including', 'seducing', 'wife', 'up', 'marrying', 'maid', 'whom', 'bookseller', 'had', 'been', 'regularly', 'porking', 'off', 'rowboat', ""'re"", 'riding', 'ceremony', 'presumed', 'dead', 'floats', 'shore', 'crazy', 'journey', 'life', 'film', 'seem', 'bit', 'better', 'actually', 'Boudu', 'suffers', 'badly', 'technical', 'limitations', '1932', 'French', 'films', 'Mazursky', 'point', 'original', 'turning', 'Boudu', 'articulate', 'educated', 'man', 'who', 'character', 'people', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'effect', 'household', 'thus', 'transformative', 'rather', 'disruptive', 'instead', 'returning', 'street', 'life', 'been', 'made', 'clear', 'nouveau-riche', 'lifestyle', 'Whitemans', 'remain', 'Mazursky', 'trying', 'suggest', 'modern', 'Boudu', 'been', 'corrupted', 'bourgeois', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'clear', '/why/', 'final', 'scene', 'downright', 'sappy', 'happy', 'ending', 'designed', 'appease', 'audience.There', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'things', 'DOBH', 'though', 'One', 'Mike', 'who', 'Matisse', 'Whitemans', 'dog', 'thought', 'Mushroom', 'was', 'great', 'Back', 'Future', 'Gremlins', 'way', 'hat', 'Boudu', 'wait', 'see', 'Mike.The', 'other', 'good', 'thing', 'opportunity', 'view', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'nekkid', 'butt', 'Twice', 'Mazursky', 'sufficient', 'screen', 'time', 'enjoy', 'view', 'worth', 'second', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', '.Not', 'Recommended', 'wish', 'compare/contrast', 'Boudu', 'Saved', 'Drowning']",N/A
