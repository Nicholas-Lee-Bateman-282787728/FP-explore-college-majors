1032917,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000KB489I,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[12, 14]","Let me start by saying I didn't have any trouble with the coarse language or the incessant contentiousness of the characters.  Nor did I have many problems with the sound-delayed presentation of the overlapping lines of dialog, or the ""artsy"" closed caption-style graphics, or the blacked out scenes or any of the bold, impressionistic choices that director Dito Montiel makes in this allegedly (but not really) autobiographical tale.  After all, Dito comes from the hardcore/punk scene, so it's no surprise that he chooses to push the envelope and intentionally agitate his viewers.  And I prefer directors to take chances and fail rather than take no chances at all.The main gripe I have about the film is, though it was very well acted, the writing and the story never make it clear just what Dito's father Monty (Chazz Palminteri) or Dito himself (Shia LaBeouf) see in the troubled and abrasive Antonio (Channing Tatum) character.  I understand that Dito might have been just looking up to an older peer, regardless of how unruly or unpleasant he was (or the reasons behind his unpleasantness), but I just couldn't figure out why Monty would in many ways seem to choose Antonio over his own son, Dito.  And since these relationships are at the heart of the film, this is a rather major flaw, in my eyes.The film does make a great case as to why they SHOULDN'T hold Antonio in any esteem, however.  Dianne Wiest (in a superb performance as Flori, Dito's mom) is constantly advocating a cautionary approach to Antonio.  And when Scottish pal Mike O'Shea (played by the excellent Martin Compston - check out his standout performance in ""Sweet Sixteen"" if you like him here) says of Antonio, ""The guy's a f---in' dick, Dito.  It's because of him you're f---ed up,"" well - I couldn't agree more!Anyway, I listened to the entire commentary, done by writer/director Montiel himself along with his editor, searching for clues about this character dynamic.  And all I really got from the commentary about the story was that Dito (the director) has one thesis statement for this film: ""This is a whole movie about people saying nothing, going nowhere.""  Oh, and he and the editor purposely edited out all the funny parts.  Plus Dito admits that the young actors look nothing like the actors who are playing their older selves.  Great - thanks for enhancing my viewing experience.In addition, I think this movie gets too much credit/slack for being an autobiography, when in fact there is a lot of truth-bending (if not breaking) going on here.  I don't want to reveal too much, but the fates of both Antonio and his brother Giuseppe are greatly exaggerated in the film.  And Nerf takes a completely different course in real life.  Which would be fine in a work of fiction, but I think too much value is placed on this film being a true-life memoir, when in fact it is constantly veering into James Frey territory.To summarize, though the acting is terrific (Dianne Wiest and Rosario Dawson are especially entrancing) and the directing is somewhat fresh and innovative, the story itself ultimately left me cold.  And the fact that it's not even truly autobiographical makes it even less remarkable.  I'd like to give this film 2.5 stars (an average rating, not a negative one), but the Amazonian star system demands whole integers, so I'll round up to three because I admire Dito's moxie as much as I do his movie.The DVD itself has some pretty good features: there's a 20 minute ""making of"" featurette consisting of many interviews with the cast and producer Trudy Styler (aka Mrs. Sting).  There's one alternate opening and four alternate endings (both with and without commentary) and a bunch of deleted scenes (again, with or without commentary).  There's also the 6 minute ""rooftop scene,"" made by Dito whilst training at Sundance Labs.  But if you don't like the movie itself, odds are you won't have too much interest in the features.  I say, despite its high Amazon rating, approach this film with caution and maybe rent before you decide to buy.[...]",3,"To Quote the Director: ""a whole movie about people saying nothing, going nowhere""",1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,4052,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'coarse', 'language', 'incessant', 'contentiousness', 'characters', 'did', 'have', 'many', 'problems', 'sound-delayed', 'presentation', 'overlapping', 'lines', 'dialog', 'artsy', 'closed', 'caption-style', 'graphics', 'blacked', 'out', 'scenes', 'bold', 'impressionistic', 'choices', 'director', 'Dito', 'Montiel', 'allegedly', 'not', 'really', 'autobiographical', 'tale', 'Dito', 'hardcore/punk', 'scene', 'surprise', 'push', 'envelope', 'intentionally', 'agitate', 'viewers', 'prefer', 'directors', 'take', 'chances', 'fail', 'rather', 'take', 'chances', 'all.The', 'main', 'gripe', 'have', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'writing', 'story', 'never', 'make', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'Dito', 'father', 'Monty', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'Dito', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'see', 'troubled', 'abrasive', 'Antonio', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'character', 'understand', 'Dito', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'looking', 'up', 'older', 'peer', 'regardless', 'how', 'unruly', 'unpleasant', 'was', 'reasons', 'unpleasantness', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Monty', 'would', 'many', 'ways', 'seem', 'choose', 'Antonio', 'own', 'son', 'Dito', 'relationships', 'are', 'heart', 'film', 'rather', 'major', 'flaw', 'eyes.The', 'film', 'make', 'great', 'case', 'why', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'hold', 'Antonio', 'esteem', 'however', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'superb', 'performance', 'Flori', 'Dito', 'mom', 'constantly', 'advocating', 'cautionary', 'approach', 'Antonio', 'when', 'Scottish', 'pal', 'Mike', ""O'Shea"", 'played', 'excellent', 'Martin', 'Compston', 'check', 'standout', 'performance', 'Sweet', 'Sixteen', 'like', 'here', 'Antonio', 'guy', 'f', '-in', 'dick', 'Dito', ""'re"", 'f', '-ed', 'up', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'Anyway', 'listened', 'entire', 'commentary', 'done', 'writer/director', 'Montiel', 'editor', 'searching', 'clues', 'character', 'dynamic', 'really', 'got', 'commentary', 'story', 'was', 'Dito', 'director', 'one', 'thesis', 'statement', 'film', 'whole', 'movie', 'people', 'saying', 'nothing', 'going', 'nowhere', 'Oh', 'editor', 'purposely', 'edited', 'out', 'funny', 'parts', 'Dito', 'young', 'actors', 'look', 'nothing', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'playing', 'older', 'selves', 'Great', 'thanks', 'enhancing', 'viewing', 'experience.In', 'addition', 'think', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'credit/slack', 'being', 'autobiography', 'when', 'fact', 'lot', 'truth-bending', 'not', 'breaking', 'going', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'fates', 'Antonio', 'brother', 'Giuseppe', 'are', 'greatly', 'exaggerated', 'film', 'Nerf', 'completely', 'different', 'course', 'real', 'life', 'Which', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'work', 'fiction', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'value', 'placed', 'film', 'being', 'true-life', 'memoir', 'when', 'fact', 'constantly', 'veering', 'James', 'Frey', 'territory.To', 'summarize', 'acting', 'terrific', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'are', 'especially', 'entrancing', 'directing', 'somewhat', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'story', 'ultimately', 'left', 'cold', 'fact', 'not', 'even', 'truly', 'autobiographical', 'even', 'less', 'remarkable', ""'d"", 'like', 'give', 'film', '2.5', 'stars', 'average', 'rating', 'not', 'negative', 'one', 'Amazonian', 'star', 'system', 'whole', 'integers', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', 'three', 'admire', 'Dito', 'moxie', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'good', 'features', '20', 'minute', 'making', 'featurette', 'consisting', 'many', 'interviews', 'cast', 'producer', 'Trudy', 'Styler', 'Mrs.', 'Sting', 'one', 'alternate', 'opening', 'four', 'alternate', 'endings', 'commentary', 'bunch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'again', 'commentary', 'also', '6', 'minute', 'rooftop', 'scene', 'made', 'Dito', 'whilst', 'training', 'Sundance', 'Labs', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'odds', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'features', 'say', 'high', 'Amazon', 'rating', 'approach', 'film', 'caution', 'maybe', 'rent', 'decide', 'buy.', '[', ']']",N/A
1032918,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000KB489I,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[7, 15]","If one has never directed a film before one should not, I repeat (with even greater emphasis), should NEVER direct an adaptation of one's work. This is because one will have enough problems trying to learn the new medium that those problems born out of adaptation will only bog one down, especially if the work adapted, itself, has problems. That said, let me introduce you to Dito Montiel, director of the 98 minute long 2006 independent film, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints, adapted from his similarly titled nonfiction work. Some have labeled the book a memoir, but if the film is anything like the book, it is a hagiography, not a memoir, which would be appropriate, given its title.There's so much wrong with this film, yet I wanted so much for it to be good because I was predisposed to emotionally `like' it. After all, it's ostensibly a tale about growing up in a tough working class neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dealing with all the varied temptations that such a life and environment offer- i.e.- a slice of my own youth. Why would I NOT be inclined to like the film? Unfortunately, my head owns my heart, and this film is bad in too many ways, from Montiel's slapdash `style'- a bit of early Martin Scorsese aping, admixed with the `look at me, I'm cool' style of Darren Aronofsky, to just enough pointless experimentation (such as where the main character and his new friend speak to each other on a subway train via thoughts) with inappropriate cuts, voiceovers, fourth wall breakings, odd handheld camera angles, and inexplicable subtitles for English, of his own. Even worse is the trite flashback formula, as the current day framing scenes are even less compelling than the `memories,' and what little power the memories have is often short-circuited by a pointless flashforward.Of course, the tale, such as it is, is not much. Dito (Shia LaBeouf) is a hanger-on to several juvenile delinquents, and the apple of his creepy dad's eye. His dad, Monty (Chazz Palminteri), is one of those stereotypical New Yorker types from films (see dese, dem, and dose), whose only discernible difference is that he feels he is somehow a part of his son's teenaged coterie- not in a pedophilic `I really like boys' way, but in the pathetic and laughable old fart ""I like boys' way. While Palminteri is no great actor, this film gives him no opportunity to even stretch his limited skills. His acting is overwrought, to say the least. The film is told in the stale flashback formula I mentioned....While not falling into the blatant stereotypes of most Spike Lee films, Montiel has not a single convincing nor credible idea how to construct a compelling story nor characters. Especially bad is Montiel's depiction of a gay professional dogwalker and part-time drug dealer, and the oldest standby in reality and fiction- that Antonio and Giuseppe are so screwed up because they have a lout of a father. Perhaps the only thing the viewer can be thankful for is that the blame was put on daddy, not mommy. Well, that and the realistic depiction of Astoria's rooftop culture; although, naturally, the exaggerated cursing of the young folk only aids the lack of plot coherence, it does not hide it. One would think that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut had proved that cursing- even excessive cursing, could be used effectively, but only satirically, or if in the genuine interest of realism.In short, the film is not gritty, but silly; not moody, but dull; and imparts nothing to the viewer that your typical white boy wannabe rapper video could not do so, in far less time, while being devoid of the ABC Afterschool Special sort of moralizing. That this mess of a film won the Best Ensemble prize from the Sundance Film Festival shows that the problem with American cinema lies not just with Hollywood, but with the independent filmmakers, as well. There is just a need, it seems, to condescend to the Lowest Common Denominator at all times in all ways....Overall, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints plays out like an updated, self-consciously artsy (watch the dot on the subway train window scene) version of The Lords Of Flatbush, save that its characters are far less appealing, and its essence is nihility. I hope that if he ever gets the chance to direct another film he heeds my advice that opens this review.

In reality these types of neighborhoods of the 80's that were dominated by tough-skinned teen-agers whose summers left them wandering the streets aimlessly reverting to violence to fill the lonely, depressing hours. Everyone of the actors and actresses in this film deserve acolades for their performances. Everyone of them, and most of them are young but they're skill of dramatizing this era was almost perfect. Robert Downey Jr., did a very good portraying a depressed adult product of a teen-ager who just barely escaped the dangers of his hood, and having to do so at the guilt of a co-dependant dad and mom without say had to be hardest things to take on simultaneously but the one reason I didn't rate this film a personal 5 was because Robert Downey Jr.'s personal life has had so much tumultuity in it that he's almost typecast into this movie. My personal advice for Robert Downey jr. is to stay away from depressive roles on TV or the big screen.  I think it would be cool for RDJ to play a guy who builds motorcycles and ends up winning a biker build-off.. that would be a gritty role, motorcycles are cool and loveable, and a positive ending would fit nicely now for Robert. Think about it Robert, and cast Paul Tuetul Sr. oh, and me!! Sign me up.  3 solid Stars...

1032927,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KB489I,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS may not be on everyone's list of great films of 2006 but it most assuredly should be. In a time when the bulk of films that come across the marquis are empty headed fluff (with of course notable exceptions), little films like this autobiographical coming of age story in Queens in the 1980s by the accomplished yet very humble Dito Montiel make an initial impact on the viewer, then hang around the psyche with memories of cinematic moments as well as fresh looks at our own lives like few other films can achieve.Dito Montiel wrote his memoir, adapted it for the screen and directed it, each step being a first one for this very talented young man.  His story on the surface is simple: a childhood and coming of age of Dito and his friends as they face the crime and drugs and love affairs and deaths of living in the line of poverty. Dito (an astonishingly fine Shia LaBeouf) has a cadre of friends that include Scottish Mike (Martin Compston), crazy Nerf (Peter Anthony Tambakis), firebrand Antonio (Channing Tatum in yet another fiery and sensitive performance), Antonio's unfortunate brother Giuseppe (Adam Scarimbolo), and girls Laurie (Melonie Diaz) and Diane (Julia Garro).  The boys face gang trouble with the Puerto Rican gang Reapers, parental abuse as in Antonio's father (Federico Castelluccio), parental love as with Dito's parents Monty (Chazz Palminteri) and Flori (Dianne Wiest).As their world in Queens comes tumbling down with tragic consequences Dito decides to leave for California.  And leave he does, not returning for twenty years to the place where he successfully survived a childhood due to the 'saints' he didn't recognize until the father with whom he has not communicated in the interim has reached his end.  The past and the present are woven together throughout the film with the flash forward, flash back sequences: the older successful writer Dito is played by Robert Downey, Jr.; Antonio (imprisoned for his beating death of the head of the Reapers) is Eric Roberts; Laurie now married is Rosario Dawson; Nerf now is Scott Michael Campbell: and Dito's parents remain makeup-aged Palminteri and Wiest. It is this blend of the past as revealed by the present that makes Montiel's film work so well.  They manner in which he creates the magic of near extemporaneous speech with this amazing cast creates a sense of grit, verismo, and profound love and loss.  Conversations such as the ones between little Dito and Monty, between the mature Dito and Flori and Lauri and Antonio - all are minor miracles of writing and acting.  Montiel may be a first time director but he has drawn some of the finest work ever from Palminteri, Wiest, Downey, Dawson, Tatum, Roberts and LaBoeuf.For those who have read Montiel's book by the same name, the time Dito spent in East Village and his fame as a Calvin Klein underwear model will seem painfully missing. But Montiel has extracted the essence of a boy growing out of his environment with the help of his unknown saints, condensed the action, and told the story in a magical way - a way that is sure to drive into the gut and heart of every sensitive viewer.  Highly Recommended.

The editior seemed to try and fit everything he has seen in a lame movie before and cram it all in to here (typesetting narration, revealing the end before you know the beginning, charcters talk to the camera) and I guess the writer chose to make money off a movie with 'daddy doesn't love me' issues rather then shell out the $ to talk to a psychiatrist.Roario dawson is billed as being in this movie yet she doesn't show up till the hour long mark and the movie ends about a half hour after that.Robert Downey Jr was a very peculiar choice to play the 'grown up' kid. The two actors (young and old) look nothing alike.The portrayal of women is absolutely cringe-worthy where sex comes first and love doesn't really have much to do with it. Just a bunch of foul-mouthed teens who look at each other like pieces of meat and make cat-calls. There seems to be a message of 'don't ever leave your family or else you are a traitor' and it seems extremely awkward that a parent would really want to cage (not literally) their child that way. I personally could not have a more Italian family oriented life and what was shown here just left me confused. The storyline went nowhere and certainly did not make me care about what was unfolding.To show the writers block this had .... one of the main ""plots"" to this was that there was gang retaliation going on back and forth.

Dialogue that begins and ends then begins again, repeated; subtitles where none are needed; scenes of the ""aimless""; scenes in which the characters pause to reflect on how they're feeling, to tell the camera their state of mind--Roberto Rossellini style.  And yet in other ways Montiel's film feels hopelessly trapped in its commitment to its own coming of age-ness, a traditional sort of film, replete with adult actors playing the kids as they age, thus acting as a second film commenting on the first.  Did they cast Rosario Dawson first, you have to wonder, then hire a girl who looks something like her to play her as a teen, or was it vice versa?Some will give acting honors to Dianne Wiest, nearly unrecognizable to begin with, making a difficult phone call and dialing the phone with her eyebrows or so it seems.  Oh those housecoats!  They're the same ones Julie Kavner and Olympia Dukakis used to wear in Woody Allen coming of age films like RADIO DAYS, films Dianne Wiest used to wear more glamorous clothes in, but now she's stuck in them poor thing.  She has one scene in which male noises of argument and cultural undertow threaten to wake her at 2 a.m. and she keeps calling, ""Monty who's there?""  ""Is somebody there, Monty?"" to a ludicrous degree since it would be apparent to neighbors down the street that Monty's entertaining a whole crew of Brandolike shouters.Chazz is good, and so is the hulklike brute Channing Tatum, and Rosario Dawson is good too, but her part is, sigh, just the bottom of the barrel!

It's a coming of age story that takes place in 1986 and 2006 about Dito and his friends. Shia LaBeouf and Robert Downey, Jr. play Dito as a teenager and an adult, respectively. It's basically a movie about how they navigated their way through the trials that come with living in a place where they might get stuck, and could get stuck, because of crime, family, a lack of motivation. Growing up in an inner city neighborhood, Dito's friends all met different ends: some went to jail, others got hooked on drugs, some became single parents.

However, if you look beyond that (and I admit I was wondering just how many times they used ""the `f' word"" in this movie) you'll find a brilliant story that's very poignant, true to life and emotionally raw because of its honesty about people and their relationships with each other. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography shows good judgment. The musical score enhances the movie, too. The acting is extremely convincing and the casting is great.When the movie begins, we quickly meet young Dito Montiel (Shia LaBeouf) who's growing up with his buddies and some girlfriends on the pretty mean streets of Astoria, Queens (NY City) during the 1980s. Dito's friends include the ultra-macho Antonio (Channing Tatum) and Antonio's younger brother Guiseppe (Adam Scarimbolo), Nerf (Peter Anthony Tambakis), Mike O'Shea (Martin Compston), his girlfriend Laurie (Melonie Diaz) and more. Dito's parents are brilliantly portrayed by Dianne Wiest and Chazz Palminteri. As the plot develops, we see Dito and his buddies leading a rather frustrating life during the course of one extremely hot and humid summer; they are young and looking for time alone with girls and some angry confrontations with other guys, including one who goes by the name of ""Reaper"" (Michael Rivera). When Dito gets into a fight with ""Reaper"" because he wrote graffiti; ""Reaper"" scrawls more graffiti--even some on Dito's house--that he's coming ""to get"" Dito and kill him. Antonio is ready to defend Dito even though they themselves have their own ups and downs; and this ultimately leads to quite an explosive scene.In addition, Dito's parents don't meet his needs as a young teenager who doesn't really know yet what he wants from life but is old enough to know that whatever he wants certainly isn't in Astoria, Queens. His father is furious that Dito is considering leaving home with his buddy Mike to form a band in California; and Dito's mother tries her best to keep things under control even though her struggle isn't very successful.The DVD comes with an optional running commentary by director Dito Montiel; a ""making-of"" featurette and more.A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints leaves me with a very powerful impression; it makes a bold statement about the harsh realities that happen so often in life. Some may say that Dito Montiel's relationships with his friends and his family were unusual; but I think there are many, many people out there who have similar relationships, struggles, fears and occasionally some happy times. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants a good look at what life is really like on the streets of a mighty callous neighborhood; this is a terrific coming-of-age story. Of course, fans of the actors in this movie will not be disappointed.",5,a powerful coming-of-age story,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,2894,"['Guide', 'Recognizing', 'Saints', 'powerful', 'film', 'may', 'turn', 'off', 'people', 'violent', 'exual', 'content', 'However', 'look', 'admit', 'was', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'used', 'f', 'word', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'brilliant', 'story', 'very', 'poignant', 'true', 'life', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'honesty', 'people', 'relationships', 'other', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'choreography', 'good', 'judgment', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'too', 'acting', 'extremely', 'convincing', 'casting', 'great.When', 'movie', 'quickly', 'meet', 'young', 'Dito', 'Montiel', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'who', 'growing', 'up', 'buddies', 'girlfriends', 'pretty', 'mean', 'streets', 'Astoria', 'Queens', 'NY', 'City', '1980s', 'Dito', 'friends', 'include', 'ultra-macho', 'Antonio', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'Antonio', 'younger', 'brother', 'Guiseppe', 'Adam', 'Scarimbolo', 'Nerf', 'Peter', 'Anthony', 'Tambakis', 'Mike', ""O'Shea"", 'Martin', 'Compston', 'girlfriend', 'Laurie', 'Melonie', 'Diaz', 'more', 'Dito', 'parents', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'plot', 'see', 'Dito', 'buddies', 'leading', 'rather', 'frustrating', 'life', 'course', 'one', 'extremely', 'hot', 'humid', 'summer', 'are', 'young', 'looking', 'time', 'alone', 'girls', 'angry', 'confrontations', 'other', 'guys', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'name', 'Reaper', 'Michael', 'Rivera', 'When', 'Dito', 'fight', 'Reaper', 'wrote', 'graffiti', 'Reaper', 'more', 'graffiti', 'even', 'Dito', 'house', 'coming', 'get', 'Dito', 'kill', 'Antonio', 'ready', 'defend', 'Dito', 'even', 'have', 'own', 'ups', 'downs', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'explosive', 'scene.In', 'addition', 'Dito', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'needs', 'young', 'teenager', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'yet', 'what', 'life', 'old', 'enough', 'know', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'Astoria', 'Queens', 'father', 'furious', 'Dito', 'considering', 'leaving', 'home', 'buddy', 'Mike', 'form', 'band', 'California', 'Dito', 'mother', 'best', 'keep', 'things', 'control', 'even', 'struggle', ""n't"", 'very', 'successful.The', 'DVD', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Dito', 'Montiel', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'more.A', 'Guide', 'Recognizing', 'Saints', 'very', 'powerful', 'impression', 'bold', 'statement', 'harsh', 'realities', 'happen', 'so', 'often', 'life', 'may', 'say', 'Dito', 'Montiel', 'relationships', 'friends', 'family', 'were', 'unusual', 'think', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'similar', 'relationships', 'struggles', 'fears', 'occasionally', 'happy', 'times', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'like', 'streets', 'mighty', 'callous', 'neighborhood', 'terrific', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'course', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

They go to school together, they spend time after school together, they protect each other.  One of them, the main character Dito (portrayed by Shia B. as a teenager and R. Downey, Jr. as an adult) has complicated relationship with all of them.  He feels loyalty to his freinds, but also realizes that he may be loosing his life to local thus if he stays around for a while.  His relationship with his parents is a complicated one. His parents got him late in their lives and they are overly protective of him.  They seek to be his friends, but Dito feels that all the love is smothering him more than helping him grow emotionally and spiritually.  Dito's father loves him fiercely, but is it a jealous kind of love.  His father is possesive and probably fearful of his own impending death (his health is frail).  In an effort to keep his son close in order to ensure that there is someone taking care of him and his wife in their last days of their lives, he pushes his son away with his stubborness and inability to let go.  Before long, Dito leaves East Coast for California where he spends another 20 years as a writer before coming back to Queens where memories of his childhood start to haunt him: his first girl crush, his friend duying accidentaly when he is hit by a train, another friend murdered by the local gang member, third friend drowning is drugs and alcohol in order to hide his own hopelessness and despair and and the last friend (played by fantasticly handsome and convincing Eric Roberts) is in jail after murdering a gang member who beat Dito with a baseball bat.  All these people are tied together by the neighborhood they live in and never venture from (going to Manhattan is almost like taking a vacation to them).  They do not know of any other world outside their own.  They are also bound by the ""old world"" expectations where children's roles are defined from their birth to be a caregivers and safekeepers of their parents' old ages.  When that conflicts with realities of our (american) culture, our own peronsonal needs and desires it is almost impossible to reconcile the two.  Heartbreak is inevitable, but it is a kind of heartbreak that does nto erase the love.

It's a remarkable Indie achievement, a compelling story allowing a stellar cast free reign to present this tale of choice, decisions and ultimate despair.Shia LeBeouf and Channing Tatum are excellent in their early career roles, and solid performances from Dianne Wiest, Chazz Palmentieri and Rosario Dawson add to the mix. Robert Downey Jr is the adult Dito, coming to terms with life; a fine performance, as expected from him.I won't blab away the plot, but kids should see this film to know that they have a mind of their own, not to be swayed by gangs or peer pressure. There's some foul language, but no different than the street talk of the day (action takes place in '86). Dito chose his own identity, though loved his childhood friends despite their flaws. That's not a bad thing, but when friends take a negative path, it's not necessary to follow them.Gritty, well-edited and wonderfully acted, with a cameo from Eric Roberts, and a terrific performance from Anthony DeSando as a wily dog-walker.

1032947,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B000KB489I,Richard Ross,"[5, 7]","The only complaint I have with this film is that it's too short. The ending came so abruptly I was not ready to leave these characters behind. Thanks to brilliant acting I had become totally invested in them and left to wonder whatever happened to them. The film tells the story of Dito Montiel an author turned filmmaker. It traces his violent childhood in Queens to his self imposed exile in California and finally his return home after fifteen years to tend to his ill father who never forgave him for leaving. Shia LeBeouf plays Dito as a teen and Robert Downey Jr. plays the grown up Dito. I'm not a fan of LeBeouf but his acting here is amazing. I haven't seen many of his films but I would say it's his greatest performance if there is such a thing. Dito lives with his mother (Dianne Wiest) and father Monty (Chazz Palminteri). He roams the streets with his friend Antonio (the brilliant Channing Tatum) and other characters with names like Nerf. Antonio is a hothead who is always getting into fights and vandalizing stuff. His home life is no picnic since his father beats him severely. Monty is the only  person who takes an interest in him, more so than his own son. Laurie (the gorgeous Melonie Diaz) is the neighborhood girl who Dito has a crush on. Tiring of the violence and drugs that surround him Dito dreams of running off to California and starting a band with a Scottish classmate. This doesn't bode well with his friends or  family. When he runs afoul of some Puerto Ricans and they beat him with  bats his mind is made up. In the tragic aftermath his father suffers a severe heart attack, Antonio gets revenge on the Puerto Ricans that lands  some in the hospital and others in jail, and Laurie remains in Queens and has a child while waiting for Dito to return. Dito comes home after fifteen years to take his father to the hospital but his father, like everyone else, has never forgiven him for abandoning them.  The film is very raw in many ways. The behavior of Dito's friends is appalling full of sex, violence, and strong language. They aren't a likable bunch but they aren't supposed to be. What makes the film so raw and painful are the scenes between Dito and Antonio or Dito and his father. Both as child and adult the emotion is there. As mentioned LeBeouf is brilliant and Palminteri is reliably superb. The biggest revelation is Tatum. After appearing in crap like 'She's The Man' and 'Step Up' he shows a real talent and his performance is the film's highlight. (I can't wait to see his re teaming with Montiel in the film 'Fighting'.) As an adult Eric Roberts plays Antonio and even though the scene is very short and comes right at the end it's still devastating.
