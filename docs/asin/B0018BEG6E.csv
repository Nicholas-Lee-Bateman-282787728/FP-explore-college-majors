So take it for what it is; a short but good and challenging cardio & weights workout.

Very motivating in this workout-she really gets you going! I'm not a big fan of kickboxing (due to a permanent small tear in my LCL-it's hard to use my left leg for side kicks-so I avoid kick boxing)-but I modify my moves during the kickboxing. I actually used this one yesterday -but just the weights part-and then used the Sculpting Ball DVD workout right after. So a VERY good workout! The only thing I don't like is the backround.

1159547,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0018BEG6E,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[14, 14]","This new workout from The Firm is designed to be a fat-burning routine which blends kickboxing and sculpting intervals.  It is led by Kelsie Daniels, an instructor who has been a favorite of mine since back when she worked with Firm founder Anna Benson on the original FitPrime series.  The only equipment you need for the workout is a set of dumbbells; Kelsie cues you to use ""medium to heavy"" weights, but I found that sticking with 5-pound dumbbells throughout was challenging yet allowed me to focus mainly on the cardio benefits of the moves.  The workout is filmed on a nice, bright set, with big windows in the background overlooking what appears to be a building courtyard.  Kelsie is joined by four background exercisers, one of whom shows lower-impact modifications.Kelsie gets you moving right away with an fast-paced warm-up that includes punches and active stretches; the warm-up lasts just under 5 minutes, and you are moving the entire time.  The first weighted series follows.  This segment begins with a squat/hammer curl combo, eventually adding a kick and then moving into a lunge with back kick.  The squat series is repeated on the other side and then the section finishes with some push-ups which include punches.  Next is the first kickboxing segment.  Kelsie builds up a fun combo in an add-on style; eventually, you'll do a jab-cross-hook-upper-knee-front kick-back kick-front kick, with the combination itself automatically moving you from one side to the other.  A second series using the weights follows, starting with dips and shoulder press, adding in a glute lift.  The next move is a crescent knee with opposite knee raise and side twist, and finally, there is a 1-legged squat with tricep kickback.  Then it's on to another fun kickboxing segment, starting with a side-to-side shuffle and three punches on each side.  After this, there's a dip with a knee lift that turns into an optional jump kick, and finally, a series of side kicks.  The final weights work follows, this time starting out with side lunges and triceps, eventually adding a roundhouse kick and then ending with a 1-armed row.  The segment concludes with another compound move, curtsy dips with side laterals, and a final balance move, side laterals while balancing on one leg.At this point, the workout moves to the floor for push-ups and abs work.  I question the decision of The Firm to include this segment in a shorter workout like this one; I think it would've made much more sense to use the time for an additional kickboxing segment.  This section begins with a very short plank work series and then moves on to crunches, some of which were new an different, such as doing punches during bicycles.  Overall, however, this entire segment was less than 5 minutes long, so it didn't seem all that worthwhile.  The 5-minute cool-down is performed entirely on the floor, and it included some very nice stretches for the hamstrings, quads, and hips, all of which were definitely needed after the lower body emphasis of this workout.  The total time for the workout was about 42 minutes.  The workout also includes a bonus segment called ""Every Muscle in 5 Minutes!""  It's actually just under 6 minutes long, and it features Kelsie working out alone.  She opens with a fast-moving lunge from side-to-side, adding on several sets of push-ups.  Next comes a back dip with an overhead press and then a front lunge with a row; this is repeated to the other side.  Finally, she finishes off with a slow side-to-side lunge to stretch.  As might be expected, this short segment felt kind of rushed, and I'm not sure that it really added anything to the overall workout.Despite my ambivalence towards the floorwork and bonus workout, I really enjoyed the main body of this workout!  Kelsie keeps you moving non-stop, so even the weighted segments felt more like cardio work to me.  I found the music to be much more fun and upbeat than in other Firm offerings, and I was also impressed that this DVD is actually chaptered, something you almost NEVER see from the FIRM!  Although there are a few things that I think could have been done better, overall, I'm very happy with this workout and know that I will use it often; my final rating would be 4 1/2 stars.",5,"Fun, non-stop cardio workout!",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,4252,"['new', 'workout', 'Firm', 'designed', 'be', 'fat-burning', 'routine', 'kickboxing', 'sculpting', 'intervals', 'led', 'Kelsie', 'Daniels', 'instructor', 'who', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'back', 'when', 'worked', 'Firm', 'founder', 'Anna', 'Benson', 'original', 'FitPrime', 'series', 'only', 'equipment', 'need', 'workout', 'set', 'dumbbells', 'Kelsie', 'use', 'medium', 'heavy', 'weights', 'found', 'sticking', '5-pound', 'dumbbells', 'was', 'challenging', 'yet', 'allowed', 'focus', 'mainly', 'cardio', 'benefits', 'moves', 'workout', 'filmed', 'nice', 'bright', 'set', 'big', 'windows', 'background', 'overlooking', 'what', 'be', 'building', 'courtyard', 'Kelsie', 'joined', 'four', 'background', 'exercisers', 'one', 'whom', 'lower-impact', 'modifications.Kelsie', 'moving', 'right', 'away', 'fast-paced', 'warm-up', 'punches', 'active', 'stretches', 'warm-up', 'lasts', 'just', '5', 'minutes', 'are', 'moving', 'entire', 'time', 'first', 'weighted', 'series', 'segment', 'squat/hammer', 'curl', 'combo', 'eventually', 'adding', 'kick', 'then', 'moving', 'lunge', 'back', 'kick', 'squat', 'series', 'repeated', 'other', 'side', 'then', 'section', 'finishes', 'push-ups', 'include', 'punches', 'Next', 'first', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'Kelsie', 'up', 'fun', 'combo', 'add-on', 'style', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'do', 'jab-cross-hook-upper-knee-front', 'kick-back', 'kick-front', 'kick', 'combination', 'automatically', 'moving', 'one', 'side', 'other', 'second', 'series', 'using', 'weights', 'starting', 'dips', 'shoulder', 'press', 'adding', 'glute', 'lift', 'next', 'move', 'crescent', 'knee', 'opposite', 'knee', 'raise', 'side', 'twist', 'finally', '1-legged', 'squat', 'tricep', 'kickback', 'Then', 'fun', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'starting', 'side-to-side', 'shuffle', 'three', 'punches', 'side', 'dip', 'knee', 'lift', 'optional', 'jump', 'kick', 'finally', 'series', 'side', 'kicks', 'final', 'weights', 'work', 'time', 'starting', 'out', 'side', 'lunges', 'triceps', 'eventually', 'adding', 'roundhouse', 'kick', 'then', 'ending', '1-armed', 'row', 'segment', 'compound', 'move', 'curtsy', 'dips', 'side', 'laterals', 'final', 'balance', 'move', 'side', 'laterals', 'balancing', 'one', 'leg.At', 'point', 'workout', 'floor', 'push-ups', 'abs', 'work', 'question', 'decision', 'Firm', 'include', 'segment', 'shorter', 'workout', 'one', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'use', 'time', 'additional', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'section', 'very', 'short', 'plank', 'work', 'series', 'then', 'moves', 'crunches', 'were', 'new', 'different', 'such', 'doing', 'punches', 'bicycles', 'Overall', 'however', 'entire', 'segment', 'was', 'less', '5', 'minutes', 'long', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'worthwhile', '5-minute', 'cool-down', 'performed', 'entirely', 'floor', 'included', 'very', 'nice', 'stretches', 'hamstrings', 'quads', 'hips', 'were', 'definitely', 'needed', 'lower', 'body', 'emphasis', 'workout', 'total', 'time', 'workout', 'was', '42', 'minutes', 'workout', 'also', 'bonus', 'segment', 'called', 'Muscle', '5', 'Minutes', 'actually', 'just', '6', 'minutes', 'long', 'Kelsie', 'working', 'out', 'alone', 'fast-moving', 'lunge', 'side-to-side', 'adding', 'several', 'sets', 'push-ups', 'Next', 'back', 'dip', 'overhead', 'press', 'then', 'front', 'lunge', 'row', 'repeated', 'other', 'side', 'Finally', 'slow', 'side-to-side', 'lunge', 'stretch', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'short', 'segment', 'felt', 'kind', 'rushed', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'added', 'anything', 'overall', 'workout.Despite', 'ambivalence', 'floorwork', 'bonus', 'workout', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'main', 'body', 'workout', 'Kelsie', 'moving', 'non-stop', 'so', 'even', 'weighted', 'segments', 'felt', 'more', 'cardio', 'work', 'found', 'music', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'upbeat', 'other', 'Firm', 'offerings', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'DVD', 'actually', 'chaptered', 'something', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'see', 'FIRM', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'overall', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'workout', 'know', 'will', 'use', 'often', 'final', 'rating', 'would', 'be', '4', '1/2', 'stars']","The Firm: Pump, Jump 'N Jab"

I would say that this is a Intermediate-Advanced workout.  While Kelsie does a terrific job reminding you of proper form- the workout does move quickly so you need to have a good idea of what she means when cueing.I've read some reviews that slam Kelsie for bad cueing.  Actually, she does a good job, but for the beginner or those not familiar with the FIRM I can see how someone might get frustrated.  However, if the routine was super easy to learn- I think boredom would set in very quickly so I love how the she mixes it up and keeps you moving!The FIRM likes to go heavy on the squats and lunges- which can be hard on my knees.  But I'm happy to say that this one is one is not.  It is heavy on the dips, but those are a little easier for me.I agree with another review that questions the abs portion.  You really have to be able to stay up on your toes during pushups and planks to maintain form.  I tried to stay on my knees and found it awkward to pull my knees up to my chest.  Knocked one star off for this- think another kickboxing or four-limb set would have been better use of this time.All in all-  am happy with this workout- it's a good length (about 40 min without the bonus 5 min)and will definitely hold a spot in my DVD rotations.",4,Another good FIRM workout,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,1380,"[""'m"", 'long-time', 'FIRM', 'user-', 'have', 'come', 'really', 'appreciate', 'how', 'not', 'only', 'burn', 'calories', 'make', 'stronger', 'would', 'say', 'Intermediate-Advanced', 'workout', 'Kelsie', 'terrific', 'job', 'reminding', 'proper', 'form-', 'workout', 'move', 'quickly', 'need', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'when', 'cueing.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'slam', 'Kelsie', 'bad', 'cueing', 'Actually', 'good', 'job', 'beginner', 'not', 'familiar', 'FIRM', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'might', 'get', 'frustrated', 'However', 'routine', 'was', 'super', 'easy', 'learn-', 'think', 'boredom', 'would', 'set', 'very', 'quickly', 'love', 'how', 'mixes', 'up', 'keeps', 'moving', 'FIRM', 'go', 'heavy', 'squats', 'lunges-', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'knees', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'one', 'one', 'not', 'heavy', 'dips', 'are', 'little', 'easier', 'me.I', 'agree', 'review', 'questions', 'abs', 'portion', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'stay', 'up', 'toes', 'pushups', 'planks', 'maintain', 'form', 'tried', 'stay', 'knees', 'found', 'awkward', 'pull', 'knees', 'up', 'chest', 'Knocked', 'one', 'star', 'this-', 'think', 'kickboxing', 'four-limb', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'use', 'time.All', 'all-', 'am', 'happy', 'workout-', 'good', 'length', '40', 'min', 'bonus', '5', 'min', 'will', 'definitely', 'hold', 'spot', 'DVD', 'rotations']","The Firm: Pump, Jump 'N Jab"

It makes you work hard and you can feel your muscles work and they'll remind you of their hard work even two days later (that's how I feel today - I've done it once now and can't wait for them to recover to try it again).Kelsie is a terrific instructor; she's motivating and has endless amounts of energy.  Almost right from the start there are jabs and hooks to get your heart rate up, and right throughout the program, she teaches the cardio segments in add-on-style - that way you get used to a move and then add on other components to learn it faster.  When you do the toning, you use upper and lower body muscles at the same time to really burn fat and tone with maximum results.Kelsie isn't annoying - she's very encouraging and that is a big help with this workout.

1159563,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B0018BEG6E,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[2, 2]","I am relatively new to The Firm, and have usually found their workouts to be too fast-paced (with moves that are too complicated for beginners if you're not familiar with them) for someone trying out their workouts for the first time.  Usually, I stop their workouts 20 minutes in simply because I've had enough of feeling totally lost.  Not with this one!  Kelsie Daniels hits it right on the mark, with moves that are easy to follow and do, and provides a nice combination of kickboxing and strength training.What I loved:1) Not shutting the DVD off in disgust because I couldn't keep up.  The combos during the kickboxing segments weren't complicated, and Kelsie does them enough times so you can actually get the hang of it.  The strength-training segments were just as easy to follow.2) The fact that the segments using the weights kept my heart rate up, sometimes even higher than doing the kickboxing segments!3) The fact that this workout is about 35 minutes long (The DVD says 45, but you really have 30 minutes of kickboxing/weight training, about 5 minutes of core/ab work, and then about 5 minutes of stretching).  I know some people didn't like this, but I get up early before I go to work (between 4 and 4:30 A.M.), and I need workouts where I can get a good workout in about 30-35 minutes.  This one delivers--there's no wasted time in the 35 minutes Kelsie has you working!What I thought could have been better:1) It could use a little more strength-training for the upper body; what I've noticed about Kelsie's workouts is that you do a LOT of lunges and lower body moves.2) If you have never done kickboxing before (I started my weight-loss journey with Tae-Bo, so I am more than familiar), you will have a hard time keeping up.  She doesn't explain how to do any of the kickboxing moves; however, like I said, she does them enough times you can get the hang of them.The good clearly outweighs the bad here; I felt FABULOUS after doing this workout, and felt like I got an intense workout, even after only 30 minutes.

1159564,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B0018BEG6E,T. Carr,"[3, 3]","This is an effective workout which incorporates cardio and strength training all inspired by kickboxing. As I said, it's well titled... there's lots of pumping (work with moderate weights), jumping (and kicking), and jabbing (punches, hooks and jabs galore). The workout starts with a warmup and then alternates between pure kickboxing inspired sections and sections with weights (she suggests moderate to heavy but 3 or 5 lbs works for me), the weight sections also managed to incorporate some kickbox moves to tie it all together. There's also some pushups and ab work as well as a (somewhat longer than usual, which I found nice) stretch section at the end. For the kickboxing sections without weights one is geared more toward actual boxing, i.e. punches and such, while another seems to focus more on kicking and jump kicks. I didn't think I was the type who would enjoy a kickbox workout AT ALL, but I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. I'd say it's more kickboxing inspired than a pure kickbox workout, as she adds in other types of exercises and incorporates weights. She starts each exercise with a basic option, and adds on changes to make it more difficult until you reach the full intended move. She also gives low impact alternatives throughout. I have bad knees but was surprised to make it through the workout without needing to modify steps or feeling any strain. The instructor gives good instructions and cuing throughout. It was somewhat intense but very easy to follow along.I deducted one star because I do have some mixed feelings about the workout. Part of me felt like it went by quickly for a 55 minute workout. At one point we went to the floor for ab work and I thought we were halfway done only to find out that after the abs came the cool down and stretches. However, I could have enjoyed the whole workout more. I by no means hated it, but it still felt like exercise to me. I think part of why it seemed to go by so quickly is because I was constantly wondering how far into it I was and when it would be over. I think it's a very effective workout, and a nice change from the usual aerobic/weight work, but I just enjoy some other workout dvds more, so I felt like I couldn't give it the full 5 stars.
