1433819,A2EO3TWW174F7P,B004YM6JSW,"Cameron Dimez ""GM Custom Jewelry Owner""","[28, 39]","The season started out strong and with a lot of potential. Unfortunately the pacing of this season was very slow then too fast. As a whole it had a lot of interesting dynamics. Nancy meets a mini-version of herself as a rival, rivals her sister to get back her baby, hs a new partnership funded by Shane as he uses his manipulation for expanding the family drug business and a billion other Botwin-filled antics only this show can deliver.There are 13 episodes in this season. I will try to mantain as spoiler-free as possible since some people aren't up to speed.1. BagsGrade: A-After spending 3 years behind bars for taking the rap for last seasons dilema stemming from Shane murdering mexican VIP Pilar Zuzua (Kate Del Castillo). Nancy is given new perks and new problems.2. From Trauma Cometh SomethingGrade: BNancy meets her cellmates brother Demitri and makes a deal. Andy and the gang give up their new lives in Copenhagen for NYC.3. Game PlayedGrade: A-Nancy seduces Demitri, tries to bend the rules at the halfway house, and is put in a new situation involving jail time.4. A Hole In Her NiqabGrade: BSilas and Nancy start off poorly in their partnership, Shane embarks on a scheme to earn some quick cash and Nancy fights to get Stevie back from Jill. An unexpected supply bump puts Nancy in a bind.5. Fingers Only Meat BanquetGrade: BThe fight continues for Stevie, Nancy learns some disturbing news regarding her baby. Doug partners up with Nancy and she strives to get out of the halfway house for good. Silas and Shane build up their prospects in NYC.6. Object ImperminanceGrade: ATonye Patono reprises her role along with Andy Milder as Heylia James and Dean Hodes. Nancy discovers an old and forgotten strain (MILF from Season 2) reprises it. Heylia and Nancy square off.7. Vehemont V. VigariousGrade: B+Nancy and Andy get their game on! The halfway house manager is on Nancy's back, Doug crashes from a drug addiction and much more.8. SyntheticsGrade: A-Michelle Tractenberg plays Emma, back with Denny to let Silas and Nancy let them know they're not backing down. Aiden Quinn as Clyde the CEO gets set up for a pinching date with Nancy.9. Cats! Cats! Cats!Grade: A+One of the best episodes of the season. Zoya, Nancy's cellmate comes back and makes demands, Demitri and her clash in a bizarre love triangle. Andy, Shane and Silas get way over their heads. Andy can't sell his invention, Shane plays with the NYPD and Silas sleeps with the enemy.10. System OverheadGrade: AAfter Emma's coy game ran its course, it comes down to Nancy and her squaring off in personal tenaciousness. Andy's upside down, Silas starts to fall for another of Emma's traps and Shane ends up somewhere he should have over 3 years ago.11. Une Mere Que J'aimerias BaiserGrade: A-Nancy and Andy head off to the hamptons after busting out the competition. Silas squares off against Nancy and the two become rivals.12. Qualitive Spatial ReasoningGrade: BNancy tries to show Silas a lesson for trashing her name and things blow up for each other. Nancy ends it with Demitri and tries to make things right.13. Do Her/Don't Do HerGrade: BIn a ho-hum finale, everything is resolved and then paved off with a Season 3 like cliffhanger. The series may and hopefully will return so we can get a better resulotion for the Botwin clan.This season had it's ups and downs. It was not as over the top as Season 5, but like season 6 seemed to lack a general direction and central plot. Each episode was writte well, things just didn't play out like they used to, it was somewhat sloppy. Still, overall it was an enjoyable season.

1433827,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B004YM6JSW,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[1, 3]","----------------------------------------------""Weeds: Season Seven""----------------------------------------------In my opinion, the last couple of seasons of ""Weeds"" were kind of a drag, pretty strained and super-sharkjumpy. The screenwriters had so thoroughly boxed themselves in by the whole Mexican-mafia thing that they had nowhere to go, and it seemed like the show had ground to a halt. I dutifully picked up Season 7, but didn't have unrealistic hopes about its quality level.Here's the good news: in a single stroke, the writers leapfrogged past the Mexico story, and placed Nancy and her crew into a completely new situation, sort of like a reality show decamping to a new locale. From being aimlessly on the run and battered by an absurdly cruel universe, they were now in New York City, living the life and having a lot of fun. The new setup allowed all the characters to reboot, and the show's writers to get their groove back. Some of the same plot tics came back, but the show was clearly not in the deep rut it had been in before -- they were being silly and having fun again, they way they had in the first couple of seasons. A lot of the humor derives from the deliciously unpleasant characters -- there's no one here on a par with Nancy's old gal-pal Celia, but Nancy's sister is so unbelievably awful, she does come close. Anyway, S7 is worth a shot... Even if you found yourself drifting away before, you'll want to give them another try this time around. This is a a fun season!

1433833,A3ESRVKA3BW8AZ,B004YM6JSW,John Mundie,"[5, 5]","Yeah, I'll admit it. After six seasons, we are addicted to Weeds. Its a nice 26 minute time wasting filler at the end of a long day of work, raising kids, walking the dog, etc.  ... sigh, I guess my personal ""Weeds"" days are long over.But, while we really enjoyed the first couple of years of most excellent Weeds, and happily chuckled along with the next 4 seasons, I have to ask: what were they thinking with season 7?Its just not that good. The writing is weak and the plot, as recently as season six being quite silly, is now verging on dumb.In season 7 the Andy character is woefully under utilized, tho he usually got maybe 2 minutes of the best dialogue per show.

It's a bad sign when an episode ends and I simply turn off the DVD and don't really care what happens next. Previous seasons had me compulsively watching 3-4 episodes in a row because the plots were so addictive and interesting. Not here, folks. Season 7 offers no excitement, even though we have a flash-forward 3 years and Nancy is now living in a halfway house in New York after her prison stint.The writers try and give us some bizarre visuals to spice up the proceedings (A group of mimes at a funeral; Silus walking around in a giant transparent beach ball in his underwear at some avante-garde gathering) but everything falls flat.The finale doesn't get interesting until the last few minutes and I figure there's two ways they can go for Season 8. I don't know if Mary Louise Parker is returning or not; if she is--they will probably make Season 8 a prequel to the final scene of S7.Diehards like me will want to own this for their collection; everyone else should just rent it.

I know that the show is a bit of a fantasy but it just seemed to get past the point where I'm willing to suspend disbelief and into territory where I say, ""This is just silly."" Such moments included...&lt;spoilers>-the idea that the Securities Exchange Commission would collude with a corrupt venture capital business because its retirement funds were tied up with it.-the moment in the show where Nancy's former lesbian lover, her current lover (the lesbian's brother), and her putative new boyfriend (played by Aidan Quinn) all showed up at her apartment at the sametime-the idea that Shane Bodwin would enter the police academy to keep what has got to be the stupidest fictional cop in screenwriting history from busting his mom&lt;end spoilers>But beyond the silliness, I think the show and the characters just have changed too much.  Even though I don't use drugs (never have), I remember thinking while watching the early episodes, ""Yes, I can see how someone would could drift into a life of crime because she had to survive and keep her family together."" But the Nancy of season 7 is a very far cry from that sympathetic soccer mom of seasons 1 to 3.In my opinion, it was a mistake to take Nancy and her clan out of the suburban domain of Egrestic.

Bullions,"[12, 18]","Last season showed our favorite antiheroine, Nancy Botwin, giving herself up to authorities, taking the rap for the murder of Pilar, which was actually committed by her son Shane. The murderer, as well as Andy and Silas were headed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to start a new life. Some were saying that could have been a great ending for the entire series, which may as well have ended at the end of season three.In all conceivable rationality, Weeds should have ended when they left Agrestic, because it became an entirely different series after this happened, but I have enjoyed every season they have done thoroughly. I think the series has thrived on change, and it proves in a fun way that people don't change, even with change constantly happening around them.In season seven, we pick up on Nancy and the Botwin clan three years later. By this time, Nancy has done three years behind bars, for ""manslaughter"", with her drug-dealing history seemingly ignored. In the first ten minutes of this season's premiere, with an anonymous deal from someone whose identity we never find, she is released from prison and sent to a halfway house in Manhattan, where she stays for about half of this season. Three years behind bars have seemingly done nothing to her emotionally, because she goes right back into dealing, and as the show's history has proven, trouble will follow her.Mary Louise-Parker (Nancy) enjoys a season full of exciting story-lines, and chances to make her character more interesting. However, the rest of the cast is given semi-lame story-lines this year. Andy, Silas and Shane come back from Copenhagen, and buy a loft in New York, hoping to leave a place for Nancy to return to, after being released from the halfway house.Silas (Hunter Parrish) has been doing male modeling in Copenhagen (which is appropriate, given how hot he's become), and he's still mad at Nancy after finding out that Judah was not his biological father. His bitchy little antics last through most of the season, and it's simply annoying for the most part. Shane (Alexander Gould) is grateful for Nancy's sacrifices for him. He's been doing marionettes puppet theater in Copenhagen for the past three years, and this season, Nancy gives him the ultimatum, ""I gave you three years, you're going to give me four"", and sends him to college.Doug (Kevin Nealon) is useless this season, as he was last year. He's still funny, but not in the same way he used to be. He's become a parody of himself, starting with last season, however, he's given a semi-decent story-line this year, which comes pretty close to redeeming his character, however, I still think he should've been given the boot when Celia was left out of the picture.Truly, this is one of the best seasons Weeds has done in a while, the best we've seen since maybe season four. It ends up being something completely different than it began. The ending was a cliff-hanger that truly bothers me, considering this may be the final season, given that it hasn't been decided yet whether there will be a season eight. I truly hope that there will be a season eight, considering that the way they ended this year is completely horrible. That season has the possibility to be better than this one.",5,Weeds Season Seven: A new beginning,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,3233,"['Last', 'season', 'showed', 'favorite', 'antiheroine', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'giving', 'authorities', 'taking', 'rap', 'murder', 'Pilar', 'was', 'actually', 'committed', 'son', 'Shane', 'murderer', 'as', 'well', 'Andy', 'Silas', 'were', 'headed', 'Copenhagen', 'Denmark', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'were', 'saying', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'ending', 'entire', 'series', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'ended', 'end', 'season', 'conceivable', 'rationality', 'Weeds', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'when', 'left', 'Agrestic', 'became', 'entirely', 'different', 'series', 'happened', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'have', 'done', 'thoroughly', 'think', 'series', 'thrived', 'change', 'fun', 'way', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'even', 'change', 'constantly', 'happening', 'them.In', 'season', 'seven', 'pick', 'up', 'Nancy', 'Botwin', 'clan', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'Nancy', 'done', 'three', 'years', 'bars', 'manslaughter', 'drug-dealing', 'history', 'seemingly', 'ignored', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'season', 'premiere', 'anonymous', 'deal', 'someone', 'identity', 'never', 'find', 'released', 'prison', 'sent', 'halfway', 'house', 'Manhattan', 'where', 'half', 'season', 'Three', 'years', 'bars', 'have', 'seemingly', 'done', 'nothing', 'emotionally', 'right', 'back', 'dealing', 'show', 'history', 'proven', 'trouble', 'will', 'follow', 'her.Mary', 'Louise-Parker', 'Nancy', 'season', 'full', 'exciting', 'story-lines', 'chances', 'make', 'character', 'more', 'interesting', 'However', 'rest', 'cast', 'given', 'semi-lame', 'story-lines', 'year', 'Andy', 'Silas', 'Shane', 'come', 'back', 'Copenhagen', 'buy', 'loft', 'New', 'York', 'hoping', 'leave', 'place', 'Nancy', 'return', 'being', 'released', 'halfway', 'house.Silas', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'been', 'doing', 'male', 'modeling', 'Copenhagen', 'appropriate', 'given', 'how', 'hot', 'become', 'still', 'mad', 'Nancy', 'finding', 'out', 'Judah', 'was', 'not', 'biological', 'father', 'bitchy', 'little', 'antics', 'last', 'most', 'season', 'simply', 'annoying', 'most', 'part', 'Shane', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'grateful', 'Nancy', 'sacrifices', 'been', 'doing', 'marionettes', 'puppet', 'theater', 'Copenhagen', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'season', 'Nancy', 'ultimatum', 'gave', 'three', 'years', ""'re"", 'going', 'give', 'four', 'college.Doug', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'useless', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'year', 'still', 'funny', 'not', 'same', 'way', 'used', 'be', 'become', 'parody', 'starting', 'last', 'season', 'however', 'given', 'semi-decent', 'story-line', 'year', 'pretty', 'close', 'redeeming', 'character', 'however', 'still', 'think', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'boot', 'when', 'Celia', 'was', 'left', 'picture.Truly', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'Weeds', 'done', 'while', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'maybe', 'season', 'four', 'up', 'being', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'began', 'ending', 'was', 'cliff-hanger', 'bothers', 'considering', 'may', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'given', ""n't"", 'been', 'decided', 'yet', 'will', 'be', 'season', 'eight', 'truly', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'season', 'eight', 'considering', 'way', 'ended', 'year', 'completely', 'horrible', 'season', 'possibility', 'be', 'better', 'one']",N/A

Weeds had some bad ass villains in years past...Armenian drug lords, crooked DEA agents, Mexican hit-men, and the great U-Turn just to name a few. How do the creators justify following those brutish adversaries with the cream puffs of season 7 which include preppy college weed dealers and effeminate male models? Perhaps the writers were smoking weed of their own while typing up the scripts. Season 7 is a throw-away. The last time I saw a show jump the shark this bad was when Stephen Urkel started inventing jet packs and personality-changing machines on Family Matters.

1433865,A10C2SBALDLKU9,B004YM6JSW,Steven Carrier,"[78, 89]","Season 7 brings the fun back to Weeds. The tone of this season is much closer to that of the first three seasons, which I think fans will appreciate.This season sees the Botwin clan relocated to New York City after Nancy is released from a 3 year prison stint. It's safe to say that the recurring theme of ""no one ever changes, ever"" is present and thriving, since Nancy picks right back off where she left off. At this point in the show, her actions are not necessarily surprising, but still insanely compelling. We have been with Nancy for 7 years now, so we know her well, just like her family we easily accept her descent back into crime. There are some differences of course, with Nancy having the smarts to reestablish her own team and openly fight for the things she believes in (instead of keeping them to herself). At least she seems to be learning, at least a little, from her past mistakes. The goddess Mary-Louise Parker still never hits a false note here. Mary-Louise always finds the comedy in Nancy's decisions and there is plenty of first rate wit coming from the actress in this season. After all, she is the reason we keep coming back to Weeds, and let me tell you, her performance this season does not disappoint! The season is best when Nancy is pitted against her nasty sister Jill (recurring guest star Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is perfection here, especially in the finale).Andy (Justin Kirk) gets the least amount to do this season, unfortunately. His story is reduced to a fling with an artist in an open marriage (Lindsay Sloane) and the occasional comic relief. Silas (a very reliable Hunter Parrish) gets the most to do, besides Nancy, this season. He sets up his own team of dealers and eventually competes against Nancy. This is the most dramatic storyline of the latter part of the season and plays out naturally and emotionally. Parker and Parrish have some fantastic scenes together. Shane (Alexander Gould) enrolls in college and gets an, ironic, internship with the NYPD for Det. Mitch Ouellette (Michael Harney). This aspect of the season works because it's ambiguous, which adds an air of mystery. Even after the finale were never sure what is going to come of this, but it's certainly leading to something big. Doug (Kevin Nealon) has relevance once again, after an aimless storyline in season 6. He gets a job on Wall Street with some old buddies and it intertwines nicely with Nancy's wheelings and dealings.With a fresh setting and a brisk pace, season 7 of Weeds brings the show back to it's roots. We get plenty of nasty humor, plenty of danger and plenty of guest stars (Martin Short, Olga Sosnovska, Pablo Schreiber, Aidan Quinn, Michelle Trachtenberg) and returning favorites (Tonye Patano, Andy Milder). If you have loved Weeds so far, season 7 will not disappoint, especially with yet another stellar Jenji Kohan-certified cliffhanger, this is a very memorable season. It may be uneven, the series has a few storytelling kinks to work out in the beginning half of the season by trying to reconnect all the Botwins, but in the end it works and opens plenty of new storytelling avenues.For Weeds fans, season 7 comes highly recommended.This Season Seven set includes the episodes:- Bags- From Trauma Cometh Something- Game-Played- A Hole In Her Niqab- Fingers Only Meat Banquet- Object Impermanence- Vehement vs. Vigorous- Synthetics- Cats! Cats! Cats!- System Overhead- Une Mere Que J'aimerais Basier- Qualitative Spatial Reasoning- Do Her/Don't Do Her",5,Season 7 brings the fun back to Weeds!,1318032000,"10 8, 2011",2011,3499,"['Season', '7', 'fun', 'back', 'Weeds', 'tone', 'season', 'much', 'closer', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'think', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate.This', 'season', 'Botwin', 'clan', 'relocated', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Nancy', 'released', '3', 'year', 'prison', 'stint', 'safe', 'say', 'recurring', 'theme', 'one', 'ever', 'ever', 'present', 'thriving', 'Nancy', 'picks', 'right', 'back', 'where', 'left', 'off', 'point', 'show', 'actions', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'surprising', 'still', 'insanely', 'compelling', 'have', 'been', 'Nancy', '7', 'years', 'now', 'know', 'well', 'just', 'family', 'easily', 'accept', 'descent', 'back', 'crime', 'are', 'differences', 'course', 'Nancy', 'having', 'smarts', 'reestablish', 'own', 'team', 'openly', 'fight', 'things', 'instead', 'keeping', 'herself', 'least', 'be', 'learning', 'least', 'little', 'past', 'mistakes', 'goddess', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'still', 'never', 'false', 'note', 'here', 'Mary-Louise', 'always', 'comedy', 'Nancy', 'decisions', 'plenty', 'first', 'rate', 'wit', 'coming', 'actress', 'season', 'reason', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'Weeds', 'let', 'tell', 'performance', 'season', 'not', 'disappoint', 'season', 'best', 'when', 'Nancy', 'pitted', 'nasty', 'sister', 'Jill', 'recurring', 'guest', 'star', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'perfection', 'here', 'especially', 'finale', '.Andy', 'Justin', 'Kirk', 'least', 'amount', 'do', 'season', 'unfortunately', 'story', 'reduced', 'fling', 'artist', 'open', 'marriage', 'Lindsay', 'Sloane', 'occasional', 'comic', 'relief', 'Silas', 'very', 'reliable', 'Hunter', 'Parrish', 'most', 'do', 'besides', 'Nancy', 'season', 'up', 'own', 'team', 'dealers', 'eventually', 'competes', 'Nancy', 'most', 'dramatic', 'storyline', 'latter', 'part', 'season', 'out', 'naturally', 'emotionally', 'Parker', 'Parrish', 'have', 'fantastic', 'scenes', 'together', 'Shane', 'Alexander', 'Gould', 'college', 'ironic', 'internship', 'NYPD', 'Det', 'Mitch', 'Ouellette', 'Michael', 'Harney', 'aspect', 'season', 'ambiguous', 'air', 'mystery', 'Even', 'finale', 'were', 'never', 'sure', 'what', 'going', 'come', 'certainly', 'leading', 'something', 'big', 'Doug', 'Kevin', 'Nealon', 'relevance', 'once', 'again', 'aimless', 'storyline', 'season', '6', 'job', 'Wall', 'Street', 'old', 'buddies', 'nicely', 'Nancy', 'wheelings', 'dealings.With', 'fresh', 'setting', 'brisk', 'pace', 'season', '7', 'Weeds', 'show', 'back', 'roots', 'get', 'plenty', 'nasty', 'humor', 'plenty', 'danger', 'plenty', 'guest', 'stars', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Olga', 'Sosnovska', 'Pablo', 'Schreiber', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'returning', 'favorites', 'Tonye', 'Patano', 'Andy', 'Milder', 'have', 'loved', 'Weeds', 'so', 'far', 'season', '7', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'especially', 'yet', 'stellar', 'Jenji', 'Kohan-certified', 'cliffhanger', 'very', 'memorable', 'season', 'may', 'be', 'uneven', 'series', 'few', 'storytelling', 'kinks', 'work', 'out', 'beginning', 'half', 'season', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'Botwins', 'end', 'plenty', 'new', 'storytelling', 'avenues.For', 'Weeds', 'fans', 'season', '7', 'highly', 'recommended.This', 'Season', 'Seven', 'set', 'episodes', 'Bags-', 'Trauma', 'Cometh', 'Something-', 'Game-Played-', 'A', 'Hole', 'Her', 'Niqab-', 'Fingers', 'Only', 'Meat', 'Banquet-', 'Object', 'Impermanence-', 'Vehement', 'Vigorous-', 'Synthetics-', 'Cats', 'Cats', 'Cats', 'System', 'Overhead-', 'Une', 'Mere', 'Que', ""J'aimerais"", 'Basier-', 'Qualitative', 'Spatial', 'Reasoning-', 'Do', 'Her/Do', ""n't"", 'Do']",N/A
