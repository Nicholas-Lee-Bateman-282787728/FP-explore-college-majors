1167464,A190T7MZ2GTJ2G,B001AQR3NK,Bri,"[1, 8]","Where do I begin? How about the amazing S3 Finale, So Long Pardor? It ended with so many cliffhangers, so many possibilities, so many different, NEW storylines to play out, especially who was in the car to pick up Kris. Just that storyline alone `Who's in the car?', could have changed every single aspect of the show in its entirety. Instead, they made it the most obvious choice. I was looking forward to seeing Kris OUT of RainTree for a good few episodes (5,6) and see her racing for Shiek O, or following through on the favor that she promised to Tina, or something other that what we got, which was her coming back to town in the 2nd episode!!!  The whole `6 Months Later' thing just doesn't cut it for me. I also hated that the writers didn't pay attention AT ALL to what the fans wanted other than to get stupid Kris/Junior back together ASAP. If the writers had paid attention to what the fans wanted, they would have looked long and hard at the ABC Family Message boards, the actual website's chatroom, and they would have seen that fans were passionate about Shiek O. He had such huge potential for Season 4 with what they could have done with his and Dani's characters, especially after her loosing RJ. Shiek O would have been the next perfect guy for Dani - a long while down the road; after all she did fall in love with a guy who ended up getting killed. But still, Shiek O and Dani could have created the next Racing Empire in Kentucky or Arizona. They also dropped Junior/Gillian with a flip of a switch. They had some great chemistry (their dance in `The Good-Bye' anyone?!) and they were getting very close at the end of Season 3. Overall, Season 4 was literally a joke. And I'm never going to quit laughing, cause that's what it all turned out to be: A joke. It's like the writers forgot what they had even done in the Season 3 finale, and just came up with random crap to get Kris and Junior back together ASAP. Another thing, if Kris and Junior had to be endgame, and they obviously had to, cause the stupid teenyboppers on the ABC Family board wouldn't quit whining each and every week, and wouldn't even consider the possibility of another ship to dominate the show other than stupid ass Krunior (bite me), the writers did it exactly right. And that's the only thing they did right - by shoving dozens upon dozens of make out scenes in our faces every episode that they were `together', which wasn't that often judging by the fact that they were constantly making up/breaking up. EVERYONE on that show is WAY. TOO. IMMATURE.  And too inexperienced to get married, to make a life-long commitment to love someone `till death do them part. The WildFire writers can all freakin' starve for all I care because Season 4 was the most laughable and biggest waste of my time I've ever spent in front of my TV screen.

1167476,AU1ROWBIOKX7X,B001AQR3NK,M. Leister,"[27, 31]","Like the last season of Ugly Betty, the first half of Wildfire's 4th season was clearly going in a different direction before it was cancelled and they hastily had to wind it up.  Unlike Betty, Wildfire put the last half of this season to use in bringing things to a close instead of dragging things out to rush the last ep.Pablo, the ex-con, and Jean, who cheated on her accountant b/f with her gambling addict ex, were way too judgemental at Chris.  I know it's on the family channel so the moral beats story at times, but come on.  However, by costing Chris her license they really wrote themselves into a corner and deux machina fixed it.  Also the clean up of Chris' ex-agent and ex-b/f was way too easy.  You can tell they knew the show was probably a goner given that a lot of the supporting cast (agent Kerry, Matt's little brother, and Danni's drug dealing ex b/f who was shaping up) were all gone as were a lot of the side stories.  I wanted to see Danni find her mom, but Junior found his and then she vanished.  Also wanted to see Tina Sharp get hers and didn't.  Plus there was that whole Pablo working undercover thing that was dropped.  They were trying to wrap things up and I appreciated it, but it wasn't perfect.My only real gripe is that the Matt/Chris/Junior triangle really never got the full treatment.  Chris was warned off Matt and went to Junior for 5 minutes before she was ordered to be loyal to Raintree and dump Junior.  Ok.  Then she was back on with Junior almost, until she wanted the agent.  Then she went to Matt and I still fail to see why everyone was against them.  It was a perfect fit since they were team Raintree.  Given that she lived in Matt's room, I expected more of him trying to get her back and more jealousy when she went to Junior than we got.  Heck, Matt should have gone to Danni, his original love interest, but he got no one and she went to a random vet.It was clear they were trying to leave things open if the show got picked up while also trying to give it an ending.  I cannot believe they canceled Wildfire a show with good stories, good writing and good acting to do Secret Life which has clunky writing and even clunkier acting.  I assume the insurance premiums got too high on a show with horses, and if you don't know racing, Wildfire's career was pretty much done when he was 5 and he missed all the big races by starting at 4 as you have to be 3 to do the Triple Crown.",4,"Good, but rushed ending",1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2435,"['last', 'season', 'Ugly', 'Betty', 'first', 'half', 'Wildfire', '4th', 'season', 'was', 'clearly', 'going', 'different', 'direction', 'was', 'cancelled', 'hastily', 'had', 'wind', 'up', 'Betty', 'Wildfire', 'put', 'last', 'half', 'season', 'use', 'bringing', 'things', 'close', 'instead', 'dragging', 'things', 'out', 'rush', 'last', 'ep.Pablo', 'ex-con', 'Jean', 'who', 'cheated', 'accountant', 'b/f', 'gambling', 'addict', 'ex', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'judgemental', 'Chris', 'know', 'family', 'channel', 'moral', 'beats', 'story', 'times', 'come', 'However', 'costing', 'Chris', 'license', 'really', 'wrote', 'corner', 'deux', 'machina', 'fixed', 'Also', 'clean', 'Chris', 'ex-agent', 'ex-b/f', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'easy', 'can', 'tell', 'knew', 'show', 'was', 'probably', 'goner', 'given', 'lot', 'supporting', 'cast', 'agent', 'Kerry', 'Matt', 'little', 'brother', 'Danni', 'drug', 'dealing', 'ex', 'b/f', 'who', 'was', 'shaping', 'up', 'were', 'gone', 'were', 'lot', 'side', 'stories', 'wanted', 'see', 'Danni', 'find', 'mom', 'Junior', 'found', 'then', 'vanished', 'Also', 'wanted', 'see', 'Tina', 'Sharp', 'get', 'hers', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'whole', 'Pablo', 'working', 'undercover', 'thing', 'was', 'dropped', 'were', 'trying', 'wrap', 'things', 'appreciated', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect.My', 'only', 'real', 'gripe', 'Matt/Chris/Junior', 'triangle', 'really', 'never', 'got', 'full', 'treatment', 'Chris', 'was', 'warned', 'off', 'Matt', 'went', 'Junior', '5', 'minutes', 'was', 'ordered', 'be', 'loyal', 'Raintree', 'dump', 'Junior', 'Ok.', 'Then', 'was', 'back', 'Junior', 'almost', 'wanted', 'agent', 'Then', 'went', 'Matt', 'still', 'fail', 'see', 'why', 'everyone', 'was', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'were', 'team', 'Raintree', 'Given', 'lived', 'Matt', 'room', 'expected', 'more', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'more', 'jealousy', 'when', 'went', 'Junior', 'got', 'Heck', 'Matt', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'Danni', 'original', 'love', 'interest', 'got', 'one', 'went', 'random', 'vet.It', 'was', 'clear', 'were', 'trying', 'leave', 'things', 'open', 'show', 'got', 'picked', 'up', 'also', 'trying', 'give', 'ending', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'canceled', 'Wildfire', 'show', 'good', 'stories', 'good', 'writing', 'good', 'acting', 'do', 'Secret', 'Life', 'clunky', 'writing', 'even', 'clunkier', 'acting', 'assume', 'insurance', 'premiums', 'got', 'too', 'high', 'show', 'horses', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'racing', 'Wildfire', 'career', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'done', 'when', 'was', '5', 'missed', 'big', 'races', 'starting', '4', 'have', 'be', '3', 'do', 'Triple', 'Crown']",Wildfire - Season 4

I can live without the fancy artwork, but Lionsgate could have put a LITTLE more effort into the Season 4 DVD release.",4,"Awesome show, poor DVD execution",1343174400,"07 25, 2012",2012,860,"['loved', 'Wildfire', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'when', 'was', 'cancelled', 'bought', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'just', 'received', 'season', '4', 'mail', 'today', 'holy', 'rushed', 'release', 'Fans', 'have', 'been', 'complaining', 'asking', 'get', 'season', '4', 'released', 'years', 'now', 'what', 'give', 'Wow', 'set', 'almost', 'bootleg', 'Season', '4', 'single', 'DVD', 'case', '4', 'discs', 'cover', 'pictured', 'blue', 'piece', 'paper', 'production', 'image', 'photoshopped', 'middle', 'abbreviated', 'show', 'description', 'back', 'other', 'artwork', 'discs', 'are', 'same', 'boring', 'grey', 'color', 'Wildfire', 'Season', '4', 'header', 'disc', 'number', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'quality', 'know', 'show', 'amazing', 'can', 'live', 'fancy', 'artwork', 'Lionsgate', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'LITTLE', 'more', 'effort', 'Season', '4', 'DVD', 'release']",Wildfire - Season 4

Not all of the violence, sex, drugs, etc...that you find in most television series now days.  I bought this as a gift...and the recipient was very pleased with it. I highly recommend this series.",4,Wonderful,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,323,"['What', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'came', 'wrapped', 'well', 'time', 'Very', 'quick', 'shipment', 'series', 'wonderful', 'watch', 'Not', 'violence', 'sex', 'drugs', 'etc', 'find', 'most', 'television', 'series', 'now', 'days', 'bought', 'gift', 'recipient', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'highly', 'recommend', 'series']",Wildfire - Season 4
