883862,A6HZN83OUPYRN,B0007NFMCG,976-ERIC,"[12, 13]","Well here it is nostalgianatics: the complete 13-episode second season of the Fred Wolf Films produced TMNT animated series on DVD. This season is marked by a notable downgrade in both stories, art and in voice-acting, though the animation remains much the same. Unlike the previous season, which had a wonderful five-part storyline where each part was a complete story unto itself and yet all were integral to the evolution of the saga (as any good serial should be), this season is very episodic, featuring one isolated wacky adventure after another (much like the comic book was becoming at the time). The one exception is the ""Eye of Sarnath"" four-part tale.The thin evolving story of the season's cycle simply concerns the Shredder trying to convince Krang to bring the Technodrome back to Earth to destroy Hamato and co. Instead he gets stuck with whatever crumbs (alien eggs, Bebop and Rocksteady) Krang will throw him and uses his own cunning and resoursefulness to fill in the gaps. Several episodes are appearing for the first time on video (in the US anyway).The four-part storyline is something of an homage to classic Science Fiction themes: shrinking people (in this case mutant turtles), nature coming to violent life, artificial intelligence adopting Social Darwinism as its credo, and the finale is of the classic I-think-it-therefore-it-is genre (which always has the tendency to be like Aladdin in some ways). This yarn is clearly the standout of the disc as it is well-paced, peppered with the right jokes at the right time and the result is not too far below the first season in quality. The gimmick that ties them all together allowing for a multi-part story exploiting every Sci-Fi cliche is the basic scavenger hunt. This results in some very conscious humor poking fun at this story-telling structure.An alien crashes to Earth interrupting a TMNT training session and tells them to find the three pieces to the Eye of Sarnath before they fall into the wrong hands. Conviently for story telling's sake, the owner of said ""wrong hands"" happens to be in the bushes eavesdropping and was apparantly observing the boys in green all the while. That's the true weakness of these supervillians, their ego is way too big to allow them to destroy the heroes in a simple efficient manner. They need to put on some huge fireworks display and trumpet their arrival and supposed imminent victory to all or thier egocentricity cannot be satisfied. Apparantly he is not a subscriber to the lesson of the French-Indian War either.Of course that is the fun of these characters (carictures?) and another example of the show's dissent into utter silliness and eventual self-parody that really picks up with season three and grows with each successive season thereafter (until the make over). The humor here is goofy, sometimes absurd though not irreverant like the next season. The action is more playful yet still more creatively storyboarded than the more choppy sequencing and less imaginative perspectives that await in season three. Inconsistency in the art is more prevalent this time and the characters are less detailed and defined than in season one.The first episode on the disc finds Shredder returning to Earth and training a band of ill-costumed turtle crooks to frame the TMNT. It is easily the weakest episode on the volume suffering from an inane plot, lame and obvious humor and an irritating exploitation of stereotype bit characters that usually works in the show's favor. This episode is the quintessence of the post-pilot seasons' qualitative decline.The Warrior Frogs of ""Invasion of the Punk Rock Frogs"" (who have nothing to do with the music, attitude or fashion sense or lack-there-of of the culture) are the Shredder's antithesis to the TMNT. They are somthing of ironic character composties being hapless innocents who are manipulated and duped by the Shredder and yet named after men who were history's quintessential villainous masterminds.""Splinter No More"" is my favorite single episode on here. It answers the big ""what if...?"" not answered in the first season: what if the TMNT had been successful in acquiring the cure for Splinter? We do the story no justice by dwelling on the large plot hole which begs the question: if they had the remainder of the original mutagen all along, why did Donatello not do this before? Well, maybe he just hadn't though of it yet? Or maybe the writers just wanted to revert him to human-state earlier in the episode so they could dedicate the story to the ethics of human conduct instead of hunting for the cure for 22 minutes like in ""Shredder & Splintered""? Anyhow, I find it notable for displaying Splinter as genuinely sad in the beginning, indeed despondent. It is one of the few times in this entire series (maybe the only time?) that real heart-felt emotion seems to come through the voice-acting and even the art that accompanies those short scenes at the latter part of the introduction (the beginning of which is one of the more hilarious opening bits they have done). Kudos to Peter Renaday and the artists at MWS! The episode exercises the ""be careful what you wish for..."" and ""people always fear what they do not understand"" dictums quite poetically (Splinter even speaks the latter for anyone who is too dull to get the point.) More subtle is the implication that when something about you changes (personality traits, social status, whatever) people, often loved ones, will not accept you any longer, sometimes out of fear that they themselves are somehow being rejected. This anxiety is expressed by the TMNT, Raphael in particular, after seeing Splinter's miraculous spiritual change, which coresponded with his physical change, and his jubulaint departure topside. There is a nice little parallel to that point in the subway scene when a mind control device of Krang's causes the green team to ditch brotherhood for every-turtle-for-himself antagonism on the spot.The Neutrinos return in ""Teenagers From Dimension X"" and once again violate the scientific principle of their namesake. Michaelangelo and Kala gush over one another throughout and although Mike saddens again when she leaves, he of course perks up when Raphael reminds him that he will always have pizza *sigh*.""New York's Shiniest"" features a mock Robocop-esque character  and has a climax inspired by the film Westworld. ""Catwoman From Channel Six"" finds April's molecules accidentally swapped with a cat ala The Fly. So the TMNT, just like Helene Delambre, search frantically for a stray cat with April's personality.In ""Enter: The Fly"" (another, more obvious though less ingeniuos, nod to the classic story) Baxter Stockman is punished by Krang for his incompetance by means of disintegration. A fly buzzes into the chamber after him and causes them to transmutate rather than simply be disintegrated along with him for reasons Krang (or the screenwriters) did not bother to explain.The finale ""Return of the Technodrome"" finds the Technodrome Earthbound and gives fans the big battle Splinter has forewarned about all season. It is action packed but not as clever or funny as other episodes on this volume.Again there are no extras, no menu music or animation. The episodes are divided into scenes this time which is nice (last time each show was one long title). Although the artwork is an improvement in tone, the bland coloring and dull background are just as lame as the sugar-coated tone of the previous volume is irritating. It is more representative of the cartoons themselves however (especially the TMNT's countenence). Hopefully we get some extras next time.- No extras, laskluster menus and artwork.+ All 13 episodes of season two on one disc for a low price.

883863,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B0007NFMCG,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[7, 14]","Who doesn't know the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo, not forgetting their ninja master Splinter, their nemesis Shredder and his cronies, mutants Rocksteady the rhino and Bebop the warthog, as well as the evil brain Krang - not forgetting hotshot reporter April O'Neil? It's not surprising how such a cast has kept such a strong fanbase for almost twenty years now.When I got the 5-episode pilot season for myself on DVD, what I got was beyond my wildest hopes; great animation, an intricate storyline and strong delivery of characters combined to a mixture that I for one felt was a very concrete piece of animated entertainment. Naturally, I was excited when I got myself Season 2. I mean, after Season 1, I had every reason to be positive. Things could only go up, right?If only they had.I loved season 1 for three things; its animation, its story and its characters. Season 2 has succeeded in failing to deliver all three. The animation goes from average to dead. The drawings are choppy and half-dimensional, and more often than not, entire scenes feel unfinished and misdirected, shattering the potential of any emotional impact.The story completely takes off on the wrong foot, too. I literally don't believe that the writer of Season 2's first episode, ""Return of the Shredder"", even watched the final episode of the first season, in which Bebop and Rocksteady were stuck in cement following another lost battle with the turtles. In ""Return of the Shredder"", somehow they have been transported to Dimension X, which makes no sense; and this is only the beginning of a LONG list of inconsistencies that's going to plague the writing as the season goes on.Furthermore, the personalities of the characters took a dramatic nosedive. Rocksteady and Bebop, in Season 1, were charismatically violent, not to mention quite conscious of their strength and power. But in Season 2 they are irritating, useless and, worst of all, cowards. Their voice actors seem to be having immense difficulties in giving their voices, too, unlike (again) Season 1. All the characters, in fact, feel stale and, for lack of a better word, ""clumsy"" as compared to their Season 1 counterparts.And if this isn't bad enough, the entire first half of this season all but ignores Krang, Rocksteady and Bebop; indeed, the latter two are as good as absent for the first half of this season. Instead, a story about an alien crystal, the 'Eye of Sornath', becomes the main attraction (or rather de-attraction). Not only is this story uninteresting, but it has also nothing to do with the spirit of the Ninja Turtles universe. After the dull story draws to an equally dull close, Rocksteady and Bebop DO return, as do half-decent plots - but watch Season 1 and you'll see that you don't have too much of a reason to be thankful. There are no multiple-part stories (and those won't return until the end of Season 3), and the ones we DO receive, while sometimes containing interesting plot prospects, are so badly written it leaves me speechless (""Teenagers from Dimension X"" in particular springs to mind).There are positive things to be said for this season, though (YES, there are). Season 2 marks the first appearance of April's coworkers; her best friend Irma, and the irritating toady Vernon. These two characters, along with Rocksteady and Bebop, since become almost solely responsible for the show's considerable comic relief. Both make me laugh more than anything else in this show.But that's it for the good spots. Rewind back and read and I still mean each and every one of the words I've typed down. The last episode of this season, which is supposed to serve as a kind of climax, falls flat on its face in its attempt by eye-burning animation, lame plot-progress and a nonsensical ending. The music, one of the few trademarks of the season that are (unfortunately) going to stay, is very weak, too, sounding like a series of chopped up mixtures of various instruments - like it's trying more than it can handle. If you loved the rock ambience from Season 1, enjoy it, as you won't find it in Season 2.Season 3 is somewhere in between Season 1 and 2. Often, its plots shine as well as its animation. I would advise you to skip this heap of rubbish and go straight to that season. The bottom has been obtained. Things can only go up from here.To put it simply: What were you thinking?(""It came from beneath the sewers"" and ""Teenagers from Dimension X"": if you must, watch these episodes just to get a graphic demonstration of my words.)The picture quality is very bad, too.",1,"After season 1, you have got to be kidding me",1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,4596,"['Who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Teenage',

The complete second season of the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon is one of my favorites, with 13 classic episodes from the show.  However, the violence was turned down a bit from the 1st season.  The Turtles do not use their weapons that much, whereas they often fought with them during season 1.  Also, the humor has been upped quite a bit, with some real tongue-in-cheek moments(although the original comic did notably have a few as well).  But then again, not to say that was a bad thing, as that was one of the things that made this series memorable.  The season starts off with Shredder's return, aided by inept inventor Baxter Stockman once more.  The next 4 episodes feature a subplot of 3 alien crystals known as the ""eye of Sarnath.""  The Turtles and Shredder race to collect them each, but the 3 crystals wind up causing all sorts of mayhem, from bringing machines to life to creating insane killer plant monsters, and the Turtles must deal with the havoc.  ""Case of the Killer Pizzas"" is the classic episode with those monster meatballs monsters, and boy are they ugly.  The Turtles have to reluctantly team up with Shredder when the creatures get too out of hand.  Bebop and Rocksteady return in ""Enter: The Fly,"" when Shredder poisons April, in an attempt to take the Turtles out when they try to retrieve the antidote.  Things go from bad to worse when Baxter is merged with a fly and attempts to take both groups out.  ""Splinter No More,"" sees Splinter become Hamato Yoshi again!  The Turtles wind up chasing Shredder again, but he leaves a little trap that ends up turning them against each other!  The Neutrinos come back in ""Teenagers from Dimension X,"" and those frogs make their first appearance in ""Invasion of the Punk Frogs.""  ""New York's Shiniest"" is a hilarious episode in which the Turtles meet a cybernetic cop, REX-1.  April gets her genes merged with a cat, ""The Fly"" style, in ""Catwoman From Channel Six.""  In that episode, Irma also meets the Turtles for the first time.  The final episode is ""Return of the Technodrome,"" a great episode in which the Technodrome returns to Earth!  These are some excellent episodes, some I haven't seen in a long time!

This release has all 13 episodes of Season 2 on one disc.  This means that they used higher compression on each episode to fit that many episodes.  As a result, the video quality is lessened.  Each episode takes up about 650 MB of space, when the average is about 800 to 900.  Lionsgate could have easily just released these episodes across 2 discs instead of trying to save money by only pressing one.  So, the production quality could have been better.As for the episodes themselves, Season 2 is probably the best season of the series.  This season was made before the decision to send the series entirely in the comedy vein.  Also, this was before David Wise took over writing the majority of episodes, as would happen in later seasons.  While not an entirely serious series, of course, the episodes in season 2 are generally better because they have a level of drama to them.  They balance out the comedy with a straight story that was entirely abandoned after season 2 and only restored in season 10.  (Unfortunately, Season 10 was headed by Jeffrey Scott, whose vast majority of work was comedy based.

After watching most of this DVD, though, I've come to the realiziation that (as far as I can deduce) most of the stunning moments of animation artistry that lie dormant in my memory are those found namely in the show's first season. What I recall of them is that they were bold, climactic, serious, and slick. Dramatic, even. PERHAPS my mind is deluding me, but I know this -- they were in no way fathomable as putrid or inane as the episodes here.Just nothing of appeal here. Everything is so, ahem, goofy. Like, fruity (using that with no homosexual connotations...) Everything just feels off,  and for the very worst. The plots are non-existent or just downright idiotic, and I have no intention of placing some sort of demand on quality plots here... There's just no scope to any of them, so who cares? Again, everything just feels... commercialized? I don't want to say that, though, because it seems like a much worse transition than to being merely for popular consumption; it feels for some reason what I figured the show would feel like by season 5 or so, after it had hit its peak and been taken over by a different crew and being set up for a changing demographic. The pitches of the voices seem higher. The turtles' faces seem extra round and... like... cheery-bright-prozac-happy faces. The only thing that retains some likeliness is the music, with the synthesized droning I came to love and associate with the show over time.Hmmm.....it's like... You ever see Don Bluth's ""The Land Before Time"" or ""An American Tail""? Then proceeded to see one of the horrendous sequels? I think this can apply for a lot of animated feats, actually. This is just what I feel like... Almost EVERY lick of substance that at one point existed in the show is null, void with season 2.But I'm somewhat perplexed because it's season 2... The show just started. I had no intentions of watching this one before checking out Volume 1, but through a mishap I ended up receiving it instead, so I'll be sure to check out 1 soon...

No more garage sale searches for me! It was fun to see these old shows again, but they are ""the oranges"" to the current series' ""apples."" While the new series more closely ties to the original comic series, the first animated series, created in part to add to action figure marketing, is a much lighter (especially the 2nd season) and condensed version. The history of the characters is geared for a younger audience, for example in ""Splinter No More,"" sees Splinter become Hamato Yoshi again. In the 90's series Splinter is Master Yoshi mutated, rather than a pet.  Also includes some classic video rental store staples: ""The Return of the Shredder,"" ""The Incredible Shrinking Turtles,"" ""It came from Beneath the Sewers."" ""Teenagers from Dimension X,"" has teenagers from Dimension X, in it.  ""Invasion of the Punk Frogs,"" features the introduction of more mutants. ""Enter: The Fly,"" with Dr. Stockman of the 90's, vaguely spoofs the Vincent Price fly movies.  Other episodes are ""New York's Shiniest"" a Robocop spoof.  The final episode of the season is ""Return of the Technodrome,"" an episode in which, you guessed it, the Technodrome and Krang  return to Earth.The current generation of turtle fans will still appreciate this alternate selection of episodes, it will also give them an opportunity to get many of the inside-jokes in the current series (like Krang's cameo, April's news reporter disquise).One major flaw of the DVD is the lack of special features and extras, even the games have more extras than this DVD.

An baxter returns when shredder breaks him out of the prison like cell for previous season mousers thing.Eye of sarnoth is the 4 episode where its just shredder alone with human baxter an he betrays shredder on curse of evil eye, Like...I baxter stockman had accomplish something that shredder could not.Enter the fly, shredder: Good riddings too bad rubush, like throws baxter into the portal in return of the 2 mutant punks(Rocksteady n Bebop). Revenge revenge I must have revenge against my enemies!!!..The Turtles. Flies down too try too get em. Baxter: The turtles escape but Shredder wont, he's the one thats responcable for what happen too me!An next episode where they have the mutant frogs that thinks the turtles are evil, still another good episode too but the story line is pretty corny.an end of 2nd season the technodrome returns, k enuff of that talk.season 1 the technodrome is roaming around under groundseason 2 technodrome is in deminsion Xseason 3 technodrome is back on earth but stuck under the groundseason 4 technodrome is back in deminsion xseason 5 technodrome is in north poleseason 6 and 7 the technodrome is under the waterseason 8 technodrome is in deminsion x again but with shredder an krang on earthseason 9, theres no technodrome on that seasonseason 10 the technodrome looks like a piece of junk sitting in deminsion x because the turtles destoryed the engines end of 8th season an the alien plant finishes off rest of the technodrome.I am still waiting for 9th an 10th season too be release onto dvd because I wanna see the old episodes again, even though its dregg an his aliens not shredder anymore.Shredder & krang comes back on season 10 but on 3 episodes because mung(one with dregg), met em in deminsion x an shredder said that him an krang destoryed the turltes but were obviously lying.An it was will e martin on 8th an 10th seasons on shredder's voice.Uncle Phil character on FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR did shredder's voice on most episodes on all 7 seasons from 1 to season 7.I think it was knight of the dark turtle episode on 7th season was the last James Avery voice on shredder episode?Or it could've been Shredders Trumplinet(excuse my spelling), where the turtles gets stuck in deminsion X an shredder, krang an the 2 punks takes over the city, at end turtles comes back an donatello uses some remote too place the technodrome into Deminsaion X with only rock sholdiers in it...leaving them having no contact with technodrome, an starting 8th season like that but will e martin continues/takes place of James Avery.",5,Turtle Power!!!

Here is an episode run down.The Return of Shredder: Shredder returns and tries to frame the Turtles for his small and petty crimes. Its a fun little episode and has some good humor. 4/5The Incredible Shrinking Turtles: An alien crash lands on Earth telling them of a powerfull crystal. The Turtles try to find it but Shredder shrinks them. Very good episode and has Shredder fight and beat the Turtles. 5/5It Came from Beneath the Sewers: Shredder and Baxter get their crystal to touch a plant and it grows. It was corny but fun at least for a little while. 3/5The Mean Machines: Shredder finds the final piece of the crystal and figures out it can take control of any computer. Leading to an army of machines! Fun and pretty clever too. 4/5Curse of the Evil Eye: Shredder creates the greatest power on Earth only to have it stolen and used by Baxter. The Turtles must keep Shredder from using it to rule the Earth. Very good episode lots of action and suspense. 5/5The Case of the Killer Pizza's: Shredder uses Xenomorph type aliens to kill the Turtles. A very good episode and has my fav one time monsters. 5/5Enter the Fy: Baxter is changed to a fly mutant and helps Shredder. Bebop and Rockstead come back. It was cool and had an awesome ending. 4/5Splinter no More: Splinter is transformed into a human again but the Turtles think he may never come back. Very touching and emotional episode. One of the seasons best. 5/5Teenagers from Dimension X: The Nuetrinos return for another adventure. Mikey and Cala's relatioship begin to bud. It was cool to see them back but the end is very stupid. A car alarm my ass. 3/5Invasion of the Punk Frogs: What if Shredder had trained his own mutants? This answers that question. Pretty cool and nice to see them have counterparts. 4/5New Yorks Shiniest: April finds an experimental robo cop which follows her. Shredder manages to take over New York. Very good episode with a humorous conclusion. 4/5Catwoman from Channel 6: April is a cat woman. Its stupid. 1/5The Return of the Technodrome: Krang wishes to come back and finish what he started.

883901,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B0007NFMCG,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[6, 6]","This DVD contains all 13 episodes from the second season of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series from the 80s. And if you grew up on these shows, like I did, then you will be pleasantly surprised to see them here ""again for the first time.""Obviously the cartoon is geared towards kids, that's why we watched it two decades ago when we were kids. For the reviewers complaining about the poor drawings and lack of action, what did you expect? Were you a brilliant cartoon critic when you were [...]? No, but I bet you appreciated the ninja turtles for what they are.For a little under $9.00 on Amazon, you can get all 13 episodes from the second season. I can't think of a better deal than that. Unlike other shows from the 80s that have lost most of their appeal today, the stories are still interesting and the jokes, while lame, are lame enough to still be funny. The opening sequence with the theme song is just as exciting today as it was when the episodes were originally aired.These episodes contain some great stuff. Shredder comes back from Dimension X to destroy the turtles by Krang's demands. Baxter Stockman is freed from prison, and eventually becomes the mutant fly we know him as. Bebop and Rocksteady show up again. April O'Neill gets mutated into a catwoman, Splinter gets a brief stint as a human again, Napoleon Bonafrog (and three other mutated frogs are created), the Neutrinos appear for an episode, and Shredder launches all kinds of bumbled attempts to attack the turtles, before Krang ultimately comes back from Dimension X in the Technodrome.Children of the 80s, don't miss this DVD!",5,Just as good as it was 20 years ago!,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1620,"['DVD', '13', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'original', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'series', '80s', 'grew', 'up', 'shows', 'did', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'here', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'Obviously', 'cartoon', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'why', 'watched', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'reviewers', 'complaining', 'poor', 'drawings', 'lack', 'action', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'Were', 'brilliant', 'cartoon', 'critic', 'when', 'were', '[', ']', 'No', 'bet', 'appreciated', 'ninja', 'turtles', 'what', 'are.For', 'little', '9.00', 'Amazon', 'can', 'get', '13', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'deal', 'other', 'shows', '80s', 'have', 'lost', 'most', 'appeal', 'today', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'interesting', 'jokes', 'lame', 'are', 'lame', 'enough', 'still', 'be', 'funny', 'opening', 'sequence', 'theme', 'song', 'just', 'exciting', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'aired.These', 'episodes', 'contain', 'great', 'stuff', 'Shredder', 'back', 'Dimension', 'X', 'destroy', 'turtles', 'Krang', 'demands', 'Baxter', 'Stockman', 'freed', 'prison', 'eventually', 'mutant', 'fly', 'know', 'Bebop', 'Rocksteady', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'April', ""O'Neill"", 'mutated', 'catwoman', 'Splinter', 'brief', 'stint', 'human', 'again', 'Napoleon', 'Bonafrog', 'three', 'other', 'mutated', 'frogs', 'are', 'created', 'Neutrinos', 'appear', 'episode', 'Shredder', 'kinds', 'bumbled', 'attempts', 'attack', 'turtles', 'Krang', 'ultimately', 'back', 'Dimension', 'X', 'Technodrome.Children', '80s', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'DVD']",N/A
