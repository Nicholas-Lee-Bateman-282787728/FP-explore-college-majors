This heartwarming tale pulled at my heartstrings many times and at I had tears in my eyes.Smitty is a story about Ben (Brandon Tyler Russell). Ben is a young inner-city boy who gets in trouble with the law. With no father in the house and being estranged from her own father, Ben's mother (Mira Sorvino) has two choices presented her by the judge, Ben can spend years in a detention center for a crime he was present for or he can spend three months in the country with his grandfather (Peter Fonda).His grandfather is at first a surly man, dead set in his ways and Ben wants no part of it. His grandfather gives him something that he feels will teach him responsibility, a dog that Ben names Dog.During his stay, Ben comes in contact with other, older teenagers that are not teens you would want your boy to be hanging around with. He also meets Smitty, a pawn store owner who is portrayed by Louis Gossett Jr.Dog is one cute little mutt and at times he steals the show. There is a scene with Dog driving a lawn tractor that is priceless. Not wanting to give too much away, I will leave you with this.  Their are many lessons to be learned along the way in this film and the movie kept my sons attention from beginning to end. SMITTY is definitely a movie that the whole family from young to old can truly enjoy.",5,A heartwarming tale the whole family will love.,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",2012,1474,"['sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'Smitty', 'family', 'thought', 'would', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'pulled', 'heartstrings', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes.Smitty', 'story', 'Ben', 'Brandon', 'Tyler', 'Russell', 'Ben', 'young', 'inner-city', 'boy', 'who', 'trouble', 'law', 'father', 'house', 'being', 'estranged', 'own', 'father', 'Ben', 'mother', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'two', 'choices', 'presented', 'judge', 'Ben', 'can', 'spend', 'years', 'detention', 'center', 'crime', 'was', 'present', 'can', 'spend', 'three', 'months', 'country', 'grandfather', 'Peter', 'Fonda', '.His', 'grandfather', 'first', 'surly', 'man', 'dead', 'set', 'ways', 'Ben', 'part', 'grandfather', 'something', 'will', 'teach', 'responsibility', 'dog', 'Ben', 'Dog.During', 'stay', 'Ben', 'contact', 'other', 'older', 'teenagers', 'are', 'not', 'would', 'want', 'boy', 'be', 'hanging', 'also', 'Smitty', 'pawn', 'store', 'owner', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.Dog', 'one', 'cute', 'little', 'mutt', 'times', 'show', 'scene', 'Dog', 'driving', 'lawn', 'tractor', 'priceless', 'Not', 'wanting', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'way', 'film', 'movie', 'kept', 'sons', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end', 'SMITTY', 'definitely', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'young', 'old', 'can', 'truly', 'enjoy']",Smitty

1523965,A2WLQPEHMXYI04,B0070ZDMZ8,"Elizabeth ""Denver Mommy""","[2, 2]","This movie is just not family friendly --- not the kind of role modeling most parents want for their kids.  Ben, the main child character who is 13, says &#34;sucks&#34; and &#34;hate&#34; many times in the movie, and one scene after the other is just sad, sad, sad.Ben doesn't know who his Dad is, the only other relative he has besides his Mom is his grandfather, whom his mother hasn't spoken to since she was pregnant with Ben.  Ben starts going to a new school and some boys trick him into vandalizing a restaurant.  He gets caught because the other boys lock him in the restaurant's freezer before they flee, and the judge gives his mother the option of sending him to juvenile detention for years, or going back and living with his grandfather in Iowa for three months.  She chooses the latter.While Ben is in Iowa, he does yard work for his grandfather's friend (Smitty).  Ben saves his money all summer to buy a guitar in Smitty's pawn shop, and the day he goes to buy it, some boys follow him into the shop and take both Ben's money and the guitar.  The same day, he returns to Smitty's house empty handed and finds Smitty lying dead in the yard.There are also scenes where the dog isn't treated well, including one where the dog is hit by a car.  At every turn, we found ourselves hoping for something encouraging, and the few minutes of &#34;happy&#34; at the end seemed like they were stuck in there as a shallow, last-minute attempt to make the story redemptive.In the end, my 11 year old son said, &#34;That was a terrible movie.  I wish I wouldn't have watched it. I want to throw it away.&#34;",1,So Disappointed --- Not Good for Kids and Just Plain Depressing for Everyone,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,1610,"['movie', 'just', 'not', 'family', 'friendly', 'not', 'kind', 'role', 'modeling', 'most', 'parents', 'want', 'kids', 'Ben', 'main', 'child', 'character', 'who', '13', '34', 'sucks', '34', '34', 'hate', '34', 'many', 'times', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'other', 'just', 'sad', 'sad', 'sad.Ben', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Dad', 'only', 'other', 'relative', 'Mom', 'grandfather', 'whom', 'mother', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'going', 'new', 'school', 'boys', 'trick', 'vandalizing', 'restaurant', 'caught', 'other', 'boys', 'lock', 'restaurant', 'freezer', 'flee', 'judge', 'mother', 'option', 'sending', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'years', 'going', 'back', 'living', 'grandfather', 'Iowa', 'three', 'months', 'latter.While', 'Ben', 'Iowa', 'yard', 'work', 'grandfather', 'friend', 'Smitty', 'Ben', 'money', 'summer', 'buy', 'guitar', 'Smitty', 'pawn', 'shop', 'day', 'buy', 'boys', 'follow', 'shop', 'take', 'Ben', 'money', 'guitar', 'same', 'day', 'Smitty', 'house', 'empty', 'handed', 'Smitty', 'lying', 'dead', 'yard.There', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'where', 'dog', ""n't"", 'treated', 'well', 'including', 'one', 'where', 'dog', 'hit', 'car', 'turn', 'found', 'hoping', 'something', 'encouraging', 'few', 'minutes', '34', 'happy', '34', 'end', 'seemed', 'were', 'stuck', 'there', 'shallow', 'last-minute', 'attempt', 'make', 'story', 'end', '11', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'said', '34', 'was', 'terrible', 'movie', 'wish', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'want', 'throw', 'away.', '34']",Smitty
1523966,A1FPP34DESLHGQ,B0070ZDMZ8,Irish Gal,"[0, 2]","I liked the movie, but after watching a 2nd time I found some major flaws. If a person veiws this more than one time they will eventually see the flaws.This movie is good, but I found some conflicting issues. First, when Ben broke into the restaurant the cops said he pilfered a thousand dollars from the restaurant. Poor police work not to search Ben or the cooler he was locked in. So why didn't the cops find the money on him or search the cooler for it? He supposedly took the money he then would have it on his person being he was locked in the restaurant cooler. Hard to spend money when your locked in a cooler. Think they could have found a smarter scenario than the restaurant robbery and vandalism. I do not know who wrote this movie but feel they were not thorough enough in their writing.I can see where Ben gets his attitude. He got it from his irresponsible mother. A gal that never showed up for her own mother's funeral, gets pregnant, drops out of college, moves around all the time where her son has no stability, never contacted her dad after he searched and searched for her when her mother passed away and more. She is not setting a good example to her son. She even has the same attitude as her son does so we know where he gets his attitude. She treats her dad as if he is a piece of trash when her dad does everything to straighten out and teach responsibility to her son. Goes to show how irresponsible she is when she cannot straighten out her own son and has to have her dad do it. She gives her dad nasty looks when they first meet up at 13-years of not seeing each other. Her dad was strict and that is as it should be. She is a ungrateful person. She tells her son, ""Life is not about you"". Well, she certainly didn't live by that rule herself. I noted Ben's mother is never around when he gets into trouble. Doesn't she know what responsible child care is? She just lets him roam the streets and he gets into trouble. Then she tells her co-workers, ""Ben and I are doing just fine"". The heck they are. If they were doing fine, he would not have gotten into so much legal trouble and his grandfather has to bail him out of the trouble. Ben is a nave brat. He falls into traps with bad kids and he gets himself into trouble. Then he pouts when he thinks he has to have something. He does not know how to work for he wants. He has no respect for anyone.They made Ben's character highly cocky/disrespectful. I highly dislike it when he uses the word `hate' numerous times throughout the movie. I just cringed when he said 'hate'. They could have found a more diplomatic response other than 'hate'. To me this is teaching child viewers a bad example.Then the scene where that young juvenile kicks Smitty (Freddy James, Dog) in the antique shop is very wrong and is again setting a bad example to children viewing the movie. I know the dog wasn't really kicked. However, children will think they can go around kicking dogs or some other form of abuse towards an animal. They could have very well left that part out. I do not know what these writers were thinking. Then after the juvenile kicked Dog, they never showed any concern. If someone were to kick my dog I certainly would be concerned for my dog by checking to see if he or she was injured and take action. Seems the only one in the movie that respected Dog was Peter Fonda and Louis Gossett Jr.This movie was over rated with all of its flaws. The main reason for the movie is to promote rescue and pet adoption. Kicking the dog in the movie showed minimal respect towards pets and yet they are promoting rescue and adoption. Very contradictory. Nevertheless, the writer(s) could have done a much better job.I do not recommend children see this movie as it sets some very bad examples. If parents wish their children to view it, I suggest the parents sit with their children and explain why this happened or that happened such as Dog/Smitty being kicked and even left on a road side during a severe thunderstorm. The only one's that were good in the movie were Peter Fonda, Jason London, and Louis Gossett, Jr.",3,"Cute, but has major flaws",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,4092,"['liked', 'movie', 'watching', '2nd', 'time', 'found', 'major', 'flaws', 'person', 'veiws', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'will', 'eventually', 'see', 'flaws.This', 'movie', 'good', 'found', 'conflicting', 'issues', 'First', 'when', 'Ben', 'broke', 'restaurant', 'cops', 'said', 'pilfered', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'restaurant', 'Poor', 'police', 'work', 'not', 'search', 'Ben', 'cooler', 'was', 'locked', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'cops', 'find', 'money', 'search', 'cooler', 'supposedly', 'took', 'money', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'person', 'being', 'was', 'locked', 'restaurant', 'cooler', 'Hard', 'spend', 'money', 'when', 'locked', 'cooler', 'Think', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'smarter', 'scenario', 'restaurant', 'robbery', 'vandalism', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'wrote', 'movie', 'feel', 'were', 'not', 'thorough', 'enough', 'writing.I', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'Ben', 'attitude', 'got', 'irresponsible', 'mother', 'gal', 'never', 'showed', 'up', 'own', 'mother', 'funeral', 'pregnant', 'college', 'moves', 'time', 'where', 'son', 'stability', 'never', 'contacted', 'dad', 'searched', 'searched', 'when', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'more', 'not', 'setting', 'good', 'example', 'son', 'even', 'same', 'attitude', 'son', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'attitude', 'dad', 'piece', 'trash', 'when', 'dad', 'everything', 'straighten', 'out', 'teach', 'responsibility', 'son', 'show', 'how', 'irresponsible', 'when', 'can', 'not', 'straighten', 'out', 'own', 'son', 'have', 'dad', 'do', 'dad', 'nasty', 'looks', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'up', '13-years', 'not', 'seeing', 'other', 'dad', 'was', 'strict', 'should', 'be', 'ungrateful', 'person', 'son', 'Life', 'not', 'Well', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'rule', 'noted', 'Ben', 'mother', 'never', 'around', 'when', 'trouble', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'responsible', 'child', 'care', 'just', 'roam', 'streets', 'trouble', 'Then', 'co-workers', 'Ben', 'are', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'heck', 'are', 'were', 'doing', 'fine', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'much', 'legal', 'trouble', 'grandfather', 'bail', 'trouble', 'Ben', 'nave', 'brat', 'traps', 'bad', 'kids', 'trouble', 'Then', 'when', 'have', 'something', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'work', 'respect', 'anyone.They', 'made', 'Ben', 'character', 'highly', 'cocky/disrespectful', 'highly', 'dislike', 'when', 'word', 'hate', 'numerous', 'times', 'movie', 'just', 'cringed', 'when', 'said', ""'hate"", 'could', 'have', 'found', 'more', 'diplomatic', 'response', 'other', 'teaching', 'child', 'viewers', 'bad', 'example.Then', 'scene', 'where', 'young', 'juvenile', 'kicks', 'Smitty', 'Freddy', 'James', 'Dog', 'antique', 'shop', 'very', 'wrong', 'again', 'setting', 'bad', 'example', 'children', 'viewing', 'movie', 'know', 'dog', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'kicked', 'However', 'children', 'will', 'think', 'can', 'go', 'around', 'kicking', 'dogs', 'other', 'form', 'abuse', 'towards', 'animal', 'could', 'have', 'very', 'well', 'left', 'part', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'writers', 'were', 'thinking', 'Then', 'juvenile', 'kicked', 'Dog', 'never', 'showed', 'concern', 'someone', 'were', 'kick', 'dog', 'certainly', 'would', 'be', 'concerned', 'dog', 'checking', 'see', 'was', 'injured', 'take', 'action', 'only', 'one', 'movie', 'respected', 'Dog', 'was', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.This', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'rated', 'flaws', 'main', 'reason', 'movie', 'promote', 'rescue', 'pet', 'adoption', 'Kicking', 'dog', 'movie', 'showed', 'minimal', 'respect', 'towards', 'pets', 'yet', 'are', 'promoting', 'rescue', 'adoption', 'Very', 'contradictory', 'Nevertheless', 'writer', 's', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'children', 'see', 'movie', 'very', 'bad', 'examples', 'parents', 'wish', 'children', 'view', 'suggest', 'parents', 'sit', 'children', 'explain', 'why', 'happened', 'happened', 'such', 'Dog/Smitty', 'being', 'kicked', 'even', 'left', 'road', 'side', 'severe', 'thunderstorm', 'only', 'one', 'were', 'good', 'movie', 'were', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Jason', 'London', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr']",Smitty

It's a family friendly film that entertains while it teaches lessons of friendship and responsibility.Thirteen-year-old Ben (Brandon Tyler Russell) moves a lot with his single mom, Amanda (Mira Sorvino) and it seems, wherever he lands, he finds trouble. It happens again and he finds himself in front of the judge. The judge gives Ben and Amanda two options. Either Ben goes to juveniledetention for three years or goes to live on his grandfather's farm in Iowa for three months. He's never met Jack (Peter Fonda) his grandfather, because of some bad blood between Jack and Amanda.Jack immediately gives the boy chores to the point where Ben longs for juvenile detention. His grandfather decides Ben needs a friend so carries him to the animal shelter and they adopt a dog. The boy claims he doesn't like pets, but when forced gives the puppy a name, he chooses ""dog.""He continues his rebellious nature at a pawn shop run by Smitty (Louis Gossett, Jr.) demanding Jack to buy him an electric guitar, rationalizing that he hasn't been in his life for 13 years so he owes him that and more.Of course, the grandfather says no. The only way Ben can have the guitar is if he earns it. Smitty offers to put Ben to work removing a stump. This is one monster stump, leftover from an elm that was struck by lighting.If you have a son, or grandson who's in his preteens and full of himself -- you need to rent or buy Smitty.",5,Smitty entertains and teaches important lessons,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,1541,"['Jim', 'Clark', 'publisher', 'Lee', 'County', 'Courier', 'Tupelo', 'MSIf', 'Smitty', ""n't"", 'pull', 'heartstrings', 'better', 'head', 'ER', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', 'lessons', 'friendship', 'responsibility.Thirteen-year-old', 'Ben', 'Brandon', 'Tyler', 'Russell', 'lot', 'single', 'mom', 'Amanda', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'wherever', 'trouble', 'again', 'front', 'judge', 'judge', 'Ben', 'Amanda', 'two', 'options', 'Ben', 'juveniledetention', 'three', 'years', 'live', 'grandfather', 'farm', 'Iowa', 'three', 'months', 'never', 'met', 'Jack', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'grandfather', 'bad', 'blood', 'Jack', 'Amanda.Jack', 'immediately', 'boy', 'point', 'where', 'Ben', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'grandfather', 'Ben', 'friend', 'so', 'animal', 'shelter', 'adopt', 'dog', 'boy', ""n't"", 'like', 'pets', 'when', 'forced', 'puppy', 'name', 'dog', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'pawn', 'shop', 'run', 'Smitty', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'demanding', 'Jack', 'buy', 'electric', 'guitar', 'rationalizing', ""n't"", 'been', 'life', '13', 'years', 'so', 'more.Of', 'course', 'grandfather', 'only', 'way', 'Ben', 'can', 'have', 'guitar', 'Smitty', 'offers', 'put', 'Ben', 'work', 'removing', 'stump', 'one', 'monster', 'stump', 'leftover', 'elm', 'was', 'struck', 'lighting.If', 'have', 'son', 'grandson', 'who', 'preteens', 'full', 'need', 'rent', 'buy', 'Smitty']",Smitty
