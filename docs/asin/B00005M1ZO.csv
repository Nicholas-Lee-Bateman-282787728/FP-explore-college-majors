664818,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00005M1ZO,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 2]","Director Malcolm St. Clair's adaptation of the George Kelly stageplay THE SHOW-OFF is actually a Ford Sterling vehicle, despite cover art depicting Louise Brooks, who here portrays the girlfriend of a secondary character.Sterling is best known as Chief of Mack Sennett's Keystone Kops. In this story he's the bragadocious J. Aubrey Piper, a carnation-wearing railroad clerk claiming to be a wealthy company big shot. Aubrey proposes to Amy Fisher (Wilson), which displeases her parents who are little-impressed with him, as they've been told the truth about their future son-in-law's lowly position and net worth. The two marry anyway, and spendthrift Aubrey is unable to support his bride on a clerk's pay.After he wins a car in a raffle, Aubrey (who doesn't know how to operate it) causes several accidents by driving on the wrong side of the road. In the process of crashing the auto, Aubrey pins a traffic cop against a wall. In court he's unable to pay a $1,000 fine, so his brother Joe (Kelly) helps out, which causes a whole new set of problems.In 1946, Red Skelton starred in one of the many remakes ofTHE SHOW OFF(1946).

Rodriguez ""Arex""","[2, 2]","The quality of The Show-Off is stellar while the transfer quality of The Plasic Age is as good as they could get it (there is some aging discoloration). I came away from the viewings with a concrete opinion of what separates Louise Brooks from the silent greats of her time. Ms. Brooks --through her onscreen pressence, natural talent and breath-taking beauty-- can take small bit roles and morph them into major parts. She does this sans the usual golden-locked cheeky or raven-haired mall acts of the day. She's herself (love her or loathe her)... thank the film gods for that. If you're a fan of Lulu and/or the silent age, you owe it to yourself to add this double bill to your collection.",5,Definitive Double Bill,1229904000,"12 22, 2008",2008,693,"['quality', 'Show-Off', 'stellar', 'transfer', 'quality', 'Plasic', 'Age', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'get', 'aging', 'discoloration', 'came', 'away', 'viewings', 'concrete', 'opinion', 'what', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'silent', 'greats', 'time', 'Ms.', 'Brooks', 'onscreen', 'pressence', 'natural', 'talent', 'breath-taking', 'beauty', 'can', 'take', 'small', 'bit', 'roles', 'morph', 'major', 'parts', 'usual', 'golden-locked', 'cheeky', 'raven-haired', 'mall', 'acts', 'day', 'love', 'loathe', 'thank', 'film', 'gods', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Lulu', 'and/or', 'silent', 'age', 'owe', 'add', 'double', 'bill', 'collection']",N/A
664820,AH9K6PPVZKVY3,B00005M1ZO,Barbara (Burkowsky) Underwood,"[17, 17]","This double-feature DVD is very enjoyable to watch, not only for the two popular ""Jazz Age"" stars, Louise Brooks and Clara Bow, but for the overall light and 'feel-good' themes.  Despite being of the light entertainment variety, both films have a good story and message with a satisfying ending, and all other aspects of both films are of high quality.  There might be a few little disappointments however:  while stunning and unmissable, Louise Brooks plays only a small part in ""The Show Off"", and the picture quality of ""The Plastic Age"" is nowhere near as good as the pristine quality of the first film.  These things aside, I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Show Off"" and Ford Sterling's entertaining performance as the big-mouthed braggart who gets on everyone's nerves except for Amy, who thinks he's wonderful and ends up marrying him despite her family's disapproval.  It's not all laughs, though:  Amy's family falls on bad times and ""The Show Off"" gets a chance to use his big-talk talent for a good purpose, for a change.  Very nicely and expertly directed by Malcolm St Clair who made a name for himself as a top director in the late 1920s.""The Plastic Age"" story is just perfect for 'the IT girl' Clara Bow, who steals the show with her charming playfulness in the role of a popular girl who flirts with college boys.  One naive and serious college student falls for her and, consequently, falls into bad habits of late night parties which badly affect his college performance.  This one also has a nice and happy ending though, and both of these films are sure to make you smile.  The musical accompaniment, while not Jazz of that period, is nice orchestral music well suited to each film.",4,Delightfully entertaining,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,1696,"['double-feature', 'DVD', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'popular', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'stars', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'overall', 'light', ""'feel-good"", 'themes', 'being', 'light', 'entertainment', 'variety', 'films', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'message', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'other', 'aspects', 'films', 'are', 'high', 'quality', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'little', 'disappointments', 'however', 'stunning', 'unmissable', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'Show', 'Off', 'picture', 'quality', 'Plastic', 'Age', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'pristine', 'quality', 'first', 'film', 'things', 'aside', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Show', 'Off', 'Ford', 'Sterling', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'big-mouthed', 'braggart', 'who', 'everyone', 'nerves', 'Amy', 'who', 'wonderful', 'up', 'marrying', 'family', 'disapproval', 'not', 'laughs', 'Amy', 'family', 'bad', 'times', 'Show', 'Off', 'chance', 'use', 'big-talk', 'talent', 'good', 'purpose', 'change', 'Very', 'nicely', 'expertly', 'directed', 'Malcolm', 'St', 'Clair', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'top', 'director', 'late', '1920s', 'Plastic', 'Age', 'story', 'just', 'perfect', 'IT', 'girl', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'who', 'show', 'charming', 'playfulness', 'role', 'popular', 'girl', 'who', 'college', 'boys', 'One', 'naive', 'serious', 'college', 'student', 'consequently', 'bad', 'habits', 'late', 'night', 'parties', 'badly', 'affect', 'college', 'performance', 'one', 'also', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'films', 'are', 'sure', 'make', 'smile', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'not', 'Jazz', 'period', 'nice', 'orchestral', 'music', 'well', 'suited', 'film']",N/A

664823,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00005M1ZO,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","THE PLASTIC AGE (1925)People who watch silent movies, especially of this era, are mostly film students, historians, aficionados or just want to see something different.  I guess I fall into the latter 2 categories.  This film was the last of 12 that Clara Bow made in 1925 and is generally considered the launching pad to stardom which came with 1927's ""It.""  She plays a college coed at a private celebrated college in California.  Pomona College was used for the film.  She becomes the object of desire for an incoming freshman named Hugh Carver (Donald Keith).Hugh was a champion track and football star in high school...uh prep school.  He was a good student and great things are expected of him by his parents (Mary Alden and Henry B. Walthall).  When he gets to college he ends up rooming with Carl Peters (Gilbert Roland in his first of many films).  Unlike many of today's films, these actors were actually of college age.  Roland and Bow were 20, Peters, 22.  Peters is the campus man-about-town and pins a picture on his wall of every girl he's kissed twice.  Cynthia Day (Bow) is his trophy.Hugh and another freshman are coerced/hazed by a group of sophomores to dress like girls and climb into a girl's dorm or sorority.  They do and before you know it, the booze, the cigarettes and the dancing break out.  Hugh and Cynthia hit it off and become a fun loving couple on campus.  At Hugh's first track meet, he comes in last.  As an aside, unless seasons were different then, track is a spring activity, but here it comes before football.Shamed by his parents by his diminished athletic skills and poor grades, Hugh's father refuses to let him come home or speak to him until things change.  Cynthia, playgirl that she is, realizes that Hugh means too much to her to fail and breaks off their relationship.  Hugh, sadden gets back to work and scores the winning touchdown.  Yea Hugh!!  That's pretty much it.""The Plastic Age,"" adapted from a very popular Percy Marks novel, is essentially a morality play.  It also features some future film stars as uncredited extras (students).  Watch for Janet Gaynor, Carole Lombard and her future husband Clark Gable in some don't blink or you'll miss them scenes.  Like many of these old films, the consistency of the film is well, inconsistent.  Pieces of film from various sources are obviously spliced in here and there.  You just have to live with it.  One legitimate complaint I do have is that there is an unusual lack of intertitles.  In particular, one early scene has Mr. Carver having the ""talk"" with his college bound son, at the insistence of Mrs. Carver.  This scene goes on for quite a while with not an intertitle card in sight.  Overall this is a fairly good movie for the time, but certainly not a classic.  But you can see the bright eyed Clara Bow and to a lesser extent, Gilbert Roland show some of the stuff that would make them stars.THE SHOW OFF (1926)While Louise Brooks is a secondary character in this silent film, she's the reason to watch.  Expecting a comedy as the movie is billed now and at the time, I didn't find much humor in the story.  Aubrey Piper (Ford Sterling) is a constantly bellowing, bragging blowhard who is a clerk in a room filled with clerks.  He tells everyone outside his job that he is an executive for the Pennsylvania Railroad.  His girlfriend, Amy Fisher (Lois Wilson) believes in all his bluster and accepts his marriage proposal.  Her parents (Charles Goodrich and Claire McDowell) don't care for the guy as he is constantly becoming too familiar with their home.  They see through his buffoonery.Amy's brother Joe (Gregory Kelly) is a bit more accepting of Aubrey, but mostly because of his sister.  Joe has eyes for his next door neighbor Clara (Brooks) and she is a favorite of the rest of the family as well being Amy's best friend.  Aubrey's idiotic behavior gets him in trouble with the law due to a traffic mishap.  I guess this is the funny part as he drives a car for the first time.  He's convicted and must spend 6 months in jail or pay a $1000 fine, which the judge upped from $500 when Aubrey tried bluffing him.Pop Fisher had decided earlier to give son Joe a $1000 to help him sell his new invention (rustproof paint).  The money had originally been set aside to pay off the past due mortgage.  Joe decides to pay Aubrey's fine instead, at the risk of losing the family home.  (Note:  Everyone in the film seems to have a problem with financial priorities.)  Subsequently Aubrey demurs from his usual bellicose ways and decides to help Joe with his product.  When push comes to shove, Aubrey can be very persuasive and in the end, gets a commitment from a large company along with a large check.  In short, he saves the day.Brooks has limited screen time but makes the most of it.  In one key scene, she gets into it with Aubrey and tells him off.  A woman being this aggressive was a bit off-putting at the time but got her noticed by critics and other filmmakers.  The film is transferred to DVD by Image Entertainment and looks very good.  Most scenes are clear and crisp.  A few do show some film sprocket bleed through and others are a bit faded.  Still very watchable.  The audio track is new music recreated to replicate the sound of the era.  It comes in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono and is also excellent.",3,3 1/2 stars for the films that launched Louise Brooks and Clara Bow to stardom,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,5329,"['PLASTIC', 'AGE',

664824,A2H9LUUCYE0KJC,B00005M1ZO,Mr Peter G George,"[49, 49]","Both of the films on this DVD are enjoyable and worth seeing, but neither can be classed as being among the great films of the silent era. These films are no doubt typical of the sorts of films people saw on a day-to-day basis. The silent films which are most seen today are the classics so it is interesting, for a change, to see some more routine programmers.The Show Off is the story of a truly obnoxious man played by Ford Sterling who is pompous and foolish. For some reason, which is not at all clear, Lois Wilson decides to marry him. This leads to all sorts of comic misadventures and disasters, including a very funny car journey with the incompetent Sterling causing chaos on the streets of Philadelphia. Louise Brooks is not the star of this film, but she has enough screen time to satisfy her fans. She is easily the best actor in the cast and, of course, looks stunning with her familiar bobbed hair. The print of The Show Off is very good. It is black and white and really clear enabling all the details of the film to be seen. The print shows hardly any damage, but there are some brief scenes where the sprocket holes become visible. The music by Timothy Brock is entertaining and fits in well with the mood and the period of the film.The Plastic Age is a college film. It concerns the attempts made by Donald Keith to juggle his studies and ambition to become a track and football star, with his romancing a `fast' jazz age girl, who else but Clara Bow. Keith plays a somewhat insipid character especially when compared to Bow who is so vivacious. It's hard to see what she sees in him when all he seems to say is `Gee.' Bow was a marvellous star, but this film was made before she really hit the big time. Thus although she has a decent amount of screen time, this remains a film about Keith, which is a pity as she is far more interesting than he is. One of the great pleasures of the film is the chance to see Henry B. Walthall (the little Colonel in Birth of a Nation). He plays Keith's father, and is wonderful as a stern but loving father concerned that his son devotes his time to study and sport rather than girls. The print of The Plastic Age is unfortunately not nearly as good as that of The Show Off. It is tinted mainly in sepia but using blue for night scenes. It is an acceptable print but lacks the clarity and detail of the print used for The Show Off. The Plastic Age is accompanied by a good score performed by Eric Beheim. This is a good value DVD with two entertaining silent films showcasing some of the early work of two of the great silent stars, Louise Brooks and Clara Bow. Fans of these two actresses should not be disappointed.",4,Brooks and Bow,998438400,"08 22, 2001",2001,2672,"['films', 'DVD', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'worth', 'seeing', 'can', 'be', 'classed', 'being', 'great', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'films', 'are', 'doubt', 'typical', 'sorts', 'films', 'people', 'saw', 'day-to-day', 'basis', 'silent', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'seen', 'today', 'are', 'classics', 'interesting', 'change', 'see', 'more', 'routine', 'programmers.The', 'Show', 'Off', 'story', 'truly', 'obnoxious', 'man', 'played', 'Ford', 'Sterling', 'who', 'pompous', 'foolish', 'reason', 'not', 'clear', 'Lois', 'Wilson', 'marry', 'sorts', 'comic', 'misadventures', 'disasters', 'including', 'very', 'funny', 'car', 'journey', 'incompetent', 'Sterling', 'causing', 'chaos', 'streets', 'Philadelphia', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'not', 'star', 'film', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'easily', 'best', 'actor', 'cast', 'course', 'stunning', 'familiar', 'bobbed', 'hair', 'print', 'Show', 'Off', 'very', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'really', 'clear', 'enabling', 'details', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'print', 'shows', 'hardly', 'damage', 'are', 'brief', 'scenes', 'where', 'sprocket', 'become', 'visible', 'music', 'Timothy', 'Brock', 'entertaining', 'fits', 'well', 'mood', 'period', 'film.The', 'Plastic', 'Age', 'college', 'film', 'attempts', 'made', 'Donald', 'Keith', 'juggle', 'studies', 'ambition', 'become', 'track', 'football', 'star', 'romancing', 'fast', 'jazz', 'age', 'girl', 'who', 'else', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'Keith', 'somewhat', 'insipid', 'character', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'Bow', 'who', 'so', 'vivacious', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'say', 'Gee', 'Bow', 'was', 'marvellous', 'star', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'really', 'hit', 'big', 'time', 'decent', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'film', 'Keith', 'pity', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'One', 'great', 'pleasures', 'film', 'chance', 'see', 'Henry', 'B.', 'Walthall', 'little', 'Colonel', 'Birth', 'Nation', 'Keith', 'father', 'wonderful', 'stern', 'loving', 'father', 'concerned', 'son', 'time', 'study', 'sport', 'rather', 'girls', 'print', 'Plastic', 'Age', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Show', 'Off', 'tinted', 'mainly', 'sepia', 'using', 'blue', 'night', 'scenes', 'acceptable', 'print', 'clarity', 'detail', 'print', 'used', 'Show', 'Off', 'Plastic', 'Age', 'accompanied', 'good', 'score', 'performed', 'Eric', 'Beheim', 'good', 'value', 'DVD', 'two', 'entertaining', 'silent', 'films', 'showcasing', 'early', 'work', 'two', 'great', 'silent', 'stars', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'Fans', 'two', 'actresses', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
