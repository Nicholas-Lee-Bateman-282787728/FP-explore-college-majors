The movie's about a young girl who is moving to a new house in a new city away from everything she's ever known. Not until her parents take an unexpected turn which was 'supposedly' supposed to lead them to their new home. Wrong. It actually leads them to an 'abandoned' train station next to an old theme park. The girl wants to go back, but he parents find an empty restaurant filled with delicious food, and insist to stay. While her parents eat, she explores Ther are empty buildings all around her, and she comes across a bath house. A boy sees her and tells her to take her parents and leave befor the sun sets. She does so, but not in time. She returns to the restaurant and finds that her parents turned into PIGS! They get taken away, and she runs back to the train station. Only she reaches a river that was not there when they first arrived. So she had to stay in this magical world she got shoved into, and takes a job at the bath house, where she tries to fet her parents back into humans. Not so easy.This movie is really great and really captures its viewers. It has a slight resemblance to 'Alice in Wonderland', and the ending is awesome. I really love the characters, especially the baby when it gets turned into a mouse. The movie has wonderful animation and music. Everyone should love this movie.

598412,A1OT7DSRMJ8PSK,B00005JLET,ACD,"[0, 0]","It's difficult to write a review of a film that both confounds and enlightens. Hayao Miyazaki once again literally &#34;spirits&#34; us away in this fanciful tale. In stark contrast to most modern animated family flicks, our heroine is not a cheerful cookie cutter girl, but rather a somewhat sullen soul much unfit to be the lead character. But what we find is that Miyazaki finds true beauty in the details rather than the action. It is the little moving parts throughout the plot and animation of the movie that make it simply wonderful. In so many ways the story itself is too absurd to make sense, and yet it rests in your mind like it is perfectly meant to be. His diligence to every detail of the animation is so painstakingly absurd that it becomes it's own thing of beauty. Much like the heroine, Sen's, journey; she wins us over through her determination. Miyazaki proves that a movie can be so much more than a good plot, great action, or a good cast. The movie does contain all three, but in so many ways he strips away the focus of what we normally go to the movies to see and submits to us an opportunity to allow our own imagination get caught up in the small details the form together a beautiful scene that could have never created without the collected creativity of individual viewer.

598413,A3PCC8VFK0ML7L,B00005JLET,achtung,"[2, 2]","""Spirited Away"" is nothing short of a modern classic in a time when new true classics are hard to come by. It's very inspiring and ambitious, while being beautiful and touching at the same time. The movie centers around a little girl who has been forced to work in a bathhouse that serves spirits in order to save her parents from their awful fate that has been brought upon them. However, she makes plenty of new friends along the way, and these supporting characters are just as intriguing as the main character herself. Add upon this the beautiful score and theme song and you have a movie destined to last. The story takes many twists and turns, but it shouldn't be too hard to follow for most people.As for the special features on the DVD, they really give a fantastic insight into how much labor it required to produce this movie. The ""Making Of"" documentary is very satisfying and leaves very few aspects about the making of the movie untouched. The ""Behind the Microphone"" extra introduces you to the voice actors that took part in the English-translated version of the film, and ""The Art of Spirited Away"" displays the effort that was put forth in producing this movie for an American audience. There's also a feature where you can take a peak at the storyboards for the first scene of the film while the audio track plays underneath. The only feature that's not particularly worthwhile are the Japanese trailers. Admittingly, some of these are very very good. However, some are just too similar to each other and it becomes very tedious to watch these for 30 minutes straight. In any case, the special features are very informative and accomplish their task in giving insight to the making of the film.This movie is not just for kids, but I'd recommend this to families who might be looking for a new movie that they could watch together.",5,A DVD worthy of the movie.,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,1848,"['Spirited', 'Away', 'nothing', 'short', 'modern', 'classic', 'time', 'when', 'new', 'true', 'classics', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'very', 'inspiring', 'ambitious', 'being', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'same', 'time', 'movie', 'centers', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'forced', 'work', 'bathhouse', 'spirits', 'order', 'save', 'parents', 'awful', 'fate', 'been', 'brought', 'However', 'plenty', 'new', 'friends', 'way', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'intriguing', 'main', 'character', 'Add', 'beautiful', 'score', 'theme', 'song', 'have', 'movie', 'destined', 'last', 'story', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'follow', 'most', 'people.As', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'really', 'give', 'fantastic', 'insight', 'how', 'much', 'labor', 'required', 'produce', 'movie', 'Making', 'documentary', 'very', 'satisfying', 'very', 'few', 'aspects', 'making', 'movie', 'untouched', 'Microphone', 'extra', 'introduces', 'voice', 'actors', 'took', 'part', 'English-translated', 'version', 'film', 'Art', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'forth', 'producing', 'movie', 'American', 'audience', 'also', 'feature', 'where', 'can', 'take', 'peak', 'storyboards', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'audio', 'track', 'underneath', 'only', 'feature', 'not', 'particularly', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'Admittingly', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'similar', 'other', 'very', 'tedious', 'watch', '30', 'minutes', 'straight', 'case', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'informative', 'accomplish', 'task', 'giving', 'insight', 'making', 'film.This', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'kids', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'families', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'looking', 'new', 'movie', 'could', 'watch', 'together']",N/A

598416,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B00005JLET,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[1, 1]","I love the movie SPIRITED AWAY by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's a breath taking anime film about a young girl, Chihiro, who is literally ""spirited away"" to a nether world full of magical beings and fantastic possibilities. She must stay and work at a bathhouse for spirits because a witch has turned her parents into pigs. With courage, hope, love, and the help of a boy named Haku, Chihiro must find a way to outsmart the witch and rescue herself and her parents from this realm and return to the human world.Just like another reviewer pointed out, beneath the surface this film is also about not judging people at face value because there's good and bad in all of the characters, and in us. Chihiro seems to understand that and therefore has compassion for even the most frightening and evil spirits/characters that pop up in the movie and helps them. And even though she might be afraid of them, she doesn't judge them. Perhaps that's the real message of the film and why people find it so endearing...The English dub is fantastic and Daveigh Chase as ""Chihiro,"" Jason Marsden as ""Haku,"" and the fabulous Suzanne Pleshette as evil witch ""Yubaba"" are terrific in their respective roles. But for those purists out there the original Japanese language track in 5.1 surround sound is available.=========== DVD 1 ===========** Spirited Away Movie ** (02:04:28-Minutes)= Intro by John Lasseter (Pixar)/Widescreen with English or Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and French (not in 5.1).

Liu,"[89, 97]","While Major Hollywood studios believe the audiences are tired of watching plain hand-drawn cartoons and began to incorporate more special effects into 2-D animation, yet with disappointing results (Titan A.E., Atlantis, and the most recent Treasure Planet), they have almost totally given up on traditional animation, and focus on producing 3-D computer animation. After a series of successful and charming CG cartoon, one could not help but to wonder: is this the end of hand-drawn cartoon artists? (some may argue that they could get the job as storyboard artists)The point that they are really missing is, what is missing from the recent 2-D animation features, is not the blasting visual effects, or floor cracking sounds. The real thing that is missing from them is a ""heart"".See ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", and ""Monsters, Inc."" (all produced by Pixar Studio, who is, in the writer's opinion, superior than their rival competitors), while they are indeed visually revolutionary, the focus is still on story telling - story that combines humor, excitement, and ultimately family-oriented heart-warming theme.""Spirited Away"" is simply magical, enchanting, funny, and genuinely touching. In the beginning of the film some may be distracted by the in comparison lower frame-rate (i.e. the character movements may not seem as smooth compare to the Hollywood animations), but you will not be able to help but to awe at each beautifully rendered frame. The artistic level and the use of colors in the drawing are all first class. Moreover, 30 minutes into the film, you will probably forget it is drawings that you are watching, because everything inside the screen all comes alive! (Perhaps because it reaches a certain realistic level, some of the scene may be too grizzly and scary)It did not become the highest grossing movie in Japan ever for no reason, and it certainly deserves more attention it received in the western world. The ballroom scene in ""Beauty and the Beast"" never fails to bring tears in my eyes, and it reminds us why we watch cartoon in the beginning.

It will have you lying awake in dreamless nights, thinking...thinking about everything...pollution...relationships...your family...Spirited Away grabs you right from the beginning: You see Chihiro, an annoying ten-year-old girl whining about having to leave her old house behind and transfer to a new school. Her parents, however, feel the exact opposite. In fact, the thought of starting a new life excites an adventuresome spirit in them. Chihiro's dad, therefore, decides to take an old, dusty road, hoping it will eventually lead to their new house.From this point on, it gets truly amazing. The moment the lights go down on the old abandoned amusement park, Miyazaki's art and storytelling advance to a whole new level. One instant that really stands out in my mind is when Chihiro discovers her parents have transformed into pigs. The look, the expression, the lighting, the mood, the scenery sincerely brought an extreme emotion to the viewer-- I felt as disgusted and afraid as Chihiro did.As the narrative continues, I was entirely absorbed in the wonderful cast; I can't choose a favorite!

But even now being 28 years old, I am impressed.... So, what's special in this movie? Why everybody likes it?1) Well, first of all, there is a very unusual story. It's just not what you expect from fairytales or what you are accustomed to expect from fairytales. The story is intriguing and is absolutely unpredictable. Each next scene will make your eyes and mouth remain wide. That's why you'll be glued to the screen the whole 2-hour time while the movie goes. So, I am not going to tell you what's the story is about, as I want you to be excited in the same way I was when I watched it for the first time...2) Humour. There are plenty of moments there, which will make you laugh. The humour is very intelligent and that's why it's very pleasant and enjoyable. In the course of the movie you'll see various characters. Most of them will make you smile without saying a word!3) Main characters. I don't know whether you've seen already ""Tokyo Godfathers"". If yes, then you know how quality drawn characters can be. The 10-year old Chihiro is so real here. Well, actually, my favourite character there is not Chihiro, but wonderful granny Yubaba!!! Oh, she is so cool and witty! Quite a special character I must say, but so lovely! She is so smart and funny that I wish she could be my grand mother!!!4) Music. You know, with such an original score, you don't really need to watch anything. Just listen to this masterpiece of the famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi!!!! Splendid! You will not hear a single electronic sound, but what you'll hear are beautiful orchestral, piano and violin themes. This movie got rich and quality soundtrack.5) English dubbing. I compared both English and Japanese dialogues, and I must admit that the version with English dubbing is far better than the version in original language. I noticed that characters' emotions and intonations do properly sound  situation-wise in the English version of the movie. For example the loving caring voice of ""English"" Yubaba when she talks to her baby is much more convincing than the one of ""Japanese"" Yubaba...Conclusion: this movie is a masterpiece.

Princess Mononoke is one of my favorite movies of all time--an absolute jaw-dropping achievement. Now, we come to Spirited Away.This is without question the best anime movie I have ever seen. It made me laugh (the soot balls are adorable! I want one! I want all of them!); it made me cry; it made me giddy (whenever Sen and her friends triumphed over Yubaba); it surprised me (can't say anything without giving stuff away); and it just moved me like no other anime has ever done.Sen is a real, believable character who acts like a ten-year-old WOULD act if put into this situation. She is lost, confused, sad, angry, sarcastic, beligerent, kind, innocent, and friendly, all at the same time. She doesn't flinch in front of Yubaba, but gives in to her emotions after seeing her parents in the pigpen. She deals with the Stink Spirit without having to be prodded, and faces the angry No Face knowing that he could attack. She is not particularly beautiful physically, but by the end of the movie she is beautiful in other ways, including that way. She is not brave or daring--she tries to stop her parents from exploring, and she doesn't partake of the food herself (which is a good thing).Lin is one of my favorite characters. Like Toki from Princess Mononoke, Lin has an attitude and a sharp tongue and is not afraid to use it. She is sarcastic, insulting, and borderline cruel to most, but to Chihiro/Sen she is almost like a big sister. I love what she tells No Face! (Those of you who have seen the movie should know what I am talking about.)Haku is too wonderful for words. And his other form is SO awesome!

598432,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B00005JLET,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[4, 4]","Firstly, Spirited Away won an American Oscar for best animated film, not to mention other awards earned around the world. Secondly, there are few places where you can find a professional review that actually says something bad about this movie, and if you do it's because that reviewer obviously doesn't understand anime as its fans do. Spirited Away is one of the top films ever, in my book. It blends everything that makes a story great, including lovable characters, a magical world, and a story that will melt you from the inside it's so warm. Plus, it appeals to both adults and children.The story centers around a little girl named Chihiro who's in the middle of a move to another part of Japan, and she obviously isn't happy about it. But during the drive to her new home, her parents take a pit stop and they end up in a deserted city. Only this city isn't as deserted as they think, and they are suddenly drawn deeper into the city by the delights it offers. Chihiro, ever the pessimist, doesn't partake in all the delights her parents do, thus saving her from the curse placed upon them, but that also leaves her alone in this new world of magical monsters and spirits. All she can do to save herself, and hopefully her parents, is work for the master of a bathhouse. During her time in this world she meets a strange boy--who is also a dragon--that seems somehow familiar to her. It's her meeting with the dragon that ends up changing the place she made for herself in this world, and so starts her adventure to save the ones most dear to her.As is the wont of Miyazaki, he places a young girl at the head of the story, and kind of lets her tell it, only in this case Chihiro is by far the weakest of his female leads. It's fun to watch her grow and change into something she wasn't before. This story is filled with symbolism and themes, which means it must be paid attention to, as there is something to be learned in this film. That makes it ideal to both children and adults alike.Disney did an excellent job with the DVD as well, and the obvious love put into this film becomes apparent after watching the documentaries on the disc. The voice actors and those responsible for getting the rights to the film put everything they had into it, and it shows.This is an anime for everyone, and I'd recommend it just that way.

(How refreshing, after too nihilistic and erotic &quot;Intimacy&quot;!)With a little discernment, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is suitable for children (although not too young, maybe from 8 years up) and for adults, too -- if they have not their sense of fantasy 'amputated' from their minds. Yes, it's that good!At the beginning, a little bit spoiled girl named Chihiro is moving with her parents to a new place, a new home. She does not seem too enthusiastic about that. But then the three stop their car and looking around, they find a deserted amusement park(?). From then on, a special string of events starts to unfold, and Chihiro -- now named Sen -- is first resented as a representative of human race, but later wins hearts of almost all inhabitants of the weirdly compelling world of various creatures, apparently based on Japanese mythology. In a way, the girl leaves her childhood behind her and becomes a young woman.Combining the improbable with the inevitable, the ancient and the modern, the films contains many societal references and especially in its second half becomes a 'spirited', at times utterly fascinating journey into fantasy (in my native Slovakia it ran under the title &quot;The Way to Fantasy&quot;).I can recommend this film to real movie connoisseurs. Although I liked &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; recently, I liked this one more! Indeed, few films in my adult life have appealed to the &quot;child&quot; in me more than &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.",4,&quot;Spirited Away&quot; Elevates SPIRIT and Takes You AWAY,1074556800,"01 20, 2004",2004,1656,"['highly', 'original', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'swept', 'almost', 'award', 'was', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'including', 'Oscar', 'even', 'Berlin', 'Film', 'Festival', 'How', 'refreshing', 'too', 'nihilistic', 'erotic', 'quot', 'Intimacy', 'quot', 'little', 'discernment', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quot', 'suitable', 'children', 'not', 'too', 'young', 'maybe', '8', 'years', 'up', 'adults', 'too', 'have', 'not', 'sense', 'fantasy', ""'amputated"", 'minds', 'Yes', 'good', 'beginning', 'little', 'bit', 'spoiled', 'girl', 'named', 'Chihiro', 'moving', 'parents', 'new', 'place', 'new', 'home', 'not', 'seem', 'too', 'enthusiastic', 'then', 'three', 'stop', 'car', 'looking', 'around', 'find', 'deserted', 'amusement', 'park', 'then', 'special', 'string', 'events', 'starts', 'unfold', 'Chihiro', 'now', 'named', 'Sen', 'first', 'resented', 'representative', 'human', 'race', 'later', 'hearts', 'almost', 'inhabitants', 'weirdly', 'compelling', 'world', 'various', 'creatures', 'apparently', 'based', 'Japanese', 'mythology', 'way', 'girl', 'childhood', 'young', 'woman.Combining', 'improbable', 'inevitable', 'ancient', 'modern', 'films', 'many', 'societal', 'references', 'especially', 'second', 'half', ""'spirited"", 'times', 'utterly', 'fascinating', 'journey', 'fantasy', 'native', 'Slovakia', 'ran', 'title', 'quot', 'Way', 'Fantasy', 'quot', '.I', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'real', 'movie', 'connoisseurs', 'liked', 'quot', 'Shrek', 'quot', 'quot', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'quot', 'recently', 'liked', 'one', 'more', 'Indeed', 'few', 'films', 'adult', 'life', 'have', 'appealed', 'quot', 'child', 'quot', 'more', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quot']",N/A

598437,A1W3DQK1KPGZ92,B00005JLET,"""articwolf87""","[0, 2]","I will start with why I gave the movie 4 stars. It ended abruptly, I mean, I understood the whole part of her learning respect, and manners, and how to live life. I understood all the moral values of everything. But... The fact that everyone got to love her and was happy to see her go. That wierded me out, I mean, aren't they all evil and such. Don't they hate humans. That could have been explained better. I suppose. But, theres not more I can say than that.This movie was excellent...This movie for starters was rather graphic. There was blood, and references to death and a single cigarette but sorry conservative parents that doesn't mean its PG-13. It's PG. There is a difference between PG and G and I hope now all of you realize that you cannot take a 5-year-old to a PG movie. That lesson having been learned, the parents no longer need to put down the movie for showing blood. PG movies tend to have some references to death and in this day and age also have violence and blood.Next on my negative attacks is the fact that this movie wasn't up to Oscar status. Look, the artwork was excellent, the story was beautiful, the plot was great, the scenery and worlds were mystical and entertaining, the characters were unique and fun. Just because your son/daughter did not sit through it doesn't mean it isn't Oscar worthy. Notice the Oscar was for best Animation and not best Child's Movie. Thank you.The Artwork was so good on this movie. I would glance at my friend next to me and we could only laugh with glee at how beautiful it all was, or the similarities between this and the directors other famous filmed Princess Mononoke. I'm slightly disappointed that they felt the need to ad CG (computer generations) to the film. They disappointed me only because it shows they got lazy, they easily could have pulled those scenes off with mere animated art.This movie was not just a kid's movie, but if you aren't a fan of Anime and want to check it out because it's an Oscar winner, than don't get your hopes up. Anime is like Coffee to a kid, you just gotta get used to it before you love it. An acquired taste. It's really an excellent film, the dub wasn't horrible, I'm sure there were some edits, but it was chopped, it was beautiful the way I saw it in theatres. It was excellent and it is a must see for most Anime fans and Children over 8 sounds like a healthy age.Well, having purchased the movie today.  The day it has come out, I noticed something under ""The Art of Spirited Away"" featurette, that some people may find interesting.  Sadly this is what happens when the world thinks it knows everything about movies.  Sadly, some people don't quite understand the things that go on in the backround and just because it says Disney on it means its gonna [stink.]  I mean honestly, look at all the over protective and unimaginative parents that hate it!  That is one of the most appealing things to it that most defintely shows that it isn't Disney.  The featurette I watched explained the situation of Studio Ghibli (Miyazaki's laboratory for animation) on the distribution of their works in America.  Miyazaki refused to sell his work to anyone unless it came, and I quote ""fully uncut in it's entirety"".  No, this is not diet-Miyazaki.  This film was not Disney-fide.  What you saw was the true version of the film translated into English.  If that puts you in too much of a hard situation to listen to your own native language, I'm sorry, just go jump off a cliff.  I too enjoy the original language tracks, but trust me, nothing was changed.  And, guess what that means.

598438,A3ATTCCO32ZXET,B00005JLET,"A. Ryan ""Merribelle""","[5, 6]","I never counted myself among the fans of anime, and I still don't: but Spirited Away may have me looking into more quality anime titles as I try to locate outstanding films by Japan's reigning master director/animator, Miyazaki.The plot rehash:  a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, and her parents stumble upon a portal between our world and the realm of spirits (which strongly resembles a Japanese town of about 100 years ago).  The parents make the mistake of eating the food there and then pay the price by turning into pigs immediately.  Chihiro has to navigate her way through this weird alternate universe and put herself into the employ of a powerful sorceress in order to find a way of getting herself and her parents back to their home.  Along the way she learns to be stronger and discovers new resources within herself.Simply put, I believe this is the best animated film ever made.  Spirited Away not only has incredible visual detail and realism (with hardly any help from CGI), but takes the familiar plot of a fairytale-like story and transforms it into a journey enjoyable by kids and adults alike.  In fact, everything was so superbly and magically rendered that I was able to forget myself under its spell - as if I were re-entering childhood.  Yet on a note of caution to parents, there are some scenes that young children might find scary, involving spirits, monsters eating people and all sorts of strange beings.  Miyazaki never forgets his cultural roots in Animism even while creating a masterpiece that resonates with such universal power. This is no Disney film indeed (although Disney may have led many American consumers to believe that, Pixar was only responsible for the English dubbing and distribution within the U.S.A).I will end up owning this dvd for my private collection to enjoy time and again with my (elementary school-age or older) children.

Yes, it's still playing in some theatres. We saw the film when it first came out, and it was her first introduction to the worlds of Hayao Miyazaki. She had no idea what I was taking her to see at the time, she just had to trust me. In fact, I had no idea either; all I knew was that I saw there was a new Miyazaki film and it was playing in theatres. Of course she liked it. Is it possible to not like this film? But anyway, as we were going to see it again, I kept thinking to myself how you can never fully appreciate a Miyazaki film until you've seen it at least twice. Spirited Away was the only film of his I've seen once.I own this film on DVD, but I've only seen the special features because we just went to see it on the big screen. Funny thing is, it cost more for us to go to the theatre the other night than it did to buy the DVD. How many films would you do that for? It's that good!I'll spare you a synopsis as they are over abundant. Instead, let me just tell you this film is a bit bizaar. People compare this film to Alice in Wonderland because it has that same bizaar quality to the setting that could only seem to make sense in a dream. If you are unprepared, it can make the film harder to digest, but I assure you it doesn't take away from the story at all.The first time I saw this film, I thought it was good, but not the best of Miyazaki's films. Seeing it again, makes me doubt that assessment. Miyazaki's films are so full of details and nuances that you easily miss many of them the first time around especially as you are distracted by his wild imagination on screen. I wish I could put into words how magnificent this film is. You simply must see it, and see it again!Keep in mind the film's PG rating. It may not be suitable for young children. Disney may be the one distributing the film, but it is not a Disney film. In other words, don't just shop for this film for your kids.

For comparison I have viewed a probably gray-market DVD of the original Japanese version with English subtitles.Every time I watch the original, it transports me to a refreshingly different, non-Western, faraway mind-state; quite unexpected at first, but eerily enjoyable. The artwork is lush and layered with detail that emerges only with repeated viewings.BUT... After a second viewing of the US theatrical release, I found myself increasingly disliking Disney's treatment. Chihiro's blossoming strength and courage (the whole point of the movie!) becomes inexplicable, for Disney has her now constantly mooning over Haku, and being mother-henned by Lin.Entire plot elements and dialog are unnecessarily messed with, and cheap shots, insults and inappropriate humor are added. Disney is determined that Chihiro/Sen stay a dependent kid in the Bathhouse, rather than become a peer to her coworkers, and who can hold her own in a strange world.As for Disney's releasing it as ""Miyazaki's Spirited Away"", are Uncle Walt's kids humbly proclaiming the opportunity to present a work by animation's true Grand Master, or are they hastily disclaiming responsibility for such an alien, un-Disney oddity? Perhaps with Studio Ghibli breaking away (as of 2005) from Tokuma Shoten, future foreign releases of Miyazaki's works will get gentler, more respectful treatment.[comment Nov. 2012: I gather that John Lassiter, head honcho at Pixar, championed the whole Miyazaki initiative--possibly over objections & complaints from Disney management. Lassiter personally introduces each of the early Disney-Ghibli releases, showing his love for Miyazaki's art as well as his towering ego. But all media players have a Fast Forward feature, thank goodness.]I'd encourage viewers to stick to the Japanese track on this DVD, with directly translated subtitles, and compare for themselves.

598442,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B00005JLET,Barry C. Chow,"[7, 7]","What a glorious, glorious labour of love. After watching it, I felt like hugging myself. Calling this film an 'animation' and thus lumping it together with the childish fantasies turned out by lesser talents doesn't do it justice, for this work of art deserves comparison to the best in any genre.This is a film that has complex imperfect heroes, no villains, trials more internal than external, a world more vibrant than our own, a spirituality so deep as to reach the metaphysical, and yet will delight a girl of ten as much as a lifelong moviegoer of ninety. It is also surreal in tone, lyrical in composition, invokes tension and suspense without malevolence, and the filmmaker achieves all of this in an animated cartoon. `Spirited Away' is a work of sheer genius.This film has pity and compassion, love and redemption, hidden strength and discovered courage, turbulence harnessed to an inner harmony; but it never strikes a false note nor succumbs to maudlin sentiment. Through gentle humour and understated dignity, it shows so much respect for the intelligence of its audience that I wanted to kiss the director's hand.Calling this film a fairy tale just won't do. Unlike western animation, its magic is deep down, at the very roots of its make-believe world, so deep that it is worked into the very fabric of the story. There is no faerie flying around sprinkling pixie dust, no bubbling cauldrons, no evil-incarnate stepmother and no goodness-personified prince charming; nothing so obvious or so crass. Instead, the world of spirits into which our little heroine lands is as natural as breathing. In this world, humans are the intruders, and as gross material entities, it is we who bring disorder and upset to their realm.It is not easy describing what makes this film so special, because the reasons range from the very small to the very large. At the small end, the film's eye for detail is simply marvellous. Even the act of a little girl putting on her shoes is given such character that we pause to admire the filmmakers' respect for children. At the large end, this film shares with us a journey of spiritual awakening. Our little heroine grows over the course of the film from a self-pitying self-absorbed little mouse into a loving openhearted daring soul.But a word of caution: this is not standard cartoon fare. It assumes an intelligent audience and therefore dispenses with a paint-by-numbers plotline. Indeed, it isn't even about plot but about character, places, feelings, moods, and most of all, themes. For example, a recurring theme is that of purging. Various characters throw up throughout the film and this may disturb the fainthearted. But, if one is familiar with oriental thought, expelling poison to cleanse oneself is a common cultural theme and does not provoke the same disgust that it does in occidental cultures. Indeed, after our little heroine replenishes the river spirit, his gift to her is the medicine of purging. Later in the story, she saves a number of her friends by putting it to good use.Obviously, this is a film that must be approached with some thought. Unlike most western animations, one cannot view it while idling in neutral. It has much that is beautiful and transcendent, but it also has terror and pain, and it demands our most careful consideration. Those unwilling to invest the required effort will get nothing out of it and had best stick with Bambi. Yet, for all its demands, this is a film that remains accessible even to children. Younger viewers may even have an advantage over their parents because they will approach it with open minds unconstrained by western styles and conventions. For them, the film's symbolism may not be apparent, but the filmmakers have applied such symbolism so gracefully that it will still be felt if not noticed, and this will be all that matters.This film rewards open minds. To fully appreciate it, one must cast away ones preconceptions about animation. Western practice and tradition has sadly fenced animation into a marginal niche by considering it children's fare that is incapable of higher artistic expression. 'Spirited Away' is Hayao Miyazaki's exuberant response. It deserves the same consideration and accolades that we habitually heap on 'real' films and is frankly so far above the excrement endlessly churned out by Hollywood that it inhabits a different plane. This film deserved the Oscar in 2001, not for 'Best Animated Film', but for 'Best Picture'.

598443,A1EI65WJC85U68,B00005JLET,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[1, 2]","Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase of LILO AND STITCH) is a young girl holidaying with her parents when they come across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. But upon arriving and discovering a smorgasboard lined up. The only problem is this banquet is for the spirits, and them only. Naturally, Mum and Dad indulge in the deadly sin of gluttony and for their greed are literally turned into pigs. (But who wouldn't when there's free food on offer?).So on the advice of her new friend Haku, Chirhiro must travel into the spirit world in order to have her parents restored to human form. On her quest she encounters many interesting and imaginative characters such as The Radish Spirit and a giant baby. Chrihiro also runs afoul of the evil witch Yubabba and her kind twin  sister Zeniba (both voiced by Suzanne Pleshette).While at two hours it seems a bit too long, Writer/Director Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY is an original and imaginative animated feature that puts Hollywood made fodder to shame. Both kids and adults will enjoy it, though parental guidance is recommended for younger children who may find it scary. And as with LILO AND STITCH, the P.C police will find ammo (Or more aptly, blanks) to give them an excuse to get up on their pedestals and rant to like-minded people about how &quot;evil&quot; movies like this are. Which is of course utter poppycock. But parents should have a look at it first before deciding to let young kids view it.

It was an antimated GHOSTBUSTERS or similar to the Scooby-Doo movie.Village Roadshow Pictures are releasing some really strange productions such as the primitive prequel to DREAMCATCHER. It seemed to be based on a Japenese video game as in early Nintendo. It contained weird animation, artificial acting (no emotion), and bad voice overs. Even the skinny woman with superhuman strength sounded like a man. Bette Ford made a good ""old"" woman.  There were some subtle references to various classics, thus the fairy tale aspect. The male 'lead' had a Little Lord Faulteroy haircut and looked like Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra. He had a feminine hand (long, slender fingers) like that of the father in the famous painting of THE PRODIGAL SON. He was put under a spell and transformed into a weird dragon.After the hungry phantom swallowed the frog (WIND IN THE WILLOWS) whole, later he was regurgitated and revived -- as in the story of Jonah in the Whale.Even the ""Pillsbury doughboy"" baby of the incredibly old madame looked like Medulsa with snakes in his long swirling hair. He is transformed for awhile into a strange-looking mouse which is carried around by a real-sounding mosquito. He looked like a Sumari wrestler.Everyone had such wide big eyes and no noses. At first, I thought it was going to be just another ""eel"" story, but it was just as much a Japanese version of Spiderman.There was a court jester tempted by the gold, a skull phone of the 'old woman' gnome, poor Sin knee-deep in mire at the bathhouse where Sludge was a smelly guest. The music kept the atmosphere of a geisha instead of a pig farm.There was an abundance of exotic plants and a spectacular hawthorne bush. Other colorful flora abounded in this little paradise by day/Hell after dark.The rain clouds were symbolic of foreboding things to come. Other clouds and the night sky were somewhat realistic-looking, except for the moon.I've never before seen such industrious sootballs. And when they played charades, it was a sight to behold.Their elevators are faster even than those in the Sears Tower in Chicago. One final test (where is Sin?) was a ride on the ghost train to the Swamp on which the conductor shredded the tickets, for whatever reason.As in any fantasy, it takes awhile for memories to return, and only love could break the spell.The public t.v. series SAGWA, misadventures of the Siamese cats, is much more enjoyable than this academy award-winning feature.",3,Award-winning spirits for today's child,1049068800,"03 31, 2003",2003,2579,"['fantasy', 'won', 'Academy', 'award', 'was', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'fare', 'similar', 'old', 'Racer', 'children', 'watched', 't.v', 'was', 'antimated', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'similar', 'Scooby-Doo', 'movie.Village', 'Roadshow', 'Pictures', 'are', 'releasing', 'really', 'strange', 'productions', 'such', 'primitive', 'prequel', 'DREAMCATCHER', 'seemed', 'be', 'based', 'Japenese', 'video', 'game', 'early', 'Nintendo', 'contained', 'weird', 'animation', 'artificial', 'acting', 'emotion', 'bad', 'voice', 'overs', 'Even', 'skinny', 'woman', 'superhuman', 'strength', 'sounded', 'man', 'Bette', 'Ford', 'made', 'good', 'old', 'woman', 'were', 'subtle', 'references', 'various', 'classics', 'thus', 'fairy', 'tale', 'aspect', 'male', 'had', 'Little', 'Lord', 'Faulteroy', 'haircut', 'looked', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Cleopatra', 'had', 'feminine', 'hand', 'long', 'slender', 'fingers', 'father', 'famous', 'painting', 'THE', 'PRODIGAL', 'SON', 'was', 'put', 'spell', 'transformed', 'weird', 'dragon.After', 'hungry', 'phantom', 'swallowed', 'frog', 'WIND', 'IN', 'THE', 'WILLOWS', 'whole', 'later', 'was', 'regurgitated', 'revived', 'story', 'Jonah', 'Whale.Even', 'Pillsbury', 'doughboy', 'baby', 'incredibly', 'old', 'madame', 'looked', 'Medulsa', 'snakes', 'long', 'swirling', 'hair', 'transformed', 'awhile', 'strange-looking', 'mouse', 'carried', 'real-sounding', 'mosquito', 'looked', 'Sumari', 'wrestler.Everyone', 'had', 'such', 'wide', 'big', 'eyes', 'noses', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'just', 'eel', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Japanese', 'version', 'Spiderman.There', 'was', 'court', 'jester', 'tempted', 'gold', 'skull', 'phone', ""'old"", 'woman', 'gnome', 'poor', 'Sin', 'knee-deep', 'mire', 'bathhouse', 'where', 'Sludge', 'was', 'smelly', 'guest', 'music', 'kept', 'atmosphere', 'geisha', 'instead', 'pig', 'farm.There', 'was', 'abundance', 'exotic', 'plants', 'spectacular', 'hawthorne', 'bush', 'Other', 'colorful', 'flora', 'abounded', 'little', 'paradise', 'day/Hell', 'dark.The', 'rain', 'clouds', 'were', 'symbolic', 'foreboding', 'things', 'come', 'Other', 'clouds', 'night', 'sky', 'were', 'somewhat', 'realistic-looking', 'moon.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'such', 'industrious', 'sootballs', 'when', 'played', 'charades', 'was', 'sight', 'behold.Their', 'elevators', 'are', 'faster', 'even', 'Sears', 'Tower', 'Chicago', 'One', 'final', 'test', 'where', 'Sin', 'was', 'ride', 'ghost', 'train', 'Swamp', 'conductor', 'shredded', 'tickets', 'reason.As', 'fantasy', 'awhile', 'memories', 'return', 'only', 'love', 'could', 'break', 'spell.The', 'public', 't.v', 'series', 'SAGWA', 'misadventures', 'Siamese', 'cats', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'academy', 'award-winning', 'feature']",N/A

Now add the statistics for SPIRITED AWAY: It is the most popular movie of all time in Japan (over $200 million before it ever came to the U.S.), the first animated film to win the Golden Bear award for Best Picture at the Berlin Film Festival, and the only Japanese animated film to win the Academy Award for Best Animated feature. Miyazaki has done one hell of an achievement. This film was the second movie in a row I declared Best Picture from Miyazaki. The previous film was PRINCESS MONONOKE in 1999. That one is a wonderful film that got me really interested in Japanese Anime.The story is clearly inspired by the classic, ALICE IN WONDERLAND. But it is only loosely inspired because every single frame you see is 100% Miyazaki. A moody young girl named Chihiro (Daveigh Chase) is moving with her parents (Michael Chicklis and Lauren Holly) to a new house. The father makes a wrong turn and they find themselves in front of a strange building with a dark tunnel. The father is curious what's on the other end and convinces Chihiro and the mother to walk through it. They emerge to a large field and what looks like to be an old amusement park. One thing leads to another and the parents undergo an unbelievable change. Chihiro finds herself trapped in this strange world. She meets an unusual boy named Haku (Jason Marsden), who tells her the only way she can rescue her parents is to obtain a job at a bathhouse, run by an evil witch named Yubaba (Suzanne Pleschette). The bathhouse is a place where spirits go for personal pleasure. Humans are definitely not welcomed here, but Yubaba reluctantly agrees to give her a job. Chihiro is warned that it will not be easy work, but she would not suffer the same fate as her parents.If it sounds like the witch is the villain in this story, and Chihiro is the hero, it is not that simple. Although it is true that the witch is evil and unkind, this isn't a tale of good against evil. Miyazaki had the best explanation: The bathhouse is part of the spirit world where good and evil exist side by side. Among the characters are Kamaji (David Ogden Stiers): a part human-like character, a black figure with a mask for a face, a blob of smelly goo who comes to the place for a bath, and a twin sister of Yubaba. I will not reveal who is good or bad; you have to see the movie for yourself. Chihiro discovers something that has always been inside her. She is the Arc of the story, as they always teach in writing class: the one who undergoes the most change. And unlike some other stories, it isn't handled in an obvious and contrived way. It is done with intelligence and a sense of subtlety. I ended up caring so much for this character. She is caught in a situation she did not deserve to get into.It didn't take long before I felt myself so emerged into this that it became that Out-of-the-Body-Experience that I so rarely have. I feel like I am in this movie along with the characters. It comes not from any big action scenes, but from emotion and images. No wonder. SPIRITED AWAY has just one amazing image after another. Long before I discovered Miyazaki I knew about Japanese Anime. But I found a lot of it to have a rather jerky flow of movement. There is one scene where Chihiro walks through a huge flower garden, and everything is so incredibly smooth moving. This is also true in an early scene when Chihiro looks outside a car window. Miyazaki has always done his animation by hand. (Every single frame has passed through his personal drawing board.) Here, he uses digital technology for the movement and it actually adds to the effect instead of drawing attention to itself.So many Hollywood movies these days, even the so-called ""family films"" have all this non-stop action and fast cutting. But in SPIRITED AWAY, just like in PRINCESS MONONOKE and almost every other Miyazaki movie, there are scenes where everything goes quiet. A frame will actually remain still, or not cut to another frame for several seconds, and you will hear no music or dialogue. You can actually just look, listen to the silence, and drink the imagery that he has delivered. You can look at and spot something amazing in the corner that you would never expect. And the amazing detail that Miyazaki so painstakingly put in each frame becomes so incredibly clear. It is a joy just to look in the corner and see what he might have hidden there.When we do actually hear music in the film, it adds to the emotional power to the scenes. It was done by Miyazaki's longtime film composer: Joe Hisashi. Note that Miyazaki flawlessly combines this score with a lengthy scene involving Chihiro on a train. He doesn't cut corners by just showing the beginning and the end of the train ride, as a lesser director might do. He takes his own time, using so very little dialogue. The scene becomes more subtle and grabs your attention.If you've read my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE on Amazon.com you will remember how I really praised the ending and how it handles a romance. The hero doesn't so much get the girl. He just doesn't get the girl YET. But I finished it with the belief that a real romance would actually come out in time. Miyazaki ends SPIRITED AWAY almost exactly like that.  And as a result, the movie does another wonderful thing that is sadly uncommon for me. It made me think about what might have happened to these characters after the movie was over. And to add another icing on the cake the movie contains a powerful Japanese song heard over the end credits.What an amazing, beautiful, and powerful film. I hope that this review encourages you to seek out this movie on DVD. I'm still hoping for a Blu-Ray release in the future. Miyazaki claims the movie was for 10 year olds. There are some scenes that might be a little too scary for children younger than that. (For those children, I would strongly suggest MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). But if you have ten year old children, and their attention spans haven't been corrupted by the so-called entertainment being shoved down their throats show them this movie. Disney released it in the theaters in 2002 and on DVD with a perfectly dubbed English soundtrack. Ten year old's may have been Miyazaki's target audience. However, it has grown way beyond that.I quoted Howard Hawks in my review of PRINCESS MONONOKE for his definition of a good movie: ""Three great scenes, no bad scenes."" For SPIRITED AWAY, I would multiply that formula by five.",5,The best movie of 2002,1050883200,"04 21, 2003",2003,7251,"['note', 'new', '2012', 'review', 'filmHayao', 'Miyazaki', 'SPIRITED', 'AWAY',

Another reviewer made me realize something that had been lurking in my subconscious for awhile after I saw this movie when my sister got it for her b-day...#1. Why are we not allowed to care about anyone but Chichiro? And why do we still no virtually nothing about her?I'm not the first to notice that unlike other Miyazaki films, I really didn't see the character depth usually present... All we know about the main character we sob and smile over for 2 hours is that her name is Chichiro, she has a mother and father, she moved to a new house, and she once almost lost her shoe in a river... That's not much... And we get even less about the other characters... Like I was really curious about Kamaji and Lin... Lin seemed unhappy at the bathhouse ""Someday I'm getting on that train..."" How did she come to be at Yubaba's in the first place? Same with Kamaji who saved train tickets for FORTY years just to give them to a little kid, a mouse, a bird, and a no-face... And where did Yubaba get a baby?! I can't help but wonder that several times a minute while watching this film... It's a beautiful movie but we wanted more about the characters... If they had cut out parts at the beginning that got a bit tedious, they might have been able to explain a few things... We're supposed to care about Chihiro, which most of us do by the end of the picture, but we really don't know much about her... Why did her parents decide to move them into such a remote location? What did she like to do before life at the bathhouse? Where had she lived in the first place and what had she been like there? They spend a bit too much time in the scene before Haku tells her to get a job from Yubaba... I brought this over to the kids I was baby-sitting's house and they practically slept through that entire first part... It was artistic but not very entertaining... My dad kept asking, ""Have we gotten to the good part?"" In ""Mononoke"" they go into great detail about where the characters came from and why and their backgrounds... I didn't see that here...#2: The ending was somewhat unsatisfying... One minute, Chihiro is flying through the air, the next minute she's passed Yubaba's test, the next moment she's back in the human world going to her new house... I mean... Couldn't we have drawn that out a bit more? We just abandon every character we've grown to know except slightly Haku... Didn't stupid Chihiro have ANY desire to say goodbye to her other friends from the bathhouse like Lin and Kamaji??? WHERE'S THE APPRECIATION HERE?! Then at the end her dad does a nice job posing his comment about how moving to a new place was a little scary... I was expecting a dramatic pause and Chihiro to look out the window to see something that reminded her of the bathouse and then smile and say, ""I think I can handle it..."" We don't even get a final shot of her face and she says it so fast before the credits role my little sister completely missed it...But besides that, this is a wonderful movie... Although Chihiro's dubbed voice was a tad annoying at times, most of the voice actors were EXTREMELY well-selected which really surprised me since I've witnessed the horrible dubbings of many great Japanese films... I really liked Lin's voice... It seemed PERFECT for her part... Chihiro's voice in the subbed made me wish for ear plugs! She has this scratchy hoarse voice that sounds like some old dying woman! The French version was cool! (There aren't enough movies translated into French... What's the point of taking it if you never get to use it?) The music is beautiful and the message that by conquering her fears, Chihiro became a better person and was able to save the ones she loved was well put across... I only speculate how Chihiro will react to the human world after spending so much time in the bathhouse... Oh well, guess we'll never know...

598464,A1L220BNTP6WYZ,B00005JLET,Charles Hugh Smith,"[0, 0]","Spirited Away is a beautifully realized animated (anime) film on spiritual decay and renewal set in modern-day Japan. The subtexts are rather bluntly stated: the uber-bourgeois Dad and Mom (driving an Audi, we note, a very expensive proposition in Japan) stumble upon a feast prepared for the spirits. Gorging themselves on the feast, they are transformed into huge pigs for their trespass. (Humans, by the way, smell bad to the spirits; the spiritual rot of humanity fills the very air.)Their young daughter, Chihiro, refuses to eat, and is thus spared. She is the pure-hearted heroine of the movie, the one who refuses the blandishments of greed and excess. When a spirit causes a free-for-all in the spirits' huge bath house (furo) by scattering gold from his fingertips, only Chihiro has no interest in scrambling for the material wealth. When the gold is revealed later to be nothing but dirt, her wisdom and purity of spirit stands in stark contrast to the wild greed of everyone else.When a truly repulsive spirit enters the bath house, it falls to Chihiro to lead the stinking mass of oozing filth to a large tub. She discovers a sword embedded deep in the repulsive spirit's body, and with the combined efforts of the entire bath house workforce, she succeeds in removing the weapon. But the sword is not a single blade; out of the wound pours rusty bicycles and a mountain of industrial and consumer crud. This avalanche of waste spews out, filling the entire cavernous room; for the spirit is a river spirit, and this mountain of metal [...] is everything that has been thrown into the river by humans.This is a story of a whiny, self-centered girl who grows through confronting enormous challenges into a powerful force for love and renewal. But more pointedly, it is also a story of the spiritual corruption of modern Japan: greedy and wasteful beyond measure, gorging on consumerist trash which is thoughtlessly dumped into the landscape.That is to say, the film could have easily been made by a sharp-penned filmmaker in the U.S. about the very same spiritual rot and consumerist greed which similarly afflicts our culture.

In addition to his gorgeous artwork, landscapes, and character designs, he is incredibly imaginative and can weave a tapestry of story that no one else would even think of. So when I say that this film is one of his best, I mean it as incredibly high praise, because everything the man has done seems to turn to gold.The easiest comparison to make between Spirited Away and anything in the western world is to the works of Lewis Caroll and the adventures he wrote about Alice in Wonderland. That is not to say that Spirited Away is some sort of Japanese adaptation of Carroll's work; it merely shares similar themes and sense of imagination. The story focuses around Chihiro, whose parents become enchanted and turn into pigs, leaving her to interact with a strange fantasy world of witches and spirits as she tries to save them. Describing the details of the story is a waste of time, because they need to be experienced in order to really understand their charming brilliance.Fans of Miyazaki's other works will find similarities to his previous films here, but also steps forward in terms of both art and story. For newcomers or people unfamiliar with Japanese anime, this is one of the best first steps you can take into the medium. It shows off one of the best creators of all time in top form.

Gorgeous animation, drenched with mood swings (from happy to sad to angry to confused) and filled with subtle details, Spirited Away captures the beauty of love, the frustration of being misunderstood, how frightening it is to be thrown into a new situation, the greed of humankind as well as showing how a little human kindness goes a long, long way.Spirited Away follows Shihiro (aka Sen) as her family unwittingly wander into a spirit world and treat it with utmost disrespect. Her parents are held captive by the head honcho Yubabba while Sen must learn the ways of the spirit world in order to win them back and return the real world. I won't give anything awy, but she starts of a frightened and pathetic little girl and finishes a strong, intuitive young woman.This isn't a kids films with enough charm to win over the rest of us, its a genuinely wondorful piece of work with messages that apply to everyone.

598472,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,B00005JLET,"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess""","[13, 15]","""Spirited Away"" was my welcome into anime, and a good one at that. Japanese animation is sometimes hard to follow and often confusing but this is very easy to understand. The creative works of Hayao Miyazaki previously include classics such as ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Castle In The Sky"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", but ""Spirited Away"" is his latest and most acclaimed to date, winning countless awards and deservedly so. There's always been a certain magic to his movies and this is no exception.As a family becomes lost while looking for their new home, they stumble upon a train station that leads them to an old, abandoned theme park. The young girl Chihiro has an eerie feel about the place so she's reluctant to explore and begs to go back, but as her Mom and Dad become enticed with the smell of delicious food cooking from a distance, they ignore her pleas and venture further into the shops, leaving poor, frightened Chihiro with no choice but to follow.Her parents eventually come across plates stacked of tasty eateries and indulge themselves in it. As they try to persuade Chihiro to join them, she briskly shakes her head and, frustrated, wanders off on her own. It's then when she notices a bath house and comes to meet a mysterious boy named Haku who warns her to get out of there. As he pushes her away, darkness descends and the place no longer seems abandoned as the lights flicker on and the night comes alive with black ghosts (or spirits). As she runs back to her parents, what she finds instead are her Mom and Dad transformed into pigs. Confused and scared, she races back to the entrance only to realize that it's covered with deep waters now as a boat arrives with masked figures cloaked in drapes. As she tries to convince herself that this is all just a dream as she struggles to wake up, Haku (an oddly familiar soul) returns to her side, giving her substance so she doesn't fade and become invisible. In time she learns to trust him and he promises to assist in getting her parents back so she can leave this place and return home. But first she must blend in and demand work from the boilerman, whom happens to have legs and arms like a spider, to escape the greed that could trap her in this strange world forever. Through a series of events she eventually becomes suspicious of Haku's motives but has no other options in saving her parents. Along the way she makes new friends, becomes a stronger person, and faces challenges that help unearth the courage from within herself.""Spirited Away"" has everything you'd expect from a fantasy movie, such as a dragon that reminds me of ""A Neverending Story"" and a witch named Yubaba (with a very big head and an even bigger baby, mind you), but the imagination and storytelling are truly original and you never know what's going to happen next.

598473,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JLET,"Cloud ""...""","[8, 9]","The other day I ran into a friend of mine at a gas station/video store. She was asking me whether a certain family movie was appropriate for her 3-4 year old daughter. I said yeah(even though it's not the greatest movie) and I got to thinking whether to suggest a Ghibli film. Problem is is that most of them aren't exactly ""for all ages"" since there's no dance-y numbers, obvious comic relief and easy to follow plots. So we have Spirited Away, which despite being an excellent film, might not be the first one you should use to test your kid(s) on Studio Ghibli films.Chihiro and her parents are travelling when they come across a tunnel. They go through it to end up in an abandoned town which has a lot of food. Everyone except Chihiro eats only for them to turn into pigs. Eventually, she ends up in a bath house which caters to gods and they're not particularly interested in humans. She has to somehow manage to escape the bath house and get home with the help of some friends.Now just to clarify what I meant in the first paragraph, this is a 2 hour film and its quite packed with information and characters. Not to mention it's pretty much a talky film with no songs, or gags and jokes a la Shrek or even Toy Story. In many ways, you can consider this more a film for 8-13 year olds than 3-4. They'd probably like how colorful it is but this isn't like Dora the Explorer or Spongebob where the accessibility for a child is instant. As for the scary scenes mentioned, it's not really a big deal, depending on their tolerance. Let's put it this way: did they survive the dwarves hunting the Witch in Snow White or the Ursula fight in Little Mermaid? Yes? Then they'll handle it.There's plenty to like here. First, the animation is of course great, largely hand-drawn which is certainly even more impressive watching it. And like Miyazaki characters, there's no black and white/good and evil characters which makes them all the more human and likable. Although some might not like Yubaba which qualifies has one of the more instantly unlikable characters. The voice acting like the other dubs is likable but I usually click the Japanese option right away. Not that I'm against English dubs, in fact that's how I watched Fullmetal Alchemist, it's just I tend to prefer the original.What should you watch first? Well Totoro is probably likely as well as Kiki's Delivery Service but oddly, the most kid friendly is probably the Cat Returns since there's very little scary parts and it's not plot-heavy.

598475,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JLET,C. Middleton,"[2, 3]","Anime has grown into a popular genre for many people, both young and old, across the world. In some western universities, a striving undergraduate can now take it as a major, even taking the subject further as a research project in the attainment of a Masters degree. One of the more popular anime film features is `Spirited Away'. In fact, in my opinion, it is a good introduction to the genre, as it is a work of pure art, made with compassion and detail, a beautiful film in every respect.At first glance, the story echoes other well known stories, such as `Alice Through the Looking Glass' and `The Wizard of Oz.' Although similar on the surface, in terms of a little girl finding herself in a fantastic land, searching for a way out, `Spirited Away' has it own unique signature. The cast of strange characters are legion, the strangest being `No Face', a black hooded, masked demon-like phantom who, in more ways than one, is the central character, who reveals that greed is within all of us, contrasting the lead, Chihiro, the brave and compassionate little girl, who must pass a series of tests in order to free her parents from the clutches of a terrible spell, brought on, by the way, through their own greed.The story begins with Chihiro and her parents driving through the countryside. They stumble upon a peculiar structure and walk through a tunnel into what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro, of course, is reluctant to enter the place, but her parent's curiosity wins out. In the park they come across shelves upon shelves of delicious food. Mother and father cannot help themselves and begin gorging the food until they're transformed into massive pigs. This is our first clue as to one of the film's central themes: greed. Thus begins Chihiro's journey into a fantastic land of creatures, spirits and evil witches.What I found astounding about this film was the care and attention to detail in every scene. All too often we take for granted just how much work in involved in creating an animated film. There are indeed some astonishing scenes in this film that would of taken days, weeks or even months to create. When viewing this film with this in mind, my appreciation for anime and animation in general, moved straight to the top.

You're Sen."" - Yu-BaabaSoon after the family car carrying an insecure little girl moving to a new town is stopped at the end of a mysterious road in the forest, she and her parents are thrown into a world of magic, danger, and tests, and emerges a strong, assertive young lady. Her name is Chihiro, and she is able to accomplish this successful journey to maturity because she does not lose her own identity to the name-stealing witch, Yu-Baaba. Sen evolves into a true heroine because she never loses the memory of her name, Chihiro, even though she is constantly surrounded by strange characters who have long-forgotten their own names and the importance of being who they were intended to become.The newest installment in Studio Ghibli's unparalleled collection of animation movies, ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" (AKA: ""Spirited Away"", and ""Sen or Chihiro in the Land of the Gods"") accomplishes everything its predecessors did - seamless animation, an engaging story, and a brilliant soundtrack. Spirited Away is a story about a girl who is stuck in a mythical world of gods, ghosts, and witches - Chihiro must overcome adversity and fear in order to save her parents (who have come pigs) and escape the world that has enslaved her. Director Miyazaki Hayao, head of Studio Ghibli, has managed to craft a cinematic masterpiece, one that will doubtless be considered a classic. Spirited Away takes on an extra level of significance, as Miyazaki has announced that it will be his last film. In retrospect, it can be seen that Spirited Away has amalgamated the best elements of previous Ghibli-Miyazaki movies into one spectacular film about a lost little girl named Chihiro. One of these elements is strong character development, which is evident in the character of Chihiro throughout the course of the movie, and becomes the central focus of the movie itself. As the Japanese title suggests, Chihiro undergoes a significant change of character in the movie under the persona of Sen, but she is still able to retain her own identity, unlike the other characters of the story. As Sen, Chihiro is able to bring out the strength and courage that was deep inside her, becoming more independent and accepting of circumstances. In a mythical world that causes people to lose virtue and become greedy, Chihiro is able to remain innocent because she remembers who she was. Through her unclouded perspectives she is able to grow into a courageous, independent, and adaptable individual.The masked ghost is probably the most enigmatic character of the movie, and serves to illuminate Chihiro's shining presence. The ghost is essentially an empty shell - his thoughts and actions are tailored to the desires of those around him. Upon entering the bathhouse, he notices that the sight of gold makes the bathhouse workers squirm in greedy ecstasy, and so he seeks to please them with gifts of gold. By successfully ensnaring the giant frog and eating him, he assumes the shape of a frog, which suggests that the ghost takes on the personality and voice of his prey. The frog was probably eaten first because of its non-humanoid features, to show a physical, and implied mental change, which would not be as obvious when the ghost eats a person. The ghost can never manage to tempt Sen, however. Offering her valuable items such as the bathhouse cards and a handful of gold nuggets, she always politely refuses him. A subtle detail about the ghost is what tells the viewer the environment the bathhouse has - every time that Sen refuses the ghost, the ghost turns increasingly transparent. It is almost as if in order to solidify in the bathhouse, one has to be greedy and desire riches (unless one had eaten the bitter dumpling as her parents did before turning into pigs). This idea of solidification is also shown with the arrival of Zeniiba at the bathhouse, where she cannot assume an opaque state. This is probably due to the virtuous intentions of Zeniiba, Yu-Baaba's older twin sister, who is not driven by greed. Although the two sisters look, dress, and talk the same way, the personalities are wildly different. While Yu-Baaba is the owner of an extravagant bathhouse for the gods, the centerpiece of a festive town, Zeniiba lives by herself in a small, isolated cottage with flowers on the doorframe. While Yu-Baaba's world may be one of forgetfulness and stolen identities, Zeniiba's is one of recovered old memories and a strong sense of self. Chihiro is told to treasure her name, and to be assertive of her identity. The masked ghost is also asked to stay at Zeniiba's house to serve as her assistant - in this peaceful and humble environment, the ghost has nothing but kindness to learn from Zeniiba.Throughout the film, Haku, an intelligent boy who befriends Sen soon after she is left by her parents who have tranformed into gluttonous pigs, unknowlingly guides her back on her strange journey to her former self. When Haku in not outside the bathhouse, he is a tormented flying white dragon, constantly searching for relevance to the reason for his being. Eventually we learn the bond between Sen and Haku, but not before a wild ride through this animated feast for the eyes first.This film may be too intense for little ones as there are scenes of horror, violence, and blood (including bloody vomitus). Young teens will certainly have a level of maturity to be able to see it and ask questions, and hopefully engage in ""spirited"" conversation about all things Sen. I've viewed it half a dozen times, and I still get more out of it each time.

A friend lent it to me and I hesitated to watch it for about 2 months, until I finally decided ""why not?"" I am truly very happy that I decided to watch this film. It is nothing short of a masterpiece. The film is about a young girl who gets lost in a world of spirits after her greedy parents get turned into pigs. During the film she learns many things about herself. Writing from an artists' point of view, the music and art in this movie are absolutely stunning. The animation is very realistic and captivating, allowing the viewer to enter an imaginary world which seems to be filled with surprises for both the protagonist and the viewer. The music adds to the beauty of this animated world. Even more wonderful than this is the story. At first it may seem trivial, but as the film progresses you will notice that it is in fact very deep. The protagonist encounters many tempting things through her journey but refuses them and there are several references to greed in the film. Younger children may not pick up on this, but older ones will most certainly understand the moral of the story. However, this deep side to the film does not by any means overpower the more magical, fun side of it. You will be captivated by the adventure and won't want to stop watching!

English version or not, this plays as well as any picture I've ever experienced.  Over 40 years ago as a boy, I was enchanted by a special animated film (of who's name I can't remember, and I've never found again). The film was about a young boy learning to be a man. He was taught by a wise man, wizard, sensei or something like that, in ways that changed his view of the world and his perception of himself.  The challenges he faced were very ""Eastern"", (yet still universal) and the philosophy learned has carried through my life to this day. Spirited Away is the type of movie that can have this kind of effect on young viewers.  The positive experience we can draw from movies like this, can't be compared to banal animation films with dancing tea cups, and weak lessons in PC morality.Unfortunately Disney wants to control the animation market for young children.  Its pathetic efforts in the releasing of Spirited Away, and the previous Ghibli Studio movie Princess Mononoke, provide compelling evidence that Disney fears the intrusion of quality competition into its US marketplace.  I had to drive over 100 miles to see Spirited Away because Disneys maximum release was 151 theaters, and that was only for a week.  I would encourage any anime fan or any discerning parent to buy the DVD or video when it is released.

Chihiro doesn't want to move, feels her parents don't understand or pay attention, and wishes she were somewhere else.  She ends up in a magical world full of strange and fantastic beings.  Of course, she ends up facing dangers and has an opportunity to become the hero, which teaches her more about herself and amazes everyone else.  It is a well done story.  I don't want to trivialize it by saying the plot points we know.  It is how those plot points are worked out that is fresh and inspiring.  The movie is peopled by characters that range from beautiful to frightening, from mundane to so weird you wonder about the mind that could conceive of such a thing.The animation is the best yet from Studio Ghibli.  I simply was stunned by what I was seeing on the screen.  Where do you come up with creatures like these?  And where do you get the time and patience to draw such detailed and beautiful things.  I wish I could get prints of some of the images and hang them on my walls.And while I love the movie a great deal, my kids loved it even more.  My own ten year old says it is the best movie ever.  What better endorsement is there than that?There is also a very nice short on the making of the movie - especially bringing it to America including some of the cultural difficulties in translation.

It is rather ironic that his presence in North America consists of a devoted cult following because his films have barely been shown here because of Disney. The studio has the distribution rights to all of Miyazaki's films on this continent and has sat on them for years or released them direct to video with little to no fanfare. This changed with Princess Mononoke which generated such a critical buzz that Disney ended up releasing it in a few theatres.It paved the way for Miyazaki's next effort, Spirited Away, which is the most successful film in Japanese history (it grossed over $200 million before it was shown in North America!). Despite Pixar's John Lasseter championing the film, Disney still gave it a limited theatrical release (compared to their own titles) here in North America. This made its surprise win at the 2002 Academy Awards for Best Animated Film all the more of an upset. Now, Spirited Away is out on DVD on a two-disc set.From the haunting image of a riverboat full of lights that drifts along the water at night to the amusing sight of little balls of soot dancing along the floor and carrying tiny lumps of coal, Spirited Away is full of images that are as stunning as anything this side of Disney. Characters flying gracefully through the air is but one of the many flights of fancy that populates Miyazaki's movie. It is this sense of wonderment and the feeling of experiencing a waking dream that recalls the original Fantasia.One of the most refreshing aspects about Spirited Away is its to appeal to people of all ages. It stresses character and story over merchandising, which is such a novel concept in this day and age. One really gets the feeling that this movie was made by a true artist who has something personal to say.Aside from the movie itself, the first disc also contains a superficial featurette entitled, &quot;The Art of Spirited Away.&quot; John Lasseter and some of the American voice actors are interviewed and praise Miyazaki, however too much emphasis is placed on the English translation and not enough is spent examining the film.Disc two begins with &quot;Behind the Microphone,&quot; a featurette on the American actors who provided the voices for the dubbed version of Spirited Away. This extra feels like Disney is patting itself on the back a little too much. &quot;Select Storyboard-to-Scene Comparison&quot; takes a few scenes and allows the viewer to go back forth from the storyboards to the final product. While this is a nice feature you cannot have both on screen at the same time for a true comparison. The strongest supplement is &quot;Nippon Television Special,&quot; a fascinating look at Miyazaki and his crew making Spirited Away. It clocks in at 40 minutes and almost makes up for the superficiality of the other extras.The extras on these DVDs are obviously targeted towards newcomers to Miyazaki's world. This is fine but in the process, Disney is alienating his more devote fans. However, the stunning transfer and the option to enjoy the movie in its original Japanese with English subtitles, more than makes up for the lack of substantial supplemental material. This movie is required viewing not just for fans of animation but for film buffs in general.

598486,A854E5FCL8X1I,B00005JLET,customer,"[0, 0]","Spirited Away (2001) is Hayao Miyazaki's eighth film in which he not only animated, but directed and wrote the screenplay for it, as well. It is a true gem made in the tradition of his previous classics like Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke.Although the animation created by Miyazaki and his team at Studio Ghibli is fantastically beautiful, as always, but I also enjoyed the story:It is about a spoiled young girl named Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase in the English dub) who is moving to a new home. When her parents decide to take a short cut, they stumble upon a supposedly abandoned theme park. As Chihiro explores, her parents stop to eat. She returns to find them transformed into pigs. She meets a boy named Haku (Jason Marsden) who leads her to a mysterious bathhouse for spirits in order to avoid Chihiro suffering the same fate as her parents. Chihiro is put to work by Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette) the greedy witch who is the boss of the bathhouse. As Chihiro adjusts to her new life, she becomes a kinder, more accountable, and caring person. However, Chihiro still hopes that she will one day be reunited with her parents.One aspect of the film that I admired is that the characters are not flat. It is a problem that I think is typical in many films (Disney in particular). The characters are nearly always categorized as either ""Heroes"" or ""Villains"". Miyazaki creates characters with deep emotions and meaningful actions that don't always fit the cookie-cutter mold for shallow characters, thus making them more human.Additionally, I thought the film was very creative.

It has a coherent plot, a well-developed main character, and supurb animation.It definitely succeeds as a story about a modern girl who winds up as a bathhouse attendant for kami, and has to grow up fast in order to deal with the bizarre situations you'd expect in such a place.However, I think I liked the concept better than the execution.  The idea of an abandoned theme park taken over by kami is really inspired, as is the kami commuter train, where the tracks and stations are all partly covered by water.For me, the eerie situation and atmosphere kept getting buried by the action and dialogue, which often seemed random and pointless.  Slimy blubbery things with tentacles show up, puke lots of slime, eat other slimy creatures, puke them up, and everyone screams a lot.For some reason (too much H.P. Lovecraft?) nearly all kami in Miyazaki movies are kind of shapeless and blubbery, and spew slime and tentacles everywhere at the slightest provocation.More importantly, none of the kami are developed enough as characters for the viewer to get much insight into their motivations.  Yubaba/Zenziba can switch from being manipulative or murderous soul-stealers to kindly grandmothers in the blink of an eye, and like the rest of the cast, always seem to push Chihiro in the direction she needs to go to finish the story.  I had the frustrating impression that the whole story simply existed for the sake of Chihiro's psychological growth.

Miyzaki has created a unique, bizarre, slightly disturbing, always charming and fascinating animated world unlike any you've ever seen.I'm not much into Japanese anime, and I haven't seen any of Miyazaki's other films, but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; puts to shame many of Disney's more recent movies ... as a matter of fact, I like it more than &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; which is saying something.What a magical movie. It is completely unpredictable, but once you get started watching it, I challenge you to walk away. The animation is at once startlingly realistic and beautifully surreal. You are inside an environment that feels both ancient and brand-new. It tells the classic hero story, populating it with characters that are fresh and interesting, and there's no shortage of insight into human behavior, something the very best &quot;cartoons&quot; are careful to include.My favorite characters are, of course Chihiro, the little girl who changes from a whiney, self-centered, materialistic brat into a more mature person capable of caring for others and taking responsibility for herself; Yubaba, the amusingly large-headed witch who runs a bathhouse for disembodied spirits and is by turns villainous and sympathetic; and No-Face, the mysterious apparition whose timid behavior masks a monsterous appetite for affection. I also love Yubaba's &quot;bodyguards,&quot; three freakish green heads that literally tumble about muttering &quot;oy, oy,&quot; and ... well, all of the characters are wonderful.

Clearly Miyazaki's masterpiece, it's wins in the Berlin Film Festival and the Oscars is very much deserved, as it shows that anime can be imaginative, intelligent, and inspiring at the same time.Chihiro is a whiny and petulant spoiled pre-teen brat who is clearly not looking forward to moving to a new city, a far cry from the responsible Satsuki in Tonari No Totoro.A presumed shortcut takes Chihiro and her parents to a tunnel, through which they pass into an amusement resort that the father presumes went bust when the bubble economy collapsed.  The adventure begins when in a moment recalling Circe and Odysseus's sailors, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs, and she finds herself stranded in the spirit world.  Her only help seems to be Haku, a boy sporting a Prince Valiant coif and is valiant.  Humans are forbidden here and in order to survive, she must work for Yubaba, the giant-headed sorceress crone who runs the establishment.  Chihiro survives, but at the cost of losing her name, which becomes Sen.  Yubaba owns every employee here, body and soul.  Nevertheless, Chihiro/Sen still must get her parents restored to human form and return to their car by the tunnel.She is also befriended by Lin, one of the serving wenches initially reluctant to work with her, and from her, Chihiro/Sen learns good manners, such as saying thank you, and how to work hard.  The way Lin and the other girls' eyes are drawn may be a reference to Chinese immigrants working unrewarding menial jobs in Japan, especially judging Lin's name.  Haku though becomes the focus of her attention at one point, to which she risks her job and safety when he's injured and close to death.The bathhouse is a posh and decadent establishment, a Las Vegas for spirits who relax in baths and eat lots of good food.  Compared to other creature menageries seen in Star Wars or Return Of The Jedi, Sento No Chihiro features some imaginative, ghostly, and at times cuter creatures than anything from Jabba's palace.  They range in form, shape, and size, such as the giant radish god who nearly takes up an entire elevator cubicle, down to the cute soot sprites who lug the coal nuggets to stoke the boilers that keep the hot water coming.A high point comes when a stink demon enters the bathhouse and its true identity revealed when first a bicycle and then other kinds of metal garbage is pulled from its side, also recalling the fable of Androcles and the Lion, but serving as a sad reminder of how rivers are used for dumping.As for Kaonashi, the transparent and mysterious black creature who mutters &quot;uh&quot;, he seems to embody someone who wants to be useful or wanted to an impersonal and capitalist world.  He is able to produce the herbal tags Chihiro needs for a tub, and all he wants in return is friendship.  Chihiro recognizes that the bathhouse, with its greedy employees who abuse his powers, is bad for him and helps him get out.The striking scene of the train filled with faceless spirit salarymen is the testament to the soulless and unrewarding corporate world.  These spirits could be anybody, but does anyone care or think they are real individuals?Joe Hisaishi's trademark melodic and swelling piano score is put to good use as he did in the films Kikujiro and Parasite Eve among others.  And the soot sprites came out in Tonari No Totoro, but Yubaba and Kamaji are evolved characters from Castle In The Sky, where they were the sky pirates.Miyazaki's masterpiece, in terms of story and animation, and with a character who really grows up to be a more responsible and loving person.

As for anyone who ever ""was 10 years old"" as Miyazaki says, be more wary. It is at heart a children's film that could have easily been produced by Disney.

598494,A2OMOO9PDZEVOG,B00005JLET,Darryl Fabia,"[11, 11]","The latest of Miyazaki's works ported over to the U.S. via Disney's funding is probably one of the best animated films to hit American shores to date, even going so far as to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Picture of 2002, and it certainly deserves it.Set at first in modern-day Japan, the movie begins with a ten-year old girl named Chihiro moving to a new house with her parents. After a wrong turn, her father decides to make a shortcut through the woods, which leads the three to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park, where her parents find food sitting out and begin to stuff themselves like pigs. Chihiro refuses to eat and goes exploring, and as nightfall approaches, it becomes clear that this is not an abandoned amusement park, but a place thriving with activity. When she tries to find her parents to escape, she discovers that they have transformed into pigs after gorging themselves on the food of the spirits.To survive in this new world, Chihiro is befriended by a boy named Haku, who helps her hide from the spirits until she can reach the bath house, where she must get a job from Yu-baba or be turned into an animal like her parents.""Sprited Away"" takes a different path than the conventional Disney film that so many are used to in animated films. For one, there aren't any musical numbers, which is almost always a plus (the only animated films I can think of where the the musical numbers set well were ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which had but two that worked while the rest interrupted the plot, and ""Lilo & Stitch,"" where the songs and story seamed together flawlessly.) The animation is also very different, consisting of Japanese animation (anime) to create characters and settings that flow very smoothly.There's more to the difference than simple audio and visual flavor, though. Chihiro is not the standard hero. She's a whiny, immature brat (as Yu-baba puts well) and won't stop complaining at first. It isn't until she's pressed with incredible odds and responsibilites (some of which force her to break down) that she can begin to grow up and face the strange world around her.That strangeness is yet another difference. The world that Miyazaki has created here is nothing short of odd, tossing in plenty of spirits and gods of Japanese folklore, and even poking fun at some of them, such as the Radish Spirit.Yu-baba isn't a clean ""villain"" either. In fact, she's more of an antagonist than a true villain, as she really is protecting her property and her ability to earn profit, while Chihiro is an invader, even if she is innocent, and threatens the spirits' way of life. Some may call this evil, but they would do the same thing when put in a position of defending what they hold dear, as petty as it may seem.There are themes and subtle symbolisms riding in ""Spirited Away"" as well. Much of it involves the effect of humans on the enviroment, as clearly evidenced when Chihiro's parents are eating the food that belongs to the spirits, or the endearing scene with the Stink Spirit. There are also things that I have yet to decipher, such as the separation between adults and children, but I really don't know. The shadow people of the train harks some sort of symbolism, but I don't know it yet (if anyone has any theories, contact me.)Everything about the plot and characters will take in children, adolescents, and adults. The visuals are stunning and look wonderful, only catching off when we some of the CG takes place when the train passes a house later in the movie. And then, there's the music, an absolutely wonderful score by Joe Hisaishi, who's composed scores for other Miyazaki films. ""Reprise,"" when matched with its scene, is enough to bring tears.The DVD isn't all that great, but it has a nice animation on the menu. There are a couple features, as well as some Disney trailers. The second disc has a few extras, but much is in Japanese. The trailers for ""Spirited Away"" will seem like poor advertising for those used to American-made trailers.The DVD features aren't important though. I wasn't even expecting a 2nd disc when picking this up, so it was really just a nice bonus. The real gem is the movie, in all it's wonder and glory, and it begs multiple viewing (which you'd do anyway, right? Why buy it otherwise?) If any movie deserves credit and attention, it's this one.

598496,A34JAXR0W215IP,B00005JLET,Das Book,"[3, 3]","Normally I wouldn't have bothered writing this review; after all, Spirited Away has close to 700 5-star reviews on Amazon already, so who would ever bother to read mine, even if they dug it out from beneath all the others?  But having just rewatched this movie for the bazillionth time--I've honestly lost count by now--I found myself motivated to sit down and write a review that may never be read, simply because I love the movie so much.  (If you're reading this, thanks!)Let me start by pointing out that I'm a huge fan of all of Hayao Miyazaki's works, but Spirited Away is easily the best of them all (at least until his next movie, which is scheduled to be released in Japan in the summer of 2008).  Let me also point out that you don't have to be a fan of anime to enjoy this film.  To be sure, the plot does draw very heavily on the Shinto faith and its associated stories and legends; but even those who have never heard of Shinto can watch and enjoy Spirited Away.  The reason is simple: In spite of its religious trappings, the movie is at its core a story of love, sacrifice, and growing up.  In the beginning, Chihiro is whiny, depressed at having to move to a new home, and generally incapable of seeing anything beyond the tip of her nose; she complains a lot, doesn't do much of what she's told, and generally seems determined to make the worst of everything.  Of course, she's learned her lesson by the time the credits roll, but the movie never feels the need to hammer that lesson home for the viewer; like the best of storytellers, Miyazaki-san is a master at delivering the medicine with just the right amount of sugar.  The universe itself, as fantastic and whimsical as it is, is so beautifully presented that even the unbelievable seems completely plausible; CGI is used in a few instances, but only in small amounts, and even then the computer graphics blend with the traditional animation almost seamlessly.Which brings me to the movie's other major selling point.  Spirited Away is truly a sight to behold, full of colors and movement that would have made Walt Disney lock himself in his bedroom and never speak to anyone again; light and shadow and colors are used with impeccable skill, and when combined with the work of what has to be the most talented foley team in history and music by the unparallelled Joe Hisaishi, the result is a movie that you can quite literally lose yourself in.It's hard for me to say which voice track I recommend more; on one hand, the original Japanese with subtitles is a little bit closer to Miyazaki-san's original intent, but on the other hand, the voice acting on the English track is so spot-on that, if such a thing as ""perfection"" could be said to exist, it would be fair to just go ahead and call it perfect.  (The English vocal track also fills in some of the gaps for American viewers who aren't familiar with the customs and trappings of Shinto.)  Since the movie was released in the US by the Walt Disney Company, the vocal cast is star-studded, a rarity for an anime release; John Ratzenberger's brief poetic interlude near the middle of the movie (improvised on the fly in the recording studio) is particularly noteworthy, and hilarious to boot, as is David Ogden Stiers' performance as Kamaji.  Of course, the Japanese voice acting is beautiful too, so you really can't go wrong either way.In the end, there's very little that could be said against Spirited Away.  There is violence and bloodshed, to be sure, but it's of such a fantastical quality that I honestly don't see most viewers over six years old having a problem with it.  Plus, the main character, for all of her initial flaws, turns out in the end to be incredibly bright and resourceful; this is a hallmark of the works of Hayao Miyazaki, an avowed femininst who believes that women and girls are every bit as capable as any male.  Since I happen to agree with him, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  To anyone who's sick of the sort of cookie-cutter garbage that's marketed as good family viewing nowadays, Spirited Away will provide all the relief you'll ever need.",5,You literally cannot go wrong with this one!,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,4119,"['Normally', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'writing', 'review', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'close', '700', '5-star', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'already', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'bother', 'read', 'mine', 'even', 'dug', 'out', 'others', 'having', 'just', 'rewatched', 'movie', 'bazillionth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'honestly', 'lost', 'count', 'now', 'found', 'motivated', 'sit', 'down', 'write', 'review', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'read', 'simply', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'reading', 'thanks', 'Let', 'start', 'pointing', 'out', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'works', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'easily', 'best', 'least', 'next', 'movie', 'scheduled', 'be', 'released', 'Japan', 'summer', '2008', 'Let', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'anime', 'enjoy', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'plot', 'draw', 'very', 'heavily', 'Shinto', 'faith', 'associated', 'stories', 'legends', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Shinto', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'reason', 'simple', 'spite', 'religious', 'trappings', 'movie', 'core', 'story', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'growing', 'up', 'beginning', 'Chihiro', 'whiny', 'depressed', 'having', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'generally', 'incapable', 'seeing', 'anything', 'tip', 'nose', 'lot', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'what', 'told', 'generally', 'determined', 'make', 'worst', 'everything', 'course', 'learned', 'lesson', 'time', 'credits', 'roll', 'movie', 'never', 'need', 'hammer', 'lesson', 'home', 'viewer', 'best', 'storytellers', 'Miyazaki-san', 'master', 'delivering', 'medicine', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'sugar', 'universe', 'fantastic', 'whimsical', 'so', 'beautifully', 'presented', 'even', 'unbelievable', 'completely', 'plausible', 'CGI', 'used', 'few', 'instances', 'only', 'small', 'amounts', 'even', 'then', 'computer', 'graphics', 'blend', 'traditional', 'animation', 'almost', 'seamlessly.Which', 'brings', 'movie', 'other', 'major', 'selling', 'point', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'truly', 'sight', 'behold', 'full', 'colors', 'movement', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'lock', 'bedroom', 'never', 'speak', 'anyone', 'again', 'light', 'shadow', 'colors', 'are', 'used', 'impeccable', 'skill', 'when', 'combined', 'work', 'what', 'be', 'most', 'talented', 'foley', 'team', 'history', 'music', 'unparallelled', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'result', 'movie', 'can', 'quite', 'literally', 'lose', 'hard', 'say', 'voice', 'track', 'recommend', 'more', 'one', 'hand', 'original', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'little', 'bit', 'closer', 'Miyazaki-san', 'original', 'intent', 'other', 'hand', 'voice', 'acting', 'English', 'track', 'so', 'spot-on', 'thing', 'perfection', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'exist', 'would', 'be', 'fair', 'just', 'go', 'ahead', 'call', 'perfect', 'English', 'vocal', 'track', 'also', 'gaps', 'American', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'customs', 'trappings', 'Shinto', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'US', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'vocal', 'cast', 'star-studded', 'rarity', 'anime', 'release', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'brief', 'poetic', 'interlude', 'middle', 'movie', 'improvised', 'fly', 'recording', 'studio', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'hilarious', 'boot', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'performance', 'Kamaji', 'course', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'too', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'either', 'way.In', 'end', 'very', 'little', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'be', 'sure', 'such', 'fantastical', 'quality', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'most', 'viewers', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'having', 'problem', 'main', 'character', 'initial', 'flaws', 'out', 'end', 'be', 'incredibly', 'bright', 'resourceful', 'hallmark', 'works', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'avowed', 'femininst', 'who', 'women', 'girls', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'capable', 'male', 'happen', 'agree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly', 'enough', 'anyone', 'who', 'sick', 'sort', 'cookie-cutter', 'garbage', 'marketed', 'good', 'family', 'viewing', 'nowadays', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'will', 'provide', 'relief', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'need']",N/A
598497,A14E9I0FO6EVBT,B00005JLET,dave-o,"[6, 6]","Hayao Mayazaki's stunning work takes the boundaries of traditional cel animation and stretches it to a point no Western animated movie has in quite some time now. The film owes a lot to Lewis Carroll as much as it does Osama Tezuka. Chihiro is a reserved apprehensive girl who is transported to a world of large fuzzy gods and old Japan-style theme-parks turned marketplaces and bathhouses. Transformation is a large theme in the film: river gods transformed by human pollution; humans transformed into pigs; Chihiro transformed by her domineering employer into 'Sen'.Like Mayazaki's eco-fable 'Princess Mononoke', this film's Romanticism allows for morals to play through in very clever ways. Characters are more complex than first glance and each has a redeeming side no matter how grotesque. The imagery is stunning at times. Rich Mannerist color schemes with elaborate set designs unfold for the nearly flawless animation to take place in.Having said that, the only flaw in this DVD package is the credit Disney tries to take for some of it in the Bonus Footage. As usual, the Mouse talks down to their audience in their sophmoric and superfluous explainations. English-Version Producer John Lassater comes off like a big dope that (thankfully) Mayazaki can see through. Who cares about Kirk Wise or any of the other Disney directors that had almost nothing to do with the film itself? Skip instead to the Nippon Television documentary that takes you through Studio Ghibli and the final tense months of production.

I was alone when I watched it the first time and it scary! It's hard to describe the sort of scary that it is though.

598504,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JLET,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[19, 25]","""Spirited Away"" could never be confused with a traditional Disney flick.  After taking a wrong turn on the way to their new house, Chihiro and her parents stumble upon what they believe is a deserted theme park. In a terrifying scene, they are ripped apart  - the parents transformed into obscenely greedy pigs and Chihiro literally fading away. Rescued by Haku, the apprentice to the witch Yubaba, Chihiro soon discovers she is trapped in a bathhouse for spirits and gods.  Many hilarious, other frighteningly evil, these spirits give the bathhouse an eery surreality that Chihiro comes to embrace.Using his considerable talent, Miyazaki has once again created an inspired, stunningly animated film.  Those raised on Disney might find themselves off-balance without the moralistic overtones, but Miyazaki does not create his films for young children.  As with ?Princess Mononoke,? this film is far too intense and complex for those under eight.  Miyazaki's films are about story and visual delights - and ?Spirited Away? is no exception.  His characters are well-defined and multi-dimensional, often charming in an off-beat way.  Chihiro makes an irresistible heroine, and Haku is a magnetic, appropriately mysterious hero.  Even the comedic giant baby (I laugh as I think of him) fills the screen with life.The dubbed version of this movie is actually better than most dubbed versions of Japanese movies, with added lines to help those not familiar with Japanese culture orient themselves. For example, the Sumo-like radish god is named in the English, but not in the subtitled version.  Also in the English, the parents grunt like pigs before they morph, foreshadowing their fate in a way the Japanese language edition does not.  Although I?m a purist and always prefer the original language version, those watching the dubbed will still be rewarded.I highly recommend this film for everyone over eight years old.  Don't confuse animation with simplicity because ""Spirited Away"" is anything but two-dimensional.  Treat yourself to this remarkable film.

598505,A3S7WU6DIH71CC,B00005JLET,Denny Vu Quach,"[24, 25]","Released on July 20th, in 2001 in Japan, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; stayed in theaters for almost 10 months, breaking all the previous box-office records in Japan, including that of &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; by the same director Hayao Miyazaki. With this astonishing film about a girl's spiritual journey, Mr. Miyazaki again showed that he is one of the best directors living in the world. This animation film was also awarded prestageous Golden Bear Prize in Berlin Film Festival, and that is not a surprise at all, after you see this movie.The story quickly is established, so don't ever be late for the show. It traces a girl's strange and fascinating life in another world, where her parents are accidentally magically transformed, and she has to survice herself and return to her own world. To do so, this pudgy-faced little girl Chihiro, now deprived of her name by a greedy witch Yu-baba, has to work at the baths where gods and sprites all over Japan come to take a rest. Chihiro's life is full of wonderful (and often hard, even terrifying) things, and through her experiences she learns how to live, gaining the true will and power, changing from a sulky girl languidly lying on the backseat of a car, into a lively and truely courageous girl.That's all you have to know: you don't need to see its trailer (English version trailer is a bit misleading), and just watch this masterpiece. Though there is a character called &quot;Kao-nashi&quot; (meaning &quot;Faceless&quot;), who out of loneliness does something harmful to the place; and there is an episode about a very stinking monster who turns out something very different, there are no villains, no heroes, and no so-called actions. And another strength of the film comes from its designs of the baths. It is based on a mosaic of Japanese and Western traditions (the witch's office looks obviously Western while Chihiro and other female workers room is inspired from the texitle factory girls' residence 100 years ago) Incredibly, some part are even from Chinese style.The story, some say probably rightly, goes slower in the latter half (of the film that runs more than 2 hours), but &quot;Spirited Away&quot; never lets you down. It's time for any American audience to know Miyazaki's name, and that animation films are not meant for only kids, but for adults.[The following might hopefully help understand some part of the film. No spoilers contained, but you might read them after watching them. Al the names referred to are from Japanese original print.][1] The name &quot;Chihiro&quot; is, when written in Chinese letters, divided into two parts: &quot;Chi-hiro.&quot; The first part &quot;Chi&quot; has another way of pronounciation, &quot;Sen,&quot; which becomes her temporary name.[2] Chihiro's real name is &quot;Chihiro Ogino&quot; which is briefly seen on the contract paper she signs.[3] The handsome boy who offers a help to Chihio is called &quot;Haku&quot; which means in Japanese, &quot;white.&quot;[4] Haku's real name is &quot;Migihayami Kohakusui.&quot; All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.[5] The witch's spoiled baby is called &quot;Bou&quot; (and his name is written prominently in a Chinese letter on his clothes). This is shrewd naming because the word &quot;bou-ya&quot; (which is used to call, affectinately, to baby boys) implies too much fondness to the babies on mother's side.[6] Chihiro's father, at the diapidated red gate, talks knowingly about the posibility of a disused theme park. It is true that Japan saw economic depression after the boom of the 80s, and his remarks, though half telling of his too much confidence, have some ring of truth.[7] For Miyazaki's fans, there are some extra fun: see, for example, the re-appearance of &quot;Susuwatari&quot;s, tiny black speck-like creatures that carry coal in a boiler room. As fans know, they are also seen in Miyazaki's delightful film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro.&quot; And check out one of the &quot;guests&quot; at the spa who looks and moves exactly like Totoro.[8] And those harmless &quot;Susuwatri&quot;s eat Japanese traditional, very sweet confectionary called &quot;Konpeitou&quot; made from sugar. This is the part Japanese viewers smile because of the unexpected combination.[9] In the same boiler room, the spider-like veteran master gives Chihiro &quot;Kaisuu-ken,&quot; coupon-style tickets for train. This is also the part we would smile because we all somehow share the same experience of giving them to children who go somewhere by train or bus, or of finding very old ones somewhere in the desk.[10] That same kind master, seeing Chihiro step on the crawling worm, makes a gesture of a knife with his hand, and touches Chihiro's hands in a unique way. This is a (now out-of-fashion) custom when touching something very dirty, symbolizing the total safety from the object in case, often accompanied with Japanese word &quot;Engacho&quot; (no more connection). This part is also funny to us.[11] In the opening scene. behind the back of Chihiro, you can see the glimpse of half-hidden, red-colored package of chocolate bar, which looks like one famous brand. Probably, this is a small token of thanks for the company (famous for coffee, too), which joined in the tie-in campagin for the film's promotion in Japan.[12] Finally, director Miyazaki says that the film is originally made for unnamed 10-year-old girls he and the movieproducer are both acquainted with, and hope that those girls are delighted to see the film. No doubt they are.",5,Tips For Non-Japanese Speaking Fans: This Is A Masterpiece,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,5670,"['Released', 'July', '20th', '2001', 'Japan', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quot',

In contrast, Spirited Away is a masterpiece of pacing, imagination, and beautiful artistry.

Parts of the film show images of buildings and landscapes in beautiful, sharp color. When the spirits &quot;come out&quot; - the mood changes to a ghosteliness, but then clarity resumes, as if we accept this is as the new &quot;normal&quot;.

I would reccomend all adult viewers and children of a sufficient reading ability to stick with the original Japanese soundtrack, it is vastly superior in terms of mood and storytelling.The extras on this DVD are a mixed bag, but there are many of them.'Behind the Microphone' and 'The Art of Spirited Away' are both Disney efforts and lay on the cheese rather thick. There are a few points of interest in these documentaries regarding the process of translation, but at the end of the day they are both rather mundane fillers. Most annoying is the assertion in,'The Art of Spirited Away', that:&quot;People have said that the characters in Spirited Away are based on Japanese Myth, but they are actually based on people Miyazaki has met.&quot;Whilst it may be true that the personalities and characteristics of the characters are based on real people, the characters themselves are 100% based on Shinto Buddhist mythology. Disney seem to be distancing themselves from this fact, perhaps in order to deter religious extremists who may look upon Buddhism in a negative light and give Disney a hard time.The Nippon TV special is excellent. It provides a remarkable view into the workings of Ghibli Studios and the creation of the movie itself. It shows a corporate animation giant being run like a family business with remarkable success.

598521,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B00005JLET,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[3, 3]","A better question might be; should it get better?  ""Spirited Away"" has been accepted as a masterpiece by the film industry, anime fans and those who blindly believe what they are told.  It sure sounds like I'm about to pick a fight, but actually I'm getting a little introspective and asking you to do the same.  I could easily write a 10 page essay about anime, this film and the state of the art of animation.  I'll try to avoid that here.  However, after watching this film with my family, a big pile of question appeared.  This is both a testament to this films power and to the fact that many people just don't like or understand this style of film art.  I am once again divided on my opinion of a film.  The only way to cut through the fog in my brain is to (once again) break my thoughts into pieces.-WHAT I THINK OF THIS FILMArtistically speaking, this film is brilliant.  My family was divided about this film.  My wife had problems with the jerky animation style.  My 10 year old daughter loved it.  My 6 year old son did not like it.  We all thought it was a bit too long (especially near the end).  I don't know what you would take out.  I think there might be some scenes that could have been removed to little negative affect if we never knew they existed.  But knowing they exist precludes the idea of removing them.  The one thing we all agreed on was the whole river spirit revelation.  We gave out a collective ""HUH?""  This is pretty typical in anime; if the story doesn't get you there, take a shortcut.  That was probably the only unexpected thing I could criticize.  The other thing I found myself criticizing was the actual animation.  I know what anime is and I know why it is, and I sort of expected it, but this film really got me thinking about the state of anime and why it hasn't moved to another level.-A QUICK EDUCATIONDisney style animation is what is known as ""Full"" animation.  Simply put; for every 24 frames in a second, there are 24 unique drawings to complete the required motion.  By this, you get a very smooth, natural feeling motion.  In anime, which uses mostly limited animation, in the 24 frames of one second there might be 12 drawings or less in some cases.  Anime will actually use a static image with a moving camera to imply motion. The result is a somewhat choppy or jerky motion.  This is all done to save money due to tight budget constraints.  Though financially cheap, these techniques have been mastered to a very high level.-WHAT I THINK OF ANIMEI think that good anime challenges how animation looks (see ""Animatrix"" for a compilation of great examples).  Bad anime is pure trash.  Good anime artists really have a knack for capturing the essence of the human form even more so than Disney.  Characters seam to develop effortlessly in anime; one little act or a short phrase or a telling reaction immediately establishes character.  In ""Spirited Away"" even minor characters have strong presence.  The best anime has characters we can all identify with very quickly.  This film produces that in spades.  Western animation is not so adept at this.  I find the limited animation distracting at times.  It is because of this that I don't watch a lot of it.  I enjoy artistic as well as technical achievements.  Sometime anime is fully animated (almost by accident).  It's at these times I realize how much more brilliant anime could be.-WEST V EAST; THE $275,000,000 GORILLA IN THE CORNERI've actually read debates that compared Western ""Disney"" style animation to ""anime"" ([...]  I would argue this was like debating the merits of chocolate ice cream vs. vanilla ice cream; fairly pointless.  However, things have changed enough in recent years that the debate can not be so easily dismissed anymore; not if you are being honest with yourself.  ""Spirited Away"" cost $17MM to produce.  Its global box office receipts totaled $275,000,000.  Who knows what the DVD sales total is?  The same year this film was released, Disney's ""Brother Bear"" made $250,000,000.  Disney has not released budget information, but I'm certain it cost more than $17 million.  This begs the question; is it time for anime to take the next step into full animation?-WOULD MONEY KILL FREEDOMLike life in general, the more money there is at stake, the more pressure there is to succeed.  Some might argue that the really cool stories and audacious subject matter that anime produces would not happen if a big budget were put on the line.  I would argue that $17 million is a big risk; in for a penny, in for a pound.  That's why I limit the idea of fully animated anime to feature films.  It's worth the risk.  People revere anime for what Disney does not provide; fearless, unsafe stories and edgy visuals.  Is it such a stretch to think we won't pay to see what everyone complains we don't get?  I think the market place has spoken.-EXCUSES OR REASONS?Given the financial success of the anime feature films in the past decade or so, is the use of limited animation an excuse?  Or, is the art form known as anime inherently tied to the use of limited animation and the ""moving Manga"" traditions?  I'm not expert enough about anime to provide the answer, but I think it's a question worth asking.  Some in the anime business talk about how they use creative techniques and limited animation to save money, as if this is how it should always be.  Personally, I think anime features are ready for full animation.  Doubling the budget for ""Spirited Away"" (basically drawing twice as much art) would still make it a huge financial success. So money can no longer be an excuse.  Many people are wowed by this film in its current form.  Imagine what it would be like fully animated; mind boggling.  It probably would have made even more money.-WHAT AM I GETTING AT?""Spirited Away"" has an ambitious story, great human characters (even the spirits are human at their core) and incredible artistic vision.  Anime has set new standards for what animated films should explore and this film has kept up that trend.  However, as animation, anime has stayed a step behind.  Though many have come to accept limited animation as an inherent part of anime, I think it's time to raise the bar on these gloriously conceived feature films.  I know these artists can take animation to levels only imagined.  They have the skill and the vision to set new standards.  Yet, we get excuses of low budgets.  Maybe for the serials and Saturday morning fare, but not these ""masterpiece"" feature films.  If ""Triplets of Belleview"" can be made fully animated, why not ""Spirited Away""?If you are an artist, a fan of anime, a student of animation or a fan of fantasy I'd have to recommend this DVD.  If you are a traditionalist Disney fan, then you might have a problem with the unique story telling and less than smooth animation style.  I recognize and enjoy it for what it is, but I'm not going to let it off the hook for what it could have been either.  The real question is; is it still anime if it's fully animated?  I say yes.  Anime isn't just about the animation techniques, but also the visual and story style.",5,I'm Looking for Some Help Here; Can Anime Get Better?,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,7115,"['better',

598522,A1TZDTEULS0618,B00005JLET,"Elianna Greenleaf ""PokeManiac""","[1, 1]","One of Hayao Miyazaki's newest movies, Spirited Away is one of his most engrossing movies. It features a whiny, bratty, and generally dislikable girl named Chihiro. While she and her parents are traveling to their new home, they take the wrong turn and end up faced by a large underpass of sorts, which seems old and decrepit. However, Chihiro's boisterous father insists on barging through the tunnel to the other side. This other side turns out to be a road lined with countless restaurants! Her parents start pigging out at one, and the next time Chihiro looks, Dad and Mom ARE pigs!This is the beginning of a very, very creative story. Chihiro finds herself in a world of incredibly strange creatures and ends up working at a bathhouse for said creatures. Miyazaki obviously takes inspiration from the traditional Japanese religion of Shinto-ism--at one point we encounter a river spirit--and due to this creates a story quite unlike anything American.However, it can get a slightly creepy tone at times. The No-Face creature, which seems to take on the personality of anyone he swallows, ends up running around the bathhouse giving chunks of gold to whoever serves him food. The workers of the bathhouse practically swarm him, yelling with greed and scooping up the gold he scatters. No-Face himself is a rippling hunk of ebony with a white mask for a face and a large gaping mouth directly underneath this emotionless mask. This creates a slightly disturbing visage.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this for children under 12, but for everyone else it's quite enjoyable. We see Chihiro change from a brat to a confident young woman and this, added to the circumstances which cause such changes in her personality, makes Spirited Away a great adventure.",5,"A very interesting experience, but slightly creepy at times",1175644800,"04 4, 2007",2007,1758,"['One', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'newest', 'movies', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'movies', 'whiny', 'bratty', 'generally', 'dislikable', 'girl', 'named', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'are', 'traveling', 'new', 'home', 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'end', 'up', 'faced', 'large', 'underpass', 'sorts', 'old', 'decrepit', 'However', 'Chihiro', 'boisterous', 'father', 'insists', 'barging', 'tunnel', 'other', 'side', 'other', 'side', 'out', 'be', 'road', 'lined', 'countless', 'restaurants', 'parents', 'start', 'pigging', 'out', 'one', 'next', 'time', 'Chihiro', 'Dad', 'Mom', 'ARE', 'pigs', 'beginning', 'very', 'very', 'creative', 'story', 'Chihiro', 'world', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'creatures', 'up', 'working', 'bathhouse', 'said', 'creatures', 'Miyazaki', 'obviously', 'inspiration', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'religion', 'Shinto-ism', 'one', 'point', 'encounter', 'river', 'spirit', 'due', 'story', 'quite', 'anything', 'American.However', 'can', 'get', 'slightly', 'creepy', 'tone', 'times', 'No-Face', 'creature', 'take', 'personality', 'anyone', 'up', 'running', 'bathhouse', 'giving', 'chunks', 'gold', 'whoever', 'food', 'workers', 'bathhouse', 'practically', 'swarm', 'yelling', 'greed', 'scooping', 'up', 'gold', 'No-Face', 'rippling', 'hunk', 'ebony', 'white', 'mask', 'face', 'large', 'gaping', 'mouth', 'directly', 'emotionless', 'mask', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'visage.All', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'children', '12', 'everyone', 'else', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'Chihiro', 'change', 'brat', 'confident', 'young', 'woman', 'added', 'circumstances', 'cause', 'such', 'changes', 'personality', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'great', 'adventure']",N/A

598527,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,B00005JLET,Erica Anderson,"[0, 1]","After seeing ""Howl's Moving Castle"" a few weekends ago and loving every second of it, I thought it would be a good idea to check Hayao Miyazaki's other animated films. I recently rented ""Spirted Away"" and viewed it for the first time.A young girl named Chihiro and her parents are traveling to their new  home. Along the way, the father decides to take a detour. Big mistake. He comes across what he thinks is an abandoned amusement park. When Chihiro's father and mother sees food, they begin to stuff their faces. It turns out that the food is for the gods and spirits who have travelled to this spa for them. As punishment for eating the food, Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. Chihiro meets a mysterious boy named Haku who gives her instructions to go to see about getting a job at the spa from a witch named Yubaba so she can stay and try to help her parents. At first Yubaba was reluctant but eventually she allows Chihiro to stay but at a cost, her name. Chihiro has to go by the name Sen. Over time Chihiro/Sen slowly gains confidence in herself and realizes her full potential.In the beginning, I found Chihiro annoying. She was shrill and obnoxious but as the film went on, her character quickly evolved and became more mature. The writing was excellent. The animation was a delight to watch. Like ""Howl's Moving Castle"", I would have liked to have been able to watch this film in its original language.

598531,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005JLET,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 1]","Anime is always stereotyped as nothing but ADD-indused action, annoying music, characters that surprisingly look the same, and a bad example of style-over-substance. This isn't the case with Miyazaki's Spirited Away. This is a very distinct anime film. Not only is it devoid of many stereotypes that anime in general is associated with, but it's a highly imaginative tale, with some fascinating details that you regularly don't see in Naruto or Bleach (both of which I dislike, by the way). Here's the story: a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro and her parents are moving into a new residence, and she's the only one who condemns the decision. Once they get lost by taking a shortcut through the forest, they come across a mysterious bathhouse. Things start to get worse as Chihiro's parents transform into pigs as they indulge themselves with food, and the way back to their car has been blocked. There is only one way out of this: get a job at the bathhouse that is now up and running again, and hopefully her parents will turn back into their normal selves.With a length of just over two hours, Spirited Away is a visual spectacle of fantasy, drama, and comedy. Miyazaki brings his vivid imagination to life with memorable characters, gorgeous settings, and sequences that feel like they've come straight out of a dream (the train station is one example). I did have a couple of problems with this movie, however. The main character, Chihiro, got on my nerves a few times. She is a third-dimensional character, yes, but can't she PLEASE stop crying and screaming whenever she feels sad and scared?! The other problem I have with this movie is the music. I don't why, but sometimes the music doesn't sound very melodic. It's not the sort of music that you would remember for all time.Well, despite those two flaws, this is still an excellent animated film. It may not be one of my favorites, but I can still acknowledge that this is one of the finest films to have ever been created since the beginning of this new millennium.

I would see the promotions for it on television when I was eleven when it first came out, and I could kick myself for not getting before I became a teenager. A lot of my imagination has deteriorated within that time, but I'm really glad I ended up buying. Being a fan of ""My Neighbor Tortoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" as a kid (which both inspired me majorly) I was wondering if Hayao Mayazaki was same one who created ""Sprited Away"". Doing a little research, I found out it was the same man, so I got the DVD expecting a fantasy, and got something out of my own imagination that got me back to remembering how I used to have so much fun with my own imagination back then.Chihiro (american voiced by Daveigh Chase from The Ring) isn't too thrilled moving away to another town. New school, new friends, and a new house. It's not easy for someone who's just entering into her pre-teens. But when her parents accidentally take a wrong turn, the three find themselves in a seemingly abandoned amusement park. Her parents find some food left out in a restaurant, and when you see food you know someone has to be there. But when Chihiro comes back, she finds her parents have undergone a transformation, and strange shadows going up and down the sidewalks of the once abandoned place. Yet now that darkness has fallen, Chihiro knows something about the place is different, and if she wants to save her parents and herself, the only way out of the place is going straight through it.I don't want to give away too much because if you give away something, you give it all away. Hayao Mayazaki must take these own ideas from his own childhood imagination, because his artwork, and where the plot goes is too amazing to be anywhere else. Being a wannabe author, Mayazaki's work has inspired, and I'm sure for any child who sees Spirited Away or any of his other breathtaking movies will be swept out of the world, and back into their own imagination.Sprited Away is one of the more detailed and well thought out movies of his. Some of them are very easy to figure out, and some of them take a little while, but they deliver just as they always have. This one brings in a little bit of everything, and doesn't really need all explained, but as the story goes on, things fall together, and as a fantasy, you shouldn't think logical. When something comes out of the imagination, nothing is ever logical again.The voice talents are amazing. I was surprised to find out that the highly acclaimed horror remake of a japanese thriller The Ring would have the same voice of Samara (for those of you who have seen it) in another remake. Coincidental? Daveigh Chase did good as little Chihiro, but of course the original is always better. I didn't listen to the japanese voice, but just in case I didn't like the new american voices, it's always good to switch on the subtitles, and change to the original japanese voices. That's what I really like about DVD's.Spirited Away definitely has a good many laughs, but for kids who don't understand them it may be good, but for the adults, they'll be laughing until they can't breathe with the inside jokes all throughout the movie. The DVD also has a good variety of things to choose from unlike the sad DVD for my neighbor Totoro. I hope Mayazaki comes out with more like this, though. He's so highly underrated it's not even funny. At least there's a good number of us who appreciate him.",5,I got spirited away!,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",2005,3462,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sooner', 'would', 'see', 'promotions', 'television', 'when', 'was', 'eleven', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'could', 'kick', 'not', 'getting', 'became', 'teenager', 'lot', 'imagination', 'deteriorated', 'time', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'Being', 'fan', 'Neighbor', 'Tortoro', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'kid', 'inspired', 'majorly', 'was', 'wondering', 'Hayao', 'Mayazaki', 'was', 'same', 'one', 'who', 'created', 'Sprited', 'Away', 'Doing', 'little', 'research', 'found', 'was', 'same', 'man', 'got', 'DVD', 'expecting', 'fantasy', 'got', 'something', 'own', 'imagination', 'got', 'back', 'remembering', 'how', 'used', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'own', 'imagination', 'back', 'then.Chihiro', 'american', 'voiced', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'Ring', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'moving', 'away', 'town', 'New', 'school', 'new', 'friends', 'new', 'house', 'not', 'easy', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'entering', 'pre-teens', 'when', 'parents', 'accidentally', 'take', 'wrong', 'turn', 'three', 'find', 'seemingly', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'parents', 'find', 'food', 'left', 'out', 'restaurant', 'when', 'see', 'food', 'know', 'someone', 'be', 'there', 'when', 'Chihiro', 'back', 'parents', 'have', 'undergone', 'transformation', 'strange', 'shadows', 'going', 'up', 'sidewalks', 'once', 'abandoned', 'place', 'now', 'darkness', 'fallen', 'Chihiro', 'something', 'place', 'different', 'save', 'parents', 'only', 'way', 'place', 'going', 'straight', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'away', 'something', 'give', 'away', 'Hayao', 'Mayazaki', 'must', 'take', 'own', 'ideas', 'own', 'childhood', 'imagination', 'artwork', 'where', 'plot', 'too', 'amazing', 'be', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Being', 'wannabe', 'author', 'Mayazaki', 'work', 'inspired', ""'m"", 'sure', 'child', 'who', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'other', 'breathtaking', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'swept', 'world', 'back', 'own', 'imagination.Sprited', 'Away', 'one', 'more', 'detailed', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'take', 'little', 'while', 'deliver', 'just', 'always', 'have', 'one', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'explained', 'story', 'things', 'fall', 'together', 'fantasy', 'should', ""n't"", 'think', 'logical', 'When', 'something', 'imagination', 'nothing', 'ever', 'logical', 'again.The', 'voice', 'talents', 'are', 'amazing', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'horror', 'remake', 'japanese', 'thriller', 'Ring', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'voice', 'Samara', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'remake', 'Coincidental', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'did', 'good', 'little', 'Chihiro', 'course', 'original', 'always', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'japanese', 'voice', 'just', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'american', 'voices', 'always', 'good', 'switch', 'subtitles', 'change', 'original', 'japanese', 'voices', 'what', 'really', 'about', ""DVD's.Spirited"", 'Away', 'definitely', 'good', 'many', 'laughs', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'adults', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'inside', 'movie', 'DVD', 'also', 'good', 'variety', 'things', 'choose', 'sad', 'DVD', 'neighbor', 'Totoro', 'hope', 'Mayazaki', 'out', 'more', 'though', 'so', 'highly', 'underrated', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'least', 'good', 'number', 'who', 'appreciate']",N/A

There, she must work in a bath house for the spirits until she can think of a way to escape.In many ways, this film is excellent.  The animation is beautiful, the setting is strange and entertaining, the story is full of twists, and the characters posess alot of depth.  What I love most about this movie is the depth of the characters- no one is one dimensionally ""evil"" or ""good"".  Every character posesses good and bad qualities to varying degrees.  Even Chihiro starts off as an unlikeably whiny girl at the beginning, but by the end, has developed courage and self-reliance.  I just love the departure from black-and-white moral categories to a more morally ambigous characters, because the real world is morally ambigous.On another note, the setting of Spirited Away is strange and colorful.  I was very entertained by the bizarre array of bath-house guests, the strange twisting layout of the bath-house itself, and the haunting and beatiful scenery viewed from the train.  Also, anyone who's seen Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro might recognize the return of the soot gremlins.  I had actually seen Spirited Away first, then My Neighbor Totoro a year later, so imagine my surprise when I recently rewatched Spirited Away and saw them.  Soot gremlins!Compared to his other films, this is one of Miyazaki's more energetic and action-packed films.  So, if you've seen some of his other films and couldn't stand the slow pacing of the story, then Spirited Away may be just the thing for you.  Well anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough!  Please watch it at least once!P.S. There's some excellent bonus features available on this dvd.  First of all, there's a nice ""making-of"" feature, a feature on the art of Spirited Away, and an interview with some of the voice actors.  There's also an introduction by John Lasseter (pretty pointless), alot of trailers (seriously?!), and the storyboards (who watches those?).

While made for children, its parade of surreal and often disturbing images seem worlds apart from Disney's usual fare. At times, the film appears better suited for the Ecstasy crowd than the Nickelodeon generation.Disney, to its credit, presents ""Spirited Away"" with no cuts or alterations, an essential provision in the deal with Miyazaki.  The film is presented in widescreen (2.00:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound on its English-language track. Those preferring the original Japanese voice talent must settle for Dolby 2.0. Visuals and audio are up to studio standards.The DVD set's extras work well as an introduction to Miyazaki. A Nippon TV making-of follows Miyazaki and his team of young animators as they create ""Spirited Away."" The docu slips into ""Iron Chef"" territory as it chronicles the team's deadline pressures -- ""Something's wrong with the copier!"" -- but it's a peek at Miyazaki's working life that should intrigue pros and ani fans.

As she tries to save her parents from a terrible curse, she must work at the bathhouse of the spirits. She must befriend the odd spirits around her, and regain her identity, in order to be able to break the curse and leave.While it follows the standard plot of children's movies (child must fend for him/herself in a strange world and befriend allies in order to achieve success), Spirited Away is about as far as you can get from a normal children's movie. It has haunting characters, a profound story, incredible animation and music, and Miyazaki's imagination and sense of how children feel is really set loose here.The American version only has english dialogue, but since this is an animation, and Disney did the dubbing, there is little to complain about here.

I liked Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and a lot of other people must have too, because this particular anime won an Academy Award.Chihiro is moving a to a new house, and soon she'll have to start a new school too. She is not happy about this at all. On the way to their new house in their car, her father decides to take a shortcut through a forest full of strange shrines and statues. The road they take ends all of a sudden at a tunnel, which they follow through to what appears to be an abandoned village full of restaurants. They find one of these restaurants filled with delicious food, which Chihiro's parents sit down and begin to eat. Chihiro tries to get them to stop but they don't, and soon turn into pigs. Night falls on the town, and the restaurants become filled with spirits, come to feast and to relax. It turns out that this place is part of a bathhouse complex for spirits, run by a very large headed woman.  Chihiro doesn't want to be turned into a little piglet girl, so she is forced to get a job at the bathhouse. While she works in this thriving colourful place, she will meet many strange and interesting beings, make all sorts of friends, and uncover several mysteries. Changing schools is easy compared to all this business!It seems to be a trend in Japanese films I've noticed that they don't really explain what's going on in great detail. The ins and outs of things are really only divulged on a need to know basis. They expect you to catch up as you go, which is basically what Chihiro, our main character has to do too in this strange world. There are stacks and stacks of ideas here. It's a very colourful, very imaginative place, with full of weird and fascinating creatures and beings. They don't only look interesting, but many of them have a very interesting motion, if that makes sense. They move in a unique way, thanks to some clever animation. Check out the ""Stink Spirit"" and the mud and gas flowing from his mucky body. Check out how the boiler man uses his ""four-arm"" strength without batting an eyelid (not that you'd be able to see his eyelids, he's wearing glasses). The score is good too, orchestral, though unlike some recent Western films, doesn't get in the way and does actually enchance what's going on.I've been going through Miyazaki's back catalog of films lately, and I'm noticing a few themes and motifs going through his work. Here in Spirited Away we have a dramatic scene around a simple flight of stairs, just like in ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which he'd do later. Also like he'd go on to do in Howl's, there are curses that transform people and people who can turn into flying creatures. There's a lot of flying in his films, actually (""Nausicaa"",""Porco Rosso""). I kind of thought ""Porco Rosso"" too when I saw the parents turned into pigs. What an odd world the man must have going on in his head. Got a few more to hunt down and watch of his, and I very much wonder what I'll see next.Anyone interested in a good fantasy, interesting animations or some fresh imagination, I recommend you check this film out.",5,A Good Bath for Ghosts,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3114,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anime', 'know', 'what', 'like', 'liked', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'must', 'have', 'too', 'particular', 'anime', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award.Chihiro', 'moving', 'new', 'house', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'start', 'new', 'school', 'too', 'not', 'happy', 'way', 'new', 'house', 'car', 'father', 'take', 'shortcut', 'forest', 'full', 'strange', 'shrines', 'statues', 'road', 'take', 'sudden', 'tunnel', 'follow', 'what', 'be', 'abandoned', 'village', 'full', 'restaurants', 'find', 'one', 'restaurants', 'filled', 'delicious', 'food', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'sit', 'down', 'begin', 'eat', 'Chihiro', 'get', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'soon', 'turn', 'pigs', 'Night', 'town', 'restaurants', 'become', 'filled', 'spirits', 'come', 'feast', 'relax', 'out', 'place', 'part', 'bathhouse', 'complex', 'spirits', 'run', 'very', 'large', 'headed', 'woman', 'Chihiro', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'turned', 'little', 'piglet', 'girl', 'forced', 'get', 'job', 'bathhouse', 'thriving', 'colourful', 'place', 'will', 'meet', 'many', 'strange', 'interesting', 'beings', 'make', 'sorts', 'friends', 'uncover', 'several', 'mysteries', 'Changing', 'schools', 'easy', 'compared', 'business', 'be', 'trend', 'Japanese', 'films', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'what', 'going', 'great', 'detail', 'ins', 'outs', 'things', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'divulged', 'need', 'know', 'basis', 'expect', 'catch', 'up', 'go', 'basically', 'what', 'Chihiro', 'main', 'character', 'do', 'too', 'strange', 'world', 'are', 'stacks', 'stacks', 'ideas', 'here', 'very', 'colourful', 'very', 'imaginative', 'place', 'full', 'weird', 'fascinating', 'creatures', 'beings', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'look', 'interesting', 'many', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'motion', 'sense', 'move', 'unique', 'way', 'thanks', 'clever', 'animation', 'Check', 'Stink', 'Spirit', 'mud', 'gas', 'flowing', 'mucky', 'body', 'Check', 'how', 'boiler', 'man', 'four-arm', 'strength', 'batting', 'eyelid', 'not', ""'d"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'eyelids', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'score', 'good', 'too', 'orchestral', 'recent', 'Western', 'films', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'actually', 'enchance', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'going', 'Miyazaki', 'back', 'catalog', 'films', 'lately', ""'m"", 'noticing', 'few', 'themes', 'motifs', 'going', 'work', 'Here', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'have', 'dramatic', 'scene', 'simple', 'flight', 'stairs', 'just', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', ""'d"", 'do', 'later', 'Also', ""'d"", 'go', 'do', 'Howl', 'are', 'curses', 'transform', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'turn', 'flying', 'creatures', 'lot', 'flying', 'films', 'actually', 'Nausicaa', 'Porco', 'Rosso', 'kind', 'thought', 'Porco', 'Rosso', 'too', 'when', 'saw', 'parents', 'turned', 'pigs', 'What', 'odd', 'world', 'man', 'must', 'have', 'going', 'head', 'few', 'more', 'hunt', 'down', 'watch', 'very', 'much', 'what', ""'ll"", 'see', 'next.Anyone', 'interested', 'good', 'fantasy', 'interesting', 'animations', 'fresh', 'imagination', 'recommend', 'check', 'film', 'out']",N/A

I have wanted to see this movie ever since it came out in theaters first, but haven't been able to since this weekend, when it was released into over 700 theaters (the highest theater count yet). The theater was packed, and, judging from the audiences reactions, they all enjoyed the film as much as I did. It is the story of a little girl who gets lost in a spirit world. She has to get a job and seeks help in trying to turn her parents back into humans, for they were turned into pigs. Along her adventure, she (don't remember the name, it was unfamiliar to me) makes friends, learns lessons about trust and greed, and overall becomes a stronger person because of her adventure. She goes into the world as a whiny, complaining, sort of a brat, and leaves as a strong individual who is now ready to handle anything. It is a truly charming story. Some other recommendations to go along with this are KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE (you can buy a 3 DVD set with this film, Kiki's, and another animated feature), MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, and PRINCESS MONONOKE.

Now Sen has to rescue her parents and change them back before the Spirit World figures out she's a human and kill her.There are lots of colorful, weird and supporting characters in this first ever Oscar winning anime, and the way this anime was presented, with it's out of this world animation and great voice overs, it's the only anime worth watching, trust me!",4,"Great Animation, complicated story",1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,849,"['have', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'movies', 'i', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'was', 'fooled', 'shady', 'opening', 'scenes', 'there', 'story', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'girl', 'Sen', 'named', 'spirit', 'world', 'parents', 'barged', 'started', 'eating', 'up', 'food', 'then', 'sun', 'was', 'setting', 'were', 'meant', 'leave', 'change', 'pigs', 'were', 'hypnotized', 'appetizing', 'food', 'stayed', 'then', 'turing', 'pigs', 'Now', 'Sen', 'rescue', 'parents', 'change', 'back', 'Spirit', 'World', 'out', 'human', 'kill', 'are', 'lots', 'colorful', 'weird', 'supporting', 'characters', 'first', 'ever', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'anime', 'way', 'anime', 'was', 'presented', 'world', 'animation', 'great', 'voice', 'overs', 'only', 'anime', 'worth', 'watching', 'trust']",N/A

598557,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,B00005JLET,Henry Platte,"[3, 5]","When this movie was released, in a perfect world, the entire board of directors of the Disney corporation should have sunk on their knees and committed seppuku. This is what innovation looks like, and, in spite (or because of) of its unrelenting weirdness, it's the sort of thing kids can really enjoy - I think, although not being a kid anymore myself, I can't be sure.Spirited Away is a classic fable, mixing the conventions of European and Russian fairy tales with elements of Japanese folklore and contemporary culture. A young girl, Chihiro, somewhat bored and spoiled to begin with, loses her parents to a curse and is trapped in a world of gods and spirits, and undergoes a self-transformative journey which is rarely trite or dully moralizing. What sets it above many similiar animated fables is the sense of danger that is generated - things in this world are so drastic and bizzare that you actually find yourself wondering if the expected happy ending will result.The grotesquery in the film is extreme, and I guess parents should be warned about it; the most striking things include a spirit which devours people (not fatally) and later vomits copiously, a scene in which the male lead in dragon form is badly wounded and bleeds from the mouth, and a scene that actually distrubed me in which a giant baby threatens to break Chihiro's arm. That giant baby is just plain creepy. I don't think kids, who are often more bloodthirsty than they are given credit for, would object to any of this; parents might be more effected.The message - touching on the standard themes of true love and courage - is more convincing than usual, possibly because so much of what Chihiro accomplishes really does result from her own courage, and is not handed to her on a silver platter by a fairy godmother. A minor scene where she sprints down the length of a rickety bridge is especially effective. The romance, also, is not the overly sanitized kind you usually find in fairy tales; the male lead, Hako, has a dark side, and seems like an actual being rather than an impossible abstract.Even those Americans who are hip enough to call Japanese animation 'anime' probably have a somewhat limited view of it. Most of these people (and I hope I don't offend anyone with this generalization) are male, between fourteen and thirty years of age, and addicted to stylized sex and violence (this is me). The anime which has been released in this country is generally targeted at them, and many of them seem to assume because of this that all anime is of that type. While I can't overstate by admiration for series like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Spirited Away is proof that the minds of contemporary Japan are capable of very different things. The most striking difference between this and other modern anime is in the character design - Chihiro is not particularly attractive. Hako tends more toward the classic bishounen, but many of the other characters are completley grotesque. This has always been Miyazaki's style, and makes the story much easier to believe.The only way in which I believe I could have enjoyed this film more is if I had been fifteen years or so younger when I saw it. It's the quintessential family film, and far from being a Japanese oddity, deserves to be the staple of a new generation of American youth.",5,Where was this when I was growing up?,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,3317,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'perfect', 'world', 'entire', 'board', 'directors', 'Disney', 'corporation', 'should', 'have', 'sunk', 'knees', 'committed', 'seppuku', 'what', 'innovation', 'spite', 'unrelenting', 'weirdness', 'sort', 'thing', 'kids', 'can', 'really', 'enjoy', 'think', 'not', 'being', 'kid', 'anymore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure.Spirited', 'Away', 'classic', 'fable', 'mixing', 'conventions', 'European', 'Russian', 'fairy', 'tales', 'elements', 'Japanese', 'folklore', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'young', 'girl', 'Chihiro', 'somewhat', 'bored', 'spoiled', 'begin', 'parents', 'curse', 'trapped', 'world', 'gods', 'spirits', 'self-transformative', 'journey', 'rarely', 'trite', 'dully', 'moralizing', 'What', 'many', 'similiar', 'animated', 'fables', 'sense', 'danger', 'generated', 'things', 'world', 'are', 'so', 'drastic', 'bizzare', 'actually', 'find', 'wondering', 'expected', 'happy', 'ending', 'will', 'result.The', 'grotesquery', 'film', 'extreme', 'guess', 'parents', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'most', 'striking', 'things', 'include', 'spirit', 'people', 'not', 'fatally', 'later', 'vomits', 'copiously', 'scene', 'male', 'lead', 'dragon', 'form', 'badly', 'wounded', 'bleeds', 'mouth', 'scene', 'actually', 'distrubed', 'giant', 'baby', 'break', 'Chihiro', 'arm', 'giant', 'baby', 'just', 'plain', 'creepy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'often', 'more', 'bloodthirsty', 'are', 'given', 'credit', 'would', 'object', 'parents', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'effected.The', 'message', 'touching', 'standard', 'themes', 'true', 'love', 'courage', 'more', 'convincing', 'usual', 'possibly', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Chihiro', 'really', 'result', 'own', 'courage', 'not', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'minor', 'scene', 'where', 'down', 'length', 'rickety', 'bridge', 'especially', 'effective', 'romance', 'also', 'not', 'overly', 'sanitized', 'kind', 'usually', 'find', 'fairy', 'tales', 'male', 'lead', 'Hako', 'dark', 'side', 'actual', 'being', 'rather', 'impossible', 'abstract.Even', 'Americans', 'who', 'are', 'hip', 'enough', 'call', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'probably', 'have', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'view', 'Most', 'people', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'generalization', 'are', 'male', 'fourteen', 'thirty', 'years', 'age', 'addicted', 'stylized', 'sex', 'violence', 'anime', 'been', 'released', 'country', 'generally', 'targeted', 'many', 'seem', 'assume', 'anime', 'type', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overstate', 'admiration', 'series', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'proof', 'minds', 'contemporary', 'Japan', 'are', 'capable', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'most', 'striking', 'difference', 'other', 'modern', 'anime', 'character', 'design', 'Chihiro', 'not', 'particularly', 'attractive', 'Hako', 'more', 'classic', 'bishounen', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'completley', 'grotesque', 'always', 'been', 'Miyazaki', 'style', 'story', 'much', 'easier', 'believe.The', 'only', 'way', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'fifteen', 'years', 'so', 'younger', 'when', 'saw', 'quintessential', 'family', 'film', 'far', 'being', 'Japanese', 'oddity', 'be', 'staple', 'new', 'generation', 'American', 'youth']",N/A

598570,A1C08KLFIHSJMZ,B00005JLET,Jason G.,"[6, 9]","Anime often remains a mysterious artform to many not familiar with it, often thinking that cartoons are merely for children. However, the Japanese have made anime for both adults and children, sometimes combined into one.While Spritied Away is a children's story at heart, adults will recognize the moral values and life lessons woven into the plot, as the narrative is both emotionally turbulent and ultimately triumphant in its progression. Imagery and symbolism is rampant througout, with the settings, characters and revelations often having deeper meaning than their initial apperances.The film starts out with a whiny girl named Chihiro moving to her new home with her parents. As they stop at what seems to be an abdandoned theme park, they are pleased to see that it appears to still be in operation. After Chihiro's parents pig out (literally) on the food set out for guests, the theme park's true nature is revealed and Chihiro is plunged into a world that only tbe brilliant mind of Miyasaki could produce.The theme park is actually a gateway into a Japanese bath house for the spirit world, and a mortal girl like Chihiro is not welcome. After being given a pity job by Zeniba, the witch over ruling the establishment, she seeks to earn her freedom back as well as rescue her parents from certain death in the pig pen.While adjusting to life at the bath house Chihiro meets a boy about her age who serves as Zeniba's personal assistant of sorts, though his true identity is ultimately what sets the both of them free.This film is visually stunning, combining both traditional animation with computer aided graphics. The DVD picture is both pristine and vivid; audio content is much of the same.

598571,A106016KSI0YQ,B00005JLET,Jay Dickson,"[4, 6]","The genius of this film is its utter narrative originality: while it seems indisputably like Japanese fairy tales (in its particulars of spiritual machinery) and may even remind you of Northern European fairy tales (in its setting and the tribulations the heroine must go through), it also seems like nothing else you've ever seen. Best of all, while its exceptionally intelligent and offers a profound allegory about class (in its heroine's need to work to survive, and the greedy system she works under), it never seems moralistic or preachy in the least. And nothing is never what it seems to be: eschewing the easy good and evil dualities of American cartoons, the characters the heroine encounters are complex and ambiguous in their morality. No one is a clear villain or hero, and someone who can give her her greatest aid at one minute can suddenly become a threat to her life.The young heroine, Chihiro, matures in the course of the film from a clingy and even irritatingly whining young girl to someone more mature and self-reliant, but her transformation is gradual and believable. When her parents are transformed into pigs by the magics of a mysterious recreational village for spirits that they stumble across, Chihiro must work from the literal bottom of a spooky and mysterious tower which functions as a bathing house for spirits and demons. The bathhouse tower is a kind of Gothic miracle, populated by all kinds of creatures that you've never seen before and remind you of nothing else (such as the enchanted furnace smudges required to carry inidivual coals). And the film is replete with great moments of beauty that the director, Miyazaki, is not afraid to linger on: a train gliding over a flooded empty landscape, or seagulls circling far below the heroine's feet (yet over a beautiful blue sea) as she climbs to the top of the mysterious tower.

It is an even rarer work that speaks to both children and adults.  In my personal opinion, the American public does not demand quality from its artists--sure, there is the occasional serendipitous work that manages to find financing and an audience; however, in large part it takes an artist of great perserverance and no small amount of luck to reach the audience.Based on this work alone, Mr. Miyazaki's movies are on my instant purchase list.  Other reviews adequately treat a summary of the story and the various strengths of the work--I would like to just state that it is our responsibility to demand and support art of this magnificent quality.  This is art that affirms life and teaches that virtue is its own reward, that moderation and patience can conquer difficult problems and that sometimes we need to have terrible experiences in order to discover our inner strength.

I cannot recommend seeing it on the big screen enough, I will buy the DVD to be sure, but one must see the grand scope of this to appreciate it in full.  It is not so much what it is as what it is not.  It is not a pretentious ""adult cartoon"" relying on kinky sex and violence to pass itself off as highbrow entertainment.  It is not that bad ""anime"" (spelling)? that I would hope we would have seen the last of by now.  This is original, heartfelt, funny and simply dazzling to look at.  How rare is it these days to see a good story told in an interesting way that is coherent and funny as well as dead serious and never heavy handed or depressing?  There are so many ways Japanese animation can go wrong (at least to American audiences) and this film steers well clear of all of them.  A child's journey of self discovery, of learning timeless lessons about friendship and family, and it is never politicized, never used as an excuse to push some religious or sociological agenda.  Small children might be scared at parts of this, the pigs in particular were disturbing (I was more scared then any of the children in attendance, which is usually the case anyway) but they will be won over by the happy but never sappy ending.  How sad that so many films feel it is necessary to have a depressing and downbeat story to be taken seriously, how sad that so many small minded producers cannot see past short term profits and commercialization, how delightful and fortunate that someone still cares about art for arts sake and takes the effort and expense to bring this wonderful tale to the screen, like all great art this film enhances life, one cannot help but feel better after having seen this, you really owe it to yourself to spend two hours in this magic place where good can overcome evil and everyone can solve there problems the right way.

I don't think it's fair to keep calling it a Japanese version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; though. To be honest, I think this is much, much better than Alice in Wonderland, but also I think that the two movies just have too many differences between them--Spirited Away is more of an adventure movie grounded in certain rules of logic (even if those rules may be very silly). Anyway, read all the other rave reviews here if you want to know how great this move is. Pure magic, great fun for any age, a good movie that you can watch and lose yourself inside.I'm writing this review as a warning to parents. Although this movie is sure to be enjoyed by children, there are several scenes that you may want to approach with caution. Although much of the movie is beautiful, some of it is also very grotesque, including some scenes in which vomit and sludge spew forth in floods. While that might just be dismissed as childish gross-out stuff, there's another scene that could be very difficult for some children to handle.At one point, Sen wakes up and sees a dragon flying around, being chased by thousands of flying paper things. When she rescues it, she finds that the dragon is covered in (and coughing up) blood. Although there aren't any graphic, gory scenes of violence, there is a lot of blood splashed around on the walls. There are also several close-ups of the blood dripping out of the dragon's mouth. If you have very sensitive children, or if you just do not want them to see this, then be prepared for this scene (it lasts for several minutes, but once it is over there is no more blood).No matter whether or not you may view this as a &quot;child's&quot; movie, it is still an absolute treat.

I saw this movie when it was released to theaters here in the US, having seen the ads for it and knowing it was going to be good.It wasn't good, it was great! So many fables in the U.S. have been told to death that to see this movie was a literal breath of fresh air. It is such a wonderful new take on the old story of the hero being required to grow up and mature in order to ""get out"" of whatever situation he/she has been thrust into.Chihiro/Sen is someone that any young girl can relate to. While she starts off seeming bratty, it's not because she's really a brat. Her family has moved, something that's all too familiar to many young children, and what young girl wouldn't be angry at her parents after being yanked away from her friends without so much as a ""how do you feel about this""? She just wants to stay where she's comfortable and safe.From the outset, Chihiro is required to act in ways that would be difficult for anyone, never mind a young girl! How well would you react to the sight of a ""boiler keeper"" who looks like a cross between a man and a spider, with little puffs of soot scurrying about as his helpers? And in the same night, find yourself having to face down a foul-tempered witch to ensure you don't suffer the same fate as your parents?Every girl (and boy) has to learn to ""grow up"" -- to come to grips with the fact that the world can sometimes be a harsh place, and that you still have to live in it and do the best that you can; to learn to stand up for yourself with no one there to help you; to be responsible for what you (or those with you) do; to come to understand that other people besides yourself matter. Chihiro learns all of these things and more, and changes from a timid, somewhat self-absorbed person into one who has a deep inner strength and faith in herself and who cares deeply about the people she has come to know. This is a story that sends a powerful message, one that will stay with the people who watch it.I have a four year-old daughter, and I can't wait to show this DVD to her when she's a little older. Her younger sister will see it, too, when she's old enough.

Images and characters in his work are truly foreign and magical.  Spirited Away is perhaps the best example of this.  There is a No-Face character (a mostly fluid black shape with a mask) that has no characteristics that we can identify as human (as a contrast, Stich from ""Lilo and Stich"" is a space alien but isn't too far off from human emotions and motivations).  No-Face is an interesting, and occasionally frightening, character.The story follows Chihiro, a young girl whose family is just moving to a new city.  On the way to the house the father takes a shortcut.  The short cut is a dead end, but there is a pathway through some buildings.  The parents decide to investigate (over the objections of Chihiro).  After passing through a tunnel they come to what they believe is an abandoned amusement park....with the smells of cooking food.  Hungrily, the parents chase down the smell and see a large amount of food laid out on a countertop.  The parents sit down and eat, cajoling Chihiro to do the same.  She runs away, and is warned by Haku (a more important character later) to get out before nightfall.  She runs back to her parents but only see two large pigs gorging on food....right where her parents were.  She runs, frightened, but ends up not being able to get out.  She finds herself in a magical world where there are very few humans (who work nearly like slaves for a bath house).  Haku helps her get a job in the bath house, saving Chihiro from being turned to a pig like her parents.  The movie is her experience in the bathhouse and how she tries to rescue herself and her parents.This is a fantastic movie, and deservedly won the Best Animated Film Oscar at the Academy Awards.",4,outstanding,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2132,"['Considered', 'Miyazaki', 'masterpiece', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'one', 'better', 'animated', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'only', 'other', 'Miyazaki', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Castle', 'away', 'superior', 'film', 'Much', 'today', 'American', 'animation', 'grounded', 'reality', 'even', 'have', 'talking', 'lions', 'space', 'aliens', 'Nothing', 'feels', 'foreign', 'truly', 'magical', 'Miyazaki', 'truly', 'sense', 'fantastic', 'Images', 'characters', 'work', 'are', 'truly', 'foreign', 'magical', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'perhaps', 'best', 'example', 'No-Face', 'character', 'mostly', 'fluid', 'black', 'shape', 'mask', 'characteristics', 'can', 'identify', 'human', 'contrast', 'Stich', 'Lilo', 'Stich', 'space', 'alien', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'human', 'emotions', 'motivations', 'No-Face', 'interesting', 'occasionally', 'frightening', 'character.The', 'story', 'Chihiro', 'young', 'girl', 'family', 'just', 'moving', 'new', 'city', 'way', 'house', 'father', 'shortcut', 'short', 'cut', 'dead', 'end', 'pathway', 'buildings', 'parents', 'decide', 'investigate', 'objections', 'Chihiro', 'passing', 'tunnel', 'come', 'what', 'believe', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'smells', 'cooking', 'food', 'Hungrily', 'parents', 'chase', 'down', 'smell', 'see', 'large', 'amount', 'food', 'laid', 'out', 'countertop', 'parents', 'sit', 'down', 'eat', 'cajoling', 'Chihiro', 'do', 'same', 'away', 'warned', 'Haku', 'more', 'important', 'character', 'later', 'get', 'out', 'nightfall', 'back', 'parents', 'only', 'see', 'two', 'large', 'pigs', 'gorging', 'food', '.right', 'where', 'parents', 'were', 'frightened', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'get', 'out', 'magical', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'humans', 'who', 'work', 'nearly', 'like', 'slaves', 'bath', 'house', 'Haku', 'get', 'job', 'bath', 'house', 'saving', 'Chihiro', 'being', 'turned', 'pig', 'parents', 'movie', 'experience', 'bathhouse', 'how', 'rescue', 'parents.This', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'Academy', 'Awards']",N/A

There's certainly a lot of good stuff, unparalleled animation, and more unparalleled animation. But once you get past the novelty of the weirdness, the strange creatures, what do you have? Not much. There isn't really much of a plot here. C'mon, to those who talk about the symbolism or the deeper meaning, do you really think you know what goes on in Miyazaki's mind? The guy keeps getting pulled out of retirement, maybe in there is some statement that he just wants to stay retired.And to those who say Miyazaki is their 7 year old's favorite director, c'mon!

598587,AA3EC3LKOBD80,B00005JLET,Jonathan Cohen,"[0, 0]","""Spirited Away"", the first Japanese anime movie to win both an Oscar and other worldwide awards, is also one of the most unique and beautifully made animated movies you'll ever see.The acknowledged masterpiece of Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's most successful director (animated or live) ever, it's a novel fantasy about the unusual and spiritual journey of a tiny, shy girl.Miyazaki, who draws, writes and oversees every single detail of this and his other films, always creates a small but strong girl as his central character. Chihiro, withdrawn and poker-faced, has that role here, as she wanders away from her suburban parents when they discover a lavish buffet in what looks to be an abandoned temple. Within minutes, she's swept inside by a mysterious, master-type boy named Haku and discovers a wondrous but creepy bathhouse crawling with strange spiritual creatures- a place where humans are not welcome. Inside, she encounters everything from tiny moving ash particles with eyes toa truly repulsive sludge monster emerging from a dirty tub. Chihiro also has her name stolen by Yubaba, the weird, wacky sorceress who runs the place, and must be known as ""Sen"" until she meets one test after another, the better to eventually escape and become a girl again. It's this journey that the movie centers on- not unlike a Japanese take on ""Alice In Wonderland"".But it's also much more.Unlike the average American animated feature, ""Spirited Away"" runs two hours, yet it unfolds like origami. The few human characters are drawn and speak like real, frightened kids, yet with dignity as well. The unusual spirits, resembling everything from mutant kabuki to- of all things- ""Looney Tunes""' Michigan J. Frog, usually don't speak yet say as much, if not more, as those gabby scare-factory things from ""Monsters Inc."" Miyazaki doesn't believe in drowning the screen- or the audience- in rat-a-tat dialogue; instead, he draws simple, family-minded morals in a most appealing, visually stunning way. He also has a gifted composer-conductor, Joe Hisaishi, who backs the movie with both his own meditative piano solos and some exotic, Martin Denny-style orchestration. The visual, character, and musical elements all meld into an atmosphere that's both simple and sophisticated,uniquely Japanese yet welcoming to all.For this American release, Disney took special care to keep the entire movie untouched yet create an English soundtrack that fit in perfectly- not an easy thing to do when dubbing over Japanese-speaking mouths. Two bonus features show this process quite well, a tribute to the fine work of both the couple who translated the Miyazaki script into clear English and the gifted voice cast. The best of the latter are Daveigh Chase (from ""Lilo and Stitch""), the youngster who captures Chihiro with the heartfelt shyness she was drawn with, and Suzanne Pleshette, who gave Yubaba- and her ""good witch"" sister- a charming, gravelly cackle that does Margaret Hamilton proud.There's also a documentary from Nippon TV (in Japanese with subtitles) that follows Miyazaki- an avuncular, chain-smoking patriarch- and his team of animators, sound men, musicians and actors as they create ""Spirited Away"" from the director's original sketchbook to the screen. Even with no English, the process at Ghibli is as fascinating as the movie itself- old-school, hand-drawn animation all the way with a distinct flavor, a wonderful craft in this computer-driven age.If, like me, you're a serious animation buff, or if you're younger and like classic Disney or ""Harry Potter"" but aren't sure about anime, or even if you like ""Lord of the Rings"" but won't go near a ""cartoon"", you'll really like ""Spirited Away""- truly a product of the magical mind of Miyazaki.",5,FROM THE MAGICAL MIND OF MIYAZAKI...,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3739,"['Spirited', 'Away', 'first', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'movie', 'win', 'Oscar', 'other', 'worldwide', 'awards', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'beautifully', 'made', 'animated', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see.The', 'acknowledged', 'masterpiece', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Japan', 'most', 'successful', 'director', 'animated', 'live', 'ever', 'novel', 'fantasy', 'unusual', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'tiny', 'shy', 'girl.Miyazaki', 'who', 'writes', 'oversees', 'single', 'detail', 'other', 'films', 'always', 'small', 'strong', 'girl', 'central', 'character', 'Chihiro', 'withdrawn', 'poker-faced', 'role', 'here', 'away', 'suburban', 'parents', 'when', 'discover', 'lavish', 'buffet', 'what', 'be', 'abandoned', 'temple', 'Within', 'minutes', 'swept', 'inside', 'mysterious', 'master-type', 'boy', 'named', 'Haku', 'wondrous', 'creepy', 'bathhouse', 'crawling', 'strange', 'spiritual', 'creatures-', 'place', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'not', 'welcome', 'everything', 'tiny', 'moving', 'ash', 'particles', 'eyes', 'toa', 'truly', 'repulsive', 'sludge', 'monster', 'emerging', 'dirty', 'tub', 'Chihiro', 'also', 'name', 'stolen', 'Yubaba', 'weird', 'wacky', 'sorceress', 'who', 'place', 'must', 'be', 'known', 'Sen', 'one', 'test', 'better', 'eventually', 'escape', 'become', 'girl', 'again', 'journey', 'movie', 'centers', 'on-', 'not', 'Japanese', 'take', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'also', 'much', 'average', 'American', 'animated', 'feature', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'two', 'hours', 'origami', 'few', 'human', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'speak', 'real', 'frightened', 'kids', 'yet', 'dignity', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'spirits', 'resembling', 'everything', 'mutant', 'kabuki', 'to-', 'things-', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'Michigan', 'J.', 'Frog', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'yet', 'say', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'gabby', 'scare-factory', 'things', 'Monsters', 'Inc.', 'Miyazaki', ""n't"", 'believe', 'drowning', 'screen-', 'audience-', 'rat-a-tat', 'dialogue', 'instead', 'simple', 'family-minded', 'morals', 'most', 'appealing', 'visually', 'stunning', 'way', 'also', 'gifted', 'composer-conductor', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'who', 'movie', 'own', 'meditative', 'piano', 'solos', 'exotic', 'Martin', 'Denny-style', 'orchestration', 'visual', 'character', 'musical', 'elements', 'meld', 'atmosphere', 'simple', 'sophisticated', 'uniquely', 'Japanese', 'yet', 'welcoming', 'all.For', 'American', 'release', 'Disney', 'took', 'special', 'care', 'keep', 'entire', 'movie', 'untouched', 'yet', 'create', 'English', 'soundtrack', 'fit', 'perfectly-', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'do', 'when', 'dubbing', 'Japanese-speaking', 'mouths', 'Two', 'bonus', 'features', 'show', 'process', 'quite', 'well', 'tribute', 'fine', 'work', 'couple', 'who', 'translated', 'Miyazaki', 'script', 'clear', 'English', 'gifted', 'voice', 'cast', 'best', 'latter', 'are', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'youngster', 'who', 'Chihiro', 'heartfelt', 'shyness', 'was', 'drawn', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'who', 'gave', 'Yubaba-', 'good', 'witch', 'sister-', 'charming', 'gravelly', 'Margaret', 'Hamilton', 'proud.There', 'also', 'documentary', 'Nippon', 'TV', 'Japanese', 'subtitles', 'Miyazaki-', 'avuncular', 'chain-smoking', 'patriarch-', 'team', 'animators', 'sound', 'men', 'musicians', 'actors', 'create', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'director', 'original', 'sketchbook', 'screen', 'Even', 'English', 'process', 'Ghibli', 'as', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'itself-', 'old-school', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'way', 'distinct', 'flavor', 'wonderful', 'craft', 'computer-driven', 'age.If', ""'re"", 'serious', 'animation', 'buff', ""'re"", 'younger', 'classic', 'Disney', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'anime', 'even', 'like', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'cartoon', ""'ll"", 'really', 'like', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'truly', 'product', 'magical', 'mind', 'Miyazaki']",N/A

598590,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00005JLET,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[0, 0]","This overwhelmingly gorgeous animated feature from Hayao Miyazaki begins when an unhappy young girl, Chihiro, is moving with her parents to a new town.  Along the way, the family is drawn to a mysterious tunnel which leads to an exotic new world.  Spotting delicious-looking food on the table of an old restaurant, Chihiro's parents gobble it down gluttonously--and are transformed into squealing pigs.  A distraught Chihiro discovers that this new world is actually a haven for spirits and creatures and panics.  Then an enigmatic youth, Haku, informs her that she must take a job at the central bath house in order to break the curse on her parents.  But the bath house's greedy enchantress, the cackling witch Yubaba, isn't going to make things easy for her.  Fortunately, with the help of a spider-like boiler man, Kamaji, and a tough, yet secretly softhearted maiden named Lin, Chihiro might find the key to save her parents from becoming bacon.What is truly unique about SPIRITED AWAY is its acquisition of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2002.  It was a triumph that no one could have anticipated.  Hayao Miyazaki's films have been well-known for many years in Japan and by a small underground band of fans, but up until that time, not one animated feature made in Japan has achieved such an honorary award.  It's a wonder, too, because the film, despite receiving enthusiastic reviews from almost every critic across the board, was only playing in select theaters.  Yet acclaim was so strong that its success took everyone (including Disney, who nonetheless translated and released SPIRITED AWAY theatrically) by surprise.  Consequently, America is now receiving more exposure to Miyazaki's works through brand-new, professional translations from Disney.  If it weren't for SPIRITED AWAY's success, these films (owned by Disney for several years) probably never would have seen the light of day in America.That said, I feel that SPIRITED AWAY gets more ballyhooing and hype than it really deserves.  Don't get me wrong, I like the film and it certainly deserves the Oscar it won (not to mention my highest rating), but SPIRITED AWAY is NOT the ""mother of all Japanese animation"", nor is it the ""only Miyazaki movie worth watching.""  The reason I say this is because Miyazaki has made so many other wonderful movies in his lifetime that I feel it is unfair to single out one of his works as a standard for all animation.  Especially when there are other animated features which are every bit as worthy of the ""masterpiece"" status.Personal gripes aside, SPIRITED AWAY is worth watching for many reasons.  The animated atmosphere that Miyazaki creates literally springs to life with imagination and beauty--watching this movie is almost like watching Japanese art paintings moving.  The spirits who inhabit the world are a bizarre, yet appealing bunch--including a shadowy, white-masked specter called No Face, who reacts to how people treat him.  In addition to which there are lots of bravura sequences which really showcase how beautiful hand-drawn animation can be--my favorite of which is a surreal train journey across a pond of water.If Chihiro is sometimes a bit too whiney, then her supporting cast of co-stars provide for some interesting character development.  Haku, for example, appears to be calm and kind for the most part, but we soon learn that this is only one facet of his character--yet Chihiro seems to believe, no matter what anyone tells her, that Haku is indeed a good soul.  Likewise, Lin acts gruff and somewhat mean to Chihiro when they first meet, but she eventually comes to look after Chihiro like a parent.  Interestingly, while Yubaba may be greedy and selfish, she's not a one-dimensional villainess; one senses that she secretly admires Chihiro's determination yet won't admit it to herself.  Her twin sister, Zeniba, is the total opposite; she lives a simple, pleasant life in a humble cottage yet is totally content with her way of living--although it is hard to tell that at first because she initially appears vowing vengeance on Haku.  Characters as interesting as this has always been a trait of Miyazaki's productions, and arguably what ultimately gives SPIRITED AWAY its heart rather than its jawdroppingly gorgeous visuals... although the film's occasional shades of symbolism are a definite plus as well.It is also interesting to note that for the English language production of the movie, PIXAR guru John Lasseter oversaw the casting of the voices and the scripting.  His efforts, as well as director Kirk Wise and script writers Cindy and Donald Hewitt, are very commendable and pay off handsomely.  Of the voices Suzanne Pleshette stands out above the rest with her bang-on performance as Yubaba and Zeniba, and is well supported by Susan Egan (Lin), Jason Marsden (Haku), and David Ogden Stiers (Kamaji).However, I have two issues with the dub--the first of which is Daveigh Chase's voicing of the lead, Chihiro.  While she does an absolutely excellent job with her acting, her sometimes shrill screeching is a bit off-putting.  The second of these issues is another personal gripe; some folks act as though this is the only dub of the Disney-Ghibli English tracks that is worth watching and that the rest are inferior.  This is unjust; each of the Disney-Ghibli dubs have been special and different in their own way and to single one out over any of them just doesn't make sense.  As such, SPIRITED AWAY is not the ultimate Disney-Ghibli dub; it's yet another top-class dub.Disney's DVD release presents the movie in a stunning transfer as well as the English and Japanese audio tracks in 5.1 Surround Sound.  And, for a change, there are more extras; although one of them is tedious (an intro with John Lasseter), the others, (especially the Nippon TV special), are fabulous.All in all, while sometimes overhyped to an extreme these days, SPIRITED AWAY nonetheless qualifies as yet another Miyazaki treat.",5,"Overrated, yet undeniably amazing artistic achievement from Miyazaki.",1047168000,"03 9,

Of course it reminds a viewer of his earlier movies, like Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.  Amazing creatures appear and surprising scenarios arise throughout the movie, as we watch Chihiro evolve from a weak, spoiled brat into a strong, determined young girl, intent on saving herself and her family.The movie simply looks beautiful.

His movies are always a delicate mix of fascinating artistry including colors, scenery and characters. The story in itself is amazing. It's a little Bizarre but seeing that this is based off of a Japanese book, some of the story gets lost in translation. In my opinion, it just means that its great to watch again and again. The voice cast in all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch, which helps give the characters that extra something making them all the more likable. All I can say is, this movie is absolutely amazing. It's freaky, it's funny, it's bizarre but beautiful. Even if you don't like Anime per say, whether its the look, the stereo types or whatever, don't judge a book by its cover - same goes for these movies. For one thing, they are backed by Disney, so they have to be quality - but these aren't your standard Disney Flicks. They are also highly praised by the producers at Pixar Studio's. Why? Because as said many times already, they are amazing - this movie in particular is a crown jewel. I won't go into the the story in this review, it's solely to let you know that this, and all of Miyazaki's movies are top notch and are just as memorable, incredible, and humorous for adults (if not more) than kids.

598608,A356TJCTCLDN89,B00005JLET,Kimberley Wilson,"[1, 5]","The first rule of watching this movie is simple: Just because something is animated it doesn't mean it's always for kids. Spirited Away is best for adults and older teens. Little ones will be disturbed. The best way to describe is that it's sort of like Wizard of OZ without music and set in fantasy Japan with ugly monsters.Instead of just getting home to Kansas the heroine has to save her parents and then make it back to the world of humans.  Except for one moment of stupidity and greed that gets the show started there is nothing interesting about the parents. This is a pretty good idea because their blandness is a huge contrast from the spirit world that Sen must go to to save them.Sen is a spunky kid with a kind heart. She's brave, resourceful and eventually wins over the cranky employees of the spirit world bathhouse. The bathhouse is a vacation spot for some incredible creatures. The huge radish spirit, silent and semi nude but wearing a juanty hat, was a standout. I've never liked raishes and now I definitely don't want any.  Most of the creatures are grotesque. I mean really disgusting, really creepy and that's one reason why the little kids should be put to bed before you watch the movie. There's also a great deal of chunky  vomit all over the place.The villianess witch is fantastic. She's cruel, funny and ugly. She's that nasty teacher who made your fifth grade absolute hell. She's that spiteful old biddy down the street who used to threaten to call the police if you walked to close to her lawn. She's that babysitter who didn't let you watch TV and sent you to your room until your parents came back. In short, she's a classic childhood fear figure. The witch does have one virtue. She loves her giant baby and that will be a huge help to Sen and her quest.I liked Spirited Away but I did think it's way too long and the ending where Sen FINALLY leaves with her boring and ungrateful parents (because they have no memory of ever being pigs under a spell) is an emotional let down.",4,interesting,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,2014,"['first', 'rule', 'watching', 'movie', 'simple', 'Just', 'something', 'animated', ""n't"", 'mean', 'always', 'kids', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'best', 'adults', 'older', 'teens', 'Little', 'ones', 'will', 'be', 'disturbed', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'sort', 'like', 'Wizard', 'OZ', 'music', 'set', 'fantasy', 'Japan', 'ugly', 'monsters.Instead', 'just', 'getting', 'home', 'Kansas', 'heroine', 'save', 'parents', 'then', 'make', 'back', 'world', 'humans', 'one', 'moment', 'stupidity', 'greed', 'show', 'started', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'parents', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'blandness', 'huge', 'contrast', 'spirit', 'world', 'Sen', 'must', 'go', 'save', 'them.Sen', 'spunky', 'kid', 'kind', 'heart', 'brave', 'resourceful', 'eventually', 'cranky', 'employees', 'spirit', 'world', 'bathhouse', 'bathhouse', 'vacation', 'spot', 'incredible', 'creatures', 'huge', 'radish', 'spirit', 'silent', 'semi', 'nude', 'wearing', 'juanty', 'hat', 'was', 'standout', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'raishes', 'now', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Most', 'creatures', 'are', 'grotesque', 'mean', 'really', 'disgusting', 'really', 'creepy', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'little', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'bed', 'watch', 'movie', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'chunky', 'vomit', 'place.The', 'villianess', 'witch', 'fantastic', 'cruel', 'funny', 'ugly', 'nasty', 'teacher', 'who', 'made', 'fifth', 'grade', 'absolute', 'hell', 'spiteful', 'old', 'biddy', 'street', 'who', 'used', 'threaten', 'call', 'police', 'walked', 'close', 'lawn', 'babysitter', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'watch', 'TV', 'sent', 'room', 'parents', 'came', 'back', 'short', 'classic', 'childhood', 'fear', 'figure', 'witch', 'have', 'one', 'virtue', 'giant', 'baby', 'will', 'be', 'huge', 'help', 'Sen', 'quest.I', 'liked', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'did', 'think', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'ending', 'where', 'Sen', 'FINALLY', 'boring', 'ungrateful', 'parents', 'have', 'memory', 'ever', 'being', 'pigs', 'spell', 'emotional', 'let', 'down']",N/A

After winning an Academy Award, the movie enjoyed a re-run. I hadn't heard much about it, other than the occasional television ad, where even the briefest snippet of the film convinced me this was something I had to see.Sitting in the theater, I felt like a child. The animation is superlative. Every bit of color and texture jumps out at one. The care which which this film was made is absolutely astounding!Miyazaki's dream-like story follows a young girl, Chihiro, moving to a new town with her parents. Her father, on the way to their new home, mis-directs them, and the family finds themselves at a failed amusement park, where the parents decide to explore, much to Chihiro's dismay.After wandering a bit, the parents find a food stall filled to overflowing with freshly cooked delicacies. They tuck in immediately, but Chihiro won't have anything to do with it. As the sun sets, a startling thing happens, and Chihiro finds herself in a world populated by spirits. She alone can save her parents and return them - along with herself - to the world she is used to.Miyazaki's movies tend to have a dream-like quality to them, with the possible exception of ""Princess Mononoke"" (at least, the Miyazaki films I have seen so far). ""Spirited Away"" is definitely no exception, being the most dream-like of them all. While all the occurrences in the story don't always make sense in an everyday sort of way, Chihiro's experiences in the spirit world are easy enough to relate to.There is just so much going on in this film: Chihiro's sense of loneliness, the unpredictable nature of the spirits she meets, the different laws that apply to the spirit world. ""Spirited Away"" is an assault on the senses from start to finish.I highly recommend watching the film both in the dubbed English and then in the subtitled Japanese. The differences that the characters' tone of voice convey are delightful. This is most notable in the character of Yubaba, voiced beautifully in the English by Suzanne Pleshette (and by Nina Hagen in the German version....her daughter, Cosma Shiva, plays Lin, Chihiro's boss at the bathhouse).A must see for all fans of Miyazaki's work.",5,Miyazaki's Masterpiece,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2249,"['Spirited', 'Away', 'only', 'Miyazaki', 'film', ""'ve"", 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'see', 'theaters', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 're-run', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'much', 'other', 'occasional', 'television', 'ad', 'where', 'even', 'briefest', 'snippet', 'film', 'convinced', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'see.Sitting', 'theater', 'felt', 'child', 'animation', 'superlative', 'bit', 'color', 'texture', 'out', 'one', 'care', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'absolutely', 'astounding', 'Miyazaki', 'dream-like', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Chihiro', 'moving', 'new', 'town', 'parents', 'father', 'way', 'new', 'home', 'mis-directs', 'family', 'failed', 'amusement', 'park', 'where', 'parents', 'decide', 'explore', 'much', 'Chihiro', 'dismay.After', 'wandering', 'bit', 'parents', 'find', 'food', 'stall', 'filled', 'overflowing', 'freshly', 'cooked', 'delicacies', 'tuck', 'immediately', 'Chihiro', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'sun', 'sets', 'startling', 'thing', 'happens', 'Chihiro', 'world', 'populated', 'spirits', 'alone', 'can', 'save', 'parents', 'return', 'world', 'used', 'to.Miyazaki', 'movies', 'tend', 'have', 'dream-like', 'quality', 'possible', 'exception', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'least', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'definitely', 'exception', 'being', 'most', 'dream-like', 'occurrences', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'everyday', 'sort', 'way', 'Chihiro', 'experiences', 'spirit', 'world', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'relate', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'Chihiro', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'spirits', 'different', 'laws', 'apply', 'spirit', 'world', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'assault', 'senses', 'start', 'finish.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'dubbed', 'English', 'then', 'subtitled', 'Japanese', 'differences', 'characters', 'tone', 'voice', 'convey', 'are', 'delightful', 'most', 'notable', 'character', 'Yubaba', 'voiced', 'beautifully', 'English', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'Nina', 'Hagen', 'German', 'version', '.her', 'daughter', 'Cosma', 'Shiva', 'Lin', 'Chihiro', 'boss', 'bathhouse', '.A', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'Miyazaki', 'work']",N/A

The literary reference is intended to emphasize the overwhelming creativity of creator Hayao Miyazaki (""Princess Mononoke,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky"") and is not to suggest that this film is some sort of Japanese allegory of Lewis Carroll's surreal children's classic (not to say that you cannot find some intriguing parralels between the two). What I am and everybody else who makes this comparison is trying to convey to you is that the world to which 10-year-old Chirho (voiced by Rumi Hiiragi & Daveigh Chase) is as much a wonderland as what confronted Alice down the rabbit hole, even if it is just a bathhouse in this case.The story begins with a sullen Chirho moping about in the back of the family car as her parents take her to their new home in a new city. Then her father takes a fateful wrong turn and they discover what appears to be an abandoned theme park. But then her parents discover mountains of food, which they start greedily consuming. As Chirho explores the park things start to change and the spirits start to come out. Before she knows what has happened, her parents have been changed into pigs and Chirho finds herself in the land of the spirits. Her quest to rescue her parents and find her way home has begun.""Spirited Away"" is not as rich of a visual feast as some classic examples of anime such as ""Akira"" and ""Metropolis,"" in part because Miyazaki disdains resorting to computer animation in favor of traditional animated cels. Even if there is not the overwhelming visual display of these other films there is still the attention to detail. But ultimately the reason why this is the biggest money making film in the history of Japan is because of the story, which has almost as much emotional impact on the audience as ""Grave of the Fireflies"" (that is a mondo compliment from my perspective because ""Grave"" is the one anime that I decided to own and not just rent, although I did buy a copy of ""Spirited Away"" for my daughter, so I can borrow it when I want). Consequently, it is not surprising that this film took over the top spot in Japanese history from ""Titanic,"" because they both combine emotional stories with compelling visuals. I waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD (What? An anime film come to the Zenith City? Are you joking?), and it was every bit as good as I could have ever hoped.The Japanese title ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" literally translates as ""The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro,"" which will make only partial sense to you after you see the film. I was not surprised that this film was nominated for an Oscar as the Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, but I was surprised, and gratified, that it won. I have been wondering what the current state of animated art would be in the world today if they had started giving this particular Oscar out a decade earlier and anime like ""Akira,"" ""Metropolis,"" and ""Grave of the Fireflies"" were receiving wider attention if not flat out winning the award. ""Spirited Away"" is just the latest opportunity to open the door to the wonders of anime for an even wider audience.",5,Miyazaki's Oscar winning anime is every bit as wonderful as we heard that it was,1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,3243,"['say', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'very', 'true', 'extremely', 'simplistic', 'literary', 'reference', 'intended', 'emphasize', 'overwhelming', 'creativity', 'creator', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'sort', 'Japanese', 'allegory', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'surreal', 'children', 'classic', 'not', 'say', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'intriguing', 'parralels', 'two', 'What', 'am', 'everybody', 'else', 'who', 'comparison', 'trying', 'convey', 'world', '10-year-old', 'Chirho', 'voiced', 'Rumi', 'Hiiragi', 'Daveigh', 'Chase', 'as', 'much', 'wonderland', 'what', 'confronted', 'Alice', 'rabbit', 'hole', 'even', 'just', 'bathhouse', 'case.The', 'story', 'sullen', 'Chirho', 'moping', 'about', 'back', 'family', 'car', 'parents', 'take', 'new', 'home', 'new', 'city', 'Then', 'father', 'fateful', 'wrong', 'turn', 'discover', 'what', 'be', 'abandoned', 'theme', 'park', 'then', 'parents', 'discover', 'mountains', 'food', 'start', 'greedily', 'consuming', 'Chirho', 'park', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'spirits', 'start', 'come', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'pigs', 'Chirho', 'land', 'spirits', 'quest', 'rescue', 'parents', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'begun', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'not', 'rich', 'visual', 'feast', 'classic', 'examples', 'anime', 'such', 'Akira', 'Metropolis', 'part', 'Miyazaki', 'resorting', 'computer', 'animation', 'favor', 'traditional', 'animated', 'cels', 'Even', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'visual', 'display', 'other', 'films', 'still', 'attention', 'detail', 'ultimately', 'reason', 'why', 'biggest', 'money', 'making', 'film', 'history', 'Japan', 'story', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'emotional', 'impact', 'audience', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'mondo', 'compliment', 'perspective', 'Grave', 'one', 'anime', 'decided', 'own', 'not', 'just', 'rent', 'did', 'buy', 'copy', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'daughter', 'can', 'borrow', 'when', 'want', 'Consequently', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'took', 'over', 'top', 'spot', 'Japanese', 'history', 'Titanic', 'combine', 'emotional', 'stories', 'compelling', 'visuals', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'What', 'anime', 'film', 'come', 'Zenith', 'City', 'Are', 'joking', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'hoped.The', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Sen', 'Chihiro', 'kamikakushi', 'literally', 'Spiriting', 'Away', 'Sen', 'Chihiro', 'will', 'make', 'only', 'partial', 'sense', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'Film', 'Year', 'was', 'surprised', 'gratified', 'won', 'have', 'been', 'wondering', 'what', 'current', 'state', 'animated', 'art', 'would', 'be', 'world', 'today', 'had', 'started', 'giving', 'particular', 'Oscar', 'out', 'decade', 'earlier', 'anime', 'Akira', 'Metropolis', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'were', 'receiving', 'wider', 'attention', 'not', 'flat', 'winning', 'award', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'just', 'latest', 'opportunity', 'open', 'door', 'wonders', 'anime', 'even', 'wider', 'audience']",N/A

598619,A2K97HCY2OLW61,B00005JLET,Lee Buchenau,"[2, 3]","Spirited Away is another great Miyazaki film and has brought his name and his art to attention of the world. Disney's DVD release of the picture is an all around excellent DVD with some insightful extras.Personally I don't find Spirited Away to be the top of Miyazaki's game. I found Laputa, Nausicaa, Mononoke, and Kiki to be better works. Had Spirited Away been created by another artist I would have hailed higher, but Miyazaki has such a stunning catalogue that comparisons have to be made. The reason for my lower opinion of Spirited Away is the way Miyazaki's absolutely breathtaking and stunning imagination tends to overwhelm the narrative. Spirited Away is a masterpiece in visual design and is a truly one of a kind fantasy world, but the story didn't captivate me as much as other Miyazaki pictures. The grand narratives of Mononoke, Laputa, and Nausicaa dwarf Spirited Away while still thriving in the visual department. The simpler films: Kiki and Totoro captivated me more sucessfully on an emotional level then Spirited Away. Still the film is amazing, a wonder of animation, although I was a little bothered with a few uses of digital work for motion. Integration is still sketchy at this stage, but not as bad as in live action films. The movie is a marvel, but younger children might find some scenes a little disturbing. The dragon bleds alot leaving some heavy blood smears and the No Face eats some people and grossly vomits out brown liquid. When I saw it in the theater several young children started to cry and even as a college student found the scenes pretty intense for real young ones.Picture quality is excellent. A great tranfer that highlights Miyazaki's amazing animation. Colors didn't seem as bright as the Kiki DVD, but still a flawless print with stunning sharpness and color. Image is nn 2:0:1 to perserve aspect ratio and good for small tvs. Sound is excellent, the Japanese and English tracks are in 5.1. I only have stereo speakers so I can't say much on that. The English track is fine, but always go for the Japanese, although the ending song is in Japanese on both tracks. Making up for the problems on Kiki and Castle is an on the fly audio/subtitle change option. There is French too. Subtitles are yellow and in frame, good for 16x9 tvs, bad for small tvs because it covers up more of the image.Extras have the standard Lasseter intro, which starts if you change to Japanese and ""resume film"" even if you don't want it to play. The English production is documented in ""Art of Spirited Away"". It is a good documentary on the English production, shades of Disney specials. Worth watching for the explanation of the finger chop that Chihiro is given. The behind the microphone section is not interesting. The Japanese Trailers run back to back and give away most of the story. The highlight of the extras is the fabulous Nippon Special on the film. This Japanese documentary gives Miyazaki fans a dream come true, an indepth look at Miyazaki's creative process. We are actually taken into the studio for over half and hour to watch step by step how Miyazaki's team created Spirited Away. From planning to intensive drawing sessions, to recording voices and sound, to the story behind the stunning closing song, the documentary is a wonder. Anyone interested in the process of animation will be amazed at the limited resources Miyazaki has in comparison to American animators. The recording room is a converted movie theater without a soundproof window, so a laugh from a crew member will spoil a take. Miyazaki own dedication and involvement with every detail is made extremely clear with his late night working binges and supervision of everything. We even see him cook dinner for the team. The most fascinating aspect comes in the planning stage where Miyazaki can on the drop of a hat explain the every detail of a single real life movement or action that he wants in the film. Miyazaki is shocked when he discovers his team hasn't seen lizards fall from trees and haven't held open the jaws of a dog. He sighed and laments on the end of Japanese culture. The documentary is a true wonder and an absolute must for any Miyazaki fan. The second disc is the storyboard of the film with complete language tracks. It has what Castle in the Sky and Kiki didn't, an angle switch option with the animated film making it worth something.Spirited Away is a great animated film a stunning work of imagination and fantasy, but by my taste not Miyazaki's best. Disney's DVD release has the stunning picture and sound of all its Miyazaki release and fixes the angle switch and on the fly audio/subtitle problems in previous the dvds. The extras are amazing with a good English documentary and a fascinating and one of a kind Japanese documentary that takes you into Studio Ghibli to showcase Miyazaki's production process.The film I'd

His movies are much better than any other Disney counterpart that i have seen including Mulan. There is something about Spirited Away that goes beyond the norm when it comes to animation. It has a human aspect that you can relate to by seeing the reaction in the character faces and you know its not forced or contrived. Its feel so genuine that one cannot describe but enjoyed even long after one has seen it...myself included and i am a tough critic.

A young girl begins the story afraid of her own shadow, cranky, timid and clingy. The family is moving to a new town and Chihiro doesn't like any of it. Her mother is clearly tired of this behavior and her father tries to push her into being stronger.Then, just as the girl feared, something went wrong. A little trip into a strange area suddenly has her parents turned into pigs, herself trapped in a servant's contract, and no sign of escape. She's put to hard work and sees no way of escaping. It's the opposite of the Wizard of Oz - instead of a gorgeous world where she has friends, she's a scullery maid with people snarling at every turn. And like in Pinocchio, it was their own boorish behavior that had the parents turn into farm animals.But slowly Chihiro realizes that things aren't as bad as she first though, once she gives it a fair try. Her fellow maids are actually quite friendly and helpful. The bathhouse in which she works appreciates the things she's able to do. The creatures and monsters that inhabit her new world, once quite fearsome to her, are now friends.Most especially, Chihiro is taken care of by a boy, Haku, who both works for the witch overlord of the bathhouse and also seems quite familiar to Chihiro. As the story moves along, Chihiro matures quite a bit, of course. The whole story is about her growing and learning and discovering her strengths. Her friends band together to help her out, and the requisite happy ending results.I understand why this is the highest grossing movie in Japanese history, and also why it was nominated for an Academy award. The general tale is one all people can relate to - the difficulties of change when you're a child, the wonder and strength that comes from realizing you can overcome those difficulties. The characters all have dimension - there aren't &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;. Characters start out harsh and annoying, but you get to like them when you get to know them. Even the 'mean' characters have understandable reasons for being that way.And yet, despite being an avid student of the Japanese culture and understanding a lot of the underlying themes, the movie just wasn't quite &quot;finished&quot;. Themes were started and not completed. Things mentioned with importance are later forgotten. There are characters that she meets for 5 minutes and is petrified of, and others that she knows for 8 minutes and is crying when she leaves them. Her roller-coaster emotions are inconsistant, even as she is maturing.The same is seen in the animation. There were many sequences in the animation where it became jerky and rough. Yes, some scenes (the entrance to the boss' office for one) obviously were labors of love, with exquisite detail. But there were other scenes that should have been breathtaking - the dragon flying near the end, for example - that looked clumsy. And then only a few moments later, the two faces as they fell were again extremely well done. It's as if someone chose key parts that had to stand out, and really worked on those - but left the other scenes to middlemen. When I hold the animation of Spirited Away up to many of my other favorite animated classics, I'm afraid that Spirited Away just isn't as consistant or smooth across the film.Also, with the theme being so timeless, I'm afraid that much of the movie was incredibly predictable. Even one of the key secrets wasn't much of a great moment when it was revealed, because there was no 'story meaning' to it. I won't give away the ending section, but while much of the middle of the movie sung with innovations and interesting, fascinating twists, at the end it dissoved back down into just about every other coming-of-age story written, and some extremely tired cliches finish the movie off. I truly felt let down.It sort of indicates the general tone of the movie when my favorite scene here doesn't hold a candle to my favorite scenes in other animated classics, either from a drawing, a plot, or a character point of view. It was simply funny. It was the soot-dust scene, where Chihiro has first entered the scary bathhouse. She sees a poor little soot-dust creature struggling to carry a lump of coal, and it gets crushed by the coal. Aghast, she tries to help out the creature by lifting its coal lump and then carries the coal herself to the furnace.The other soot creatures all crowd around her and it almost appears they're thanking her for saving their friend. One of the soot creatures lifts his own lump above his head ... and then THUMP, he drops it on himself, wiggling his little arms and legs and shrieking for help.

Whether you are an anime/animated film fan or not, this film will stir parts of your heart you thought were long jaded.  It is enchanting and enthralling.  There are important lessons about love, courage, and respect for nature, for people of any age.  Chihiro, a typical ten year-old girl, is riding with her parents to their new home.  She is pouting in the backseat.  The parents are sidetracked and the family gets lost in the spirit world.  Her parents are turned into swine.  Chihiro must find a way to set her parents free from the spell.Spirited Away made more money than the Titanic in Japan.  That goes to show how Japanese people were moved by this tribute to their culture. I saw this film twice with a Japanese friend, once with subtitles, once in English.  The dubbed version is just as good as the subtitled one.There are certain aspects of Japanese culture one should know in order to fully appreciate this movie.  The bathhouse Chihiro is employed in is for the kami, or gods, to rest and rejuvenate in.  Bathing is an important part of Japanese culture, much more than it is in the U.S.  Japanese Shinto beliefs believe there is a spirit in everything in nature.  So trooping into the bathhouse and relaxing in the hot tubs are all kinds of spirits: chick kami, radish kami, and many more I couldn't make out.  Spirited Away seeks to point out that though Japan is an ultra-modern culture, it is also ancient, with deep roots in the spiritual world that although Japanese may forget, the spirits remember you.  Anyone from any culture can relate to this movie.  Unfortunately, disrespect of nature is present in all cultures of the Western world.But, as this film shows, nature has a way of finding YOU.",5,Spirited Away recaptures lost magic of childhood,1085443200,"05 25, 2004",2004,1834,"['film', 'second', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazake', 'truly', 'reached', 'zenith', 'classic', 'are', 'anime/animated', 'film', 'fan', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'stir', 'parts', 'heart', 'thought', 'were', 'long', 'jaded', 'enchanting', 'enthralling', 'are', 'important', 'lessons', 'love', 'courage', 'respect', 'nature', 'people', 'age', 'Chihiro', 'typical', 'ten', 'year-old', 'girl', 'riding', 'parents', 'new', 'home', 'pouting', 'backseat', 'parents', 'are', 'sidetracked', 'family', 'lost', 'spirit', 'world', 'parents', 'are', 'turned', 'swine', 'Chihiro', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'set', 'parents', 'free', 'spell.Spirited', 'Away', 'made', 'more', 'money', 'Titanic', 'Japan', 'show', 'how', 'Japanese', 'people', 'were', 'moved', 'tribute', 'culture', 'saw', 'film', 'twice', 'Japanese', 'friend', 'once', 'subtitles', 'once', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'subtitled', 'are', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'one', 'should', 'know', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'bathhouse', 'Chihiro', 'employed', 'kami', 'gods', 'rest', 'rejuvenate', 'Bathing', 'important', 'part', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'much', 'more', 'U.S.', 'Japanese', 'Shinto', 'beliefs', 'believe', 'spirit', 'everything', 'nature', 'So', 'trooping', 'bathhouse', 'relaxing', 'hot', 'tubs', 'are', 'kinds', 'spirits', 'chick', 'kami', 'radish', 'kami', 'many', 'more', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'point', 'out', 'Japan', 'ultra-modern', 'culture', 'also', 'ancient', 'deep', 'roots', 'spiritual', 'world', 'Japanese', 'may', 'forget', 'spirits', 'remember', 'Anyone', 'culture', 'can', 'relate', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'disrespect', 'nature', 'present', 'cultures', 'Western', 'world.But', 'film', 'nature', 'way', 'finding', 'YOU']",N/A

Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 2]","When you allow your imagination free reign the creation that comes from it can be startling and so bizarre that it takes time for your brain to realign itself to the created reality.  ""Spirited Away"" is a fantastic vision of a world close to ours, and yet invisible to our eye, reached only by a portal lost and forgotten.  Spirits served by a host of creatures, including witches, all out to make a living, inhabit this world.  This world has its own set of rules and past, with sufficient familiarity with our world that you are not completely lost.Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new home.  As with many children her age, Chihiro is not especially happy to be moving away from her friends and the home she has always known.  When her father takes a wrong turn and encounters a mysterious building in the deep woods, Chihiro is immediately afraid and tries to warn her parents that they should turn around.  Her father and mother press on through the building, believing they have entered an abandoned theme park.  When they enter an area filled with restaurants and discover no one around, they pig out to the point where they pork out.As night falls, Chihiro discovers that she is trapped in this world.  The intervention of Haku saves her life and enables her to survive in this new world.  As Chihiro befriends those she encounters a number of characters in this world come to love and help her in her goal of turning her parents back to people and escaping back to the world she knows.The world Hiyao Miyazaki has created is a fantastic alternate reality.  There are demons that eat beings whole.  There are bizarre spirit creatures whose purpose can not be guessed, and yet intuitively you have some vague idea of what that purpose might be.  There are talking frogs and a giant baby.  There are bouncing heads with minimal intelligence.  There is an incredible, beautiful and fragile dragon.  There is a pair of witches, sisters, whose motivations are typically difficult to understand.The vision of this movie ranks with the best animation I have ever seen.

598631,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00005JLET,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[3, 5]","Historically I've had a bit of a hard time digesting Japanese anime movies. At times I can't quite make what it is they're trying to convey, with a whole mithology and a world of its own that I have a hard time relating with. Therefore, though I'd only heard great things said about &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (and read about the many awards it had won) I was still worried that it'd have that I-don't-know-what that had characterized most animes I'd seen.I was gladly surprised, and fortunately I was wrong. With its exquisite art direction and brilliant storyline, this animated movie falls in a category somewhere between &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The similarity to &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; is because of the fantastic elements (actually there's a dragon, not unlike the eighties' classic!), the story of a brave little kid (a girl, Chihiro, in this case) battling courageously, though is somewhat more &quot;terrestrial&quot; conditions (working hard in bathhouse to to maintain her integrity, and be able to save her parents) and the abundance of spells and magic in the story. As for the parallel I see with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, it has to do with the parallel &quot;world&quot; in which the spirits of the movie inhabit, by night: a supra-world, you might call it; one where they rule and admit no actual humans (I guess it's not the best comparison, but you get the idea... I hope!)The movie as a whole is not a typical Sunday afternoon popcorn-in-the-couch flic: it is a story that departs from conventions. But it constantly rewars you with a clever and adorable storyline that is not short of funny moments. In the end, you get a very refreshing feeling deep inside.

598632,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00005JLET,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[3, 4]","In yet another proof of Hiyao Miyazaki's genius at anime and story telling, the director creates a story written about one 10 year old for yet another, and demonstrates that we all are never immune to stories that come from the heart.  The story is layered, ostensibly the tale of young Chihiro, a whining, self-centered girl who finds herself catapulted into a magical world where her parents are turned into pigs.  However, Chihiro demonstrates she is far more than a clumsy unpleasant child, as events bring her into contact with the denizens of the spirit bathhouse where she must work until she can free her parents.From everyone she meets, Haku the dragon magician, Lin the serving woman,  terrifying Yubaba, and all the others Chihiro discovers part of an important lesson in the value of determination and love.  Even from No Face, a lonely spirit who causes chaos, even though he really only wants to be cared about, there is much to absorb.  Funny, sad, frightening, and encouraging, the experience is something akin to looking into a chest full of gems.  Chihiro passes her tests, and the girl who walks away from the bathhouse is miles away from the one who arrived.One of the remarkable things about 'Spirited Away' is that Hiyao Miyazaki has chosen to go well beyond the constraints of Japanese mythology is a setting where one would expect stories straight out of the Kojiki legends.  Instead, he spins out of universal cloth, borrowing from the stories of many heritages.  Right at the beginning, the magic that entraps Chihiro's parents echoes stories of human trips to Faerie, where on is ordered to 'never eat the food.'  Even more precious are his outright inventions such as No Face, Miyazaki's stand-in for himself.  Thus, the mythic appeal of the film touches roots everywhere, explaining much of its appeal.On watching the film for the second time, I spent some time with the pause button studying the individual frames.  When you are moving with the action, it is difficult to pay attention to the artistic particulars.  When these stand revealed, the film's beauty is undeniable - thousands of frames of artistic gems.

598639,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00005JLET,maskedgamer,"[7, 77]","Spirited Away is one of those films that's targeted at people who have no idea what a great anime should look like. They confuse good animation, with a few cultural references, and complete lack of direction and plot development with a masterpiece. Spirited Away has received rave reviews by just about everyone that doesn't watch Anime on a normal basis. Being someone that enjoys watching Japanese animation there are two things that I look for an any piece of work that I view. The first thing would be a well developed plot, and the second being well developed characters (good artwork doesn't make a great movie so it's a throw away). Spirited Away has neither of those two. It's simply weird scenario after weird scenario. If there is a way that any of the events are to have a deep symbolic meaning, or were meant to connect somehow it is lost. The target audience for this film is young children. I would not show a movie of this nature to anyone under the age of 18. That is the legal age of comprehension for this film (if there is anything to make sense of about it). It somewhat has that feeling of Alice in wonderland, but unlike Alice's adventure this film isn't always clear as of the direction it's going in or what each characters purpose is. The movie starts out going somewhere then goes absolutely no where. If the purpose of this animation was to be as abstract and confusing as possible Miyazaki has succeeded. I have viewed many abstract and out of the ordinary animes, but those are always mirrored by an intricate story line and a deep underlying meaning that in the end actually makes its awkwardness sensible. That is what makes a great anime feature. I know many people place this movie on a pedestal, but those same people have very limited knowledge about what great anime is. For its art style Spirited Away is great, however like I said earlier great art does not necessarily make a great film. I wish I could feel as passionate about this film the way other people do, but there is absolutely nothing to be passionate about. If your looking for a fairytale with a dark atmosphere with an abstractness that actually makes sense I highly recommend ""Pan's Labyrinth"". It's sophisticated, beautiful, clever, has left many critics clapping, and deserves every word of praise it receives, because that is was a masterpiece is.

Dad decides that it's really the entrance to a failed amusement park. He and Mom decide to go exploring, and the little girl, filled with trepidation, has no choice but to go along. After awhile, the little family discovers a restaurant that is still operating. The parents gorge themselves until they are turned into pigs. Suddenly alone, the child finds herself in a place full of witches, ghosts, goblins and other assorted spirits. Aided only by an unearthly boy, she must now save her parents and find her way out of this surreal place.The movie was made in Japan by animation master Hayao Miyazaki and his crew. It became the highest grossing movie of all time in that country. The people at Disney bought the American rights and lovingly added an excellent English soundtrack.

When her family explores an abandoned theme park, Chihiro is magically ""spirited away"" to another realm where gods, monsters and spirits live. A mysterious character named Haku befriends her and teaches her the ropes of this new spirit world. Soon, Chihiro is working in Yubaba's bath house -- a spa for the gods! All along, though, she just wants to see her parents again and return to the human world (""there's no place like home""). Chihiro, like Dorothy (Oz) or Frodo (Rings), must learn to find her strength and courage and does so by telling the truth, doing kind acts, and, ultimately, following her heart.As an American, used to seeing the Disney films, SPIRITED AWAY's style is at first a little different. The animation is not fluid and realistic like Disney. However, the colors, direction, and story-telling transport you into Miyazaki's world. Some of the images are downright surrealistic -- oversized chicks, bouncing heads, the ""stink monster"". Miyazaki's imagination never ceases to impress and entertain. Some of his creative ideas are very funny, as well (Yubaba's baby!).I'm an adult and enjoyed SPIRITED AWAY very much. I couldn't see anything in the film that would be offensive to young kids or families. Some of the film might be scary to them -- but, heck, so is THE WIZARD OF OZ (flying monkeys! Ahh!).By the way, I watched SPIRITED AWAY with its original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.  Knowing that the film originated in Japan made me not want to hear the dubbed American voices and translation.  The subtitles allowed me to hear the film in its original language.  Of course, the DVD provides both options, so to each his own!Mostly, though, SPIRITED AWAY has an amazing new vision that I'd never seen before.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[18, 21]","Like ""Princess Mononoke"", director Hayao Miyazaki's latest animated film, ""Spirited Away"", was inspired greatly by animistic Shinto beliefs.  The story begins with a young girl named Chihiro riding in a car with her parents.  While driving to their new home, they take a turn onto a dirt road that leads them to an old building.  In spite of Chihiro's objections, she follows her parents into the building's entrance.  They emerge on the other side into daylight and walk towards a set of buildings.  The buildings appear abandoned, but when Chihiro's parents smell food cooking, they follow it to a well-stocked restaurant and begin to gorge themselves.  Chihiro refuses to eat and wanders away to investigate on her own.  When she returns, she finds that her parents have turned into two fat pigs.  When night suddenly falls, Chihiro is further terrified by the unexpected appearance of an assortment of strange spiritual beings; but one boy, Haku, helps Chihiro and tells her that there may be a way to restore her parents.  Will Chihiro, who is later renamed Sen, be able to restore her parents and survive in the strange world or spirits and magic?As in ""Princess Mononoke"", the animation in ""Spirited Away"" is intricate, amazing and beautiful. Other very interesting characters include the witch Yubaba, Sen's coworker Lin, boiler manager Kamaji, the little black creatures that assist Kamaji, and No-Face.  Western viewers may find the story strange since the story contains no battles between good & evil, and also since many of the characters are inherently neither good nor evil for the most part either.  Overall, I found the plot to be very engaging, as well as the cinematography and animation, and I rate the film with 5 out of 5 stars.  The DVD version can be watched in its original Japanese with English subtitles, or dubbed in English, which was done well.

I had no idea what I was in for when I picked up &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; I only knew that it was loved by so many different people, including my friends. So, I decided to take the trip and see what it was all about. I have to say that this is a stunning Anime that is larger-than-life.This fantasy epic is about a little girl named, Chihiro. She gets separated from her parents when they visit a strange place that turns out to be a spirit world; a world that doesn't take too kindly to humans. When her parents transforms into pigs as punishment, Chihiro is forced to take a journey into the unknown and find the courage that is buried deep within herself. As she meets strange and magical creatures, both good and bad, Chihiro starts to realize all of the things she had once taken for granted. The lessons she learns will determine the success of her accomplishments--and will also determine the fate of her parents and herself.It's hard to put into words of what I experienced when I was watching this breath-taking film, but I can tell you that taking the ride is well worth it. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is a pure and energetic example of how powerful the art of animation can be when it comes to story-telling. This movie is everything a mystical journey should consist of. There's danger, and yet, there is also heart--and a lot of it. This would not have been as successful had it been filmed in a live-action movie. The art and scenery that we are presented with really goes beyond imagination. The creative mind of Hayao Miyazaki really snaps into action as he brings this powerful and unique story to life. The film also has some magnificent characters and themes.There are some cool things that this 2-disc DVD set has to offer. First of all, the picture and sound quality is really superb. You can either watch it with an English audio track or the original Japanese track. They did a really good job of dubbing it in English, as I have a hard time trying to read subtitles and keeping up with what's going on at the same time; so there, I benefited a great deal. Others might prefer the original Japanese track, which is why it's great that the DVD offers both. Extras include numerous featurettes on the making of the movie and the thought process behind it.I really loved &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; It surprised me so many times throughout, and I was never once disappointed with the results. If you're looking for a great journey to take in the world of Anime, then this is the ride to take. It's breath-taking, imaginative, and stunningly beautiful. Do not be turned off by the fact that this is an animated feature, otherwise you might end up missing the trip of a lifetime.

598652,A1DL822FZZQA00,B00005JLET,"Michael E. Hill ""Major Rassendyll""","[1, 1]","""Spirited Away"" is a classic animation masterpiece by Hiyao Miyazaki.  In this reviewers opinion, Miyazaki is the greatest animated storyteller and visionary since the late Walter Elias Disney.  This film is justifiably considered his greatest.  It won the Academy Award for best animated feature the year of it's release.Chihiro is an 11 year old brat.  Her family is moving and she doesn't like it one bit.  To make things worse, her father makes the wrong turn.  He then insists on investigating what appears to be an abandoned theme park.  However things aren't what they seem, with the setting of the sun, things begin to transform including her parents.  Aided by a mysterious boy, Haku, Chihiro learns to survive in this spirit word.  She gets a job at a bath house for the spirits run by the witch Yubaba.In the process of adapting to her new situation, Chihiro grows tremendously. In order to save herself and her family, she going to display reservoirs of strength and resourcefulness she didn't know she had.  Miyazaki handles this realistically.  As Chihiro adapts to her situation, her emotions range from confusion to terror to resignation through bouts of depression.  Nonetheless she prevails and even finds friendship, loyalty and love.She also bumps her head a lot......literally.The detail of Miyagi's work is incredible.  Look at the details of the boiler room where Chihiro meets Komagi, Yubaba's office, the details of bathhouse operation etc.  Miyagi bases his characters on actual people.  `Chihiro' is based on the daughter of a close friend.  Her parents had no idea he had been studying her so closely.The DVD includes extras primarily about the making of the film including it dubbing in English.

598653,APL7KHB0KKPA3,B00005JLET,Michael H. Siegel,"[41, 43]","I am gratified to see that Spirited Away is finally getting the attention in this country that it has long deserved.  Buried by Disney until the Academy Awards, the latest creation of Japan's animation guru is simply stunning -- the best animated feature since Snow White.You've read the plot summaries and perhaps the idea of a Japanese film about a 10-year old girl who gets trapped in the spirit world sounds strange.  But this picture has universal appeal.  I'm an 30-year old white American male and I love this movie.  The (mostly) hand-drawn animation is lush, gorgeous and incredibly dynamic.  And how nice is it to see 3-dimensional characters in a complex touching story that goes in unexpected directions every chance it gets?  It leaves anything produced by Disney/Pixar in the dust.Disney has done an excellent job of bringing this movie to America.  The copy is crisp and clear -- although obviously not as magnificent as on the big screen.  The voice-dubbing is very good, matching the character's mouths without losing content.  I had a slight problem with Princess Mononoke's dubbing because some of the celebrity voices (especially Thornton and Anderson) were distracting.  That's not the case here.  The english voices are perfectly cast (especially Suzanne Pleshette as Yubaba/Zeniba).A few notes on the DVD.  The extras are OK with the exception of an outstanding Japanese TV special on the making of Spirited Away.  Rather than focus on the technical aspects, it focuses on Miyazaki himself and his uber-talented group of artists at Studio Ghibli.  It's definitely worth your time.Also, some comments have unfavorably compared this version to the Japanese version.  For the record, Disney is contractually forbidden from changing a single frame of the movie -- not one frame.  Period.  There *are* some differences in dialogue but you can watch in Japanese with more literally translated subtitles (subtitle track 2) if you prefer.Final comment:  this movie may not be suitable for very young children as it has some scary sequences and is over two hours long.  But for everyone else, this is an incredible movie.

598654,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00005JLET,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 9]","First, Spirited Away is about a little girl, but it is NOT A MOVIE FOR LITTLE KIDS.This is something I feel should be stated up front for all the folks (*cough*mundanes*cough*) who think that anything that's animated is for kiddies. It ain't. Welcome to the world of anime.Actually, let me amend that. There seems to be some anime apologists who are afraid the film will get a bad rap if parents are told that it's not for children. Well foo on them too. This is not a movie suitable for young children. I'll explain more in a moment.And what a world it is. A young girl named Chihiro travels with her parents to their new home and on the way, take a short cut to what looks like an abandoned theme park. Her parents wander heedlessly into the grounds and find some delicious-smelling food, which they consume.Then they turn into pigs. It's not a blink-and-you-miss-it special effect. It's a slow, terrifying effect. Chihiro's parents turn into big, fat, squealing pigs. It's horrible -- it's meant to be. Remember the not for kids warning? This is one reason why.Chihiro is not without her allies. She meets Haku, a river dragon who appears to her in boy form (most of the time). With his help and guidance, Chihiro manages to survive her transition into what turns out to be the spirit world. She makes friends with a moustached, goggled spider-like being who runs the boilerroom and finds employment with Yubaba, the domineering old crone who runs the bathhouse.Being that I've written a few fantasy books set in Russian fairytales (see Tsar Rising and The Dancing Hut), words like &quot;bathhouse,&quot; &quot;crone,&quot; and &quot;Yubaba&quot; ring bells. I'm saddened that very few reviewers picked up on the movie's inspiration.The movie takes many of its cues from Russian myth. Yubaba = Baba Yaga, the infamous hag. Just as Yubaba has a baby she fawns over, Baba Yaga alternately menaces and cares for children. She has a host of young girls working for her in some stories -- in others, she is a cannibal. The parallels are all there.There's more: Yubaba has a twin sister, Zeniba. In Russian myth, there's typically three hags (all sisters), but the similarity is unmistakable. And of course there's the bathhouse itself. In both Russian and Japanese myth, the bathhouse is a magical place where the spirits take over at midnight. Which is precisely what happens in Spirited Away.And oh yeah, there's a two-headed eagle (a symbol of old Russia) on Yubaba's tapestry. Of course, nobody pays attention to Russia these days for reasons I can only ascribe to the Cold War.There are plenty of elements that aren't from Russian myth. No-Face, a strange demon that leeches off of other people's personalities, changes from a benevolent ally to a monstrous thing that tries to eat everyone in the bathhouse. It moans and wails, it eats people, it's really quite gross and scary -- not for kids.What the movie does have is charm. Love, friendship, trust -- all these things help Chichiro to survive.

I supposed I was expecting to see this movie and be utterly blown away a la ""Princess Mononoke,"" and in some ways I was.  It moved me and made me think, and the movie's artistry let my imagination soar free just as with ""Mononoke.""However, my first impression is that the coherency in that earlier Miyazaki film is missing here.  Being that this and ""Mononoke"" are the only two films of his I have seen, maybe this kind of movie is really more of his style and he isn't usually as lucid or accessible as he was with ""Mononoke,"" yet I still think that film set a standard for storytelling, emotion, and beauty that few, if any, movies have matched since.  The plot progressed at a thrilling pace, and the conclusion was perfect and utterly satisfying.""Spirited Away,"" on the other hand, doesn't progress nearly as smoothly.  In fact, the only real (coherent) plot development occurs in the first 45 minutes or so of the movie, with the changing of Chihiro's parents to pigs, her introduction to the bath house, her meeting with Haku and Yubaba, and her meeting with No Face.  After that, to a certain degree, the movie seems to meander plot-wise.  Though characters are put into dilemnas here and there, you never really get the feeling that they're in true danger, or that any of the plot elements really are that crucial.  Despite the fact that I admire the gray-area nature of good and evil in Miyazaki's films, I think it would've served the movie's plot and development better if Yubaba had been more maliciously cast.  Might be fault of the translation, but I don't know...There are some elements that make little sense with the overarching themes and plot line of the movie, as well.  No Face is possibly the biggest example of this.  He/she/it just seems to be thrown in to add meat to the plot, and little more.  It's an interesting diversion, but it makes little sense with the story, besides highlighting the theme of greed, possibly.  Which brings me to another aspect I didn't like so much: themes of maturation and love were (pretty) well dealt with, but the theme of greed was probably too overdone, especially with Chihiro's parents turning into pigs and No Face's handing out of gold to everyone.Being as I've viewed it all the way through only once, it might need some time, but so far I just don't see the coherency of ""Mononoke"" here.",4,"More subtle, oblique than ""Mononoke""",1050710400,"04 19, 2003",2003,2416,"['opinion', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'movie', 'better', 'supposed', 'was', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'be', 'utterly', 'blown', 'away', 'la', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'ways', 'was', 'moved', 'made', 'think', 'movie', 'artistry', 'let', 'imagination', 'soar', 'free', 'just', 'Mononoke', 'However', 'first', 'impression', 'coherency', 'earlier', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'missing', 'here', 'Being', 'Mononoke', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'maybe', 'kind', 'movie', 'really', 'more', 'style', ""n't"", 'usually', 'lucid', 'accessible', 'was', 'Mononoke', 'yet', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'set', 'standard', 'storytelling', 'emotion', 'beauty', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'matched', 'plot', 'progressed', 'thrilling', 'pace', 'conclusion', 'was', 'perfect', 'utterly', 'satisfying', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'other', 'hand', ""n't"", 'progress', 'nearly', 'smoothly', 'fact', 'only', 'real', 'coherent', 'plot', 'development', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'movie', 'changing', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'pigs', 'introduction', 'bath', 'house', 'meeting', 'Haku', 'Yubaba', 'meeting', 'Face', 'certain', 'degree', 'movie', 'meander', 'plot-wise', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'dilemnas', 'here', 'there', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'true', 'danger', 'plot', 'elements', 'really', 'are', 'crucial', 'fact', 'admire', 'gray-area', 'nature', 'good', 'evil', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'served', 'movie', 'plot', 'development', 'better', 'Yubaba', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'maliciously', 'cast', 'Might', 'be', 'fault', 'translation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'elements', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'overarching', 'themes', 'plot', 'line', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Face', 'possibly', 'biggest', 'example', 'He/she/it', 'just', 'be', 'thrown', 'add', 'meat', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'diversion', 'little', 'sense', 'story', 'highlighting', 'theme', 'greed', 'possibly', 'Which', 'aspect', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'so', 'much', 'themes', 'maturation', 'love', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'theme', 'greed', 'was', 'probably', 'too', 'overdone', 'especially', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'turning', 'pigs', 'Face', 'handing', 'gold', 'everyone.Being', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'way', 'only', 'once', 'might', 'need', 'time', 'so', 'far', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coherency', 'Mononoke', 'here']",N/A

598658,A3L46ZRKNFN0SG,B00005JLET,Michael W. Howe,"[0, 1]","My first introduction to Spirited Away was a tape at the Chicago Comic Convention.  Having heard the hype for the film, and finding the tape for sale there, I took it home and watched it at 2 in the morning.  Well, let me say that even though the quality was off a bit, I was hooked!  I watched it probably every other day for the next month.Within a few weeks, I became the lead editor for the film at Countdown to Spirited Away on the site Countingdown.com, and soon had obtained a DVD from overseas.But wait you say, you bought an overseas copy yet you're reviewing the American DVD?  Yes I am, for I have both in my collection now.  And let me say that the work that John Lasseter and his crew did for the English dub makes it one of the best English dubs I have ever heard (eclipsing the work done for Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke).The film is a very simple story.  Chihiro, a listless and spoiled 10-year-old girl is moving with her parents.  taking a wrong turn, they find themselves in a world of spirits where Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs.  Chihiro must brave her way through this strange world and survive, but can she return her parents to normal and find her way home?That premise is all I will say, as anymore would destroy the story.  Nowadays, there is literal fluff available for children.  i've seen parents nod off and wish the world would end before most films, but I've sat through countless showings of this film, and everytime, I've seen people enthralled by what was on that screen.  I heard no crying children, no children squirming in their seats.  I attended a sneak preview with 19 of my animation friends and they all loved it (my friend's mother has a habit of nodding off through films, but she stayed awake through all 2 hours of Spirited Away).The DVD contains the original Japanese dialogue, as well as the French and English dubs.  There are subtitles included as well as a few specials.  PIXAR studios' John Lasseter (a close personal friend to director Hayao Miyazaki) has a 2 minute opening monologue about his love for the film.There is also a segment called 'The Art of Spirited Away,' a very 'weak' segment hosted by Jason Marsden (the voice of Haku in the English dub), that explains bringing the film to the US.On the second disc, there are selected storyboards (images drawn by Miyazaki to explain the film in visual form), as well as a 50 minute special from Japanese TV that is the most in depth making of for this film you will find. Watch as the staff finds themselves under pressure, and you can see the tension building in Miyazaki's face.  There is even 30 minutes of movie trailers from Japan (while most of tehm follow a repetitive manner, it would have been nice to put in trailers from the French release and the wonderful English trailer).The disc is lacking in a few areas for features (my overseas copy has the full storyboards instead of selected storyboard sequences), but I'm just glad that the film will finally be seen by people.  After the lackluster ad campaign that Disney did for this filmback in September, the DVD release will probably prove to them that kids can go just as wild over Miyazaki's films as they do for Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.",5,I can't say enough about this incredible film!,1050624000,"04 18, 2003",2003,3233,"['first', 'introduction', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'was', 'tape', 'Chicago', 'Comic', 'Convention', 'Having', 'heard', 'hype', 'film', 'finding', 'tape', 'sale', 'there', 'took', 'home', 'watched', '2', 'morning', 'Well', 'let', 'say', 'even', 'quality', 'was', 'bit', 'was', 'hooked', 'watched', 'probably', 'other', 'day', 'next', 'month.Within', 'few', 'weeks', 'became', 'lead', 'editor', 'film', 'Countdown', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'site', 'Countingdown.com', 'soon', 'had', 'obtained', 'DVD', 'overseas.But', 'wait', 'say', 'bought', 'overseas', 'copy', 'yet', ""'re"", 'reviewing', 'American', 'DVD', 'Yes', 'am', 'have', 'collection', 'now', 'let', 'say', 'work', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'crew', 'did', 'English', 'dub', 'one', 'best', 'English', 'dubs', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'eclipsing', 'work', 'done', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', '.The', 'film', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'Chihiro', 'listless', 'spoiled', '10-year-old', 'girl', 'moving', 'parents', 'taking', 'wrong', 'turn', 'find', 'world', 'spirits', 'where', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'are', 'turned', 'pigs', 'Chihiro', 'must', 'brave', 'way', 'strange', 'world', 'survive', 'can', 'return', 'parents', 'normal', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'premise', 'will', 'say', 'anymore', 'would', 'destroy', 'story', 'literal', 'fluff', 'available', 'children', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parents', 'off', 'wish', 'world', 'would', 'end', 'most', 'films', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'countless', 'showings', 'film', 'everytime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'people', 'enthralled', 'what', 'was', 'screen', 'heard', 'crying', 'children', 'children', 'squirming', 'seats', 'attended', 'sneak', 'preview', '19', 'animation', 'friends', 'loved', 'friend', 'mother', 'habit', 'nodding', 'off', 'films', 'stayed', 'awake', '2', 'hours', 'Spirited', 'Away', '.The', 'DVD', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'French', 'English', 'dubs', 'are', 'subtitles', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'specials', 'PIXAR', 'studios', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'close', 'personal', 'friend', 'director', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', '2', 'minute', 'opening', 'monologue', 'love', 'film.There', 'also', 'segment', 'called', ""'The"", 'Art', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'very', ""'weak"", 'segment', 'hosted', 'Jason', 'Marsden', 'voice', 'Haku', 'English', 'dub', 'bringing', 'film', 'US.On', 'second', 'disc', 'are', 'selected', 'storyboards', 'images', 'drawn', 'Miyazaki', 'explain', 'film', 'visual', 'form', 'as', 'well', '50', 'minute', 'special', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'most', 'depth', 'making', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'Watch', 'staff', 'pressure', 'can', 'see', 'tension', 'building', 'Miyazaki', 'face', 'even', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'trailers', 'Japan', 'most', 'tehm', 'follow', 'repetitive', 'manner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'put', 'trailers', 'French', 'release', 'wonderful', 'English', 'trailer', '.The', 'disc', 'lacking', 'few', 'areas', 'features', 'overseas', 'copy', 'full', 'storyboards', 'instead', 'selected', 'storyboard', 'sequences', ""'m"", 'just', 'glad', 'film', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'seen', 'people', 'lackluster', 'ad', 'campaign', 'Disney', 'did', 'filmback', 'September', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'probably', 'prove', 'kids', 'can', 'go', 'just', 'as', 'wild', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'do', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Winnie', 'Pooh']",N/A

598660,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00005JLET,Mir,"[2, 3]","You certainly don't have to be Japanese to enjoy this marvel of animated film-making. (Although thanks to the reviewer who gave explanations for some of the details. I really appreciate knowing what those candy things are that so delight the soot ball creatures.)As with all the Miyazaki films I've seen--and much loved--you start with some time in the protagonist's normal, non-magical world (whether a long time or short, depending on the film.) Here, we are in a car with Chigiro and her parents, as they are on their way to a new home. Chigiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, but her parents tell her she should look at it as an adventure, as all new places are adventures.Oh, how prophetic.They pass a plot of grassy land by the side of the road cluttered with tiny shrines to a host of spirits. Another bit of foreshadowing. The parents are skeptical as they explain to Chigiro what they are.Then they park the car at a dead-end in the road, and enter a tunnel which takes them to an unusual, seemingly deserted place. Chigiro's papa says it's an abandoned amusement park. They explore this place that has echoes of Easter Island, with these partly toppled, partly buried  huge stone faces. Then they find colorful streets crammed with restaurants, all empty. All but one. While no people are in sight, the restaurant brims with tempting delicacies (though, er, fishheads aren't my thing). Chigiro's parents begin to feast. She does not. She wanders...And the adventure officially BEGINS!This is no abandoned, mundane amusement park. This is the land of spirits, and a central point of action turns out to be a bathhouse where non-human creatures of all manner (some dreadful, some mysterious, some hilarious, all interesting) come to clean up and relax and feast.Chigiro receives the help of some of these non-humans, and is challenged and threatened by others, but there is no obvious villain, for, as in other Miyazaki works, characters are complex, with both good and not-so-good in their characters, whether it's self-indulgence or abuse of power or greed or gluttony or grudge-holding or whatever. And even good or well-meaning deeds can go all wrong. But, as with other Miyazaki works, compassion and bravery and hard work and sacrifice go a long, long way. And helping hands come when need is greatest. And a sort of benevolent providence watches over the world. This is what gives such magic to this work--as it does Princess Mononoke or My Neighbor Totoro, etc. Fine characterization, extraordinary visions of the magical, magnificent artistry, and a gentle heart that runs throughout.And there is always the too-too-too adorable or cute for words critter. In Totoro, it was the beasts themselves (especially chibi) and the cute soot critters. In Mononoke it was the tree spirits that made me laugh and laugh. Here, it's, yes, the cute little soot things again, but also the hilarious tiny bird with the mosquito-buzzing wings and the chubby, bouncy mouse with attitude. And even the radish monster was a hoot.I love the manifestations of gentleness and generosity and goodness in Miyazaki's works. Here, Chigiro helps a Faceless Spirit whose loneliness is a palpable things. The ride in the train at night is evocative and blends a sort of sadness and hope and resolve. The music chosen for this exceptional sequence is perfect--a haunting piano piece.

What's not to love in a movie?In this animated movie, Chihiro, a young girl, is traveling to her new home with her mother and father when they get lost.  They find themselves in an abandoned town that is filled with some good food.  Her mother and father start eating while Chihiro explores and when she gets back they have been turned to pigs.  With the help of Hoku, a young boy who mysteriously appears, Chihiro learns that she is in the spirt world, most specifically at a bathhouse run by a devious witch.At the bathhouse Chihiro learns what hard work and kindness is as she seeks a cure for her parents.  She also becomes friends with Hoku and has to help him and the bathhouse when trouble is afoot.  Its an awful lot for a young girl though, specially one that isn't used to hard work.  Sometimes Chihiro wonders if she'll ever get home.Even though Chihiro is supposed to be annoying I never really get that from her.  She just seems like a young timid girl to me that faces a lot and has slightly mean parents.  All of the people of the bathhouse are interesting; they're unique spirits to be sure.  And Chihiro finds some good friends there as well.  There are a couple of ""scary"" characters in this that might frighten younger children, but they add a lot to the plot and it is interesting to see Chihiro interacting with them.  Hoku especially is a hard character to read but even so, the viewer has to trust Chihiro in regards to him.There are some unusual plot elements to this movie and rituals that I don't quite understand.  I judge them to be either the makings of a child's mind or something exclusive to the writer's country that they would understand there.  Regardless, it makes it whimsical and doesn't detract from the story at all.  And it is a good story about growing.  Chihiro does a marvelous job and really develops some loyalty to her friends.  While the ending does rush a bit, it still is very nice and finishes out the story well.  I was pleased with it anyway.For cinematography, since it is a cartoon type film there's not special effects per say.  But the animation is done really well, there's a lot of neat scenes in this movie.  Most especially the train ride is very poignant to me.  Combined with the great music in this film, it just really speaks to you.  A lot of the other scenes are touching as well.A really touching movie and good for the whole family.  Even if you aren't a fan of anime, this is one you should see.Review by M.

598668,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00005JLET,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[1, 2]","Writing as someone who has never watched anime before, this animated feature is an incredibly imaginative superior production with an intelligent story.Chihiro is on her way with her parents to a new home - on the way they stop to explore a strange tunnel, which takes them into another world.  In this world, through gluttony, her parents are turned into pigs, and Chihiro is rescued by Haku, a young boy.  She finds work in the centrepiece of this world, the bathhouse for spirits, in which she has many adventures which gradually change her from sullen and spoiled to helpful and kind.The ideas are complex, and the animation suitably layered as well.  The bathhouse creatures are weird and wonderful creations - neither heroes nor bad guys, good nor bad - just fascinating multilayered characters.  All of the main storylines involve layers of identity, nothing being what it first seems, and the animation style lends itself to this incredibly well. There is the slime monster who everyone cannot bear the smell of, who, with a little kindness reveals a more benevolent and powerful spirit.  Or the `No-face', sort of a walking `Scream' portrait, who changes his identity through loneliness, but returns once kindness and friendship are given.  And of course Haku, who takes many forms before being redeemed when reminded of his true identity.Though the animation on one level may appear simplified compared to modern cgi `toons', in fact the colours and rhythm of events are richer than most, and although I am writing this after one viewing, one suspects that there is much more to be seen on multiple viewings.Amongst the almost universally glowing reviews however, it is worth remembering that this is a Japanese film.  This is both an asset and a detraction.  The asset is clear - this movie has more imagination in one scene than any current animated Western feature has in its whole length, both in animation and story.  However, while Hollywood sometimes falls prey to too much schmaltz, the absence of a sweetener to the tale here means that it is difficult to be absorbed on more than an intellectual level.  Animated features work because you become passionate about the characters or the outcome - not easy when all you are doing is thinking how wonderful all the ideas are.The DVD comes in two disc form, with the first showing the film in both English dubbed (by John Lasseter of Toy Story / Pixar boss fame) and the original Japanese with subtitles.  There is also an option to watch the whole movie in its original storyboard form, but hard to imagine anyone would watch the whole movie this way - though it is fascinating to see this embryonic stage of the movie for a minute or two in places.The second disc contains a range of material educating the non-Japanese and anime fans amongst us of Miyazaki's output, amongst other generally interesting bits and pieces.Having said that, the tale is a complete one, the experience rich, and the moral positive.  Perhaps younger children will find this a little scary in places, and perhaps a little complicated, but it's a small quibble with so much to warrant the Oscar (Best Animated Feature, 2002) it won.

Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[2, 6]","Take the Ghost of Walt Disney sit him down in a Tokyo bar paired up with Roger Waters, a couple of Saki's, and a night on the town and you have mish-mashed together Fantasia and The Wall.  That would about sum up Hayao Miyazaki's visionary work in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;Though it does trace elements of Alice and Wonderland, it left me wondering, who the audience really is...the child or the adult?  Like great works of animation, I believe &quot;Spirited Away&quot; transcends age and crosses over to both audiences.  It may be too deep and too dark in parts to truly appeal to the younger of age but there are fantastical threads all the way through that may not connect with those too far removed from childhood.  There may be some cultural perspectives that some of those in American audiences may find unfamiliar, but for those willing to expand boundaries, &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; is worth the stretching.  Keep an open mind and imagination and you may find yourself caught up in the beautifully hand-drawn animation.  It is the work of an artisan.The story is centered around a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new house with her mother and father.  Along the way they get spirited away to an alternate reality world in which Chihiro is renamed Sen, her parents are turned to pigs, and her redeemers are a river god and a six-armed curmudgeon that stokes the furnace.  Sound unusual to you?  Well it is.  If you give it a chance, the story mixed with the animation will draw you in and enable you to celebrate the creativity that went into such a unique work.I would say if you are a fan of anime or just animation in general, this is a movie you wouldn't want to miss.

'Castle In The Sky,' 'Kiki's Delivery Service,' etc...All of Hayao's films emanate with a sense of sheer wonder and pure magic, as if the master animator has secret powers no one else has been able to tap into....The plot in brief: Chihiro is a somewhat bratty young girl moving to another house with her mom and dad. They get sidetracked and end up wandering into a mystical resort/spa for Japanese gods and spirits and the like. Hijinks do not ensue. Instead, we get a captivating and hypnotizing journey into a very weird otherworld as Chihiro fights to save her parents and along the way becomes a better person through the unshakable morals that she never knew she had.The animation in 'Spirited Away' is fluid and disjointed all at once, making for a hypnotizing and captivating film experience. Colors and shadows frequently intermix, leaving us with a feeling that this world (odd as it is) seems somewhat more realistic than even ours. There are so many strange and wonderful creatures and characters in the film that you'll be scratching your head as to how they even thought some of them up. Three bouncing green heads that only speak in grunts, a gigantic, fat talking baby, a spider-like old man with impossibly long arms, living coal dust, and the list goes on and on...There is one scene towards the end of the film featuring Chihiro and some of her 'companions' on a lonely train headed to an unknown destination in that forgotten alternate world that comes off as so haunting and touching that I felt it was one of the most memorable sequences in recent film memory; nothing major happens and no words are even spoken, it's just an example of why Miyazaki is the greatest animation storyteller ever.Bottom Line: 'Spirited Away' is arguably the best animated film of all time. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the narrative lags here and there in a few parts, which may turn the average moviegoer off.

598684,A12CUOYPW2QM91,B00005JLET,"Omar Khan ""RW""","[6, 6]","Hayao Miyazaki has had it rough with American audiences.  The master director has only been glimpsed briefly by American movie-watchers once or twice in the nineties.  However, he did manage to secure a somewhat small stateside followings with the releases of &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;My Neighbor Totoro,&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; speckled throughout the nineties.  Finally, he has received the ultimate recognition that he has had coming in &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;Now, for those of yout oo lazy to read the back of the DVD here's how the story goes.  Chihiro is a little girl who is at a very odd point in her life; her family is moving to a new town.  On the way, her family decides to take a detour and winds up in a strange land that her father dimisses as an amusement park gone under.  However, night falls and the place comes to life.  Spirits of all shapes and sizes start emerging from the woodwork.  Chihiro is frightened for her life, tires to get away, but can't when she realizes her parents have been turned to pigs.  A benevolent spirit, Haku, helps her out by getting her into the Bath House of the Gods, the property of one evil witch named Yu-Baba.  She gives Chihiro a job, but takes her name as colateral, giving her the suffix &quot;Sen.&quot;  From here she learns about herself in an alien, yet familiar, world populated by gods.The story is very much similar to the works of Lewis Carrol, but works on a more Eastern way of thinking.  The spirits presented here are mainstays in Shinto folklore.  In this, Miyazaki provides the viewer with a world so far into the imagination yet at the same time, hitting close to home.  It's a sense of creativity in something that has been around for eons that makes them wonderous.  The spirits/gods/kame are infinitely more enjoyable than any deity that has come across Western screens.  From the spider-like Kamaji, to the inky No-Face, and (my personal favorite) the oozing Mud God.The characters are much like Miyazaki's other movies.  His traditional heroine who grows strong through out the movie, and the wonderous side characters that support her.  Each character is used for all intents and purposes.  Not a single character wastes screen time.  If you've ever seen a Miyazaki film, you know these characters are easy to relate to and fun to love.The music is everything I would expect from a Ghibli film.  Hisaishi Joe has been conducting for twenty years and shows no sign of losing his touch.  His melodies are a mix of emotions that add onto the action on screen.The animation is gorgeous.  There is no doubt about that, Miyazaki's films always have an aura of perfection, especially in the art and animation department.  Even his older works like &quot;Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro&quot; and &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; age better than most anime their time period.  The whole world in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; looks like one gigantic, colorful portrait.  Key word; Beautiful.In the end, I really can't stop praising this film enough.

For those comfortable with these features of the genre, this film will stand out as clearly the finest yet made: an essential part of any serious anime collection and easily worth a dozen viewings. However, viewers new to serious anime (we're not talking Speed Racer here) and especially those with young children, should take care: this film, like many of its predecessors (notably Mononoke) contains disturbing images that will not be suitable for all audiences. Moreover, because these images are -- in typical anime fashion -- often dreamily disconnected from any real narrative purpose, they are all the more shocking, especially to those expecting a family animation experience along the lines of Lion King.

A rare combination of stylish animation and engaging, brilliant, truly original storytelling that will delight young and old for many repeated viewings.The description above (the www.amazon.com one) is very good so I won't repeat it here.Left out of the description, is that the japanese and the english dialogue are somewhat different.  I first saw the film in the theatres in the original Japanese (subtitled), and was delighted to find on the DVD subtle differences in the english dialogue that I imagine were changed to appeal more to english ears.  Not all the differences are language based.  (For instance: in the japenese version No-face doesn't really speak, he just urges people to take his gold with grunts and body language.  In the english version, he has dialogue.  Fascinating!)Pixar shows great respect in their wonderful job of translation and addition of the english voices.  John Lassiter, of Pixar, is interviewed, and he discusses how impressive he feels this film is.  (There's a stamp of approval.)Thank goodness both versions are included.  Watch them both!  The subtleties are worthwhile and interesting.What I liked most about this movie is how immersed we become in the unusual world Chihiro finds herself in, and how absorbed we, as viewers, become in Chihiro's point of view and her plight.  I, quite often, felt just as she did - ignorant, scared, alienated, desparate, and overwhelmed.  My heart was racing.  Where was this place?  What was going on?  How was she going to get out of this?  What to do next?  I have not found these feelings to abate during further viewings.While there are a few scary moments, I don't find them nearly as scary as the ... queen in Sleeping Beauty or the the forest scene in Snow White.  I think kids of all ages would really enjoy it.  (You might want to watch it first anyway and judge whether it might be too advanced or too scary for the little ones.)The biggest mistake would be to think this is just for kids.  It's amazing.

If you're gonna dub a movie, at least use the original dialogue translated literally, but with SOME alterations for fluity.However, the movie is still worth a view, as it's still brilliant and can beat any Disney movie with great lengths. I've got my fingers crossed hoping that it'll win the 2003 Oscar for ""Best animated movie""!As for the animation, it's in Ghibli Studios' standard style. Think ""My Neighbour Totoro"", only with better drawing and coloring techniques. But if you want real-life like anime, then you're out of luck. The animation is brilliant in its own special way, though.As for the part where Americans parents rant on and on about how scary the movie was: Oh, put a sock in it, will ya'! I was outraged when I found out that Americans parents wanted ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" banned from TV just because season 6 had a few love scenes! For a country that's supposed to stand for freedom and intelligence, the parents are quite naive. They raise the children in such a bad way that they get scared by ""Spirited Away"", which I personally wouldn't have found scary when I was 6-10. (I'm 17 now)Yes, the movie does start off slowly and you do sit there sometimes and ask yourself ""What the heck just happened here?"", but once it starts getting good, it only gets better!Definitely worth a view if you want a movie that's not the typical ""Big scary monsters to fight, boy and girl, boy and girl of course fall in love, everything is fine and dandy all the way through, no good guys harmed greatly, super-happy ending""-movie (you know, the way that ALL Disney movies have been ever since the very 1st, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (learn to spell, Disney!)).

I was thrilled afterwards that I was able to see Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi before the film dissappeared. Shame on Disney for not doing more promotion for this film. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi was the highest grossing film in Japanese history, making even more money than Titanic. Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi is the story of a little girl named Chihiro who stumbles on an empty amusement park with her parents. When her parents take food which doesn't belong to them from a vendor stand, they are turned into pigs. Chihiro quickly finds out the amusement park is really a spa for Japanese spirits. She is forced into slavery and must work in a bath house run by a witch named Yubaba. During the course of the film Chihiro goes through a journey of self discovery and learns valuable lessons about respect, honor and self reliance. It is only after learning these lessons that Chihiro is able to free her parents and herself. The animation is a stunning combination of hand drawn images and computer animation.

I think it is so interesting how the characters' eyes are so big, and their emotions are so obvious without them speaking of it.  My favorite Japanese animtation books/movies are stories where the main character(s) use(s) magic to save the day!  This movie was not only jam packed with magic, and made with beautiful animation, but the characters were so memorable, and the story really pulled you in!I waited months after getting this movie to actually watch it, because despite all the rewards it received, I thought it looked kind of boring.  But when I watched it, all two hours and five minutes of it, I was still waiting for more!  The story was always exciting and kept me in anticipation.  It was full of action, magic, romance, friendship, and even a tiny little bit of comedy.If you have loved Hayao Miyazaki's past movies, love Japanese animation, or just want a good movie to watch, I would highly recommend this movie to you!",5,My Favorite Movie,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,966,"['love', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'think', 'so', 'interesting', 'how', 'characters', 'eyes', 'are', 'so', 'big', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'obvious', 'speaking', 'My', 'favorite', 'Japanese', 'animtation', 'books/movies', 'are', 'stories', 'where', 'main', 'character', 's', 'use', 's', 'magic', 'save', 'day', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'jam', 'packed', 'magic', 'made', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'memorable', 'story', 'really', 'pulled', 'waited', 'months', 'getting', 'movie', 'actually', 'watch', 'rewards', 'received', 'thought', 'looked', 'kind', 'boring', 'when', 'watched', 'two', 'hours', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'still', 'waiting', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'exciting', 'kept', 'anticipation', 'was', 'full', 'action', 'magic', 'romance', 'friendship', 'even', 'tiny', 'little', 'bit', 'comedy.If', 'have', 'loved', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'past', 'movies', 'love', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

Writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki, is responsible for animated classics such as ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service.""  That's not to also mention perhaps the greatest animated feat since Disney's ""Fantasia,"" ""Princess Mononoke.""  At the 2003 Academy Awards his movie ""Spirited Away"" received the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, with help from well over 100 top-ten lists from some of today's most well known critics.Chihiro is the typical ten-year-old; especially when it comes to moving to a new house and a new way of life.  Already frightened and unsure about the future Chihiro is confronted with a new challenge when her father misses the turnoff to their new home and winds up at the entrance of a seemingly abandon theme park.""It's an abandon theme park . . . they built them everywhere in the early nineties.  Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt.  This must be one of them . . .""Dusk approaches as Chihiro's parents decide to investigate.  They cross a long field of grass and soon pickup on the scent of food lingering in the air.  After several minutes of looking they find several steaming dishes of food at a counter. Chihiro's parents decide to help themselves, even at the requests of Chihiro to leave.  Paying no attention to her Chihiro decides to go for a walk and shortly after runs into the mysterious young character, Haku, who hastily insists that she leave before dark.  But it is too late.  Large, ghostlike shadows begin to appear out of encroaching dusk.  Chihiro runs to where her parents are eating only to find two enormous pigs where her parents once sat.  Horrified, Chihiro calls out their names to no avail.  She tries to run away, only to find the field she had crossed earlier, is now a lake.It is here that Chihiro encounters an enchanting new world that will test her own abilities, and make light of the ones within her.I know most folks are thinking this is another one of them ""coming of age"" stories.  And maybe you're right.  But you're wrong to grade ""Spirited Away"" by same criteria as the Hollywood same-old-same-old.  Yes, the movie is animated, which probably sends most people's thoughts of the movie straight to the ""kiddie realm,"" and I'd have to say you're wrong again.  Hayao Miyazaki is heavily credited for re-inventing the definition of animation.  Though his characters are drawn, the essence they encapsulate is so much more than people give credit for.  His stories are deep, enthralling, and touching.  They strike at the very chord of human imagination, and all its capacities.After the first five minutes of this movie, I forgot I was watching ""cartoon"" characters and began to see them as real people; which ironically happens in just about all of Miyazaki's films.  Miyazaki redefines the genre of animation by giving thought into every aspect of his work.  The backgrounds are rich in detail and deep in soul. Every shot has been specifically placed to tell the story in its amazing entirety.  In fact Miyazaki personally checks and re-checks every drawing that will be placed in the final cut. Animation allows the plot to shine and Miyazaki's original concepts to surface in a way that has never been done before.  This is a man that takes pride in his work, and it is a fact that is strongly evident in every epic he creates.Although the movie places a strong emphasis on entertaining the younger crowd, several subtle messages are placed in various points throughout the film.  One example would be that of the character No Face who offers those in the bathhouse with gold.  We later find that No Face is actuality a monster who eats other spirits.  I believe this is representative of opportunities that are too good to be true.  If you're not careful they'll take you down with them.  Also, Kamaji, the boiler room man, at first tries to dissuade Chihiro from getting a job by proclaiming that there are none left.  However, we find that Chihiro's adherent persistence eventually gets her a job.  And perhaps the most evident is that of Chihiro signing away her name to the witch Yubaba for a job.  Yubaba gives her the name Sen, and as we work our way through the film we find that Chihiro begins to forget her old name until she is helped by Haku.  In this way symbolizing the thought that we must never forget who we are, regardless of circumstance.With this movie Hayao Miyazaki has again teamed up with famous Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi.  Hisaishi does a great job at articulating screen to sheet; every note resonates with the essence of the movie.  I heartily believe that the movie could not have reached its full potential without the musical direction of Mr. Hisaishi.This is an excellent DVD set worthy of any cinematic collection that strives for greatness.  By far this is the best-marketed and extra-featured DVD that any of Miyazaki's movies have enjoyed in the states.But perhaps the most enjoyable feature is the Nippon Television Special - The Making of The Film (Spirited Away) on the bonus disc.  The television special shows the inner workings of the Studio Ghibli animation company.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound gives a more lifelike feel to the film, and the included original Japanese language track is always on the checklist for hardcore anime fans.The only downside of the DVD set is the ""Spirited Away"" introduction by John Lasseter at the beginning of the movie.  Disney's last hope in taking some credit for Hayao Miyazaki's work.  Ah, but I digress the movie speaks for more than itself and is one of the finer things in life that make it so enjoyable.Miyazaki San, you never cease to amaze . . .",5,Another Masterpiece from

Even when the movie released in the theatres I didn't pay much attention to it. In 2003, I was watching the Oscars, and I discovered this movie won an award for the best animated feature. Curious to find out more about this movie, I decided to rent it and take a look at it. After watching ""Spirited Away"", I was in complete awe. This was one of the best animated movies that I had even seen!""Spirited Away"" is the story about a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new home with her parents. However, her father takes a `short-cut' during the trip, and somehow they end up in an abandoned theme park. While strolling through the park, Chihiro's parents smell something delicious, and find out that the restaurants in the parks are filled with mouth-watering food. They start gobbling up the food, while Chihiro gets worried, thinking that they are in big trouble. Soon the weather starts changing and Chihiro starts seeing apparitions walking around the park. Terrified, Chihiro runs to her parents to get out of the place, but is horrified to see that they have turned into pigs. She soon finds that she is now in a completely different world where the spirits walk the Earth, and through the help of her new found friend Haku, she has to survive in this strange land.The main reasons why I liked this movie is because of:i) (M)iyazaki's wonderful story: I would have never been introduced to watching Miyazaki's other movies if I had not seen this.ii) (A)dventure: From cleaning the stinking River God, and taking care of `No Face', to her train journey in the end, this movie was filled with excitement and adventure.iii) (G)reat Story: In a way, this movie is like `Alice in Wonderland'. Both the movies talk about a depressed and bored girl, who is suddenly transported into this strange fantasy world, where everything is different, and tries to find their way back. However, even though there are some similarities, I wouldn't call one a copy of another, because `Spirited Away' has a completely different charm to it, and is unique in its own way.iv) (I)ntrigue: The story of this movie is very surreal, revolving around strange and mysterious characters (such as No Face) that keep us entertained.v) (C)olorful: The animation for this movie is wonderful. It is like a breath of fresh air from other animated movies.vi) (A)dequate Translation: I saw the English version of the movie, and didn't find it too bad. Daveigh Chase did a good job of giving voice to Chihiro, as did Suzanne Pleshette, Susan Egan and Jason Marsden for the other charactersvii) (L)ovely Background Score: Music plays an integral part in any movie, and the score for this movie is amazing.The first letter of the above 7 points describes the whole movie in one word: MAGICAL (which it is).

Nevertheless, the beauty and wonder of Spirited Away can not be denied.  The plot of a girl making her way without her parents has been done before, but Miyazaki proves the tale can still be fresh.  Chihiro/Sen is a wonderful character: a petulant and occasionally bratty child who becomes brave and learns to rely on herself in a dangerous and strange world.  I also appreciated her sweet romance with Haku, a young man who helps her and soon turns out to be much more than he seems.  But not only Haku, Chihiro ends up facing many strange and wonderful creatures in the witch's bathouse.  A lake God polluted beyond recognition, a many-armed man who works the heaters, an enormous baby who is turned into a mouse ...All of these characters and this world is created lovingly by Miyazaki.  The animation, which remains mostly hand-drawn, is a wonder to behold.  The characters move so fluidly and realistically, and the designs of some of the gods is unlike any seen before.  After watching this film, the viewer feels like they have journeyed through an entirely new world.  It's amazing.The movie also features a beautiful score that's both magical and haunting.  I loved it.DVD features for the movie are also top-notch.  My favorite was the ""Making of"" which gave a look at the animation process in Japan and a glimpse of Miyazaki in action.

Disney.Who gives a damn?Anyway, ""Spirited Away"" follows the story of Chihiro (AKA Sen) as she is separated from her parents during their move to a new town, and her subsequent adventures in the Spirit World. Along the way she makes some friends, defeats some enemies and tries her hardest to be reunited with Mom and Dad, and get home.The first and most important thing about ""Spirited Away"" is the quality of the storyline. In my opinion, it fulfills more of the ""Kids-Movies-For-Adults"" criteria than any of the Harry Potters to date, becuase of the truly universal themes contained therein - love, loss, family bonds, friendship - and becuase of the innate charm and beautifully-crafted characterisation of the characters. Chihiro is a plucky and adventurous girl, Haku is her straight-laced mystical counterpart, Yubaba is perhaps the most enjoyable villainess since Disney's Maleficent. The story unfolds with a total lack of pretension and a gentle, yet enthralling, pace, and the whole shebang moves with such an elegant and effortless grace that we are begging to be taken along for the ride.Animation-wise, if ""Shrek 2"" is the current king of CGI, then the hand-drawn crown absolutely must go to ""Spirited Away"". The first thing we notice is the glorious colour of the Spirit world, the hodgepodge of western and eastern architectural styles and the straight-from-a-child's-imagination renderings of Yubaba and her consort Gods are all flawless in their movement. Hand-drawn animation may be a dying art form, but with such a brilliant and beautiful swan song as this, it will never be forgotten. Even those of us without an understanding of the Hand-Drawn animation process can only sit back and be amazed at the quality and clarity of Chihiro, Haku, Yubaba et al. Landscapes and interiors chew on the scenery all by themselves, and provide a visually enthralling stage against which the wonderful players tell us the story.To wonder if our children will enjoy ""Spirited Away"" is, I believe, an insult to their powers of imagination and cognition - this is a timeless and classic tale full of familiar themes and top-notch characters, and, when it's done with such an endearing naivete, I'd never once hesitate to recommend ""Spirited Away"" to the parents of any child, any age, and from any culture.A classic that must be seen to be understood, and thoroughly recommended.",5,Stunning and Moving,1093132800,"08 22, 2004",2004,2428,"['Anime', 'Vs.', 'Disney', 'Anime', 'Vs.', 'Disney', 'Anime', 'Vs.', 'Disney.Who', 'damn', 'Anyway', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'story', 'Chihiro', 'AKA', 'Sen', 'separated', 'parents', 'move', 'new', 'town', 'subsequent', 'adventures', 'Spirit', 'World', 'way', 'friends', 'enemies', 'hardest', 'be', 'reunited', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'get', 'home.The', 'first', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'quality', 'storyline', 'opinion', 'more', 'Kids-Movies-For-Adults', 'criteria', 'Harry', 'Potters', 'date', 'becuase', 'truly', 'universal', 'themes', 'contained', 'therein', 'love', 'loss', 'family', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'becuase', 'innate', 'charm', 'beautifully-crafted', 'characterisation', 'characters', 'Chihiro', 'plucky', 'adventurous', 'girl', 'Haku', 'straight-laced', 'mystical', 'counterpart', 'Yubaba', 'perhaps', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'villainess', 'Disney', 'Maleficent', 'story', 'total', 'lack', 'pretension', 'gentle', 'yet', 'enthralling', 'pace', 'whole', 'shebang', 'moves', 'such', 'elegant', 'effortless', 'grace', 'are', 'begging', 'be', 'taken', 'along', 'ride.Animation-wise', 'Shrek', '2', 'current', 'king', 'CGI', 'then', 'hand-drawn', 'crown', 'absolutely', 'must', 'go', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'glorious', 'colour', 'Spirit', 'world', 'hodgepodge', 'western', 'eastern', 'architectural', 'styles', ""straight-from-a-child's-imagination"", 'renderings', 'Yubaba', 'consort', 'Gods', 'are', 'flawless', 'movement', 'Hand-drawn', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'dying', 'art', 'form', 'such', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'swan', 'song', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Even', 'understanding', 'Hand-Drawn', 'animation', 'process', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'amazed', 'quality', 'clarity', 'Chihiro', 'Haku', 'Yubaba', 'al', 'Landscapes', 'interiors', 'chew', 'scenery', 'provide', 'visually', 'enthralling', 'stage', 'wonderful', 'players', 'tell', 'story.To', 'wonder', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'believe', 'insult', 'powers', 'imagination', 'cognition', 'timeless', 'classic', 'tale', 'full', 'familiar', 'themes', 'top-notch', 'characters', 'when', 'done', 'endearing', 'naivete', ""'d"", 'never', 'once', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'parents', 'child', 'age', 'culture.A', 'classic', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'understood', 'thoroughly', 'recommended']",N/A

598708,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00005JLET,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[2, 2]","There is so much that could be said about Hayao Miyazaki's incredible tale of a little girl lost in a new world, it's difficult to even know where to begin. Since others have already said so much, I'll try to keep it short.&quot;Spirited Away&quot; has all the ingredients of a classic fairy tale, but told using a modern medium. In just over two hours, it accomplishes the admirable goal of establishing a new world, one experienced for the first time by the young human girl Chihiro, later called Sen. As first her parents are changed, so Chihiro changes as she learns how best to adapt to this new environment, though Chihiro is changed in far more subtle (and perhaps more permanent) ways.Comparisons to L. Frank Baum's &quot;Oz&quot; series, or perhaps even more, Lewis Carroll's &quot;Alice&quot; books, are entirely apt. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; shares the best elements of those classic stories: frightening situations, mysterious characters, a sense of humor, and an unquenchable sense of wonder and magic. As Chihiro adapts to and comes to terms with this strange new place and the new people she has to interact with, we are given a rare treat... a glimpse into something we've never seen before, through the eyes and sensibilities of a child.The DVD presentation is even better than expected, with excellent image and sound reproduction. What's more, the second DVD includes extras that are actually worth watching. In particular, the Nippon TV special includes some enticing segments showing Miyazaki working on &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; conveying his ideas to the rest of those working on the film. The DVD is well worth watching more than once, and will be a happy addition to my small (but growing) collection.What's best about the DVD, however, is unquestionably the film itself. Steeped in Japanese culture and mythology, and yet universal in its themes, it is a film which is worthy of the best tales we pass down to our children, and to our children's children. The story is unique, and yet it should have meaning for anyone who sees it, particularly those who remember with fondness the rare magic that a good story can weave.

They obviously need an imagination or two in order to appreciate this film. Chihiro's development from a sulky, complainsome girl into a strong-willed and friendly young woman is something that's amazing itself. Unlike most Disney films, Spirited Away has lots more than just one message in the film, and each one is more deeper than you'd think. For instance, I had explain to my MOTHER what all the junk and stuff spilling out from the Stink Spirit meant!I know a few people who dislike the whole thing with Kaonashi(No-Face) and the train trip. First of all, the whole deal with No-Face was that he wanted to enter Chihiro's heart, but he thought he could do it by offering her gold. He was just lonely; which was also the theme for the trip to the Sixth Station. All those faceless 'shadow people' looked like they were lonely too, and that whole scene with the little faceless girl watching the train pass by really gripped my heart for some reason.

598714,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLET,Roland E. Zwick,"[14, 20]","In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, ""Spirited Away,"" a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned ""amusement park"" that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la ""Carnival of Souls"").  After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that ""Spirited Away"" might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.  The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do.  For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?  The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that ""Spirited Away"" has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well.""Spirited Away"" offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care.",3,"a minority, dissenting view",1051920000,"05 3, 2003",2003,2877,"['Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'Oscar-winning', 'animated', 'feature', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'young', 'girl', 'name', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'stumble', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'out', 'be', 'mysterious', 'bathhouse', 'spirit', 'world', 'la', 'Carnival', 'Souls', 'parents', 'are', 'turned', 'pigs', 'young', 'girl', 'must', 'infiltrate', 'bathhouse', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'human', 'again', 'Chihiro', 'amazing', 'array', 'strange', 'exotic', 'creatures', 'abiding', 'there', 'whom', 'help', 'quest', 'whom', ""don't.No"", 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'deny', 'visual', 'splendor', 'wealth', 'imagination', 'have', 'gone', 'look', 'film', 'animators', 'have', 'created', 'entire', 'world', 'filled', 'inhabitants', 'defy', 'description', 'Moreover', 'elegance', 'backgrounds', 'fluidity', 'movement', 'provide', 'best', 'work', 'areas', 'animation', 'ever', 'offered', 'One', 'effort', 'especially', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'imagination', 'movies', 'premium', 'Therefore', 'feel', 'bit', 'ingrate', 'pointing', 'out', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'somewhat', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'filmmakers', 'opted', 'little', 'LESS', 'imagination', 'favor', 'little', 'more', 'discipline', 'storytelling', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'trying', 'dazzle', 'creativity', 'end', 'up', 'more', 'characters', 'subplots', 'film', 'can', 'reasonably', 'cope', 'story', 'often', 'arbitrary', 'nature', 'events', 'seem', 'unrelated', 'other', 'vying', 'attention', 'just', 'can', 'be', 'impressed', 'how', 'creative', 'everyone', 'trying', 'be', 'film', 'ramble', 'good', 'part', 'time', 'find', 'yearning', 'tighter', 'more', 'streamlined', 'narrative', 'help', 'keep', 'involved', 'addition', 'certain', 'lack', 'logic', 'most', 'film', 'making', 'question', 'why', 'certain', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'instance', 'why', 'would', 'bunch', 'spirits', 'be', 'so', 'concerned', 'eating', 'sleeping', 'making', 'money', 'riding', 'trains', 'etc.', 'rules', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'laid', 'down', 'rigorously', 'enough', 'understand', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'total', 'curmudgeon', 'criticizing', 'film', 'apparently', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'innumerable', 'critics', 'have', 'hailed', 'masterpiece', 'do', 'concede', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'moments', 'great', 'beauty', 'charm', 'more', 'compensate', 'rather', 'slow', 'pacing', 'excessive', 'length', 'haunting', 'trip', 'ghostly', 'train', 'perhaps', 'highlight', 'film', 'transcendent', 'moment', 'hints', 'how', 'great', 'rest', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'makers', 'not', 'felt', 'need', 'pad', 'out', 'story', 'so', 'consistently', 'Chihiro', 'spunky', 'poignant', 'noble', 'heroine', 'few', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'compelling', 'as', 'well', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'much', 'audience', 'gape', 'marvel', 'drama', 'make', 'really', 'care']",N/A
598715,A7FZ9X0B6QBS3,B00005JLET,Ronald E. Olivier,"[0, 0]","If you've ever enjoyed watching any incarnation of Lewis Carroll's &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; or &#34;Through the Looking Glass&#34;, then you will absolutely LOVE this film from Hayao Miyazaki.  Though this movie has a similar feel to the Carroll classics, with characters exploring alternate realities filled with wondrous beings and events, I think that Spirited Away is far more complex, interesting, and appealing.The film centers on Chihiro, who's introduced as a whiny fussbudget of a 10-year old girl who's family is moving to a new home.  Her father takes a wrong turn en route and comes across a tunnel in a building.  He and her mom decide to investigate, much to Chihiro's chagrin.  I watched her reaction - a growing anxiety - and immediately saw the very actions of my own daughter  reacting to things that frightened her when she was younger.  I was amazed at the detail of the animation...and I was hooked.The remainder of the film - clocking in at almost two hours - was no less enthralling.  Once through the tunnel, Chihiro's mom and dad follow their curiousity (and their appetite) to an abandoned theme park's food court, while Chihiro timidly explores some the rest of the park.  It begins to get late and the darkness comes, and everything changes - including her parents who have been turned into hogs!The rest of the movie explores the world that Chihiro has unwittingly stumbled into.  It's a spiritual realm centered in a bath house where the spirits come and go.  Yet as fanciful and interesting as these characters are, it is Chihiro that remains the centerpiece around which the rest of the story revolves.  She must be careful not to lose her identity, and must endure in order to transform her mom and dad back to human form.  Unlike Alice, Chihiro grows in confidence and courage as the film progresses.Part of what makes this film work so well is that the viewer can put aside any prejudice as to which characters are 'good' and which are 'evil'.  Few characters, if any, can be so simply pigeonholed.  A good example is Haku, who befriends Chihiro but also is a flunkie who does the dirty work for his boss, Yubaba.  Even Yubaba, the closest thing to a villain in the film, doesn't fit neatly into that role.And despite this being a film &#34;aimed at 10 year-old girls&#34;, it has a lot to say about things like greed, ecology, gluttony, friendship, and love (true sacrificial love, not starry-eyed romance) that adults can appreciate.  But, unlike so many recent animated movies, the movie is not schizophrenic in it's presentation of these things.  Things are not 'built into' the story to keep the adults attention.  There is simply one story being told here, one that is simple enough for 10-year old, yet deep enough to appeal to any age or maturity level.  The result is a masterpiece that is worth seeing over and over.",5,Beautiful and engrossing.

SPIRITED AWAY may receive additional recognition now that its director (and Studio Ghibili's co-founder) Hayao Miyazaki has announced his last film. Many critics consider SPIRITED AWAY to be scrumtrulescent--the zenith of animated cinematography and story telling.SPIRITED AWAY is suited mainly to the younger and more imaginative viewing crowd. Those more advanced in years who have become accustomed to more traditional film may be put off. Or, in the words of my parents, ""this is the weirdest thing I have ever seen"".Writer and director Miyazaki ties in rich and deep meaning throughout the film; much of that meaning is full of symbolism more easily recognized in Japanese culture. Even so, most creative-minded audience members will still appreciate the various spirits: wind, river, and even turnip. Some of these elements lend themselves to a more scary nature and may frighten a younger audience. Parents be warned, just because Walk Disney Pictures brought this film into the States and dubbed English speaking actors into the film does not mean it's not scary--much of it is.Personally, much of this film was lost on me--until I sought out articles that defined the hidden meanings. Yes, this film is beautiful and irresistible to watch, but the story is incomplete without fully understanding all of its underlying connotations.

Miyazaki is, for me, the epitome of Japanese animation and the undisputed master of his craft. He fills the screen with minute details, doing most of the painstaking animation by hand in an age of computer animation (see Disney). His films are always unique both in visual style and in plot, expressing lost mythologies, alternate worlds, and the spirits that surround us. In Japan anime is not only for children, a concept which Western audiences have difficulty understanding. These are more than mere cartoons; they are explorations of self, nature, and in some ways Japanese society (there are frequently Japanese elements in many of Miyazaki&#65533;s films although most are set in fictitious places).&#65533;Spirited Away&#65533; tells the lovely story of Chihiro, a ten-year-old Japanese girl that is moving to a new town. Along the way the family stops to explore a mysterious tunnel that turns out to be a pathway into an alternate world filled with gods, witches and strange creatures. Chihiro&#65533;s parents are transformed into large pigs as punishment for their gluttony (there are frequently morals in Miyazaki&#65533;s tales as well), and Chihiro begins work for the witch Yubaba while desperately trying to find a cure for her parents before they are eaten (!). She befriends Haku, a mysterious boy whom she feels some past connection to, and together the two attempt to overthrow the tyrannical reign of Yubaba.A gorgeous film, with a beautiful soundtrack by frequent Miyazai collaborator Joe Hisaishi (&#65533;Princess Mononoke,&#65533; &#65533;Kiki&#65533;s Delivery Service,&#65533; &#65533;Totoro&#65533;).

598727,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JLET,Sebastian Fernandez,"[3, 3]","There are many outstanding aspects about this film that contribute to place it among the best anime productions I have seen in my life. It all starts with the animation, since the attention to detail in Miyazaki's work is seldom experienced. I could not help gasping when in one of the scenes I saw the perfect reflection of Chihiro on the window of a train in which she was traveling. These are the kind of details that give the production a realism that is really hard to find. The second crucial element is the story itself, which is proof of a prodigious imagination, and which without a doubt can be experienced several times without generating boredom in the spectator. Finally, and maybe this is the most striking aspect of all, this is a movie that can be appreciated by audiences of all ages, because there is something to take away for everyone. I can only imagine how interesting it will be for my daughter to watch this film as a kid, teenager and adult, since there are things to discover at each level of maturity.Chihiro, the main protagonist of the story, is a ten-year-old girl who is moving with her parents to a new city. She is the typical kid nearing adolescence, and therefore, is unhappy with the world, her parents in particular, and shows no interest in anything. When looking for their new house, a wrong turn leads them to a mysterious place that looks like an abandoned theme park, but when night falls quicker than expected, Chihiro finds herself all alone in a world full of spirits. There are no words to describe the astounding magical world in which she is immersed, and the transformation the character undergoes is as mesmerizing as it is revealing.When a few years ago I watchedPrincess MononokeI thought I had experienced Miyazaki at the top of his game, but this film gives it a run for its money. Bottom line is that both works should be required watching for every fan of the genre. People that are looking for an introduction to anime can find no better place to start than with ""Spirited Away"". The only drawback is that it will create a tough benchmark for future experiences to match.In terms of the Extras, the disc that has the film, also has a piece on the Art of Spirited Away, where Miyazaki shares some of the ""secrets"" behind his inspiration and peers and coworkers talk about the wonderful qualities of this magnificent director. In most cases I would say that the praise was scripted and disregard it as such, but in this case it really rings true, and it is entertaining and insightful to watch. This segment also includes commentary on the challenges faced with the translation, and on the steps that were put in place to conserve the original intent of the film. This is extremely important, especially in the anime / manga genre, where sadly, lousy translations that mangle the product are not uncommon.The Extras in the additional disc were not really worth watching, and I felt like they were there just as a way to make this a two-disc edition. Nevertheless, the rest of the product is so outstanding that I could not bring myself to lower my rating.",5,"""What happened to my spell?

Unfortunately many Americans have never heard of this wonderful film.The recent imports of Anime (animation from Japan) such as Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh and Digimon, have given American audiences an incorrect image of anime. In many cases these shows have been completely reworked for American audiences. As a result many of the rich and complex story lines are diluted down into fast moving action with little plot. It is no wonder many adults relegate Anime to children's cartoon.Luckily masters such as Hayao Miyazaki are still showing the amazing powers of animation. Spirited Away, arguably his best work ever, is the story of a young girl, Chihiro. She and her parents are moving to a new town. Along the way they take a wrong turn and end up in a spirit land. The center of this magical land is a giant bathhouse where the spirits come to realize and rejuvenate themselves. The bathhouse is run by Yubaba, a witch with again head, a giant mole, a giant baby and a twin sister. When Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, she must take a job in the bathhouse cleaning tubs in order to save herself from the same fate. Chihiro must overcome her fears and find the strength to save her parents and get them all home.The spirit world is populated with many fanciful creative the like of which we have not seen since Alice fell down the rabbit hole. But don't worry, extensive knowledge of the Japanese Religion Shintoism is not required to enjoy this film. Simply know that they believed everything had its own spirit from radishes to rivers.If you did not get a chance to see this movie in the theatre, this is your opportunity.

It is the best anime I have ever seen and it may just be the best movie I have ever seen.  I waited until the DVD release so that I could watch the version in Japanese, with subtitles.  Even my five-year-old brother, who can't read yet and is therefore usually bored when I watch anime, sat through the entire thing in Japanese several times and loved it.Chihiro is an average ten-year-old girl who is moving, and like most ten-year-old girls in this situation, doesn't want to.  She sits in the back of her car, depressed, when her father makes a wrong turn.  They enter a tunnel and go into a mysterious town, where her parents begin to eat the food.  Chihiro looks around a bit, and then a strange boy comes up to her, yelling at her, &quot;Get out of here!  It's almost night!  Go back across the river, hurry!&quot;  Chihiro runs back to her parents to find they have turned into pigs; it is getting dark and strange creatures are roaming about.  Naturally, she is frightened.  The boy, who is called Haku, tells her to find work with Kamaji, who in turn tells her to go to Yubaba, the witch that rules.  Chihiro gets work, and her name is changed to Sen.The journey that Sen/Chihiro embarks upon is amazing.  She meets the most interesting cast of characters, and by the end, has everyone on her side.  From Haku, who she feels a mysterious connection with, to the odd Kao-nashi (No-Face), the world is inhabited with the most interesting people and...creatures.  Chihiro's biggest journey is her journey as a person.  She becomes very different from who she was before.  I think this movie should be mandatory viewing for every young child before they can grow up into the &quot;sad&quot; young children of today.  (Okay, I'm not *that* old myself, but anyhow...)As for the younger set...parents should determine whether it would be scary or not for their child.  I think most children would be fine with it, but I would recommend parental viewing of this DVD first if you are unsure.

598732,A2AN988COWP49T,B00005JLET,Shiragami Hiromi,"[22, 24]","As a Japanese, I was totally fluttered by whom rated this film 5-stars and gave kind praises to it as if it is me who are praised. On the other hand, it saddens me a little that there are some people who don't like it at all. But can't complain, I guess, as it would be natural thing.Interestingly, though, most of those who say &quot;Didn't like it&quot; seem to just not understand the whole concept of the film that is, say, &quot;Japaneseness&quot;.Weird, odd and grotesque creatures? Well, some of them may be  Miyazaki's creations, but the most of them are not uncommon at all in Japanese forklores. We have a milliards of gods and spirits and monsters (most of them are harmless and good-hearted unless you are harmful to them!).While many of Japanese would say of themselves as non-religeous or rather nonchalant about religions, but, in fact, they are quite superstitious. I could say most of the Japanese are  animists deep down in their souls. (Existence of the souls is a priori here, by the way)Some years ago, then prime minister Mori said &quot;Japan is a gods' land.&quot;in a meeting of Shinto (it means &quot;gods' way&quot;) priests and stirred a controversy among the left-wingers in and outside of Japan because the phrase was interpreted as &quot;the Divine Land&quot; like in the Christianity's sense. This was unfortunate misunderstanding since, in Japan, mountains, rivers, trees, rocks, earth, and even cooking fire-places have gods in them. Virtually speaking, gods are everywhere. Gods mean the nature itself. So, Mr. Mori said only a matter of course about Japan.In Japan, children are (or, I might say, used to be) taught not to disturb or impurify those places or things or animals that have gods or spirits in them, or you may get a curse____ like Chihiro's parents did!It was interesting part of this film to me that Chihiro's Mother (and Father too, I guess) apparently had some knowledges about those gods' houses (Hokora, in Japanese), still, they felt nothing awesome about it. It was Chihiro, who was evidently  ignorant about those gods' stuff, lazy and self-centred modern day girl, that sensed something unearthly of them and felt a strong objection to intrude into the gods' domain, almost instinctively.That made me think about the national identity of the Japanese that, they say, many of us have lost since the defeat of the world war 2 because the American occupation policy denied &quot;Japanese spirit&quot;, that is much based on this somekind of religious feelings every Japanese could have at the bottom of their hearts, as a dangerous thought and tried to wipe it out so that  the &quot;saucy&quot; Japanese would never stand up against America.Maybe you could say that Chihiro's parents are typical of post-war Japanese who have been educated in that left-tilted, sort of self-denying way.But, thankfully, it has certainly remained in hearts of us. Some of us, if not all of us. That is, I think, why this film moved the hearts of such a large number of audience in Japan. Especially the grown-ups who, I think, have searched everywhere and everyday for the &quot;Japanese spirit&quot; that they can identify with their own Japaneseness.Another significance of this film is that it has restored old virtues such as diligence, being free from avarice and respectful to your superiors, and courage those have been quite neglected recently. That is one main reason why I want my children to watch this film outside the fact that it is simplly a great fun and a joy for the eyes, although they (especially my youngest who was 4 when she saw this film for the first time in Japan) just admire it and watch it for a million times without telling to do so.By the way, I was shocked by a review with 1-star rating that says Chihiro's work experience in the Bath House as a &quot;slavedom&quot;. It reminded me an English person accusing me of using my children like slaves when I asked them to help me do the household chore. When I was young, it was perfectly nomal for the children to help their parents, I admit it is not always true these days, though.Moreover, for the Japanese, working is not only for living but  rather high-minded thing to do, I would say. (At reast it was so just a decade ago until the &quot;bubble&quot; thing made everyone crazy.)Anyway, finding so many foreigners love this &quot;very Japanese&quot; film makes me almost cry. It means a lot to me. Knowing entire of other people are not disapproval of your cultural origin makes me so happy. That sense of tolerance would make the world much better place to live.Thank you all, and I am proud of you very much, Mr. Miyazaki.",5,"Weird? Grotesque?

I watched it again at fifteen, and I was terrified 20 minutes in. Okay...the story..Bratty Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town. Chihiro is notably annoyed and unhappy. When they get lost on the way and go through a weird tunnel they find, they find a theme park with delicious food on an abandoned stall which Chihiro's parents eat, planning to pay when the shopkeeper comes back. However, Chihiro refuses and walks off, stumbling upon a bathouse, and some boy of about 14, who tells her to leave. Chihiro immediately runs to her parents to find they are no longer humans. Hence comes the scary scene. My eight-year-old self wonders ""Who is this boy? What has he done?""Chihiro learns that she is in the world of spirits, where she is an inferior human. If she doesn't want to meet the same fate as her parents, she must get a job at the bathouse, as she learns from the boy, known as ""Haku"", although he later reveals that his real name was stolen. When Chihiro gets a job from the sorceress that rules the bathouse, Yubaba, she too loses her name, and her name, meaning ""a thousand questions"" changes to ""Sen"", meaning ""thousand"". Only then does Chihiro grow up and become a diligent caring young woman.My favourite thing about the movie by far is the relation between Chihiro and Haku.

598736,ABE14SVILZLNY,B00005JLET,"SID ""Punk""","[4, 4]","This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since ""Akira"" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the ""Stink Spirit"" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also.",5,Spirited Away,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,3072,"['considered', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'Anime', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'finest', 'Not', 'Akira', 'animated', 'film', 'made', 'impact', 'was', 'created', 'Japanese', 'animator', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'who', 'considered', 'god', 'terms', 'Anime', 'wonderful', 'stories', 'imagination', 'so', 'special', 'story', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Chihiro', 'who', 'traveling', 'parents', 'new', 'home', 'sad', 'have', 'move', 'father', 'what', 'wrong', 'turn', 'come', 'structure', 'tunnel', 'middle', 'get', 'out', 'walk', 'other', 'side', 'Chihiro', 'father', 'old', 'park', 'gone', 'years', 'come', 'structure', 'food', 'set', 'out', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'time', 'helping', 'as', 'much', 'food', 'can', 'eat', 'Chihiro', 'horror', 'mother', 'father', 'have', 'turned', 'pigs', 'try', 'find', 'help', 'boy', 'named', 'Haku', 'strange', 'world', 'where', 'spirits', 'witches', 'habitat', 'find', 'someone', 'named', 'Kamaji', 'ask', 'job', 'looked', 'down', 'human', 'find', 'Kamaji', 'who', 'eight', 'legs', 'spider', 'job', 'Chihiro', 'Lin', 'who', 'older', 'female', 'what', 'do', 'where', 'sleep', 'Chihiro', 'out', 'cleaning', 'delivering', 'night', 'talk', 'Haku', 'who', 'helping', 'get', 'parents', 'back', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'home.Miyazaki', 'broad', 'sense', 'imagination', 'reflected', 'other', 'films', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'film', 'probably', 'even', 'greater', 'two', 'film', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Animated', 'Feature', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'One', 'joys', 'watching', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'characters', 'events', 'take', 'viewer', 'strange', 'fantastic', 'voyage', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'witch', 'giant', 'baby', 'named', 'Boh', 'Haku', 'flying', 'dragon', 'Kamaji', 'dustball/spider', 'things', 'carry', 'lumps', 'coal', 'furnace', 'everything', 'One', 'big', 'highlights', 'film', 'Stink', 'Spirit', 'giant', 'glob', 'river', 'mud', 'Chihiro', 'get', 'clean', 'pull', 'junk', 'Bicycles', 'assorted', 'metal', 'etc..', 'see', 'what', 'spirit', 'really', 'type', 'animated', 'feature', 'children', 'should', 'view', 'not', 'knock', 'American', 'animated', 'films', 'Japanese', 'concern', 'more', 'stories', 'Children', 'should', 'view', 'films', 'will', 'enhance', ""'re"", 'imagination', 'unfortunately', 'most', 'crap', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'usually', 'something', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Miyazaki', 'had', 'plans', 'make', 'film', 'happily', 'working', 'one', 'great', 'animated', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'children', 'adults', 'will', 'love', 'also']",N/A

Nakajima's Spotlight review was for this wonderful movie (great idea to give tips for non-Japanese viewers!), he made an error in his Tip #4, Haku's real name.And as I love Haku's gentle (JAPANESE) character too much, and Chihiro and Haku's relationship is so vital to the story, I had to correct it and add additional insight. (Also Disney BUTCHERED the English version giving Haku a commercialized ""Hi! I announce the rides at Disneyland!"" voice with butchered dubbing....sob).OK! So the correction:""[4] Haku's real name is ""Migihayami Kohakusui."" All the Japanese audience, as Chihiro in fact was, would be surprised to hear this long and old-fashioned name, which clearly suggests his ancient and aristocratic origin.""This is incorrect.Haku's real name is.. (drum roll please...) NIGIHAYAMI KOHAKUNUSHI.(nee-gi-ha-ya-mee ko-ha-ku-nu-shi)And he is, in case you missed it, a river god. Nushi, in Japanese denotes deities and spirits. Haku was the god that protected the Kohaku river until (urban development) filled the river and it was no longer. See Miyazaki's message here?Chihiro tells Haku that her mother once told her that she fell into a river when she was a child. She remembers this when she clings onto Haku's horns (when he is in dragon form). It brings back the memory of when she fell in the river and Haku guided her back to shore, saving her life. She says the river no longer exists because they built apartment complexes over it (in Japanese, called ""mansions""), but that the river was called.. the Kohaku river (Kohaku-gawa, ""kawa/gawa"" = Japanese for river).There is a fan on the web who managed to transcribe Haku's entire name to be ""Master of the peaceful and swift-flowing small white river."" (...) which I think is pretty close to the fact. Haku, means White, in Japanese. Plus I mentioned the Disney travesty for more than one reason. The original Japanese voice for Haku, is that of a YOUNG boy (well, young ""god"" boy). Haku, is a young river spirit, as far as spirit years go, hence he is a young boy in human form.It would be worthwhile to see the subtitled version of this movie, as even not understanding Japanese, you may catch the softer inflections in his voice when he speaks to Chihiro, and also enjoy Chihiro's young, NON-whiny voice.",5,"* Haku's name was NIGIHAYAMI KOHAKUNUSHI, and he was a river god.",1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2305,"['Sorry', 'as', 'great', 'thought', 'T.', 'Nakajima', 'Spotlight', 'review', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'great', 'idea', 'give', 'tips', 'non-Japanese', 'viewers', 'made', 'error', 'Tip', '4', 'Haku', 'real', 'name.And', 'love', 'Haku', 'gentle', 'JAPANESE', 'character', 'too', 'much', 'Chihiro', 'Haku', 'relationship', 'so', 'vital', 'story', 'had', 'correct', 'add', 'additional', 'insight', 'Also', 'Disney', 'BUTCHERED', 'English', 'version', 'giving', 'Haku', 'commercialized', 'Hi', 'announce', 'rides', 'Disneyland', 'voice', 'butchered', 'dubbing', '.sob', '.OK', 'correction', '4', ']', 'Haku', 'real', 'name', 'Migihayami', 'Kohakusui', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'Chihiro', 'fact', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'hear', 'long', 'old-fashioned', 'name', 'clearly', 'ancient', 'aristocratic', 'origin', 'incorrect.Haku', 'real', 'name', 'is..', 'drum', 'roll', 'please', 'NIGIHAYAMI', 'KOHAKUNUSHI', 'nee-gi-ha-ya-mee', 'ko-ha-ku-nu-shi', 'case', 'missed', 'river', 'god', 'Nushi', 'Japanese', 'denotes', 'deities', 'spirits', 'Haku', 'was', 'god', 'protected', 'Kohaku', 'river', 'urban', 'development', 'filled', 'river', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'See', 'Miyazaki', 'message', 'here', 'Chihiro', 'Haku', 'mother', 'once', 'told', 'fell', 'river', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'when', 'Haku', 'horns', 'when', 'dragon', 'form', 'back', 'memory', 'when', 'fell', 'river', 'Haku', 'guided', 'back', 'shore', 'saving', 'life', 'river', 'no', 'longer', 'built', 'apartment', 'complexes', 'Japanese', 'called', 'mansions', 'river', 'was', 'called..', 'Kohaku', 'river', 'Kohaku-gawa', 'kawa/gawa', 'Japanese', 'river', 'fan', 'web', 'who', 'managed', 'transcribe', 'Haku', 'entire', 'name', 'be', 'Master', 'peaceful', 'swift-flowing', 'small', 'white', 'river', 'think', 'pretty', 'close', 'fact', 'Haku', 'White', 'Japanese', 'mentioned', 'Disney', 'travesty', 'more', 'one', 'reason', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'Haku', 'YOUNG', 'boy', 'well', 'young', 'god', 'boy', 'Haku', 'young', 'river', 'spirit', 'as', 'far', 'spirit', 'years', 'go', 'hence', 'young', 'boy', 'human', 'form.It', 'would', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'see', 'subtitled', 'version', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'understanding', 'Japanese', 'may', 'catch', 'softer', 'inflections', 'voice', 'when', 'Chihiro', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Chihiro', 'young', 'NON-whiny', 'voice']",N/A

I originally went with some trepidation, because while I'm a huge animation buff, I've never cared much for anime. I went to see Akira in the middle of its hype, and walked out shaking my head, muttering ""All style, no substance. Depth of a puddle."" I've since had others tell me Akira was overrated. I'm inclined to believe them.Anyhow, Spirited Away changed my mind forever. Saw it twice in the theater, and bought the DVD the minute it ame out. What a gorgeous film. Distrubing images? Certainly. Like ANY good fairy tale. Snow White, Pinocchio, Alice In Wonderland, Oz-these all contain bits of nightmare. But it's ""Good Scary"" as opposed to mindless fright.Is the movie confusing? Only if you need to have plot lines and characters telegraphed to you. If you don't like to think about a movie, by all means, run screaming from Spirited Away. But if you  enjoy immersing yourself in a fully formed alternate reality, this is your flick.And what a wonderful message. Chihiro only begins to triumph when she sets herself aside, and sacrifices for the sake of others. Some of the imagery of her sacrifice (Haku's purging of the blackness inside) is spirituality of a high order.I can understand why serious anime fans might be able to nitpick this movie. It's the same with anyone who's deeply into a subject matter. But, if you're a film fan, especially one new to anime, this is a masterwork, pure and simple.

O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","Probably the most famous Studio Ghibli anime, ""Spirited Away"" is one of Ghibli's best, a magical, moving and just plain awesome tale that no movie fan should be without.  It features some of the most incredible animation ever put forward, some of the most fantastic animation ever brought to life, and some of the most memorable characters in movie history.Chihiro, an obstinate but lovable little girl, is moving across the country (not to any great enthusiasm on her part) with her rather clueless parents when the family stops at what appear to be the ruins of an old shrine, for some sightseeing.  As they're entering this imposing place, only minutes into the film, ""Spirited Away"" will probably have already captivated you with its gorgeous visuals and its contrasting tones of whimsical/humorous and subtly foreboding darkness.  Inside the ruins, things are less...ruined....and there's a sumptuous feast laid out, which Chihiro's parents dig into with reckless abandon while Chiro herself wanders about nervously.  It turns out that there's reason to be nervous, for when dusk falls in this place, those inside it witness the coming of strange forms and then find themselves spirited away, out of this world and into a mysterious other.  Chihiro's parents transform into pigs and are corralled into pens, and Chihiro herself is pressed into labor by a sinister witch who rules a vast hostel for travelling entities in this new world, and is renamed Sen.Sen's prospects of escaping and freeing her parents appear bleak, but strange things can happen hear.  Befriended by a strange and knowledgable older boy named Haku, Sen finds unlikely allies whose virtues are merely buried under intimidating crusts.  All manner of bizarre beings pass in and out of the great bath house where Sen now labors, some of whom the ruling witch is as frightened of as are Sen and the other 'underlings'.  Odysseies and discoveries ensue that I don't want to even hint at, and the coming together of the oddest combinations of beings uncovers both goodness and sadness in the strangest places.A phenomenal movie.  Also recommended are ""Castle In The Sky"", ""Pom Poko"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service""...all of Ghibli's movies actually, although some, like the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" and the heart-wrenching wartime orphan drama ""Grave Of The Fireflies"", might not be the best picks for young children.

598747,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00005JLET,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","My Neighbor Totoro is my favorite Hayao Miyazaki film most days, but Spirited Away is on the same level. It's the best animated film ever to win an Oscar.So what elevates it from other great animation such as Pixar? It's a combination of many things.Miyazaki's animation feels different to anything else that I've experienced. It's detailed and complex, with well-developed characters, and it has heart. He creates lovable characters, but some have human flaws and they are more real than characters found in most animated fare.Spirited Away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro (Chase). Her parents are driving her to their new home and she's upset about leaving her friends behind. In fact, she's bratty and whines a lot. Her father drives down the wrong road and they end up in an abandoned amusement park. Although it's deserted, they can smell food. Chihiro's parents decide to take advantage of a free meal, but Chihiro doesn't. She's horrified to see them transform into pigs.While she is deciding what to do, a boy named Haku (Marsden) shows up and urges her to leave before it gets dark. She refuses to leave her parents so he decides to help her. Darkness brings a few changes and spirits appear. An area which appeared to be deserted is suddenly alive with light and chatter. Haku explains to Chihiro that she will never be allowed to leave unless she earns her place in the town. To do so, she must seek employment at the bath house.The bath house is run by Yubaba (Pleshette) and she's a formidable witch. But, with the help of Kamaji (Stiers), who takes care of the boiler, Chihiro is given a chance to find a job. She's assigned to Lin, who shows her what to do. Lin also tries to toughen Chihiro up and teach her to improve her sullen attitude and learn some manners. Spirited Away is a coming-of-age story in which Chihiro eventually becomes a happy, confident girl, capable of facing anything.The story is vast and quite complex for an animated film. Miyazaki doesn't rush things and takes a little over two hours to show Chihiro's story. It's aimed at an older audience than films such as Ponyo and My Neighbor Totoro, but it contains some of the beauty and innocence that's present in all Studio Ghibli films.Miyazaki's imagination is almost limitless. You'll meet witches, soot sprites, dragons, spirits, weird animals and a giant baby. I've sometimes heard people complain that they don't understand the story. If you just accept it as a fantasy where magic exists, it's really pretty easy to follow.The style of animation may be different from anything that you are used to. The image is two-dimensional and each frame looks like a watercolor painting. But take note of the amount of detail present in each frame. Some of it doesn't need to be there for the story to work, but it's a richer experience because it is present. When Chihiro nervously edges down a steep flight of stairs, look at the detail in the individual steps. When she puts her shoes on, there's a very human gesture that most animators wouldn't bother with. Spirited Away is clearly a labor of love and a work of art.If you give the film a try, you might find yourself hooked after about two minutes as I was. The look of the film and Joe Hisaishi's score set a mood immediately and draw you in. It's a slightly darker and more dangerous world than many Studio Ghibli settings, but you'll be reluctant to leave.",5,"Imagination, heart, beauty and innocence from Miyazaki",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3419,"['Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'favorite', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'most', 'days', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'same', 'level', 'best', 'animated', 'film', 'ever', 'win', 'Oscar.So', 'what', 'other', 'great', 'animation', 'such', 'Pixar', 'combination', 'many', 'things.Miyazaki', 'animation', 'feels', 'different', 'anything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'detailed', 'complex', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'heart', 'lovable', 'characters', 'have', 'human', 'flaws', 'are', 'more', 'real', 'characters', 'found', 'most', 'animated', 'fare.Spirited', 'Away', 'story', '10-year-old', 'girl', 'named', 'Chihiro', 'Chase', 'parents', 'are', 'driving', 'new', 'home', 'upset', 'leaving', 'friends', 'fact', 'bratty', 'lot', 'father', 'down', 'wrong', 'road', 'end', 'up', 'abandoned', 'amusement', 'park', 'deserted', 'can', 'smell', 'food', 'Chihiro', 'parents', 'decide', 'take', 'advantage', 'free', 'meal', 'Chihiro', ""n't"", 'horrified', 'see', 'transform', 'pigs.While', 'deciding', 'what', 'do', 'boy', 'named', 'Haku', 'Marsden', 'up', 'leave', 'dark', 'leave', 'parents', 'help', 'Darkness', 'few', 'changes', 'spirits', 'appear', 'area', 'appeared', 'be', 'deserted', 'suddenly', 'alive', 'light', 'chatter', 'Haku', 'Chihiro', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'allowed', 'leave', 'place', 'town', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'seek', 'employment', 'bath', 'house.The', 'bath', 'house', 'run', 'Yubaba', 'Pleshette', 'formidable', 'witch', 'help', 'Kamaji', 'Stiers', 'who', 'care', 'boiler', 'Chihiro', 'given', 'chance', 'find', 'job', 'assigned', 'Lin', 'who', 'what', 'do', 'Lin', 'also', 'toughen', 'Chihiro', 'up', 'teach', 'improve', 'sullen', 'attitude', 'learn', 'manners', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'Chihiro', 'eventually', 'happy', 'confident', 'girl', 'capable', 'facing', 'anything.The', 'story', 'vast', 'quite', 'complex', 'animated', 'film', 'Miyazaki', ""n't"", 'rush', 'things', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'show', 'Chihiro', 'story', 'aimed', 'older', 'audience', 'films', 'such', 'Ponyo', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'present', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'films.Miyazaki', 'imagination', 'almost', 'limitless', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'witches', 'soot', 'sprites', 'dragons', 'spirits', 'weird', 'animals', 'giant', 'baby', ""'ve"", 'sometimes', 'heard', 'people', 'complain', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'story', 'just', 'accept', 'fantasy', 'where', 'magic', 'really', 'pretty', 'easy', 'follow.The', 'style', 'animation', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'anything', 'are', 'used', 'image', 'two-dimensional', 'frame', 'watercolor', 'painting', 'take', 'note', 'amount', 'detail', 'present', 'frame', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'there', 'story', 'work', 'richer', 'experience', 'present', 'When', 'Chihiro', 'nervously', 'down', 'steep', 'flight', 'stairs', 'look', 'detail', 'individual', 'steps', 'When', 'shoes', 'very', 'human', 'gesture', 'most', 'animators', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'work', 'art.If', 'give', 'film', 'try', 'might', 'find', 'hooked', 'two', 'minutes', 'was', 'look', 'film', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'score', 'set', 'mood', 'immediately', 'draw', 'slightly', 'darker', 'more', 'dangerous', 'world', 'many', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'settings', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reluctant', 'leave']",N/A

I was quite disappointed.There is no denying that the animation is great. Everything is very nicely drawn. However the story is confusing. The story revolves around a young girl who becomes trapped in a magical world is spirits. I don't know where these spirits came from or what they do. It seems that this girl is constantly getting scared and running away from scary spirits. But the movie never explains why these spirits don't like humans. She befriends another young boy who turns into a dragon. How and why does he turn into a dragon? I'm so confused.This was the first anime movie I've ever watched. Perhaps Japanese people know more about Japanese stories and mythology and can fill in the gaps.

598757,A34RDZS6AKJRHR,B00005JLET,Theodore Csernica,"[3, 6]","I hardly need to enlarge on the praise already heaped on this film. It's almost impossible to exaggerate its visual quality, storytelling, characterization, and sheer mythopoeic sparkle.  But thank goodness the DVD has the original Japanese track and English subtitles done by translators other than those who worked on the dub.  The dub is simply awful.To begin with, the voice of one of the two younger principals is horribly miscast. For some reason, Disney thought it would be a good idea to cast an adult to voice a 12-year-old boy.  (He's actually ageless, but this is his usual form.) The voice does not match the character. If this was a compromise to get quality acting then they failed: quality acting is not what they got. Jason Mardsen as Haku is uniformly wooden.Daveigh Chase ought to have been an appropriate choice for Chihiro, and under other circumstances she might have done a creditable job. Her voice is certainly pleasant enough. But she whines her way through the entire movie even as the character is supposed to be growing past her whineyness.  With such a young actress the fault ought to be laid at the feet of whoever directed the English dub, since she simply can't be expected to have the life experience necessary to achieve an in-depth reading of a complex character on her own.So if the poor translation didn't serve to change the mood or sense of a scene, the actors often did, but no doubt they were often directed to do so.  The American director seemed more than willing to sacrifice portions of Miyazaki's vision to put his own imprint on the film. When you see the ""making of"" feature and understand the great care Miyazaki took to get just the right performance out of his actors, it's hard to see this as anything but vandalism of the crassest kind. If the director didn't do this deliberately, it's an incompetence this film did not merit.The dub is plagued with needless chatter.  It takes advantage of moments where the characters' mouths aren't visible to insert dialogue that adds nothing to the scene but rather destroys the mood it was setting.  It was annoying enough when Disney did this to Miyazaki's earlier ""Kiki's Delivery Service""; here it's positively jarring even though there's less of it. The added final line of the movie comes close to ruining it, if that was possible, as it reaches for an entirely inappropriate cheap laugh.Which brings me to the dub's translation.  I know that compromises occasionally have to be made to get the lip movements more or less in synch, but that's no excuse here.  Some of the English dialogue is so at variance with the original that a character's intent seems to be completely inverted at times, and entire scenes take on different meanings.However, not all the acting is bad and not all the translation is so discreditable.  David Ogden Stiers and Suzanne Pleshette turn in superb performances as the boiler man Kamaji and the twin witches respectively, even if inappropriate words were occasionally given to them to say.  I also know that some have objected to the translation of ""hanko"" as ""seal"" -- this is the mcguffin driving the second half of the film -- but I'd be hard-pressed to think of something more appropriate. (However, simply calling it ""magical"" is inadequate to explain its importance. Some cultural background is helpful here.)The subtitle translation is far superior, although even someone like myself who knows no Japanese beyond a handful of words can spot some changes. For example, at one point the subtitles have Haku addressing Kamaji by name when he can clearly be heard to be saying ""ojisan"", ""grandfather"".  This speaks volumes about their relationship, but it was just thrown away for some reason. (The same happens with Chihiro, but with her it matters less because she and Kamaji have enough screen time together that their relationship is understood.) However, being able to hear the fine work of the original actors more than makes up for any small deficiency along these lines.Why on earth does Disney think it necessary to insert a tedious ""introduction"" by John Lasseter at the beginning of every Miyazaki film it distributes?  Yes, the ""Skip"" button works here, but why should we have to do this every time we play every disc? It's an annoyance that doesn't have to be there.This movie cannot be truly appreciated in the Disney version, which might go some way toward explaining its poor performance in the American theatrical relsease. It deserves to be seen as Miyazaki made it.

598764,ALN0TTRTLHA4E,B00005JLET,"Tom Munro ""tomfrombrunswick""","[3, 3]","Spirited away is a Japanese animation about a 10 year old girl who travels with her parents to a new house. On the way they discover what seems to be an abandoned theme park, which the parents explore. It turns out to be a magic world, in which the young girl has to use her own rescources to initially survive and then to rescue her parents.The film is one of the most succesful Japanese films to be made in recent times. It is no surprise as not only is the story involving but the animation is beautiful. Rather than using computer generated graphics the film consists of the old style animation in which drawings are used to create the scene and movement of the characters. Each scene is carefully painted and the detail showing such things as the growth of moss on steps is painstaking.The film is also interesting as it is based on a mythology which is Japanese rather than Western. Whilst there are a couple of characters called witches, the Magic World is Japanese and features the eight million gods of the Buddist mythology. Somehow this makes the plot of the film totally unpredictable and no cliched. With Western story conventions, characters behave in stereotyped ways. Witches are evil, fairies are good. In this film the motives and actions of the characters are far more complex.After seeing the film some time ago and thinking about it the one thing which comes back though is the beauty of the animation.

598767,A1ICEZXI9PTCN3,B00005JLET,"""troytron""","[1, 1]","'Spirited Away' was the first Miyazaki film I had ever seen so, in a positve sense, I had none of his past work with which to compare it or to influence my opinion. It was recommended by a friend who is a fan of some of Miyazaki's films and also by the numerous radiant reviews I had seen in this latest film's regard. I was not disappointed. Immediately, without any preconceived notions derived from Miyazaki's prior works, I was captured by the sense of wonder evoked by Miyzaki-san's truly elegant and unique approach to animation. The motifs present in every frame, the peripheral details in his frames that really are *not* so peripheral, the simplicity yet relevance of his modern characters -- all of these things made for instant interest, and then outright enchantment. Miyazaki proved himself a maestro, a deft conductor of a well-assembled orchestra from the very first moments. Music, exceptional use of color, brooding angles, and restrained dialogue strike a simultaneous chord of melancholy from the first moments we glimpse the dilemma of Chihiro in the back-seat of the car as her family is obviously in ""transition."" Every sight and sound is calculated with care and delicacy as the story moves quickly to the point where the family's ""off-the-beaten-path"" detour takes them to a mysterious but beguling sanctuary (of sorts) in the middle of a woodland. There, Chihiro's parents decide to have a carefree look around the lonely ruins, while the child-figure, Chihiro, senses trouble immediately. This establishes a powerful foundation for what I perceive to be Miyazaki-san's overall theme -- the Child, without guile or guide, often has the best instincts...despite having the least power, choice, or control with which to act upon those instincts.Chihiro relcutantly follows her parents into what appears to be a crumbling, abandoned theme-park. The eerie, lonely tones continue until the motif of delicious FOOD is planted smack-dab in the middle of the plot. The tones change, for the glorious, freshly-made ""feast"" brings both a sense of satisfaction and familiarity that plays nicely around the child's persistent apprehensions and the viewer's niggling sense that something simply CAN'T be right in this desolate landscape.What happens after Chihiro's parents dismiss her misgivings and settle down for a gluttonous meal is nothing less than a rip-roaring, non-stop explosion of magic, color, danger, mayhem, surprise, haunting imagery, and all-out bizarre (but morally ""thematically"" realistic) animation. The ""abandoned theme park"" turns out to be a ""Bath-house"" for the ancient Gods and Spirits of Japan -- abandoned by light of day, but magically transmogrified by night into an alternative universe where these spirits come to refresh themselves in ways that are at once human and decidedly immortal.The whole place is ""managed"" by a jaded and crabby old sorceress named ""Zeniba"" -- a character who must be seen to be believed, and both her clientele and her slave-driven employees never fail to disappoint the viewer's senses. There are a GREAT number of derivative qualities to Miyazaki-san's overall work -- shades of the Wizard of Oz,Alice in Wonderland, Never-Ending Story, Beauty and the Beast, and even an obscure Godzilla film make their influences known-- but these thematic borrowings and motifs serve the universal quality of the story with a very functional integrity. Even more poignant is the subtle sadness with which Miyazaki notes that the Japanese are fast trading the magic and mythical tradition of their ancient culture, in its entirety, for the irrepressible gift of Modernity.There's a love story here (or rather, a story about the primacy of love), and the truly empowering theme of a moody, spoiled little girl who is suddenly thrust into the madness of REAL magic and who must find a way to rise above her immaturity to save herself, her parents, and the balance of the seen and unseen worlds, is very inspiring. Essentially, Miyazaki-san is telling us how adaptable we are to frightening, frantic change in this world...and how adaptable we must be in order to survive. The fact that this lesson is learned best in his story by a *child* opens the door to many serious  questions about what our modern cultures are now demanding of the very young.These underlying brushstrokes aside, the whole film is a work of brilliance on the part of Mayazaki-san and his animators. The American dubbing is impeccable -- particularly Suzanne Pleshete as Zeniba and her ""alter ego."" The sight, story, and fate of the ""Stink Spirit"" alone is worth the purchase of this DVD. 'Spirited Away' is definitely an adult film in that it will appeal to fans of *anime* and will thrill the sensible adult mind as effortlessly as it will captivate the child, but some of the calibrated images are spooky and indelible; kids under six will have a couple of toss-and-turn nights, perhaps, after watching the film. Overall, though, this is a goldmine for the entire family, the ageless and proverbial young-at-heart, and one of the best Japanese films to emerge in recent years -- as evidenced by its big box office in Japan and in American art-house venues. The extras on the disc are notable for the original Japanese dub and moreso for the documentary of how Miyazaki literally ""hand-crafted"" this film the old fashioned way and emerged with a jewel that is every bit as breath-taking and eye-catching as the digital creations being churned out by contemporaneous production companies. Four and a Half Shooting Stars and kudos to Miyazaki-san. The half-star is detracted only because themes  are just a mite too OBVIOUSLY derivative -- but just a mite. This one's a keeper.

This movie took the world of Hayao Miyazaki and threw it right into your face saying 'This is the work of Studio Ghibli. Watch our movies!!!'

Though she gets anything she wants whenever she wants she still feels alone and ignored by the world. On the move to their new house Chihiro's family spots an abandoned amusement park. What they don't know is that it is a resort to the spirits that walk the Earth at night. Now her paretns broke the rules and turned into pigs so it's up to Chihiro to break the curse. On her dangerous yet sometimes humerous quest she learns what it is like to prove to yourself in the world and you can do great things.This is a very different film for Hayao Miyzaki. This is a story that plays upon some of the most bizzare fantasy stories. It is also a movie that can be a bit weird and sometimes disturbing. Yet what you see will blow your mind for it is so origional and so mind bending you will be craving to see what happens next. At this point Studio Ghibli is a world renound phenomenon and Disney is giving it a helping hand to get all the films to the world.

598777,A3IG2ZD9HPTJJH,B00005JLET,"William F. Soule ""f_ll_nth_bl_nk""","[6, 6]","This is a great movie, but it is obviously not for everyone, especially those who lack a creative spirit. I read one review that downcasted the Japanese for not making the characters look Asian enough! And another said that this movie is too &quot;different and weird.&quot; How sad. Others complained that this movie is too scary for kids (it says right on it - PG: For Some Scary Moments). And indeed there are! Don't rent it for your 4-year olds and complain about that it if they get scared. Anyway, to my opinion about the movie:BAD: This movie isn't perfect, and there are a few MINOR things that bothered me. First, the noses. When Chihiro turns sideways, her nose looks oddly shaped and flat.And last, the relationship between Yababa's sister and Chihiro wasn't developed enough. They share a scene with each other for about 5 minutes before Chihiro has to leave, and they are saying their good-byes as if they have been with each other for years!GOOD: The creativity of this movie is astounding! That's probably why some people don't like it. Maybe it's just too creative for some people. (Look at our music industry, for example. Since when did people enjoy a little creativity in music? But I won't go there). Anyway, there are a lot of weird creatures and spirits and a talking frog! You should also see some of the food the parents eat, as well as everything else, but there are too many things to type about.And also the originality of this movie... I haven't seen any movie even remotely like this one. If you have noticed the protaganists and antagonists, they are not the typical good vs. evil. Like Yababa (the main antagonist). I don't think she is evil, although she does unlikeable things. She is, however, trustworthy and she takes care of her giant baby! And the protaganist (Chihiro being the main one) is at first unlikeable (her screaming over everything... sheesh), but you grow to sympathize with her and like her throughout the movie. And one character (No-Face) switches from neutral to protagonist to antagonist to protagonist again.Also, the weird plot and setting (they enter this other world that seems to be in another world...). It's kind of hard to explain without giving everything away. You really have to see it for yourself.And the dubbing/voice acting was actually all right! I really liked the voices for all the characters, from the actor for Chihiro who really puts emotion into her character, and to Yababa with her throaty voice. Everyone was perfect.Also, I'm really glad with Miyazaki, because it feels like he was making this movie for himself (this movie does not follow any formula like in a lot of American movies). There are a lot of climaxes and resolutions in this movie and it feels as if he made up this movie as he went along, which in this case is a good thing.Overall, a great movie. Just don't complain about this movie because it has violence or the characters didn't look Asian enough. That's what G movies are made for- people who cannot enjoy creativity and a piece of art that was made for Miyazaki's pleasure.

A plucky young girl, thrown into strange circumstances, wins her goals through hard work and bravery. In this case, little Chohiro is thrown into a Japanese fantasy world, working as a bath-house drudge, in order to save her enchanted parents.The bath-house, however, serves the spirits, gods, and other beings that apparently inhabit Japan's fairy tales. Remember in Shrek, how seemingly every one of the Brothers Grimm characters came to life, all together? It's like that, but with a serious tone. The difference is that I didn't recognize any of the characters. They're not the fairy tales I grew up with. I could see that they were cultural icons, but not from my culture. That fascinated me - now I want to go and find out just who all those characters were, and what cultural meaning they have.It's kid-safe, with no serious adult themes or violence. Those aren't needed to keep Chohiro's quest interesting and to sustain a sense of wonder. There's enough to keep an adult interested, too.

I held off on showing her Spirited Away until today because I felt some elements such as the spirit world would be too scary for her until now.She watched it with me this afternoon and loved it! Before showing this to her, I explained some elements of Asian folklore (I am originally from Southeast Asia and could relate to some of the folklore underlying this story) so she could follow the story better, though this is not strictly necessary, especially for older viewers.Spirited Away follows the adventures of 10-year-old Chihiro who together with her parents is making a move from the city to the suburbs. Chihiro is not very happy about this move, and when her parents accidentally find themselves off the beaten path on their way to their new home, she discourages them from exploring. Chihiro has a strange sense of foreboding that this new place which her father presumes to be an abandoned theme park is much more than that and she is of course proven right. Her parents are turned into pigs after gorging on food they found at this place, which turns out to be inhabited by the spirit world.In Asian folklore, there is an emphasis on respecting old superstitions, which includes belief in the spirit world inhabited by the Gods and otherworldly creatures. When Chihiro's parents gorged on food meant for the spirits, they were being very disrespectful and so are punished accordingly. The rest of the story follows Chihiro's efforts, aided by the loyal Haku, to redeem her parents and make their escape from the malevolent witch Yubaba who rules over this world.The animation is simply amazing and conjures up a fantastical world of odd-looking creatures (that radish spirit was just out of this world!) in an alternate world that is vividly brought to life. The animation is superior but what makes this such a memorable film is the heartfelt story with its underlying theme of respect, loyalty,friendship, trust, and sacrifice. Chihiro's relentless efforts to save her parents credibly portrays the theme of filial piety and her courage and determination make her a true heroine, serving as a great role model for children. This is a film to be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, and I am so glad that I have the opportunity to share this remarkable film with my own child. P.S.
