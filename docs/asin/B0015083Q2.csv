I don't want to see French police watching a drug mule evacuating his bowels on the floor of a police station lavatory and then wolfing down handfuls of his own excrement to deny the police the cocaine packets that were hidden in his bowels. I don't think it is necessary to show a horribly battered naked female body in such loving detail. It makes me wonder what sort of person enjoys this sort of film. The French police and their so-called ""judiciary"" are presented as a very strange lot. The so-called ""judge"" behaves more like a deranged prosecutor. The senior prosecutor (a lawyer) consorts with an old school friend who is engaged in pimping and supplying drugs to highly placed clients. This same prosecutor tells the female police inspector to check for witnesses in the neighbourhood of a crime. Why didn't she just tell him that she knows how to do her job. In the Anglo world of criminal justice and policing in big cities, no police inspector would usually investigate both serious murder cases and a ring of petty thieves as we see happen in this series. I know that some people who make these films feel that they are artists and that they have a duty to ""confront"" viewers and push the boundaries of what is acceptable to show on screen but I feel that this series is simply an exercise in very bad taste.",1,Do the French really enjoy watching a person eat his own excrement?,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,1488,"['have', 'watched', 'enjoyed', 'Danish', 'TV', 'seriesThe', 'Killing', 'Season', 'Oneand', 'SwedishWallander', 'Episode', '1', 'Frostbut', 'found', 'French', 'TV', 'series', 'disgusting', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'French', 'police', 'watching', 'drug', 'mule', 'evacuating', 'bowels', 'floor', 'police', 'station', 'lavatory', 'then', 'wolfing', 'down', 'handfuls', 'own', 'excrement', 'deny', 'police', 'cocaine', 'packets', 'were', 'hidden', 'bowels', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessary', 'show', 'horribly', 'battered', 'naked', 'female', 'body', 'such', 'loving', 'detail', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'person', 'sort', 'film', 'French', 'police', 'so-called', 'judiciary', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'strange', 'lot', 'so-called', 'judge', 'more', 'deranged', 'prosecutor', 'senior', 'prosecutor', 'lawyer', 'old', 'school', 'friend', 'who', 'engaged', 'pimping', 'supplying', 'drugs', 'highly', 'placed', 'clients', 'same', 'prosecutor', 'female', 'police', 'inspector', 'check', 'witnesses', 'neighbourhood', 'crime', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'how', 'do', 'job', 'Anglo', 'world', 'criminal', 'justice', 'policing', 'big', 'cities', 'police', 'inspector', 'would', 'usually', 'investigate', 'serious', 'murder', 'cases', 'ring', 'petty', 'thieves', 'see', 'happen', 'series', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'films', 'feel', 'are', 'artists', 'have', 'duty', 'confront', 'viewers', 'push', 'boundaries', 'what', 'acceptable', 'show', 'screen', 'feel', 'series', 'simply', 'exercise', 'very', 'bad', 'taste']",Spiral: Series 1 2005
1147747,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0015083Q2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[8, 8]","I fell in love with the dark and moody crime drama ""Spiral"" almost instantaneously. In fact, I watched the first two seasons back to back over a period of about a week. This French import showcases the entire legal system from the cops, to the lawyers, to the judges and integrates a huge cast seamlessly. Unlike the American justice system, the set-up in France appears to be of a more cooperative nature. And while I'm certainly no authority over the accuracy of this representation, I really enjoyed how the various departments overlapped. ""Spiral"" has a principle cast that includes Gr&eacute;gory Fitoussi as ambitious prosecutor Pierre Cl&eacute;ment, Philippe Duclos as the moral judge Franois Roban, Caroline Proust as the relentless cop Laure Berthaud, and Audrey Fleurot as the unscrupulous defense attorney Jos&eacute;phine Karlsson. Each plays their role with precision and they are assisted by an impressive array of actors in supporting and guest roles. The series is stark and unabashedly brutal in its depiction of violent crime and its aftermath and. as such, has a gritty unpleasantness that serves the piece well. Each of the seasons has a major case running as a season-long plot line, but also showcases any number of other intriguing storylines (be they personal or criminal) along the way.Season One is comprised of eight hour long episodes and begins as new prosecutor Pierre Cl&eacute;ment is introduced along with the discovery of a murder. A beautiful young woman of Eastern European descent is found in a city dumpster battered beyond recognition. Was she targeted because of her involvement with the sex trade? As a science student who lived beyond her means, does the crime have something to do with the elite circle she ran around in? And what of her missing sister? Fitoussi (as Cl&eacute;ment) is the primary star of this main story line. His best friend has ties to the crime that can't be ignored and this might cause problems for his estranged wife's family. Along the way, though, there are so many other gruesome crimes to ponder. And as I said, the plot strands are woven together expertly. The juxtaposition of this dark brutality within a rather tony world of privilege makes for an fascinating counterpoint and I never lost interest in unraveling the central mystery. And Fitoussi is great!Season Two is also made up of eight hour long episodes. At first, it might seem more complex, but it is actually a more focused and straightforward run. By the second half of the season, the entire show has been taken over by the primary storyline and the episodes jettisoned any extraneous material. Early episodes give more time to Caroline Proust as Laure whose very career is in jeopardy when investigated by internal affairs (or the French equivalent). Also stepping up for more screen time is Audrey Fleurot as attorney Jos&eacute;phine. She descends to the dark side in rather disturbing ways as her new client roster leaves a lot to be desired. The season opens up with the brutal murder (a live burning) conducted by a local thug/aspiring music star. As the cops probe this occurrence, the whole gang is drawn into a rather elaborate web of drugs and murder that leads to a final chase in Spain. A new addition (Samir Boitard as Samy) infiltrates the criminal gang, but may fall victim to their ruthlessness and suspicions.I absolutely loved Season One of ""Spiral"" because you never knew where the next storyline would take you. It juggled so much, so efficiently. And while I also admired Season Two, I felt as if it started to cover more conventional territory as the episodes progressed. I'm looking forward to continuing on (It just wrapped a fifth season) and seeing what other twisted worlds that the show will explore. ""Spiral"" is an adult show, though, for a certain audience. It's graphic, has nudity, and explicit language. But it also boasts a real grittiness and will get under your skin. It never shies away from the dark underbelly of society. Season One would be about 4 1/2 stars for me with Season Two at 4 Stars. For the genre, though, ""Spiral"" is definitely more affecting and effective than most of its American counterparts.

I have trouble fathoming allocating ""Spiral"" five stars, and although it is indeed very gruesome at times, I have almost as much trouble understanding a one star rating. ""Spiral"" is nowhere near as good as standout series such as ""The Wire"" or ""Deadwood"" or even ""Breaking Bad."" It is not that well written, not that well-plotted, or that well-acted. It is just okay. The characters grow on you a bit, but they still are a bit wooden and stereotyped. The bad guys are awfully bad but there is no hint of why that might be so. Coincidences - such as the baddest of the bad guys being at the airport in the same line with the parents of his victims - add up. And a general feeling that really you are watching some form of high-end soap opera takes hold. I had higher expectations from reading a NY Times piece about great new French television shows. I was disappointed. Not truly bored, not repulsed - but disappointed. This deserves a three or two star rating.
