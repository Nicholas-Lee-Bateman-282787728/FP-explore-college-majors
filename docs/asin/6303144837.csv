359728,A319Y83RT0MRVR,6303144837,AIROLF,"[0, 3]","I regret watching this animated film.As a child, Thumbelina was one of my favorite heroines. She was strong and curious and took care of others. Disney's Thumbelina is codependent on a guy she barely knows and meets the same day, she is afraid to go out and find her way back to who she is and what she loves, she is ditsy and silly.At one point, Miss Mouse, a field mice who takes in Thumbelina away from the cold, tells Thumbelina that she has an itsy-bitsy brain. Indeed, the heroine of this movie is anything but heroic - she can't figure out to help her friend swallow, she is helpless and is afraid to leave the toad and the beetle who force her into situations she doesn't want to be in.The main reoccurring theme of the movie is sung by the swallow, who also serves as a narrator for the story. He says you don't need an education (to learn math or science), you just have to follow your heart. What kind of productive lesson is that?Moreover, the only lesson that's worth teaching to kids - Thumbelina's mother smartly states that Thumbelina must not desire to be anything but what she is and should be proud to be herself - is glanced over and barely gets a minute's notice.",2,a terrible story for children and a disappointing story for adults,1274313600,"05 20, 2010",2010,1184,"['regret', 'watching', 'animated', 'film.As', 'child', 'Thumbelina', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'heroines', 'was', 'strong', 'curious', 'took', 'care', 'others', 'Disney', 'Thumbelina', 'codependent', 'guy', 'barely', 'same', 'day', 'afraid', 'go', 'out', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'who', 'what', 'ditsy', 'silly.At', 'one', 'point', 'Miss', 'Mouse', 'field', 'mice', 'who', 'Thumbelina', 'away', 'cold', 'Thumbelina', 'itsy-bitsy', 'brain', 'Indeed', 'heroine', 'movie', 'anything', 'heroic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'help', 'friend', 'swallow', 'helpless', 'afraid', 'leave', 'toad', 'beetle', 'who', 'force', 'situations', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'in.The', 'main', 'reoccurring', 'theme', 'movie', 'sung', 'swallow', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'education', 'learn', 'math', 'science', 'just', 'have', 'follow', 'heart', 'What', 'kind', 'productive', 'lesson', 'Moreover', 'only', 'lesson', 'worth', 'teaching', 'kids', 'Thumbelina', 'mother', 'smartly', 'Thumbelina', 'must', 'not', 'desire', 'be', 'anything', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'be', 'glanced', 'barely', 'minute', 'notice']",N/A

Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu  blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade.

359736,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303144837,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","While on vacation earlier this year, my daughter discovered `Thumbelina', and every time we were waiting for her sister to awaken from her nap so that we could get back on the beach, we watched this movie.  EVERY DAY FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK!  Yes, it is a bit of overkill and enough to drive any sane parent absolutely crazy.  I tried to get her to watch something different, but the idea of a fairy Prince Charming and a little girl who gets to practically become a fairy was too much for her to ignore.  She had to see it over and over again because it basically encapsulated all of her life long ambitions.Yes, she is five and yes, she wants to be a fairy.`Thumbelina', which is adapted from the famous Hans Christian Anderson fairytale, tells the story of a little girl born out of a flower who is no bigger than your thumb (thus her name).  She is depressed that there is no one else her size, but that all changes when she meets Prince Cornelius, a fairy who just so happens to be her size!  No sooner do the two fall in love, Thumbelina is kidnapped by Mrs. Toad and basically spends the rest of the film in some sort of slavery in exchange for whatever little help she can get to return to her beloved.  Eventually all is right and Thumbelina is reunited with her Prince, but getting there is quite the journey.For me, this has some major pluses and minuses.  The musical arrangements and songs, produced by none other than Barry Manilow, are beautifully composed and are as good as some Disney classics.  The spirit of the film is also quite nice, and the balance of tension and romantic splendor works well.  My main issue comes from this permeating air of selfishness and cruelty.  The fact that nearly everyone poor Thumbelina meets merely wants to take advantage of her is not a great thing to promote or browbeat our children with.  It's a sad message and takes away from the story (although I am aware that it is a big part of the story itself).  I just didn't like that message.Still, the film as a whole is fine and has great moments.  My daughter loves it (obviously) and that is always the most important factor.

Why is this in the very back?  I used to love this movie when I was a kid!""  I eagerly turned it on, expecting to be filled with a nostaligic feeling enjoying the movie...But boy, was I ever wrong!  I can see now why they had that movie in the very back, hidden away from all eyes so that no one will have to suffer sitting through it.  The movie was fake and way too fast.  Think about it, the beginning Thumbelina is wishing how she can find a love, then by some strange coincidence Cornilious appears who just happens to be the prince, who just happens to fall in love with Thumbelina.  Then you see the two of them go on this flying ride (I found myself comparing it with Disney's Aladdin's flying carpet scene) on a bumblebee and they sing how much in love they are, and are practically engaged by the end of the night.  So...they spent what, not even an hour together before ""falling in love""?  Sheesh...is that a sign of laziness or rush?The animation got to me, was it really that bad?  When I was a kid I didn't remember it being that bad.  I think you'll notice it the most the scene after the little ""Bumblebee"" ride when Thumbelina looks up longingly after her prince...you can tell that the artists were really going for a delicate, graceful, soft feeling there, but...it just came off as tried-too-hard-and-didn't-work-out.I was going to give this movie a one-star review, but I can't deny that when I was a kid I used to love this movie...this is an example of how kids view things differently, a lot of reviewers reviewing this movie are saying ""My kid loved it.""  Okay...well...how come none of them are saying what they, themselves thought of it?Another reason why I didn't give this a one-star review was because of the music.  My, my, my...how did they get Jodi Benson to do this degrading role?  She's worthy of Disney film voices, she's beyond this.  Barry Manilow provides much of the song scores!  That's definitely a plus, the music in this film is cute and charming for the most part, but comparing it to Disney is a mistake.  ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" is considered by some to be as good as Disney's best...I do hope that no one really thinks this, that is such an insult towards Disney.I will have to say, however, that the music is catchy.

Heck, after watching this  movie, *I* daydreamed about being Thumbelina. Admit it, wouldn't you like  it?The traditional Hans Christian Anderson story: A woman who wishes for  a daughter is blessed with one in a flower--and she's about six inches  tall. But this doesn't matter to Mother or her array of barnyard animals,  who love Thumbelina dearly. However, soon a handsome fairy prince named  Cornelius arrives and is smitten with Thumbelina. After taking her on a  ride on his pet bumblebee, he has to leave but promises to come  back.That night, Thumbelina is kidnapped by a family of singing frogs,  but as she escapes with the help of a French swallow, she ends up in deeper  and deeper trouble.Some things in this movie are rather cloying--the  jitterbugs, for example--but they're too small a part of the movie to be  noticeable. Thumbelina is not a macho heroine, so don't expect her to act  like one--she's a lost, frightened girl who's been sheltered all of her  life. She shows remarkable strength and I got the feeling that the  Thumbelina at the end was very different from the girl at the  beginning.Cornelius remains my favorite character. Our first glimpse of  the adolescent fairy is after he escapes from a royal parade, where he is  forced to sit on *snicker* a white butterfly.

359752,AA7W0CFRXF46L,6303144837,elfdart,"[0, 0]","The story of Thumbelina was originally a fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. It's the story of a thumb- sized girl and her adventures in life and love. The film begins with an old woman. The woman is lonely and has always wanted a child of her own, and one day a fairy grants her wish and gives her a small seed. The old woman plants the seed and kisses it when it's ready to bloom, and inside she finds a tiny girl no bigger than her thumb, whom she then calls Thumbelina. Thumbelina is quite contented with her life on the old woman's farm. She tries to help out with chores, but only seems to her herself into scrapes whenever she tries to help. She loves her mother though and is happy. One night, Thumbelina is singing to herself in her room when, as chance would have it, the prince of the fairies flies by her bedroom window and is enchanted by her voice. He takes her for a ride on his pet bumblebee and they sing and fall in love. He then returns her to her room with the promise of returning. On that romantic ride through the meadow, a frog over hears Thumbelina singing and thinks to herself that this small girl would make a great addition to their travelling show and would make her son a good wife. So she kidnaps her that very night while Thumbelina slept, before the prince could come back to marry her. When Thumbelina awakes and discovers what the frogs have planned for her she runs away from them and tries to make her way back home, but being so small she can't see above the grass. The frog whom she escaped from is hot on her tail so quickly makes her way through the company of various bugs and birds and rodents who both try to help her and try to capture her. In the end the swallow, who also is the narrator of the story, helps her find her way to the vale of the fairies, where she hopes to find her prince.  They end up getting married  and Thumbelina grows a pair of wings to match her prince's and they all live happily ever after.I liked this movie a lot when I was a kid. I'd sing the songs with my cousin when we watched the movie together, though apparently according to Wikipedia the `marry the mole' song won the worst original song award. I remember feeling kind of awkward that all of these creepy guys wanted to marry Thumbelina and I guess that sort of took away from the movie a bit for me, but overall the memories are pleasant. Thumbelina isn't a strong character by any means, she sort of just gets tossed around by fate and always needs rescuing. The prince also isn't any knight in shining armour. He acts as a boy would, shirking responsibilities and spouting idealism without having anything to back it up. The villains are also kind of one-dimensional in their drive to get Thumbelina. Besides being struck by her voice, which isn't enough to make someone fall in love, there isn't really anything substantial in their desire to marry her. Besides a few character flaws however, this really is a sweet film. The songs are catchy, I like the animation, and the story is adventurous with a kiss at the end, short, sweet, and nostalgic.",4,good,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,3087,"['story', 'Thumbelina', 'was', 'originally', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Hans', 'Christian', 'Anderson', 'story', 'thumb-', 'sized', 'girl', 'adventures', 'life', 'love', 'film', 'old', 'woman', 'woman', 'lonely', 'always', 'wanted', 'child', 'own', 'one', 'day', 'fairy', 'wish', 'small', 'seed', 'old', 'woman', 'plants', 'seed', 'when', 'ready', 'bloom', 'tiny', 'girl', 'no', 'bigger', 'thumb', 'whom', 'then', 'Thumbelina', 'Thumbelina', 'quite', 'contented', 'life', 'old', 'woman', 'farm', 'help', 'out', 'chores', 'only', 'scrapes', 'whenever', 'help', 'mother', 'happy', 'One', 'night', 'Thumbelina', 'singing', 'herself', 'room', 'when', 'chance', 'would', 'have', 'prince', 'fairies', 'flies', 'bedroom', 'window', 'enchanted', 'voice', 'ride', 'pet', 'bumblebee', 'sing', 'fall', 'love', 'then', 'room', 'promise', 'returning', 'romantic', 'ride', 'meadow', 'frog', 'hears', 'Thumbelina', 'singing', 'herself', 'small', 'girl', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'travelling', 'show', 'would', 'make', 'son', 'good', 'wife', 'very', 'night', 'Thumbelina', 'slept', 'prince', 'could', 'come', 'back', 'marry', 'When', 'Thumbelina', 'awakes', 'discovers', 'what', 'frogs', 'have', 'planned', 'away', 'tries', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'home', 'being', 'so', 'small', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'grass', 'frog', 'whom', 'escaped', 'hot', 'tail', 'quickly', 'way', 'company', 'various', 'bugs', 'birds', 'rodents', 'who', 'try', 'help', 'try', 'capture', 'end', 'swallow', 'who', 'also', 'narrator', 'story', 'find', 'way', 'vale', 'fairies', 'where', 'find', 'prince', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'Thumbelina', 'pair', 'wings', 'match', 'prince', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'kid', ""'d"", 'sing', 'songs', 'cousin', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'together', 'though', 'apparently', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'marry', 'mole', 'song', 'won', 'worst', 'original', 'song', 'award', 'remember', 'feeling', 'kind', 'awkward', 'creepy', 'guys', 'wanted', 'marry', 'Thumbelina', 'guess', 'sort', 'took', 'away', 'movie', 'bit', 'memories', 'are', 'pleasant', 'Thumbelina', ""n't"", 'strong', 'character', 'means', 'sort', 'just', 'tossed', 'fate', 'always', 'rescuing', 'prince', 'also', ""n't"", 'knight', 'shining', 'armour', 'boy', 'would', 'shirking', 'responsibilities', 'spouting', 'idealism', 'having', 'anything', 'back', 'up', 'villains', 'are', 'also', 'kind', 'one-dimensional', 'drive', 'get', 'Thumbelina', 'being', 'struck', 'voice', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'someone', 'fall', 'love', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'substantial', 'desire', 'marry', 'few', 'character', 'flaws', 'however', 'really', 'sweet', 'film', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'like', 'animation', 'story', 'adventurous', 'kiss', 'end', 'short', 'sweet', 'nostalgic']",N/A

Some very nice backdrops and decent animation.So far as the story goes, this is definitely childish.  Characters act in unrealistic ways.  Why is everyone obsessed with dancing and singing?  What do rats and moles care about money?  The mother wasn't phased at all when a tiny woman emerged from her plant's flower.  The character dialogue was very childish.The worst thing about this movie was the bad message it sends girls.  Thumbalina's main purpose in life was to get married and be pretty.  She was distraught when a beetle called her ugly and once someone called her pretty, she was all happy again.  She was pretty much air-headed and floundered around, barely able to walk.  No innovation when it came to getting out of scrapes.  She just said &#34;I give up, it's impossible.&#34;  She was manipulated by whoever was around her, singing and dancing around to their whims.  Throughout, all the little bugs and critters were trying to court her.  It seemed to archaic to hear a song about how she should marry for money, and she almost goes through with it, saying &#34;he would be able to take care of me.&#34;  Talk about the perfect image of the helpless woman.To give the movie credit, it was probably produced in a time when a woman's main goal was to get married, and female independence wasn't so prevalent.  But even though it's not the movie's fault for it's time period, the movie didn't have enough going on in other areas for me to still enjoy it.I did not much care for the artwork style of many of the characters.  They were a bit cheesy: The huge boots on the bird, the googly faces of the child insects, the old-style cartoon look in general.  However, the fairies were pretty cool.  I suppose it's up to personal opinion though.I definitely would not recommend watching this movie unless you like childish things and don't care about quality story or characters.  There are plenty of other cartoons out there that have a little more brainwork involved in their dialogue and I can happily sit through them.

Bluth, creator of The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail, and The Land Before Time, as well as many other amazing animated films, got his start at Disney.  Bluth then started his own production company.  Right now, in 2005, his company is no more, but Bluth has left a tremendous body of works that will be enjoyed for generations.Bluth's retelling of the Grimm Brothers fairy tale Thumbelina is enchanting.  Thumbelina (voiced by Jodi Benson)is innocent and naiive; if adults can remember when they were that way too, once upon a time, it will enhance their enjoyment of the film.  Thumbelina lives with her mother.  She is lonely for a friend her own size.  One fateful moonlit night, she meets the Fairy Prince Cornelius, and falls in love.  Unfortunately, Thumbelina is kidnapped by Mama Toad (Charro) to be a singer in her troupe, and a wife for her horrible toad son.Throughout her difficult journey and separation from her home, other well-meaning creatures try to tell Thumbelina what she should do and who she should be.  Everyone wants to control her; no one wants to let her find her own path.  Her only faithful friend is the charming Parisian swallow, Jacqimo, who gently encourages Thumbelina to never give up and follow her heart.  Staying true to yourself and not caving in to the pressure of what others think you should do, and what they think is best for you, is difficult to do.  This movie will strengthen anyone's resolve to resist anyone else trying to make them into something they don't feel they are meant to be.The opening scenes of the swallow's flight high over Paris is breathtaking.  Barry Manilow's songs are wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" is as good as Aladdin's ""A Whole New World.""

BUT--BUT--and again, BUT!--I cannot stand idly by while these empty-headed yahoos have their say about this movie's animation!I would first like to say that I DO know something about animation. NO, I'm not an animator, but that's my dream.  I have watched many movies in my quest to figure out how to make a good movie using animation.  I have come to the conclusion that the public in gemeral has NO CLUE what really good animation is.  This movie's reviews have convinced me for certain.  For example, the reviewers on this have complained of ""dated animation"".  The only thing dated about it is that it's GOOD, unlike the other trash being made in the U.S. these days (Pixar excluded).  You can say what you like about the drawings--some of them are pretty weird-looking--but guess what?  THE DRAWING IS NOT THE ANIMATION, FOLKS!  See, this is what the general public doesn't understand.  If you just look at the ACTION, not the DRAWINGS, then you're really seeing the animation.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Okay, put a blank mask over the figures in your mind; imagine stick figures.  Just don't pay attention to the design or drawing.  Then you'll see the beauty of the movement in there.  Try it; I can't explain it that well.  Let's see... Just, if they were stick figures, but still moving the same, you could see the motion and get what I mean by ""good animation"".  Compare that to the runs on 8s and 12s in many 2D stuff (seen pokemon lately?  how 'bout Yu-Gi-Oh!--which is a bunch of talking heads with no different mouth positions?). This just puts that completely to shame.  It just isn't FAIR!  don Bluth's just TOO good!  Let me be that good someday, PLEASE...Also, on the scruples about the romance, I'd like to point out that it's a lot better than, say, Snow White's (as wonderfully animated, scored, and characterized as that movie was!, the romance was a fairy tale one).  I mean, at least Thumbelina and Cornelius MET! It's strangeness, I'm sure, comes straight from the Hans Christian Anderson story.  Anyone read the ORIGINAL Little Mermaid?  Or Steadfast Tin Soldier?  Guess what?  In both cases, the main character(s) DIE!  Did YOU know that, in the fairy tale, Ariel was GOING to kill Eric so she'd live, but then decided to ""become the foam upon the waves""?  Well, she was, and she did actually ""become the foam u[pon the waves"".  However, in the DISNEY movie, everyone lived happily ever after, and Ariel was a selfish brat--""You know, I saw this guy I kind of liked the look of, so I'll just endanger my entire kingdom and him so I can go be smoochy."" Thumbelina was a good, innocent, nice character.The music was really good, too.  The songs were funny when they were supposed to be, and the others were lovely. The singing wasn't even too vibrato or inhaler-y, and they managed to keep the horrid, ghastly, synthesized pop-version of ""Let Me Be Your Wings"" until the end of the credits, so that many of us wouldn't have to be subjected to it.  All-around good music.  Actually, I, the Anti-Romantic (as I've been dubbed) really enjoyed ""Let Me Be Your Wings"", and had it stuck in my head for the next few days and DIDN'T MIND IT!

We've had this DVD since she was three but she loves this movie and always enjoys a repeat viewing. The animation is actually quite well-done, perhaps not as polished as some of Disney's animated offerings, but certainly not shoddy either.Thumbelina is beautifully-rendered in this animated feature, she is lovely and fragile and her fairy prince Cornelius is suitably dashing! Thumbelina goes through many adventures and trials in this feature - getting kidnapped by a family of toads, only to be rescued by a chivalrous swallow, but she ends up in other precarious situations. The songs are suitably amusing, but not exactly memorable. However, to a 5-year-old, these little flaws did not seem to matter. Unlike some reviewers who found Thumbelina's characterization unappealing, I felt her character grew as the story progressed - from a naive and frightened young girl to one who is more aware and sure of herself as the story comes to an end.
