Similarly, there is the magnificent partner in the duo, and the adequate one. Such all is found here.Hugh Laurie here is brilliant. He demonstrates a full range of comedic prowess, as well as true musical ability. The humor Stephen Fry would later be known for, as seen inJeeves & Woosterhas yet to mature, and too frequently relies on fumbling innuendo and outright bawdiness.An extremely funny 'skitlet' is a verbal mix-up. Fry is a customer complaining of his soup, and Laurie is the waiter constantly confused thinking he is talking about his suit. On one hand, it is predictable. You know Laurie will not get it, and Fry will continue to insist his soup is wrong. However, it is how they get there that is hilarious. Finally, with no true end to the joke in sight, they stop, and ask for a caller to suggest closure. A caller (unheard, just named 'JD') naturally helps out with a dry, not particularly original finish, and Fry smiles and says to the audience, ""Nice one, JD."" Excellent timing by Fry.More like that, and the DVD would be a fantastic example of British humor. Instead, though, we see too much of Fry's sexual self-indulgence, with jokesBenny Hillwould have rejected.A Bit of Fry and Laurie - Season One was not for me.

However its fame is nowhere near as widespread as that of its counterparts 'Fawlty Towers' and 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'.

This is why it was with great joy that I heard of the DVD release of their complete first two series.Having seen what Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie have to offer, it is difficult to understand why they have not had more widespread success. Their humour is fantastically witty and posesses the sophistication and finesse that other programmes so sorely lack. Stephen Fry's manipulation of the English language is always amusing and his talents fused with those of Hugh Laurie are a potent mix. Indeed it may sometimes remind the viewer of their other collaboration on 'Jeeves and Wooster'.It is great news that this series has finally been committed to DVD and not simply a 'best of'.

The problem mostly lies in the fact that many of these skits are parodies and reference pop culture and events - more like Saturday Night Live.  So when watching something from that long ago - and from that far away - it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as if I'd been able to get all of the nuances.  That's not to say that none of it was enjoyable (there certainly were moments that made me laugh) but it could have been better.I know, nothing tops the great Monty Python, so I should be disappointed.  But, given how much I've enjoyed Stephen Fry on Whose Line is it Anyway? and Hugh Laurie as House, well, I was a bit let down.
