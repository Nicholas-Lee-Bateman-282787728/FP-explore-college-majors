I was drawn into the world of the 80's NYC Art Scene. The film is a bit austere, but I think that helps viewer's relate to Eleanor's (Bernadette Peters)struggle in life as an outsider-that she never gets the joke. Bernadette gives a rich and nuanced performance as Eleanor. She is the reason for seeing the film. She vacillates between giddy joy, depression, heartbreak, and triumph. Her introverted Eleanor is a joy to watch.The colorful peripheral characters add spice and contrast, but it is Eleanor's story of finding her identity in an environment where everything is a facade.This film is definitely not for everyone. Many talented people worked on this film and I found it charming on so many levels. It is definately unlike anything you have ever seen. If you love anything about the 80's culture, fashion, or pop world this is a must see. The fashion alone is a hoot.

252394,AIWDJ3S85O10Q,6301415841,Edward Aycock,"[12, 18]","Hopelessly stiff in some parts, and unfunny in others, ""Slaves of New York"" doesn't have any center. James Ivory was perhaps a poor choice as a director;  there is a restrained quality to the movie and nothing seems spontaneous.  Ivory seemed to be trying for his own Altmanesque collage; the truth is, Altman should have been the one to direct this in the first place.The casting isn't much better: Bernadette Peters does what she can with the role of Eleanor but she's too old for the part.  Mercedes Ruehl is barely believable as an East Village bohemian;  she looks as though she's playacting.  Adam Coleman Howard is more whiny than anything as Stash and Nick Corri's character, while likeable, lacks the bite of the character in the original stories.The one scene that really stands out is the three cross dressers lip synching to the Supremes' ""Love is Like an Itchin' in my Heart"" on the street at 6 a.m. That's a fantastic moment and one that really gives the movie any life, and will perhaps be the ticket to the movie not being forgotten entirely.The extras are bittersweet. The late Ismail Merchant is interviewed, looking fit and healthy, and an unsmiling Tama Janowitz discusses the transition from book to film.

252396,A13TO5TU4A68LD,6301415841,Gryphonisle,"[1, 1]","As I understand it, &#34;Slaves Of New York&#34; is based on a series of short stories, with Bernadette Peter's character having the task of sewing it all together.  It's no small coincidence that her character can't sew well.  The basic premise of the film is that he who has the lease owns the people who come to live with him.  It sounds like a line out of &#34;Dune&#34; but soon reveals itself to be a way the characters rationalize their weak behavior;  they can't afford a place on their own, so in one way or another they prostitute themselves to someone who has a place, be it as a friend or lover, or..., and having to put up with that person's bad behavior and maltreatment of them, they refer to themselves as slaves.  Not quite the same thing, but let's keep moving.While this may very well be based on short stories, it comes across more as an idea hatched over dinner, where Mess'rs  Merchant and Ivory and friends all recounted their experiences in New York, in the 80's and someone said &#34;That would make a great movie!&#34;  which might be true, but not by Merchant Ivory.  It's something of a relationship movie, running beneath a collection of period images;  images that for no good reason show up on multiple screens (long before the computer made that common place) and occasionally as an overlap.  The movie wants to look artsy, but it isn't.One of the main problems is the choice of Bernadette Peters as the lead character, a young hat designer who's sharing the flat of a selfish, domineering, and manipulative male artist of some local note.  Ms. Peters is a one note actress, whose performance hovers between stressed and melt down;  suggesting a character in an Woody Allen movie, except that she can't even convincingly evoke a neuroses well enough for that.  When she achieves her first flash of success, and gets her own place, her &#34;boyfriend&#34;, comes back to &#34;let her make up with him&#34;  for their break up, and in a scene that lasts only a couple of minutes, the best she can manage is &#34;You're a Jerk!&#34;.  We knew that, but that's all you can say?Merchant Ivory was a film company that not only produced a number of classic films, but became a title for a genre of films; the lush productions of costume dramas set mostly in Britain or the US a century or so ago.  To that end, while this was filmed as a contemporary piece, enough time has passed to see it as a period film, and the costumes, especially those worn by Ms. Peters, evoke a truncated, punkish interpretation of the Edwardian costumes in their bigger films.  Also of anthropological interest is the hair.  Oh my!  &#34;Big Hair&#34; doesn't quite do it justice, this 1980's penchant of the indigenous tribeswomen of the NYC/NJ area for overwrought, massive hair-do's.  &#34;White woman's 'fro&#34; would be one suggestion, but the construction of these monuments to bad taste are far more contrived than organic.  Not since the Sun Kings partied at Versailles has women's hair looked this ridiculous.  The hair in this film makes even the period 'dos of &#34;Moonstruck&#34; look conservative.I read that this has become a cult film in the Gay Community, for the scene of the drag queens playing the Supremes, which I must admit is a rather memorable scene, especially as it interplays with a messy argument between Ms. Peter's character and her &#34;boyfriend&#34;.Still, unless you came of age in the '80s, and can't leave it behind, or have an inexplicable attraction for the period, the way I did, back then, for the '30s and '40s, I can't see wasting the time on this unfortunate film.If, on the other hand, you've recently watched &#34;Take This Waltz&#34; and &#34;Tiny Furniture&#34;, two films of adult children struggling in the Real World, this might be a worthy piece to add to your study.  It is interesting to note how childish, &#34;Childishness&#34; has become since the 1980's!",2,A Merchant Ivory Mis-fire;  Stories Don't Gel.

It is a total waste of 125 minutes of life.Perhaps in the hands of Robert Altman, this film might have moved cleverly,but James Ivory is totally out of his or any element trying to make this film breathe with any form of artistic life or sensibility.This film fails as a comedy, a drama AND as a stinging indictment on the artistic world and it's view on relationships . The sight gags fall flat. The characters  go no where as they drift along from person to person and place to place in the concrete jungle where life is cold and heartless for the starving artist.Even Eleanor,(Peters), in her attempt to get a life and have a fulfilling relationship is bogged down and unsympathetic in it's portrayal.  This film has no soul whatsoever and trying to find anyone with which this artist/musician could identify was impossible. Bernadette Peters' genius is wasted. Actors such as Chris Sarandon,Stanley Tucci,Mercedes Ruehl and Steve Buscemi are total throwaways in this avant-garde portrayal of social climbers and pretentious self-seekers in New York.We are left with one conclusion: relationships probably are not ever going to be what you want or need them to be!
