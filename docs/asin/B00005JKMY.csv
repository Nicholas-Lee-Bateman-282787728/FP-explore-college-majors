But once you piece everything together it starts to make sense.  After watching this movie a second time I realized it is a great movie and I think it will gain greater cult status in the future.Tom Cruise is perfect in this movie.  He is a cocky, rich, inheritant with the world seemingly at his hands.  In one hand he is the editor of a popular pop culture magazine with a chic apartment and a slick Ferrari. In the other hand he has the pretty but insecure Cameron Diaz as his girlfriend along with his best friend played by Jason Lee. Meanwhile Tom Cruise has an eye for Penelope Cruz and they start to fall for one another.  Thing is that Jason Lee really liked Penelope Cruz and that pisses him off.  But his anger that pales in comparision to the anger Cameron has.  She obviously isn't a fan of the growing relationship Mr. and Ms. Cruise have for one another.  Therefore she turns from the nice and likable character we've seen in Something About Mary and transforms into Mommie Dearest.That is where the movie does a backflip and then it gets messed up.  Oh it sure does.  I'm not going to summarize the rest of this movie but from there it is a great movie that travels into science fiction and questions reality.The characters in this movie are hard to forget.  I think they all play their role very well in this movie.  As I said earlier Tom Cruise fits in this movie perfectly as he did in Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and Risky Business. Cameron Diaz is perfect for being a psycho lover and I found it odd that Jason Lee was in this movie.  I picture him as the dude from Mallrats, which is the funniest comedy of all time.In short, this is a great movie that will make you question life and is also a cool science fiction movie.  Give Vanilla Sky more than one viewing and you will see what I mean and alot more.By the way the soundtrack to the movie is outstanding.  When Tom Cruise is going insane, they play the Beach Boys - Good Vibrations.  It is such an odd song for this movie but it sounds perfect in a movie like this.",4,Behind its mask it is a great but messed up movie,1073606400,"01 9, 2004",2004,2159,"['Vanilla', 'Sky', 'one', 'movies', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'quot', 'What', 'fill', 'blank', 'quot', 'once', 'piece', 'everything', 'together', 'make', 'sense', 'watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'realized', 'great', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'gain', 'greater', 'cult', 'status', 'future.Tom', 'Cruise', 'perfect', 'movie', 'cocky', 'rich', 'inheritant', 'world', 'seemingly', 'hands', 'one', 'hand', 'editor', 'popular', 'pop', 'culture', 'magazine', 'chic', 'apartment', 'slick', 'Ferrari', 'other', 'hand', 'pretty', 'insecure', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'girlfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Meanwhile', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'eye', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'start', 'fall', 'one', 'Thing', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'really', 'liked', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'off', 'anger', 'comparision', 'anger', 'Cameron', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'fan', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Ms.', 'Cruise', 'have', 'one', 'nice', 'likable', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Something', 'Mary', 'transforms', 'Mommie', 'Dearest.That', 'where', 'movie', 'backflip', 'then', 'messed', 'up', 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'summarize', 'rest', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'questions', 'reality.The', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'hard', 'forget', 'think', 'play', 'role', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'said', 'earlier', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'did', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Risky', 'Business', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'perfect', 'being', 'psycho', 'lover', 'found', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'movie', 'picture', 'dude', 'Mallrats', 'funniest', 'comedy', 'time.In', 'short', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'question', 'life', 'also', 'cool', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'Give', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'alot', 'more.By', 'way', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'When', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'going', 'insane', 'play', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Good', 'Vibrations', 'such', 'odd', 'song', 'movie', 'perfect', 'movie']",Vanilla Sky VHS

However, I began to think I missed something (same initial reaction I had to Cruise's Minority Report), so I watched it again and appreciated the story behind the story.

589035,AJJ2YKN4BG2FC,B00005JKMY,"Accidental Tourist ""Maryam M""","[2, 3]","While Vanilla Sky does not compare in any way with it's far superior predecessorAbre los Ojos, Vanilla Sky succeeds in two ways:- Style: The film is undeniably pretty and cast with three leading characters who are, by most standards, quite elegant themselves. The movie seems to be predominately made specifically as eye candy, and is thoroughly pleasing in that aspect.- Suspension of Disbelief: the film, like it's predecessor, is surreal and challenges you to decipher what is real and what is not. Abre Los Ojos presented reality and distortion of reality in a way that was not completely boggling, allowed the viewer room for personal interpretation and provided a satisfying--if not somewhat depressing conclusion. Vanilla Sky is all over the place in this aspect--which is probably in part due to the jumpy, deliberately schizophrenic and pretentious editing. Only if you have seen the original will you be truly able to flesh out and appreciate what Vanilla Sky is about.In the end, it is a pretty movie with a pretty cast and one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear (although to get the full soundtrack you may have to do a little hunting of your own, since the official soundtrack is sadly lacking many of the great tunes from the classic scenes in this movie) Overall, it is NOT completely horrible/unwatchable, despite what some may say, and yet, it is not perfect. If you're a Cruise, Cruz or Diaz fan, you'll probably have to add this to your collection, whatever the title. If you enjoy surrealistic psycho-candy, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you enjoy watching Tom Cruise in anything besides Top Gun, Rain Man, or Days of Thunder, this, and Minority Report, are definitely worth a watch.",4,"A Surreal Romp In A World Filled Entirely With Shallow, Pretty People",1196726400,"12 4, 2007",2007,1716,"['Vanilla', 'Sky', 'not', 'compare', 'way', 'far', 'superior', 'predecessorAbre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'two', 'ways', 'Style', 'film', 'undeniably', 'pretty', 'cast', 'three', 'leading', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'standards', 'quite', 'elegant', 'movie', 'be', 'predominately', 'made', 'specifically', 'eye', 'candy', 'thoroughly', 'pleasing', 'aspect.-', 'Suspension', 'Disbelief', 'film', 'predecessor', 'surreal', 'decipher', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'not', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'presented', 'reality', 'distortion', 'reality', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'boggling', 'allowed', 'viewer', 'room', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'provided', 'satisfying', 'not', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'conclusion', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'place', 'aspect', 'probably', 'part', 'due', 'jumpy', 'deliberately', 'schizophrenic', 'pretentious', 'editing', 'Only', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'will', 'be', 'truly', 'able', 'flesh', 'out', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'end', 'pretty', 'movie', 'pretty', 'cast', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'get', 'full', 'soundtrack', 'may', 'have', 'do', 'little', 'hunting', 'own', 'official', 'soundtrack', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'many', 'great', 'tunes', 'classic', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Overall', 'NOT', 'completely', 'horrible/unwatchable', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'yet', 'not', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'Cruise', 'Cruz', 'Diaz', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'add', 'collection', 'title', 'enjoy', 'surrealistic', 'psycho-candy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'anything', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Rain', 'Man', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Minority', 'Report', 'are', 'definitely', 'watch']",Vanilla Sky VHS

There are very few movies that have left their mark in my heart and memory and this is one of them. Tom Cruise is at its best. A very challenging role for most, but he just did it so naturally. In fact, I was not a Cruise fan until I saw this movie.The movie is very touching, and takes you on the emotional rollercoaster ride throughout the movie. It is sad to see that many people failed to understand the movie, and that explains the reason it didn't did well on the box-office.

Then, as time went by, I found it coming back to me in a song, in an image, in something I overheard.  I decided to give it a second chance and rented it.  What I found upon my second viewing was fascinating.The exploration of human obsession with superficial beauty and instant gratification was phenomenal.  David Aames lives for the moment;  he is a young, wealthy, good-looking man who sleeps with gorgeous women, drives fancy cars, wears nice clothes and, best of all, doesn't really have to work!  His world is turned upside down when he catches a glimpse of what could be true love.  When all that he takes for granted in life is taken away and he must face all the personal insecurities he has never even thought of, we are forced to look at ourselves in an uncomfortable way.It's hard enough for me, who in no way comes close to Tom Cruise, to entertain the possibility of a physical disfigurement.  The journey that his character takes is at once painful, uplifting, and one of the greatest achievements of subtle introspection delivered through the medium of film that I've witnessed in a long time.The commentary with Cameron Crowe and his wife, complete with a little cameo by Cruise, is very insightful.

589041,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B00005JKMY,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 4]","""Vanilla Sky"" is a remake of the Spanish film ""Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes)"", and if you have seen the original film and ""Vanilla Sky"", you might notice that ""Vanilla Sky"" was filmed almost in the same way, most of the scenes are duplicated from the original movie, but there are key differences. The plot and most of the scenes are virtually the same in both movies, but ""Vanilla Sky"" features a different kind of music.This movie has a rock-oriented soundtrack, the film was directed by Cameron Crowe, a rock aficionado, usually he throws his favorite songs into his movies, so obviously Vanilla Sky is not an exception. The songs are great (R.E.M., Radiohead, The Beach Boys, Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, etc), but there is a problem: many times the song has nothing to do with the scene, but Crowe inserted the tracks anyway. Sometimes ""Vanilla Sky"" resembles more a music video than a movie, but at least the music is fine.The movie has an interesting cast, because there are a lot of familiar faces in ""Vanilla Sky"", like Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russell and Jason Lee. But even though it's a flashy cast, the movie rarely offers highlights with the performances.Tom Cruise gives a lackluster performance, Kurt Russell makes a good job, Jason Lee is adequate, and Penelope Cruz reprises exactly the same character that she played in ""Open Your Eyes"", as a matter of fact she didn't expanded her role, since she does the same things that she did before. But the character played by Cameron Diaz is a slight improvement over the original character, because Cameron adds more depth with her performance.Of course, since ""Vanilla Sky"" is a Hollywood movie, the visual effects and the budget are bigger this time, so the only significant improvement over ""Open Your Eyes"" is on the technical side: there are visual effects, there are more technological gizmos, the makeup is better in ""Vanilla Sky"", and the sets are impressive.But despite those technical improvements, ""Vanilla Sky"" is not an overall improvement over ""Abre Los Ojos"". As a matter of fact, it's very recommendable that if you liked ""Vanilla Sky"", you should rent ""Open Your Eyes"", it's a more modest movie, but it's more effective, it's better done, it doesn't have more pretensions than to tell a gripping story. ""Vanilla Sky"" follows the footsteps of the spanish movie, but it's more pretentious. Anyway, if you haven't seen the original movie, you might even like ""Vanilla Sky"", but you are advised: this is a mixed bag.",3,A MIXED BAG.,1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,2509,"['Vanilla', 'Sky', 'remake', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'film', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'might', 'notice', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'was', 'filmed', 'almost', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'duplicated', 'original', 'movie', 'are', 'key', 'differences', 'plot', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'virtually', 'same', 'movies', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'different', 'kind', 'music.This', 'movie', 'rock-oriented', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'rock', 'aficionado', 'usually', 'favorite', 'songs', 'movies', 'so', 'obviously', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'not', 'exception', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'R.E.M.', 'Radiohead', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'etc', 'problem', 'many', 'times', 'song', 'nothing', 'do', 'scene', 'Crowe', 'inserted', 'tracks', 'anyway', 'Sometimes', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'more', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'least', 'music', 'fine.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'cast', 'are', 'lot', 'familiar', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'even', 'flashy', 'cast', 'movie', 'rarely', 'highlights', 'performances.Tom', 'Cruise', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'good', 'job', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'adequate', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'exactly', 'same', 'character', 'played', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'matter', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'expanded', 'role', 'same', 'things', 'did', 'before', 'character', 'played', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'slight', 'improvement', 'original', 'character', 'Cameron', 'more', 'depth', 'performance.Of', 'course', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'visual', 'effects', 'budget', 'are', 'bigger', 'time', 'only', 'significant', 'improvement', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'technical', 'side', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'more', 'technological', 'gizmos', 'makeup', 'better', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive.But', 'technical', 'improvements', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'not', 'overall', 'improvement', 'Abre', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'matter', 'fact', 'very', 'recommendable', 'liked', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'should', 'rent', 'Open', 'Eyes', 'more', 'modest', 'movie', 'more', 'effective', 'better', 'done', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'pretensions', 'tell', 'gripping', 'story', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'footsteps', 'spanish', 'movie', 'more', 'pretentious', 'Anyway', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'movie', 'might', 'even', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'are', 'advised', 'mixed', 'bag']",Vanilla Sky VHS

589043,A3GKD8MAHURH91,B00005JKMY,alltatup,"[2, 3]","I just watched this again; it's not even a week since Katie left Tom and this film offers an extraordinary example of Cruise rising to  the challenge of portraying masculine vulnerability. He is a very good actor and I'll always love his performance in ""Born On the Fourth of July.""Vanilla Sky is a trip deep inside the mind of a suave, narcissistic, extremely rich and extremely handsome guy fantasizing about the perfect love that could have been-- that fantasy in itself is one of the symptoms of his self-destructive narcissism. Cruise's ability to be ugly on various levels was gut-wrenching in this movie: he is very raw and very exposed.

589052,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKMY,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","One of the first things you'll notice about `Vanilla Sky' is that it is a very visual piece.  From the opening canvas of empty streets, `Vanilla Sky' is almost too beautifully crafted.  It is within this visual mask that we are expected to completely fall, and thus we lose sight of the fact that this film really doesn't do much more.Seriously, it's pretty but is there really anything else that can be said for it?The film tells a very familiar tale (or at least `morally') about a man who has everything (or so it appears) because of his dashing good looks and his endless supply of wealth only to have it taken all away by a jealous lover who despises him because of his despicable personality.  Sadly, this tragic intervention (his lover drives him, literally, into the hospital) comes at the precise moment when this devilishly self-absorbed creep falls madly in love with a mysterious woman who offers him the opportunity (and motivation) to become a better man.If you feel the above paragraph is clich&eacute; ridden and rather generic, you'd be correct.The best thing I can say about `Vanilla Sky' is that Crowe paints with such an expansive and stirring paintbrush that we never really realize how dense and contrived the film really is.  We do get wrapped up in the splendor of his `vision' to the point where the films ridiculousness (and rather clumsy and chaotic plot twists) doesn't really hit us.  Maybe that should be considered praise, since Cameron Crowe made something stupid appear poignant and `deep', but I don't know if I can praise it.It's like putting lipstick on a pig; right?That was rather harsh, I know, but further reflection on this film has really embittered me, because I was so duped by Crowe's directorial achievements (you can't really say this was a good directorial job either, when you consider some of the performances).Tom Cruise is a generic and fictitious representation of what we all have probably come to consider his real self.  He is flamboyant and self concerned and borderline insane.  Penelope Cruz may have ended this decade on a very high note (her performances post 06 have been stellar) but she started this decade horrifically.  Is it just me, or has she even gotten prettier over the decade?  I really thought that she was a talentless and extremely unattractive woman until I saw `Volver'.  She is bland and ineffective here.  Jason Lee can't do drama well at all.  It is apparent here.  The whole `Kurt Russell plot point' is just the worst part of the film for me, even if his performance is effective and sound.CAMERON DIAZ.That is all I need to say here.  I mean, she is the only reason to see this movie, and the only reason I will recommend this movie, beings that her performance is so stellar and so superb and so masterful and seriously one of the best supporting turns of the decade.  The way she handles Julie's instability and ruthless jealousy (and bitter emotional devastation) is just so impressive I can't help but bow at just the thought of her flirtatious and manic threats.YOU CANNOT STOP LOOKING AT HER.Upon distanced reflection it becomes obvious that `Vanilla Sky' is just not the film it is pretending to be.  You want to like it, love it even, because it is visually stirring, which gives the impression that there is something there to be seen.  The prolific (or faux prolific) statements made with the delicately disguised sets are not enough to make this a good film.Cameron Diaz is enough to make me recommend this very poor movie though.",2,Very `vanilla'...,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,3525,"['One', 'first', 'things', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'very', 'visual', 'piece', 'opening', 'canvas', 'empty', 'streets', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'almost', 'too', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'visual', 'mask', 'are', 'expected', 'completely', 'fall', 'thus', 'lose', 'sight', 'fact', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'more.Seriously', 'pretty', 'there', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'very', 'familiar', 'tale', 'least', 'morally', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'so', 'dashing', 'good', 'looks', 'endless', 'supply', 'wealth', 'only', 'have', 'taken', 'away', 'jealous', 'lover', 'who', 'despicable', 'personality', 'Sadly', 'tragic', 'intervention', 'lover', 'literally', 'hospital', 'precise', 'moment', 'when', 'devilishly', 'self-absorbed', 'creep', 'madly', 'love', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'opportunity', 'motivation', 'become', 'better', 'man.If', 'feel', 'above', 'paragraph', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rather', 'generic', ""'d"", 'be', 'correct.The', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Crowe', 'paints', 'expansive', 'stirring', 'paintbrush', 'never', 'really', 'realize', 'how', 'dense', 'contrived', 'film', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'splendor', 'vision', 'point', 'where', 'films', 'ridiculousness', 'rather', 'clumsy', 'chaotic', 'plot', 'twists', ""n't"", 'really', 'hit', 'Maybe', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'praise', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'made', 'something', 'stupid', 'appear', 'poignant', 'deep', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'praise', 'it.It', 'putting', 'lipstick', 'pig', 'right', 'was', 'rather', 'harsh', 'know', 'further', 'reflection', 'film', 'really', 'embittered', 'was', 'so', 'duped', 'Crowe', 'directorial', 'achievements', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'directorial', 'job', 'either', 'when', 'consider', 'performances', '.Tom', 'Cruise', 'generic', 'fictitious', 'representation', 'what', 'have', 'probably', 'come', 'consider', 'real', 'self', 'flamboyant', 'self', 'concerned', 'borderline', 'insane', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'may', 'have', 'ended', 'decade', 'very', 'high', 'note', 'performances', 'post', '06', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'started', 'decade', 'horrifically', 'just', 'even', 'gotten', 'prettier', 'decade', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'talentless', 'extremely', 'unattractive', 'woman', 'saw', 'Volver', 'bland', 'ineffective', 'here', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'drama', 'well', 'apparent', 'here', 'whole', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'plot', 'point', 'just', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'performance', 'effective', 'sound.CAMERON', 'DIAZ.That', 'need', 'say', 'here', 'mean', 'only', 'reason', 'see', 'movie', 'only', 'reason', 'will', 'recommend', 'movie', 'beings', 'performance', 'so', 'stellar', 'so', 'superb', 'so', 'masterful', 'seriously', 'one', 'best', 'supporting', 'turns', 'decade', 'way', 'Julie', 'instability', 'ruthless', 'jealousy', 'bitter', 'emotional', 'devastation', 'just', 'so', 'impressive', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'bow', 'just', 'thought', 'flirtatious', 'manic', 'threats.YOU', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'STOP', 'LOOKING', 'AT', 'HER.Upon', 'distanced', 'reflection', 'obvious', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'just', 'not', 'film', 'pretending', 'be', 'want', 'like', 'love', 'even', 'visually', 'stirring', 'impression', 'something', 'there', 'be', 'seen', 'prolific', 'faux', 'prolific', 'statements', 'made', 'delicately', 'disguised', 'sets', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'film.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'enough', 'make', 'recommend', 'very', 'poor', 'movie']",Vanilla Sky VHS

Naturally, when the toughest movie for them to understand is 'America Pie,' you DO NOT even come close to reviewing Vanilla Sky. So people, please ignore the negative reviews.Vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophy to it. Dont worry, its not that deep. But the movie has its grounds in it. Tom Cruise is a rich and handsome kid who succeeds his father's multi million dollar corporation. He has everything he wants...women, sex, clothes, cars, yes-men and everything you can think of. He takes the world for granted. Nothing can bring him down...except love. He meets a beautiful girl (penelope cruz) and feels his life has been flipped. But soon an incident takes place that shows him how shallow the world can be. And the best part about the movie is his quest to do the impossible.Vanilla Sky is a movie that requires thinking and deciphering. But it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure it out.

There's nothing better than a movie which you'll think about long after you've seen it, and I'll never forget this one.The Cameron Diaz scene in the car is something you will never forget.According to Crowe, there's 4 different interpretations floating around for this movie.  The one he forwards (and directs) is the most easily digestible, but he's open to anything.BONUS about the DVD: in his audio commentary, Crowe will provide you clues and basically explain what is really going on, if you didn't catch on first viewing.  This may or may not be to your liking--if you don't like being tipped off I suggest you buy Mulholland Drive, which I'm still trying to figure out (but love regardless).Apparently a lot of people didn't like this movie because they see the name Cruise and expect action.  This is NOT an action flick--it is a psychological drama along the dreamy lines of movies like Jacob's Ladder, Mulholland Drive and even the Matrix in some respects.  Lots of clues, lots of unforgettable scenes, and here's my one clue that doesn't give too much away: LISTEN TO THE MUSIC.  The songs are all cues in themselves.Hell even the Paul McCartney song at the end of the movie is good!  When was the last time you could say that?Great movie.

To say this remake of the original Spanish version of the film is an exercise in stream of consciousness and exploration of different reality perspectives and multiple forms of truth and experience is the understatement of the year. At several points I got a headache trying to figure out what was really going on, and although it was obvious that a lot of the sequences were dream-based excursions, trying to keep any kind of meaningful storyline straight became personally difficult.  Finally, then, I gave up the ghost of logic, and just enjoyed the sequences for what they were; an emotional roller-coaster ride.This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the film, for the performances of Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz were all quite good. Based on what I understood, I thought Cameron Diaz literally stole the movie in terms of the level of performance she delivered, with a range of emotions so well covered that she was entirely believable throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz is drop-dead gorgeous, and could make me believe anything she wants with a simple flutter of her eyelashes and those big beautiful eyes. And even Tom Cruise, a terrific actor who sometimes grates on my nerves with his reliance on his over-earnest macho deadpans as a way of ""emoting"" was very good here. His sense of desperate bewilderment and incomprehensible confusion is telling, and he really does seem to be way over the edge and visibly out of control and out of his element as a result of all that whirling around (and within) him.The movie is well choreographed and extremely pleasing in terms of the way it has been filmed, so that it is very colorful, eventful, and suspenseful. The plot is so convoluted that no mathematician could unravel it, so the best way to approach the movie is as an object exercise in alternative realities and how one copes with the possibilities. It is a bit pretentious in its ambitions, and it by no means successfully executes whatever vision it has. But it is good (if sometime confusing) entertainment, and I highly recommend it.

Miraculously, I hadn't learned the ending of this movie so I was prepared to enjoy a well-made movie (it has to be well made with Cameron Crowe directing) with a surprise ending.  I was disappointed on all counts.The movie losely tells the story of Cruise's character falling in love with Cruz' character while Cameron Diaz begins to stalk him.  She disfigures him while wrecking her car and killing herself.  Cruise rebuilds his life enough to enter into a relationship with Cruz.  But nightmares and visions keep coming back in the form of Cameron Diaz.The story appears to be being told in flashback fashion because we know that Cruise is in jail for murder and being interviewed by a pshychiatrist.  So while watching the movie, I want to know about the murder and also about all of the weird dreams Tom Cruise is having?Close to the end, I gave up on following what was happening because it became to convoluted and confusing.  It quit being a movie and became just a bunch of scenes thrown together.Then came the ending.  Finally everything is explained.  All of the earlier scenes make sense.  But also the earlier scenes and the entire movie become a meaningless waste of time.  I don't want to give away why, but let me just say that the movie should have ended after Cruise passes out drunk in the street.So much of the drama, emotion, and relationships in the movie was rendered useless by the ending.

It deals with many topics that interest me, particularly the study of dreams vs. reality, and the nature of relationships, and love. There is much that is very good about it, however it contains one major flaw that prevents it from being truly great.The acting, is overall top notch. Jason Lee turns in yet again another stellar supporting role; he radiates charisma in this performance, and fits the role given perfectly. Cameron Diaz is a fine choice for Julianna, she brings an almost maniacal sense of urgency to her character that was both disturbing and complusively watchable; she simply looks amazing on film. Tom Cruise performs more than adaquetly as well, and perhaps the greatest kudos must be given to Penelope Cruz, who simply lights up the screen here. Her charisma is unmistakable, and she infuses this film with life and vibrancy. This is a film with many powerful images, be it the gorgeous vanilla skies that soar over New York within the dream, or the (SPOILER) unforgettable image of Cruise's David Aames waving farewell to his disfigured reflection in the mirror. It entices in the first viewing, draws you in irresistably, and apon further viewings still moves with great pacing, and many subtle clues and hints can be found that help the viewer understand the nature of David Aame's reality. My only real complaint is that Cameron Crowe for some inexplicable reason (though it certainly must have been because of confused test audiencies, those who this film is not intended for anyway) chose to come out at the end of the film and blatantly reveal all of the films secrets and twists; he talks to the viewer as if we were 5 years old and need him to hold our hand. This film could have been very similar in nature to, and even rivaled Lynch's masterpiece Mulholland Drive had Crowe not chosen to do so, and it is very disappointing that he did in fact choose to do so. But this aside, the film is very compelling and often powerful. I still love the questions it raises concerning love (if his love with Sofia wasnt ""real"", than does it still have meaning?), and the image of ""I will find you in another life, when we are both cats"" that so powerfully emphasizes the power that love can have, and the joy and awe surrounding that human emotion. For a similar image look in the closing chapters of the novel The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman. But i digress. This film is solid, even coming from hollywood, and with big name stars attached. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who is willing to be challenged slightly by the film they watch, and those who love to be moved.Highly Recommended",4,An amazing film that could have been stellar,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,2717,"['have', 'watched', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'time', 'left', 'powerfully', 'affected', 'many', 'topics', 'interest', 'particularly', 'study', 'dreams', 'vs.', 'reality', 'nature', 'relationships', 'love', 'much', 'very', 'good', 'however', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'being', 'truly', 'great.The', 'acting', 'overall', 'top', 'notch', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'yet', 'again', 'stellar', 'supporting', 'role', 'charisma', 'performance', 'role', 'given', 'perfectly', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'fine', 'choice', 'Julianna', 'almost', 'maniacal', 'sense', 'urgency', 'character', 'was', 'disturbing', 'complusively', 'watchable', 'simply', 'amazing', 'film', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'more', 'adaquetly', 'well', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'kudos', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'simply', 'up', 'screen', 'here', 'charisma', 'unmistakable', 'film', 'life', 'vibrancy', 'film', 'many', 'powerful', 'images', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'vanilla', 'skies', 'soar', 'New', 'York', 'dream', 'SPOILER', 'unforgettable', 'image', 'Cruise', 'David', 'Aames', 'waving', 'farewell', 'disfigured', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'first', 'viewing', 'irresistably', 'further', 'viewings', 'still', 'great', 'pacing', 'many', 'subtle', 'clues', 'hints', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'help', 'viewer', 'understand', 'nature', 'David', 'Aame', 'reality', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'certainly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'confused', 'test', 'audiencies', 'who', 'film', 'not', 'intended', 'anyway', 'chose', 'come', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'blatantly', 'reveal', 'films', 'secrets', 'twists', 'viewer', 'were', '5', 'years', 'old', 'need', 'hold', 'hand', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'similar', 'nature', 'even', 'rivaled', 'Lynch', 'masterpiece', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'had', 'Crowe', 'not', 'chosen', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'disappointing', 'did', 'fact', 'choose', 'do', 'so', 'aside', 'film', 'very', 'compelling', 'often', 'powerful', 'still', 'love', 'questions', 'concerning', 'love', 'love', 'Sofia', 'wasnt', 'real', 'still', 'have', 'meaning', 'image', 'will', 'find', 'life', 'when', 'are', 'cats', 'so', 'powerfully', 'power', 'love', 'can', 'have', 'joy', 'awe', 'surrounding', 'human', 'emotion', 'similar', 'image', 'look', 'closing', 'chapters', 'novel', 'Amber', 'Spyglass', 'Philip', 'Pullman', 'i', 'digress', 'film', 'solid', 'even', 'coming', 'hollywood', 'big', 'name', 'stars', 'attached', 'would', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'willing', 'be', 'challenged', 'slightly', 'film', 'watch', 'who', 'love', 'be', 'moved.Highly', 'Recommended']",Vanilla Sky VHS

The choices that were made in both the casting and script revisions in this American remake are simply abysmal. Cameron Crowe lays on a cheap sentimentalism through the film's sappy soundtrack and nostalgic homages to classic cultural influences, but these are only minor distractions compared to the shockingly bad performances by Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, and Jason Lee. It is as if each of these actors mistook the screenplay as a comedy of some sort given their outlandish efforts. Cruise is the film's greatest liability, since his erratic behavior reduces the brilliant character drama into a silly farce. Crowe presumes that his American audience will be far less perceptive than the world viewers that praised the original, so he drops blatant visual clues throughout the film that clearly delineate dreams from reality. In doing so, he eliminates the subtle effectiveness that Amen&aacute;bar worked so hard to create in his cleverly-designed plot. The beautiful irony in all of this is that the viewer will hope to wake up from the same horrible nightmare that David has found himself in by the end of the movie.

589089,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00005JKMY,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[28, 42]","""Vanilla Sky"" is an unremarkable American remake of the excellent Spanish film, ""Abre los Ojos"" (Open Your Eyes). In each film, the plots are virtually identical. A wealthy, privileged, and handsome young man, David Ames (Tom Cruise) has a girlfriend, Julie (Cameron Diaz) whom he scarcely values and a best friend, Brian (Jason Lee) whom he treats shabbily. During his birthday party, David meets and falls in love with Brian's date, Sophia (Penelope Cruz), and ignoring the potential consequences to his friendship with Brian, he spends an idyllic, platonic, evening with her. Subsequently, however, a series of bizarre events radically disrupt David's life and his sense of confidence, which leads both him and the film's viewers to question what is real and what has actually happened to him.In the introductory remarks to the DVD, producer and star Tom Cruise describes how impressed he was with ""Abre los Ojos"", and how after viewing the film he felt as though he had overheard a conversation in which he himself would like to participate. Had Cruise and director Cameron Crowe made any unique contributions to the story then perhaps he could have gotten his wish. Unfortunately with ""Vanilla Sky"", Cruise hasn't joined the conversation but has reproduced it with more money, more visuals, and hyperbola.""Vanilla Sky"" is in fact a visual movie and it's tempting to argue that perhaps it is a visual interpretation of ""Abre los Ojos"". (It isn't.) In ""Vanilla Sky"" many of the clues about David's life are rendered visually and at the end of the film they are explained in purely pictorial terms. This is a sharp departure from ""Abre los Ojos"" which develops its psychology and dramatic tension through dialog and through very accessible characters. It is easier for us to identify with Cesar (the protagonist in ""Abre los Ojos"") than with David because we feel that while his lifestyle may differ from most of ours, he is still human in the same way that we are. ""Vanilla Sky"", by contrast, places its' characters in a realm of privilege beyond our reach by effectively glamorizing them. The protagonist is no longer just a wealthy, privileged youth, he is now the CEO of a company in New York city. His girlfriend is no longer just some woman he picked up, she is now a famous celebrity. It's as though Crowe is shouting, ""look, this story is too good to have `normal' characters, so I'm going to invest them with superstar status. ""Abre los Ojos"" give us universally recognizable people and ""Vanilla Sky"" gives us caricatures from Entertainment Tonight, People Magazine, and Vanity Fair. Don't get me wrong, Tom Cruise is hardly a bad actor, but in this film he pretty much plays himself: a handsome, wealthy guy. Despite the film's excessive glamorization of Julie, Cameron Diaz manages to infuse her with genuine human feeling. In an extremely believable moment of rage and vulnerability, the love struck Julie confronts David with the declaration ""your body makes promises even when you don't!"" This memorable sentence is perhaps this film version's only significant contribution to the story.While Cruise and Crowe inflate the appearance of their characters, they also manages to suck the wind out of the story's powerful conclusion. Without giving away the conclusion it is safe to say that by the end of the film symbolism and reality collide sharply. The conclusion of ""Abre los Ojos"" makes a courageous distinction between the two, while ""Vanilla Sky"" just can't bring itself to do so. Having inflated the appearance of its characters and setting, Cruise can't seem to face the stark implications of the conversation he desperately wanted to be part of. At the end of the film, Cruise and Crowe make a small but very important change to both the plot and to Sophia's character that render their version of the film, a flashy, and sentimental distortion of the real thing.The philosophical and psychological concepts of this film are fascinating but it is more appropriate to discuss them in my review of ""Abre los Ojos"".",2,A Flashy Imitation of the Real Thing,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,4035,"['Vanilla', 'Sky', 'unremarkable', 'American', 'remake', 'excellent', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'film', 'plots', 'are', 'virtually', 'identical', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'David', 'Ames', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'whom', 'scarcely', 'best', 'friend', 'Brian', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'whom', 'shabbily', 'birthday', 'party', 'David', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'Brian', 'date', 'Sophia', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'ignoring', 'potential', 'consequences', 'friendship', 'Brian', 'idyllic', 'platonic', 'evening', 'Subsequently', 'however', 'series', 'bizarre', 'events', 'radically', 'disrupt', 'David', 'life', 'sense', 'confidence', 'film', 'viewers', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'actually', 'happened', 'him.In', 'introductory', 'remarks', 'DVD', 'producer', 'star', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'how', 'impressed', 'was', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'how', 'viewing', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'overheard', 'conversation', 'would', 'like', 'participate', 'Had', 'Cruise', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'made', 'unique', 'contributions', 'story', 'then', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'wish', 'Unfortunately', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Cruise', ""n't"", 'joined', 'conversation', 'reproduced', 'more', 'money', 'more', 'visuals', 'hyperbola', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'fact', 'visual', 'movie', 'tempting', 'argue', 'perhaps', 'visual', 'interpretation', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', ""n't"", 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'many', 'clues', 'David', 'life', 'are', 'rendered', 'visually', 'end', 'film', 'are', 'explained', 'purely', 'pictorial', 'terms', 'sharp', 'departure', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'psychology', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'dialog', 'very', 'accessible', 'characters', 'easier', 'identify', 'Cesar', 'protagonist', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'David', 'feel', 'lifestyle', 'may', 'differ', 'most', 'ours', 'still', 'human', 'same', 'way', 'are', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'contrast', 'characters', 'realm', 'privilege', 'reach', 'effectively', 'glamorizing', 'protagonist', 'longer', 'just', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'youth', 'now', 'CEO', 'company', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'girlfriend', 'longer', 'just', 'woman', 'picked', 'up', 'now', 'famous', 'celebrity', 'Crowe', 'shouting', 'look', 'story', 'too', 'good', 'have', 'normal', 'characters', ""'m"", 'going', 'invest', 'superstar', 'status', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'give', 'universally', 'recognizable', 'people', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'caricatures', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'People', 'Magazine', 'Vanity', 'Fair', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'hardly', 'bad', 'actor', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'guy', 'film', 'excessive', 'glamorization', 'Julie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'infuse', 'genuine', 'human', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'believable', 'moment', 'rage', 'vulnerability', 'love', 'struck', 'Julie', 'confronts', 'David', 'declaration', 'body', 'promises', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'sentence', 'perhaps', 'film', 'version', 'only', 'significant', 'contribution', 'story.While', 'Cruise', 'Crowe', 'inflate', 'appearance', 'characters', 'also', 'suck', 'wind', 'story', 'powerful', 'conclusion', 'giving', 'away', 'conclusion', 'safe', 'say', 'end', 'film', 'symbolism', 'reality', 'collide', 'sharply', 'conclusion', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'courageous', 'distinction', 'two', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'do', 'so', 'Having', 'inflated', 'appearance', 'characters', 'setting', 'Cruise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'face', 'stark', 'implications', 'conversation', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'be', 'part', 'end', 'film', 'Cruise', 'Crowe', 'make', 'small', 'very', 'important', 'change', 'plot', 'Sophia', 'character', 'render', 'version', 'film', 'flashy', 'sentimental', 'distortion', 'real', 'thing.The', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'concepts', 'film', 'are', 'fascinating', 'more', 'appropriate', 'discuss', 'review', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos']",Vanilla Sky VHS
589090,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00005JKMY,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 3]","David Aames (Tom Cruise) is the head of a vast publishing empire that he inherited from his father. Besides being at the epicenter of all that is hip in Art, Music, and Literature, he also has good looks, youth, and last but not least, lots and lots of money. He is Citizen Kane, or perhaps Citizen something else--the less than flattering nickname his underlings call him behind his back (See comment). He has a 'friends with benefits' arrangement with Julie Gianni (Cameran Diaz) but when he sees Sofia Serrano (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) at his birthday party, he jokes about Julie as a twisted pick up line for Sofia:---------David Aames: See, I've got this little problem. I've got a stalker.Sof&iacute;a: It doesn't sound life threatening.David Aames: But I need a cover. I need for you to pretend we're having a scintillating conversation, and you are wildly entertained.[Both laugh]David Aames: I know it's tough.Sof&iacute;a: I'll improvise.===================Whoa! This ploy actually works, but the joke backfires on David Aames. The joke turns out to be the truth.------------Sof&iacute;a: I think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a martini.====================There are 428 pop culture references in Vanilla Sky, according to writer/director Cameron Crowe. 429 if you count one that was made accidentally. One that was made on purpose was when David Aames (Tom Cruise) walked down the street with Sofia Serrano (Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) and it looked just like Robert Zimmerman and Suze Rotolo on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan album cover. Pay attention. This is a clue. There will be a test.-------------------------David Aames: My dreams are a cruel joke. They taunt me. Even in my dreams I'm an idiot... who knows he's about to wake up to reality. If I could only avoid sleep. But I can't. I try to tell myself what to dream. I try to dream that I am flying. Something free. It never works...==============================Cameron Crowe really knows his cultural references, as he was a child prodigy rock critic who began writing for Rolling Stone while still in High School. He made Almost Famous in 2000, which was a fictionalized autobiography based on his experience, and in 2001 he followed it up with Vanilla Sky. Based on Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's 1997 film ""Abre Los Ojos"" that also starred Pen&eacute;lope Cruz; Vanilla Sky was Crowe's Magnum Opus. His Magnolia. His Citizen Kane, or rather Citizen Blank (see comment). Along with the 429 cultural references he also crammed in Citizen Kane, Magnolia, Mask with Cher, The Mask with Cameran Diaz and Jim Carrey, Franois Truffaut's Jules et Jim, La Belle et la bte by the poet Jean Cocteau, Johnny Handsome with Mickey Rourke, The Matrix, and The Phantom of the Opera. It seems like he put everything but the kitchen sink into Vanilla Sky and it must have broken his heart when he was crucified by the press and the film didn't do so well at the box office, either.------------------------David Aames: I wanna wake up! Tech support! It's a nightmare! Tech support! Tech support!===========================Perhaps this is just a Minority Report, but I really enjoyed Vanilla Sky. I think it was very ambitious but Crowe was able to pull it off after all. He bit off a lot, but it was NOT--as some critics have suggested--more than he could chew. Some people might have been confused, and others might have thought that it explained itself too much in the end (or did it?), but I thought Cameron Crowe balanced himself on the high wire between those extremes, while simultaneously juggling the 429 cultural references and the multiple levels of reality. Where most directors would just take on one story arc, Crowe goes for about 4. Boy meets his reflection in the mirror, boy loses his reflection, boy tries to get his perfect reflection back, boy gets his reflection back--or does he? And it all unravels (or does it?).Tom Cruise and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz had all the chemistry that Cruise lacked with his then real life wife Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. Cruz was magical and Cruise gave a stellar performance. He almost jumps on the couch on Oprah, but dials it back just enough. It was a bold performance, as in the first part he is kind of a jerk, but semi likeable, considering he has had the world handed to him on a silver platter. In the next part he has to adjust to life without his movie star smile. His face is hideously disfigured. He doesn't take it well, and is an even bigger jerk. I think this was brave and one of Tom Cruise's boldest roles. He is forced to actually act here, and not just smile and let the audience bask in his smile. He is not just cruising on auto pilot. Though Pen&eacute;lope Cruz obviously makes his job so much easier.Cameran Diaz did well as the F W/ B, or the FB for short (See Comment). She seems like she is content with the friendship with benefits, but then she lowers the boom! Big Time. Rumor has it that the character called Kelly from Lost in Translation was based on Miss Diaz. Writer/director Sofia Copolla's husband Spike Jonze directed Cameran in Being John Malkovich (again, see comment). Sofia/Sofia, Cameron/Cameran, Cruise/Cruz? I don't know what any of that means, but there's something about Diaz, ""the saddest girl to ever hold a martini.""Jason Lee plays David's wing man Brian, an aspiring writer. What is it with Jason Lee's movie career? He is the perennial 2nd banana (Heartbreakers being the exception that proves the rule). Lee was 2nd banana to Ben Affleck in Chasing Amy (who is himself the perennial 2nd banana to Matt Damon). 2nd banana to David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool, even, where his character is also a writer, just like in Vanilla Sky. It's one thing to play 2nd banana to Tom Cruise, but once you have 2nd bananaed Schwimmer, you better take that offer to be on a sit com about karma called ""My Name is Earl,"" because your movie career is in what is known in show biz as a rut.Jason Lee was also a rock singer in Cameron Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous, but he was kind of a 2nd banana there, too. He was the Greg Almon to Billy Crudup's Duane Almon, so even though he was the lead singer, he was upstaged by the guitarist, and thus was also the 2nd banana, again. 3rd banana, if you count the kid who was supposed to be the young Cameron Crowe. Jason Lee was more than adequate as Cruise's 2nd banana here, but nothing to write home about.The film also features the talents of Timothy Spall, Johnny Gallecki, Alicia Witt, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, and Tilda Swinton; and a great soundtrack, with well chosen tunes from Radiohead, The Rolling Stones, Todd Rundgren, The Beach Boys, a 3D hologram of John Coltrane, Creeper Lagoon, The Monkees, R.E.M., Elmer Bernstein, Jeff Buckley, Bob Dylan, Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor, Bj&ouml;rk; and Paul McCartney even recorded a song called Vanilla Sky especially for this film. The songs, an integral part of the 429 cultural references, are woven seamlessly into the tapestry of Vanilla Sky.-------------Dr. Curtis McCabe: My favorite Beatle was once John. Now it's...

589091,ANBSW3BALFRR2,B00005JKMY,Chet Fakir,"[0, 0]","Confusing and somewhat nonsensical until the last 30 minutes when all is made clear, Vanilla Sky is an odd conflation of psychological thriller and science fiction. It's not a great movie, the original Spanish movie was far superior, but it was entertaining. Tom Cruise plays his usual over-confident douchebag role to the hilt, as he always does.

I have taste (eheh, or so I think...).  Look, for those that disagree, I'd like to speak to you first, and concede a few things:This movie IS confusing...Insanely confusing, and it took allot of appreciation away from my first screening.  Also, it is stuffed with allot of &quot;cinematic sweetener&quot;; almost acts like a music video at times, unbelievably fashionable, even the dialogue pushes the limits and sometimes swims past the buoys of practical.That said (and without giving anything away to those who haven't seen it), I think it's helpful to consider this not as a drama, but as a Science Fiction movie.  It really is; but it masquerades as a drama up until the end.  That can be frustrating for unprepared viewers, and lends itself to even more confusion as to what is going on.I'm a huge believer in the technology that plays a central role in the dramatic climax.  I think it will change everything.  So granted, that aspect lent a particular attraction for me to the film.  However, I think the lesson of the movie is important for everyone [and this is my interpretation], &quot;you make your own life, and it's really not about the big decisions, it's about the small ones that aggregate to form your orientation; orientation that could serve as gravity for good things in your life, or bad&quot;.Nothing new, nothing earth shattering.  However, that lesson, folded into some of the best cinematography, best music, and darn good acting......it earned my five stars, and more than that...I truly love this film.For those who haven't seen it, please know ahead of time that it'll be confusing...try and watch somewhere you can give it good attention (hard to do at 3 hours, but worth it; I've seen over 5 times).Hope this was helpful.",5,One of my top 10 favorite movies.,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,1916,"['tar', 'feather', 'consider', 'movie', 'shares', 'top', 'ten', 'likes', 'Wonderful', 'LifeEmpire', 'SunAs', 'Good', 'GetsI', ""'m"", 'not', 'moron', 'have', 'taste', 'eheh', 'so', 'think', 'Look', 'disagree', ""'d"", 'like', 'speak', 'first', 'concede', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'confusing', 'Insanely', 'confusing', 'took', 'allot', 'appreciation', 'away', 'first', 'screening', 'Also', 'stuffed', 'allot', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'sweetener', 'quot', 'almost', 'music', 'video', 'times', 'unbelievably', 'fashionable', 'even', 'dialogue', 'limits', 'sometimes', 'swims', 'buoys', 'practical.That', 'said', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', 'helpful', 'consider', 'not', 'drama', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'movie', 'really', 'drama', 'up', 'end', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'unprepared', 'viewers', 'even', 'more', 'confusion', 'what', 'going', 'on.I', ""'m"", 'huge', 'believer', 'technology', 'central', 'role', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'think', 'will', 'change', 'everything', 'So', 'granted', 'aspect', 'lent', 'particular', 'attraction', 'film', 'However', 'think', 'lesson', 'movie', 'important', 'everyone', '[', 'interpretation', ']', 'quot', 'make', 'own', 'life', 'really', 'not', 'big', 'decisions', 'small', 'ones', 'aggregate', 'form', 'orientation', 'orientation', 'could', 'serve', 'gravity', 'good', 'things', 'life', 'bad', 'quot', '.Nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'earth', 'shattering', 'However', 'lesson', 'folded', 'best', 'cinematography', 'best', 'music', 'darn', 'good', 'acting', 'earned', 'five', 'stars', 'more', 'truly', 'love', 'film.For', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'please', 'know', 'ahead', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'confusing', 'try', 'watch', 'somewhere', 'can', 'give', 'good', 'attention', 'hard', 'do', '3', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'seen', '5', 'times', '.Hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Vanilla Sky VHS

589098,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JKMY,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 2]","Back in 1997, spanish director Alejandro Amenabar directed Open Your Eyes, a cult film of sorts that was quite well done and made you think. Cameron Crowe, writer/director of Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous decided to remake it(or as he says, a ""cover version"" of it). And so we have Vanilla Sky, a film that sounds bigger than it is.David Aames works for a fashion magazine and he's one of those owners that just shows up because he has to but he doesn't do a lot, kind of prances around and does very little. He's a bit self-serving and has a **** buddy in case he doesn't end up in a relationship. He meets Sofia, a beautiful woman who he instantly falls for overnight. Later that morning, he is stopped by his f*** buddy Julie and offers a ride/talk, however she goes nuts and wants more than just casual sex and ends up driving him and her off a bridge. She dies, he lives and we find he's recounting his story about how he murdered his girlfriend later on in flashback style.To go any further than that would create more confusion and just plain ruin it but it does take some twists and turns and unlike other psychological films that makes you question the reality of the film, the film makes you question it almost haphazardly like you're supposed to question everything without so much an explanation as why that can't be trusted or that with you being kept in the dark. The ending/reveal at the end is neat in a way but apparently there's 4 different interpretations of it.As for the leads, as usual with people, the handsomest/prettiest actors and actresses people think they can't act. Tom can pull off a good performance and he certainly pulls one off here, it's quite surprising. Cameron Diaz is quite a complicated one because she can be smiling and her eyes suggest something else entirely and Jason Lee can pull off dramatic roles despite being known primarily as Brodie from the Kevin Smith movies. Penelope Cruz, who's quite the looker(the scene at the end on the rooftop, the way she's filmed and lit she looks downright gorgeous), she's kind of flat as a character, maybe it's her speech. She tends to speak kind of soft english.Watch the film and make what you want out of it because there's not a lot of these films being made, just too bad this one was almost there.",4,Good but almost reaches the mark,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2290,"['Back', '1997', 'spanish', 'director', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'directed', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'cult', 'film', 'sorts', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'made', 'think', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'writer/director', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'decided', 'remake', 'cover', 'version', 'so', 'have', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'film', 'bigger', 'is.David', 'Aames', 'fashion', 'magazine', 'one', 'owners', 'just', 'up', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'kind', 'prances', 'very', 'little', 'bit', 'self-serving', '****', 'buddy', 'case', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'relationship', 'Sofia', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'instantly', 'overnight', 'Later', 'morning', 'stopped', 'f***', 'buddy', 'Julie', 'ride/talk', 'however', 'nuts', 'more', 'just', 'casual', 'sex', 'up', 'driving', 'off', 'bridge', 'find', 'recounting', 'story', 'how', 'murdered', 'girlfriend', 'later', 'flashback', 'style.To', 'go', 'further', 'would', 'create', 'more', 'confusion', 'just', 'plain', 'ruin', 'take', 'twists', 'turns', 'other', 'psychological', 'films', 'question', 'reality', 'film', 'film', 'question', 'almost', 'haphazardly', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'question', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'explanation', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'trusted', 'being', 'kept', 'dark', 'ending/reveal', 'end', 'neat', 'way', 'apparently', '4', 'different', 'interpretations', 'it.As', 'leads', 'usual', 'people', 'handsomest/prettiest', 'actors', 'people', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Tom', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'good', 'performance', 'certainly', 'one', 'off', 'here', 'quite', 'surprising', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'quite', 'complicated', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'smiling', 'eyes', 'suggest', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'being', 'known', 'primarily', 'Brodie', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'movies', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'quite', 'looker', 'scene', 'end', 'rooftop', 'way', 'filmed', 'lit', 'downright', 'gorgeous', 'kind', 'flat', 'character', 'maybe', 'speech', 'speak', 'kind', 'soft', 'english.Watch', 'film', 'make', 'what', 'want', 'not', 'lot', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'one', 'was', 'almost', 'there']",Vanilla Sky VHS

He's never worked for anything but had everything handed to him by those around him.  Even his on-again-off-again F@#$-buddy Julie (Diaz) gives him everything she can regandless of how he treats her.  His best friend played by Jason Lee is a loyal friend dispite the fact that David disregards his feelings on the drop of a dime, even going as far as to take the one woman that his friend really ""digs""...that woman being the exotic Sofia (Cruz), a guest at his birthday party, a guest that his Jason Lee brings as a date but she ends up taking David home.  At this point of the film you really dislike this guy.  He rich, good looking and pretty much better than everyone else, and he knows it, so he flaunts it.  Then the morning comes, and with the sun comes a gloomy day, a very gloomy day.  Julie meets David outside Sofia's apartment and confronts him about his feelings for Sofia.  She tells him she loves him and that she needs him and then...BAM! she drives him off a bridge and into a wall and here is where you need to open your eyes!  From that point on the film spirals down towards an ending that wil have you guessing.  From the murder charge he can't explain nor understand to the life he can't be living and the dreams/nightmares that he is having and theres this guy that keeps showing up in bars and clubs and he's almost everywhere that David turns.  WHO IS THIS MAN?  Open your eyes...you'll see him very soon.  The acting is superb on the parts of the lesser players.

When a remake tries to mirror the original in certain scenes to the point of paraphrasing the dialogue, it can't be that good.  Surely some innovation is required to lift it above the original, yes?Basically, David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a spoiled millionaire whose parents left him in control of three magazines in a worldwide publishing house.  He has 51% control, but seven other shareholders, derogatorily known as the Seven Dwarfs, have the other 49% and have nothing but contempt for this breezy, smug, playboy.  At his 33rd birthday party, he's introduced to his best friend Brian's new girl Sofia, and falls for her.  Feeling that he has been ""snowboarding through life with no focus,"" Sofia tells him that ""every passing moment is another chance to turn it around.""However, before he can make good on that chance, he gets in a car accident that damages his face.  His good looks gone, and his life goes downhill as a result.  All the time, he's telling this to a psychologist while in prison for murder, a murder he insists he didn't commit.  David thinks the Seven Dwarfs have set him up in order to wrest control of the publishing house.  His face is repaired eventually, but things take a turn for the weird.Cruise plays himself as usual, arrogant, smug, cocky, with a smile that makes me side with the Seven Dwarfs.  He acts nonchalantly in a scene where he and Brian are nearly killed in a car accident, laughing with Brian when the latter says ""Your whole life flashed before my eyes--almost worth dying for.""Jason Lee (Brian) comes off the best here, not bad in a drama role, but someone who in contrast to Cruise is the average guy yearning for that girl of his dreams, but can't compete.  He has a good line to that effect:  ""you don't know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone"" and also his speech on love being the sour and the sweet, where the former makes one appreciate the latter.Penelope Cruz really has a thankless role here.  It's bad enough that she has to reprise a role which she did three years before, but she isn't as good-looking as she was in the original.Cameron Diaz has a smile that lights up her whole face, and plays Julianna, a girl David treats callously, as someone who shows some deep feelings through her shallowness.  She even tells David in the car, ""when you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not.""And Kurt Russell as the psychologist is clearly modelled after his Spanish counterpart Cheta Lara, down to glasses and beard.Maybe the cinematography of Monet's vanilla sky realized, plus Nancy Wilson's melancholy theme ""Elevator Beat"" made it worth watching, but other than that...  All in all, way inferior to the Spanish original, which I hope those of you who haven't seen this watch first instead.

589107,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JKMY,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Tom Cruise proves himself to be a gifted actor, the angelic Penelope Cruz is delightful, Cameron Diaz is great; even Kurt Russell shines in his role.  So many people complain about Hollywood, deriding the fact that today's movies are unoriginal, yet many folks don't seem to appreciate a truly &quot;different&quot; movie when it comes along.  I know, this is a remake of the Spanish Obre las Ojos, yet it does represent something unique among recent American releases.  I can also understand why some people may be confused about the movie as the story progresses, but I found it quite understandable by the end.  The issues this movie addresses are &quot;deep,&quot; but they get to the heart of life and existence for the individual soul.  Reality, dreams, desires, disappointments--these are the determiners of life itself, and any movie that can really make you think about your own life and existence in a serious manner wins my highest praises.  I won't even talk about the plot of this movie here--this movie has to be experienced; it cannot be explained.  Don't worry about where the movie is going; just enjoy the ride.  I would urge the viewer to devote a full 130 minutes to watching it; if you pause it to talk to your neighbor or mess around in the kitchen, you run the risk of losing comprehension and rob yourself of the spectacular aura this movie wraps around you.This strikes me as rather a bold career move for Tom Cruise, especially given the fact that his character has his face disfigured in an accident.  Of course, there could be no better way for him to define himself as a great actor.  I love Penelope Cruz--her beauty is matched by a mesmerizing air of mystery which plays incredibly well in this particular motion picture.  As for the DVD's special features, they are OK but not exceptional.  There is a seven-minute mini-feature about the making of the movie--it doesn't really give any secrets away, but I would definitely watch it only after viewing the movie.  Another mini-feature provides us with glimpses of the worldwide tour by Cruise, Cruz, and director Cameron Crowe.  The interview with Paul McCartney is short and sweet, and I must admit that I didn't realize that he had contributed the &quot;title song&quot; to the movie until I watched the interview.  Even if there were no extras, Vanilla Sky is definitely a movie worth owning.  While I have only watched it once, the intricacies of the plot make this a prime candidate for the mantle of rewatchability.  If you approach this movie with an open mind and let the story absorb you into its unique world, I do not see how you can walk away disappointed.",5,A mesmerizing masterpiece,1025913600,"07 6, 2002",2002,2682,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'be', 'gifted', 'actor', 'angelic', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'delightful', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'great', 'even', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'shines', 'role', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'complain', 'Hollywood', 'deriding', 'fact', 'today', 'movies', 'are', 'unoriginal', 'yet', 'many', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'appreciate', 'truly', 'quot', 'different', 'quot', 'movie', 'when', 'along', 'know', 'remake', 'Spanish', 'Obre', 'las', 'Ojos', 'yet', 'represent', 'something', 'unique', 'recent', 'American', 'releases', 'can', 'also', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'confused', 'movie', 'story', 'found', 'quite', 'understandable', 'end', 'issues', 'movie', 'addresses', 'are', 'quot', 'deep', 'quot', 'get', 'heart', 'life', 'existence', 'individual', 'soul', 'Reality', 'dreams', 'desires', 'disappointments', 'are', 'determiners', 'life', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'own', 'life', 'existence', 'serious', 'manner', 'wins', 'highest', 'praises', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'talk', 'plot', 'movie', 'here', 'movie', 'be', 'experienced', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'where', 'movie', 'going', 'just', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'would', 'urge', 'viewer', 'devote', 'full', '130', 'minutes', 'watching', 'pause', 'talk', 'neighbor', 'mess', 'kitchen', 'run', 'risk', 'losing', 'comprehension', 'rob', 'spectacular', 'aura', 'movie', 'you.This', 'strikes', 'rather', 'bold', 'career', 'move', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', 'character', 'face', 'disfigured', 'accident', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'way', 'define', 'great', 'actor', 'love', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'beauty', 'matched', 'mesmerizing', 'air', 'mystery', 'incredibly', 'well', 'particular', 'motion', 'picture', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'OK', 'not', 'exceptional', 'seven-minute', 'mini-feature', 'making', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'secrets', 'away', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'only', 'viewing', 'movie', 'mini-feature', 'glimpses', 'worldwide', 'tour', 'Cruise', 'Cruz', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'interview', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'short', 'sweet', 'must', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'contributed', 'quot', 'title', 'song', 'quot', 'movie', 'watched', 'interview', 'Even', 'were', 'extras', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'definitely', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'once', 'intricacies', 'plot', 'make', 'prime', 'candidate', 'mantle', 'rewatchability', 'approach', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'let', 'story', 'absorb', 'unique', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'walk', 'away', 'disappointed']",Vanilla Sky VHS

On the other hand, it must be said that sometimes what makes a movie all the more one's own is knowing how groundbreaking it is and that with time others will realize the same.  In a country that typically favors thin story/big action (a la ID4 or Blade), Vanilla Sky is the absolute antithesis.Cameron Crowe's superb genre-twisting thriller is one of the most intricately woven and ultimately satisfying I've ever seen.  Every element- from the script to the sound to the editing to the acting -is top notch.A man in a facial prosthetic gives the account of the last few months of his life to a psychiatrist from a prison cell.

There is no emotion you'll cease to feel and no genre that goes unrepresented. There is love, fear, confusion, awe, humor, exhilaration,  and gratification.

589116,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005JKMY,Dennis Littrell,"[43, 63]","Here in Vanilla Sky, a thoughtful reprise of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997), directed by Alejandro Amenabar, we have Tom Cruise, American heart throb and box office buffo paired with his current true love, the amazingly beautiful and very talented Penelope Cruz.Guess what happens.  The public doesn't like him.  Even though this is a more finely structured and comprehensible film than Open Your Eyes (we'll get to that in moment), Tom Cruise is NOT sympathetic, or at least it takes us until near the end of the film to feel any sympathy for him, and then perhaps what we feel most sympathetic for is the mask that is Tom Cruise in most of the later reels.I think the problem is that Cruise is miscast.  Unlike Eduardo Noriega, who played the same part in the film directed by Alejandro Amenabar, Cruise is too cute and too privileged to elicit our sympathy.  We almost feel his character has it coming.  After all, he willingly got into the car with his ""stalker"" (Cameron Diaz) presumably to have a little sexual fun.  And this just after spending a Platonic night with Sofia (Penelope Cruz), whom he is now supposed to be in love with.  Furthermore--and this may be just a minor point, but a telling one--Cruise's disfigurement was not as gross as was Noriega's.  One gets the sense that perhaps Cruise insisted on it being that way.From another angle, one might ask, is this deja vu all over again?  Recall that Cruise was married to Nichole Kidman when he played opposite her in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.  Guess what happened.  The public didn't like it.  Aside from the fact that they didn't understand it, what they didn't like was Tom Cruise.  He was NOT sympathetic.  One could not identify with his cruising various kinky sexual opportunities as a privileged married doctor.Having said all that, I still think that this film, directed by the very talented Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and wrote and directed Almost Famous (2000), is the better film.  Why?  Mainly because Crowe demonstrates a better understanding of the underlining theme of the film than did Amenabar.  (Of course he had the benefit of Amenabar's film to improve upon.)What I am getting at is the precarious nature of our brain's experience of reality.  On one level, I think that is what the film is really all about.  (On another level of course there is a love triangle.)  Throw the cryonics mumble jumble out the window and consider that we might, as some people believe, become software.  As partial products of our own culture we will (at least in the beginning) experience glitches that will destroy our dreams, just as David Aames's guilty conscience destroyed his lucid dream and made him see a projection of his fear and his guilt instead of seeing his beloved Sofia.If we do become software, there will be imperfect matches between our biological nature and the artificial neural nets we will fuse with.  We will not be freezing ourselves in the future.  Instead we will merge with our machines as we live and become part human and part artificial intelligence--something beyond human.  This is the glimpse of the future that Cameron Crowe extends to us, a possibility that he saw in the Spanish language film not fully worked out by Amenabar.Despite his miscasting, I think Tom Cruise gave a spirited performance, and I think only his celebrity and the compromised personality of the character he plays kept some movie goers from fully appreciating his work.Penelope Cruz is more playful here than she was in Open Your Eyes and her role here is somewhat larger.  Crowe makes sure she has ample time in front of the camera to mesmerize us, and she does.  At some point I realized that she reminded me a little of Audrey Hepburn.  Perhaps she has been watching some of Miss Hepburn's films.  (I would bet on it.)  Regardless, she, whom I first saw in Belle Epoque (1992) when she was eighteen, is utterly bewitching.Also giving an excellent performance is Cameron Diaz as the fatally scorned other woman.  She brings a sexy, haunting quality to the part that works well with Cruise's software ""experiences.""  She is not quite as convincing a stalker as was Najwa Nimri in the original, however, and this may be another reason that this film only gets 7.0 out of 10 stars from the voters at IMDb while Open Your Eyes gets 7.8.Usually I prefer the original to the remake, the European film to the Hollywood production, but in this case I think it is Vanilla Sky that will be remembered.  At any rate, look past Tom Cruise's celebrity and see this for Cameron Crowe whose vision of a virtually real future is intriguing and reveals that he did his homework.",5,Transcends the original,1046736000,"03 4, 2003",2003,4692,"['Here', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'thoughtful', 'reprise', 'Spanish', 'film', 'Open', 'Eyes', '1997', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'have', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'American', 'heart', 'throb', 'box', 'office', 'buffo', 'paired', 'current', 'true', 'love', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'very', 'talented', 'Penelope', 'Cruz.Guess', 'what', 'public', ""n't"", 'like', 'Even', 'more', 'finely', 'structured', 'comprehensible', 'film', 'Open', 'Eyes', ""'ll"", 'get', 'moment', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'NOT', 'sympathetic', 'least', 'end', 'film', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'then', 'perhaps', 'what', 'feel', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'mask', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'most', 'later', 'reels.I', 'think', 'problem', 'Cruise', 'miscast', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'who', 'played', 'same', 'part', 'film', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amenabar', 'Cruise', 'too', 'cute', 'too', 'privileged', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'almost', 'feel', 'character', 'coming', 'willingly', 'got', 'car', 'stalker', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'presumably', 'have', 'little', 'sexual', 'fun', 'just', 'spending', 'Platonic', 'night', 'Sofia', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'whom', 'now', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'Furthermore', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'minor', 'point', 'telling', 'one', 'Cruise', 'disfigurement', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'gross', 'was', 'Noriega', 'One', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'Cruise', 'insisted', 'being', 'way.From', 'angle', 'one', 'might', 'ask', 'deja', 'vu', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'Recall', 'Cruise', 'was', 'married', 'Nichole', 'Kidman', 'when', 'played', 'opposite', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Guess', 'what', 'happened', 'public', 'did', ""n't"", 'Aside', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'NOT', 'sympathetic', 'One', 'could', 'not', 'identify', 'cruising', 'various', 'kinky', 'sexual', 'opportunities', 'privileged', 'married', 'doctor.Having', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'film', 'directed', 'very', 'talented', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'wrote', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', '1982', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Almost', 'Famous', '2000', 'better', 'film', 'Why', 'Mainly', 'Crowe', 'better', 'understanding', 'underlining', 'theme', 'film', 'did', 'Amenabar', 'course', 'had', 'benefit', 'Amenabar', 'film', 'improve', 'upon', 'What', 'am', 'getting', 'precarious', 'nature', 'brain', 'experience', 'reality', 'one', 'level', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'level', 'course', 'love', 'triangle', 'Throw', 'cryonics', 'mumble', 'jumble', 'out', 'window', 'consider', 'might', 'people', 'believe', 'become', 'software', 'partial', 'products', 'own', 'culture', 'will', 'least', 'beginning', 'experience', 'glitches', 'will', 'destroy', 'dreams', 'just', 'David', 'Aames', 'guilty', 'conscience', 'destroyed', 'lucid', 'dream', 'made', 'see', 'projection', 'fear', 'guilt', 'instead', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'Sofia.If', 'do', 'software', 'will', 'be', 'imperfect', 'matches', 'biological', 'nature', 'artificial', 'neural', 'nets', 'will', 'fuse', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'freezing', 'future', 'Instead', 'will', 'merge', 'machines', 'live', 'become', 'part', 'human', 'part', 'artificial', 'intelligence', 'something', 'human', 'glimpse', 'future', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'possibility', 'saw', 'Spanish', 'language', 'film', 'not', 'fully', 'worked', 'out', 'Amenabar.Despite', 'miscasting', 'think', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'gave', 'spirited', 'performance', 'think', 'only', 'celebrity', 'compromised', 'personality', 'character', 'kept', 'movie', 'goers', 'fully', 'appreciating', 'work.Penelope', 'Cruz', 'more', 'playful', 'here', 'was', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'role', 'here', 'somewhat', 'larger', 'Crowe', 'sure', 'ample', 'time', 'front', 'camera', 'mesmerize', 'point', 'realized', 'reminded', 'little', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Perhaps', 'been', 'watching', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'films', 'would', 'bet', 'Regardless', 'whom', 'first', 'saw', 'Belle', 'Epoque', '1992', 'when', 'was', 'eighteen', 'utterly', 'bewitching.Also', 'giving', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'fatally', 'scorned', 'other', 'woman', 'sexy', 'haunting', 'quality', 'part', 'well', 'Cruise', 'software', 'experiences', 'not', 'quite', 'convincing', 'stalker', 'was', 'Najwa', 'Nimri', 'original', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'film', 'only', '7.0', '10', 'stars', 'voters', 'IMDb', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', '7.8.Usually', 'prefer', 'original', 'remake', 'European', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'case', 'think', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'rate', 'look', 'past', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'celebrity', 'see', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'vision', 'virtually', 'real', 'future', 'intriguing', 'reveals', 'did', 'homework']",Vanilla Sky VHS

Many people have tried to explain this film though their reviews, and almost everyone understands it in a different way, so I will not add my own description. Let me just say that it is, among other things, a sad, scary, hopeful story of one man's understanding of his life.Tom Cruise displays the same manic energy he has in most of his other films, most notably 'Jerry Maguire' (another Crowe film), and 'A Few Good Men'(The ""galactically stupid"" speech). There are times when I really hated David Ames, but that was probably the point. :)Cameron Diaz is very good, her beauty and vivaciousness superbly twisted into something frightening. Jason Lee, Penelope Cruz and Kurt Russell are a welcome relief when David Ames starts to get a bit wierd, hiding his damaged psyche behind his mask. Kurt Russell is wonderful as the psychologist looking for truth, especially when he finds it.If I had to explain this to someone, I would say this; imagine if a beautiful David Lynch film had characters you actually liked, and (almost) everything was explained at the end.Go see this film on it's own terms.

589123,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005JKMY,D. Mok,"[12, 23]","After his career-high achievement Almost Famous, it boggles the mind how Cameron Crowe managed to plunge into the abyss that is Vanilla Sky.Without a shred of coherence or a single believable major performance in sight, Vanilla Sky is a vain, pretentious, schizophrenic descent into narrative chaos.  Tom Cruise's lead performance is bereft even of his usual boyish charisma; Penelope Cruz discards her dramatic ability (shown mostly in her Spanish films); and Cameron Diaz looks and acts miserably, possibly sensing a bad career move.The plot makes no sense and the middle drags horrendously; there comes a point where the &quot;story&quot; -- whatever there is of it -- stops completely and we're stuck with Tom Cruise struggling to convey psychological horror.  But unlike, say, Dario Argento or David Fincher, Cameron Crowe is not a visually based filmmaker.  His calling card is his usually sharp writing, and Vanilla Sky abandons that for a vague series of visuals without any guiding force.  There is never any sense of danger, mystique or malaise in the film, just endless scenes of characters brooding and self-pitying -- hardly the stuff of good movies.The only redeeming factor is the gorgeous photography, courtesy of Oscar-nominated cinematographer John Toll (Almost Famous, The Thin Red Line).  It's a pity Crowe doesn't come up with anything emotionally or intellectually worthy of the imagery, so it all remains lovely eye candy that provides only blank calories.  Oh, and underrated actress Alicia Witt (Fun) makes a cameo, if that matters at all.  When not even the magnificent Tilda Swinton can save your film, you're really in trouble.A baffling fumble from a usually reliable, sensible writer and director.",1,Crowe's first complete misfire.,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,1727,"['career-high', 'achievement', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'mind', 'how', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'managed', 'plunge', 'abyss', 'Vanilla', 'Sky.Without', 'shred', 'coherence', 'single', 'believable', 'major', 'performance', 'sight', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'vain', 'pretentious', 'schizophrenic', 'descent', 'narrative', 'chaos', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'lead', 'performance', 'bereft', 'even', 'usual', 'boyish', 'charisma', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'dramatic', 'ability', 'shown', 'mostly', 'Spanish', 'films', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'miserably', 'possibly', 'sensing', 'bad', 'career', 'move.The', 'plot', 'sense', 'middle', 'horrendously', 'point', 'where', 'quot', 'story', 'quot', 'completely', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'struggling', 'convey', 'psychological', 'horror', 'say', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'David', 'Fincher', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'not', 'visually', 'based', 'filmmaker', 'calling', 'card', 'usually', 'sharp', 'writing', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'abandons', 'vague', 'series', 'visuals', 'guiding', 'force', 'never', 'sense', 'danger', 'mystique', 'malaise', 'film', 'just', 'endless', 'scenes', 'characters', 'brooding', 'self-pitying', 'hardly', 'stuff', 'good', 'movies.The', 'only', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'courtesy', 'Oscar-nominated', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'Toll', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Thin', 'Red', 'Line', 'pity', 'Crowe', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'emotionally', 'intellectually', 'worthy', 'imagery', 'lovely', 'eye', 'candy', 'only', 'blank', 'calories', 'Oh', 'underrated', 'actress', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Fun', 'cameo', 'matters', 'When', 'not', 'even', 'magnificent', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'can', 'save', 'film', ""'re"", 'really', 'trouble.A', 'baffling', 'fumble', 'usually', 'reliable', 'sensible', 'writer', 'director']",Vanilla Sky VHS

I simply loved every twist and turn of this film.This film, I believe, marks a departure for Cameron Crowe's film making. You will quickly see that this film is not as focused on the MTV generation, generation X or music in general. So the story goes, he became infatuated with the whole concept of Abre Los Ojos (the original Spanish film)that he felt as though he must try it himself. Cruise is the lead and I realized it in this film that he really is an odd actor.  His acting seems so very fake and over-the-top, yet at the same time, poignantly real. I do like him for this. Cruz and Diaz are wonderful. Cruz we knew she was this kind of an actor, but Diaz surprised me with a different performance than her usual.All in all, Vanilla Sky is visually stimulating; the mannerisms of the characters in the film are so natural and pleasing to the eyes, the dreamscapes are delectable and the end is beautiful.

For the Amazon reviewer to fault this film for implying that &quot;youth and beauty = happiness&quot;---that is like saying King Lear is about good parenting.The whole point of this movie, of which the &quot;Life Extension&quot; device is just a metaphor, is that most people actually live their lives like the Tom Cruise character after his accident: actually in an artificially preserved state of &quot;life,&quot; they struggle against their unconscious (which is full of guilt and repression) and try to make a beautiful sunny sunny happy happy MTV kitsch-fest video of their lives---which they are doomed to fail in as their resistance only creates more and more suffering, wastes more and more time and energy.Even before his life-changing accident, Tom Cruise's character was already on this delusional path---as an exceptionally fortunate billionaire heir who is both rich and handsome and has just about what any man could wish for, there is a scene where he tells his buddy that he's &quot;living the dream.&quot; He is too shallow to even appreciate his own blessings, too self-absorbed to care about others. When he becomes disfigured, he clings to his illusions---mainly, his youth and physical beauty, which form the core of his narcissistic identity and priorities---which of course time and change (the only constant in life) have suddenly and inextricably stripped away, becoming bitter, self-pitying, and despondent. Like many of us, he makes the mistake of identifying with the illusion, pretending that he will live forever and always have what he has---there is no real gratitude towards or appreciation of life.You won't get all of that the first time around; I'd recommend a second or third viewing too.If all the above just goes above your head, watch the film for Penelope Cruz---she is absolutely irresistible, this small but unspeakably gorgeous woman could charm the Devil himself!

Norris,"[164, 179]","As you can see from the customer reviews bouncing between loving and hating this movie, it is not for everyone.The first time I saw this movie in the theater I was unable to move when it was over.  I was utterly stunned.  I can count on one hand the times this has happened to me over a lifetime of movie viewing.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a rich young man who has inherited a publishing empire from his late father.  Cameron Diaz is the girlfriend he really doesn't care about, and Jason Lee plays his best (and perhaps only) friend.  Aames is utterly disconnected from his own life, and seems to care little about anything.  One night his friend (Lee) brings an intriguing dancer (Penelope Cruz) to his birthday party.  Cruise takes up with Cruz, but then experiences a waking nightmare that destroys his life.  I can't reveal more of the plot without giving it away, and I suggest you NOT read any more reviews of this film and just see it--otherwise you'll deprive yourself of one incredible movie ride.This movie is visually spectacular.  There are scenes that set off the dive klaxon deep within my brain but I couldn't figure out why until much later in the film when the plot is revealed.  What is this film?  Science fiction?  Yes, but...  A psychological thriller?  Yes, but...  A love story?  Yes, ultimately.It's better not to categorize Vanilla Sky, and just enjoy (or not enjoy) it.  I think this movie either works on you, or it doesn't.  And this is probably the most polarizing movie I have ever seen.  You'll either love it or hate it.Jason Lee and Cameron Diaz give the performances of their careers.  I would have said the same of Cruise, but then he uncorked Collateral.  Kurt Russell has a relatively small part as Cruise's psychologist, but he nails it perfectly.Vanilla Sky is based on Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes).  I liked Vanilla Sky a lot more than Abre Los Ojos, unlike most American remakes of foreign films, because it contains additional scenes and more spectacular visuals.  However, an English-only speaker like me can't really make a fair comparision because there are so many subtitles to watch in Abre Los Ojos it makes it hard to watch the actors.  Penelope Cruz plays the same role in both films.The real value of this film is that it makes you think about what (and more importantly, who) is at the core of your own life, and how will you feel about how you have lived when the clock runs out?Vanilla Sky is a rare movie--unique in plot, and made with passion and care.

Darling ""naive cynic""","[0, 1]","I was intrigued by the previews for this film, but was afraid it would be similar to the whole ""Eyes Wide Shut"" debacle - a pseudo-psychological ""thriller"" that didn't thrill in the slightest. I'm also not a huge Tom Cruise fan, although with his more recent films, he's winning me over with his talent. Thus, I went in with my skepticism turned to 11. Thankfully, I was very surprised - this is an entertaining film with unpredictable twists and turns, some of which are in the same style of ""Jacob's Ladder"" and Phillip K. Dick stories. Personally, I was kept guessing until the big reveal, which came as a total surprise to me; I truly hadn't expected that kind of element to this film - I won't say what sort of element I'm talking about, as that might ruin some of the surprise.The story revolves around David Aames (Tom Cruise,) a charismatic, rich, and witty executive living a charmed life, but only skimming over the surface, never plumbing the depths available to him. He quite unexpectedly meets the woman of his dreams, and from there, things begin a completely unpredictable course of events that rapidly spiral out of his control - or do they?

589145,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00005JKMY,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 8]","Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, ""Abre los ojos"" (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience.  Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  They will ponder the philosophical message regarding materialism, superficiality and emotional depth.However, for a great many the response will be, ""Huh?""  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.

Old girl, without giving any clear signs that she's nuts, flips out. Boy learns first hand the consequences of old girl scorned. And then someone threw out the whole boy/girl concept and got heavily bogged down in nonsense.That about sums up Vanilla Sky. Now, I know I was supposed to see a whole lot more in this film. I was also supposed to be fascinated by the plot twists and turns while I was simultaneously guessing my [rearend] off about what was REALLY happening. Maybe, if I hadn't been trying so hard to stay awake during this movie, I might have become engaged in staying with those twists and turns and guessing. Instead, I flat out didn't care because no one in this movie gave me any reason to even be slightly interested. By the time the guy showed up near the end to sort of explain this hodge podge of mush, I felt too tired by it all to care much why anyone did anything.Once again, the trailer for this movie promised far more than the film itself could deliver. The trailer hinted at a mystery and suspense. It did not suggest that the mystery would be why I bought a ticket to see this stuff, and the only suspense would be when the ending would finally show up. Because of the nature of this movie, it's difficult to say much about the actual plot without giving away too much for those who may enjoy it and don't want any of it spoiled for them. I have seen discussions on message boards among people who want to debate the points of what was real and what wasn't real in the storyline, so I do realize that others did get something from this movie I just didn't see or care about. For me, this was just another film with a gimmick that was done to showcase Tom Cruise and his perfect hair. That's not enough for me to recommend it to someone else or to try to find some redeeming quality in it to justify the time and money I wasted in the movie theater.

Vanilla Sky is a beautiful tale, a message so rarely received: ... well, I shouldn't tell my version, it's best told in the movie.I join the long line before me: I never was a fan or admirer of Tom Cruise. That all had changed with Magnolia. In Vanilla Sky, both him and Cruz act so credibly, they redefine and reset the standards of acting in a few minutes of the movie at the end and after that very night they spend together. Their expressions are so subtle, their sadness is so true that it's hard to believe it is ""just"" acting. Well... the love story part isn't as we know.Last note: This is a good case study comparing Open Your Eyes and Vanilla Sky. The latter is modern, easy to connect to and to be moved by, the original misses the point: the audience. E.g., showing someone angry doens't make the viewer angry, it makes them uncomfortable. What's wrong with contemporary European art?Trying to make a profit on a movie is not a sin.

While some may argue that there's only one true explanation, as I look back on the film I can see how it is very easy to come to the conclusion that it is one of any of those three or four explanations.Excellent performances by Cruise, Cruz and Cameron Diaz, along with great supporting performances by Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Enemy of the State, My Name is Earl) and Kurt Russell (Unlawful Entry, Fast & The Furious 7).This film got mixed reviews when it came out, yet has developed a cult following since.  I think it's the ambiguity that is found within this film that has encouraged the mixed reviews.  Some loved it, others despised it, and many others were just flat out confused.  As I said, it's not a popcorn film.  It's not a typical Tom Cruise movie that you don't really have to think about.  This is not a Jack Reacher or a Top Gun type movie.This is an intelligent and thought provoking work of art that demands multiple viewings to truly appreciate.If you give it your attention, and &#34;Open Your Eyes&#34;, then perhaps you will be rewarded with an enjoyable experience.One of my all time favorite films is finally coming out on Bluray, which makes me very happy.Sidenote, according to the official Cameron Crowe website &#34;The Uncool&#34;, they are planning on a brand new commentary track along with bonus deleted scenes that were cut from the film.  I imagine they are going to stuff this sucker full of extras, both from the other release on DVD and brand new ones strictly for this release.Can't wait!

He has the life we all want and then is turned upside down.

589157,AV3JZAYAP7GHC,B00005JKMY,halda,"[1, 6]","Try as I might, I cannot neglect the fact that Tom Cruise is a talented actor, and ""Vanilla Sky"" may be his best performance since ""Born on the 4th of July"". That said, the vehicle in which we see him practice his craft -- this film -- is like a Schwinn bicycle with a powerful speedboat motor fitted to it. The result: ""Vanilla Sky"" goes nowhere.It has it's moments: I loved the soundtrack and I appreciated that Crowe was trying his hardest to create his own ""Memento"". I'm also glad that I rented it first -- I certainly won't see it a second time. While listening to Crowe's so-so commentary, I understand that for him this was a huge artistic risk. I also get the feeling that, depite the sincere effort, even he deep down realizes that the film fails.The basic plot points are straightforward enough: the man who has everything overreaches and loses it all, only to finally understand that he never had anything in the first place. Except, maybe love, and we're not sure if that's what it was because it too was taken away before its time.To go into more detail wanders into spoilers territory -- suffice it to say the zinger at the end nearly destroyed this movie for me. What was an interesting psychological drama, buttressed by Cruise exceptional performance, fell apart into a very pap, kindler-gentler Twilight Zone ending. I place the blame squarely on Cameron Crowe -- after setting me up by delivering a huge emotional impact surrounding the main character's tragedy, he pimps it out with a bogus sci-fi wrap-up. I felt cheated and betrayed by it.The other element that came pretty close to wrecking ""Vanilla Sky"" was Penelope Cruz. I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt that she isn't well-trained to act in English, and that she really is an good actress, but her performance was so bloody lifeless I couldn't understand what Cruise's character was smitten over (besides her astonishing beauty).

With ""Vanilla Sky"", the beat was a little too off, even for me.Perhaps I am in the minority, but I view this film  as irritatingly disjointed, and purposely confusing.  You think you know what's going on, then, everything abruptly changes to show the viewer that they've been fooled time and time again.  After a while, there's no fathomable plot-line, and nothing worth attempting to decipher anyway.Are we supposed to find Tom Cruise's character, a sympathetic one?  A guy who's had everything handed to him, and is callously carefree and confident?  Cameron Diaz is the most entertaining character, and leaves too soon as she gives him his due, but then what on earth is happening after that?  Is what's happening even ON earth?

589163,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B00005JKMY,Hmph,"[2, 2]","Though Vanilla Sky opened up with so much potential, it tried to hard to seem clever, and ultimately turned out to be confusing and incoherent, and not in the good way. It follows Tom Cruise's character, David, as he meets the love of his life one night at a party. When he tries to end his open relationship with another woman the next day, she tries to end both her own life as well as his as revenge. David's life, as well as the story, was fine up until that point, but afterwards, it didn't make any sense, even when I rewinded and watched scenes again.I admit that I did like the pairing of Penelope Cruz and Tom Cruise--I certainly understood why Cameron Diaz's character was jealous--but that was one of the only redemptive qualities of this movie. After Cruise's character survives the accident, he becomes immature in facing his problems, and creates more problems unnecessarily. Scenes begin shifting more and more rapidly as the movie goes on, and I suppose they do that to make it seem clever, but they ultimately fail. The writers don't really take any aspect of the story in depth, and by the end, you find out a twist that ""might"" make sense, but certainly wasn't interesting enough to watch to its ending. Of course, you might still be confused by the ending, and I wouldn't blame you since many of us felt the same way.If you've seen your fair share of psychological thrillers, this one will most likely disappoint you. It would be better if you watched the Spanish version of this movie,Open Your Eyes, instead, or evenInception.

The film tries to show us that surviving after death at very low temperatures is extremely dangerous, not for our survival per se but because these business people who are going to propose us with such an adventure will have to occupy our sleep with dreams and these dreams may turn into nightmares, and like all dreams, these nightmares will go on feeding themselves on the psyche of the sleepers. Then coming back to life after a long period of hibernation is going to be slightly difficult because such dreams or nightmares will have erased any clear limit between reality and imagination, and what's more we will come back to quite a different world. Waking up or passing away will be a choice to be made while we are still asleep, hence within our dreams or nightmares. But if these dreams have turned sour how can we desire to go on with them, since we are going to be killed in a way or another in these nightmares, and we want to live, or how can we desire to get out of it since we don't even know it is nothing but a nightmare, hence a dream, not reality ? In other words this film seems to imply that we must not play with the present because we are thus manipulating our survival in a future that we definitely ignore now. This film tries to tell us that we have to assume the present and build whatever future can come out of it with the means we have at our disposal, particularly our psychological means to cope with the present that can be a real unescapable nightmare in a way. The end is of course quite unidentifiable : are we in the future or are we in the present ? Is the character going to wake up in an unknown future or is he going to wake up in the present ? Is he going to come out of a real nightmare in the present, or out of an artificial dream turned sour in the future ?

Now when I rented it I couldn't wait to pop it into my DVD player and watch it. About 10 minutes into the movie I was like, &quot;This is sssoooo dumb!&quot;. Then at about 20 mins into the film I was hooked! This film is fantastic. I have never seen a film by Cameron Crowe and I'm glad I did.Tom Cruise gives a great performance as David Ames. Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Jason Lee all also give fantastic performances. Cameron Crowe did a great job with putting the film together. This film is in the top 10 best films of the year. Its simply amazing. The DVD is also great. The picture quality is one of the best I have seen and the sound is unbeliveibly clear and crisp. I haven't watched the special features yet but they look really good.Vanilla Sky is about a young wealthy magazine owner(Cruise) whos life is going great. Cameron Diaz plays the woman who loves him beyond belief and follows him everywhere. When David Ames meets Sophia(Cruz) he falls for her and spends the night with her. When he leaves Diaz is there asks him if he wants to take a ride. He goes and everything is fine until she starts questioning him on why he spent the night with her. She starts speeding at 80 mph and flys off a bridge. Diaz killed herself but Ames lives but is horribly disfigured.Will Ames ever come back to normal???? Will he ever have a life??? I know the answers but I wont tell becuase you dont want to know the end before you see it. This film is fantastic.

589172,A2X5FCG9AUP9VP,B00005JKMY,jcphoenix,"[2, 3]","Based on the Spanish movie Abre Los Ojos aka Open Your Eyes, Vanilla Sky is different, but as equally compelling as the original.Vanilla Sky copies several scenes right out of the original movie. There are parts that are eerily similar, especially with Sofia being played by the same actress who played her originally, yet there are several different parts as well. Vanilla Sky is more lengthy, and goes into more detail with everything.The Times Square scene was brilliant, and even more fascinating than the one shot by Amenabar (the director of Open Your Eyes) in the original, partly because Times Square is something that exists closer to home, rather than something in far off Spain. Eerily shot, it features the entire Times Square in New York empty, with not a single person in sight, and is a brilliant setup to the rest of the movie.While Vanilla Sky has many similarities to the original, the most fascinating thing I found was that two things made experiencing Vanilla Sky totally different from experiencing Open Your Eyes for me. The first was the lighting. In the original, the lighting is very dark, and chilling, and the movie has a very dark thriller tone to it. But Vanilla Sky is shot with brilliantly bright colors that make the entire movie glow with a certain vibe and energy, and that exist to make the movie sometimes even more chilling in its own right. The second was the music. While the first featured a deep and amazing score by Amenabar, this second featured many pop culture references, and a more modern sound to it - something that Cameron Crowe is known for. These two factors make the two movies entirely different, but in both cases, they enhance the experience.The mystery tone itself is hard for me to judge, partly because seeing the original took out all the mystery in Vanilla Sky anyway. But even without having a sense of mystery for me to judge, it was still a stunningly original experience, and one which had me engrossed in the entire movie.It didn't hurt either that Cameron Diaz had what was one of the best performances of 2001. There is always a certain moment in a brilliant performance that defines the entire role, a certain scene in which I can only describe as a spark, a place where the actor/actress connects with the audience. Fionnula Flanagan had it when she regally gave the keys to Nicole Kidman in The Others, Kate Hudson had it when she was torn between crying and laughing in Almost Famous, Naomi Watts had it in her audition in Mulholland Dr, and now, Cameron Diaz had it when she laughed and looked into the camera with those almost maddening and insane eyes in Vanilla Sky. The rest of the cast was also stellar as always, though I would have liked to see more of Kurt Russell as the psychiatrist at the end of this movie.Many will interpret this film differently.

I rate his work in this movie as one of his best, this was probably one of his most difficult roles to play and I'm still thinking about his character.The rest of the actors, do marginally well. I love Jason Lee in Kevin Smith films, I think he has great potential, but it's sad to see him playing out the same character over and over again in every movie he does.Ms. Cruz doesn't do all so great. With this film Mr. Crowe is attempting to do something more in the relm of the late Stanly Kubrick. The movie finally breaks out of the his signature mold. At the end, everything builds up and you know something very strange has to happen to explain everything. The way this all plays out is a little dissapointing and I felt somewhat cheated... There just aren't enough clues in the movie to support the ending. Having said that, the plot isn't bad. It doesn't have any slow parts and you're always trying to figure out what's going to happen next.The DVD bonus material isn't worth much.

589177,A1MMKUAZAKL395,B00005JKMY,Jevron Mc Crory,"[0, 2]","Shrouded by the initial revelation that Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz were seeing each other at the time of the film's release, the matter of whether the film was any good or not became a moot point. It's a travesty then that such a blinding piece of work has more crept out under the radar (despite the A list names attached) rather than explode into public consciousness as it rightfully should have.Simply put, if there was ever a reason for the word 'unique' to be applied to a film, than Vanilla Sky is it. Reuniting Cameron Crowe (the most romantic director in Hollywood this side of Baz Lurhman) and Tom Cruise for the first time since Jerry Maguire, the two come together to forge a magical, hynoptic, elegant, polished film about redemption, hope, status and above all else, love. From the opening montage in an eerily vacant Times Square where the camera literally bombards you with image after image, the tone is set, representing David (Cruise) Aames' emotional and mental state as well as remaining a statement about advertising as a whole. It's scarily effective film making from a director not renowned for his use of avante guarde imagery. Tom Cruise himself has never been better than he is here, creating a character that is uncompromisingly self assured and yet frighteningly vulnerable at the same time, stirring feelings of confusion as to whether we are actually supposed to love such a successful and highflying character.The earth shattering event that quite figuratively destroys his life, brings him down from so high above the rest of us to bury him at a status that renders him emotionally distraught and Cruise portrays this with heart wrenching honesty and intensity. Sterling supporting roles are delivered by Kurt Russell, playing against type as the 'father figure' psychotherapist, Penelope Cruz, embodying the perfect antidote to Aames' overly comfortable and therefore boring lifestyle, and Jason Lee, who now finally is receiving the roles he was destined to play. It's a second crime that an actor as acomplished as Lee has not been offered roles as important as this sooner.As the film spins it's twisted tale, things take a decidely dark turn as, along with the audience, Aames' begins to suspect he may have lost the plot somewhere along the line. A masterful move on Crowe's part as the audience feels almost exactly as the 'hero' of the piece, thereby providing an 'emotional anchor' for the remaining events that play out. The beautifully orchestrated chaos of the last two hours is finally explained in a tour de force of editing and deft handedly paced flash back scenarios/montage, culminating in one of the emotionally resounding endings to a Hollywood blockbuster/drama seen in recent years.The final message in Vanilla Sky is one of pure hope that strikes a powerful chord with anyone that has felt, at some point in their life, they were not in control of the events that spiral around them. With Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe has fashioned a film that is timeless in it's sensitivity, first class in it's use of music to compliment, if not actually tell, the story itself (special praise must be handed to Crowe's wife and the film's composer Nancy Wilson for crafting such a haunting and mature score) and renders every other romantic Hollywood film cold and heartless.Open your eyes and experience the 'uniqueness' of Vanilla Sky and wonder why you waited so long to see it.",5,Opinions are expected.,1042243200,"01 11, 2003",2003,3424,"['Shrouded', 'initial', 'revelation', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'were', 'seeing', 'other', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'matter', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'became', 'moot', 'point', 'travesty', 'then', 'blinding', 'piece', 'work', 'more', 'crept', 'out', 'radar', 'A', 'list', 'names', 'attached', 'rather', 'explode', 'public', 'consciousness', 'rightfully', 'should', 'have.Simply', 'put', 'was', 'ever', 'reason', 'word', ""'unique"", 'be', 'applied', 'film', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Reuniting', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'most', 'romantic', 'director', 'Hollywood', 'side', 'Baz', 'Lurhman', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'first', 'time', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'two', 'come', 'together', 'forge', 'magical', 'hynoptic', 'elegant', 'polished', 'film', 'redemption', 'hope', 'status', 'else', 'love', 'opening', 'montage', 'eerily', 'vacant', 'Times', 'Square', 'where', 'camera', 'literally', 'bombards', 'image', 'image', 'tone', 'set', 'representing', 'David', 'Cruise', 'Aames', 'emotional', 'mental', 'state', 'as', 'well', 'remaining', 'statement', 'about', 'advertising', 'whole', 'scarily', 'effective', 'film', 'making', 'director', 'not', 'renowned', 'use', 'avante', 'guarde', 'imagery', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'creating', 'character', 'uncompromisingly', 'self', 'assured', 'yet', 'frighteningly', 'vulnerable', 'same', 'time', 'stirring', 'feelings', 'confusion', 'are', 'actually', 'supposed', 'love', 'successful', 'highflying', 'character.The', 'earth', 'shattering', 'event', 'quite', 'figuratively', 'destroys', 'life', 'down', 'so', 'high', 'rest', 'bury', 'status', 'emotionally', 'distraught', 'Cruise', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'honesty', 'intensity', 'Sterling', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'delivered', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'playing', 'type', ""'father"", 'figure', 'psychotherapist', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'embodying', 'perfect', 'antidote', 'Aames', 'overly', 'comfortable', 'therefore', 'boring', 'lifestyle', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'who', 'now', 'finally', 'receiving', 'roles', 'was', 'destined', 'play', 'second', 'crime', 'actor', 'as', 'acomplished', 'Lee', 'not', 'been', 'offered', 'roles', 'as', 'important', 'film', 'twisted', 'tale', 'things', 'take', 'decidely', 'dark', 'turn', 'audience', 'Aames', 'begins', 'suspect', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'plot', 'somewhere', 'line', 'masterful', 'move', 'Crowe', 'part', 'audience', 'almost', 'exactly', ""'hero"", 'piece', 'thereby', 'providing', ""'emotional"", 'anchor', 'remaining', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'chaos', 'last', 'two', 'hours', 'finally', 'explained', 'tour', 'force', 'editing', 'deft', 'handedly', 'paced', 'flash', 'back', 'scenarios/montage', 'culminating', 'one', 'emotionally', 'resounding', 'endings', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster/drama', 'seen', 'recent', 'years.The', 'final', 'message', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'one', 'pure', 'hope', 'powerful', 'chord', 'anyone', 'felt', 'point', 'life', 'were', 'not', 'control', 'events', 'spiral', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'fashioned', 'film', 'timeless', 'sensitivity', 'first', 'class', 'use', 'music', 'compliment', 'not', 'actually', 'tell', 'story', 'special', 'praise', 'must', 'be', 'handed', 'Crowe', 'wife', 'film', 'composer', 'Nancy', 'Wilson', 'crafting', 'haunting', 'mature', 'score', 'renders', 'other', 'romantic', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'cold', 'heartless.Open', 'eyes', 'experience', ""'uniqueness"", 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'wonder', 'why', 'waited', 'so', 'long', 'see']",Vanilla Sky VHS

Personal identity, and how can one know that that reality is in fact that or just a dream.  Descartes might be chuckling somewhere.  Combining this premise with the additional interesting field from the late eighties of lucid dreaming, with the always wonderful Jason Lee, made for an interesting and entertaining film for me.  Tom Cruise is a silver spoon playboy, gleefully slacking through life and Cameron Diaz.  Enter the slim, dark Penelope Cruz to contrast with slim, light Diaz to battle for Tom's affections.  Jason Lee, as Tom's erstwhile buddy gets some great monologues reminiscent of his characters in Kevin Smith's comedies.  A life altering car crash ensues and the movie begins its dizzying descent into the surreal and macabre.  What is real, what is a dream or lucid dream.

Ickes,"[2, 5]","Spoiler Alert: Skip this review if you don't want to know the ending.Cruise's rich, handsome and happily shallow character has bought himself a custom-made Heaven. This heaven comes complete with his favorite sky, a vanilla-colored sky patterned after his late mother's Monet painting. The catch is that he doesn't know he's dreaming and that his peculiar heaven will eventually turn hellish. In fact, after 150 years of dreaming of the bliss of finding and winning his dearest and most true love Sofia, he first suspects and then rages that it's not real at all, but a nightmare. Strands of Hindu mysticism are subtly woven through this film, hinting of something beautifully infinite and strange. The movie's soundtrack heightens the mood and mind-bending confusion of this film, and it may turn the screws to your mind at times, leaving you spinning and feeling off center. If you don't understand the bad and the good vibrations that flow through this film, then--to paraphrase Penelope Cruz's character--maybe you will in another lifetime, when you are a cat.In summary, I think this movie is worth watching more than once; so go ahead and get the DVD.

Juan La Princi""","[10, 19]","What a piece of pretentious garbage Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise have served up here!I loved &quot;Almost Famous,&quot; and have enjoyed many of Crowe's other films.  I'm not a big Cruise fan, but he's been good in some films, including &quot;Jerry McGuire.&quot; Notwithstanding, it wouldn't have been a shock if this movie was merely mediocre.  But it's way worse than that.  It's positively hideous.The movie wants you to care about the fate of a spoiled brat, whose struggle throughout the movie is his yearning desire to remain a spoiled brat, and not grow up. And although the storytelling is murky to say the least, it appears, at the end, that against all odds, he remains a spoiled brat.  You're supposed to be happy about this outcome, because in between being a spoiled brat at the beginning and a spoiled brat at the end, the character apparently suffers.  But he suffers in the most undignified, obnoxious way!  Cruise's character has friends and lovers, but you can't see why.  They aren't golddiggers, though in the real world, a guy like Cruise would only be surrounded by golddiggers and yes men.  These friends are presented as being people of depth, but the very fact that they fight so hard to remain his friends makes you question their sanity.  There is simply nothing to recommend this guy, nothing that would inspire loyalty in a normal person.My sense is that success has ruined Crowe.  He's lost touch with what his audience would find compelling, and has run out of things to say.  So instead you get a lot of psuedo-inventive filmmaking and non-linear storytelling, and a lot of retro-psychedelic party and nightclub scenes, and some third-rate X Files type paranoia, which may seem very interesting to a jaded, overpaid, overpraised media hypester, but mean nothing, nothing, nothing to the audience.

Vanilla Sky starts out as an interesting movie, depicting the spoiled life of a rich little playboy. Cameron Diaz probably does her best acting in this film, and it's a shame it has to be attached to such a piece of garbage.After Diaz's character runs her car off a bridge, it all goes downhill. We're thrown into a myriad of explanations of what's happened to Cruise's character, and we're never sure whether what's taking place is real or dreamed. The second half of this movie is so convoluted, and so pointless, it's sad. The movie started with a little promise, especially knowing we'd be treated to one-liners from co-starring Jason Lee. However, this becomes a train wreck of a movie, and great actors like Kurt Russell, Penelope Cruz and Lee are wasted. Instead, we're treated to a bizarre trip through the possibilities of what's become of Cruise's character's mind and body. Why the makers of this film thought people would be attracted to such a mess is beyond me. You'll be left with so many questions, and so many ""Why?""'s, it's not funny.

After viewing the film, I have to say that the film is somewhere in between. It is a great film, but it does have a serious amount of flaws.What is good about &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is that it is a brilliant;y crafted and hypnotic piece of filmmaking. Cameron Crowe has proved himself to be a director of great visual style. The film has many recurring motifs and literary allusions, which make it interesting on several different levels. The acting is good. Tom Cruise is genuinely convincing and creepy as a man gone over the edge, and Penelope Cruz is diverting as the woman of his dreams. Cameron Diaz plays the psychotic and wounded Julie to perfection. Indeed, her performance is a big reason to see the film. The romance between Cruise and Cruz is involving and their chemistry convincing.The labrynthine plot of &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is creative and diverting, but about halfway through, I had lost interest. Despite good direction and great acting, it becomes more and more difficult to care how it all ends. The ending, when it does come, explains everything...almost. My big problem with &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is that the explanation to all that has occurred is so ridiculous and unlikely. It is far too simplified and destroys all of the delicious ambiguity that the previous two hours have built up.&quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is a good film, but it is not a great one.

No matter how you view(ed) it, you need to watch this film more than one time.I read a well-known film critic's review of this film before I saw it the weekend it opened in theaters.  The gist of the review was; you have to see it twice to understand it.  I saw it once, enjoyed it thoroughly and left the theater thinking; well, I understood it the first time, that was pretty good.  I also knew it wanted to see it again, if for no other reason that to get a second look at the Times Square Scene, which I originally had believed was computerized.  Then I began to talk to other movie-goers, friends who saw it later, then after release to video, friends who bought the film.This is when the film became even more fun than before.  On viewing, the visuals were lush, the music rocked, the cast was beautiful, the morality tale of the danger of depending on your wealth and your looks, were all great assets.  But the discussions with friends and the reading of reviews; the hearing others tell you, ""I got it too..."", then relating an entirely different take on the film, what it meant, what it was, how it happened...that was just too much fun.So, I delayed getting the DVD for awhile so that I couldn't hear the commentary until I had read/heard dozens and dozens of 'meanings'.  Now, having watched the film again several times on my own DVD, I did indeed 'get it' the first time, but unlike so many of these other reviewers, I don't see that as a negative.  I liked figuring it out.  Hearing the commentary confirm that it was indeed 'a' possible version that the director had in his mind was interesting, as was so much more of his commentary and inside information about the film itself and the making of the movie.  The two featurettes were enjoyable as well.So, if there are movie lovers out there who haven't seen this film even once, or you have seen it only once...you need to see it...twice.

For a start, the initially intriguing premise transforms the concept of suspense into one of confusion and has enough holes in it to be one of Charo's dresses.

Crowe did an excellent job of giving us his interpretation and not just a duplicate. He incorporates his own themes of pop culture's influence on everyday life and twists a few other plot elements. I do not want to give any of the secrets away but all I can say is this movie does not turn out into what you expect it would if you judge it from the first 20 minutes or so.The problem is that the original plot is complicated enough and then with Crowe's extra elements, I thought it cluttered the story and that the dialogue was trying to be too poetic.

But what the producers and writers failed to overlook was the plethora of plot twists that confused more than half of its viewers. In all of my critiques of films, I have found this movie to truly be the hardest. Although the film was confusing, its plot was very thought through and one can tell that it took many intellectuals to bring forth such a complex storyline. One's realization at the conclusion of the film was intriguing, but in a way contradicting. Certain parts of the plot seemed to be twisted with others; which lets its viewers wait through the boredom of the untwisting plot which seemed to never come clear. The casting and soundtrack were all top notch, but this movie is definitely one would have to watch a few more times to incorporate it's plethora of twists. In my opinion, plot twists can truly make a film shine in glory, but Vanilla Sky's twists were disorganized and confused too many viewers. People were so confused at the end of the movie that they dismissed it as ""the worst and confusing movie I've ever seen"". The plot's goal was top-notch, but the twists and turns broke the movie's chance of survival off the hinge.Pros:1. Excellent Soundtrack2. Top-Notch Casting3.

First, it's ambitious and, in our culture, where very few do and almost everyone criticizes,  ambitious projects are always easy targets.  Second, it is based on a foreign film and Americans, frequently feeling culturally inferior, often like to say, ""Well, the original foreign version was better.""  Last, it stars Tom Cruise and, as you probably know, Tom Cruise plays the same character in every movie.  Imagine Maverick fifteen or twenty years later and you have our hero from Vanilla Sky.So it's easy to dismiss Cruise's performance.  However, the reality is that Tom Cruise is perfect for this role because that's who this guy is supposed to be....until tragedy strikes (enter the on-the-run Tom Cruise from ""The Firm"").  I won't go into plot details, but the strength of this film is in it's construction.  After one viewing, it may seem a bit haphazard - even a lot haphazard.  If you enjoy a film that refuses to lay everything out for you like your an idiot, in ""Friends"" - era America, you will appreciate this fact.  It keeps you guessing and it does ask some fairly weighty questions about life, consequences, ego, success and love - albeit these are asked like Paramount Pictures (home of The Brady's!) would ask, not the way Jung might.  But that is being picky.If you want to see a film made by real pro's (in terms of craft) that is not insultingly stupid, silly or just bad, and exercise your brain matter somewhat with some pretty radical plot twists and amateur philosophy thrown in for good measure, you could do much worse than ""Vanilla Sky"".  The biggest criticism I have is the absolutely tidy, don't-insinuate-spell-it-all-out-for-everyone ending, which runs counter to the rest of the film.A big plus is a mega-awesome soundtrack which includes Dylan, REM and Paul McCartney (but that is a given on any Crowe project).",4,Drop acid with Maverick!,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1877,"['Vanilla', 'Sky', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'First', 'ambitious', 'culture', 'where', 'very', 'few', 'do', 'almost', 'everyone', 'criticizes', 'ambitious', 'projects', 'are', 'always', 'easy', 'targets', 'Second', 'based', 'foreign', 'film', 'Americans', 'frequently', 'feeling', 'culturally', 'inferior', 'often', 'say', 'Well', 'original', 'foreign', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'Last', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'probably', 'know', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'Imagine', 'Maverick', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'hero', 'Vanilla', 'Sky.So', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'Cruise', 'performance', 'However', 'reality', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'perfect', 'role', 'who', 'guy', 'supposed', 'be', '.until', 'tragedy', 'strikes', 'enter', 'on-the-run', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Firm', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'details', 'strength', 'film', 'construction', 'one', 'viewing', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'haphazard', 'even', 'lot', 'haphazard', 'enjoy', 'film', 'lay', 'everything', 'out', 'idiot', 'Friends', 'era', 'America', 'will', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'guessing', 'ask', 'fairly', 'weighty', 'questions', 'life', 'consequences', 'ego', 'success', 'love', 'are', 'asked', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'home', 'Brady', 'would', 'ask', 'not', 'way', 'Jung', 'might', 'being', 'picky.If', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'made', 'real', 'pro', 'terms', 'craft', 'not', 'insultingly', 'stupid', 'silly', 'just', 'bad', 'exercise', 'brain', 'matter', 'somewhat', 'pretty', 'radical', 'plot', 'twists', 'amateur', 'philosophy', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'worse', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'biggest', 'criticism', 'have', 'absolutely', 'tidy', ""don't-insinuate-spell-it-all-out-for-everyone"", 'ending', 'counter', 'rest', 'film.A', 'big', 'plus', 'mega-awesome', 'soundtrack', 'Dylan', 'REM', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'given', 'Crowe', 'project']",Vanilla Sky VHS

The best performance in the film is surprisingly delivered by Cameron Diaz, who seems to be the only one who can play a character with any credible substance. Every other cast member seems to just overact their part to the extreme, especially Cruise and Cruz. In some parts the film even attempts to be humorous but the comic relief that surfaces fails considerably. A geek with a pocket protector and a Member's Only Jacket wouldn't even be able to find any of the humor in this film funny. This twisted plot fails so miserably when it finally unfolds in the last 15 minutes. Watching this movie will make you want to grab a Gillette razor and slice your vein. They should make contestants on Fear Factor watch this film, the first one that suffocates or falls asleep looses.However, The only good quality conveyed here is Cameron Crowe's beautiful cinematography.

Cruise plays a wealthy a charismatic business owner.  His &quot;friend&quot; played by Cameron Diaz, doesn't quite realize that he's not in love with her.  He meets Penelope Cruz's character and actually starts to fall in love with her.  Once Cameron Diaz's character figures this out, she flips and commits vehicular suicide with him in the car.I don't wish to spoil the film for those who've not seen it yet.

What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film.

The main character played by Tom Cruise is a selfish magazine owner born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

Penelope Cruz is a sweet, enthusiastic character who doesn't fall for his tricks, but falls in love with him and he falls for her. A stellar performance by Cameron Diaz as a woman used by the main character for sex, takes the ultimate revenge and scars him for life. What ensues after that is a twisted maze of continuously changing storylines, leaving the viewer completely confused at what's going on. Worst of all, you don't even care.

589230,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKMY,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","""Vanilla Sky"" is based on a Spanish thriller written and directed by Alejendro Amenabar. Tom Cruise bought the rights to remake the movie and brought on board his friend, esteemed director Cameron Crowe, who did ""Jerry McGuire"" with him.David [Cruise] seems to have it all. He's smart, good-looking and rich. He runs a publishing empire left to him by his father. His girlfriend, Julie [Cameron Diaz], is gorgeous and devoted. But his life is not nearly as secure as he thinks it is. His board of directors sees him as a spendthrift playboy and wants him out. His best friend, Brian [Jason Lee] is secretly filled with jealousy. When he falls for a Spanish dancer, Sofia [Cruz], Julie informs him that their relationship is not the casual fling he thinks it is. Full of rage and fury, she commits an act that destroys his privileged life.Or does she? Is anything in the movie what it appears to be? Could Julie and Sophia be the same woman? Does what Sophia do to David really scar him for life, or does he imagine it? There is a murder, or is there? Is the story taking place in the past, the present or the distant future? By the end of the movie, will the average viewer even care?Personally, I liked ""Vanilla Sky"" a great deal. I think it is one of the most underrated movies of 2001. Having already seen the Spanish version, I knew what to expect. The vast majority of the remake's audience didn't have this advantage. It is anything but commercial, although it has the big-name talent and large budget generally associated with mainstream entertainment.Ironically, the biggest problem with the movie may be Tom Cruise. He's a great star but not a great actor, in my opinion, because, whatever he is in, he is always Tom Cruise, the star - bigger than life, sure of himself, and always overplaying his part. That works well in vehicles properly tailored for him, like ""Mission Impossible"" or ""Jerry McGuire"". The role of David requires someone more subtle and softer - Brad Pitt or Edward Norton perhaps.Cameron Crowe again demonstrates his fine directorial talents. ""Vanilla Sky"" may not rank as one of his best works, but considering the complexity of the story, I think he did well.For people who like a little intellectual challenge in their movies or who love a puzzle, this is a good choice.

I've pretty much gone off Tom Cruise since the split with Nicole, and no longer particularly like him as an actor. This is the movie that effectively ruined the relationship between him and Nicole, although obviously, things were going wrong before then, and the chemistry between him & Penelope is obvious.The great thing about this movie? The plot twists & turns. I can't say too much, otherwise I'll give the entire film away. Normally, I hate movies that have to many twists and turns, and you have to concentrate to understand what's happening, but what this, I found each twist & turn all the more intriguing, and it leaves you wondering what exactly the hell is going on. Just when you think there's a resolution, things just take on another turn. This is about taking friendships for granted, relationships etc. The movie is extremely thought provoking, although some of it is instantly forgettable.Most of the actors did well, but Penelope didn't strike me as the best actress ever, she's pretty wooden, and seems to struggle with the language. Cameron Diaz plays the blonde bimbo once more. Jason Lee was a surprise for me, and although he wasn't in the film enough, and had the damn fully grown beard (somebody pass me a razor!) he was terrific as Tom's best friend in the movie. It's a lot more of a serious role for him, and a step away from his comedy roles in many of the Kevin Smith movies etc.You can pretty much guess the movie's told almost entirely in a series of flashbacks. There's your usual swearing (at least ol' Tommy-boy doesn't come out with ""friggin'"" like he did every two seconds in Rain Man). There's also a very rough looking sex scene. (""I'm so afraid of the power of this!"") On the positive side, though, there is also a powerful message in morality about the true depth and meaning of a sexual relationship. (""When you sleep with someone, your body makes a promise whether you do or not."") For once, I actually agree with Cameron Diaz.It's quite an entertaining movie, and whereas some people simply don't like it, it's always the case that I'll end up liking it.

589238,A2GZTI0EIOCQNZ,B00005JKMY,"M. Hind ""daria_m""","[1, 4]","I think the main problem with ""Vanilla Sky"" is that it is such a departure from director Cameron Crowe's previous films.  While past projects like Say Anything, Singles, and Almost Famous were quirky films about relationships,  this movie is mind-boggling and, at times, boring.Tom Cruise plays wealthy executive David, whose life is changed when he decides to romance lovely Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and ignore his possessive girlfriend Julie (Cameron Diaz).  Julie crashes her car with David in it, killing herself and disfiguring his face. While David struggles against his unsightly appearance and the possibility of murder charges, the plot slowly builds into a confusing blur between reality and fantasy, incorporating a strange kind of death technology.Throughout most of the movie, I was not entirely sure what was going on.  I didn't know who was alive or who was dead.  I DID know that I was not really interested in the story.  Some reviewers made an excellent point recently about the John Travolta film Basic:  they said it had SO many twists and turns that it lost its steam.  I believe the same thing could be said about Vanilla Sky.  It's really a shame too, because I think there was a powerful message about beauty and happiness that gets lost amidst the weirdness.These kind of suspense dramas don't seem to match with Cameron Crowe.  I expect this kind of film from someone like David Fincher or Christopher Nolan, but I prefer Crowe when he's writing and directing deep, humanist pictures about love and coming-of-age.  I guess I have to applaud him for taking a chance on something different, but the film itself could have been much better.The performances aren't bad, which saves the movie from being a total loss.  Penelope Cruz really stands out; she's the perfect charming woman to sweep Cruise's David off his feet.  (Coincidence??)  Mr. Cruise is average, flashing his winning smile just enough for us to believe he can emcompass what it's like to be a rich, good-looking publishing exec.  Let's just say playing a handsome man that women love to stalk is not a big departure from Cruise's actual persona.  Diaz lends enough craziness to be a prettier version of Glenn Close's famous Fatal Attraction psycho.  I don't feel that this is as big a breakout role for her as many critics thought.  (For that role, see Being John Malkovich.)  Finally, Jason Lee plays Brian, the underappreciated and underrated best friend of David.  He isn't allowed much opportunity to develop his character, which annoys me a bit.  I guess it's still taking Hollywood time to accept him in dramatic roles.Conclusion:  perhaps the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" should have been left alone.  Nine times out of ten, remakes just don't stack up to the originals.

I heard that it was confusing and that it messes with your head, and that's why I wanted to see it.  I like those kinds of movies.  I like a movie to keep my interest and keep me guessing until the very end.  &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is a powerful, stunning, beautiful, and clever film.A quick recap of the story; very quick because this is one of those movies you have to be careful how you explain it, or you might give it away.  This is the story of a man who has it all; great looks, a successful buisness, money, and most importantly, the women.  One night at a party he meets what he thinks is his true love.  But after a jealous woman sees the two interact, she decides to confront Cruise, and that's when everything comes crashing down into a horrible nightmare that seems neverending.The performances were awesome.  Tom Cruise did a really good job.  Possibly one of his best roles.  The script was very well written and thought out.  The movie was brilliantly directed as well.The best thing I liked about this movie was it kept my interest the entire time.  It keeps you thinking and guessing until the very end, very much like &quot;Memento.&quot;  I would love to compare this to another movie, but I'm afraid if I do that, it'll give this movie away.  So I will refrain from doing so.  After you see this, see if you can guess the movie.There are a bunch of special features on this DVD, but I haven't had a chance to check them all out yet.  The picture quality is breathtaking and the sound is incredible.I know a lot of people left the theatres or their rooms confused.  Many people did not get this movie.  Well, I thought that I wouldn't get it, but the last twenty or fifteen minutes of the movie explains everything and it all comes together.  You will be thinking about this movie well after it is over.It's not hype; it's fact.  This is an outstanding movie that really surprised me on so many different levels.  This is one I'm sure I will watch over and over again.  If you want a clever movie with a great story and plot, this is your movie.  &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is a beautiful movie that expands the mind in so many different ways.",5,Open Your Eyes,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2289,"['critics', 'audiences', 'were', 'right', 'not', 'hype', 'movie', 'AMAZING', 'was', 'very', 'anxious', 'see', 'movie', 'heard', 'was', 'confusing', 'head', 'why', 'wanted', 'see', 'like', 'kinds', 'movies', 'like', 'movie', 'keep', 'interest', 'keep', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'quot', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'quot', 'powerful', 'stunning', 'beautiful', 'clever', 'film.A', 'quick', 'recap', 'story', 'very', 'quick', 'one', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'how', 'explain', 'might', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'great', 'looks', 'successful', 'buisness', 'money', 'most', 'importantly', 'women', 'One', 'night', 'party', 'what', 'true', 'love', 'jealous', 'woman', 'two', 'interact', 'confront', 'Cruise', 'when', 'everything', 'crashing', 'down', 'horrible', 'nightmare', 'neverending.The', 'performances', 'were', 'awesome', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'Possibly', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'thought', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'well.The', 'best', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'kept', 'interest', 'entire', 'time', 'thinking', 'guessing', 'very', 'end', 'very', 'much', 'quot', 'Memento.', 'quot', 'would', 'love', 'compare', 'movie', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'do', ""'ll"", 'give', 'movie', 'away', 'will', 'refrain', 'doing', 'so', 'see', 'see', 'can', 'guess', 'movie.There', 'are', 'bunch', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'chance', 'check', 'out', 'yet', 'picture', 'quality', 'breathtaking', 'sound', 'incredible.I', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'left', 'theatres', 'rooms', 'confused', 'Many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'movie', 'Well', 'thought', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'last', 'twenty', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'everything', 'together', 'will', 'be', 'thinking', 'movie', 'well', 'not', 'hype', 'fact', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'really', 'surprised', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'want', 'clever', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'plot', 'movie', 'quot', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'quot', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'mind', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways']",Vanilla Sky VHS

Night Shamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" both from 1999, Christopher Nolan's ""Momento"" from 2000, and David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" released the following year (all of which don't surpass the reigning king of this genre when Terry Gilliam released his 1985 masterpiece ""Brazil"") - by no means fails in this respect since I found it both entertaining and intriguing for the most part, but is noticeably long and certainly may confuse the average '2hr-max-movie-goer'. Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz both stand out playing their respective, 'good gal/bad gal roles and Jason Lee is quite appealing as the best friend of our dashing lead Tom Cruise. Yet Cruise may be viewed as stretching this performance given the physical challenges that are demanded. I hesitate to reveal these challenges to those that have not seen the picture as they are indeed the focal point of the plot. Many good things like the witty Cameron Crowe retrospective soundtrack that is weaved into clever culture references and tributes which are indeed enjoyable and even necessary to solve the riddle presented in 'what's is going on?' scenario of the main character's pressing dilemma which may not be easy to access with a single viewing. But still the ride can be entertaining as Tom runs away and into trouble as he often does in quasi-action films that are laced with mystery and intrigue like Sydney Pollack's 1993 ""The Firm"", Brian De Palma's 1996 ""Mission Impossible"" and even the more cerebrally dark, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" from Stanley Kubrick. As noted by many educated critics as well as the tasteless tabloids Mr. Cruise may be biting off more than he can chew as he dives into the land of independent production. I applaud Tom for his efforts and are rooting for his success yet do believe that his choice for future roles should include a return to comedic territory as a deviation/diversion to selecting elaborate/complicated efforts which could be prove too risky and result in a poor reception at the box office.",2,The 'Vanila' Sky is the limit,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,2168,"['film', 'attempt', 'pattern', 'fantasy', 'vs.', 'reality', 'films', 'had', 'become', 'popular', 'turn', 'new', 'millennium', 'David', 'Fichner', 'Fight', 'Club', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '1999', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Momento', '2000', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'released', 'following', 'year', 'do', ""n't"", 'surpass', 'reigning', 'king', 'genre', 'when', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'released', '1985', 'masterpiece', 'Brazil', 'means', 'respect', 'found', 'entertaining', 'intriguing', 'most', 'part', 'noticeably', 'long', 'certainly', 'may', 'confuse', 'average', ""'2hr-max-movie-goer"", 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'stand', 'out', 'playing', 'respective', 'gal/bad', 'gal', 'roles', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'quite', 'appealing', 'best', 'friend', 'dashing', 'lead', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Cruise', 'may', 'be', 'viewed', 'stretching', 'performance', 'given', 'physical', 'challenges', 'are', 'demanded', 'hesitate', 'reveal', 'challenges', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'picture', 'are', 'indeed', 'focal', 'point', 'plot', 'Many', 'good', 'things', 'witty', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'retrospective', 'soundtrack', 'weaved', 'clever', 'culture', 'references', 'tributes', 'are', 'indeed', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'necessary', 'solve', 'riddle', 'presented', 'going', 'scenario', 'main', 'character', 'pressing', 'dilemma', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'access', 'single', 'viewing', 'still', 'ride', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Tom', 'away', 'trouble', 'often', 'quasi-action', 'films', 'are', 'laced', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'Sydney', 'Pollack', '1993', 'Firm', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', '1996', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'even', 'more', 'cerebrally', 'dark', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'noted', 'many', 'educated', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'tasteless', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'may', 'be', 'biting', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'land', 'independent', 'production', 'applaud', 'Tom', 'efforts', 'are', 'rooting', 'success', 'yet', 'do', 'believe', 'choice', 'future', 'roles', 'should', 'include', 'return', 'comedic', 'territory', 'deviation/diversion', 'selecting', 'elaborate/complicated', 'efforts', 'could', 'be', 'prove', 'too', 'risky', 'result', 'poor', 'reception', 'box', 'office']",Vanilla Sky VHS

Moore,"[0, 3]","There's a great performance in ""Vanilla Sky,"" but it's not by Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee or even His Most Imperial Majesty Emperor Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. It's by Kurt Russell, playing Cruise's psychiatrist. Unfortunately, you have to describe the plot in detail to say why Russell's performance is so effective, and that would take more space than I have here, not to mention that divulging the plot of ""Vanilla Sky"" to anyone who hasn't seen it should be punishable by guillotine. Let's just say that when Russell learns the secret of the plot, his air of gentle resignation is more moving than anything else in the picture. NONE of the critics mentioned Russell in their reviews--except to say he was in the movie--and those who post here are saying things like, ""EVEN Kurt Russell shines in this movie."" This is all too typical of Russell's career. He acted Cher off the screen in ""Silkwood,"" but guess who got the Oscar nomination?And ""Vanilla Sky"" itself? It has a number of dazzling set pieces, and it's certainly worth seeing, but it doesn't hold together in the end. Again, you would have to describe too much of the plot to say why it doesn't work; I would note, however, that it's kind of galling that Jason Lee's character is described at the end as a ""true friend"" to Tom Cruise's, when his actions throughout--even when you sort out actual vs. illusory actions--show him to be anything but. Cameron Crowe, that sanest and most humane of directors, has the technical prowess to bring off the special effects here, but the crazed, misanthropic tone of the movie plays him for a loss. Cruise also has some brilliant moments, but it becomes plain before the movie is half-over that ""Vanilla Sky"" is a Tom Cruise vanity production, with the other performers allowed to shine intermittently only by the sufferance of the star. That Russell comes across so strongly--in a very quiet performance, yet--is a great tribute to a much underrated actor. I would recommend ""Minority Report"" over ""Vanilla Sky.""

I was young, unexperienced in the area of love and relationships, but beyond all that, it didn't catch my attention. I thought the plot was slow and confusing (remember that movies like Eternal sunshine and Inception hadn't been made yet), and the acting, well, I never really liked Tom Cruise as an actor, he makes 1 one acceptable movie out of 5. I was dissapointed with Cameron's performance. I've loved her acting for years, I couldn't believe she signed for such a secondary role. I think Penelope Cruz will never ever learn how to speak English properly...c'mon after more than a decade and she stills speaks with the Spanish accent. She should take advice from Antonio Banderas, the only Spaniard who managed to speak English without the annoying Spanish accent. Some time later after watching this version, I saw the original: total copy from the beginning to the end but without the Hollywood budget jje. Did not like it either; and frankly I don't remember anything at all. I do believe Amenabar is a great director and he did great with ""The others"", which is part of my blu-ray collection now.Time jump to tonight. I was zapping through channels and found Vanilla Sky, I must have watched about 45 minutes, it had just begun. I stopped short time after the car crash scene. That dialogue I didn't quite understand 12 years ago, surprisingly now it's pretty clear. He deserved what she did to him. After suffering myself for three years with a guy pretty much like Tom in this movie; I just imagined myself doing the same to my ex, but without killing myself on the way. And I'm pretty sure lots of women have been in Julie's situation too. The rest of the movie is still completely forgettable.For the chemistry between Cruise and Cruz, well it doesn't exist.

589255,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,B00005JKMY,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 4]","After the unprecedented success of Almost Famous, director Cameron Crowe assembled a formidable cast.  Jerry Maguire (another Crowe movie) star Tom Cruise returned, as did Almost Famous star Billy Crudup, completing a line-up that consists of Penelope Cruz (who starred in the original Abras Los Ojos), Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell and even small turns by Tilda Swinton and Alicia Witt.  The story revolves around hot-shot billionaire David's (Cruise) romantic encounter with Sofia (Cruz), a person who he thinks he may have found true love with.  That is until his jealous sort-of-girlfriend Julie (Diaz) drives them both off a brdige, killing herself and disfiguring him horribly.  Or did she?  Flashing back and forwards between the present, with David trying to build his life up again with Sofia, to a present where David sits in prison with a latex mask over his face, accused of murder and talking to psychologist Kurt Russell, Vanilla Sky constantly confuses you as to what is going on.The cast is close to perfect, with the famed romance between Cruise and Cruz being particularly evident, something that clearly works to Crowe's advantage.  Cruise is clearly comfortable working with Crowe again and resultantly puts in one his best performances to date (but still not beating his turns in Born On The Fourth Of July and Magnolia).  However, whilst many have praised him for trying a brave role in that his good looks are marred by facial disfigurement are a little off the mark; it's not really that bad and he's not disfigured for a great deal of the movie.  Cruz has a willowy elegance to her that lends itself perfectly to the role and Diaz as always is a pure delight whenever she's on screen.  Russell and Crudup for the most part have thankless roles but do the best they can with them, rounding up a list of impressive performances.However, Crowe's film is decidedly over-ambitious and cannot satisfy on a number of levels.  Whilst it's true that the ending will make you see everything in a new perspective, this doesn't mean that you'll have had any more fun watching an ultimately cloying first date between the leads and a lot of flashy effects with David constantly waking from dreams, being told to open his eyes and being asked if he can tell the difference between dreams and reality.  If it wasn't for the fact that Crowe clearly thinks himself very clever for doing this and signposts a twist ending right from the very beginning maybe Vanilla Sky would be more entertaining at a basic level and also on a psychological level.  As it stands though this is a movie with a good resolution and great performances.Still, to say that a film's only flaw is the fact that it's got too many ambitions has got to be something to be applauded.  Not long ago a movie like Vanilla Sky wouldn't have been made with an all-star cast and the movie's marketting did it no favours by not delivering exactly the romance with a twist story that Cruise fans might have been expecting.  As it stands this is an intriguing piece of moviemaking that doesn't quite pull it off, but at least it shows a step forward in Hollywood if they're prepared to make adult movies such as this, along with recent pictures such as Insomnia, Lantana and The Others.  Given this, maybe Vanilla Sky shouldn't be condemned completely.",3,Entertaining but not as fulfilling as it would like to be,1046044800,"02 24, 2003",2003,3319,"['unprecedented', 'success', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'assembled', 'formidable', 'cast', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Crowe', 'movie', 'star', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'returned', 'did', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'star', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'completing', 'line-up', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'who', 'starred', 'original', 'Abras', 'Los', 'Ojos', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'even', 'small', 'turns', 'Tilda', 'Swinton', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'story', 'hot-shot', 'billionaire', 'David', 'Cruise', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'Sofia', 'Cruz', 'person', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'jealous', 'sort-of-girlfriend', 'Julie', 'Diaz', 'off', 'brdige', 'killing', 'disfiguring', 'horribly', 'did', 'Flashing', 'back', 'forwards', 'present', 'David', 'trying', 'build', 'life', 'up', 'again', 'Sofia', 'present', 'where', 'David', 'prison', 'latex', 'mask', 'face', 'accused', 'murder', 'talking', 'psychologist', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'constantly', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'cast', 'close', 'perfect', 'famed', 'romance', 'Cruise', 'Cruz', 'being', 'particularly', 'evident', 'something', 'clearly', 'Crowe', 'advantage', 'Cruise', 'clearly', 'comfortable', 'working', 'Crowe', 'again', 'resultantly', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'still', 'not', 'beating', 'turns', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Magnolia', 'However', 'whilst', 'many', 'have', 'praised', 'trying', 'brave', 'role', 'good', 'looks', 'are', 'marred', 'facial', 'disfigurement', 'are', 'little', 'off', 'mark', 'not', 'really', 'bad', 'not', 'disfigured', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'Cruz', 'willowy', 'elegance', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Diaz', 'always', 'pure', 'delight', 'whenever', 'screen', 'Russell', 'Crudup', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'thankless', 'roles', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'rounding', 'up', 'list', 'impressive', 'performances.However', 'Crowe', 'film', 'decidedly', 'over-ambitious', 'can', 'not', 'satisfy', 'number', 'levels', 'true', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'see', 'everything', 'new', 'perspective', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'have', 'had', 'more', 'fun', 'watching', 'ultimately', 'cloying', 'first', 'date', 'leads', 'lot', 'flashy', 'effects', 'David', 'constantly', 'waking', 'dreams', 'being', 'told', 'open', 'eyes', 'being', 'asked', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'dreams', 'reality', 'was', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Crowe', 'clearly', 'very', 'clever', 'doing', 'twist', 'ending', 'right', 'very', 'beginning', 'maybe', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'entertaining', 'basic', 'level', 'also', 'psychological', 'level', 'movie', 'good', 'resolution', 'great', 'performances.Still', 'say', 'film', 'only', 'flaw', 'fact', 'got', 'too', 'many', 'ambitions', 'got', 'be', 'something', 'be', 'applauded', 'Not', 'long', 'ago', 'movie', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'all-star', 'cast', 'movie', 'marketting', 'did', 'favours', 'not', 'delivering', 'exactly', 'romance', 'twist', 'story', 'Cruise', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'moviemaking', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'off', 'least', 'step', 'forward', 'Hollywood', ""'re"", 'prepared', 'make', 'adult', 'movies', 'such', 'recent', 'pictures', 'such', 'Insomnia', 'Lantana', 'Others', 'Given', 'maybe', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'condemned', 'completely']",Vanilla Sky VHS
589256,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JKMY,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[18, 32]","Before fans of this film savage me, can I just start off by saying that I so much wanted to love this movie. I am a Cameron Crowe fan, I like Cameron Diaz, loved Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire and looked forward to seeing Penelope Cruz in a decent role. The preview trailers were excellent, although misleading, and made me optimistically look forward to an excellent romantic thriller with a stellar leading cast; Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and the very sultry Penelope Cruz and on that basis this movie looked like a sure fire winner. Ultimately though this movie has a character crisis, unable to decide whether it's one thing or another (thriller or morality tale, science fiction or romance) it falls into the gulf between.I don't like to spoil the movies for those who haven't seen them before by revealing too many plot details but for what its worth the outline story, told in flashback, is as follows; Tom Cruise is David Aames a rich, handsome New Yorker, who has inherited a magazine empire from his father and has everything he wants: A great life, a great car, a beautiful occasional girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and a great art collection, including a Monet, from whence the films Vanilla Sky title comes. However at his glamorous birthday party, he falls for his best friend's girl, Sofia (the beautiful Penelope Cruz, reprising her role from Open Your Eyes). Unfortunately though, this excites the jealousy of David's latest conquest, Julie (Cameron Diaz), a would-be singer and bunny boiler, leading to the `not very stable' Julie driving off a bridge, with him in the passenger seat, permanently (?) disfiguring him. Doctors provide him with a prosthetic mask and then set about restoring his appearance and David learns the true meaning of love and the superficiality of good looks but something is rotten in the state of Denmark (okay maybe not Denmark but you get the point), as David's life starts to unravel with terrifying hallucinations, opening up a Chinese box of puzzles: He is arrested for murdering Julie/Sofia/Julie/Sofia (he's not quite sure which one) and his only ally is Kurt Russell as a very unlikely psychiatrist assigned to his case and given to making profound observations like: 'The subconscious is a powerful thing.' Wow, that's like...really...ahem...deep...don't you think?As previously mentioned, I am a fan of both actor and Director, particularly Crowe for Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire but I have also enjoyed the ex Mr Kidman in the likes of Rain Man too. The idea of the star and Director of Jerry Maguire re-uniting seemed irresistible but frankly it just doesn't work. One of the big deals of this movie is supposed to be that Tom Cruise gets his face mashed in a car accident leaving him hideously disfigured, sobbing in front of the mirror at the horror of his own appearance but the irony is that although disfigured it isn't very hideous. In fact for much of the movie every opportunity it seems is given to Mr Cruise to peel off his shirt and ripple his six pack (okay, I admit to being jealous on that point).  I can't claim the cultural and intellectual high ground in having not seen the original but by all apparent counts though Vanilla Sky is a glossier but inferior version of the 1997 Spanish movie Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) directed by Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar, who subsequently went onto stylishly direct the Nicole Kidman movie, The Others. An oddity however is that although Amen&aacute;bar and his co-writer, Mateo Gil, are credited, the credits also proudly proclaim that it is ""written for the screen and directed by Cameron Crowe"" as if the story had come from some obscure European source material (like a book or a cave painting).Another of the oddities of this movie is that you can't fault the cast, they all give decent performances, although Kurt Russell was undoubtedly miscast. Ultimately though, the movie falls down because it doesn't know what it is, plus you've seen it before and you've seen it done better. The plot twist doesn't work and is a disappointment and if you want to see a movie that twists and turns between nightmare, hallucination and reality go rent (or even better buy) Jacob's Ladder it would be money better spent. I'm also led to believe that as movie fables go John Frankenheimer's 1966 film, Seconds, in which a clandestine organisation provides youthful bodies for the ageing rich and arranges for them to fulfil their dreams with new lifestyles, is a much more rewarding watch. Vanilla Sky on the other hand is a major disappointment, not awful just disappointing...",2,Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes),1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,4577,"['fans', 'film', 'savage', 'can', 'just', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'am', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'fan', 'like', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'loved', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'decent', 'role', 'preview', 'trailers', 'were', 'excellent', 'misleading', 'made', 'optimistically', 'look', 'forward', 'excellent', 'romantic', 'thriller', 'stellar', 'leading', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'very', 'sultry', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'basis', 'movie', 'looked', 'sure', 'fire', 'winner', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'character', 'crisis', 'unable', 'decide', 'one', 'thing', 'thriller', 'morality', 'tale', 'science', 'fiction', 'romance', 'gulf', 'between.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoil', 'movies', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'revealing', 'too', 'many', 'plot', 'details', 'what', 'worth', 'outline', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'David', 'Aames', 'rich', 'handsome', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', 'inherited', 'magazine', 'empire', 'father', 'everything', 'great', 'life', 'great', 'car', 'beautiful', 'occasional', 'girlfriend', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'great', 'art', 'collection', 'including', 'Monet', 'whence', 'films', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'title', 'However', 'glamorous', 'birthday', 'party', 'best', 'friend', 'girl', 'Sofia', 'beautiful', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'reprising', 'role', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'Unfortunately', 'jealousy', 'David', 'latest', 'conquest', 'Julie', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'would-be', 'singer', 'bunny', 'boiler', 'leading', 'not', 'very', 'stable', 'Julie', 'driving', 'off', 'bridge', 'passenger', 'seat', 'permanently', 'disfiguring', 'Doctors', 'provide', 'prosthetic', 'mask', 'then', 'set', 'about', 'restoring', 'appearance', 'David', 'true', 'meaning', 'love', 'superficiality', 'good', 'looks', 'something', 'rotten', 'state', 'Denmark', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'Denmark', 'get', 'point', 'David', 'life', 'unravel', 'terrifying', 'hallucinations', 'opening', 'up', 'Chinese', 'box', 'puzzles', 'arrested', 'murdering', 'Julie/Sofia/Julie/Sofia', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'one', 'only', 'ally', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'very', 'unlikely', 'psychiatrist', 'assigned', 'case', 'given', 'making', 'profound', 'observations', 'subconscious', 'powerful', 'thing', 'Wow', 'really', 'ahem', 'deep', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'am', 'fan', 'actor', 'Director', 'particularly', 'Crowe', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'ex', 'Mr', 'Kidman', 'likes', 'Rain', 'Man', 'too', 'idea', 'star', 'Director', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 're-uniting', 'seemed', 'irresistible', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'One', 'big', 'deals', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'face', 'mashed', 'car', 'accident', 'leaving', 'hideously', 'disfigured', 'sobbing', 'front', 'mirror', 'horror', 'own', 'appearance', 'irony', 'disfigured', ""n't"", 'very', 'hideous', 'fact', 'much', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'given', 'Mr', 'Cruise', 'peel', 'off', 'shirt', 'ripple', 'six', 'pack', 'okay', 'admit', 'being', 'jealous', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'claim', 'cultural', 'intellectual', 'high', 'ground', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'original', 'apparent', 'counts', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'glossier', 'inferior', 'version', '1997', 'Spanish', 'movie', 'Abre', 'los', 'Ojos', 'Open', 'Your', 'Eyes', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'who', 'subsequently', 'went', 'stylishly', 'direct', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'movie', 'Others', 'oddity', 'however', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'co-writer', 'Mateo', 'Gil', 'are', 'credited', 'credits', 'also', 'proudly', 'written', 'screen', 'directed', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'story', 'had', 'come', 'obscure', 'European', 'source', 'material', 'book', 'cave', 'painting', '.Another', 'oddities', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'cast', 'give', 'decent', 'performances', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'miscast', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'down', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'better', 'plot', 'twist', ""n't"", 'work', 'disappointment', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'nightmare', 'hallucination', 'reality', 'go', 'rent', 'even', 'better', 'buy', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'would', 'be', 'money', 'better', 'spent', ""'m"", 'also', 'led', 'believe', 'movie', 'fables', 'go', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', '1966', 'film', 'Seconds', 'clandestine', 'organisation', 'youthful', 'bodies', 'ageing', 'rich', 'arranges', 'fulfil', 'dreams', 'new', 'lifestyles', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'other', 'hand', 'major', 'disappointment', 'not', 'awful', 'just', 'disappointing']",Vanilla Sky VHS

I love action blockbusters, but there needs to be other films where a director takes some bigger chances than just losing the studio money.  This film takes the artistic chances, but fails.  The first 30 minutes set up an interesting realm of possibilities, but then the rest of the movie is just bad.

Another friend of mine told me it's reminiscent of The Matrix and Dark City in terms of questioning reality, so I took in Vanilla Sky not knowing what to expect, and I was happily surprised at the results.  Tom Cruise plays a self-conceited, wealthy, handsome, playboy who has the world at his fingertips (he's really playing himself), but one day his world comes crashing down when he is left horribly scarred and disfigured in a car crash involving his suicidal ex-lover played devilishly by Cameron Diaz.  Eventually, his face is seemingly repaired by a miracle of new age plastic surgery, and he is reunited with his one true love played by Penelope Cruz.  But soon, things start falling apart even more so, and Cruise discovers that all is not what it seems, and there is a higher power in control.  Tom Cruise is rather good in this film, as is the other Cruz, both of whom give off great chemistry together, and Jason Lee (alumnus of many of Kevin Smith's films) is good as Cruise's best friend, but I thought that Kurt Russel was wasted in his role.  All in all though, the ending of the film may have been the biggest flaw, which is why some people absolutely hated the film, and while Vanilla Sky isn't perfect by any means, it is clearly worth a look.",4,A beautifully flawed masterpiece,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,1422,"['friend', 'mine', 'recommended', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'saying', 'so', 'mind-trippy', 'great', 'so', 'recommendation', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'reminiscent', 'Matrix', 'Dark', 'City', 'terms', 'questioning', 'reality', 'took', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'was', 'happily', 'surprised', 'results', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'self-conceited', 'wealthy', 'handsome', 'playboy', 'who', 'world', 'fingertips', 'really', 'playing', 'one', 'day', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'left', 'horribly', 'scarred', 'disfigured', 'car', 'crash', 'involving', 'suicidal', 'ex-lover', 'played', 'devilishly', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Eventually', 'face', 'seemingly', 'repaired', 'miracle', 'new', 'age', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'reunited', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'played', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'soon', 'things', 'start', 'falling', 'apart', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Cruise', 'discovers', 'not', 'what', 'higher', 'power', 'control', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'rather', 'good', 'film', 'other', 'Cruz', 'whom', 'give', 'off', 'great', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'alumnus', 'many', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'films', 'good', 'Cruise', 'best', 'friend', 'thought', 'Kurt', 'Russel', 'was', 'wasted', 'role', 'ending', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'why', 'people', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'film', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'clearly', 'worth', 'look']",Vanilla Sky VHS
589263,A3J32CP7XVRNS8,B00005JKMY,not telling,"[2, 3]","This movie is a remake of the Spanish 1997 film, Open Your Eyes, also starring Penelope Cruz. I'm really surpirsed by so many negative reviews on here. But, many people that I have talked to just ""didn't get it."" It is a complicated film. Not one that you can walk out of the room to get popcorn and take bathroom breaks while watching. You must pay attention or you will be confused. But, if you pay attention and watch for all the subtle clues and underlying subtext, you will see that it is truly a good film.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, the young, rich and powerful publishing tycoon who gets whatever he wants whenever he wants it. He has an empty, ""sex-only"" relationship with actress Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).He meets the woman of his dreams (Penelope Cruz) at his birthday party who also happens to be his best friends date. But in her, David believes that he just might have found what had been missing in his life for so long.Julie begins to feel used and pushed aside, and seduces him into her car after stalking him all night. Foolishly, he goes. And instead of the ""fun"" that she promised him, she takes them both over a bridge, killing herself and disfiguring David's face.What happens next beceomes more unbelievable with each scene. David's world spins out of control as his mind tries to put together the ever changing and foggy pieces to the cryptic puzzle that has become his life. The surprise ending, which is borderline impossible to predict, will amaze you - might even make you angry, as I have read in a few other reviews on here.But I loved it. I think that it is a very deep film.If you get a chance, you should watch it once and then watch it again with the director's commentary. Cameron Crowe the director, and his wife, Heart guitarist, Nancy Wilson talk over the scenes to explain a little bit more in depth what he was trying to portray - they also give away vital background clues that will have you rewinding and replaying quite a few times.This movie is great because a lot of it is left up to interpretation. Which is why I think so many people don't like it. Some people just don't like having to think for themselves.  But I think it's great. This movie means something different to everyone.The acting is great. I wish Cameron Diaz was in it longer - she plays an amazing psycho!! And I think it's one of Tom Cruise's best performances.

Things start to go weird after he is disfigured in a car accident, even imagining that his dead sex buddy (Cameron Diaz) is his current flame (Penelope Cruz).Halfway through the show, though a series of dreams alternating with reality, I wondered if I was going insane.

589273,A5NW620UKE9K,B00005JKMY,phoongdan,"[2, 2]","I first watched this film on DVD in May 2003 and was absolutely blown away by it. It was the only time I've ever gotten that cinematic buzz (albeit on DVD) from any movie and I still have yet to feel as strongly about any other film as I once felt about this film. After my first viewing I couldn't wait to watch it again a 2nd time the next evening after work. I thought about it all day at my office. I must have watched it 10 times in that first week. I was so excited about it I wrote a very long review and posted it on one of those free websites that were so prevalent on the Internet about 10 years ago (this is before Facebook, of course). And I had a full size Vanilla Sky movie poster in my apartment at the time. For several years it was hands down my favorite film.However, nearly 9 years later I feel differently about the film and I can understand other people's views that the movie is shallow and the story unreasonable at times. Though there are many people who will be confused about the plot and this is what ruins the movie for them, there are those that understand the movie and still don't like it and I think there are many valid criticisms of the film. Most notably Sofia's shallow ""love"" of David. When Sofia meets David in the club after the car accident, and even when she first sees him at her dance studio, it is obvious that she can't get over the fact that he ain't good looking anymore. But perhaps we ought to at least give her character credit that she doesn't stay with him for his money! But when you think of it, why shouldn't she be shallow? They spent one evening together, albeit an evening that had a lot of relationship promise, but one evening none the less. I think most of us have had something like this happen to us in our personal life. Not with a disfiguring car crash mind you, but a glimpse of a love that might have been that never happened for one reason or another. Isn't David's inability to not be able to get over this a little pathetic? In fact it is so pathetic that he decides upon it for his lucid dream.But even with valid criticisms of the plot, the movie is still a wonderful film that may just take you on an emotional journey and it is visually stunning at times. And even watching it earlier this evening for the first time in years I was surprised that the hairs on my arms stood up during the ""your not Sofia"" scene. Those of you that have seen it know what I'm talking about! Though I enjoyed re-watching it, I think how we view and feel about a film changes with time. A movie impacts us in part because of where WE are at in our life at the time of the viewing. 10 years later, things change, you change, and your view of the film changes.With my latest reviewing I really see how some viewers were disappointed with the film, in particular the ending. Learning that David has been in a lucid dream and is frozen for half of the film is OK, but the final scenes with David and the ""tech support"" guy and when David says goodbye to Sofia I now feel are pretty weak. And Penelope's acting just seems off to me in many parts of the film. Perhaps it was a cultural or language barrier issue.However, there are still some good revelations and insights at the films conclusion. David realizes ""I lost you when I got in that car."" And this is a valuable lesson for anyone to heed about how choices impact your life. And how sometimes life seems to test you to see what you will do.I'm very surprised that this film has not been offered on Blu Ray. Many of Cruise's films have been released on Blu Ray and many of them older than this film. I am curious how Cruise feels about this movie today. In the DVD commentary 10 years ago he certainly seemed proud of the film. I wonder how he views it in his career present day.Despite some reservations about the film this is a movie I recommend to friends who haven't seen it without hesitation. It's the first movie that comes out of my mouth. Because if you hate it, oh well. All you have lost is a DVD rental. But this film has the capacity to be truly special for some people depending upon where they are at in their life at the moment.If you haven't listened to the DVD commentary yet, you should.

Having been niether a fan of Tom Cruise or Penelope Cruz, i went into this film being more then a little skeptical. But i have always loved the work of Cameron Crow, and i have a great fondness for off-the-wall storytelling.The exact plot of this film is more then a little too complicated to try and explain here, and in fact there are several different interpretations one can have as to what this movie is about in the first place. In fact, i've run into many people who found it far too confusing to make sense of...but i guess in my own twisted way, i loved that about this film. it's not your average cookie-cutter Hollywood movie. it does make you think, and question what exactly it is you're seeing on the screen.Having stated earlier that i was never a fan of either Cruise or Cruz...i have to say that one of the main reasons this movie worked so well for me, was their performances. They both rendered these characters beautifully, and their on-screen chemistry comes across so well, that it makes the resulting storyline all the more tragic.Crowe definitely captures the dreamlike quality on screen that his script so beautifully conveys. and one of the main reasons i love the man's work so much...is his ability to inject humor into otherwise serious situations, which he does here wonderfully. My single complaint would have to be with Cameron Diaz. Her performance is so incredibly over-the-top and annoying, that there is no way to feel any kind of sympathy for her character, no matter how small the amount might have been.",5,Open Your Eyes,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,1647,"['one', 'movies', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'really', ""n't"", 'middle', 'ground', 'Having', 'been', 'niether', 'fan', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'i', 'went', 'film', 'being', 'more', 'then', 'little', 'skeptical', 'i', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'work', 'Cameron', 'Crow', 'i', 'have', 'great', 'fondness', 'off-the-wall', 'storytelling.The', 'exact', 'plot', 'film', 'more', 'then', 'little', 'too', 'complicated', 'try', 'explain', 'here', 'fact', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'interpretations', 'one', 'can', 'have', 'what', 'movie', 'first', 'place', 'fact', 'i', ""'ve"", 'run', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'confusing', 'make', 'sense', 'i', 'guess', 'own', 'twisted', 'way', 'i', 'loved', 'film', 'not', 'average', 'cookie-cutter', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'make', 'think', 'question', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'screen.Having', 'stated', 'earlier', 'i', 'was', 'never', 'fan', 'Cruise', 'Cruz', 'i', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'movie', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'performances', 'rendered', 'characters', 'beautifully', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'so', 'well', 'resulting', 'storyline', 'more', 'tragic.Crowe', 'definitely', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'screen', 'script', 'so', 'beautifully', 'conveys', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'i', 'love', 'man', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'ability', 'inject', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'serious', 'situations', 'here', 'wonderfully', 'single', 'complaint', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'performance', 'so', 'incredibly', 'over-the-top', 'annoying', 'way', 'feel', 'kind', 'sympathy', 'character', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'amount', 'might', 'have', 'been']",Vanilla Sky VHS

A movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting, it is that rare commodity: the movie we like to talk about later. Like Memento or Barton Fink, people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it's over.Also impressive is the fact that Tom Cruise, one of Hollywood's famed pretty boys, spends at least two-thirds of the film either hidden under a mask, or horribly disfigured. Not a role many other actors would jump to take.On the down side, Vanilla Sky, (a re-make ?) is basically an Art House or Indie film starring a big Hollywood actor. What could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man, or alternate/multiple realities, or even a study on the nature of reality itself, instead ends up like an art house rip-off of Total Recall.Rating: B- / C+FYI:1) When did the universe change so much that ""Banky"" from Chasing Amy could get a lead role playing opposite Tom Cruise?2) When did Penelope Cruz get the role of Indecipherable Speaker, ala Brad Pitt in Snatch or Fenster in The Usual Suspects?3) When did Paul McCartney last have a decent single?

Richard,"[24, 27]","""We're now on pause.""'Vanilla Sky' is one of my favorite movies of all time, for that reason I have discussed it with a number of people.  It is true that you will either cherish, despise, or totally not get this film.The film is complex both in content and presentation, thus many simply won't get it.People dislike 'Vanilla Sky' because, the original, 'Abre los Ojos,' is more artsy and less glamorous...and it is for that reason, I gather, that many people prefer the original film and strongly denounce 'Vanilla Sky.'  'Vanilla Sky' is, in my opinion, more graceful and not quite as raw as Amenabar's original.  Crowe made a great story and message digestible for American's, but in the process brought forth such a jarring and real message about so many aspects of life that I think people either don't want to or can't wrap their heads around it.This is no bastardization.  It is a cultural re-doing of a solid film; with excellent performances and great work by so many others behind the scenes, that ultimately comes off better than the original.  I love this movie because it is a truthful depiction of a man who torments himself...who chooses to bring crap on to himself...and fate cuts him no slack because he has been blessed in many earthly ways, very realistic and unlike your typical Hollywood junk (but of course it is not originally conceived in Hollywood).  So, he throws his blessings away on many an occasion by making foolishly impulsive decisions and generally refusing to take charge of his life.  On other occasions the viewer cringes as he unfruitfully grasps for what he tossed out before.The blunt realization is that all the little moments in life matter so very-very much.  That is life and 'Vanilla Sky' is a great allegory for some of the most important lessons: the sweet is never as sweet without the sour (hard work); there are no short cuts, no quick fixes; money can not repair the most important problems we are capable of bringing upon ourselves; and particularly if you are even slightly self-aware you must eventually chose to either: wake up (open your eyes) take control of your destiny and live a real life; or you will be engaging in a grand delusion, a dream.

589287,A2TBWLOHTZNK54,B00005JKMY,Reviewer,"[3, 5]","So I sat down to give Vanilla Sky a viewing, without reading much about it and just hoping it was even mildly interesting and thought-provoking. It turned out to be a well made movie, with some good performances, and decently thought-provoking as well!Tom plays a wealthy playboy heir with one of his big hobbies being to get laid all the time and then cast the women aside when he gets bored of them. One day he appears to have broken one heart too many and his life is changed forever. He ends up in an accident, disfigured, in excruciating pain. He thinks the board of directors is out to steal his inherited company. Him and his friend have fallen for the same woman and he thinks he'll lose her because of his problems now. And from there it's down the rabbit hole... some force in his mind is degenerating... his dreams become nightmares and he can't tell what sanity is. Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to coax it out of him and solve a crime.That's about as far as I can go without explaining the truth of the plot revealed at the end. Suffice to say, it's something out of left field. I thought Cruise, while being his usual androidal self that does a good job at least of pretending to be human, did a capable job and the rest of cast are even better. Even Cameron Diaz had an effective scene which is remarkable. Pen&eacute;lope Cruz does the best job though, lighting up a relationship triangle with her humor and naturalness.I'll have to see the original some time since it seems by a lot of consensus, Cruise took some rather crude liberties with the film.

I didn't really know what was going on either, but it was too compelling to take my eyes away. The catharsis at the end was worth the wait. Fine acting from all, especially Cruise and Jason Lee. Cameron Diaz was deservedly nominated for many awards (SAG, etc), and I take issue with Penelope Cruz' nom from the Razzies.

589294,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00005JKMY,Robert Badgley,"[4, 5]","The engrossing Dec/2001 film Vanilla Sky is quite the psychological mind bender and it never lets you get too comfortable.Just when you think you see through it all,it switches gears and leaves you scratching your head.I'm not a Tom Cruise fan per se',and while I do think his caliber of work has been spotty over the years,I do have to admit when he does something that is appealing and this is one of those times.Vanilla Sky is about one David Aames(Cruise) who is heir to a %51 share of his fathers publishing company in New York.He is quite the recalcitrant when it comes to the business end of things,much to the eternal chagrin of the board members he must grudgingly work with and who comprise the ones with the remaining %49 share/control;or the ""seven dwarfs"" as he refers to them.He is young and is enjoying life and has surrounded himself with quite the coterie of friends and hanger-ons.One of the latter is Julianna(Cameron Diaz)who,while a good sexual encounter,harbours deep resentment that David does not understand;yet.His friend Jason(Brian Shelby),a book writer whom he sponsors,introduces him to Sofia(Penelope Cruz) one evening at a party David has thrown and an instant connection is established between the two.A jealous and uninvited Julianna has shown up at the party and follows David when he takes Sophia home.They sit and talk into the evening hours and when David leaves,Julianna is there to greet him.She talks him into going for a ""drive"" but the drive soon turns into a terribly invective rant against David and how he treats her and others.Suicidal,Julianna ends up going through a bridge railing and down into the street below.She is killed while David barely survives.His face is left horribly disfigured and he has to undergo constant therapy for injuries to his left arm.It takes months of surgery mixed with depression but David finally returns to meet for the first time since the accident with Jason and Sofia at a rave up.When he does he is wearing a prosthetic mask and while trying to put on a brave front his language both verbal and body betray the inward anguish and resentment he really feels.He gets drunk and later accompanies Jason and Sofia home,who end up leaving him to fall asleep on the sidewalk below Sofia's apartment.He is awoken next day by Sofia whom he starts dating again and their relationship grows deep.David undergoes further extensive plastic surgery and finally gets his face restored to near normal.However strange things start to happen.Not only does he start seeing his old disfigured face off and on in mirrors he is also seeing Julianna as Sofia.Then to top this we find David is in an interrogation room in a jail,being questioned by a psychologist Dr McCabe(Kurt Russell).The doctor is trying to find the truth as to what really happened,while David is trying to grasp onto the reality of the moment.The movies events continue and we switch back and forth between them and the jail as the story is slowly revealed.David's mental state deteriorates rapidly and one night he wakes up in bed with Sofia at first,who then switches to Julianna.He ties her up and calls the police.HE is arrested for apparently beating Sofia(not Julianna) up;who will not press charges.The final straw comes when Sofia and David are in the midst of a passionate love making session and Sofia ""turns"" into Julianna.This time David in a frenzied state suffocates her with the pillow.Throughout all these seemingly mind boggling events there has been a man popping in and out of scenes.At first he has been in the background staring and later he actually talks to him in a bar.Now with Dr.McCabe and a jail guard in tow they arrive at a place called Life Extension.It seems the mystery man is from the tech support department(Noah Taylor) of the company.David had signed a contract with them to freeze his body and re-animate it years later.Well it is now 150 years later and it appears that David's dream state has gone awry(which tech support detected);which began the night after his sleeping on the sidewalk at Sofia's.Dr McCabe is an illusion as has been every event since then and now he must choose his next step;to continue to sleep or wake up,get reconstructive surgery and continue his life in the real world.At this point he is standing atop a skyscraper over looking New York city with a beautiful Vanilla Sky above(just like the Monet painting his mother so cherished).He has a fear of heights and walking with the doctor means continuing his dreams while jumping brings him back ""home"".He prefers the latter and the film ends as we see both his eyes open for the first time in 150 years.The plot is certainly an intricate one and I am afraid I cannot do justice to all the nuances built into the story;those you will just have to experience for yourself.But I hope I have given you enough of a taste to whet your appetite for more,for if you stick this movie through you will be amply rewarded in how all the loose and seemingly unrelated ends,come together in the end.Tom Cruise I must say turns in a marvelous performance as the rich playboy turned into a self loathing and tormented man after the crash that disfigures him.Top performances are turned in by all and I must single out Kurt Russell as the psychologist who is a solid addition to the proceedings.Technically speaking this movie has been transferred well into widescreen and the colours are sharp and crisp.The special features include Commentary,a featurette,a music video,a short interview with Paul McCartney who wrote the title number,the unreleased teaser trailer and the regular trailer.All in all this is a 135 minute gem,while not everyone's cup of tea,is certainly(to me)an intriguing and engrossing psychological film that keeps you guessing right down to the last few minutes.Highly recommended.",4,An engrossing mind

589295,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JKMY,Robert Moore,"[0, 1]","This film has engendered a great deal of hostile reaction, and I think that about 90% of that is a result of frustrated expectations. Given that the film was directed by Cameron Crowe, who had previous directed JERRY MCGUIRE and ALMOST FAMOUS, and starred Tom Cruise, who had previously been in JERRY MCGUIRE and the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films, I think many expected this film to run along those tracks. In other words, the presence of Tom Cruise (especially coupled with Cameron Crowe), created very specific expectations, expectations that were unquestionably violated. Now, Tom Cruise did a very good job in this film, but the fact it that because of the expectations surrounding him, he was probably miscast in this film. The film would probably have received a better reception with someone like John Cusack or Johnny Depp in the lead role, actors who have an established quirky side.I think the other reason that this film has received some negative reactions is the fact that it really, at its heart, is not a happy film. Things don't work out the way that any of the characters in the film would have liked. There is no fairy tale ending. Instead, there is an acknowledgement that life does contain tragedies.Although this is not a perfect film, it nonetheless is a stimulating, thought provoking fantasy. I loved the way that it continually challenged my sense of reality, and surprised my sensibilities. I loved the look of the film, and I find that many days after having seen it I have a host of extremely vivid images that I continually recall.So, I strongly recommend this film. But before seeing it, try to imagine that it doesn't star Tom Cruise. You'll have fewer expectations that way.  I also recommend looking into the original version of this film.

And while I was close to figuring out the actually story, I was slightly off, but that's ok because the actually story line was great.This is a movie about a young man (Tom Cruise) born wealthy who doesn't have a care in the world.  He's basically a playboy and uses women as he deems fit.  Cameron Diaz plays one of the women who falls in love with Cruise and when she see's that Cruise is falling for Penelope Cruz she goes a bit nuts.

So the the intial process of identifaction and developmet of connection is fraught with viewer anxst, that in itself is not a failing point, the film draws us in to examining the wrong doing of and towards a bunch of thoroughly dislikeable folk and question the morality of their behaviour and it's consequences.A fine intellectual premise, get that figured and the the viewing process becomes a test of social and moral values.The pace of the suspense building is perfectly pitched and the myriad of twist and turns in the plot are interesting and infuriatingly engaging. The final solution is for me the let down, fanciful nonsense which blows the entire story apart and renders the investment of your time to dissapointing cheated; at best.Diaz is excellent in her menancing and slighty unhinged role, Cruz provides a breath of fresh air in her beautiful and unincumbered character. Cruise is awkward, stumbling and ever so slightly out of his depth.

When the film is explained better (toward the end) and becomes a sci-fi movie is when we can appreciate all the 'muddled' elements (like the identity of his girlfriend changing every few minutes), it therefore pays to pay attention throughout the confusing parts and for this reason has the appeal of being very re-watchable.The film grapples with some sad realities, firstly it deals with Cruises's mind's inability to construct a satisfying reality for him, nothing he can dream up can compare to reality, yes even with reality's dissapointments and bruises and pain - the thrill of exploring the unknowns of reality and the way they change us and shape us is incomparably better to living in a contained fantasy. The second is the theme of apparently unrequited love, Cruise's self pity and lack of confidence costs him a real chance at true love - at the end we see how he narrowly missed out on Cruz (who was just waiting for him to make a move).The ending is....perfect, i must admit i was pleasantly shocked - it all makes sense, how Cruise swapped his vanilla sky for a Monet sky - at the very end as he is waking up he hears Cruz's voice, this possibly indicates that his escape to reality was probably another fantasy in itself, another trick by the designers to calm him down.

""The Sixth Sense"" worked because, once the audience found out the truth, they like the movie even *more*. They said to themselves ""I should have known!"" and they went back to see it a second time. I felt that way watching ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Fight Club.""But after seeing ""Vanilla Sky,"" I felt confused and ripped off. First of all, half of the movie could have been cut and the story wouldn't have changed a bit. Everything with Kurt Russell was pointless; remove it and you've got the same film. Second, the explanation of what's really going on doesn't answer any questions. It's an uninteresting explanation and it raises a lot more questions than it answers.There are other problems. The opening scene in Times Square is supposed to be amazing because it's empty. But I clearly saw a crowd held back by police barricades in the background. You'd think the director would digitally remove those people, since it ruins the whole point of the scene.The romance between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz has no chemistry. When they're naked in bed together and talking, he says he wants to be the mole on her breast. It's supposed to be cute or sexy or something, but it's actually a little creepy. Penelope Cruz looks like she's waiting for the director to say CUT so she can get out from under Tom Cruise.There are just two good things about this movie. (1) Cameron Diaz. She convincingly acts like she's crazy-in-love with Tom Cruise. Thanks to her performance, the scene in the car (which is the best moment in the film) is a shock.

With that in mind, don't expect to understand the plot to Sky from the first viewing. Give it some time and repeated viewing and once you understand exactly what happens, write a detailed review here on Amazon!The movie starts out normal with Cruise's character, a young, spoiled huge corporation inheritor and owner named David Aames waking up to his playboy get-what-I-want life. He wakes up the first time in a dream that reveals his fear of loneliness. Anybody with so much money and prestige cannot be alone, that's what we learn from the first ten minutes. David's life is also quite eccentric; he has a sex buddy, a singer named Julie Gianni played by Diaz but he takes her unseriously while he begins flirting and falling for the spanish companion of his best friend Brian, Jason Lee, Sofia played by Cruz. Gianni goes over the edge with David's carefree and neglectant behavior towards her true love for him, gives him a ride in her car and plunges to her death (or is it their death?)From this scene on, David finds himself stuck in one dream (or is it not) sequence to another. His fears of loneliness come true (or don't they?) as his face becomes deconstructed due to the near fatal crash, and he's on a drunken spree to try to bring back Sofia into his life while struggling to maintain his playboy-ish and prestigious image.The movie is nice to watch while Crowes' now brilliant script writing doesn't fail you with his charming dialogue, funny moments, and a string of classic rock tunes to the soundtrack, including the new song by Paul McCartney with the same title.The movie's special features include a shot by shot commentary by Cameron Crowe.

I went to this movie expecting the same but was pleasantly surprised. This was one of those movies I walked out of the theater going ""Man, I can't wait till this comes out on DVD"". Well here it is May 21st, 2002 and I now own one of the most overlooked movies of 2001. Gone is the sap that oozes in most Cameron Crowe movies, and in its place a great story that keeps you interested to the very end. Crowes main ingredient in this is the always good Tom Cruise. Add to that the very Jeckyl and Hyde performances of Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, and you've got a very intense, intelligent, and erotic movie. The Times Square scene is worth the price alone. I don't want to go too in depth into the movie because I don't want to give anything away, but it is definetly great movie making. The DVD package is just as good as I was hoping for. Included is a great commentary with Crowe, Nancy Wilson, and a special phone appearance by Mr. Cruise. Not one, but two featurettes, an interview with Paul McCartney, music video, photo gallery, and a couple of unreleased trailers. I am very happy with this movie and DVD presentation.

589319,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00005JKMY,Stephen A. Haines,"[14, 19]","This film stars Tom Cruise.Sadly, that statement condemns the watcher to over two hours of flat characterisation, empty purpose and hollow feelings.  Tom Cruise plays himself admirably.  He dare attempt no other role.  The casting deprives a powerful story of its fundamental strength.  The perceptive viewer will quickly realise that this plot is rich with promise, a covenant emptied of its worth by the inadequacy of its lead actor.  The story, opening with the hackneyed depiction of sex, money and power, soon enters a new realm of fantasy.  The issue of ""what is real?"", reduced to a trance state from overuse, is here granted a fine resurrection.  The surprise is its mechanism.The story of a ""poor little rich kid"" seems, initially, too weary to endure again.  Inheriting a publishing house, a New York apartment and a resentment toward his departed father, David Ames has no aims.  His sole relationship with the company is an ongoing battle with the Board of Directors for control.  The control isn't rooted in how the business is run - it seems to run itself.  It's a personality clash - with seven people collectively having less personality than Cruise.  How is that possible?  David has a stable of ready women, as any rich pretty boy should.  Notable among them is Julie - Cameron Diaz, whose sensuality is somehow actually enhanced in this film.  How is that possible?  David has another stable - his friends.  This one contains but one resident - a stereotype struggling writer doing a fictional autobiography.  Which is possible to the point of saturation.This scenario promises the ennui of a George Sanders film until David encounters Sofia.  Played by Penelope Cruz, Sofia vacillates between repelling David's advances and enticing him on.  The first encounter lasts the entire night.  David emerges from Sofia's apartment to be confronted by Julie.  The result of this encounter initiates the film's departure from stereotype.  Julie, challenging David's flighty notions of committment, leads them to an act of mutual destruction.  Or does it?  Something goes awry and David is being interviewed by a psychiatrist.  This interaction becomes the basis of the story as David struggles to detail the events of his life leading to horrible disfigurement, emotional conflicts over his women, his friend and his inheritance.  David may have murdered somebody, but the victim isn't identified and the circumstances defy definition.  The resolution shows why this film could have been a masterpiece.  Crowe's struggles to retain the power of the original story are Herculean, but simply undercut by Cruise's insistence on playing the lead.  I would have preferred George Sanders.There is evidence of Crowe's abilities in the other roles.  Cameron Diaz brings a fresh intensity to her depiction of the rejected suitor.  She's not just a gold-seeker - David is a real person to her [obviously surpassing our perception].  Penelope Cruz possesses all the grace and dignity you would expect of a ballerina.  She handles every scene with finesse.  The real standout here is Kurt Russell as the psychologist.  In their exchanges, Russell is drawn in by both David's personality and the bizarre condition he suffers - the wearing of a latex face mask to conceal his scars.  It's tempting to say Cruise is at his best behind a mask, but we'll forebear.

So it was no surprise this movie opened to not all glowing reviews and as many haters as lovers of the film. This was the most underrated movie of the year and deserved some award attention. Tom Cruise gives his best performance EVER! He was remarkable and I'm not even one of his biggest fans, but he proved himself as an actor with this truly challenging role. The other Cruz was so perfect and charming and a joy to watch. And then there is Diaz, all I can say is WOW! I love her, she is so mind-blowing and in this role proves she's not just the sweetheart funny comedy girl, she's so much more. She gives a completely frightening performance as the obsessive lover of Cruise's David. This film is about making you think and looking at your own life. The things you can't change, the moments you wish you had back. What is reality? What is dreamworld? This is one powerful film. Another one to add to the collect.

589321,A2ARRAMXWT83PT,B00005JKMY,Steven Adam Renkovish,"[0, 0]","This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me.

Some ambiguity would have been nice, something to discuss with others after seeing the film. The end scene was a bit dragged and could have been shorter. One last complaint, our main character is supposed to be learning a lesson through out this film. But by the end he really doesn't learn anything. If you see the movie you'll understand what I mean. The choice he makes at the end isn't soo hard as he is explained how life must continue for him. If he was faced with a more bleak future yet face it courageously we might feel more for this uptight sometimes charming always prideful rich white guy. Can't feel sorry for him, even when his face is deformed he still is good looking. Oh well. It's worth seeing once, not bad at all. Good directing work and a pretty good story.

589338,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00005JKMY,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[0, 1]","Director:  Cameron CroweCast:  Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swinton, Michael Shannon.Running Time:  136 minutesRated R for sexuality and strong language.""Almost Famous"" was Cameron Crowe's deeply felt ode to rock and roll, a personal journey that was one of the most highly acclaimed films of 2000. In keeping with the rock theme, ""Vanilla Sky"" could be considered Crowe's cover version of the Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 mind-bender ""Open Your Eyes."" Reteaming with his ""Jerry Maguire"" star Tom Cruise, Crowe has taken the lukewarm original vision and twisted it in to a thoroughly bizarre, yet unmercifully enthralling picture.  David Aames (Tom Cruise) is an unapologetic, filthy rich playboy who heads a publishing empire and enjoys life to the fullest. At his birthday party, David, through his best friend Brian (Jason Lee), meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). The two have instant chemistry, and David begins to have real feelings of love for her, something which angers Julie (Cameron Diaz), an old flame. Julie invites David into her car for a ride one afternoon, and promptly crashes it, killing her and disfiguring David. Dazed and confused, David must learn to live again with his disfigurement, and also confront his reality. A reality that is quickly spinning out of his control and heading toward dementia.Written and directed by Crowe, ""Vanilla Sky"" is about as extreme a left turn as a filmmaker can make these days and he creates an extending, hallucinogenic film that succeeds only because Crowe is taking such a leap of faith.  The higher aspirations for ""Vanilla Sky"" set Crowe's imagination afire. Taking on bigger topics such as the media-suffocating world and the true consequences of casual sex, Crowe's loftier ambitions with ""Vanilla Sky"" are miles away from his usual territory of optimism and love. It's a change that I wasn't comfortable with at first, but soon realized that this stretching of the artistic muscles seems to suit Crowe. A director with an incredible gift for visuals (the opening scene set in a completely abandoned Times Square is a knockout) and music placement (Crowe even includes a long forgotten Monkees tune ""The Porpoise Song"" in his kaleidoscope of a soundtrack), Crowe takes the audience on a journey of multiple realities this time out. A place where all might not be as it seems. Dangerous, even for a man who once asked Eddie Vedder to act, but the new direction opens Crowe up in an all new light. Though I would be disappointed if he completely dropped his heartfelt stories that shaped the foundation of his career, I can rest assured that he can hold his own with even the most peculiar of stories.Enlisting Tom Cruise into the fold is a stroke of genius, since the actor seems to be the most comfortable under Crowe's direction. ""Vanilla Sky"" asks a lot of Cruise. It forces him to act with heavy prosthetics for the first time in his career and the character also confronts the very golden boy image that Cruise spent the better part of the last decade trying to bury six feet under. Hyper, convincing, and brutally committed, Cruise takes the challenge of ""Vanilla Sky"" very seriously. He comes away with an enriching performance that rivals the best work of his career. It helps to have great backup as well from actors the likes of Lee, Cruz, Diaz, Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor and Timothy Spall. It may seem from the opening that this is a no-brainer role for Cruise. Just wait. As the narrative mire becomes deeper, the intensity of his performance grows with each passing minute.  While it is a remake (and a pretty straight one at that), ""Vanilla Sky"" does have many hurdles to cross that Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" didn't even need to consider. With a bigger star and a budget roughly 60 times larger, Crowe and Cruise have to be very careful to make sure the audience doesn't begin to lose interest in the jigsaw puzzle story. They clarify the plot more efficiently than Amenabar did, and they don't leave the public cold in the end as the original did. ""Open Your Eyes"" was a scrappier, less involving yarn, as it had less at stake, and that was the very reason I didn't respond to it. ""Vanilla Sky"" is more urgent with its drama, more interested in keeping the story moving and not relying on the third act twist which propels this tale from being merely a brain-tickler to a full out acid trip. ""Sky"" is not an easy film to like, and for a big-budget holiday picture, seems and often acts as uncommercial as they come. Yet under all the deranged images, all the nightmare narrative and all the unsightly Tom Cruise, there is a motion picture that does the unthinkable. It is actually quite better than the film it's remaking.  To see growth in talent and audacity in project selection from Crowe is certainly a treat, for ""Vanilla Sky"" is a solid entry from the director and promises some more changes of pace in the future. As long as he continues to have his heart buried somewhere beneath all the madness, we have nothing to worry about.",4,Vanilla Sky  (2001),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,5078,"['Director', 'Cameron',

Work is a secondary consideration for him and his board of trustees, `the Seven Dwarves', as he calls them, is not very happy about it. His occasional sex buddy, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), is young and beautiful, but is becoming too attached for his own comfort. At his birthday party, David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), a writer, brings a new friend, Sofia (Penelope Cruz). David begins to flirt with Sofia and falls in love. Julie notices this and soon becomes jealous.""Vanilla Sky"" is meant to be an `erotic thriller', yet I have difficulty labeling it that. There is virtually no sex and very little romance. Many of the scenes between David and Sofia (or Cruise Squared as I like to call them) involve them talking about nothing. But, you see, this is meant to mean they are talking about everything. In their post-coital bliss, they mutter sweet nothings to each other which sound like the worst poetry two love sick teenagers utter to one another. It becomes annoying fast.It is also difficult to care about David Aames. Young, brash and full of himself, he isn't a very likable person. This is fine at the beginning or end of a film, if the character has changed during the course of our viewing. But Aames doesn't really change. Throughout the course of the film, he becomes more desperate, but he doesn't really become a better or worse person.Technically, the film is fine. Crowe's films are always very well-made and he doesn't disappoint here. A very early scene shows Cruise walking through an empty Times Square. The shot is arresting and interesting and apparently they were able to shut down Times Square to get the shot. This is just one example of the technical skills employed by Crowe throughout his films.The film takes a very different turn during the last thirty minutes, by way of explaining all of the strange goings-on. The turn is alluded to very briefly in earlier scenes, but the explanation is so ludicrous that it would be laughable if the film were not so serious about it. I have talked before about believing in what a film is trying to sell you, but I wasn't able to buy into this. For this change in storyline to work, it needs to be more prevalent throughout the film. A few toss-away lines can not build up to the new ending.""Vanilla Sky"" is really an incomprehensibly bad film.

Visually, it is fun to watch--I wanted to find myself in the story.Tom Cruise plays David, a rich heir to a publishing conglomerate--one who lost his parents at an early age.  He coped by learning to play well.  We find him approaching his mid-thirties, and still playing at life.  He has lots of fun, but not much joy.  Cameron Diaz plays his girl friend.  She loves David, but understands his immaturity, and so pretends to also simply enjoy playing the game.

589349,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JKMY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[15, 19]","Based upon a foreign film that translates into English as OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS), VANILLA SKY gets its title from a Claude Monet painting, ""Seine at Argenteuil"" that the film's protagonist, David Aames (Tom Cruise) has upon a wall.  The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""Vanilla Sky"" because of the color that Monet used for the sky in the painting.  The misnomer of the painting's title is a key in understanding and appreciating the film because early on it becomes clear that this is a movie that likes to play with one's mind and the things that take place aren't necessarily real.VANILLA SKY revolves around the character of David Aames.  David is the son and heir of a international media tycoon.  Most everyone close to him, including his best friend Brain Shelby (Jason Lee) see David as a spoiled brat who has no appreciation whatsoever for all the gifts that have been given to him since birth.  He takes advantage of almost everyone he meets and lives in a fantasy world of wine, women, and song.  At the start of the film David is involved in a serious relationship with a beautiful blonde named Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).  They have been dating for sometime and are romantically linked, but David doesn't feel their relationship is as serious as Julie does.  Whereas Julie is waiting for David to commit and propose, David sees her as simply being a ""friend with benefits.""At his birthday party, David meets a woman that he finds so captivating and fascinating that he falls immediately in love with her.  The woman, Sophia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) is the opposite of everything that he found attractive in Julie.  David ends up walking her back to her place and spends the night talking with her.  To him, Sophia is the woman of his dreams.  She is the woman he would choose to marry.  Unfortunately for David, Julie doesn't take things very well.  She reminds him of some of the unavoidable truths about their relationship.  Julie and David are involved in a car crash and when he opens his eyes, he is living in a different world.His face has been reconstructed and at first things seem normal.  But then David starts having nightmares.  Soon the nightmares of his dreams seem to mix with his day to day life.  He finds himself unable to distinguish the difference.  Sophia is Julie and Julie is Sophia.  The world is too confusing and David longs to sleep so that he can return to his dreams.  Pleasant, pleasant dreams filled with the Sophia he met at the party and skies colored in vanilla.I really don't like Tom Cruise much.  He does have talent, but his large ego and cocky attitude take away from every picture I've ever seen him act in.  Therefore, I was reluctant to see VANILLA SKY.  I wish I would have watched the movie long ago.The movie is a strange romantic drama sci-fi picture that tackles some huge issues.  How do we live our lives?  Would you rather live your life in a comfortable existence filled with superficial happiness or would you rather live an exciting, though often painful life filled with wonder and awe, truth and beauty, but only occasional moments of happiness?  This is a decision that each one of us is actually presented with daily. We might not always recognize it as such, but it is and the way that choice is presented in the film makes VANILLA SKY such a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.Cruise's ego works well for most of the film, though it denies the audience from completely identifying and empathizing with the plight of David Aames.  Cruise is a great jerk, but not a very good reformed man.  However, his gift at playing spoiled id-driven men sucks the audience into the action of VANILLA SKY from the beginning and even though one is never convinced of David's reformation, Cruise's performance/presence keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz reminds me of a Spanish Audrey Hepburn and though she isn't in the movie a great deal, she shines in the moments that she is.  Cameron Diaz is a beauty and movie star, but overcomes her celebrity. She does a wonderful job of portraying Julie, an everywoman character that many women who have been stepped upon by men can relate to.  Julie isn't on screen very long either, but when she is she raises some important questions about love, relationships, and sex in American society.  Another important actor in the film is Jason Lee.  Lee portrays David's best friend Brian, who is busy writing a novel.  Brian is the catalyst for many of the film's deeper thought-provoking moments.  It is also Brian who just might hold the key to the real meaning of the film.  Like Cruise, sometimes having Lee in a picture is a turnoff, however in VANILLA SKY he is perfectly cast.VANILLA SKY isn't the easiest film to understand.  It isn't necessarily the most romantic film and though it's an intelligent movie, it asks more questions than it answers.  It also has an open ending, so people who have to have a movie end all tidy will have problems with the film's ending.  Nevertheless, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema that engages and entertains.  A person cannot watch it without and not have something to think about later.  That's something only really good movies can do.",5,Living Vs.

589351,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,B00005JKMY,Unlucky Frank,"[17, 23]","Watching this after viewing the convoluted mess, MULHOLLAND DR., was like a breath of fresh air. Here is a convoluted film with BIG IDEAS and an actual pay-off at the end. AND IT'S FUNNY!! Some [people] claim this movie made no sense and was full of holes. Huh? The whole thing is spelled out in it's conclusion. Cameron Crowe practically leads you by the hand. ... Having seen this PSYCHOLOGICAL MASTERPIECE 3 times so far, I couldn't find a single hole in it's superbly delineated plot.Not being a fan of Penelope Cruz or Cameron Diaz, I went into this film with low expectations. I was wrong. Cruise and Cruz have great chemistry together. Obviously because of their off- screen chemistry. And Cameron Diaz' performance is chilling. I have a newfound respect for her. Next to BORN ON THE FORTH OF JULY, this is Tom's best performance by far. He says, it's his favorite film to date. No kidding!! His performance is sad, hilarious, and profoundly touching. BRAVO!! Jason Lee is always great and he's a riot in this film. Hope to be seeing more of him, now that he's mainstream. Kurt Russell in a marvelously understated role.... Granted what at first appears to be a psychological thriller, which it is, ultimately becomes a science fiction odyssey of the mind. [For those] who couldn't understand why Tom Cruise gets in the car with Cameron Diaz: Diaz offers Cruise sex. This is the important choice that Cruise makes which ultimately changes his whole life and the direction or conflict of the story. And he doesn't ""punch her in the face"" because he's trying to talk her down. ... It's about the male libido. It's about thinking with one's head and not one's.....ahem. ""It's about choices"" is stated several times in the film. As for the identities changing during Cruise's nightmare nothing could be more obvious: his subconscious is playing out his tortured feelings of guilt about Cameron Diaz' character. ""The subconscious is a powerful thing"" is stated several times in the film. Psychology 101. Pretty simple stuff when you see it unfolding. ...  As for comparing this to MEMENTO: OK, a psychological thriller with an unusual timeline device. But MEMENTO had a fill-in-the-blank pay-off. What was the motivation behind it all? Why was this guy manipulating this other guy's mind? We'll never know. Doesn't really matter. These two films are pretty far apart in their intentions.This script could have come from the mind of Phillip K. Dick- sheer paranoia, except for the ending, which is full of redemption and hope. Stunningly put together and masterfully directed by Cameron Crowe. The music is wonderful. One expects the music in a film such as this to be haunting and weird, ala David Lynch, but the choice of tunes is a reflection of the main character's taste in music. GOOD VIBRATIONS?- man, that was out of left field.The DVD format is artfully done and the extras are good, although the MAKING OF segment, PRELUDE TO A DREAM, could have been more extensive. DO NOT watch PRELUDE TO A DREAM before watching the film. It gives away a part of the plot ... You do get a COMMENTARY by the film maker which I haven't clicked on yet.Not as psychologically disturbing as FIGHT CLUB, but close.Wow, I thought the meaning of this MASTERPIECE was fairly obvious, but after reading some of the other reviews, I guess I have to say, go into this one with an OPEN MIND.BRILLIANT!! Thanks, Cameron Crowe and Tom Cruise, for helping to restore my faith in Hollywood. This movie is one of the reason's why I love film.

589352,A1A9US805UWFPY,B00005JKMY,vgoth,"[0, 2]","I have watched this flick about five times, and have to say that with each viewing, I appreciate it more. Like Fincher's 'Fight Club', Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', Singh's 'The Cell' or any of David Lynch's films, it's hard to see it once and pass judgement.If you like any of the above flicks, this one is worth the time.This film is trippy, multi-dimensional, and sincerely requires at least three viewings to fully integrate all the little 'hints' that it brings.I knew, the first time I viewed it, that by opening with the haunting music of Radiohead's 'Everything In It's Right Place', after windy New York overhead cam shots, including the hauntingly dark Dakota building, where John Lennon lived for so long and where he died, that this movie was something to be reckoned with.Cameron Crowe's use of music in this film is superb, each little bit corresponds with the movement of the plot...for this I truly commend him. As far as plot, it takes, as I say again, a few viewings to really integrate all the characters, their motives and their actions, to really understand what this movie is trying to say. From Julie Gianni's cell phone ring ('life is but a dream') to Tom Cruise's character saying 'living the dream, baby, living the dream', to Jason Lee's character saying 'I'm drunk, and I'm from Ohio!', to Kurt Russell's character mentioning that he's from Ohio...there are so many subtle qualities to the writing that are missed on the first or second viewing...Tom Cruise, who I believe may be a very fine actor, but takes the 'easy way out' with more ordinary, general public pleasing roles, is really incredible in this, much as he was in 'Eyes Wide Shut'...when he takes the chance, he is truly riveting as the character he takes on...really believable in his pain, anger and anguish...all in all, a very mind-trippy experience and a true visionary filmmaking idea...kudos to you, all those who made this film, and all those who choose to watch it with an open mind...what will you say about your life to this day? is it life, or is it a dream?'living the dream, baby, living the dream'",5,Takes More Than One Viewing to Appreciate....,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,2096,"['have', 'watched', 'flick', 'five', 'times', 'have', 'say', 'viewing', 'appreciate', 'more', 'Fincher', ""'Fight"", 'Club', 'Hitchcock', ""'Vertigo"", 'Singh', ""'The"", 'Cell', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'hard', 'see', 'once', 'pass', 'judgement.If', 'above', 'flicks', 'one', 'time.This', 'film', 'trippy', 'multi-dimensional', 'sincerely', 'least', 'three', 'viewings', 'fully', 'integrate', 'little', ""'hints"", 'brings.I', 'knew', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'opening', 'haunting', 'music', 'Radiohead', ""'Everything"", 'Right', 'Place', 'windy', 'New', 'York', 'overhead', 'cam', 'shots', 'including', 'hauntingly', 'dark', 'Dakota', 'building', 'where', 'John', 'Lennon', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'where', 'died', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'use', 'music', 'film', 'superb', 'little', 'bit', 'corresponds', 'movement', 'plot', 'truly', 'commend', 'As', 'far', 'plot', 'say', 'again', 'few', 'viewings', 'really', 'integrate', 'characters', 'motives', 'actions', 'really', 'understand', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'say', 'Julie', 'Gianni', 'cell', 'phone', 'ring', ""'life"", 'dream', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'saying', ""'living"", 'dream', 'baby', 'living', 'dream', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'character', 'saying', ""'m"", 'drunk', ""'m"", 'Ohio', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'character', 'mentioning', 'Ohio', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'subtle', 'qualities', 'writing', 'are', 'missed', 'first', 'second', 'viewing', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', ""'easy"", 'way', 'more', 'ordinary', 'general', 'public', 'pleasing', 'roles', 'really', 'incredible', 'much', 'was', ""'Eyes"", 'Wide', 'Shut', 'when', 'chance', 'truly', 'riveting', 'character', 'really', 'believable', 'pain', 'anger', 'anguish', 'very', 'mind-trippy', 'experience', 'true', 'visionary', 'filmmaking', 'idea', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'who', 'choose', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'what', 'will', 'say', 'life', 'day', 'life', 'dream', ""'living"", 'dream', 'baby', 'living', 'dream']",Vanilla Sky VHS

For the people who said ""poorly developed plot, specifically between Cruise & Cruz,"" well, the answer for that is in the last few minutes! The movie is AWARE of that fact and also gives you the reason! This movie is not one for casual viewing: it demands that you pay attention to every scene, the dialogues as well as the on-screen visuals. You can't just take a 40-second run to the fridge while the movie is running...a masterfully told story, with great music and greater lines.SPOILER (SORT OF)David Aames isn't exactly the kind of guy Average Joe Six-Pack can associate with: he's rich, better looking than 99% of us, sleeps with women who are about 10 times hotter than the ones we sleep with, lives life king size and doesn't even work (sort of). But even this flamboyant-sexy-rich hunk ends up making that one mistake that we all have committed at least once when we were younger: concocting an imaginary fairytale romance with somebody we love (read fascinated/obsessed with) so strongly for reasons unknown that in our little imaginary world, she's the perfect woman, who loves our jokes, loves us regardless of anything else, doesn't seem to care about money and is just too damn sweet. We barely know these girls/women, maybe engage in 3-minute conversations a few times a week at the water cooler and flash each other bright smiles down the hallway. It doesn't qualify for any kind of relationship (maybe except that guy/gal from work/school)...but in our young, love-lusting minds, they are the perfect saviours for our lovelorn lives. This is the essence of this movie...one that causes me to identify with Tom Cruise's character in the movie (yeah, even I was 17 once). But this movie, takes that 17-year-old-romance factor and makes it believable when it afflicts Tom Cruise. That, is an achievement in great storytelling.I haven't seen the original and I'm sure it must be a good movie...but I still wonder if it can top the Cruise/Crowe experience.Excellent choice for repeat viewings (in the same category as Terminator 2: Judgement Day. At least I can't seem to tire of these two...surprisingly, I no longer feel like sitting through The Matrix that frequently!)P.S. You must really love this movie if you understand the title. I realized it after the 10th time (or something) I saw it. Its the scene, the morning-after the nightclub scene. It's shown twice in the movie - Halfway through and at the very end.

589364,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JKMY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The strange thing about dreams is that, while in one, the dreamer usually does not realize a dream is taking place.  Only upon the conclusion of the dream experience is an individual able to distinguish between dream and reality.  That concept is the driving force behind ""Vanilla Sky"".For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on David Aames (Tom Cruise), the heir to a vast business fortune who is very much a playboy.  At a party one night, David is smitten by exotic beauty Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) and begins a relationship with her.  When jealous fling Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) finds out, however, she involves David in an accident that will change his life forever.  Because this is a ""big reveal"" type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.There are two primary reasons that ""Vanilla Sky"" is such an extraordinary film:First, it is very much high-concept.  Much like ""Inception"", or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", this movie deals with dreams and how they affect the dreamers.  This plotline is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.Secondly, though, is that a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves.  In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot-on.  It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.Overall, ""Vanilla Sky"" is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with ""Eternal Sunshine"", ""Memento"", ""The Matrix"", and the like.  It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion.  Simply put, the only people this movie won't appeal to are those purely wanting action/adventure.  This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.",5,How Can You Be 100% Sure You Aren't Dreaming Right Now?,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1943,"['strange', 'thing', 'dreams', 'one', 'dreamer', 'usually', 'not', 'realize', 'dream', 'taking', 'place', 'Only', 'conclusion', 'dream', 'experience', 'individual', 'able', 'distinguish', 'dream', 'reality', 'concept', 'driving', 'force', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'David', 'Aames', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'heir', 'vast', 'business', 'fortune', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'playboy', 'party', 'one', 'night', 'David', 'smitten', 'exotic', 'beauty', 'Sofia', 'Serrano', 'Penelope', 'Cruz', 'relationship', 'When', 'jealous', 'fling', 'Julie', 'Gianni', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'out', 'however', 'David', 'accident', 'will', 'change', 'life', 'forever', 'big', 'reveal', 'type', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'here', 'prevent', 'spoilers.There', 'are', 'two', 'primary', 'reasons', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'First', 'very', 'much', 'high-concept', 'Much', 'Inception', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'movie', 'dreams', 'how', 'affect', 'dreamers', 'plotline', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'think', 'viewing', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'still', 'rattling', 'around', 'brain', 'awhile', 'viewing.Secondly', 'film', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'can', 'only', 'work', 'incredible', 'character', 'development', 'indeed', 'order', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'ending', 'overall', 'journey', 'writing', 'acting', 'must', 'be', 'spot-on', 'such', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'truly', 'care', 'struggles', 'David', 'Aames', 'world.Overall', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'excellent', 'concept', 'film', 'right', 'there', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Memento', 'Matrix', 'like', 'even', 'very', 'much', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'who', 'enjoy', 'high', 'emotion', 'Simply', 'put', 'only', 'people', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'are', 'purely', 'wanting', 'action/adventure', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'more', 'end']",Vanilla Sky VHS
