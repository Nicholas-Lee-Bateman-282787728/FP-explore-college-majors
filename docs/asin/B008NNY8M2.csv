I am pleasantly surprised to see Traci Lords create such a believable, over-controlling Mother character, kudos on her acting interlaced with the dark humor that permeates the movie. Lords might have a future in major films with better roles. Actress McCord, playing an outcast teen, was a running character in the surgical series Nip/Tuck. Ironically, this movie's gruesome plot is similar to Nip/Tuck's dark humor, bizarre bodily themes and sick fantasy flashes. McCord reminds me of Charlize Theron, when Theron went from mostly gorgeous blonde roles to playing serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 'Monster'. McCord could very well be the next Theron (and they look somewhat alike) with her physically trans-formative and strong acting ability.",5,"Great Acting, Great Plot and Gruesome Version of Nip/Tuck",1351814400,"11 2, 2012",2012,841,"['Reviewed', 'Amanda', 'Volovik', 'Chava', 'have', 'say', 'acting', 'strongest', 'part', 'movie', 'am', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'see', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'create', 'believable', 'over-controlling', 'Mother', 'character', 'kudos', 'acting', 'interlaced', 'dark', 'humor', 'movie', 'Lords', 'might', 'have', 'future', 'major', 'films', 'better', 'roles', 'Actress', 'McCord', 'playing', 'outcast', 'teen', 'was', 'running', 'character', 'surgical', 'series', 'Nip/Tuck', 'Ironically', 'movie', 'gruesome', 'plot', 'similar', 'Nip/Tuck', 'dark', 'humor', 'bizarre', 'bodily', 'themes', 'sick', 'fantasy', 'flashes', 'McCord', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'when', 'Theron', 'went', 'mostly', 'gorgeous', 'blonde', 'roles', 'playing', 'serial', 'killer', 'Aileen', 'Wuornos', ""'Monster"", 'McCord', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'next', 'Theron', 'look', 'somewhat', 'alike', 'physically', 'trans-formative', 'strong', 'acting', 'ability']",N/A

Its basically a story about a girl that is mentally insane and it shows in depth her thinking patterns. I haven't seen anything this weird and animated since The Cell. But yet in still this movie is totally and I mean totally more awkward. If you are not open minded and have a twisted mind to some degree? I would advised taking a pass on this one. I have shown this film to some people and they felt it was disqusting while others thought it was brilliant ! I  thought the film was brillant so much I wanted to view all the blood and guts on bluray.The Film basically shows her brain deteriorating as the film progresses. Her nightmares and thought processes get more sick and twisted as the film progresses. There are some scenes where she is talking to God but at the same time she really doesn't believe in him. So if your like real big on religion this may offend some people. The movie also focuses around her family and how she is treated in the house hold. Her sister has a medical condition and doesn't have long to live. Her step mother is a controlling mean and cynical woman. Her father is the passive type that doesn't really stick up for  his family or himself. Basically in a nutshell by the time they realize she is really SICK it is too late. This has got to be one of the most straight forward, gross and sexually daring films I have seen in my life. It taps into the mind of the viewer and makes you question how or why do you feel this way when viewing this. It has some fetish type references in it as well as very twisted visual imagery. But over all I think it stands alone in the horror genre as a milestone in it self. I love this film but I question myself when watching it.If you like this similar filmsAmerican Mary (2013)May (2002)Black Swan  (2010) (If you haven't seen it)Would be worth a check out",5,a Work of ArT That TaPs Into the Mind Of The VieweR .,1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,1968,"['When', 'i', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'i', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'was', 'totally', 'amazed', 'how', 'well', 'was', 'done', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'basically', 'story', 'girl', 'mentally', 'insane', 'depth', 'thinking', 'patterns', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'weird', 'animated', 'Cell', 'yet', 'still', 'movie', 'totally', 'mean', 'totally', 'more', 'awkward', 'are', 'not', 'open', 'minded', 'have', 'twisted', 'mind', 'degree', 'would', 'advised', 'taking', 'pass', 'one', 'have', 'shown', 'film', 'people', 'felt', 'was', 'disqusting', 'others', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'brillant', 'so', 'much', 'wanted', 'view', 'blood', 'guts', 'bluray.The', 'Film', 'basically', 'brain', 'deteriorating', 'film', 'nightmares', 'thought', 'processes', 'get', 'more', 'sick', 'twisted', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'talking', 'God', 'same', 'time', 'really', ""n't"", 'believe', 'So', 'real', 'big', 'religion', 'may', 'offend', 'people', 'movie', 'also', 'family', 'how', 'treated', 'house', 'hold', 'sister', 'medical', 'condition', ""n't"", 'have', 'long', 'live', 'step', 'mother', 'controlling', 'mean', 'cynical', 'woman', 'father', 'passive', 'type', ""n't"", 'really', 'stick', 'up', 'family', 'Basically', 'nutshell', 'time', 'realize', 'really', 'SICK', 'too', 'late', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'straight', 'forward', 'gross', 'sexually', 'daring', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'mind', 'viewer', 'question', 'how', 'why', 'do', 'feel', 'way', 'when', 'viewing', 'fetish', 'type', 'references', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'twisted', 'visual', 'imagery', 'think', 'alone', 'horror', 'genre', 'milestone', 'love', 'film', 'question', 'when', 'watching', 'it.If', 'similar', 'filmsAmerican', 'Mary', '2013', 'May', '2002', 'Black', 'Swan', '2010', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Would', 'be', 'check', 'out']",N/A

1571689,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008NNY8M2,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","While labeling Excision as a horror seems unusual to me since the film feels more like a deranged whacked-out drama, that's not to say it doesn't contain its share of gross and bloody scenes.  Then again maybe my definition of horror isn't the same as everyone elses?  You see Excision isn't really terrifying.  You're never really scared but you certainly *are* grossed out.  However Excision isn't your typical bloody slasher- it focuses on a teenage girl played by Anna Lynne McCord who has vivid and horrifying images and nightmares involving naked women lying in blood-soaked bathtubs and other kinds of mentally unhealthy images.What makes this movie click so amazingly well is that it never misses a beat.  There's never a dull moment due to the fast pace and constantly exciting and unpredictable nature of Anna as she gradually becomes a mentally disturbed outcast.  None of the other girls at school like her very much (which is ironic because I think I'd prefer Anna over those prissy girls anyday!)  Anna aspires to be in the medical field but she doesn't appear to be motivated enough to fulfill those dreams... at least that's what it seems like initially.  Don't wanna explain on that point any further. :)This movie is loaded with fascinating segments so I don't want to spoil them all, but the ones where Anna sends a message to a boy because he's the one she wants to have sex with is quite interesting (and VERY gross when it finally occurs, for reasons I shall not dare say!) and the abortion dream or daydream is quite the surprise too.  Talk about a moment that comes out of nowhere.  This one is very uncomfortable to watch too.  Also when she gets into a fight with those high and mighty girls I mention above... classic moment of storytelling!  You knew it was coming, haha.  It seems whenever Anna's sitting with her family at the dinner table, interesting and often times hilarious discussions always come up with her family!Speaking of Anna's family, another amazing part of Excision is that the entire cast is pure gold.  Her mother is basically another high and mighty you-know-what, and she's about as unlikeable as anyone can imagine.  She considers Anna achieving her career and growing up properly of incredible importance.  Her very beautiful younger sister played by Ariel Winter is dying of cystic fibrosis (and perhaps the only flaw with this movie is that, despite the parts where she needs oxygen, Ariel never appears to be dying at all and instead looks incredibly healthy).  The father is the biggest wimp ever.  He sits there and LETS his wife criticize him to the moon and doesn't say a word or defend himself at all.  Makes me think he feels overpowered being in the house with 3 women, lol.I guess it feels a bit strange how Anna's behavior began.  Not sure if it was even explained.  I mean, looking at her family members, the only reasons I can think of for her becoming the way she did is because her mom is intolerable and not at all affectionate, and probably the stress of her sister dying of a horrible disease is too much to handle, so Anna goes crazy as a result.  The ending... wow, can't reveal what happens there!  BIG surprise!  You'll probably see it coming, but not *quite* like you think it will.  Perhaps the very very end is a disappointment.  They should have elaborated on that final point, I think.  Overall however, it's all about Anna Lynne McCord's deranged/psychotic/sexually curious character that makes Excision quite the unique film.  If this is the direction horror is heading in, hey, I'm aboard!  This movie's awesome!

I might also add that Traci Lords as the mother was great in her role (who can forget her as a fifteen year old porn star?!).  I also saw Scorned with AnnaLynne.  Here lies the problem.  In both cases you have a strange movie that has I believe simply too much gore even though I have a strong stomach for such.  I love for instance the dark humor in Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble, early cult classics by John Waters (who was in this as the shrink who never helped her!) but in those Waters movies the gore was such that you could stand it for some reason; I guess it was just so freaking hilarious.  In this case though if you have any aversion at all to blood and guts, stay away from this film.Ultimately I believe that with the right script AnnaLynne could have a break out movie that would really rise her to the fame she deserves.  She is both really funny and really dark; and the combo is delicious.

I was a bit shocked at first to find her playing a character completely unlike the one she plays in 90210, here in Excision instead of the blonde bombshell McCord plays Pauline, a homely brunette with delusions of grandeur on becoming a surgeon.  Her sister Grace, played by Ariel Winter of Modern Family, is sick and will eventually need a risky lung replacement.  Add in an ultra-controlling mother, played by Tracy Lords, and you have the main characters.The movie cuts in and out of scenes that are playing out, scenes that McCord's character dreams or imagines and scenes where McCord's character prays out loud to a God that it is pretty obvious she doesn't believe in.  I have to say that some of the dream sequences are pretty bizarre and may really turn off some people.  For me, it was bizarre enough to be interesting and I thought they added nicely to the mental state of Pauline.Excision is a bizarre pairing of drama, black comedy and horror genres.

Unfortunately that same generation missed out on the artistic side and has clung to the quirkiness of his films offering movies that while weird aren't usually entertaining. Until the final moments of EXCISION, that's the case here.Anna Lynne McCord stars as Pauline, a disillusioned teen who dreams of being a surgeon one day but who has no plans of following what it takes to get there. She refuses to study, does everything in her power to make herself the outsider in her school and for the most part is just plain disagreeable. Pauline is what teens appear to be these days, a young person who dreams of glory and expects it to just happen.Pauline's mother is completely different. Phyllis (Traci Lords) is a prim and proper home maker. Not quite June Cleaver, but she plans out her dinners, expects her children to eat at the table and not leave until excused and wants what is best for both of her daughters. Pauline's sister suffers from a disease that will eventually require her to have a lung replaced. Due to this ailment she usually gets preferential treatment. Her father is just a fixture in the house, rarely taking sides in any argument except to back his wife when she pushes the issue.Pauline is a completely unlikable character in this film. Make up has provided her with the typical teenage zits problem, she doesn't comb her hair and she dresses in the drabbest way possible. She's an outsider who wants nothing to do with the other kids at school and the feeling is mutual. Her days are spent trying to figure out ways not to develop into something else and her dreams are filled with people dressed in white who almost always find a way to cover themselves in blood.Pauline does make an attempt at normality of sorts. She decides it's time she lost her virginity and approaches a young boy to be the one to deflower her. He shrugs her off in front of her friends but eventually gives her a call. They retreat to a motel room where they have at it. Things go smoothly until Pauline asks him to perform oral sex on her. It's only then that he realizes she's on her period, something she planned to avoid pregnancy but never bothered to tell him. This results in his girlfriend getting even with Pauline when she learns and painting words like slut on her house. Yes, it's that kind of movie folks.The movie moves along at a snails pace and is filled with little more than one attempt after another for Pauline to try and anger her mother. Most films that feature teen angst are trying to make a point, here it's just a plot device to move the film forward. Or is it?The film has an upsetting and mind blowing ending that makes the entire film seem completely different in retrospect. The problem is that it takes almost the entire length of the film to get there, giving nothing but weird and boring moments until then. While watching I had this feeling of saying that this film was the biggest waste of time I'd seen in ages. But after the end I found myself thinking about it differently. Yes, it's still not for everyone and only those with a taste for the unusual will like it. But it's not the terrible film it seemed while watching it.My guess is that this film will develop some sort of cult following if those who find themselves into this sort of thing can discover it. Once they do perhaps it will be listed as a film that critics will recommend as something startling, something inventive and something original. It is all those things but its also slow moving and not in the best way possible. If you decide to watch this one then watch it all the way through to the end. Only then will it make it a film worth watching.",3,NEW TURN ON THE TROUBLED TEEN,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",2012,3809,"['generation', 'film', 'makers', 'been', 'influenced', 'David', 'Lynch', 'director', 'artistic', 'touch', 'movies', 'were', 'always', 'interesting', 'always', 'quirky', 'Unfortunately', 'same', 'generation', 'missed', 'out', 'artistic', 'side', 'clung', 'quirkiness', 'films', 'offering', 'movies', 'weird', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'entertaining', 'final', 'moments', 'EXCISION', 'case', 'here.Anna', 'Lynne', 'McCord', 'Pauline', 'disillusioned', 'teen', 'who', 'being', 'surgeon', 'one', 'day', 'who', 'plans', 'following', 'what', 'get', 'there', 'study', 'everything', 'power', 'make', 'outsider', 'school', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'plain', 'disagreeable', 'Pauline', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'days', 'young', 'person', 'who', 'glory', 'just', 'happen.Pauline', 'mother', 'completely', 'different', 'Phyllis', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'prim', 'proper', 'home', 'maker', 'Not', 'quite', 'June', 'Cleaver', 'out', 'dinners', 'children', 'eat', 'table', 'not', 'leave', 'excused', 'what', 'best', 'daughters', 'Pauline', 'sister', 'suffers', 'disease', 'will', 'eventually', 'require', 'have', 'lung', 'replaced', 'Due', 'ailment', 'usually', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'father', 'just', 'fixture', 'house', 'rarely', 'taking', 'sides', 'argument', 'back', 'wife', 'when', 'issue.Pauline', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'character', 'film', 'Make', 'up', 'provided', 'typical', 'teenage', 'zits', 'problem', ""n't"", 'comb', 'hair', 'drabbest', 'way', 'possible', 'outsider', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'kids', 'school', 'feeling', 'mutual', 'days', 'are', 'spent', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'ways', 'not', 'develop', 'something', 'else', 'dreams', 'are', 'filled', 'people', 'dressed', 'white', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'find', 'way', 'cover', 'blood.Pauline', 'make', 'attempt', 'normality', 'sorts', 'time', 'lost', 'virginity', 'young', 'boy', 'be', 'one', 'deflower', 'shrugs', 'off', 'front', 'friends', 'eventually', 'call', 'retreat', 'motel', 'room', 'where', 'have', 'Things', 'go', 'smoothly', 'Pauline', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'only', 'then', 'period', 'something', 'planned', 'avoid', 'pregnancy', 'never', 'bothered', 'tell', 'results', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'even', 'Pauline', 'when', 'painting', 'words', 'slut', 'house', 'Yes', 'kind', 'movie', 'folks.The', 'movie', 'moves', 'along', 'snails', 'pace', 'filled', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'attempt', 'Pauline', 'try', 'anger', 'mother', 'Most', 'films', 'feature', 'teen', 'angst', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'here', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'move', 'film', 'forward', 'film', 'upsetting', 'mind', 'blowing', 'ending', 'entire', 'film', 'seem', 'completely', 'different', 'retrospect', 'problem', 'almost', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'get', 'there', 'giving', 'nothing', 'weird', 'boring', 'moments', 'then', 'watching', 'had', 'feeling', 'saying', 'film', 'was', 'biggest', 'waste', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'ages', 'end', 'found', 'thinking', 'differently', 'Yes', 'still', 'not', 'everyone', 'only', 'taste', 'unusual', 'will', 'like', 'not', 'terrible', 'film', 'seemed', 'watching', 'it.My', 'guess', 'film', 'will', 'develop', 'sort', 'cult', 'following', 'who', 'find', 'sort', 'thing', 'can', 'discover', 'do', 'perhaps', 'will', 'be', 'listed', 'film', 'critics', 'will', 'recommend', 'something', 'startling', 'something', 'inventive', 'something', 'original', 'things', 'also', 'slow', 'moving', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'decide', 'watch', 'one', 'then', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'Only', 'then', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

1571723,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B008NNY8M2,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[2, 2]","Nine Things about the Movie ""Excision"" (USA, 2012)1. This bizarrely perverse movie is part family drama, part comedy, and part... grotesque. I really wasn't sure how to feel about it when it was over.2. It's about Pauline, a ragingly awkward, mentally disturbed young woman who has orgasms when she dreams about herself and others being mutilated.3. She lives in a dysfunctional upper-class household. Her younger sister Grace is slowly dying from cystic fibrosis, her mother Phyllis (played wonderfully by ex-porn star Traci Lords) is a frigid, pious bitch who browbeats her husband Bob incessantly.4. The actress that plays Pauline, AnnaLynne McCord, gives an extremely strong performance here. Simultaneously hard to watch but impossible to look away, and she brings a unique tension to her role that I haven't seen before.5. Knowing that there is something wrong with Pauline, but not wanting to send her to a real doctor, Phyllis has Pauline go to therapy with a church pastor (when John Waters plays a reverend, you know the movie is weird). This causes everyone to miss the increasingly obvious signs that Pauline is headed for a terrible resolution to her delusional life.6.  Pauline tries to make sense of her life by talking to God, even though she doesn't believe in him.7. The scene where Pauline loses her virginity is one of the more memorable ""first-time"" scenes ever put on film.8. The humor in the film is genuinely funny, but it feels out of place, given the rest of the story. This may be intentional, since it just increases the general sense of awkwardness and unease. The script also has an unorthodox intelligence; some of the details in the movie don't really make sense until several scenes later.9. The more I think about the movie, the more I like it. It is beautifully filmed, uncomfortably violent, and uniquely strange. And I have to give it respect because it pulled emotions out of me that I really have no name for.e ""first-time"" scenes ever put on film.",4,Teenage angst such as you've never experienced,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1987,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', 'Excision', 'USA', '2012', '1', 'bizarrely', 'perverse', 'movie', 'part', 'family', 'drama', 'part', 'comedy', 'part', 'grotesque', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'feel', 'when', 'was', 'over.2', 'Pauline', 'ragingly', 'awkward', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'orgasms', 'when', 'others', 'being', 'mutilated.3', 'dysfunctional', 'upper-class', 'household', 'younger', 'sister', 'Grace', 'slowly', 'dying', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'mother', 'Phyllis', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'ex-porn', 'star', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'frigid', 'pious', 'bitch', 'who', 'husband', 'Bob', 'incessantly.4', 'actress', 'Pauline', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', 'extremely', 'strong', 'performance', 'here', 'Simultaneously', 'hard', 'watch', 'impossible', 'look', 'away', 'unique', 'tension', 'role', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.5', 'Knowing', 'something', 'wrong', 'Pauline', 'not', 'wanting', 'send', 'real', 'doctor', 'Phyllis', 'Pauline', 'go', 'therapy', 'church', 'pastor', 'when', 'John', 'Waters', 'reverend', 'know', 'movie', 'weird', 'everyone', 'miss', 'increasingly', 'obvious', 'signs', 'Pauline', 'headed', 'terrible', 'resolution', 'delusional', 'life.6', 'Pauline', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'talking', 'God', 'even', ""n't"", 'believe', 'him.7', 'scene', 'where', 'Pauline', 'virginity', 'one', 'more', 'memorable', 'first-time', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'film.8', 'humor', 'film', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'place', 'given', 'rest', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'intentional', 'just', 'general', 'sense', 'awkwardness', 'unease', 'script', 'also', 'unorthodox', 'intelligence', 'details', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'several', 'scenes', 'later.9', 'more', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'uncomfortably', 'violent', 'uniquely', 'strange', 'have', 'give', 'respect', 'pulled', 'emotions', 'really', 'have', 'name', 'first-time', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'film']",N/A

I was finally able to watch it and was totally pleased with what I saw yet a little disappointed, let me explain. The film's about a tom boyish teenage girl who is basically a social outcast, she is not pretty (In the film) and is not shy about speaking her mind. She lives with her parents, a mother who is very prissy an uptight and a father who is super laid back an distracted. She also has a younger sister with if I'm not mistaken has a lung disease who is on medication and has a breathing machine to help her at times.The film moves along through this awkward teens day to day and explores her wants, desires and experimentation's. It also takes us into her wild and twisted dreams every night where we get to see another side of her that gives her a kind of pleasure as seen from her reactions to the dreams when she awakens in the morning. It shows us how one curious misunderstood teen can act out her dreams and desires for what she thinks is her ultimate pleasure even if its hurting the people she loves without meaning to.It is a rather serious film but comical at times (she has heart to hearts with god whom she doesn't really believe in, which are amusing) and has elements of horror sprinkled in (the dreams and the ending). Overall the acting is spot on, the scenes are well shot and the story was superb. The thing that disappointed me the most about ""Excision"" was the ending, as in it left more to be desired, I wanted to know what happened next, I wanted more! Those looking for the next diamond in the ruff horror film might be disappointed with ""Excision"" as its a film with few horror elements in it. It is bizarre, trippy and well put together though, making it a diamond in the ruff for those who love a film experience that differs from the norm.",4,"""A Walk Down Trippy Lane""",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1852,"['kept', 'hearing', 'movie', 'net', 'yet', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'watch', 'was', 'totally', 'pleased', 'what', 'saw', 'yet', 'little', 'disappointed', 'let', 'explain', 'film', 'tom', 'boyish', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'basically', 'social', 'outcast', 'not', 'pretty', 'film', 'not', 'shy', 'speaking', 'mind', 'parents', 'mother', 'who', 'very', 'prissy', 'uptight', 'father', 'who', 'super', 'laid', 'back', 'distracted', 'also', 'younger', 'sister', ""'m"", 'not', 'mistaken', 'lung', 'disease', 'who', 'medication', 'breathing', 'machine', 'help', 'times.The', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'awkward', 'day', 'day', 'desires', 'experimentation', 'also', 'wild', 'twisted', 'dreams', 'night', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'side', 'kind', 'pleasure', 'seen', 'reactions', 'dreams', 'when', 'morning', 'how', 'one', 'curious', 'misunderstood', 'teen', 'can', 'act', 'out', 'dreams', 'desires', 'what', 'ultimate', 'pleasure', 'even', 'hurting', 'people', 'meaning', 'to.It', 'rather', 'serious', 'film', 'comical', 'times', 'heart', 'hearts', 'god', 'whom', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'are', 'amusing', 'elements', 'horror', 'sprinkled', 'dreams', 'ending', 'acting', 'spot', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'shot', 'story', 'was', 'superb', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'most', 'Excision', 'was', 'ending', 'left', 'more', 'be', 'desired', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'wanted', 'more', 'looking', 'next', 'diamond', 'ruff', 'horror', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Excision', 'film', 'few', 'horror', 'elements', 'bizarre', 'trippy', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'making', 'diamond', 'ruff', 'who', 'love', 'film', 'experience', 'norm']",N/A
1571735,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B008NNY8M2,titania86,"[2, 3]","** This review contains spoilers. **Pauline is a mentally disturbed social outcast, prone to odd outbursts and delusions. Her fascination of blood and viscera crosses the borders fetish and obsession and she dreams about being a great surgeon one day. The other kids at school just think she's really weird and either make fun of her or simply ignore her. Her parents are in denial about her mental health and skimp on treatment by taking her to a local priest instead of a therapist, which isn't really doing any good. Her little sister Grace, whom she loves dearly, has cystic fibrosis and is rapidly getting worse. Pauline has been working on her own solution to her sister's problem that will shock everyone.Excision is an unexpected movie. I figured it would be full of gore and blood (which it does have), but not a thoughtful character study of a dysfuctional family with a shocking ending. The family dynamic is utterly believable with realistic characters. There's Pauline, the black sheep of the family. Although not a good student by any stretch of the imagination, she dreams of being a surgeon. Her actual dreams have very little to do with surgery and a lot to do with gallons of blood, organs, and half naked people. They give great insight into her growing madness and twisted sense of sexuality. Her behavior is a little weirder and more abrasive than social outcasts usually are in film, but I felt it was a more authentic portrayal of someone with an undiagnosed mental illness. She isn't afraid to push people's buttons tell people her blunt opinion whether they want to hear it or not. Her bluntness and her periodic conversations with God are actually pretty funny and lighten the mood of an otherwise very dark film. On some level, she knows she has a problem and even tries to get the principal of her school to send her to a psychiatrist, which he laughs off. This makes the ending all the more tragic. AnnaLynne McCord does a phenomenal job of changing her entire appearance, posture, and speech patterns to play Pauline.Grace carries a lot of baggage for a teenage girl. She has cystic fibrosis and the condition drastically worsens to the point where she will have to risk a lung transplant to survive. One of her friends with the same condition died, bringing her own mortality into the forefront of her mind. Other than that, she's a normal girl with concerns about boys, clothes, and school. Her mother considers her to be the perfect daughter because her interests coincide with those she approves of and her attitude and comportment are normal. Grace is a sweet girl who brings out the good in everyone. Pauline would do anything to protect her sister even though she may go about it the wrong way. Ariel Winter captures the balance of naivete and cynicism that Grace feels.Pauline's parents, Phyllis and Bob, are fairly normal. Phyllis is very Christian and proper and wants her daughters to emulate her. Her pursuit of the perfect family is hindered by the reality of her daughters' sicknesses. To counteract reality, she attempts to force Pauline to be normal by yelling and berating her every day. However, she's not an evil person and really does love Pauline. Traci Lords conveys the frustrated mother's overbearing nature and concern for Pauline very well. Bob is complacent and only steps in when Phyllis falls apart. Both of them try to basically sweep Pauline under the rug without addressing any of her problems for a couple of reasons. One is shame. Our society still has a pretty significant stigma on mental illness, causing people like Phyllis, to act as if her daughter doesn't have any problems for the sake of appearing to have a perfect family. The second one is the expense. The family seemed pretty well off, but if insurance doesn't cover it, therapy and psychiatric drugs can very expensive and needed over long periods of time. This aspect is particularly relevant today since the Newtown shooting put American mental health services (or lack thereof) into focus.**Spoilers** The ending of Excision is one of the most powerful and heartbreaking. Pauline, at the height of her delusions, operates on Grace in their garage, swapping her lungs for another girl's. When Phyllis finds them and Pauline is glowing with happiness that the surgery went well, I just lost it and cried. Pauline just wanted to help her sister and felt she could do this for Grace and for her family. Then realization sets in and Pauline starts to cry. The scene, although obviously bloody, is in stark contrast with the dream sequences and the tragic result of trying to bring those dreams into reality.Excision is a complex film that features some great performances and compelling characters. There is admittedly not a whole lot of plot, but it gives more emphasis and care to the character building. This would really be the only thing that was wrong with the film. The film is powerful and honest and I highly recommend it.",4,A relevant and honest horror film,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,4957,"['**', 'review', 'spoilers', '**Pauline', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'social', 'outcast', 'prone', 'odd', 'outbursts', 'delusions', 'fascination', 'blood', 'viscera', 'borders', 'fetish', 'obsession', 'being', 'great', 'surgeon', 'one', 'day', 'other', 'kids', 'school', 'just', 'think', 'really', 'weird', 'make', 'fun', 'simply', 'ignore', 'parents', 'are', 'denial', 'mental', 'health', 'skimp', 'treatment', 'taking', 'local', 'priest', 'instead', 'therapist', ""n't"", 'really', 'doing', 'good', 'little', 'sister', 'Grace', 'whom', 'dearly', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'rapidly', 'getting', 'worse', 'Pauline', 'been', 'working', 'own', 'solution', 'sister', 'problem', 'will', 'shock', 'everyone.Excision', 'unexpected', 'movie', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'gore', 'blood', 'have', 'not', 'thoughtful', 'character', 'study', 'dysfuctional', 'family', 'shocking', 'ending', 'family', 'dynamic', 'utterly', 'believable', 'realistic', 'characters', 'Pauline', 'black', 'sheep', 'family', 'not', 'good', 'student', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'being', 'surgeon', 'actual', 'dreams', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'surgery', 'lot', 'do', 'gallons', 'blood', 'organs', 'half', 'naked', 'people', 'give', 'great', 'insight', 'growing', 'madness', 'twisted', 'sense', 'sexuality', 'behavior', 'little', 'weirder', 'more', 'abrasive', 'social', 'outcasts', 'usually', 'are', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'more', 'authentic', 'portrayal', 'someone', 'undiagnosed', 'mental', 'illness', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'push', 'people', 'buttons', 'tell', 'people', 'blunt', 'opinion', 'want', 'hear', 'not', 'bluntness', 'periodic', 'conversations', 'God', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'mood', 'otherwise', 'very', 'dark', 'film', 'level', 'problem', 'even', 'tries', 'get', 'principal', 'school', 'send', 'psychiatrist', 'off', 'ending', 'more', 'tragic', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'changing', 'entire', 'appearance', 'posture', 'speech', 'patterns', 'play', 'Pauline.Grace', 'lot', 'baggage', 'teenage', 'girl', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'condition', 'drastically', 'point', 'where', 'will', 'have', 'risk', 'lung', 'transplant', 'survive', 'One', 'friends', 'same', 'condition', 'died', 'bringing', 'own', 'mortality', 'forefront', 'mind', 'Other', 'normal', 'girl', 'concerns', 'boys', 'clothes', 'school', 'mother', 'be', 'perfect', 'daughter', 'interests', 'coincide', 'attitude', 'comportment', 'are', 'normal', 'Grace', 'sweet', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'good', 'everyone', 'Pauline', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'sister', 'even', 'may', 'go', 'wrong', 'way', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'balance', 'naivete', 'cynicism', 'Grace', 'feels.Pauline', 'parents', 'Phyllis', 'Bob', 'are', 'fairly', 'normal', 'Phyllis', 'very', 'Christian', 'proper', 'daughters', 'emulate', 'pursuit', 'perfect', 'family', 'hindered', 'reality', 'daughters', 'sicknesses', 'counteract', 'reality', 'force', 'Pauline', 'be', 'normal', 'yelling', 'berating', 'day', 'However', 'not', 'evil', 'person', 'really', 'love', 'Pauline', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'overbearing', 'nature', 'concern', 'Pauline', 'very', 'well', 'Bob', 'complacent', 'only', 'steps', 'when', 'Phyllis', 'apart', 'try', 'basically', 'sweep', 'Pauline', 'rug', 'addressing', 'problems', 'couple', 'reasons', 'One', 'shame', 'society', 'still', 'pretty', 'significant', 'stigma', 'mental', 'illness', 'causing', 'people', 'Phyllis', 'act', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'sake', 'appearing', 'have', 'perfect', 'family', 'second', 'one', 'expense', 'family', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'well', 'insurance', ""n't"", 'cover', 'therapy', 'psychiatric', 'drugs', 'can', 'very', 'expensive', 'needed', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'aspect', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'today', 'Newtown', 'shooting', 'put', 'American', 'mental', 'health', 'services', 'lack', 'thereof', 'focus', '**Spoilers**', 'ending', 'Excision', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'heartbreaking', 'Pauline', 'height', 'delusions', 'Grace', 'garage', 'swapping', 'lungs', 'girl', 'When', 'Phyllis', 'Pauline', 'glowing', 'happiness', 'surgery', 'went', 'well', 'just', 'lost', 'cried', 'Pauline', 'just', 'wanted', 'help', 'sister', 'felt', 'could', 'do', 'Grace', 'family', 'Then', 'realization', 'sets', 'Pauline', 'cry', 'scene', 'obviously', 'bloody', 'stark', 'contrast', 'dream', 'sequences', 'tragic', 'result', 'trying', 'bring', 'dreams', 'reality.Excision', 'complex', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'compelling', 'characters', 'admittedly', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'plot', 'more', 'emphasis', 'care', 'character', 'building', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'film', 'powerful', 'honest', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1571739,A2VYWLTNR8JORA,B008NNY8M2,what could have been,"[2, 3]","I've seen a lot of movies in my lifetime. When I say a lot, I mean far too many to ever dare count or recall if I had to. I've been intrigued by the horror film genre since I was a pre-teen. Now, in my 30's, I can safely say that I am no less intrigued than I ever was. I am, however, jaded. It seems that the horror film genre has gotten either a. lazy or b. capitalistic or c. a combination of both. Thanks to Michael Bay, nearly every film that I loved as a child of the 80's has been eviscerated. Every once in a while a little GEM comes along that gets me truly EXCITED about horror movies again. Excision is THAT film.Excision is an intelligent film. It knows its own strengths; a slow build is the best recipe for true horror. Those expecting a cheap thrills, ""jump scare"" film will be sorely disappointed. Excision has a far bigger IQ than Paranormal Activity. And those expecting exploitation (A Serbian Film, Cannibal Holocaust, Human Centipede) will also be let down. This film is disturbing, but it's more of a tragedy than a shocker. I won't give anything away; I'll just say that the viewer knows what is going to happen at the hands of Pauline, as we see her psyche unravel piece by piece. Despite the fact that Excision is a black comedy, it is ultimately a tragedy masked in gory imagery and sassy witticism.Fans of Lucky McKee's brilliant 2002 film MAY (Angela Bettis) will most likely appreciate this most. Much like May, Excision is a slow descent into madness. And much like Angela Bettis in MAY, AnnaLynne McCord gives a stunning performance as a disturbed young woman. I've read an amazon review or two citing that Traci Lords' acting is bad in this picture? WHAT???? Again: What??? I know that this is about opinion, but I have to wholly disagree with the sentiment. Lords is amazing as the uptight, suburban ""everything has to look perfect from the outside,"" mother. And she MAKES the ending work. Without her, this would not be the effective film that it is.I notice other film influences here (intentional or otherwise): Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo, Santa Sangre), Todd Solondz (Welcome to the Dollhouse, Palindromes) and MAYBE a little Cronenberg. Fans of Ginger Snaps and Martyrs will also most likely appreciate this effort.The imagery is nothing short of brilliant (and is the main catalyst for my Jodorowsky comparrison). Pauline's sexually sadistic fantasies are portrayed in vivid, candy colored detail. The cinematography is beautifully surreal and disturbing. Even more effective, imo, is the device of Pauline's ""confessions to god."" Though surrounded by darkness, Pauline is lit, vigil like. The ""confessions"" give the audience Pauline's narrative; it's a direct vein to her psyche.My best advice is to go into this film without knowing too much about it before hand. I tried to review sans spoilers, which can be difficult to do. As I said earlier, the audience can guess as to where Pauline is headed, but it's far more rewarding to guess as the film rolls. Buy this film. Heck, if for anything, maybe just to support independent film makers. We need more under the radar talent to breathe new life (no pun intended) into a genre controlled by suits.",5,Is Richard Bates Jr. this year's Lucky McKee?,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,3192,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'lifetime', 'When', 'say', 'lot', 'mean', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'ever', 'dare', 'count', 'recall', 'had', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intrigued', 'horror', 'film', 'genre', 'was', 'pre-teen', 'Now', '30', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'am', 'less', 'intrigued', 'ever', 'was', 'am', 'however', 'jaded', 'horror', 'film', 'genre', 'gotten', 'a.', 'lazy', 'b.', 'capitalistic', 'c.', 'combination', 'Thanks', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'nearly', 'film', 'loved', 'child', '80', 'been', 'eviscerated', 'once', 'while', 'little', 'GEM', 'truly', 'EXCITED', 'horror', 'movies', 'again', 'Excision', 'film.Excision', 'intelligent', 'film', 'own', 'strengths', 'slow', 'build', 'best', 'recipe', 'true', 'horror', 'expecting', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'jump', 'scare', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Excision', 'far', 'bigger', 'IQ', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'expecting', 'exploitation', 'Serbian', 'Film', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', 'Human', 'Centipede', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'film', 'disturbing', 'more', 'tragedy', 'shocker', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'viewer', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'hands', 'Pauline', 'see', 'psyche', 'unravel', 'piece', 'piece', 'fact', 'Excision', 'black', 'comedy', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'masked', 'gory', 'imagery', 'sassy', 'witticism.Fans', 'Lucky', 'McKee', 'brilliant', '2002', 'film', 'MAY', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'most', 'Much', 'May', 'Excision', 'slow', 'descent', 'madness', 'much', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'MAY', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', 'stunning', 'performance', 'disturbed', 'young', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'read', 'amazon', 'review', 'two', 'citing', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'acting', 'bad', 'picture', 'WHAT', 'Again', 'What', 'know', 'opinion', 'have', 'wholly', 'disagree', 'sentiment', 'Lords', 'amazing', 'uptight', 'suburban', 'everything', 'look', 'perfect', 'outside', 'mother', 'MAKES', 'ending', 'work', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'effective', 'film', 'is.I', 'notice', 'other', 'film', 'influences', 'here', 'intentional', 'otherwise', 'Alejandro', 'Jodorowsky', 'El', 'Topo', 'Santa', 'Sangre', 'Todd', 'Solondz', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'Palindromes', 'MAYBE', 'little', 'Cronenberg', 'Fans', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'Martyrs', 'will', 'also', 'most', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'effort.The', 'imagery', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'main', 'catalyst', 'Jodorowsky', 'comparrison', 'Pauline', 'sexually', 'sadistic', 'fantasies', 'are', 'portrayed', 'vivid', 'candy', 'colored', 'detail', 'cinematography', 'beautifully', 'surreal', 'disturbing', 'Even', 'more', 'effective', 'imo', 'device', 'Pauline', 'confessions', 'god', 'surrounded', 'darkness', 'Pauline', 'lit', 'vigil', 'confessions', 'give', 'audience', 'Pauline', 'narrative', 'direct', 'vein', 'psyche.My', 'best', 'advice', 'go', 'film', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'hand', 'tried', 'review', 'sans', 'spoilers', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'do', 'said', 'earlier', 'audience', 'can', 'guess', 'where', 'Pauline', 'headed', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'guess', 'film', 'rolls', 'Buy', 'film', 'Heck', 'anything', 'maybe', 'just', 'support', 'independent', 'film', 'makers', 'need', 'more', 'radar', 'talent', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'pun', 'intended', 'genre', 'controlled', 'suits']",N/A

Highly recommended to viewers with a special taste in the bizarre and off the beaten track.",5,An exercise in political incorrectness,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,449,"['Same', 'festival', 'Vienna', 'Chained', 'different', 'film', 'have', 'thank', 'director', 'hilarious', 'crazy', 'dirty', 'funny', 'sickening', 'last', 'reel', 'heart', 'soul', 'tearing', 'film', 'actors', 'alone', 'were', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'forgot', 'mention', 'beuatifulest', 'line', 'Pauline', 'dream', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'were', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'viewers', 'special', 'taste', 'bizarre', 'beaten', 'track']",N/A

If the point was to underline the huge potential of AnnaLynne McCord as an upcoming talent, then the movie was a complete success and deserves five stars. However, if the whole exercise was to highlight some kind of pseudo intellectual filmography or direction, or plot, then the movie is a total failure and deserves one star.The story is very simple. Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord) is a very emotionally disturbeb adolescent. She is going to high school with normal kids and we wonder why this kid is in a normal high school instead of an institution. She really speaks her thoughts freely in the morning (at breakfast) or at night (at dinner) with her family, or in school (during class) with her teachers. We follow the dreams of Pauline through the movie and we know that something really bad is coming. Not afraid to confront the high school bullies who are making fun of her. Her father is totally passive while her mother (Traci Lords) is uptight and nasty and only cares about her younger sister who has cystic fibrosis and is slowly dying. She is going to therapy with her priest because her parents are cheap and really don't think that there is anything wrong with her. Pauline is fascinated with science and wants to become a surgeon. Yeah right! Like this is going to happen with her attitude...We expect something major (bad) to happen and it indeed really happens.Malcolm McDowell gives a solid but not significant (as far as the movie plot) performance. I am not sure if Traci Lords was always a bad actrice (even in her previous career) or is just a bad performance in this film, but she is really not up to par in this movie. It is also a very short movie. It is only 81 min with titles rolling and everything. They could have developed the plot a lit bit more if they really wanted to. But I think they run out of blood... for the special effects.I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. It is not a good movie even for horror fans. The special effects are really minimal and involve lots of blood and ...more blood. Nothing special!  Three stars overall for the outstanding performance of AnnaLynn McCord only.",3,What is the point?,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2198,"['Still', 'trying', 'figure', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'point', 'was', 'underline', 'huge', 'potential', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', 'upcoming', 'talent', 'then', 'movie', 'was', 'complete', 'success', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'whole', 'exercise', 'was', 'highlight', 'kind', 'pseudo', 'intellectual', 'filmography', 'direction', 'plot', 'then', 'movie', 'total', 'failure', 'one', 'star.The', 'story', 'very', 'simple', 'Pauline', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', 'very', 'emotionally', 'disturbeb', 'adolescent', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'normal', 'kids', 'wonder', 'why', 'kid', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'instead', 'institution', 'really', 'thoughts', 'freely', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'night', 'dinner', 'family', 'school', 'class', 'teachers', 'follow', 'dreams', 'Pauline', 'movie', 'know', 'something', 'really', 'bad', 'coming', 'Not', 'afraid', 'confront', 'high', 'school', 'bullies', 'who', 'are', 'making', 'fun', 'father', 'totally', 'passive', 'mother', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'uptight', 'nasty', 'only', 'cares', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'cystic', 'fibrosis', 'slowly', 'dying', 'going', 'therapy', 'priest', 'parents', 'are', 'cheap', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Pauline', 'fascinated', 'science', 'become', 'surgeon', 'Yeah', 'right', 'going', 'happen', 'attitude', 'expect', 'something', 'major', 'bad', 'happen', 'indeed', 'really', 'happens.Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'solid', 'not', 'significant', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'plot', 'performance', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'was', 'always', 'bad', 'actrice', 'even', 'previous', 'career', 'just', 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'par', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'short', 'movie', 'only', '81', 'min', 'titles', 'rolling', 'everything', 'could', 'have', 'developed', 'plot', 'lit', 'bit', 'more', 'really', 'wanted', 'think', 'run', 'blood', 'special', 'effects.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'hype', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'horror', 'fans', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'minimal', 'involve', 'lots', 'blood', 'more', 'blood', 'Nothing', 'special', 'Three', 'stars', 'overall', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'AnnaLynn', 'McCord', 'only']",N/A
