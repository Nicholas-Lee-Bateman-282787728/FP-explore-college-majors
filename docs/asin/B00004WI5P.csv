After watching this movie, and considering it OK watching fare, I found out there was an older version made back in the 1959. Now, I'm curious because my guess is the original version was probably even better? In this version we get some pretty decent acting except for two things that could have been improved.1. Bryan Brown. This guy always plays the same character in every role he portrays. Brash, grating on the nerves, pompous ""bloak"". It really is hard to watch a movie with Brown because you think he's a character from one of his other B-movies. Try and treat his acting as a minor nuisance and you might be able to enjoy the rest of the film.2. Assante's occasional slips into Al Pacino deliveries. On the whole, Armand does a fine job of acting the duty-bound submarine commander and also the troubled soul trying to keep himself together after personal loss. Intermittently he also seems to be doing an accent which I don't recall are natural to Assante's normal speaking voice. It's almost like the Aussies told him to ""act American"". I'm surprised he isn't wearing cowboy boots and the hat to go with it! There are even times when Armand slips into short Al Pacino-like monologues. Very strange because when he isn't so filled with convictions his performance is pretty darn good.The plot is interesting and the ironic twist in the middle of the picture is a jewel. Rachel Ward's portrayal of, Moira Davidson, is compelling to watch along with the supporting casts' performances. On the whole the movie is gloomy, and the storyline comes a bit too close to reality at times. It sends a thought-provoking shiver up one's spine. BRAVO for that in any movie.Pictures like these do have their silver lining of making the viewer give thanks for what they have and who they hold dear. I'd watch it again.",3,"Bryan Brown?!?!?

555375,AE7EQ5123M75T,B00004WI5P,a writer/reader/listener,"[46, 49]","Nevil Shute's On the Beach is the most haunting, terrifying, and depressing Cold War-era post-apocalyptic tale ever told, and with the 2000 production it has now been successfully translated to the screen not once, but twice. Both of the film versions retain the wrenching impact of the novel, and in many ways the new 2000 version does this better than either of the earlier efforts. **SPOILERS FOLLOW** For one thing, the longer, miniseries-style treatment lets the production develop the characters more fully than did the first film, especially their attachments to one another, so that when these attachments are inexorably ripped apart by the radioactivity, the viewer feels it all the more keenly. The final scene involving the Holmes family, superbly acted (to the point that, frankly, made me concerned for the mental welfare of the child actress), is nothing short of devastating. Even though I knew the story well from reading (and rereading) the novel and seeing the earlier film, this scene caught me unprepared for its sheer force and gave me a couple of sleepless nights. Another key to the newer film's effectiveness is the relative lack of squeamishness of the modern viewer, which allowed the producers to incorporate more of the grisly details of radiation sickness into the film's imagery. One of the new movie's most poignant scenes takes place when we see, through Julian Osborne's eyes, a queue of people waiting to receive their cyanide pills, and we catch a fleeting glimpse of a forlorn and pretty young woman as she vomits. The expression of shame and hopelessness on her face is priceless and (I'll use the word once again) wrenching. Still another element is the change to San Francisco; while the earlier versions have the city essentially undamaged (except by radiation), this version presents it as having taken a direct nuclear hit. The submarine crew's exclamations of horror-mingled despair as it sees a real-time through-the-periscope video of the collapsed Golden Gate Bridge and the ruins of the city  is one of the most important moments in a carefully-choreographed downward spiral. The production is good at giving hope and then slowly stealing it away, and the San Francisco viewing, along with the sudden reading of 150 rads off Anchorage (again, linked with the crew's explosive response) are the film's major turning points in this regard. The ""prayer scene"" near the end of the film shows sailors who are no longer U.S. naval personnel but walking ghosts; it is if they (and by extension we) have transformed from viewers to participants in the terrible drama that they once saw only through the periscope. Eschewing ""Waltzing Matilda"" (the running theme fore the first film), the producers opted for a more contemplative score (punctuated with some sinister themes during the submarine voyage) that moves near the film's ending to a heavily religious/choral style that resembles a dirge for mankind (which was no doubt the intension).The film does, of course, have its weaknesses. The biggest, for me, was Armand Assante's portrayal of Dwight Towers. Assante's Towers seems to be more of a cross between Rocky Balboa and a (stereo)typical Marine officer or senior noncom than a (stereo)typical naval officer. Perhaps the casting department was Australian and this was its idea of a (stereotypical) American nuclear warrior, but Assante's characterization just didn't ring right, especially compared to Gregory Peck's more equable portrayal (a word Shute uses to describe Towers more than once). Bryan Brown's Julian Osborne, too, is more harshly portrayed in this version than the earlier movie, and (I believe) the novel as well. On the other hand, Rachel Ward's portrayal of Moira Davidson is excellent, if perhaps a bit bitchier than the previous versions. Peter and Mary Holmes are likewise perfectly acted by Grant Bowler and Jacqueline McKenzie. McKenzie's almost waiflike Mary is exquisite; while watching her I found myself thinking that with her looks she would have made a perfect Elf in The Lord of the Rings.The other weaknesses were relatively minor and even nitpicking. Towers is a four-striper, a captain in navy rank, but several people (including naval officers) refer to him repeatedly as Commander even while looking at his shoulder boards. The long-dead corpse in Anchorage blinks a few times. Finally, the ending (which does for Shute's novel what My Fair Lady did for Shaw's Pygmalion, if not a weakness, is a definite change. It seems to offer a faint hope that love is stronger than death, which softens the sheer brutality of the film's ending sequences. I myself welcomed that softening, but others might not.All in all, this is probably the most profoundly disturbing film I've ever seen, including the previous version. It's also more disturbing even than the original novel. If you like an emotional tour de force this is it, but be prepared for what awaits you; this is not a film for the faint of heart.",5,"""Powerful"" isn't the word for it",1183852800,"07 8,

555376,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00004WI5P,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[28, 29]","It is easy to take potshots at a Made-for-Cable remake, particularly when the film remade is a cherished classic, such as 1959's 'On the Beach'. ""Armand Assante is no Gregory Peck"", ""Bryan Brown is no Fred Astaire"", ""Stanley Kramer made the point better, in black and white, in an hour less time""...These are the most frequent criticisms, and they certainly have merit!But if you take the time to watch this film, you'll find the 2000 version actually compares favorably with the original, and, in some ways, actually improves upon it. First, Australian actors are finally playing the Australian roles. This is not meant as a slap at Anthony Perkins, Ava Gardner, or Fred Astaire; Stanley Kramer casted easily-recognizable screen icons so he wouldn't have to spend much time developing character (Only Perkins has any real backstory in the film), but, by casting Americans, any Australian flavor is either diluted or caricatured. The remake is rich in character, with an authenticity that can't be faked.This carries over to the casting of Armand Assante as Commander Towers, as well. Gregory Peck was such a legend by the time the original was made, that his character, other than the lack of acceptance of his family's death, isn't explored; it is simply Peck playing Peck. Assante, bull-like and clearly in charge, is given several scenes demonstrating the love and loyalty he shares with his crew, explaining why his sense of duty has to take precedent over his new love with Moira (Rachel Ward) more effectively than Peck could. Assante is remarkably good in the role, as is Ward, taking Ava Gardner's role from the original.The remake takes a much harder-edged view of a civilization facing death. Riots and looting are commonplace, there is less comfort from religion, and authority is breaking down, piecemeal, throughout the country. Anti-U.S. sentiment, never exhibited in the original, is rampant, particularly when the U.S. submarine arrives in port. The ravages of nuclear holocaust are shown; San Francisco, which was inexplicably intact in the original, is here a shattered husk, twisted and crushed. Powerful images are frequent in the remake, and won't soon be forgotten.Not that the remake is without faults. The final Australian Grand Prix, Astaire's shining moment, is gone, as is his suicide by carbon monoxide, with a smile on his face, behind the wheel of his championship car (Brown's crashing through a billboard in his Ferrari just doesn't pack the same emotional wallop). Having Moira fantasize that Towers abandons his crew and returns to her at film's end lacks the poignancy of seeing a doomed Ava Gardner, standing alone beside her car, as she watches the sub, and her love, sail away to die. And I MISSED hearing 'Waltzing Matilda'!As anti-war statements, both versions deserve credit, and as a human story, full of joy, sorrow, and ultimate tragedy, 2000's 'On the Beach' certainly holds it's own with it's illustrious predecessor.It is a film worth having, in any collection!",4,Worthwhile Remake of 1959 Classic,1059782400,"08 2, 2003",2003,3009,"['easy', 'take', 'potshots', 'Made-for-Cable', 'remake', 'particularly', 'when', 'film', 'remade', 'cherished', 'classic', 'such', '1959', 'Beach', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'made', 'point', 'better', 'black', 'white', 'hour', 'less', 'time', 'are', 'most', 'frequent', 'criticisms', 'certainly', 'have', 'merit', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'find', '2000', 'version', 'actually', 'favorably', 'original', 'ways', 'actually', 'First', 'Australian', 'actors', 'are', 'finally', 'playing', 'Australian', 'roles', 'not', 'meant', 'slap', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'casted', 'easily-recognizable', 'screen', 'icons', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'developing', 'character', 'Only', 'Perkins', 'real', 'backstory', 'film', 'casting', 'Americans', 'Australian', 'flavor', 'either', 'diluted', 'caricatured', 'remake', 'rich', 'character', 'authenticity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faked.This', 'casting', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Commander', 'Towers', 'as', 'well', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'such', 'legend', 'time', 'original', 'was', 'made', 'character', 'other', 'lack', 'acceptance', 'family', 'death', ""n't"", 'explored', 'simply', 'Peck', 'playing', 'Peck', 'Assante', 'bull-like', 'clearly', 'charge', 'given', 'several', 'scenes', 'demonstrating', 'love', 'loyalty', 'shares', 'crew', 'explaining', 'why', 'sense', 'duty', 'take', 'precedent', 'new', 'love', 'Moira', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'more', 'effectively', 'Peck', 'could', 'Assante', 'remarkably', 'good', 'role', 'Ward', 'taking', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'role', 'original.The', 'remake', 'much', 'harder-edged', 'view', 'civilization', 'facing', 'death', 'Riots', 'looting', 'are', 'commonplace', 'less', 'comfort', 'religion', 'authority', 'breaking', 'down', 'piecemeal', 'country', 'Anti-U.S.', 'sentiment', 'never', 'exhibited', 'original', 'rampant', 'particularly', 'when', 'U.S.', 'submarine', 'port', 'ravages', 'nuclear', 'holocaust', 'are', 'shown', 'San', 'Francisco', 'was', 'inexplicably', 'intact', 'original', 'here', 'shattered', 'husk', 'twisted', 'crushed', 'Powerful', 'images', 'are', 'frequent', 'remake', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten.Not', 'remake', 'faults', 'final', 'Australian', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Astaire', 'shining', 'moment', 'gone', 'suicide', 'carbon', 'monoxide', 'smile', 'face', 'wheel', 'championship', 'car', 'Brown', 'crashing', 'billboard', 'Ferrari', 'just', ""n't"", 'pack', 'same', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'Having', 'Moira', 'fantasize', 'Towers', 'crew', 'returns', 'film', 'end', 'poignancy', 'seeing', 'doomed', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'standing', 'alone', 'beside', 'car', 'sub', 'love', 'sail', 'away', 'die', 'MISSED', 'hearing', ""'Waltzing"", 'Matilda', 'anti-war', 'statements', 'versions', 'deserve', 'credit', 'human', 'story', 'full', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'ultimate', 'tragedy', '2000', 'Beach', 'certainly', 'own', 'illustrious', 'predecessor.It', 'film', 'worth', 'having', 'collection']",N/A

Was to chicken to say that the war started by a third country with an other country's markings on the plane. (The purpose for our missile defense system.) The characters were modified to reflect today's politically correct characters. The government would never let this Dwight Towers near a sub. He cannot follow orders and thinks love is greater than his duty to his country or crew. Moira Davidson the young lady without direction is exchanged for Moira Davidson lush owner of a travel agency. Mary Holmes a demure housewife that can't look at the facts is exchanged for an architect that cannot look at the facts. The purpose of the story is lost in some sort of sci-fi thing.Yes, the book was written in the Cold War Era environment. However, I believe it is timeless. Someone else must think so or they would not have made an updated version for our not too distant future. Yet some characters are predictable. Even those character that change easily through some sort of epiphany can be predictable. The basic story is that Albania sends a plan with a major country's markings and we retaliate. However this is not a pacifist, (don't build bombs book). This is not a sci-fi book. It could be a speculative fiction or just speculative.The book On the Beach as most books is more complete in the characterization and description of the story. One the people is a cross of characters. The captain, Dwight Towers, is well trained and loyal to the U.S. to the end. He takes the sub out to international waters, as Australia is an ally, but not the U.S. Moira Davidson realizes that Dwight is married and helps him buy a pogo stick for the kid. She also decides to make something of herself by going to secretarial school. Others plan for next year.The audiocassette is unabridged and has the full impact of the book. The only drawback is if you listen to it on the way to work, everyone will notice that you are depressed.The movie On the Beach (1959) Stays fairly loyal to the feel, with a few minor changes. Some of the changes were necessary due to the difference in media. However, others were a little distracting. They used major stars that overshadowed the character that they were playing. Ava Gardner was just a tad old for the part of Moira Davidson.

This Hallmark-Showtime-Aussie production is a chilling update to the 1950's novel and film which is both different and alike.  The most difference is seen in Armand Assante's performance as Commander Towers.  Peck was a stiff New Englander almost afraid to weep and US Navy to the core--much like the novel.  Assante, on the other hand, allows more emotions into the character allowing the viewer to experience the horror that he feels as he comes to grips with the end of the world.  It also allows the film to end in a different way.  The film also allows viewers to see (unlike in the novel and the original film) that not all people will go down &quot;like gentlemen&quot;--there are looters, riots, and other acts that allow some of these people not to &quot;go gently&quot; into the long night.  This is more realistic and sensible--you never saw the rage of the people in the novel and the first version.  The idea that the people of the southern hemisphere would just accept the idea that the US and China had destroyed the world without some rage doesn't make--at least to me--sense.  The cast is great and it is always nice to see Bryan Brown team up with Rachel (Mrs. Brown) Ward.  The only nitpicking that I might point out is that certain American characters have rather loud Aussie accents which certain viewers might have trouble accepting.  This is a new version of probably the best novel ever written of the logical end of a nuclear war--the end of humanity.  It can stand toe-to-toe with the original novel and movie and, above all, it makes &quot;The Day After,&quot; which is too often touted as a good nuclear war film , seem a soap opera in compatison.",4,Makes &quot;The Day After&quot; seem like a soap opera,979689600,"01 17, 2001",2001,1840,"['Ever', 'was', 'child', 'have', 'been', 'haunted', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'quot', 'Beach', 'quot', 'novel', 'wonderful', 'B', 'amp', 'W', 'version', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Hallmark-Showtime-Aussie', 'production', 'chilling', 'update', '1950', 'novel', 'film', 'different', 'alike', 'most', 'difference', 'seen', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'performance', 'Commander', 'Towers', 'Peck', 'was', 'stiff', 'New', 'Englander', 'almost', 'afraid', 'weep', 'US', 'Navy', 'core', 'much', 'novel', 'Assante', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'emotions', 'character', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'experience', 'horror', 'grips', 'end', 'world', 'also', 'film', 'end', 'different', 'way', 'film', 'also', 'viewers', 'see', 'novel', 'original', 'film', 'not', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'quot', 'gentlemen', 'quot', 'are', 'looters', 'riots', 'other', 'acts', 'allow', 'people', 'not', 'quot', 'go', 'gently', 'quot', 'long', 'night', 'more', 'realistic', 'sensible', 'never', 'saw', 'rage', 'people', 'novel', 'first', 'version', 'idea', 'people', 'southern', 'hemisphere', 'would', 'just', 'accept', 'idea', 'US', 'China', 'had', 'destroyed', 'world', 'rage', ""n't"", 'make', 'least', 'sense', 'cast', 'great', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'team', 'up', 'Rachel', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'Ward', 'only', 'nitpicking', 'might', 'point', 'out', 'certain', 'American', 'characters', 'have', 'rather', 'loud', 'Aussie', 'accents', 'certain', 'viewers', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'new', 'version', 'probably', 'best', 'novel', 'ever', 'written', 'logical', 'end', 'nuclear', 'war', 'end', 'humanity', 'can', 'stand', 'toe-to-toe', 'original', 'novel', 'movie', 'quot', 'Day', 'quot', 'too', 'often', 'touted', 'good', 'nuclear', 'war', 'film', 'seem', 'soap', 'opera', 'compatison']",N/A

Stanley Kramer mercifully kept the polemics to a bare minimum and instead focused on the strengths of people facing the end of the world with quiet dignity.This abysmal remake is a different kettle entirely.  Number one, we are served up a mega dose of political correctness that blames America for a nuclear war with China because (horror of horrors) we didn't appease the Communist Chinese who were blockading Taiwan.  How nice to see that the Blame America First crowd is still alive and well after all these years.Number two, the cast is awful and can't hold a candle to the likes of Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred Astaire.  Armand Assante, in Peck's role as Captain Dwight Towers, is woefully miscast (not coming across as a bona fide American for a minute) and in contrast to the quiet strength, dignity and honor projected by Peck, is an unstable, neurotic, immature fool who elicits not one whit of sympathy from me.  Even worse is the insufferably arrogant Bryan Brown in Astaire's old role.  In the name of &quot;realism&quot; the character has acquired quite a potty mouth.  The dignity and gentleness of the characters in the original was what made you weep for the end of humanity because we saw how senseless destruction had eliminated so much that was good and full of promise.  By contrast, the people of the remake make you feel as though you might as well say good riddance to the human race if this is emblematic of what's left.This is a living example of why the best movie ideas are best left alone by pompous filmmakers who think they can somehow be more effective in a remake by being more &quot;realistic.&quot;  In the first place, the entire premise of &quot;On The Beach&quot; isn't even realistic to begin with so what seems like &quot;realistic&quot; behavior in this remake only comes off as pretentious, pompous and hopelessly inane.

555386,A26HFSVLAGULIM,B00004WI5P,"Heather L. Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[9, 11]","THE RE-MAKE OF ""ON THE BEACH""This film though very similar to the original 1959 version is modernized and due to its extended length allows for the much needed characterizations.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT:The film begins on the Australian coast after THE END, for most of the rest of the world. The American Nuclear submarine with Armand Assante at the helm as Captain Dwight Towers, surfaces and is promptly greeted by angry beer-can tossing Aussie boaters. Basically, this is the high point of hope for the characters in this film, as there are no friendly ports left alive on the Earth for our home-sick submariners.However, the focus of the film is not on the submariners or the war as both are basically finished. Instead, Captain Towers is the focal point, and his odyssey has only begun. But this is a world where everyone is an orphan or will be and Towers is no exception, as his wife and children are gone. Everyone outside of Australia is gone!In the course of a last mission for hope, Towers meets Rachel Ward who plays Moira Davidson, on his brief respite at his Austalian naval liason's home. This introduces the human element to the trajedy of global thermonuclear warfare, as we see people, real people, from many walks of life on there way to final total despair.A LAST CHANCE - - - MAYBE????BUT . . . There is a last ditch mission of hope for the soon to be doomed Austalian survivors, and that is where the tension comes from, as we await humankinds verdict. It is one last mission for the sub and its crew who now includes Bryan Brown as scientist Julian Osborne and the Aussie naval liason officer. It will take a month, and no one will know the outcome until the submarine checks things out in Alaska, which is quite a trek from Melbourne, Austalia, and then returns. That's what ""ON THE BEACH"" is all about! THE VERDICT,  and how humankind in general and these people specifically deal with the inevitable and all that comes with it.POWER OF THE FILM AND TOPIC:Like many others, I found myself thinking constantly about what I would do if I were this character or that. My mind jumped about quite a bit from character to character trying on each one's unique but identical set of issues and problems. Removed as I was, I tried to resolve the situation for many of them, without any satisfactory results. Sadly, that's it in a nutshell. This is an anti-war saga which tells its story by showing for the most part rather than telling, which makes it quite powerful as an instigator of emotional responses in most people, including myself.OTHER RECOMMENDED FILMS:This is an excellent though disturbing film along the lines of, ""Testament"", ""The Day After"", ""By Dawn Early Light"" and many others, but the scope and focus of this film is entirely unique, just like the excellent but too short original ""On The Beach"" from 1959. It seems as though if ""7 DAYS IN MAY"" by John Frankenheimer were a true story, and ended with a military coup, this version of ""ON THE BEACH"" may have been the real-life sequel to it. This is very powerful, gut-wrenching fiction, so be in the right frame of mind for it when you see it.ABOUT THE DVD:Okay, it has no features whatsoever, but the transfer was fine and widescreen, which makes it a welcome improvement over the old VHS.",5,BEGINS AFTER THE END FOR MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,3272,"['RE-MAKE', 'OF', 'ON', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'film', 'very', 'similar', 'original', '1959', 'version', 'modernized', 'due', 'extended', 'length', 'much', 'needed', 'characterizations.WHAT', 'IT', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'film', 'Australian', 'coast', 'THE', 'END', 'most', 'rest', 'world', 'American', 'Nuclear', 'submarine', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'helm', 'Captain', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'surfaces', 'promptly', 'greeted', 'angry', 'beer-can', 'tossing', 'Aussie', 'boaters', 'Basically', 'high', 'point', 'hope', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'friendly', 'ports', 'left', 'alive', 'Earth', 'home-sick', 'submariners.However', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'submariners', 'war', 'are', 'basically', 'finished', 'Instead', 'Captain', 'Towers', 'focal', 'point', 'odyssey', 'only', 'begun', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'orphan', 'will', 'be', 'Towers', 'exception', 'wife', 'children', 'are', 'gone', 'Everyone', 'Australia', 'gone', 'course', 'last', 'mission', 'hope', 'Towers', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'who', 'Moira', 'Davidson', 'brief', 'respite', 'Austalian', 'naval', 'liason', 'home', 'human', 'element', 'trajedy', 'global', 'thermonuclear', 'warfare', 'see', 'people', 'real', 'people', 'many', 'walks', 'life', 'way', 'final', 'total', 'despair.A', 'LAST', 'CHANCE', 'MAYBE', 'BUT', 'last', 'ditch', 'mission', 'hope', 'soon', 'be', 'doomed', 'Austalian', 'survivors', 'where', 'tension', 'await', 'humankinds', 'verdict', 'one', 'last', 'mission', 'sub', 'crew', 'who', 'now', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'scientist', 'Julian', 'Osborne', 'Aussie', 'naval', 'liason', 'officer', 'will', 'take', 'month', 'one', 'will', 'know', 'outcome', 'submarine', 'checks', 'things', 'out', 'Alaska', 'quite', 'trek', 'Melbourne', 'Austalia', 'then', 'returns', 'what', 'ON', 'BEACH', 'THE', 'VERDICT', 'how', 'humankind', 'general', 'people', 'specifically', 'deal', 'inevitable', 'it.POWER', 'THE', 'FILM', 'AND', 'TOPIC', 'many', 'others', 'found', 'thinking', 'constantly', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'character', 'mind', 'jumped', 'quite', 'bit', 'character', 'character', 'trying', 'one', 'unique', 'identical', 'set', 'issues', 'problems', 'Removed', 'was', 'tried', 'resolve', 'situation', 'many', 'satisfactory', 'results', 'Sadly', 'nutshell', 'anti-war', 'saga', 'story', 'showing', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'telling', 'quite', 'powerful', 'instigator', 'emotional', 'responses', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'myself.OTHER', 'RECOMMENDED', 'FILMS', 'excellent', 'disturbing', 'film', 'lines', 'Testament', 'Day', 'Dawn', 'Early', 'Light', 'many', 'others', 'scope', 'focus', 'film', 'entirely', 'unique', 'just', 'excellent', 'too', 'short', 'original', 'Beach', '1959', '7', 'DAYS', 'IN', 'MAY', 'John', 'Frankenheimer', 'were', 'true', 'story', 'ended', 'military', 'coup', 'version', 'ON', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'real-life', 'sequel', 'very', 'powerful', 'gut-wrenching', 'fiction', 'so', 'be', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'when', 'see', 'it.ABOUT', 'THE', 'DVD', 'Okay', 'features', 'whatsoever', 'transfer', 'was', 'fine', 'widescreen', 'welcome', 'improvement', 'old', 'VHS']",N/A
555387,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00004WI5P,Jason,"[41, 47]","In this brutally long (the DVD I received was 3+ hours, not 109 minutes as listed) mockery of Nevil Shute's book, it's pretty clear the makers of the movie were being overly ambitious and motive-driven with their interpretation of a contemporary outlook.  But first, the story...The story is fairly simple. It's the end of the world, a catastrophic condition of post-nuclear war.  The last people left alive are in the Southern hemisphere, specifically Australia and New Zealand.  These people have the unfortunate knowledge of their impending doom, as radioactive fallout insidiously drifts towards them.As for the interpretation, there was simply too much being force-fed into the script, especially when so much of the original intention of civility and purity in the face of danger was being capriciously ignored.  The subtle messages of introspection are lost amidst the anti-military, anti-American messages permeating throughout - perhaps the influence of political correctness.  I despise movies that take a book's name and then drastically deviate.  Take a few liberties; just don't stomp on Nevil Shute's grave.There are too many aspects of the movie that went astray, but for starters:-The wrong people go ashore for the mystery signal mission.  Originally it was one person, not two, and it surely wasn't the commander and his second-in-command.  (What is this?  Star Trek?)-Peter and Mary Holmes' have a baby, not a toddler.  (I guess it was too difficult to keep an infant quiet?)-Osborne does not commit suicide on the race-track, nor does he resist the efforts of helping his country/mankind.  (This was a forced attempt to make his character live up to the ""wild"" persona created for this movie for no other reason than to give Bryan Brown character focus.)There are two worse travesties that make this movie abhorrent.First, Dwight Towers is completely wrong.  In the book he's well trained and loyal to the U.S. - death before dishonor. He is a composed, strict, by-the-book military leader.  In fact, in the book he goes so far as to sink the sub in international waters, and drown himself in the process, just so it's not in another country's hands.  This movie's interpretation, however, has Dwight as a temperamental, raging, high-strung lunatic struggling too much with his memories and hallucinations, having an emotional breakdown during the mission ashore.  Not only that, but according to this contradiction, he contravenes direct orders and shows a complete lack of military discipline, which would never have happened.The worst travesty of this movie, however, is the unnecessary love-triangle, and ridiculous relationship struggles between Cmdr. Dwight Towers (Assante), Moira (Ward), and Osborne (Brown).  First of all, Moira is a completely drunken whore.  Whereas in the book she actually comes to terms with her eventual death, realizing the errors of her past loose ways, in this version she remains bitter and slutty until the very end.  Not only does she sleep with Osborne, but she also beds Dwight.  This completely ruins the original intentions, losing the innocence of their relationship that can never be.  Part of the book's message is about enjoying and understanding company during the last days without resorting to pure hedonism.  Aside from that, there is absolutely no romantic chemistry between Dwight and Moira, or Osborne and Moira for that matter.  (There may have been a tense, prison-like chemistry between Dwight and Osborne, however)There are several other portions of this movie that are atrocious (i.e. mid-movie credits, ridiculous submarine dance scene), and the makers of the movie should feel ashamed at the hatchet-job rework they did with this literary masterpiece.",2,Not really on the beach,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,3731,"['brutally', 'long', 'DVD', 'received', 'was', '3+', 'hours', 'not', '109', 'minutes', 'listed', 'mockery', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'book', 'pretty', 'clear', 'makers', 'movie', 'were', 'being', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'motive-driven', 'interpretation', 'contemporary', 'outlook', 'first', 'story', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'end', 'world', 'catastrophic', 'condition', 'post-nuclear', 'war', 'last', 'people', 'left', 'alive', 'are', 'Southern', 'hemisphere', 'specifically', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'people', 'have', 'unfortunate', 'knowledge', 'impending', 'doom', 'radioactive', 'fallout', 'insidiously', 'drifts', 'towards', 'them.As', 'interpretation', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'being', 'force-fed', 'script', 'especially', 'when', 'so', 'much', 'original', 'intention', 'civility', 'purity', 'face', 'danger', 'was', 'being', 'capriciously', 'ignored', 'subtle', 'messages', 'introspection', 'are', 'lost', 'anti-military', 'anti-American', 'messages', 'permeating', 'perhaps', 'influence', 'political', 'correctness', 'despise', 'movies', 'take', 'book', 'name', 'then', 'drastically', 'deviate', 'Take', 'few', 'liberties', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stomp', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'grave.There', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'aspects', 'movie', 'went', 'astray', 'starters', '-The', 'wrong', 'people', 'go', 'ashore', 'mystery', 'signal', 'mission', 'Originally', 'was', 'one', 'person', 'not', 'two', 'surely', 'was', ""n't"", 'commander', 'second-in-command', 'What', 'Star', 'Trek', '-Peter', 'Mary', 'Holmes', 'have', 'baby', 'not', 'toddler', 'guess', 'was', 'too', 'difficult', 'keep', 'infant', 'quiet', '-Osborne', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', 'race-track', 'resist', 'efforts', 'helping', 'country/mankind', 'was', 'forced', 'attempt', 'make', 'character', 'live', 'up', 'wild', 'persona', 'created', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'give', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'character', 'focus', 'are', 'two', 'worse', 'travesties', 'make', 'movie', 'abhorrent.First', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'completely', 'wrong', 'book', 'well', 'trained', 'loyal', 'U.S.', 'death', 'dishonor', 'composed', 'strict', 'by-the-book', 'military', 'leader', 'fact', 'book', 'so', 'far', 'sink', 'sub', 'international', 'waters', 'drown', 'process', 'just', 'not', 'country', 'hands', 'movie', 'interpretation', 'however', 'Dwight', 'temperamental', 'raging', 'high-strung', 'lunatic', 'struggling', 'too', 'much', 'memories', 'hallucinations', 'having', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'mission', 'ashore', 'Not', 'only', 'according', 'contradiction', 'direct', 'orders', 'complete', 'lack', 'military', 'discipline', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened.The', 'worst', 'travesty', 'movie', 'however', 'unnecessary', 'love-triangle', 'ridiculous', 'relationship', 'Cmdr', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'Assante', 'Moira', 'Ward', 'Osborne', 'Brown', 'First', 'Moira', 'completely', 'drunken', 'whore', 'Whereas', 'book', 'actually', 'terms', 'eventual', 'death', 'realizing', 'errors', 'past', 'loose', 'ways', 'version', 'bitter', 'slutty', 'very', 'end', 'Not', 'only', 'sleep', 'Osborne', 'also', 'beds', 'Dwight', 'completely', 'original', 'intentions', 'losing', 'innocence', 'relationship', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'Part', 'book', 'message', 'enjoying', 'understanding', 'company', 'last', 'days', 'resorting', 'pure', 'hedonism', 'Aside', 'absolutely', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'Dwight', 'Moira', 'Osborne', 'Moira', 'matter', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'tense', 'prison-like', 'chemistry', 'Dwight', 'Osborne', 'however', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'portions', 'movie', 'are', 'atrocious', 'i.e', 'mid-movie', 'credits', 'ridiculous', 'submarine', 'dance', 'scene', 'makers', 'movie', 'should', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'hatchet-job', 'rework', 'did', 'literary', 'masterpiece']",N/A

The part of the submarine commander played by Armand Assante was the most interesting and entertaining role in the film.  Assante did a great job in an unusual role!The story takes some slightly different turns than the original movie but still basically told the same depresssing but very engaging tale of an extremely moral US submarine commander who takes his duty to the country and his family very seriously. The movie tells the story of his encounters with various people in Australia who blamed the US for the war and its ultimate outcome. He always stood up for his country and shared with almost no one what to him was probably a dark secret.As an aside which I can't help but comment on, the sets of the submarine were excellent and looked really credible. The special effects were also very well done.

555389,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B00004WI5P,Kendra,"[6, 6]","I read Nevil Shute's book several years ago and thought it amazing. Recently, when culling some books from my bookshelves, I re-read it once again one afternoon. When I read the book the first time, I didn't even know of this classic film. However, I had learned of it since I reading the book the last time, so I ordered this film and, of course, the classic with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner.The cast here was wonderful. The only exception to this was Armand Assante's performance here. I used to think Assante was superb- an underrated wonderful actor I didn't get to see too much.  Here, though, he sounded an awful lot like Rocky Balboa.  I guess that's okay-- I mean, there are Submarine Commanders that can sound like Rocky Balboa but, sometimes, it was off-putting. Other than that, he was good and still very likable.Rachel Ward's performance was good. I think her character was probably the most difficult to play (as was Ava Gardner's in the first movie).  Her character had to be brash, wild, remorseful, drunk, sad, smart, lonely, and regretful while still remaining empathetic.  She did succeed but, like Ava Gardner before her, I found myself critiquing her performance rather than getting completely lost in the movie.  Still, she did do a very good job and never went over the edge into parody (which could have been easy to do).The young Australian couple (Mark Pennell and a young woman whose name escapes me) were perfect. They played their roles with remarkable depth and were probably the best of the bunch.The story is truly staggering. Taking place in Australia, the citizens are the last known society waiting for imminent death by radioactive fallout which is slowly moving across the earth. Everyone else is dead and they, too, will be dead soon. This film is about how this small group of people spend their last months.(Shute's book is not perfectly written. I remember he calls the baby ""it"" so many times it was a bit disturbing. Parents don't refer to the baby as ""it"" too many times after he or she is born! However, certain characters and the story itself are so memorable, despite the book's flaws, that it is a must-read.)This movie is wholeheartedly recommended.  Especially if you are sharing it with your (older) children, I think they'd be more interested in this version than the older one. There are little changes from the book to the movie that seem to work here but were truly astounding in the book.  The most important change, I think, is how Captain Towers dealt with his family's believed demise.  In the book, Towers spoke of them as if they were still alive-- so horrid was the consideration of anything else.  Moira, towards the end, found purpose in helping him perpetuate this belief and found the purpose she was looking for in doing this.  Here, though, Captain Towers deals with it a bit more realistically.  The choice the filmmakers made here was the weaker choice, in my opinion.They did make some good choices, too, though- a lot of them.  In this film, we see the cast members getting sick (with the notable exception of Assante's and Ward's characters-- they still look like movie stars).  And, it works here. It's not so we get disgusted. It works on a human level-- not as a special effects ""gross out"".  We are supposed to be appalled at what radiation can do and we are.  Additionally, we see more city scenes-- how the city is changing over the last few months-- we see a quite civilized society change as the end nears. This definitely makes what's happening more believable.Some people may take issue with the major ending change for Captain Towers and Moira. I do, too, I guess. But, I do think this ending is more believable than the book's ending and is a teeny bit of brightness in an otherwise totally horrific situation.I wound up watching both this movie and the original within the same two weeks. Honestly, this film was better with the exception of Armand Assante's performance (which was good, but not of Peck's caliber.). Both are worth seeing.

555390,A38PE6E0EPXV3,B00004WI5P,"K. King ""musicluvr""","[4, 6]","Okay, where to start! This move was a BIG, and I do mean BIG disappointment! Nevil Shute would be rolling in his grave if he saw what a fine mess they made of his classic story. There was no need for improvement (of Shute's novel). I can understand modernizing the story, to create a greater impact on today's audience, but this was ridiculous! Only remnants of the original story are present. It says &quot;based on the novel by Nevil Shute,&quot; but rather, it should have said &quot;the screenwriter simply borrowed Shute's premise, and generated his own story!&quot; Utter tripe! Plain and simply, a travesty of novel adaptation. The nuances of Nevil's book that lent it charm and effectiveness were completely lacking in the movie. I felt little for the characters, as there was no true development. We see a peek here and there of each person, and with the exception of Peter, I didn't like ANY of them! It's not supposed to be like that! If we take a peek at the book, we find that Commander Towers is an overwhelmingly faithful man who pledges his life to his wife and country, to the very end. He could not fathom being with another woman. But, in the movie, what do we have? Torrid love affairs, innuendoes galore, and a Commander who seems to get past that &quot;spot in {his} brain&quot; awful easy! There was no struggle to come to terms with the fact that his family is gone, as in the novel AND the 1959 version. No, instead they just portray Dwight as a much more unscrupulous fellow than in the book. It's not just that, though. The character of Dwight Towers is a noble one, in the book. He has depth, character, feeling, and a soft touch with people. Not so, in this movie. I wanted to smack Armand's character so many times, I was annoyed. He was a boisterous, obnoxious, and blunt captain, and nothing like the original character. I didn't care for him at all. I even like Armand, but his acting was part of it. He craned his neck too much, talked with his lips pursed together, and generally looked like he was sucking a lemon throughout. NOT his best work! Let's see, what else? There are so many things! If you've read this far and are intrigued, I'll tell you more! The character of Julian Osborne (who was actually &quot;John Seymour Osborne&quot; in the book) was never on an island. I have yet to figure out what that had to do with anything!Moira was NOT related to anyone in the story, and in fact lived with her parents on a farm. The race scene in the book was completely alleviated, although there is a hint of it in the end. The way &quot;Julian&quot; died in the film was MUCH different from the book, and I thought this was a big mistake. The book's portrayal was a very poignant telling, and should have been included. If you haven't had the honor of reading it, it may be tough to understand, but let's just say it was a much more powerful scene. The scenes in the streets were not in the novel, other than the garbage. The rioting, violence, sex, and so forth, are a figment of the screenwriter's imagination. I don't think it added anything. I guess they felt like they had to have violence and hatefulness somewhere.The helicopter in the film complicated things, and made the story even MORE different. It wasn't necessary either. In fact, because of its inclusion, the departure scene had to be changed. Not NEARLY as effective!And of course, the big kicker that angered me more than anything else? The fact that they changed the ending!!!!!! What's up with that?! Wasn't Nevil Shute's version good enough, or was it &quot;too outdated?!&quot; How lame is that?! HELLO! I know I keep talking about &quot;the book said this,&quot; or &quot;the book had that,&quot; but I'm tellin' ya'... the ending of the book almost made me cry, while this made me think &quot;Good riddance!&quot; It was SO insipid! Nothing like the power the book had. NOTHING! It was a bad move on the part of the filmmakers. If nothing else, they could have salvaged the ending and made at least THAT scene a poignant one. It's not that I am basing my review solely on comparison with the book; it's just that it's not even a good film. When I do think back to the book, or even the old movie, this movie just stinks! It doesn't have the potency of either. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't be so harsh. I have to compare just for the simple fact that this movie is supposed to be based on it. I'll tell you that if you see this movie, you have no idea what the original story was. Very little of Nevil Shute's ideas exist. I know; you can't include everything from the book, in a movie. But, you'd think they could include SOME of it! Sheesh! The 2 hour, 1959 version with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner was FAR more accurate in its portrayal, than this! They had 4 hours to do this movie justice, and instead chose to make it meaningless drivel!",1,What happened?

The plot variations almost have me curious enough about the written page to buy and read the novel.  *Almost!* &lt;lol>This remake is undoubtedly more realistic in its portrayal of what might really happen when people realise that the end is inevitable.

555392,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00004WI5P,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[3, 3]","For those who come to the 2000 version of ON THE BEACH after having read the novel by Nevil Shute and seeing the earlier version with Gregory Peck as the lead will find the remake closer to the book than the original film. Shute's novel of a post-nuclear Australia awaiting slow death by radiation is a desensitizing experience.  Not only is the topic one to give the reader pause but his literary style in its deadening prose emphasizes that we had better start thinking about the unthinkable before it is too late.  The 1959 film focuses on the stiff upper lip quality that America likes to think is hardwired into the British DNA as the Australians go about their Last Day business with o so coolness.  Here, director Russell Mulcachy depicts a Down Under that is probably more realistic than either the novel or the first film.  As most Australians realize that the radiation that has wiped out the entire Northern latitudes is inexorably drifting southward civil order and hence morality begins to dissipate.  We see scenes of citizens heading toward Melbourne in human tidal waves, overcoming the ability of the government to feed and clothe them.  We see scenes of looting, rioting, and civil disorder.  We even see a heart-rending scene in which one man deliberately drives his car filled with his children over a cliff.  What we do not see is much about the WHY of all this.  There are a few minutes of flashbacks to indicate that hostilities began when China blockaded Taiwan, forcing the United States to intervene.  The majority of ON THE BEACH deals with how three lives interact.  Armand Assante is an American nuclear sub commander who has orders to deliver Bryan Brown to the central government.  Rachel Ward (Brown's real life wife) is his jilted ex-fiance who begins a romance with Assante who still mourns the loss of his own family.  The film suggests that it is better for the government to hide a bitter truth even when it knows that the public is quite well aware of that truth.  The 1959 film begins and ends with a street corner fanatic preaching under a banner that reads ""There is Still Time.""  This banner is present too but only once at the beginning, thus muting the impact that there may not be time.  A number of viewers have complained that the ending simply cuts the film off without any satisfying resolution, but that may be the point.  Nuclear armaggeddon is so soul-crunching in its finality that viewer satisfaction is probably the last thing that director Mulcahy wanted to leave that viewer with.",4,There Is Still Time,1251504000,"08 29, 2009",2009,2537,"['who', 'come', '2000', 'version', 'ON', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'having', 'read', 'novel', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'seeing', 'earlier', 'version', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'lead', 'will', 'find', 'remake', 'closer', 'book', 'original', 'film', 'Shute', 'novel', 'post-nuclear', 'Australia', 'awaiting', 'slow', 'death', 'radiation', 'desensitizing', 'experience', 'Not', 'only', 'topic', 'one', 'give', 'reader', 'pause', 'literary', 'style', 'deadening', 'prose', 'emphasizes', 'had', 'better', 'start', 'thinking', 'unthinkable', 'too', 'late', '1959', 'film', 'focuses', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'quality', 'America', 'think', 'hardwired', 'British', 'DNA', 'Australians', 'go', 'Last', 'Day', 'business', 'o', 'so', 'coolness', 'Here', 'director', 'Russell', 'Mulcachy', 'Down', 'probably', 'more', 'realistic', 'novel', 'first', 'film', 'most', 'Australians', 'realize', 'radiation', 'wiped', 'out', 'entire', 'Northern', 'latitudes', 'inexorably', 'drifting', 'southward', 'civil', 'order', 'hence', 'morality', 'dissipate', 'see', 'scenes', 'citizens', 'heading', 'Melbourne', 'human', 'tidal', 'waves', 'overcoming', 'ability', 'government', 'feed', 'clothe', 'see', 'scenes', 'looting', 'rioting', 'civil', 'disorder', 'even', 'see', 'heart-rending', 'scene', 'one', 'man', 'deliberately', 'car', 'filled', 'children', 'cliff', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'WHY', 'are', 'few', 'minutes', 'flashbacks', 'indicate', 'hostilities', 'began', 'when', 'China', 'blockaded', 'Taiwan', 'forcing', 'United', 'States', 'intervene', 'majority', 'ON', 'THE', 'BEACH', 'deals', 'how', 'three', 'interact', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'American', 'nuclear', 'sub', 'commander', 'who', 'orders', 'deliver', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'central', 'government', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Brown', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'jilted', 'ex-fiance', 'who', 'romance', 'Assante', 'who', 'still', 'loss', 'own', 'family', 'film', 'better', 'government', 'hide', 'bitter', 'truth', 'even', 'when', 'public', 'quite', 'well', 'aware', 'truth', '1959', 'film', 'begins', 'street', 'corner', 'fanatic', 'preaching', 'banner', 'Still', 'Time', 'banner', 'present', 'too', 'only', 'once', 'beginning', 'thus', 'muting', 'impact', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'time', 'number', 'viewers', 'have', 'complained', 'ending', 'simply', 'film', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'may', 'be', 'point', 'Nuclear', 'armaggeddon', 'so', 'soul-crunching', 'finality', 'viewer', 'satisfaction', 'probably', 'last', 'thing', 'director', 'Mulcahy', 'wanted', 'leave', 'viewer']",N/A
555393,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00004WI5P,Matthew Horner,"[11, 12]","""On the Beach"" is effective as melodrama and as a tearjerker, but as a movie about the apocalypse, it disappoints. It is based on the Nevil Shute novel and on the 1959 film version [screenplay by John Paxton], which stars Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire.The year is 2006. America and China have fought a nuclear war over China's invasion of Taiwan. The radiation fallout has wiped out all of the earth's human population with the exception of Australia. [For some reason, that country's next door neighbor, New Zealand, is never mention.] When the fallout reaches Australia, life as we know it will cease to exist. A lone American nuclear sub has somehow survived, and it heads to Oz, where some scientists have concluded that the fallout is receding rapidly near Alaska. This theory raises the possibility that a select few people can be taken north, ensuring the survival of the human race. The American sub is chosen as the vessel which will venture to Alaska to see if the theory is correct.Neither Armand Assante as Capt. Dwight Tower nor Bryan Brown as the scientist Julian Osborne can hold a candle to Peck and Astaire in the original, which was directed by Stanley Kramer. Jacqueline McKenzie and Grant Bowler, though, are quite effective as the very much in love young couple, Mary and Peter Holmes. But it is Rachel Ward as Moira Davidson who dominates the movie. She is the one player who seems fully to grasp the awful finality of the story. Her character displays a love of life and zest for it that make her plight [and all of mankind's] unbearably tragic. Ward was also smart enough to openly emulate Ava Gardner's remarkable performance in the original.The 1959 version had three things going for it: a great cast, a director who focused on social issues, and a period in history where the likelihood of a nuclear holocaust seemed high. The new version, made in 2000, seems tame and unconvincing by comparison. Yes, what happens to the characters is sad, and you'd have to be pretty jaded not to shed a tear or two for them. But the movie fails to make its story very plausible. Much of it plays like a standard action-adventure film. Superior movies about the end of civilization include ""Testament"", ""The Day After"" and my personal favorite, ""The Rapture"". These are available on VHS only.

Dalton ""big-dummy""","[7, 15]","The end of humanity is a pretty compelling theme, the end coming as a result of Nuclear War is something we really ought to be thinking about given some current events (rekindling of the Cold War for example).  It also has is a compelling hook for those who secretly yearn for the downfall of modern 'civilization' and the chance to return to a simpler more primal type of life.There have been some half- good attempts to take a serious look at THE END, the Day After comes to mind, along with more campy variations ala Logans Run, Omega Man, Mad Max, Escape from New York etc.This one started out interesting, there was a fairly solid cast for a lower budget TV film, the sets were somewhat convincing (looks like they let them shoot on a real Sub) but this was really squandered and turned into being all about what was essentially an ego trip for this middle aged woman.  She looked so happy when she first thought Capitan Assante was coming to hang out with her (to slowly die of radiation poisoning or commit murder-suicide together) you would think the entire race of humanity wasn't doomed along with herself.  In the last scene she is bitterly toasting the captain for going out to sea to die with his men (who all have radiation poisoning) she's delighted when he shows up in his  dress whites, the end is sort of a pathological zinfindel commercial.  And an ode to self-absorption on a colossal scale...The scenario though is a really interesting one.  If you had a nuclear submarine, you would probably be able to avoid the radiation.  All you would actually need is food.  You could surface and check satellite data on what areas were 'hot' (if the satellites were still functioning) it would be an interesting game of being able to stand being cooped up in the sub long enough for some of the radiation to dissipate until you could surface somewhere  Animals live on the site of Chernobyl and all over Bikini Atol so nature does revive, even if the infection of man has been scourged from the planet.  Fun for everyone else to start over again, much the same appeal here of Zombie movies.

The movie which was initially created as a 3.5 TV Mini-Series and was nominated for Golden Globe - which would have been well deserved - is a joint Australian and American production that has all the good and bad parts of what makes us human in the movie. This movie is the best movie I have watched to date. I first watched 'On The Beach' on Australian television with my mum and step-dad and this movie touched me in a way no other movie has ever. Everything about this movie is brilliant. It's a movie that doesn't have a happy ending and a movie that makes the viewer think. The integral message and the theme of the movie is anti nuclear and poses many interesting self requesting questions like ""How would I react to this situation or ""What would I do if I knew I had a short period of life left?""Bryan Brown who plays Julian Osborne a scientist is a great Australian actor who is well established and has great acting skill and polishes off this performance with pure excellence. His acting is superb.Rachel Ward another great Australian actress plays Moira Davidson and is a show stealer...she has such a aplomb on the screen and her character goes through so many changes and emotions through the movie.But my favourite character is Commander Dwight Towers who is played by Armand Assante who is such an accomplished actor and plays the role of the head actor with so much emotion. Two other Australian actors also have big roles in the movie and are secondary characters to the three mentioned. All up through and through, the acting is excellent and the casting has been well picked.The movie is long and to completely and fully tell the story of a world winding down and a civilization falling apart as well as tell the stories of each character and their interactions together and to the situation on hand the length of the movie was warranted.'On The Beach' is adapted from Neville Shute's novel and is directed to the screen by Russel Mulcahy.

Usually remakes fail by trying to improve on what was already great in the original and getting it wrong. This one I think succeeded because it preserved what worked in the original, and brought more to the table in ways the original could not, due to the constraints of the day.  It is lengthier, for one, and being in color, it takes advantage in giving us great views. The score was a little more involved too, though I missed Waltzing Matilda.Castwise, I think they improved on Mary and her husband, who are both much more warm and likable than the original cast. On the other hand, the doctor and his girlfriend (orig played by Fred Astaire and Ava Gardner, are replaced with regrettable actors, both appearing a little too hard bitten. The rest of the cast is competent.One thing missing from this movie is that in the original, everyone went very much with British Phlem, i.e., pretty much a stiff upper lip and a lot of decorum.

I feel it was at least as good as the original, albeit some special effects are poorly done.But not as poorly done as the DVD transfer. I've never seemnas many gross digital artifacts as I have on this DVD. It appears that the entire 3.5 hour movie was transferred to a single-layer DVD-5 disk. Rapid motion or quick changes of scenery or brightness are accompanied by gross blocking and take a second or two to settle down.Worse, although the picture is anamorphic, it was not digitized in the DVD optimized wide-screen standard. Thus, an already poor picture becomes even worse when zoomed on a 16:9 set.The movie deserves better treatment than it received. There are no extras (such as the Showtime special on the making of the show), but then again, they could not have compressed the disk any more to allow it.Verdict: a good retelling of a decades-old movie presented in less than the best of today's technology.

Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[8, 10]","I first came across this award-nominated miniseries while looking for the DVD of the original film (a wonderful work in its own right).  Being the kind of person who enjoys watching updated versions of classic stories, I decided to buy this DVD and check it out for myself.I was completely blown away by this epic miniseries.  Based upon the novel by Nevil Shute and the screenplay for the original movie by John Paxton, and directed by Highlander helmer Russell Mulcahy, On the Beach portrays a realistic and terrifying updating of the 1959 movie: the Chinese, having blockaded the country of Taiwan, kick things up a level when they get into a nuclear exchange with the United States.  The resulting destruction is devastating to the entire Northern Hemisphere, and pretty soon there are only small pockets of people left alive on the planet, most of them in the country of Australia.Armand Assante does a wonderful job portraying US Navy Cmdr. Dwight Towers of the USS Charleston, the only American submarine to survive the devastation of the nuclear exchange that wiped out the Northern Hemisphere.  He is able to bring to the part an emotional depth the likes of which very few actors in Hollywood can express.Rachel Ward is very good as Moira Davidson, the spirited local woman whom Dwight meets and falls in love with despite his grief over the loss of his wife and children.  Her portrayal of Moira is open and honest, which I like very much.Bryan Brown is excellent as scientist Julian Osborne, the scientist and ex-fiancee of Moira who is retrieved from a secluded island and ordered by the Australian Navy to go with Dwight, Aussie Lt. Peter Holmes and the Charleston crew to investigate a mysterious signal emanating from Alaska.  From Osborne's rivalry with Cmdr. Towers for Moira's affections to the sickening devastation that Osborne feels when his suspicions about the signal and the radioactive fallout are proven right, Bryan Brown plays this character to the hilt.The thing I like best about this version of On the Beach is the fact that the screenplay, while based on the 1959 original movie, is not a word-for-word, scene-for-scene rehashing of it.  While both the movie and the miniseries stay somewhat true to Nevil Shute's novel the miniseries updates the story for the 21st century, which makes it a stark reminder that even in this era of perestroika, we must remain eternally vigilant.",5,An Excellent Cautionary Tale for the 21st Century,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2412,"['first', 'came', 'award-nominated', 'miniseries', 'looking', 'DVD', 'original', 'film', 'wonderful', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'Being', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'watching', 'updated', 'versions', 'classic', 'stories', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'check', 'out', 'myself.I', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'epic', 'miniseries', 'Based', 'novel', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'screenplay', 'original', 'movie', 'John', 'Paxton', 'directed', 'Highlander', 'helmer', 'Russell', 'Mulcahy', 'Beach', 'realistic', 'terrifying', 'updating', '1959', 'movie', 'Chinese', 'having', 'blockaded', 'country', 'Taiwan', 'kick', 'things', 'up', 'level', 'when', 'get', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'United', 'States', 'resulting', 'destruction', 'devastating', 'entire', 'Northern', 'Hemisphere', 'pretty', 'soon', 'are', 'only', 'small', 'pockets', 'people', 'left', 'alive', 'planet', 'most', 'country', 'Australia.Armand', 'Assante', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'US', 'Navy', 'Cmdr', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'USS', 'Charleston', 'only', 'American', 'submarine', 'survive', 'devastation', 'nuclear', 'exchange', 'wiped', 'out', 'Northern', 'Hemisphere', 'able', 'bring', 'part', 'emotional', 'depth', 'likes', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'express.Rachel', 'Ward', 'very', 'good', 'Moira', 'Davidson', 'spirited', 'local', 'woman', 'whom', 'Dwight', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'grief', 'loss', 'wife', 'children', 'portrayal', 'Moira', 'open', 'honest', 'like', 'very', 'much.Bryan', 'Brown', 'excellent', 'scientist', 'Julian', 'Osborne', 'scientist', 'ex-fiancee', 'Moira', 'who', 'retrieved', 'secluded', 'island', 'ordered', 'Australian', 'Navy', 'go', 'Dwight', 'Aussie', 'Lt.', 'Peter', 'Holmes', 'Charleston', 'crew', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'signal', 'emanating', 'Alaska', 'From', 'Osborne', 'rivalry', 'Cmdr', 'Towers', 'Moira', 'affections', 'sickening', 'devastation', 'Osborne', 'feels', 'when', 'suspicions', 'signal', 'radioactive', 'fallout', 'are', 'proven', 'right', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'character', 'hilt.The', 'thing', 'like', 'best', 'version', 'Beach', 'fact', 'screenplay', 'based', '1959', 'original', 'movie', 'not', 'word-for-word', 'scene-for-scene', 'rehashing', 'movie', 'miniseries', 'stay', 'somewhat', 'true', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'novel', 'miniseries', 'story', '21st', 'century', 'stark', 'reminder', 'even', 'era', 'perestroika', 'must', 'remain', 'eternally', 'vigilant']",N/A
555405,A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0,B00004WI5P,Teemacs,"[0, 0]","Having read Neville Shute's original novel and seen Stanley Kramer's original film, I have somewhat mixed feelings about this film. On the one hand, I always found it hard to buy the stiff-upper-lip, steady-as-she-sinks-chaps attitudes portrayed in Shute's book and the Kramer film. I would imagine civil society becoming steadily more uncivil, as portrayed here. The endless repetitions of ""Waltzing Matilda"" in the Kramer film are also something the present one mercifully lacks.On the other hand, it does change the story quite a lot, in some cases to bring it up to date technologically, but not always to advantage. And it does lose something in its portrayal of Cdr. Towers, who, in the book (and less so in the Kramer film), is a fine, noble and upright gentleman, whose upper lip is so stiff that he could easily pass for a Limey, and who mentally refuses to accept that his family is dead. As a result, the passion for Moira that one sees in this film does not exist in book or Kramer film. One has to accept that the Cdr. Towers in this film (why does he have the four bars of a captain on his epaulettes?) and that of the book and earlier film are two completely different creations. Personally, although I'm an admirer of Gregory Peck, the new Cdr. Towers is altogether more human than the rather stiff Peck version, and to me slightly preferable. It would be nice to think that there would be such fine and noble creatures who stay thus in the face of looming total extinction, but somehow I doubt it. And I did miss the ""Australian Grand Prix""!As a long-time Melbourne resident, I was pleased to see dinkum Aussies in the cast (I never could quite accept Ava Gardiner and Fred Astaire as Ozs - although the Kramer film has the oddity of John Meillon as an American!). Mind you, Bryan Brown's portrayal of Julian the larrikin scientist is somewhat over the top (to put it mildly). I could be picky and say that Julian could never have driven his Ferrari west across the Westgate Bridge and ended up on Philip Island racetrack well to the east of Melbourne, unless he made a REALLY long detour! Anyway, it was nice seeing central Melbourne without a single Holden Kingswood in sight!Recommendation? See both - each has strengths and weaknesses. And both are salutary warnings about what we could do to each other on what may be the only island of life in the entire universe. As the signs in both films say, there is still time. And, as the Moira character says in the film, watching her sister and her child happily at play, a photo of that scene should be stuck above every nuclear trigger.P.S. If anyone wants to see this and doesn't want to pay the outrageous price currently demanded for a new one. amazon.de is offering it (German/English) for Eur13 + postage. The German title is the inappropriate ""U.S.S. Charleston - Die letzte Rettung der Menschheit"" (USS Charleston - Mankind's last rescue).

555406,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,B00004WI5P,TFR,"[8, 10]","Forget about science fiction films aimed at prepubescent audiences like ""Alien vs. Predator"".  If you want to see something geniunely chilling, watch ""On the Beach"".This Showtime mini-series is an updated 2000 remake of Stanley Kramer's ""On the Beach"".  That 1959 film featured Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire.  This 2000 version has Armand Assante, Rachel Ward, and Bryan Brown taking the Peck, Gardner and Astaire roles, respectively.Like the original, the remake is something that incorporates most of the main story elements from the novel of the same name by Australian author Nevil Shute, and stays true to its anti-nuke theme.  Even though the original was a great film in its own right, the remake is an excellent, stand alone piece.The story in a nutshell:  Sometime in the near future, a nuclear conflict between China and the United States takes place, leaving only Australia in its wake. Billions have been killed. As the story opens, we learn that all human life in the Northern Hemisphere is assumed to be dead. The extinction of the human race is a probability, which stands in the path of masive nuclear fallout, which is gradually making its way to Australia.A small crew aboard a U.S. Navy submarine led by Commander Dwight Towers (Aramande Assante) manages to survive the apocalypse. When they arrive in Australia, the crew of the U.S. vessel see that anarchy and chaos are taking over as death-driven angst builds on Melbourne's streets.Even though nuclear physicist Julian Osborne, (Bryan Brown), says the country is at doomsday, it isn't long before Towers volunteers himself and his crew in a desperate attempt to salvage what remains of life on earth.  However, before Towers and his crew embark on this mission, Moira Davidson, (Rachel Ward) appears on the scene with a mission of her own that involves Towers, much to the chagrin of Osborne.At three hours running time, this production feels a little long.  Better to watch in two sittings, not one.  Otherwise, the production is excellent, and the quality of the dvd is also excellent.  The only problem I had with picture quality is that during the Anchorage sequence, the my copy of the dvd kept going from color to black and white.  This wasn't intentional - just some flaw in production.Rachel Ward is the scene stealer in this remake, much like Ava Gardner was in the original, but then both are, or were, stunningly beautiful women.  As Towers, Assante's portrayal of the submarine captain is fine, but there just isn't really any chemistry between himself and Ward.  In portions of the film, his acting seems a little wooden.  And although I've never really cared for Brown as an actor, he does a good job in his portrayal of Osborne.Even on a small screen, the panoramic cinematography is notable in parts.  During some portions of ""On the Beach"", I found myself wishing for a larger screen.I gave this remake of ""On the Beach"" five stars, but it's not something I'd want to see again and again, because the story itself is more than a little disconcerting.  But I would imagine that feeling probably was Shute's intended response, anyway.",5,THERE IS STILL TIME,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,3132,"['Forget', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'aimed', 'prepubescent', 'audiences', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'geniunely', 'chilling', 'watch', 'Beach', '.This', 'Showtime', 'mini-series', 'updated', '2000', 'remake', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', 'Beach', '1959', 'film', 'featured', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Fred', 'Astaire', '2000', 'version', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'taking', 'Peck', 'Gardner', 'Astaire', 'roles', 'respectively.Like', 'original', 'remake', 'something', 'most', 'main', 'story', 'elements', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Australian', 'author', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'true', 'anti-nuke', 'theme', 'Even', 'original', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'remake', 'excellent', 'stand', 'alone', 'piece.The', 'story', 'nutshell', 'Sometime', 'near', 'future', 'nuclear', 'conflict', 'China', 'United', 'States', 'place', 'leaving', 'only', 'Australia', 'wake', 'Billions', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'story', 'learn', 'human', 'life', 'Northern', 'Hemisphere', 'assumed', 'be', 'dead', 'extinction', 'human', 'race', 'probability', 'path', 'masive', 'nuclear', 'fallout', 'gradually', 'making', 'way', 'Australia.A', 'small', 'crew', 'aboard', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'submarine', 'led', 'Commander', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'Aramande', 'Assante', 'survive', 'apocalypse', 'When', 'arrive', 'Australia', 'crew', 'U.S.', 'vessel', 'see', 'anarchy', 'chaos', 'are', 'taking', 'over', 'death-driven', 'angst', 'builds', 'Melbourne', 'streets.Even', 'nuclear', 'physicist', 'Julian', 'Osborne', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'country', 'doomsday', ""n't"", 'long', 'Towers', 'volunteers', 'crew', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'what', 'life', 'earth', 'However', 'Towers', 'crew', 'embark', 'mission', 'Moira', 'Davidson', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'scene', 'mission', 'own', 'Towers', 'much', 'chagrin', 'Osborne.At', 'three', 'hours', 'running', 'time', 'production', 'little', 'long', 'Better', 'watch', 'two', 'sittings', 'not', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'production', 'excellent', 'quality', 'dvd', 'also', 'excellent', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'picture', 'quality', 'Anchorage', 'sequence', 'copy', 'dvd', 'kept', 'going', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'was', ""n't"", 'intentional', 'just', 'flaw', 'production.Rachel', 'Ward', 'scene', 'stealer', 'remake', 'much', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'was', 'original', 'then', 'are', 'were', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'women', 'Towers', 'Assante', 'portrayal', 'submarine', 'captain', 'fine', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'chemistry', 'Ward', 'portions', 'film', 'acting', 'little', 'wooden', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'cared', 'Brown', 'actor', 'good', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Osborne.Even', 'small', 'screen', 'panoramic', 'cinematography', 'notable', 'parts', 'portions', 'Beach', 'found', 'wishing', 'larger', 'screen.I', 'gave', 'remake', 'Beach', 'five', 'stars', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'story', 'more', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'would', 'imagine', 'feeling', 'probably', 'was', 'Shute', 'intended', 'response', 'anyway']",N/A
555407,A1ZOIGQHW7FPT2,B00004WI5P,Thorvald,"[3, 4]","This is a remake of the 1959 b&amp;w verison of &quot;On the Beach,&quot; which is, in turn, based on the classic novel by Nevil Shute (a book I strongly recommend). This verison has been updated to take place in the present time, rather than the 50s.For the first 45 minutes I didn't think the filmmakers had understood the theme of the book at all. They were focusing on bitter anti-American talk, rioting in the streets, that sort of thing, whereas the original story is about people meeting the end of their lives--of _all_ lives--with quiet, if somewhat desperately insane, dignity. After the beginning, however, the movie got on track and thereafter did a very good job of drawing one into the characters and their stories.The casting was very good with fine performances all the way around. The story moved along rather slowly and quietly, but with the overlying tension of the end nearing enhancing everything they said and did. Their struggle to grasp any tiny fragment of hope was done well. Updating the 1950's technological scenarios to present technology turned out quite well.The movie is long and I could have done with a bit of tightening here and there, but I could not stop watching it at any point and was quite misted up at the end.

555408,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00004WI5P,T.M. Reader,"[2, 2]","This is a review of the 2000, Showtime, made-for-cable production based on the wonderful Nevil Shute novel.  The plot is simply: A nuclear world war has occurred.  Only Australia survives, temporarily, until the nuclear cloud arrives from the northern hemisphere.  A surviving American submarine arrives in Australia.  A story of drama and interpersonal relationships ensues.A film of this story was previously produced in 1959, starring Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins, Fred Astaire.  In my opinion, the 1959 version was superior.This version is updated to bring us into the 21st century (not necessarily a good thing?).  Now included are solar powered laptops, email, computer generated video displays, brutal street violence, raw crude language, an anti-military political agenda, and other such products of our present enlightened age.This new production weighs in at over 3 1/2 hours, easily over twice as long as the 1959 production.  The implications of that are obvious.  I am pleased that I did not really notice a lot of apparent ""filler"" time.  The musical score is not nearly as memorable as the earlier film, which was interlaced with a variety of renderings of ""Waltzing Matilda"".  But the music is usually good, although generally unremakable.Enough of the comparisons . . . on to this particular movie.  Experiencing this story is very emotional.  It deals with society, family, and death.  Slow, impending death (is that not the present reality of it anyway?).This film serves the story well.  Well produced and directed, although on less than a ""blank check"" budget.  Well-casted(with one exception which I will address below).  The closing minutes are gut-wrenching.A couple of specific observations -  Firstly, the technical aspects regarding the American submarine were interesting (I am a submarine veteran).  On one hand, they were unusually well done and accurately rendered (for Hollywood).  The film paid homage to the concept of sovereignty of command of an American warship.  On the other hand, this principle was occasionally disregarded and military discipline degraded to what appeared to be business as usual on a tuna boat.  I found this distracting.My second criticism - Viewing the film critically, I kept trying to figure out what was ""wrong"".  I finally pinned it: Rachel Ward (Moira Davidson, lush).  I don't know why I ever thought she was attractive or could act.  She did not pull it off in this film.  The notion that an intelligent professional naval officer, submarine commander (Armand Assante is awesome) would have his head seriously turned by this skank is ludicrous.Including Assante (Cdr Dwight Towers), the rest of the casting is wonderful: Bryan Brown (Dr. Osborne)is perfect as a semi-likeable scientist.  Steve Bastoni is impeccible as the loyal first officer (correctly, Executive Officer).  Jacqueline McKenzie is memorable (role as Ward's sister).  Special mention to Grant Bowler (Lt Peter Holmes, and McKenzie's husband). I previously mentioned the gut-wrenching closing scenes . . . credit to Bowler for that.Thsi film is not as good as the original.  Or the book.  But it's good.  It's long, and you'll probably enjoy it.",4,On the Beach,1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,3193,"['review', '2000', 'Showtime', 'made-for-cable', 'production', 'based', 'wonderful', 'Nevil', 'Shute', 'novel', 'plot', 'simply', 'nuclear', 'world', 'war', 'occurred', 'Only', 'Australia', 'temporarily', 'nuclear', 'cloud', 'northern', 'hemisphere', 'surviving', 'American', 'submarine', 'Australia', 'A', 'story', 'drama', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'ensues.A', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'previously', 'produced', '1959', 'starring', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'opinion', '1959', 'version', 'was', 'superior.This', 'version', 'updated', 'bring', '21st', 'century', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'Now', 'included', 'are', 'solar', 'powered', 'laptops', 'email', 'computer', 'generated', 'video', 'displays', 'brutal', 'street', 'violence', 'raw', 'crude', 'language', 'anti-military', 'political', 'agenda', 'other', 'such', 'products', 'present', 'enlightened', 'age.This', 'new', 'production', 'weighs', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'easily', 'over', 'twice', 'as', 'long', '1959', 'production', 'implications', 'are', 'obvious', 'am', 'pleased', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'notice', 'lot', 'apparent', 'filler', 'time', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'memorable', 'earlier', 'film', 'was', 'interlaced', 'variety', 'renderings', 'Waltzing', 'Matilda', 'music', 'usually', 'good', 'generally', 'comparisons', 'particular', 'movie', 'Experiencing', 'story', 'very', 'emotional', 'society', 'family', 'death', 'Slow', 'impending', 'death', 'not', 'present', 'reality', 'anyway', '.This', 'film', 'story', 'well', 'Well', 'produced', 'directed', 'less', 'blank', 'check', 'budget', 'Well-casted', 'one', 'exception', 'will', 'address', 'closing', 'minutes', 'are', 'gut-wrenching.A', 'couple', 'specific', 'observations', 'Firstly', 'technical', 'aspects', 'regarding', 'American', 'submarine', 'were', 'interesting', 'am', 'submarine', 'veteran', 'one', 'hand', 'were', 'unusually', 'well', 'done', 'accurately', 'rendered', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'paid', 'homage', 'concept', 'sovereignty', 'command', 'American', 'warship', 'other', 'hand', 'principle', 'was', 'occasionally', 'disregarded', 'military', 'discipline', 'degraded', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'business', 'usual', 'tuna', 'boat', 'found', 'distracting.My', 'second', 'criticism', 'Viewing', 'film', 'critically', 'kept', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'finally', 'pinned', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Moira', 'Davidson', 'lush', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'ever', 'thought', 'was', 'attractive', 'could', 'act', 'did', 'not', 'pull', 'off', 'film', 'notion', 'intelligent', 'professional', 'naval', 'officer', 'submarine', 'commander', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'awesome', 'would', 'have', 'head', 'seriously', 'turned', 'skank', 'ludicrous.Including', 'Assante', 'Cdr', 'Dwight', 'Towers', 'rest', 'casting', 'wonderful', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'Dr.', 'Osborne', 'perfect', 'semi-likeable', 'scientist', 'Steve', 'Bastoni', 'impeccible', 'loyal', 'first', 'officer', 'correctly', 'Executive', 'Officer', 'Jacqueline', 'McKenzie', 'memorable', 'role', 'Ward', 'sister', 'Special', 'mention', 'Grant', 'Bowler', 'Lt', 'Peter', 'Holmes', 'McKenzie', 'husband', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'gut-wrenching', 'closing', 'scenes', 'credit', 'Bowler', 'that.Thsi', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'book', 'good', 'long', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy']",N/A

Audio was Dolby Digital AC3(per InterVideo WinDVD7 Info button as the DVD case had no information regarding audio format) and there were no audio options available on the DVD. There was an audio/video defect in the beginning of the movie(train scene) which included dropped frames. Picture was color and displayed perfectly on my 4:3 format TV. Picture detail was good but there were many motion artifacts on this DVD throughout the entire movie but, instead of a blurry picture normally associated with these picture defects, there were pixelation effects. Any change in camera angles, the action scenes with the race car, or when the camera panned across a background, resulted in pixelation effects. Scene access performed using Scene Selection. There were no extras with this DVD. This DVD did play on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC with a Dell HD monitor and resolution set at 1900 x 1200, using both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed with vertical black bars on each side of the picture for both Windows Media Player 12 and VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. Resolution was not as good as on my 4:3 format TV. HD monitors vary in their ability to down convert a signal source(720p) below its capability(full HD). On my Windows XP SP3 laptop with resolution set at 1400x1050 using InterVideo WinDVD 7 software, the picture displayed better than on the HD monitor and the software controls are better as well than either Windows Media Player 12 or VideoLAN's VLC Player v.1.1.10. The picture displayed full screen on the laptop. When I get around to purchasing a Blu-Ray DVD player, I will test this DVD on it to see if it corrects any of the pixelation effects on this DVD.",4,On The Beach-DVD,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1796,"['Technical', 'details-This', 'DVD', 'was', 'English', 'options', 'other', 'languages', 'Audio', 'was', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'AC3', 'InterVideo', 'WinDVD7', 'Info', 'button', 'DVD', 'case', 'had', 'information', 'regarding', 'audio', 'format', 'were', 'audio', 'options', 'available', 'DVD', 'was', 'audio/video', 'defect', 'beginning', 'movie', 'train', 'scene', 'included', 'dropped', 'frames', 'Picture', 'was', 'color', 'displayed', 'perfectly', '4:3', 'format', 'TV', 'Picture', 'detail', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'many', 'motion', 'artifacts', 'DVD', 'entire', 'movie', 'instead', 'blurry', 'picture', 'normally', 'associated', 'picture', 'defects', 'were', 'pixelation', 'effects', 'change', 'camera', 'angles', 'action', 'scenes', 'race', 'car', 'when', 'camera', 'panned', 'background', 'resulted', 'pixelation', 'effects', 'Scene', 'access', 'performed', 'using', 'Scene', 'Selection', 'were', 'extras', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'did', 'play', 'Windows', '7', 'Ultimate', 'PC', 'Dell', 'HD', 'monitor', 'resolution', 'set', '1900', 'x', '1200', 'using', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Player', '12', 'VideoLAN', 'VLC', 'Player', 'v.1.1.10', 'picture', 'displayed', 'vertical', 'black', 'bars', 'side', 'picture', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Player', '12', 'VideoLAN', 'VLC', 'Player', 'v.1.1.10', 'Resolution', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', '4:3', 'format', 'TV', 'HD', 'monitors', 'vary', 'ability', 'down', 'convert', 'signal', 'source', '720p', 'capability', 'full', 'HD', 'Windows', 'XP', 'SP3', 'laptop', 'resolution', 'set', '1400x1050', 'using', 'InterVideo', 'WinDVD', '7', 'software', 'picture', 'displayed', 'better', 'HD', 'monitor', 'software', 'controls', 'are', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'Windows', 'Media', 'Player', '12', 'VideoLAN', 'VLC', 'Player', 'v.1.1.10', 'picture', 'displayed', 'full', 'screen', 'laptop', 'When', 'get', 'purchasing', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'player', 'will', 'test', 'DVD', 'see', 'pixelation', 'effects', 'DVD']",N/A
555410,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B00004WI5P,Willy D. Reviewer,"[6, 10]","Do not buy this movie, do not rent this move, and if a friend plays it -- leave.This has to be the worst re-make of any movie. I was forced to give it one Star to write this review.First: This mess is totally miscast.  Armand Assante plays the captain of a nuclear sub like he was Al Capone.  He delivers his lines in the same gruff manner; no intelligence.  Rachel Ward behaves over-the-top like such an alcoholic slut, who could fall in love with her except another alcoholic?  (See Barfly)  And Bryan Brown is the loud shouting hysterical doomsday scientist who annoys you after his first bit of dialog and over acting, until his last words, and unbelievable facial expressions as he drives off the road to his death.Second: The script was rewritten with different scenes and dialog and was a total bore.  It's okay to update a film, but at least they should have tried to recreate the spirit of the original. And the director changed the ending to a more sappy Hollywood ending.Third: This film is a slap at those who serve aboard nuclear submarines.  The crew was completely unprofessional, acting more like new recruits or reservists who had never been on a submarine.  And officers DO NOT play poker with the enlisted men(and take their money)!  Plus, this is the military, not a democracy -- the crew do not get to vote on the captain's next course of action.  Nuclear submariners have been taught that after a nuclear war, they are still U.S. Navy Submariners, and not civilians.  Even if the world is coming to an end, they will behave professionally -- that is their Esprit de Corp!!!",1,Zero Stars!,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,1595,"['Do', 'not', 'buy', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'rent', 'move', 'friend', 'leave.This', 'be', 'worst', 're-make', 'movie', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'one', 'Star', 'write', 'review.First', 'mess', 'totally', 'miscast', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'captain', 'nuclear', 'sub', 'was', 'Al', 'Capone', 'lines', 'same', 'gruff', 'manner', 'intelligence', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'over-the-top', 'alcoholic', 'slut', 'who', 'could', 'fall', 'love', 'alcoholic', 'See', 'Barfly', 'Bryan', 'Brown', 'loud', 'shouting', 'hysterical', 'doomsday', 'scientist', 'who', 'first', 'bit', 'dialog', 'acting', 'last', 'words', 'unbelievable', 'facial', 'expressions', 'road', 'death.Second', 'script', 'was', 'rewritten', 'different', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'was', 'total', 'bore', 'okay', 'update', 'film', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'recreate', 'spirit', 'original', 'director', 'changed', 'ending', 'more', 'sappy', 'Hollywood', 'ending.Third', 'film', 'slap', 'who', 'serve', 'nuclear', 'submarines', 'crew', 'was', 'completely', 'unprofessional', 'acting', 'more', 'new', 'recruits', 'reservists', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'submarine', 'officers', 'DO', 'NOT', 'play', 'poker', 'enlisted', 'men', 'take', 'money', 'military', 'not', 'democracy', 'crew', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'vote', 'captain', 'next', 'course', 'action', 'Nuclear', 'submariners', 'have', 'been', 'taught', 'nuclear', 'war', 'are', 'still', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'Submariners', 'not', 'civilians', 'Even', 'world', 'coming', 'end', 'will', 'behave', 'professionally', 'Esprit', 'Corp']",N/A
