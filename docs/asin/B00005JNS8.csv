The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining. With the comic trio of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and Edward Platt, this hilarious spy spoof is still funny today.Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings. The bumbling spy at a top-secret government agency called Control, which is responsible for keeping the free world free. Backing him up is his beautiful partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and his long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.Together with 99 and the Chief (and his faithful dog Fang), Max battles the forces of badness and rottenness -- namely, the anti-Control called KAOS. Among the enemies the Control agents face: the dwarfish ""Mr. Big,"" the fashion forces of evil, a likable killer robot, a Chinese mastermind called the Claw, and explosive paintings. And that's only the start...""Missed it by that much!"" Maxwell Smart's catchphrases and goofy confidence made him the perfect antidote to the suave James Bond. Unlike Bond and similar movie spies, Max succeeds out of luck and bumbling more often than not, but he still succeeds.The comic timing is a little awkward at the very beginning, but rapidly gets its footing. What's really funny is the endless spoofery -- Max is given all sorts of weird gadgets, including the legendary ""shoe-phone,"" and he faces off against all sorts of cartoonish villains.The political clime of the mid 1960s is all over the series, especially in the form of KAOS. But fortunately they don't get preachy -- KAOS is merely a big evil organization, no more. Some references are dated, and this definitely debuted before the era of political correctness (there's a bizarre episode about American Indians threatening the US government, and the Claw is funny if un-PC).Don Adams MAKES this series, with his quirky facial expressions, nasal voice and odd body language. Hard to tell how he could keep a straight face throughout many of the lines he says. Barbara Feldon is the least quirky of the cast, but does a good job as the brains behind Max, while Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief, who always looks slightly frayed.Though some of the 60s-era references are a bit dated, ""Get Smart"" is still gutsplittingly funny.

I didn't like every single episode produced, but overall it was very clever. I hadn't realized until this 1st season set was released that Don Adams' ""clipped voice"" was a mimic of William Powell in ""The Thin Man"" (which I have not seen).Barbara Feldon was very fetching as ""99"" and I think she still is (if she will forgive me of my expression). I can't think of a better sidekick for Agent ""86"".I enjoyed the extras that came with this DVD set. Some of it was a little lengthly for me but I enjoyed it none the less. It was well worth the money to buy this. I only wish I could purchase the rest of the seasons individually.

In the review, I basically made a plea to the universe to bring this show out on DVD. Well, would you believe on November 15, 2006, I will get my wish?Time-Life is offering The Complete Get Smart Collection. A 25 disc collection featuring every episode digitally remastered. I guess it is selling for approximately $200. It could be $2,000 and I would still buy this classic show.I have friends' that tell me I am stuck in a time warp because I watch very little television that is actually new. For some reason or another the writing of the older shows far surpass the writing of today's television shows. I watched a rerun of Friends' the other night and I was literally dizzy after watching that show. There were like four stories going on in one show? Have we become that much of an ADD society where we can't just have one show with one plot for thirty minutes? It seems as though everything today is so ""extreme"" and so in your face. I actually get offended at some of the things I have watched and I'm not easily offended.But this show, Get Smart, conceived by certified ""Wack Jobs"" Mel Brooks and Buck Henry is in a class all by itself. This show is brilliant in every way. The writing, the acting, the production value. It did get a little cheesy when Maxwell Smart and agent 99 got married, but even those episodes were funnier than the stuff that's out there now.The only thing that I really feel saddened about is that this release is coming after Don Adam's death.

This version DOES have the pilot  episode in Black and White with both Buck Henry AND Mel Brooks commentaries!  Its a great episode and features Michael Dunn (the diminutive star from  the Wild Wild West!)...this set also features the wonderful episode introductions by Barbara Feldon...so it appears to be exactly the same as the more expensive versions from TimeLife.

634781,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00005JNS8,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","I hadn't seen ""Get Smart"" since the 1960s but I must say it hasn't lost any of its' humour or inventiveness.Sprung from the fertile minds of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry this award winning series still packs a humourous punch.The series quickly put into the /60s pop culture dictionary four main catch-phrases:""Would you believe?"",""Sorry about that Chief"",""Missed it by that much(with the accompanying index finger over the thumb) and "".....and loving it"".Fact is I find myself to this day periodically saying one of these phrases.I'm not sure what that says about me OR the show(:-)) but that is the impact it had,and it still does.The show is a huge send up of the then popular spy genre/Cold War theme then front and center, courtesy of Sean Connery and the Bond pictures.It involves the exploits of one Maxwell Smart,Agent 86,played absolutely brilliantly by Don Adams and his fellow agent,Agent 99,done by Barbara Feldon.Somehow Max in the end manages to solve the cases he is assigned to but more often than not,it is usually in spite of himself.In the process he often sends his beloved chief,played by Edward Platt,into fits of apoplexy,or in the very least supplies him with numerous and recurring headaches!It is not very hard also to spot alot of Stan Laurel-like facial expressions and reactions in Adam's character,along with many similar gags used throughout the series;which helps explains why the material over all has stood the test of time.And not too surprising to see Laurel and Hardys' influence there as they were hugely popular on TV at that time.The series won an Emmy Award in its' very first year with the two part ep ""The Ship of Spies"";a take off on the 15th Century book/allegorical story ""A Ship of Fools"".For those that think this show is a continuous running series of gags and other comedy routines,will be shocked to realize that there are many serious or semi-serious moments that occur throughout.However we know,as the creators remind us subtly and not so subtly,that it is all done tongue in cheek so there is no mistaking what you are watching.One very funny and recurring set of gags to watch out for throughout this series is Max's dealings with the various devices and paraphernalia he is given to thwart his evil CHAOS opponents with and the many items he talks into which are subbing as phones.The humour is very visual,it can be subtle,but it's always hilarious.These shows have all been digitally remastered and the transfers are well done.Each ep has an introductory blurb spoken by actress Barbara Feldon(Agent 99) herself(with the option of listening or going right to the ep);like Robert Conrad in the first season of ""The Wild,Wild West"".However I hope,unlike the ""Wild,Wild West"",that Ms. Feldon will continue her spoken intros throughout the series to come.It was so nice to hear her voice.The original b&w; 1/2 hour pilot is also included here;with the rest of the eps all in colour.This is another first for me as I had never seen any of these shows in colour until I viewed them in this set.And the contrast and the colour itself are like they were shot just yesterday.Wonderful.For anyone of you who have read some of my reviews you will have noticed that since the beginning I have stressed and made special mention of any show that pertains to being of a""family"" nature;that is those that are suitable for family viewing,a rare commodity these days.Well lo and behold for the first time anywhere that I have seen,the back jacket blurb to this set mentions this show as one perfect for ""families"".Are the companies finally catching up? I fervently hope so.I also hope it continues to be a trend.As there are no shows anymore that an entire family can sit down and watch together without fear of a sexual reference or bad language,a show like ""Get Smart"" is the perfect tonic for our times.Universal humour that the whole family can watch,laugh and enjoy TOGETHER.What a concept!",5,I'm highly recommending Get Smart and........loving it!,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,3933,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Get', 'Smart', '1960s', 'must', 'say', ""n't"", 'lost', 'humour', 'inventiveness.Sprung', 'fertile', 'minds', 'Mel', 'Brooks', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'award', 'winning', 'series', 'still', 'humourous', 'punch.The', 'series', 'quickly', 'put', '/60s', 'pop', 'culture', 'dictionary', 'four', 'main', 'catch-phrases', 'Would', 'believe', 'Sorry', 'Chief', 'Missed', 'much', 'accompanying', 'index', 'finger', 'thumb', '..and', 'loving', '.Fact', 'find', 'day', 'periodically', 'saying', 'one', 'phrases.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'show', 'impact', 'had', 'still', 'does.The', 'show', 'huge', 'send', 'then', 'popular', 'spy', 'genre/Cold', 'War', 'theme', 'then', 'front', 'center', 'courtesy', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Bond', 'pictures.It', 'exploits', 'one', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'Agent', '86', 'played', 'absolutely', 'brilliantly', 'Don', 'Adams', 'fellow', 'agent', 'Agent', '99', 'done', 'Barbara', 'Feldon.Somehow', 'Max', 'end', 'solve', 'cases', 'assigned', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'usually', 'spite', 'process', 'often', 'beloved', 'chief', 'played', 'Edward', 'Platt', 'fits', 'apoplexy', 'very', 'least', 'supplies', 'numerous', 'recurring', 'headaches', 'not', 'very', 'hard', 'also', 'spot', 'alot', 'Stan', 'Laurel-like', 'facial', 'expressions', 'reactions', 'Adam', 'character', 'many', 'similar', 'gags', 'used', 'series', 'why', 'material', 'stood', 'test', 'time.And', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'see', 'Laurel', 'Hardys', 'influence', 'there', 'were', 'hugely', 'popular', 'TV', 'time.The', 'series', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'very', 'first', 'year', 'two', 'part', 'Ship', 'Spies', 'take', 'off', '15th', 'Century', 'book/allegorical', 'story', 'Ship', 'Fools', '.For', 'think', 'show', 'continuous', 'running', 'series', 'gags', 'other', 'comedy', 'routines', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'realize', 'are', 'many', 'serious', 'semi-serious', 'moments', 'occur', 'know', 'creators', 'remind', 'subtly', 'not', 'so', 'subtly', 'done', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'so', 'mistaking', 'what', 'are', 'watching.One', 'very', 'funny', 'recurring', 'set', 'gags', 'watch', 'out', 'series', 'Max', 'dealings', 'various', 'devices', 'paraphernalia', 'given', 'thwart', 'evil', 'CHAOS', 'opponents', 'many', 'items', 'are', 'subbing', 'phones.The', 'humour', 'very', 'visual', 'can', 'be', 'subtle', 'always', 'hilarious.These', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'transfers', 'are', 'well', 'done.Each', 'ep', 'introductory', 'blurb', 'spoken', 'actress', 'Barbara', 'Feldon', 'Agent', '99', 'herself', 'option', 'listening', 'going', 'right', 'ep', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'first', 'season', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', '.However', 'hope', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Ms.', 'Feldon', 'will', 'continue', 'spoken', 'intros', 'series', 'come.It', 'was', 'so', 'nice', 'hear', 'voice.The', 'original', 'b', 'w', '1/2', 'hour', 'pilot', 'also', 'included', 'here', 'rest', 'eps', 'colour.This', 'first', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'shows', 'colour', 'viewed', 'set.And', 'contrast', 'colour', 'are', 'were', 'shot', 'just', 'yesterday.Wonderful.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'will', 'have', 'noticed', 'beginning', 'have', 'stressed', 'made', 'special', 'mention', 'show', 'being', 'family', 'nature', 'are', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'rare', 'commodity', 'days.Well', 'lo', 'behold', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'seen', 'back', 'jacket', 'blurb', 'set', 'mentions', 'show', 'one', 'perfect', 'families', '.Are', 'companies', 'finally', 'catching', 'up', 'fervently', 'hope', 'so.I', 'also', 'hope', 'be', 'trend.As', 'are', 'shows', 'anymore', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'together', 'fear', 'sexual', 'reference', 'bad', 'language', 'show', 'Get', 'Smart', 'perfect', 'tonic', 'times.Universal', 'humour', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'laugh', 'enjoy', 'TOGETHER.What', 'concept']",Get Smart: The Original TV Series - Season 1

After somehow never being released in VHS, the series was finally released in DVD.  The negative is that it was released as the complete series with a price tag that was higher per season than the subsequent release of season one.  The positive is that it's now down to $110 on Amazon which is a little more reasonable.  Hopefully HBO Home Video will get smart and release the remaining seasons individually soon.  Those who were fans will end up buying it one way or another.

634785,AHC4V4AZHWZ9F,B00005JNS8,Spike,"[7, 10]","The show was very funny but perhaps the one thing that I was most impressed with as a child was Maxwell Smart's shoe phone and all the other gadgets.During the 1960s, a telephone was a telephone and it was not supposed to look like anything other than a telephone. The idea of a shoe phone was in itself a revolutionary idea and perfect for comedy. Even more impressive was the ""sock phone"" in case Max had to remove his shoes before walking on an expensive carpet.It wasn't too long afterward that the novelty phone industry came about .. and I'm willing to bet it was this TV series that inspired the entire industry. There is now a beer can telephone, a bowling pin phone, a Darth Vader phone to commemorate Star Wars, and there is even a football phone.What they need now is a phone shaped like a slice of pizza so Maxwell Smart and others can make a phone call during a pizza party. Imagine holding a slice of pizza to your ear. Why not a KFC piece of chicken phone, or perhaps an ice cream cone phone.
