In fact, I love documentaries, too, but this is truly my favorite genre.Anyway, Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon play the parents of Lorenzo, a little boy who is smart and good-looking and a genuinely nice kid until he starts going haywire. It takes a while for him to be diagnosed with ALD, a pretty rare genetic disease that is passed from mother to son. That is, women only carry it, but only boys are afflicted with it. It not only kills, it does it in a slow and horrible way, stripping the myelin sheath off nerves. And gradually damaging the brain in the process. So he has a succession of losses -- muscle coordination, hearing, sight, breathing, swallowing -- that can take months or years to kill.But Lorenzo's parents simply do not give up. They research in the library, they pester doctors and researchers, they join a parents' support group that is run by a couple of sanctimonious . . . well, they try everything. And along the way, they learn that it has to do with Lorenzo's genetic inability to digest cholesterol properly.I didn't understand the science part very well, but the gist of it was that whenever they wanted to try something, the researchers had their protocols, more concerned with their data than with helping Lorenzo. Peter Ustinov plays Dr. Nikolius, the only one with the courage to help them ""unofficially."" They developed Lorenzo's Oil with the help of a sympathetic industrial chemist and an English chemist who was about to retire.Finally, by way of a veterinary parallel in dogs, they discovered that a cure is possible. Lorenzo's oil was not a cure, but a treatment that halts the disease's progress. So it could not do much for Lorenzo, who was already quite deteriorated, but it became a life-saver for boys who had only just been diagnosed. At the end of the movie, there are a great many boys and young men who say how long they have been taking Lorenzo's Oil, and how they are able to live normal or nearly normal lives.Since this was made over 10 years ago, it is possible that the cure discovered by the vet has been made available to humans by now.",4,Fascinating True Story,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2143,"['have', 'weak', 'spot', 'dramas', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'fact', 'love', 'documentaries', 'too', 'truly', 'favorite', 'genre.Anyway', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'play', 'parents', 'Lorenzo', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'smart', 'good-looking', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'kid', 'going', 'haywire', 'while', 'be', 'diagnosed', 'ALD', 'pretty', 'rare', 'genetic', 'disease', 'passed', 'mother', 'son', 'women', 'only', 'carry', 'only', 'boys', 'are', 'afflicted', 'not', 'only', 'slow', 'horrible', 'way', 'stripping', 'myelin', 'sheath', 'off', 'nerves', 'gradually', 'damaging', 'brain', 'process', 'So', 'succession', 'losses', 'muscle', 'coordination', 'hearing', 'sight', 'breathing', 'swallowing', 'can', 'take', 'months', 'years', 'kill.But', 'Lorenzo', 'parents', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'research', 'library', 'pester', 'doctors', 'researchers', 'join', 'parents', 'support', 'group', 'run', 'couple', 'sanctimonious', 'well', 'try', 'everything', 'way', 'learn', 'do', 'Lorenzo', 'genetic', 'inability', 'digest', 'cholesterol', 'properly.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'science', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'gist', 'was', 'whenever', 'wanted', 'try', 'something', 'researchers', 'had', 'protocols', 'more', 'concerned', 'data', 'helping', 'Lorenzo', 'Peter', 'Ustinov', 'Dr.', 'Nikolius', 'only', 'one', 'courage', 'help', 'unofficially', 'developed', 'Lorenzo', 'Oil', 'help', 'sympathetic', 'industrial', 'chemist', 'English', 'chemist', 'who', 'was', 'retire.Finally', 'way', 'veterinary', 'parallel', 'dogs', 'discovered', 'cure', 'possible', 'Lorenzo', 'oil', 'was', 'not', 'cure', 'treatment', 'disease', 'progress', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'Lorenzo', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'quite', 'deteriorated', 'became', 'life-saver', 'boys', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'just', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'boys', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'say', 'how', 'long', 'have', 'been', 'taking', 'Lorenzo', 'Oil', 'how', 'are', 'able', 'live', 'normal', 'nearly', 'normal', 'lives.Since', 'was', 'made', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'possible', 'cure', 'discovered', 'vet', 'been', 'made', 'available', 'humans', 'now']",Lorenzo's Oil VHS

333410,A3JBMNBK3Y61LW,6302779448,"Carlos Vazquez Quintana ""cvq""","[1, 11]","This film is finely made, but that confirms me in the idea that scientific problems are very difficult to deal in the cinema. In this movie the medical statement are questioned. The most simple people could get the idea that physicians are mediocre or interested persons, and this is so in some cases, of course.But there are much diseases so rare that were unknown and undetected owing to poor conditions of general health until practically 50 years ago when infantile rates of mortality were much higher than now, so mostly of these illness were simply ignored under a huge amount of deaths. The parents of Lorenzo love his son, but they -over all the mother- borders the thin frontier between reason and insanity. Of course nobody is exempt of this under extreme conditions, but she demands healing here and now when this is impossible. The doctors are seen under a potent magnifier lens, and I'm afraid at so close distance nobody is good looking. The physicians must treat not only Lorenzo, but also much other patients with another diseases, something that the family of these sick children are unable to understand, and so, this movie presents for me several questions: the barrier between perseverance and mental blockade, the necessity sometimes of resignation and the misjudgement and devaluation of the scientific method. Cinema has a big influence owing to his easy sentimental impact, but I think reality is hard and truly there are things out of reach of science of today and tomorrow no matter how much you love your family... or if not, we should to be gods, no vulgar human beings.  Don't trust very much in miracles as the oil of Lorenzo.

333411,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6302779448,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 4]","With a heartbreaking real life story of the Odone family, director-producer George Miller created one of the most touching and emotional drama's ever to grace the big screen.  With an all star cast, most notably Susan Surandon in her oscar nominated role, he paints a very real picture of grief, pain, struggle and passion as the Odone's cope with the tragic desease that has attacked their son Lorenzo.Lorenzo was only five when he showed the first symptoms of ALD, a very rare and very deadly desease that attacks your central nervous system by destroying your myelin.  It deteriorates your brain at a rapid pace and, in affect, makes you crazy and immoble before taking your life.  It's a desease that only manifest's itself in young boys usually between the ages of 5 & 10 and it's given to them only by the mother, for only mothers are carriers.  The desease, at the time of this instance which was the early 80's, was not very understood and so there was no hope laid out to the Odone family, just a list of horrible things their son would undergo before his death.  His life expectancy alone was only 24 months.The Odone family, husband Augusto (Nick Nolte) and wife Michaela (Susan Surandon) decide to take matters into their own hands, doing emmence research to find answers to questions, answer none of the scientist and doctors seem to have.  No one even knows why this desease does what it does.  As the Odone's work and work to find a cure their son steadily gets worse and worse.  The Odone's are forced with moral issues as they confront the head's of an ALD support group, grappling the issue of their childrens well-being.  The question is raised a few times as to whether it's just or even humane for the parents to try and prolong their childs suffering.  Is it selfish to want your child with you always if they are in constant pain?  You have two extremes, and this film addresses both of them with equal ammounts of compasion.  You have the Odone's who want to save their child, and rightfully so for no one wants to lose thier children, but then you have other families that just want god to end their childs pain, and rightfully so for no one wants their children to suffer.This is one of the hardest films to watch, especially if you have children for it forces you to contemplate what you would do, and that's not a question you want to ask yourself.The Odone's were a very brave and very strong couple, who never allowed their situation to get the better of them.  Yes, they were human and they went through stages, they were crushed and they were hurt and they were dieing little by little every day as they watched the love of their life deteriorate into nothing, but they held it together for their son.  As his condition worsend it appeared as if they would never find answers in time, and as Aususto noted to his wife, all they were doing was probably being done for someone elses child, but that god for that for it's because of them that this desease is better understood and that there is a cure, or at least help.Lorenzo's oil refers to the oil taken to help balance the bodies distribution of saturated fats that are killing ALD patients.  Lorenzo's oil is helping hundreds of children with this horrible desease and it's thanks to this beautiful family who sacrificed everything they had to make sure another family would have the answers they needed!I wanted to make special note of Susan Surandon's performance here.  She completly commanded the screen.  I've always loved her and felt that she was one of, if not the best actress we have working today for no matter what the role she takes on she always leaves me stunned.  With this performance though I was especially drawn in.  She does so much with just the look in her eyes.  The scene when the doctor tells them this desease is passed on only through the mother, the look in her face, the fear and guilt and self-loathing in her eyes, you almost want to hold her and tell her it's not her fault.  Susan captured the emotions of her charactor PERFECTLY and left me with goosebumps.  Now Nolte is another story.  He kind of annoyed me.  Sorry people, but I'm Italian, and he sounded more Russian than anything else.  Bad accent.  Anyways, as far as his tortured father went, sometime he was little overboard, but for the most part he did well since he was the more stable more controlled parent who was trying to keep some sense of sanity in the house, but towards the end when he goes a little off his rocker he gets a little mad-scientist-crazy.  But don't let that deture you from this gem of a film.Highly recommended but viewer beware, this is a hearttugging, heartbreaking, tearjerking assult of the senses kinda film.

This is no sugar-sweet drama but a down-to-earth film about a  family who prove that sometimes-ordinary people CAN move mountains.

333421,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302779448,Lawyeraau,"[92, 93]","This is the true life story of the Odone family, Augusto, Michaela, and Lorenzo, and their battle with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disease that attacks the central nervous system by systemically destroying its protective cover, the myelin sheath. It is an extremely rare disease that is transmitted exclusively to males through a gene that is carried by the mother.Augusto, an economist, and Michaela, a linguist, were a well educated, well to do, multi-lingual couple with a little son named Lorenzo who was precocious beyond his years. He spoke English and Italian fluently, as well as the language spoken in the community in Africa in which he spent his very early years. When he returned to the United States at about the age of five, his behavior started to change He came overly aggressive and given to emotional outbursts. After much angst on the part of the Odones over what could be wrong, they were finally told that their son suffered from ALD, which was the functional equivalent of having their son being given a death sentence, as there was no cure for this degenerative disease.This well educated couple refused to accept the death sentence meted out to their son by the medical establishment. With no medical background, they disregarded conventional medical wisdom and went about trying to find a cure for their son, in a quest so remarkable and so moving, as to inspire absolute awe in the viewer. A more caring or loving set of parents would be hard to find. Lorenzo is surely loved. Together, Augusto and Michaela take on the medical establishment. What they ended up discovering rocked the medical world. To find out just what it was that they specifically did, you will just have to watch the movie.Director George Miller does a masterful job in directing this film, avoiding the obvious sentimental traps and playing the film out in a very straightforward way. The ravages of this disease are fully played out and are not sugarcoated in any way. Nick Nolte gives a bravura performance as Augusto Odone, though his Italian accent needs a little work. He is superb as the father who transfers his emotion to the task of learning biochemistry in order to ascertain just what factors are at the root of his son's disease. His way of dealing with his son's illness is intellectual and methodical.Susan Sarandon is sensational as Michaela Odone, a woman of such strength, resolution, and determination that it would be hard to find another like her. Her pain is palpable, as she sees her son deteriorate, but she refuses to take the path of least resistance where Lorenzo is concerned. In the face of daunting odds, she perseveres with Lorenzo, talking to him, as well as stimulating and challenging him. A notable performance is also given by Kathleen Wilhuite who plays the part of Dierdre Murphy, Michaela's sister and Lorenzo's loving aunt.This is a sensational film that avoids all the maudlin, sentimental traps laid out in the formulaic disease of the week movies one often finds. This is a deftly directed, well acted film, informative and moving. It is a film that will stay with the viewer, long after the credits have rolled off the screen. This is a film that richly deserves a transfer to DVD.

The real life Odone family, portrayed masterfully by Nick Nolte and Susan Surandon, is far beyond what anyone would refer to as inspiring.The Odones are a professional power couple. Augusto (Nolte) has adult children from a previous marriage. He and his wife have one child together, young Lorenzo.Lorenzo had the  benefit of being raised by highly intellectual and caring, multi-lingual  parents. Since Augusto Odone is a financial wizard for the World Bank, which provides not only a comfortable, but worldly life for the  family now small family. Lorenzo grows up in Africa, speaking English and  Italian fluently and being fully conversant in the language spoken by his  classmates in Africa.When Lorenzo reaches school age, his parents return  to the United States and Lorenzo starts school. Suddenly, a child who has  grown up fearless and extroverted with others of all ages and cultures is having emotional outbursts in class and getting into fights.After it  becomes clear that there is a physical reason behind his behavior, not an  emotional one, his parents take him to every doctor they can find until  they hear that their child has the medical equivalent of a death sentence.As a financial expert and a linguist, the medically ignorant  Odones are faced with a a problem they don't see a solution for. Their child has a rare disease, so rare, it  is financially prohibitive for pharmaceutical companies to invest millions  and perhaps even billions on developing a cure. The disease,  adrenoleukodystrophy, also known as ALD, is inherited by males from their mothers. It begins to rear its head when boys are around 5, destroying the  myelin sheath surrounding all nerves, making movement, and even the functioning of the 5 senses slowly disappear.The Odones cannot cope with the responses they are getting from the medical community - everywhere they turn, the answer is always the same - there is no treatment, there is no cure, and your child will die a horrible death. They refuse to accept defeat sitting down and, the  Odones investigate and learn all they can about the disease that is slowly  destroying Lorenzo. They soon become experts on the disease and make  medical breakthroughs and discoveries not persued by scientists in the past  and they soon get attention from the medical community who are in awe of  their progress.I can't say much more without revealing the crux of the story, but this is a film that will inspire anyone who sees it to never  quit and not to be defeated when told that what they want to accomplish is  impossible.The film is an emotional rollercoaster, but one you'll never regret viewing, There are films that stick with you for a lifetime and this is one of those films. When you are facing impossible odds and you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, this is the film to watch... it ignites inspiration and optimism.In addition to being an inspirational tear-jerker, the performances are incredible. Nolte's performance in this film is one of the best of his career. A stupendous film that isn't all about jerking tears from your head. There are moments when you feel like jumping out of your seat and cheering. This film should be in every family's library.",5,"with the proper motivation, anyone can move mountains",964483200,"07 25, 2000",2000,3334,"['one', 'films', 'are', 'scenes', 'overall', 'themes', 'will', 'NEVER', 'forget', 'real', 'life', 'Odone', 'family', 'portrayed', 'masterfully', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Susan', 'Surandon', 'far', 'what', 'anyone', 'would', 'refer', 'inspiring.The', 'Odones', 'are', 'professional', 'power', 'couple', 'Augusto', 'Nolte', 'adult', 'children', 'previous', 'marriage', 'wife', 'have', 'one', 'child', 'together', 'young', 'Lorenzo.Lorenzo', 'had', 'benefit', 'being', 'raised', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'caring', 'multi-lingual', 'parents', 'Augusto', 'Odone', 'financial', 'wizard', 'World', 'Bank', 'not', 'only', 'comfortable', 'worldly', 'life', 'family', 'now', 'small', 'family', 'Lorenzo', 'up', 'Africa', 'speaking', 'English', 'Italian', 'fluently', 'being', 'fully', 'conversant', 'language', 'spoken', 'classmates', 'Africa.When', 'Lorenzo', 'school', 'age', 'parents', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'Lorenzo', 'school', 'Suddenly', 'child', 'who', 'grown', 'up', 'fearless', 'extroverted', 'others', 'ages', 'cultures', 'having', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'class', 'getting', 'fights.After', 'clear', 'physical', 'reason', 'behavior', 'not', 'emotional', 'one', 'parents', 'take', 'doctor', 'can', 'find', 'hear', 'child', 'medical', 'equivalent', 'death', 'sentence.As', 'financial', 'expert', 'linguist', 'medically', 'ignorant', 'Odones', 'are', 'faced', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'solution', 'child', 'rare', 'disease', 'so', 'rare', 'financially', 'prohibitive', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'invest', 'millions', 'perhaps', 'even', 'billions', 'developing', 'cure', 'disease', 'adrenoleukodystrophy', 'also', 'known', 'ALD', 'inherited', 'males', 'mothers', 'rear', 'head', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'around', '5', 'destroying', 'myelin', 'sheath', 'surrounding', 'nerves', 'making', 'movement', 'even', 'functioning', '5', 'senses', 'slowly', 'disappear.The', 'Odones', 'can', 'not', 'cope', 'responses', 'are', 'getting', 'medical', 'community', 'everywhere', 'turn', 'answer', 'always', 'same', 'treatment', 'cure', 'child', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'death', 'refuse', 'accept', 'defeat', 'sitting', 'down', 'Odones', 'investigate', 'learn', 'can', 'disease', 'slowly', 'destroying', 'Lorenzo', 'soon', 'become', 'experts', 'disease', 'make', 'medical', 'breakthroughs', 'discoveries', 'not', 'persued', 'scientists', 'past', 'soon', 'get', 'attention', 'medical', 'community', 'who', 'are', 'awe', 'progress.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'revealing', 'crux', 'story', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'quit', 'not', 'be', 'defeated', 'when', 'told', 'what', 'want', 'accomplish', 'impossible.The', 'film', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'one', ""'ll"", 'never', 'regret', 'viewing', 'are', 'films', 'stick', 'lifetime', 'one', 'films', 'When', 'are', 'facing', 'impossible', 'odds', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'film', 'watch', 'inspiration', 'optimism.In', 'addition', 'being', 'inspirational', 'tear-jerker', 'performances', 'are', 'incredible', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'stupendous', 'film', ""n't"", 'jerking', 'tears', 'head', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'feel', 'jumping', 'seat', 'cheering', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'family', 'library']",Lorenzo's Oil VHS
