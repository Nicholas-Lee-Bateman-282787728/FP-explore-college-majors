1024778,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000J3OTT6,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 6]","'Invincible' is specatcular.  Not just another underdog sports movie, the film delivers an emotionally charged story with a convincing portrayal of desperation and determination.Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) represented the dreams and hopes of everyone who lived in South Philadelphia.  He was a struggling, working-class man who loved to play football with his friends at an urban park.  Their intensity was as great on the field as it was cheering for the Eagles.  He was underemployed, working as a substitute teacher during the day and as a bartender at night.  At the beginning he is laid off from teaching, and his wife faithlessly moves herself and everything out of their apartment.  Just when everything seems desperate, including for fans who live through terrible, losing seasons, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) is hired as head coach from UCLA and tries to shake up the team.  He ruthlessly cuts the complacent and restless, but he really takes a risk when he has a tryout from anyone off the street who wishes to make the team.  Enter Vince Papale who doesn't take any of his neighborhood buddies seriously when they tell him to give it a try.  During the tryout, the local reporter sums up the spirit of the spectacle with his derision of the whole process, but Papale remains the only one taken seriously (and the only one recruited).  Then, every grueling week is met by the spectre of being cut by the team--a truth he greets with grim honesty.  He is hated by his teammates who give him the shaft like any scab by union picketers.  He's actually what Vermeil wants, just someone off the street who will shake up the complacency of the team and get them off their laurels.  Much like 'Rudy', he is the underdog with a lot of heart.  The rest of the movie answers the question about how far can Vince go, and how seriously does Vermeil take him to do more than rejuvenate his new team.  The Eagles famously lost their first seven games, including the pre-season and their first regular season games Vermeil's first year.  What makes the film great is not so much how they answer the question, but how they flawlessly develop the story.I never knew about Vince Papale beforehand, so this adventure seems particularly vibrant and new.  The development is absorbing, and Wahlberg plays the role convincingly as the struggling and skeptical Papale.  We are certain of his everyman's hunger every step of the way.  Greg Kinnear is also worthy as Vermeil.  Every scowl, every grimmace, and every bit of emotion is embodied in Kinnear.  It is hardly imaginable that he could have been played by anyone else.  Woven into the plot is Janet Cantrell (played with genuine spirit by Elizabeth Bank) a friend's cousin who adds a love interest, spunk to their lively circle, and entertainment with her playful rivalry, rooting for the Giants.  'Invincible' is one of those rare gems that you must see to change your heart and rejuvenate your spirit.",5,Better Than 'Rudy'!,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2947,"[""'Invincible"", 'specatcular', 'Not', 'just', 'underdog', 'sports', 'movie', 'film', 'delivers', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'story', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'desperation', 'determination.Vince', 'Papale', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'represented', 'dreams', 'hopes', 'everyone', 'who', 'lived', 'South', 'Philadelphia', 'was', 'struggling', 'working-class', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'play', 'football', 'friends', 'urban', 'park', 'intensity', 'was', 'great', 'field', 'was', 'cheering', 'Eagles', 'was', 'underemployed', 'working', 'substitute', 'teacher', 'day', 'bartender', 'night', 'beginning', 'laid', 'off', 'teaching', 'wife', 'faithlessly', 'everything', 'apartment', 'Just', 'when', 'everything', 'desperate', 'including', 'fans', 'who', 'live', 'terrible', 'losing', 'seasons', 'Dick', 'Vermeil', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'hired', 'head', 'coach', 'UCLA', 'tries', 'shake', 'up', 'team', 'ruthlessly', 'complacent', 'restless', 'really', 'risk', 'when', 'tryout', 'anyone', 'street', 'who', 'make', 'team', 'Enter', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'neighborhood', 'buddies', 'seriously', 'when', 'tell', 'give', 'try', 'tryout', 'local', 'reporter', 'sums', 'up', 'spirit', 'spectacle', 'derision', 'whole', 'process', 'Papale', 'only', 'one', 'taken', 'seriously', 'only', 'one', 'recruited', 'Then', 'grueling', 'week', 'met', 'spectre', 'being', 'cut', 'team', 'truth', 'grim', 'honesty', 'hated', 'teammates', 'who', 'give', 'shaft', 'scab', 'union', 'picketers', 'actually', 'what', 'Vermeil', 'just', 'someone', 'street', 'who', 'will', 'shake', 'up', 'complacency', 'team', 'get', 'off', 'laurels', 'Much', ""'Rudy"", 'underdog', 'lot', 'heart', 'rest', 'movie', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'Vince', 'go', 'how', 'seriously', 'Vermeil', 'take', 'do', 'more', 'rejuvenate', 'new', 'team', 'Eagles', 'famously', 'lost', 'first', 'seven', 'games', 'including', 'pre-season', 'first', 'regular', 'season', 'games', 'Vermeil', 'first', 'year', 'What', 'film', 'great', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'answer', 'question', 'how', 'flawlessly', 'develop', 'story.I', 'never', 'knew', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'beforehand', 'adventure', 'particularly', 'vibrant', 'new', 'development', 'absorbing', 'Wahlberg', 'role', 'convincingly', 'struggling', 'skeptical', 'Papale', 'are', 'certain', 'everyman', 'hunger', 'step', 'way', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'also', 'worthy', 'Vermeil', 'Every', 'scowl', 'grimmace', 'bit', 'emotion', 'embodied', 'Kinnear', 'hardly', 'imaginable', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'anyone', 'else', 'Woven', 'plot', 'Janet', 'Cantrell', 'played', 'genuine', 'spirit', 'Elizabeth', 'Bank', 'friend', 'cousin', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'spunk', 'lively', 'circle', 'entertainment', 'playful', 'rivalry', 'rooting', 'Giants', ""'Invincible"", 'one', 'rare', 'gems', 'must', 'see', 'change', 'heart', 'rejuvenate', 'spirit']",N/A

1024781,AXA7OH47LBXZ7,B000J3OTT6,"A Positive Guy ""Jay""","[1, 1]","""Invincible"" is a class act on many fronts.  Superb performances by the entire cast, but most especially Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear add to this excellent film.  In fact, I believe this to be one of Kinnear's finest performances.  He had the subtle nuances of Vermiel down pat.This is a film about Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), who loses everything.  His wife walks out on him, he loses his teaching job, and drives a clunker that needs a jump about every 20 feet.  Yet, he has a passion to play football.  From the backlots in Philadelphia playing hard with his working class buddies, you come to know very quickly that Vince's true love is the game.Rookie head coach Dick Vermiel (Greg Kinnear) issues a call for open tryouts trying almost anything to rescue a dead-end team. Because of Papale's raw but obvious talent, he lands a job with the Philadelphia Eagles and the rest is history.The movie itself is more like a 'snapshot in time' in the sense that it doesn't take us through a protracted space of time where characters are developed.  It all happens in a brief span of time with the centerpieces of the film being Vince Papale and Dick Vermiel.  But then again I realize I am somewhat prejudiced because I don't think that there is any movie about football that would be too long for my taste.This movie isn't only for us who love football, but in a larger sense a story about grit, determination, and character-the triumph of the human spirit.  Unfortunately films of this sort are almost unheard of these days.  This is a movie I am glad to own and, I am sure will watch again and again. Hollywood?

In the same way you don't have to be a fan of football to enjoy another film about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphai native who rises to be a star; Invincible. There are a lot of similarities between Invincible and Rocky (and that's not a bad thing considering Rocky won Best Picture), but there are two notable differences. The first is: Invincible is based on a true story. The second is: it's even better than Rocky.Most people are familiar with the Disney formula of sports films (ie The Rookie, Remember the Titans, etc..). They always contain a certain level of quality that makes them watchable. They also always seem to contain a prerequisite level of Formula D (D is for Disney in this case) and enough sugar coating to keep them from ever being considered truly great films. Invincible makes a strong attempt to break this mold. While it may not be competely free of the Disney strings, director/cinematographer Ericson Core definately makes this film his own. His talent behind the camera gives this film a visual artistic quality instead of a by-the-numbers feel most often seen in Disney films.To some, Invincible may seem unoriginal. With so many films being made following the same formula, it would be understandable for audiences to feel like they've ""been there, done that,"" but you can't fault a true story for being unoriginal. We watch true stories not so much to find out what happens next, but to awe in the fact that it happened at all. Other true stories like Seabiscuit and Cinderella Man share much in common with Invincible, but their failure in telling their story as if it were fiction; where the audience doesn't know what's going to happen next. In the film Rocky, the audience doesn't know if Rocky can win the big fight, so the story plays out successfully keeping the audience compelled to watch and see if Rocky can do it. This approach doesn't work when retelling history, and Invincible realizes that fact. Everyone knows Vince Papale's is going to succeed, but what most don't know is what it took to get there, and how he succeeded.The stars of this film are Greg Kinnear and Mark Wahlberg. Both are underrated actors, and both deliver performances that should rank up with their best. Being a fan of NFL football and also a fan of Dick Vermeil, I felt chills when Kinnear performed as the legendary coach.In the end, I'd call Invincible a great film in Disney clothing.

Even in a fairly tepid film such as this, he lights up the screen -- the man is pure charisma, even if he's still just doing the same baby-faced, lovable-studmuffin-beefcake schtick that he's done in other films... ""Invincible"" it has its good points -- it evokes the misery of the long economic recession of the Ford & Carter era, and dutifully pays tribute to working class America.  It gives a lengthy look at the giant locker room of preseason training for a team like the Eagles, and has some interesting touches.  But it also plods along and has an unsatisfying ending.  The character work is perfunctory and has very little payoff-- when Wahlberg's character makes the team, the film just ends, cutting away to where-are-they-now placards, rather than letting us see a little more football, and actually enjoy some of the success of the team that went from utter loser status to being a reputable team that would eventually go to the Superbowl (though apparently the guy Wahlberg played had left the team by then...)

This movie does a great job showing you that watching football isn't only about winning and losing, it's about the determined players on the field who are willing to do whatever it takes just to play the game.  Just to be involved with his favorite team the Philadelphia Eagles is the main goal of Vince Papale.  For him to succeed is quite an amazing thing to see happen.Now, seeing as how I live close to Philadelphia, that fact alone means I prefer this movie over most drama sports movies, but this really *is* a great movie for any fan of football.  When Invincible is over, you will realize how important it is to see into the life of one of the players on the field.  It's not just about winning and losing, it's about how much success someone with an incredible amount of determination can bring to a sports team.  The movie works.The only negative is that I didn't feel the movie developed many of the other characters much, and they all felt like they were only there because they had to be.

Papale, it seems, is an excelent football player and has impressed his friends by his play in their sandlot games.Most of the movie gets by on the fact that the audience knows what sports movie is supposed to look like and can spot the plot twists and turns in Invincible and recognize when they are supposed to laugh or cry, etc.  Papale and his friends are really a sad bunch of guys.  The 1970s depression has sucked the life out of South Philly.  Thankfully they have Papale and his football to lean on.  And thankfully, Papale has Janet.  Janet moves from New York and falls for Papale.  She is played by Elizabeth Banks, recently in the 40-Year Old Virgin.For a sports movie fan, this is an okay movie.  You'll enjoy the scenes your supposed to enjoy.  But for me, the dour mood of the characters throughout the entire movie left me feeling kind of depressed.",4,Regular Guy Stars in the NFL!

In order to light a fire into the city and under his players, he holds an open tryout.Slews of clowns, nobodies and never gonna be anybodies show up to this open tryout along with a skeptic Vince Papale' (MARK WAHLBERG).

Not to mention, Philadelphia is a blue collar, hard working man kind of city. The people in Philly are real. They aren't fake and bogged down by Hollywood's glamour. They get dirty and they struggle to pay the bills like we all do. We relate and we as an audience make an instant connection.INVINCIBLE guides us through the emotions that Vince Papale' went through as he went through the trials of team cut after team cut. The players who were against him. The life outside the practices and his distant and unspoken bond with legendary coach Dick Vermeil.INVINCIBLE is about life, heroism, heart and determination.

Get a sympathetic protagonist and pit him against insurmountable odds with a satisfying ending so that everyone leaves the theatre feeling all warm and fuzzy. Case in point: The Bad News Bears and Rocky. In recent years, Disney has revitalized the genre with The Rookie and Miracle. Their latest effort is Invincible, the fictionalized account of how 30-year-old part-time bartender Vince Papale tried out for and made it onto the Philadelphia Eagles football team without even having played the game in college (the usual stepping stone to playing professional football, although he did play for the Philadelphia Bell of the now-defunct WFL).Invincible definitely captures the intensity of the Philly sports fans and their, at times, fickle nature. When their teams do well they fiercely cheer them on, but when they do poorly, the fans aren't afraid to let them know it in the most raw and vocal way they know how. This film captures the hard-working, blue collar lifeblood of Philly in the `70s. Invincible is a modest movie that certainly has its heart in the right place. Director Ericson Core includes the requisite training montages of Vince running; catching balls, doing various drills and so on. It becomes pretty obvious that Rocky is the template for Invincible: the underdog who succeeds on his own terms and goes the distance. It's nothing we haven't seen before but this film isn't interested in reinventing the wheel - just telling an entertaining story.""Becoming Invincible: The Story of Vince Papale"" is a making of featurette that gives a brief historical perspective of the Eagles in the `70s while also tracking the development of the film. There are some great clips of the real Papale in action on the field that makes this featurette very enjoyable and informative.There is an audio commentary by Vince Papale, producer Mark Ciardi and writer Brad Gann. Papale offers his recollections of the past and tells production anecdotes, like how nervous he was meeting Wahlberg for the first time (he was just as nervous to meet Papale) and praises his portrayal. Papale's natural charm and good humour comes through the clearest on this track. He spends a lot of time reminiscing about his friends and how they are depicted in the movie.Finally, there is an additional commentary by director Ericson Core and editor Jerry Greenberg. This is a more technically oriented track as the director talks about how he shot the film while both men talk about the editing process.

I like inspiring stories and admit to a tear in my eye when I see Brian's Song show up on television.  I enjoy good movies about football and those are fairly rare.  The bad ones (the Replacements, the Longest Yard remake, the list is long) do a poor job of  either depicting the action in a realistic manner or they forget to write a decent script.  Not the case here.  The action is crisp and the acting is very good.  Invincible is not as moving as Brian's Song but it is a fun, moving picture.  It brings to mind Rudy, The Rookie and even a little bit of Rocky as it takes you on a fun ride.  This movie is perfect for the whole family.

Mark Walhberg and Greg Kinnear both do a nice job of bringing the story to life and the sports scenes look real. One of the points I like about this movie is the title sequence, which has nothing to do with the Papale story but does a great job of capturing the feel of a declining city in the 1970's. The DVD is light on special features although the one documentary is interesting .  The lack of deleted scenes is unfortunate and I would have liked to hear from more of Papale's old teammates.  The movie, however, is worth owning and the sound quality of the DVD is wonderful.  I also give a bonus point for a great soundtrack full of classic songs from the era.",4,Fun Family Film for Football Fans and Others,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,1536,"['admit', 'it-', 'am', 'sports', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'long', 'time', 'inspiring', 'stories', 'admit', 'tear', 'eye', 'when', 'see', 'Brian', 'Song', 'show', 'up', 'television', 'enjoy', 'good', 'movies', 'football', 'are', 'fairly', 'rare', 'bad', 'ones', 'Replacements', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'remake', 'list', 'long', 'do', 'poor', 'job', 'depicting', 'action', 'realistic', 'manner', 'forget', 'write', 'decent', 'script', 'Not', 'case', 'here', 'action', 'crisp', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'Invincible', 'not', 'as', 'moving', 'Brian', 'Song', 'fun', 'moving', 'picture', 'mind', 'Rudy', 'Rookie', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'Rocky', 'fun', 'ride', 'movie', 'perfect', 'whole', 'family', 'story', 'Vince', 'Papale', '30', 'year', 'old', 'walk', 'bartender', 'who', 'played', 'three', 'years', 'NFL', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'gritty', 'city', 'tough', 'decade', 'Mark', 'Walhberg', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'sports', 'scenes', 'look', 'real', 'One', 'points', 'like', 'movie', 'title', 'sequence', 'nothing', 'do', 'Papale', 'story', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'feel', 'declining', 'city', '1970', 'DVD', 'light', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'lack', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'unfortunate', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'Papale', 'old', 'teammates', 'movie', 'however', 'worth', 'owning', 'sound', 'quality', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'also', 'give', 'bonus', 'point', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'classic', 'songs', 'era']",N/A

Okay on to the good stuff .This movie was not only for Vince Papale , it was also made for Dick Vermeil and all the Eagles fans. I was born in Philly and seeing old Vet stadium gives me goose bumps . All the parts with the Eagles fans being loud and obnoxious well ..... it`s true.If you wear a Cowboys jersey to an Eagles game I would recomend staying close to the security guards at all times. We are tough fans and even though it was ugly I am glad they showed like that. I have always belived Eagles fans are the best and the worst at the same time. We are die hard and passionate about our team and we love foot ball but we can sometimes be unforgiving ,rude and nasty. But thats what makes it fun to be an Eagles fan. I now live in Tampa Fla ands it`s just not the same . If you like foot ball movies this movie is for you . Some people have compared this movie to Rocky but don`t think so . You see this is a (true) story and it`s about football not boxing .Don`t get me wrong Rocky was great. On another note I found it ironic and funny that the one other player on the Eagle that was giving Papale the most grief the big mouth was jersey number 81 . Did any other Eagles fans catch that?

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[4, 5]","As a huge football fan--and because I very much remember, and watched, Vince Papale play--I so wanted to like INVINCIBLE.  And what's not to like?  A hometown, down-on-his-luck, thirtysomething ex-jock getting a shot to play in the NFL is mega-inspiring. . .or should be.  But this film misses the mark, and fails to connect.  Why?Mark Wahlberg plays Papale as a silent, brooding man; when his wife leaves him, he sits in his empty apartment and broods; when the pressures of making the Philadelphia Eagles' roster mount, he sits in the stands and broods; he broods in the bar where he works; he broods on the stoops of his father's flat; he broods in his dorm room at training camp.  Problem is, he's so aloof--to all the other characters, and to the audience--we never get to meet Vince Papale.  Who is this guy?  Why is he so emotion-less?  Why won't he engage with. . .anyone?  And then, during the film's closing credits, when we watch clips of the real Vince Papale playing football--an animated, engaging, enthusiastic Papale--we feel a massive disconnect between the real man and Wahlberg's portrayal.  I sure wanted to get to know the guy in those clips; it definitely didn't seem like the same person who was sleepwalking through the film.Speaking of animation, Coach Dick Vermeil was one of the most fired-up, enthusiastic coaches to ever roam an NFL sideline; yet even here the filmmakers give us a very somber, subdued portrayal (Greg Kinnear).  And Elizabeth Banks, the mandatory romantic interest, is often downright obnoxious as an in-your-face New York Giant fan in Eagle-crazed Philadelphia.  There was so much to like--and so much squandered--with the premise of INVINCIBLE.  Huge cinematic disappointment.--D.

We also learn that one man's struggle and achievement, though they seem trivial to those on the top, can mean the world to those who look up to that man.

The only thing left behind is a note reminding him that he is a failure, a man who will never amount to anything.The Philadelphia Eagles are as successful as this 30 year old, Italian-American from South Philadelphia whose sports career is nothing more than ""tough touch"" football with the boys in a vacant lot, and season tickets to watch the hometown team get their feathers plucked Sunday after Sunday. But his luck is about to change. The new head coach calls for try-outs for any fan that wants to make the team. Only one of the hundreds is selected. That one is Vince Papale.His next challenge is overcoming the physical and verbal abuse of teammates who see him only as a publicity stunt. His support are a few friends, a father, and a new girlfriend (who is a NY Giant fan). He has nothing but his heart, and an all-out desire to make the team.As a die-hard Giant fan, I found it hard not to cheer for the Eagles in this movie, because it wasn't about them. It was about a man's personal triumph, and his desire to overcome everything that so many said he could never accomplish. This is the kind of story anyone would love.Mark Wahlenberg turns in a fine performance of Papale. The cast is excellent. The story is uncomplicated, and it resembles the tale of Rocky Balboa, which was released as Papale's real-life star was on the rise. It shows how a team that resented him deeply came to admire and respect their special teams captain.In addition to a special feature of making the movie with the real deal (VP), the viewer can see the movie in three versions with narrations in two of them.Don't miss.

1024815,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B000J3OTT6,Eugene Chamson,"[5, 6]","Once again, we are back in a rough neighborhood of South Philly in the 1970's, where a working class loser is about to beat all odds to compete as a professional athlete.  But here the similarities with Rocky end, for whereas Rocky inspired a generation of filmgoers to believe in themselves and their dreams, and spawned a family of sequels, Invincible is little more than a pleasant evening's entertainment, and an easily forgettable film.What went wrong?  Certainly the truth-based story of how working class stiff Vince Papale rises from down on his luck, 30 year old bartender to a starter in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles has the stuff of magic in it.  We know the formula.  And we know there'll be a feel-good payoff in the end when our hero succeeds.  But normally in films of this genre, the hero relies on determination and belief in himself to succeed in a way that no one believed was possible.  That's inspiring.  Think Rocky.  Think Cinderella Man.  But in this film, it seems, everyone believes in Papale except himself.  He appears to succeed in spite of himself.  That's just frustrating to watch.From the very beginning, we see that Papale has exceptional talent, as he singlehandedly wins the sandlot football games with his friends, outrunning everyone and making incredible catches.  When the Eagles call for open try-outs, his friends all urge him to go.  But Papale has just lost his job and his wife, and doesn't want to ""deal with more failure"".  Finally, he relents and appears to go through the motions of the try-out.  Even so, he beats practically everyone in the 40 yard dash and soon captures the attention of the coaches with his remarkable athleticism.All his friends tell Papale, ""You're good enough.  You belong with those guys.""  But Papale isn't buying it.  With each round of cuts, he has his bags packed and waits at the door for the knock that never comes.  ""Oh well, I made it this time, but will probably get cut next time"", he thinks.  When he finally makes the team, no one is more incredulous than he is.On the field, Papale seems to play with passion and drive.  But these actions are incongruent with his attitude off the field.  Are we seeing self-effacing humility or the mindset of a loser?  Who cares, it's just not that inspiring.  This film is really more about Papale's inner struggle to believe in himself.  But it's hard for the average viewer to have any sympathy for a man who can run a 40 yard dash faster than most people on the planet, but somehow can't muster much self-confidence.Finally in the end, Papale pulls it all together and goes out and makes a game-winning play.  Finally, the payoff we've been waiting for:  the hero succeeds.  But it's too little, too late, and not worth the frustration of watching him not believe in himself through most of the film.As Papale, Mark Wahlberg's chiseled trim physique looks more like a professional athlete, and less like what we'd expect from a 30ish bartender.  But his acting is credible, even if the accent is more Boston than Philly.  The football action sequences achieve maximum heart-pumping in the viewer via lots of closeups, harsh sounds, and rapid camera movements.

For me here is the deal and this film illustrates it very well, when you put on a uniform, you represent something, in this case an NFL team, and more to the point a City. If you act in a way that disrespects the people you represent, you forfeit the right to represent those people.In Invincible, Philadelphia in the mid -seventies is a city beset by hard times, and the Eagles were faring no better.  Vince Papale's life was so symbolic of his home town, you couldn't have made it more so through fiction.

They are extremely loyal, win or lose.  They gather in the cities they've migrated to in groups to watch televised games, usually in some amount of regalia.  I could never understand why.  This movie helped me to understand.*Invincible* paints a rugged picture of Philly.  Tough, working class, often hopeless.  The neighborhood buddies (pallies) are from families that have lived there for generations, and they don't even think of escape.  They're losing their jobs (thanks to unions) and their families, but they are sentenced to live there forever.  The only avenue of escape is football.  It is the glue that holds them together.  It is their identity.They play it on the local dirt lot, they eat sleep and breathe it.  They love their loser Eagles, so representative of their loser lives.  They hope that both will turn around someday.And *hope* is the message of this movie, a true story.  Every character needs hope, though some have it and some don't.The fetching Mrs. Brew (a sports loather) didn't want anything to do with this film.  By the end, she was way hooked, excitedly explaining the story to our son who walked in near the end.  That's because it's not really about football, though it is.One more thing I really appreciated was the courage of the filmmakers to avoid playing into racial issues.  Every veteran professional Eagle hated our hero, regardless of their race.  He was a street amateur taking a job away from one of their own.  I guess nobody's job is safe in Philly.So, gather 'round the tube with your pallies: Mikey, Joey, Davey, Johnnie, Markey, Pauley and Rocky, and dream about the old team, and the old neighborhood you hopefully escaped from.",4,I never liked the Eagles but...,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,1789,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'always', 'noticed', 'Philly', 'fans', 'are', 'kinda', 'Cleveland', 'fans', 'are', 'extremely', 'loyal', 'win', 'lose', 'gather', 'cities', ""'ve"", 'migrated', 'groups', 'watch', 'televised', 'games', 'usually', 'amount', 'regalia', 'could', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'helped', 'understand', '*Invincible*', 'paints', 'rugged', 'picture', 'Philly', 'Tough', 'working', 'class', 'often', 'hopeless', 'neighborhood', 'buddies', 'pallies', 'are', 'families', 'have', 'lived', 'generations', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'escape', ""'re"", 'losing', 'jobs', 'thanks', 'unions', 'families', 'are', 'sentenced', 'live', 'there', 'forever', 'only', 'avenue', 'escape', 'football', 'glue', 'together', 'identity.They', 'play', 'local', 'dirt', 'lot', 'eat', 'sleep', 'breathe', 'love', 'loser', 'Eagles', 'so', 'representative', 'loser', 'lives', 'hope', 'will', 'turn', 'around', 'someday.And', '*hope*', 'message', 'movie', 'true', 'story', 'character', 'hope', 'have', ""don't.The"", 'fetching', 'Mrs', 'Brew', 'sports', 'loather', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'film', 'end', 'was', 'way', 'hooked', 'excitedly', 'explaining', 'story', 'son', 'who', 'walked', 'end', 'not', 'really', 'football', 'more', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciated', 'was', 'courage', 'filmmakers', 'avoid', 'playing', 'racial', 'issues', 'Every', 'veteran', 'professional', 'Eagle', 'hated', 'hero', 'regardless', 'race', 'was', 'street', 'amateur', 'taking', 'job', 'away', 'one', 'own', 'guess', 'nobody', 'job', 'safe', 'Philly.So', 'gather', 'tube', 'pallies', 'Mikey', 'Joey', 'Davey', 'Johnnie', 'Markey', 'Pauley', 'Rocky', 'dream', 'old', 'team', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'hopefully', 'escaped']",N/A
1024820,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000J3OTT6,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","INVINCIBLE, though the title of this very Walt Disney/Hallmark Card docudrama, is a term that could be applied to the plethora of movies built on the stories of down and outers who pull themselves up by the bootstrings due to their success in sports.  Brad Gann is responsible for the script of the life of Vince Papale, a 30ish out of work substitute teacher, deserted husband, depressed South Philly member of a gang of friends who pass the time while jobless playing football in the muddy vacant lots of their part of the world.Vince Papale is played well by Mark Wahlberg, giving a quiet performance of a deeply injured man who manages to finally succeed at something - being chosen by the failing Philadelphia Eagles football team when a new coach  Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) tries a desperate attempt to enliven the team by holding open tryouts.  Vince's friends convince him to make the effort, the bar owners relative Janet (Elizabeth Banks) adds her encouragement as does Vince's father (Kevin Conway).  Of course the obvious happens or the film wouldn't have been made!  Vince becomes an Eagle and soars, not only for himself but also for his father, his friends and his new girl.It is difficult to fault this film: it is also difficult to sift out anything different from all the rest of the films that follow the same formula.  Wahlberg does well, being careful not to allow his physique image to show for fear that the public will continue to think of him as an underwear model instead of an actor.  And the supporting cast is well selected.  There is an audience for these 'sports as king' films and this one has nothing that even kids can't watch. It unfortunately is just repetitive.

1024822,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000J3OTT6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[27, 30]","A few days ago, I heard the real life Vince Papale being interviewed on a sports radio talk show (710AM) and he was personable and sincere enough that I decided right then and there to go see his movie when it releases. In the interview, he spoke quite eloquently of the tough times he'd undergone, his time spent with the Eagles (3 years) and the abuse he took from his scoffing teammates, as well as his relationship with Coach Vermeil. Vince matter-of-factly stated that he was the fastest guy on the Eagles team of '76. He also mentioned Mark Wahlberg in glowing terms, of how he and Mark bonded, and how Mark spent quality time playing with Vince's kid. Like Papale, Mark grew up in a rough neighborhood, so Mark, in his portrayal of Vince, pretty much was acting from close to his roots.It's 1976 in Philly: the spectre of the Vietnam War still hovers, the energy crisis still looms, blue collar Joes are getting laid off en masse, and everyone's hair is just horrible. And, oh yeah, the Eagles suck. Invincible is the true life story of underdog Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), who in 1976 lost his wife and found his school-teaching jobs dwindling, and was then toiling away as a 30-year old bartender. Meanwhile, to shake things up with the going-nowhere Philly football team, new head coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) decides to hold open try-outs. Being a passionate, hard core Philadelphia Eagles fanatic and having played as a wide receiver in a minor league football team, Vince jumps at this chance - and impresses the head coach with his speed and his hard-contact hitting and, most of all, his heart. Vince somehow makes it on the Eagles roster as the oldest rookie ever (not counting kickers; but kickers don't count, anyway) without the benefit of a college football experience.Invincible also parallels Vince Papale's struggles with Dick Vermeil's first baby steps as the coach of the Eagles. With the recent crappy history of the team, Vermeil immediately realized that something fresh was needed to lift up the spirits of the Philly fans, who absolutely expected nothing from the team that season. But, predominantly, this movie covers Papale's arduous trek starting from the against-all-odds open camp try out, thru the brutal training camp, to the regular season's opening game, where the Eagles get whacked by the powerhouse Dallas Cowboys, and, finally, to the Eagles' home opener versus the hated New York Giants, wherein Vince becomes instrumental in the Eagles winning Dick Vermeil his first game as the head coach.This obviously is a star vehicle for Mark Wahlberg, and he brings to the table his compelling street-savvy, average guy grit and charm. He is genuine and heartfelt in this role. Gotta admit, it's been a while now since I thought of him as Marky Mark. He's proven to me, with 3 Kings, The Perfect Storm, The Italian Job, and 4 Brothers, that he's a steadily maturing actor who has some measure of talent and sensitivity. And his physicality comes in very handy in playing the rugged Papale.Greg Kinnear, also another guy I'm starting to take serious as an actor (very good job in The Matador), capably captures Head Coach Vermeil's touchy-feely personality. Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man 1 & 2, Seabiscuit) is nicely enthusiastic and spirited, very beautiful, and is a natural as Vince's love interest Janet. I had a blast with the sequence showing Janet clad in New York Giants wardrobe (she's a big Giants fanatic) entering the Eagles' home stadium amidst clamorous boos. Janet, who is not only sexy but is quite knowledgeable about football, is a guy's dream girl.Invincible makes a point of never letting you forget about Vince's ordinariness and his fish out of water situation by throwing him in several scenes with his regular beer swilling buds as the film progresses. These mugs are rooting for him, yeah, but, at the same time, they want to make sure that he doesn't forget about them should he reach the big time. Meanwhile, Vince's dad is a blend of safe pessimism and hidden hope (""A man can only take so much failure""), leaving his buddy Tommy (Kirk Acevedo), his kindly bar boss Max (Michael Rispoli), and the lovely Janet to be the really steadying rocks in his life.Ericson Core, first time director here and former cinematographer, does a great job catching the inner city ""feel"" of blue collar Philly with camera shots of the city's gritty, grimy streets, alleys, and dives. I bought into the realism of the movie's 1970's setting fairly easily. To watch Vince Papale jog thru the streets of Philly is to instantly think of another sports movie set in the same time, in the same city. Think boxing. The football scenes are fairly intense, with plenty of hard contact, with flesh getting pounded and bones being crunched. Just maybe there's too much slo-mo action.In that interview, Vince Papale pretty much admitted that this movie didn't totally stay true to the facts, that some scenes were prettied up for greater audience consumption. What mattered, he said, was that Invincible did stay true to the spirit of his journey. I'm a sucker for underdog stories (coincidentally, Vince's nickname on the Eagles was Rocky), and knowing that Invincible is based on a true underdog story just whetted my appetite even more. Anyway, I just saw this film and liked it quite a bit. Still, I expect some criticisms to make the rounds centering on the film's too conventional plot and script, that maybe they're too trite and cliched. Me, I don't care. I love football, this is a football movie, and it's acted out with unaffected sincerity and great energy by the leads. Football season's just around the corner, but I figure I just got my fix in earlier.",4,All but Giants fans will root for this one,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,5705,"['few', 'days', 'ago', 'heard',

In 1976, Dick Vermeil leaves his UCLA coaching job and a national college championship team to become head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, plunging himself from the top of the heap right into the toilet.  Eagles fans are furious over the team's losing ways, and scornful of the new young coach.Vermeil decides to hold an open tryout, which ""isn't done"" in the NFL.  He calls it an attention-getter, and it certainly gets attention, most of it mocking.  Meanwhile, Vince Papale, 30, has been fighting some battles himself.  He's an unemployed teacher who's wife has left him.  He tends bar part-time to try to make ends meet, but it's tough in Philly in the '70s.  Vince is poor financially, but rich in friends.  When Vermeil announces the tryouts, his friends talk him into going.  And Vince is chosen to go to training camp.  But he must survive cut after cut.There's some drinking, and of course, some violence in the film, yet it's still gritty.  The soundtrack is a wonderful collection of '70s hits from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Jackson Browne, Grand Funk Railroad, and many more.  It's crisply edited, and the colors are washed out, lending a long time ago feeling that fits the soundtrack.The story is ostensibly about Papale, but both Papale and Vermeil took tremendous risks to attain their achievements.  Papale never would have played NFL football if Vermeil hadn't made such daring choices.This movie is terrific for adults and kids alike.

He's ostracized by regular team members, and even by some of his buddies back in the neighborhood, who fear they'll lose him to the big time. In his first big play, he blows it--but then makes an incredible play in a later game that wins it for the Eagles.

Ironically, when the real life Vince Papale was just going through his transformation in the gritty streets of Philadelphia, Rocky had just come out - and some of his teammates and opponents would tease him by calling him ""Rocky"".The brilliance of getting this on DVD is that you can hear the commentary track with the real Vince Papale giving his insight into what was happening throughout this time. The strikes were pulling the heart out of the locals. Vince's wife walked out on him. The Eagles kept losing. The people of Philly struggled on with a mixture of gut determination and faith.Yes, it's a story of Vince - 30 years old, out of work, out of a relationship, making ends meet by tending bar, getting his one shot at a dream. But it's also the story of the whole area he lives in, how they are being beaten down and they still hang in there. Vince's neighbor invites him in and feeds him pasta. His dad and gang root for him every chance they can. Little kids make up jerseys with Vince's numbers on them.It's funny how, for a sports movie, it actually is much more about the characters. My boyfriend loves football, but I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about the sport. We both really enjoyed watching this together. The soundtrack is gorgeous. The characters are gritty and real. They're not perfect - they're human with character and heart. As much as some Disney movies can feel very sappy, this one is encouraging without going overboard. These are real heartbreaks that happened - real obstacles that were overcome.It's fascinating looking back to what football was like in the 70s. Vince explains that the team rooms really were that tiny - that the streets in Philly are narrow, the homes restrictive. The emotions and experiences were real. Mark Whalberg does most of his own football work here and takes some massive hits. The movie ends with clips of the real Papale and his teammates, turning their team from a losing one to a group that reached the Superbowl.Highly recommended.",5,Definitely One to Have on DVD,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2116,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Rocky', 'then', 'know', 'basic', 'story', 'here', 'brilliance', 'Invincible', 'true', 'Ironically', 'when', 'real', 'life', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'transformation', 'gritty', 'streets', 'Philadelphia', 'Rocky', 'had', 'just', 'come', 'out', 'teammates', 'opponents', 'would', 'tease', 'calling', 'Rocky', '.The', 'brilliance', 'getting', 'DVD', 'can', 'hear', 'commentary', 'track', 'real', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'giving', 'insight', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'time', 'strikes', 'were', 'pulling', 'heart', 'locals', 'Vince', 'wife', 'walked', 'out', 'Eagles', 'kept', 'losing', 'people', 'Philly', 'struggled', 'mixture', 'gut', 'determination', 'faith.Yes', 'story', 'Vince', '30', 'years', 'old', 'work', 'relationship', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'tending', 'bar', 'getting', 'one', 'shot', 'dream', 'also', 'story', 'whole', 'area', 'how', 'are', 'being', 'beaten', 'down', 'still', 'hang', 'there', 'Vince', 'neighbor', 'feeds', 'pasta', 'dad', 'gang', 'root', 'chance', 'can', 'Little', 'kids', 'make', 'up', 'jerseys', 'Vince', 'numbers', 'them.It', 'funny', 'how', 'sports', 'movie', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'boyfriend', 'football', ""'m"", 'not', 'nearly', 'enthusiastic', 'sport', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'together', 'soundtrack', 'gorgeous', 'characters', 'are', 'gritty', 'real', ""'re"", 'not', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'human', 'character', 'heart', 'As', 'much', 'Disney', 'movies', 'can', 'feel', 'very', 'sappy', 'one', 'encouraging', 'going', 'overboard', 'are', 'real', 'heartbreaks', 'happened', 'real', 'obstacles', 'were', 'fascinating', 'looking', 'back', 'what', 'football', 'was', '70s', 'Vince', 'team', 'rooms', 'really', 'were', 'tiny', 'streets', 'Philly', 'are', 'narrow', 'homes', 'restrictive', 'emotions', 'experiences', 'were', 'real', 'Mark', 'Whalberg', 'most', 'own', 'football', 'work', 'here', 'massive', 'hits', 'movie', 'clips', 'real', 'Papale', 'teammates', 'turning', 'team', 'losing', 'one', 'group', 'reached', 'Superbowl.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

He was barely getting by tending bar and keeping himself sane through hard times by playing in a rough touch football team with his buddies. The Eagles have just hired Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) from UCLA with hopes he can turn the team around. Vermeil sets out to shake things up by holding open try-outs at Veteran's Stadium. Encouraged by his friends, Vince gives it a shot and becomes the only person from open try-outs to be invited to Eagles' training camp.Some details in ""Invincible"" are interchanged and embellished to make the drama play better, but the story is essentially true. Vince Papale never played college football, and he became Philadelphia Eagle #83 at the age of 30, eventually Special Teams Captain, until an injury forced his retirement in 1979. ""Invincible"" is cinematographer Ericson Core's first time in the director's chair. Core chose an amber tone for this film, presumably to impart an aged look. The effect is a little heavy at times but generally looks good. Much of the film is shot at night, and the nighttime exteriors are particularly beautiful. Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Vince Papale isn't as boisterous as the real man. But Wahlberg's desperation and emotional accessibility stir the audience's sympathies. Greg Kinnear reminds me a lot of the real Dick Vermeil, and the fact that they are both new to the NFL and need to prove themselves creates an interesting dynamic between Vermeil and Papale.The DVD (Disney 2006): There is one featurette and 2 audio commentaries. ""Becoming Invincible: The Story of Vince Papale"" (25 min) tells the story of the Vince Papale's part in turning the Eagles around through interviews with Papale, Dick Vermeil, former teammates, sportscasters, and others who witnessed the events. It also discusses the genesis of the film in interviews with Ericson Core, the producers, and cast. The first audio commentary is by Vince Papale, producer Mark Giardi, and writer Brad Gann, who take us through the story, characters, and locations. Papale is friendly, forthright and contributes his feelings on the events and people in the film and his observations on the movie set. The second audio commentary is by director Ericson Core and editor Jerry Greenberg, who discuss the scenes' purpose, locations, score, story structure, and the dual nature of the film, i.e. football logistics vs. character drama. This commentary has more about filmmaking and discusses the characters as written as opposed to the real people. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, French, Spanish.

Though I wasn't too sure Mark Walberg was a good fit for this role, I must say, INVINCIBLE greatly exceeded my expectations. This is the best movie Disney has put out in a long time.This is the true story of Vince Papale, who played three years for the Philadelphia Eagles. When coach Dick Vermiel took over the struggling Eagles in 1976, they were coming off a pathetic and disappointing season. Originally intended to rally fan support, Vermeil held open tryouts for the team. No one held realistic expectations that anything would come out of it, but up stepped Vince Papale, an out of work school teacher and part time bartender. This movie accurately tells Papale's story and perpetuates the ""never say can't"" story that professional sports so often provides the backdrop for. Add this to such stories as Rudy, The Rookie, Sea Biscuit, and even a fictional story also based in Philadelphia, Rocky, as another improbable story that overcame the impossible.The movie is exceptionally well cast. Walberg holds his own as Papale and the surrounding cast of Philadelphia blue collar workers is perfect. Greg Kinnear superbly portrays Vermeil, though I really expected to see at least one scene of Vermeil crying in the locker room, which he is notorious for.This is a feel good movie you shouldn't miss.

It had all the right ingredients: a down and out underdog, a down and out team, a down and out town, and sports.

Coach Dick Vermeil takes a huge chance in giving Papale a spot on the roster, and by movie's end, he knows that it's paid off.This is a feel-good film along the lines of Rudy, but with Papale being far less annoying than Rudy Ruettiger. Wahlberg portrays Papale with the quietest confidence, which is sometimes the best kind. He has moments of self doubt that he overcomes by resolving to do his best. That's an excellent lesson for anyone who is trying to pursue what may seem like an impossible dream.Only when Papale literally lets go of the doubts others had about him, his ex-wife specifically, who wrote him a note calling him a loser, is he able to truly fufill the expectations he has for himself and those of his fans.Wahlberg carries this movie to a dandy conclusion, and he is fantastic in it.

Knowing what the Eagles'record was like immediately prior to his (and Head Coach Dick Vermeil's) appearance, it would be very hard to disagree.At the beginning of ""Invincible"", the Eagles are an awful, awful football team.  By the end of the film, everything begins to turn, and the fans in Philadelphia are going nuts!  So what's not to like?I saw this film and went nuts.  In fact, I liked the film ""Invincible""so much, I got the book and quickly read it.  The book ""Invincible"" was just as inspiring, but it gave me a much different picture of Vince Papale.  While many athletes tend to embelish past accomplishments (The older I get, the tougher I was...) Papale is pretty clear in his explanation about how he got to be special teams Captain of the Philadelphia Eagles.  That it mostly had to do with perseverance, stamina, mental toughness, and yes, luck.  It a good read, but that's for another review.Anyway, Papale was physically very tough, but the choice he made for his college education wasn't an NFL breeding ground like Penn State or Notre Dame.  Even though he was recruited to play professional ball in another league, for years the NFL was a distant dream.  What ""Invincible"" the film didn't touch on was that Vince Papale had a great basis of experience to draw upon in order become a very good professional athlete.  And it wasn't just sandlot smashmouth football.Papale's background is something that the film ""Invincible"" doesn't really get very much into.  It can't;  There just wouldn't be enough time for it, and to take a trip though Papale's past athletic struggles would be too complicated for most audiences.  Even though it's very interesting, without all of that, the pace of the movie itself is just about right.  The story unfolds gradually and doesn't drag.Mark Whalberg is a great choice for the part of Vince Papale.  Although he doesn't resemble Papale, Wahlberg can take a character and make him come to life, as he does here, in an ""everyman"" sort of way.  I also really liked Greg Kinnear as Dick Vermeil.  Elizabeth Banks as Janet Cantrell is pretty good too.The soundtrack is period stuff, mainly.  Some of it holds up well (""I Just Want to Celebrate,"" ""Funk, No.49,"" ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love"") and some of it doesn't.  Personally, I don't care if I ever hear ""Free Bird"" again for the rest of my life...Anyway, too bad about the Eagles in 2008.  Close, but no cigar.  At least the kid I saw in the the stands during the playoffs knew what the deal was.

The U.S. was in the grip of a major recession that was hitting the factories of Philadelphia especially hard.  Times were tough and for many people in the area, the Eagles were the only thing they had to look forward to.  Except, for several years, the Eagles had been nothing but one big disappointment.  To change things around, a new coach from UCLA was hired, Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear).  Vermeil is determined to change things around and shake things up.  Part of his plan includes having an open tryout for the team.  Hundreds tryout, but only one is offered the opportunity to come to training camp, Vince Papale.  Papale was an unemployed school teacher working at a bar to make ends meet.  He had never played college football and was 30 years-old.  The cards were stacked against him, but Papale had talent, gumption, and drive.  Vermeil went out on a limb and Papale found himself as #83 for the Eagles as a part of Special Teams.  It was a position that he excelled at and in doing so he gave hope to his family, friends, and Eagles fans everywhere.INVINCIBLE was brought to the screen by the same producers behind MIRACLE and THE ROOKIE and INVINCIBLE shares the same plot structure as both of those movies.  It most resembles MIRACLE in physical setting (both films take place during the same era) while the characterization most resembles THE ROOKIE.  Parts of Papale's life have been embellished and changed, but overall the story in the film is true and accurate.I'm not a very big fan of Mark Wahlberg, but I enjoyed his performance in this film.  In size and stature he is much smaller than the real Vince Papale, but Wahlberg does capture Papale's intensity and passion.  Elizabeth Banks portrays Papale's love interest, Janet Cantrell.  Banks is a rising star and I've enjoyed watching her in every film I've seen of hers (most recently in SLITHER).  I am a fan of Greg Kinnear (late late night tv has never recovered from his departure) and he does an excellent job of portraying Dick Vermeil.Overall, I enjoyed INVINCIBLE.  It is a predictable film, but manages to avoid the major pitfall of sentimentalism and sap that many inspirational movies are guilty of succumbing to.  It's a film that appeals to sports fans everywhere, but especially to Philadelphia Eagles fans.The DVD includes a couple of audio commentaries and a short documentary about Papale's life entitled ""Becoming Invincible:  The Story of Vince Papale"".  The documentary also explains the creation of the movie from the original idea after seeing a special about Papale on tv through the film's release.  I found the documentary interesting, especially because I really wasn't very familiar with Papale before watching INVINCIBLE.",4,"Never Give Up, Never Surrender.",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2834,"['INVINCIBLE', 'movie', 'NFL', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'legendary', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'portrayed', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'U.S.', 'was', 'grip', 'major', 'recession', 'was', 'hitting', 'factories', 'Philadelphia', 'especially', 'hard', 'Times', 'were', 'tough', 'many', 'people', 'area', 'Eagles', 'were', 'only', 'thing', 'had', 'look', 'forward', 'Except', 'several', 'years', 'Eagles', 'had', 'been', 'nothing', 'one', 'big', 'disappointment', 'change', 'things', 'new', 'coach', 'UCLA', 'was', 'hired', 'Dick', 'Vermeil', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Vermeil', 'determined', 'change', 'things', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'Part', 'plan', 'having', 'open', 'tryout', 'team', 'Hundreds', 'only', 'one', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'come', 'training', 'camp', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'Papale', 'was', 'unemployed', 'school', 'teacher', 'working', 'bar', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'had', 'never', 'played', 'college', 'football', 'was', '30', 'years-old', 'cards', 'were', 'stacked', 'Papale', 'had', 'talent', 'gumption', 'drive', 'Vermeil', 'went', 'out', 'limb', 'Papale', 'found', '83', 'Eagles', 'part', 'Special', 'Teams', 'was', 'position', 'excelled', 'doing', 'so', 'gave', 'hope', 'family', 'friends', 'Eagles', 'fans', 'everywhere.INVINCIBLE', 'was', 'brought', 'screen', 'same', 'producers', 'MIRACLE', 'THE', 'ROOKIE', 'INVINCIBLE', 'shares', 'same', 'plot', 'structure', 'movies', 'most', 'resembles', 'MIRACLE', 'physical', 'setting', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'era', 'characterization', 'most', 'ROOKIE', 'Parts', 'Papale', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'embellished', 'changed', 'story', 'film', 'true', 'accurate.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'film', 'size', 'stature', 'much', 'smaller', 'real', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'Wahlberg', 'capture', 'Papale', 'intensity', 'passion', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Papale', 'love', 'interest', 'Janet', 'Cantrell', 'Banks', 'rising', 'star', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hers', 'most', 'recently', 'SLITHER', 'am', 'fan', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'late', 'late', 'night', 'tv', 'never', 'recovered', 'departure', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Dick', 'Vermeil.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'INVINCIBLE', 'predictable', 'film', 'avoid', 'major', 'pitfall', 'sentimentalism', 'sap', 'many', 'inspirational', 'movies', 'are', 'guilty', 'succumbing', 'film', 'appeals', 'sports', 'fans', 'everywhere', 'especially', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', 'DVD', 'couple', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'short', 'documentary', 'Papale', 'life', 'entitled', 'Becoming', 'Invincible', 'Story', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'documentary', 'also', 'creation', 'movie', 'original', 'idea', 'seeing', 'special', 'Papale', 'tv', 'film', 'release', 'found', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'especially', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'familiar', 'Papale', 'watching', 'INVINCIBLE']",N/A

1024894,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000J3OTT6,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[1, 2]","This is a good-looking, amiable film starring Mark Wahlberg in an equally amiable, though understated, performance as South Philly bartender Vince Papale, who became perhaps the best-known walk-on in NFL history. When Coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) takes over the losing Philadelphia Eagles in 1976, he decides to have open tryouts to try and win back the support of the unhappy fans. Against the advice of everyone in his life, 30-year-old Papale tries out and is the only one that makes it. Having only played dirt lot ball since high school, Papale must not only make the jump to pro ball; he must also win the acceptance of his highly skeptical teammates, and he must do all this before he is cut from the team. Vermeil seems to be the only friend Papale has, and he turns out to be a good one. Eventually he builds the team around the rookie, who ends up playing only three seasons.The best thing about this film is the relationship between Vermeil and Papale. More time could have been spent on that. The least interesting aspect is the relationship between Papale and his South Philly football-and-drinking buddies. Less time could have been spent on that. Papale's love interest with female bartender and future wife Janet Cantrell (played by Elizabeth Banks) is interesting but underdeveloped. His relationship with fellow teammates is also interesting and underdeveloped. The biggest letdown in the film is when it ends: after Papale has won his place on the team and has proven his value in a key game, the rest of his career is summed up in a postscript. That is when the story is just getting good. At a mere 104 minutes, twenty more could easily have been devoted to Papale's relationships to wife Janet and Coach Vermeil, and to his contributions to the team. That would have rounded out the story to make a very good film. Instead, the director took the easy way out.One of the better aspects of this film is the fact that it doesn't go overboard trying to reproduce the look of the 70's. The 70's were a very non-descript era (especially in South Philly), and this is reproduced successfully. Naturally, there is the obligatory 70's soundtrack in the background, with songs that are very forgettable. One of the strengths is the striking photography by director-cinematographer Ericson Core (PAYBACK, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS - both as director of photography). He applies a yellow-orange tone to the South Philly scenes and a teal blue tone to the Eagle scenes in order to separate the two disparate worlds. This makes the blue-collar world of South Philly seem old and worn out, and the glamorous world of NFL football seem fresh and new. As the film progresses, he lessens the effect, until the two worlds merge into one, non-tinted look. It may be a bit too self-conscious, but it is striking and gives the film a distinct look. In addition, the game footage is outstanding.This is the latest installment in Disney's series of sports films based on true stories, with family-friendly values, which unfortunately fails to measure up to the rest. THE GREATEST GAME EVERY PLAYED, MIRACLE, THE ROOKIE, and REMEMBER THE TITANS still remain the best of this category, for their inspiring stories, top-notch productions and acting. These sports films, along with Pixar's animated films and Walden Media's classic family films, have once again put Disney at the top of the inspirational-family film market, with films equal to the Disney classics being produced under Walt Disney himself. I hope this trend continues, and that other genres are brought under the Disney banner.Waitsel Smith",3,"ROCKY, RUDY AND GOOD WILL HUNTING ROLLED INTO ONE",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,3605,"['good-looking', 'amiable', 'film', 'starring', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'equally', 'amiable', 'though', 'understated', 'performance', 'South', 'Philly', 'bartender', 'Vince', 'Papale', 'who', 'became', 'perhaps', 'best-known', 'walk-on', 'NFL', 'history', 'When', 'Coach', 'Dick', 'Vermeil', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'losing', 'Philadelphia', 'Eagles', '1976', 'have', 'open', 'tryouts', 'try', 'win', 'back', 'support', 'unhappy', 'fans', 'advice', 'everyone', 'life', '30-year-old', 'Papale', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'Having', 'only', 'played', 'dirt', 'lot', 'ball', 'high', 'school', 'Papale', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'jump', 'pro', 'ball', 'must', 'also', 'win', 'acceptance', 'highly', 'skeptical', 'teammates', 'must', 'do', 'cut', 'team', 'Vermeil', 'be', 'only', 'friend', 'Papale', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'Eventually', 'team', 'rookie', 'who', 'up', 'playing', 'only', 'three', 'seasons.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'relationship', 'Vermeil', 'Papale', 'More', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'least', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'relationship', 'Papale', 'South', 'Philly', 'football-and-drinking', 'buddies', 'Less', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spent', 'Papale', 'love', 'interest', 'female', 'bartender', 'future', 'wife', 'Janet', 'Cantrell', 'played', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'interesting', 'underdeveloped', 'relationship', 'fellow', 'teammates', 'also', 'interesting', 'underdeveloped', 'biggest', 'letdown', 'film', 'when', 'Papale', 'won', 'place', 'team', 'proven', 'value', 'key', 'game', 'rest', 'career', 'summed', 'up', 'postscript', 'when', 'story', 'just', 'getting', 'good', 'mere', '104', 'minutes', 'twenty', 'more', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'devoted', 'Papale', 'relationships', 'wife', 'Janet', 'Coach', 'Vermeil', 'contributions', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'rounded', 'out', 'story', 'make', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Instead', 'director', 'took', 'easy', 'way', 'out.One', 'better', 'aspects', 'film', 'fact', ""n't"", 'go', 'overboard', 'trying', 'reproduce', 'look', '70', '70', 'were', 'very', 'non-descript', 'era', 'especially', 'South', 'Philly', 'reproduced', 'successfully', 'Naturally', 'obligatory', '70', 'soundtrack', 'background', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'forgettable', 'One', 'strengths', 'striking', 'photography', 'director-cinematographer', 'Ericson', 'Core', 'PAYBACK', 'THE', 'FAST', 'AND', 'THE', 'FURIOUS', 'director', 'photography', 'yellow-orange', 'tone', 'South', 'Philly', 'scenes', 'teal', 'blue', 'tone', 'Eagle', 'scenes', 'order', 'separate', 'two', 'disparate', 'worlds', 'blue-collar', 'world', 'South', 'Philly', 'seem', 'old', 'out', 'glamorous', 'world', 'NFL', 'football', 'seem', 'fresh', 'new', 'film', 'effect', 'two', 'worlds', 'merge', 'one', 'non-tinted', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'self-conscious', 'striking', 'film', 'distinct', 'look', 'addition', 'game', 'footage', 'outstanding.This', 'latest', 'installment', 'Disney', 'series', 'sports', 'films', 'based', 'true', 'stories', 'family-friendly', 'values', 'unfortunately', 'measure', 'up', 'rest', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVERY', 'PLAYED', 'MIRACLE', 'THE', 'ROOKIE', 'REMEMBER', 'THE', 'TITANS', 'still', 'remain', 'best', 'category', 'inspiring', 'stories', 'top-notch', 'productions', 'acting', 'sports', 'films', 'Pixar', 'animated', 'films', 'Walden', 'Media', 'classic', 'family', 'films', 'have', 'once', 'again', 'put', 'Disney', 'top', 'inspirational-family', 'film', 'market', 'films', 'equal', 'Disney', 'classics', 'being', 'produced', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'hope', 'trend', 'other', 'genres', 'are', 'brought', 'Disney', 'banner.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
