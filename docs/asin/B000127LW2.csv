790962,A33L7G4E8CID3,B000127LW2,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[1, 1]","I was a huge fan of Voyager in its early years, and this DVD will allow me to re-experience the show's stellar first year. Although it wasn't the show's best, this season (and the show) was a meat-and-potatoes kind of Star Trek that succeeded on its own winsome enthusiasm for the first few years. The show's first season contains good acting and writing, great science-fiction, and introduced some rather long-lived story arcs.Voyager inherited a writing staff from The Next Generation including Trek sci-fi maestro Brannon Braga and heartstring-tugging Jeri Taylor. Along with an impeccably-cast set of talented actors, the show's direction seemed assured from early on. The pilot, ""Caretaker,"" was a spectacular episode: it introduced the central premise of the show, the relationships between the characters, and some of the initial story arcs. Although the first season was a bit light on character exposition, the characters were portrayed intriguingly. The standout here were scene-stealers Robert Picardo and Robert Duncan McNeill as the Doctor and Tom Paris, who got all the show's best lines. McNeill, especially, is perfect as Paris, a mixture of R.P. McMurphy, Marlon Brando, and Ro Laren. The other standout is Martha Hackett as Seska, the Maquis-turned-Starfleet who was a Cardassian spy all along and defects to the Kazon. Hackett plays her with such palpable malevolence, it's just fun to watch. The other characters, though, got their share of time as well.Voyager did a few things well throughout the years, and one of them was that it always had great sci-fi stories. ""Eye of the Needle"", for example, was a neat high-concept episode and mystery rolled into one. Other shows, such as ""Emanations"" and ""Cathexis"" were more science-fiction-metaphysical-type stories dealing with, primarily, death. Not to mention the time-travel mystery ""Time and Again"" and the fantastic ""Ex Post Facto"", where Tom Paris is accused of murder. This season really focused on the science-fiction and delivered splendidly.It was here that we got some rewarding story arcs. The Kazon were the show's bad boys for a time, and they are explored in a few episodes here, culminating with Seska's defection in ""State of Flux"". The Vidiians were introduced in ""Phage"" and were a very interesting concept -- a species whose perpetuation requires extensive organ harvesting. Both aliens would feature prominently in the first three years, and sporadically throughout. There was also the tension between the Maquis and Federation crews, which provided constant drama here.In short, the roots of the show were very impressive indeed. Not only were the writing and acting great, as well as the science-fiction stories, the show served an important function in setting the proverbial table for the seasons that followed. My complaint is that a hundred bucks seems a bit exorbitant, considering that other sets with a full season command the same price, and this one only has half that. Nevertheless, the show took off here with promise.",4,A worthy beginning,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,3020,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Voyager', 'early', 'years', 'DVD', 'will', 'allow', 're-experience', 'show', 'stellar', 'first', 'year', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'meat-and-potatoes', 'kind', 'Star', 'Trek', 'succeeded', 'own', 'winsome', 'enthusiasm', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'contains', 'good', 'acting', 'writing', 'great', 'science-fiction', 'introduced', 'rather', 'long-lived', 'story', 'arcs.Voyager', 'inherited', 'writing', 'staff', 'Next', 'Generation', 'including', 'Trek', 'sci-fi', 'maestro', 'Brannon', 'Braga', 'heartstring-tugging', 'Jeri', 'Taylor', 'impeccably-cast', 'set', 'talented', 'actors', 'show', 'direction', 'seemed', 'assured', 'early', 'pilot', 'Caretaker', 'was', 'spectacular', 'episode', 'introduced', 'central', 'premise', 'show', 'relationships', 'characters', 'initial', 'story', 'arcs', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'light', 'character', 'exposition', 'characters', 'were', 'portrayed', 'intriguingly', 'standout', 'here', 'were', 'scene-stealers', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'Doctor', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'who', 'got', 'show', 'best', 'lines', 'McNeill', 'especially', 'perfect', 'Paris', 'mixture', 'R.P', 'McMurphy', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Ro', 'Laren', 'other', 'standout', 'Martha', 'Hackett', 'Seska', 'Maquis-turned-Starfleet', 'who', 'was', 'Cardassian', 'spy', 'defects', 'Kazon', 'Hackett', 'such', 'palpable', 'malevolence', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'other', 'characters', 'though', 'got', 'share', 'time', 'well.Voyager', 'did', 'few', 'things', 'well', 'years', 'one', 'was', 'always', 'had', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'stories', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'example', 'was', 'neat', 'high-concept', 'episode', 'mystery', 'rolled', 'one', 'Other', 'shows', 'such', 'Emanations', 'Cathexis', 'were', 'more', 'science-fiction-metaphysical-type', 'stories', 'dealing', 'primarily', 'death', 'Not', 'mention', 'time-travel', 'mystery', 'Time', 'Again', 'fantastic', 'Ex', 'Post', 'Facto', 'where', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'accused', 'murder', 'season', 'really', 'focused', 'science-fiction', 'delivered', 'splendidly.It', 'was', 'here', 'got', 'rewarding', 'story', 'arcs', 'Kazon', 'were', 'show', 'bad', 'boys', 'time', 'are', 'explored', 'few', 'episodes', 'here', 'culminating', 'Seska', 'defection', 'State', 'Flux', 'Vidiians', 'were', 'introduced', 'Phage', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'concept', 'species', 'perpetuation', 'extensive', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'aliens', 'would', 'feature', 'prominently', 'first', 'three', 'years', 'sporadically', 'was', 'also', 'tension', 'Maquis', 'Federation', 'crews', 'provided', 'constant', 'drama', 'here.In', 'short', 'roots', 'show', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'indeed', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'writing', 'acting', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'science-fiction', 'stories', 'show', 'served', 'important', 'function', 'setting', 'proverbial', 'table', 'seasons', 'followed', 'complaint', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'bit', 'exorbitant', 'considering', 'other', 'sets', 'full', 'season', 'command', 'same', 'price', 'one', 'only', 'half', 'Nevertheless', 'show', 'took', 'off', 'here', 'promise']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season
790963,ATJEWLLSFLGWQ,B000127LW2,A. Eastwick,"[1, 1]","I'll keep this short, since this was a short season (they deferred several episodes to season 2).  Season 1 is kind of a mixed bag.  The show starts out with a lot of promise, and there is better to come.  However, I think the last couple of episodes are a let-down.  The season definitely ended with a whimper.There were several good episodes, but overall the show does not have the strength that it will in later seasons.  Chiefly among my complaints is that the 2-hour opener is badly paced in some places and some of the plots seem recycled or very generic.  For a show that is supposed to be about being alone with a potentially hostile crew, many of the episodes seemed like they forgot that.What really saves the show is two things.  First, the Holographic Doctor (Robert Picardo) is great.  Second, the show does have a good cast and they really do gel together well.  The first season lays the foundation for things to come, and I have to say that the cast was very good through-out the seven year run.One final comment.  Lower the price since this is 15/16 episodes compared to future seasons!

'The Red Headed Step Child' of the Trek family took a lot of shots for being mediocre retreads of other Trek stories which had to resort to some cosmic eye-candy to pull in new viewers.  Frankly, I think the series has been given the short end of the stick.  The ensemble does a fine job, and its good to see a Trek show visiting 'strange new worlds' once more.  Its great to see Jennifer Lien(Time and Again) again, and Bob Picardo's Doctor is especially comical in this first season(Heros &amp; Demons).  So aces for the episodes found in this collection.  The extras are pretty good, too.  The piece on Captain Bujold is nearly worth the price of admission alone.But speaking of the price...  C'mon Paramount !  You've been slowly dropping the price on the Trek boxed sets, but we're not nearly where we should be.  ESPECIALLY when there are only 15 episodes in this first 'season' of Voyager.  And the packaging is truly horrendous.  I'm sure this was someone's idea of a clever novelty, but its just downright awkward and cheap.  If you're going to ask us to pay upwards of a hundred bucks, at least give us something worthwhile.

790978,APNFSO2RCZ2KD,B000127LW2,"Bloodrider ""Lover of epics""","[0, 1]","As the author of the fantasy epic Bloodspiller I appreciate good sci-fi when I view it.First, I do agree with many fans who say that ALL the dvd box sets are way over-priced. Baylon 5 ( the best sci-fi show of them all )and the equally fantastic Stargate Sg-1 boxsets are much more reasonable in price. However, I am too, a Star Trek fanatic, though I prefer Next Generation as my personal favorite with Voyager as the runner-up. The only problem with Voyager, as was with DS-9, was that it didn't become a great show until its third year. Not until Worf showed up in the former and the lovely 7 of 9 ( my main reason for watching the show )in the latter, did these shows gain an edge. And Voyager had to confiscate the Borg to generate its edge.If they decided to be a little less harmonious, they could have kept heat going by having the two factions, Star Fleet and Maqui ( which was taken from the French underground in WWII )at each others throats a bit longer in the storyline.  Even Janeway took away from Picard the "" foremost expert "" title regarding the Borg. I most enjoyed the Doctor, who with 7 of 9 eventually stole the show and took on the ""Data yearning to be human with Picard as his mentor in human affairs "" relationship. The problem with this show for me, was unlike Next Generation and eventually Ds9, they never really developed the characters in the show, which beyond the Holy Trinity, also happened in the original series. In NG every character changed over the years and became fully three dimensional people, and for this reason I am strongly and emotionally bonded to NG. Voyager ignored the potential of Chokoty, Tuvoc, Kim and others. They at least advanced Belana  and Tom slightly, but in the last three seasons totally concentrated on the Doctor and 7 of 9, almost to the point of shunting aside Janeway. The show in its first two seasons was as spotty  but thank goodness not almost as boring as Enterprise ( which only exists because UPN would be out of business without a Trek show  and demanded one to be aired and thus it's mediocrity ) until they adopted the Borg ( Holy Xindi, Batman! )and found 7 of 9. I  WILL buy the series, however -after passing over Ds9- if only for the pleasure of enjoying the Doctor's antics and to gaze at Jeri Ryan.Frankly, due to her scientific expertise, I don't think they ever would have gotten home....And why is Janeway now an admiral before they made one of Picard? At least he saved civilization dozens of times, and was instrumental in holding together with Worf the Klingon Empire, which if it had fragmented would have destabilized our corner of the galazy. All she did was get lost and luckily find her way home.",3,Old enough to watch Star Trek in 1966 on Thursday nights,1070582400,"12 5, 2003",2003,2692,"['author', 'fantasy', 'Bloodspiller', 'appreciate', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'when', 'view', 'it.First', 'do', 'agree', 'many', 'fans', 'who', 'say', 'dvd', 'box', 'sets', 'are', 'way', 'over-priced', 'Baylon', '5', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'equally', 'fantastic', 'Stargate', 'Sg-1', 'boxsets', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'However', 'am', 'too', 'Star', 'Trek', 'fanatic', 'prefer', 'Next', 'Generation', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Voyager', 'runner-up', 'only', 'problem', 'Voyager', 'was', 'DS-9', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'great', 'show', 'third', 'year', 'Not', 'Worf', 'showed', 'up', 'former', 'lovely', '7', '9', 'main', 'reason', 'watching', 'show', 'latter', 'did', 'shows', 'gain', 'edge', 'Voyager', 'had', 'confiscate', 'Borg', 'generate', 'edge.If', 'decided', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'harmonious', 'could', 'have', 'kept', 'heat', 'going', 'having', 'two', 'factions', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Maqui', 'was', 'taken', 'French', 'underground', 'WWII', 'others', 'throats', 'bit', 'longer', 'storyline', 'Even', 'Janeway', 'took', 'away', 'Picard', 'foremost', 'expert', 'title', 'regarding', 'Borg', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'Doctor', 'who', '7', '9', 'eventually', 'stole', 'show', 'took', 'Data', 'yearning', 'be', 'human', 'Picard', 'mentor', 'human', 'affairs', 'relationship', 'problem', 'show', 'was', 'Next', 'Generation', 'eventually', 'Ds9', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'characters', 'show', 'Holy', 'Trinity', 'also', 'happened', 'original', 'series', 'NG', 'character', 'changed', 'years', 'became', 'fully', 'three', 'dimensional', 'people', 'reason', 'am', 'strongly', 'emotionally', 'bonded', 'NG', 'Voyager', 'ignored', 'potential', 'Chokoty', 'Tuvoc', 'Kim', 'others', 'least', 'advanced', 'Belana', 'Tom', 'slightly', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'totally', 'concentrated', 'Doctor', '7', '9', 'almost', 'point', 'shunting', 'aside', 'Janeway', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'was', 'spotty', 'thank', 'goodness', 'not', 'almost', 'as', 'boring', 'Enterprise', 'only', 'UPN', 'would', 'be', 'business', 'Trek', 'show', 'demanded', 'one', 'be', 'aired', 'thus', 'mediocrity', 'adopted', 'Borg', 'Holy', 'Xindi', 'Batman', 'found', '7', '9', 'WILL', 'buy', 'series', 'however', '-after', 'passing', 'Ds9-', 'only', 'pleasure', 'enjoying', 'Doctor', 'antics', 'gaze', 'Jeri', 'Ryan.Frankly', 'due', 'scientific', 'expertise', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'home', '.And', 'why', 'Janeway', 'now', 'admiral', 'made', 'one', 'Picard', 'least', 'saved', 'civilization', 'dozens', 'times', 'was', 'instrumental', 'holding', 'together', 'Worf', 'Klingon', 'Empire', 'had', 'fragmented', 'would', 'have', 'destabilized', 'corner', 'galazy', 'did', 'was', 'get', 'lost', 'luckily', 'find', 'way', 'home']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season

There has never been any Star Trek that I didn't appreciate, so I liked this series just fine.I own the DVDs of Voyager, and I think they look spectacular. The streaming picture is just OK. It's a bit fuzzy looking, and suffers from the common streaming problem of having movements that sometimes look sluggish.

After watching a couple of the shows stream, I'm keeping the DVDs.This particular pilot was a very unusual start to a Star Trek series. It has two ships being drawn to a VERY remote point of the galaxy, and then suffering calamities that kill many of both crews. The remaining crew of each ship, nominal enemies, must combine and find a way to live and work together if they wish to have a chance to survive and find a way home.

They had an interesting premise but it was not built on and fell into normal &quot;episodic&quot; television in the later seasons. That said, the first season, while short, was one of the series' best.The show starts out with Caretaker, an episode which has many characteristics of the original series. You have exploring &quot;strange new worlds&quot;, a Vulcan officer, a misunderstood alien and those famous &quot;Starfleet morals.&quot;Over the next few episodes, we get to deal with the duality of the crews and the conflict it causes. But it is soon dropped in favor &quot;anomaly or alien of the week.&quot; That isn't a bad thing, but I would have liked to seen more conflict between the crews this season. And the Kazon are one of the most poorly developed enemies that the Trek lore has even seen.There are some outstanding episodes in this season. Prime Factors deals with the reverse effect of the Prime Directive on the crew and features a fiery reprimand scene at the end. Eye of the Needle has Voyager discovering a worm hole to the Alpha Quadrant. And Heroes and Demons features another malfunctioning holodeck with a fresh new idea and great acting from Robert Picardo.The DVD's feature a crisp picture quality and the sound is excellent (Voyager has one of the best theme songs in the entire Trek history). The extras are good and features the original Janeway scenes filmed. You will see why Mulgrew was brought in. The actual case is a major disappointment, because you have to remove an odd plastic covering before getting to the disks. Why couldn't they've copied the design of Babylon 5 or Deep Space Nine?Voyager Season 1 is a good representation of the way the series would unfold. Through its seven seasons, there isn't much character development and they seem the same in Season 7 as they do in this season.

When TNG came out, I felt betrayed because, well, it wasn't Captain Kirk, Spock, Bones and all the other charachters that I grew up watching. Of course after watching TNG I, like most of the fans, saw the brillance in it and continued watching.Well, when DS9 came out I saw it a few times and well, just stopped watching. When Voyager came out I wasn't even interested in seeing it.All this was until 2002. Unfortunately I didn't start catching the show until the last few seasons. Then I saw all the reruns at lease twice; I never missed an episode. After watching the whole series, I would have to say that this is the best Star Trek series. Every charachter is great, the stories are great, and the journey is awesome. This is more like what Star Trek was originally since it's not so scripted; meaning, the crew never knows what's going to happen.In TNG, they were always getting calls and had to go to the Nuetral Zone to save some cat on a tree or whatever, but in Voyager, they are in the Delta quandrant and don't have Starfleet to rely on.This has become my favorite Star Trek series, even beating TNG and the original series. Tuvok by far is the best Vulcan of any Star Trek series (even Spock!), 7 of 9 is awesome (physically too, of course, but I mean her charachter). Belana, Tom Paris, Janeway, the whole crew is just awesome. Even Hector from Night of the Comet has a great role in this! Seriously though, this is an awesome series and a must for any Star Trek fan.After looking over this I realized I am a dork. I never thought about it before, but now I know.

Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its fan base. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. The third spin-off from the original Star Trek series, Star Trek: Voyager premiered in January 1995 to modest critical acclaim, but experienced great success with television viewers, slowly increasing its ratings as the series progressed. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), the series precedes Star Trek: Enterprise (2001) while boasting an all-star cast that includes veteran actress Kate Mulgrew (whose past TV appearances include such shows as Dallas, Cheers, and Murphy Brown). Yet instead of pursuing the classic Star Trek mission to ""boldly go where no one has gone before,"" Star Trek: Voyager is more about going where the crew has been before...Star Trek: Voyager follows the exploits of the crew aboard the starship USS Voyager. As the series begins, the Voyager is on a Federation mission to capture a rogue ship of Maquis rebels (a race first introduced in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine). While in pursuit of the Maquis, the Voyager enters a system known as the badlands, and both ships are instantaneously transported to the Delta Quadrant over seventy-thousand light years away on the outskirts of the galaxy. Soon, both the Maquis and the crew of Voyager learn they were brought to Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker, a mysterious force overseeing the safety of the Ocampan race who live in the shadow on an impending threat from the vicious Kazon. When the Kazon destroy the Maquis ship, the Voyager crew merges with the Maquis crew to defend themselves from the Kazon. Having destroyed the device which could bring them home, the crew of the Voyager - led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), and the crew of the Maquis ship - led by Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), must work as a united front in order to meet their mutual goal of finding a way home...The Star Trek: Voyager (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Caretaker"" in which the Federation starship USS Voyager, led by Capt. Kathryn Janeway, is unexpectedly transported 70,000 light years away while pursuing a band of Maquis rebels through an area known as the badlands. The Voyager's new destination is the Delta Quadrant, an uncharted region of the galaxy overseen by the Caretaker and threatened by the colonial aggression of the Kazon... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Cloud"" in which the Voyager accidentally injures an alien life form while searching for an ingredient to boost its energy supply, and ""Learning Curve"" in which members of Commander Chakotay's ragtag Maquis crew are given a Starfleet Academy tutorial on how to act properly aboard the Voyager...Below is a list of episodes included on the Star

790987,ACVBZF3GK3O45,B000127LW2,C. Davis,"[0, 0]","Bottom Line: This is a solid series and you could do far worse than to watch this series. While not my favorite series in the Star Trek Franchise, I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend to anyone.The original Star Trek was intended as sort of a cross between CAPT Cook's journey of exploration and a western set in space. In many ways, this series is a return to that basic premise. Indeed, the CAPT Cook aspect is pretty strong, the Star ship Voyager is transported in space to a quadrant that will take years, maybe even generations to cross.However, unlike CAPT Cook, CAPT Janeway has a mixed crew.  The mission that resulted in her ship being stranded in the Delta Quadrant involved chasing a group of insurgents that are fighting the Federation over a treaty that resulted in them losing their colonies to an alien empire. As the crew progresses they pick up a few strays as well. A Borg that has been separated from the collective. A survivor from a destroyed planet. Last but not least, Tom Paris, a former Starfleet officer, turned insurgent, turned informer, who finally freed from his father's expectations and his failures, becomes one of the most important crew members.While a part of the crew from the beginning, the ""Doctor"", an Emergency Medical Holographic (EMH) Program, provides the basis for some very important episodes that address the nature of humanity and reality.Seven of Nine (Jenni Ryan),  a de-assimilated borg, becomes a very interesting character as the series progresses. While I suspect that she was introduced as a character to encourage more teen age boys to watch (Jenni Ryan has a fantastic body and they dress her in skin tight cat suites), she becomes a venue for many interesting stories about what it means to be an adult (she was assimilated by the borg as a young girl and is somewhat immature), what it means to be an individual who is also part of a team, and how one builds meaningful relationships with others.Chakotay is the commander of the insurgents. He becomes CAPT Janeway's first officer. As a former Starfleet CDR, one suspects that he might have been senior to CAPT Janeway until he left Starfleet to become an insurgent and she got promoted to CAPT. One also get the idea that other than the adventure of Starfleet, he had rebelled against authority and becoming the ship's executive officer was not an easy transition for him.Many of the early episodes deal with how the Voyager crew finds fuel and food as they cross the Delta Quadrant.  While helpful to the storyline, they aren't always the best episodes. In my humble opinion, the best episodes are in season six.I recommend this series and will probably watch it again in the future.",4,CAPT COOK AS A WOMAN AND IN THE FUTURE,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2700,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'solid', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'worse', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'favorite', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Franchise', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone.The', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'intended', 'sort', 'cross', 'CAPT', 'Cook', 'journey', 'exploration', 'western', 'set', 'space', 'many', 'ways', 'series', 'return', 'basic', 'premise', 'Indeed', 'CAPT', 'Cook', 'aspect', 'pretty', 'strong', 'Star', 'ship', 'Voyager', 'transported', 'space', 'quadrant', 'will', 'take', 'years', 'maybe', 'even', 'generations', 'cross.However', 'CAPT', 'Cook', 'CAPT', 'Janeway', 'mixed', 'crew', 'mission', 'resulted', 'ship', 'being', 'stranded', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'involved', 'chasing', 'group', 'insurgents', 'are', 'fighting', 'Federation', 'treaty', 'resulted', 'losing', 'colonies', 'alien', 'empire', 'crew', 'pick', 'up', 'few', 'strays', 'as', 'well', 'Borg', 'been', 'separated', 'collective', 'survivor', 'destroyed', 'planet', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'former', 'Starfleet', 'officer', 'turned', 'insurgent', 'turned', 'informer', 'who', 'finally', 'freed', 'father', 'expectations', 'failures', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'crew', 'members.While', 'part', 'crew', 'beginning', 'Doctor', 'Emergency', 'Medical', 'Holographic', 'EMH', 'Program', 'basis', 'very', 'important', 'episodes', 'address', 'nature', 'humanity', 'reality.Seven', 'Nine', 'Jenni', 'Ryan', 'de-assimilated', 'borg', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'series', 'suspect', 'was', 'introduced', 'character', 'encourage', 'more', 'teen', 'age', 'watch', 'Jenni', 'Ryan', 'fantastic', 'body', 'dress', 'skin', 'tight', 'cat', 'suites', 'venue', 'many', 'interesting', 'stories', 'what', 'be', 'adult', 'was', 'assimilated', 'borg', 'young', 'girl', 'somewhat', 'immature', 'what', 'be', 'individual', 'who', 'also', 'part', 'team', 'how', 'one', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'others.Chakotay', 'commander', 'insurgents', 'CAPT', 'Janeway', 'first', 'officer', 'former', 'Starfleet', 'CDR', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'senior', 'CAPT', 'Janeway', 'left', 'Starfleet', 'become', 'insurgent', 'got', 'promoted', 'CAPT', 'One', 'also', 'get', 'idea', 'other', 'adventure', 'Starfleet', 'had', 'rebelled', 'authority', 'becoming', 'ship', 'executive', 'officer', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'transition', 'him.Many', 'early', 'episodes', 'deal', 'how', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'fuel', 'food', 'cross', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'helpful', 'storyline', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'episodes', 'humble', 'opinion', 'best', 'episodes', 'are', 'season', 'six.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'future']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season

Personally, I don't think Voyager gains its sea-legs until well into the 3rd and 4th seasons.  Having watched all the Star Trek series religiously, I was disappointed in Voyager ... had high hopes for it especially do to them making the captain a woman.  Plus the Voyager crew was the most diverse Star Trek crew there was with the exception of the original trek:  A female captain, a Native American first officer, A Black Vulcan, A half human half klingon bridge officer ... what more could you ask for you say?  How about better dialog and better acting!  It took a while for these folks to fill their roles.When buying Star Trek DVD's my belief is always that you should buy the whole collection.  Its not complete otherwise ... but don't expect every season to be good.  The gist with TNG, DS9, Voyager and even Enterprise to a lesser extent is that they get better as the seasons progress.

790993,A1FF6KD07OHRFM,B000127LW2,"C. S. Stockwell ""math person""","[3, 3]","I think Voyager is probably my favourite series of the Star Treks.  Something about Janeway, I guess.  I like her leadership style.  I get the feeling that Voyager found its footing much more quickly than the others.The extra clips of the first captain was interesting.  Maybe it's just that I've gotten used to Mulgrew, but the clips made me very glad that it was she who played Janeway eventually.I'm really annoyed, however, that with only 15 episodes the set still costs so much.  I was hoping for some more extras to make up for it.  Yes, Yes, I could have just not bought it, but then I wouldn't have the entire set.  Paramount is terrible in treating their fans this way.  And with this set, they've even really cut back on the packaging.  What I mean is, while the TNG sets came in those nice boxes, the Voyager ones come in a thin plastic case, not even as good as the ones DS9 had.  Not only that, the disks themselves had no design on them like the other series, and once you took off the plastic, there was nothing to protect the top disk.  Yes, I know it seems like a small thing, but people who'd buy these sets are presumably fans who'd want to keep their disks in as great condition as possible.  Especially after they shell out a hundred dollars a season.  This lack of care is one reason why it's lost a star in my rating.But the episodes themselves are great.  With the clarity of the DVD, it's almost like seeing the series in a completely new way.  It's always funny to look at the hairstyles of the first seasons in any of the star treks.

Dent,"[7, 9]","I was there ten years ago on January 16th 1995 as Star Trek Voyager premiered on the new UPN network to alot of press and hype.At The time, Trek was at it's height.TNG first movie Generations was a box office hit,and DS9  was into it's transitional third season.Voyager was important in the fact that it was to launch the UPN network,and most importantly the first Trek series to feature a female captain,Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).The premise of the show was Voyager originally pursuing a ship of Federation freedom fighting outlaws called the Maquis, only for both ships to be swept 70,000 light years away from Federation space.Both crews merged to work together to find a way home which would take seventy-five at maximum warp.The crew included Chakotay (Robert Beltran) the Native American Maquis commander who now serves as Voyager's XO,Tuvok (Tim Russ)the Vulcan chief of security,Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) a former convict now serving as Voyager's pilot,B'Ellana Torres (Roxanne Dawson)half Klingon former Maquis now Chief Engineer,Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) recent Starfleet graduate Ops officer, and""The Doctor"" (Robert Picardo)an emergency medical hologram now the CMO.Also along for the journey are two new members indiginous to the distant Delta Quadrant,Neelix (Ethan Phillips) who serves as ship's cook and guide,and his lover,Kes (Jennifer Lien)an Ocampa who's lifespan is only nine years.After airing probably the best ever Trek pilot ""Caretaker"",the show was an immediate hit,and the rest of the season contained some of the best ever episodes of the entire series,including The Phage(the debut of the organ harvesting Vidiians),Eye Of The Needle (Voyager making contact with a Romulan in the Alpha Quadrent),Prime Factors (the crew being on the opposoing end of the Prime Directive),Heroes and Demons (The Doctor rescues crew members trapped in a holodeck program of Beowulf),and Faces (Torres Klingon side is split from her human half).The most interesting episode is The Cloud.A humorous,delightful episode in which every crew member shines. Space anomoly aside,this episode showed more depth to the crew in one episode than the entire seven years.Originally,twenty episodes were filmed,but four were held for the second season.Although Voyager's quality was random in the later seasons,season one reminded us why we stayed with the show through thick and thin.",5,Star Trek Voyager Season One,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,2392,"['was', 'there', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'January', '16th', '1995', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'premiered', 'new', 'UPN', 'network', 'alot', 'press', 'hype.At', 'time', 'Trek', 'was', 'height.TNG', 'first', 'movie', 'Generations', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'DS9', 'was', 'transitional', 'third', 'season.Voyager', 'was', 'important', 'fact', 'was', 'launch', 'UPN', 'network', 'most', 'importantly', 'first', 'Trek', 'series', 'feature', 'female', 'captain', 'Kathryn', 'Janeway', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', '.The', 'premise', 'show', 'was', 'Voyager', 'originally', 'pursuing', 'ship', 'Federation', 'freedom', 'fighting', 'outlaws', 'called', 'Maquis', 'only', 'ships', 'be', 'swept', '70,000', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'Federation', 'crews', 'merged', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'would', 'take', 'seventy-five', 'maximum', 'warp.The', 'crew', 'included', 'Chakotay', 'Robert', 'Beltran', 'Native', 'American', 'Maquis', 'commander', 'who', 'now', 'Voyager', 'XO', 'Tuvok', 'Tim', 'Russ', 'Vulcan', 'chief', 'security', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'former', 'convict', 'now', 'serving', 'Voyager', 'pilot', ""B'Ellana"", 'Torres', 'Roxanne', 'Dawson', 'half', 'Klingon', 'former', 'Maquis', 'now', 'Chief', 'Engineer', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'Garrett', 'Wang', 'recent', 'Starfleet', 'graduate', 'Ops', 'officer', 'Doctor', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'emergency', 'medical', 'hologram', 'now', 'CMO.Also', 'journey', 'are', 'two', 'new', 'members', 'indiginous', 'distant', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'Neelix', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'who', 'ship', 'cook', 'guide', 'lover', 'Kes', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'Ocampa', 'who', 'lifespan', 'only', 'nine', 'years.After', 'airing', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'Trek', 'pilot', 'Caretaker', 'show', 'was', 'immediate', 'hit', 'rest', 'season', 'contained', 'best', 'ever', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'including', 'Phage', 'debut', 'organ', 'harvesting', 'Vidiians', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'Voyager', 'making', 'contact', 'Romulan', 'Alpha', 'Quadrent', 'Prime', 'Factors', 'crew', 'being', 'opposoing', 'end', 'Prime', 'Directive', 'Heroes', 'Demons', 'Doctor', 'rescues', 'crew', 'members', 'trapped', 'holodeck', 'program', 'Beowulf', 'Faces', 'Torres', 'Klingon', 'side', 'split', 'human', 'half', 'most', 'interesting', 'episode', 'Cloud.A', 'humorous', 'delightful', 'episode', 'crew', 'member', 'shines', 'Space', 'anomoly', 'aside', 'episode', 'showed', 'more', 'depth', 'crew', 'one', 'episode', 'entire', 'seven', 'years.Originally', 'twenty', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'four', 'were', 'held', 'second', 'season.Although', 'Voyager', 'quality', 'was', 'random', 'later', 'seasons', 'season', 'one', 'reminded', 'why', 'stayed', 'show', 'thick', 'thin']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season

791002,A1KZ93IQ774KR0,B000127LW2,"D. O'Neill ""Brunt, FCC""","[11, 22]","Voyager's concept was to show what would happen to a crew stranded far from home, away from the protection of Starfleet and the Federation, with a crew made up of politically correct Starfleet officers and survivors of defiant Federation constituents. Before her mission can begin, the crew is swept the crew 70, 000 light years away, into the uncharted space of the Delta Quadrant. But from the beginning, it seemed Voyager was doomed. While the series was a return to TOS old fashioned naval romance, it had a dangerous corporate utopian view that I was unable to overlook. That said, however, the opener was not half-bad, and it set up many, many story ideas that could have been expounded on. One might have been the mixing of the Starfleet crew and the Maquis crew -a strong criticism of the show has been the lack of tension between the Starfleet and Maquis crews, something which many thought should have been explored in much more detail. Or Tom's voyage from a misguided youth to redemption (something that was covered a bit in season' one and two- all part of a plan to discover who was sending transmissions to the Kazon, and then oddly picked up again in season five -which by then seemed out of character), to the plight of Harry as always an ensign and never anything more How about Tuvok, who must deal with Chakotay as his commanding officer (one guessed that Tuvok was a full commander during the pilot, and somehow was demoted). But all of that was quickly brushed aside like so much dead leaves under the TNG's jingoistic notion that we were all one, big happy family. They took away the conflict, which was odd, considering that during TNG's run, most critics agreed that its biggest problem was that was too little conflict between the characters. Voyager returned to TOS (and TNG somewhat) of episodic story telling. The only real arc to the series would be them lost in the Delta Quadrant. The issue from the start, whether from the Paramount executives or Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, was that the show should remain self-contained. So with Voyager, the show was designed not for the fans of either TNG or DS9, but for the causal fan; for the viewer who could not remember the show was on week-to-week, the ""absentee viewer"" as someone once put it. So the story telling of DS9 was replaced, because those themes were ""too lofty for a (show like Voyager's) broad-based audience,"" as Michael Piller put it in an interview with the official Star Trek website. That locution, in particular, has become an over used catch phrase, which can easily be translated as straight, white males So continuity and the Prime Directive (one of my favorite examples comes in a line written Braga, the worst of the lot when it came to the Prime Directive, in the episode Prototype, where Janeway spouts something about who are we to play God and then continue on our way? The only answer, of course, was the crew of Voyager. It would only get worst as the series progressed) were tossed out airlock with the baby water, all in the name of telling a story. As the first season progressed, it wobbled, it sank, it rose, and it shifted its concept like sand in a desert. It introduced two very inferior alien enemies, the Kazon and the Vidiian's. Both failed because they weren't sinister enough to scare a cockroach back into its dark corner. The Kazon, who where to be based on L.A. gangs, were just a bunch of petulant children who had cool ships, but were always fighting to find out which sect would rule. And despite the Seska/Culluh alliance, they never were more menacing than stock TV villains. The Vidiian's, while creepy, were mishandled. Besides they weren't really evil, they just did appalling things in pursuance of their goals (and might I add here's where a continuity expert should have been hired. In Phage, Janeway makes it perfectly clear that if the Vidiians interfere with them again, she'll open a can of whoop ass on them. Alas, when they pop up again in Faces, nothing happens to them). So, these two were not the Klingons or the Cardassians. They were just boring. So, the first season limped along like a cart with a misalign wheels. And while most of the acting was good outside of Mulgrew's, the stories lacked real originality, filled with terminally uninteresting characters, and featured way to much technobabble, with Time and Again being one of the most well known episodes to go overboard using it. Most of the stories seemed to be hobbled together from other concepts; as if Piller, Berman and Braga took all the stories they had not used on TNG and DS9 and tried to make them some how work on Voyager. But proposing the same flawed ideas over and over again was not making the show good. Only Eye of the Needle and Jetrel can be said to be one of the best of the first season, and while I enjoyed Emanations (because it will become a rare treat to watch Garrett Wang at the center of a story), the rest of season lacked a certain quality.",3,Berman's Evil Empire,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,4980,"['Voyager', 'concept', 'was', 'show', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'crew', 'stranded',

That's what made Voyager such a refreshing change from the normal & sometimes boring milleu of Klingons & Cardassians & Romulans & Vulcans & and Federation political correctness & such.

However, Voyager just never rose beyond a mediocrity. The whole premise was that the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from home, but we never actually see any implications of this. There is almost no tension amongst the crew, no divisions, no infighting. Starfleet discipline is maintained even when it doesn't make sense. Very few families or deep relationships forming, something absolutely impossible in such close quarters. The show could have gone off in an interesting direction, but instead became a more action-oriented Next Generation.Given that the producers decided to take the show in an episodic rather than serial format, the show needed something other than the plotline to make it interesting. However, the crew is for the most part an utterly boring bunch. Katherine Janeway is fine as the ship's captain, emanating a motherly concern for the crew, but can't hold a candle to Captains Picard or Sisko. The holographic doctor is ironically the most interesting and entertaining character. He provides much-needed humor. However, the rest of the crew shows little to no character development. They're usually relegated to restating the obvious.Voyager was partly a victim of more cynical viewer attitudes in the late 1990s and the rise of reality TV.

In between the end of the Next Generation and in the middle of Deep Space Nine, Rick Berman and company decided to go for another series.They really didn't know what they wanted initially other than they wanted to make it different than the other ST series (this on the Special Features on Disc 5). However borrowing on the environment of the Next Generation they decided to make another program based on the experience of a crew aboard a starship. The major plot of the show is that they were trying to get back home after being pushed several thousands of light years away.The DVD box set by Paramount is simply superb!!! They did NOT dropped the ball on anything at all. The case is wonderfully animated with the picture of the ship.  The case is very small and compact. The DVD's look like they were restored and the Special Features on the disc are enough to keep any Trekkie happy.Of course my favorites episode would be ""Caretaker"" , ""Phage"" which introduces the organ stealing Vidiians, ""Ex Post Facto"" which had a slice of a murder mystery feeling to it, ""Heroes and Demons"", and ""Cathexis"" to name a few.The chemistry between the actors was great and everyone seems to have a favorite mine was Jenway , Tom Paris, and B'Elanna.

Bujold was a fine actress but really too old for the part and she has no energy whatsoever.The Special Features go into detail including a feature on Kate's preparation for the role by studying Patrick Stewart's performing of Luc Picard in the TNG.As for the bellyaching that the sets are too expensive apparently no one has heard of Ebay?

This season gave Voyager a bad reputation that it REALLY had to work hard to overcome. For example, if I'm not mistaken, this season contains the episode where the ship escapes through a ""hole"" in some object's gravity well. Anyone who is familiar with basic Newtonian physics should realize that this concept is so colossally stupid, it's a miracle that this show ever got the thumbs-up from KBHK (now UPN). The acting was pretty horrible, too. And in the season's gripping cliffhanger finale, Tuvok helps bridge the gap between the Maquis and the rest of the crew by berating the Maquis for their attire, and the ship is threatened by none other than Neelix's bad cooking. While in later seasons Neelix and his questionable culinary skills would prove time and again to be life-threatening for the crew, such stupid plot devices were never used for finales.

791032,A1AIRJRJQCNU5L,B000127LW2,"jackbauerfan ""jack""","[5, 10]","Bashing Voyager is pretty much the national pastime as far as Trek is concerned.  People warned me away from this show for years.  My thinking was ""how bad could it be?  It was on the air for seven seasons without getting cancelled.""  After seeing this season, my question is ""Why didn't it get cancelled?  The writing is some of the worst I've ever seen in my life.  It was almost like they were trying to write a bad plot in every episode.  I don't like too many of the characters that much, except for the Doctor.  Janeway is a worse captain than the Enterprise-B captain from Generations.Okay, let me start at the beginning.  The new U.S.S. Voyager and a Maquis ship get caught in some kind of nexus-like thing and are transported to the delta quadrant.  They find some guy called the caretaker who transports ships to himself....for some reason.  They find the Caretaker and have the opportunity to use his technology to get back home, but no.  Janeway says they have to destroy the array because they have to keep it from being used by the Kazon.  Which, without question, goes against the prime directive.  You know, that federation law, which says we aren't allowed to interfere in other cultures?  Janeway says that ""We're already involved"" and blows the array to bits.  If she absolutely had to destroy the array, why didn't she stay behind and do it herself?  Or make a fuse or something.  But no, Janeway did what she does best.  She took a situation with a fairly obvious solution and instead of going with that solution, she followed the solution that was the most idiotic.  She continues to do that throughout the season.  I'm not a big fan of the thing with Voyager being stranded far from home.  I don't see why this is any different from TOS or TNG where they're out exploring the unknown.  They're doing the exact same thing here, except they are also trying to find a way to get home.  This is supposed to make the series new and exciting, but to me it just made it worse.  Because we're going to have all these ""will voyager make it home"" episodes.  And since it isn't the series finale, we know they aren't going to make it home.  Not yet, anyway.  In a way, this almost makes the series depressing, because we know these morons are going to have to spend the next seven years with each other.Along those lines, let me talk about the characters.  As I said earlier, I love the Doctor.  Picardo steals every scene he is in, with his horrible bedside manner and his sarcasm.  But other than him, there's almost no character I like.  There were some characters I thought were okay.  Kes is supposed to be this sweet, likeable character that everyone likes.  And she is, except when she's annoying about it.  She cares about the doctor, and wants to make him as comfortable as possible.  Why?  He's a hologram, nothing more.  He's not someone who needs to be comforted or cuddled.  Kes is sweet, yes, but moronically so.  Tuvok was okay, I guess.  He's really nothing more than your standard Vulcan.  There really isn't anything about him that makes him any different than Spock.  Except that he's a lot less interesting than Spock.  It was like they had to come up with an idea for a new character, and they were tired so they said ""Why don't we just throw a Vulcan into the mix?  We haven't had a Vulcan in the last two shows.""  The thing is, I think most Vulcans are kind of bland.  All they do is repeat ""logic"" and ""no emotion"".  What made Spock so interesting was the fact that he is half-human, and strives to constantly keep his human side in check.  But other than him, I don't find most Vulcans very interesting.  And Tuvok is no exception.  Torres is okay, but why is it that almost every Trek series has to have a crew member of a mixed race?  It's been done before.  Except now we get a half-human, half-klingon chick.  She has to struggle to keep her klingon side in check, blah blah blah........like I said, we've seen this before.  It's already been done, and done better.  The last character I didn't hate is Chakotay.  He isn't a great character, to say the least.  And he seems to have a crush on Janeway, since he goes along with every retarded plan she comes up with.  But I found his character to be somewhat interesting.  Although sometimes they get a little bit racist with his animal guide stuff.I hate Harry Kim and Tom Paris.  I thought Tom's background was kind of interesting, but he is by far the worst actor on this show.  And that's saying something.  Whenever he delivers a well-written line (which isn't often given the writing) it backfires because the guy simply cannot act.  He's horrible.  The guy who plays Harry Kim is not much better, but the problems I have with his character are more the writing than the bad performance.  Harry Kim is the nerd that you knew in high school who always got stuffed in a locker by the jocks.  He's the butt of every joke, and I wish they would just kill him off already and put him out of his misery.  But the two worst characters in this show by far are Janeway and Neelix.  The sad thing is, neither one of these actors are bad.  Both of them are decent actors.  But their characters are written so badly.  Let's start with Neelix.  Neelix is more annoying than Jar Jar Binks and Wesley Crusher combined.  He weasel's his way onto the ship first as a guide, and then as morale officer.  He imposes his authority over everyone, including Janeway.  And you want to know the most infuriating part of all this?  Everyone goes along with it!!  The only one who ever takes a stand against this jerk is Seska, and she's evil.  And since she also hates Janeway for getting them lost in the first place....I might be in love with her.  Along those lines, Janeway is a horrible captain.  She faces any problem, big or small, and does the following.  She searches for the most destructive, painful solution that will probably be the most destructive and cause the biggest loss of life.  And she always has to go out of her way to get all these worthless people onto the ship.  Like when she got Tom Paris out of the penal colony to come with them on the mission, for absolutely no reason.  And why does she integrate the Maquis into the Voyager crew?  Why not do what any sensible captain would do and throw them in the brig?  She puts Chakotay, a renegade, in the first officer position, rather than Tuvok, who has had starfleet training and is the second officer.Another problem this show has is the lack of effective villians.  The two groups of villians are the Kazon and the Viidians.  The Kazon are a joke.  They are complete and utter morons.  The Viidians are kind of interesting, because they're not necessarily bad.  They're just doing what they have to to survive.  But just like the Kazon, they are not very smart.  The only villian I liked was Seska.  The reason she is so effective is because she's so smart.  Or it could be that she looks smart when compared to the Kazon and the Viidians.  Voyager is a bad show, because both the writing and the characters are horrible.  How this crap ran for seven seasons is beyond me.  But I've said all that to say this:  I actually found myself enjoying this show.  It's one of the worst things I've ever seen, but for some reason I like it.  A lot of the episodes had crappy storylines, but only because they didn't make good use of what they had.  They would have an interesting idea, and then dump bad writing or cliches on top of that.  This was not a good season, but it was at least better than season one of TNG.  Man, that season was the textbook definition of bad Science Fiction.  And TNG eventually did develop into a very good series.  Maybe I'll find the later seasons of Voyager enjoyable too.",2,This is terrible.....for some reason I like it anyway,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,7746,"['Bashing', 'Voyager', 'pretty', 'much',

Clearly the best series of the Star Trek franchise, due in large part to an outstanding cast, led by the great Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway. In Season One, we meet the crew as they are thrust into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light years from Earth, and watch two ships of enemies, Star Fleet and Marquis, band together to begin thier perilous journey home.

For me the best episodes for Season One was Caretaker because it introduces the series, the characters, and how two space vessels would wind up deep in the delta quadrant some 70,000 light years away from Earth. The second good episode was Parallax. Here we see how the Federation and Maquis crews are intergrated into one crew that will function really well together throughout the series.Also what sets this series apart from the other Star Trek series is the selection of a female captain-Kathryn Janeway. Throughout the series I would come to love her as the captain and she was a good one. I would have no problem serving under her and this is coming from someone who served in the military,There is a book that describes all the major characters. It gets into their life history to include events that leads to how they would wind up on Voyager. the book is titled Star Trek Voyager Pathways. If one wants to learn more about the major characters this book is worth checking out.As for the packaging it's not bad. Each disc is in it's own compartment.

Even this first season, when (like most ""Trek"" shows) it was still finding its footing, ""Voyager"" was pretty entertaining.  Heck, right out of the box, Jerry Goldsmith's theme alone was gold.And, like all TV on DVD, don't underestimate the ""commercial-less"" effect: while a truly bad episode of something will always be a truly bad episode, episodes of ""Voyager"" I remember as being mediocre when they were first broadcast now flow better and entertain better now that all the dumb commercials have been removed.  So, episodes I rated in the past as two-star quality now feel like three-star episodes; episodes I remember as rating three-stars before now often feel like three-and-a-half or even four star shows, etc.  It's amazing.But I do agree with the other reviewers that this series' various season-length sets still cost too much.

But how did they get there and why were they there?Parallax - Voyager encounters and area of space with heavy spatial distortions where they come across a ship that is trapped in the event horizon of a collapsed star.  Voyager unsuccessfully tries to rescue the ship but can't by itself and speeds off to try to find help.  But as they head away from the star they realise they're heading right back to it! They must come up with a plan to escape from this anomoly.Time and Again - While investigating the source of a disasterous shockwave encountered by Voyager, memers of the crew are transported back in time to the day before the shockwave was created.  Trying to get back to their ship before the disaster occurs, they encounter a group of protesters outside a government polaric ion power station who plan on destroying the facility. One of the worst Voyager characters, Kes, plays an important role in this mission with her ""latent Ocampan psychic abilities.""Disc 2:Phage - During an away mission, the other weak character from Voyager (but still better than Kes), Neelix is attacked and apparently killed.  When found by his crewmates it was discovered that his lungs had been removed. The Doctor is able to implant holographic lungs that keep him alive but confined to sick bay.  Another away mission is sent to find out what happened and they discover a medical lab full of organs from different species.  Just then Voyager detects an alien vessel leaving orbit and Voyager takes off in pursuit.The Cloud - Voyager explores a nebula rich in omicron particles, which might prove useful for the ship's energy reserves. But when Voyager enters the nebula, it encounters an energy barrier that brings the ship to a dead stop. Breaking through, the ship continues its penetration of the nebula and are attacked by organisims that attach themselves to the hull and begin draining energy from Voyager...Eye of the Needle - Voyager encounters a wormhole that might take them back to the alpha quadrant but it's too small for the entire ship to enter so a probe is sent through.  The probe gets stuck in a gravitational anomoly before making it through but is being scanned by someone on the other side of the wormhole.  Janeway orders a message be sent via the probe and the receive a reply from the aplha quadrant...Ex Post Facto - While on an away mission assiting a scientist repair some equiment on the Banean homeworld, Paris was convicted of the murder of the scientist and his punishment is to relive the crime from his victim's perspective every 14 hours.  Janeway sets out to discover what happened.Disc 3:Emanations - Chakotay, Kim and Torres beam down to a cavern in an asteroid and discover what appears to be an alien burial ground.  While taking sensor readings, a ""dimensional distortion"" forms and beings to fill the cavern. The away teams beams back to Voyager but Kim isn't transported back - in his place is the body of a deceased alien.Prime Factors - The crew takes some R&R; on a planet full of hospitality.  There they discover the inhabitants have a device that can fold space, allowing travel to places even as remote as 40,000 light years away.  This could be the crew's chance to get back to Earth.  But will the Prime Directive prevent obtaining it?State of Flux - While searching for food on a planet, a Kazon ship is detected in orbit.  After a brief conflict between away teams the Voyager crew makes it back safely and breaks orbit.  A few days later a Kazon distress signal is received and Janeway feels obligated to respond.  It turns out to be the same Kazon ship encountered in orbit at the planet they just visted and there is only one surviving member of the Kazon crew. The weapon signatures indicate Federation technology was used in the destruction, but how?  While investigating the cause of the destruction, another Kazon vessel arrives in response to the distress signal...Heroes and Demons - Ensign Kim in trapped in a holodeck simulation of Beowulf during a freak accident involving beaming samples of a protostar onto Voyager.  Tuvok and Chakotay ""disappear"" when sent in to try and bring Kim out and the captain won't risk any more humans so she sends the Doctor in to save the missing crew memembers.Disc 4:Cathexis - Tuvok and Chakotay are attacked in a shuttlecraft by an unknown entity that drains the bio-neural energy from the Chakotay's brain.  Upon recovering on Voyager, members of the crew being to act strangely - Paris alters the ship's course without knowing or remembering had had done so and Torres initiates a warp core shutdown without knowing it.  Examinations by the Doctor reveal alien entity had seized control of their minds to force them to do these things.  Janeway transfers all command and control functions to the only non-organic crew member, the Doctor, as a precaution while they investigate what's happening.Faces - When members of an away team disappear on a planet, another away team is sent to investigate.  They locate the other team in a cave but can't penitrate a force field protecting the cave.  One member of the missing away team is Torres and it becomes obvious that she's part of an experiment when suddenly there is an all-Klingon Torres and an all-human Torres.Jetrel - Neelix is surprised when a Haakonian scientist responsible for the conquest of Neelix's homeworld suddenly wants to meet with Neelix.  Apparently, this scientist and Neelix were both exposed to high levels of metreon isotopes which endanger the lives of all members of both species.  The Haakonian has only days to live and wants to take blood samples from Neelix and use Voyager's technology to work on a cure for both races.  But is this is true intent?Learning Curve - When a member of the crew from the original Maquis crew disrupts the ship's power by making an unauthorized repair, Janeway decides the Maquis crew members need formalized Starfleet training and tasks Tuvok with the job.  Tuvok's unemotional drill-camp begins to put the ""cadets"" on the verge of rebellion while the ship's bio-gel packs begin suffering from a disease that must be eradicated before spreading to all of the ship's systems.Disc 5:Special Features - The typical mix of actor interviews and ""how did they do that"" special effects segments.",4,Voyager finally comes to DVD!,1069459200,"11 22,

Sure OS and TNG (and most shows for that matter) have their key cast they focus on.

With this great first season, Voyager isn't struggling to establish a series or establish a framework to work within, that's already been set up both those two other exceptional series.Voyager's first season albeit a short one, does a wonderful job of establishing the premise of the series and establishing the characters that will inhabit the imaginations of fans for the next seven years.  One of the better aspects of this season is it doesn't suffer from some of the mistakes made during the second season as in that season they concentrated a little too heavily on the Kazon, which for most fans was a major detractor as I know I was and most fans were asking, when are they ever going to get out of and away from Kazon space.Of interest to me about this first season and the series as a whole is the series producer's perfect decision to captain this new vessel with a strong female character in Captain Kathryn Janeway, which was a welcome decision that was a long time coming but a definitive eventuality.The characters of Star Trek Voyager:Captain Kathryn Janeway - Played brilliantly by Kate Mulgrew, Janeway is a strong and brilliant engineer and sciences minded commanding officer.  Among her strongest features is also her principles which lead her to the decision to save the Ocampa by destroying the Caretaker's array in the premiere episode which results in stranding her crew and the crew of the Maquis ship in the Delta Quadrant with a 70,000 light year trip home to which she vows to her newly combined crew that she will get them home...  After watching the special feature with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway, one simply cannot imagine her having been in this role!Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran) - Maquis leader and former Starfleet officer; he is a member of a Native American tribe which relocated to what later became the DMZ between the Federation and the Cardassians.  When the treaty went bad for his homeworld, he left Starfleet to fight with the Maquis.  As Janeway's first officer, he must tread the thin line between Maquis principles and rigid Starfleet codes.Lieutenant Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ) - Vulcan Starfleet security officer who is well aged and to whom many aboard Voyager but especially B'Elanna look upon as a mentor.  Without his counsel, Janeway would be lost.Lieutenant Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill) - Former Starfleet officer that ran into trouble and fled to the Maquis only to end up in a Starfleet prison.  He is a superior pilot and helms Voyager through thick and thin.  This is the Captain Kirk of the crew when it comes to womanizing...Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang) - Fresh from Starfleet Academy; at the outset of the series he is very green in the role of operations officer but look for this character to mature rapidly when faced with everything the crew must face in their journey home.Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) - Half Klingon and half Human former Maquis now Chief Engineer.  Until Seven of Nine shows up, look to this character for some of the strongest non Janeway stories as she continues to struggle between her Klingon and Human sides to achieve some form of inner peace.The Doctor (Robert Picardo) - Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH Mark I).  Look for this character to provide some of the most poignant and hilarious scenes throughout the seven year run.Neelix (Ethan Phillips) - A Talaxian who helps Janeway during &quot;Caretaker&quot; and along with Kes becomes members of Voyager's crew.  This character will most certainly provide some of the most memorable episodes throughout the series run as he takes on the roles of Ambassador, Head Cook and Morale officer.Kes (Jennifer Lien) - Ocampan who is rescued during &quot;Caretaker&quot; and is, at the outset of the series, Neelix's companion.  During her short time on Voyager she takes on the role as the Doctor's assistant.  The Ocampan's only live for nine years but her part only lasts for three years as she joins the Denise Crosby and Terry Farrell club.Standout episodes:Caretaker - I list this one as it does, as a premier episode, a great job of introducing the series even that much more so than the premier episodes of TNG and DS9.Emanations - This is a highly intriguing episode which goes where few Star Trek episodes dare to go, into &quot;religion&quot; and the afterlife.Heroes and Demons - This episode does a wonderful job of establishing itself and future episodes in which the Doctor will be the prime player.Faces - This is an extremely fascinating episode that does a superior job in establishing some of B'Elanna's back story while telling a poignant tale.Jetrel - This is an extremely poignant story about Neelix and the destruction of his home world's moon during a costly war in which the Talaxian's enemy used a weapon of mass destruction.I highly recommend this series to any and all fans of good Sci-Fi from the universe of Star Trek.  This is a great series that should be given a chance by all fans of Star Trek.  {ssintrepid}Episode List:CaretakerParallaxTime and AgainPhageThe CloudEye of the NeedleEx Post FactoEmanationsPrime

791060,A2YWEG35UMPBJ3,B000127LW2,"L. Harris ""skytag""","[20, 26]","I wish I could review these discs, but I can't even think about paying what Paramount is charging for them. The reviews are interesting, though. There are the worshippers, the people who think Voyager/Star Trek/Paramount is so wonderful they'd gladly fork over $200/season for handful of discs with no extras served up in a manila envelope, and claim that isn't a problem because they know how to use a manila envelope. Those are the true fans -- short for fanatics. Then there are the folks who have the presence of mind (can you tell which group I'm in?) to notice that Paramount consistently provides Star Trek fans with the lamest series sets in the industry for some of the highest prices, simply because the worshippers have shown Paramount they can get away with it. In the middle are the sheep, the people who realize Paramount is ripping them off, but they pay through the nose because they can't fathom *not* owning ST on DVD or they're afraid that if a series doesn't sell well, Paramount will stop releasing ST on DVD (like *that* would ever happen).TNG, DS9, and now Voyager are some of the most expensive TV sets you can buy, and with pathetic features. Stargate SG-1 runs about $25/season here at Amazon.com for 22 episodes vs. $90 for Voyager with 16 episodes. Babylon 5 runs $24/season for 22 episodes. X-Files now runs $20-40/season depending if it's on sale or now. The list of TV shows that are less expensive with more features goes on and on. The shows that are more expensive you could count on one hand.If I'm not mistaken, we now have 18 seasons of ST on DVD (3 TOS, 7 TNG, 7 DS9, and 1 Voyager), and not one episode has an audio commentary as far as I know. Packaging gets cheaper with each successive series as Paramount tests the fans to see just what they'll tolerate. And now it seems Paramount, having little left to cheap out on, has stooped to giving people (including the worshippers) the worst quality control fiasco I've ever heard of in TV DVD seasons for any show. Missing discs and multiple copies of the same disc in a set? How much more will it take to prove to some people how much Paramount takes ST fans for granted?Go ahead, buy these sets. But if you do, don't be surprised if when Enterprise comes out on DVD you get six discs wrapped up in Saran Wrap. Just kidding of course, Handi Wrap is cheaper than Saran Wrap.Oh, as for the series, I thought it was mediocre. Watchable, but nothing to write home about. You could see them struggle to make it interesting, such as adding a new character after the first three seasons and sticking her in an outfit that made her look like a Barbie doll, using the Borg and Q (I like both, but still, I'd rather Voyager hadn't needed to rely on them). Too many episodes where they were vacationing on some planet (and ticking off the locals) instead of flying home as hard as they could go. Too much scowling from Tuvoc. Too many ""bad Seska"" episodes. Not enough really imaginative stories. But alas, it's Star Trek, so some of us still love it.

In retrospect my thinking was the only thing idiotic.I now find Janeway a very believable leader, and she could probably give ol' James Tiberius a run for his money. The premise, when you stop and think about it, is genius because it's really just TOS and TNG in reverse. Instead of ""going where no man has gone before"", these folks are just trying to get home.After finishing the first three discs of Season 1 this looks very promising. Many reviewers have indicated Season 1 is weaker (as you might expect) than the following seasons. If that's true I can't wait to buy the rest. My favorite episode so far is ""Heros and Demons"", which was crafted in the very best Trek tradition.My rating of four stars was due to the packaging, which as many have noted seems somewhat cheap and easily damaged. I would concur the retail price is out of line, but I purchased mine used. Other than that, Paramount keep up the good work!

791074,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B000127LW2,"M.D.C. ""Tempting Reviews""","[0, 0]","When Voyager first hit the airways I was not impressed.  TO be honest, Janeway was the reason why.  She was extremely stiff and inflexible in the first season; even more than Picard in TNG.  But I was so head-in-clouds over Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5 that I acknowledged not really giving the show a fair chance.  So I decided to watch it from the beginning.  And I will write high level reviews for each season, not each episode.Season 1's focus is the crew getting adjusted to life in the Delta Quadrant as well as the merging of Maquis and Starfleet members into a cohesive crew.  This struggle makes for some good writing early on as you would definitely expect some conflicts, but there were some missed opportunities for sabotage.  Episodes like ""State of Flux"" which sets the foundation for one of the most interesting backstories in Voyager (Seska) and ""Learning Curve"" where they showcase some stragglers that just didn't make the full transition to Starfleet life.  The most obvious negative is that they never fully explored the latter; after a while, people just start flowing along happily, which given the story of the Maquis told in Deep Space Nine, should really been more challenging.There were some head scratcher episodes, such as ""Time and Again"" where it causes a headache thinking about what's going on (which is the reason it's generally not a good idea to tell a time travel-related story), and you can't help but think back to TNG's ""Time's Arrow"" where Data experiences generally the same idea; that you can encounter an event today that both hasn't and has happened.  Trust me when I say that the episode does make sense, but it will give you some migraines trying to sort through the chronology of everything.  Even worse is the idea that Janeway can affect the flow of time by realizing the paradox, thus preventing the event that caused them to be in the situation in the first place (thus creating another paradox).Other episodes, like ""Emanations"" are filler and do little to further the series.  Annoyances that are better left out of the canon, but we're stuck with nonetheless.  ""Prime Factors"" is actually a well-told story marred by poor character interactions and illogical behavior (Tuvok).It's clear from the episode progression that the writers were trying to use this opportunity to work with characters and storylines that they could not have in the other Star Trek versions.  Being in the Delta Quadrant meant they could make up characters at a whim, and throwing the Maquis in there gave them ""bad guys"" without much effort.  The problem is that the approach is so haphazard that it will be difficult to really be interested in seeing more seasons, but the first season is necessary to really enjoy some of what comes later.",4,Started off reasonably strong.,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2772,"['When', 'Voyager', 'first', 'hit', 'airways', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'TO', 'be', 'honest', 'Janeway', 'was', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'extremely', 'stiff', 'inflexible', 'first', 'season', 'even', 'more', 'Picard', 'TNG', 'was', 'so', 'head-in-clouds', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'Babylon', '5', 'acknowledged', 'not', 'really', 'giving', 'show', 'fair', 'chance', 'decided', 'watch', 'beginning', 'will', 'write', 'high', 'level', 'reviews', 'season', 'not', 'episode.Season', '1', 'focus', 'crew', 'getting', 'adjusted', 'life', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'as', 'well', 'merging', 'Maquis', 'Starfleet', 'members', 'cohesive', 'crew', 'struggle', 'good', 'writing', 'early', 'would', 'definitely', 'expect', 'conflicts', 'were', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'sabotage', 'Episodes', 'State', 'Flux', 'foundation', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'backstories', 'Voyager', 'Seska', 'Learning', 'Curve', 'where', 'showcase', 'stragglers', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'full', 'transition', 'Starfleet', 'life', 'most', 'obvious', 'negative', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'latter', 'while', 'people', 'just', 'start', 'flowing', 'along', 'happily', 'given', 'story', 'Maquis', 'told', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', 'should', 'really', 'been', 'more', 'challenging.There', 'were', 'head', 'scratcher', 'such', 'Time', 'Again', 'where', 'headache', 'thinking', 'what', 'going', 'reason', 'generally', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'tell', 'time', 'travel-related', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'TNG', 'Time', 'Arrow', 'where', 'Data', 'generally', 'same', 'idea', 'can', 'encounter', 'event', 'today', ""n't"", 'happened', 'Trust', 'when', 'say', 'episode', 'make', 'sense', 'will', 'give', 'migraines', 'trying', 'sort', 'chronology', 'everything', 'Even', 'worse', 'idea', 'Janeway', 'can', 'affect', 'flow', 'time', 'realizing', 'paradox', 'thus', 'preventing', 'event', 'caused', 'be', 'situation', 'first', 'place', 'thus', 'creating', 'paradox', '.Other', 'episodes', 'Emanations', 'are', 'filler', 'do', 'little', 'further', 'series', 'Annoyances', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'out', 'canon', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'nonetheless', 'Prime', 'Factors', 'actually', 'well-told', 'story', 'marred', 'poor', 'character', 'interactions', 'illogical', 'behavior', 'Tuvok', '.It', 'clear', 'episode', 'progression', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'use', 'opportunity', 'work', 'characters', 'storylines', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'Star', 'Trek', 'versions', 'Being', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'meant', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'characters', 'whim', 'throwing', 'Maquis', 'gave', 'bad', 'guys', 'much', 'effort', 'problem', 'approach', 'so', 'haphazard', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'really', 'be', 'interested', 'seeing', 'more', 'seasons', 'first', 'season', 'necessary', 'really', 'enjoy', 'what', 'later']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season
791075,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000127LW2,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[4, 7]","Less than one year following the concluding season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the ""Star Trek"" universe created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled ""Voyager"" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001.  Because ""Voyager"" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season.  The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.Unlike the previous three ""Star Trek"" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Even while travelling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth.  Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing.  Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the first season of ""Voyager"" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., ""The Doctor"", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  In the two-part series opener entitled ""The Caretaker"", Chakotay, B'Elanna, Seska (Martha Packett) and a few other occasional Voyager crewmen were not part of the original Voyager crew.  Instead, they were members of the Maquis, a group of armed separatists opposed to both Federation and Cardassian rule.  They, along with the crew of Voyager (who is sent to capture them), are themselves captured by a very advanced being known only as the Caretaker, who uses his technology to grab and transport them to the Delta Quadrant.  The transportation damages Voyager and the Maquis ship and leaves many Voyager crewmen dead.  Rather than let a less advanced, but violent, race known as the Kazon obtain the ailing Caretaker's technology, Captain Janeway makes the unpopular decision to destroy the Caretaker's ship, which also destroys their best & easiest chance of getting home quickly.  Hence, Voyager is on its own in the Delta Quadrant, having no support from the Federation, and begins its long journey back home with a combined Federation/Maquis/Delta Quadrant-native crew.Through the first season, Voyager continues to battle the Kazon (who are determined to own its technology), the unfriendly holographic Doctor (the only doctor on board) starts to become more sentient and friendly thanks to his interactions with Kes, a traitor is on the loose, the phage-infected Vidians want to harvest Voyager crewman organs, the crew experiences time travel, the crew have to acquire a taste for Neelix's cooking, and B'Elanna experiences inner battle between her human and Klingon halves.  Noteworthy episodes include the two-part ""The Caretaker"", ""Time and Again"", ""Phage"", ""The Cloud"", ""Eye of the Needle"", ""Emanations"", ""Faces"", ""Jetrel"" and ""Learning Curve"".Overall, I rate the first season of ""Voyager"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a good start for what ultimately became a much better series after the introduction of the former Borg character ""Seven of Nine"" (Jeri Ryan) at the end of the third season.  I am very glad to see Paramount Television finally begin releasing the ""Voyager"" series on DVD.",4,The Series Begins Far From Home & Lost in the Delta Quadrant,1069632000,"11 24, 2003",2003,4351,"['Less', 'one', 'year', 'following', 'concluding', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', '1994', 'executive', 'producer/writer', 'Rick', 'Berman', 'Michael', 'Piller', 'Jeri', 'Taylor', 'created', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'based', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'created', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', '1921-1991', '1960', 'fourth', 'television', 'series', 'entitled', 'Voyager', 'name', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'starship', 'used', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'January', '1995', 'ran', 'seven', 'seasons', 'concluded', 'May', '2001', 'Voyager', 'aired', 'initially', 'month', 'January', 'instead', 'traditional', 'September', 'only', '16', 'episodes', 'were', 'filmed', 'first', 'season', 'succeeding', 'six', 'other', 'seasons', 'had', '26', 'episodes', 'grand', 'total', '172', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series.Unlike', 'previous', 'three', 'Star', 'Trek', 'television', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'took', 'place', 'bounds', 'Federation', 'Planets', 'nearby', 'sovereign', 'areas', 'space', 'such', 'Klingon', 'Empire', 'Romulan', 'Empire', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'starship', 'Voyager', 'hurled', 'tens', 'thousands', 'light-years', 'home', 'previously', 'unknown', 'unexplored', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'located', 'far', 'side', 'Milky', 'Way', 'Galaxy', 'Even', 'travelling', 'warp', '8', 'fastest', 'safe', 'speed', 'typical', 'starship', 'can', 'travel', 'would', 'take', 'Voyager', 'several', 'decades', 'return', 'Earth', 'Hence', 'series', 'survival', 'Voyager', 'Starfleet', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'isolated', 'unable', 'even', 'maintain', 'normal', 'communications', 'Earth', 'as', 'well', 'crew', 'ultimate', 'desire', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'faster', 'ship', 'capable', 'doing', 'Also', 'way', 'Voyager', 'few', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'natives.The', 'primary', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'season', 'Voyager', 'include', 'Captain', 'Catherine', 'Janeway', 'Kate', 'Mulgrew', 'Commander', 'Chakotay', 'Robert', 'Beltran', 'half-Klingon', 'Lt.', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'Roxann', 'Dawson', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Ocampan', 'Kes', 'Jennifer', 'Lien', 'Lt.', 'Thomas', 'Eugene', 'Paris', 'Robert', 'Duncan', 'McNeill', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'native', 'Talaxian', 'Neelix', 'Ethan', 'Phillips', 'holographic', 'Emergency', 'Medical', 'Holographic', 'Program', 'a.k.a.', 'Doctor', 'played', 'Robert', 'Picardo', 'Vulcan', 'Lt.', 'Cmdr', 'Tuvok', 'Tim', 'Russ', 'Ensign', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'Garrett', 'Wang', 'two-part', 'series', 'opener', 'entitled', 'Caretaker', 'Chakotay', ""B'Elanna"", 'Seska', 'Martha', 'Packett', 'few', 'other', 'occasional', 'Voyager', 'crewmen', 'were', 'not', 'part', 'original', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'Instead', 'were', 'members', 'Maquis', 'group', 'armed', 'separatists', 'opposed', 'Federation', 'Cardassian', 'rule', 'crew', 'Voyager', 'who', 'sent', 'capture', 'are', 'captured', 'very', 'advanced', 'being', 'known', 'only', 'Caretaker', 'who', 'technology', 'grab', 'transport', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'transportation', 'damages', 'Voyager', 'Maquis', 'ship', 'many', 'Voyager', 'crewmen', 'dead', 'Rather', 'let', 'less', 'advanced', 'violent', 'race', 'known', 'Kazon', 'obtain', 'ailing', 'Caretaker', 'technology', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'unpopular', 'decision', 'destroy', 'Caretaker', 'ship', 'also', 'best', 'easiest', 'chance', 'getting', 'home', 'quickly', 'Hence', 'Voyager', 'own', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'having', 'support', 'Federation', 'long', 'journey', 'back', 'home', 'combined', 'Federation/Maquis/Delta', 'Quadrant-native', 'first', 'season', 'Voyager', 'battle', 'Kazon', 'who', 'are', 'determined', 'own', 'technology', 'unfriendly', 'holographic', 'Doctor', 'only', 'doctor', 'board', 'become', 'more', 'sentient', 'friendly', 'thanks', 'interactions', 'Kes', 'traitor', 'loose', 'phage-infected', 'Vidians', 'want', 'harvest', 'Voyager', 'crewman', 'organs', 'crew', 'time', 'travel', 'crew', 'have', 'acquire', 'taste', 'Neelix', 'cooking', ""B'Elanna"", 'inner', 'battle', 'human', 'Klingon', 'halves', 'Noteworthy', 'include', 'two-part', 'Caretaker', 'Time', 'Again', 'Phage', 'Cloud', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'Emanations', 'Faces', 'Jetrel', 'Learning', 'Curve', '.Overall', 'rate', 'first', 'season', 'Voyager', '4', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'good', 'start', 'what', 'ultimately', 'became', 'much', 'better', 'series', 'introduction', 'former', 'Borg', 'character', 'Seven', 'Nine', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'Paramount', 'Television', 'finally', 'begin', 'releasing', 'Voyager', 'series', 'DVD']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season

Tom Paris and Tuvok are dull characters, Neelix is the most irritating character in all 5 shows, possibly the most irritating character in any show. The Doctor is never utilised to his fullest.This is a show I approached with an open mind. Many had decried TNG and DS9 before they even started - as with those shows I waited until I had actually watched it. Voyager fell very quickly with some dire storytelling.There is a guy I know who rubbishes TNG saying that it stole all its storylines from the original serise. First of all, only a few storylines are obvious rip-offs. Second, Voyager does its share of ripping-off. I still can't believe that it ripped-off the original series turkey ""Spock's Brain"" (ie ""The Phage"" aka ""Neelix's Lungs"")!Even the one episode I liked first time around, ""Eye of the Needle"" isn't as good second time around. Voyager is the series that really eroded what Star Trek was about. Predictable story-arcs, laughable temporal-anomaly stories (Year of Hell being an utter clunker), and poor story-telling (the suicide of a Q in season 2 being a missed opportunity) make this the nadir of the Star Trek franchise. If there is an 11th film and it focuses on the Voyager crew then it will be the first ST film I don't go and see.For a sense of wonder watch the original series, for good stories watch TNG, for interesting characters and story arcs watch DS9.

Even though I could barely grasp it, there was always something appealing about it.  My favorite episode of the Reading Rainbow was the one with the behind the scenes look at TNG.  Later, we started renting episode of the Original Series from our local libraries, & I loved those too.  They don't hold up as well as The Next Generation does.  While there are some really good episodes, one thing drags it down:  William Shatner.  Everything else is good, but Kirk's acting is so annoying.  I also watched some of Deep Space 9 on TV, which I loved, as well as Voyager.  For a few weeks I went over to my aunt's house next door & we'd watch Voyager together.  It was my least favorite at the time, but now I'd definitely rank it above TOS.  I got this after an acquaintance of mine recommended it to me.  He said that this was his favorite Star Trek after TNG, because while it was never as good as TNG, it had no bad episodes (I've seen 4 bad episodes in TNG season 1 already, & I'm sure I'll see more before I'm through).

They attempt to stop the explosion that destroys the planet.  B+5.  Phage:  An organ-harvesting species known as the Vidiians steal Neelix's lungs, leaving him to die.  A6.  The Cloud: The crew enters a nebula to collect samples before realizing it is a living organism.  A-7.  Eye of the Needle:  A micro-wormhole is discovered that leads to the Alpha Quadrant, and the crew make contact with a Romulan ship on the other side.  B+8.  Ex Post Facto:  Tom Paris is convicted of murder on an alien world, and his punishment is reliving the murder from the victim's perspective every 14 hours.  An excellent noir episode, directed by LeVar Burton, proving that any Star Trek actor can direct better than Shatner.  A+9.  Emanations:  Harry Kim is transported to an alien world at the same time a dead body arrives on Voyager.  A10.  Prime Factors:  A race that could shorten Voyager's journey with a transportation device will not share its technology.  B11.  State of Flux:  Janeway and the other senior officers attempt to flush out a spy who is sending information to the Kazon.  A12.  Heroes & Demons:  The holographic doctor must rescue crew members who were turned to energy in the Holodeck, by entering a holodeck program of Beowulf.  I hate holodeck episodes but this was redeemed by a spotlight on my favorite character, the Doctor.  B13.  Cathexis:  An alien mind takes over crew-members' bodies, and Chakotay is left apparently brain-dead after something attacks his shuttlecraft.  A typical plot but good enough & had a good twist.  B14.  Faces:  B'Elanna Torres is split into her human and Klingon halves by the Vidiians.  An excellent episode, featuring one of the most gruesome deaths of a red shirt.  A+15.  Jetrel:  A member of the Haakonians, a race warring with the Talaxians arrives on Voyager, much to the dismay of Neelix, whose family was killed by them.  My favorite episode of the season, apart from maybe Faces.  A+16.  Learning Curve:  Tuvok trains several Maquis members who have not fully integrated into the Voyager crew.  BA good set.  The most annoying thing about the show is that failure is the only option when it comes to getting back home.  Apart from that, it's worthy of the Star Trek name.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the series, especially the ones with Q.",5,One of the best Star Trek series.,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,4090,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'Star', 'Trek', 'When', 'was', 'really', 'little', 'favorite', 'adult', 'show', 'was', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Even', 'could', 'barely', 'grasp', 'was', 'always', 'something', 'appealing', 'My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Reading', 'Rainbow', 'was', 'one', 'scenes', 'look', 'TNG', 'Later', 'started', 'renting', 'episode', 'Original', 'Series', 'local', 'libraries', 'loved', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'Next', 'Generation', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', 'one', 'thing', 'down', 'William', 'Shatner', 'Everything', 'else', 'good', 'Kirk', 'acting', 'so', 'annoying', 'also', 'watched', 'Deep', 'Space', '9', 'TV', 'loved', 'as', 'well', 'Voyager', 'few', 'weeks', 'went', 'aunt', 'house', 'door', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Voyager', 'together', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'time', 'now', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'rank', 'TOS', 'got', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'recommended', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TNG', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'TNG', 'had', 'bad', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'seen', '4', 'bad', 'episodes', 'TNG', 'season', '1', 'already', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', ""'m"", ""'ve"", 'halfway', 'season', '2', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'agree', 'him.1-2', 'Caretaker', 'mission', 'Badlands', 'USS', 'Voyager', 'Maquis', 'ship', 'stranded', 'Delta', 'Quadrant', 'more', '70,000', 'light-years', 'home', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'being', 'known', 'Caretaker', 'best', 'pilot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Star', 'Trek', 'show', 'A3', 'Parallax', 'Voyager', 'trapped', 'quantum', 'singularity', 'event', 'horizon', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'must', 'decide', 'Lt.', 'Carey', 'former', 'Maquis', ""B'Elanna"", 'be', 'new', 'chief', 'engineer', 'B4', 'Time', 'Again', 'Captain', 'Kathryn', 'Janeway', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'one', 'day', 'alien', 'planet', 'annihilated', 'attempt', 'stop', 'explosion', 'planet', 'B+5', 'Phage', 'organ-harvesting', 'species', 'known', 'Vidiians', 'steal', 'Neelix', 'lungs', 'leaving', 'die', 'A6', 'Cloud', 'crew', 'nebula', 'collect', 'samples', 'realizing', 'living', 'organism', 'A-7', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'micro-wormhole', 'discovered', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'crew', 'make', 'contact', 'Romulan', 'ship', 'other', 'side', 'B+8', 'Ex', 'Post', 'Facto', 'Tom', 'Paris', 'convicted', 'murder', 'alien', 'world', 'punishment', 'reliving', 'murder', 'victim', 'perspective', '14', 'hours', 'excellent', 'noir', 'episode', 'directed', 'LeVar', 'Burton', 'proving', 'Star', 'Trek', 'actor', 'can', 'direct', 'better', 'Shatner', 'A+9', 'Emanations', 'Harry', 'Kim', 'transported', 'alien', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'dead', 'body', 'Voyager', 'A10', 'Prime', 'Factors', 'race', 'could', 'shorten', 'Voyager', 'journey', 'transportation', 'device', 'will', 'not', 'share', 'technology', 'B11', 'State', 'Flux', 'Janeway', 'other', 'senior', 'officers', 'attempt', 'flush', 'out', 'spy', 'who', 'sending', 'information', 'Kazon', 'A12', 'Heroes', 'Demons', 'holographic', 'doctor', 'must', 'rescue', 'crew', 'members', 'who', 'were', 'turned', 'energy', 'Holodeck', 'entering', 'holodeck', 'program', 'Beowulf', 'hate', 'holodeck', 'episodes', 'was', 'redeemed', 'spotlight', 'favorite', 'character', 'Doctor', 'B13', 'Cathexis', 'alien', 'mind', 'crew-members', 'bodies', 'Chakotay', 'left', 'apparently', 'brain-dead', 'something', 'attacks', 'shuttlecraft', 'typical', 'plot', 'good', 'enough', 'had', 'good', 'twist', 'B14', 'Faces', ""B'Elanna"", 'Torres', 'split', 'human', 'Klingon', 'halves', 'Vidiians', 'excellent', 'episode', 'featuring', 'one', 'most', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'red', 'shirt', 'A+15', 'Jetrel', 'member', 'Haakonians', 'race', 'warring', 'Talaxians', 'Voyager', 'much', 'dismay', 'Neelix', 'family', 'was', 'killed', 'favorite', 'episode', 'season', 'apart', 'maybe', 'Faces', 'A+16', 'Learning', 'Curve', 'Tuvok', 'several', 'Maquis', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'fully', 'integrated', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'BA', 'good', 'set', 'most', 'annoying', 'thing', 'show', 'failure', 'only', 'option', 'when', 'getting', 'back', 'home', 'Apart', 'worthy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'name', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'rest', 'series', 'especially', 'ones', 'Q']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season
791081,A1DDDTSZJL6M2I,B000127LW2,"Paul HItch ""HItchy""","[4, 5]","Voyager was really an excellent series from the start.With a superb teaser, great casting and a wonderful premise for a series, the series starts as Voyager and a Marquis ship are propelled half-way across the galaxy by an unknown force.Forced to destroy the technology responsible for causing the ship to be brought there, so begins the series as Voyager sets off home for Earth with a 70 year journey ahead of her.The joining of the Starfleet and Marquis crews together make for some interesting stories and early tension, particuarly in this early series.The crew is also joined by an alien, a talaxian known as "" Neelix"" who takes great delight in giving the Vulcan Security office "" Tuvok"" a hard time. Their interaction is reminiscent of Bones and Spock from the original series.Neelix has a partner an Ocampan female called "" Kes "" a species that only lives for 9 years.The Captain, "" Janeway"" the first female lead in all the Star Trek series, is another great cast. She is very strong, but also very fair with her desicions. She decides to make the head of the Marquis, an ex Starfleet Officer her first Officer. His name is Chakotay. He is an Indian, and makes a very interesting character in the coming seasons. He is very softy spoken, but has real prescence.Another interesting addition is an ex convict, ex Starfleet, ex Marquis, who becomes the conn officer. Tom Paris as he's known, is an excellent pilot, who finds it hard to initially be part of the team.Rounding out the senior crew and main characters is a fresh Ensign, Harry Kim, just out of Starfleet, a half Klingon female ( who hates her Klingon part ! )she's an ex Marquis, who becomes the chief Engineer, and finally a Holographic doctor, known only as "" The Doctor"" who is activated as the ships real Doctor was killed in the first episode.The hologram was initially only intended as an Emergency to supplement the normal crew, or in the real Doctors absense.His struggle with finding an identity is one of the real high lights of the show, in the vein of "" Data"" from the next Generation.The opportunities for story lines from all this lot are almost endless!Although a short season ( Just 16 episodes )there is barely a bad episode. "" Learning Curve"" probably just takes the cake for this being ever so corny, and a somewhat disappointing end to the first season.The number of excellent quality episodes is amazing."" Caretaker"" the opening was an excellent start to the series, which sets up the ship, crew and location for the new and old veiwer of Star Trek alike."" Eye of the Needle"" was a great story about finding a small wormhole that offered hope to the crew for finding a way home."" Ex Post Facto"" was interesting story, with a legal twist as the conn officer Tom Paris is punished for an alleged murder on a planet."" Prime Factors"" also pushed the ethical side of the crew as they debate whether to violate their prime directive of not interfering with another species development or to abuse the  trust and respect provided by another species."" Jetrel"" is the first "" Neelix"" episode with bite, as he faces the creator of a weapon that destroyed much of his race, including his family.All in all, this is a superb series, and worth watching from the start. Having just watched them all again recently, you really appreciate the character development, and the continuity the show manages to portray.A worth while additon, with added bonus features, make this well worth it!Thanks for reading..

So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range.

791091,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000127LW2,Robert Moore,"[0, 4]","First, like several other reviews, I am docking this set a star because of the price.  I own a great number of television series on DVD.  This is not one of them.  Nor do I own any of the other Star Trek franchises.  I've never even considered buying them.  While virtually every other show that has ever appeared on DVD is available at a reasonable price (though there are other exceptions, in particular classic BBC series like Monty Python and The Prisoner), the Star Trek series are only available at exorbitant and prohibitive prices.  My only guess is that they assume (and perhaps correctly?) that there are enough Trekkies out there who will allow themselves to be willingly robbed of their hard earned money.  But none of these sets should be priced on Amazon above $40.  There is, for instance, almost no expenses to be paid for rights to music, one of the reasons for the high cost of other sets (and why ALLY MCBEAL still isn't available, since most of its music can't be substituted for less expensive songs).  These should be cheap!  Instead they are just about the most expensive DVDs out there.Although the Star Trek series were set far in the future, narratively each series in the franchise was actually quite conservative and devoid of innovation.  I suspect they made the deliberate decision to be conservative so as to make the futuristic setting less opaque.  But even though the eighties saw tremendous advances and innovation in narrative, moving more and more from an episodic, stand alone format to a serial, ongoing story arc format, Star Trek in general hewed to the stand-alone format.  So despite the great casts and despite the often-brilliant writing, there simply isn't much in the way of overall narrative.  There is also as a result relatively little in the way of character development.  While I enjoy THE NEXT GENERATION, DEEP SPACE 9, and VOYAGER, I always wonder how things would have turned out if the producers had decided to follow the example of shows like HILL STREET BLUES, CHINA BEACH, L.A. LAW, and ST. ELSEWHERE (all shows that predated these three Star Trek vehicles) and attempted a serial rather than episode format.  I think we might have seen something rather magnificent.  Instead, we would have to wait for BABYLON 5, FARSCAPE, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (created by Star Trek alum Ron Moore) to see just what could be done with serial narrative in a SF context.The tragedy with VOYAGER is that few series in the history of TV would have seemed to need a serial format more.  The parallel would be with the original 1978 version of BSG, which also seemed to require a serial format but also didn't get it.  Instead of the series being about their attempt to get home from the other side of creation, the need to get home merely provided the backdrop.  It should have been a narrative feature to drive the entire series forward.  Instead, it was just there.  Anyone viewing either FARSCAPE or the new BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can't help but notice how much better both of those series are in large part because they each honored that central idea of trying to go home.I also have a couple of very personal bones to pick with VOYAGER as I do with all of the Star Trek series.  I absolutely detest shows with aliens.  I hate shows that use science as a form of magic.  I simply find ornate, speculative scientific solutions to problems to be narratively unexciting.  They almost always remove us from the characters and, well, bore me.  Finally, I hate innovations like ""shields.""  To me personally there is no more loathsome sentence in any SF series than something along the lines of, ""Shields down to 60%!""  As much as I love FARSCAPE, I detested the day when Moya got her own energy shield.  And although I'm not a huge fan of BABYLON 5, I love that they never stooped to using shields.  And BATTLESTAR GALACTICA demonstrates how much more exciting a SF series can be when a spaceship just has to eat a big bomb.  And don't get me started on phasers and lasers and photon torpedoes!Despite all this, VOYAGER is frequently a very interesting series.  Like most of the Star Trek series, the show has a great cast.  I really like Kate Mulgrew as Captain Janeway.  Interestingly, she was the second Star Trek captain to take her role after the French Canadian originally intended for the part declined to participate.  The first was Patrick Stewart, who because Picard after Louis Jourdan did not.  In this case, Mulgrew took over for Genevieve Bujold, who quit at the very beginning of the production.  I like the presence and command that Mulgrew brings to the show.  Plus, she has really great hair.  I like Tim Russ as Tuvok.  And most of the rest of the cast is also first rate, but for me personally the best character on the show -- and the only one that really brings anything new to the table -- is Robert Picardo's The Doctor.  On TNG Data had become TV's first truly great android character, providing many wonderful reflections on what it means to be a person.  But Voyager's Emergency Holographic Doctor did not even possess in any conventional sense a body.  Although I almost universally hate aliens on SF shows, I harbor a great love for any kind of so-called artificial life forms, whether we style them as robots, androids, or cyborgs.  (Any short list of my favorite SF characters would include Data, The Doctor, Seven of Nine, Max Guevera, River Tam, Kyle, and Sharon Agathon.)  VOYAGER would later introduce an equally compelling character along these lines in the marvelous Seven of Nine, someone who biologically is human but whose mind is still that of a hive.All in all I enjoy VOYAGER, though it is the source of much frustration for me.  Aliens, shields, stand alone episodes.  All of this impedes the enjoyment for me.  Still, despite this I find much to like.  But I would strongly recommend anyone wanting to see this to rent it from Netflix.  It isn't merely criminal for Paramount to offer these discs at such immoral prices; anyone buying the discs at these outrageous prices are colluding with them.",3,"Starts with promising premise and

791096,A28SOQV8HP1HK3,B000127LW2,"S. Cartwright ""Bearracing""","[7, 9]","Having been a fan of Star Trek since its beginning on September 22, 1966, I'm glad to see the long tradition of the Star Trek saga, from Gene Roddenberry's original concept, continue with &quot;Voyager&quot;!Having never seen any episode of Voyager until the release of Voyager Season One on this DVD package, I am pleased to say I'm quite satisfied with Voyager and its concept of the two diverse crews being thrown together under the same problem of being stuck 70,000 light years from the Alpha Quadrant and home.I have to agree with others that called Voyager's pilot episode (caretaker) one of the best ever for a Star Trek series. The original Star Trek series opened in 1966 with Episode #2 (Where No Man Has Gone Before) and didn't show the pilot until the middle of the second season, as a two-part show called &quot;The Cage&quot;. (unnoticed until years later was the mistake made in the original series opening episode where James T. Kirk's name was shown briefly as James R. Kirk on a headstone).Being a person that grew up during America's first flights into space, during the 1960s, the original Star Trek was perfectly timed to exploit my vast and intense interest in space and space travel. With the introduction of STNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation) I once again was in hog heaven as Science Fiction is something I enjoy very much. The Star Trek series of shows, rather that be the original, STNG, DS9, or Voyager offers more than just good Sc-Fi, but good Science Hope that we as a planet survive the next 3 or 4 hundred years.I found that the first season of Star Trek: Voyager is as good as either Star Trek (the original series) or STNG. My initial impression is that I believe I will probably like Voyager more than I liked DS9 (Deep Space Nine).Bottom-line, if you like Star Trek and you like good Science Fiction, then I'm sure you'll like Voyager. Having well written stories and excellent character interaction is a Star Trek trademark and the first season of Voyager has an abundance of both.",5,The legacy continues!,1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,2023,"['Having', 'been', 'fan', 'Star', 'Trek', 'beginning', 'September', '22', '1966', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'long', 'tradition', 'Star', 'Trek', 'saga', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'original', 'concept', 'continue', 'quot', 'Voyager', 'quot', 'Having', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Voyager', 'release', 'Voyager', 'Season', 'One', 'DVD', 'package', 'am', 'pleased', 'say', ""'m"", 'quite', 'satisfied', 'Voyager', 'concept', 'two', 'diverse', 'crews', 'being', 'thrown', 'together', 'same', 'problem', 'being', 'stuck', '70,000', 'light', 'years', 'Alpha', 'Quadrant', 'home.I', 'have', 'agree', 'others', 'called', 'Voyager', 'pilot', 'episode', 'caretaker', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'opened', '1966', 'Episode', '2', 'Where', 'Man', 'Has', 'Gone', 'Before', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'pilot', 'middle', 'second', 'season', 'two-part', 'show', 'called', 'quot', 'Cage', 'quot', 'unnoticed', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'mistake', 'made', 'original', 'series', 'opening', 'episode', 'where', 'James', 'T.', 'Kirk', 'name', 'was', 'shown', 'briefly', 'James', 'R.', 'Kirk', 'headstone', '.Being', 'person', 'grew', 'up', 'America', 'first', 'flights', 'space', '1960s', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'exploit', 'vast', 'intense', 'interest', 'space', 'space', 'travel', 'introduction', 'STNG', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'hog', 'heaven', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'something', 'enjoy', 'very', 'much', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'shows', 'rather', 'be', 'original', 'STNG', 'DS9', 'Voyager', 'offers', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'Sc-Fi', 'good', 'Science', 'Hope', 'planet', 'survive', 'next', '3', '4', 'hundred', 'years.I', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Voyager', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Trek', 'original', 'series', 'STNG', 'initial', 'impression', 'believe', 'will', 'probably', 'like', 'Voyager', 'more', 'liked', 'DS9', 'Deep', 'Space', 'Nine', '.Bottom-line', 'like', 'Star', 'Trek', 'like', 'good', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Voyager', 'Having', 'well', 'written', 'stories', 'excellent', 'character', 'interaction', 'Star', 'Trek', 'trademark', 'first', 'season', 'Voyager', 'abundance']",Star Trek Voyager - The Complete First Season

You then pull out the disks that are in a nice orange holder. But the first disk is not covered so you can easily get it dirty and marked up. The disk labels are not easily readable since the titles are near the center. This makes it very difficult to read the episodes on the disk.

As the crew begins to settle into their new reality tensions flare as the Marguis crew adjust to a Federation life style. B'Elanna Torres especially has a difficult time adjusting as she is relegated to a lowly junior officer in Engineering. Upset at not being the focal point of the Engineering Department she lashes out and harms a fellow crewmate. While Captain Janeway is upset at B'Elanna for the violent act, it is Chakotay that comes to her defense and attempts to make Janeway recognize her value to the ship. This pressure that Chakotay puts on Janeway makes Janeway doubt whether or not she made the right decision putting him as the First Officer.Meanwhile the ship finds another vessel deep inside a quantum singularity. Janeway is determined to get the ship out and save its crew. With help from B'Elanna, Voyager is stunned by exactly what they find when they attempt to free the ship. But the process of freeing the ship from the singularity is what brings the two crews closer together and ends the personal strife between Chakotay and Janeway. In the end the two crews begin to trust each other and the two leaders learn to adapt to the two different leadership styles.A good character building episode and a good introduction to the SciFi storyline that Voyager will follow throughout the rest of the series.

My first impression was that the box set is incomplete, that something is missing. What you get is 5 DVD's packed in the cheapest, orange and slim disk 5-box  which has nothing from the dignity of the movie. It looks like the set is packed with replacement box. The box envelope is not even made of plastic but from thick plastic foil. There is practically no way to smoothly close the box without fastening also cheaply glued back paper cover. What a shame!  The DVD discs looks like they're copied from the original ones, the top side of the disc has almost no print except small and hard to read white information regarded recorded DVD material. For me personally they remind a clean DVD+R/-R discs ready to be burned. The package is designed so badly, that there is no way to avoid fingerprints on the first disc surface when taking out any discs just because this one is not covered with anything! Inserting the disc is also difficult, the center disc holder is so tight that you get the feeling about possible disc damage. Personally I suggest to secure all discs using another package. With original ST-V package your discs will become dirty and even might become damaged in case of accidental squeeze. I give ""0"" (zero) stars for packaging.But things become even worse because in US version of season 1 there are 2 episodes missing: ""Arena&quot; and &quot;The City On The Edge Of Forever&quot;. These two episodes are included in European version of Voyager, isn't it interesting ? Anyway having multiregion dvd-player consider purchase further Voyager Seasons released in Europe. You will get a nice package and as I see more episodes to enjoy. Anyway this is what I'm going to do.The overall 3 stars note comes from the fact that the movie and sound transfer is very good and it deserves 5 stars. Comparing to the older TNG series a picture is much more sharp and clear. For the first time since TNG, I was able to watch ST Voyager on my 105"" wall projector with no prejudice.

791118,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000127LW2,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","Voyager recaptured the spirit of The Original Series with its setting in the unexplored part of the galaxy. In the pilot episode we're introduced to Kathyrn Janeway the Captain of the Voyager as she attempts to locate her Security Officer Tuvok. It seems Tuvok was working undercover with the Marqui a rebel group of homesteaders that are trying to preserve their settlements. The Federation has turned the planets the Marqui have settled over to another alien species as part of a treaty.Tuvok disappeared along with the crew he was spying on. Janeway recruits convict and former Marqui/Starfleet Officer Tom Paris to help her locate Tuvok. When they enter the distorted and unstable space called the Badlands (where the Marqui frequently hide), Voyager is hit by an energy wave that carries her 70,000 light years from home--essentially across the galaxy to unexplored space. They are transported against their will to what appears to a celebration at a farmhouse on Earth circa 1930. The mystery continues to deepen as the inhabitants are clearly hiding something or someone.The beginning of Voyager's pilot episode sparkles with conflict, adventure and energy. In many respects, Voyager recalls The tone and purpose of The Original Series with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. The stories still simmer with political overtones and adventure but with a much different background than Next Generation or DS9. The capable cast more delivers particularly Kate Mulgrew as Janeway and Robert Picardo as the irritable Emergency Medical Hologram.Yes, there were some minor characters that were a bit irritating and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the cast but, well, you try and work out the kinks during the first season. On the whole, the writing is uniformly strong.The handsome transfer suffers from few blemishes. There's some digital artifacts noticeable particularly during the optical effects (in the form of edge enhancement)but that's not really all that distracting. The lively colors and set design along with the sharp direction (particularly in the pilot episode)make even the so-so written episodes worth watching.I do have two complaints one minor and one major. The boxed set is priced the same as the full seasons for Next Generation and DS9 but there's only the first fifteen episodes of season one included (amazon.com is incorrect about there being sixteen as the pilot was broadcast as a two hour episode). This should have been price at considerably less than it is based on the total episodes and extras included.My second complaint is regarding the packaging. Next Generation's bulky boxes were admittedly a bit large but they did protect the discs and were very nicely designed. DS9's sets streamlined the process replacing the box with a plastic, thin slimcase which sat better on the shelf with other DVDs and sets. Voyager looks cheap. The plastic containter has a single illustration of the ship on the front and the rest is made up of thin plastic. The box is split in the middle and you must pull it apart to get to the discs themselves. They are housed in an orange plastic container similar to DS9's clear ones. They seem less sturdy although they probably aren't. Still the slipcase looks cheap and the series (and fans) deserve much better particularly when you're paying as much as the other Trek sets.There are some nice extras to be had including most of the footage shot with Genevieve Bujold as Janeway for the pilot episode. There's also an assembly edit of one particular unfinished section from the pilot before Bujold and the Trek team decided to part company. Berman's politically correct comments don't dish any dirt. While Bujold is fine as Janeway, she doesn't carry the authority of Mulgrew and is a bit of a disappointment in the role.The other extras include a visual effects featurette; original interviews produced during the series run with various cast members; a look at the creation and content for the Voyager website; a location featurette on the Kazons; Andre Bormanis the science consultant and one of the writers discusses the incorporation of real space phenomena and theories; archival footage of Kate Mulgrew discussing her role as Janeway and a new featurtette focusing on creating the new series with pilot episode co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Pillar and Jeri Taylor discussing the various challenges they faced.  There's also a photo gallery included.The sound is spectacular and available for the first time in 5.1 Surround although it isn't used quite as well as a theatrical feature might have.The Voyager boxed set isn't disappointing--many of the best episodes deserve 5 stars and the featurettes are also quite good as well. The sound is a stand out as is the transfer despite some minor blemishes. It'll make a good addition to a fan's collection. I only wish that Paramount had given fans a sturdier box for the film and one that didn't look so cheap.",4,Voyager arrives with top notch transfer but so-so packaging.,1077667200,"02 25,
