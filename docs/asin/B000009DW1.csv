495251,A4R9MJFF8UFND,B000009DW1,Brian Camp,"[2, 2]","THE BIG HEAT (1988) is a fast-paced, gritty, down-and-dirty crime thriller shot in the streets and urban spaces of Hong Kong as it follows a group of cops in a life-or-death struggle with a gang of thugs employed by a corrupt businessman doing some high-level smuggling. Every scene is pitched around a confrontation that leads in every case to a shootout, car chase, foot chase, explosion or attempted assassination. Although none of the action scenes boasts the spectacle of a John Woo thriller (HARD-BOILED, THE KILLER), the action is consistently exciting, well-crafted, suspenseful and, up until the final showdown, fairly believable. One superb setpiece involves a face-off between the cops and an assassin in a hospital elevator shaft that serves as a model of how to stage action scenes in tight spaces.The film was co-directed by Andrew Kam and Johnny To and produced by Tsui Hark. It was part of a wave of top-ranked HK urban thrillers led by Woo's A BETTER TOMORROW (also produced by Hark) and Ringo Lam's CITY ON FIRE. The cast of THE BIG HEAT includes Waise Lee (A BULLET IN THE HEAD), Joey Wong (A CHINESE GHOST STORY), Chu Kong (THE KILLER) and, in an ingenious bit of casting, Philip Kwok, formerly one of Shaw Bros.' FIVE DEADLY VENOMS, who, in the interest of greater realism here, refrains from kung fu, but does his share of shooting, punching, running, leaping, and driving at high speeds. The film features much brutal violence, with some particularly gruesome bits (as in that hospital elevator scene). But if you're a fan of hard-edged crime thrillers, this film is for you.",4,Violent hard-edged police thriller from Hong Kong,989798400,"05 14, 2001",2001,1598,"['BIG', 'HEAT', '1988', 'fast-paced', 'gritty', 'down-and-dirty', 'crime', 'thriller', 'shot', 'streets', 'urban', 'spaces', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'group', 'cops', 'life-or-death', 'struggle', 'gang', 'thugs', 'employed', 'corrupt', 'businessman', 'doing', 'high-level', 'smuggling', 'scene', 'pitched', 'confrontation', 'case', 'shootout', 'car', 'chase', 'foot', 'chase', 'explosion', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'none', 'action', 'spectacle', 'John', 'Woo', 'thriller', 'HARD-BOILED', 'THE', 'KILLER', 'action', 'consistently', 'exciting', 'well-crafted', 'suspenseful', 'up', 'final', 'showdown', 'fairly', 'believable', 'One', 'superb', 'setpiece', 'face-off', 'cops', 'assassin', 'hospital', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'model', 'how', 'stage', 'action', 'scenes', 'tight', 'spaces.The', 'film', 'was', 'co-directed', 'Andrew', 'Kam', 'Johnny', 'produced', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'was', 'part', 'wave', 'top-ranked', 'HK', 'urban', 'thrillers', 'led', 'Woo', 'A', 'BETTER', 'TOMORROW', 'also', 'produced', 'Hark', 'Ringo', 'Lam', 'CITY', 'ON', 'FIRE', 'cast', 'THE', 'BIG', 'HEAT', 'Waise', 'Lee', 'BULLET', 'IN', 'THE', 'HEAD', 'Joey', 'Wong', 'A', 'CHINESE', 'GHOST', 'STORY', 'Chu', 'Kong', 'THE', 'KILLER', 'ingenious', 'bit', 'casting', 'Philip', 'Kwok', 'formerly', 'one', 'Shaw', 'Bros.', 'FIVE', 'DEADLY', 'VENOMS', 'who', 'interest', 'greater', 'realism', 'here', 'refrains', 'kung', 'fu', 'share', 'shooting', 'punching', 'running', 'leaping', 'driving', 'high', 'speeds', 'film', 'features', 'much', 'brutal', 'violence', 'particularly', 'gruesome', 'bits', 'hospital', 'elevator', 'scene', ""'re"", 'fan', 'hard-edged', 'crime', 'thrillers', 'film']",N/A

The killer is a very rich man and wants to kill the cops before they get a chance to arrest him.Waise Lee is a good actor, but he just doesn't bring anything special to this role.  Him and his fellow cops going after the bad guys should be more exciting.  Lee just plays his character the same all the way through.The script is pretty good, but the graphic violence is what stands out the most.  Shown in a flashback at the start of the movie, Waise Lee's character was once tortured and had a power drill put through his hand.  He plans to retire because he has nerve damage, but he has to solve his friend's murder first.  I liked how he has to overcome his immobilized hand at times, but that is where the originality stops in this movie.  It is an average entry into the herioc bloodshed genre, except bloodier than most, and the directing is above average.  Not a bad movie, just not one I would spend time watching again.3.5/5Picture and sound quality on the Megastar DVD are good.

495254,A1HBH4SO7ZY4DE,B000009DW1,Piers,"[0, 0]","The `Big Heat' is an average entry from the golden era of heroic bloodshed flicks. While there are some good scenes, the direction and choreography is quite disjointed (no doubt due to the film having three directors) and the performances mostly wooden and uninvolving. Waise Lee sleepwalks through his role as the main protagonist, the rookie cop is as annoying as his character requires and the other actors fulfil their roles as ciphers to the plot. All of which would be forgiven if this film kept up the pace and had great action set pieces, however, there is plenty of dead time in the middle and the action, whilst frequently over the top, doesn't really reach the truly insane heights of other HK films with the exception of a great highway chase and some bits near the end.Now I knew the acting would be bad, but I bought this expecting to get a grotesquely violent, fast paced, well choreographed action film and feel let down on almost every level.  Ebola Syndrome (1996) truly surpasses this in terms of gore, In the Line of Duty 4 (1989) or Tiger on the Beat (1987) have far better stunt choreography and are more over the top and fast paced, Hard Boiled (1992) has better shoot-outs and the superlative Full Contact (1992) combines all of these facets with far better acting to make what I consider the best of these kind of films and arguably one of the best HK films of all time.Overall average.",3,Meh,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1411,"['Big', 'Heat', 'average', 'entry', 'golden', 'era', 'heroic', 'bloodshed', 'flicks', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'direction', 'choreography', 'quite', 'disjointed', 'doubt', 'due', 'film', 'having', 'three', 'directors', 'performances', 'mostly', 'wooden', 'uninvolving', 'Waise', 'Lee', 'role', 'main', 'protagonist', 'rookie', 'cop', 'as', 'annoying', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'fulfil', 'roles', 'ciphers', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'film', 'kept', 'up', 'pace', 'had', 'great', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'however', 'plenty', 'dead', 'time', 'middle', 'action', 'whilst', 'frequently', 'top', ""n't"", 'really', 'reach', 'truly', 'insane', 'heights', 'other', 'HK', 'films', 'exception', 'great', 'highway', 'chase', 'bits', 'end.Now', 'knew', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'bought', 'expecting', 'get', 'grotesquely', 'violent', 'fast', 'paced', 'well', 'choreographed', 'action', 'film', 'feel', 'let', 'down', 'almost', 'level', 'Ebola', 'Syndrome', '1996', 'truly', 'terms', 'gore', 'Line', 'Duty', '4', '1989', 'Tiger', 'Beat', '1987', 'have', 'far', 'better', 'stunt', 'choreography', 'are', 'more', 'top', 'fast', 'paced', 'Hard', 'Boiled', '1992', 'better', 'shoot-outs', 'superlative', 'Full', 'Contact', '1992', 'facets', 'far', 'better', 'acting', 'make', 'what', 'consider', 'best', 'kind', 'films', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'HK', 'films', 'time.Overall', 'average']",N/A
