781572,A2O59M48Z3QNIJ,B0000E6FP8,Polly M. Moreno,"[15, 16]","Based on an actual event, this 1991 television movie is a chilling reminder of our universal vulnerability to events beyond our control.The Ross Colburn family seemingly has everything going for them--a father (Richard Chamberlain) with a lucrative medical practice, a warm and vivacious mother (Michael Learned) who lovingly dotes on all her children, and siblings who genuinely seem very fond of each other.The family's idylic life is shattered when the mother and youngest son are tragically caught up in a random robbery at a ""hi-fi"" store that turns sickeningly violent. The remainder of the film deals with the family's journey back from this deep trauma, as they try to survive and conquer their mutual despair.The cast is uniformly excellent, and features Doug Savant, the fine actor currently co-starring in ""Desperate Housewives"" as one of the sons. Michael Learned is featured in the first part of the movie only, but does a wonderful job, as always, of portraying the warm and supportive wife and mother.  Richard Chamberlain, in the pivotal role of the father, is marvelous--it is his character who undergoes the most drastic change in the film. Due to truly horrific circumstances, he is forced to change from being a somewhat removed and detached father, to becoming the emotional rock of strength and love for his entire family.  He has some very moving scenes with the actors and actress portraying his children, particularly a very important scene near the end of the film, at the graveside of his wife.All in all, a very well done television movie, that may find you turning away from the screen when the actual robbery is played out.",4,One Family's Journey Back From The Abyss,1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,1653,"['Based', 'actual', 'event', '1991', 'television', 'movie', 'chilling', 'reminder', 'universal', 'vulnerability', 'events', 'control.The', 'Ross', 'Colburn', 'family', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'going', 'father', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'lucrative', 'medical', 'practice', 'warm', 'vivacious', 'mother', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'who', 'lovingly', 'children', 'siblings', 'who', 'genuinely', 'seem', 'very', 'fond', 'other.The', 'family', 'idylic', 'life', 'shattered', 'when', 'mother', 'youngest', 'son', 'are', 'tragically', 'caught', 'up', 'random', 'robbery', 'hi-fi', 'store', 'sickeningly', 'violent', 'remainder', 'film', 'deals', 'family', 'journey', 'back', 'deep', 'trauma', 'try', 'survive', 'conquer', 'mutual', 'despair.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'features', 'Doug', 'Savant', 'fine', 'actor', 'currently', 'co-starring', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'one', 'sons', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'featured', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'only', 'wonderful', 'job', 'always', 'portraying', 'warm', 'supportive', 'wife', 'mother', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'pivotal', 'role', 'father', 'marvelous', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'drastic', 'change', 'film', 'Due', 'truly', 'horrific', 'circumstances', 'forced', 'change', 'being', 'somewhat', 'removed', 'detached', 'father', 'becoming', 'emotional', 'rock', 'strength', 'love', 'entire', 'family', 'very', 'moving', 'scenes', 'actors', 'actress', 'portraying', 'children', 'particularly', 'very', 'important', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'graveside', 'wife.All', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'television', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'turning', 'away', 'screen', 'when', 'actual', 'robbery', 'played', 'out']",N/A
