Perfectly cast and brillianly acted, this show is just to good for regular television which may explain the lackluster ratings.  It's too cool and smart for average viewers weened on formulaic pap usually found on sitcoms.  BUT-kudos to FOX for renewing the program for another season. If you have'nt seen it, pick up this set and immerse yourself in it. Then start watching and supporting this great show.  I have neglected to describe the show's premise because one of the joys of it is to become acquainted with the large ensemble cast and get hooked on the show, and you will.

Indeed, my brother is still convinced that this is an HBO show. Arrested Development is the best show on network television, and if you're curious about whether or not you should take the plunge, I would definitely advise trying it out. A few notes--it differs from most sitcoms in that there is heavy continuity among episodes and it is very detail-oriented. Jokes are forshadowed before they appear and are evoked afterwards. The humor is sophisticated, but accessible. Some (or all) of these facts are used to say that this is a show only for ""smart"" people, whatever that means. For my part, I don't think that intelligence has anything to do with it. It's more a matter of your willingness to commit to the storylines and concentrate on what's on the tube. If you are willing to do those things, you will be rewarded. If not, you probably won't. In essence, you get what you put into it.So, if you're willing to put some effort in, you won't be disappointed. The series revolves around the Bluth family, especially Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the voice of (mostly) reason in a family marked by petty jealousy, greed, and general cluelessness. Michael has to compete with his resentful older brother, George Oscar (or GOB, played by Will Arnett); his lipstick liberal twin sister, Lindsey (Portia de Rossi); his pathetic younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale); his is-he-or-isn't-he actor brother-in-law Tobias (David Cross); his rebellious niece, Mabee (Alia Shawkat); his judgmental and bigoted mother, Lucille (Jessica Walker); and his newly religious prison inmate father, George (Jeffrey Tambor). The only other (somewhat) normal member of his family is his son, George Michael (Michael Cera). Not only is this a flawless ensemble cast, but there are plenty of high-profile guest stars: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Liza Minelli, and Carl Weathers (playing an hilarious version of himself as a hige tightwad), to name a few. To my knowledge, it's the only time Liza Minelli and Carl Weathers have shared a scene, and if that isn't bizarre enough for you, just wait.I am hesitant to give away any of the jokes, because my retelling would only diminish them, but take my word that this is a show where you will laugh out loud at a near-continuous clip. The only comedy it is even remotely like is Sports Night, with the same kinetic style and documentary feel. Interestingly, series creator Mitchell Hurwitz did mention Sports Night in an interview about how he put the show together. There's not quite as much good feeling in this show, which pretty much veers away from drama. However, this is the most creative and original show on the air, and Fox has given them a surprising amount of latitude.

843051,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B0002PYS7Y,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[12, 13]","This is the story of the Bluth family, a once-prominent group of individuals who now have to try to live a more frugal life after George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) was arrested for shady bookkeeping (along with a few other charges).  This forces George's son Michael (Jason Bateman), who was planning on leaving the family's development business after being passed up for a promotion, to take over the company.  Michael is the natural choice seeing as how his mother Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walters) is a narcissistic and critical socialite, his twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke (Portia de Rossi) has never worked more than a day in her life, his older brother George Oscar Bluth, Jr. (Will Arnett), or just Gob for short (pronounced Jobe), is a lazy (and inept) magician, and his younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth (Tony Hale), is a moderately intelligent mama's boy who is prone to panic attacks.  Rounding out the cast are Tobias Funke (David Cross), Lindsay's husband, whom she married in order to rebel against her father, George-Michael Bluth (Michael Cera), Michael's son, and Mae ""Maeby"" Funke (Alia Shawkat), Michael's niece.  Oh, and Ron Howard narrates the show.Arrested Development is shot as a mockumentary, which, in my opinion, is a stroke of genius for this show, because it allows things such as dramatic and situational irony to be used in new ways.  It also adds a lot of humor when the characters refer to things, and ""archive footage"" is inserted (or in some cases, it says ""Footage Not Found"").This is a very different kind of comedy than something like The Simpsons or Seinfeld.  It doesn't revolve around punchlines and their set-up; rather, things happen as they would in real life, only the events in this show are a lot more humorous.  Furthermore, unlike many other comedy shows, the episodes are serialized, meaning that actions in one episode carry over into the next.  In fact, there are subtle hints in many episodes that allude to something that happens in the finale.  And one of the funniest things is that at the end of most episodes, there is a segment where scenes from the next episode are shown.  99% of the time, the scenes don't actually show up, but they fit in with the show's continuity.The characters are extremely developed, and their individual idiosyncrasies are hilarious.  For example, Gob is a crappy magician who thinks that he is the next Houdini.  Unfortunately, his tricks either fail miserably or work too well!  He also thinks that he's much more responsible than he really is.  Lindsay is a woman who loves to get involved with charitable causes... because she likes throwing parties to raise money (one of my favorite was the anti-circumcision group called HOOP; I'll let you figure out what the acronym meant).  And her daughter Maeby often rebels against the causes Lindsay joins, for the sole purpose of rebelling.The guest stars on the show are great as well.  Henry Winkler plays Barry Zuckerkorn, George Sr.'s extremely incompetent attorney who has his own share of legal problems (he actually reminds me a bit of Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons).  Judy Greer plays George's secretary Kitty Sanchez, who is a hypersexual, partygoing, cute-in-a-goofy-way girl who had an affair with George, and thus is in a position of power of Michael (she knows where some incriminating evidence is).  Buster gets a love interest in the form of Lucille Austero (Liza Minelli, who I hate to admit is perfect for the role).  Lucille Austero (AKA Lucille 2) is best friends/social rivals with Lucille Bluth, and it causes a lot of tension between Lucille 1 and Buster, who, as Michael points out, is still attached to his mother's umbilical cord.  And then there is Annyong (Justin Lee), a young Korean boy that Lucille accidentally adopted when Buster was misbehaving one day.  Annyong (which is actually Korean for ""Hello"") and Buster find themselves fighting for Lucille's affection (not that she has much to give) in some very hilarious ways.I can't believe I didn't get into this show sooner; it is one of the funniest comedies that I have ever seen.  Sadly though, it may not be renewed for a third season (it almost didn't get a second, but it won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, so FOX gave it a second chance).  And sadly, I can kind of understand why its ratings are so low.  As I said, it is serialized, and while its easier to jump into midseason than shows like 24 or Alias, it is a show that you have to see a few episodes of in order to fully enjoy it.  Also, as I said, it is a very different kind of humor that not everyone will appreciate.  However, those who do will find a great comedy that will hopefully inspire others and remain on the air for years to come.",5,Astoundingly Funny,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,4737,"['story', 'Bluth',

843057,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0002PYS7Y,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[14, 14]","The format of television we know as a sitcom is dying. The end of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" in May will be the death of the 'filmed before a live studio audience' sitcom. One camera shows like AD are the ones to watch now, and thank god it, and others like it, are here. They are a dying breed. This is the best half hour comedy to hit the top major networks in years and the most critically acclaimed one at that. So naturally, it was a flop in ratings and struggled to stay alive. Typical. The ""Pilot"" episode pretty much sums it up for the show. George Bluth(Jeffrey Tambor), is arrested for insider trading, and the Bluth family realize they need son Michael(Jason Bateman), to help with the family company after his father passed him over for the job. He tries to hold the company in check and to keep his continuously dysfunctional family together. His family includes his cold, icy mother Lucille(Jessica Walter), his spoiled, shallow sister Lindsey(Portia De Rossi), doctor turned struggling actor brother in law Tobias(David Cross), niece Maybe, struggling magician brother Gob(Will Arnett), mama's boy little brother Buster(Tony Hale), and his own son, the hysterically named George Michael(Michael Cera), who has an unhealthy crush on Maybe. The show is also narrated by it's producer, non other than Ron Howard. Every episode is packed with the most brilliant and intelligent writing, and sly references that you will only get if you are truly on your game. It's funny as heck, and impeccably performed, written, and directed. It is a mature and sophiticated humor. The kind that will go over a lot of people's heads if you don't understand it. And a lot don't. Julia Louis Dreyfuss appears as a blind attorney in the classic ""Alter Egos"", and the second part, ""Justice Is Blind"". Henry Winkler has a recurring role as the family attorney. The best stunt casting here is Liza Minnelli, as a socialite with vertigo and a competition between Lucille, and a relationship with Buster. Incredible. Somehow, Carl Weathers figures into it as well. Other incredible moments here include the episode ""Pier Presure"", where Buster tries to score some pot for Liza's handicap. ""In God We Trust"" is another winner where we learn of Tobias' naked hang up. There are way too many good things here to mention. Every episode pretty much hits it out of the park and there are so many things, big or little, in every single episode. It's the most well conceived shows on the air. Who knew Jason Bateman was a comedy god?. The guy's deadpan delivery is so good, you wonder where his emmy is. The rest are just as excellent. Jessica Walter has the perfect demeanor for her role as Lucille, and Arnett and Hale are as perfect as can be. Michael Cera is a tremendous young actor. He really makes George Michael seem like a real kid. Not an actor trying to be what writers think a kid would say and do just to be funny or interesting. And hey, it's always a plus when Jeffrey Tambor is around. This is pitch perfect writing and direction. With it's renewal for a second season, and it's recent emmy win for Best Comedy, Best Writing, and Best Direction, it gives hope that the TV Gods just may be wising up after all.

843058,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0002PYS7Y,B. E Jackson,"[16, 19]","It's a shame Arrested Development only lasted 53 episodes.  But when you think about it, it's really not hard to see why the show was cancelled so early.  Fox is one of those networks that will either deliver totally memorable or totally horrible programming.  There's really no in between.  I never get the urge to scream ""GENIUS!"" when I think about Arrested Development (like many people do) but if you watch a few episodes you'll see what makes the show so funny.  You have to keep in mind that the humor isn't meant to be in your face.  It's *really* important you understand this.Arrested Development never took off for a variety of reasons.  Probably the most obvious reason: most people didn't understand the subtle humor that made the show so popular among certain fans.  I have to admit, I didn't understand the humor at first either.  I couldn't understand if the show was supposed to be a drama or a comedy, and why so much thought and energy was being devoted to strange storyline twists and characters walking around doing weird things.  Eventually the humor clicked, and I began to see there was a REASON for the things that seemed pointless the first time around.  The weirdness had a purpose after all.I began to realize that every single character was MEANT to be in the show, and all the storyline twists and turns that originally seemed so clumsy and unusually-placed were actually all part of the unpredictability factor.  All these things added up to one wild, extremely funny show.Once you get into the characters, the humor will probably make sense.  In my opinion, most of the people who watched one or two episodes and didn't laugh simply couldn't understand the fact that not all humor has to be plainly obvious.  When watching Arrested Development, you have to search for the jokes.I don't think the humor is quite as intelligent as most people will tell you.  I mean, I'm not really a smart guy and I can understand most of the jokes.  The trick to getting into Arrested Development is to REALLY pay attention to *everything* going on.  Pay attention to the characters and the storyline progression.  If you don't, you probably won't see the humor.  It's really that simple (or complicated, I don't know!)That's another problem.  The average person who watches a comedy show has trouble understanding how searching for something is supposed to be funny.  Well, I think what's happening is that a new style of comedy is developing as we speak, and many people don't know how to approach it.  I think a show like the Office is another example of this style of comedy.  The jokes are there, but hidden.  If you give yourself time to search for them, you *will* find them.I think not including a laugh track is confusing to many people.  Without a laugh track some people don't know WHAT to think.  It does NOT mean you are dumb if you can't get into Arrested Development- it simply means you have not yet allowed yourself to look at this style of humor in a new light.  The show is *definitely* not ordinary.  Don't let this throw you off.To be honest, Arrested Development isn't a style of comedy for everyone.  But trust me, there's a reason Arrested Development is respected so much.  What might seem like a pointless storyline at first is probably leading up to something totally twisted that you will *never* expect!  It's all part of the charm.I'll admit, Arrested Development never makes me laugh out loud, but it's a style that's pretty creative and twisted, and makes you crave more when you eventually get into it.  Once you understand the humor you're hooked for life.  Including a laugh track would have RUINED the show.  I believe laugh tracks are starting to become old-fashioned anyway.Don't worry if you can't get into Arrested Development the first couple times you watch an episode.  Just please understand that you HAVE to give it a few serious chances so everything will fall into place in your head.  When that happens, you *will* enjoy it.  It's just too bad the show couldn't hang around for another 100 episodes.",4,pick up all 53 episodes,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,4062,"['shame', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'only', 'lasted', '53', 'episodes', 'when', 'think', 'really', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'so', 'early', 'Fox', 'one', 'networks', 'will', 'either', 'deliver', 'totally', 'memorable', 'totally', 'horrible', 'programming', 'really', 'never', 'get', 'urge', 'scream', 'GENIUS', 'when', 'think', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'watch', 'few', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'funny', 'have', 'keep', 'mind', 'humor', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'face', '*really*', 'important', 'understand', 'this.Arrested', 'Development', 'never', 'took', 'off', 'variety', 'reasons', 'Probably', 'most', 'obvious', 'reason', 'most', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'subtle', 'humor', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'popular', 'certain', 'fans', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'humor', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'show', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'drama', 'comedy', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'thought', 'energy', 'was', 'being', 'devoted', 'strange', 'storyline', 'twists', 'characters', 'walking', 'doing', 'weird', 'things', 'Eventually', 'humor', 'clicked', 'began', 'see', 'was', 'REASON', 'things', 'seemed', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'weirdness', 'had', 'purpose', 'all.I', 'began', 'realize', 'single', 'character', 'was', 'MEANT', 'be', 'show', 'storyline', 'twists', 'originally', 'seemed', 'so', 'clumsy', 'unusually-placed', 'were', 'actually', 'part', 'unpredictability', 'factor', 'things', 'added', 'up', 'one', 'wild', 'extremely', 'funny', 'show.Once', 'get', 'characters', 'humor', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'sense', 'opinion', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'watched', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'fact', 'not', 'humor', 'be', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'When', 'watching', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'have', 'search', 'jokes.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'humor', 'quite', 'as', 'intelligent', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'tell', 'mean', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'smart', 'guy', 'can', 'understand', 'most', 'jokes', 'trick', 'getting', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'REALLY', 'pay', 'attention', '*everything*', 'going', 'Pay', 'attention', 'characters', 'storyline', 'progression', 'do', ""n't"", 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'humor', 'really', 'that', 'simple', 'complicated', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'problem', 'average', 'person', 'who', 'comedy', 'show', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'how', 'searching', 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'Well', 'think', 'what', 'happening', 'new', 'style', 'comedy', 'developing', 'speak', 'many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'approach', 'think', 'show', 'Office', 'example', 'style', 'comedy', 'jokes', 'are', 'there', 'hidden', 'give', 'time', 'search', '*will*', 'find', 'them.I', 'think', 'not', 'including', 'laugh', 'track', 'confusing', 'many', 'people', 'laugh', 'track', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'WHAT', 'think', 'NOT', 'mean', 'are', 'dumb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Arrested', 'Development-', 'simply', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'allowed', 'look', 'style', 'humor', 'new', 'light', 'show', '*definitely*', 'not', 'ordinary', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'throw', 'off.To', 'be', 'honest', 'Arrested', 'Development', ""n't"", 'style', 'comedy', 'everyone', 'reason', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'respected', 'so', 'much', 'What', 'might', 'seem', 'pointless', 'storyline', 'first', 'probably', 'leading', 'up', 'something', 'totally', 'twisted', 'will', '*never*', 'expect', 'part', 'charm.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'never', 'loud', 'style', 'pretty', 'creative', 'twisted', 'crave', 'more', 'when', 'eventually', 'get', 'Once', 'understand', 'humor', ""'re"", 'hooked', 'life', 'Including', 'laugh', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'RUINED', 'show', 'believe', 'tracks', 'are', 'starting', 'become', 'old-fashioned', 'anyway.Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'watch', 'episode', 'Just', 'please', 'understand', 'HAVE', 'give', 'few', 'serious', 'chances', 'so', 'everything', 'will', 'fall', 'place', 'head', 'When', '*will*', 'enjoy', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'hang', 'around', '100', 'episodes']",Arrested Development: Season 1

843072,A3SJ2VSCHZB18,B0002PYS7Y,Brian Markowski,"[0, 0]","I feel sorry for FOX TV because they have a problem with their show ""Arrested Development"". The problem is that this show plays better on DVD then it does on TV. Kudos to FOX for keeping it on the air a second season, but even a slot after The Simpons may not be enough to keep this show on the air for a third season. Luckily for us, the first season is on DVD with plenty of sweet extras to keep a smile on any ""Arrested"" fan's face.The show chronicles the Bluth's, a California family spoiled by the money of their development corporation. In the pilot, the father is sent to jail and the company's assets are frozen. Our dysfunctional family is now forced to deal with the consequences of their greed, selfishness, and just plain weirdness. Jason Bateman plays Michael Bluth, the stable son, who tries to keep his family and business together.Any other sitcom today might play this like a standard living room set where wackiness ensues, but ""Arrested Development"" plays it more like a documentary where wackiness ensues. Producer Ron Howard provides commentary-allowing scenes to flow into one another with more complexity. A great comic cast including, David Cross from ""Mr. Show"", Jeffrey Tambor from ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and Portia de Rossi from ""Ally McBeal"" gel wonderfully together.The real genius of the show is the writing however, comic plots included a character who has a crush on his cousin, an uncle who doesn't know he's gay, and a mother who tries to make her son jealous by adopting an Asian orphan. Which sadly proves that not even the FFC is watching this show on FOX, and here in lies the problem. There are so many hidden and underlining jokes that you get more out of this show watching the episodes back to back over the course of a month than you do trying to keep up with the show every Sunday, unless there's a special, rerun or sports game on.On this DVD you also get cast commentary on a few on the episodes, deleted scenes, and a couple mini-documentaries including a question and answer session with the cast. If you like groundbreaking TV, or igneous comedy, buy this DVD and hope they release season 2 this summer. It may be your only chance to enjoy this show the way it was meant to be enjoyed.",5,This is so good ...it's amazing FOX hasn't cancled it yet.,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,2236,"['feel', 'sorry', 'FOX', 'TV', 'have', 'problem', 'show', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'problem', 'show', 'better', 'DVD', 'then', 'TV', 'Kudos', 'FOX', 'keeping', 'air', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'slot', 'Simpons', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'keep', 'show', 'air', 'third', 'season', 'Luckily', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'plenty', 'sweet', 'extras', 'keep', 'smile', 'Arrested', 'fan', 'face.The', 'show', 'Bluth', 'California', 'family', 'spoiled', 'money', 'development', 'corporation', 'pilot', 'father', 'sent', 'jail', 'company', 'assets', 'are', 'frozen', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'now', 'forced', 'deal', 'consequences', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'just', 'plain', 'weirdness', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Michael', 'Bluth', 'stable', 'son', 'who', 'keep', 'family', 'business', 'together.Any', 'other', 'sitcom', 'today', 'might', 'play', 'standard', 'living', 'room', 'set', 'where', 'wackiness', 'ensues', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'more', 'documentary', 'where', 'wackiness', 'ensues', 'Producer', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'commentary-allowing', 'scenes', 'flow', 'one', 'more', 'complexity', 'great', 'comic', 'cast', 'including', 'David', 'Cross', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Larry', 'Sanders', 'Show', 'Portia', 'de', 'Rossi', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'gel', 'wonderfully', 'together.The', 'real', 'genius', 'show', 'writing', 'however', 'comic', 'plots', 'included', 'character', 'who', 'crush', 'cousin', 'uncle', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'gay', 'mother', 'who', 'make', 'son', 'jealous', 'adopting', 'Asian', 'orphan', 'Which', 'sadly', 'not', 'even', 'FFC', 'watching', 'show', 'FOX', 'here', 'problem', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'hidden', 'underlining', 'jokes', 'get', 'more', 'show', 'watching', 'episodes', 'back', 'back', 'course', 'month', 'do', 'trying', 'keep', 'up', 'show', 'Sunday', 'special', 'rerun', 'sports', 'game', 'DVD', 'also', 'get', 'cast', 'commentary', 'few', 'episodes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'couple', 'mini-documentaries', 'including', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'cast', 'like', 'groundbreaking', 'TV', 'igneous', 'comedy', 'buy', 'DVD', 'hope', 'release', 'season', '2', 'summer', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'chance', 'enjoy', 'show', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'enjoyed']",Arrested Development: Season 1
843073,A2N9OENVXDF643,B0002PYS7Y,Brian M. Benway,"[4, 4]","TV fans owe a debt of gratitude to HBO, who single-handedly raised the bar for intelligent television.  Though it took a few sweeps of the Emmys for network execs to take notice, Fox finally answered the call last year with Arrested Development, a comedy so offbeat and so unlike anything else, that it may be a victim of its own success.A critical darling, but a show trying desperately to find its footing among the TV public, Arrested Development spent much of its brilliant first season teetering on the brink of extinction.  Fox must be commended for having the foresight to keep this gem alive.  Hopefully, with this DVD release, this can't-miss show will gain the foothold it needs.The Bluth family had it all, or so they thought.  But, when their patriarch is arrested for cooking the books of his family's land development company, all of their assets are frozen, and the once wealthy and entitled Bluths find themselves struggling to get by.At the center of this debacle is Michael, the good son who wants nothing more than to keep his family together.  This wouldn't be so hard if it weren't for his family's outrageous and numerous dysfunctions.  Michael is surrounded by an incredibly quirky cast of characters, including his sleazy older brother GOB, an out-of-work magician who was blackballed for revealing his secrets; Lindsay, his conniving younger sister, who tries to turn charity into profit; and Buster, the family's youngest and most inept, who still lives with his mother, and accidentally is dating his mother's best friend.  They're joined by Tobias, Lindsay's sexually ambiguous husband, who lost his medical license for performing CPR on a sleeping man, and who now is pursuing his dreams of becoming an actor.  There's also George Michael, Michael's wonky son who harbors an unnatural crush on his cousin Maeby.  Pulling the strings are the Bluth parents.  The father continues to conduct under-the-table dealings from prison, and the manipulative mother dedicates her time to pitting her children against one another, even going so far as to adopt a Korean child to make Buster jealous.Of course, it is truly impossible to describe Arrested Development.  The show, though absolutely absurd, truly believes in the world that it has created, and the writing plays brilliantly off of the character's traits.  Filmed with a single camera, Arrested Development has the look of a documentary, which further grounds the ""reality"" of the show.  The wise omission of a laugh track allows the writers and actors to pack more gags per minute than any show before it.  Indeed, some people may find it hard to find a show funny when no one has told them to laugh, but the true pleasure of the show is that you can discover the humor yourself.Arrested Development is perfect for DVD.  Even if you've seen every episode, the show is even more rewarding on a second viewing.  There are so many subtle gags and references that you simply can't get them all the first time.  It's also a great tool to convert your friends to show, as all it will take is the 40 minutes to watch ""Visiting Ours"" and ""Pier Pressure"" to get someone hooked.The DVDs present a very sharp picture on par with the HD broadcasts.  The sound is just Dolby ProLogic, but it gets the job done.  The extras are varied.  I wished there had been more behind-the-scenes stuff, but what's there is interesting.  The deleted scenes are hit-or-miss.All in all Arrested Development is a must-own for any fan of truly intelligent comedy.  This show joins the ranks of the elite, along with The Larry Sanders Show, Mr. Show, and NewsRadio.",5,Quite possibly the finest TV comedy ever!

By the amount of 5 star reviews and buzz about this show, I was expecting it to be better than the Simpsons, the Office and Seinfeld combined. If anyone is familiar with sketch or other type of tv/movie comedies you quickly see that there are a lot of rip-offs. Naming a character George Michael is not funny and is very unoriginal. The movie ""Office Space"" has a character named Michael Bolton (get it - the singer). Also, David Cross in his other works has used this ploy of using funny or ironic names for characters (News Reporters named 'Mace' or 'Clint Dirk', etc.).Besides dissecting all the other rip-offs or unoriginal jokes in this show, I'll just say for the 100 or so jokes that they try to cram in this show about 2 or 3 of them are actually funny and or original. The characters are also super annoying and way over the top (in a bad way). The general plot of the show is absurd and unrealistic. And the show just gets way too quirky and cutesy. Plus, why must almost every Fox comedy show (or for that matter any show that questions the viewer's intelligence) have a narrator talking to you throughout the whole show?

843078,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0002PYS7Y,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[7, 11]","Review of whole series not just one episode.Lots of Americans grew up in family businesses. I was one of them and I think running your own business does build a certain kind of insanity through the family. No one epitomizes this better than the beleaguered Bluth family. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is that one sane one whereas his mother, his brothers, his sister, et al, swirl around him pursuing their own best interests (never anyone else's best interests and certainly not the family business's best interest). Ron Howard who produced the show also narrates it and does a wonderful job of it. The business is tanking in the wake of the senior Bluth's (the pater familias) financial wrongdoing within the firm.The biggest discovery for me on this show was Michael's lothario older brother played by Will Arnett. I have been tuning in Will Arnett ever since this show and he is funny in everything I see. I had never seen him before this show. Most recently I saw him vie with Alec Baldwin's Jack on 30 ROCK for NBC's CEO position. He played a gay corporate type to perfection.I loved Jeffrey Tambor on LARRY SANDERS so was glad to see him playing the pater familias and his twin brother Oscar. Tambor always brings a level of inept smarminess to his semi villainous characters. They don't ever quite make it to being villains because he is always shooting himself in the foot as he tries to pull off a nefarious act. His character is in prison in this series and he is particularly self absorbed yet bumbling from there. if the father is smarmy, the mother, played by Jessica Walter, is the ultimate as the matriarch with a thousand schemes afoot, all to promote her own best interests.

And when I say that I don't mean in the traditional sense where you slap your knee and scream, ""Get It?!"" Rather I mean funny that makes you jealous because you realize that the people who write this show are so much funnier than you are.  I am currently working my way through ""The Cosby Show"" season 1 and it is stunning to me how inadequate its intelligence is when stacked up against ""Arrested Development."" There are no jokes about incest or an aged movie star playing broke, or ""Gilligan's Island"" on ""The Cosby Show."" Also, any storylines that involve parents teaching kids a lesson would not involve any drug busts or the exploitation of missing body parts.  It is much more appropriate to compare this show to TV comedies that actually have a brain such as ""Soap"" (also involving a very messed up family) and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (which also has a great understanding of the power of continuity).  This show, with it's depiction of a family shaken to the core after their father and meal ticket goes to jail for some ""light treason,"" attacks the epidemic in today's society in which rich kids refuse to work a day in their life.  Take Tobias for example, he uses the money that was meant to get his medical license back to purchase acting lessons from Carl Weathers.  Of course his acting skills are utterly non-existent, but he need not worry about that for his bread has already been buttered and it's easier to pretend to be a frightened inmate than it is to actually be a doctor.  The rest of the family partakes in such stand-in professions as magician, activist, and housewife.  That is if they work at all.  When family leader and main character Michael demand that the family start earning the paychecks they pick up every week Tobias and Gob decide to start a coffee shop.  It goes without saying that they would never actually work in a coffee shop, and that is very representative of many coddled, rich kids in our country.  As a manager of a Manhattan coffee shop I have one of these children working under me.  He overuses the words existential and bourgeoisie, and constantly tells me he SHOULD be working at a university doing academic research.  But if he is so smart then why can't he figure out the virtue of punctuality? And why can't the Bluth's figure out that Carl Weathers in obviously starving, and that there lawyer is incompetent, and that Buster has been smothered beyond repair? Because they are rich not smart, and despite the lies we were told in school there is no real correlation between the two. Then again, any wealth accumulated by the writers of this show is AOK with me because they obviously used their brain to get it.  I would tell them to pass some of that intelligence on to their characters, but that wouldn't be smart, would it?  7.22 out of 10.",4,Who Are These People?,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,2831,"['show', 'brutally', 'funny', 'when', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'traditional', 'sense', 'where', 'slap', 'knee', 'scream', 'Get', 'mean', 'funny', 'jealous', 'realize', 'people', 'who', 'write', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'funnier', 'are', 'am', 'currently', 'working', 'way', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'season', '1', 'stunning', 'how', 'inadequate', 'intelligence', 'when', 'stacked', 'up', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'are', 'jokes', 'incest', 'aged', 'movie', 'star', 'playing', 'broke', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Also', 'storylines', 'involve', 'parents', 'teaching', 'kids', 'lesson', 'would', 'not', 'involve', 'drug', 'busts', 'exploitation', 'missing', 'body', 'parts', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'compare', 'show', 'TV', 'comedies', 'actually', 'have', 'brain', 'such', 'Soap', 'also', 'involving', 'very', 'messed', 'up', 'family', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'also', 'great', 'understanding', 'power', 'continuity', 'show', 'depiction', 'family', 'shaken', 'core', 'father', 'meal', 'ticket', 'jail', 'light', 'treason', 'epidemic', 'today', 'society', 'rich', 'kids', 'refuse', 'work', 'day', 'life', 'Take', 'Tobias', 'example', 'money', 'was', 'meant', 'get', 'medical', 'license', 'back', 'purchase', 'acting', 'lessons', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'course', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'utterly', 'non-existent', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'bread', 'already', 'been', 'buttered', 'easier', 'pretend', 'be', 'frightened', 'inmate', 'actually', 'be', 'doctor', 'rest', 'family', 'partakes', 'such', 'stand-in', 'professions', 'magician', 'activist', 'housewife', 'work', 'When', 'family', 'leader', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'demand', 'family', 'start', 'earning', 'paychecks', 'pick', 'up', 'week', 'Tobias', 'Gob', 'decide', 'start', 'coffee', 'shop', 'saying', 'would', 'never', 'actually', 'work', 'coffee', 'shop', 'very', 'representative', 'many', 'coddled', 'rich', 'kids', 'country', 'manager', 'Manhattan', 'coffee', 'shop', 'have', 'one', 'children', 'working', 'words', 'existential', 'bourgeoisie', 'constantly', 'tells', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'working', 'university', 'doing', 'academic', 'research', 'so', 'smart', 'then', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'virtue', 'punctuality', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Bluth', 'figure', 'out', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'obviously', 'starving', 'lawyer', 'incompetent', 'Buster', 'been', 'smothered', 'repair', 'are', 'rich', 'not', 'smart', 'lies', 'were', 'told', 'school', 'real', 'correlation', 'two', 'Then', 'again', 'wealth', 'accumulated', 'writers', 'show', 'AOK', 'obviously', 'used', 'brain', 'get', 'would', 'tell', 'pass', 'intelligence', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'smart', 'would', '7.22', '10']",Arrested Development: Season 1

Its documentary-like storytelling based around a quirky family, where executive George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) goes to prison and his son Michael (Jason Bateman) must take over the company and shepherd his siblings, with frequent flashbacks makes for comedy that I can best compare to Wes Anderson's filmThe Royal Tenenbaums. While the writing is at a high level, with complex plotlines and jokes that play themselves out across episodes (or disappear only to return a season later), but the writers also had to work within the constraints of a FOX sitcom, and one of its successes is how cleverly they chafe at their situation. References to sitcom tropes abound, such as a character joining the military, the matriarch adopting a child only to have him quickly disposed of, and dramas of who someone's real father is.The strong writing couldn't succeed without strong acting. Rarely have I seen a cast so believable as a family, with Bateman as the responsible middle son carrying on a convincing rapport with Will Arnett as his loser elder brother George Oscar ""GOB"" Bluth and Tony Hale as his neurotic younger brother Buster, as well as Portia Rossi as his airhead twin sister Lindsey. I first became familiar with Will Arnett's acting when he played a hyperbolic pervert soon killed by a sex machine on a Human Giant sketch. His part of GOB is considerably more tame, and elicits as much sympathy as laughter. Just as fine as the central parts, however, are the guest parts: Henry Winkler as a seedy lawyer, Amy Poehler as a manic seal trader whom GOB marries on a dare, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a blind attorney.If you only know this programme from when it was broadcasted, the DVD is still worthwhile, as there's a lot of freeze-frame details that make it all even funnier. That said, the series was funny well beyond season one, and the DVD set of all three seasons goes in some places for little more than this set of season one only.",4,"A fantastic series, but considering getting the discounted set of all three seasons instead of just season 1",1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,2108,"['really', 'do', 'regret', 'never', 'seeing', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'three-season', 'run', '2003-2006', 'one', 'few', 'television', 'comedy', 'programmes', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'documentary-like', 'storytelling', 'based', 'quirky', 'family', 'where', 'executive', 'George', 'Bluth', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'prison', 'son', 'Michael', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'must', 'take', 'company', 'shepherd', 'siblings', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'comedy', 'can', 'best', 'compare', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'filmThe', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'writing', 'high', 'level', 'complex', 'plotlines', 'jokes', 'play', 'out', 'episodes', 'disappear', 'only', 'return', 'season', 'later', 'writers', 'also', 'had', 'work', 'constraints', 'FOX', 'sitcom', 'one', 'successes', 'how', 'cleverly', 'chafe', 'situation', 'References', 'sitcom', 'tropes', 'abound', 'such', 'character', 'joining', 'military', 'matriarch', 'adopting', 'child', 'only', 'have', 'quickly', 'disposed', 'dramas', 'who', 'someone', 'real', 'father', 'is.The', 'strong', 'writing', 'could', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'strong', 'acting', 'Rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'cast', 'so', 'believable', 'family', 'Bateman', 'responsible', 'middle', 'son', 'carrying', 'convincing', 'rapport', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'loser', 'elder', 'brother', 'George', 'Oscar', 'GOB', 'Bluth', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'neurotic', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buster', 'as', 'well', 'Portia', 'Rossi', 'airhead', 'twin', 'sister', 'Lindsey', 'first', 'became', 'familiar', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'acting', 'when', 'played', 'hyperbolic', 'pervert', 'soon', 'killed', 'sex', 'machine', 'Human', 'Giant', 'sketch', 'part', 'GOB', 'considerably', 'more', 'tame', 'as', 'much', 'sympathy', 'laughter', 'Just', 'as', 'fine', 'central', 'parts', 'however', 'are', 'guest', 'parts', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'seedy', 'lawyer', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'manic', 'seal', 'trader', 'whom', 'GOB', 'marries', 'dare', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'blind', 'attorney.If', 'only', 'know', 'programme', 'when', 'was', 'broadcasted', 'DVD', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'lot', 'freeze-frame', 'details', 'make', 'even', 'funnier', 'said', 'series', 'was', 'funny', 'well', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'set', 'three', 'seasons', 'places', 'little', 'more', 'set', 'season', 'one', 'only']",Arrested Development: Season 1

The show starts off quickly, introducing us to all of the characters in a witty and interesting manner that drew me right in.

It's hard to argue with a show that can produce such a greedy, manipulative, and disfunctional family as this one.Among the great characterizations are subtle references and small little side-stories that you really have to pay attention to really notice. The show will make light of these things, some more obvious that others; all of them hilarious.I definitely recommend this show to anyone seeking an outrageously funny, completely non-serious comedy about real life.

It's a shame that so few people watched the first season...They missed out.Once you watch one episode, it becomes apparent why Arrested Development was the winner of the Emmy for Best Comedy.  Every element of the show works together to create laugh-out-loudable comedy.  The writers behind the show are immensely clever and set up each joke wonderfully.Another overlooked asset to the show is the breakthrough camera-work.  Instead of the still/panning cameras like those in most sitcoms, it has the slight feeling like it's being filmed by an amateur cameraperson, because of the zooming in and out and the occasional jittering.  But believe me, this is not a bad thing, and is used often in a very comedic way, such as zooming into a face at just the right time, often at awkward, silent moments.  Often the awkward, silent moments are the funniest in the show.Credit should also go to the actors and actresses in the show.  They play their parts extremely well and were cast perfectly, in my opinion.  The show is very clever in bringing out each character's eccentricities and developing mirthful scenarios around them.If you have not watched Arrested Development, be sure to watch it with an open mind, because it is not like most comedy programs on television.  But once I kept watching, I was thoroughly addicted, and can't wait to see what next season holds.The show's plots are never meant to be dramatic, but still, there can be a few moving moments; although they are usually broken open by a following joke.  In general, this show quite well avoids the usual trite situations and storylines that most shows continue to repeat.  I found myself caught off-guard many a time by little surprises in the storylines that had me hurling myself off the couch and into a fetal position on the floor, rolling with laughter.I give this one of my highest recommendations.",5,Best show I ever watched,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2006,"['TV', 'gone', 'lot', 'different', 'comedy', 'shows', 'styles', 'was', 'time', 'something', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'showed', 'up', 'shame', 'so', 'few', 'people', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'missed', 'out.Once', 'watch', 'one', 'episode', 'apparent', 'why', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'was', 'winner', 'Emmy', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Every', 'element', 'show', 'together', 'create', 'laugh-out-loudable', 'comedy', 'writers', 'show', 'are', 'immensely', 'clever', 'set', 'up', 'joke', 'wonderfully.Another', 'overlooked', 'asset', 'show', 'breakthrough', 'camera-work', 'Instead', 'still/panning', 'cameras', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'slight', 'feeling', 'being', 'filmed', 'amateur', 'cameraperson', 'zooming', 'occasional', 'jittering', 'believe', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'used', 'often', 'very', 'comedic', 'way', 'such', 'zooming', 'face', 'just', 'right', 'time', 'often', 'awkward', 'silent', 'moments', 'Often', 'awkward', 'silent', 'moments', 'are', 'funniest', 'show.Credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'actors', 'actresses', 'show', 'play', 'parts', 'extremely', 'well', 'were', 'cast', 'perfectly', 'opinion', 'show', 'very', 'clever', 'bringing', 'out', 'character', 'eccentricities', 'developing', 'mirthful', 'scenarios', 'them.If', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'open', 'mind', 'not', 'most', 'comedy', 'programs', 'television', 'once', 'kept', 'watching', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'addicted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'season', 'holds.The', 'show', 'plots', 'are', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'dramatic', 'still', 'can', 'be', 'few', 'moving', 'moments', 'are', 'usually', 'broken', 'open', 'following', 'joke', 'general', 'show', 'quite', 'well', 'usual', 'trite', 'situations', 'storylines', 'most', 'shows', 'continue', 'repeat', 'found', 'caught', 'off-guard', 'many', 'time', 'little', 'surprises', 'storylines', 'had', 'hurling', 'couch', 'fetal', 'position', 'floor', 'rolling', 'laughter.I', 'give', 'one', 'highest', 'recommendations']",Arrested Development: Season 1

Michael Bluth, is a twin middle child who has the smarts to keep the family afloat.

Every member of the cast is so diverse, each brings a different style of comedy that blends perfectfully together.This is a thinkings mans comedy.

Jason Bateman is the perfect deadpan center of the action.  He is surrounded by some of the best actors working in series television.  Some, like Jeffery Tambor, I knew going in from his brilliant turn on 'The Larry Sanders Show'.  Others are totally new, but they are all equally talented.  Each character is totally distinct with their own set of quirks.Second, the writing is amazing.  The humor of the show grows as it goes along.  This makes a show that really pays off committed viewing.  The characters are effected by the events of prior episodes and react in unexpected ways.  By the tenth episode, you laughing harder at these 'inside' jokes than you are to more obvious ones.  It plays out that way from episode to episode.  Like 'Seinfeld' a given episode is carried through more often by a theme than single plot line.  That gives the large cast some room to breathe.  Everyone does not have to be in the same room at the same time.Third, the Newport Beach setting is sort of fresh.  It is nice to see parts of Southern California that have not been recycled 100 times.Fourth, the one camera and no laugh track thing is a lot less cheesy than the standard three camera sitcom.  For one thing, it allows the story to move around a little more.  That also allows the writers to keep the gags fresh by putting them in different settings.Fifth, it is a show well served by digital technology.

843131,AE3UVCX1AI3DS,B0002PYS7Y,"""eghan6""","[0, 1]","The world of half-hour televised comedy needed a good shot in the arm.  It came in the form of the Bluth family.  If you have grown weary of the idiosyncratic behaviour of the run of the mill sitcom families as seen on Raymond, King of Queens, Yes Dear, 8 Simple Rules, My Wife and Kids and so on then Arrested Development will feel like a fresh pallete of family disfunction.I am a fan of the single-camera comedy productions but Arrested leans more to the witty and circumstantial comedy that was seen on the innnovator of single-camera comedy, The Larry Sanders Show.  Curb Your Enthusiasm is getting a good run for its money as the events unfolding for the Bluth Family saga provide some of the most original and comedic writing this year -- on any show.The key...characterization.  There is no single character that demands the spotlight as they all possess foibles that avail them ample recognition.  GOB, the entertainer; always aware that the camera is on him and so he feels obligated to become his own dramatic sequence, culling inspiration from dated and hackneyed dramatic devices.  He may easily be the funniest of the ""normal"" characters on the show.  Then there's Buster; sheer commitment to timidity is all I can say about this actor.  Buster's panic attacks and faux bravados serve as great physical comedy to GOB's verbal comedy.  George Sr., the source of the disfunction is well-played by Emmy-nominated Geoffrey Tambor as his vices and complacency know no bounds.  And Michael, the straight-man to everyone else is underrated as it is through his eyes do we see the absurdity that is the Bluth family.Now the stories, great episodes include Pilot, Bringing Up Buster, Let 'Em Eat Cake, and well the other 19 episodes that I won't mention here because this series is just that a series.  It does not rely on stand-alone episodes and one-off humour.

The show is hiliariously irreverent (sometimes ""spicy""), well-written, with casting that is simply genius.

Jeffery Tambor plays the patriarch who has built up a sizeable fortune building homes and developing real estate.  However, all is not well within the empire, and as the legal troubles mount, the eccentric personalities simply add to the mess that is becoming their lives.  The rest of the cast is stellar, without a weak link: Buster, the infantile younger brother, Gob (pronounced ""Jobe""), the older brother who dreams of being a magician and has a very high opinion of himself, Lindsay, the shallow daughter who vacillates between financial hedonism and questionable causes, Tobias, the bro-in-law whose sexuality is vague, Lucille, the mother of the clan who is all about furs and martini lunches.

843138,A2V6T24IY09M0X,B0002PYS7Y,Felix Felicis,"[7, 8]","Yes, you read that right. There has never been a show as funny or as unique as Arrested Development. You may think the dysfunctional family idea is played out on network TV, but believe me you have never seen it played quite like this. For one thing, the format of the show allows for a lot more comedy than a typical sitcom; it's shot like a single camera documentary, complete with narration, except the characters never address the camera directly - which helps to keep it more believable. Plus, on top of the frequently absurd and hilarious situations the Bluths manage to get themselves into, the narrator is a source of humor as well, as are the quick flashback edits that not only reveal info about our characters but allow for lots of running gags throughout. A lot of great character development comes from these montages and one-shot visual gags.The first season focuses on the plight of Michael Bluth (a stellar Jason Bateman), who has toiled away at his family's land development company for years and is finally at the point where he is expecting a promotion - which never comes, much to his chagrin, although we later learn why in a rare poignant moment. He wants bigger and better things for himself and his overly-neurotic son, George Michael (Michael Cera). His father, George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor), has run the company for years - often with shady deals or outright fraud - and isn't exactly the best role model for Michael or his son. Neither is his mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), an alcoholic control freak who has a habit of saying the nastiest thing that pops into her head.This has had a disturbing effect on the children in the Bluth household. While Michael is the most ""normal"" of the bunch, he is still sometimes self-centered and strict towards his son, though they do truly love each other and he's only trying to be a good parent since his wife died. His siblings, however, are far less lucky. His older brother, George Oscar Bluth III (Will Arnett) - or GOB, pronounced ""Job"" - is a failed ""illusionist"" and lothario who still constantly seeks approval from his father; his younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is a sheltered child-like buffoon who still lives with their mother. And his ""twin"" sister, Lindsay (Portia di Rossi), is a sexually frustrated, rebellious money-grubber who is married (out of spite) to Dr. Tobias Funke (David Cross), an analyst/therapist - or analrapist, if you will - who has lost his license to practice medicine and now wishes to become an actor. Their daughter, Maeby (Alia Shawkat), tends to ignore them both and isn't very attached to the notion of school or learning, though her own rebellious schemes are quite clever. George Michael has a taboo crush on her, which results in a lot of humorous problems for him throughout the series.The plotting is quite dense, especially for a comedy. There are frequently long joke arcs that run over multiple episodes or even seasons, but when they pay off they are MUCH funnier than anything else on television, ever. Some of these in Season 1 include - GOB's hilariously bad illusions, Buster and Annyong's rivalry, Michael's terrible luck with women, George Michael's pining for his cousin, Tobias' miserable attempts to succeed as an actor (""We're having a FIRE...sale!""), and lots of others. Many times, a single line of dialogue can have several different meanings and can also reveal a major secret about a character (For example, the seemingly innocuous phrase ""Justice is blind"" ends up destroying a relationship AND a court case, all at once). There are lots of puns and clever word-play, a lost art form single handedly resuurected by this show, and Tobias rountinely uses highly suggestive double-entendres with gay undertones, such as - ""Unfortunately, I've shot my wad on what was supposed to be something of a dry run and now I've got a bit of a mess on my hands."" The trouble that all the characters get into usually directly their own doing and often waaaay out there but since all the actors play it straight they never seem contrived or forced and somehow manage to become even funnier.Several other minor characters pop in regularly - the best being Judy Greer as George's lover and secretary Kitty, who has a habit of exposing herself; and Justin Lee as the lovable Korean adoptee Annyong (literally ""Hello""), who Lucille adopts just to spite Buster. Carl Weathers plays a parody of himself as a cheapskate out-of-work actor; Henry Winkler (yes, Fonzie) plays the incompetent, closet homosexual Bluth lawyer Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays an attorney as well, one with a penchant for lying that creates several awkward moments; and Amy Poehler is hilarious as GOB's seal-selling wife (she is Will Arnett's wife in real life). Special mention, however, goes to Liza Minneli, who plays Lucille's vertigo-prone neighbor Lucille Austero (or Lucille 2), and also Jeffrey Tambor - not only is he a riot as George Sr. (who in prison for most of the season, and loves it), but he also plays George's twin brother Oscar, and manages to make him a totally different character (as a pot-smoking hippie who's in love with Lucille and may or may not be Buster's real father).DVD is the preferable way to watch this series, because as I said earlier the jokes build on each other and become funnier when viewed in proper sequence (and of course, no commercials). The set also includes great commentaries on the Extended Pilot, ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake"", plus a cast panel discussion and plently of deleted/extented scenes and bloopers. I would recommend buying both Seasons 1 and 2 together - not only will your AD marathon last longer, but you'll save money and Season 2 is even better than this one (which I didn't think was possible, but trust me, it is). So, if you're tired of cliche filled, laugh-track laden network comedy, spend some time with the Bluth family and see what you're missing. They put the fun back in ""dysfunctional"". I mean, COME ON!!!",5,COME ON!

George Michael is unbelievably uncomfortable at any time, GOB is likeable due to his unlikeability (word?), and Michael is the dependable great guy with few character flaws and a massive conscience.

Arrested Development, the funniest comedy in the last 10 years, is being taken off the air by Fox after three seasons. Meanwhile, Stacked is in its second season on Fox; Yes, Dear in its, what, ninth?! (I lost count); and many other crap-tastic sitcoms are still running. Where is the Punisher when we need him?Anyway, this is a review of the 1st season DVD set (which you have to buy, or you aren't...human), so listen newbies: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the only sane person in his family. His older brother Gob (Will Arnett) is a failed magician, excuse me, 'illusionist,' who always relies on Michael to get him out of tight spots; younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) is a thirtysomething still living with and relying on their mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), a selfish, alcohol-sipping woman; twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is unhappily married to struggling actor Tobias Funke (David Cross), and their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat) is in the middle of their shall-we-divorce-or-separate-or...etc.; and Michael's son George Michael (Michael Cera) is in love with Maeby, but she's his COUSIN! Oh yeah, and Michael's father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) passed Michael over for president of the Bluth housing company and is then arrested for embezzling from the company. With these people, who needs enemies?This is all the first episode, folks (give or take a plot point in the second and third). Unique in so many ways (no laugh track, thank God; filmed like a documentary; narration by executive producer Ron Howard; one of the best ensemble casts on television ever), it's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Yet it's one of the lowest-rated shows (in viewers, not reviews, which it dominates in) on television, and it was in danger of being cancelled its first season. So I suppose Fox was brave to give it two pity seasons (but the Emmys didn't hurt their decision, either). Buy the set and see what you've been missing, or if you HAVE been watching it, enjoy one of the best comedies around over and over again.

843148,AAIL33CYCT47J,B0002PYS7Y,Gregory Baird,"[12, 13]","'Arrested Development' is one of the most criminally underwatched shows in the history of television. The cast is pitch perfect from the principles to the guests and right down to the superb narration by producer Ron Howard. The writing is pure genius, weaving the saga of the Bluth family into a comedic goldmine. You see, the Bluths are a spoiled, self centered family whose world is turned upside down when the patriarch, George, lands himself in prison for some shifty accounting in the family business. It is up to Michael, the good son, to hold his family together in the face of financial ruin and to keep the business afloat. This is no easy task considering that his family ruins the best of his intentions at every turn. His mother, Lucille, is a lush WASP who sees her children as an inconvenience until she can get something out of them -- a role that Jessica Walter makes sympathetic through her brilliant performance (and watch for Liza Minnelli's appearances as Lucille's vertigo-suffering social nemesis, Lucille 2). Brother Gob (pronounced like the biblical figure Job) is a reckless womanizer and aspiring illusionist, while younger brother Buster is a hopeless man-child stuck in the role of Mama's boy. Twin sister Lindsay is a misguided activist, whose pet projects inevitably fall victim to her wandering attention span and need for pampering. Brother-in-law Tobias is a failed psychologist and failing actor and, in a running joke, blessedly unaware of his repressed homosexuality. To top matters off, his son, George Michael, seems to have developed a crush on his rebellious cousin, Maebe. Also on hand is the great Henry Winkler (once known as the Fonz) in a recurring role as the Bluth's hopelessly inept lawyer, Barry Zuckerkorn. You would think that their myriad plotlines would get out of hand, but the writers manage to keep them in check. And wherever the plotlines go, laughs follow. I have never laughed so hard at a TV show as I have watching 'Arrested Development'. It is actually beneficial to have the DVD so you can rewind if your laughing makes you miss some of the lines. The really great thing is that the humor never wore thin during the show's two and a half season run, but it's best to start at the beginning with season one because, unlike most sitcoms, 'Arrested Development' is a linear show -- what happens in one episode effects what happens in the next. When you're finished with the first season I feel confident that you'll race out to get seasons two and three. It's that good.I would particularly recommend 'Arrested Development' to fans of 'The Office' -- the only show that comes close to Development's perfection -- because they have the same type of humor. It is a shame that we won't be getting any new episodes of 'Arrested Development', but at least we can still enjoy the show with the DVDs.",5,Give the brilliant show its due on DVD,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,2855,"[""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'one', 'most', 'criminally', 'underwatched', 'shows', 'history', 'television', 'cast', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'principles', 'guests', 'right', 'down', 'superb', 'narration', 'producer', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'writing', 'pure', 'genius', 'weaving', 'saga', 'Bluth', 'family', 'comedic', 'goldmine', 'see', 'Bluths', 'are', 'spoiled', 'centered', 'family', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'patriarch', 'George', 'prison', 'shifty', 'accounting', 'family', 'business', 'Michael', 'good', 'son', 'hold', 'family', 'together', 'face', 'financial', 'ruin', 'keep', 'business', 'afloat', 'easy', 'task', 'considering', 'family', 'best', 'intentions', 'turn', 'mother', 'Lucille', 'lush', 'WASP', 'who', 'children', 'inconvenience', 'can', 'get', 'something', 'role', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'sympathetic', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'watch', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'appearances', 'Lucille', 'vertigo-suffering', 'social', 'nemesis', 'Lucille', '2', 'Gob', 'pronounced', 'biblical', 'figure', 'Job', 'reckless', 'womanizer', 'aspiring', 'illusionist', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buster', 'hopeless', 'man-child', 'stuck', 'role', 'Mama', 'boy', 'Twin', 'sister', 'Lindsay', 'misguided', 'activist', 'pet', 'projects', 'inevitably', 'fall', 'victim', 'wandering', 'attention', 'span', 'need', 'pampering', 'Brother-in-law', 'Tobias', 'failed', 'psychologist', 'failing', 'actor', 'running', 'joke', 'blessedly', 'unaware', 'repressed', 'homosexuality', 'top', 'matters', 'off', 'son', 'George', 'Michael', 'have', 'developed', 'crush', 'rebellious', 'cousin', 'Maebe', 'Also', 'hand', 'great', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'once', 'known', 'Fonz', 'recurring', 'role', 'Bluth', 'hopelessly', 'inept', 'lawyer', 'Barry', 'Zuckerkorn', 'would', 'think', 'myriad', 'plotlines', 'would', 'get', 'hand', 'writers', 'manage', 'keep', 'check', 'plotlines', 'go', 'laughs', 'follow', 'have', 'never', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'watching', ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'actually', 'beneficial', 'have', 'DVD', 'can', 'rewind', 'laughing', 'miss', 'lines', 'really', 'great', 'thing', 'humor', 'never', 'wore', 'thin', 'show', 'two', 'half', 'season', 'run', 'best', 'start', 'beginning', 'season', 'one', 'because', 'most', 'sitcoms', ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'linear', 'show', 'what', 'one', 'episode', 'effects', 'what', 'next', 'When', ""'re"", 'finished', 'first', 'season', 'feel', 'confident', ""'ll"", 'race', 'out', 'get', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'good.I', 'would', 'particularly', 'recommend', ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'fans', ""'The"", 'Office', 'only', 'show', 'close', 'Development', 'perfection', 'have', 'same', 'type', 'humor', 'shame', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'new', 'episodes', ""'Arrested"", 'Development', 'least', 'can', 'still', 'enjoy', 'show', 'DVDs']",Arrested Development: Season 1

The story of a wealthy family's undoing due to illegal business practices makes for great comedy, as does the utterly dysfunctional family dynamic between all the characters.  Each character has their own quirks and motivations, and all are extremely well written and very well acted.It's important to watch these in order, because the storylines do continue, and previous episodes and jokes are referenced in later shows.This DVD set has a lot of great extras, like the commentaries and the featurette.

However, this hype kept me away from this show. In reading about it, nothing seemed to appeal to me, nothing reached out and said, ""watch this"". But then, came the DVD, and on a whim, I thought I'd try it.Simply put:I haven't laughed this hard, out loud,  at a comedy television show in years.Arrested Development is a tour de force of comedy. It starts with the writing, which is, bar none, the finest in all of television land. In the creation of the Bluths, a narcissistic, troubled, and yet somehow endearing, family, we have a group of people that are both grounded and crazy at the same time. The characters are strong, fresh. The plotlines totally unconceivable and yet real. The writing is A+.Then, the actors. To pull off this craziness, you need a group of people, who buy into the vision and manage to make it real. Who would have thought that Jason Bateman could be the center of this insanity and pull it off with great talent? Portia de Rossi as a clueless socialite? Jeffrey Tambor's adjustment to prison life? All of the people turn in such classic work that they all deserve Emmys for incredible performances.Rumor has it that Fox is cutting the second second of this show short. Sure, create a visionary, ground breaking television show, and clip its wings before it truly takes flight. Had that happened to other shows in their infancy, we wouldn't have spent a decade with Seinfeld and Cheers. I implore the channel to reconsider their decision, and give Arrested Development a chance to breathe.

Witty and slapstick silly and non sequitur weirdness all at the same time, this show boasts one of the best casts in television, and the best collection of offbeat characters not in animation.  It bears a resemblance in structure and approach to the Royal Tenenbaums (but this show has even more laughs, and is more rewatchable), so if you liked the Royal Tenenbaums or Family Guy or the peak years of the Simpsons, you'll love this show.  You know a show is great when the so called straight character  (Michael, played by Jason Bateman), has some of the best lines in the show.  Bateman is perfect with the character, he is able to balance understated sarcasm and likable human decency in a way that few actors can achieve, particularly in an oddball comedy such as this.The sleazy magician Gob, played by Will Arnett, is consistently hilarious and an ingenious comic creation.  David Cross and Jeffrey Tambor, two great comic actors from cult HBO TV shows (""Mr. Show"" and the ""Larry Sanders Show""), are also fantastic as the sexually dubious Tobias and the oblivious Patriarch of the family.  Every member of the cast has his or her moments, and each character adds something to the Seinfeld-esque interwoven plots.  The only weakness in the show, is the whole cousin crush subplot that lingered a little bit too long, and it was--intentionally--kinda creepy.Nonetheless this is one of the few items I'd recommend to someone who hasn't even seen a single episode, to just jump in and buy the DVD.

843165,A2M3BWCCNU7PPN,B0002PYS7Y,J. B,"[15, 146]","This show does have its funny parts but the fact of the matter is it's just not entertaining enough to warrant the half an hour. It's really hard to pin-point what's actually wrong with this show. The characters are likable enough, the story is fairly witty and entertaining but the whole overall concept just doesn't gel.It almost appears as if when casting for this show they took the cheap, safe avenue by getting a bunch of washed-up or unknown actors to star in it. To compensate for this as the series progresses they have MANY famous actors featuring on a regular basis. This is very a tricky casting technique, and this is going to hurt them in the long run. It's a very sneaky attempt to cheaply broaden their target audience by hiring the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfus from Seinfeld, Harry Winkler from Happy days, Amy Poehler from SNL to name only a few. It seems that they've tried to feature every actor in existence which starred in a successful show in a pathetic attempt to keep the ratings afloat. This isn't going to work, and you watch this series not last more than 4 seasons and it will only last that long because of Ron Howard's fat wallet.(Review update, now it has been officially cancelled. I told you so! How much do I rule?)I've heard some people claim this show is the new Seinfeld which is not only laughable but insulting to Jerry Seinfeld and friends. Arrested Developments downfall is the fact that the show has zero re-watchability. The episodes are more of a chore to watch at the best of times, and if you happen to come across a repeat that you've seen before you can forget about watching it again unless you like pulling teeth. That's what separates shows like this from the likes of Seinfeld; you can watch the same Seinfeld episode several times and it's still funny and entertaining. Arrested Development lacks this all important attribute, and will ultimately result in the demise of the series.If you ever see this review Ron, and wish to save your show from certain cancellation then hit me up and I'll be happy to provide you with some advice on how to fix this show although the damage may already be done.The conclusion to my review is that Arrested Development doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be. The story continues from week to week, but the story itself is dead with nowhere to go. If the father ever gets out of jail the shows over, if the remaining family members ever get their life sorted out the show is over. These massive plot holes result in each singular episode being totally random and nothing ever progresses. The father will always be in jail, the rest of the family will always be losers otherwise there's no show.To sum it all up in one line, if you've seen one episode of Arrested Development you've seen them all. And just a word to the Arrested Development fans, if you have to beg people to buy this dvd to save your favourite show from being axed then you're obviously a minority and the fact that it has now been officially cancelled states this fact clearly. Too bad they didn't hire me to fix the show for them; it could of been done but due to the problems mentioned above I could tell simply by the commercials for this show even before it came on tv that it was going to be a miserable failure in it's current format.Very predictable outcome for this show, it wont be missed...",2,Something's broken here,1128643200,"10 7, 2005",2005,3365,"['show', 'have', 'funny', 'parts', 'fact', 'matter', 'just', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'warrant', 'half', 'hour', 'really', 'hard', 'pin-point', 'what', 'actually', 'wrong', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'enough', 'story', 'fairly', 'witty', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'overall', 'concept', 'just', ""n't"", 'gel.It', 'almost', 'when', 'casting', 'show', 'took', 'cheap', 'safe', 'avenue', 'getting', 'bunch', 'washed-up', 'unknown', 'actors', 'star', 'compensate', 'series', 'have', 'MANY', 'famous', 'actors', 'featuring', 'regular', 'basis', 'very', 'tricky', 'casting', 'technique', 'going', 'hurt', 'long', 'run', 'very', 'sneaky', 'attempt', 'cheaply', 'broaden', 'target', 'audience', 'hiring', 'likes', 'Julia', 'Louis', 'Dreyfus', 'Seinfeld', 'Harry', 'Winkler', 'Happy', 'days', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'SNL', 'name', 'only', 'few', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'feature', 'actor', 'existence', 'starred', 'successful', 'show', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'keep', 'ratings', 'afloat', ""n't"", 'going', 'work', 'watch', 'series', 'not', 'last', 'more', '4', 'seasons', 'will', 'only', 'last', 'long', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'fat', 'wallet', 'Review', 'update', 'now', 'been', 'officially', 'cancelled', 'told', 'so', 'How', 'much', 'do', 'rule', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'people', 'claim', 'show', 'new', 'Seinfeld', 'not', 'only', 'laughable', 'insulting', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'friends', 'Arrested', 'Developments', 'downfall', 'fact', 'show', 'zero', 're-watchability', 'episodes', 'are', 'more', 'chore', 'watch', 'best', 'times', 'happen', 'come', 'repeat', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'forget', 'watching', 'again', 'pulling', 'teeth', 'what', 'shows', 'likes', 'Seinfeld', 'can', 'watch', 'same', 'Seinfeld', 'episode', 'several', 'times', 'still', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'important', 'attribute', 'will', 'ultimately', 'result', 'demise', 'series.If', 'ever', 'see', 'review', 'Ron', 'wish', 'save', 'show', 'certain', 'cancellation', 'then', 'hit', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'provide', 'advice', 'how', 'fix', 'show', 'damage', 'may', 'already', 'be', 'done.The', 'conclusion', 'review', 'Arrested', 'Development', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'show', 'be', 'story', 'week', 'week', 'story', 'dead', 'nowhere', 'go', 'father', 'ever', 'jail', 'shows', 'remaining', 'family', 'members', 'ever', 'get', 'life', 'sorted', 'show', 'over', 'massive', 'plot', 'holes', 'result', 'singular', 'episode', 'being', 'totally', 'random', 'nothing', 'ever', 'father', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'jail', 'rest', 'family', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'losers', 'otherwise', 'show.To', 'up', 'one', 'line', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'episode', 'Arrested', 'Development', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'word', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'fans', 'have', 'beg', 'people', 'buy', 'dvd', 'save', 'favourite', 'show', 'being', 'axed', 'then', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'minority', 'fact', 'now', 'been', 'officially', 'cancelled', 'states', 'fact', 'clearly', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'hire', 'fix', 'show', 'could', 'been', 'done', 'due', 'problems', 'mentioned', 'could', 'tell', 'simply', 'commercials', 'show', 'even', 'came', 'tv', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'miserable', 'failure', 'current', 'format.Very', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'show', 'wont', 'be', 'missed']",Arrested Development: Season 1

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Always amusing, and often brilliantly funny, inventive, surreal series about a rich family gone terribly wrong, and the onesane one trying to hold things together.Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to doa spin on a traditional sitcom.The acting is terrific, from top to bottom. Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell didthey ever get this on network TV? And thank god they did!""On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they hadto fill 30+ episodes. The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clevertwists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness. And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top,but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character, and self-referential episodeslike `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the historyof television.",5,I'd argue for this as the best - and smartest - US comedy TV series of all time,1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,1204,"['Always', 'amusing', 'often', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'inventive', 'surreal', 'series', 'rich', 'family', 'gone', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'onesane', 'one', 'trying', 'hold', 'things', 'together.Sort', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'gotten', 'George', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'Kaufman', 'Hart', 'Monty', 'Python', 'had', 'teamed', 'up', 'doa', 'spin', 'traditional', 'sitcom.The', 'acting', 'terrific', 'top', 'bottom', 'Even', 'producer', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'narration', 'great.Not', 'joke', 'weirder', 'weirder', 'funnier', 'funnier', 'could', 'think', 'how', 'hell', 'ever', 'get', 'network', 'TV', 'thank', 'god', 'did', 're-viewing', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'little', 'less', 'brilliant', 'little', 'more', 'repetitious', 'maybe', 'was', 'hadto', 'fill', '30+', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'only', '18', 'episodes', 'roof', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'more', 'clevertwists', 'ideas', 'episode', 'more', 'aggressive', 'weirdness', 'third', 'season', 'truly', 'insane', 'occasionally', 'over-the-top', 'usually', 'successfully', 'addition', 'elements', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'Bob', 'Lawbla', 'character', 'self-referential', 'episodeslike', 'Save', 'Bluths', 'slyly', 'commenting', 'series', 'coming', 'cancellation', 'one', 'worst', 'mistakes', 'historyof', 'television']",Arrested Development: Season 1

Smith,"[3, 3]","I'm not really much of a ""laugh out loud"" kind of person, but more of a ""smile-and-slight-chuckle"" kind of guy  (my wife is always surprised when she hears a genuine laugh out of me). Most good clever/witty comedies get this smile or slight chuckle reaction out of me (""Seinfeld"" and ""The Simpsons"" come to mind). ""Arrested Development"" is the only show that I have ever watched that consistently makes me laugh out loud during almost every episode. I have actually cried with laughter on several occasions while watching this show. One such instance was last night while watching the episode ""Bringing Up Buster"" from Disc 1 of this 1st season. I don't know why, but it just kills me when Buster starts cussing and it's just one long ""BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."" ""Well, no one's going to top that."" Man I'm almost crying just writing about it.I realize that humor is quite subjective, but everyone that I introduce to this show has LOVED it. I know some people have been complaining that the 2nd season isn't as good, but I have to disagree. The 2nd season is right on par with the first and I'll be buying that DVD as soon as it comes out too. I loved watching this show from the first airing of the Pilot and have watched it ever since. Now that I have finally purchased the DVD of the first season, I can go back and laugh until it hurts all over again.One little note: In the ""Extended Pilot,"" the cuss words aren't bleeped out like they are during the rest of the series.

843200,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B0002PYS7Y,K.T. May,"[3, 3]","Fans of ""Arrested Development"" were disappointed, but in agreeance with Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of said TV show, when it was announced that it would not be returning.  It's not difficult to understand why.  Normally, when shows are cancelled that quickly, it's because they just aren't very good.  This show was intelligent, the plotlines became increasingly hilarious and complicated and the cast was just enjoyable to watch, but Hurwitz wanted to smartly end the show before the quality declined.  He said he would rather disappoint fans with less episodes than crappy ones--an excellent choice.Ron Howard provides some delightful narration for the show.  Jason Bateman carries the series as Michael Bluth, the son of George Bluth Sr., (Jeffrey Tambor) and Lucille Bluth, (Jessica Walter).  In the first episode, we learn that George, former CEO of the Bluth Company is going to prison for spending the company's money on ""personal expenses"".  Michael, the most stable of the family, is elected as the new head of the company, since his twin sister, Lindsay, (Portia de Rossi), is a spendthrift, his brother, Gob, (Will Arnett), is a failing magician with no sense of responsibility and his younger brother, Buster, (Tony Hale), is a good-for-nothing who is too obsessed with his mother to ever be successful on his own.  Michael also has a son, George Michael, (Michael Cera), who has some problems of his own, since after an accidental kiss with his cousin, Maeby, (Alia Shawkat), he thinks he may be in love with her.  David Cross plays Maeby's father and Lindsay's husband, Tobias, and, although married to Lindsay, his sexuality is constantly disputed in the same way Stewie from Family Guy is accused of being a homosexual.  Soon enough, George Sr. escapes from prison and the family struggles to keep his hideout in the attic, and various other places, a secret.  But more trouble shows up in the form of George Sr.'s identical twin brother, Oscar, (also played by Jeffrey Tambor).The hijinks and disasters tie in to each other so well in this show.  Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does and doubles it.  Henry Winkler guest stars in quite a few episodes as Barry Zuckercorn, the eccentric family attorney.  As the seasons progress, the guest stars increase, including an appearance by Scott Baio, the replacement family lawyer aptly named Bob Loblaw, (say it quickly).  Charlize Theron guest stars as an MRF, (you'll have to watch the show to find out), with whom Michael falls in love.  Liza Minnelli guest stars as Lucille's rival and, eventually, Buster's girlfriend.  There are plenty of celebrity appearances on the show to help flesh out the eccentricity of the lives of these characters.From Tobias joining the Blue Man Group and helping out the FBI by accident to the TBA foundation, to Maeby possibly not even being related to George Michael, things just get more and more complicated.  Enter also, Steve Holt, (Justin Grant Wade), who shares his own secret with Gob...and can't help but announce himself by first and last name whenever he enters a room.  Or ""Annyong"", the Korean son Lucille adopts in an effort to make Buster jealous of her ""new son"", only, she doesn't know that ""annyong"" means ""hello"" in Korean.  Or Ann, (Alessandra Toreson), George Michael's girlfriend who is often forgotten or ignored by Michael.As the show progresses, it keeps its hilarity and gains complication which makes for some excellent television.  Even though it's hard to trust a show if you've never heard of it and it has only three seasons worth of episodes, this is one show that you won't be disappointed in if you give it a few moments of your time.  Certain continuity jokes such as ""I've made a huge mistake"" just get funnier when applied to different contexts.  And this family is so quirky it's hard to relate them to your own family, so you can just enjoy watching this family act out some of the wildest events yet.  And hey, with Richie Cunningham narrating, you can't go wrong!",5,Good TV has to come to an end...,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,4015,"['Fans', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'were', 'disappointed', 'agreeance', 'Mitch', 'Hurwitz', 'creator', 'said', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'not', 'difficult', 'understand', 'why', 'Normally', 'when', 'shows', 'are', 'cancelled', 'quickly', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'intelligent', 'plotlines', 'became', 'increasingly', 'hilarious', 'complicated', 'cast', 'was', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Hurwitz', 'wanted', 'smartly', 'end', 'show', 'quality', 'declined', 'said', 'would', 'rather', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'less', 'episodes', 'crappy', 'ones', 'excellent', 'choice.Ron', 'Howard', 'delightful', 'narration', 'show', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'series', 'Michael', 'Bluth', 'son', 'George', 'Bluth', 'Sr.', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Lucille', 'Bluth', 'Jessica', 'Walter', 'first', 'episode', 'learn', 'George', 'former', 'CEO', 'Bluth', 'Company', 'going', 'prison', 'spending', 'company', 'money', 'personal', 'expenses', 'Michael', 'most', 'stable', 'family', 'elected', 'new', 'head', 'company', 'twin', 'sister', 'Lindsay', 'Portia', 'de', 'Rossi', 'spendthrift', 'brother', 'Gob', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'failing', 'magician', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buster', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'good-for-nothing', 'who', 'too', 'obsessed', 'mother', 'ever', 'be', 'successful', 'own', 'Michael', 'also', 'son', 'George', 'Michael', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'who', 'problems', 'own', 'accidental', 'kiss', 'cousin', 'Maeby', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'may', 'be', 'love', 'David', 'Cross', 'Maeby', 'father', 'Lindsay', 'husband', 'Tobias', 'married', 'Lindsay', 'sexuality', 'constantly', 'disputed', 'same', 'way', 'Stewie', 'Family', 'Guy', 'accused', 'being', 'homosexual', 'Soon', 'enough', 'George', 'Sr.', 'prison', 'family', 'keep', 'hideout', 'attic', 'various', 'other', 'places', 'secret', 'more', 'trouble', 'up', 'form', 'George', 'Sr.', 'identical', 'twin', 'brother', 'Oscar', 'also', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', '.The', 'hijinks', 'disasters', 'tie', 'other', 'so', 'well', 'show', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'worse', 'doubles', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'guest', 'stars', 'quite', 'few', 'episodes', 'Barry', 'Zuckercorn', 'eccentric', 'family', 'attorney', 'seasons', 'progress', 'guest', 'stars', 'increase', 'including', 'appearance', 'Scott', 'Baio', 'replacement', 'family', 'lawyer', 'aptly', 'named', 'Bob', 'Loblaw', 'say', 'quickly', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'guest', 'stars', 'MRF', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'show', 'find', 'out', 'whom', 'Michael', 'love', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'guest', 'stars', 'Lucille', 'rival', 'eventually', 'Buster', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'plenty', 'celebrity', 'appearances', 'show', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'eccentricity', 'lives', 'characters.From', 'Tobias', 'joining', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'helping', 'out', 'FBI', 'accident', 'TBA', 'foundation', 'Maeby', 'possibly', 'not', 'even', 'being', 'related', 'George', 'Michael', 'things', 'just', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'complicated', 'Enter', 'also', 'Steve', 'Holt', 'Justin', 'Grant', 'Wade', 'who', 'shares', 'own', 'secret', 'Gob', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'announce', 'first', 'last', 'name', 'whenever', 'room', 'Annyong', 'Korean', 'son', 'Lucille', 'effort', 'make', 'Buster', 'jealous', 'new', 'son', 'only', ""n't"", 'know', 'annyong', 'hello', 'Korean', 'Ann', 'Alessandra', 'Toreson', 'George', 'Michael', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'often', 'forgotten', 'ignored', 'Michael.As', 'show', 'hilarity', 'gains', 'complication', 'excellent', 'television', 'Even', 'hard', 'trust', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'one', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'give', 'few', 'moments', 'time', 'Certain', 'continuity', 'jokes', 'such', ""'ve"", 'made', 'huge', 'mistake', 'just', 'get', 'funnier', 'when', 'applied', 'different', 'contexts', 'family', 'so', 'quirky', 'hard', 'relate', 'own', 'family', 'can', 'just', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'family', 'act', 'wildest', 'events', 'yet', 'hey', 'Richie', 'Cunningham', 'narrating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",Arrested Development: Season 1

843214,A2QKJCQMACNIAC,B0002PYS7Y,Maggie,"[4, 4]","Let me put it this way - I happened to catch the last 4 episodes of Arrested Development when FX ran a marathon this past Saturday...By Tuesday morning (the day the DVD came out), I was at Blockbuster absolutely desperate to see how it all began.  I was not disappointed in the least.This show is unbelievably hilarious and scathing at the same time.  In one episode, the matriarch of this once wealthy family goes to an after-party for a Spanish awards show and proceeds to ask every man there to fetch her a drink (you know, since every Latin man in a tux is a waiter and all).  The humour in this show works because while it is clearly mocking the idle rich, the writing is intelligent and the delivery is dry and razor-sharp.  I gave the DVD 5 stars because it also comes with more special features than most TV shows.  Each of the 3 discs comes with a commentary, extended or deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage of the show.This is one of the most complete shows I've watched recently - well written, well cast, and well acted.  The characters and storylines are developed throughout the arc of the season, but you won't be lost if you happen to start by watching the latter episodes as I did.

Will Arnett is brilliant as Gob, the brother who'd like to have it all, but doesn't want to work for it...and possibly the worst magician in creation. David Cross as Tobias and Portia de Rossi as Lindsay, the most confusing couple on television, and the support of all of the characters, especially Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr. makes this an ensemble not seen in a long time...everyone is well defined and different in their foibles.

That may seem like a simple premise, but behind that are hours worth of enjoyment.As opposed to your traditional dysfunctional family, this one still struggles to remain a family; however, it also seems comfortably aloof.

Full House ran for years and years, yet few would consider it a classic in anything other than a camp fashion.  The lesson is that duration is not a standard for determining what makes classic TV.  Arrested Development ran for only three seasons (two of which were shortened), yet it is not only a classic, it is one of the best TV comedies ever.Told in a mock documentary style, Arrested Development is the chronicle of one of the more dysfunctional families on TV.  Season One begins with patriarch George Bluth under arrest for a series of crimes related to his home construction business.  While he languishes in prison, it falls on his son Michael to hold things together, an effort that keeps being undermined by his family:  his older brother Gob (pronounced Job with a long o), a not-very-gifted magician; his twin sister Lindsey who adopts various causes when she's not out clothes-shopping; his mother Lucille who has virtually no maternal instinct; his younger brother Buster, a man-child with a strange mother-fixation; his brother-in-law Tobias (Lindsey's husband), an ex-doctor turned wannabe actor, and his niece Maeby, a schemer who relishes her own parents' neglect.  Only Michael and his son George-Michael are relatively normal, but even they have their quirks, particularly George Michael's crush on his cousin Maeby.Adding to all the fun is Ron Howard's brilliant narration; sometimes even he gets emotionally involved, such as when one character insults another by calling him Opie.  And there are all some great guest stars, including Henry Winkler as the Bluths' inept attorney; Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a prosecutor who may or may not be blind; Heather Graham as George Michael's ethics teacher who he (and every other male student) has a crush on; and Liza Minelli as Lucille 2, Lucille's rival and Buster's bizarre love interest.There are 22 episodes in this set, and all are brilliantly funny: if I've omitted much in the way of plot description, it's mainly because the episodes have to experienced, not merely described, to be fully enjoyed.  Beyond the episodes, we get a few extras, including the original, uncut pilot episode, a handful of episode commentaries, some behind-the-scenes looks and some deleted scenes.  In its time, it was unappreciated by most people and treated rather shabbily by Fox (who tossed it everywhere in the schedule), but now on DVD, you have the opportunity to see TV comedy at its best.",5,One of the best comedies ever,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,2518,"['Honeymooners', 'ran', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'considered', 'classic', 'Full', 'House', 'ran', 'years', 'years', 'yet', 'few', 'would', 'consider', 'classic', 'anything', 'other', 'camp', 'fashion', 'lesson', 'duration', 'not', 'standard', 'determining', 'what', 'classic', 'TV', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'ran', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'two', 'were', 'shortened', 'not', 'only', 'classic', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'comedies', 'ever.Told', 'mock', 'documentary', 'style', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'chronicle', 'one', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'TV', 'Season', 'One', 'patriarch', 'George', 'Bluth', 'arrest', 'series', 'crimes', 'related', 'home', 'construction', 'business', 'prison', 'son', 'Michael', 'hold', 'things', 'together', 'effort', 'being', 'undermined', 'family', 'older', 'brother', 'Gob', 'pronounced', 'Job', 'long', 'o', 'not-very-gifted', 'magician', 'twin', 'sister', 'Lindsey', 'who', 'adopts', 'various', 'causes', 'when', 'not', 'clothes-shopping', 'mother', 'Lucille', 'who', 'virtually', 'maternal', 'instinct', 'younger', 'brother', 'Buster', 'man-child', 'strange', 'mother-fixation', 'brother-in-law', 'Tobias', 'Lindsey', 'husband', 'ex-doctor', 'turned', 'wannabe', 'actor', 'niece', 'Maeby', 'schemer', 'who', 'own', 'parents', 'neglect', 'Only', 'Michael', 'son', 'George-Michael', 'are', 'relatively', 'normal', 'even', 'have', 'quirks', 'particularly', 'George', 'Michael', 'crush', 'cousin', 'Maeby.Adding', 'fun', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'brilliant', 'narration', 'sometimes', 'even', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'such', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'insults', 'calling', 'Opie', 'are', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'Bluths', 'inept', 'attorney', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'blind', 'Heather', 'Graham', 'George', 'Michael', 'ethics', 'teacher', 'who', 'other', 'male', 'student', 'crush', 'Liza', 'Minelli', 'Lucille', '2', 'Lucille', 'rival', 'Buster', 'bizarre', 'love', 'are', '22', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'omitted', 'much', 'way', 'plot', 'description', 'mainly', 'episodes', 'have', 'experienced', 'not', 'merely', 'described', 'be', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'get', 'few', 'extras', 'including', 'original', 'uncut', 'pilot', 'episode', 'handful', 'episode', 'commentaries', 'behind-the-scenes', 'looks', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'time', 'was', 'unappreciated', 'most', 'people', 'treated', 'rather', 'shabbily', 'Fox', 'who', 'tossed', 'everywhere', 'schedule', 'now', 'DVD', 'have', 'opportunity', 'see', 'TV', 'comedy', 'best']",Arrested Development: Season 1

There have been plenty of series' that were canned way too early and never given the time to grow, but thankfully Fox had the good sense to give Arrested Development a fighting chance, before ultimately pulling the plug after three seasons.  Created by Mitchell Hurwitz and executive produced by Ron Howard (who also narrates) and Brian Grazer, Arrested Development tells the sordid and hilarious tale of the Bluth family, who gets rocked with controversey when their wealthy empire falls on hard times when patriarch George (Jeffrey Tambor) finds himself and jail, and son Michael (Jason Bateman) must do everything he can to keep the family together; ranging from his alcoholic, pill-popping mother (Jessica Walter), wanna-be magician brother Gob (Will Arnett), useless brother Buster (Tony Hale), his twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi), her clueless husband (the hilarious and deadpan David Cross), their daughter Maeby (Alia Shawkat), and his own son George Michael (Michael Cera) who secretly houses a massive crush on his cousin.  Yeah, and you thought your family was weird.  A comedy that isn't for everybody, Arrested Development got by thanks to it's sharp, witty writing and amazing ensemble cast, and Howard's deft narration didn't hurt either.  Loved by critics and revered by it's loyal fans, Arrested Development struggled in the ratings department, which is a shame because it is all so rare that sitcoms are this inventive and funny.  This first season is proof of this, and it's a shame that this brilliant comedy met it's demise far too soon.

843250,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0002PYS7Y,P Magnum,"[6, 6]","Season One of Fox's Arrested Development is a brilliant piece of television.  The show focuses on the Bluth family who's wealthy carefree lifestyle is shattered when patriarch George Bluth (the always great Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested for defrauding his housing development company's investors.  Jason Bateman stars as Michael Bluth, the only normal and sensible family member, who must lead the company back from ruin and keep his family in check.  His mother Lucille (Jessica Walter) is an alcohol swilling schemer who won't let go of her luxurious lifestyle, his twin sister Lindsay (Portia Di Rossi) is into bizarre social causes, her husband Tobias (a hysterical David Cross) who is a former psychiatrist turned actor, his older brother GOB (Will Arnett) an illusionist, his younger brother Buster (Tony Hale) who suffers from panic attacks and still lives like a child with his mother, his son George Michael (Michael Cera) has a bizarre crush on his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat).  Michael must juggle his family's eccentric behavior, try to get information from his father in jail and raise his son.  Series executive producer Ron Howard narrates the show and his even-handed tone adds the right amount of gravity to the goofiness.  While all the supporting players are great, Mr. Bateman is the true star of the series.  His reactions to the off-the-wall behavior of his family are deadpan perfect and he shows great range.

This is what brought me to stream it. My wife and I both got caught up in the show, after the first few episodes (any show takes a couple episodes, at least, to start moving). It's in the one-camera style and is really one of the main reasons this style caught on in fiction television. The whole cast is perfect - which is not always the case, even on the better shows - and the writing skates the depths of dark, twisted black comedy, playing at the ledge without quite jumping off. Sure it's risque and somewhat offensive, but it's never really vulgar. This kind of writing can be the most topical - as is so here - and the most brilliant - again, working here, as well. That's Ron Howard narrating, who also wears the hat of one executive producer (likely the one thing he's been involved in, besides &#34;The Andy Griffith Show&#34;, that I really liked him and the program/film). A friend of mine said the same thing I did, that it reminds him of the 70s sitcom &#34;Soap&#34;. However, this one's a little more cutting edge (then again, so was its predecessor, somewhat, back in the day). Makes my list of not only the top 5 of last decade, but one of the best shows ever - and I don't say that lightly, with other favorites including &#34;All in the Family&#34;, &#34;The Honeymooners&#34;, &#34;Star Trek&#34;, and &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34;.",4,"The Modern ""Soap"" is Much Smarter",1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1505,"['34', 'Arrested', 'Development', '34', 'considered', 'several', 'polls', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'programs', 'last', 'decade', 'not', '1', 'fact', 'many', 'reviews', 'what', 'brought', 'stream', 'My', 'wife', 'got', 'caught', 'up', 'show', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'couple', 'least', 'start', 'moving', 'one-camera', 'style', 'really', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'style', 'caught', 'fiction', 'television', 'whole', 'cast', 'perfect', 'not', 'always', 'case', 'even', 'better', 'shows', 'writing', 'depths', 'dark', 'twisted', 'black', 'comedy', 'playing', 'ledge', 'quite', 'jumping', 'off', 'Sure', 'risque', 'somewhat', 'offensive', 'never', 'really', 'vulgar', 'kind', 'writing', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'topical', 'so', 'here', 'most', 'brilliant', 'again', 'working', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'narrating', 'who', 'also', 'hat', 'one', 'executive', 'producer', 'likely', 'one', 'thing', 'been', 'involved', '34', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', '34', 'really', 'liked', 'program/film', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'did', '70s', 'sitcom', '34', 'Soap', '34', 'However', 'one', 'little', 'more', 'cutting', 'edge', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'was', 'predecessor', 'somewhat', 'back', 'day', 'Makes', 'list', 'not', 'only', 'top', '5', 'last', 'decade', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lightly', 'other', 'favorites', 'including', '34', 'Family', '34', '34', 'Honeymooners', '34', '34', 'Star', 'Trek', '34', '34', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '34']",Arrested Development: Season 1

843262,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0002PYS7Y,RMurray847,"[4, 4]","ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the great shows on TV right now.  It truly isn't like anything else you might see.  It has a jumpy, spontaneous, handheld look like many dramas you see these days, but it is far from serious.  This is a show that has characters that are very funny on their face, and when you dig deeper into their foibles, they become even funnier.  The characters are then thrown into outlandish situations at an unbelievable rate.  So much happens in one episode, it's almost dizzying.This dizzying pace is kept understandable by the dry, impeccably timed narration of Ron Howard.  Because he helped create the show, he has understood from day one the importance of this narration.  To quickly fill in plot holes and most hilariously, to introduce things like flashbacks, flashforwards, archived photos, etc. etc.  His tone NEVER attempts to be funny.  He's not telling a joke, but he is certainly setting up one joke after another.  Normally, narration is a painful, lazy device that grates.  But this show handles it so deftly that it is integral to its success.  If the show were to eliminate the narration, it would absolutely NOT be the same show.And cudos to all the great cast members:  Jason Bateman (in the performance of his career), playing straight-man Michael, is forced to run the company started by his father and run into the ground by his father in some Enron-like scandals.  They are home developers, and one scandal involves building homes in Iraq for Saddam.  All the other family members mostly want to mooch off the company and basically do everything they can to make Michael's life difficult.  And they also have their own ridiculous dreams and aspirations.  Michael has a twin sister who simply wants to be glamorous and lazy and shop all day...a dream held by her mother (Jessica Walters), except that the mother always snipes at her daughter about her weight...the daughter is played by the skeletally thin Portia delRossi.  Portia is married to Tobias, a former psychiatrist trying to be an actor.  Played by David Cross, he is my favorite character on the show.  Deluded, possibly gay but denying it, and best of all...a truly horrific actor!!!  Will Arnett plays older brother Gob (pronounced like Job, the biblical figure) a magician, with a huge chip on his shoulder.  There's younger brother Buster, who can't get out from under his mother's domineering shadow, and is the biggest mass of neurosis you'll ever see.  Michael's son, George Michael, is a likable but goofy teenager, embarrassingly attracted to his trouble-maker cousin Maebe.Sounds confusing...and if you're new to the show, it probably all would be confusing for awhile.  This is that rare sitcom that needs you to watch week after week.  But thank God for the DVD release of the first season.  You can catch up with all the shenanigans and then start watching season 2.  Trust me, you'll laugh almost until it hurts with nearly every episode.  You've never seen a sitcom like it, because there isn't one quite like it.  The humor is bone, bone dry, with sprinklings of slapstick or the just plain absurd.  Full of marvelous guest roles for the likes of Julia Louis Dreyfuss, an amazingly game and funny Liza Minelli and Henry Winkler.  Even Blue Man Group (season 2, now that I think of it).  What's great about season 1 is that all the performers seem to have instinctively grasped the right tone for the show right off the bat.  With many great sitcoms, when you see their first few episodes, you see how they were still struggling to find their voice (MASH, SIMPSONS, SEINFELD).  The AD folks were off and running from the first moment, again aided by Howard's narration.  I highly, highly recommend it!!!Word of warning for parents:  The DVD set contains a longer version of the pilot episode.

Combining elements of comedy, parody, and satire better than any show in memory, and adding sly plot twists in every episode makes for intelligent humor that is far more sophisticated than other network television fare.The performances and characters are extremely well-developed, yet subtly nuanced. It's impossible to single out a cast member for excellence, as everyone plays their part so beautifully. Jason Bateman as Michael is most central to the plot, and couldn't be more perfect: whatever he does in the future will be unable to live up to this effort. Likewise, Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful as the imprisoned Bluth family patriarch. The show makes excellent satirical points about the irresponsibility of celebrity wealth, and can be viewed on many levels, although I prefer it as straightforward comedy.The DVD set contains numerous bonuses including the extended pilot, commentaries (which are almost as funny as the show), a couple of behind the scenes documentaries, and the original music used in the show. Some viewers may find the show to be a bit racy, though normally in an intelligent, innuendo-laden way.This series is a gem: this season is probably the best of the three, and was more than deserving of its Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series.",5,"For Once, A Winner That Actually Deserved An Emmy",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1319,"['Arrested', 'Development', 'Season', 'One', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'Combining', 'elements', 'comedy', 'parody', 'satire', 'better', 'show', 'memory', 'adding', 'sly', 'plot', 'twists', 'episode', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'far', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'other', 'network', 'television', 'fare.The', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'well-developed', 'yet', 'subtly', 'nuanced', 'impossible', 'single', 'out', 'cast', 'member', 'excellence', 'everyone', 'part', 'beautifully', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Michael', 'most', 'central', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'perfect', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'unable', 'live', 'up', 'effort', 'Likewise', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'wonderful', 'imprisoned', 'Bluth', 'family', 'patriarch', 'show', 'excellent', 'satirical', 'points', 'irresponsibility', 'celebrity', 'wealth', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'many', 'levels', 'prefer', 'straightforward', 'comedy.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'numerous', 'bonuses', 'including', 'extended', 'pilot', 'commentaries', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'funny', 'show', 'couple', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'original', 'music', 'used', 'show', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'show', 'be', 'bit', 'racy', 'normally', 'intelligent', 'innuendo-laden', 'way.This', 'series', 'gem', 'season', 'probably', 'best', 'three', 'was', 'more', 'deserving', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series']",Arrested Development: Season 1

In fact, I'm probably responsible for turning on just about everyone I know to the show's peerless brand of cerebral, timeless hilarity.  For this feat, I am quite proud!Everyone knows, of course, that the essential ingredients for successful TV sitcoms are in the writing, the cast, and the timing of the show's release.  Arrested Development no doubt met both the former criteria; the writing is so clever, so offbeat, and so layered with wonderfully bizarre motifs (chicken dance, Tobias' ambiguous sexuality, George Michael and Maeby's on-again-off-again flirtation) that it begs repeated viewings.  And the cast is absolutely stellar.  Each individual performer is spectacular, but it's the way they riff off of one another that truly creates the show's magic.  The only problem with the show, I suppose, was in its timing.  It was cancelled after only three seasons, which signifies that its handlers didn't know how to market it, or perhaps that most viewers are not interested in TV that requires steadfast attention.So we are left with 50 or so episodes that are, more or less, representing some of the funniest and best TV moments in the last twenty or thirty years.All three seasons STRONGLY recommended!",5,Watch over and over and over...,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,1297,"['could', 'buy', 'stock', 'tragically', 'cancelled', 'show', 'would', 'heartbeat', 'fact', ""'m"", 'probably', 'responsible', 'turning', 'just', 'everyone', 'know', 'show', 'peerless', 'brand', 'cerebral', 'timeless', 'hilarity', 'feat', 'am', 'quite', 'proud', 'Everyone', 'course', 'essential', 'ingredients', 'successful', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'are', 'writing', 'cast', 'timing', 'show', 'release', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'doubt', 'met', 'former', 'criteria', 'writing', 'so', 'clever', 'so', 'offbeat', 'so', 'layered', 'wonderfully', 'bizarre', 'motifs', 'chicken', 'dance', 'Tobias', 'ambiguous', 'sexuality', 'George', 'Michael', 'Maeby', 'on-again-off-again', 'flirtation', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'individual', 'performer', 'spectacular', 'way', 'riff', 'one', 'truly', 'show', 'magic', 'only', 'problem', 'show', 'suppose', 'was', 'timing', 'was', 'cancelled', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', 'handlers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'market', 'perhaps', 'most', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'TV', 'steadfast', 'are', 'left', '50', 'so', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'representing', 'funniest', 'best', 'TV', 'moments', 'last', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years.All', 'three', 'seasons', 'STRONGLY', 'recommended']",Arrested Development: Season 1
843266,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0002PYS7Y,Robert Moore,"[9, 11]","By an standard ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT has to go down as one of the finest comedy series in American television history.  Probably no other comedy series has had such a superb large ensemble cast with every member performing to absolute perfection.  Despite the large cast, there isn't a weak or nonessential link in the group.  The writing simply is about as good as writing can get and the visual brilliance generated by the editors and writers has no parallel in American comedy.  And it is funny!  Intensely funny!  Furthermore, the show has garnered a shelf full of Emmys and probably would have won its second straight Emmy for Best Comedy if viewers hadn't felt nostalgic for the rather bland EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND's final season.So why isn't this one of the biggest hits on TV?  Why hasn't it been celebrated for the masterpiece it is?  And why has FOX ordered only a tiny handful of episodes for its third season, almost certainly indicating its cancellation after this season?  Certainly FOX's failure to support it fully is partly to blame.  FOX is easily the network I hate and detest the most.  I have so much ill will towards the network right now that I don't know if I will ever think of it without rancor.  It is one of the best if not the best network at developing interesting and innovative and original shows of the highest quality.  Yet is frequently fails to support its shows.  DARK ANGEL, FIREFLY, THE FAMILY GUY (though it was reprieved a couple of years after cancellation), and WONDERFALLS are merely four superb shows of the past five years that FOX showed only to cancel prematurely.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT now seems certain to be the next distinguished show to get axed.  How does it say about a network that would cancel a series that is not only its finest comedy but also quite probably the finest half hour comedy on TV?  Like I said, FOX is easily the network I hate the most and I rarely allow myself to watch series on the network now because I'm afraid that if I get involved FOX will pull the plug.But there is a second question:  Why aren't the ratings any better for the show?  There is widespread speculation that the show might be too intelligent for casual, less involved viewers.  Over the past thirty-five years the public has embraced a few very intelligent comedies, including ALL IN THE FAMILY, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, CHEERS, and SEINFELD.  But it has also failed to embrace some marvelous comedies like this one and ANDY RICHTER CONTROLS THE UNIVERSE, while at the same time going wild over more or less bland shows like FRIENDS and EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.  I have no firm opinion here, but I do worry that we might be a nation that refuses to embrace the truly smart shows.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, probably the finest hour long show of the past decade, at its peak pulled in only a very small audience.  Maybe Americans as a whole do not like very smart shows.  On the other hand, LOST, a very smart show indeed, has a massive audience.  Perhaps the answer is a combination of factors.  The one thing that is certain is that if ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is indeed allowed to die, as seems likely, it will be a massive lost.  As the nation as a whole gradually discovers the show through the wonderful DVD sets, more and more people will perhaps ask, ""How was such an incredible show allowed to die?""A few years ago NBC coined the expression ""Must See TV,"" a phrase that became a bit of a joke as many wags said that most of the shows it refered to was ""Must Flee TV.""  But if there is a Must See comedy on TV today, this is it.  By any standard this is marvelous television.  A growing number of individuals have come to believe that TV has finally begun to exploit its innate potential and begun in a great number of instances to surpass movies as the great medium for visual narrative.

It's very rare that writers put their fingers so accurately on anything such as dysfunction and actually make it work, but they do so here to an amazing triumph. Each of the characters is well-drawn, well-scripted, and well-acted, and the genius is in the way that they're able to semi-function as a family even though each character is completely focused on self (with the possible exceptions of George Michael and George). The strength of this show to me is in the way that each actor nails his or her part, maintaining a semblance of family unity while staying focused on self-fulfillment--they basically use each other to try to meet their own needs. I've read some of the one-star reviews, and I get the feeling that the main problem for the reviewers was not being able to get past the complete selfishness of the characters in order to see the satire that the show is giving us. . . it's a shame that satire is such a lost art in the states these days.All in all, this show does take a significant suspension of disbelief (who wants to believe that these people can be so incredibly selfish?) and a willingness to get to know characters who aren't all that likeable, but the result most definitely is worth it--some of the funniest lines I've ever heard have come in this show. It also takes paying close attention for the subtle expressions and often delayed reactions that come in response to something that happened several seconds--or even minutes--earlier. Many of the jokes will fall flat if you didn't catch a previous joke, and this is one of the few shows in which they have the guts to try for laughs through silence--and they succeed much more often than not. If I were a drama teacher, this would be a brilliant tool for teaching young actors and actresses the power of the subtle change in expression that the actors use so well.

Character and pathos provide the viewer with fresh insights and surprises, long after you already know all the jokes. Every Bluthe, however vain, self-absorbed or deluded, is allowed to a moment of thoughtfulness and nobility without violating the intergrity of the character.

843295,A3HBS622QD27CV,B0002PYS7Y,"T.A. ""washingmachinemouth""","[5, 5]","NUMBER 1:  There are currently 270 reviews on Amazon concerning this show/DVD collection.  Only 5 of them gave it less than 4 stars...5!!!!!  That's it!  The other 265 gave it 4 or 5 stars.  So let me tell you what I think.This family is completely screwed up.  One of the funniest thing about the show is it's daytime ""Soap Opera"" format:  it quickly switches situational scenes almost violently between way too many characters, but their stories all seemingly fit together in a most unusual, coincidental way.  It satirizes the whole daytime drama genre.  The addition of the flashback scenes breaks up the monotonous, linear order of events, though, that tend to put most accidental daytime soap viewers to sleep, or vomit.  If you live in a big city, especially NY, Miami or LA, you've met, know, or are related to people like this....just not all of them at once!  The characters are very believeable, which only adds to the comedy, in a similar way the Seinfeld characters grew on us.  Coniving, selfish, lazy people--normally you'd hate at first meet--but for some reason, you can't get enough, watching them get themselves in to rediculous situations...usually because of their coniving, selfish, lazy ways!I love night time sitcoms.  This is my favorite of all time.  It's better than Seinfeld, better than Family Guy, and if it stays on the air as long, it'll be better than the Simpsons as well.  I am so ticked off at the few negative reviews I read here on Amazon.  The 5 out of 270 that don't like the show say it's horrible.  It has no ""rewatchability"" as one reviewer put it.  ""Who are these people?"" writes another.  ""They are shallow and one-dimensional,"" insists another.  ""The plot line goes nowhere, and the characters are losers, played by washed-up actors, or actors no one has heard of.""  All of these quotes are made by ignorant idiots.  I don't know if it's even a word, but the show does have ""rewatchability.""  In fact, the plot line moves so fast sometimes (the ONLY thing I can imagine would bother someone...someone who is trying to talk on the phone, or cook dinner while they are watching) that second and third viewings reveal other, funnier situations and one-liners.  And actors?  Just look at the cast--they are all well known actors that we've all seen before, except for George-Micheal and Mae's characters, and hey--they're kids.  Another quote: ""if the father ever gets out of jail, the show is over.""  Guess what--he doesn't spend the second season in jail, and the second season is even better than the first!I can only tell you this:  each character is well crafted, the plot is thicker and juicier than a NY Strip, and each is funnier than hell.  Almost like a David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino film, the story isn't chronological...THIS IS THE REASON I THINK THAT STUPID PEOPLE CAN'T ENJOY IT.  There are constant flashbacks and cut scenes where the narrator explains the background behind a story, situation or one-liner that just took place...like when we are told the whole story behind how Buster lost his hand.  We don't learn this until we see Buster strolling around the house breaking things with his ""hook.""  Another funny sub plot:  what each family member uses Buster's fake hand for (usually when Buster is sleeping)--the uncle uses it as a roach clip, and the mother and father use it in the sack...completely crazy!  It's so funny...laughing at a spoiled, rich, dysfunctional family!Having the DVD is the best way to view...when you miss something funny (which does happen...you'll be laughing so hard, you'll miss entire scenes), you can pause and rewind...it's the best way to do it.  get these DVD's...this show won't be on forever.Don't even look at the price...just buy it.

But what idiot would say those are truly great?Anyway: This is the first season of what will hopefully be a ""Full House""-like phenomenon among the American viewing public. But they're too fickle to appreciate this brilliant work of modern art. There should be ten stars available, because this is a ten-star review show.You know the story: Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is the one sensible son from a family of lunatics and greedy Guses. This includes his father George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), magician older brother Gob (Will ""Funniest Bastard Alive"" Arnett), his twin sis (Portia De Rossi), and his smothered younger brother Buster (Tony Hale). Throw into the mix his brother-in-law Tobias (the always excellent David Cross) and his son (Michael Cera) who has a crush on his own cousin Maeybe (Alia Shawkat), and you've got ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" on speed.The first season captures George Senior's imprisonment on unclear charges (you have to watch the season to know...no peeking) and Michael's attempts to save the family business...mostly from his family. There's way too much going on in each episode to even attempt a summary here.The casting is stellar: Jason Bateman has risen from career death to emerge as a star again, while relative unknowns like Arnett and Hale will not be forgotten anytime soon. De Rossi and Cross are wonderfully off-kilter as the troubled couple, and the matriarch (whose name I forget right now) is brilliantly cold and yet concerned at the same time.If you love smart, innovative comedies that take risks, this is the show for you. I knew I was a fan when I first saw the episode in which Gob tries in vain to make a dramatic gesture of throwing a letter into the ocean. And I've enjoyed the ride since.A lot of critically acclaimed sitcoms are usually crap, but this is the exception. ""Arrested Development"" may just be the best sitcom of the last ten years, so this first season will be required viewing at any ""television-writing"" course of the future if there's any justice in this world.

843305,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0002PYS7Y,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[5, 6]","I was introduced to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT through a good friend. From watching the first episode I was hooked.  Unfortunately, I was one of many people who didn't discover the show until after it had been canceled at Fox.  The show is filmed in veritae style (like a documentary) and though much of the acting seems to be improved, it is not.  The writing on the show is full of wit and humor and is funny on numerous different levels, not to mention that a small side joke might have significance a few episodes or even a season later.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is a character oriented show and every character has a very important role to play in the situations and development of the overarching storyline of the series.The show stars Jason Bateman as widower Michael Bluth, the only semi-normal and average person in one of the most dysfunctional families ever seen on television.  Bateman had some success as a kid and young adult in television (a reoccurring guest role on SILVER SPOONS and on VALERIE/HOGAN'S FAMILY), but the role of Michael Bluth was perfect for Bateman.  It gave him an opportunity to put into practice all of his talent and experience and actually carry a show of misfits as the straight man.  Though Jason Bateman's Michael Bluth is the person who keeps his family together, the rest of the cast offers superb performances too.  There's the lovely Porita de Rossi as Michael's twin sister Lindsay Bluth Funke, Will Arnett Michael's older brother ""Gob"" who works as a magician, Michael Cera as Michael's son George-Michael Bluth, Alia Shawkat as Lindsay's daughter Maeby Funke whom George-Michael has a major crush on, Jeffery Tambor as the father of the Bluth clan who gets sent to prison in the first episode because of a major development deal that might have included minor treason, Jessica Walter as Lucille Bluth the mother of the Bluth children who, David Cross as Lindsay's husband Tobias Funke who is a never nude, Tony Hale as Michael's childlike younger brother Buster, and Ron Howard as the narrator of this ""story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together.""  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT also boasted an impressive list of guest stars including Henry Winkler, Liza Minnelli, Ed Begley Jr, Charlize Theron, Ben Stiller, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Scott Baio, Carl Weathers, Justine Bateman, Andy Richter, Zach Braff, and Jamie Kennedy.The general plot-line of Season One follows the Bluth family as George Bluth is arrested in the pilot episode at his retirement party aboard the company yacht because of some major bad land development deals (get it, arrested development).  His son Michael is prepared to leave with his own son George-Michael to Arizona after his mother Lucille is named President of the Bluth Company instead of himself.  However, for the love of his son and the neediness of his family, Michael stays behind and attempts to get the family business back on track while trying to get dear old dad out of jail.Some of my favorite episodes include:""The Extended Pilot""--flows better than the cut pilot that aired on television and includes several scenes that help extend the characterization.""Bringing Up Buster""--Buster is kicked out of Lucille's penthouse and moves into the model home.  Meanwhile George-Michael takes a role in the school play (being directed by his uncle Tobias) hoping that he will get to kiss Maebe, but after Maebe drops out, George-Michael is supposed to kiss the male lead.""My Mother, The Car""--Michael has partial amnesia after being involved in a car accident that Lucille was responsible for.""In God We Trust""--the family attorney announces that George Sr. can be released on $20,000 bail for the annual `Living Classics Pageant'.  This episode is hilarious, especially towards the end as George Sr. bolts down the street wearing a God costume.""Beef Consomme""--Michael, Gob, and Buster all fight over who gets to go out with Marta.  The fight between the brothers at the end of the episode is particularly funny.""Missing Kitty""--George Sr.'s former secretary goes missing after Gob performs a huge magic trick during a spring break stunt.""Whistler's Mother""--the reveal that George Sr. has a twin brother, Uncle Oscar.  Oscar tries to get some free cash from Michael by selling him a piece of land that is literally full of lemons.""Let Them Eat Cake""--the family learns that the reason George Sr. is in prison is because he was illegally building homes in the old Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Pay attention to the hilarious ""Big Bear"" speech that Gob delivers after believing his father has died in the hospital after a heart attack.Though it is true that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT doesn't appeal to a typical sitcom-sense-of-humor, the show is incredibly intelligent, witty, and funny.  It won't appeal to everyone, but many will at least find it intriguing, and some (like myself) will become fans.The DVD includes several extras including commentaries of the episodes ""Extended Pilot"", ""Beef Consomme"", and ""Let Them Eat Cake""; deleted and extend scenes, original music and songs by David Schwartz composed for the show; three featurettes; a segment of the cast panel discussion at The Museum of Television & Radio; a promo; and an inside look at the series with Ron Howard.",5,I Wish I Would Have Discovered This Show Sooner.,1159833600,"10 3,

843307,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0002PYS7Y,Wheelchair Assassin,"[33, 36]","As reality TV continues rearing its ugly head on every major network, Arrested Development has arrived at just the right time for those of us itching for something intelligent to come over the airwaves.  With corporate malfeasance (rightly or wrongly) assuming so much of the public spotlight over the past several years, Arrested Development casts a light on the people behind such shady goings on, and in this case the picture is not pretty.  It's loosely classifiable as a sitcom, but Arrested Development is shot with more of a documentary/reality show style, giving it a distinctive look and feel that you just won't find in most of network TV's decidedly formulaic fare.  Not since The Simpsons was in its prime about a decade or so has a show so effortlessly balanced wit, randomness, and unapologetic vulgarity (as of this writing, rumors that The Simpsons is still on have yet to be substantiated).At the center of everything is Jason Bateman as genial widower Michael Bluth, the one sane member of a wealthy but deeply dysfunctional family, charged with holding it together after his corrupt father's incarceration.  It's not easy, as Michael is surrounded by a collection of screwballs the likes of which you can scarcely imagine.  Fortunately, the characters on Arrested Development are far more than just zany caricatures; they're all brilliantly drawn and distinctive, aided by some masterful performances from the show's cast.  Yes, they're all isolated from reality and toxically self-absorbed, but the Bluth family still manages to come across as sympathetic.  Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Portia de Rossi, who rarely fails to make my eyeballs bulge) is a pretentious ""liberal activist"" whose advocacy of fashionable causes is in sharp contrast to her vanity and terrible parenting.  Her husband Tobias (David Cross, whose fake mustache is a hysterical running joke in itself) is an utterly oblivious husband and father who's just left his psychiatry practice to pursue his pipe dream of becoming an actor.  Michael's older brother George Oscar (Gob) Bluth II (Will Arnett) is a smarmy, womanizing magician who never fails to take advantage of Michael's decency.  The youngest brother, perpetual student Buster (Tony Hale), is prone to outlandish panic attacks and hasn't managed to separate himself from his mother quite yet.Speaking of the family matriarch, Jessica Walter turns in arguably the best performance of them all as Lucille Bluth, easily one of the most delightfully evil characters in TV history.  Domineering, manipulative, and occasionally downright cruel, Lucille is the most narcissistic member of a family full of narcissists.  She plays her children against each other, shows questionable loyalty to her husband, grubs money relentlessly, and constantly makes cutting remarks about Lindsay's weight in spite of her awe-inspiring gorgeousness. For his part, George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), in addition to his amoral business practices, isn't exactly the best father in the world.  In one especially hilarious series of flashbacks, we see his way of imparting everyday lessons to his children, which always involved some horrible simulated tragedy befalling a one-armed friend of his.  And while the relationship between Michael and his awkward son George-Michael does provide a bastion of tenderness amidst all the screwiness, it's also worth noting that George-Michael has a forbidden crush on his rebellious cousin Maeby.But wait, there's more!  We're also treated to some hilarious and out-of-left-field special guest appearances, including Henry Winkler as the family's incompetent attorney Barry Zuckerkorn; Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as the ""blind"" prosecutor on the Bluths' case; Liza Minelli as Lucille's vertigo-plagued best friend/social rival who briefly becomes Buster's girlfriend in one of TV's all-time great mismatches; and Carl Weathers as, well, Carl Weathers.  I feel I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention ""Annyong,"" Lucille's adopted Korean son who gets his name from the Korean word for ""hello,"" which happens to be all he says for his first five episodes or so.There isn't one episode on this season that's not up to par, not one.  All are brilliant in their own way, juggling plot strands in a Seinfeld-esque manner, but with non-linear plot structures more akin to the shamefully neglected classic Andy Richter Controls the Universe.  With numerous flashbacks and the deadpan narration of Ron Howard filling in any gaps, Arrested Development is able to truly go where network comedy has rarely gone before.  While many episodes do end with important life lessons, generally centering around the importance of family togetherness, the morals don't come until after various plot strands have come together in an all-hell-breaks-loose climax.  Some of the more outlandish climactic set pieces include a phony drug bust involving a bunch of male strippers in phony cop outfits; George Sr. attempting to escape from a Christmas pageant while dressed as a character in a painting; Michael and Gob wrestling ineptly over a woman while Buster desperately tries to get himself punched in the face; and Gob's failed attempts to trick the family's accountant into thinking he's killed a stripper.Accompanying the twenty-two episodes of this first season are a bevy of extras, almost all of which are worth watching.  Most notably, we get an extended version of the pilot (complete with dirty words), commentaries that consist largely of the cast members ripping on each other and making off-color remarks, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and some loving tributes from TV Land.  On the whole, the special features provide a great deal of insight into how the show's unique look and feel were created, how the cast was selected and how they interact, how reams of material are cut down to one 20-minute-or-so episode, and scads of other random information.  Suffice to say that Mitchell Hurwitz, the show's creator, is clearly one very smart man.With the Simpsons still in decline and Family Guy yet to return, I think I can safely go out on a limb and proclaim Arrested Development the best show on network TV right now.  By defying virtually every television convention known to man, Hurwitz & Co. have created something truly innovative and warped, which is no small task with cable channels relentlessly pushing the envelope.  Unfortunately, shows this original and challenging to the viewer don't typically last too long, but here's hoping this one proves to be an exception.  So far the second season has been almost as good as this one, so if there's any justice Arrested Development will succeed in catching on where previous excellent Fox series like Andy Richter Controls the Universe and Undeclared failed.",5,Life among the rich and stupid,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,6758,"['reality', 'TV', 'rearing', 'ugly', 'head', 'major', 'network', 'Arrested', 'Development',

843311,A1MDJN25C9AUFF,B0002PYS7Y,"Zach ""Zach""","[8, 9]","(...)ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT begins at George Bluth Sr.'s retirement party that takes place on a yacht. He is set to announce the heir to his company. His middle son, Michael, whole-heartedly believes he will be picked by his father. He even acts as if he knows he will be picked. When George Bluth Sr. is about to announce his predecessor, he decides to start off with a description of them. The description begins with the norm, and Michael grows more anxious with every word. Suddenly, George Sr.'s words to describe his predecessor become ""the sexiest person I know."" Confused by his father's choice of words to describe him with, Michael witnesses as the job is passed on to George Sr.'s wife, Lucille.Michael is torn inside. Then the police come to arrest his father, for using the company's money as ""his own personal piggy bank.""Part of why ARRESTED is so great is the brilliant characters, all played to perfection by their actors. Leading off the cast is Michael Bluth, played by Jason Batman, he seems to be the only sane one in the family. In fact he IS the only sane one in the family. When the Bluth family assets are frozen, he is the only one that can recognize the seriousness of the problem. Everyone else in the family can't seem to be able to stop spending money, even when it isn't theirs.His father, George Sr., is head of the Bluth Company, and besides doing the crimes that he was charged with during the initial arrest, he might have committed some ""light"" treason. Look for scenes where Michael notices similarities with model houses in Iraq and his, and also look for when George Sr. regards a box marked ""H. Maddas."" It won't seem like anything important at the time, in fact it's made to look so unimportant at the time you may miss it completely, but the truth will unveil itself in the last episode of season 1.Michael's mother, Lucille, is best described as what Michael and his siblings playfully call her: ""a horrible mother"" and ""old thing."" She has a bad habit of pampering her youngest son, Buster, except for when she gets angry with him, and she'll take that anger so far as to adopt a child from Korea just to show Buster up (she even enlists Buster in the army in season 2).Michael's older brother, George Oscar Bluth, who is referred to as ""GOB"" (jobe) is a charming though messed up magician, who started a group called the ""Magician's Alliance"" that punishes magicians for revealing their secret. He is kicked out of the Alliance that he started when it is reported on the news that he tried to hide his father in one of his magic show props in which people are supposed to disappear. The newscaster proceeds to reveal the secret behind the trick.Michael's twin sister, Lindsay, used to be a major demonstrator, but now just buys things with money that's not hers and pretends to care so not to look bad. She's a bit over-confident about her looks.Michael's younger brother, Byron ""Buster"" Bluth is perhaps the most sheltered child in history, and has no idea what the real world is like-and now he's over twenty. He's a momma's boy, to the end. In one scene, when Michael and GOB are talking about how evil their mom Lucille is, Buster adds his opinion in the conversation with ""Yeah, isn't mom great?"" He's a warning sign for all parents not willing to let go of their child.Michael's twin sister Lindsay's husband, Tobias, is also a major demonstrator which is the reason why he and Lindsay met and why she fell in love with him. Now she's not really in love with him. And methinks Tobias is somewhat gay. He always seems to get involved with the gay crowed, like when he writes a book called ""The Man inside Me"" in which, in order to ""avoid confusion"" he makes all the gender pronouns masculine. He and Lindsay have indeed had some marital problems, and have agreed to see other people, while still seeing each other when they crawl in bed (and that even comes to a stop). Tobias is also a ""never-nude."" Which is exactly what it sounds like-he's never nude.Michael's son, George-Michael, isn't exactly sheltered, but something like it. To avoid having the Bluth family add another disgrace to the world, Michael tries his best not to corrupt George-Michael's heart. This goes to such an extent that George-Michael, now in his teens, is pretty much a light-hearted moron with a crush on his cousin (that subsides in season 2 when he starts to date the notoriously dull ""Ann"").Who is George-Michael's cousin? That would be Lindsay and Tobias' rebel daughter Maeby, whose goal in life is to do exactly the opposite of whatever her parents do. She provides a pretty good contrast to the do-gooder George-Michael.The writing in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is some of, if not THE, best writing in a sitcom. The characters are more twisted and vibrant than in pretty much every other show on Earth. The humorous narration by the former ANDY GRIFFITH and HAPPY DAYS star Ron Howard provides passages from scene to scene, often so funny that he steals the spotlight from the actors, especially in the ""On the next ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT"" bits.Overall, I'd have to say ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT may be the greatest sitcom of all time, at least top five. The small amount of viewers in no way relates to the amount of laughs, and if you haven't started watching yet, I urge you to start!
