1094126,A4PSENWF6S5LV,B000UAE7MC,"A. Dunn ""alligirl""","[6, 8]","Do you remember the old nick shows?  'Are You Afraid of the Dark?', 'Keenan and Kel', 'Welcome Freshman', 'Clarissa Explains It All', 'Hey Dude', and 'The Secret World of Alex Mack'!This show had all the appeal of the the teen shows that the older kids had (like 90210 and Melrose Place) and the better parts of the younger shows (freaky science experiments that were almost like magic).  A young girl who could be considered a dork, the younger sister, who basically becomes a superhero in a freak accident.The whole town knows about the accident, but they keep that part about a kid being involved quiet, not wanting the bad press.  And Alex only lets her science whiz big sister Annie and bff Ray in on the secret.  Which makes it appeal to kids even more.  The show displays that the kids are the only ones that can handle this and the less than rational adults are protrayed as 'the bad guys'.  Including their clueless parents in some episodes.I remember loving this show as a child.  And when I heard from a friend that it was available I immediately bought it.  But after watching it, seeing the poor special effects (which weren't the fault of the show, the technology simply wasn't available then to do it as realistic as it could be done now), the 'moral' storylines that some of the episodes adopted, and the altogether over-acting of everyone involved I almost wish I had left this show alone and preserved it in my mind as the amazing show it really isn't.Still with the rest of the series is available I will more than likely buy it.  It's possible that the show improved after the first season.  But even if it doesn't, I'll buy it for prosterity and the off chance that I may one day have children.",3,OLD NICKALODEAN SHOWS,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1715,"['Do', 'remember', 'old', 'nick', 'shows', 'Afraid', 'Dark', ""'Keenan"", 'Kel', 'Freshman', ""'Clarissa"", 'All', 'Dude', 'Secret', 'World', 'Alex', 'Mack', 'show', 'had', 'appeal', 'teen', 'older', 'kids', 'had', '90210', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'better', 'parts', 'younger', 'freaky', 'science', 'experiments', 'were', 'almost', 'magic', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'dork', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'basically', 'superhero', 'freak', 'accident.The', 'whole', 'town', 'accident', 'keep', 'part', 'kid', 'being', 'involved', 'quiet', 'not', 'wanting', 'bad', 'press', 'Alex', 'only', 'science', 'whiz', 'big', 'sister', 'Annie', 'bff', 'Ray', 'secret', 'appeal', 'kids', 'even', 'more', 'show', 'kids', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'can', 'handle', 'less', 'rational', 'adults', 'are', 'protrayed', ""'the"", 'bad', 'guys', 'Including', 'clueless', 'parents', 'episodes.I', 'remember', 'loving', 'show', 'child', 'when', 'heard', 'friend', 'was', 'available', 'immediately', 'bought', 'watching', 'seeing', 'poor', 'special', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'fault', 'show', 'technology', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'available', 'then', 'do', 'as', 'realistic', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'now', ""'moral"", 'storylines', 'episodes', 'adopted', 'altogether', 'over-acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'almost', 'wish', 'had', 'left', 'show', 'alone', 'preserved', 'mind', 'amazing', 'show', 'really', ""isn't.Still"", 'rest', 'series', 'available', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'buy', 'possible', 'show', 'improved', 'first', 'season', 'even', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'buy', 'prosterity', 'off', 'chance', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'have', 'children']",N/A

1094129,A2RUUTTFJQ7CBH,B000UAE7MC,Anton Tobias,"[61, 64]","Word around the campfire is the first season of Alex Mack will be the only season released on DVD because the powers that be are only trying to capatilize on the success of Jessica Alba.Although she only appeared in a few episodes of the first season they are pushing the DVD by using her name and picture on the front cover.I've also heard that although there were originally 13 episodes in the first season this DVD set will only contain 12 episodes making it an incomplete season.  This demonstrates just how hastily this product was thrown together and further proving that very little time was spent on getting a complete and quality-made DVD set together.I hope these rumors prove false and that ""The Secret World Of Alex Mack"" is given the proper treatment it and it's fans deserve.UPDATE 10/04/07:  The rumors regarding the ""missing episode"" have been proven untrue.  All 13 episodes are represented in this DVD set.Genius Entertainment (better known as Genius Products) has done an excellent job of bringing The Secret World Of Alex Mack back to life.  The first season consists of 2 DVDs in a standard plastic case.  All 13 episodes are included but they are not (according to various sources) represented in the sequential order of the original television broadcasts.This is a minor detail considering fans of the show have been foaming at the mouth to get their hands on an official DVD release of the program for years.Will the final three seasons ever see the light of day?  Only time will tell.Episode Listing For This DVD:DISC 11. The Accident2. Shock Value3. Hoop War4. Cold Day In Paradise Valley5. False Alarm6. School Dance7. The Science FairDISC 28. Alex & Mom9.

It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently. So, I bought all the seasons from all the old shows I used to watch on Nick, FOX, and ABC. So far Nick is the only one totally bias of it's past.

I was thrilled to hear when it was announced that the first season was FINALLY coming to DVD after almost 10 years since the finale. And then I got a glimpse of the cover art and boy, am I glad I didn't spend the money to get this show I loved. What a slap in the face to the wonderful and talented Larisa Oleynik's face by having her have to SHARE the billing with Jessica Alba (you can count the number of episodes she was in on ONE HAND!) Clearly the distributors of the DVD only wanted to cash in on Jessica Alba's popularity at the time of its release.
