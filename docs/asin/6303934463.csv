This is Lincoln New Mexico, Pat Garrett is the Sheriff of Lincoln County. Doc Halliday just got off the coach! He is a friend of Pat, who has this new job. Doc wants the strawberry roan that was stolen from him. William Bonney says he bought it. Bonney knows Pat's trick! The Doc knows a trick too. There is a change in plans. Doc wins at cards. He is paid in coins, cold cash. Bonney bunks with his horse. He hears a shot, then gets a big surprise! There is [censored] action in the shadows. [Did kids treat Billy like a hero?] Doc and Billy become friends. Billy deals with a friendly gunman. The Sheriff arrives with three deputies. But Billy stands his ground, Doc interferes to save Billy. [Believeable?]Doc takes Billy to his secluded cabin. Rio is there. ""Keep him warm and dry."" A face like a baby? A wandering chicken? How to keep Billy warm? Rio will save his life. [Censorship disallowed this scene.] Doc has a deadly aim with a rifle. The next morning sees Billy recovering. Is that a lucky ring? Later Doc arrives late at night and learns about Rio and Billy: they hooked up. Whose fault is it? Billy offers Doc his pick: Rio or the horse! ""I still can't believe it."" [Me too.] ""Can you lend me $50?"" ""Here's $40."" Doc and Billy leave for Fort Sumner. Sand in a canteen? ""They're all alike."" Pat captures Doc. Billy returns for Rio. Pat and Doc find Rio tied up. Will Billy return? Pat captures him too. The road to Lincoln isn't clear. Smoke signals on both sides. They must change course.They ride past a burnt-out house. Can they escape the Mescaleros? The dust rises from the cacti dragged behind. The pursuers are foiled. They find a house to stay for the night. Will Doc and Billy come to an agreement? [A cuckoo clock in the desert?] Billy remembers a few things. Does their friendship seem forced? Pat is quite upset over this development! [Jealousy? What were they thinking?] ""I don't know what to say."" ""If I hadn't come between you none of this would have happened."" ""After you."" [Trust no one?] Pat offers a deal to Billy. Start a new life? ""Of all the dirty rotten tricks!"" And so Billy rides away with Rio. The world believes he was killed on July 13, 1881.This is a change from the conventional westerns of the 1930s, and is more concerned with interpersonal and psychological relations. Aside from the names there is little authentic history in this story. Howard Hughes tussled with the censors over this movie. Hollywood makes entertainment. People don't know much about history because they get their knowledge from movies, not history books. This film has an odd set of romantic triangles. The actual history of William Bonney and the Lincoln County Land War is more informative than any one movie. It is not in the schoolbooks, you have to read a history book.

The acting is bad, the music is worse, and the camera angles are downright hilarious. I'm not sure how much of the dialogue was intended to be funny, but I'm sure a lot of the bigger laughs were unintentional. Nevertheless, it's a goofy, friendly little movie that moves along at a brisk pace and is nothing if not entertaining.The plot? Well, you see, Pat Garrett and Doc Holliday used to be best friends, that is until Billy the Kid rode into town, and now Doc spends all his time hanging out with Billy which makes Pat pretty darn jealous. There's also Rio (played by the scantily clad Jane Russell) who used to be Doc's girl before Billy stole her, although neither Doc nor Billy care much about that. They do argue a lot about who owns Doc's horse, but otherwise they're pretty tight, riding around together, humilating Pat, and just generally having a good time. All good things must come to an end, however, and after a couple of shootouts and almost shootouts our hero(?) rides off into the sunset, proud possesor of both the horse and the girl.""The Outlaw"" isn't a classic by anybody's standards (unless you count the classically silly ""Gun Switching"" scene), but it is fun in a weird kind of way. Gazillionare Howard Hughes tried for years to have it released while he battled the censors (unlike some other reviewers, I do think the film is pretty racy for its time) and there's still about five minutes missing. You can sometimes tell where footage was cut, such as a scene where Doc goes to hug Billy (really) and after a jump they're suddenly talking about something else. Uh huh.Anyway, check this out if you're a fan of Jane Russell or over the top cheese. If you do see it, watch for my favorite part: Billy strings up Rio and leaves her for dead, has second thoughts, and comes back to find the sheriff waiting for him. ""Why didn't you tip me off?"" he irritably asks the still strung-up Rio. Great stuff.GRADE: B+",4,"""What, no kiss?""

389986,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303934463,Dr. James Gardner,"[1, 4]","""The Outlaw"" is probably the most over-rated western around. Made in 1943 by Howard Hughes (1905-76), it is primarily a showcase for Jane Russell's ample bosoms, and as such, it does its job well. But as a western, you've got to be kidding. The historically inaccurate story has Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) and Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell) being long time friends, and Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel) as the man out. Of course, Billy and Garrett were the friends who lived and died in New Mexico and, as far as anyone knows, never met Doc Holliday who spent most of his time in Kansas and Arizona. Moreover, there was not such a wide age discrepancy between the three men, whereas Huston was nearly twice Beutel's age at the time of shooting.Putting history aside, Mitchell and Huston were both great actors, but clearly not suited for the Western genre. Mitchell (1892-1962) is best remembered for his supporting roles as Scarlett O'Hara's father in ""GWTW"" (1939) and  Uncle Billy in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). Over a 38 year career he won an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Tony. While he played in westerns (e.g., ""High Noon"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Destry"", ""Buffalo Bill"") Mitchell's short stature and portly appearance were best suited to non-action roles. He hardly fills the bill as the famous Pat Garrett .Much the same can be said for Walter Huston (1883-1950), who won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), and racked up 3 more Oscar nominations including playing Jimmy Cagney's dad in ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (1942). Huston's great voice and animated facial expressions were well suited for his roles that included playing the Devil (""The Devil and Daniel Webster""), but at nearly 60 years of age he makes a poor Doc Holliday. With his oversized store-bought pistols hiked up above his waist, Huston looks more comical than dangerous.Jack Beutel's (1915-89) Billy the Kid is the typical over-confident play acting we see in many westerns. He has a kind of little kid appeal, even though he was in his 20s at the time. Unfortunately for Beutel, conflicts with Howard Hughes, who controlled his contract, kept him off the screen for over a decade. By the time he returned to the screen, his career was nearly over. He made a few forgettable westerns then transitioned to TV.Look for Ben Johnson (1918-96) in his screen debut. Johnson would go on to portray the classic westerner, in films such as ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""Shane"" (1953), ""One Eyed Jacks"" (1961), ""Hang em High"" (1968), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), and ""Bite the Bullet"" (1975).Jane Russell (1921-2011), of course, was a sensation. She received top billing in the film (very usual to have a woman starring in a Western), her screen debut. She went on to make nearly two dozen films, including ""Paleface"" (1948) with Bob Hope, ""Double Dynamite"" (1951) with Sinatra and Groucho, ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953) with Marilyn Monroe, and ""Gentlemen Marry Brunettes"" (1956).The film was actually made in 1941, but Hughes had trouble getting it past the Hays censors. It surfaced for 1 week in 1943 and finally general release in 1946, where it was a big hit. The B&W; print was colorized in 1988 and again in 2009.The poor quality of the film can be accounted for by the many personnel changes. Howard Hawks was fired as Director, and Hughes himself took over, even though he had directed only one (silent) film (Hell's Angels"") more than a decade earlier. But Hughes was busy running an empire, so directing often was taken over by screenwriter Jules Furthman. Some scenes were shot by Lucien Ballard but the official cinematographer is Gregg Toland.The musical score appears to be written by someone who thinks the film is a comedy. In fact, the dialogue and the old grisly film stars are indeed comical, although not on purpose.Bottom line - it's a poor film that has some historical value but only from the point of view of Russell's ample bosoms.",2,Poor job,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,3970,"['Outlaw', 'probably', 'most', 'over-rated', 'western', 'Made', '1943', 'Howard', 'Hughes', '1905-76', 'primarily', 'showcase', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'ample', 'bosoms', 'such', 'job', 'well', 'western', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'story', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'being', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Jack', 'Buetel', 'man', 'course', 'Billy', 'Garrett', 'were', 'friends', 'who', 'lived', 'died', 'New', 'Mexico', 'as', 'far', 'anyone', 'never', 'met', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'who', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'Kansas', 'Arizona', 'Moreover', 'was', 'not', 'such', 'wide', 'age', 'discrepancy', 'three', 'men', 'Huston', 'was', 'nearly', 'twice', 'Beutel', 'age', 'time', 'shooting.Putting', 'history', 'aside', 'Mitchell', 'Huston', 'were', 'great', 'actors', 'clearly', 'not', 'suited', 'Western', 'genre', 'Mitchell', '1892-1962', 'best', 'remembered', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Scarlett', ""O'Hara"", 'father', 'GWTW', '1939', 'Uncle', 'Billy', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '1946', '38', 'year', 'career', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Emmy', 'Tony', 'played', 'westerns', 'e.g.', 'High', 'Noon', 'Stagecoach', 'Destry', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', 'Mitchell', 'short', 'stature', 'portly', 'appearance', 'were', 'best', 'suited', 'non-action', 'roles', 'hardly', 'bill', 'famous', 'Pat', 'Garrett', '.Much', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Walter', 'Huston', '1883-1950', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', '1948', 'racked', 'up', '3', 'more', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Cagney', 'dad', 'Yankee', 'Doddle', 'Dandy', '1942', 'Huston', 'great', 'voice', 'animated', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'well', 'suited', 'roles', 'included', 'playing', 'Devil', 'Devil', 'Daniel', 'Webster', 'nearly', '60', 'years', 'age', 'poor', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'oversized', 'store-bought', 'pistols', 'hiked', 'up', 'waist', 'Huston', 'more', 'comical', 'dangerous.Jack', 'Beutel', '1915-89', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'typical', 'over-confident', 'play', 'acting', 'see', 'many', 'westerns', 'kind', 'little', 'kid', 'appeal', 'even', 'was', '20s', 'time', 'Unfortunately', 'Beutel', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'who', 'controlled', 'contract', 'kept', 'off', 'screen', 'decade', 'time', 'returned', 'screen', 'career', 'was', 'nearly', 'over', 'made', 'few', 'forgettable', 'westerns', 'then', 'transitioned', 'TV.Look', 'Ben', 'Johnson', '1918-96', 'screen', 'debut', 'Johnson', 'would', 'go', 'portray', 'classic', 'westerner', 'films', 'such', 'Wore', 'Yellow', 'Ribbon', '1949', 'Rio', 'Grande', '1950', 'Shane', '1953', 'One', 'Eyed', 'Jacks', '1961', 'Hang', 'em', 'High', '1968', 'Wild', 'Bunch', '1969', 'Bite', 'Bullet', '1975', '.Jane', 'Russell', '1921-2011', 'course', 'was', 'sensation', 'received', 'top', 'billing', 'film', 'very', 'usual', 'have', 'woman', 'starring', 'Western', 'screen', 'debut', 'went', 'make', 'nearly', 'two', 'dozen', 'films', 'including', 'Paleface', '1948', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Double', 'Dynamite', '1951', 'Sinatra', 'Groucho', 'Gentlemen', 'Prefer', 'Blondes', '1953', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'Gentlemen', 'Marry', 'Brunettes', '1956', '.The', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'made', '1941', 'Hughes', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'Hays', 'censors', 'surfaced', '1', 'week', '1943', 'finally', 'general', 'release', '1946', 'where', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'B', 'W', 'print', 'was', 'colorized', '1988', 'again', '2009.The', 'poor', 'quality', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'accounted', 'many', 'personnel', 'changes', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'was', 'fired', 'Director', 'Hughes', 'took', 'over', 'even', 'had', 'directed', 'only', 'one', 'silent', 'film', 'Hell', 'Angels', 'more', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Hughes', 'was', 'busy', 'running', 'empire', 'directing', 'often', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'screenwriter', 'Jules', 'Furthman', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'Lucien', 'Ballard', 'official', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland.The', 'musical', 'score', 'be', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'film', 'comedy', 'fact', 'dialogue', 'old', 'grisly', 'film', 'stars', 'are', 'indeed', 'comical', 'not', 'purpose.Bottom', 'line', 'poor', 'film', 'historical', 'value', 'only', 'point', 'view', 'Russell', 'ample', 'bosoms']",N/A

Forstadt,"[2, 3]","There is some talent behind the making of THE OUTLAW: the acting of Walter Huston (THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE) and Thomas Mitchell (HIGH NOON) and the cinematography of Gregg Toland (CITIZEN KANE). All this talent, however, goes to waste behind the weak plot and dialogue, the limp directing by Howard Hughes, and the talent-less acting of the featured candy, Jane Russell.The fanciful plot has Doc Holliday (Huston) playing pals with William ""Billy the Kid"" Bonney (Jack Buetel) after Billy steals Doc's horse, Red. Billy, for no good reason, manages to keep the horse while gaining Doc's friendship. Soon, however, the both of them are driven out of town by Doc's erstwhile chum, Pat Garrett (Mitchell), who is apparently jealous of Bonney and pouty that Holliday is no longer his buddy. Then the girl ""Rio"" (Russell) comes between Doc and Billy offering something to look at but not much more. Garrett chases the gang around a bit, before the de rigueur Indian attack brings everything to a historically-curious resolution.The Saturday-morning dialogue and plot is embarrassingly silly and the dialogue is annoyingly ""on the nose."" It is known that Howard Hawks originally was slated to direct this film, but bowed out after two weeks of filming in order to direct SERGEANT YORK. Little remains in THE OUTLAW to suggest Hawks left much of a mark on the film in those two weeks.Unfortunately, THE OUTLAW is not racy enough by today's standards to warrant even lascivious interest despite the well-publicized struggle to overcome the censors of its day and its banning in such countries as Finland and Sweden (of all places).

389990,A2DSXA1E02C86D,6303934463,Joseph Haschka,"[10, 15]","Having recently seen the 2004 film THE AVIATOR about millionaire aircraft designer Howard Hughes, I was compelled to see THE OUTLAW, a major motion picture directed by Hughes in 1941. My interest was purely intellectual, mind you. It had nothing to do with the director's fixation on the cleavage and opulent  ... well, you know ... of its 19-year old starlet, Jane Russell, which sparked a spirited battle between Hughes and the censors of the Production Code Administration, delayed the film's release until 1943 (and almost immediate withdrawal), and resulted in subsequent edits and re-releases in 1946 and 1950.Hughes should have stuck with building airplanes.THE OUTLAW may be a classic, but that doesn't prevent it from also being patently ridiculous. It brings together the outlaw/bad boy Billy the Kid (Jack Buetel), lawman Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell), and dentist/gambler/gunfighter Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) in New Mexico in the summer of 1881. Here, the Kid and Holliday get chummy despite quarreling over a horse and Doc's petulant girlfriend, Rio (Russell). In the meantime, Sheriff Pat becomes jealous that his heretofore good friend Holliday is spending so much time with the notorious outlaw Billy, whom Garrett would just as soon arrest or shoot dead for fame's sake. After being chased by the de rigueur band of hostile Native Americans, the four principals - six, if you count Jane's ... well, you know ... gather round for a final confrontation. Here, Garrett's attempt to disarm Billy is so dopey and so awkwardly choreographed with unbelievably bad dialogue that it virtually reduces this sagebrush drama to farce. It doesn't help that Buetel's the Kid occasionally comes across as a young and sweet tempered Jimmy Stewart - someone you'd be thrilled to have your teenage daughter marry.Hollywood never shirks from playing fast and loose with historical fact. So, while viewing THE OUTLAW, one should keep in mind that:1. Pat Garrett did indeed gun down Billy the Kid in July 1881.2. There's no evidence that either Garrett or Billy ever met Doc Holliday.3. Holliday died in his bed of tuberculosis in Glenwood Springs, CO on November 8, 1887.4. Russell starred in the days before surgical augmentation of ... well, you know. Hers are the real deal.After seeing this film, I was amazed that Hughes managed to squeeze perhaps 30 minutes of substance into 1 hour and 58 minutes, and that Jane's ... well, you know ... caused such a scandal in shots that were positively innocuous by today's standards. At one point, after Rio falls into a pond, Hughes declined the opportunity to display Russell in full-frontal, wet T-shirt glory. I was crushed, but believe in my heart that Howard considered the option for a brief moment at least.If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't waste my time with this nonsense. I am, however, awarding two stars - one to each of Jane's ... well, you know.",2,One star for each,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2915,"['Having', 'recently', 'seen', '2004', 'film', 'THE', 'AVIATOR', 'millionaire', 'aircraft', 'designer', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'was', 'compelled', 'see', 'THE', 'OUTLAW', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'directed', 'Hughes', '1941', 'interest', 'was', 'purely', 'intellectual', 'mind', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'director', 'fixation', 'cleavage', 'opulent', 'well', 'know', '19-year', 'old', 'starlet', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'sparked', 'spirited', 'battle', 'Hughes', 'censors', 'Production', 'Code', 'Administration', 'delayed', 'film', 'release', '1943', 'almost', 'immediate', 'withdrawal', 'resulted', 'subsequent', 'edits', 're-releases', '1946', '1950.Hughes', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'building', 'airplanes.THE', 'OUTLAW', 'may', 'be', 'classic', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'also', 'being', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'together', 'outlaw/bad', 'boy', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Jack', 'Buetel', 'lawman', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'dentist/gambler/gunfighter', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'New', 'Mexico', 'summer', '1881', 'Here', 'Kid', 'Holliday', 'get', 'chummy', 'quarreling', 'over', 'horse', 'Doc', 'petulant', 'girlfriend', 'Rio', 'Russell', 'meantime', 'Sheriff', 'Pat', 'jealous', 'heretofore', 'good', 'friend', 'Holliday', 'spending', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'notorious', 'outlaw', 'Billy', 'whom', 'Garrett', 'would', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'arrest', 'shoot', 'dead', 'fame', 'sake', 'being', 'chased', 'de', 'rigueur', 'band', 'hostile', 'Native', 'Americans', 'four', 'principals', 'six', 'count', 'Jane', 'well', 'know', 'gather', 'round', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Here', 'Garrett', 'attempt', 'disarm', 'Billy', 'so', 'dopey', 'so', 'awkwardly', 'choreographed', 'unbelievably', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'virtually', 'sagebrush', 'drama', 'farce', ""n't"", 'help', 'Buetel', 'Kid', 'occasionally', 'across', 'young', 'sweet', 'tempered', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'someone', ""'d"", 'be', 'thrilled', 'have', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'marry.Hollywood', 'never', 'playing', 'fast', 'loose', 'historical', 'fact', 'So', 'viewing', 'THE', 'OUTLAW', 'one', 'should', 'keep', 'mind', 'that:1', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'did', 'indeed', 'gun', 'down', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'July', '1881.2', 'evidence', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'ever', 'met', 'Doc', 'Holliday.3', 'Holliday', 'died', 'bed', 'tuberculosis', 'Glenwood', 'Springs', 'CO', 'November', '8', '1887.4', 'Russell', 'starred', 'days', 'surgical', 'augmentation', 'well', 'know', 'Hers', 'are', 'real', 'deal.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'amazed', 'Hughes', 'managed', 'squeeze', 'perhaps', '30', 'minutes', 'substance', '1', 'hour', '58', 'minutes', 'Jane', 'well', 'know', 'caused', 'such', 'scandal', 'shots', 'were', 'positively', 'innocuous', 'today', 'standards', 'one', 'point', 'Rio', 'pond', 'Hughes', 'declined', 'opportunity', 'display', 'Russell', 'full-frontal', 'wet', 'T-shirt', 'glory', 'was', 'crushed', 'believe', 'heart', 'Howard', 'considered', 'option', 'brief', 'moment', 'least.If', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'nonsense', 'am', 'however', 'awarding', 'two', 'stars', 'one', 'Jane', 'well', 'know']",N/A
389991,AR2DE47VCY1C8,6303934463,"Joseph H Pierre ""Joe Pierre""","[4, 8]","This was the famous Howard Hughes's attempt to break into Hollywood.  He's the guy who built The Hughes Took Company into an empire, flew air racers, built the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot;, Hughes Air West, and a bunch of other accomplishments.  He died a recluse who was obsessed with germs. He was the stuff that fables are made of.  Jane Russell was one of his accomplishments.The movie took seven years, they say, to be released--after it was completed.  Hughes directed it.  The male lead, Jack Beutel, who played Billy the Kid, was under contract to Hughes, where he languished.  Hughes paid him, month after month, but never used him in any other film.  He is somewhat reminiscent, in looks, of Audey Murphy (the most decorated soldier in WWII, who played himself in a film.)  He reminds me of Murphy.The film depicted a highly fictional relationship between Doc Holliday and Billy (The Kid) Bonney, which is the product of the writer's fevered imagination.  Although they were contemporaries, there is no evidence that they ever met.  The Kid was a product of the Lincoln County wars (New Mexico), while Holliday was an acquaintance of Wyatt Earp, who came West from Dodge City, Kansas, to Tombstone, Arizona.  Probably Earp norHolliday ever met Garrett or Billy in their lives.  Holliday is played by Walter Huston in the film.  The part of Pat Garrett (who actually killed the Kid, and wrote Billy's life story from stories he told him around the camp fire and things they experienced together--a copy of which I have, and have reviewed here) was played by Thomas Mitchell, who, although he played the part impeccably, was perhaps the most dubious job of casting in the film.  The contender for that honor would have to be Huston as Holliday.  Both highly unlikely candidates for those parts if you are at all interested in historical accuracy or even slight physical resemblance.In short, this has no resemblance to historical fact, although that is no drawback to the story's entertainment value.  The only cast member to gain from the film would have to be Jane Russell, who played a few more parts before her career petered out.  Nothing of consequence, I think.  Huston and Mitchell were already made, and Beutel withered on the vine.  Hughes' days as a director were definitely numbered.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books",3,"Not bad, but certainly not history, for those in doubt",1084924800,"05 19, 2004",2004,2392,"['was', 'famous', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'attempt', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'guy', 'who', 'built', 'Hughes', 'Took', 'Company', 'empire', 'flew', 'air', 'racers', 'built', 'quot', 'Spruce', 'Goose', 'quot', 'Hughes', 'Air', 'West', 'bunch', 'other', 'accomplishments', 'died', 'recluse', 'who', 'was', 'obsessed', 'germs', 'was', 'stuff', 'fables', 'are', 'made', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'was', 'one', 'accomplishments.The', 'movie', 'took', 'seven', 'years', 'say', 'be', 'released', 'was', 'completed', 'Hughes', 'directed', 'male', 'lead', 'Jack', 'Beutel', 'who', 'played', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'was', 'contract', 'Hughes', 'where', 'languished', 'Hughes', 'paid', 'month', 'month', 'never', 'used', 'other', 'film', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'looks', 'Audey', 'Murphy', 'most', 'decorated', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'who', 'played', 'film', 'Murphy.The', 'film', 'depicted', 'highly', 'fictional', 'relationship', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Bonney', 'product', 'writer', 'fevered', 'imagination', 'were', 'contemporaries', 'evidence', 'ever', 'met', 'Kid', 'was', 'product', 'Lincoln', 'County', 'wars', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Holliday', 'was', 'acquaintance', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'who', 'came', 'West', 'Dodge', 'City', 'Kansas', 'Tombstone', 'Arizona', 'Probably', 'Earp', 'norHolliday', 'ever', 'met', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'lives', 'Holliday', 'played', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'film', 'part', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'who', 'actually', 'killed', 'Kid', 'wrote', 'Billy', 'life', 'story', 'stories', 'told', 'camp', 'fire', 'things', 'experienced', 'together', 'copy', 'have', 'have', 'reviewed', 'here', 'was', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'played', 'part', 'impeccably', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dubious', 'job', 'casting', 'film', 'contender', 'honor', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Huston', 'Holliday', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'candidates', 'parts', 'are', 'interested', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'even', 'slight', 'physical', 'resemblance.In', 'short', 'resemblance', 'historical', 'fact', 'drawback', 'story', 'entertainment', 'value', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'gain', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'who', 'played', 'few', 'more', 'parts', 'career', 'petered', 'out', 'Nothing', 'consequence', 'think', 'Huston', 'Mitchell', 'were', 'already', 'made', 'Beutel', 'withered', 'vine', 'Hughes', 'days', 'director', 'were', 'definitely', 'numbered.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierreauthor', 'Handguns', 'Freedom', 'care', 'maintenanceand', 'other', 'books']",N/A

At times it wanted to be dramatic and at times it wanted to be a comedy.  It really did not get either tone right though.  The writing and acting were not good enough to be a drama, and if it was funny in its day, then the comedy does not hold up well.  The running joke throughout the movie was that the main characters were more concerned with who got the horse than who got Jane Russell.It seems Howard Hughes made it to get a movie not approved by the censors as he did anything else.  Jane Russell's cleavage did a lot to help in that department.  It was considered very racy for the 1940s but is very tame by today's standards.  So it really ends up being more of a cult classic than anything else.Since Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, the version of the DVD I have is the black and white version.

Doc Holliday (Walter Huston) is a friend of Sheriff Pat Garrett (Thomas Mitchell). When Billy the Kid (Jack Beutel) rides into town, Doc spends time schmoozing with the Kid, and Garrett gets upset. Jane Russell's 44s show up with Jane right behind them. Doc and Billy vie for her love, when they are not arguing over a strawberry roan horse. I kept waiting for a logical plot to materialize. I was still waiting when the movie ended. This film tells us of the vision of Howard Hughes. Mainly that Hughes wanted to feature the natural assets of a young Jane Russell. He succeeded, points taken. Speaking of the white hills of Arizona, there is a weak attempt to tell a gunfighter vs. gunfighter story. There is even some Western-type action. At one point, Indians on the warpath suddenly appear and then proceed to get lost in a cloud of dust. Only in Hollywood. Howard Hawks assisted with the director task, but he just told the camera guy to focus on Jane's cleavage and left the set.

After all, controversy sells tickets (remember the hoopla about Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ?).  By all accounts, his 1941-43-46 film (the staggered releases were due to various bans and censorship) The Outlaw succeeded dramatically on all accounts, becoming immortalized by the very forces that acted to suppress it in its day.What's all the controversy about?Sex, naturally.The Outlaw was the debut appearance of the soon-to-be icon Jane Russell and her ample bosom, which caused quite a furor back in the days when married couples slept in separate beds and skirts were ankle-length.  Russell and Hughes leave absolutely nothing to the imagination--in fact; he even designed a special bra to augment and display as much of Russell's chest as possible.  Couple this with an innuendo laden script, and the blatant sexuality expressed by the actors in all facets of their performances, and you'll understand why this was a bit too steamy for the 1940s.Whenever you watch a movie today and experience/enjoy the ubiquitous female bodies/sexuality that pervades them, you owe it to yourself to pay homage to the film that made all of this possible, the one that broke all of society's conventions.This version of The Outlaw has been fully colorized for the first time, adding even more sizzle and life to this smoldering gem, insofar as that is possible!  The color is as good as any first-generation true color film, and I feel it adds to the experience (having seen both versions).Definitely worth a look for anyone interested in the history of film.",5,The One That Started It All,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,1694,"['Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'film', 'general', 'amount', 'time', 'familiar', 'director', 'penchant', 'controversy', 'controversy', 'tickets', 'remember', 'hoopla', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'accounts', '1941-43-46', 'film', 'staggered', 'releases', 'were', 'due', 'various', 'bans', 'censorship', 'Outlaw', 'succeeded', 'dramatically', 'accounts', 'becoming', 'immortalized', 'very', 'acted', 'suppress', 'day.What', 'controversy', 'Sex', 'naturally.The', 'Outlaw', 'was', 'debut', 'appearance', 'soon-to-be', 'icon', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'ample', 'bosom', 'caused', 'quite', 'furor', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'married', 'couples', 'slept', 'separate', 'beds', 'skirts', 'were', 'ankle-length', 'Russell', 'Hughes', 'leave', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'fact', 'even', 'designed', 'special', 'bra', 'augment', 'display', 'as', 'much', 'Russell', 'chest', 'possible', 'Couple', 'innuendo', 'laden', 'script', 'blatant', 'sexuality', 'expressed', 'actors', 'facets', 'performances', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'steamy', '1940s.Whenever', 'watch', 'movie', 'today', 'experience/enjoy', 'ubiquitous', 'female', 'bodies/sexuality', 'owe', 'yourself', 'pay', 'homage', 'film', 'made', 'possible', 'one', 'broke', 'society', 'conventions.This', 'version', 'Outlaw', 'been', 'fully', 'colorized', 'first', 'time', 'adding', 'even', 'more', 'sizzle', 'life', 'smoldering', 'gem', 'insofar', 'possible', 'color', 'as', 'good', 'first-generation', 'true', 'color', 'film', 'feel', 'experience', 'having', 'seen', 'versions', '.Definitely', 'look', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'film']",N/A

390003,A2VGV2WOEPDPRW,6303934463,The Curmudgeon,"[0, 1]",This was apparently the first western film to use sex appeal as a major factor.  The sex symbol here was Jane Russell.  The film is also worth watching because it has a strange mixture of drama and comedy.The film essentially has four parts.  The first involves tough characters such as Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid as well as their nemesis the sheriff.  Walter Huston does a great job as Doc Holliday and Thomas Mitchell does equally well as the sheriff.  Billy the Kid comes off as a strange character but I suppose a killer would not be normal.The second part features Jane Russell with her tight-fitting and low-cut blouses which apparently were scandalous at the time.  Some sort of romantic tension develops between Russell and Billy the Kid which approaches farcical elements at times.  The third part involves an escape from marauding Indians thrown in because this is a western.The fourth part reverts to the tension between the gunslingers and the sheriff and seems headed to a happy ending but then various twists and turns occur to provide an unexpected ending.,4,HISTORY WORTH WATCHING,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,1075,"['was', 'apparently', 'first', 'western', 'film', 'use', 'sex', 'appeal', 'major', 'factor', 'sex', 'symbol', 'here', 'was', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'film', 'also', 'worth', 'watching', 'strange', 'mixture', 'drama', 'comedy.The', 'film', 'essentially', 'four', 'parts', 'first', 'tough', 'characters', 'such', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'as', 'well', 'nemesis', 'sheriff', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'great', 'job', 'Doc', 'Holliday', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'equally', 'well', 'sheriff', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'off', 'strange', 'character', 'suppose', 'killer', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'normal.The', 'second', 'part', 'Jane', 'Russell', 'tight-fitting', 'low-cut', 'blouses', 'apparently', 'were', 'scandalous', 'time', 'sort', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Russell', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'farcical', 'elements', 'times', 'third', 'part', 'escape', 'marauding', 'Indians', 'thrown', 'western.The', 'fourth', 'part', 'tension', 'gunslingers', 'sheriff', 'headed', 'happy', 'ending', 'then', 'various', 'twists', 'occur', 'provide', 'unexpected', 'ending']",N/A

But surprisingly, he wasn't bad as a director. He wasn't good, but he wasn't bad.  The only reason to watch this film is for Jane Russell's debut.  The script is inane, and the acting by the leads will make you cringe.  But bountiful Jane wears low cut tops, and when she bends over -- holy mackeral.  And there is more fun to the film in the close-ups Hughes takes of Jane emoting impending sex.  Hughes intention was for Jane to be erotic, but the expressions on her face are not of this world. There is no man that has ever seen these facial contortions on a woman.  Trust me.  Buy a used copy, only for these scenes.
