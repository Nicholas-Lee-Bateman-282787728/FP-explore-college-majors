Well, that's what you have with this one.  still can't believe it.  What on earth are they trying to do with Spiderman?  This obviously is a series for adults because, quite frankly, superheroes are supposed to be out for justice, truth and the american way, not to spend time in the gutter learning all the trash they can to spread it wherever. I don't recommend this product at all.

The factory shut down and now at age 50 I am searching for a way to feed my family. Thank God for Amazon. Anyways, I purchased this more for myself. I had no idea of the ratings, MILD language, sexual refences? Well whatever. Personally I don't care for for this form of animation. However the writing is excellent the only complaint is the last moment of the show we are left hanging. What will become of spiderman? Is it all a mind game? Is the girl really dead? My son of 10 saw the item come in but he understands that Dad says no sometimes and does not question my authority. He answers to me, I answer to God. I go to the pawn shop sometimes and I am appalled at what some parents allow in so far as games. A big M on the cover, and they still allow it. This is the difficulty. Parents should stop whining and open their eyes. The ratings exist for a reason. To wrap, The show is great, hope MTV picks it up so I am not left hanging, not for children, enough said.",5,A diffent Spiderman for ADULTS!,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,1067,"['Hi', 'rarely', 'write', 'review', 'too', 'busy', 'looking', 'work', 'last', 'place', 'businesses', 'closed', 'factory', 'shut', 'down', 'now', 'age', '50', 'am', 'searching', 'way', 'feed', 'family', 'Thank', 'God', 'Amazon', 'Anyways', 'purchased', 'more', 'had', 'idea', 'ratings', 'MILD', 'language', 'sexual', 'refences', 'Well', 'whatever', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'form', 'animation', 'However', 'writing', 'excellent', 'only', 'complaint', 'last', 'moment', 'show', 'are', 'left', 'hanging', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'spiderman', 'mind', 'game', 'girl', 'really', 'dead', 'son', '10', 'saw', 'item', 'come', 'Dad', 'sometimes', 'not', 'question', 'authority', 'answer', 'God', 'go', 'pawn', 'shop', 'sometimes', 'am', 'appalled', 'what', 'parents', 'allow', 'so', 'far', 'games', 'big', 'M', 'cover', 'still', 'allow', 'difficulty', 'Parents', 'should', 'stop', 'whining', 'open', 'eyes', 'ratings', 'exist', 'reason', 'wrap', 'show', 'great', 'hope', 'MTV', 'picks', 'so', 'am', 'not', 'left', 'hanging', 'not', 'children', 'enough', 'said']",Spider-Man: The Mutant Menace
