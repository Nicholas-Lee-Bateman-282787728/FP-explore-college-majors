1443211,A1NBXH3Q5Y933P,B0055SNHQ6,"asugar2 ""asugar2""","[1, 3]","Outsourced was a great show w' a mostly Asian cast! Please bring Outsourced Back!!Outsourcing has moved a lot of American jobs to India, but on TV it's actually bringing more jobs to Studio City. The new NBC comedy Outsourced has set up studio space at the CBS Radford lot, at the corner of Radford Avenue and Ventura BoulevardThe show stars Ben Rappaport and Diedrich Bader as Americans running Indian call centers for American companies. A cast of Indian American actors joins them as the local staff of the call center.The Radford lot provides a sense of history to the show's young actors. ""It's awesome,"" Rappaport said. ""You know, Gilligan's Island was there, Gunsmoke. We're right across the alleyway from where Seinfeld was shot.  It's just like a real magical feeling walking onto that lot.""Parvesh Cheena plays one of the call center workers, but he is a California local. Working at the Radford lot is convenient for him. ""It's close to my apartment,"" Cheena said.Sacha Dhawan, who plays the operator Manmeet, just moved to Studio City from the United Kingdom. Like Cheena, he's settled in near his studio. ""I've moved over here to start shooting, and I live in Studio City now, and I can jog to work in about 20 minutes,"" Dhawan said. ""I love it. We did a lot of work at Universal Studios, which is quite a big lot. What's great about Radford is it's small, it's intimate and it's just right for the show and it's very close to where I live.""You probably remember Bader as Oswald the delivery man on The Drew Carey Show. That show filmed on the vast Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank. Bader is enjoying the more close-knit feel of Radford.Already, Bader has discovered the treasure troves of television lore buried within the walls of CBS Radford. ""There's been a lot of great shows that shot there,"" Bader said. ""Seinfeld was there, so there's a great history to it. I love that, because I'm a studio geek. I love walking around and seeing what sets they're constructing. That's one of the reasons I love Warner Brothers so much because there was always so many new things happening. There's a sign that says Elaine's [still at Radford]. I'm not exactly sure why that's there. I don't know but it's nice to have that vibe. That was certainly a fantastic show.""You are quite likely to see the Bader family shopping around Studio City. Diedrich and his wife, Dulcy, have already discovered places to eat and shop. Dulcy will hit Levine Custom Framing and then take the kids for treats at Gelato Bar.""They have a great sorbet place, actually great gelato and sorbet,"" Dulcy said. ""It's across from Vitello's on Tujunga. We have a frame guy that we love. He does a brilliant job framing, named Steve Levine, so we go there, and our kids love to frame things now so we always take them to Gelato after.""The Bader family plans to continue exploring Tujunga Avenue, so look for them on the street. ""We like the Tujunga area,"" Diedrich said. ""We like that little strip there. They're nice shops and restaurants in the middle of that kind of stuff. It reminds us of Larchmont, where we're closer too.""Though new in town, Dhawan has already discovered a local eatery he likes. You may see him there on mornings before work. ""There's a really nice little place I go for breakfast called Studio Caf&eacute;, which I like,"" Dhawan said. ""It's right near CBS. That's great for breakfast.""With the studio located on what is often referred to as ""sushi alley,"" co-star Cheena prefers to dine after work. ""There's a late-night sushi place across the street, too,"" Cheena added.So Outsourced is set in Mumbai. How exactly do they recreate Mumbai in Studio City? Producers sent a crew to film actual locations. The studio actors get inserted into the backdrops with special effects.""We were doing it on green screen,"" Rappaport said. ""So it was me and Rizwan [Manji] sitting in the rickshaw, and there was a guy behind us with a 2-by-4 shaking the rickshaw, checking his texts every once in a while.""Even the Indian actors are American or British. Few of the cast have actually been to Mumbai. ""I'm from Chicago,"" Cheena said. ""Then we've got a couple of New Yorkers and some Brits, too.  I think now you're just seeing a lot of us on one network also, which has been great.  NBC's been a good home for a lot of ethnic diversity.""The Americans bring the culture clash to the call center, and therein lies the comedy. Meet Bader's character, Charlie, an American who's been in Mumbai for years, but hasn't quite adjusted.""I love Charlie because he's the guy who really says what everybody is thinking,"" Bader said. ""He's one of those types, and it's not exclusively American, like a French will want to go and hang out in the French community when they go to, say, Germany or something like that.  I remember when I was a kid in France, there'd be a Mickey D's there, and I would think, 'Why would an American come all the way here and go to Mickey D's? ' Well, a guy like Charlie would be that guy.  He would be that guy that would be at McDonald's going, 'I just want what I want.  Give it to me.  I want it hot.'""He even brings peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with Cheetos to work so he doesn't have to eat Indian food in the cafeteria. ""He just tries to replicate his world wherever he goes, and for him, it's really just a job, but it's not without interest.  But the interest is mostly that he gets paid.""You'll meet all the characters of Outsourced when the show premieres this fall. Once they're famous, we'll see how long they can roam Studio City freely. For now, they're excited to represent a new culture that most TV audiences haven't seen before.""A call-center job back in India is a really highly prestigious job,"" Cheena said. ""There's a whole different culture of people where they had to open, depending on which time zone you're working for, you have to have like your lunchtime, your after-work kind of bar thing.  My mom was back in India when I found out [I got the part], just visiting, and I called right before I got on the plane, and the whole family at the wedding just freaked out and erupted, and they're excited.""",5,So Outsourced is set in Mumbai.

I've been a fan of Bollywood musicals in particular ever since.  When I first saw the promos for this show I thought it looked too tame and bland, but boy was I surprised when I actually started to watch episodes.  Thanks to the cast's unique and playful chemistry and some offbeat, clever writing the show soared at times with wonderfully goofy scenarios played out well.  What a pleasant feeling to still be surprised by a sitcom.  I'll miss it--it didn't deserve its cancellation, as it was obvious the cast and writers had plenty of play still in them.

1443213,A3BV64Q6FE665L,B0055SNHQ6,C. Rexford,"[12, 14]","This is my review of the SHOW and not the DVD release due in September.Outsourced had to have one of the finest cast ensembles on current comedy television. The show seemed to balance itself between being a comedy, and showcasing a tiny bit of culture from India...just touching on the merits of traditional-vs-modern styles of behavior from both sides of the world.The comedy aspects were what one could expect from modern-day American tastes...some of which were not my own taste...however, what kept me really coming back to watch this show week after week were the heart-felt, endearing, and rich characterizations brought to the people in the show by what must be the most underrated cast performances on TV.The face of the show is the unsophisticated American in the middle of India, learning the culture differences the hard way in the midst of an outsourced office. The employees are learning too of some American culture, (though not our best), and the dance of comedy-of-errors begins. But wait...there is something else in this show...feeling. Real feeling. Some would say hart, or even darn good acting.The actors in Outsourced are so talented that it pains me that their abilities were not seen or appriciated by the mainstream. I felt a sincerety that managed to amuse and draw me closer to the characters, and left me wanting to know more about them.Each character was a true, human form of a type, rather than a shallow parody of same...for example, the 'hard-line' manager, Rajiv, was not entirely without sweetness and concern for his fellow countrymen's well being, despite the class differences that permitted him to ""talk down"" to his subordinates.This sort of deep characterization is not new to cinema, but to American comedy television it is certainly a rare occurance, and this show was brimming with such talent.There were moments where the show teetered in the 'other' direction of it's fellow sitcoms...particularly when Diedrich Bader (of the Drew Carey show...which I really liked), was in the scene, of being a little to silly or over the top. However, they never lost sight of the real charm and draw of the show, and that was the stories of each individual and the utterly enchanting way each actor warmed his or her way into our hearts, beconing us to just walk with them into a little realm of lovely stories about lovely people.I have definitely pre-ordered this gem of comedy television; I am truly sorry to see it end prematurely and I only hope and pray that the outstanding talents of the actors in this series will find a home in the industry that will allow them to continue to do what so little of the industry does...entertain us with joy.",5,Outstanding Cast for Outsourced,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,2683,"['review', 'SHOW', 'not', 'DVD', 'release', 'due', 'September.Outsourced', 'had', 'have', 'one', 'finest', 'cast', 'ensembles', 'current', 'comedy', 'television', 'show', 'seemed', 'balance', 'being', 'comedy', 'showcasing', 'tiny', 'bit', 'culture', 'India', 'just', 'touching', 'merits', 'traditional-vs-modern', 'styles', 'behavior', 'sides', 'world.The', 'comedy', 'aspects', 'were', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'modern-day', 'American', 'tastes', 'were', 'not', 'own', 'taste', 'however', 'what', 'kept', 'really', 'coming', 'back', 'watch', 'show', 'week', 'week', 'were', 'heart-felt', 'endearing', 'rich', 'characterizations', 'brought', 'people', 'show', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'underrated', 'cast', 'performances', 'TV.The', 'face', 'show', 'unsophisticated', 'American', 'middle', 'India', 'learning', 'culture', 'hard', 'way', 'midst', 'outsourced', 'office', 'employees', 'are', 'learning', 'too', 'American', 'culture', 'not', 'best', 'dance', 'comedy-of-errors', 'begins', 'wait', 'something', 'else', 'show', 'feeling', 'Real', 'feeling', 'would', 'say', 'hart', 'even', 'darn', 'good', 'acting.The', 'actors', 'Outsourced', 'are', 'so', 'talented', 'abilities', 'were', 'not', 'seen', 'appriciated', 'mainstream', 'felt', 'sincerety', 'managed', 'amuse', 'draw', 'closer', 'characters', 'left', 'wanting', 'know', 'more', 'them.Each', 'character', 'was', 'true', 'human', 'form', 'type', 'rather', 'shallow', 'parody', 'same', 'example', ""'hard-line"", 'manager', 'Rajiv', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'sweetness', 'concern', 'fellow', 'countrymen', 'well', 'being', 'class', 'differences', 'permitted', 'talk', 'down', 'subordinates.This', 'sort', 'deep', 'characterization', 'not', 'new', 'cinema', 'American', 'comedy', 'television', 'certainly', 'rare', 'occurance', 'show', 'was', 'brimming', 'such', 'talent.There', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'show', 'teetered', ""'other"", 'direction', 'fellow', 'sitcoms', 'particularly', 'when', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Drew', 'Carey', 'show', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'scene', 'being', 'little', 'silly', 'top', 'However', 'never', 'lost', 'sight', 'real', 'charm', 'draw', 'show', 'was', 'stories', 'individual', 'utterly', 'enchanting', 'way', 'actor', 'warmed', 'way', 'hearts', 'beconing', 'just', 'walk', 'little', 'realm', 'lovely', 'stories', 'lovely', 'people.I', 'have', 'definitely', 'pre-ordered', 'gem', 'comedy', 'television', 'am', 'truly', 'sorry', 'see', 'end', 'prematurely', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'outstanding', 'talents', 'actors', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'home', 'industry', 'will', 'allow', 'continue', 'do', 'what', 'so', 'little', 'industry', 'entertain', 'joy']",Outsourced: The Complete Series
1443214,A2SUCCLWUA9H2S,B0055SNHQ6,David R. Courtney,"[2, 2]","This is really a review of two ""Outsourced.""  There are the first three episodes and then there is the rest of the series.The first three episodes can only be described as poor.  Predictably, these were merely a rehash of the movie.  What was startling was how they made every effort to dumb-it-down.  This was amazing because the movie could hardly be described as cerebral entertainment. (It sadly reminded me of why I got rid of my television years ago.)  The characters were one-dimensional, and given their ethnic character could almost be described as insulting.  Although they acknowledge the time difference between the US and India, everyone showed up to work in the morning and went home in the evening.  This was completely baffling and ignored the day/night lack of synchronisation which is pivotal to the entire Indian call-centre culture.But by about the fourth or fifth episode, the show freed itself from the film and developed its own style.  In the process it became a very good show.  The characters became more human and multi-dimensional.  The show even began to be educational by introducing aspects of Indian life that were unfamiliar to most people (e.g., caroms, paan)  However their attempts at explaining arranged marriages never quite hit the mark.  (I never met my wife until the day of the marriage proposal.) The humour was subtle enough that you didn't feel like you were being hit over the head with it.Many decry NBC's decision to axe the show.  Perhaps the network felt that they had to cancel it to make room for something truly bad so that they could maintain their poor reputation. (Cynical? - moi?)  I think that by cancelling it they actually did the show, its actors, and producers a favour.  They saved the show from that terrible fate which inevitably hits a show that has been on too long.  That is when the actors become tired. Everything that can be done has already been done. Even worse is when the writers and producers feel that they have to ""jump the shark"" to infuse life into a dying show.  By cancelling it when they did, they left behind a very nice legacy.All things considered. I feel that this really was a good show.",4,two programs with two reviews,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2175,"['really', 'review', 'two', 'Outsourced', 'are', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'then', 'rest', 'series.The', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'poor', 'Predictably', 'were', 'merely', 'rehash', 'movie', 'What', 'was', 'startling', 'was', 'how', 'made', 'effort', 'dumb-it-down', 'was', 'amazing', 'movie', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'described', 'cerebral', 'entertainment', 'sadly', 'reminded', 'why', 'got', 'rid', 'television', 'years', 'ago', 'characters', 'were', 'one-dimensional', 'given', 'ethnic', 'character', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'described', 'insulting', 'acknowledge', 'time', 'difference', 'US', 'India', 'everyone', 'showed', 'work', 'morning', 'went', 'home', 'evening', 'was', 'completely', 'baffling', 'ignored', 'day/night', 'lack', 'synchronisation', 'pivotal', 'entire', 'Indian', 'call-centre', 'culture.But', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'episode', 'show', 'freed', 'film', 'developed', 'own', 'style', 'process', 'became', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'characters', 'became', 'more', 'human', 'multi-dimensional', 'show', 'even', 'began', 'be', 'educational', 'introducing', 'aspects', 'Indian', 'life', 'were', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'people', 'e.g.', 'caroms', 'paan', 'However', 'attempts', 'explaining', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'never', 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'never', 'met', 'wife', 'day', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'humour', 'was', 'subtle', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'being', 'hit', 'head', 'it.Many', 'decry', 'NBC', 'decision', 'axe', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'network', 'felt', 'had', 'cancel', 'make', 'room', 'something', 'truly', 'bad', 'could', 'maintain', 'poor', 'reputation', 'Cynical', 'moi', 'think', 'cancelling', 'actually', 'did', 'show', 'actors', 'producers', 'favour', 'saved', 'show', 'terrible', 'fate', 'inevitably', 'show', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'actors', 'become', 'tired', 'Everything', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'Even', 'worse', 'when', 'writers', 'producers', 'feel', 'have', 'jump', 'shark', 'infuse', 'life', 'dying', 'show', 'cancelling', 'when', 'did', 'left', 'behind', 'very', 'nice', 'legacy.All', 'things', 'considered', 'feel', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'show']",Outsourced: The Complete Series

1443217,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0055SNHQ6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[59, 63]","Well, they went and dropped the axe on another show I liked. I'm starting to think it's personal. Based on a romantic comedy pseudo-Bollywood film that flew under the radar in 2009, OUTSOURCED was a promising new show from NBC. It offers a smile-inducing glance at life in Mumbai, India. It's what happens when Todd Dempsy (Ben Rappaport) relocates there to keep his job at the Mid-America Novelties company. In Mumbai, Todd heads up a call center manned by rustic Hindi employees who are unanimously in the dark when it comes to the American way of life. East meets West in a culture clash, differing philosophies and world views collide, and all this brought into a sort of perspective by the presence of plastic vomit and whoopie cushions.Todd Dempsy - stranger in a strange land - is our eyes and ears, our point of view character, and we go thru his acclimation period and his initial cluelessness regarding the do's and don'ts in India. He inadvertently violates pretty much all the social rules, and his misadventures are written well enough that they play for good laughs. Not that he comes off as a bumbly clown. He's more like a regular dude who skipped orientation day and is now paying for it.I was wondering whether the cast would be able to maintain the funny. I was dreading that one-trick pony, which is the humor in the culture clash. But the writers have made these characters so quirky and appealing enough that what happens to them matters to the viewer. Todd's call center crew is comprised of oddballs, but personable oddballs, and so credit the very likable Indian actors. And they're not even as peculiar as Todd's new American pal, Charlie. Dietrick Bader, who is pretty terrific, injects some serious weird into ""Charlie."" Here's him expounding on how the locals try to fool foreigners about their holidays: ""For Elephant Day, my workers tricked me into painting my face and walking around with the pockets pulled out of my pants. It was all fun and games 'til I whipped out the trunk."" Charlie is kinda creepy, as well.Any sitcom worth its salt would have to have a love story and the more unrequited, the better. In Mumbai, Todd becomes torn between two women: the carefree Australian babe, Tonya (Pippa Black), and the beautiful Indian girl, Asha (Rebecca Hazlewood), who is undergoing the process of an arranged marriage. At this point, this romantic thread can go anywhere. Todd initially falls for Asha, but Tonya is so winsome.I love the constant shifts in perspective. One moment we look at a situation from Todd's viewpoint. The next, we're presented with his employees' side of things, and there's a jarring dissimilarity. One day Todd cautions his crew about Black Friday and how things can rapidly get out of hand with the pushing and the shoving and the rioting, and the crew laughs at him. One worker even scoffs: ""You call that a riot?"" And then, en route to a team building retreat, the workers are dismayed by Todd's sheer inability to muscle his way on board a train (mostly because they have to keep getting off to wait for the next one). And so we're reminded of India's vast population. It's tiny, throwaway touches like that that I relish. The western viewer gets an education AND some good laughs. Those uninitiated will get exposed to Bollywood, that movie industry woven into the very fabric of Indian culture (You'll hear the cast drop names like ""Hrithik Roshan"" and ""Aishwarya Rai"" and if you don't know who those are, you are missing out big). We pick up social cues such as that kissing in public is very frowned upon and that it's okay for dudes to dance with each other in a club, although I personally don't think it's ever okay for dudes to dance with each other anywhere (sorry, guess I'm not open-minded on everything). Each week explores that irresistible fish-out-of-water theme. Each week delivers offbeat dialogue and madcap scrapes and a stretching out of that ""Is it Asha or is it Tonya?"" thread. I was also waiting for the episode which never came, in which Charlie gets put in prison. He's funny. But way creepy.Favorite episodes are ""Jolly Windaloo Day"" (fooled into thinking it's a national holiday, Todd gives his workers the day off), ""Touched by an Angelo"" (the call center receives a shipment of risque novelty items), ""Bolloween"" (Todd tries to explain the concept of Halloween and then throws a Halloween costume party), and ""Training Day"" (the staff go on a retreat while Tonya gives Charlie pointers on how to pick up chicks). Parvesh Cheena as the chubby, good-natured Gupta is damn lovable. And I'm sorry, but one of the characters - Manmeet - has a name that just makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it.NBC, you guys rather suck.",4,"""Jolly Vindaloo Day!

From premature assumptions before it even premiered to becoming NBC's highest rated new scripted series to getting stuck on the bubble awaiting its fate.The comedy about an Indian call center for an American novelties company could be the biggest underdog story of the season outside of Dillon, Texas. Despite getting shuffled to a difficult timeslot (after doing very well in its original) and continuing to get unwarranted and baseless criticism from critics and some viewers alike, Outsourced forged ahead to grow into one of television's most charming series.Outsourced doesn't drop a joke every other second like other shows may attempt to do, but you can't help but keep a smile on your face the entire half hour. Each episode always builds up to the satisfying punchline at the end and that is very refreshing.The series is also relatable, a workplace comedy that uses its different and unique setting to its advantage.Being set in India only adds to what makes the series so good. Outsourced puts a face behind those calls you make about products or support. They've managed to touch on how call centers are important and meaningful jobs for the locals in India (and the Philippines as well).And those faces and personalities as just like you or me. They may have a different culture, faith, clothing, and food, but they go through the same things in everyday life; jobs, family, friends, romance. It's all there and with a talented, charming ensemble cast to bring it all to life.Going against possibly what half of America thinks about the show (without even watching an episode), Outsourced is charming. The characters and cast are charming. You can't help but like these characters, each one of them contributing to the episode every week.And maybe the most surprising, Outsourced has a lot of heart.If you want a sample of just how good the series can be, look no further than the two episodes NBCU has submitted for Emmy consideration: Episode 11, ""A Sitar is Born"" and Episode 17, ""Todd's Holi War.""Both are not only the funniest and most fun episodes of the season, but they are perfect showcases for the wonderfully talented cast. And one of the most refreshingly unique aspects of the series is that it isn't mean-spirited or cynical.Outsourced is fresh, different, sweet, charming and one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV today",5,Funny and charming with heart,1308268800,"06 17, 2011",2011,2409,"['NBC', 'Outsourced', 'had', 'bumpy', 'roller', 'coaster', 'life', 'premature', 'assumptions', 'even', 'premiered', 'becoming', 'NBC', 'highest', 'rated', 'new', 'scripted', 'series', 'getting', 'stuck', 'bubble', 'awaiting', 'fate.The', 'comedy', 'Indian', 'call', 'center', 'American', 'novelties', 'company', 'could', 'be', 'biggest', 'underdog', 'story', 'season', 'Dillon', 'Texas', 'getting', 'shuffled', 'difficult', 'timeslot', 'doing', 'very', 'well', 'original', 'continuing', 'get', 'unwarranted', 'baseless', 'criticism', 'critics', 'viewers', 'alike', 'Outsourced', 'forged', 'ahead', 'grow', 'one', 'television', 'most', 'charming', 'series.Outsourced', ""n't"", 'drop', 'joke', 'other', 'second', 'other', 'shows', 'may', 'attempt', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'keep', 'smile', 'face', 'entire', 'half', 'hour', 'episode', 'always', 'satisfying', 'punchline', 'end', 'very', 'refreshing.The', 'series', 'also', 'relatable', 'workplace', 'comedy', 'different', 'unique', 'setting', 'advantage.Being', 'set', 'India', 'only', 'what', 'series', 'so', 'good', 'Outsourced', 'face', 'calls', 'make', 'products', 'support', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'touch', 'how', 'call', 'centers', 'are', 'important', 'meaningful', 'jobs', 'locals', 'India', 'Philippines', 'as', 'well', '.And', 'personalities', 'just', 'may', 'have', 'different', 'culture', 'faith', 'clothing', 'food', 'go', 'same', 'things', 'everyday', 'life', 'jobs', 'family', 'friends', 'romance', 'there', 'talented', 'charming', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'bring', 'life.Going', 'possibly', 'what', 'half', 'America', 'show', 'even', 'watching', 'episode', 'Outsourced', 'charming', 'characters', 'cast', 'are', 'charming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'characters', 'one', 'contributing', 'episode', 'week.And', 'maybe', 'most', 'surprising', 'Outsourced', 'lot', 'heart.If', 'want', 'sample', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'look', 'further', 'two', 'episodes', 'NBCU', 'submitted', 'Emmy', 'consideration', 'Episode', '11', 'Sitar', 'Born', 'Episode', '17', 'Todd', 'Holi', 'War', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'funniest', 'most', 'fun', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'perfect', 'showcases', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'cast', 'one', 'most', 'refreshingly', 'unique', 'aspects', 'series', ""n't"", 'mean-spirited', 'cynical.Outsourced', 'fresh', 'different', 'sweet', 'charming', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'comedies', 'TV', 'today']",Outsourced: The Complete Series

The basic premise, that wherever your office is located in the world, you're going to have problems, reverberates from some  universal truths. Getting along with others in close quarters is difficult. The people who seem like your enemies can be your best allies. The people who seem like your friends can do you the most harm. The best laid plans can be derailed with a simple flick of a switch. A lack of a common core of experience is usually the basis for miscommunication. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Many more truths are portrayed subtly and cleverly. The clash between Indian and American cultures is reduced, although in a very small scale, with the publication of this series. The misconceptions each country has about the other is a constant source of amusement and is amply displayed in this entertaining series. If you've ever had a yearning to be anywhere near India and learn a little about a culture that is one of the fastest growing in the world, you couldn't do better than getting this little slice of south asian spice.

Attempt to remind audiences that laughter is the best medicine for what ails them!In an era of reality TV, this sitcom about an American employee named Todd Dempsey transferred overseas seemed like a good idea at the drawing board: He has the new job of explaining American culture to the Indian call center employees of Mid-American Novelties. Meanwhile, they familiarize him with Indian ways and customs. This is so he will successfully live in his new country. Rather than being the ultra-competent 'know-it-all' who does no wrong, a running storyline has Dempsey making several gaffes during his own job orientation period.The show was perhaps trying to promote 'cross-cultural exchange' as the important workplace concept. And people do grow from learning about each other's customs and laws.The workers and supervisor do come together to support one another as a gennuine surrogate family. Madhuri, whose call center wages support her entire family, is encouraged to showcase a beautiful singing voice in a contest. These people don't just clock out at the end of a day, they liked spending leisure time with each other.But the well-intentioned plot works much better in schools--rather than having been targeted at people who are first worried about how to pay bills. It also might have been hard for intended American audiences to find this subject material funny or ironically trustworthy in the face of prolonged unemployment.During a better economy, this series just could have been considered 'interesting' or 'creative'.
