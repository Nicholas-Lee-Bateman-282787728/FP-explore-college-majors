1043090,AXNL4LD1Y1FJV,B000M3439E,Abrahamal Lincolni,"[5, 5]","Twin Peaks is the best TV show I have ever seen. It was far ahead of its time, so much so that it became the talk of the town in a California suburb where I lived at the time it first aired. The show's characters are better developed than any other show. The storylines are more interesting than any other show. There is an oddly strange mix of mysticism, spirituality, mystery, and the show is nothing short of revelatory when it comes to the light and darkness that can be found in American Society.My one complaint about this DVD set is that the video compression on the DVDs are not quite as high quality as it was on the First Season DVD release. This is probably owing to the fact that only two episodes were placed on each disc in the First Season set, while four episodes are placed on each disc in this set.",5,That gum you like is coming back in style . . .,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,816,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'best', 'TV', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'became', 'talk', 'town', 'California', 'suburb', 'where', 'lived', 'time', 'first', 'aired', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'developed', 'other', 'show', 'storylines', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'other', 'show', 'oddly', 'strange', 'mix', 'mysticism', 'spirituality', 'mystery', 'show', 'nothing', 'short', 'revelatory', 'when', 'light', 'darkness', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'American', 'Society.My', 'one', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'set', 'video', 'compression', 'DVDs', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'was', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'release', 'probably', 'owing', 'fact', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'placed', 'disc', 'First', 'Season', 'set', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'placed', 'disc', 'set']",N/A

""Paramount say it's almost a sure thing that you'll see Season Two, as well as a re-release of Season One with the Pilot included, released by Paramount as soon as the rights revert back to them around September 2005.The current rights holder, Lion's Gate (formally Artisan) has no plans to further exploit Twin Peaks or any of it's Spelling Entertainment titles due to the short time frame they have before the rights are lost. So it's all up to Paramount now.Our sources also tell us that part of the reason for the delay of Season Two in other international regions is to have one big release worldwide around the same time in every country, US included. So for you folks overseas, you're also being affected by the rights issue here in the US. The other, though somewhat lesser reason for the delay is to allow more time to work on bonus features"", says the site.Nice. It's still coming. But how about ""Fire Walk with Me""? Is there truly any chance of seeing that Directors Cut? (for the unswerved, Lynch was forced to cut hours from the film for its original theatrical run - and that's basically the reason why it makes no frickin' sense). Maybe. Another top Lynch resource, Dugpa.com, has contacted the studio who planned on releasing the cut bits, and got a favourable response back. ""MK2 has been getting lots of support from the fans to release FWWM on DVD with Deleted Scenes. I have gotten word back from MK2 that they are in fact trying to meet with Lynch once more in hopes to come to an agreement, and will be pushing their 2 Disc Collectors DVD of FWWM back to 2005. They will in fact still be releasing a single disc version in December of the film with a 5.1 English and French audio mix.

1043096,A3N355UN8EHNB4,B000M3439E,Arbiter of Good Taste,"[3, 5]","The first part, that is: I got my copy of episodes 8 through 18 (3 DVDs) on Friday morning (05 January 2007) through Amazon Germany.  (The second part of Season Two ships in April.)The packaging is pretty close to that of Season One, but a bit skimpier: three discs on clear plastic Digipak mounts with character portraits in the background (this time Josie Packard, Shelly Johnson, and Dr. Jacoby).  The discs themselves each have a series icon: a log (not clearly the Log Lady's though), a cup of damned fine coffee, and (curiously) an audio cassette (this is, I believe, a mistake: all of the audio cassettes used throughout the series, particularly the infamous Diane Tapes, are microcassettes; what's shown on Disc 3 is a regular-sized audio cassette).  A full panel of the ""Double R"" diner is repeated from the packaging from Season One.  The photo you see of Agent Cooper on the US Amazon Web site is on the front of the package.  The whole thing comes in a flimsy cardboard slipcase which has a color portrait of Cooper holding his tape recorder and, again, that same ""Double R"" photo in the background.  This is considerably less interesting than the clear plastic slipcase for Season One which superimposed the classic Laura Palmer homecoming queen portrait over her face as first seen when it is unwrapped from the plastic.  There is no booklet as there was with Season One.The most amazing revelation for me of the DVD release is the audio.  If you haven't outfitted your home cinema with a 5.1 Surround Sound system, this will make you run out and do it right away.  The sound is truly spectacular, especially in the subtle use of layers as when there is dialogue, ambient noise, music being played in the scene, and soundtrack scoring laid over it all (Garland Briggs' description of his vision of Bobby in the White Lodge comes to mind, as does the Hayward family's dinner party for the Palmers).The picture quality is also superb and sharp and, again, revelatory after years of watching those old VHS tapes with five episodes squished onto each cassette.  The colors are considerably more vibrant than I ever remember.  In fact, too vibrant in some cases: the saturation can be overwhelming.  I had to turn down the color on my TV set a few notches, and there are still a few items which seem unnaturally dense (even with the color turned down, Lucy's lipstick seems positively radioactive).There are no extras - zero, zilch.  No audio commentary, no option for the Log Lady's introductions (originally taped when the series was rebroadcast on the Bravo network and offered as options on the Season One set), nothing.  And the program design is absolute bargain basement: on each disc, you can select ""play all"" or click on each episode from a still menu, but that's it: once you click, you go right to the episode.  Chapter breaks come uniformly after the opening credits, at the point of each commercial break, and before the final credits.  There is a choice of English, German, Italian, or Spanish audio, but only the English is in 5.1 (the others are in mono).  Subtitles are offered in nine languages.  In all, this is a considerable letdown after the gorgeous interactive menu design of Season One.As for the show itself, this is maybe my eighth go-round with the entire series, and it just keeps getting better and better.  If anything, its humor and surreal qualities seem more trenchant in 2007 than ever before.Knowing the marketing policies behind DVDs, I will not be at all surprised if the set being advertised as ""Twin Peaks: The Complete Mystery"" and available for preorder at German Amazon (shipping date in October 2007) has all of the extras which are so sorely missing from this first installment of Season Two.  (For that matter, since the USA release of Season Two coming in April 2007 has been announced at 6 discs, I doubt if it will have any extra materials.)

The only bad thing about this set is with the first season and pilot long out of print it will be hard for new fans to pick this one up.  TWIN PEAKS is a series you should watch as a whole, and it would be disaster to walk in right in the middle of the Laura Palmer mystery.  But if you own or are familiar with the first season this one's a must buy.  Halfway through the season the killer is unmasked, and then the show adds in a struggle with Windom Earle, Cooper's ex-partner.This DVD set comes as a cardboard sleeve holding three slim line cases each with two discs in it.  You get episodes 8-29 of the show spread out over six discs.  Each individual disc has one bonus interview with a director of the series (Caleb Deschanel, Tim Hunter, etc) and also an interview with Lynch's daughter, Jennifer Lynch, who wrote the book version of THE DIARY OF LAURA PALMER.  On the final disc is an interview grid which features a large number of the cast members talking about their experiences - most recognizable would be Kyle MacLachlan and David Duchovny.The transfers are awesome.

It is hard to believe that Twin Peaks made it to television in the first place, much less that it actually lasted a second season.  The series holds up very well over time.  Without nudity or even any scantily clad women, there is more sexual tension than in ""Desperate Housewives,"" ""Sex in the City,"" or ""Friends.""  David Lynch populated this series with an incredibly large number of regular-appearing actors and cameos.  All the women are gorgeous (okay, maybe Nadine is an exception, but her energy and vitality more than makes up for any lack of beauty).  It is also interesting to note, that unlike the other series mentioned, David Lynch's women range in age from teen-agers to grandmothers.  There are hundreds of two-minute scenes that are worthy of YouTube, and although the fairly long cameo by David Lynch himself is not all that worthy, it is a hoot to see him in action, but he needs to stick to his day job:  writing, directing, and dreaming.

1043104,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000M3439E,calvinnme,"[10, 12]","It's great to see that the second and final season of this groundbreaking series is finally being released. ""Twin Peaks"" was a fantastic show that was quite experimental for its time (1990-1991) that at it's worst was better than most everything else on TV. I wish the show could have survived longer, but with an awful second season time slot - Saturday at 10pm - it had no chance. The revelation of Laura Palmer's killer took the wind out of the sails somewhat just nine shows into the second season, but the true theme of Twin Peaks was about the evil in the woods that took the form of the killer and the seamy underbelly of what appeared to be everyday small-town life. The murder of Laura Palmer was just the surface of that. Three somewhat pointless episodes followed the one that revealed Laura's killer, but then the show bounced back with the Windham Earle storyline. Unfortunately many viewers had stopped watching the show by then. Perhaps the lasting legacy of ""Twin Peaks"" is that it made series with weird subplots, long story arcs, and oddball characters more acceptable to the networks. For example, I don't think that ""The X-Files"" could have made it to the air in 1993 had it not been for ""Twin Peaks"" preceding it and succeeding. After all, after a show where there is a dwarf that materializes on a bed, dances, and talks backwards, an alternate reality where clones are created and sent out to the world, and creamed corn as a symbol of suffering, the adventures of Scully and Mulder look as thematically tame as Dragnet.",5,An experiment that became groundbreaking television,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1543,"['great', 'see', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'finally', 'being', 'released', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'fantastic', 'show', 'was', 'quite', 'experimental', 'time', '1990-1991', 'was', 'better', 'most', 'everything', 'else', 'TV', 'wish', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'longer', 'awful', 'second', 'season', 'time', 'slot', 'Saturday', '10pm', 'had', 'chance', 'revelation', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'killer', 'took', 'wind', 'sails', 'somewhat', 'just', 'nine', 'shows', 'second', 'season', 'true', 'theme', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'evil', 'woods', 'took', 'form', 'killer', 'seamy', 'underbelly', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'everyday', 'small-town', 'life', 'murder', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'was', 'just', 'surface', 'Three', 'somewhat', 'pointless', 'episodes', 'followed', 'one', 'revealed', 'Laura', 'killer', 'then', 'show', 'bounced', 'back', 'Windham', 'Earle', 'storyline', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'viewers', 'had', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'then', 'Perhaps', 'lasting', 'legacy', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'made', 'series', 'weird', 'subplots', 'long', 'story', 'arcs', 'oddball', 'characters', 'more', 'acceptable', 'networks', 'example', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'X-Files', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'air', '1993', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'preceding', 'succeeding', 'show', 'where', 'dwarf', 'bed', 'dances', 'talks', 'backwards', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'clones', 'are', 'created', 'sent', 'out', 'world', 'creamed', 'corn', 'symbol', 'suffering', 'adventures', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'look', 'thematically', 'tame', 'Dragnet']",N/A

1043113,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000M3439E,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","""Twin Peaks"" was the ultimate cult TV show -- suspenseful, complex, wittily written and with hidden layers that casual channel-flippers might not catch.And while the long-awaited second season is not quite the brilliant experience that the first was, it's still an astoundingly good and convoluted piece of storytelling. With more episodes to fill out, David Lynch continued his exploration of small-town America -- too bad it didn't last more than this second season.As the second season opens, there is major unrest for the inhabitants of Twin Peaks -- and a badly-injured Cooper (Kyle McLachlan) has a vision that may have something to do with Laura Palmer's death. But the murder investigation is only getting more bizarre, as Cooper learns of Laura's diary -- and discovers a bizarre twist in an already-bizarre murder investigation.The mystery is solved mid-season, and the foreshadowing reveals who it is (or rather, who it SEEMS to be). But that's not the only plotline in the second season -- Lynch bestows a psychopathic ex-Fed, parasitic demons, a disastrous beauty pageant, strange caves, and a twin pair of ""Lodges"" that seem to exist outside space and time... which Cooper's murderous ex-partner is searching for.The second season of ""Twin Peaks"" is, admittedly, not quite as good as the first season. The first season was tight as a drum, while the second has some storylines that run away from the writers. But even mediocre ""Twin Peaks"" is simply brilliant and bizarrely entertaining.In fact, this season gets even weirder than the first. Lynch's quirkiness grows into total weirdness, full of symbolism, surreality and dirty little secrets right up the end. The series is sprinkled with what seems to be random weirdness, but as the complicated storylines wind on, the true meaning of them becomes clear. Now THAT is great writing.And Lynch and Co. maintained the strangeness, and actually increased. The second season relies heavily on mysticism and the supernatural, like that whole Black-White Lodge clash, and all the storylines circling around it. Just look at that soul-in-the-wooden-knob story. And Lynch's warped sense of humor is still in place (""I haven't felt this excited since I punctured Caroline's aorta!"").Perhaps the biggest problem is the ending. ABC canned the series before Lynch could wrap up the various plotlines, so it ends with a lot of cliffhangers and no resolution. Be prepared to yell, ""What next? What next?""Coop grows even more likable in this season, as he comes face-to-face with some of the nastier aspects of Twin Peaks -- not to mention his own past. He even gets a motivating love interest. Other characters (such as the Log Lady) get more attention as well, but Coop's personal journey is perhaps the most intriguing.A series like ""Twin Peaks"" only comes along once in.... well, decades. It's influenced other weird series (""Wonderfalls,"" ""Lost,"" ""The X-Files""), but the original is the best -- a stunning, creepy, bizarre headtrip.",4,The second time around,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,2988,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'was', 'ultimate', 'cult', 'TV', 'show', 'suspenseful', 'complex', 'wittily', 'written', 'hidden', 'layers', 'casual', 'channel-flippers', 'might', 'not', 'catch.And', 'long-awaited', 'second', 'season', 'not', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'experience', 'first', 'was', 'still', 'astoundingly', 'good', 'convoluted', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'more', 'episodes', 'fill', 'out', 'David', 'Lynch', 'continued', 'exploration', 'small-town', 'America', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'more', 'second', 'second', 'season', 'major', 'unrest', 'inhabitants', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'badly-injured', 'Cooper', 'Kyle', 'McLachlan', 'vision', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'death', 'murder', 'investigation', 'only', 'getting', 'more', 'bizarre', 'Cooper', 'Laura', 'diary', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'already-bizarre', 'murder', 'investigation.The', 'mystery', 'solved', 'mid-season', 'foreshadowing', 'reveals', 'who', 'rather', 'who', 'SEEMS', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'plotline', 'second', 'season', 'Lynch', 'psychopathic', 'ex-Fed', 'parasitic', 'demons', 'disastrous', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'strange', 'caves', 'twin', 'pair', 'Lodges', 'seem', 'exist', 'outside', 'space', 'time', 'Cooper', 'murderous', 'ex-partner', 'searching', 'for.The', 'second', 'season', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'admittedly', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'tight', 'drum', 'second', 'storylines', 'run', 'away', 'writers', 'even', 'mediocre', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'bizarrely', 'entertaining.In', 'fact', 'season', 'even', 'weirder', 'first', 'Lynch', 'quirkiness', 'total', 'weirdness', 'full', 'symbolism', 'surreality', 'dirty', 'little', 'secrets', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'series', 'sprinkled', 'what', 'be', 'random', 'weirdness', 'complicated', 'storylines', 'wind', 'true', 'meaning', 'clear', 'Now', 'great', 'writing.And', 'Lynch', 'Co.', 'maintained', 'strangeness', 'actually', 'increased', 'second', 'season', 'relies', 'heavily', 'mysticism', 'supernatural', 'whole', 'Black-White', 'Lodge', 'clash', 'storylines', 'circling', 'Just', 'look', 'soul-in-the-wooden-knob', 'story', 'Lynch', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'still', 'place', 'have', ""n't"", 'felt', 'excited', 'punctured', 'Caroline', 'aorta', 'biggest', 'problem', 'ending', 'ABC', 'canned', 'series', 'Lynch', 'could', 'wrap', 'up', 'various', 'plotlines', 'lot', 'cliffhangers', 'resolution', 'Be', 'prepared', 'yell', 'What', 'next', 'What', 'Coop', 'even', 'more', 'likable', 'season', 'face-to-face', 'nastier', 'aspects', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'not', 'mention', 'own', 'past', 'even', 'motivating', 'love', 'interest', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'Log', 'Lady', 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'well', 'Coop', 'personal', 'journey', 'perhaps', 'most', 'intriguing.A', 'series', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'only', 'along', 'once', 'well', 'decades', 'influenced', 'other', 'weird', 'series', 'Wonderfalls', 'Lost', 'X-Files', 'original', 'best', 'stunning', 'creepy', 'bizarre', 'headtrip']",N/A

Twin Peaks had a dream-like quality that pulled the viewer into the non-linear world of creator David Lynch's unique subconscious, along with the dream visions and a world populated with characters right out of a Fellini or dada-esque story, complete with an eccentric town populated by midgets, giants, transvestite FBI agents, a one-armed man, a one-eyed woman, agoraphobics, Tibet-loving law enforcement agents, and demon-possessed killers.Because I can never say enough positive things about this delightful, mind-bending, twisted, brilliant series, I will rate the DVD package instead.  It is acceptable, but not great because the special features are few and far between.  Still, the Season 2 DVD package is worth every penny, and everybody who cares about art in entertainment should view every single Twin Peaks show.  For those who think the series lost quality after the first season, I strongly disagree.  Even with Laura's death solved and the killer brought to justice, there's plenty more weirdness in Twin Peaks to enjoy.  It's too bad the networks canceled the show after two short years.

Season One was pretty decent despite the sad fact that the pilot was not included and is now very hard (if not impossible) to find, it being a Japanese import.Although Season Two was lambasted by critics and the public alike, it was still appointment television for us die-hard Twin Peaks fans. True, we didn't get the answer to ""Who Killed Laura Palmer?"" right away, but it was still a trip just to be a part of the viewing audience. The show wasn't just about Laura Palmer, it was about the Pacific Northwestern town of Twin Peaks, all of its colorful inhabitants and the goings-on within. Personally, I thought it was just as good, if not better than Season One (which is, by all rights, an all-time classic which forever changed the face of television as we knew it.) Hollywood is still, after almost 17 years later, trying to catch up to it. That's how influential and far ahead of its time this show really is.I sincerely hope that Season One will be completely redone, with the original ABC pilot included, so that a new generation can be introduced to this fine show and see for themselves just why I'm saying all these wonderful things about it. It has not been on TV in far too many years.And it's high time it came back.So obtain the pilot, Seasons One & Two, kick back with some cherry pie & coffee (or whatever you prefer),sit back and get lost inside the world of Twin Peaks.

Instead of the nice fold-out pack from the first season, Paramount went with slim CD boxes (6 CDs) this time around stuck into a slip cover. At least they aren't double-sided discs. I guess this means a deluxe set, combining the two seasons, will be issued sometime in the near future, so you may want to wait and see.For such a short-lived series, Twin Peaks is arguably one of the most influential shows in television history, reshaping the medium by turning it in on itself.  Lynch used the death of Laura Palmer as a portal into the grainy world of small town America.  It was a continuation of the theme he set in Blue Velvet, and not surprisingly Kyle MacLachlan serves as his agent in uncovering the hidden nature of the notorious Twin Peaks.  However, while Lynch wanted to leave the murder hanging in the air, ABC wanted to resolve it, and apparently so did Mark Frost, and the suspense that carried the show was lost, never to be recovered.While the first season was tightly wrought, with all 7 episodes building seamlessly on the pilot episode, season two is a mixed bag.  The characters multiply and the story line seems to grow ever more convoluted, which I guess is why ABC wanted to see something wrapped up before the show got completely out of control.  Yet, the eeriness remained as TP came to personify that dark part of small town consciousness that lurks in almost every community.You either loved the show or hated it.  There were few persons who were indifferent to it, which is a pretty good indicator of the impact Twin Peaks had on television.  It would influence so many dramas and even comedies that followed, and spawn a whole range of stepchildren on HBO like Carnivale and Deadwood, where directors and writers could more freely explore their dark themes.  It is pretty amazing that Lynch and Frost were able to get away with what they did on Twin Peaks, showing just how effective a tool suspense could be if handled with a deft touch.",5,At long last !,1167091200,"12 26, 2006",2006,2102,"['long', 'wait', 'finally', 'paid', 'off', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'packaging', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'Instead', 'nice', 'fold-out', 'pack', 'first', 'season', 'Paramount', 'went', 'slim', 'CD', 'boxes', '6', 'CDs', 'time', 'around', 'stuck', 'slip', 'cover', 'least', 'are', ""n't"", 'double-sided', 'discs', 'guess', 'deluxe', 'set', 'combining', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'be', 'issued', 'sometime', 'near', 'future', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'see.For', 'such', 'short-lived', 'series', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'arguably', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'shows', 'television', 'history', 'reshaping', 'medium', 'turning', 'Lynch', 'used', 'death', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'portal', 'grainy', 'world', 'small', 'town', 'America', 'was', 'continuation', 'theme', 'set', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'agent', 'uncovering', 'hidden', 'nature', 'notorious', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'However', 'Lynch', 'wanted', 'leave', 'murder', 'hanging', 'air', 'ABC', 'wanted', 'resolve', 'apparently', 'so', 'did', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'suspense', 'carried', 'show', 'was', 'lost', 'never', 'be', 'recovered.While', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'tightly', 'wrought', '7', 'episodes', 'building', 'seamlessly', 'pilot', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'mixed', 'bag', 'characters', 'multiply', 'story', 'line', 'grow', 'ever', 'more', 'convoluted', 'guess', 'why', 'ABC', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'wrapped', 'up', 'show', 'got', 'completely', 'control', 'eeriness', 'remained', 'TP', 'came', 'personify', 'dark', 'part', 'small', 'town', 'consciousness', 'almost', 'community.You', 'loved', 'show', 'hated', 'were', 'few', 'persons', 'who', 'were', 'indifferent', 'pretty', 'good', 'indicator', 'impact', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'had', 'television', 'would', 'influence', 'so', 'many', 'dramas', 'even', 'comedies', 'followed', 'spawn', 'whole', 'range', 'stepchildren', 'HBO', 'Carnivale', 'Deadwood', 'where', 'directors', 'writers', 'could', 'more', 'freely', 'explore', 'dark', 'themes', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'Lynch', 'Frost', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'away', 'what', 'did', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'effective', 'tool', 'suspense', 'could', 'be', 'handled', 'deft', 'touch']",N/A

And, yes, it's definitely offbeat, but- contrary to many comments about the show- there's very little that's weird just for weirdness' sake.  ""Twin Peaks"" often felt weird and offbeat because it combined genres and plotlines not usually seen within one show (a typical episode would combine soap-opera romance, a serial killer, high comedy, Twilight Zone-style science fiction, a police drama, and horror), not because it was especially heavy with head-scratching moments.The first handful episodes here resolve the ""murder of Laura Palmer"" plotline from season one, and do so satisfyingly.  There are two ""peak"" shows (no pun intended) in this run of episodes: the one where viewers discover the identity of Laura's killer and the one where the characters in the show do.  Both episodes work, though there might have been more of a dramatic payoff if both of these things happened in one undiluted gangbusters episode.  But that's nitpicking.Then, in the wake of the Laura Palmer plotline, a second plotline slowly builds steam and soon is firing on all cylinders: the Windom Earle/""Black Lodge"" storyline.  Again, contrary to many opinions, I found this plotline to be just as involving as the Laura Palmer plotline, mainly due to the riveting sense of creepiness and dread, and Kenneth Welsh's great performance as the insane former FBI agent Windom Earle.  He's a great villain.But, to end on a bit of controversy, the David Lynch-directed final episode of season two may have been what did the show in, scaring network executives away from renewing ""Twin Peaks"" for a third season.  After a run of entertainingly offbeat episodes (weird but accessible), season two concluded with Lynch's extremely strange concoction of nightmare imagery, distorted audio, and complex symbolism, and- a decade and a half after it originally aired- you can still feel millions of viewers changing their channels.  Actually, I think it's a great episode, but they shouldn't have made it the last episode of the season.  If the producers had ended the season on a more traditionally user-friendly note, the show might have lasted another season or two.  And it also would have given the other characters a chance to comment on some of the Lynch episode's strangeness, which would have again demonstrated, I think, that David Lynch isn't as weird as people think.  There are very often mundane and easily digested explanations for Lynch's strangeness (at least in ""Twin Peaks""), but it sometimes took an episode or two for those explanations to come out.In the interest of full disclosure, however, the episode directed by Diane Keaton DOES contain truckloads of weirdness there for weirdness' sake, and is the only other episode where you can literally feel viewers heading for the hills.But let me end these musings on a positive note and reiterate what I said at the outset: unresolved cliffhangers notwithstanding, this is a terrific set of episodes.  Also, picture and sound are pristine, and there is a generous collection of interviews with the creative forces behind the show.Oh, and if you end up liking this set, be sure to pick up the theatrical film (available on DVD), ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"".  It's more of prequel to the ""Twin Peaks"" show than a continuation, but there are glimmers here and there that arguably shed light on at least some of the final fates of the characters seen in dire straits at the end of season two.",5,This influential show is still as bracing as a great cup of coffee,1185148800,"07 23, 2007",2007,3495,"['wonderfully', 'intriguing', 'entertaining', 'season', 'television', 'yes', 'definitely', 'offbeat', 'but-', 'contrary', 'many', 'comments', 'show-', 'very', 'little', 'weird', 'just', 'weirdness', 'sake', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'often', 'felt', 'weird', 'offbeat', 'combined', 'genres', 'plotlines', 'not', 'usually', 'seen', 'one', 'show', 'typical', 'episode', 'would', 'combine', 'soap-opera', 'romance', 'serial', 'killer', 'high', 'comedy', 'Twilight', 'Zone-style', 'science', 'fiction', 'police', 'drama', 'horror', 'not', 'was', 'especially', 'heavy', 'head-scratching', 'moments.The', 'first', 'handful', 'episodes', 'here', 'resolve', 'murder', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'plotline', 'season', 'one', 'do', 'so', 'satisfyingly', 'are', 'two', 'peak', 'shows', 'pun', 'intended', 'run', 'episodes', 'one', 'where', 'viewers', 'discover', 'identity', 'Laura', 'killer', 'one', 'where', 'characters', 'show', 'do', 'episodes', 'work', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'dramatic', 'payoff', 'things', 'happened', 'one', 'undiluted', 'gangbusters', 'episode', 'nitpicking.Then', 'wake', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'plotline', 'second', 'plotline', 'slowly', 'steam', 'soon', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'Windom', 'Earle/', 'Black', 'Lodge', 'storyline', 'Again', 'contrary', 'many', 'opinions', 'found', 'plotline', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'involving', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'plotline', 'mainly', 'due', 'riveting', 'sense', 'creepiness', 'dread', 'Kenneth', 'Welsh', 'great', 'performance', 'insane', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Windom', 'Earle', 'great', 'villain.But', 'end', 'bit', 'controversy', 'David', 'Lynch-directed', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'did', 'show', 'scaring', 'network', 'executives', 'away', 'renewing', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'third', 'season', 'run', 'entertainingly', 'offbeat', 'episodes', 'weird', 'accessible', 'season', 'two', 'concluded', 'Lynch', 'extremely', 'strange', 'concoction', 'nightmare', 'imagery', 'distorted', 'audio', 'complex', 'symbolism', 'and-', 'decade', 'half', 'originally', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'millions', 'viewers', 'changing', 'channels', 'Actually', 'think', 'great', 'episode', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'producers', 'had', 'ended', 'season', 'more', 'traditionally', 'user-friendly', 'note', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'lasted', 'season', 'two', 'also', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'other', 'characters', 'chance', 'comment', 'Lynch', 'episode', 'strangeness', 'would', 'have', 'again', 'demonstrated', 'think', 'David', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'as', 'weird', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'very', 'often', 'mundane', 'easily', 'digested', 'explanations', 'Lynch', 'strangeness', 'least', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'sometimes', 'took', 'episode', 'two', 'explanations', 'come', 'interest', 'full', 'disclosure', 'however', 'episode', 'directed', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'DOES', 'contain', 'truckloads', 'weirdness', 'weirdness', 'sake', 'only', 'other', 'episode', 'where', 'can', 'literally', 'feel', 'viewers', 'heading', 'hills.But', 'let', 'end', 'musings', 'positive', 'note', 'reiterate', 'what', 'said', 'outset', 'unresolved', 'cliffhangers', 'notwithstanding', 'terrific', 'set', 'episodes', 'Also', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'pristine', 'generous', 'collection', 'interviews', 'creative', 'forces', 'show.Oh', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'set', 'be', 'sure', 'pick', 'up', 'theatrical', 'film', 'available', 'DVD', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Fire', 'Walk', 'Me', 'more', 'prequel', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'show', 'continuation', 'are', 'glimmers', 'here', 'there', 'arguably', 'shed', 'light', 'least', 'final', 'fates', 'characters', 'seen', 'dire', 'straits', 'end', 'season', 'two']",N/A

1043160,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000M3439E,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","""Twin Peaks"" has been unfairly criticized for jumping the shark early. That's simply not true. Lynch and his films have never had easy resolutions. It's also clear that Lynch and Frost weren't exactly sure where they where going with the second season. the first season of the show with its mixture of surrealism, soap opera situations, suspense and melodrama caught on unexpectedly and created unrealistic expectations for the second.First up, the show looks great. Lynch went back and supervised the transfers and the colors are more accurate than on the first season set that came out from Aristan in 2001. We get all 22 second season episodes. We also get Log Lady introductions. We get a selection of interesting interviews with production staff including directors Caleb Deschanel, Tim Hunter, Stephen Gyllenhaal, Jennifer Lynch, Tim Holland and various cast members in an ""Interview Gird"".  Sadly, Lynch is absent but he always is for the home video presentations of his films so its not a surprise. That's OK as he is ably represented by the show itself. The show has a huge influence that impacted other shows like ""The X-Files"" (Duvochny's role as an FBI agent here and his casting in ""X-Files"" couldn't have been an accident and although he lacks the zen-like quality of McLaughlan)to even recent shows such as ""Lost"" and ""The Lost Room"". Interestingly, each of of these series has had problems with their resolution. As in magic it's not the set up per se that matters as much as bringing back the object that you made disappear. The longer the magic act the more difficult it is to pull it off. In retrospect although I don't like the way the second season ends (and would like to have a better more positive resolution as that's what was always hinted at to me in Agent Cooper's demeanor and approach), I'm not surprised it ended the way it did. A pity that Lynch didn't choose to do a movie sequel instead of a prequel. Perhaps with the popularity of this set and the impeding re-release of the first set (with yeah! the pilot)we'll see that happen. While I didn't like the end of the second season (and from what I recall both Lynch and Frost knew it wasn't coming back for a third), the show still is an enjoyable ride for fans. The way I imagine the series (which makes me feel a bit better about the conclusion of this show)is that all the events from the second season AFTER we find out who Laura's killer is was just...a dream (hey, it worked for ""Dallas"" and it makes the conclusion work a bit better for me).David Lynch's visually stunning compositions and the writing that he and Mark Frost concocted kept viewers on their toes with funny and often weird touches. When the second season premiered many critics (and fans to be fair) were frustrated with the slow resolution of the central mystery--who killed Laura Palmer and why? The slower resolution allowed the show to blossom with interesting side stories (where I'm sure J.J. Abrams got his idea for the approach for ""Lost""). That's not a surprise though since we had more than twice as many episodes as the short first season to cover much of the same ground.The only problem I had was that when it comes to the main page where you select previews (where an Easter egg for ""Inland Empire"" is located) or main menu it freezes before moving forward on its own (I assume that's because there are no previews since I didn't see any). It's an odd hiccup and I can only assume it's a flaw in the disc.The first episode of season two opens with Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) shot, bleeding and unconcious on the floor of room 315 of his hotel. After he recovers Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean) continue to unravel the mystery of Laura Palmer and other related mysteries. We also meet a cross dressing FBI agent (David Duvochny), a dwarf and giant along with the usual cast of bizarre characters during seson two. Frost, Lynch and the other writer/directors continue to mine the dry, deadpan humor that made this series work so well.If you don't have the first season, you may want to wait and see if the whole set will be available as I'm not sure if Paramount will be releasing the first season/pilot separately. Regardless, this groundbreaking series still works because of Lynch's weird, off-beat style, Frost's writing and the deadpan humor that the terrific cast gets to dish out.",4,Second season FINALLY appears and looks terrific,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,4380,"['Twin', 'Peaks', 'been', 'unfairly', 'criticized', 'jumping', 'shark', 'early', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'Lynch', 'films', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'easy', 'resolutions', 'also', 'clear', 'Lynch', 'Frost', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'where', 'where', 'going', 'second', 'season', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'mixture', 'surrealism', 'soap', 'opera', 'situations', 'suspense', 'melodrama', 'caught', 'unexpectedly', 'created', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'second.First', 'up', 'show', 'great', 'Lynch', 'went', 'back', 'supervised', 'transfers', 'colors', 'are', 'more', 'accurate', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'Aristan', '2001', 'get', '22', 'second', 'season', 'episodes', 'also', 'get', 'Log', 'Lady', 'introductions', 'get', 'selection', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'production', 'staff', 'including', 'directors', 'Caleb', 'Deschanel', 'Tim', 'Hunter', 'Stephen', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'Tim', 'Holland', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'Interview', 'Gird', 'Sadly', 'Lynch', 'absent', 'always', 'home', 'video', 'presentations', 'films', 'so', 'not', 'surprise', 'OK', 'ably', 'represented', 'show', 'show', 'huge', 'influence', 'impacted', 'other', 'shows', 'X-Files', 'Duvochny', 'role', 'FBI', 'agent', 'here', 'casting', 'X-Files', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'accident', 'zen-like', 'quality', 'McLaughlan', 'even', 'recent', 'shows', 'such', 'Lost', 'Lost', 'Room', 'Interestingly', 'series', 'had', 'problems', 'resolution', 'magic', 'not', 'set', 'up', 'se', 'as', 'much', 'bringing', 'back', 'object', 'made', 'disappear', 'longer', 'magic', 'act', 'more', 'difficult', 'pull', 'off', 'retrospect', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'second', 'season', 'ends', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'better', 'more', 'positive', 'resolution', 'what', 'was', 'always', 'hinted', 'Agent', 'Cooper', 'demeanor', 'approach', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'ended', 'way', 'did', 'pity', 'Lynch', 'did', ""n't"", 'choose', 'do', 'movie', 'sequel', 'instead', 'prequel', 'Perhaps', 'popularity', 'set', 'impeding', 're-release', 'first', 'set', 'yeah', 'pilot', ""'ll"", 'see', 'happen', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'second', 'season', 'what', 'recall', 'Lynch', 'Frost', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'coming', 'back', 'third', 'show', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'fans', 'way', 'imagine', 'series', 'feel', 'bit', 'better', 'conclusion', 'show', 'events', 'second', 'season', 'AFTER', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Laura', 'killer', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'hey', 'worked', 'Dallas', 'conclusion', 'work', 'bit', 'better', '.David', 'Lynch', 'visually', 'stunning', 'compositions', 'writing', 'Mark', 'Frost', 'concocted', 'kept', 'viewers', 'toes', 'funny', 'often', 'weird', 'touches', 'When', 'second', 'season', 'premiered', 'many', 'critics', 'fans', 'be', 'fair', 'were', 'frustrated', 'slow', 'resolution', 'central', 'mystery', 'who', 'killed', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'why', 'slower', 'resolution', 'allowed', 'show', 'blossom', 'interesting', 'side', 'stories', 'where', ""'m"", 'sure', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'got', 'idea', 'approach', 'Lost', 'not', 'surprise', 'had', 'more', 'twice', 'many', 'episodes', 'short', 'first', 'season', 'cover', 'much', 'same', 'ground.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'when', 'main', 'page', 'where', 'select', 'previews', 'where', 'Easter', 'egg', 'Inland', 'Empire', 'located', 'main', 'menu', 'moving', 'forward', 'own', 'assume', 'are', 'previews', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'odd', 'hiccup', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'flaw', 'disc.The', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'two', 'opens', 'Agent', 'Cooper', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'shot', 'bleeding', 'unconcious', 'floor', 'room', '315', 'hotel', 'Cooper', 'Sheriff', 'Harry', 'S.', 'Truman', 'Michael', 'Ontkean', 'continue', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'other', 'related', 'mysteries', 'also', 'meet', 'cross', 'dressing', 'FBI', 'agent', 'David', 'Duvochny', 'dwarf', 'giant', 'usual', 'cast', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'seson', 'two', 'Frost', 'Lynch', 'other', 'writer/directors', 'continue', 'mine', 'dry', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'made', 'series', 'work', 'so', 'well.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'first', 'season', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'see', 'whole', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'available', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Paramount', 'will', 'be', 'releasing', 'first', 'season/pilot', 'separately', 'Regardless', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'still', 'Lynch', 'weird', 'off-beat', 'style', 'Frost', 'writing', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'terrific', 'cast', 'dish', 'out']",N/A
