310270,A1UIUIOHOHHX2X,630238074X,"Charlotte Drobnicki ""jolliedd""","[1, 2]","I see shades of Viggo's recent movie: A History Of Violence in this movie Sean Penn wrote and directed. This compelling film brought out emotional, heart wrenching scenes that cause the same emotion in the viewer. We see the 'good brother' Joey (David Morse)--a peace officer, trying to help his deeply troubled, Vietnam vet brother Frank (Viggo Mortensen).On a personal note: Valeria Golino did a wonderful job in this movie as Joey's amazing, perfect wife.True to most of Viggo's movies in his pre-Aragorn days, here he is as a self-absorbed, heartless sleaze ball who cares basically for no one but himself. Whether it was the war or his feelings that life itself has played him a cruel hand, Frank cannot come to grips with the impulses and the rage in him. The murder scene and the bar scene both bring to memory: A History Of Violence. In this movie as well, he is more of a victim who victimizes everyone around him. One can almost feel his pain as he weeps over his father's death and later says 'sorry' to his brother for every heartache he has caused in the past. Still, later, one learns to hate him.I see Joey as this na&#65533;ve man who cannot see the warning signs in those hurting around him, like his father (Charles Bronson) who tries reaching out to Joey and then admits defeat and ends it. Nor can he succeed in helping Frank see the good side of life and all that it has to offer. Frank's poor wife Dorothy (Patricia Arquette) though, took the worst of Frank's sick behavior during his rages and ultimate abandonment of her. It seems that no one can get through to Frank who sees how life has been good to Joey--as he remarks how 'you got a kiss in and a- -, and I got prison.' Well, Frank, what did you expect? Bad boys get prison. Still, in the end it's the good brother who makes the ultimate sacrifice in this intense, gripping film.(Beware of nuttity and nudity)Vig, a message to you. You look HOT as a construction worker.  Just one question though, is this movie the one where you bonded with your old pal Dennis Hopper? Just wondering!

310279,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,630238074X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","It is a marvelous film for many reasons and it has many meaningful interpretations. The first we can think of is of course the effect of the Vietnam War on a normal man. It made him someone whose desire to kill, whose need to kill could never be controlled and dominated. Nothing could keep him within the limits of normalcy, that is to say a violence that is purely symbolical or superficial. His desire was not to punch a few noses and be done with it, but it was to kill, and I repeat that was a need for him to be satisfied in order to survive. The second line is that of the two brothers. One chose to be a cop and he killed legally. That's not in anyway easy, but at least you can come to terms with it: you saved your life from someone who wanted to kill you, and that was legal. You can wonder why he shot to kill, right in the heart, but he was entirely justified to shoot, so why not to kill? The other chose to go to Vietnam and there he killed but it was never to really save his life, never really justified because it was not self defense on his own turf but aggression in a foreign country, and the killing was not exactly shooting at combatants, but more often at women and children. This seems to prove that the desire to kill is in any man, good or bad, and that the only choice you have is to do it legally and morally or not. Vietnam produced twisted, distorted and completely warped personalities for whom killing had become a need, just like alcohol or smoking for others. This leads to a confrontation between the two brothers and the dilemma for the cop who has to arrest or shoot his own brother. He chose differently. The third line is metaphorical. The guilt the cop had built in himself after killing the young chap who was running away and then started to shoot at him can only come out, be retrieved and rehabilitated if in a way or another the need to kill is projected into someone else and that someone else is forced to go away. The guilt has to be entrusted to some Indian runner who will take it away as if it were a message he has to go dump in the ocean or the infinite. But this meaning is metaphorically symbolical of us all. We all have to get rid of this death instinct, and here comes the ending of the film. It is a dream society will let us go without making us pay for that death instinct. And the price is called guilt because we have to repress it and then it will go on lurking in our minds forever. There is no Indian runner for our death instinct, just a repressed guilt that may come out one day, but when and how no one knows.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,"Cop or veteran, guilt will not run away",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,2715,"['marvelous', 'film', 'many', 'reasons', 'many', 'meaningful', 'interpretations', 'first', 'can', 'think', 'course', 'effect', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'normal', 'man', 'made', 'someone', 'desire', 'kill', 'need', 'kill', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'controlled', 'dominated', 'Nothing', 'could', 'keep', 'limits', 'normalcy', 'say', 'violence', 'purely', 'symbolical', 'superficial', 'desire', 'was', 'not', 'punch', 'few', 'noses', 'be', 'done', 'was', 'kill', 'repeat', 'was', 'need', 'be', 'satisfied', 'order', 'survive', 'second', 'line', 'two', 'brothers', 'One', 'chose', 'be', 'cop', 'killed', 'legally', 'not', 'anyway', 'easy', 'least', 'can', 'come', 'terms', 'saved', 'life', 'someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'kill', 'was', 'legal', 'can', 'wonder', 'why', 'shot', 'kill', 'right', 'heart', 'was', 'entirely', 'justified', 'shoot', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'kill', 'other', 'chose', 'go', 'Vietnam', 'there', 'killed', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'save', 'life', 'never', 'really', 'justified', 'was', 'not', 'self', 'defense', 'own', 'turf', 'aggression', 'foreign', 'country', 'killing', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'shooting', 'combatants', 'more', 'often', 'women', 'children', 'prove', 'desire', 'kill', 'man', 'good', 'bad', 'only', 'choice', 'have', 'do', 'legally', 'morally', 'not', 'Vietnam', 'produced', 'twisted', 'distorted', 'completely', 'warped', 'personalities', 'whom', 'killing', 'had', 'become', 'need', 'just', 'alcohol', 'smoking', 'others', 'confrontation', 'two', 'brothers', 'dilemma', 'cop', 'who', 'arrest', 'shoot', 'own', 'brother', 'chose', 'differently', 'third', 'line', 'metaphorical', 'guilt', 'cop', 'had', 'built', 'killing', 'young', 'chap', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'then', 'started', 'shoot', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'out', 'be', 'retrieved', 'rehabilitated', 'way', 'need', 'kill', 'projected', 'someone', 'else', 'someone', 'else', 'forced', 'go', 'away', 'guilt', 'be', 'entrusted', 'Indian', 'runner', 'who', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'were', 'message', 'go', 'dump', 'ocean', 'infinite', 'meaning', 'metaphorically', 'symbolical', 'have', 'get', 'rid', 'death', 'instinct', 'here', 'ending', 'film', 'dream', 'society', 'will', 'let', 'go', 'making', 'pay', 'death', 'instinct', 'price', 'called', 'guilt', 'have', 'repress', 'then', 'will', 'go', 'lurking', 'minds', 'forever', 'Indian', 'runner', 'death', 'instinct', 'just', 'repressed', 'guilt', 'may', 'come', 'out', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'how', 'one', 'knows.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Indian Runner VHS
310280,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,630238074X,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[68, 69]","I once heard Sean Penn's film referred to as &quot;Method movies,&quot; and I can't think of any better description.  Though having only released (as of this writing) three films, Penn has created a style that is as distinct and indentifiable as his own idiosyncratic performances as an actor.  Penn's films take place in a gray area that is rarely visited by Hollywood films today -- a rather grim place where the action moves slowly and where the images are rarely happy but somehow remain impossible to look away from.  These aren't the type of films that make money or draw huge weekend crowds but they are the films that people will still be watching decades from now.  The first of these films was the flawed but still compelling Indian Runner, which tells the tragic story of Viggo Mortensen, an unstable vet who returns home and, despite the best efforts of his peace-maker brother David Morse, continues to spin out of control.Obviously, this is not a happy film but it is still surprisingly touching and that's largely because of the cast -- the majority of whom have never been better and for that, I give full credit to director Penn.  While its obvious, at times, that he still has a bit to learn about pacing, it is also obvious that Penn knows how to get great performances out of his actors.  Mortensen, playing a role that could have easily become a flat villian, is quite simply amazing.  Even as it becomes clear that this is not someone you'd feel safe living next to, the viewer still can't help but feel an amazing empathy for this fractured human being.  Penn, as director and writer, is actually willing to take the time to allow Mortensen to become a real, flawed human being.  David Morse, always underrated, is much more low-key than Mortensen but no less compelling.  He makes his love for his brother both believable and real and it adds a truly tragic air to his efforts to protect Mortensen.  However, for me, the film's most shocking revelation is Charles Bronson, cast here as Mortensen and Morse's father.  After several decades worth of films where Bronson was basically a blank slate, Bronson is a revelation here.  As the father, Bronson becomes a tragic, haunting father and -- and here's the shocking part for those of us who have seen the Death Wish films -- is actually believably human and vulnerable. His final emotional scene is heart breaking -- largely because of Bronson's own performance.As I said before, this is a flawed film -- mostly in terms of pace.  Sometimes, Penn does seem to be insecure about his directorial and writing choices -- as if he's straining to make sure no one misses the point.  But these flaws are honestly just nitpicking.

I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas.

Boullosa,"[4, 5]","This fine movie probably didn't get as much attention as it merited because of its bleakness and because it represented Penn's earliest work as a director.  It is much like watching the proverbial train wreck: devastating but irresistible.  However, it is worth enduring the pain for at least one viewing, which will leave a lasting impression.  It can be a bit slow in places but is well-written, superbly acted, and beautifully photographed.Mortensen is absolutely wonderful, both repulsive and heart-breaking as the hopelessly destructive younger of two brothers who have gone separate ways after growing up on a family farm in Wisconsin. After the farm fails and must be sold, the older brother, well-played in an understated performance by David Morse, goes into law enforcement, marries a woman he adores, and forges a contented family life with her and their baby son.  When the younger brother comes back into their midst, fresh from the military and a stint in prison resulting from explosions of his inexplicably violent temperament, the older brother has to determine at what point he stops trying to save his angry sibling from himself.  The entire cast is fine - a young Patricia Arquette as Mortensen's love is deeply touching.  Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis appear briefly as the brothers' parents.  While the film's story centers on the struggle between the two brothers, the mysterious inexorability of character is its underlying theme.  The narrative and character development stand on their own, however, to suggest the deeper theme.  A sad but memorable film, and kudos to Penn and his cast for making this film - it was obviously a labor of love.",4,The train wreck you can't look away from,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1671,"['fine', 'movie', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'merited', 'bleakness', 'represented', 'Penn', 'earliest', 'work', 'director', 'much', 'watching', 'proverbial', 'train', 'wreck', 'devastating', 'irresistible', 'However', 'worth', 'enduring', 'pain', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'will', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'places', 'well-written', 'superbly', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'photographed.Mortensen', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'repulsive', 'heart-breaking', 'hopelessly', 'destructive', 'younger', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'separate', 'ways', 'growing', 'up', 'family', 'farm', 'Wisconsin', 'farm', 'fails', 'must', 'be', 'sold', 'older', 'brother', 'well-played', 'understated', 'performance', 'David', 'Morse', 'law', 'enforcement', 'woman', 'contented', 'family', 'life', 'baby', 'son', 'When', 'younger', 'brother', 'back', 'midst', 'fresh', 'military', 'stint', 'prison', 'resulting', 'explosions', 'inexplicably', 'violent', 'temperament', 'older', 'brother', 'determine', 'what', 'point', 'trying', 'save', 'angry', 'sibling', 'entire', 'cast', 'fine', 'young', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'Mortensen', 'love', 'deeply', 'touching', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'appear', 'briefly', 'brothers', 'parents', 'film', 'story', 'centers', 'struggle', 'two', 'brothers', 'mysterious', 'inexorability', 'character', 'underlying', 'theme', 'narrative', 'character', 'development', 'stand', 'own', 'however', 'suggest', 'deeper', 'theme', 'sad', 'memorable', 'film', 'kudos', 'Penn', 'cast', 'making', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'labor', 'love']",Indian Runner VHS
310284,A2T049UQONS0OY,630238074X,Larry VanDeSande,"[14, 15]","Viggo Mortensen is outstanding in this character study of brothers reuniting amidst great troubles in their personal lives. Sean Penn wrote and directed this film, his first effort in that respect, and came away with a solid effort that has all the fingerprints of his Academy Award-winning effort ""Mystic River"".Mortensen plays the ""bad"" brother to ""good"" brother Don Morse in this slice of life set in rural working class America. The film also stars Charles Bronson, who is cast against type as an aging parent, Sandy Dennis and a very young Benicio Del Toro.It is an unflinching, honest, truthful, gritty and utterly realistic view of a family that is coming apart and simultaneously being held together by the strong grip of the good brother Morse, who is something of a latter day Bobby Ewing cast against bad brother J.R. Ewing in an unstated Midwest locale about 1968.This movie can move slowly but is also variably gripping, entertaining, revolting and satisfying. It is emotional and carries great depth in the multilayered view of its characters, all of whom mimic real life people far more than in most movies, where the characters are often idiots acting out IQs of 6.Not in this film, a first time triumph from writer-director Penn. Based on the type of character Penn has portrayed most of his career, I think there must be something of Penn's upbringing in this real world study of people, their interactions, their wanting to do the right thing while being unable to do so, and their sometimes futile efforts to hold on to the good things in life while all around them in crumbling.The film ends in typical disarray and with an unsentimental message about people, their place in the world, and optimism. This is a very worthy film for people that want to see realism on the big or little screen.A caveat: This is adult fare and not for children.
