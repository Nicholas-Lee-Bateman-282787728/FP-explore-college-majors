With Diagnosis Murder you have the added pleasure of several of his relatives portraying characters as well.  I had gotten the first five years when they were offered individually.  When the chance came to get the entire series including the movies, in one box I took it.  My only regret is that the made for TV movies weren't put on the season disks in order.  It was sort of confusing to jump from the first movies with Scott Baio to the others with Charlie Schlatter as the resident doctor.  Also, some of the later shows didn't include Drs. Bentley and Travis in the plots which took away from the show slightly.

I also thought the quality of the videos were very good, given that the original material was videotaped rather than film. Packaging (cases and shelfbox) was actually quite good for safe long-term storage and use -- a world better than the old brittle-case packaging of a couple years ago.My PROBLEM was that several discs froze up at specific points of playback in just the first several discs.  I checked ahead and found a few more duds.  That irritates me since brand-new, spotless DVD's are usually very reliable stuff.  I should mention that I have 3 Blu-Ray/DVD players (2 Panasonics and a Sony) bought within the last year and all have up-to-date software, and each player had the same problems with the same dud discs.

1668688,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B00ET6LPRI,Love Our Military Men,"[34, 35]","The wait is finally over!It has been nearly six long years since the release of season three of Diagnosis: Murder when for unknown reasons the series was abandoned and for all intense and purposes was thought to have disappeared into oblivion - that is until now! The long anticipated DIAGNOSIS: MURDER COMPLETE COLLECTION has now been given a street date of November 12, 2013. For fans of the series which starred Emmy award winner Dick Van Dyke as ""Dr. Mark Sloan"", Chief of Internal Medicine at Community General  - this is nothing short of wonderful news. The series, which ran for eight years, and also starred Dick Van Dyke's real life son (a very good looking) Barry Van Dyke as Lt. Detective ""Steve Sloan"" enjoyed a 'Murder She Wrote' style with quality family friendly scripting as well as nice weekly rotation of guest stars that kept loyal viewers of the show coming back for more.Anyone who has followed Dick Van Dyke's illustrious career, which spans six decades, knows just how talented this man truly is, and appreciates his gifts and his versatility as a character actor. The series also enjoyed additional subplots, with fellow employees at the hospital (who worked closely with Dr. Sloan) getting caught up in the drama of the mysteries and murders that Dr. Sloan was working to resolve. Among them were: Victoria Rowell as ""Dr. Amanda Bently-Livingston"", Charlie Schlatter as ""Dr. Jesse Travis"", Scott Baio as ""Dr. Jack Stewart"", Michael Tucci as ""Norman Briggs"" and early in the series, Delores Hall as nurse ""Delores Mitchell"".For the faithful 'armchair detective' - the series showcased many exceptional episodes highlighting the talents of Dick Van Dyke. One of them, early in the series (Season one, episode four) which aired on 11/19/93 was titled ""INHERITANCE OF DEATH"". After being told by ""Mr. Briggs"" (Michael Tucci)that he had crunched the numbers on Sloan's patient remittent status and that the patient-to-services ratio is running less than 60%, Dr. Sloan informs him that his second cousin (once removed), ""Jonathon Nash"" of Nash Wine Distributing is leaving his entire estate to Community General to the tune of fifteen million - which rings 'sweet' to Briggs ears. When the 93-year-old Jonathon Nash goes down a flight of stairs in an electric wheelchair and is killed, there are many questions surrounding his death, and as to be expected - ALL the siblings are suspect and masterfully played by Dick Van Dyke! His ability to successfully play multiple roles in one episode is reminiscent of his multiple role talents in Mary Poppins back in 1964.Having recently purchased the individual releases of seasons four and five as 'samplers' to see what we can look forward to where picture quality is concerned in this complete series release, I can report that the picture quality is quite good! I have waited a l-o-n-g time for the completion of this series and I will be one happy camper on November 12. As Dick Van Dyke's character says: ""Tell the truth, but never take away hope!"" - AMEN.Bonus Features (according to (...) will include:*The original pilot episode where Dr. Sloan makes his first appearance on TV from ""Jake and the Fatman"", through which the series became a spin-off.*The 3 original TV pilot movies*The 2 reunion TV films*A bonus episode of the beloved detective series, ""Mannix""*A bonus clip from Season 5, where Dr. Mark Sloan meets Rob Petrie from ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", in the episode, ""Obsession Pt. II""Enjoy this nice slice of nostalgic entertainment - it's a perfect prescription for fans!

So I went in sort of &#8220;blind&#8221; and did like what I saw. For some unknown reason, VEI provided journalists with just one single disc &#8211; Disc 3 &#8211; from the set &#8211; that included four full 47-minute episodes (commercials have been excised). Though the huge box includes the three  TV pilot episodes and the two &#8220;reunion&#8221; shows &#8211; plus &#8211; strangely &#8211; a sample episode of the totally unrelated series, &#8220;Mannix&#8221;, none of these were available to sample or screen. So I can&#8217;t comment on more than the four episodes (all from one of the eight seasons.I do have to say that the clothing on some of the actors sure looks outdated so quickly but the thing I found most interesting in the &#8220;time warp&#8221; was the advancement in technology. When one character needs to be contacted by his office, he receives an alert on his &#8220;beeping pager&#8221; (remember those?) and has to ask the folks in the office he is in if he can use their land-line phone! My we have advanced! None of this will affect the enjoyment of the series; just sharing my observation.Based on the four episodes I was able to see (again, all in one season) the images are sharp and crisp. (I&#8217;m guessing these are same from the CBS Home Video releases, which VEI acquired).I&#8217;m also surprised &#8211; as apparently other reviewers here are &#8211; that the price on Amazon is significantly different from VEI&#8217;s direct sale price. But I&#8217;ve learned over the years that Amazon&#8217;s price does fluctuate, and the units they are selling do come from VEI.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful (well, as much as I had to work with)Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",4,Review of this HUGE box based on one &#8220;Sample&#8221; disc,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2001,"['have', 'admit', 'never', 'watched', 'show', '8211', 'starring', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'son', 'even', 'grandson', '8211', 'aired', 'CBS', '1993-2001', '8211', 'received', 'press', 'screener', 'VEI', 'company', 'releasing', 'huge', 'box', 'set', 'went', 'sort', '8220', '8221', 'did', 'what', 'saw', 'unknown', 'reason', 'VEI', 'provided', 'journalists', 'just', 'one', 'single', 'disc', '8211', 'Disc', '3', '8211', 'set', '8211', 'included', 'four', 'full', '47-minute', 'episodes', 'commercials', 'have', 'been', 'excised', 'huge', 'box', 'three', 'TV', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'two', '8220', 'reunion', '8221', '8211', '8211', 'strangely', '8211', 'sample', 'episode', 'totally', 'unrelated', 'series', '8220', 'Mannix', '8221', 'none', 'were', 'available', 'sample', 'screen', 'can', '8217', 't', 'comment', 'more', 'four', 'episodes', 'one', 'eight', 'seasons.I', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'clothing', 'actors', 'sure', 'looks', 'outdated', 'so', 'quickly', 'thing', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', '8220', 'time', 'warp', '8221', 'was', 'advancement', 'technology', 'When', 'one', 'character', 'be', 'contacted', 'office', 'alert', '8220', 'beeping', 'pager', '8221', 'remember', 'ask', 'folks', 'office', 'can', 'use', 'land-line', 'phone', 'have', 'advanced', 'None', 'will', 'affect', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'just', 'sharing', 'observation.Based', 'four', 'episodes', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'again', 'one', 'season', 'images', 'are', 'sharp', 'crisp', '8217', 'guessing', 'are', 'same', 'CBS', 'Home', 'Video', 'releases', 'VEI', 'acquired', '.I', '8217', 'm', 'also', 'surprised', '8211', 'apparently', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'are', '8211', 'price', 'Amazon', 'significantly', 'different', 'VEI', '8217', 'direct', 'sale', 'price', '8217', 've', 'learned', 'years', 'Amazon', '8217', 's', 'price', 'fluctuate', 'units', 'are', 'selling', 'do', 'come', 'VEI.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'had', 'work', 'Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",Diagnosis Murder:Complete
