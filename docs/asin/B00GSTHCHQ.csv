1681397,A2DQ53HN179E1N,B00GSTHCHQ,"Aussie ""Rocket""","[0, 0]","I loved this series in the 80s, especially since Furillo completely matched my Dad's integrity as he was also in a stressful job dealing with political idiots and opportunists and didn't stand for people doing the wrong thing but at the same time he was compassionate and respected by everyone.The quality is quite good, the same as the original Fox release of Seasons 1 and 2 and the iTunes 1-3. There are one or two episodes in the final season that have a warning at the front that says 'mastered from the best available sources' however the quality on a 92 inch projection screen was very good, probably just ever so slightly less definition than the other episodes with the slightest ghosting on the edge of the pillar box.On a 40-50 inch plasma or LCD I doubt you'd notice the difference. For some reason though, the same as broadcast episodes the opening titles in Season 6 look as though they used a really old version of the film stock, don't know why, perhaps there was a reason for it at the time but I remember it having a very slightly different tone in the opening music during one of the seasons when I watched it in 1986 and that must have been it - perhaps only a couple of seasons before the end they were looking to re-use some bits that no one would necessarily notice and it's probably only noticeable now because of the HD capability of modern equipment. I watched the entire series again as alluded to above on a 92 inch screen from a Marantz DV9500 DVD Player (top of the range at the time of purchase and upscaling to 720p), the projector is 1080p and I thought it was fine - only comment would be it's obviously from whatever studio masters they had access to and unlike internet downloads there are NO scenes missing, all complete.All in all a fantastic package.I remember LOTS of Entertainment Tonight segments and spots on HSB when it was on the air, pity they couldn't get hold of that old footage for special features but what there is are very good.I am rapt with this, been waiting since the 90s for this and thanks to Shout Factory for doing it, brickbats to Fox for being useless curmudgeons and not remastering it for Bluray, it certainly deserves it considering its place as a paradigm shifting series in TV history. It holds up extremely well today because it pioneered everything used in current quality TV - ensemble cast, handheld camera work, gritty realism (the police cars were beaten up and dirty unlike any police show before it), going from one moment of laughter or reflection to gunshots going off and death unexpectedly. I remember how shocking that was in 1981-87 and how at the time it was 'West Wing-like' and totally the most intelligent, most exceptionally well written and produced show on TV. The scripts were required reading in classes at Universities.",5,Excellent,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2811,"['loved', 'series', '80s', 'especially', 'Furillo', 'completely', 'matched', 'Dad', 'integrity', 'was', 'also', 'stressful', 'job', 'dealing', 'political', 'idiots', 'opportunists', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'people', 'doing', 'wrong', 'thing', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'compassionate', 'respected', 'everyone.The', 'quality', 'quite', 'good', 'same', 'original', 'Fox', 'release', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'iTunes', '1-3', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'have', 'warning', 'front', ""'mastered"", 'best', 'available', 'sources', 'however', 'quality', '92', 'inch', 'projection', 'screen', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'probably', 'just', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'less', 'definition', 'other', 'episodes', 'slightest', 'ghosting', 'edge', 'pillar', 'box.On', '40-50', 'inch', 'plasma', 'LCD', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'notice', 'difference', 'reason', 'same', 'broadcast', 'opening', 'titles', 'Season', '6', 'look', 'used', 'really', 'old', 'version', 'film', 'stock', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'perhaps', 'was', 'reason', 'time', 'remember', 'having', 'very', 'slightly', 'different', 'tone', 'opening', 'music', 'one', 'seasons', 'when', 'watched', '1986', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'perhaps', 'only', 'couple', 'seasons', 'end', 'were', 'looking', 're-use', 'bits', 'one', 'would', 'necessarily', 'notice', 'probably', 'only', 'noticeable', 'now', 'HD', 'capability', 'modern', 'equipment', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'again', 'alluded', 'above', '92', 'inch', 'screen', 'Marantz', 'DV9500', 'DVD', 'Player', 'top', 'range', 'time', 'purchase', 'upscaling', '720p', 'projector', '1080p', 'thought', 'was', 'fine', 'only', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'obviously', 'studio', 'masters', 'had', 'access', 'internet', 'downloads', 'are', 'NO', 'scenes', 'missing', 'complete.All', 'fantastic', 'package.I', 'remember', 'LOTS', 'Entertainment', 'Tonight', 'segments', 'spots', 'HSB', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'pity', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'hold', 'old', 'footage', 'special', 'features', 'what', 'are', 'very', 'good.I', 'am', 'rapt', 'been', 'waiting', '90s', 'thanks', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'doing', 'Fox', 'being', 'useless', 'curmudgeons', 'not', 'remastering', 'Bluray', 'certainly', 'considering', 'place', 'paradigm', 'shifting', 'series', 'TV', 'history', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'today', 'pioneered', 'everything', 'used', 'current', 'quality', 'TV', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'gritty', 'realism', 'police', 'cars', 'were', 'beaten', 'up', 'dirty', 'police', 'show', 'going', 'one', 'moment', 'laughter', 'reflection', 'gunshots', 'going', 'death', 'unexpectedly', 'remember', 'how', 'shocking', 'was', '1981-87', 'how', 'time', 'was', ""'West"", 'Wing-like', 'totally', 'most', 'intelligent', 'most', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'written', 'produced', 'show', 'TV', 'scripts', 'were', 'required', 'reading', 'classes', 'Universities']",Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series

1681405,A1UPTW1ZN3ZXLX,B00GSTHCHQ,"D. Weinstein ""Wordy D""","[127, 134]","Previously, a box set of seasons 1 & 2 were available.  The first box set had a few cool extras - the second box I don't believe had any.  The third season was available on ITUNES and HULU and such places (AMAZON AS WELL) as digital only downloads.  The entire series has been circulating around bootleg in crudely cut and shoddy looking VHS style visuals along with every ep having been cut for VIOLENCE and LANGUAGE??????  I don't know where these copies came from but without an official release one was forced to deal with them.  The proper release of the greatest cop show of its time and maybe ALL TIME, all 7 seasons - one would HOPE that they would restore the (PREVIOUSLY ON HILL STREET BLUES) which were absent completely on the previous releases - and maybe, just maybe - we'll finally get the HILL STREET set we've been waiting for for all these years - I'm not going to pretend that this will have interviews with Bochco, Milch, Lewis, Franz, etc - I'm sure it will be bare-bones.  That said - the price is not cheap, so maybe this really will be a lush restoration.  But I'd be quite happy with crystal clear versions of all 7 seasons with the previously-on tags as well.  PRAYING THIS IS REAL!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT: I will discuss most (not all) of the aspects of the new box set here.  If you want to be surprised, stop reading until after you open the set.  I'm very explicit here as to what is contained in the box.UPDATE: I now have the 2014 NEW DVD SHOUT FACTORY SET of HILL STREET BLUES: The Complete Series.  Without ""spoilers,"" allow me to say that this is THE REAL THING.  If you've been waiting for a real presentation of this great series for 20/30 years - look no more.  This is a very handsomely housed set of discs comprising all 7 seasons of the great show.  The episodes look almost remastered and new - these appear to be struck from new prints or at the very least, the person who did the transferes clearly cared.  They eps look like a million dollars and it's jarring to see the show look this good again.  The episodes are easy and consise.  Everything is outlined and marked beautifuly and it's a very intuitive set.  That said - there are 4 commentaries - I've not yet heard them nor compared them to the original DVD set of the first 2 seasons, so I don't know if they are carryovers or not.BURNING QUESTION: Do these contain ""previously on Hill Street Blues?""  The answer is YES.  In some cases as I did a very quick browse, you also get ""and tonight, on Hill Street Blues"" - as for me at that point I just hit the NEXT button which takes you into the top of roll call screen.  These eps have NEVER looked and sounded this good (picture is original TV ratio and sound is an unusually clear 2.0).BONUS FEATURES:Again, while I don't want to spoil, the extras are mostly contained to one disc (except the commentaries) and are quite great.  There are a bunch of interviews with actors, writers and other creatives involved in the show (It's a real bounty of extras although I have yet to sit and watch them.  But just to wet your apetite, Dennis Franz does an interview explaining the differences between Buntz and Bennedetto.)The gag reel is super short and probably could've been included in other material, and I was secretly hoping for commentaries on the final episodes, etc - from the likes of present-day David Milch - there are no later-season commentaries as far as I could tell - just four from the first 2/3 seasons.At the forefront of the extras is a massive making of HSB documentary (it's in two parts - both run together for over 2 hours I think - all modern (2013) interviews from everyone involved.To sum up, this is the holy grail and as good as it's going to get.  Every episode presented in a stellar manner and in the best audio/video it's ever been in since broadcast, completely UNCUT (a bunch of renegade bootlegs have been making the rounds that are cut for language and violence - these episodes are completely uncut with all the original music and act breaks.  The bootlegs look like crap recorded from a VCR situation - these are a studio-quality older series reference point on how to present an older show and make it look great.Again, this is what we've always wanted.  All the ""previously ons, all the uncut eps, and perfect audio/video with a whole disc of amazing and fun and current extras.Bravo, Shout Factory!  HILL STREET BLUES is alive and better than ever thanks to you!If you are on the fence about buying these - don't be.  They are NOTHING for the price - all 7 seasons in pristine form with extras in a beautiful sturdy box?

The plots as relevant today, as they were back in 1981, and the show still feels as modern as it did when it first aired. Without HILL STREET BLUES, there would be no N.Y.P.D. BLUE, CAGNEY AND LACEY, or any of the other modern US police/crime shows we all now enjoy.

(I'd rather they had limited the number of episodes to four per disc at the most, whereas some discs contain five x 52-minute episodes!) However, unless you're watching this on a gigantic plasma, you are unlikely to notice any major problems with vision or sound.

They do exist, and are often featured on broadcasted episodes and were included on the censored UK Region 2 DVD's, so why Shout Factory didn't include all of them, I don't know. It's not a deal-breaker, but it would have been nice to have all of them, especially when fans may want to have a reminder of some of the longer story arcs that occur, that they may have forgotten about. Ditto with the ""Tonight on..."" segments. Some episodes have them, some don't.The only real complaint, for me, is the Gag Reel. It lasts just 35 seconds! That's right, a little over half-of-one-minute! It's not even particularly funny, nor do you really get to see anything of any real value. It's essentially three of the main cast flubbing their lines a little. As a bit of TV history, it's fun. As a DVD extra, it's pretty redundant. With that said, I do appreciate Shout Factory for including it. Just don't expect to find anything to laugh at.The other reason I wanted to post this, is as a notification to non-US customers! If you don't own a multi-region DVD player, then you may not be able to play all the discs. For reasons unknown, the outside of the box states this set to be Region 1. This is not technically the case though.Seasons 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are all Region 0. However, Seasons 2 and 7 are both Region 1-locked! As is the Bonus DVD Disc, containing most of the Extras!The extras last around 2hrs 40 minutes in total. There's a two part, hour-long featurette on how HILL STREET BLUES came into being, with some of the main cast featuring, though sadly nothing from leads Daniel J Travanti and Betty Thomas! (Major omissions in my view!) Then theres a Q&A; discussion session, taped from a few years back, which runs for about 45 minutes, which is fun. Alas, sometimes it's hard to pick-out what is being said, as the cast tend to talk over one another a fair bit. However, it is interesting hearing what they thought of the show and their characters, so many years after it had ended.All-in-all, this is a solid set. Not quite perfect, but for the money and effort, it's still a very worthwhile purchase! If you can't get the Australian set, then this is the only other option available, and until someone comes along, and offers us a better release, this release will more than suffice!",5,A Fantastic Release Of A Fantastic Series!,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,3302,"['show', 'brilliant', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'rhapsodise', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'superbly', 'written', 'acted', 'plots', 'relevant', 'today', 'were', 'back', '1981', 'show', 'still', 'as', 'modern', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUES', 'would', 'be', 'N.Y.P.D', 'BLUE', 'CAGNEY', 'AND', 'LACEY', 'other', 'modern', 'US', 'police/crime', 'now', 'enjoy', 'really', 'was', 'truly', 'genre-defining', 'piece', 'television', 'Most', 'discs', 'contain', 'three', 'four-hours', 'material', 'do', 'push', 'envelope', 'terms', 'picture', 'quality', ""'d"", 'rather', 'had', 'limited', 'number', 'episodes', 'four', 'disc', 'most', 'whereas', 'discs', 'contain', 'five', 'x', '52-minute', 'episodes', 'However', ""'re"", 'watching', 'gigantic', 'plasma', 'are', 'unlikely', 'notice', 'major', 'problems', 'vision', 'sound', 'picture', 'nice', 'stable', 'clean', 'clear', 'show', 'vintage', ""n't"", 'always', 'Previously', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUES', 'episode', 'recaps', 'episodes', 'have', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'exist', 'are', 'often', 'featured', 'broadcasted', 'episodes', 'were', 'included', 'censored', 'UK', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'so', 'why', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'deal-breaker', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'especially', 'when', 'fans', 'may', 'want', 'have', 'reminder', 'longer', 'story', 'arcs', 'occur', 'may', 'have', 'forgotten', 'Ditto', 'Tonight', 'segments', 'episodes', 'have', ""don't.The"", 'only', 'real', 'complaint', 'Gag', 'Reel', 'just', '35', 'seconds', 'right', 'little', 'half-of-one-minute', 'not', 'even', 'particularly', 'funny', 'do', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'anything', 'real', 'value', 'essentially', 'three', 'main', 'cast', 'flubbing', 'lines', 'little', 'bit', 'TV', 'history', 'fun', 'DVD', 'extra', 'pretty', 'redundant', 'said', 'do', 'appreciate', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'including', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'anything', 'at.The', 'other', 'reason', 'wanted', 'post', 'notification', 'non-US', 'customers', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'discs', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'outside', 'box', 'set', 'be', 'Region', '1', 'not', 'technically', 'case', '1', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'are', 'Region', '0', 'However', 'Seasons', '2', '7', 'are', 'Region', '1-locked', 'Bonus', 'DVD', 'Disc', 'containing', 'most', 'Extras', 'extras', 'last', '2hrs', '40', 'minutes', 'total', 'two', 'part', 'hour-long', 'featurette', 'how', 'HILL', 'STREET', 'BLUES', 'came', 'being', 'main', 'cast', 'featuring', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'Daniel', 'J', 'Travanti', 'Betty', 'Thomas', 'Major', 'omissions', 'view', 'Then', 'Q', 'A', 'discussion', 'session', 'taped', 'few', 'years', 'back', '45', 'minutes', 'fun', 'Alas', 'hard', 'pick-out', 'what', 'being', 'said', 'cast', 'tend', 'talk', 'one', 'fair', 'bit', 'However', 'interesting', 'hearing', 'what', 'thought', 'show', 'characters', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'had', 'ended.All-in-all', 'solid', 'set', 'Not', 'quite', 'perfect', 'money', 'effort', 'still', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Australian', 'set', 'then', 'only', 'other', 'option', 'available', 'someone', 'along', 'better', 'release', 'release', 'will', 'more', 'suffice']",Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series
