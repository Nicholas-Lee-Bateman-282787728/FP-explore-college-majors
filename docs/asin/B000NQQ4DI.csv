1059606,ANQHNP4M6SH1N,B000NQQ4DI,Abigail1851,"[0, 0]","A modernized version of the old tale with Robin and his men dressed in what could be t-shirts and jeans. Robin is rougish and sly, always able to thwart the sheriff  and Guy of Gisborn. The sheriff is evil and manipulative, leaving Sir Guy to carry out the evil deeds on the villagers. As played by Richard Armitage, Sir Guy is sinister, cruel, menacing and violent, committing violence and murder, while trying to establish a relationship with Marian, who is repelled by him and ambivalent about Robin. There is lots of violence including cutting out of tongues, breaking of legs, torture and murder. The episodes move quickly with chases, escapes,  and confrontaions.

1059609,A20MXB65JKHMNC,B000NQQ4DI,Amazon Customer,"[1, 3]","This is Robin Hood for a new generation; if you're looking for historical accuracy, or adhesion to the classic story, look elsewhere. That being said, BBC has done an awesome job of reimagining the story, with very modern sensibilities (and a little bit of political commentary, if you squint and are in the mood for such things).The best thing about this show is the characters; unlike most other incarnations, the spotlight is turned often to relatively minor characters, and the main characters are much more realistic. Robin is hardly the perfect hero he's portrayed as in other versions; he's vain, reckless, and arrogant, and has a tendency to be a little too self-sacrificing (the word `martyr' comes to mind). What's more, he can be more ruthless than his compatriots are necessarily comfortable with one minute, and squeamish when it comes to killing anyone the next. He's liable to start obsessing over something so much that little else matters to him (in one episode he's so fixated on a revelation about Gisborne's role in the injury that sent him back to England in the first place that he refuses to help the gang save Djaq from the Sheriff, and at the prospect of losing Marian to Gisborne, he sits in the forest and sulks while his men help Marian's father try to save the king from one of the Sheriff's plots).Marian is no damsel in distress (especially when we find out what she does at night) and has her own issues to work out concerning her feelings for Robin and Gisborne and where she really belongs in the world, not to mention her father's mollycoddling. She yearns for independence and escape from both the irritatingly single-minded Gisborne and her overbearing father (in one episode, she remarks to Robin that she is tired of people-""and it is always men!""-telling her what was the wise course of action).The Sheriff is even more cruel, devious and scathing than ever (comic villainy at it's very best), and is a man of thought, rather than action (in his character bio on BBC's website, his ""weapon"" is Gisborne). Also, you kind of have to feel sorry for Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's menacing (but rather bumbling), power-hungry second-in-command, who is honestly in love with Marian but a little shaky on what to do about it. He's further hindered by a nasty temper, some homicidal tendencies and an almost bipolar personality.Robin's gang are much more than just his private army, as they have seemed in past incarnations; Much, Robin's former manservant and forever hungry, wisecracking sidekick, acts as his master's conscience and tries his best to keep him in check. Djaq, the Palestinian slave that the gang frees early on, and Will, the talented and wise-beyond-his-years carpenter, act as the voices of reason and group conscience. Little John serves as a pillar of strength and father-figure for the gang, and Allan provides considerable comic relief (""Not bein' funny, but..."").There are times when the acting is shaky, but on the whole most of the stars manage to pull things off wonderfully (particularly Keith Allen, who plays the brilliantly-horrible Sheriff and Harry Lloyd (Will Scarlett) is so expressive without actually using words, he can convey the unspoken mood of the group with a single look.).This production clearly didn't go for historical accuracy; some of the technology used by the gang and the sheriff are obviously non-medieval, and the costumes are ridiculously non-period (Robin wears a hoodie most of the time, Marian can be seen in everything from seventies-inspired flyaway cardigans to a bustled wedding gown that is nearly Victorian, and apparently the Sheriff's footwear of choice is Birkenstocks.)However, as bizarre as the costuming can be, it's not usually so distracting that it takes away from the show, and while some of the episodes have a very modern feel (there's an episode that is positively Entrapment-esque), it's still fun and interesting.Also unlike former Robin Hoods, BBC's Robin actually seems to have taken something back with him from the Holy Land; he wields a scimitar instead of a broadsword, uses a recurve bow and quotes the Koran. And while the storylines rarely incorporate anything directly ""Christian"", I don't think this is because anyone making the show wants to exclude them, but because of the setting; this is medieval Britain, after all- we all KNOW the majority of the population is probably Christian or at least pseudo-folk-Christian (a classification I totally just made up in reference to Christians still hanging on to Pagan traditions, no offense meant!). Do we really need references to remind us of it? Some complain of a lack of the iconic Friar Tuck (and I admit, it would have been interesting to have both a Christian priest and Djaq in the gang), but I hear season three will finally bring him into the story.As for the reliance on communicating Islamic and Middle Eastern ideas, I think it's refreshing to watch something that isn't constantly bashing on Islam and rattling on and on about terrorism and patriotism and how we're the best country in the world (i.e. American news). Instead, the subtle political commentary seems to focus on the delicate relationship between Christianity and Islam in a war-torn world, and the importance of finding parallels between very different cultures. Maybe this is common in British television, but I'd like to applaud them anyway... it's about time someone decided to go for a little cultural relativism!All considered, a great show that has plenty of adventure, action and some romance, interesting and compelling characters, and fun storylines.",5,Great New Twist on Robin Hood,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,5611,"['Robin', 'Hood', 'new',

1059620,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B000NQQ4DI,Brandon J. Smith,"[4, 6]","What a pleasant surprise this has turned out to be. I was initially skeptical that this show would work - yet another modern take on an old tale. It caught my eye one day on BBC America, though, so I checked out the dvds. I was hooked by the end of the second episode.Every episode has a great mix of action, adventure, drama, comedy, and romance. Not only does it have all these great things, but it lacks what gets tiresome in so many other shows: The violence is never overly brutal, and we're not subjected to graphic sex scenes (I'm thinking particularly of the Tudors, another show I enjoy but find tasteless and tactless in this regard).Robin Hood blends some of the best aspects of family-friendly adventure shows, like Hercules and Xena, with modern television story-telling, especially of season- and series-long plot arcs. And in these regards, this new Robin Hood series passes with high marks.The writing and acting is first-rate, and the characters reveal their depth little by little, as each are given turns in the spot-light.

Early in the show, Robin is revealed to be a bit of a rake and makes out with a man's &#34;daughter&#34; who clearly is too old for the part. Later, when four of Robin's compatriots are dangling from ropes, Robin feels compelled to issue rebellious snippets before releasing the arrows that cut the ropes holding them, the last two with one shot.I've seen many great pistol, rifle, axe throwing and bow and arrow shots that were beyond belief; but most of the trick shots were done after extensive practice and sometimes the people making the shots would miss on occasion. Robin not only throws a sword many feet feet up in the air to hit and disable two men wearing metal helmets, the bow he uses to pull off his remarkable shots is not his bow, nor are the arrows his arrows. No one could make such shots using a bow and arrows he's never used before. Each bow has a different pull, each arrow must be made for a particular bow. And no arrow made back then was capable of slicing through a heavy rope. That no one brought up any of this during an early production meeting is even more indicative of the problems behind this peabrained series. Robin also would have used a long bow, not that ridiculous recurved bow. I could go on, but why bother? This is simply a retelling if Zorro, but not nearly as enthusiastic.

I was not sure of what to expect when I popped the first disc into the player, I just crossed my fingers that it would be decent and worthwhile, especially since my wife really wanted to watch it and it would have been brutal to watch a full show that I didn't like. I consider myself very fortunate that this show exceeded my expectations, hence the five star rating.The first thing I noticed is that the show has an interesting and unique balance of action, humor and seriousness. The scripting for the characters makes them likeable. My favorites are Robin Hood himself but also Djaq, Much, Sir Guy, and Marion. Actually, Sir Guy is easy to feel sorry for. Being the Nodingham's second in command, he is loyal to a rotten villain, but he reveals that he has a humanity to him that causes a lot of internal conflict. Marion in this story is really tough, far from the helpless damsel-in-distress that she is portrayed as in other renditions of Robin Hood.

But this version is very good, the clothing is of the period although the chain mail armour of some of the knights appears a wee bit too cloth-like.  All-in-all though, the sheriff is nasty in a sarcastic way, Gisbon relishes being brutal, there are no silly attempts to shoot to targets using two arrows from the same bow like Kevin Costner's rendition of the legendary Robin Hood.  Russell Crowe's rendition of the character is totally dispassionate where the peasants are concerned.  But Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood is.  This is definately an action-packed series, with humour, tragedy, developing friendships, and beautiful countryside scenes and authentic castles.

I for one, have always thought of him as the mythical man who made all the ladies swoon and never really thought of him as having a ""real"" life - season 1 has really changed my mind!In this series, Robin Hood is played by Jonas Armstrong, and he definitely has the cute factor I have always envisioned. In comparison with the upcoming Robin Hood film starring Russell Crowe, I think that Jonas has more of the look I have attributed to this hero. In fact, every actor was perfectly cast in their roles - not only for looks, but for personality as well. Before this show I didn't know the names of anyone in his band except Robin and Little John - but now I know Allan-A-Dale and Will Scarlet. And the sheriff is wonderfully awful! Robin and Marion had great chemistry and they were great to watch together in their scenes. I don't know if I can pick my favorite character - it's a really close call between Robin and Allan.One of the things that first struck me every time I watched an episode was how everything has a tint of green and it gives it such a brilliant look. It makes the forest look more magical. I also liked how the theme song was used throughout the episodes - something to connect with and carry through the episode.My biggest complaint with the show is the costuming of Marion. I envision beautiful dresses befitting her rank - but much of the time she is wearing pants. While watching one of the special features they explained how this was done on purpose to make it more contemporary - but...I wished they had not done so. It just felt out of place for me because the rest of the cast looked appropriate. I loved watching this show, but it sometimes felt very slow; you would watch 2 episodes and feel like nothing had happened.Another thing that I learned from this season was that Robin Hood had been to fight in the Crusades. Like I said before, I never thought of him as anything other than the hero. It was nice to learn some back story about how he became who he was.

Some viewers will certainly find the show bit cliche and over the top, but if you want to zone out and have a good time, go for it.The season begins with Robin and his devoted sidekick Much returning from the Holy Land, where they've been hard at work fighting for the king. Right from the getgo Robin finds disagreement with the new sheriff (mostly regarding taxation) and becomes an outlaw, stealing from the rich to give to the poor...you know the game. Meanwhile, Robin is still infatuated by Marion, with whom he had a bit of a relationship before he left for the Crusades five years earlier. The gang of Robin's loyal followers is soon assembled, and off they go on their missions to protect the countryside.There are several things that are huge annoyances, although they don't really interfere with the show being just plain fun. The biggest issue for me is that Robin is hardly likeable. The only thing that keeps him afloat as your typical Good Guy is that he rides around doing acts of justice and he holds to his morals (MOST of the time. He even becomes murderous in a few episodes. I kept getting the vibe that sooner or later he was going to lose his mind. Robbinnn!). So other than that moral junk, and I do hate to say it, he's pretty much a selfish, pompus jerk. There it is; I would've been able to get into the series so much more if Robin wasn't so cocky. I really do want to fall in love with the hero, in a way. And don't get me wrong, Jonas Armstrong is a fine actor... so I suppose it's the writing to blame. Another issue is that the episodes simply don't connect! Each one follows a good storyline, but that's individually speaking. The episodes do seem to just start over. It's obvious that a good TV series should have each episode expanding and playing off the one before it, and that simply isn't the case here; this makes for limited character development. For example, in the end of one episode Allen becomes ill from accidentally drinking some kind of fluid they used to trick the sheriff. In the very last scene, we see him turning green, for heaven's sake! The writers never carry this on, and the next time we seen him he's perfectly healthy. What a world. And did anyone else notice how in the start of the season Much was pronounced ""Mooch,"" and as they went on their accents must have slacked because he became just ""Much."" Smaller pet peeves include toning down the distracting theme music, for crying out loud; the actors sometimes mumbling (combine this with their accents and thank goodness for subtitles); and last but certainly not least is Guy's overdone pleather wardrobe. Oh, Guy.I hope I haven't gone overboard with the complaints because although these things do bug me, they're not enough to keep me from enjoying the show and being a dedicated viewer. I'm confident they will do the same for you.

A gorgeous score, wonderful costumes, outstanding performances, riveting plots, cunning twists...I really can't brag on it too much. A couple of minor complaints: Friar Tuck is absent from this version. I have a feeling it's because of the current climate against anything Christian. Islam gets a lot more respect. Even Saladin is painted as a compassionate leader who wants peace above all else (yeah, right). Carl Ketcherside once suggested that the people who led the Crusades were not Christians, and I tend to agree. You cannot claim to be a follower of Christ and simultaneously participate in horrible acts of torture against other human beings.

All the elements are in place: Robin Hood, Merry Men, Lady Marian, Sir Guy, the Sheriff of Nottingham. At first the costumes are guaranteed to drive purists crazy. The guys' shirts look like they came from the Sherwood Forest Gap outlet. Sir Guy's leather duster is right out of a Western (though hunky Richard Armitage wears it well). Marian's costumes are mostly unflattering. Then there are the none-too-subtle current Bush-Blair political references. Robin Hood as terrorist? Hmm. Lady Marian as a feminist do-gooder? Okay. Maybe she's meant to be a good role model for girls. Apart from Much and Little John, the actors playing Robin, Will Scarlet, and Alan a Dale are practically interchangeable, all too physically similar for any one to stand out. Both Sir Guy and the Sheriff are far more memorable.All that said, the series steadily improves from the outset.

1059681,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000NQQ4DI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 21]","I'll be the first one to tell you--I'm sophisticated and classy. You know why? I watch BBCAmerica, and the Brits--they are the leaders of urbane and upscale entertainment. If you need any convincing, just watch an episode of ""Footballer's Wives,"" ""Mile High,"" or ""Bad Girls."" Of course, I'm kidding. These shows are brassy, bawdy, and loaded with bad behavior! But, you know what, they are also filled with life. They embrace their nastiness wholeheartedly and make no apologies for being pure popcorn entertainment. With language and nudity not permitted by American networks, it seems as if the genre of nighttime soaps has been revitalized by Britain. But that's not all BBCAmerica has to offer, they are just the shows that helped the network grow in popularity. Some other intriguing entries that recently aired in the US are on their way to DVD--there is a new hip take on ""Robin Hood,"" the supernatural ""Hex,"" and the complex crime story ""Conviction."" So beware! The British are coming, the British are coming--and it's a good thing!On preparing to sit through ""Robin Hood,"" it's best to know what to anticipate. If you're expecting any sort of historical insight or don't want anyone tampering with the ""classic"" tale of Mr. Hood--then I'd advise you to take a pass. Do I need to say what ""Robin Hood"" is about? Robin is a former noble who becomes an outlaw and forms a posse to (duh!) rob from the rich to give to the poor. This version casts attractive actors, employs anachronistic language, and is firmly rooted in modern (and politically correct) sensibilities. The production is slick, stunts and camerawork exemplary--this is a well crafted entertainment. Most episodes move at a brisk and amusing pace, and even when things seem to lack real danger--the series more than compensates with humor. The plots aren't particularly revelatory, but any lack of originality is likely to be forgiven due to the energetic and likable performances.And the success of this ""Robin Hood"" rest squarely on Jonas Armstrong's shoulders. Armstrong is a star! Perhaps a bit slight for a true action hero, Armstrong is wildly appealing and has great comic timing. His need to be loved by the people is a running gag and one that works exceedingly well--but, then again, who wouldn't love this Robin? Keith Allen is a stellar Sheriff of Nottingham, this is comic villainy at its finest. Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisborne is the show's real menace and does a nice job with a somewhat underwritten part. Lucy Griffiths plays an earnest Marion--updated to hero status herself just to be fair. At first, the show had trouble incorporating Marion into the main action and her tone was always more somber--but a balance is reached as the show progresses. The secondary players are a bit more sketchy, but are employed to good effect when necessary.If this version of ""Robin Hood"" is guilty of anything, it might be a ""too cool for school"" mentality. It is so intent on being clever with ironic humor and modern attitudes that the sheer adventure is sometimes secondary. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this updating--it just tries so hard to be ""hip."" From the whimsical episode titles through to the inevitable laugh that ends just about every episode, ""Robin Hood"" almost defies you to take it seriously--and yet, its ultimate success depends on you doing so. I wanted to be blown away be this series, but the episodes end up being more of a lark than anything else. Fun, frothy and not very filling--I still give this 4 (maybe 3 1/2) stars. I see ""Hood"" having the potential to develop more compelling story arcs with greater ambition, let's see if that happens when Season 2 rolls around.

1059705,A3CG1936WHZGYK,B000NQQ4DI,MJG,"[3, 5]","I am currently going through this first season DVD set with my husband after having watched the second season FIRST, so am seeing the series out of sync - that said, while Errol Flynn/Olivia DeHavilland's film version of the legend will ALWAYS remain my favorite version, this one is a fun, while anachronistic (in costumes, and particularly dialogue) show.  Robin of Loxley returns from the Holy Land with his faithful sidekick Much to find his home and his lands under the 'caretaking' of Sir Guy of Gisborne, and to find his old friend, Edward, former Sheriff of Nottingham (and the father of Marian) supplanted by the evil new Sheriff.  It isn't long before Robin has to choose between his principles and decide to become an outlaw or to quash his feelings to exist under the tyranny of the new Sheriff.  As everyone knows what Robin chooses I won't bother to go into details.As far as the cast goes, the outstanding performances are the 'bad guys' - Keith Allen as the completely sociopathic Sheriff, without conscience, remorse or empathy for his fellow man (and coming from my background as an adoptive mom, I would say he definitely was afflicted with RAD as a child) whereas Sir Guy is also wonderfully and wickedly portrayed by the outstanding Richard Armitage - an actor I didn't even know existed until seeing the wonderful BBC production of North and South recently because it was sitting in my Elisabeth Gaskell collection from Costco and I finally got around to popping it into the DVD player.  Armitage's Sir Guy seems to also have sociopathic tendencies; but unlike the Sheriff, does seem to have some capacity for love and for empathy with his fellow man(or in other words, had mild to moderate attachment disorder as a child, or perhaps ODD issues).  Sir Guy's costume is a combination black leather cowboy duster/biker dude outfit, which keeps my husband and I wondering if he is hiding his Harley somewhere (and from my old Wyoming resident days makes me think that Sir Guy would have fit in quite well at the old Buckhorn Bar in Laramie, Wyoming in the early 1990s!).As far as the rest of the cast are concerned, Jonas Armstrong's Robin is a cocky, mischievous, fun-filled jokester/trickster, which works fairly well for the character.  Armstrong's physicality strikes me as a bit Brad Pitt-esque, with scruffy beard, and his interpretation of Robin grew on me as I got into the series more.  The rest of the ""Merry Men"" which include a woman - the Moslem slave-turned-Robin-follower Djaq (after Robin helps rescue her) are all portrayed by the usual BBC talent.The only disappointment for me was the gal cast as Maid Marian.  Lucy Griffiths, who is very young in this first season, is not a bad actress, but sometimes her choices and her almost one note performances at times make it hard to believe that Robin and Guy would both be so passionately in love with her.  She is certainly not in the caliber of Olivia DeHavilland or even some of the other Marians in years past.  After seeing some of the awesome talent that the BBC has put in their other period dramas, it is hard to conceive that they couldn't have found an actress who is so incredibly gorgeous and with such spirit that one can quite understand why the two men are willing to come to such fisticuffs over her.  It would have been nice to see someone with a Jane Seymour, Greer Garson, young Liz Taylor or that sort of beauty and talent cast as the feisty yet feminine Marian.  (Does nobody out there exist like that anymore?)  In this series Marian must struggle between the wicked yet outstandingly handsome wannabe noble Sir Guy (and really, Armitage is, in the looks department, on a caliber with Tyrone Power or Cary Grant of old - and certainly his talent from what I've been able to view of his work seems to be quite on a par with both of those idols - perhaps surpassing Power in the talent department) and the handsome-yet-more-boy-next-door-but-good-hearted-and-true-noble Robin.  There are moments when Armitage is giving Griffiths the full benefit of his acting prowess and she doesn't always return the favor in like measure.As a Catholic, my only other disappointment is that all the priest and nun characters are either lampooned or shown as wicked or heartless hypocrites.  And when the purportedly Catholic (as all Christians were in this time in England, sorry history revisionists) characters marry, they are content to let Robin or some lay person marry them - this was and still is only allowed in a time of crisis when no clergy member was available as far as I am aware (Or was taught by my Jesuit educated parents on the subject) - true the marrying couple gives each other the sacrament, but if a priest could be found all attempts would have been made to have one officiate.  It is sort of like making an act of perfect contrition instead of going to confession - it suffices if a priest isn't available, but then if one is the Catholic lay person is BOUND to find one.  In past versions of the legend the 'bad' clerical characters were at least balanced by the kindly, true Christian presence of Friar Tuck in the gang.  But, if one believes things claimed by Edward Stourton in his old ABSOLUTE TRUTH on the Second Vatican Council, the BBC has been filled with marxist types for some time so their anti Catholic/anti Christian prejudice, which is quite common now all over the globe and really as popular as it was in early America, is not to be surprised at.  I hear that Tuck is making an appearance in season 3; so I hope that some attempt will be made at fair play in this area, but I've long learned not to expect balance or fairness where the entertainment industry is concerned anymore.  (I did agree with the anti torture themes presented in the series, which were obviously a thinly veiled reference to recent military realities.)",4,an entertaining rousing version of the

I don't know why that is - maybe the BBC only gives a little bit of money to start the show, see how it does, then by the 2nd series finally gives the show some money to hire real writers.  Just a guess.  So the thing is, you have to get past the 1st series.  I learned this when getting into Merlin - I was home ill for a week and put it on Netflix to kill the time.  I thought the 1st series was rubbish but was too weak to find another show in my feavered state.  By the 2nd series I was hooked, sick or no.  Luckily they were sill making Merlin when I discovered it.  I was not so lucky with Robin Hood - it's been off the air for several years now.  But YAY of Amazon Prime for still having it!  I've been watching it and am totally addicted.  Yeah, the 1st series was kind of rubbish - like Mcdonalds for your eyeballs, but I just knew if I pushed thru it would get good - I mean, the dude that plays the 1st Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously evil.  He plays that character so well and completely sold the show to me from episode 1, even with the rubbish writing going on around him.  My next favorite is Guy of Gisborn - I just knew they would be doing things with his character that would be astounding - and they pulled everything off thanks to the superior acting of Richard Armatage.  I when into laughing hysterics with his ""So, where do I sleep?"" line in series 3.  The dude that plays Alan is freakin awesome too - his line delivery feels like a real person talking to you, and he did a spectacular job playing both sides in series 2.  But lastly, lets not forget Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood.  Series one he obviously got the role because of his charm, wit and boyishly good looks and he relied heavily upon that in the beginning - but who knew the dude could actually act???  I think the 1st episode of the 3rd series is my favorite - I really believed his pain.  My only real gripe is the scramble to give him a love interest.  I really could have done without Kate and wish they would have had her go with Much or Alan.  Anyway. I'm glad the show ended as it did without trying to carry on with a new cast.  That's what killed Being Human!

I couldn't wait to see this show after seeing the previews years ago and, as a lover of the book and the newer Robin Hood film as a child, I was not in the least bit disappointed.This show has everything you could want in an hour long drama; young actor's with some very good raw talent(another thing good about the Brits =] ), great story-telling that never disappoints, and some of the best action sequences I've watched EVER in a television show. They really did a wonderful job training for these scenes and it is all very believable the way it is done. Same goes for the storylines. Many times I finished an episode and wondered how they could further develop the same story in what was beginning to feel like a very congested and all-around small region to work with. It essentially takes place in Nottingham and the forest locals, as did the book, with a few towns and villages thrown in for good measure. After about 6 episodes I started to wonder how the band of rogues would continue to infultrate the same castle over and over. Can the Sheriff and his men really be THAT stupid as to not know by then what the members of the group looked like, thereby allowing them to get in almost undetected episode after episode? I have to say, however, that the writers do it in very understandable and concievable manners. That, to me, is the mark of a great series, continuity and believability. One other thing that made this series truely full in all area's was the humor. I constantly found myself laughing out loud at this show. I'm a lover of british comedy anyhow, but the character's do such an outstanding job of creating the humor through their own acting technique's, the actor playing Robin Hood especially(something about his personality makes him magnetic, even through moments when he seems cocky and full of himself).Get this dvd if you love a well-rounded drama with tons of action and actor's who really deserve recognition for the work they do.

I would have liked to see the show go on for several more seasons.But Guy of Gisborne is the most interesting character in this series.  (Far better the whining incompetent Guy of Robin of Sherwood.)  The conflict between Robin and Giy is set well in the first episode without violence.Richard Armitage does a great job of portraying Gisborne as an ambitious but tormented man who fights on the wrong side but who still has some salvageable aspects to his character.  He mistakenly thinks that acquiring power and position will give him what he wants in life, though that  mindset is constantly challenged by Robin and Marian living the truth that it is not power, but selfless commitment to serving a greater cause brings happiness, respect and love.  He is always subtly struggling between what he thinks he must do to further his ambition and being the kind of man he should be.Consequently, Gisborne has the most depth and intriguing aspects of any character in the series.  So much so that I had to look up his background to find out more about him.  He would have been my choice physically for Faramir in The Lord of the Rings or for the character range of Boromir. Gisborne's scenes are the strong point of each episode because while he is the military arm of the irrational and sometimes campy Sheriff (who has NO redeeming qualities),  there are always indications that when his ambitions don't get in the way, he has some heart for the ordinary people even if his concept of  law enforcement is rather brutal.Even if you're not a fan of Robin Hood (but who isn't), watch this for the development of the dark and brooding Gisborne, always compelling in black leather.",5,Gisborne Steals the Show,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,2083,"['Even', 'am', 'fan', 'rendition', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'ordinary', 'people', 'taking', 'back', 'resisting', 'oppressive', 'government', 'returning', 'taxes', 'hard', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'pay', 'watched', 'Gisborne', 'more', 'Robin', 'Hood.The', 'first', 'episode', 'Will', 'Tolerate', 'theme', 'Robin', 'speech', 'last', 'episode', 'third', 'season', 'as', 'inspirational', 'first', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'show', 'go', 'several', 'more', 'seasons.But', 'Guy', 'Gisborne', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'series', 'Far', 'better', 'whining', 'incompetent', 'Guy', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'conflict', 'Robin', 'Giy', 'set', 'well', 'first', 'episode', 'violence.Richard', 'Armitage', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'Gisborne', 'ambitious', 'tormented', 'man', 'who', 'wrong', 'side', 'who', 'still', 'salvageable', 'aspects', 'character', 'mistakenly', 'acquiring', 'power', 'position', 'will', 'give', 'what', 'life', 'mindset', 'constantly', 'challenged', 'Robin', 'Marian', 'living', 'truth', 'not', 'power', 'selfless', 'commitment', 'serving', 'greater', 'cause', 'happiness', 'respect', 'love', 'always', 'subtly', 'struggling', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'further', 'ambition', 'being', 'kind', 'man', 'should', 'be.Consequently', 'Gisborne', 'most', 'depth', 'intriguing', 'aspects', 'character', 'series', 'So', 'much', 'had', 'look', 'up', 'background', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'choice', 'physically', 'Faramir', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'character', 'range', 'Boromir', 'Gisborne', 'scenes', 'are', 'strong', 'point', 'episode', 'military', 'arm', 'irrational', 'sometimes', 'campy', 'Sheriff', 'who', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'are', 'always', 'indications', 'when', 'ambitions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'heart', 'ordinary', 'people', 'even', 'concept', 'law', 'enforcement', 'rather', 'brutal.Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'who', ""n't"", 'watch', 'development', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Gisborne', 'always', 'compelling', 'black', 'leather']",Robin Hood: Season 1

I would like to say that it lives up to its hype, but in all honesty; it is a fair series, enjoyable in an undemanding way, with some rather hard-to-swallow plotlines. Kids will like it, even if they won't lap it up. Keith Allen is great fun as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham and Jonas Armstrong is a credible Robin Hood.My main gripe about this series is the absence of Friar Tuck. Judging by other reviews here, I am not the only one. Robin Hood without Tuck is like the Fantastic 4 without The Thing. He is essential, if for nothing else, for a healthy dollop of humour. Tuck is replaced by Djaq, a Muslim girl, who is not only lacking in any humour whatsoever, but seems to have been inserted by the makers of the series to show their liberal credentials. We are reminded every week of how superior Muslim culture is to medieval European culture, how her parents died cruelly at the hands of the Crusaders, and how cleverer she is than the rest of the Merry Men. In other words, she is a sanctimonious pain in the arse. On top of that, I would question the assumptions made by the scriptwriters here. Must I remind them that Robin Hood and his men are supporting Good King Richard who is fighting the Crusades in defence of Christianity? On top of that, Islam had been attacking the borders of Christianity for centuries and would continue to do so for many more centuries? The Crusades are not as black and white as historical revisionists would have us believe.This series will be forgotten by the time a new series of Robin Hood is commissioned, which I hope will be soon and which will include Friar Tuck.",2,Where is Friar Tuck!,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,1764,"['Britain', 'series', 'was', 'loudly', 'trumpeted', 'British', 'Broadcasting', 'Corporation', 'weeks', 'months', 'even', 'advance', 'eventually', 'broadcast', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'up', 'hype', 'honesty', 'fair', 'series', 'enjoyable', 'undemanding', 'way', 'rather', 'hard-to-swallow', 'plotlines', 'Kids', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lap', 'up', 'Keith', 'Allen', 'great', 'fun', 'villainous', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'credible', 'Robin', 'Hood.My', 'main', 'gripe', 'series', 'absence', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'Judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Tuck', 'Fantastic', '4', 'Thing', 'essential', 'nothing', 'else', 'healthy', 'dollop', 'humour', 'Tuck', 'replaced', 'Djaq', 'Muslim', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'lacking', 'humour', 'whatsoever', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', 'makers', 'series', 'show', 'liberal', 'credentials', 'are', 'reminded', 'week', 'how', 'superior', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'medieval', 'European', 'culture', 'how', 'parents', 'died', 'cruelly', 'hands', 'Crusaders', 'how', 'cleverer', 'rest', 'Merry', 'Men', 'other', 'words', 'sanctimonious', 'pain', 'arse', 'top', 'would', 'question', 'assumptions', 'made', 'scriptwriters', 'here', 'Must', 'remind', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'men', 'are', 'supporting', 'Good', 'King', 'Richard', 'who', 'fighting', 'Crusades', 'defence', 'Christianity', 'top', 'Islam', 'had', 'been', 'attacking', 'borders', 'Christianity', 'centuries', 'would', 'continue', 'do', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'centuries', 'Crusades', 'are', 'not', 'black', 'white', 'historical', 'revisionists', 'would', 'have', 'believe.This', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'time', 'new', 'series', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'commissioned', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'will', 'include', 'Friar', 'Tuck']",Robin Hood: Season 1

This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass,  and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging.

The costuming is very well done.  At first it was hard to accept the leather-looking duster that Guy of Gisborne was wearing, but it appears to have changed slightly as the series progresses.  Uniforms for the castle guard are also very well done.  I really must commend on the sets of the castle and medieval house settings.  Very realistic looking.Casting and acting is also very well done.  Ignore the negative reviews concerning this aspect.  Very good character development across the series.  Some very intense moments for some of the characters as well.  Fight choreography is also very well done for a TV production.  Much more realistic than anything on Hercules or Xena.  But somewhat on par with what Beastmaster had.If you have any interest in the Robin Hood mythos, I highly recommend  giving this series a try.  It's a bit expensive though, as its a BBC production, but I really think that if you can get through the first half of the season, then I think you'll find your investment was well worth it.",5,Excellent series.

1059735,A2QDPJRVXL7P4F,B000NQQ4DI,"Sahra Badou ""Bibliophile""","[3, 5]","I really enjoyed this TV series and I am glad I picked it up.I honestly was not too keen on watching it. I've been watching Robin Hood movies since I was a kid, and grew out of them. I still remember reading Robin Hood as a child in class. Reading a book in class, and knowing you will be tested and graded on it is not the same as reading a book in your own leisure time. It takes all the fun out of reading the book.Since I ran out of episodes of Lost, Battlestar Galactica, The 4400, Nip Tuck, to mention just a few of my favorite TV series, I decided to pick up Robin Hood out of sheer lack of other visual entertainment.We all know the story of Robin Hood since childhood. Robin of Locksley heads home from the Crusades to find his people starving and ill-treated by the new Sheriff of Nottingham. In order to save his people, he sacrifices his title and land, and turns against the Sheriff. He becomes an outlaw, stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Robin treated women, the poor, and people of humble status with courtesy. A good deal of the impetus for his revolt against authority stemmed from popular resentment over the laws of the forest that restricted hunting rights.His childhood love Marian comes alive in these episodes as a fighter and swordswoman. Before Robin had returned from the Crusades, she had already taken the cause of the poor, protecting them and defending them from the ruthless Sheriff. She becomes known as the night watchman, but no one knows her true identity, until Robin discovers it much later.Robin's feelings towards the Crusades are revealed in these episodes. He is against using religion as a pretext for going to war. He feels the Crusades are a mistake, and that peace should be forged between the Christians and the Muslims. It is revealed in one episode that the Sheriff's right hand, Sir Guy, journeyed conspicuously to the Holy Lands disguised as a Muslim and tried to kill the King of England in order to keep the war going. In another episode, the son of the Muslim leader secretly journeys to England to forge peace. Apparently, all sides want peace, but evil forces conspire to turn both sides against each other to continue the war. I found this pretty interesting. In truth, though, the stories that come to us from the 14th century about Robin Hood do not mention any of this. In fact, Robin Hood might have never participated in the Crusades. The popular modern belief that he was of the time of Richard I probably stems from a fabrication by an 18th-century antiquary named William Stukeley.So was Robin Hood a real historical person? The stories of Robin Hood are told to us through ballads dating back to the 14th century. The early ballads make it clear that the action took place chiefly in south Yorkshire, not in Nottinghamshire. This too was a later fabrication. None of the various claims identifying Robin Hood with a particular historical figure has gained much support, and the outlaw's existence may never have been anything but legendary. But don't tell kids this! Santo Claus is a real person too!The swords fighting in the first few episodes were terrible. You could easily tell that the characters were nowhere near hurting each other. In other words, the fighting was not realistic. However, the fighting does improve in later episodes.The acting is great with lots of humor thrown in. My favorite character is actually Sir Guy. He is portrayed more of a victim of love than a villain. I did feel sorry for him, and found myself sympathizing with him on many occasions. In fact, Marian double-crossed him.The episodes improve as the series progresses. Overall, I recommend this series. I am looking forward for Season 2.",4,A modern Robin Hood.,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3702,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'TV', 'series', 'am', 'glad', 'picked', 'up.I', 'honestly', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'watching', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'movies', 'was', 'kid', 'grew', 'still', 'remember', 'reading', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'child', 'class', 'Reading', 'book', 'class', 'knowing', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'graded', 'not', 'same', 'reading', 'book', 'own', 'leisure', 'time', 'fun', 'reading', 'book.Since', 'ran', 'episodes', 'Lost', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', '4400', 'Nip', 'Tuck', 'mention', 'just', 'few', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'sheer', 'lack', 'other', 'visual', 'know', 'story', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'childhood', 'Robin', 'Locksley', 'heads', 'home', 'Crusades', 'find', 'people', 'starving', 'ill-treated', 'new', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'order', 'save', 'people', 'title', 'land', 'Sheriff', 'outlaw', 'stealing', 'rich', 'give', 'poor', 'Robin', 'treated', 'women', 'poor', 'people', 'humble', 'status', 'courtesy', 'good', 'deal', 'impetus', 'revolt', 'authority', 'stemmed', 'popular', 'resentment', 'laws', 'forest', 'restricted', 'hunting', 'rights.His', 'childhood', 'love', 'Marian', 'alive', 'episodes', 'fighter', 'swordswoman', 'Robin', 'had', 'returned', 'Crusades', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'cause', 'poor', 'protecting', 'defending', 'ruthless', 'Sheriff', 'known', 'night', 'watchman', 'one', 'true', 'identity', 'Robin', 'much', 'later.Robin', 'feelings', 'Crusades', 'are', 'revealed', 'episodes', 'using', 'religion', 'pretext', 'going', 'war', 'Crusades', 'are', 'mistake', 'peace', 'should', 'be', 'forged', 'Christians', 'Muslims', 'revealed', 'one', 'episode', 'Sheriff', 'right', 'hand', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'journeyed', 'conspicuously', 'Holy', 'Lands', 'disguised', 'Muslim', 'tried', 'kill', 'King', 'England', 'order', 'keep', 'war', 'going', 'episode', 'son', 'Muslim', 'leader', 'secretly', 'England', 'forge', 'peace', 'Apparently', 'sides', 'want', 'peace', 'evil', 'forces', 'conspire', 'turn', 'sides', 'other', 'continue', 'war', 'found', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'truth', 'though', 'stories', 'come', '14th', 'century', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'do', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'might', 'have', 'never', 'participated', 'Crusades', 'popular', 'modern', 'belief', 'was', 'time', 'Richard', 'probably', 'fabrication', '18th-century', 'antiquary', 'named', 'William', 'Stukeley.So', 'was', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'real', 'historical', 'person', 'stories', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'are', 'told', 'ballads', 'dating', 'back', '14th', 'century', 'early', 'ballads', 'make', 'clear', 'action', 'took', 'place', 'chiefly', 'south', 'Yorkshire', 'not', 'Nottinghamshire', 'too', 'was', 'later', 'fabrication', 'None', 'various', 'claims', 'identifying', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'particular', 'historical', 'figure', 'gained', 'much', 'support', 'outlaw', 'existence', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'legendary', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'kids', 'Santo', 'Claus', 'real', 'person', 'too', 'swords', 'fighting', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'were', 'terrible', 'could', 'easily', 'tell', 'characters', 'were', 'nowhere', 'hurting', 'other', 'other', 'words', 'fighting', 'was', 'not', 'realistic', 'However', 'fighting', 'improve', 'later', 'episodes.The', 'acting', 'great', 'lots', 'humor', 'thrown', 'favorite', 'character', 'actually', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'portrayed', 'more', 'victim', 'love', 'villain', 'did', 'feel', 'sorry', 'found', 'sympathizing', 'many', 'occasions', 'fact', 'Marian', 'double-crossed', 'him.The', 'episodes', 'improve', 'series', 'Overall', 'recommend', 'series', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', '2']",Robin Hood: Season 1

If not, don't say I didn't warn you.  The thing about those shows that made them so entertaining was that they were both funny and dark and had likeable characters.  Well, the same is mostly true for this version of Robin Hood - don't expect a historically accurate serious drama and you won't be disappointed.  Don't be annoyed that the costumes and sets look too modern, that the dialogue is sometimes funny but often silly, or that the characters don't quite match up to the classic Robin Hood characters you'll find in earlier productions of Robin Hood, and you will like this  show.Not that I'm saying that this is the kind of show where you have to turn off your brain to have a good time.  In fact, though the first season took a while to find its sea legs, I've found that this show got considerably better as it progressed, particularly with continuity and how the storyline all pulled together.  All the fighting and stuntwork are really fun to watch and very realistic-looking (makes sense since the cast has mentioned numerous times how often they've been injured).  The archery is particularly cool.I don't understand all the negative comments about the casting (okay, some of them could be valid).  Yes, I will admit that Jonas Armstrong, no matter how cute he is, looks way too young to be playing Robin Hood.  He's very boyish, but he more than compensates with his acting IMO - he comes off as a protective and zealous and loyal Robin and has great chemistry with his castmates.  I will admit that Keith Allen is too hammy in his role as the evil sheriff but he's still very entertaining so I'll forgive him for that.  I suppose the weak cast link is Lucy Griffiths, the actress who plays Marian but only when it comes to playing opposite Jonas's Robin, and only in this season.  Maybe it's just me, but if I had to do scenes with Jonas where we were supposed to play flirty, I wouldn't glare at him or act like a stick of wood.  Yes, I understand that Marian is supposed to be angry at Robin for leaving her to fight in the war, but even still, I think her acting is a bit off in those scenes.The show does start off slow at first but it's still enjoyable and really grows on you.  It feels a little formulaic at times but I still had a good time watching.  If I can just give the writers a few tips:1.  Quit having the sheriff say ""la dee da dee da"" all the time.

His bravery and benevolence had a profound effect on me so I was very interegd when I heard the BBC was making a new and modern version. After watching the first season I was pretty pleased with the direction that they decided to take with Robin. The basic outline has Robin returning with his man servant from the Crusades only to find his beloved home town of Locksley run by a corrupt sheriff. Robin has a choice, give in to the Sheriff and retain the lands owned to him or resist. Robin resists of course and take to the woods where he wages (non bloody) gorilla warfare on the Sheriff and his goons. Robin Hood is pretty entertaining but it goes get repetitive quick. Many episodes are the following, The Sheriff or Robin have a plan to screw the other over, One of Robin's men gets caught, Robin rescues them. The Sheriff gets mad,swears revenge. usually in that order. With that aside the show has some cool components that make it unique to other versions of Robin hood. Like Marian being the vigilante ""The Knight Watchmen"" and the constant back drop of the Crusades.

All of his scenes with Marian are thrilling; they make this show worth watching.Having said that, the series itself is, well, hilarious.  I HOPE they're trying to make it campy, because that's how it comes across; it's as though they're all in on the joke.  How could ANYONE take this show seriously?  Flimsy plots, recycled sets, overacting, poor dialogue, ridiculous costumes, and a major case of Political Correctness disease (which, as we all know, was a killer in the 1100s).  It's a lot of fun, although if you don't find it funny you might find it annoying.  But some people thought Ed Wood was a serious director, too.And I know it's a little thing, but I don't get the cover art; it makes Robin Hood look like, well, maybe a monk?  It's like he's some dark character, which he's not; on the contrary, the actor playing him seems like a goofy 12-year-old, while Marian seems 20; that's why they never seem to belong together.

The only way he can do this is outside of the law...so Robin becomes an outlaw.

You would think after the first few times the Sherrif would have increased security a bit or even built a few new cells...but no...at one point in episode 13 Robin and Marion stand in front of the Sherrifs guards and they remain as unmoving as present day guards at Buckingham Palace...heavens by that time Robin has been in an out of the castle so many time to make a timely breakout that he would have been as recognisable to the guards as a Campbells soup tin but they remain totally oblivious..the series tries a little hard to be cool and up to date using slang and attitudes that would not be out of place in the present century...its okay to update but this series takes it to extremes...Most of the characters are likeable though... You can even see Guy of Gisborne's struggle to reconcile what he is doing with his long buried morals...poor old Richard Armitage only has alot of hooded looks to work with though and he has so much eye makeup on that he could give Theda Bara a run for her money....All the rest of the cast are likeable in a rough and ready streetwise way..You even like the Sherriff somewhat he is so unremittingly bad...the series is okay but it could have been so much better with a little  more work on the storylines and less trying to be so ""cool""....having a bit of a struggle with myself whether to buy series two or not",3,Pretty predictable and repetitive,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,2010,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'series', 'Here', 'scenario', 'entire', 'series', 'Episode', 'one', 'Robin', 'back', 'Loxley', 'things', 'have', 'gone', 'pot', 'evil', 'Sheffif', 'henchman', 'are', 'making', 'everyones', 'life', 'misery', 'Robin', 'right', 'things', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'do', 'outside', 'law', 'so', 'Robin', 'outlaw', 'Episode', 'two', 'thirteen', 'one', 'Robins', 'men', 'friends', 'caught', 'evil', 'sherrif', 'thrown', 'dungeon', 'Robin', 'Nottingham', 'out', 'ingenious', 'rousing', 'way', 'race', 'back', 'forest.Its', 'pretty', 'much', 'veriation', 'same', 'theme', 'rest', 'whole', 'series', 'would', 'think', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'Sherrif', 'would', 'have', 'increased', 'security', 'bit', 'even', 'built', 'few', 'new', 'cells', 'one', 'point', 'episode', '13', 'Robin', 'Marion', 'stand', 'front', 'Sherrifs', 'guards', 'remain', 'as', 'unmoving', 'present', 'day', 'guards', 'Buckingham', 'Palace', 'heavens', 'time', 'Robin', 'been', 'out', 'castle', 'so', 'many', 'time', 'make', 'timely', 'breakout', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'recognisable', 'guards', 'Campbells', 'soup', 'tin', 'remain', 'totally', 'oblivious..the', 'series', 'little', 'hard', 'be', 'cool', 'up', 'date', 'using', 'slang', 'attitudes', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'place', 'present', 'century', 'okay', 'update', 'series', 'extremes', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'Guy', 'Gisborne', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'what', 'doing', 'long', 'buried', 'morals', 'poor', 'old', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'only', 'alot', 'hooded', 'looks', 'work', 'though', 'so', 'much', 'eye', 'makeup', 'could', 'give', 'Theda', 'Bara', 'run', 'money', '.All', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'likeable', 'rough', 'ready', 'streetwise', 'way..You', 'even', 'Sherriff', 'somewhat', 'so', 'unremittingly', 'bad', 'series', 'okay', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'storylines', 'less', 'trying', 'be', 'so', 'cool', '.having', 'bit', 'struggle', 'buy', 'series', 'two', 'not']",Robin Hood: Season 1

1059757,AOJ7KWJZ9AC40,B000NQQ4DI,WesTexan,"[0, 0]","I've been a follower of Robin Hood most of my life. The idea, the legend, has universal appeal. My first Robin Hood was Errol Flynn. The first Robin Hood I read was poetry, that is, English ballads followed by &#34;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&#34; by Howard Pyle. In 1991 we got two modern Robin Hood movies: &#34;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&#34; with Kevin Costner (and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and a knockout sound track followed by &#34;Robin Hood&#34; with Patrick Bergin (and Uma Thurman), which has become my favorite movie (but Mary Elizabeth is my favorite Marian).So, this Robin Hood has 500 years of competition. I wanted to like it, but it always seemed more like a band of teenagers with their uncle (Little John) rather than a band of merry men. This Robin Hood is simply not believable as being a nobleman. The story lines are, on average, shallow, and in some cases, silly. In one episode, they are fearless and able warriors. In the next, they more resemble the Keystone Cops (Google it). Robin Hood is conflicted. Although the story line has the Sheriff protected, nothing is protecting Gisborne, yet Robin refuses to end him, so Gisborne is basically allowed to freely terrorize and murder the poor villagers.The Saracen girl is no more than a nod to political correctness. The Brits are being overrun by Islam, following quickly on the heels of Sweden, so they had to include a Muslim to offset the Crusades. Equal time and all of that tripe.I really wanted to like this Maid Marian. (Killing her off was simply stupid, but that's on Robin for allowing Gisborne to live.) She's beautiful and she can fight, except when she can't fight; She seems to be schizophrenic---strong one minute and a poor weak damsel in distress the next.I simply cannot recommend this piece of fluff.
