On the one hand, I appreciate the decidedly darker and more mature content than we're used to seeing in these DC direct releases.  This movie poses the question that people have long had on their mind--namely, should superheroes, and Superman in particular, adopt corporal punishment as a means of combating crime?  The public is, frankly, quite weary of super villains who destroy property, harm innocent people, and constantly find ways out of society's revolving door prisons.On the other hand, while it seems like a good plot the delivery is a bit skewed.  Superman stands as a steadfast example of compassion and moral justice, but the Elite and their message is sometimes hard to swallow.  Granted, the Elite's dialogue is decent enough and several character deaths give credence to their harsher stance on crime, but in all honesty, they are poor candidates to make the message.  Manchester Black, especially, with his nonchalant attitude and English accent seems to detract from the seriousness of this philosophy.

Superman has to reevaluate if his moral code has finally been left behind by a modern era that would rather shoot first and never bother asking questions.This is a hard movie to judge. This is the first DVD based on a single issue from the comics (Action Comics #775, ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, and the American Way,"" by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke). For better or for worse, lots of stuff had to be expanded upon to make it fit the 74 minute run time. But, they did get Joe Kelly to come back write this adaptation, and he inserted a few details from later comics with the Elite. A big difference is that the Elite act like they want Superman to be their Number 5 member and get some heroic moments, before turning against big blue. They did managed to conserve the big battle at the end, which is what everyone is hoping for.Sadly, the biggest problem is the animation style. In the other DC DVDs they always try to replicate the original artist's style for the animation. While Mahnke does occasionally use exaggerated proportions, most people would say he's known for a gritty ugly style. Instead they chose a rubbery, super-deformed, cartoon style, that's distracting given the serious nature of the material.One more thing, Action Comics #775 was written in March 2001, so it was written as a reaction to Antiheroes that were prevalent during the 1990s. But in this post-9/11 adaptation, you're definitely going to feel the post-9/11, modern slant.I can't say much about the performance. All of the Elite are great. Manchester Black sounds almost exactly how I'd imagined. Everyone else is fine, I just can't take them seriously because of the distracting character designs.Extras on the Bluray include:Commentary with Joe Kelly and Eddie Berganza, Witer and Editor of Action #775 receptively. It's an okay conversation.Superman and the Moral Debate - A 17-Minute feature contemplating ""justice"" in the modern world.The Elite Unbound: No Rules, No Mercy - Joe Kelly expands on the characters of the Elite, which is really helpful to get a better understanding of the film.Alan Burnet's Top Picks from Superman the Animated Series: Brave New Metropolis (An Evil Superman) and Warrior Queen (Maxima).Sneak Peek at Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (part 1) - A 12-minute first look at the next adaptation, Frank Miller's Batman: the Dark Knight Returns. For once they read my mind, and they're going to do it in two parts.

A new group of heroes march onto Superman's block and leave him feeling less than positive of a first impression. It quickly degenerates into a world who wants to get back against the villains - with due prejudice. And soon, the world is put against its axis. When is wrong being right? Well, we are talking about Superman, aren't we?So we've got a new DC animated flick. While us fans want to see a feature with the Flash, Martian Manhunter, Hawk Man, et al. I'll shelve that argument for now. DC once again gives us a mature look behind the philosophy of the difference right and wrong, and how hard it can be to maintain the good above the bad. And they do this little morality tale with strong storytelling, amazing voice acting, kind of a throwback animation that reminds me of the great animated series. An the music, it brings in the Superman theme very well without overwhelming us with the same refrain every time.The special features are just as elite. Featurettes, a digital comic, commentary, a look at the upcoming the Dark Knight Returns (part one), Bruce Timm top two episodes of the Superman animated series and a photo gallery for the Dark Knight Rises film.This is just solid gold. While Marvel rules the theatres, DC knocks the animated tales out all animated films so hard they don't land. Never. Here's hoping they keep it up.

Thus we get Superman vs. the Elite.I was worried that this film was just another slugfest pitting olde Supes against another generic team to lay waste to the city. Luckily, it turned out to be much more than that. The Elite are a new age group of anti-heroes that pose as a perfect foil to Superman's traditional values. The film runs the gamut of all the issues on hand, from the tights and capes to the twisted and violent origin stories.The animation also isn't nearly as bad as other people say. The artwork is a bit simplistic compared to other animated features like the direct-to-dvd marvel features, but for a DC animated feature it's par for the course. The design is a bit simplistic, but still much better than your average DC television animation, like the Justice League and Superman cartoons from back when.

Trying to give fans a new boost of the Man of Steel in the pop media(probably because of the upcoming reboot film), this is an adaptation of the anniversary special in Action Comics #775 introducing an Authority-like superhero team into Superman's personal universe.Superman fights the marauding Atomic Skull in the middle of Metropolis, but not without a few honest citizens getting disentigraged. Superman then finds out a foreign country is using giant monsters in their civil war, but is suprisingly helped by a new team of young heroes who call themselves The Elite. Their leader is the cocky telepathic Manchester Black. His teammates are Coldcast who can project and absorb nuclear energy, the winged Menegerie who can summon bizarre creatures directly out of her body, and their resident magic-user, The Hat. Superman is at first happy to recieve some new help in the world protection biz, because apparently like in all Superman movies there aren't any other superhero teams like the JLA. It becomes apparent though that The Elite don't pull punches as they kill some terrorists and waste Atomic Skull after he busts out of jail even more powerful. This makes The Elite new flavor of the week around the world. Superman begins to doubt whether his way of being a hero is effective in the 21st Century, but realizes that The Elite has to be stopped. After they go to far by axing the leaders of a war-torn nation, Superman challenges The Elite to a fight to the finish. They teleport to the moon, and at first it looks like Superman is deader than disco. Things go nightmarish for The Elite though as Superman seems to turn into freakin' General Zod, using his powers to take them down one-by-one. He finally stops Black by destroying his mental powers by giving him a heat-vision lobotomy. Superman reveals he was faking the whole going crazy thing at the end with some help from his Legion of Super-Robots. Truth, justice, and all that jazz are restored, but hopefully next time Supes will remember to call on Batman for some help!This movie had some more harsher tones than the previous DC Universe entries, but the more cartoonish look to the characters seems to really derail alot of the maturity involved. George Newbern from the Justice League animated series returns as Superman, but aside from him there isn't much any remarkable voice actors in it. I'd suggest at least renting or downloading it, but not really worth shelling out the money to own it.",3,"Truth, Justice, and Whateva...",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2644,"['Superman', 'already', 'had', 'two', 'own', 'animated', 'movies', 'part', 'DC', 'Universe', 'line', 'including', 'two', 'team-up', 'films', 'Batman', 'been', 'three', 'Justice', 'League', 'movies', 'Trying', 'give', 'fans', 'new', 'boost', 'Man', 'Steel', 'pop', 'media', 'probably', 'upcoming', 'reboot', 'film', 'adaptation', 'anniversary', 'special', 'Action', 'Comics', '775', 'introducing', 'Authority-like', 'superhero', 'team', 'Superman', 'personal', 'universe.Superman', 'marauding', 'Atomic', 'Skull', 'middle', 'Metropolis', 'not', 'few', 'honest', 'citizens', 'getting', 'disentigraged', 'Superman', 'then', 'out', 'foreign', 'country', 'using', 'giant', 'monsters', 'civil', 'war', 'suprisingly', 'helped', 'new', 'team', 'young', 'heroes', 'who', 'call', 'Elite', 'leader', 'cocky', 'telepathic', 'Manchester', 'Black', 'teammates', 'are', 'Coldcast', 'who', 'can', 'project', 'absorb', 'nuclear', 'energy', 'winged', 'Menegerie', 'who', 'can', 'summon', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'directly', 'body', 'resident', 'magic-user', 'Hat', 'Superman', 'first', 'happy', 'recieve', 'new', 'help', 'world', 'protection', 'biz', 'because', 'apparently', 'Superman', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'other', 'superhero', 'teams', 'JLA', 'apparent', 'Elite', 'do', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches', 'kill', 'terrorists', 'waste', 'Atomic', 'Skull', 'jail', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'Elite', 'new', 'flavor', 'week', 'world', 'Superman', 'doubt', 'way', 'being', 'hero', 'effective', '21st', 'Century', 'Elite', 'be', 'stopped', 'go', 'far', 'axing', 'leaders', 'war-torn', 'nation', 'Superman', 'Elite', 'fight', 'finish', 'teleport', 'moon', 'first', 'Superman', 'deader', 'disco', 'Things', 'go', 'nightmarish', 'Elite', 'Superman', 'turn', 'freakin', 'General', 'Zod', 'using', 'powers', 'take', 'down', 'one-by-one', 'finally', 'Black', 'destroying', 'mental', 'powers', 'giving', 'heat-vision', 'lobotomy', 'Superman', 'was', 'faking', 'whole', 'going', 'crazy', 'thing', 'end', 'help', 'Legion', 'Super-Robots', 'Truth', 'justice', 'jazz', 'are', 'restored', 'hopefully', 'next', 'time', 'Supes', 'will', 'remember', 'call', 'Batman', 'help', 'movie', 'had', 'more', 'harsher', 'tones', 'previous', 'DC', 'Universe', 'entries', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'look', 'characters', 'really', 'derail', 'alot', 'maturity', 'involved', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Justice', 'League', 'animated', 'series', 'returns', 'Superman', 'aside', ""n't"", 'much', 'remarkable', 'voice', 'actors', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'least', 'renting', 'downloading', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'shelling', 'out', 'money', 'own']",N/A

1534206,AIEZQIBS2VJO9,B007MCSV1O,J. Lawrence,"[39, 44]","In Superman vs. The Elite, the Man of Steel faces his most daunting foe yet: public opinion. In an era where the realities of terrorism and global strife have created a cynical and hardline attitudes about the concept of ""justice,"" Superman's idealistic optimism seems more and more outdated (both in the film, and in the real-world). So when a group of younger super-powered vigilantes known as The Elite appear on the scene, Superman is not prepared for their brutal stance against criminals - nor the resounding public approval that follows.The greatest super hero in the world soon discovers that changing times and public opinion are not things that even his god-like powers can control. Even with the world turning away from him, Superman must find some way to win back the support of humanity, before The Elite do something truly reckless and get themselves - and/or others - killed in the process.Superman vs. The Elite is an odd entry in the canon of DC Universe direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray animated features. On the one hand, the story (based on the Action Comics storyline ""What's So Funny About Truth Justice & the American Way?"") is actually one the most timely and interesting Superman tales to come along in awhile. (It certainly covers thematic ground that bears examination - as the upcoming feature-film reboot Man of Steel will attempt to do next year.)The story works in this animated feature as well as it did on the comic book page - primarily because the writer of the comic story (Joe Kelly) also wrote this animated feature version. The plot-points - sketching the modern world and how Superman's idealism is outdated; edgy anti-heroes being more popular than classic super heroes - are all directly addressing questions that fanboys and average people alike have been asking - namely, why does Superman still matter?With The Elite, we get an interesting antagonist - not really evil, per se, just grittier and darker than the classic superhero archetypes. There will no doubt be healthy debate amongst viewers as to whether The Elite are, or are not, the heroes we need in modern times, and whether or not Superman is the dinosaur some claim he is.While the narrative is intriguing and well-told, the visuals in Superman vs. The Elite leave something to be desired. DC Animation has long been praised (usually in comparison to Marvel Animation) for its character designs and animation quality - but this film looks as though it had a fraction of the usual budget for a DCU animated feature. The character designs are much more cartoony, in a 1950s comic strip sort of way; the quality of movement is also fairly shoddy, which is entirely noticeable during the action scenes. Strangely enough, the film looks like ""Superman: The Nickelodeon Version,"" even though it's dealing with mature material and themes. Blu-ray viewing will only make these discrepancies more apparent.The voicework in the film is pretty solid, with Superman being voiced by George Newbern - who has been doing animated Superman since the Justice League days in the early 2000s. NCIS star Pauley Perrette has a pretty good go at playing Lois Lane, while The Elite are suitably voiced by some talented character actors - including voice work veteran Robin Atkin Downes, who voices the group's leader, Manchester Black. (He was also the ship computer in Prometheus, the ""soccer announcer"" in Battleship, and has done voice work in more video games than I'm willing to count).All in all, Superman vs. The Elite is a Superman flick that's actually interesting to watch for intellectual reasons, but won't blow you away in terms of visual splendor or action. In that sense it's an easy recommend to those who maybe haven't been able to connect with the character in a long time (Batman crowd, looking at you); though it may be less satisfying to the hardcore fans, who already know why they love Big Blue.",4,"A Very Good Movie, Slowed By Poor Animation",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3891,"['Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'Man', 'Steel', 'most', 'daunting', 'foe', 'yet', 'public', 'opinion', 'era', 'where', 'realities', 'terrorism', 'global', 'strife', 'have', 'created', 'cynical', 'hardline', 'attitudes', 'concept', 'justice', 'Superman', 'idealistic', 'optimism', 'more', 'more', 'outdated', 'film', 'real-world', 'So', 'when', 'group', 'younger', 'super-powered', 'vigilantes', 'known', 'Elite', 'appear', 'scene', 'Superman', 'not', 'prepared', 'brutal', 'stance', 'criminals', 'resounding', 'public', 'approval', 'follows.The', 'greatest', 'super', 'hero', 'world', 'soon', 'discovers', 'changing', 'times', 'public', 'opinion', 'are', 'not', 'things', 'even', 'god-like', 'powers', 'can', 'control', 'Even', 'world', 'turning', 'away', 'Superman', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'win', 'back', 'support', 'humanity', 'Elite', 'do', 'something', 'truly', 'reckless', 'get', 'and/or', 'others', 'killed', 'process.Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'odd', 'entry', 'canon', 'DC', 'Universe', 'direct-to-DVD/Blu-ray', 'animated', 'features', 'one', 'hand', 'story', 'based', 'Action', 'Comics', 'storyline', 'What', 'So', 'Funny', 'Truth', 'Justice', 'American', 'Way', 'actually', 'one', 'most', 'timely', 'interesting', 'Superman', 'come', 'along', 'awhile', 'certainly', 'thematic', 'ground', 'examination', 'upcoming', 'feature-film', 'reboot', 'Man', 'Steel', 'will', 'attempt', 'do', 'next', 'year', 'story', 'animated', 'feature', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'comic', 'book', 'page', 'primarily', 'writer', 'comic', 'story', 'Joe', 'Kelly', 'also', 'wrote', 'animated', 'feature', 'version', 'plot-points', 'sketching', 'modern', 'world', 'how', 'Superman', 'idealism', 'outdated', 'edgy', 'anti-heroes', 'being', 'more', 'popular', 'classic', 'super', 'heroes', 'are', 'directly', 'addressing', 'questions', 'fanboys', 'average', 'people', 'alike', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'namely', 'why', 'Superman', 'still', 'matter', 'Elite', 'get', 'interesting', 'antagonist', 'not', 'really', 'evil', 'se', 'just', 'grittier', 'darker', 'classic', 'superhero', 'archetypes', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'healthy', 'debate', 'amongst', 'viewers', 'Elite', 'are', 'are', 'not', 'heroes', 'need', 'modern', 'times', 'not', 'Superman', 'dinosaur', 'claim', 'narrative', 'intriguing', 'well-told', 'visuals', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'leave', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'DC', 'Animation', 'long', 'been', 'praised', 'usually', 'comparison', 'Marvel', 'Animation', 'character', 'designs', 'animation', 'quality', 'film', 'had', 'fraction', 'usual', 'budget', 'DCU', 'animated', 'feature', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'cartoony', '1950s', 'comic', 'strip', 'sort', 'way', 'quality', 'movement', 'also', 'fairly', 'shoddy', 'entirely', 'noticeable', 'action', 'scenes', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'film', 'Superman', 'Nickelodeon', 'Version', 'even', 'dealing', 'mature', 'material', 'themes', 'Blu-ray', 'viewing', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'discrepancies', 'more', 'apparent.The', 'voicework', 'film', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Superman', 'being', 'voiced', 'George', 'Newbern', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'animated', 'Superman', 'Justice', 'League', 'days', 'early', '2000s', 'NCIS', 'star', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'pretty', 'good', 'go', 'playing', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Elite', 'are', 'suitably', 'voiced', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'including', 'voice', 'work', 'veteran', 'Robin', 'Atkin', 'Downes', 'who', 'group', 'leader', 'Manchester', 'Black', 'was', 'also', 'ship', 'computer', 'Prometheus', 'soccer', 'announcer', 'Battleship', 'done', 'voice', 'work', 'more', 'video', 'games', ""'m"", 'willing', 'count', '.All', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'Superman', 'flick', 'actually', 'interesting', 'watch', 'intellectual', 'reasons', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'away', 'terms', 'visual', 'splendor', 'action', 'sense', 'easy', 'recommend', 'who', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'connect', 'character', 'long', 'time', 'Batman', 'crowd', 'looking', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'satisfying', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'why', 'love', 'Big', 'Blue']",N/A

It had a good story, great flow, good voice acting, and fitting animation. This feels like a really strong episode of the Superman: Animated Series and should be viewed as such in terms of quality.The story is about how far the ""good guys"" should go to stop the ""bad guys"". Is throwing a criminal in jail so he can escape or make bail and hurt someone else a good solution, or should criminals be put out of action permanently? This story explores that question using Superman to support the former and the Elite, a new super group whose leader was trained by British Intelligence, to represent the latter argument. The story is very solid and moves at a nice pace. There are several parts where characters stop and give speeches to discuss the issue, but the speeches are short and to the point so they don't sound preachy. The plot is tight with no lags in story. There are not twists or surprises--the movie ends how you would expect it to.Several voices from Justice League were used and were welcome. The new voice for Lois Lane did not fit and seemed whiny compared to previous portrayals. Otherwise it was a solid cast.Many reviewers have attacked the animation as being to simple and low quality. The animation is simpler and slightly more cartoony than previous DC Animated Movies, but for good reason. The point of this movie was the idea and the message. To effectively convey that message, it needed to be the focus. Simpler animation allowed the story to take center stage instead of competing with it. And the style animated very smoothly and  nicely even if it was fairly simple. I think it'll just take time to grow on some fans.Overall I highly recommend this.

This movie takes place around the moral dilemma when it comes to the original golden age Superman of Earth-One (or at least I believe so in my opinion), and his high moral plane of authority. A new superhero squad calling themselves, the Elites, are making a stand against the Man of Steel saying that the villains of the world should be put down. While Superman of course is standing by how superheroes like themselves are not above the law and are certainly not executioners. That super heroes should lead by examples! You would think by just reading that, that everything would be leaned towards Superman's point of view, but quite frankly, both sides make very powerful and persuasive arguments. Now the Elite kind of come off as a-holes, which is to be expected from an anti-hero team, but yet again, the popular vote swings greatly in their favor rather than Superman's &#34;old ways of thinking&#34;. The theme is so embroidered into this movie that even the style of animation even exemplifies it, from Superman's old fashion big chin and barrel chest, to the Elite's slicker more modern as well as punk look.

1534215,A242H31I2UZ2QX,B007MCSV1O,"K ""K""","[2, 5]","A friend sent me an advanced copy of this b/c I'm not just a fan of Superman, I have always believed the things he stands for are important...and this film explores that.The comics story it's based upon explored it too, but this take was definitely sharper and smarter.I've not enjoyed virtually ANY of the previous WB/DC direct-to-DVD animated movies (Wonder Woman's ani movie being the only exception I can think of) -- their rampant misogyny and gratuitous violence aren't my cup of tea (I'm all for an actioner, but I like it with a side of intelligence). Virtually every past DC animated movie is the victim of poor writing and more plot holes than I can count (the recent Justice League: Doom movie being a perfect example). Also, in nearly every past film in which he's included, in order to make the story work, the writers/directors/producers make Superman a schm-ck whose powers are ignored (i.e., his super-hearing or super-speed) when they would interfere with the plot.This story has no misogyny, the violence is a necessary part of the story (and it's actually less gruesome than, say, Superman/Doomsday while making a point) There are only a few minor plot holes at the start (see below), and Superman almost always is using his powers to the fullest (again, see below).As others have said, the animation isn't the greatest, but if you're not a connoisseur, you likely won't notice; if you are, it's certainly clicky and uneven at times. This is par for the course for DC animated movies however. Character designs are also odd -- while Lois and some (but not all) other random female characters have a strong anime influence, none of the males have that kind of design (although action sequences are also anime-influenced).  Superman's design changes here and there ever so slightly -- but again, most won't notice these sorts of inconsistencies. And, overall, I like the design of him in this flick.It's also good to see the return of strong voiceover work -- if you were able to sit through more than a few minutes of Batman: Year One, between its hokey acting and incredibly bad animation, you deserve a medal of some kind. I was thrilled with the strong actors this go-round. George Newbern, the Superman of TV's Justice League cartoon is Supes/Clark Kent, and is in perfect form. NCIS's Pauley Perrette plays Lois, and while she's definitely good, her voice in no way fits the Lois character's design. It's actually jarring in most scenes, but I can't deny Perrette's talent.Also, if you're a fan of Chip Kidd's artwork, the fun titles sequence seems to be influenced by him and helps underscore the point of the story about the relevance of Superman and his ideals.If you've read the comics story this is based upon, the ending -- don't worry, NO spoilers here -- is far more clever (if not a little Superfriendsy/juvenile) and a little more FUN here. And Superman *should* be FUN. The comics version is very dark, and while I liked the ending in the comics, this takes the same basic idea from the comics' climax and turns it around in a really exciting way.Overall, highly recommended.And, finally, as alluded to above, here're some random questions that came to me in the first 25 mins or so (very minor spoilers ahead):- Why doesn't Clark hear trouble until it's right on top of him and Lois?- Why does Clark just stand there as a second person gets killed in front of him before he decides to run into an alley to change?- How is it even possible Superman didn't spot a guy crouching in the bleachers (and who, albeit sotto voce, goes ""Huh!"" at one point) at the U.N.? I'd think of all places he'd be on the look out for trouble, that'd be it.- In a foreign country, Superman again stands around (er, in mid-air) while watching a monster kill people without taking action/reacting immediately.Those things are the kinds of minor things which bug me that should NOT have gotten past professional writers, producers, directors, etc. However, to this movie's credit, there's just this small handful of issues. The last couple of DC movies I've seen (JL: Doom & another I can't even recall the name of w/Superman, Batman, and Supergirl) had endings which made no sense...and barely made sense throughout. So, again, this was a nice change of pace.",4,"Finally, an animated Superman who's not treated like a dolt",1339027200,"06 7, 2012",2012,4270,"['friend', 'sent', 'advanced', 'copy', 'b/c', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'fan', 'Superman', 'have', 'always', 'believed', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'film', 'that.The', 'comics', 'story', 'based', 'explored', 'too', 'take', 'was', 'definitely', 'sharper', 'smarter.I', ""'ve"", 'not', 'enjoyed', 'virtually', 'ANY', 'previous', 'WB/DC', 'direct-to-DVD', 'animated', 'movies', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'ani', 'movie', 'being', 'only', 'exception', 'can', 'think', 'rampant', 'misogyny', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'are', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', ""'m"", 'actioner', 'like', 'side', 'intelligence', 'Virtually', 'past', 'DC', 'animated', 'movie', 'victim', 'poor', 'writing', 'more', 'plot', 'holes', 'can', 'count', 'recent', 'Justice', 'League', 'Doom', 'movie', 'being', 'perfect', 'example', 'Also', 'nearly', 'past', 'film', 'included', 'order', 'make', 'story', 'work', 'writers/directors/producers', 'make', 'Superman', 'schm-ck', 'powers', 'are', 'ignored', 'i.e.', 'super-hearing', 'super-speed', 'when', 'would', 'interfere', 'plot.This', 'story', 'misogyny', 'violence', 'necessary', 'part', 'story', 'actually', 'less', 'gruesome', 'say', 'Superman/Doomsday', 'making', 'point', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'minor', 'plot', 'holes', 'start', 'see', 'Superman', 'almost', 'always', 'using', 'powers', 'fullest', 'again', 'see', '.As', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'animation', ""n't"", 'greatest', ""'re"", 'not', 'connoisseur', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'are', 'certainly', 'clicky', 'uneven', 'times', 'par', 'course', 'DC', 'animated', 'movies', 'however', 'Character', 'designs', 'are', 'also', 'odd', 'Lois', 'not', 'other', 'random', 'female', 'characters', 'have', 'strong', 'anime', 'influence', 'none', 'males', 'have', 'kind', 'design', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'also', 'anime-influenced', 'Superman', 'design', 'changes', 'here', 'there', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'again', 'most', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'sorts', 'inconsistencies', 'overall', 'like', 'design', 'flick.It', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'return', 'strong', 'voiceover', 'work', 'were', 'able', 'sit', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'Batman', 'Year', 'One', 'hokey', 'acting', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'animation', 'deserve', 'medal', 'kind', 'was', 'thrilled', 'strong', 'actors', 'go-round', 'George', 'Newbern', 'Superman', 'TV', 'Justice', 'League', 'cartoon', 'Supes/Clark', 'Kent', 'perfect', 'form', 'NCIS', 'Pauley', 'Perrette', 'Lois', 'definitely', 'good', 'voice', 'way', 'Lois', 'character', 'design', 'actually', 'jarring', 'most', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Perrette', 'talent.Also', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Chip', 'Kidd', 'artwork', 'fun', 'sequence', 'be', 'influenced', 'underscore', 'point', 'story', 'relevance', 'Superman', 'ideals.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comics', 'story', 'based', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'NO', 'spoilers', 'here', 'far', 'more', 'clever', 'not', 'little', 'Superfriendsy/juvenile', 'little', 'more', 'FUN', 'here', 'Superman', '*should*', 'be', 'FUN', 'comics', 'version', 'very', 'dark', 'liked', 'ending', 'comics', 'same', 'basic', 'idea', 'comics', 'climax', 'around', 'really', 'exciting', 'way.Overall', 'highly', 'recommended.And', 'finally', 'alluded', 'above', 'here', ""'re"", 'random', 'questions', 'came', 'first', '25', 'mins', 'so', 'very', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Clark', 'hear', 'trouble', 'right', 'top', 'Lois', 'Why', 'Clark', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'second', 'person', 'killed', 'front', 'run', 'alley', 'change', 'How', 'even', 'possible', 'Superman', 'did', ""n't"", 'spot', 'guy', 'crouching', 'bleachers', 'who', 'sotto', 'voce', 'Huh', 'one', 'point', 'U.N.', ""'d"", 'think', 'places', ""'d"", 'be', 'look', 'out', 'trouble', ""'d"", 'be', 'it.-', 'foreign', 'country', 'Superman', 'again', 'er', 'mid-air', 'watching', 'monster', 'kill', 'people', 'taking', 'action/reacting', 'immediately.Those', 'things', 'are', 'kinds', 'minor', 'things', 'bug', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'gotten', 'past', 'professional', 'writers', 'producers', 'directors', 'etc', 'However', 'movie', 'credit', 'just', 'small', 'handful', 'issues', 'last', 'couple', 'DC', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'JL', 'Doom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'name', 'w/Superman', 'Batman', 'Supergirl', 'had', 'endings', 'made', 'sense', 'barely', 'made', 'sense', 'So', 'again', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace']",N/A
1534216,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B007MCSV1O,K. Ostrowski,"[1, 2]","First, a word of warning.  This film is rated PG-13 for a reason.  Do -not- show it to young children.  Apart from the violence and sexual innuendos in the film, most children just wouldn't understand the message, and would probably find it too terrifying as well; especially near the end.The history of the development of this story doesn't really take long to explain.  Back at the end of the 90s, and the start of the new millennium, a comic book was published (oddly by DC, under the Wildstorm imprint,) called ""the Authority.""  The series was essentially about a group of self-centered, gang-like, deeply amoral jerks with superpowers, who nonetheless fight crime and protect the Earth, but also take it upon themselves to act as judge, jury and executioner, even over whole governments.The series became rather popular when it was first published, and in response, in March 2001, a comic book was published (Action Comics 775,) called ""What's so Funny About Truth, Justice and the American Way?""  In this comic, Superman does battle with a group called ""The Elite;"" who are very much like the Authority in most respects.  The comic's premise refuted (I think, quite successfully,) the ethical standpoint of the ""Authority"" books, and reaffirmed the reasons that Superman has always had for his devotion to truth and justice.  The book sold wonderfully, though it wasn't -universally- liked, largely because there are people out there who just don't like Superman, and never will, regardless of how well he's written.I hate to say it, but I think a fair number of people will claim to dislike the movie for this reason alone.  Some people just don't like Superman, and they want him to lose, and suffer along the way.  Needless to say, I'm not convinced by this viewpoint, and I don't think I ever will be, though I admit, some of the Superman films have made it awfully hard to like him at times.The premise of this movie is that the Elite; (a lizard-like woman named Menagerie who can produce powerful, destructive slugs/snakes/bugs from her body, an electric-powered tough guy named Coldcast, a drunken magician named Hat, and their leader; a powerful psychic called Manchester Black,) appear and assist Superman in stopping a rampaging monster.  However, Superman doesn't trust them, because they seem to enjoy hurting people, and soon, the elite set themselves up as judge, jury and executioner, claiming to act outside of, and above, any legal body.  This, of course, leads to a conflict between them and Superman, when they begin to murder people for their crimes.  However, he has a hard time fighting them, not just because of their power, but because the world at large seems to prefer the Elite, and enjoy watching them work.Spoilers for the next paragraph.Superman's solution is ultimately to pretend to adopt the philosophy of the Elite, and he defeats them, one by one, in a way that looks as if he were killing them ruthlessly.  When people react to this in horror, he reminds them that they're reacting that way because murder shouldn't be used as a weapon of justice; that a better way needs to be found, and that, after all, the old Superman's philosophy was the correct one.  He then reveals that it was all a trick, and that he didn't really kill anyone.I certainly agree with Superman that murder is not a viable moral option in solving our problems.  Even if we're under attack, if we have the chance to disable our enemies without killing them, we should take it.  Killing is moral, only in instances where you are legitimately defending someone's life, and killing is the only way to do so.  Murder, however, is never justified; even in legitimate defense.Superman gets some good lines in this movie, about how we can't just toss morality in the garbage because it's inconvenient, and how we need to all be working, not just for the crushing of evil, but for good.  These are all important moral lessons.Sadly, such lessons often lose much of their force in the modern world, which has rejected all of the tried and true moral lists (such as the Ten Commandments,) and if you don't have a -list- of what's moral and what isn't, how can you tell when a person is being immoral?It could also be said that there's something not quite kosher about Superman deceiving the people of the Earth about what he was really up to.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it was -immoral,- but it's a little awkward, for someone who claims to represent truth first.On the whole, though, I enjoyed this movie, and I thought it was much needed, in this age of amoral selfishness and moral relativism.  It's just sad to see so many people treating it as just another chess piece in the hand of their opponent, rather than actually listening to what it says.",4,"A Mature Storyline, Reaffirming the Values of Superman in the Most Graphic Way",1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,4762,"['First', 'word', 'warning', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'reason', 'Do', '-not-', 'show', 'young', 'children', 'Apart', 'violence', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'film', 'most', 'children', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'message', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'too', 'terrifying', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'end.The', 'history', 'development', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'long', 'explain', 'Back', 'end', '90s', 'start', 'new', 'millennium', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'oddly', 'DC', 'Wildstorm', 'imprint', 'called', 'Authority', 'series', 'was', 'essentially', 'group', 'self-centered', 'gang-like', 'deeply', 'amoral', 'jerks', 'superpowers', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'fight', 'crime', 'protect', 'Earth', 'also', 'take', 'act', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'even', 'whole', 'governments.The', 'series', 'became', 'rather', 'popular', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'response', 'March', '2001', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'Action', 'Comics', '775', 'called', 'What', 'so', 'Funny', 'Truth', 'Justice', 'American', 'Way', 'comic', 'Superman', 'battle', 'group', 'called', 'Elite', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'Authority', 'most', 'respects', 'comic', 'premise', 'refuted', 'think', 'quite', 'successfully', 'ethical', 'standpoint', 'Authority', 'books', 'reaffirmed', 'reasons', 'Superman', 'always', 'had', 'devotion', 'truth', 'justice', 'book', 'sold', 'wonderfully', 'was', ""n't"", '-universally-', 'liked', 'largely', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Superman', 'never', 'will', 'regardless', 'how', 'well', 'written.I', 'hate', 'say', 'think', 'fair', 'number', 'people', 'will', 'claim', 'dislike', 'movie', 'reason', 'alone', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Superman', 'want', 'lose', 'suffer', 'way', 'Needless', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'viewpoint', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'admit', 'Superman', 'films', 'have', 'made', 'awfully', 'hard', 'like', 'times.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'Elite', 'lizard-like', 'woman', 'named', 'Menagerie', 'who', 'can', 'produce', 'powerful', 'destructive', 'slugs/snakes/bugs', 'body', 'electric-powered', 'tough', 'guy', 'named', 'Coldcast', 'drunken', 'magician', 'named', 'Hat', 'leader', 'powerful', 'psychic', 'called', 'Manchester', 'Black', 'appear', 'assist', 'Superman', 'stopping', 'rampaging', 'monster', 'However', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'trust', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'hurting', 'people', 'soon', 'elite', 'set', 'up', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'claiming', 'act', 'above', 'legal', 'body', 'course', 'conflict', 'Superman', 'when', 'begin', 'murder', 'people', 'crimes', 'However', 'hard', 'time', 'fighting', 'not', 'just', 'power', 'world', 'large', 'prefer', 'Elite', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'work.Spoilers', 'next', 'paragraph.Superman', 'solution', 'ultimately', 'pretend', 'adopt', 'philosophy', 'Elite', 'one', 'one', 'way', 'were', 'killing', 'ruthlessly', 'When', 'people', 'react', 'horror', ""'re"", 'reacting', 'way', 'murder', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'used', 'weapon', 'justice', 'better', 'way', 'needs', 'be', 'found', 'old', 'Superman', 'philosophy', 'was', 'correct', 'one', 'then', 'was', 'trick', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'kill', 'anyone.I', 'certainly', 'agree', 'Superman', 'murder', 'not', 'viable', 'moral', 'option', 'solving', 'problems', 'Even', ""'re"", 'attack', 'have', 'chance', 'disable', 'enemies', 'killing', 'should', 'take', 'Killing', 'moral', 'only', 'instances', 'where', 'are', 'legitimately', 'defending', 'someone', 'life', 'killing', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'so', 'Murder', 'however', 'never', 'justified', 'even', 'legitimate', 'defense.Superman', 'good', 'lines', 'movie', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'toss', 'morality', 'garbage', 'inconvenient', 'how', 'need', 'be', 'working', 'not', 'just', 'crushing', 'evil', 'good', 'are', 'important', 'moral', 'lessons.Sadly', 'such', 'lessons', 'often', 'lose', 'much', 'force', 'modern', 'world', 'rejected', 'tried', 'true', 'moral', 'lists', 'such', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '-list-', 'what', 'moral', 'what', ""n't"", 'how', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'person', 'being', 'immoral', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'kosher', 'Superman', 'deceiving', 'people', 'Earth', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'was', '-immoral', 'little', 'awkward', 'someone', 'who', 'represent', 'truth', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'much', 'needed', 'age', 'amoral', 'selfishness', 'moral', 'relativism', 'just', 'sad', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'treating', 'just', 'chess', 'piece', 'hand', 'opponent', 'rather', 'actually', 'listening', 'what']",N/A

Superman vs the Elite is based off a darker side of comics where the Justice League was split by a belief that there are some criminals not worth trying to save.  This goes against everything Superman stands for and this movie is not only entertaining, it makes you think.  For all of us who are huge fans of DC comics and their animated adaptations I have to say this one is a definite keeper.  At first the Elite appear as a force to stand along side the Man of Steel and promote justice in all its forms, but over time the Elite's true nature appears, they believe they can be judge, jury, and executioner.  Superman wasn't meant to be political at first but the more the movie progresses the more political the plot seems to get, who is right?  The Elite say that people who commit heinous  crimes should be punished heinously, Superman says everyone deserves a chance for redemption, it's a harder road not to take these people out, it would be easier to skip due process, but due process is the right thing to do.  Superman believes he is a symbol to inspire people to become better than even they believe is possible.  In the end it appears Superman falls away from his principles and takes the Elite's stand, that sometimes you have to put the animals down...  Is this the end of the Man of Steel as we know him?

1534221,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B007MCSV1O,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 6]","I've always enjoyed comic author Warren Ellis' work.  His voice was new, jaded, and cynical - in a world where superheroes were black and white, Ellis was a dark shade of gray.  I collected issues of Stormwatch and Planetary, both of which reinforced Ellis' ethos: the inherent evil of corporations, a corrupt America, and a selfish nature of humanity.  This is the new world of superheroes: global, amoral, and casually violent with their power.  All of this is critical in appreciating ""Superman vs. the Elite,"" which is Joe Kelly's response to Ellis' jaded world view.  And what better vehicle to defend the American Way than with Superman?""Superman vs. the Elite"" is an animated version of the comic that answered this question, ""What's so Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?""  The Elite consists of superheroes that play at the level of Superman: super-psychic Manchester Black (Robin Atkin Downes), energy-absorbing bruiser Coldcast (Catero Colbert), oversexed bioform Menagerie (Melissa Disney), and monster-summoning magician The Hat (Andrew Kishino).  Black is a Brit (he wears a Union Jack shirt - actually, it's a tattoo!) who has little respect for anyone, including Superman.  But the methods of his Elite team soon become globally renowned for their methods against Bialyan ""terrorists.""It's not hard to see echoes of 9/11 and the War on Terror lurking on the fringes of this philosophical argument between justice and the ends justifying the means. Superman (George Newbern, reprising his role from the DC Animated Universe) at first tries to get along with these newcomers, leading them with tactics he's earned as a seasoned superhero. It doesn't last.The Elite believes in torture and murder to get the job done - and their methods are soon endorsed by the world in the face of endless war. It's not long before Superman is forced to defend first his ethos, then himself when psychotic villain the Atomic Skull (Dee Bradley Baker) escapes from a justice system Superman endorses, only to kill again.What makes ""Superman vs. The Elite"" so interesting is that it's not afraid to play on a higher level.  Superman endorses a cheesy cartoon because it spreads his message, just as The Elite ensure that their every move is telecast to the world. This is a war of ideas that just happens to be settled with fisticuffs.If you're not aware of the dichotomy between old and superhero styles, ""Superman vs. The Elite"" seems like a curious detour for an iconic character.  The Elite are powerful enough that it's hard to believe they've never crossed paths with Superman before.  But if you can accept that they're a foil for Superman to test his super-brand, this is a very compelling entry in a grim-and-gritty world defined by Batman ethics.",4,Deconstructing Warren Ellis,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,2763,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', 'comic', 'author', 'Warren', 'Ellis', 'work', 'voice', 'was', 'new', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'world', 'where', 'superheroes', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'Ellis', 'was', 'dark', 'shade', 'gray', 'collected', 'issues', 'Stormwatch', 'Planetary', 'reinforced', 'Ellis', 'ethos', 'inherent', 'evil', 'corporations', 'corrupt', 'America', 'selfish', 'nature', 'humanity', 'new', 'world', 'superheroes', 'global', 'amoral', 'casually', 'violent', 'power', 'critical', 'appreciating', 'Superman', 'Elite', 'Joe', 'Kelly', 'response', 'Ellis', 'jaded', 'world', 'view', 'what', 'better', 'vehicle', 'defend', 'American', 'Way', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'Elite', 'animated', 'version', 'comic', 'answered', 'question', 'What', 'so', 'Funny', 'Truth', 'Justice', 'American', 'Way', 'Elite', 'superheroes', 'play', 'level', 'Superman', 'super-psychic', 'Manchester', 'Black', 'Robin', 'Atkin', 'Downes', 'energy-absorbing', 'bruiser', 'Coldcast', 'Catero', 'Colbert', 'oversexed', 'bioform', 'Menagerie', 'Melissa', 'Disney', 'monster-summoning', 'magician', 'Hat', 'Andrew', 'Kishino', 'Black', 'Brit', 'Union', 'Jack', 'shirt', 'actually', 'tattoo', 'who', 'little', 'respect', 'anyone', 'including', 'Superman', 'methods', 'Elite', 'team', 'soon', 'become', 'globally', 'renowned', 'methods', 'Bialyan', 'terrorists', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'echoes', '9/11', 'War', 'Terror', 'lurking', 'fringes', 'philosophical', 'argument', 'justice', 'ends', 'justifying', 'means', 'Superman', 'George', 'Newbern', 'reprising', 'role', 'DC', 'Animated', 'Universe', 'first', 'tries', 'get', 'newcomers', 'leading', 'tactics', 'earned', 'seasoned', 'superhero', ""n't"", 'last.The', 'Elite', 'torture', 'murder', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'methods', 'are', 'soon', 'endorsed', 'world', 'face', 'endless', 'war', 'not', 'long', 'Superman', 'forced', 'defend', 'first', 'ethos', 'then', 'when', 'psychotic', 'villain', 'Atomic', 'Skull', 'Dee', 'Bradley', 'Baker', 'justice', 'system', 'Superman', 'only', 'kill', 'again.What', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'interesting', 'not', 'afraid', 'play', 'higher', 'level', 'Superman', 'cheesy', 'cartoon', 'message', 'just', 'Elite', 'ensure', 'move', 'telecast', 'world', 'war', 'ideas', 'just', 'be', 'settled', 'fisticuffs.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'aware', 'dichotomy', 'old', 'superhero', 'styles', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'curious', 'detour', 'iconic', 'character', 'Elite', 'are', 'powerful', 'enough', 'hard', 'believe', ""'ve"", 'never', 'crossed', 'paths', 'Superman', 'can', 'accept', ""'re"", 'foil', 'Superman', 'test', 'super-brand', 'very', 'compelling', 'entry', 'grim-and-gritty', 'world', 'defined', 'Batman', 'ethics']",N/A

In a way, however, it does not feel like a Superman movie at all.  I probably like this a bit more than All-Star Superman, but I still found it underwhelming.Superman/Clark and Lois are very likable in this film.  Superman especially is made very human in this which is the best thing about the movie.  In fact I will say that Superman is made more human and down to earth in this film then in any other movie or series since Superman TAS.  In the movie through the Elite (the villains of the film) Superman faces a great moral dilemma of whether his ideals still hold up in today's time or if his morality is outdated and no longer needed.  This is easily the best aspect of the film.  This is also a very personal story for Lois in whether she still has faith in Superman or not.  I also like how smart Superman is in the film, especially at the end.  People always say Superman is all brawn, but that is not the case.  Watch this movie or Superman TAS and you will see that Superman can be pretty smart when he needs to be.The voice cast does a great job here.  George Newborn, who voiced Superman in Justice League, reprises his role here and he is great.  Pauley Perrette voices Lois Lane here and she does a good job.  She is not my favorite Lois Lane, but she is far from the worst that I have seen.  The other voice actors did fine as well.  The voices for The Elite work well for the characters.However, I do have issues with the movie.  As I said earlier this does not really feel like a Superman film.  This film does not even feel like it takes place in the DC universe.  The film feels more like it takes place in Vertigo comics and they just chucked Superman in there.  The Elite themselves do not feel like villains Superman would fight.  They do not even seem like villains of the DC universe.  The movie does have Atomic Skull in it.  He and Superman himself are the only things that verify that this is a DC story.  Personally, I do not like The Elite as villains.  I like the moral conflict they present, but other than that I do not care for them.  I do not buy them as foes that would pose a huge challenge for Superman either.The art style of the film, like All-Star Superman, takes some getting used to.  To be honest I still do not care much for the art.  The animation is nice and the fights are fun to watch as usual.Overall out of all the Superman animated movies that have come out so far this one is probably the second best (in my opinion), but there is not much competition.  I like how human Superman is made here.  I also like the moral dilemma Superman is put in throughout the movie.  However, I am not a fan of the look of the film, or the Elite themselves.

It isn't long before The Elite are embraced by the public and Superman is looked at as being behind in the times, but naturally, things with The Elite aren't all what they seem, culminating in a violent showdown.  The script (adapted by comic writer Joe Kelly, who wrote the original comic story the film is based on) is smart and the film as a whole enjoyable, even if its animation is sub-par and the voice acting nothing too special compared to other animated DC Universe films.

I agree...they went big.  But the simplistic, disarming animation makes the overall presentation very palatable.  The production team is still the same as it was from the previous WB/DC releases..give or take..but the whole production of this project seemed different.  The animations in the last few cycles has been leaning more toward the mature.  ""Bat-man year one"" being the most recent example..but let's not forget Sinestro torturing an addict with drugs in ""Green Lantern First Flight""  Superman Vs. The Elite is by far the most mature film in the of them...and trust me..I'm a big fan..and got um all.I say it's mature because the character driven writing really asks the viewer to consider the situation...question morality.  It does what DC has been pushing toward which is to make Superman relevant and cool in the new era without abandoning the core of what Superman is.Now.  Like any work taken from a novel or in this case comic, then graphic novel.  It's hard to translate everything well..and somethings will be left out...and not everyone is going to be happy.  But Superman Vs. The Elite manages to capture the spirit of the source material, and translate it well visually in the time afforded.  At some points I wished for a better animated relation of the material...but in the end I was completely satisfied...and understand the passive delivery given the heavy subject matter.In this film Superman finds himself facing a band of super powered ""do gooders"" that don't have the moral restrictions of not killing, to inhibit their ""heroic"" behavior.  Superman find's himself in the minority and feels like an idea of yesteryear, and in moments of self doubt you see that he might be able to move faster than a speeding bullet...but he can not move faster than thought.  That is how fast Manchester black can move.  An orphan, ex secret agent Manchester Black has decided to go ""freelance"" and protect the world.  The dueling moralities meet in a story of slavery, homicide..and social and cognitive dissonance.  Easily the best Superman movie I've seen since Richard Donnor collaborated with Mario Puzzo.""people don't want baby sitters in spandex to spank them when they are bad.  They want surgeons to cut out thethe cancers that fester in us, and make sure they never come back."" - Manchester blackI don't want to give anything away...but basically...Superman Vs.

In fact, the Atomic Skull plays right into their hands, as Superman had fought the villain and had imprisoned him, only to see him escape and murder more innocent civilians before Manchester Black takes him out once and for all.These two visions of the world and of being a superhero collide as the Elite take on Superman, head to head, with the former willing to use deadly force to make their point. As Lois says in talking to Superman on the eve of the battle, &#34;I think they can beat you!... I'm sorry. But they're willing to go places you won't.&#34; I'm not going to go into the details of the battle or the outcome other than to say that it's a very satisfying and nail-biting fight and solution.The animation is decent, with the depictions of the Elite particularly effective. I was a bit less impressed with this version of Superman, whose massive chin detracted a bit. The voice acting was superb, with great performances from George Newbern (Superman) and Robin Atkin Downes (Manchester Black).

1534240,AJ4TG9LNSB0Y4,B007MCSV1O,"Robert M. ""Professional Nerd""","[2, 2]","I just took a look at a relatively recent animated Superman film, Superman vs. The Elite. I am very glad I did. This has been, without a doubt, one of the best Superman media in recent years, and one of the best representations of the character that I have ever seen.The plot of this animated feature is based on one particular issue of the comic series, and a relatively recent one at that. Taken from Action Comics #775, ""Whatever Happened to Truth, Justice, and the American Way?"", written by Joe Kelly back in 2001. Kelly himself wrote the adaptation, so he pretty much gives his approval on the faithfulness of that adaptation since he did himself. The plot of this film (and by extension, the comic book on which it is based) is that Superman must deal with this new team of superhuman antiheroes called the Elite. The elite are led by Manchester Black, who has telekinetic and telepathic abilities. The other members are Coldcast, who can manipulate electromagnetic energy; the Hat, who possesses a magical hat from which he can summon demons and other things; and Menagerie, who has access to some sort of symbiotic alien life form that summon and control alien creatures from her body. The Elite are of the persuasion that superheroes who simply turn in criminals to prison, as opposed to killing them outright, are being too soft on evil, with Superman being the metaphorical embodiment of this ideology. To this end, the Elite make use of lethal force when combating their enemies, in direct opposition to Superman and his methods. The world, it seems, are on the side of the Elite, and they want more permanent solutions to problems like criminals and violence. Superman begins to question his place in the world, and whether or not his ideals are outdated in an ever-changing world. A climactic showdown is imminent, of both powers and ideologies, as the Elite prove a formidable test of not only Superman's abilities, but also the very core of his morals.This film has great art direction and style. It is very similar to what we've seen before from the DCAU, but distinctive enough for its own look. Superman, for the most part, looks pretty good, although, his massive chin makes him look like genetic fusion of Jay Leno and Bruce Campbell. The voice cast, as is per the norm with DC in general and these animated pictures, his stellar, and a mix of the old and the new. George Newbern returns as the Man of Steel, back from the Justice League animated series. As here as it was there, Newbern can perfectly convey both Superman's authority and strength with his human vulnerability. Another returning DCAU alum, David Kaufman as Jimmy Olsen also does good, although he only gets a few throwaway lines. Pauley Perrette (whom you may recognize as Abby from NCIS) acts as a good replacement for Dana Delany, conveying both the sternness and caring of Lois Lane/Kent. Robin Atkin Downes also does really well as Manchester Black. His English accent is sick, but not to the point of being not understandable, although I will admit that a few of the British idioms that he used went over my head, but that's not a big deal. The rest of the cast does pretty good as well, with some people I haven't heard of, and other veteran voice actors like Dee Bradley Baker, Tara Strong, and Fred Tatasciore.The opening credits have an interesting feel. It's a montage of old-time Superman footage (like from the Ruby-Spears cartoons and even the George Reeves serials) against 1980s pop-culture art like that of Roy Lichtenstein. We gives a very appropriate introduction of both the home watch two and a critique of ideas of an older time. There is also footage of a cartoon-within-a-cartoon that seems very much in the style of Rocky & Bullwinkle that depicts a clich&eacute;d interpretation of Superman. It serves to open the debate of a simplistic viewpoint versus reality and how to deal with the evils of that reality. Shortly thereafter, Superman battles Atomic Skull (the Joseph Martin version, for the other nerds like me who actually care about that sort of minutiae), and instead of killing him, Superman sends him back to prison at Stryker's Island (the Metropolis super prison version of real-life New York's Riker's Island) rather than kill him. Superman then gives a press conference at the United Nations. This scene in particular is done well because it furthers and demonstrates the central ideological conflict of this film, that is should superheroes that possess sufficient power right out kill criminals and other evil people and take along to their own hands as opposed to allowing the legal system to determine and levy punishment. Superman claims he is not judge, nor jury, nor executioner of anyone. This is a brilliant discussion of Superman's principles and what he stands for and represents both to his fictional world and to our real world.Not long after, Superman encounters the Elite. The introductory scene of the elite is good, in that it shows that the Elite are both morally ambiguous and dangerous to those whom they considered to be against them. At first, it seems the Elite are Superman's allies, and they help him with a terrorist incident in England. The story that Manchester Black gives about his origins serves its purpose in being sympathetic, although it does seem fairly standard ""tragic childhood backstory"" for comic books. It quickly becomes apparent that not only are the Elite willing to use lethal force against their foes, they embrace it. This confrontation reaches a head during a battle between the fictional nations of Bialya and Pokolistan (which I assume to be real-world analogies to nations like Israel and Palestine, or essentially any other extreme regime from the volatile nations of that region). I admit that this part of the film seems a little odd, in the sense that the weapons that these two nations use seem particularly bizarre unrealistic. However they don't fully break my suspension of disbelief because I am familiar with this sort of thing and it's fairly normal for comic book stories. In particular, it seems reminiscent of the extreme science fiction of the Silver Age. Shortly after that confrontation, the Elite challenge Superman to a final fight, to cement their assertion of their ideology over Superman's. I won't give away the details of the climax nor the ending, but I will say that this climactic battle is legitimately intense and actually frightening in some aspects. The film will get those were not familiar with this story to believe the things that they are seeing on screen.Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed is that there is a great dynamic between Clark Kent/Superman and Lois. At this point in the history of the comic books, they had been married for some time, and it shows here. They have good ""couple banter"" and Lois serves as a good confidant in Superman's life and to balance his alter ego.For the most part, the DVD extras are very good. There is an interview with the writer, Joe Kelly, about his original comic book story and the characters of the Elite. He explains each one well and also he goes into more detail of the other comic book stories that they featured in. There is also a brilliant documentary that serves as a sort of philosophical treatise on the methodology and ideology of Superman and his role in both his fictional world in our real world. They bring in various experts from various fields to discuss this idea both in context of the story and the realities of the real world. It fits brilliantly in with my overall feeling of this film and that it perfectly captures the character of Superman. Also as per the norm with these DC animated films, there are a few selected episodes of Superman: The Animated Series, although I may be mistaken, but I think one of them may have appeared before on a previous film release. Nonetheless, they're both good episodes. There are also standard trailers. What negative thing I will say about the DVD extras is that it advertises a digital comic version of the original issue that the story is based on, but in only offers a preview of a few pages towards the end of the story. I was disappointed in this; I was expecting the full issue, but I was let down in that regard.Overall, I love this film. The animation and voice direction are superb, but what really nails it down is the story and the moral weight it carries. It is a brilliant discussion of Superman's morality, and the place it holds in our national conscience. This film perfectly understands the character of Superman, something that I find a welcome reprieve when another recent live-action film, which shall remain unnamed, completely failed to do this, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this to all fans of Superman and comics in general. This is the real Superman, and no other film that I've seen with him in it perfectly captures what it means to be the Man of Steel like this film does.",5,A perfect representation of the Man of

1534243,AOFC8T8U7WUGV,B007MCSV1O,Roland,"[4, 6]","This is the question asked by this new movie from DC Comics and Warner Premiere: ""Superman vs The Elite"". Based on the comics' story, ""What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way"" by writer Joe Kelly (2001), the relevance (or lack of) Superman is examined in the light of modern day America, times and thinking--not 1938's. Do Superman and his moral values still count for anything in today's day and age? How about in the comic book world? Especially in light of more modern, grittier characters such as Wolverine and The Punisher.*Spoilers Ahead*The movie starts out with the ""Superman status quo."" He's the hero, maybe can sometimes come off as a bit cheesy...especially with a new Superman public service cartoon (a not so subtle dig at the old ""Superfriends"" series) he's promoting...but nevertheless, he's still America's number one hero. And, kids and adults alike love him.Things quickly change.From across the pond, a quartet of new superheroes show up in Metropolis: These British ""Heroes"" call themselves The Elite. Led by Manchester Black (trenchcoat, union jack tee, ever-present cigarette in the corner of his mouth--yeah, he *does* look pretty damn cool) these MI-5 special agents make use of psychokinetic, as well as superhuman strength, in quickly going about Superman's business of ""protecting"" the world...in a darker, grittier way.The Elite do not care about collateral damage--just getting the job done. Yes, this means killing the bad guys, too.As you may expect, The Elite are an overnight sensation (with a great backstory I won't give away here). People quickly drop Superman and cheer for them. They're cool, hip, and get the job done ""right"" the first time...permanently. Why waste time ""capturing and recapturing the same bad guy over and over? We get the job done the first time?""What's worse, Superman isn't a match for them. At first, The Man of Steel tries to play nice and get them to see his side of things (""having morals is *always* relevant), but when this route doesn't work, Superman's powers don't, either. Manchester Black, psycho-kinetically, is Superman's match...and he's got a team to back him up. Protect Metropolis? They're going to ""protect"" the world; even going as far--despite Superman's pleading with them to stop--as to get involved in wars overseas.All of this sets the stage for a final showdown in Metropolis, with the whole world watching via satellite relays .Before the battle begins, Superman has one request: Let's take it outside. ""I don't want spectators getting hurt."" The Elite agree and warp all of them into space--bringing the satellite relays with them so everyone on earth can still watch.Superman is in over is head...he has virtually no offense at all in this four-on-one fight, and, with blood coming out of every visible orifice, he gets crushed into atoms.Remember the old saying, ""You don't step on Superman's cape?""The world is in shock and disbelief. But then, out of the blue (sorry) a whirlwind forms. You hear Superman's voice emanating from within it thanking the Elite for showing him the ""error of his ways."" He then proceeds to QUICKLY kill all of The Elite except for Manchester Black--who flees back to Metropolis and surrounds himself with a psychokinetic force field.It doesn't do him any good.On literally a world stage, Superman attacks with a vengeance.  Without giving thought to person or property, Superman rampages through Metropolis, quickly smashes through Manchester's force field...and to the horror of literally *everyone* on earth, he prepares to deliver the final blow.He doesn't deliver it.Turns out, to the relief of everybody, Superman didn't kill anyone (shame on you for thinking he had). With help from a few ""friends"", all of the spectators *and*  all of the members of The Elite are alive and well.It also turns out that The Elite were never a match for Superman. He took a few ""beatings"" while analyzing their respective strengths and weaknesses...and came up with quite a clever plan for defeating them (watch the movie!).Finally, is Superman relevant? This movies answers the question with a resounding YES! Superman will always be relevant: whether it's today, or way back in 1938 (a very gritty time in its own right), or even 2138. I encourage you to give this movie a try--it is the best animated feature to come from DC with only one exception: ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"".Five Stars.DVD NOTESThe voice cast is exceptional. George Newbern and ""NCIS's"" Pauley Perrette are spot-on with their portrayals of Superman and Lois Lane; I hope they will continue to voice the characters in future Superman releases. Robin Aktin Downes all but steals the show with his portrayal of Manchester Black. I hope we will see him again, reprising this character. Also look for ""Metal Gear Solid's"" Paul Eiding, and ""Uncharted's"" Nathan Drake himself, Nolan North.Written by Joe Kelly. Directed by Michael Chang.My disc also includes a ""sneak peak"" at DC's next upcoming animated feature: ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Part 1"", and a photo gallery from the wildly anticipated ""Dark Knight Rises"".From the dvd case: WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A ""MATTED"" WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL TELEVISION EXHIBITION.

The basic premise is a philosophical debate/battle between Superman and a ""Squadron Supreme""-style knock off of Warren Ellis' The Authority.  Mimicking Ellis' ""Under New Management"" Stories in The Authority, The Elite want to use their powers to run the world, quickly and brutally kill the bad guys, and bully nations into following their directives.The first problem is that The Elite are an-all-too-pale knock off of The Authority. So it becomes a bit of a strawman argument instead of a debate between equals. The characters are not likable or engaging. But we do get to hear the word ""wanker"" a lot and the word ""ass"" even more. Hey, it's PG 13, so why not? Because it's Superman, people! Language!The second big annoyance is that Superman himself is not even a little bit consistent with his ideals in the way he fights for them, nor is he sensible, thoughtful, mature ... or anything you would expect Superman, the old hand at superheroics to be. Supposedly, he is letting everyone think he has gone to the ""dark side"" in order to then teach a lesson about NOT going to the dark side. It makes about as much sense as Batman in The Dark Knight deciding he has to let the world think he is a murderer and a terrorist so people won't lose faith by finding out Harvey Dent is a killer and a psycho. Huh?All indications and comments seem to suggest that Superman's Justice League team-mates do exist in some form in this version of things. Yet, when their superfriend is apparently being killed on worldwide TV, none of them are available to even try to help. Are they all on vacation? Taking a personal day? Bad hair day?The worst thing about Superman vs The Elite is that it is just so, so much weaker in every way than the Bruce Timm, Paul Dini version of Superman seen in Justice League, Superman: The Animated Series, and occasionally Batman and Batman Beyond. It has been almost ten years since that series, but it still far, far outshines this current effort by any standard by which you care to measure--except maybe most uses of the word ""wanker"".",1,This Superman not nearly as good as previous animated version.

Here you'll actually feel like the world can do well without Superman. The elite, a super-power team, enters the stage with a promise of world piece. Doing what Superman didn't do all this years: KILL the bad guys so they stop keep coming back for more chaos.For the fist time Superman will face his own believes and values, feeling that his outdated and outnumbered. But will he keep his goals or join The Elite? Watch the movie to find out!Many people complained about the animation. Well imo it was excellent! The fight scenes and the background were very good drawn same with the character designs. My only little problem was that in some scenes Superman had a big chin. I think they made it this way so you'll feel that superman is outdated and as the story progress you'll be cheering for the Man of Steel.So i just want to say to all Supermans and Dc fans out there to givi this a try.

I haven't bought a Superman comic since 1993.2) I am by no means a fan boy. 90% of what I know about Superman comes from DC movies and the Superman animated series from the late 90's.Now I consider myself a fan of the DC animated features, in fact I own most of them. I can honestly say I haven't run across one I regretted purchasing before I had seen it. Superman vs. The Elite is teetering on that line. The voice acting wasn't great, I felt like Perry White was someone doing an impression of J.K. Simmons playing J. Jonah Jameson from spider-man. Lois was so far off the mark that I don't even know where to begin. Everything about her just felt wrong, the voice, the attitude, the fact that she didn't even feel like the Lois Lane I know. If I had to pick the one thing that bothered me most about this movie it would be Lois. She just doesn't fit. Superman himself isn't terrible, the voice was believable, but overall this Superman just felt like he'd pretty much given up. He did more whining than I'd expect from an invulnerable man who can toss railroad cars around like they're toys.The animation is sub-par as far as what I've come to expect from the DC animated features. Not nearly as good as All Star Superman, Green Lantern First Flight or Justice League: Doom. It felt kinda cheap and half hearted, almost as if they decided to take the animation team from the animated series and said ""make us a movie with just a little more detail than you do on the show"".So what was good? Well the story itself was pretty decent. Done right Superman vs. The Elite could have been great, but the shortcomings in the animation and voice acting don't do justice to the story. Although, it was fun. I mean it's hard not to enjoy a cartoon about super powered people doing what they do.All in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but just not as good as others I've seen. If you're considering buying this one, I'd say pass on it and go pick up All Star Superman or Justice League Doom.Bottom line, if I had it to do over again, I'd have waited and picked up Superman vs. The Elite when I saw it on netflix or at redbox.",3,Elite isn't how I'd describe this movie,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,2192,"['read', 'please', 'remember', 'following:1', ""'m"", 'not', 'comics', 'reader', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'Superman', 'comic', '1993.2', 'am', 'fan', 'boy', '90', '%', 'what', 'know', 'Superman', 'DC', 'movies', 'Superman', 'animated', 'series', 'late', ""90's.Now"", 'consider', 'fan', 'DC', 'animated', 'features', 'fact', 'own', 'most', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'run', 'one', 'regretted', 'purchasing', 'had', 'seen', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'teetering', 'line', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'felt', 'Perry', 'White', 'was', 'someone', 'doing', 'impression', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'playing', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'spider-man', 'Lois', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'mark', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'Everything', 'just', 'felt', 'wrong', 'voice', 'attitude', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'know', 'had', 'pick', 'one', 'thing', 'bothered', 'most', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Lois', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'voice', 'was', 'believable', 'Superman', 'just', 'felt', ""'d"", 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'up', 'did', 'more', 'whining', ""'d"", 'expect', 'invulnerable', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'toss', 'railroad', 'cars', ""'re"", 'toys.The', 'animation', 'sub-par', 'as', 'far', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'DC', 'animated', 'features', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'Star', 'Superman', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'First', 'Flight', 'Justice', 'League', 'Doom', 'felt', 'kinda', 'cheap', 'half', 'hearted', 'almost', 'decided', 'take', 'animation', 'team', 'animated', 'series', 'said', 'make', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'do', 'show', '.So', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'Well', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'Done', 'right', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'shortcomings', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'story', 'was', 'fun', 'mean', 'hard', 'not', 'enjoy', 'cartoon', 'super', 'powered', 'people', 'doing', 'what', 'do.All', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'others', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'considering', 'buying', 'one', ""'d"", 'say', 'pass', 'go', 'pick', 'up', 'Star', 'Superman', 'Justice', 'League', 'Doom.Bottom', 'line', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', ""'d"", 'have', 'waited', 'picked', 'up', 'Superman', 'vs', 'Elite', 'when', 'saw', 'netflix', 'redbox']",N/A

1534253,A1QRXEM0WSLGT5,B007MCSV1O,The Man With No Name,"[0, 1]","----------------------------------------Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------**Brief Review of Film**Bought this from FYE last week.  My copy came with a full sized poster as well!!!  14.99 for the price, a fair amount in my opinion.  12.99 would have been better.  Anywho...I had some concerns with this film even before I popped it into my aging DVD player.  Number one, for a long while the listed run time of this film was like 57 minutes.  NOT EVEN AN HOUR!!!  Well, DC seems to have fixed this and added in some more footage, bringing the elapsed time to 74 minutes, better but still not perfect.I was also concerned about Superman having the chin of Jay Leno.  I know he's supposed to have a chiseled jaw, but come on.  Well, you get used to his unique appearance after about 10 minutes, so this is not a big deal either.**Some Spoilers Ahead**The film centers around Superman and his encounter with The Elite.  The Elite are a group of fledging superheros who want to fight the bad guys as well.  The only difference is they don't take prisoners, they down right KILL the bad guys.This film really does delve into the philosphy of most superheroes.  Pummel the villians and send them to prison.  They break out, kill more people and cause even more damage, the good guys beat them up again and re-send them to prison, where they break out again...  The point being is that if you simply ended them, you would be sparing many people a lot of potential suffering.  This concept is one we face here in real life.  People to this day argue over the death penalty, is assassinating terrorists right, etc.  This animated movie is kind of like our current times meets a comic strip, and it's not funny in the least.Should bad people just be killed, no trial, no jurys?  The Elite certainly think so.  Of course Superman is appauled by this and wants them to turn themselves in to be judged for their crimes.  Here's the funny part, we the people are fine with The Elite killing, in fact we applaud them for it.  Just as people stormed the White House fence and cheered for hours after Osama Bin Laden was executed, people cheer for The Elite after they bring down villians.Eventually Superman and The Elite come to a show-down.  How can Superman (who doesn't kill) stand a chance against an entire team of ""superheroes"" who do it like it was breathing?--Pros Of Movie--Good thought provoking story/premise.  Some characters I've never seen before.  Film shows the pros/cons of both Superman's methods of justice AND the Elite's.--Cons Of Movie--Superman is not very powerful in this movie.  He gets his ass kicked pretty well and bleeds quite a bit.  He's missing his left eyelids at the end of the movie for crying out loud!!!  While violence and blood are not bad things in cinema, I am not used to seeing Superman this beat up.Back stories of The Elite are not delved into enough.  In fact only Manchester Black gets his back story looked into, and briefly at that.  How did the rest of the team get their powers?Film is too short.  Not enough time to hash things out.Also animation was a bit crude for my taste, not worthy of being labeled film quality.--In Conclusion--Overall a great film, not perfect, but still really good.  I will definitely be watching this again soon.  A film that not only delivers punches, but makes you wonder as well, wonder about what really is the right way to handle evil.Also, FYI there is a bonus feature.  A featurette that gives you a preview of DC's next release.  They are bringing 'Return of the Dark Knight' to film!!!  Peter Weller (Robot Cop) is voicing the aging Batman!!!  The movie is going to be released in 2 parts, meaning it will not be light on content!!!  Fall 2012 is the apx release for Part 1.  I can't wait, I am shoving money into my PC's disk drive right now, trying to reserve myself a copy.  Good things on the horizon for us the fanboys...Only one last gripe with DC Comics.  I love 'Batman' & 'Superman' as much as the next guy or gal, but come on, you've got other characters.  You have other wells to tap into.  Is it too much to ask for a 'Deadman' animated movie?  How about 'Etrigan The Demon'?  The 'Spectre'?  Give us something fresh and new, PLEASE!!!All right, I'm off my soap box now.  Now go check out 'Superman Vs The Elite'.",4,To Kill Or Not To Kill...,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,4556,"['Public', 'service', 'announcement', 'begin', 'review', 'Toonami', 'back', 'Airs', 'Saturday', 'Midnight', 'well', 'technically', 'Sunday', '12:00', 'a.m.', '3:00', 'a.m.', 'encore', 'beginning', '3:00', 'a.m.', '6:00', 'a.m', 'Tune', 'support', 'Now', 'review.', '**Brief', 'Review', 'Film**Bought', 'FYE', 'last', 'week', 'copy', 'came', 'full', 'sized', 'poster', 'as', 'well', '14.99', 'price', 'fair', 'amount', 'opinion', '12.99', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Anywho', 'had', 'concerns', 'film', 'even', 'popped', 'aging', 'DVD', 'player', 'Number', 'one', 'long', 'listed', 'run', 'time', 'film', 'was', '57', 'minutes', 'NOT', 'EVEN', 'AN', 'HOUR', 'Well', 'DC', 'have', 'fixed', 'added', 'more', 'footage', 'bringing', 'elapsed', 'time', '74', 'minutes', 'better', 'still', 'not', 'perfect.I', 'was', 'also', 'concerned', 'Superman', 'having', 'chin', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'know', 'supposed', 'have', 'chiseled', 'jaw', 'come', 'Well', 'get', 'used', 'unique', 'appearance', '10', 'minutes', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'either', '**Some', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead**The', 'film', 'centers', 'Superman', 'encounter', 'Elite', 'Elite', 'are', 'group', 'fledging', 'superheros', 'who', 'want', 'fight', 'bad', 'guys', 'well', 'only', 'difference', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'prisoners', 'down', 'right', 'KILL', 'bad', 'guys.This', 'film', 'really', 'delve', 'philosphy', 'most', 'superheroes', 'Pummel', 'villians', 'send', 'prison', 'break', 'out', 'kill', 'more', 'people', 'cause', 'even', 'more', 'damage', 'good', 'guys', 'beat', 'up', 'again', 're-send', 'prison', 'where', 'break', 'out', 'again', 'point', 'being', 'simply', 'ended', 'would', 'be', 'sparing', 'many', 'people', 'lot', 'potential', 'suffering', 'concept', 'one', 'face', 'here', 'real', 'life', 'People', 'day', 'death', 'penalty', 'assassinating', 'terrorists', 'right', 'etc', 'animated', 'movie', 'kind', 'current', 'times', 'comic', 'strip', 'not', 'funny', 'least.Should', 'bad', 'people', 'just', 'be', 'killed', 'trial', 'jurys', 'Elite', 'certainly', 'think', 'so', 'course', 'Superman', 'appauled', 'turn', 'be', 'judged', 'crimes', 'Here', 'funny', 'part', 'people', 'are', 'fine', 'Elite', 'killing', 'fact', 'applaud', 'Just', 'people', 'stormed', 'White', 'House', 'fence', 'cheered', 'hours', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'executed', 'people', 'cheer', 'Elite', 'bring', 'down', 'villians.Eventually', 'Superman', 'Elite', 'come', 'show-down', 'How', 'can', 'Superman', 'who', ""n't"", 'kill', 'stand', 'chance', 'entire', 'team', 'superheroes', 'who', 'do', 'was', 'breathing', 'Pros', 'Movie', 'Good', 'thought', 'provoking', 'story/premise', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Film', 'pros/cons', 'Superman', 'methods', 'justice', ""Elite's."", 'Cons', 'Movie', 'Superman', 'not', 'very', 'powerful', 'movie', 'ass', 'kicked', 'pretty', 'well', 'quite', 'bit', 'missing', 'left', 'eyelids', 'end', 'movie', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'violence', 'blood', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'things', 'cinema', 'am', 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'Superman', 'beat', 'up.Back', 'stories', 'Elite', 'are', 'not', 'delved', 'enough', 'fact', 'only', 'Manchester', 'Black', 'back', 'story', 'looked', 'briefly', 'How', 'did', 'rest', 'team', 'get', 'powers', 'Film', 'too', 'short', 'Not', 'enough', 'time', 'hash', 'things', 'out.Also', 'animation', 'was', 'bit', 'crude', 'taste', 'not', 'worthy', 'being', 'labeled', 'film', 'quality.', 'Conclusion', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'again', 'soon', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'punches', 'wonder', 'well', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'right', 'way', 'handle', 'evil.Also', 'FYI', 'bonus', 'feature', 'featurette', 'preview', 'DC', 'next', 'release', 'are', 'bringing', ""'Return"", 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Robot', 'Cop', 'voicing', 'aging', 'Batman', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'released', '2', 'parts', 'meaning', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'light', 'content', 'Fall', '2012', 'apx', 'release', 'Part', '1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'am', 'shoving', 'money', 'PC', 'disk', 'drive', 'right', 'now', 'trying', 'reserve', 'copy', 'Good', 'things', 'horizon', 'fanboys', 'Only', 'one', 'last', 'gripe', 'DC', 'Comics', 'love', ""'Batman"", ""'Superman"", 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'gal', 'come', ""'ve"", 'got', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'other', 'wells', 'tap', 'too', 'much', 'ask', ""'Deadman"", 'animated', 'movie', 'How', 'Demon', ""'Spectre"", 'Give', 'something', 'fresh', 'new', 'PLEASE', 'right', ""'m"", 'soap', 'box', 'now', 'Now', 'go', 'check', 'out', ""'Superman"", 'Vs', 'Elite']",N/A

The DCAUs 14th film Superman vs. The Elite is true to its' title. Suddenly a new group of extreme super-heros decide to crash Big Blue's party and halp him save the day. Unfortunatly the way they do things are not something that Superman thinks is ok.This film is yet another great delving into the many faces of Superman, this film captures the mockery of Superman about him being the boy scout and the super-hero that the modern day doesn't need anymore, because he doesn't finish the job. We live in a world today where people are alive that are crazy enough to push a button that can wipe out an entire people's existance. While it is never the right way to fight violence with violence, do we now live in a world where it may the right solution? Superman is really put to the test for his character and his morals and in this film we see just how far he would be willing to go before he gets pushed off the edge. The other question is, if the greatest hero of a generation did in-fact go off the edge...what happens next?Again another enjoyable film with a great story voice cast and plenty of action. The animation is something that makes you a bit uncomfortable at first, but as the film goes on it ends up being the least of the films' problems. The next film will in fact be one that will stand a true test, being taken from debatibly the greatest comic book story ever told. I have a feeling knowing how things have been up until this point in the DCAU it's all good.",4,Not the best but tons of fun.

The movie was somewhat entertaining, but I cannot recommend a repeat viewing. The message of this movie is to poise the question of why we should like superheroes like Superman and not like the titular villains who would be better described as anti-heroes. The Elite are superheroes who are not afraid to kill. The movie does a fair job at answering this question, but too often it feels like they have to preach the message instead of simply showing it. If you haven't seen it, I recommend watching it once but I doubt you'll want a repeat viewing.",3,Little too preachy,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,616,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'streaming', 'service', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'entertaining', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'message', 'movie', 'poise', 'question', 'why', 'should', 'like', 'superheroes', 'Superman', 'not', 'titular', 'villains', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'described', 'anti-heroes', 'Elite', 'are', 'superheroes', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'kill', 'movie', 'fair', 'job', 'answering', 'question', 'too', 'often', 'have', 'preach', 'message', 'instead', 'simply', 'showing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'recommend', 'watching', 'once', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'want', 'repeat', 'viewing']",N/A
