1474530,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIHW2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I kind of hated the second `Madagascar' film despite rather loving the first, so when this third entry was released last year I had no desire and saw no need in seeing it, other than the fact that my kids kept repeating that ""Circus, Afro, Polka-dot"" scene from the trailer and they begged and begged to see it.  I avoided it in the theaters, since there were other more important animated films to see, but I knew I'd eventually see this.  I must say, I'm not at all upset that I did.  One has to embrace the fact that `Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' is going all out here in the `ridiculous' side of things.  By the time Captain Chantel DuBois was crashing through brick walls in her attempt to behead Alex the lion I was pretty much in the zone with where this movie was going, and I was enjoying every minute of it.  As with the last two films, the supporting cast really makes this an enjoyable romp.  Alex and Marty, while the stars, are forgettable at best.  Melman and Gloria have had their run and are not as enjoyable as they were at first (Melman practically owned the first film), but Julian and his crew are back and a new crop of supporting players are here, most notably Stefano the slightly deranged circus seal.  The subplot revolving around King Julian's love affair with a bear is hilarious and the single best aspect of the film, and while the finale is a bloated mess (that whole circus scene is just lazy) you can't help but feel it in your heart as Katy Perry's massively popular `Firework' blares over the sound system and Alex finds true love.",4,Family fun that makes good after a disappointing sequel...,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,1573,"['kind', 'hated', 'second', 'Madagascar', 'film', 'rather', 'loving', 'first', 'so', 'when', 'third', 'entry', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'desire', 'saw', 'need', 'seeing', 'other', 'fact', 'kids', 'kept', 'repeating', 'Circus', 'Afro', 'Polka-dot', 'scene', 'trailer', 'begged', 'begged', 'see', 'avoided', 'theaters', 'were', 'other', 'more', 'important', 'animated', 'films', 'see', 'knew', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'see', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'upset', 'did', 'One', 'embrace', 'fact', '3', 'Europe', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'going', 'here', 'ridiculous', 'side', 'things', 'time', 'Captain', 'Chantel', 'DuBois', 'was', 'crashing', 'brick', 'walls', 'attempt', 'behead', 'Alex', 'lion', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'zone', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'enjoying', 'minute', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'Alex', 'Marty', 'stars', 'are', 'forgettable', 'best', 'Melman', 'Gloria', 'have', 'had', 'run', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'first', 'Melman', 'practically', 'owned', 'first', 'film', 'Julian', 'crew', 'are', 'back', 'new', 'crop', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'here', 'most', 'notably', 'Stefano', 'slightly', 'deranged', 'circus', 'seal', 'subplot', 'revolving', 'King', 'Julian', 'love', 'affair', 'bear', 'hilarious', 'single', 'best', 'aspect', 'film', 'finale', 'bloated', 'mess', 'whole', 'circus', 'scene', 'just', 'lazy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'heart', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'massively', 'popular', 'Firework', 'blares', 'sound', 'system', 'Alex', 'true', 'love']",Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted

The result is an (almost) perfect balance of slapstick, verbal humor, and parodies that will entertain both children (who will laugh at the slapstick antics of the circus) and adults (who will catch some of the verbal humor).Madagascar 3 is a hilarious, somewhat brilliant, frenetic family-film that both adults and kids will like!",4,"Dazzlingly Colorful, and Entertaining!",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1119,"['Madagascar', '3', 'best', 'Madagascar', 'franchise.It', 'combines', 'STELLAR', 'voice', 'work', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Tom', 'McGrath', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'Jessica', 'Chastain', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'dazzling', 'visuals', 'non-stop', 'action', 'color', 'color', 'more', 'color', 'wit', 'humor', 'even', 'heart', 'rare', 'Madagascar', 'film', '.Madagascar', '3', 'also', 'Skipper', 'Penguins', 'King', 'Julien', 'full', 'Somewhere', 'Madagascar', '1', '2', 'directors', 'realized', 'nobody', '_really_', 'cared', 'Marty', 'Alex', 'Melman', 'Gloria', 'What', 'sold', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'Penguins', 'Lemurs', 'Monkeys', 'Thankfully', 'humor', 'Madagascar', '3', 'less', 'crude', 'more', 'witty', 'first', '2', 'films', 'result', 'almost', 'perfect', 'balance', 'slapstick', 'verbal', 'humor', 'parodies', 'will', 'entertain', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'laugh', 'slapstick', 'antics', 'circus', 'adults', 'who', 'will', 'catch', 'verbal', 'humor', '.Madagascar', '3', 'hilarious', 'somewhat', 'brilliant', 'frenetic', 'family-film', 'adults', 'kids', 'will', 'like']",Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted

1474692,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B005LAIHW2,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 1]","***This review may contain spoilers.***The first two ""Madagascar"" films are not bad films.  They introduced us to an off-beat but likable quartet of zoo escapees who negotiate a crazy, unfamiliar outside world in a madcap attempt to get home.  They also introduced us to another quartet - devious but hilarious covert operation penguins sometimes offering ""help"" to the other quartet but more often engineering get-rich-quick scams.  Finally, we have the boisterous lemur trio led by an egocentric lemur ""king"".  They ensured that the first two ""Madagascar"" films were at least fun, lively, colorful, and even quick-witted from time to time.  But in my humble opinion, the two films lacked a certain something that kept them from being truly memorable.I think that ""something"" missing was control.  What I mean by that is that Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) didn't seem to have control of their destinies.  They passively let fate (and the penguins, and even a little old lady in Alex's humiliating case) slap them around a little too much.  However, I think things gloriously change and improve in ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" (hereafter ""Mad 3"").  Alex and his friends not only gain more proactive control in getting home, they reveal previously hidden skills and abilities and even take on responsibility for making others' lives better.I'll try to give just a basic skeleton of ""Mad 3's"" plot (yeah, right).  The movie begins with Alex and friends still stuck on the African wildlife preserve, perhaps vainly waiting for commando-minded Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his penguin crew to fly back in the rickety aircraft from Monte Carlo after making repairs.  Tired of waiting, they, plus the wacky King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his lackeys sensible Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and the obsequious Mort (Andy Richter), snorkel all the way to Monte Carlo and find the penguins in disguise playing roulette in a casino.  Hiding in the rafters, Alex and friends plan to nab the sneaky penguins and force them to fly everyone home.Of course, things go awry and all the animals find themselves relentlessly pursued throughout the city by Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand).  A combination of Lucille Ball, Inspector Javert, a bloodhound, and the Terminator, Captain DuBois's true goal is mounting Alex's head on a wall.  Despite DuBois's non-stop efforts, all the animals find refuge on a circus train.  Learning that the train's tour itinerary includes New York, Alex figures that it can finally take him and his friends home.  Before that can happen, though, they must ingratiate themselves with the circus's skeptical members.  Gia the trapeze-artist jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and Alex's potential paramour, and Stefano, the high-strung Italian sea lion (Martin Short) and first cousin to Sid the sloth in the ""Ice Age"" movies, are relatively easily won over.  Vitaly the gruff and sullen Siberian Tiger (Bryan Cranston) is a tougher cocoanut to crack because he is suspicious of Alex and friends' circus credentials.  Also, he is a hoop-jumping star in decline because of a fiery stunt gone wrong.The rest of the circus is not in such hot shape.  It is dilapidated and playing to smaller and smaller crowds.  If Alex and company want to get home, they got to help Vitaly get his nerve back and make the circus acts really eye-poppingly spectacular again.  Meanwhile, they must also stay ahead of the seemingly unstoppable Captain DuBois, still on their trail.  Can Alex and company accomplish these three goals?  What if the circus troupe finds out the truth about their real intentions?  Will DuBois get her stuffed lion head?""Mad 3"" is, I think, the best, at least so far, of the franchise because at last Alex and company take matters into their own paws and hooves to improve not only their circumstances, but those of others.  And how!  Alex's cajoling, encouragement, and athletic skills start to inspire the troupe, especially the smitten Gia.  Gloria and the insecure Melman not only perfect a literal high-wire act, but a romantic one, too.  Irrepressible Marty helps Stefano with the cannonball act and the circus with a ""rainbow afro"".  Even selfish Julien romantically bonds with melancholy bear Sonya and adds new dimensions to her cycling act.  All this culminates in a gravity-defying, pulse-pounding circus extravaganza, like Cirque de Soleil to the nth power.So ""Mad 3"" certainly has the energy, fire, and comic zaniness of its predecessors.  But beyond that, it unexpectedly reveals lessons in friendship, self-reliance, helping others, overcoming inhibitions, self-sacrifice, and what home really means.  If you liked the first two ""Madagascar"" movies, ""Mad 3"" will really make your happiness soar.  If you weren't crazy about the first two, I suggest giving ""Mad 3"" a try.  You just might end up with an exciting, meaningful, and unforgettable experience.",5,"Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman Get Their (Circus) Act Together and Give Their Best ""Madagascar"" Performance To

The film has fun and funny beginning and a spectacular ending filled with music, daring rescues and color! The middle section dragged a bit and almost flowed a little off track - but the finale is worth waiting for.Starting in Africa, where they were left in the second feature, Alex the Lion (Voiced by Ben Stiller - Tropic Thunder, Zoolander) decides on his birthday that they all need to be home back in New York where they belong. His buddy Marty the Zebra (Voiced by Chris Rock - Death At A Funeral, Grown Ups) seems to convince everyone they need to find the Penguins that abandoned them (with their witty and sarcastic leader Skipper voiced by the film's director himself Tom McGrath) and use their now super plane to get back to New York.On their way to Monte Carlo - where the penguins rule at a Casino with the wildly crazy chimps as their buddies - Gloria the Hippo (Voiced by Jedda Pincket Smith - Collateral, The Nutty Professor) and Melman the Giraffe (Voiced by David Schwimmer - Friends, John Carter) fall deeper into their romance with each other.Enter the villain Captain Chantel Dubois, a mean and sadistic animal police catcher who prides herself by mounting her prey on her wall. Guess what species she is missing - A lion. This was incredibly voiced with such cleverness and French accented flair by the brilliant Francis McDormand (Fargo, Almost Famous). She even sings in French too! She is the reason the whole gang join the Circus - by accident.Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, The Dictator) is back as Julian as well as Andy Richter (Late Night With Conan) as Mort and even Cedric The Entertainer (Ice Age 2, Intolerable Cruelty) is back as Maurice. But with some great new and extremely funny charters created by Martin Short (Father of the Bride, How I Met Your Mother) as the incredible self-deprecating Seal Stefano and Bryan Cranston (Drive, Little Miss Sunshine) as the prickly Russian Tiger Vitaly, everyone plays their part learning what a circus team can really do and how friendships are important.Directors Eric Darnell (Antz, Madagascar 1 & 2 - who also co-wrote this one), Tom McGrath (Megamind, Madagascar 1 & 2) and  Conrad Vernon (Monsters Vs Aliens, Shrek 2) along with co-writer Noah Baumbach (Greenberg, Fantstic Mr. Fox) spent some time on relationships - a little too much in the middle - but paid it all off with a fast paced, fun and touching ending! Hans Zimmer (The Lion King) score is as always fanciful for this type of project.The climax is fun - very colorful - and this was one of the better films that used the 3-D to its fullest advantage. Heartwarming is the ending, toe-tapping is the music, neon colors for the eyes and laughter is the ending.

The movie was light and funny and quite silly and ridiculous at times, but it had some touching moments that really do have quite a bit of emotional depth behind them that should appeal to older audiences. This is something I like about Dreamworks, in comparison to a company like Pixar (although, I think Pixar is also an awesome company). Dreamworks tends to a little more hit and miss with their movies, but Dreamworks seems to take more chances, and as a result, they often come up with movies that are different and can be very deep and touching at times. Just a warning, I'm 23 years old, and I like many animated films, especially ones with animals so I'm probably a little biased. I was watching this movie with my 20 year old brother in the room, and he definitely thought it was funny, so perhaps that adds a little more credibility. This is the kind of movie that the entire family should be able to enjoy even if there are no kids around, but if there are kids around, I'm sure they'll love it.With regard to the movie package itself. There is not much to say on that. It is pretty much what you would expect. It seems good. The discs are stored well in the case. There is no idiotic stacking of discs or any nonsense like that.

1474786,AHF97M45JFCB,B005LAIHW2,ONENEO,"[1, 2]","I don't know why, but I've always felt that 2005's Madagascar really didn't need sequels.  This isn't to say that the characters and settings weren't conducive to an ongoing plot of course, so much as the cleverness of New York zoo animals suddenly trying to make it in the wild really only works once.  After that, it becomes a lot more about the characters and their trials and tribulations and in the case of Madagascar, a lot of that involves slapstick and visual gags over rich story telling.However- my misgivings notwithstanding, the Madagascar series has gone on to encompass a trilogy of films, a variety of holiday themed specials, 61-episodes of the Nickelodeon spin-off Penguins of Madagascar and somehow I doubt DreamWorks is done exploiting this one.The third film, subtitled Europe's Most Wanted, set DreamWorks back an estimated $145-mil and comes in at a runtime of 93-minutes.  It wears an appropriate PG rating and retains a majority of the established vocal cast of the past entries.The story, or what passes for one anyway, finds the unlikely group of animal escapees longing to return to their zoo where all their needs were met and in some cases (like Melman's daily pharmaceutical overload) things they didn't even really need were being met!  Of course putting one's faith in the group of militant penguins (who have developed a fondness for gambling in this one) as your means of transportation is sure to come with risks such as having a plane crash on route to NY from Africa directly over Europe just as a random example.What results is our escapees instantly becoming fugitives in the process as well as the targets of animal control officer Captain Chantel DuBois: equal parts French femme fatale and bloodhound.  Seeking refuge in a circus, the NY zoo crew meets up with a host of circus animals (including a knife throwing Russian tiger, Roman sea lion, a silent bear and an Italian Jaguar).  The circus, it turns out, is in a pretty sad state of affairs and could use the showmanship of some of New York's finest to get their act together.  All the while the main characters are trying to plot a way back to the US while Captian DuBois manages to stay one step behind.So does any of this tell you if this film is worth a purchase or rental?  Probably not, so let's take a look at some of the technical elements.  The colors, complicated sets, and animatics are all top notch; so much so in fact that the (character models in particular) look surprisingly simplistic from 2005's original Madagascar.  The pacing is a bit odd, with massive action-laced chase sequences that hold the viewer's attention by themselves but the overall plot rather crawls along with no unexpected twists or turns.Whether or not the comedy will work for you depends heavily upon your sense of humor.  There isn't a whole lot here for the adults.. A few puns here and there, King Julien's obnoxiousness, and a bit of pop culture reference (you have to look close though to pick up on the references to The Matrix, Inception, X-Men Last Stand and so on).  If you're big on slapstick, however, you are in for quite a treat!  Falls, smacks, tumbles, collisions and tranquilizer darts are aplenty!  Kids will likely enjoy the sheer over-the-top nature of the cartoony visuals more than adults will enjoy locating a segment of truly clever or thought provoking dialog.In all DreamWorks has sort of fallen into the pattern of pumping out huge budgeted, visually intensive CG feature films that don't commit any major crimes so much as they simply lack for substance.  This seems especially true for all of the many sequels they pump out (the Shreks, Kung-Fu Panda, Madagascars and so on).Worth a rental for sure so long as you go in expecting a lighthearted, cartoony violent, hour & a half romp that promises to get the little ones snickering.

The plot careens along at comedically break-neck speed, jokes of all kinds flying off the screen as fast as one can absorb them in some scenes, all while being a visual delight.  There's an element that'll probably tickle everyone's funny bone here.  Visual slapstick comedy, movie reference jokes (for the parents), puns, funny in-character interactions, King Julian falls head-over-heels in love, and of course, those ingenious penguins.The story begins right where ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen Edition)"" left off, with King Julian and The Penguins flying off to Monte Carlo.  The Bronx Zoo crew hatches a plan to finally get home by getting their hands on The Penguins.  Much like the movie-logic displayed whenThe Muppets (2011)traveled ""by map"", Alex the lion and his compadres snorkel from East Africa to the coast of Monte Carlo.  (Who says it has to make sense?  These are talking animals!)  From there, hijinks ensue.They're being chased by the most resourceful animal control expert, Dubois (voiced with delicious snarly-ness by Frances McDormand), who has an uncanny nose for tracking animals and determination on par with The Terminator.  The fugitives take refuge in a rag-tag circus train and form a tenuous alliance with the circus animals.  More hijinks ensue as together they collaborate and create a new kind of circus.There is A LOT to like here.  Sharp scripting with a wide variety of quick-hitting humor (some intelligent, some not-so-much but still laugh-out-loud funny) make for an enjoyable experience.  Visually, there are some flat-out dazzling, try-not-to-blink scenes.  When the film climaxes at the circus production, the audience is treated to a euphoric fantasy of sight and sound with Katy Perry's ""Firework"" inspirationally integrated.  It's like Cirque du Soleil meets Disney's Fantasia, and it's stunning.  The quality of the voice acting here is top-notch, with all the original main players returning from the first two films, plus the edition of the ever-surprising Bryan Cranston as the supernaturally gifted circus tiger, Vitaly.As with all DreamWorks animated features, there are a few off-color references that will probably fly over the kids' heads (for example: a policeman chastises a peer with a glove slap, presumably for eyeballing Dubois' rather ample derriere), but there was one EXTREMELY close call brush with profanity that drew gasps from more than a few parents in the audience.  (With just a little imagination, you can imagine what ""That's BOLSHEVIK!"" might sound like.)  Still, there are more redeeming qualities in the script that negative ones.  Themes of loyalty, friendship, and honesty are front and center.All in all, ""Madagascar 3"" is 85 minutes of fast-paced fun that on pure entertainment value outpaces most animated features.

The only thing I have positive to say about this movie is that the polka-dot song is/was catchy and fun and my kids cant stop singing it and once it starts it never ends...So I guess that's my two cents, but it looks like I'm in the minority of those not liking this movie...

Much hilarity ensues, with all kinds of tricks.As with the other Madagascar films, the voice talent is top notch, including Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, and featuring Chris Rock.

1474864,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAIHW2,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[1, 2]","I laughed, a lot, watching ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" (not the catchiest of titles but it'll do).  While it got off to a slow start the flick picked up once they got out of Africa and into hijinks in Monte Carlo, catching up with the Skipper and the rest of the penguin bunch, in order to get back to New York (home, sweet home).  With the introduction of this episodes nemesis, Captain Chantel DuBois, a French animal control officer who is completely bonkers and more than a bit of bloodhound, the movie chases our gang of misfits (Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and his gal pal Gloria the hippo) across a mostly non-descript Europe as they try to find their way back to the zoo.  Along the way they get involved with a traveling circus and help to transform the pathetic three-ring into a splashy, boffo big-top.  Of course, finding their way home means that they find that ""you can't go back"" and ""home is where the heart is.""  None of this gets too serious or heavy-handed.  Quite a bit of it is utter nonsense (I mean of the Looney Tunes variety, such as when our four intrepid leads are trying to figure out who will go down which oddly shaped ventilation duct) and there are the requisite pop culture references (Chris Rock's zebra painting himself white with polka dots and wearing a rainbow afro, as seen in the trailer), movie references (the jailbreak sequence involving Captain DuBois and the guards as the guards go around and talk about how she could get out in various ways such as through the hole in the wall behind a picture, a la ""Shawshank Redemption""), and a few political and social jabs (surprisingly at Canadian brethren and the French).  All of this mostly plays to the adults in the audience while the kids will love the crazy escapades and slapstick of the animals.Speaking of the animals, as King Julian and the Penguins overshadowed the main cast in the first ""Madagascar"" and the Penguins killed in ""Madagascar 2"", Alex the lion remained the focal point of this iteration with a nice balance being given to KJ and the penguins and some very likable new animals being introduced by way of the traveling circus.  I especially liked the sympathetic seal Stefano (voiced by Martin Short doing a great impersonation of Roberto Benigni, and those teeth!), and the Russian tiger and the Cheetah were both made to orbit Alex the lion in a yin-yang way (the tiger was the doubter, the aggressor and the cheetah was the believer, the lover).The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way and that I think was in poor taste, clever as it may have been, was Alex the lion remarking that his relatives used to headline the Roman coliseum circus events back in the day (our travelers were performing their first show in Rome, in the coliseum).  I'm sure this went over all of the children's heads and most of the adult's but the reference to dissidents and Christians being ""fed to the lions"" (while maybe in character for Alex the lion to say) isn't something to laugh at, especially not in a kid's movie.  But other than this and one instance where you thought a character was going to yell ""that's bulls***"" (the Russian tiger Nataly yells, ""That's Bolshevik!"" instead) the movie kept it's kid-friendly tone with its thoughtful and easily digestible messages.Lastly, I saw this in 2D and thought that it looked fine.  I'm sure that the colors popped in 3D but I wouldn't think that this is a ""must see in 3D"" movie.  Some retailers are selling copies of the first two movies with money off your theater ticket as part of the bonus.  That's a good way to go.  Get through the first fifteen minutes of this film and you've got yourself a winner.As good as ""Madagascar 2"", if not better.",5,Talking animals tickling our funny bones.,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3732,"['laughed', 'lot', 'watching', 'Madagascar', '3', 'Europe', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'not', 'catchiest', 'titles', ""'ll"", 'do', 'got', 'off', 'slow', 'start', 'flick', 'picked', 'up', 'once', 'got', 'Africa', 'hijinks', 'Monte', 'Carlo', 'catching', 'up', 'Skipper', 'rest', 'penguin', 'bunch', 'order', 'get', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'sweet', 'home', 'introduction', 'episodes', 'nemesis', 'Captain', 'Chantel', 'DuBois', 'French', 'animal', 'control', 'officer', 'who', 'completely', 'bonkers', 'more', 'bit', 'bloodhound', 'movie', 'gang', 'misfits', 'Alex', 'lion', 'Marty', 'zebra', 'Melman', 'giraffe', 'gal', 'pal', 'Gloria', 'hippo', 'mostly', 'non-descript', 'Europe', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'zoo', 'way', 'get', 'involved', 'traveling', 'circus', 'help', 'transform', 'pathetic', 'three-ring', 'splashy', 'boffo', 'big-top', 'course', 'finding', 'way', 'home', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'heart', 'None', 'too', 'serious', 'heavy-handed', 'bit', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'mean', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'variety', 'such', 'when', 'four', 'intrepid', 'leads', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'oddly', 'shaped', 'ventilation', 'duct', 'are', 'requisite', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'zebra', 'painting', 'white', 'polka', 'dots', 'wearing', 'rainbow', 'afro', 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'references', 'jailbreak', 'sequence', 'involving', 'Captain', 'DuBois', 'guards', 'guards', 'go', 'around', 'talk', 'how', 'could', 'get', 'out', 'various', 'ways', 'such', 'hole', 'wall', 'picture', 'la', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'few', 'political', 'social', 'jabs', 'surprisingly', 'Canadian', 'brethren', 'French', 'mostly', 'adults', 'audience', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'crazy', 'escapades', 'slapstick', 'animals.Speaking', 'animals', 'King', 'Julian', 'Penguins', 'overshadowed', 'main', 'cast', 'first', 'Madagascar', 'Penguins', 'killed', 'Madagascar', '2', 'Alex', 'lion', 'remained', 'focal', 'point', 'iteration', 'nice', 'balance', 'being', 'given', 'KJ', 'penguins', 'very', 'likable', 'new', 'animals', 'being', 'introduced', 'way', 'traveling', 'circus', 'especially', 'liked', 'sympathetic', 'seal', 'Stefano', 'voiced', 'Martin', 'Short', 'doing', 'great', 'impersonation', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'teeth', 'Russian', 'tiger', 'Cheetah', 'were', 'made', 'orbit', 'Alex', 'lion', 'yin-yang', 'way', 'tiger', 'was', 'doubter', 'aggressor', 'cheetah', 'was', 'believer', 'lover', 'only', 'thing', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'taste', 'clever', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'Alex', 'lion', 'remarking', 'relatives', 'used', 'headline', 'Roman', 'coliseum', 'circus', 'events', 'back', 'day', 'travelers', 'were', 'performing', 'first', 'show', 'Rome', 'coliseum', ""'m"", 'sure', 'went', 'children', 'heads', 'most', 'adult', 'reference', 'dissidents', 'Christians', 'being', 'fed', 'lions', 'maybe', 'character', 'Alex', 'lion', 'say', ""n't"", 'something', 'laugh', 'especially', 'not', 'kid', 'movie', 'other', 'one', 'instance', 'where', 'thought', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'yell', 'bulls***', 'Russian', 'tiger', 'Nataly', 'yells', 'Bolshevik', 'instead', 'movie', 'kept', 'kid-friendly', 'tone', 'thoughtful', 'easily', 'digestible', 'messages.Lastly', 'saw', '2D', 'thought', 'looked', 'fine', ""'m"", 'sure', 'colors', 'popped', '3D', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'must', 'see', '3D', 'movie', 'retailers', 'are', 'selling', 'copies', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'money', 'theater', 'ticket', 'part', 'bonus', 'good', 'way', 'go', 'Get', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'film', ""'ve"", 'got', 'winner.As', 'good', 'Madagascar', '2', 'not', 'better']",Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted

1474871,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIHW2,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Admittedly the opening of ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"" is not great, but be patient. The second sequel is better than the first one and possibly the original. It takes a while for ""Madagascar 3"" to get really interesting.The four animals from New York City's Central Park Zoo, Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria, decide to leave Africa, following the penguins now staying at a Monte Carlo hotel. Alex and the gang want the ever-resourceful penguins to fly them back to New York. But please don't ask me how the four big animals - a lion, a zebra, a giraffe and a hippopotamus - managed to travel from Africa to Europe.The film kicks into gear when the film's ""villainess"" appears. She is Captain Chantel DuBois, Monaco's (or the world's) most efficient animal control officer ""collecting"" animals (their heads, in fact). With her incredible tracking skills and Jackie Chan-like physical prowess, she attempts to capture Alex the lion and the other animals in a hilarious chase sequence.Most of the other new characters introduced are animals of a traveling circus troupe, including Gia the jaguar, Alex's love interest, and Vitaly the tiger, star of the circus. King Julien XIII also joins the tour and falls in love with Sonya the bear. These new characters and their subplots, though not particularly bad in themselves, are pretty weak when compared to scene-stealing Captain DuBois, who, like the penguins in the previous ""Madagascar"" films, deserves her own movie.But the strength of DreamWorks' new animation lies in its colorful visuals (in part inspired by Cirque du Soleil) and thrilling action full of imagination that makes up for the lack of credible storyline.
