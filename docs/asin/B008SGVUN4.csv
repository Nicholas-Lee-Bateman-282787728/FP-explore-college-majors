1575644,AT57B36BHDQ00,B008SGVUN4,Big Mike,"[1, 1]","I am torn between not liking this film and liking the cast. It was perhaps never intended to be a true remake of the James Whale 1932 classic, but instead just very loosely based on both it and the original source material, J.B. Priestley's book Benighted. It had everything going for it to make it at least entertaining. First of all, it was directed by the great schlockmeister William Castle, although there are no gimmicks to speak of. It has a fine, mostly British cast, with the exception of Tom Poston. The script seems to be the main thing wrong with the film. It never seems to want to cross over into delivering some genuine chills, thrills or scares and instead opts out for comedy. This is especially odd for a William Castle film. It is a rarely seen and obscure film but it was a bit of a letdown and a disappointment after finally getting the chance to see it.",3,A fine cast but a disappointing remake of a classic,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,875,"['am', 'torn', 'not', 'liking', 'film', 'liking', 'cast', 'was', 'perhaps', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'true', 'remake', 'James', 'Whale', '1932', 'classic', 'instead', 'just', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'J.B.', 'Priestley', 'book', 'Benighted', 'had', 'everything', 'going', 'make', 'least', 'entertaining', 'First', 'all', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'schlockmeister', 'William', 'Castle', 'are', 'gimmicks', 'speak', 'fine', 'mostly', 'British', 'cast', 'exception', 'Tom', 'Poston', 'script', 'be', 'main', 'thing', 'wrong', 'film', 'never', 'want', 'cross', 'over', 'delivering', 'genuine', 'chills', 'thrills', 'scares', 'instead', 'opts', 'out', 'comedy', 'especially', 'odd', 'William', 'Castle', 'film', 'rarely', 'seen', 'obscure', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'letdown', 'disappointment', 'finally', 'getting', 'chance', 'see']",N/A

My sister and I had seen it long, long ago and remembered the spooky old house with people being killed off one by one.  And mostly we remembered the woman who is constantly knitting and is found with her knitting needles sticking out of her neck and a seriously goofy look on her face.  This is a funny, funny movie.  After receiving it from Amazon I had my sister over for dinner and afterwards we watched the movie and were laughing so hard we had to back it up sometimes to catch what we had missed.

Eads ""Lizel""","[0, 0]","This chilling comedy chronicles the spooky exploits of a Yankee car salesman working in London who sets out to deliver a car to a remote and very creepy Welsh estate. Unfortunately he discovers the owner dead. While attempting to leave a fierce storm erupts and he has a wreck. He returns to the mansion to seek shelter from the disparate sisters therein. Once warm and dry, he meets the rest of their strange family, including twins, a looney who is building an ark, and the matriarch of the household. The storm rages on and as the grim night slowly passes, family members are bumped off at appallingly regular intervals leaving the American to solve the crimes.",4,Murder!  More Murders!
