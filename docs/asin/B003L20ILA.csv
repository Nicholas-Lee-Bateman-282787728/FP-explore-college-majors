1349596,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003L20ILA,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","My wife and I watched this beautiful film the other day, and I rushed out and bought a copy I was so moved by it.  The whole tone and construction of the film and the emotional relevance that it stirs in the heart is just remarkably moving and memorable.  I'm saddened that this movie didn't do as well as initially predicted during last years Awards season, although Duvall did squeeze out a much deserved SAG nomination.The film is a black comedy of sorts, although I certainly consider it more of a dramatic film than anything else.  It revolves around a crotchety old hermit named Felix who is shaken when a friend passes away.  This causes Felix to consider his `time' and he chooses to throw a funeral party, inviting everyone who knows him to attend.  There are only two hitches; Felix isn't very well liked and he wants to attend the party himself.  He asks a funeral director aching for a dead body to bury to help him with the party, and so begins this strange yet endearing slice of `folklore'.At the heart of `Get Low' is a devastating secret that plagues Felix and has pushed him to the brink of solitude; a secret that has haunted him for the bulk of his life.  He is misjudged and misrepresented because people are afraid of what they don't understand, but Felix is determined to set things straight by divulging his secret for all to hear.But as with most things, it's easier said than done.The performances here are beautifully delivered, especially from Robert Duvall.  He underscores every ounce of Felix's personality, delivering one of his finest performances in years; possibly since 97's `The Apostle'.  It is a vastly different performance (this being far subtler in tone) but they are equally powerful.The film boils down to a devastating climax as the big reveal makes its appearance, and I must admit that my cheeks were stained with tears as Duvall marvelously makes that `speech' so real and honest; keeping within the constraints of his `character' and making it feel exactly as it was supposed to feel.  What happens next is even more haunting as `Get Low' gives us a snippet of what is so wrong with the world today (just watch the reaction to the news and the way the townsfolk `carry on' despite the apparent heartbreak).`Get Low' is a film that is so much more than I could have hoped for.  It is beautifully restrained and effortlessly memorable; this is a film that I will regard highly for some time, I just know it.",5,"Just get it, NOW...",1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,2454,"['wife', 'watched', 'beautiful', 'film', 'other', 'day', 'rushed', 'out', 'bought', 'copy', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'whole', 'tone', 'construction', 'film', 'emotional', 'relevance', 'heart', 'just', 'remarkably', 'moving', 'memorable', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'as', 'well', 'initially', 'predicted', 'last', 'years', 'Awards', 'season', 'Duvall', 'did', 'squeeze', 'out', 'much', 'deserved', 'SAG', 'nomination.The', 'film', 'black', 'comedy', 'sorts', 'certainly', 'consider', 'more', 'dramatic', 'film', 'anything', 'else', 'crotchety', 'old', 'hermit', 'named', 'Felix', 'who', 'shaken', 'when', 'friend', 'away', 'Felix', 'consider', 'time', 'throw', 'funeral', 'party', 'inviting', 'everyone', 'who', 'attend', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'hitches', 'Felix', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'liked', 'attend', 'party', 'funeral', 'director', 'aching', 'dead', 'body', 'bury', 'help', 'party', 'so', 'strange', 'yet', 'endearing', 'slice', ""folklore'.At"", 'heart', 'Get', 'Low', 'devastating', 'secret', 'Felix', 'pushed', 'brink', 'solitude', 'secret', 'haunted', 'bulk', 'life', 'misjudged', 'misrepresented', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Felix', 'determined', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'divulging', 'secret', 'hear.But', 'most', 'things', 'easier', 'said', 'done.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'beautifully', 'delivered', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'ounce', 'Felix', 'personality', 'delivering', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'years', 'possibly', '97', 'Apostle', 'vastly', 'different', 'performance', 'being', 'far', 'subtler', 'tone', 'are', 'equally', 'powerful.The', 'film', 'boils', 'down', 'devastating', 'climax', 'big', 'reveal', 'appearance', 'must', 'admit', 'cheeks', 'were', 'stained', 'tears', 'Duvall', 'marvelously', 'speech', 'so', 'real', 'honest', 'keeping', 'constraints', 'character', 'making', 'feel', 'exactly', 'was', 'supposed', 'feel', 'What', 'next', 'even', 'more', 'haunting', 'Get', 'Low', 'snippet', 'what', 'so', 'wrong', 'world', 'today', 'just', 'watch', 'reaction', 'news', 'way', 'townsfolk', 'carry', 'apparent', 'heartbreak', 'Get', 'Low', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'beautifully', 'restrained', 'effortlessly', 'memorable', 'film', 'will', 'regard', 'highly', 'time', 'just', 'know']",Get Low

1349600,A30TQET02FLSUX,B003L20ILA,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 3]","FILM RATING:  3.5 starsGet Low (2009) is a showcase for Robert Duvall's tremendous acting chops. Do I really need to give you another reason to watch it? If so, then the same can be said for his co-stars Bill Murray, Sissy Spacek, and Lucas Black. This movie is all about giving these fine actors the opportunity to truly shine with juicy dialogue, rich visuals, and even a sense of humor thrown in. The story starts better than it finishes, but the journey is well worth a viewing.Robert Duvall plays Felix Bush, an old guy filled with bitter regret whose been living alone as a hermit out in the woods for decades all by himself. He's sensing that his death is near and he wants to have a funeral party, before he dies ironically, that he can attend himself so that he can reveal a secret he's been hiding since he was young. He wants everyone that's ever heard of him to attend the party. So he hires a funeral director, played by Bill Murray, to organize the event and make it all happen. It's better to leave the rest of the story for the film, because as usual, I think you're better off knowing less vs. more going into this film.I was pleasantly surprised by the originality and high production quality of Get Low. It's not a movie I'll ever forget. It definitely stands apart from the crowd as a bit of an odd duckling, but in a good way! In a lesser year for films, it might have garnered more critical and awards attention, but getting its major theatrical release in 2010 gave it too much competition I think. 2010 was a pretty amazing year for film. But on blu-ray, Get Low finds a good home. And hopefully an appreciative audience. I can't say enough about the cinematography on this film by David Boyd. Get Low looks incredible! The deep, dark, inky blacks and rich, warm, contrasty colors make the film pop on your home theater screen. I definitely suggest you see this on blu-ray if you can. I doubt DVD would do it justice.Production Designer Geoffrey Kirkland seems to have a knack for finding and creating locations and sets that are rich and realistic, and filled with time and story appropriate detail. Kirkland did a fantastic job as production designer on Mississippi Burning (1988) and Children of Men (2006). And he's done the same here. He just knows how to bring a small, rural southern town to life! The sound design, sound editing, and music on Get Low are well done and lend life to the story, as usual. Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score fits the story with a nice combination of seriousness and witty charm. It's got an ironic tone at times.Get Low is director Aaron Schneider's debut feature film. And as a director (and film editor), I think he has a bright future ahead of him based on his results here. Schneider's unique vision and look for the film, along with perfect casting, created a movie that breaks out of the typical mainstream Hollywood movie mold, giving the older characters the center of attention. It's nice to see a director as the editor as well. It seems to me that more and more young directors are learning how to edit in their early work, and its nice to see mainstream movies where the director is giving the freedom to be the editor as well. It's not for every director, but it worked for Schneider here.The dialogue and writing are excellent from screenwriters Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell. But the story by Provenzano and Scott Seeke could have used a little more polish in my opinion. I think the first two acts of the film are well thought out, but the final act does feel a bit empty to me. While I like the courageous exploration of the themes of revenge, lust, forgiveness, and death that are looked at in Get Low, I also feel like the set-up and expectations by the time we get to ""the big story"" are so big that the payoff just isn't there. I wanted to feel a stronger and deeper emotional connection to Felix (Robert Duvall's character), but I didn't. But overall, Get Low deserves to be seen and probably seen again on my part down the road. I still think about it on occasion since I first saw it weeks ago. And most importantly, the questions and themes that Get Low explores are always in my mind, simmering and waiting to come to the forefront where they can be explored another time while watching another movie.",4,A Showcase for Robert Duvall & Bill Murray,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",2011,4289,"['FILM', 'RATING', '3.5', 'starsGet', 'Low', '2009', 'showcase', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'tremendous', 'acting', 'chops', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'give', 'reason', 'watch', 'so', 'then', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'co-stars', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'movie', 'giving', 'fine', 'actors', 'opportunity', 'truly', 'shine', 'juicy', 'dialogue', 'rich', 'visuals', 'even', 'sense', 'humor', 'thrown', 'story', 'better', 'journey', 'well', 'viewing.Robert', 'Duvall', 'plays', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'old', 'guy', 'filled', 'bitter', 'regret', 'been', 'living', 'alone', 'hermit', 'woods', 'decades', 'sensing', 'death', 'near', 'have', 'funeral', 'party', 'ironically', 'can', 'attend', 'so', 'can', 'reveal', 'secret', 'been', 'hiding', 'was', 'young', 'everyone', 'ever', 'heard', 'attend', 'party', 'funeral', 'director', 'played', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'organize', 'event', 'make', 'happen', 'better', 'leave', 'rest', 'story', 'film', 'usual', 'think', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'knowing', 'less', 'more', 'going', 'film.I', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'originality', 'high', 'production', 'quality', 'Get', 'Low', 'not', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'forget', 'definitely', 'apart', 'crowd', 'bit', 'odd', 'duckling', 'good', 'way', 'lesser', 'year', 'films', 'might', 'have', 'garnered', 'more', 'critical', 'awards', 'attention', 'getting', 'major', 'theatrical', 'release', '2010', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'competition', 'think', '2010', 'was', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'year', 'film', 'blu-ray', 'Get', 'Low', 'good', 'home', 'hopefully', 'appreciative', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'cinematography', 'film', 'David', 'Boyd', 'Get', 'Low', 'incredible', 'deep', 'dark', 'inky', 'blacks', 'rich', 'warm', 'contrasty', 'colors', 'make', 'film', 'pop', 'home', 'theater', 'screen', 'definitely', 'suggest', 'see', 'blu-ray', 'can', 'doubt', 'DVD', 'would', 'do', 'justice.Production', 'Designer', 'Geoffrey', 'Kirkland', 'have', 'knack', 'finding', 'creating', 'locations', 'sets', 'are', 'rich', 'realistic', 'filled', 'time', 'story', 'appropriate', 'detail', 'Kirkland', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'production', 'designer', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', '1988', 'Children', 'Men', '2006', 'done', 'same', 'here', 'just', 'how', 'bring', 'small', 'rural', 'southern', 'town', 'life', 'sound', 'design', 'sound', 'editing', 'music', 'Get', 'Low', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'lend', 'life', 'story', 'usual', 'Jan', 'A.P', 'Kaczmarek', 'score', 'story', 'nice', 'combination', 'seriousness', 'witty', 'charm', 'got', 'ironic', 'tone', 'times.Get', 'Low', 'director', 'Aaron', 'Schneider', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'director', 'film', 'editor', 'think', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead', 'based', 'results', 'here', 'Schneider', 'unique', 'vision', 'look', 'film', 'perfect', 'casting', 'created', 'movie', 'typical', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'mold', 'giving', 'older', 'characters', 'center', 'attention', 'nice', 'see', 'director', 'editor', 'well', 'more', 'more', 'young', 'directors', 'are', 'learning', 'how', 'edit', 'early', 'work', 'nice', 'see', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'where', 'director', 'giving', 'freedom', 'be', 'editor', 'well', 'not', 'director', 'worked', 'Schneider', 'here.The', 'dialogue', 'writing', 'are', 'excellent', 'screenwriters', 'Chris', 'Provenzano', 'C.', 'Gaby', 'Mitchell', 'story', 'Provenzano', 'Scott', 'Seeke', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'polish', 'opinion', 'think', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'film', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'final', 'act', 'feel', 'bit', 'empty', 'like', 'courageous', 'exploration', 'themes', 'revenge', 'lust', 'forgiveness', 'death', 'are', 'looked', 'Get', 'Low', 'also', 'feel', 'set-up', 'expectations', 'time', 'get', 'big', 'story', 'are', 'so', 'big', 'payoff', 'just', ""n't"", 'there', 'wanted', 'feel', 'stronger', 'deeper', 'emotional', 'connection', 'Felix', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'overall', 'Get', 'Low', 'be', 'seen', 'probably', 'seen', 'again', 'part', 'road', 'still', 'think', 'occasion', 'first', 'saw', 'weeks', 'ago', 'most', 'importantly', 'questions', 'themes', 'Get', 'Low', 'explores', 'are', 'always', 'mind', 'simmering', 'waiting', 'come', 'forefront', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'explored', 'time', 'watching', 'movie']",Get Low

But a film like this one makes me wonder how many are going to replace the likes of Robert Duvall and Bill Murray. It is very hard for me to think of anyone quite in their league when showcased in a movie like this.  Duvall has been enchanting us in films since playing Boo Radley in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (another magnificent Southern character). Bill Murray alternates between making us laugh out loud to being astonishingly good in more serious roles, like this one. Both have entertained us for decades wonderfully and this film is no exception.Duvall plays a hermit in the South back around the 1930s.  Murray is an undertaker who is short on business and needs a body.  When Murray learns that Duvall wants to arrange and conduct his funeral now, while still alive, he drives out to Duvall's cabin to seal the deal. Duvall wants a party as part of his funeral plan and the people who come to it have to tell all the stories they've heard of him going back decades.  Most of them are fearful of him. Duvall is torn about whether to reveal why he has been a hermit for the past forty years.Enough said.

Robert Duvall does give one of the great performances of all time. Though there's a rocky start to the character of old man Felix Bush (due to the script more than Duvall), soon into the film Duvall is stunningly convincing as this grizzled -- and deeply tormented -- recluse.But to an extent that masterly performance by Duvall is cancelled out by Bill Murray, who's just a walking anachronism here. To help explain why he's an outsider in this Appalachian town, the script has Murray's character come from the big city of Chicago to start up a funeral business. Nonetheless, though his alienness to the setting is geographically explained, he still seems like the personality we know from so many films of the last ten years cast back in time.

1349609,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B003L20ILA,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[8, 9]","Robert Duvall is one of the best American actors of the past half century.  Witness his roles in To Kill a Mockingbird, The Godfather I and II, The Great Santini, Apocalypse Now, Open Range, and a full TV resume including Lonesome Dove.  In Get Low, he gives a measured, understated performance as a mysterious, old hermit who makes an unusual, life changing decision.  This independent film is deceptively simple and honest.  Yet it is done extremely well and leaves a deep feeling about life's regrets.After the brief image of a house burning down, we flash forward to a rural setting in the 1930's to see an old home inhabited by a reclusive, elderly man, Felix Bush (Duvall), whose disheveled appearance and reputation are the stuff of rumor and legend.  Are the stories about him true?  Is he a killer?  Haunted by visions of a woman, he decides to arrange his own funeral before his actual demise.  The funeral home is run by Frank Quinn (Bill Murray) and his loyal assistant, Buddy Robinson (Lucas Black).  Felix wants to invite everyone who has a story about him to tell.  He sweetens the pot by offering to raffle off his vast acreage of property.  He also runs into an old acquaintance, Mattie (Sissy Spacek), who has strong ties to him from way back.  He later pays a visit to a preacher in another town in hopes of having him conduct the eulogy.  As the plot thickens, we find that Felix is hiding a painful secret that will have the town reexamining its prejudices and assumptions about a tortured soul who is struggling for his own redemption before it's too late.Novice director Aaron Schneider, whose previous credits were as a cinematographer of various TV shows and movies, does a solid job with a modest budget and a lean story and script by Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell.It's nice to see veteran actors like Duvall, Spacek, and Murray play older characters, wrinkles and all with enthusiasm and conviction.  Duvall does a splendid job of presenting a cipher of a man whose words are sparse and direct and slowly, as the story develops, begins to open up to reveal a complex person replete with feelings of guilt.  There are reasons perhaps for why he is the way he is.  Duvall is destined for an Oscar nomination, and Spacek arguably deserves a nod for strong support.  Bill Murray as the funeral director does a convincing job as a businessman who isn't quite a villain or hero.  He is carving a nice career niche as a dramatic character actor (aside from being a comedic superstar).The film successfully evokes the period of depression era, small town USA.  There are few items to quibble about; however, a violent break in at the funeral home doesn't really forward the plot and is never fully explained.There are similarities in Felix and the noble character in The Ballad of Cable Hogue.  In both films, the protagonist is an aged, stubborn loner, and in the end, as his life is in its twilight, the truth sets him free.  Perhaps the lesson here is that each person has a story, and some of the stories are not always evident.  With Get Low, we get to see the bittersweet tale of a broken heart.

Nicholas ""gotta have a book""","[1, 1]","Dying before you die--so you can live.I loved this movie; been thinking about it since seeing it for the first time last night.The story is simple.  An old guy, Felix Bush, in the backwoods of Tennessee goes shopping for his funeral a bit early, so he can be there to hear and enjoy the stories people have about who they think he is.  Reminds me of two important women in my life: St. Mary of Egypt and my mom.St. Mary is a saint dear to Eastern Orthodox who at the end of the 4th century went off as a recluse into the wilderness for 40 years to work out her own salvation, having encountered spiritual warfare not unlike Felix Bush, played by Robert Duvall; who turns 80 this year.  In this film he also took on 40 years of St. Mary like contemplative solitude in order to process mistakes he'd made that hurt people.  That's the theme of this flick: salvation, redemption, soul work, forgiveness--what many of the ancients called remembrance of death.  That's what this movie is about, working through and getting accounts settled before you, well, get low.  Like six feet low.My own mom did this, had her funeral early.  You can see my attraction to this plot line.  Rounding the last corner of her 16 years with breast cancer, she had a funeral party in Tucson, Arizona a decade back, electing to skip the funeral a year later with clear instructions.  Mom to kids: no obit, no service, not taking any calls, no visits allowed; a stranger will spread my ashes.  Sorry mom.  I held a service anyway.  Three people attended.  Heck, maybe the writers Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell got their idea from you!Director Aaron Schneider in 2009 pulled together Bill Murray, Sissy Spacek and Duvall to leave an experience that will stick with the viewer, doing impactful spiritual work, making us think.  This is what good movies and screenplays do.  They entertain, sure.  But they make us think.  And feel.  Already I want to watch this again, read about how and why the movie was made and why Duvall took on this role.  In a July, 2010 interview with Christianity Today, Duvall reveals his faith, why and how he played Felix Bush; and why he funded the 1997 project,  Apostle, where he plays a Pentecostal preacher in the south.Yes.

The man, Felix Bush, played by Robert Duvall, has isolated himself as part of his punishment and now as the time for his death approaches feels a strong desire to confess his misdeed and try and seek forgiveness.The movie is the story of his efforts to arrange the way in which this might all be done.

There were good stories, laughter and plenty of food afterward. It was a party. Really, the only thing missing was my Dad. I wish he could have been there.In recently released film, ""Get Low"", the character Felix Bush (Robert Duvall) wants to attend his own funeral. He wants to throw a ""funeral party."" He says he wants to give people an opportunity to tell their stories about him. But Bush does not expect the stories to be humorous or heartwarming. He has lived for forty years as a hermit with a reputation as a violent lunatic.Bush first goes to the local pastor and asks if he can buy himself a funeral, but the pastor (Gerald McRaney) astutely observes that Bush is trying to buy forgiveness. He tells Bush that forgiveness can not be purchased but is a free gift of God. We must confess our sin and receive the free gift through Christ's sacrifice. Bush leaves and finds a funeral home director (Bill Murray) who is more than happy to take his money for a ""funeral party"".As the film follows the preparations for the funeral, we begin to learn more of Bush's story in bits and pieces. We learn about his sin and his ultimate failure to atone for it on his own, but forgiveness and restoration is found.""Get Low"" is based on a true story, set in Tennessee of the 1930's. Told at a leisurely pace, the story does not offer summer distractions of CGI effects and explosions (okay, there is a fire at the beginning of the film), but it does offer its own pleasures.Bill Murray offers his dry wit within a character of that time and place. Murray has been funny for over thirty years now, while many other comedians have worn out their welcome.In fact, one of the real joys of the film is seeing old faces. Hollywood has always celebrated youth and ""physical perfection"". But there is a special pleasure in seeing the aged faces of Duvall and Sissy Spacek. Celebrated actors when they were making films decades ago in classics like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Carrie"" and ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" respectively, neither was known primarily for looks. But now there is a definite pleasure in seeing the lines and spots of age in faces of such fully lived lives.""Get Low"" can be seen as the third film in Duvall's faith trilogy, the first two being ""Tender Mercies"" and ""The Apostle"".""Tender Mercies"" won Duvall the Oscar for Best Actor and earned another Oscar for screen writer Horton Foote. (It is probably not a coincidence that Gerald McRaney's character in ""Get Low"" is Pastor Horton.) ""Tender Mercies"" features one of the most realistic and moving depictions of a man's gradual conversion to Christianity in any film.""The Apostle"" was written and directed by Duvall himself.

1349619,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B003L20ILA,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[11, 12]","As the eccentric Felix Bush in Aaron Schneider's 2010 film ""Get Low,"" Robert Duvall effortlessly and adroitly infuses the screen with the sweet nuance of the human spirit.  In his quiet, camera close-ups the audience marvels at this actor's great gift to enrich a small film with something remarkably indefinable yet magically akin to that illusive music of the spheres that supposedly sings with celestial harmony between the atoms that fuse together to create the ultimate human instrument.  As the tortured, yet shrewd and wily Bush, Duvall vibrates with a resonance beyond the machinations and the need for redemption that reverberate through an entire money-starved Depression-Era town.  At seventy-nine years young, he reigns as a master of technique, his ability to depict an entire emotional bank account spiked with the deposits of utter inexplicable happiness and the withdrawals of the most unforgivable sorrow shows the audience that he knows the secret to getting older gracefully while still maintaining full control.The other players in ""Get Low"" compliment and showcase Duvall to perfection.  Sissy Spacek as Felix's one-time girlfriend, Mattie, dually depicts the light and the shadow: a widow caught in the soft nostalgia of younger days where the flirtatiousness of dating and the ceremony of courtship still brings a youthful dimple to her cheeks and then a woman aghast at long ago goings-on behind her back of which her propriety and sense of righteousness could never allow her to comprehend let alone believe possible.  Like Duvall, Spacek demonstrates the richness of her acting tally--she flips from refined matriarch to outraged rival with the ease of expertise and confidence in one's craft.  As always, Bill Murray smartly hones the archetype of the Magician of the Tarot--part con man/dreambuilder/architect and part reluctant crusader/defender/good guy.  The ""aw-shucks"" quality that Murphy possesses as the ""swindler who could have had it all but just can't bring himself to be that bad"" works well in the character of Frank Quinn who aware of the great human drama revolving around Felix Bush and his desire to throw a funeral for himself, nevertheless finds a way to doggedly make the best of that which he has to work without the obvious compromise.  Lucas Black's (American Gothic - Complete Series,LegionandSling Blade [Blu-ray]) Buddy rounds out the quartet with infectious hopefulness--as a new father with a pretty wife he embodies what could have been--his liquid brown eyes trust in the goodness of which he absolutely believes and the audiences knows he will deliver as the representative of a newer generation.  A portion of me--the melodrama lover--wondered if Buddy would be, at the end, revealed in some way as Felix's offspring--bringing the sense of waste that Duvall's character exemplifies to some symbolic state of balance where the future lies ahead and not romanticized by a faded portrait on a cabin wall.The screenplay written by Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell moves at the right pace until the rather abrupt ending that works, but could have worked better with perhaps a little more tug on the heartstrings or a glimpse at the bitter resolution and despair of the Duvall character balanced by the youthful promise epitomized by Buddy and his family. Not that the idea of acceptance is not adequately depicted, it is, but the sentiment as shown comes off a bit murky. Perhaps at the climactic moment where the music and dancing at the funeral party seems muted and offset by Felix's need to come clean in a public announcement, a look into the inner workings of his mind and some disclosure may have worked better and moved the audience towards the acceptance acquired as depicted by the heart-wrenching gesture of Duvall proudly doing up his tie as he prepares to finally reencounter his lost love.The lush cinematography shifting between the tranquility of the woodland paradise Bush created for himself and his resignation of having only a mule in which to enjoy the ride admirably creates a rather idyllic dreamscape of what could have been.  The contrast of the town with its preconceived and sometimes dead-on perceptions of Bush, his rifle and his killer mule reminds us that as with all things of the heart, there is indeed more than what meets the eye.Bottom line? In Aaron Schneider's ""Get Low,"" the audience is treated to a wonderfully strong performance by Robert Duvall who as a self-imposed hermit living in the woods for forty years decides that in the act and ceremony of dying he will find the redemption and salvation that will bring him back to life.  A beautiful exploration that allows the audience to navigate the side alleys of the human heart. Look for Oscar nominations for Duvall and Spacek.  Highly recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",5,"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot",1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,4835,"['eccentric', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'Aaron', 'Schneider', '2010', 'film', 'Get', 'Low', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'effortlessly', 'adroitly', 'screen', 'sweet', 'nuance', 'human', 'spirit', 'quiet', 'camera', 'close-ups', 'audience', 'marvels', 'actor', 'great', 'gift', 'enrich', 'small', 'film', 'something', 'remarkably', 'indefinable', 'yet', 'magically', 'akin', 'illusive', 'music', 'spheres', 'supposedly', 'celestial', 'harmony', 'atoms', 'fuse', 'together', 'create', 'ultimate', 'human', 'instrument', 'tortured', 'shrewd', 'wily', 'Bush', 'Duvall', 'resonance', 'machinations', 'need', 'redemption', 'reverberate', 'entire', 'money-starved', 'Depression-Era', 'town', 'seventy-nine', 'years', 'young', 'master', 'technique', 'ability', 'depict', 'entire', 'emotional', 'bank', 'account', 'spiked', 'deposits', 'utter', 'inexplicable', 'happiness', 'withdrawals', 'most', 'unforgivable', 'sorrow', 'audience', 'secret', 'getting', 'older', 'gracefully', 'still', 'maintaining', 'full', 'control.The', 'other', 'players', 'Get', 'Low', 'compliment', 'showcase', 'Duvall', 'perfection', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Felix', 'one-time', 'girlfriend', 'Mattie', 'dually', 'light', 'shadow', 'widow', 'caught', 'soft', 'nostalgia', 'younger', 'days', 'where', 'flirtatiousness', 'dating', 'ceremony', 'courtship', 'still', 'youthful', 'dimple', 'cheeks', 'then', 'woman', 'aghast', 'long', 'ago', 'goings-on', 'back', 'propriety', 'sense', 'righteousness', 'could', 'never', 'allow', 'comprehend', 'let', 'alone', 'believe', 'possible', 'Duvall', 'Spacek', 'richness', 'acting', 'tally', 'refined', 'matriarch', 'outraged', 'rival', 'ease', 'expertise', 'confidence', 'one', 'craft', 'always', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'smartly', 'archetype', 'Magician', 'Tarot', 'part', 'con', 'man/dreambuilder/architect', 'part', 'reluctant', 'crusader/defender/good', 'guy', 'aw-shucks', 'quality', 'Murphy', 'swindler', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'be', 'bad', 'well', 'character', 'Frank', 'Quinn', 'who', 'aware', 'great', 'human', 'drama', 'revolving', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'desire', 'throw', 'funeral', 'nevertheless', 'way', 'doggedly', 'make', 'best', 'work', 'obvious', 'compromise', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'American', 'Gothic', 'Complete', 'Series', 'LegionandSling', 'Blade', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Buddy', 'out', 'quartet', 'infectious', 'hopefulness', 'new', 'father', 'pretty', 'wife', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'liquid', 'brown', 'eyes', 'trust', 'goodness', 'absolutely', 'audiences', 'will', 'deliver', 'representative', 'newer', 'generation', 'portion', 'melodrama', 'lover', 'wondered', 'Buddy', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'revealed', 'way', 'Felix', 'offspring', 'bringing', 'sense', 'waste', 'Duvall', 'character', 'exemplifies', 'symbolic', 'state', 'balance', 'where', 'future', 'ahead', 'not', 'romanticized', 'faded', 'portrait', 'cabin', 'wall.The', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Chris', 'Provenzano', 'C.', 'Gaby', 'Mitchell', 'right', 'pace', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'glimpse', 'bitter', 'resolution', 'despair', 'Duvall', 'character', 'balanced', 'youthful', 'promise', 'epitomized', 'Buddy', 'family', 'Not', 'idea', 'acceptance', 'not', 'adequately', 'depicted', 'sentiment', 'shown', 'off', 'bit', 'murky', 'Perhaps', 'climactic', 'moment', 'where', 'music', 'dancing', 'funeral', 'party', 'muted', 'offset', 'Felix', 'need', 'come', 'clean', 'public', 'announcement', 'look', 'inner', 'workings', 'mind', 'disclosure', 'may', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'moved', 'audience', 'acceptance', 'acquired', 'depicted', 'heart-wrenching', 'gesture', 'Duvall', 'proudly', 'doing', 'up', 'tie', 'finally', 'reencounter', 'lost', 'love.The', 'lush', 'cinematography', 'shifting', 'tranquility', 'woodland', 'paradise', 'Bush', 'created', 'resignation', 'having', 'only', 'mule', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'admirably', 'rather', 'idyllic', 'dreamscape', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'contrast', 'town', 'preconceived', 'sometimes', 'dead-on', 'perceptions', 'Bush', 'rifle', 'killer', 'mule', 'things', 'heart', 'indeed', 'more', 'what', 'eye.Bottom', 'line', 'Aaron', 'Schneider', 'Get', 'Low', 'audience', 'treated', 'wonderfully', 'strong', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'self-imposed', 'hermit', 'living', 'woods', 'forty', 'years', 'act', 'ceremony', 'dying', 'will', 'find', 'redemption', 'salvation', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'beautiful', 'exploration', 'audience', 'navigate', 'side', 'alleys', 'human', 'heart', 'Look', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Duvall', 'Spacek', 'Highly', 'recommended.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",Get Low

This delightful film, a little bit a la MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER, is a magical mountain tale set in 1930 Tennessee. Old hermit mountain man Felix Bush (a brilliant Robert Duvall) comes down into town seeking a funeral - for himself. This may not sound odd to the modern audience, we who are encouraged to do all this stuff while we're alive and well. But this is 1930 - only the very reluctant had funerals arranged for them and they really couldn't argue about it at that point.Ole Man Bush is known to the town: horrible man, with horrible stories about how horrible he is. When a loudmouth whippersnapper tries to lecture Ole Bush, the tough mountain man gives him a hell of a beating. But the reason Bush has sought out Rev. Gus Horton (an impressive Gerald McRaney) to arrange a ""live"" funeral is because he knows Rev. Gus.Old Bush ends up soliciting the services of down-on-his-luck funeral director Frank Quinn (an unusually sedate Bill Murray), and Frank is ready to bust a gut to get Bush what Bush wants. After all, the old man has been flashing a hefty wad of cash at everybody. 40 years alone, well, as Frank says to his very important assistant Buddy Robinson (Lucas Black): ""Hermit money! That's GOOD!""Appearances by Sissy Spacek as Mattie, the great Bill Cobbs as Bush's old pal Rev. Charlie Jackson, and Scott Copper round out this excellent cast. Filmed in Georgia as a stand-in for Caleb County, Tennessee and southern Illinois, this nicely paced and rather mysterious film is like a modern fairy tale and I just loved it. A great family film, and I have heard that it is partly based on a true story.While I felt exasperated at a few too modern lines (Rev. Charlie gets huffy and says, ""I am outta here"") it is nearly pitch-perfect. Duvall is not straining at a Southern accent here; his appearance, demeanor and accent are exactly as they ought to be. He looks like a cross between a rabbi and Walt Whitman. He brandishes his old double-barrel shotgun everywhere. The locations and sets fairly breathe life into this.And the rest of the story is a slowly unfolding mystery, a hidden, aching tragedy that has to be seen to be understood. While Duvall's talent dominates as always, the acting and story arc are all strong. The final scenes will keep you riveted and are worth the wait. Great film for any occasion. There is even a little mystery-within-a-mystery that has kept people nattering about it ever since. You'll know it when you have seen this. (CLUE: it may be classified as a ""whodunit"".)Don't let anyone tell you this movie was lame, unworthy or anything like that. It is one of the classics of our time in my estimation; and I often remark that Duvall is the equal or even the superior of Spencer Tracy. Just get this and don't miss having this classic in your collection.",5,"""You'll never be good if you don't know that you are!""",1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,2909,"['GET', 'LOW', '2009', 'begin', 'old', 'Southern', 'saying', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'do', 'business', 'delightful', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'la', 'MAN', 'FROM', 'SNOWY', 'RIVER', 'magical', 'mountain', 'tale', 'set', '1930', 'Tennessee', 'Old', 'hermit', 'mountain', 'man', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'down', 'town', 'seeking', 'funeral', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'odd', 'modern', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'encouraged', 'do', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'alive', 'well', '1930', 'only', 'very', 'reluctant', 'had', 'funerals', 'arranged', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'argue', 'point.Ole', 'Man', 'Bush', 'known', 'town', 'horrible', 'man', 'horrible', 'stories', 'how', 'horrible', 'When', 'loudmouth', 'whippersnapper', 'lecture', 'Ole', 'Bush', 'tough', 'mountain', 'man', 'hell', 'beating', 'reason', 'Bush', 'sought', 'out', 'Rev', 'Gus', 'Horton', 'impressive', 'Gerald', 'McRaney', 'arrange', 'live', 'funeral', 'Rev', 'Gus.Old', 'Bush', 'up', 'soliciting', 'services', 'down-on-his-luck', 'funeral', 'director', 'Frank', 'Quinn', 'unusually', 'sedate', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'Frank', 'ready', 'bust', 'gut', 'get', 'Bush', 'what', 'Bush', 'old', 'man', 'been', 'flashing', 'hefty', 'wad', 'cash', 'everybody', '40', 'years', 'alone', 'well', 'Frank', 'very', 'important', 'assistant', 'Buddy', 'Robinson', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'Hermit', 'money', 'GOOD', 'Appearances', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Mattie', 'great', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'Bush', 'old', 'pal', 'Rev', 'Charlie', 'Jackson', 'Scott', 'Copper', 'round', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Filmed', 'Georgia', 'stand-in', 'Caleb', 'County', 'Tennessee', 'southern', 'Illinois', 'nicely', 'paced', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'film', 'modern', 'fairy', 'tale', 'just', 'loved', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'have', 'heard', 'partly', 'based', 'true', 'story.While', 'felt', 'exasperated', 'few', 'too', 'modern', 'lines', 'Rev', 'Charlie', 'huffy', 'am', 'outta', 'here', 'nearly', 'pitch-perfect', 'Duvall', 'not', 'straining', 'Southern', 'accent', 'here', 'appearance', 'demeanor', 'accent', 'are', 'exactly', 'ought', 'be', 'cross', 'rabbi', 'Walt', 'Whitman', 'old', 'double-barrel', 'shotgun', 'everywhere', 'locations', 'sets', 'fairly', 'breathe', 'life', 'rest', 'story', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'hidden', 'aching', 'tragedy', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'understood', 'Duvall', 'talent', 'always', 'acting', 'story', 'arc', 'are', 'strong', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'keep', 'riveted', 'are', 'wait', 'Great', 'film', 'occasion', 'even', 'little', 'mystery-within-a-mystery', 'kept', 'people', 'nattering', 'ever', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'have', 'seen', 'CLUE', 'may', 'be', 'classified', 'whodunit', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'tell', 'movie', 'was', 'lame', 'unworthy', 'anything', 'one', 'classics', 'time', 'estimation', 'often', 'remark', 'Duvall', 'equal', 'even', 'superior', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Just', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'having', 'classic', 'collection']",Get Low

1349623,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003L20ILA,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","GET LOW has been marketed as a comedy, and while there are some fine comedic moments in this film, the overall message is a thoughtful meditation on aging, forgiving, and creating a modus exodus that will leave good memories of a life lived with some regrets. Billed as a true tall tale, the story and screenplay were written by Scott Seeke, Chris Provenzano, and C. Gaby Mitchell, a team able to capture not only a solid story but also the flavor of the Tennessee backwoods.  While director Aaron Schneider doesn't have depth in his resume, he will surely become a director much sought after as people continue to absorb the flavor and message of this film.Felix Bush (Robert Duvall in a superb performance) is a cranky old hermit who has isolated himself in his protected hovel in the forest outside a small town populated with people who have created rumors about him for the past forty years.  When Felix hears of the death of an old friend from the local pastor (Gerald McRaney) he comes to grips with his own mortality and not wanting the world to remember him with disdain he decides to throw a funeral party before he dies, an opportunity for everyone in four counties to come and tell stories about him thus clearing the air before his own demise.  Not liking the religious aspects of dying presented to him by the pastor, Frank encounters Frank Quinn (Bill Murray, in probably the finest role of his career) who is trying to salvage a debt-ridden funeral parlor with the help of his young assistant Buddy Robinson (Lucas Black, delivering a subtle and multifaceted performance).  Frank discovers that an old acquaintance Mattie (Sissy Spacek) has moved back to the little town after many years absence and provides a bit of friendship for grumpy old Frank.  Frank begins to deal with his past, memories painful to him and in heed of sharing with the town and he convinces his old pal Rev. Charlie Jackson (Bill Cobbs) to help whim with his party.  The party happens, primarily because Frank has promised that anyone who attends and buys a ticket will have a chance to win his large acreage when he does indeed die.  With a lot of help from Frank and especially Buddy, the party happens and the secrets of Frank's past are made known in a touching confessional from Frank.Rarely has a small cast been so finely assembled, a cast of actors who have won many awards but who have not appeared in an ensemble film such as this.

Schneider,"[6, 8]","Robert Duvall is called a hermit in this nice slow funny mystery, that could be seen as a Southern Gothic revival attempt if it were not so unassuming. As hermits go, Duvall does a great job and would deserve an Oscar nomination. His Felix Bush character has lived solitary 40 years alone in a cottage in the woods in Tennessee (not so sure about the geography though). The villagers tell stories about him. He is the evil old man who will shoot at children who dare to pester him. Maybe he shoots above their heads. All know that he must have killed somebody in the past.Bush comes up with the entertaining idea to have himself a funeral party while still alive and he asks Bill Murray, a splendid funeral director, to arrange it. The main attraction will be a lottery: a ticket costs 5 $ and the winner will own Bush's land. After he dies for real, that is.The main theme then is the unravelling of the man's past: why has he been a hermit? I will not say a thing about it, as this film is not of the kind that you would want to watch it again when you know the ending. Let me just say that his past crimes don't quite seem to justify his radical self-punishment.",4,What's a hermit?,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,1165,"['Robert', 'Duvall', 'called', 'hermit', 'nice', 'slow', 'funny', 'mystery', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'revival', 'attempt', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'unassuming', 'hermits', 'go', 'Duvall', 'great', 'job', 'would', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'character', 'lived', 'solitary', '40', 'years', 'alone', 'cottage', 'woods', 'Tennessee', 'not', 'so', 'sure', 'geography', 'villagers', 'tell', 'stories', 'evil', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'shoot', 'children', 'who', 'dare', 'pester', 'Maybe', 'shoots', 'heads', 'know', 'must', 'have', 'killed', 'somebody', 'past.Bush', 'up', 'entertaining', 'idea', 'have', 'funeral', 'party', 'still', 'alive', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'splendid', 'funeral', 'director', 'arrange', 'main', 'attraction', 'will', 'be', 'lottery', 'ticket', '5', 'winner', 'will', 'own', 'Bush', 'land', 'real', 'is.The', 'main', 'theme', 'then', 'unravelling', 'man', 'past', 'why', 'been', 'hermit', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'thing', 'film', 'not', 'kind', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'know', 'ending', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'past', 'crimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'justify', 'radical', 'self-punishment']",Get Low

What I got was a particularly well-written dramatic mystery with comic elements. My initial expectations were immediately changed by the opening scene, a burning house with a man in flames escaping from a second storey window. Forty years later, Felix Bush, ""The Hermit of Caleb County"" (Duvall), approaches the funeral home operator (Murray) about a ""funeral party"", which the hermit proposes to host while he is still alive. But this is no joke, it is a serious request from a man with a dark secret of forty years that he wants to reveal.The finely crafted script develops the story meticulously, taking such care that one would think time would crawl, but so well told that the time flies by. The supporting cast is superb, with Lucas Black as the assistant at the funeral home, Sissy Spacek as the old flame who remembers the hermit from forty years ago, and Bill Cobbs as the preacher who has known the hermit's secret for all those decades.Based on an actual incident and shot on location in Georgia, the ambience of the film feels entirely authentic. The Blu-ray presentation is sharp, clear, and as colorful as the somewhat drab 1930s setting allows.

Duvall carries the film, but the performances by Bill Murray, Lucas Black, and Sissy Spacek deserves recognition as well.This movie is more of a character study than anything else. There are no villains, and the antagonists either 1) have basically cameo appearances in the plot, like the bully taunting Duvall's character early in the story or 2) develop into decent human beings, like Murray's funeral director.My personal opinion: The great acting was not matched by the story. I've read some reviews giving this movie 2 and 3 stars because they felt let-down, and I understand where they're coming from. I loved the acting, but I felt I wouldn't have missed anything if I didn't see the movie. In spite of that, though, it made great points on the need of forgiveness,  not just from other people but from God Himself.This movie is rated PG-13. I think it's appropriate for teenagers, though they may disagree because they might consider it too slow moving. There is some language in the movie which the rating explanation doesn't mention, but that language is at the minimal.If you enjoy great acting, you shouldn't miss this treat.

Robert Duval does a great job (doesn't he always?) and basically it is a well acted and directed movie.  Duval's character shows more affection for his old mule than most would think possible, but he brings to mind old fellas I knew as a younger man that shared a good relationship with their mules, or horses they worked with for years.The cinematography is very good, the soundtrack and overall sound engineering is about as good as you see in any movie, and it is always nice to see period correct props and architecture throughout the show. This story reminds me of some of the stuff Faulkner wrote about the South, and his ability to convey to the reader the simple realities of human emotions and their affect on the paths we take in life.  The production company and screenwriters too I suppose, were able to get the major point across so well in this movie.  Duval's character had an unending capacity to love one woman at a level few care to imagine. His inability to accept what he perceived as a wrong on his part, was to say the least profound, so very profound as to cause him to make of his life something far different than he at first expected.It is a great movie, well worth the price here on Amazon, and one that I will definitely watch once or twice a year with the wife, for she dearly loved the show too.",5,"Great plot, well done movie too.",1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,1461,"['refreshing', 'find', 'movie', 'plot', 'surprising', 'One', 'admire', 'old', 'boy', 'when', 'clear', 'viewer', 'Robert', 'Duval', 'great', 'job', ""n't"", 'always', 'basically', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'movie', 'Duval', 'character', 'more', 'affection', 'old', 'mule', 'most', 'would', 'think', 'possible', 'mind', 'old', 'fellas', 'knew', 'younger', 'man', 'shared', 'good', 'relationship', 'mules', 'worked', 'years.The', 'cinematography', 'very', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'overall', 'sound', 'engineering', 'as', 'good', 'see', 'movie', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'period', 'correct', 'props', 'architecture', 'show', 'story', 'stuff', 'Faulkner', 'wrote', 'South', 'ability', 'convey', 'reader', 'simple', 'realities', 'human', 'emotions', 'affect', 'paths', 'take', 'life', 'production', 'company', 'screenwriters', 'too', 'suppose', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'major', 'point', 'so', 'well', 'movie', 'Duval', 'character', 'had', 'unending', 'capacity', 'love', 'one', 'woman', 'level', 'few', 'care', 'imagine', 'inability', 'accept', 'what', 'perceived', 'wrong', 'part', 'was', 'say', 'least', 'profound', 'so', 'very', 'profound', 'cause', 'make', 'life', 'something', 'far', 'different', 'first', 'expected.It', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'watch', 'once', 'twice', 'year', 'wife', 'dearly', 'loved', 'show', 'too']",Get Low

1349630,A9TG2NFA614S9,B003L20ILA,John F. Rooney,"[59, 65]","""Get Low"" takes place in the thirties and is about Felix who lives in the Tennessee woods for forty years as a foul-tempered recluse having little to do with the local townspeople. The old bearded coot is played by Robert Duvall who does a great but effortless-seeming acting job. He has a guilty secret which has driven him into seclusion. When an old acquaintance dies, he decides to have a funeral, but he decides he wants it to be a party, and he wants people to tell stories about him, and he wants to be there while he's still alive. Felix infrequently comes into town with his old mule. It's fun looking at the old thirties cars and the period hearse.It's only later as the movie moves along that you realize this is really a mystery movie. One of the first clues comes when an old flame Sissy Spacek runs out on Felix after seeing a photograph on his wall. As a viewer you wonder what gets her so agitated. What Felix wants is one particular friend, an Afro-American minister (played by Billy Cobbs) to tell what he knows about him. Not that Felix built a beautiful church for the minister but what he confessed to him.As the funeral director, Bill Murray is very winning playing the part of a man who is funny, sly, maybe a bit of a crook. He is only too happy to get paid for the strange funeral party because his business is tanking, not like his former home in Chicago where people were regularly getting bumped off.It's actually a tour de force role for Duvall, but movie acting has gotten so deeply ingrained in him that he can make it seem organic. The movie is about peeling away layers of humanity in each character, and we slowly see them evolve into better people that we can admire.It's a piece of magic storytelling which moves at a stately pace, a measured pace, but you don't get bored and you don't want it rushed because it is inevitably going to be revelatory, and Felix's secret is going to be eased out.Basically it's a very simple story concerning a man who does not want to go to his grave with a guilty conscience.Murray's young assistant, the deus ex machina, the catalyst, for a lot that happens in the story, is well-played by good-looking young Lucas Black. It's a movie of subtlety, humor, and deep human emotion, but I do have a lot of trouble remembering what I think is a lousy title.",5,Great Acting and Storytelling,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2323,"['Get', 'Low', 'place', 'thirties', 'Felix', 'who', 'Tennessee', 'woods', 'forty', 'years', 'foul-tempered', 'recluse', 'having', 'little', 'do', 'local', 'townspeople', 'old', 'bearded', 'coot', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'who', 'great', 'effortless-seeming', 'acting', 'job', 'guilty', 'secret', 'driven', 'seclusion', 'When', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'dies', 'have', 'funeral', 'be', 'party', 'people', 'tell', 'stories', 'be', 'there', 'still', 'alive', 'Felix', 'infrequently', 'town', 'old', 'mule', 'fun', 'looking', 'old', 'thirties', 'cars', 'period', 'hearse.It', 'only', 'later', 'movie', 'realize', 'really', 'mystery', 'movie', 'One', 'first', 'clues', 'when', 'old', 'flame', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'out', 'Felix', 'seeing', 'photograph', 'wall', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'what', 'so', 'agitated', 'What', 'Felix', 'one', 'particular', 'friend', 'Afro-American', 'minister', 'played', 'Billy', 'Cobbs', 'tell', 'what', 'Not', 'Felix', 'built', 'beautiful', 'church', 'minister', 'what', 'confessed', 'him.As', 'funeral', 'director', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'very', 'winning', 'playing', 'part', 'man', 'who', 'funny', 'sly', 'maybe', 'bit', 'crook', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'get', 'paid', 'strange', 'funeral', 'party', 'business', 'tanking', 'not', 'former', 'home', 'Chicago', 'where', 'people', 'were', 'regularly', 'getting', 'bumped', 'actually', 'tour', 'force', 'role', 'Duvall', 'movie', 'acting', 'gotten', 'so', 'deeply', 'ingrained', 'can', 'make', 'seem', 'organic', 'movie', 'peeling', 'away', 'layers', 'humanity', 'character', 'slowly', 'see', 'evolve', 'better', 'people', 'can', 'admire.It', 'piece', 'magic', 'storytelling', 'stately', 'pace', 'measured', 'pace', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'rushed', 'inevitably', 'going', 'be', 'revelatory', 'Felix', 'secret', 'going', 'be', 'eased', 'out.Basically', 'very', 'simple', 'story', 'concerning', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'grave', 'guilty', 'conscience.Murray', 'young', 'assistant', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'catalyst', 'lot', 'story', 'well-played', 'good-looking', 'young', 'Lucas', 'Black', 'movie', 'subtlety', 'humor', 'deep', 'human', 'emotion', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'trouble', 'remembering', 'what', 'think', 'lousy', 'title']",Get Low

For whatever reason, Sony Classic decided not to promote this movie the way big budget films are it would have been a huge hit, especially with the over 40 crowd. I only knew about the film when it was released because I stumbled across a trailer on-line and was intriqued by it. No one else had ever heard of it.Don't miss this film, it is a must have classic.

Felix Bush (Robert Duvall) a once strong, free-spirited, and crafty man has exiled himself in the woods for four decades living with a terrible secret. Despite his advanced age the local townspeople hate, and fear this old stranger who lives in seclusion. After hearing of the death of an old friend, Felix decides to orchestrate a mock funeral in order to finally publicly confess, and atone for his mortal sin. He is helped in this endeavor by undertaker Frank Quinn (Bill Murray) and his warm newly married assistant Buddy (Lucas Black). Frank Quinn a slick salesman and opportunist from Chicago will have no compunctions about setting up this bizarre funeral party despite its moral ambiguity. And so our bittersweet drama begins with Duvall's wonderfully strong stoic performance contrasted by Murray's blistering deadpan gestures, and remarks concerning the whole matter. It's their counterpointing characters like Godzilla meets King Kong that saves this movie from being too preachy, and redemptive. Thankfully it is neither but rather a good tender hearted story, well paced with great acting.  Later we are introduced to two wonderful people from Felix's past, recent widow Mattie Darrow (Sissy Spacek), and the wise old Rev.Charlie Jackson (Bill Cobbs) who is the only other person alive who knows the secrets of Felix Bush.

But it is now time for him to ""Get Low"" that is, come clean. He must do this if he is to accept his coming death.

Between them and funeral home assistant Buddy (Lucas Black) they agree to put on a Funeral Party. Felix invites anyone with a story to tell about Felix and for $5 more they can get a chance to own his 300 acres.Having exposed himself to the local townspeople he runs into old flame Mattee Darrow (Sissy Spacek) who is clearly ready to rekindle their shared past.There is a story that Felix has to tell and cannot bring himself to tell.

The one other person who knows, The Rev Charles Jackson (Bill Cobbs), and has the closest relationship with Felix cannot tell Felix's story.

Shot in and around Crawfordville, Georgia, GET LOW is a period piece that appears to be set in the late 1920s and is kind of an American Gothic tone poem that is an ode to our common humanity and the desire for redemption.  Aaron Schneider directs a superbly cast Robert Duvall, Bill Murray and Sissy Spacek in a beautifully rendered dream of a movie.  The screenplay is by Chris Provanzano and C. Gaby Mitchell and the wonderfully evocative music is by Jan A. C. Kaczmarek.  Dean Zanuck, grandson of movie mogul Darryl Zanuck, produced after a long and determined seven years effort to obtain financing.  It was worth it.  This is a gem of a film that touches the deep recesses of the heart.SPOILER ALERT:I was somewhat disappointed about the ending when Duvall's character asks for forgiveness from a town's people to whom he has not really done much harm.

As the movie progresses we learn that the reason Felix wanted this party is to finally tell his story.  One of the great injustices in the film industry is that if a movie is made for less then $100,000,000 it seems that the studios do not promote or release it as wide as a large budget movie.  It also seems award shows lately are in it for the ratings and will give awards to movies and people that don't deserve it.

1349668,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B003L20ILA,Turfseer,"[18, 36]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Get Low has an original premise based on a true story. Back in 1938 in Tennessee, a hermit, an old codger of sorts, decides to hold a funeral for himself while he's still alive. The hermit's motive for throwing the funeral is to finally hear all the bad things the townspeople have been saying about him, behind his back for years.In the movie, the hermit is Felix Bush played by Robert Duvall. He's got a long beard and has numerous 'no trespassing' signs posted at the entrance to his property. When he strolls into town, he's always armed with a shotgun. A young bully tries to taunt Felix but he turns the tables on him by knocking him out. And oh yes--Felix has a dark secret that has been the source of internal torment since he was a young man.Felix ends up conscripting funeral director, Frank Quinn, played by a rather tame Bill Murray, to organize the funeral party. He's got a young assistant, Buddy, who ends up looking after Felix. The plot complications involve Felix changing his mind about the funeral plans. At one point he calls the funeral off; later he nixes the idea of allowing the townspeople to bad mouth him at the funeral. Finally he decides to raffle off his property upon his death--the townspeople will pay a small fee and one lucky winner will be chosen at the festivities.The problem with Get Low is that the main character never grows. Throughout the film, Duvall plays a man who's perennially mad at himself. There's a lot of time spent building up to Felix's big confession at the funeral. First, all we get are many hints. In Felix's heated confrontation with Mattie (Sissy Spacek), we learn she blames him for something he did involving her sister (there's a weak attempt at comedy when Felix has a heart attack and Mattie suddenly has to pull back walking out on him, instead, ending up having to attend to him as he's passed out on the floor). There's also the Reverend Charlie Jackson, a black preacher, who knows all about Felix's dark past, but won't tell (I wondered how there was not one racist comment directed toward the good Reverend, since this was supposed to be the Jim Crow South, during the 30s).The entire Get Low storyline is predicated on Felix's confession at the funeral. Unfortunately, the confession proves much more sentimental than surprising. It seems that Felix got himself involved with Mattie's sister. One night he goes over to see her and discovers that the husband had attacked her with a hammer, knocking her out. The husband knocks over a lamp starting a fire, and Felix is unable to save the woman he loves. Just as we saw in the beginning of the film, Felix must jump out of the burning house and he's the only one to survive.Felix's confession is cathartic and the tears flow. He's finally gotten it off his chest. Nonetheless, Felix's guilt trip feels misplaced. After all, it wasn't Felix who was actually responsible for his lover's death. Nonetheless, he beats himself up for years over the event. For a good part of the movie, Felix's histrionics are played out ad infinitum--yes we get the fact that he feels bad about what happened. But when the beans are finally spilled at the end, we feel cheated since something much more dramatic is expected.Even Bill Murray disappoints here. Where was the irascible, con man when we needed him? Instead, Murray's Quinn opts out as a good guy who doesn't want to fleece anyone and ends up lending a helping hand to anyone he can.If there's anything positive here, it's mostly in the set design and music. Like 'Bonnie and Clyde', 'Get Low' evokes the bygone era of the Great Depression and scores points mainly for atmosphere.Strip away all the histrionics and one finds that Get Low is simply about a depressed guy who finally feels better after getting something off his chest that he's bottled up for years. Where's the drama in that? Mr. Duvall did not get the Oscar nomination he was looking for and rightly so. Given the long, awkward setup, a sentimental ending is the only place 'Get Low' can go!",2,"Old Codger's big 'reveal' at end, disappoints",1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,4059,"['***', 'review', 'spoilers', '***Get', 'Low', 'original', 'premise', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Back', '1938', 'Tennessee', 'hermit', 'old', 'codger', 'sorts', 'decides', 'hold', 'funeral', 'still', 'alive', 'hermit', 'motive', 'throwing', 'funeral', 'finally', 'hear', 'bad', 'things', 'townspeople', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'back', 'years.In', 'movie', 'hermit', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'played', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'got', 'long', 'beard', 'numerous', 'trespassing', 'signs', 'posted', 'entrance', 'property', 'When', 'town', 'always', 'armed', 'shotgun', 'young', 'bully', 'taunt', 'Felix', 'tables', 'knocking', 'out', 'oh', 'yes', 'Felix', 'dark', 'secret', 'been', 'source', 'internal', 'torment', 'was', 'young', 'man.Felix', 'up', 'conscripting', 'funeral', 'director', 'Frank', 'Quinn', 'played', 'rather', 'tame', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'organize', 'funeral', 'party', 'got', 'young', 'assistant', 'Buddy', 'who', 'up', 'looking', 'Felix', 'plot', 'complications', 'involve', 'Felix', 'changing', 'mind', 'funeral', 'plans', 'one', 'point', 'funeral', 'off', 'later', 'idea', 'allowing', 'townspeople', 'bad', 'mouth', 'funeral', 'Finally', 'raffle', 'off', 'property', 'death', 'townspeople', 'will', 'pay', 'small', 'fee', 'one', 'lucky', 'winner', 'will', 'be', 'chosen', 'festivities.The', 'problem', 'Get', 'Low', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'film', 'Duvall', 'man', 'who', 'perennially', 'mad', 'lot', 'time', 'spent', 'building', 'up', 'Felix', 'big', 'confession', 'funeral', 'First', 'get', 'are', 'many', 'hints', 'Felix', 'heated', 'confrontation', 'Mattie', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'learn', 'something', 'did', 'involving', 'sister', 'weak', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'when', 'Felix', 'heart', 'attack', 'Mattie', 'suddenly', 'pull', 'back', 'walking', 'out', 'instead', 'ending', 'up', 'having', 'attend', 'passed', 'out', 'floor', 'also', 'Reverend', 'Charlie', 'Jackson', 'black', 'preacher', 'who', 'Felix', 'dark', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'wondered', 'how', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'racist', 'comment', 'directed', 'good', 'Reverend', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'South', '30s', '.The', 'entire', 'Get', 'Low', 'storyline', 'predicated', 'Felix', 'confession', 'funeral', 'Unfortunately', 'confession', 'much', 'more', 'sentimental', 'surprising', 'Felix', 'got', 'involved', 'Mattie', 'sister', 'One', 'night', 'see', 'discovers', 'husband', 'had', 'attacked', 'hammer', 'knocking', 'out', 'husband', 'over', 'lamp', 'starting', 'fire', 'Felix', 'unable', 'save', 'woman', 'Just', 'saw', 'beginning', 'film', 'Felix', 'must', 'jump', 'burning', 'house', 'only', 'one', 'survive.Felix', 'confession', 'cathartic', 'tears', 'flow', 'finally', 'gotten', 'off', 'chest', 'Nonetheless', 'Felix', 'guilt', 'trip', 'feels', 'misplaced', 'was', ""n't"", 'Felix', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'responsible', 'lover', 'death', 'Nonetheless', 'up', 'years', 'event', 'good', 'part', 'movie', 'Felix', 'histrionics', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'yes', 'get', 'fact', 'bad', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'beans', 'are', 'finally', 'spilled', 'end', 'feel', 'cheated', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'dramatic', 'expected.Even', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'disappoints', 'here', 'Where', 'was', 'irascible', 'con', 'man', 'when', 'needed', 'Instead', 'Murray', 'Quinn', 'out', 'good', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'fleece', 'anyone', 'up', 'lending', 'helping', 'hand', 'anyone', 'anything', 'positive', 'here', 'mostly', 'set', 'design', 'music', ""'Bonnie"", 'Clyde', 'Low', 'bygone', 'era', 'Great', 'Depression', 'points', 'mainly', 'atmosphere.Strip', 'away', 'histrionics', 'one', 'Get', 'Low', 'simply', 'depressed', 'guy', 'who', 'finally', 'feels', 'better', 'getting', 'something', 'off', 'chest', 'bottled', 'up', 'years', 'Where', 'drama', 'Mr.', 'Duvall', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'looking', 'rightly', 'so', 'Given', 'long', 'awkward', 'setup', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'only', 'place', 'Low', 'can', 'go']",Get Low

Everyone in this movie lives up to your expectations in acting.A simple plot,Robert Duvall plays a hermit who has a secret hidden in his soul and wants a funeral party before he dies. This is not an action movie,no violence,rated PG-13 for a small amount of profanity which fits into the characters portrayed.If you are over forty years of age you will appreciate this movie gem even more.The setting,costumes,soundtrack are all blended in for effect and mood but they do not take away from the characters in the movie.Worth buying just to watch with friends or to loan to friends who are not into movies.",5,Do not miss this one!,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,913,"['why', 'have', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', 'can', 'find', 'movies', 'was', 'theaters', 'reviewed', 'never', 'saw', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'movies', 'forover', 'fifty', 'years', 'real', 'gem', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'get', 'best', 'best', 'actors', 'movie', 'not', 'guarantee', 'greatmovie', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'up', 'expectations', 'acting.A', 'simple', 'plot', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'hermit', 'who', 'secret', 'hidden', 'soul', 'funeral', 'party', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'violence', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'small', 'amount', 'profanity', 'characters', 'portrayed.If', 'are', 'forty', 'years', 'age', 'will', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'gem', 'even', 'more.The', 'setting', 'costumes', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'blended', 'effect', 'mood', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'characters', 'movie.Worth', 'buying', 'just', 'watch', 'friends', 'loan', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'movies']",Get Low
1349671,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B003L20ILA,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[0, 1]","Robert Duvall is to acting what Fred Astaire is to dancing. Should I ever meet him, I will likely kneel and kiss the hem of his garment (assuming his trousers are hemmed -- I'll look first to avoid humiliating myself).However... as much as I dislike saying it... I don't think Duvall -- who's careful about the projects he selects -- should have made this film. If you've never seen him in a ""crotchety"" role, you'll be wildly impressed -- as you should be. But I've seen him in other, similar performances, and he finds nothing new, not even a variation on his now-familiar ""rural"" voice. It's one of the rarest of the rare -- a truly exceptional performance that disappoints.Bill Murray's turn as the funeral director perfectly complements Duvall's (as Tommy Lee Jones' did in ""Lonesome Dove""). It's a finely judged performance, with its comic and serious elements enhancing, rather than contradicting, each other. ""Get Low"" is worth seeing just for Murray.The script has problems. It breaks the rule of ""Show us, don't tell us"". We're repeatedly told that the younger Felix Bush was an unusual person, one of the most-distinctive human beings you'd ever meet. But we don't /see/ this. And it ultimately doesn't matter. Felix ""is who he is"". He, and the events of his life, are believable, and that's all that's needed. A detailed backstory isn't always necessary -- or helpful.The cinematography is beautiful, but there's too much camera movement. And the rapid-fire triple-cut at 3'34"", when Felix is told the cause of Wiley Stark's death, is distracting to no obvious purpose. The Apalachian music and Depression-era songs are also unnecessary and distracting, worsening the film's vaguely self-aware tone.""Get Low"" is rated PG-13 for no obvious reason other than to give it an ""adult"" veneer. There are the adult themes of infidelity and murder, but these are talked about, not shown. There's a bit of ""strong"" language, but the strongest is a single BS.Recommended.",4,less than the sum of its parts,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",2013,1972,"['Robert', 'Duvall', 'acting', 'what', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'dancing', 'Should', 'ever', 'meet', 'will', 'likely', 'kneel', 'kiss', 'hem', 'garment', 'assuming', 'trousers', 'are', 'hemmed', ""'ll"", 'look', 'first', 'avoid', 'humiliating', '.However', 'as', 'much', 'dislike', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Duvall', 'who', 'careful', 'projects', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'film', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'crotchety', 'role', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wildly', 'impressed', 'should', 'be', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'similar', 'performances', 'nothing', 'new', 'not', 'even', 'variation', 'now-familiar', 'rural', 'voice', 'one', 'rarest', 'rare', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'Murray', 'turn', 'funeral', 'director', 'perfectly', 'Duvall', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'did', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'finely', 'judged', 'performance', 'comic', 'serious', 'elements', 'enhancing', 'rather', 'contradicting', 'other', 'Get', 'Low', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'Murray.The', 'script', 'problems', 'rule', 'Show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'repeatedly', 'told', 'younger', 'Felix', 'Bush', 'was', 'unusual', 'person', 'one', 'most-distinctive', 'human', 'beings', ""'d"", 'ever', 'meet', 'do', ""n't"", '/see/', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Felix', 'who', 'events', 'life', 'are', 'believable', 'needed', 'detailed', 'backstory', ""n't"", 'always', 'necessary', 'helpful.The', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'too', 'much', 'camera', 'movement', 'rapid-fire', 'triple-cut', ""3'34"", 'when', 'Felix', 'told', 'cause', 'Wiley', 'Stark', 'death', 'distracting', 'obvious', 'purpose', 'Apalachian', 'music', 'Depression-era', 'songs', 'are', 'also', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'worsening', 'film', 'vaguely', 'self-aware', 'tone', 'Get', 'Low', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'obvious', 'reason', 'other', 'give', 'adult', 'veneer', 'are', 'adult', 'themes', 'infidelity', 'murder', 'are', 'talked', 'not', 'shown', 'bit', 'strong', 'language', 'strongest', 'single', 'BS.Recommended']",Get Low

It's a story that reveals itself slowly, and with each stage of revelation comes more understanding of the people and their past and present lives. With a mix of top tier actors the likes of Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek and surprisingly Bill Murray, ""Get Low"" gives you the almost comical situation of a man wanting his funeral celebration while he's alive. Within the first minutes you realize there's much more than a comedic background to the story as the suspense and smarts of it take over.I enjoyed this movie for it's focus on what it means to ask forgiveness.  You know the old saying, ""and the truth shall set you free.""  Well, here you witness a unique telling of one man's journey toward freedom by breaking the shackles that bind him.
