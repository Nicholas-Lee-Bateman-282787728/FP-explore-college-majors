Even so, I was lured into renting it by recognizable cast names: Corbin Bernsen, Tom Sizemore and of course, Malcolm McDowell as Old Nick himself, a delicious cinematic prospect if ever there was one. The synopsis was also intriguing: a law student sues Satan for $8 trillion.Sure enough, the movie did turn out to be a 90 minute exercise in catechism logic, addressing age-old questions like ""Why is there a God?"" or ""Why did He let (fill in the blank) die?"" McDowell does get his chance as Beezelbub to literally vent fire and brimstone, yet after his impassioned thunder-rumbling ""I hate you all"" soliloquy, the judge tells the jurors (and us by extension) to disregard everything this crazy person just said (Yes, Sister!). Weakest of all, at the end, our prosecuting plaintiff wakes up in a library. The whole courtroom adventure was just a dream, BUT... his Christian faith has been renewed by it.OK then.I did however like Satan's claim that he invented noise: car alarms, leaf blowers, motorcycles, etc. (No comment here on whether a defendant is obligated to testify for the prosecution.)",3,The jury's in,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,1225,"['When', 'saw', 'SUING', 'THE', 'DEVIL', '2011', 'REDBOX', 'last', 'year', 'something', 'told', 'was', 'Christian', 'family', 'values', 'films', 'Even', 'so', 'was', 'lured', 'renting', 'recognizable', 'cast', 'names', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'Tom', 'Sizemore', 'course', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Old', 'Nick', 'delicious', 'cinematic', 'prospect', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'synopsis', 'was', 'also', 'intriguing', 'law', 'student', 'Satan', '8', 'trillion.Sure', 'enough', 'movie', 'did', 'turn', 'out', 'be', '90', 'minute', 'exercise', 'catechism', 'logic', 'addressing', 'age-old', 'questions', 'Why', 'there', 'God', 'Why', 'did', 'let', 'fill', 'blank', 'die', 'McDowell', 'get', 'chance', 'Beezelbub', 'literally', 'vent', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'yet', 'impassioned', 'thunder-rumbling', 'hate', 'soliloquy', 'judge', 'jurors', 'extension', 'disregard', 'everything', 'crazy', 'person', 'just', 'said', 'Yes', 'Sister', 'Weakest', 'end', 'prosecuting', 'plaintiff', 'up', 'library', 'whole', 'courtroom', 'adventure', 'was', 'just', 'dream', 'BUT', 'Christian', 'faith', 'been', 'renewed', 'it.OK', 'then.I', 'did', 'however', 'Satan', 'claim', 'invented', 'noise', 'car', 'alarms', 'leaf', 'blowers', 'motorcycles', 'etc', 'comment', 'here', 'defendant', 'obligated', 'testify', 'prosecution']",N/A

1535041,A385SBEEJ15HHJ,B007NU538E,Cindy Navarro,"[8, 12]","Suing The Devil is a Christian legal thriller/parody that is unlike any other film I have seen. This ""trial of the century"" is between poor law student Luke O'Brien... and Satan! The team of lawyers are reminiscent of the OJ Simpson trial, and the news panel discussing this trial in-depth can be seen on any cable news channel, but it gives a feeling of authenticity. There is no doubt that a trial like this would be given world-wide, round-the-clock coverage.There are uneven spots, especially with some of the acting, but Malcolm McDowell's performance as Satan makes this a film well worth watching. It is a very humorous portrayal, yet it makes it easier to see how insidious the devil really is and how attractive sin can be packaged. It has a more evangelical approach than some of the other faith-based films, but can appeal to a wide variety of people. Truth is presented in the film, and that can be controversial to some. I am a Christian, so I look at the message in this movie from the POV of a believer.

1535049,AFAN848Y1O7A3,B007NU538E,Scott Prazak,"[4, 8]","If you don't have the resources to devote to a project, don't do it!  For the majority of independent Christian films, their limited budget comes nowhere close to equating the director's vision.  Unfortunately, this one falls right into that boat too.  I'm not questioning or doubting the hearts and good intentions of the people involved in making these films.  However, if you are going to introduce a film to the Hollywood crowd and mainstream America, it has to be up to a certain standard.When I heard that this was being made and that Malcolm McDowell was playing the role of the fallen angel himself, I was actually pretty intrigued.  McDowell is always super in the role of the villain, and you can't get any darker than this one.  In the end, his performance was terrific as always, funny, and his dialogue well written.  However, the caliber of acting from the supporting cast, particularly its protagonist (Bart Bronson) was so atrocious, I often found myself wincing through it all and just forwarding to the scenes with Malcolm.  Even the scenes with Corbin and Tom (albeit brief) were a complete waste and amateurishly done.It's really a shame, because this film had such potential.  Great modern contemporary Christian films CAN be done, and when they are, the result is truly amazing (Courageous, Fireproof, Facing The Giants, To Save A Life, The Climb, etc.).  Not this time however.

1535050,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B007NU538E,The Piper at the Gates,"[3, 5]","Ok, first of all my review probably isn't going to be the most popular one written, since a lot of the reviews here seem to ""praise"" this film quite a lot (And yes, that was a religious pun). But no matter what comments I may get from writing this, I feel another opinion, one that's perhaps not so religiously biased, would be useful to others that might be thinking about viewing this film. Anyway, I came along this movie, read the plot, and was instantly interested simply because the premise of the film sounded so silly. In a nutshell, a guy has a lot of bad things happen to him, sees all the bad in the world, and decides to sue the Devil for 8 trillion dollars. Sounds crazy? Yeah, well it'll all make sense once the film is over, I promise. Seeing that this was in fact not listed as comedy, but a ""christian thriller"" film, and actually having ""real"" actors in its cast, I thought perhaps this film is some crazy, looked-over, clever gem that I had missed. It was only when I popped the DVD in, that realized this was a Christian faith-based film. Quite honestly, I was definitely disappointed. These films aren't what I normally watch at all. Not to say I don't mind films that have a certain good meaning, good moral standards, or even religious undertones about them. Nor do I only enjoy movies with sex and violence in them. But what I don't want to see is something that's completely biased and full of fundamentalism.  Of course, this film is directed towards the religious sect. Its trying to send a message, perhaps win some people over. What it did for me was make me laugh more times than a lot of comedies I've seen recently. And I'm really being serious when I say that. This film has quite a few funny parts in it. Malcolm McDowell is actually quite good as Satan. And he has some great moments. My favorite perhaps being when he kicks a Kiss fan in the balls, and says he's a Tom Jones fan. Perhaps when he's sending out spam emails, his bathroom humor, or his quoting of Nicholson from ""A Few Good Men"".  Whatever it may be, McDowell is the best part of the film, hands down.  Tom Sizemore, though a small role, has some great lines as well. Speaking of McDowell and Sizemore, was casting these two actors as antagonists done in some clever way because of their history with some of the ""evil"" things this movie talks about? Or perhaps the makers are too young to remember that McDowell played in two highly controversial films, containing extreme violence and pornography,  ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Caligula""?  And that Sizemore has been arrested numerous times, and has battled drug addiction? I'm not saying that any of this should mean anything at all, because acting is simply a job. But for these two to be cast in a Christian film is kind of ironic to me. Then again, maybe that's why they aren't playing ""good guys"" in the film! Even as a Christian film, I have to be honest, there are some clever jokes thrown in. The acting as a whole isn't that bad actually, but it definitely has its weak points. Especially the role of main character's wife, who has a horrible accent!Overall, I'm actually not sure how serious this film is taking itself. Yes, there's a surprise ending, and maybe that's the reason for a lot of the jokes and why some things didn't make a lot of sense. With that said, you have to watch the whole film right to the end to understand what I'm meaning, trust me. But how serious was it really trying to be? Is this film actually accusing the Devil for all or most of the things mentioned in the film? As a whole, I do have to give this movie some credit. I think it was trying to be both funny, clever, and of course have a true religious purpose.  Whatever the case, I looked pass all the religious stuff and saw this film as more a comedy. After all, Satan had me laughing throughout.
