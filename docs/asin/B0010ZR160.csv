Behind the headlines of child abduction, the movie is disturbingly real with events that develop naturally.  As complicated as life itself, the film captures a mystery of tangled proportions.Little four-year-old Amanda MacReady has been kidnapped from her Dorchester, MA home.  We see private detective, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) watching the latest breaking stories of her abduction on television with his girlfriend and co-partner, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).  Soon afterward, Amanda's Aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and Uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver) come to their apartment and ask to hire them.  The young investigative couple is skittish at the prospect of taking on a private case while troops of police officers are on the assignment, and its nature isn't exactly like the ones they've tackled before.But take it they do and soon they meet some tough, but weary veterans, including Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and Det. Denny Bressant (Ed Harris).  Jack Doyle has some pretty harsh words for the Private I. who's skeptical of another investigator and takes each new case personally.  Included in his past is his own daughter who was kidnapped and found dead just yards away from his own residence.  Det. Remy takes his work only slightly less to heart.Backing Patrick is Helene MacCready, who eventually trusts him more than the police to find her only daughter.  This gives Patrick the advantage of finding some seedy characters in her own life.  Quickly we find out she's a coke addict and has a network of connections that take them into a whole underworld of shady drug dealers and predators.  Soon we're introduced to turf leader ""Cheese"" (Edi Gathegi)  and her boyfriend, Leon (Mark Margolis).  (Her family is logically upset with the situation and Helene's irresponsible behavior.)  Seldom does the drama fail to surprise while managing to keep the plot lines accessible.Directed and co-written by Ben Affleck (whose co-writing for 'Good Will Hunting' won him an Oscar) the movie gets its footing quickly and keeps our interest with its labyrinth investigation and revealingly dark characters.  Amy Ryan's worthy Oscar nomination is the high-water mark of acting amongst a fine cast, including similarly nominated Casey Affleck (albeit for his more nervous and nuanced performance in 'The Assassination of Jesse James...') who keep us on our toes along with the Brothers Affleck.  Engaging and thought-provoking in its ramifications without trying to exploit, `Gone, Baby, Gone' achieves quite a balancing act.",4,"""Sheep Among Wolves""",1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,2589,"['Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'as', 'unsettling', 'intriguing', 'headlines', 'child', 'abduction', 'movie', 'disturbingly', 'real', 'events', 'develop', 'naturally', 'As', 'complicated', 'life', 'film', 'mystery', 'tangled', 'proportions.Little', 'four-year-old', 'Amanda', 'MacReady', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Dorchester', 'MA', 'home', 'see', 'private', 'detective', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'watching', 'latest', 'breaking', 'stories', 'abduction', 'television', 'girlfriend', 'co-partner', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'Soon', 'afterward', 'Amanda', 'Aunt', 'Bea', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Uncle', 'Lionel', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'come', 'apartment', 'ask', 'hire', 'young', 'investigative', 'couple', 'skittish', 'prospect', 'taking', 'private', 'case', 'troops', 'police', 'officers', 'are', 'assignment', 'nature', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'tackled', 'before.But', 'take', 'do', 'soon', 'meet', 'tough', 'weary', 'veterans', 'including', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Det', 'Denny', 'Bressant', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'words', 'Private', 'I.', 'who', 'skeptical', 'investigator', 'new', 'case', 'personally', 'Included', 'past', 'own', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'found', 'dead', 'just', 'yards', 'away', 'own', 'residence', 'Det', 'Remy', 'work', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'heart.Backing', 'Patrick', 'Helene', 'MacCready', 'who', 'eventually', 'more', 'police', 'find', 'only', 'daughter', 'Patrick', 'advantage', 'finding', 'seedy', 'characters', 'own', 'life', 'Quickly', 'find', 'out', 'coke', 'addict', 'network', 'connections', 'take', 'whole', 'underworld', 'shady', 'drug', 'dealers', 'predators', 'Soon', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'turf', 'leader', 'Cheese', 'Edi', 'Gathegi', 'boyfriend', 'Leon', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'family', 'logically', 'upset', 'situation', 'Helene', 'irresponsible', 'behavior', 'Seldom', 'drama', 'fail', 'surprise', 'managing', 'keep', 'plot', 'lines', 'accessible.Directed', 'co-written', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'co-writing', ""'Good"", 'Will', 'Hunting', 'won', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'footing', 'quickly', 'interest', 'labyrinth', 'investigation', 'revealingly', 'dark', 'characters', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'high-water', 'mark', 'acting', 'amongst', 'fine', 'cast', 'including', 'similarly', 'nominated', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'more', 'nervous', 'nuanced', 'performance', ""'The"", 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'who', 'keep', 'toes', 'Brothers', 'Affleck', 'Engaging', 'thought-provoking', 'ramifications', 'trying', 'exploit', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'achieves', 'quite', 'balancing', 'act']",N/A

A child's disappearance is not a pleasant subject even when it is a backdrop for a great detective thriller. I am sorry I was reluctant. This film is one of the best films made in the last year. Ben Affleck directs a film every bit as masterful as Sean Penn's MYSTIC RIVER. The story takes place in a small community in Massachusetts.  Ben's brother, Casey plays the role of a young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, who is asked by the aunt of a child, gone missing, to aid the police in the search of her three year old niece. Kenzie's partner, Angela Gennaro, is ably portrayed by actress Michelle Monaghan. The search for the child is pretty straight forward; however, by the end of the film it becomes obvious that nothing is as it appears. Like the film CHINATOWN of some years ago this story has a lot going on under the surface. There are some tough moral dilemmas faced by the detective couple the resolution of which will give the viewer a lot to ponder.

1128401,A3GKU0NILLHDWQ,B0010ZR160,A. Hickman,"[2, 4]","""Gone Baby Gone"" is a film that has shown up on a couple of top ten lists for the year (it clocks in at a respectable number six on Richard Roeper's).  The big surprise is that Ben Affleck, of all people, directed.  His brother Casey stars and is quite charasmatic in a role that would seem to work against type.  He plays Patrick Kenzie, a private detective who, with his girlfriend (and partner), specializes in missing persons cases, and is a textbook case of what the critics like to call the ""moral center"" of the film.  Not that the morality of the decision he has to make at the end of the film is all that debatable.  Apart from some mumbling and a couple of incoherencies in the plot, the story of the kidnapping of a little girl managed to hold my attention for two hours.  Affleck is a genuinely watchable presence (he barely registered for me in ""Gerry,"" the only other film I'm aware of him from), and Morgan Freeman phones in his usual charasmatic fifteen minutes.  Off-screen couple Ed Harris and Amy Madigan are both welcome additions to the cast, although Madigan (as Aunt ""Bea"") disappears all too early in the film.  I also liked seeing John (""Beverly Hills Cop"") Ashton back on the screen.

With plot twists and turns, and yet highly realistic and thus very believable, it is based on a great book by a man had worked in the child welfare arena.This has a very engrossing story centering on the kidnapping of a small girl, with her addict mother's lack of cooperation and bad ways hindering the investigation, indeed, possibly being a reason the kidnapping occurred successfully in the first place.  With some mildly unclear byplay between the couple who are private investigators and the police force.  The story is an unusual one in movies in the sense that it seems as if the entire story is over with 2/3 of the way into the film; but, then, at that point, it's as if it REALLY starts.  This movie keeps your attention, although easily-- not requiring you to scrutinize every second (or else you'll miss something), but instead, it's an easy viewing.  The plot twists are just interesting, unique, and well-acted.  Despite this, REALISM is the order of the day here-- the true good and bad in life.The blu-ray quality is beautiful: sharp, detailed, beautiful color, and very realistic; you're watching a movie in hi-def but it looks realistic, not ultra bright or color-saturated for HD, instead just excellent and not provoking thoughts about the picture quality one way or the other. The sound is excellent as well, and I don't have exterior speakers or a sound bar, just my TV's own speakers.This is one of the finest movies I've seen in the last 20 years, ultra-professional and creative in every detail, and you stay riveted to the end; and yet, as I might expect, it's selling for only $6.00 in blu-ray, because a large number of Americans would rather see plot-less and pointless ""fun"" entertainment requiring no directorial, screenwriting, or acting talent, such as a Kardashian TV show. A very well-crafted film such as this, conversely, is apparently not very popular, although based on a fine book and having benefited from ALL of the above talents in excess; no, this film is evidently of little interest to the American public today.What a pity.Let the ""crowd"" continue to flock to the next ultra-stupid Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson garbage, or another Ben Stiller movie where he plays the same wide-eyed, dumb schnook, as he always does. Me, I'll instead give all kudos to the cast and director of Gone Baby Gone, and will seek out more movies from those involved, such as Ben and Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Ed Harris, all of whom, for years, could always be counted on for believable and superior performances.

1128406,A3GKD8MAHURH91,B0010ZR160,alltatup,"[1, 3]","This film is gripping and I enjoyed it from start almost to finish. I just have one question: Why does Hollywood treat the viewers like they're idiots?The main character commits murder (he shoots the pedophile in the head, and then complains that he doesn't feel right about it) and yet he gets away with it. He doesn't turn himself in.  At the same time, he's on his moral high horse about returning the child to her family and her ""real"" mother's right to have her daughter back--and the movie makes it clear that she is a lousey mother who doesn't care about her daughter's wellbeing in the least.What I don't like is being treated like I am stuid; I can handle all kinds of suspension of disbelief when watching a great movie, but not this kind of contradiction, which renders the main character's actions completel unbelievable.

1128413,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0010ZR160,Andrew Desmond,"[5, 7]","""Gone, Baby, Gone"" is a film with great potential that somehow fails to deliver.  It is a ""whodunit"" that, in the end, lapses into implausibility.  Only the most credulous viewer could believe all the twists and turns of the plot.The essence of the story involves the abduction of a small girl who was left unattended while the mother went to a bar.  Apparently, this was not an isolated occasion.  The mother is a heavy drinker and drug taker who mixes with bad company.  Often, the child is left to her own devices.My criticism of the film hinges on the implausible aspects of the plot.  The film makers would have us believe that a high level conspiracy can exist within the Boston Police Department.  Indeed, the conspiracy involves the covering up of child abduction and the resort to near vigilante tactics.  Perhaps I have said too much and given away some aspects of the plot.  This may be so but it is not entirely so.  I am sure most viewers will not ""click"" to the story until near its end.  Regardless, a cleverly contrived plot should not allow a story line that, upon reflection, is simply not believable.Before I finish, I have one further criticism.  The starring role is played by Casey Afleck.  He performs well except for one point.  Namely, his dialogue often descends to mumbling. Is it just me?  I suspect not.  If viewers have trouble comprehending dialogue from the lead player, then the film has problems.",3,A Straining of Credulity,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1430,"['Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'film', 'great', 'potential', 'somehow', 'deliver', 'whodunit', 'end', 'implausibility', 'Only', 'most', 'credulous', 'viewer', 'could', 'believe', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot.The', 'essence', 'story', 'abduction', 'small', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'unattended', 'mother', 'went', 'bar', 'Apparently', 'was', 'not', 'isolated', 'occasion', 'mother', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'drug', 'taker', 'who', 'bad', 'company', 'Often', 'child', 'left', 'own', 'devices.My', 'criticism', 'film', 'hinges', 'implausible', 'aspects', 'plot', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'high', 'level', 'conspiracy', 'can', 'exist', 'Boston', 'Police', 'Department', 'Indeed', 'conspiracy', 'covering', 'child', 'abduction', 'resort', 'vigilante', 'tactics', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'given', 'away', 'aspects', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'not', 'entirely', 'so', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'click', 'story', 'end', 'Regardless', 'cleverly', 'contrived', 'plot', 'should', 'not', 'allow', 'story', 'line', 'reflection', 'simply', 'not', 'finish', 'have', 'one', 'further', 'criticism', 'starring', 'role', 'played', 'Casey', 'Afleck', 'well', 'one', 'point', 'Namely', 'dialogue', 'often', 'mumbling', 'just', 'suspect', 'not', 'viewers', 'have', 'trouble', 'comprehending', 'dialogue', 'lead', 'player', 'then', 'film', 'problems']",N/A
1128414,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0010ZR160,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Talk about a film that leaves me conflicted, `Gone Baby Gone' delivered in unexpected ways; good and bad.  For me, this is not a film I'd ever watch again, for it isn't quite good enough to warrant it, but it is a film that is worth seeing at least once.I'll give it that.I'll get the plot out of the way first, that way I'm freed up to ramble a bit.  A little girl is kidnapped in South Boston, and the loving aunt hires a private-eye named Patrick to augment the police investigation in hopes that he'll find the little girl quicker.  Patrick, or more precisely his girlfriend/partner Angie, is hesitant, especially after meeting the young girls horrific mother Helene, but a single picture of a smiling little angel is enough to persuade both to take the case.  Patrick has street connections that aid him in uncovering some details the cop's lack, and so together they begin to unravel Helene's past and what could have led to the kidnapping of her daughter.But nothing is as it seems.I'll start with the good.  The film is extremely affecting.  My wife even muttered, as the final frames rolled on, that this film made her heart hurt.  There were many moments where I muttered, aloud, ""oh no, please not that"", and I know that seems odd to say that is a GOOD thing, but I commend a film that can reach me that deeply.  This film did that.  I also want to commend Affleck's direction, for he understands how to build tension.  Even though, for me, the film winds up being overly worked, it is not his fault but the scripts fault (which he actually helped pen, so I guess it is his fault).  His direction (and the films editing especially) is outstanding though.  As far as actual performances go, there are three that stand out for me.  No, not Amy Ryan, Casey Affleck, Ed Harris or Morgan Freeman.  For me, Amy Madigan, Titus Welliver and Michelle Monaghan steal this film.  Madigan has a brittle and convincing attachment to this situation, so much so that she breaks your heart in her few small scenes.  Titus is fantastic as the conflicted and tortured Lionel.  His final scenes especially are stunning.  For me, the biggest surprise came from Monaghan.  Her character's transformation is so believable and touching.  You completely understand that maternal side to her character and the fact that a child really, truly affects a woman in ways indescribable.  Her hospital scene alone was just gut wrenching in its subtle power.She was leagues better than the gimmicky Amy Ryan.Casey Affleck was a disappointment for me.  I remember being STUNNED at how powerful his performance was in `...Jesse James...' that same year, and yet here he was stale and kind of silly.  It's funny because I kind of liked the way the script made him fearless, but he comes off rather corny when he's talking smack.  Maybe it's his fragile frame, but he was just unconvincing to me.  I'm not a fan of Ed Harris, but I enjoyed him here, even if he wasn't a standout.The less said about Amy Ryan the better.For me though, the films biggest drawback is the script.  I'm all for plot twists, and at times I even enjoy a twist on a twist on a twist (or was it a switch on and switch on a switch?) but the way that this films `revelations' are played out is rather tedious and makes the film feel overly long.  I was waiting for it to just get to the point and END.  I felt that some of the side-plots were unnecessary (the child abuser sequence, while affecting, was just not needed).  I think that some of the character developments were obvious (Remy seems shady from the beginning, Cheese is so truthful that believing he lied is hard to do) and so it made it hard to allow yourself to be duped enough to enjoy the `twists'.I think that the ending is appropriate, and I really liked the fact that it was heartbreaking yet in a subtle, more naturalistic way.In the end, the film is good but far from great.  I'd recommend you see it once, but just know that this is not a film that will make you feel good.  It is devastating from start to finish and really tests your tear ducts.  I only wish that the script had been heavily edited, and that a more accomplished actor were cast in the lead.  Yes, Amy Ryan was a gimmick, but she's forgivable (although her critic award sweep and Oscar nomination is not).  Affleck (Casey, not Ben) is not forgiven for being unconvincing.",3,"In parts this is really moving, but in the end it kind of falls apart...",1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,4357,"['Talk', 'film', 'conflicted', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'delivered', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'good', 'bad', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once.I', ""'ll"", 'give', 'that.I', ""'ll"", 'get', 'plot', 'way', 'first', 'way', ""'m"", 'freed', 'up', 'ramble', 'bit', 'little', 'girl', 'kidnapped', 'South', 'Boston', 'loving', 'aunt', 'private-eye', 'named', 'Patrick', 'augment', 'police', 'investigation', 'hopes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'quicker', 'Patrick', 'more', 'precisely', 'girlfriend/partner', 'Angie', 'hesitant', 'especially', 'meeting', 'young', 'girls', 'horrific', 'mother', 'Helene', 'single', 'picture', 'smiling', 'little', 'angel', 'enough', 'persuade', 'take', 'case', 'Patrick', 'street', 'connections', 'aid', 'uncovering', 'details', 'cop', 'lack', 'so', 'together', 'begin', 'unravel', 'Helene', 'past', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'kidnapping', 'daughter.But', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'start', 'good', 'film', 'extremely', 'affecting', 'wife', 'even', 'muttered', 'final', 'frames', 'rolled', 'film', 'made', 'heart', 'hurt', 'were', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'muttered', 'aloud', 'oh', 'please', 'not', 'know', 'odd', 'say', 'GOOD', 'thing', 'commend', 'film', 'can', 'reach', 'deeply', 'film', 'did', 'also', 'want', 'commend', 'Affleck', 'direction', 'how', 'build', 'tension', 'Even', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'overly', 'worked', 'not', 'fault', 'scripts', 'fault', 'actually', 'helped', 'pen', 'guess', 'fault', 'direction', 'films', 'editing', 'especially', 'outstanding', 'though', 'As', 'far', 'actual', 'performances', 'go', 'are', 'three', 'stand', 'out', 'No', 'not', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'steal', 'film', 'Madigan', 'brittle', 'convincing', 'attachment', 'situation', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'few', 'small', 'scenes', 'Titus', 'fantastic', 'conflicted', 'tortured', 'Lionel', 'final', 'scenes', 'especially', 'are', 'stunning', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'came', 'Monaghan', 'character', 'transformation', 'so', 'believable', 'touching', 'completely', 'understand', 'maternal', 'side', 'character', 'fact', 'child', 'really', 'truly', 'woman', 'ways', 'indescribable', 'hospital', 'scene', 'alone', 'was', 'just', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'subtle', 'power.She', 'was', 'leagues', 'better', 'gimmicky', 'Amy', 'Ryan.Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'disappointment', 'remember', 'being', 'STUNNED', 'how', 'powerful', 'performance', 'was', 'Jesse', 'James', 'same', 'year', 'yet', 'here', 'was', 'stale', 'kind', 'silly', 'funny', 'kind', 'liked', 'way', 'script', 'made', 'fearless', 'rather', 'corny', 'when', 'talking', 'smack', 'fragile', 'frame', 'was', 'just', 'unconvincing', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'enjoyed', 'here', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'standout.The', 'less', 'said', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'better.For', 'films', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'script', ""'m"", 'plot', 'twists', 'times', 'even', 'enjoy', 'twist', 'twist', 'twist', 'was', 'switch', 'switch', 'switch', 'way', 'films', 'revelations', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'rather', 'tedious', 'film', 'feel', 'overly', 'long', 'was', 'waiting', 'just', 'get', 'point', 'END', 'felt', 'side-plots', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'child', 'abuser', 'sequence', 'affecting', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'needed', 'think', 'character', 'developments', 'were', 'obvious', 'Remy', 'shady', 'beginning', 'Cheese', 'so', 'truthful', 'believing', 'lied', 'hard', 'do', 'made', 'hard', 'allow', 'be', 'duped', 'enough', 'enjoy', ""twists'.I"", 'think', 'ending', 'appropriate', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'yet', 'subtle', 'more', 'naturalistic', 'end', 'film', 'good', 'far', 'great', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'see', 'once', 'just', 'know', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'devastating', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'tests', 'tear', 'ducts', 'only', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'heavily', 'edited', 'more', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'were', 'cast', 'lead', 'Yes', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'was', 'gimmick', 'forgivable', 'critic', 'award', 'sweep', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'not', 'Affleck', 'Casey', 'not', 'Ben', 'not', 'forgiven', 'being', 'unconvincing']",N/A

After watching it though, I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie was considerably well made, a great start for Ben Affleck's directorial career. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehan and adapted by Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone starts out with a deceivingly simple plot and expands and grows with great intensity. Simply put, the story is wonderfully written.There is an impressive mix of character dynamics in the movie. In other words, certain characters relations to each other greatly facilitate a complex and interesting story. Along with its fine plot, Gone Baby Gone has a phenomenal cast and they help to display these dynamics excellently. On top of Amy Ryan's Oscar nominated role (which is quite deserved I think), Casey Affleck, Ed Harris, and Morgan freeman deliver splendid performances as well. While the performances are what we should expect of actors with the experience of the latter two, Casey Affleck is deservedly building an impressive resume too.In keeping with a good plot, deeper messages in the story very thought provoking. In some senses, it displays the traditional dilemma of ""do the ends justify the means"" but does so in a way that makes it too hard to simply take one side or the other.An outstanding debut for Ben Affleck: the director.

1128416,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0010ZR160,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","As a native Bostonian, albeit one who moved out of the area 21 years ago, I watch all these Boston-based adaptations to see how well the filmmakers get the essence of the place.  Even in the best ones, there's always one thing to distract and annoy.  In the Damon/Affleck breakthrough 'Good Will Hunting,' there was Robin Williams' awful accent (to think he won a Oscar for that).  In the otherwise excellent 'Mystic River,' there was Laura Linney's beyond-bad (reaching into unintentional comedy) 'effort.'Well, you can rip up the record books, because Ben Affleck has conceived and directed what will forever be the unimpeachable standard of Boston-based films.  'Gone Baby Gone' is terrific in every imaginable way - twisty but tight storytelling, believable characters positively steeped in blue-collar Boston street culture, and an ending that will keep you talking and debating long after the lights come up.It's incredible that this is Affleck's first shot at directing.  I really thought this guy had completely lost his way.  It had to be getting to him, watching Matt Damon make these series of great career choices while he Gigli-ed and Bennifer-ed his way into something of a national punchline.  But marrying Jennifer Garner and 'Gone Baby Gone' count as back-to-back home runs.There's another great performance by Ed Harris (what's up with the hairpiece though - it wasn't required & really distracts).  Amy Ryan should get an Oscar nomination - hard to believe she's from Queens, not Dorchester. Casey Affleck will turn out to be a better actor than his brother - credit Ben for recognizing that and giving Casey the role.  This isn't nepotism.  Casey brings an understated, steely confidence to the role that becomes more believable as the film goes on.Okay, this review isn't complete without singling out the most amazing performance: Jill Quigg is a Boston resident who talked her way into a role (Ben Affleck had been looking for locals to inflect the movie with rich Boston character).  In a small role, she plays Helene's best friend, Dottie.  I can't do her performance justice here.  It's jawdroppingly good.Various professional reviews about the movie mention that Amy Ryan had a tape of Quigg on her iPod & played it over and over to get the essence of her character, Helene.

I found him open and down to earth, and while he wasn't able to pull things together, I became interested in his work.I've now seen the final product and I am impressed. It's not often I buy a DVD for my collection, but this time I did. All success storys begin with savvy casting, and here the producers made truly excellent choices: Casey Affleck might be a bit fuzzy cheeked, but he fit the iron-willed investigator perfectly, and the chemistry between him and his business partner/girlfriend Allie (Michelle Monaghan)felt genuine. Of course, with old pros Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles, the backup cast had to outdo itself and happily that's what they did. I was particularly taken with Amy Ryan as the undeserving and graceless mother of the kidnapped child. She was so convincing, I actually hoped she wouldn't end up getting her kid back.Gone Baby Gone is not a happy story. It depicts life in the city where everything is hard-edged, nothing is ever for sure and openness and honesty are usually the first casualties.

This gripping 'lost child' drama, cutting through the layers of lower-income South Boston, displays amazing sensitivity, and Oscar-caliber performances by a top-notch cast.Adapted from Boston novelist Dennis Lehane's best-selling novel, the film unapologetically views a neighborhood crushed by poverty, alcoholism, and drug addition, yet clinging to a stubborn pride. When a little girl disappears, the child's aunt (Amy Madigan), frustrated by the slow progress of dedicated cop Morgan Freeman, hires local detective team Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) and Michelle Monaghan to join in the search. Despite only cursory assistance from the detectives handling the case (Ed Harris and John Ashton), Affleck discovers a web of lies and deceit, starting with the child's drug addict mother (Oscar-nominated Amy Ryan). As the layers of deception unravel, questions of integrity and 'best interest' are raised, lifting the film far above a simple detective story!In many ways, Affleck's 'Patrick Kenzie' is a descendant of film detectives of the past, from Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe, to Lew Harper; a man with a code of honor and unshakable integrity, hidden beneath a flippant exterior, facing a world where morality and truth are colored in shades of gray. It is a nearly impossible situation, and Casey Affleck is extraordinary in the role, capturing the anguish of a man whose virtues might destroy any hope of happiness. Equally good are Monaghan, combining beauty, stability, and humanity, and Harris, whose true character unfolds gradually, in a remarkable acting tour-de-force.Ben Affleck's compassion and deep devotion to the people of the grittier side of Boston makes him an ideal storyteller, and provides an authenticity to each scene that only a 'native' could provide.

Oh, its also directed by Ben Affleck. Before you snicker and think of Gigli, I've got to tell you this is a good movie. Casey Affleck is fun to watch, and Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are always top notch. Michelle Monoghan is the only actor that seem's underused. From the first time I saw her, I thought she looked great as the gritty partner Angie Generro to Affleck's private investigator Patrick Kenzie. Yet it seems like they used the version of the script that had all her lines deleted. In most scenes she just stood there.Anyway, this movie is based on a book written by Mystic River scribe Dennis Lehane. The book is great. I can't remember the exact details of the book, but I believe the movie has a different ending, one that is not as good as the book. In the movie, a young girl is kidnapped. Her aunt turns to Kenzie and Generro because she believes they can get people to talk to them that wouldn't talke to the police. That's true, and soon Kenzie has turned up some leads. Some leads work out and some don't and the ending leads to a perhaps a not so surprising twist.The great thing about this movie is the setting. The people and locations seem real. More importantly, the despair and desperation feel real. The mom of the kidnapped little girl obviousy cares nothing about her child, and horrible, selfish parenting of this mom is the theme of the movie. Kids can't choose their parents, yet the action of the parents often determine whether or not the child will lead a good life. This is a good movie. Watch the movie, read the book.

1128428,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B0010ZR160,Bookphile,"[4, 6]","This film is, above all, a morality tale.  Patrick, the main character, is sympathetic precisely because the things he does aren't always smart and perhaps aren't always the best thing to do but he is guided by a moral compass that is so strong it leads him to place his life in jeopardy and to sacrifice some of the things that are the most important to him.  It's hard not to admire someone who sticks to his principles no matter the consequences and though things don't always work out for him it must be reassuring for him to know that he has remained true to himself.The movies opens with Patrick, who is a private detective who normally tracks people down for collection agencies, and his girlfriend/partner Angie accepting a job searching for a child who has gone missing.  The mystery surrounding this event is intriguing and disturbing, involving as it does the seedy underbelly of Boston which is chock full of drug dealers and addicts and child molesters.  Patrick becomes consumed with the case and it leads him in directions he couldn't have imagined.  One of the best scenes takes place between Patrick and police detective Remy in which Patrick questions his own actions even as everyone else is more or less patting him on the back.  The scene shows just how self-aware a person Patrick is.The acting is top notch with Casey Affleck's affecting turn as Patrick a notable standout.  Ben's little brother is a prodigious talent and his portrayal of Patrick is extremely authentic.  Michelle Monaghan is very effective as Angie, who at the start seems to be the moral center of the film but whose beliefs can later leave the viewer very uncomfortable.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are both excellent and both play characters who divert from the roles to which I am accustomed seeing them play.Ed Harris is particularly chilling as a police detective who has a very dark side.  Dark as he is, it isn't hard to see why someone in his position might turn out as he does.  Remy Bressant is a character who forces the viewer to think more deeply about law enforcement officers and what it must be like to deal with the worst of society and to bear daily witness to the atrocities that humans can commit against one another.  If such thoughts do not cause one to be more thankful for and respectful of those who put themselves in the line of fire to protect others, I don't know what will.  Bressant, though, is a character who uses his experience to justify his actions and this is what makes him so disturbing as a characters.The movie's direction is also more than worthy of mention and if this is what can be expected of Ben Affleck, I look forward to more of his films and hope he will have a long career as a director.  Lighting and scenery are used to great effect here and Affleck gets a lot out of his actors.  The tone of the film is moody and the muted colors and shadowy lighting contribute a great deal to the atmosphere.Though this is anything but a happy movie, it's a perfect example of why films should be celebrated.  It's cerebral, the type of movie that will keep the viewer thinking for days.

Smith,"[0, 0]","I was bowled over by the authentic Boston look, accents and the real people cast in this crime drama, based on a Dennis Lahane novel, directed by Ben Affleck. The beginning works extremely well, and the film seems to be over halfway through, but then takes a few more plot turns before the ending, which doesn't work for me. Casey Affleck is very good as the central character, and his accent is perfect because he grew up in Dorchester.

While generally I'm not a big fan of these kind of films that seemed like their eye was on an Oscar rather than being a good film, I have to admit I quite liked his directorial debut. There's a couple of issues I have with the story itself but other than that, this is a film that's not as pretentious as others and not as flawed as many.When little girl Amanda McCready is abducted from her home, the case becomes a Boston public event as people crowd her mother Helene's house and doesn't draw in private investigators/couple Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennero until Amanda's aunt goes to them and requests additional help, namely getting answers from locals who don't like talking to cops. With the help of captain Jack Doyle and detectives Remy Bressant and Nick Poole, Patrick and Angie find there's more to the case than was initially known and also a major moral uncertainty as well.The film was adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane who also wrote Mystic River but where I felt Clint Eastwood failed, Afflect succeeds but doesn't quite perfect the story's fault. In all honesty, I always felt Mystic River was overwrought and almost emotionally manipulative as the film almost tried anything and everything to make sure you walk out of the film completely moved and crying your eyes out. While Gone Baby Gone still does have some faults, it's better handled and more personal and realistic. The film does have some red herrings and some character twists that I felt were straight out of a TV drama's handbook but I got so into it, I didn't even notice or care at first.These kind of films are more about acting than flashy stuff or comedic routines and Casey Affleck, known many for being a supporting character, finally shows some lead acting chops playing Patrick who constantly struggles if being morally right all the time is a good thing. While he does have what I call the William Hurt syndrome (read: a dull-sounding speaking voice) he's an interesting character to watch, as well as Amy Adams who plays one of the worst examples of a mother who simply loves her kids too much yet irresponsible to actually be a good mother. While she's a nice sight to see, Michelle Monaghan is both given not much to do and seems too cute and ""innocent"" for Boston's profanity-laced neighborhoods.While I wouldn't buy it (though wouldn't mind if it was a gift), I'd very much recommend Gone Baby Gone to anyone who wants a film that's just a good film rather than a film that thinks it is.",4,4.5; surprisingingly...I kinda love it,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,2783,"['When', 'first', 'realized', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'got', 'so', 'swept', 'up', 'film', 'literally', 'forgot', 'film', 'was', 'brought', 'guy', 'who', 'starred', 'Gigli', 'Daredevil', 'former', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'career', 'cinema', 'general', 'generally', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'kind', 'films', 'seemed', 'eye', 'was', 'Oscar', 'rather', 'being', 'good', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'quite', 'liked', 'directorial', 'debut', 'couple', 'issues', 'have', 'story', 'other', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'pretentious', 'others', 'not', 'as', 'flawed', 'many.When', 'little', 'girl', 'Amanda', 'McCready', 'abducted', 'home', 'case', 'Boston', 'public', 'event', 'people', 'crowd', 'mother', 'Helene', 'house', ""n't"", 'draw', 'private', 'investigators/couple', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Angie', 'Gennero', 'Amanda', 'aunt', 'additional', 'help', 'namely', 'getting', 'answers', 'locals', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'talking', 'cops', 'help', 'captain', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'detectives', 'Remy', 'Bressant', 'Nick', 'Poole', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'find', 'more', 'case', 'was', 'initially', 'known', 'also', 'major', 'moral', 'uncertainty', 'well.The', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'book', 'written', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Mystic', 'River', 'where', 'felt', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'failed', 'Afflect', ""n't"", 'quite', 'perfect', 'story', 'fault', 'honesty', 'always', 'felt', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'overwrought', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'manipulative', 'film', 'almost', 'tried', 'anything', 'everything', 'make', 'sure', 'walk', 'film', 'completely', 'moved', 'crying', 'eyes', 'out', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'still', 'have', 'faults', 'better', 'handled', 'more', 'personal', 'realistic', 'film', 'have', 'red', 'herrings', 'character', 'twists', 'felt', 'were', 'straight', 'TV', 'drama', 'handbook', 'got', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'care', 'first.These', 'kind', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'acting', 'flashy', 'stuff', 'comedic', 'routines', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'known', 'many', 'being', 'supporting', 'character', 'finally', 'lead', 'acting', 'chops', 'playing', 'Patrick', 'who', 'constantly', 'being', 'morally', 'right', 'time', 'good', 'thing', 'have', 'what', 'call', 'William', 'Hurt', 'syndrome', 'read', 'dull-sounding', 'speaking', 'voice', 'interesting', 'character', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'one', 'worst', 'examples', 'mother', 'who', 'simply', 'kids', 'too', 'much', 'yet', 'irresponsible', 'actually', 'be', 'good', 'mother', 'nice', 'sight', 'see', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'given', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'too', 'cute', 'innocent', 'Boston', 'profanity-laced', 'neighborhoods.While', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'though', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'was', 'gift', ""'d"", 'very', 'much', 'recommend', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'just', 'good', 'film', 'rather', 'film']",N/A

That's only part of the problem with this movie that contains within a lot of wrapping a clever, complicated mystery. Scattered throughout the movie also are what seem to be endless ""acting"" moments for every featured actor, a style of self-aware directing that spills over onto some of the actors' performances, and enough social sermonizing to keep even Sean Penn happy.Some of my impatience with this movie is because the mystery depends on so much well-planned sleight of hand that it raised my expectations for a solid, complicated mystery drama. The structure and presentation of the drama is well managed by director Ben Affleck. So is any number of individual scenes (when the acting doesn't start getting impassioned). And Amy Ryan as the cokehead mother simply walks away with the acting honors. She does it by making us believe she's what she's acting as, something a number of the other actors, in my opinion, don't quite pull off. Casey Affleck is just fine as the young private investigator who at first believes what he sees and then begins to figure things out. Ed Harris, on the other hand, and made up to look for some reason like Patrick McGoohan on Columbo, chews the scenery as if he were breaking in a new set of false teeth. Morgan Freeman plays yet another variation on his wise, humanistic, aging gentleman. Freeman needs to find a role where he can kick a reporter to death or humiliate a young pair of lovers. Somewhere along the way he has misplaced his real ability to be vicious. Just watch him as Fast Black inStreet Smart.As the story develops there are more and more twists. At first, and putting aside the feeling of the movie being too sincere for its own good, this led to a lot of tricky fun. By the time we reached the conclusion and all became clear, all also became stretched out with a series of mini-dramas that seemed to have difficulty finding a way to stop.Even Gone Baby Gone's basic argument -- isn't saving a child from almost certain degradation worth bending the rules, even if really bad scumbags pay a price -- is compromised by the naivety implicit in the question. Do we really want to live in a world where the police get to play God and make those decisions? Or maybe we should let the police play God only when it comes to little kids.

Affleck plays to his strengths by making it in his hometown of Boston and casting his little brother Casey in the lead role.Along withThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Casey Affleck finally moves into the spotlight with these two high profile film roles. He demonstrates what a good investigator Patrick is by the way he interacts with people, gaining their confidence and trust with an unassuming, easy-going nature. Affleck brings a perceptive intelligence to the role. Patrick is a cool customer who knows how to talk his way out of tense situations. Affleck also has a quiet intensity and an affable charm which is always interesting to watch.Ben Affleck keeps things close to home for his first directorial effort. He is also smart with his direction. Affleck doesn't try to get too fancy with camera angles or movements and remembers that the story is the most important thing. The fact that he respects the story makes him a good storyteller. Affleck draws us in with an intriguing premise and then lets the story do its thing.Affleck has done an excellent job and has gotten really good performances out of the entire cast. If he ever decides to give up acting, he'll have a promising career as a director. LikeMystic River (Three-Disc Collector's Edition), Gone Baby Gone wrestles with a complicated moral dilemma and leaves it up to us to decide if the right decision was made by the protagonist.""Going Home: Behind the Scenes with Ben Affleck"" takes a look at Affleck's approach to making the film. Dennis Lehane and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard talk briefly about adapting the book. The film's themes are mentioned and what they mean to those involved.Also included are six deleted with optional commentary by director and co-screenwriter Ben Affleck and screenwriter Aaron Stockard. There is a longer version of the opening credits sequence that shows Patrick and Angie at work and establishes their skill as investigators. There is a little more about Angie's past and we also see the intimacy of their relationship. Affleck talks about why this footage was cut.""Capturing Authenticity: Casting Gone Baby Gone."" Affleck shot in real communities and cast the people who lived there as extras. He talks about casting his brother in the film and what he brought to the role. Other key cast members talk about what drew them to the film.Finally, there is an audio commentary by Affleck and Stockard. Affleck points out that the opening credits sequence, with its shots of actual people who lived in the neighbourhood, sets the tone for the rest of the film. He wanted a realistic look with no stylish filters, camerawork, etc. There are several lulls in the commentary but when Affleck does speak (and he tends to dominate), he imparts plenty of information and filming anecdotes.",5,Ben Affleck's Resurrection,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,3194,"['very', 'public', 'dissolution', 'relationship', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'critical', 'commercial', 'flop', 'filmGigli', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'wisely', 'adopted', 'low', 'profile', 'taking', 'modest', 'character', 'roles', 'films', 'likeHollywoodland', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andSmokin', 'Aces', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'decided', 'go', 'camera', 'directing', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Affleck', 'strengths', 'making', 'hometown', 'Boston', 'casting', 'little', 'brother', 'Casey', 'lead', 'role.Along', 'withThe', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'finally', 'spotlight', 'two', 'high', 'profile', 'film', 'roles', 'what', 'good', 'investigator', 'Patrick', 'way', 'people', 'gaining', 'confidence', 'trust', 'unassuming', 'easy-going', 'nature', 'Affleck', 'perceptive', 'intelligence', 'role', 'Patrick', 'cool', 'customer', 'who', 'how', 'talk', 'way', 'tense', 'situations', 'Affleck', 'also', 'quiet', 'intensity', 'affable', 'charm', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch.Ben', 'Affleck', 'things', 'close', 'home', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'also', 'smart', 'direction', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'try', 'get', 'too', 'fancy', 'camera', 'angles', 'movements', 'remembers', 'story', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'fact', 'story', 'good', 'storyteller', 'Affleck', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'then', 'story', 'do', 'thing.Affleck', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'gotten', 'really', 'good', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'ever', 'give', 'up', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'have', 'promising', 'career', 'director', 'LikeMystic', 'River', 'Three-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'complicated', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'up', 'decide', 'right', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'protagonist', 'Going', 'Home', 'Scenes', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'look', 'Affleck', 'approach', 'making', 'film', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'co-screenwriter', 'Aaron', 'Stockard', 'talk', 'briefly', 'adapting', 'book', 'film', 'themes', 'are', 'mentioned', 'what', 'mean', 'involved.Also', 'included', 'are', 'six', 'deleted', 'optional', 'commentary', 'director', 'co-screenwriter', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'screenwriter', 'Aaron', 'Stockard', 'longer', 'version', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'work', 'establishes', 'skill', 'investigators', 'little', 'more', 'Angie', 'past', 'also', 'see', 'intimacy', 'relationship', 'Affleck', 'talks', 'why', 'footage', 'was', 'cut', 'Capturing', 'Authenticity', 'Casting', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'Affleck', 'shot', 'real', 'communities', 'cast', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'extras', 'casting', 'brother', 'film', 'what', 'brought', 'role', 'Other', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'talk', 'what', 'drew', 'film.Finally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Affleck', 'Stockard', 'Affleck', 'out', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'shots', 'actual', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'neighbourhood', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'wanted', 'realistic', 'look', 'stylish', 'filters', 'camerawork', 'etc', 'are', 'several', 'lulls', 'commentary', 'when', 'Affleck', 'speak', 'dominate', 'plenty', 'information', 'filming', 'anecdotes']",N/A
1128449,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B0010ZR160,DanD,"[7, 8]","That quote, from novelist Dennis Lehane and taken from one of the ""making-of"" featurettes available on the DVD, pretty much sums up the whole point of ""Gone Baby Gone.""  I'll sum up the plot briefly: a child is kidnapped from the home of her crack-dealing single mother, and two private investigators are hired to find her.  What begins as a complicated case turns tragic, heartbreaking, and a moral issue for the ages.First of all: Ben Affleck can direct.  Sure, sure, he obviously takes his cues from the greats before him...but who doesn't?  Affleck takes a great script (which he co-wrote, based upon a great novel) and makes a great movie.  Boston becomes a central character; Affleck captures this by casting many true-life Boston citizens (as one ""actor"" states: ""There's no actors in there"") in many of the roles, giving the movie the lived-in feel that it requires.  Let's face it: despite the caliber of acting, despite the amazing script, if the movie didn't have Boston, the movie wouldn't have anything.Let's go back to the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Casey Affleck, Ben's little bro, is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors (see him also in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford;"" that movie, combined with this, will quickly erase any doubts about this man's talent).  As his girlfriend/partner, Michelle Monaghan oozes charm and charisma as always.  Amy Ryan, as the girl's mother, is a wonder to behold; she highly deserves her Best Supporting Actress nod (and if she wins, you won't hear any complaints from me).  It's unfortunate that Ed Harris, who delivers one of his best performances, isn't nominated; as a hard-hitting detective who isn't afraid to bend the rules, he steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Morgan Freeman; in the first half of the movie, his talent isn't readily evident (it's a bit hard to get past his traditional wise-man persona).  When he shows up later in the film, though, the viewer is quickly reminded why Freeman is one of the best actors to ever grace the screen.Ultimately, as intimated in the title line of this review, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a thinking-man's crime drama.  It isn't meant to leave you feeling nice and comfortable; it's meant to leave you shaken, edgy, as if something wasn't right.  What is ""the right thing?""  How do we know it when we see it?  How do we know it when we do it?  These are the questions you'll leave this movie with.  If you're not comfortable questioning your own humanity, then I reccommend going to see some other flick; I hear Paris Hilton has a new one coming out.  But if you don't mind feeling uncomfortable, if you don't mind watching a crime drama that is actually thought-provoking, then by all means watch this one.  You'll get your money's worth and a whole lot more.",5,"""It's meant to hurt.

Instead, we are treated to a two hour quotidian and caustic performance by Bennifer's widdle brother and his barely perceptible girlfriend.  Bennifer's brother opens with a narration which sets the pungent tone for the rest of this film.  Why must everything associated with Bennifer and his frequent companion, Matt Damon, be associated with Boston?  Ok Ben, we get it....you're from New England now can you go away?  If I had to look at one more obese drunken soak wearing a Red Sox cap, I was going to emit my supper.The opening narration by Junior Bennifer is so banal and ultimately pointless.  I'm convinced it's sole purpose was to let the viewer know how grating yet forgettable this picture would be.  I won't go into every detail that I found implausible, but just to list a few:  Junior Bennifer somehow knows every con in the city, yet is apparently hated by most of them.  Junior Bennifer is approximately 5'6 145 lbs, yet he mouths off to at least five hardened thugs and suffers nary the slightest scratch.The seasoned detectives allow Junior Bennifer behind the curtain and supply him with investigative information despite the fact that they're in on the misgivings.  My brain can only handle thinking about this slop for so long so I'll wrap up with one final though.

The film teems with a highly individualistic style informed by Affleck's upbringing in working class Boston.  You can taste it in the art direction and the authentic dialogue espoused by the film's denizens.  The film also contains one jawdropping performance by Amy Ryan as the crack-addicted mother of a missing child.  That you can engender any sympathy for this apathetic character is a credit to Ryan as an actress.  Oscar got it wrong on this one.  I would be a little more enthused by the film if not for a slightly lackluster script, cowritten, ironically by Affleck.  It's not that the plot is convoluted but a little too labyrinthian for my liking.  Another thing that is blatantly obvious is the casting of Morgan Freeman in a role originally intended for a white actor.  You can never quibble about employing an actor of the high calibre of Freeman but wouldn't it have made more sense to give his character a black wife?

1128461,ADKZOXAOV8EXD,B0010ZR160,Doctor.Generosity,"[1, 1]","This starts as a crime drama about a missing child in inner-city Boston, but quickly morphs into a more complex and rather unrealistic story. I will just mention elements already discussed by others: The plot is verrry hard to swallow, almost laughably so, with the entire cast of characters (including all the cops) turning out to be part of a highly improbable conspiracy. The high profile actors Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are professional but lack something in their performances here. Casey Affleck is unconvincing as a ""teenage"" private eye and his girlfriend comes across as a bland cipher. Ben Affleck's first try as a director gets uneven results - Ben, don't give up your day job. The supposed overarching moral dilemma does not appear in the first 3/4 of the movie; it is just dropped in at the end as from a helicopter. And in contrast an earlier 'moral' item - Casey's extrajudicial execution of a suspected child molester by summarily shooting him in the head without benefit of arrest, judge or jury - this does not seem to cause a ripple. To put it mildly, things just wouldn't happen that way. Bottom line: a vanity project for the Affleck brothers.But let me move on two elements that make this worth watching, especially if you have lived in Boston.First, the depiction of white working-class inner-city Dorchester (Boston) is really very good, including the photography of the neighborhood, the Quincy quarries, and the colorful lowlife townies, especially in the scarey first bar scene. I lived there and I've seen those guys! And the cinematography is excellent; every shot well framed.Second, there is one standout performance plus a memorable cameo. Amy Ryan plays the hard-edged, slutty, coke-addicted mother of the missing child - the sort of mother who leaves her 4 year old alone while she gets high in a bar. She is just phenomenal in this difficult-to-capture, unsympathetic role, right down to her too-tight jeans and streetwise humor. She gets it just right; all the nuances are flawless. Her early scene of foul-mouthed verbal abuse of her extended family, her sarcastic admissions of criminality, all perfect, the equal of any high-art Tennessee Williams play. She received not only an Academy Award nomination but several other awards for Best Supporting Actress, all fully deserved. She is assisted in this through a cameo role by one Jill Quigg, a non-professional from the neighborhood who was drafted off the street for her ability to crack out expletives in the local dialect. She has not just the accent but the authentic persona of a tough Boston Irish girl from the projects. I ran back the movie a second time just to watch Quigg, her tone of voice and mannerisms; perfect.By itself the movie would get two stars because it is poorly structured. But if you have lived in Boston it will be so much more interesting to watch, so make it three. Amy Ryan shows what it means to be a high end actress and easily adds a fourth. Nothing will make it five however.",4,"Watch it for Dorchester, and the amazing Amy Ryan",1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,3002,"['crime', 'drama', 'missing', 'child', 'inner-city', 'Boston', 'quickly', 'morphs', 'more', 'complex', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'will', 'just', 'mention', 'elements', 'already', 'discussed', 'others', 'plot', 'verrry', 'hard', 'swallow', 'almost', 'laughably', 'so', 'entire', 'cast', 'characters', 'including', 'cops', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'part', 'highly', 'improbable', 'conspiracy', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'are', 'professional', 'lack', 'something', 'performances', 'here', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'unconvincing', 'teenage', 'private', 'eye', 'girlfriend', 'across', 'bland', 'cipher', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'first', 'try', 'director', 'uneven', 'results', 'Ben', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'day', 'job', 'supposed', 'overarching', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'not', 'appear', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'just', 'dropped', 'end', 'helicopter', 'contrast', 'earlier', ""'moral"", 'item', 'Casey', 'extrajudicial', 'execution', 'suspected', 'child', 'molester', 'summarily', 'shooting', 'head', 'benefit', 'arrest', 'judge', 'jury', 'not', 'seem', 'cause', 'ripple', 'put', 'mildly', 'things', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'Bottom', 'line', 'vanity', 'project', 'Affleck', 'brothers.But', 'let', 'move', 'two', 'elements', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'have', 'lived', 'Boston.First', 'depiction', 'white', 'working-class', 'inner-city', 'Dorchester', 'Boston', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'including', 'photography', 'neighborhood', 'Quincy', 'quarries', 'colorful', 'lowlife', 'townies', 'especially', 'scarey', 'first', 'bar', 'scene', 'lived', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'guys', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'shot', 'well', 'framed.Second', 'one', 'standout', 'performance', 'memorable', 'cameo', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'hard-edged', 'slutty', 'coke-addicted', 'mother', 'missing', 'child', 'sort', 'mother', 'who', '4', 'year', 'old', 'alone', 'high', 'bar', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'difficult-to-capture', 'unsympathetic', 'role', 'right', 'down', 'too-tight', 'jeans', 'streetwise', 'humor', 'just', 'right', 'nuances', 'are', 'flawless', 'early', 'scene', 'foul-mouthed', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'extended', 'family', 'sarcastic', 'admissions', 'criminality', 'perfect', 'equal', 'high-art', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'play', 'received', 'not', 'only', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'several', 'other', 'awards', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'fully', 'deserved', 'assisted', 'cameo', 'role', 'one', 'Jill', 'Quigg', 'non-professional', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'was', 'drafted', 'off', 'street', 'ability', 'crack', 'out', 'expletives', 'local', 'dialect', 'not', 'just', 'accent', 'authentic', 'persona', 'tough', 'Boston', 'Irish', 'girl', 'projects', 'ran', 'back', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'watch', 'Quigg', 'tone', 'voice', 'mannerisms', 'perfect.By', 'movie', 'would', 'get', 'two', 'stars', 'poorly', 'structured', 'have', 'lived', 'Boston', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'watch', 'so', 'make', 'three', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'what', 'be', 'high', 'end', 'actress', 'easily', 'fourth', 'Nothing', 'will', 'make', 'five', 'however']",N/A

Two reasons: the last 1/3 of the film implodes under way too many implausibilities (and I can't really discuss them without giving away the plot), and the lead character's moral pigheadedness (or principledness, depending on your point of view) was equally implausible and extremely hard to accept.It's a shame, because this film could've been at a whole other level in the hands of a more subtle and experienced filmmaker.  Ben Affleck is plenty competent in the technical department: he's gotten together a strong cast and script, has diligently gotten all the local South Boston settings and flavors just right, knows how to handle the camera and keep the film moving along at an engaging pace, etc.But he can't quite close the deal.

Schlueter ""martin blank""","[34, 38]","Ben Affleck's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's book, Gone Baby Gone, is one of the best movies I have seen in years.The basic story centers around two local detectives who reside in Dorchester.  They are asked to assist the police in their investigation of a missing girl, who was abducted while her alcoholic/drug addict mother was at her friend's place.  Reluctantly, they agree to take on the case.Having read the book, the only complaint I would have is how they portayed Angela Gennaro, played by Michelle Monaghan.  In the book, her character has survived a physically abusive marriage and numerous brushes with death.  In this film, she is almost like a hood ornament to Casey Affleck's Patrick Kenzie.  But the chemistry between the two actors can almost make you forget about that.The story moves at breakneck pace and keeps you in suspense until the very end.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are excellent as two police officers who are deeply involved in the case....and even deeper in secrets.  But the true standout is Golden Globe nominee, Amy Ryan, who plays the missing girl's mother.  You don't like her from the start, even though you feel tempted to feel some sympathy because of her situation.  Ryan plays this crass, ambivalent single parent with such raw power, you truly despise this woman.The movie reflects on many famiilar themes; tight knit people who will ""die with their secrets"", things not appearing to be what they seem, the moral dilemma of doing what is right and what is ""right"", etc.  And by the end, you find yourself just as torn as Kenzie about which ""right"" will prevail.You should probably read Deniis Lehane's prequels to this film such as ""A Drink Before the War"", ""Darkness, Take My Hand"",  and ""Sacred"" before watching this film.

The result is a film so well tuned and realistic with a perfect sense of pacing and character development that it becomes a remarkable calling card for Ben Affleck's career as a director. That it is going unnoticed (with the exception of Amy Ryan's nomination for Best Supporting Actress) by the Oscars is a grave oversight !The time is contemporary Dorchester, Massachusetts and Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his girlfriend/partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), become aware of a missing child Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) in their own neighborhood.  The child's aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and uncle Lionel (Titus Welliver), unable to cope with Amanda's drugged out mother Helene (Amy Ryan), knock on Patrick and Angie's door, pleading with them to help find Amanda: Patrick and Angie are private detectives who just happen to be an integral part of the neighborhood.  Reluctant at first to become involved in the now 3-day police hunt for the child, a hunt headed by the respected Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) who his lost his own daughter in similar circumstances and detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) and who as a triad feel they are competent to handle the case without the 'immature experience' of the young couple. But Patrick and Angie do become involved, uncover leads within the neighborhood that lead to the clues behind the missing child incident and in doing so, unravel a lot of corruption within the police force, and also discover differences between themselves that threaten their otherwise close relationship.  To say more would remove the incredible tension this story maintains all the way to the fadeout credits.The cast is uniformly excellent, from the smallest roles to the most major ones. It is difficult to single out any performer for praise as this is truly an ensemble piece.  The flavor of the film is honest, unflinching, and refuses to ignore the grotesque incidents that must be shown for the movie to maintain its impact. Writer Dennis Lahane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island') is a master of detailing the spectrum of responses that ugly matters induce: even the most noble of intentions have their shadowy side.  Affleck finds all of this in this excellent film, a film so strong that it easily bears repeated viewings.  Highly recommended...but not for the squeamish.

Not only is the movie itself terrific, but the DVD has a lot of extra features that make it something you and your friends or family members SHOULD like exploring separately.As for the movie itself, I won't do a full review since there are about a million of them right here for you to read. The only personal comments I'll make about the movie here are that (a) it's very well acted overall, (b) I don't really think Casey Affleck has the screen presence to carry off the Patrick character well, and (c) his character's lines in the script should have been A LOT funnier, given the tone of the book.  Beyond that, chances are good that, by now, you know enough to decide whether the movie suits you or not.That said, I recommend buying the DVD in large part because of the deleted scenes.  In fact, after watching them all a few times, I would even say that it would have been a better movie if they had used one of the alternate beginnings that they discarded, along with a couple small deleted scenes.  Don't get me wrong, I like a movie that keeps a lot hidden until the end as much as anyone, but by adding in just a little more of the footage they discarded, the movie would have had a much better pace and rhythm without giving away anything at all.  As it is, I think the choppy feel of the film shows Director Affleck's inexperience.In any case, you'll enjoy the story, you'll enjoy the tension, and if you like seeing behind the camera on a good film, you'll enjoy the DVD's extras.

He deftly pulls off a righteousness that would seem impossible in a tough Boston private eye. Michelle Monaghan, as his partner in bed and in business, is a badly drawn character, who apparently represents only femininity, and does little else but worry the entire film.

Twists and turns are piled as high as a pastrami on rye, and the conclusion is simply melodramatic trite, like a lesser Agatha Christie, and seems and excuse for Affleck to deliver his fine little speech on truth and dignity.If you loved Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"", you'll also love Ben Affleck's ""Gone Baby Gone"".

I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way, but after thinking about it I became more and more convinced that it's the only way this film could end. I think that's why I like Gone Baby Gone so much, it makes you think about it's message and allows you to draw your own conclusions.Gone Baby Gone is an adaption of Dennis Lehanne's novel about a missing girl in Boston, MA and the effects this has on everyone involved with the case, most notably Patrick Mckenzie a young private detective who's been hired by the girl's aunt. Patrick meets the mother who comes off as a dead beat and almost seems oblivious to the tragedy around her. Patrick and his girlfriend/partner Angie team up with two police detectives and through most of the film we follow their investigation through the streets of Boston finding out not only about the little girl and her mother, but the influence this city has had on all of the characters. While a lot of the movie plays out in a usual crime/detective fashion (with, I'll admit some obscure revelations and red-herrings) it's when all of these points come together at the end and Patrick is forced to make a very hard but important decision that gives the film it's impact. You don't have to agree with his decision but very rarely has a movie actually made me think about an ending and what I want to take away from it.The cast of Gone Baby Gone is pitch-perfect. Amy Ryan got a lot of well deserved recognition for her role as the missing girl's mother, but it's Casey Affleck as Patrick who holds the most attention and creates an unforgettable character.Gone Baby Gone was Ben Affleck's first film as director and co-writer and he uses terrific Boston settings for his locations that give Gone Baby Gone an authentic air. His action scenes, while sparse are very exciting and very engagingly filmed.Gone Baby Gone is easily one of my favorite movies and one of the rare films that actually makes you THINK about what it's trying to say.

(It's actually terrific, and he has a fine painterly sense of composition.) The film is concerned with the abduction of a four year-old girl from her drugged-out mother (Amy Ryan) in Dorchester, the poverty-stricken working class suburb right adjacent to the South End of Boston; Lehane's two young detectives/lovers, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are hired by the girl's aunt (Amy Madigan) to find her. The story involves not only a careful look at what is best for our children but what it means to be a grown-up and make responsible ethical decisions; Lehane shows great intelligence as a moral thinker which he couples very well to his exciting skills as a storyteller. The screenplay, also by Ben Affleck (with Aaron Stockard) is not quite at the level of everything else in the film and betrays some novices' errors: the characters call each other by their first names too often in the opening scenes, for example, and a key sequence at an abandoned quarry during the night is not executed very clearly in narrative terms.

None of that ""discussion about..."" nonsense where no opinion about the theme is proposed. Thoughtful and challenging indeed. And the screen reeked of the grubby, the cheap, the crass, the violent and the dangerous. I have seen few movies where I said as often as I did here, ""Boy, I'm glad I don't live there."" These were nasty people who have made bad choices and suffer the consequences of their behavior. A place where no one was trustworthy, and strangers were not welcome. This all worked wonderfully. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman were pros who knew what to do, and Amy Ryan, so wonderful in ""The Wire"", was utterly convincing and absolutely unrelenting as a shallow, stupid, foul, and arrogant mother.So, what didn't work? Well, unfortunately, Casey Affleck, a nice enough guy, just could not pull off the brooding, conflicted protagonist. His boyish appearance, used unsuccessfully as a plot device, made the struggles he endured seem off-kilter. This role needed someone with more snarl, more snap, more depth. I repeatedly thought of Bogart in ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"", a tough but good man trying to do what's right. No one could stare without speaking as Bogart could. Casey was not close. And hehad been asked to be so.One of the commonly voiced complaints about contemporary actors is how there are no grown-ups. They all seem like boys, even when playing men. And that was terribly true here. This young man sounded like a kid.

Affleck's direction is more than adequate. I'm sure he's aping Clint Eastwood's film version of Mystic River much of the time, and there's one scene that's way too reminiscent of Se7en, but he shows a lot of skill. He's great at capturing his hometown of Boston and the people who live there.The story revolves around the investigation of a missing girl. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are two of the major investigators for the police. The aunt of the missing girl hires Casey Affleck and his girlfriend, played by Michelle Monaghan, to do private investigation on the side, because they can maybe find some secrets that the girl's mother (Amy Ryan) might be hiding. It's a gripping mystery story, and it arrives at one quite satisfying twist. But then there's another twist. The second big twist is completely brainless, and then the previously excellent film starts to fall. This isn't unlike Mystic River, where, when we finally found out why Tim Robbins has been acting so strange all the time, I just had to slap my forehead. Gone Baby Gone is able to pull itself up a bit from its head-slapping plot revelation in its final moments, but I was still left feeling cheated. I also have to complain that Monaghan, as lovely as she is, adds very little. Would Affleck's character really put his girlfriend in such dangerous situations all the time? I'm sort of glad we're spared the whole clich&eacute; chatter where one of the two lovers fears for their significant other's safety, but bringing the beautiful woman into a powerful drug dealer's den sounds like a hostage situation waiting to happen.Casey Affleck did deliver his second fine performance that year, though it isn't as good as his Robert Ford, which I think might some day be considered iconic. Credit to Affleck's direction that the film can still be considered good after some should-be fatal flaws so I say watch it and see it for yourself.",4,"Has its flaws, and some big ones, too, but still achieves something near greatness",1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,2027,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'directorial', 'debut', 'based', 'novel', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Mystic', 'River', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Affleck', 'direction', 'more', 'adequate', ""'m"", 'sure', 'aping', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'film', 'version', 'Mystic', 'River', 'much', 'time', 'one', 'scene', 'way', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'Se7en', 'lot', 'skill', 'great', 'capturing', 'hometown', 'Boston', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'there.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'investigation', 'missing', 'girl', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'investigators', 'police', 'aunt', 'missing', 'girl', 'hires', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'do', 'private', 'investigation', 'side', 'can', 'maybe', 'find', 'secrets', 'girl', 'mother', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'might', 'be', 'hiding', 'gripping', 'mystery', 'story', 'one', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'twist', 'then', 'twist', 'second', 'big', 'twist', 'completely', 'brainless', 'then', 'previously', 'excellent', 'film', 'fall', ""n't"", 'Mystic', 'River', 'where', 'when', 'finally', 'found', 'out', 'why', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'been', 'acting', 'so', 'strange', 'time', 'just', 'had', 'slap', 'forehead', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'able', 'pull', 'up', 'bit', 'head-slapping', 'plot', 'revelation', 'final', 'moments', 'was', 'still', 'left', 'feeling', 'cheated', 'also', 'have', 'complain', 'Monaghan', 'as', 'lovely', 'very', 'little', 'Would', 'Affleck', 'character', 'really', 'put', 'girlfriend', 'such', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'time', ""'m"", 'sort', 'glad', ""'re"", 'spared', 'whole', 'clich', 'eacute', 'chatter', 'where', 'one', 'two', 'lovers', 'fears', 'significant', 'other', 'safety', 'bringing', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'powerful', 'drug', 'dealer', 'den', 'sounds', 'hostage', 'situation', 'waiting', 'happen.Casey', 'Affleck', 'did', 'deliver', 'second', 'fine', 'performance', 'year', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'think', 'might', 'day', 'be', 'considered', 'iconic', 'Credit', 'Affleck', 'direction', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'considered', 'good', 'should-be', 'fatal', 'flaws', 'say', 'watch', 'see']",N/A
1128499,A1G1PX4U6RSZEA,B0010ZR160,Jeremy P,"[16, 44]","The only fact I knew prior to renting this movie was Ben Affleck directed it, and his brother Casey Affleck was the main character.  With that said I'm obviously ambivalent toward Ben Affleck for all the reasons everyone under the sun knows so I will spare the reader my soliloquy.  Casey Affleck on the other hand I've seen in a few indie flicks that didn't woo me to say the least.  Nonetheless I sat back without any inkling or hint of what the premise of this movie consisted of and let the movie speak for itself.First and foremost I had no empathy, sympathy, or encouragement to really enjoy/support any character whatsoever, especially Angie Monaghan's character (Gennaro).  Why may you ask?  A good movie just like a really good novel gives the movie-goer or reader an opportunity to know/understand a character, and once that is established it ultimately effects the movie-goers emotions, and I saw that didn't happen with this movie only up until the last 10 minutes I was finally sold on Kenzie's character as well as Helene's character.  Aside from the characters personalities, the acting particularly from Casey Affleck was absolute rubbish.  I give him no props for tackling a role that in essence didn't stand-out or evoke a uniqueness unfounded in his acting style.  Lets face it the Affleck's are from Boston, therefore Casey more or less was acting as if he wasn't acting.  Remember Courtney Love from ""The People Vs Larry Flynt"" as she was portrayed as a crackwhore? Hmm....didn't take a great deal of acting to pull that role off now did it Courtney?  I may be going overboard on his acting, but it just didn't help the movie.  I was anticipating more emotion, more emphasis, more bravado, yet all we got was a stuttering badass Bostonian.  How typical.The movie tried too hard to be unpredictable, and with that it left several open questions marks hurriedly pieced together in the little remaining time the film had left.  As an audience member I was forced to put on my CSI thinking caps to piece it together in order to see eye to eye with the characters as more unpredictability and CSI detective work was being unfolded.  I feel the events that took place throughout the entire movie to hide/protect Amanda was simply over the top and somewhat irrelevant.  Wouldn't Amanda question the whereabouts of her mother after being wist away to a country-side home living under the roof with a black man (Capt. Jack Doyle) and a white woman (Francine Doyle)?  I found it very selfish and hypocritical for Capt. Doyle to take away a child from it's mother, but is that what we as an audience need to mull over and question as a moral dilemma?  In my opinion the movie lacked or missed out on something to create it as a moral dilemma.  I feel Kenzie shooting the pedophile deemed more merit as a moral dilemma versus the decision-making over where Amanda would benefit greatly in maturing and living life to the fullest.  I felt the ending was self-evident and that is why we should dismiss the question of morality and ethics, and that is why I have a hard time  imagining people labeling this movie as controversial, surprising, and open to discussion.  Fast Forward to the very end where Kenzie is in Helene's house standing in the hallway chatting while Helene is getting ready for a date.  Helene takes off leaving Amanda all alone sitting on the couch watching television under the supervision of Kenzie.  Was the director (yes, Ben Affleck) trying to subliminally evoke his personal decision-making that would impact Amanda?  If that were the case than I give him credit for making a good point, and unfortunately that was the only point that fully impacted me as a viewer.",1,Go Baby Leave....,1202774400,"02 12, 2008",2008,3698,"['only', 'fact', 'knew', 'prior', 'renting', 'movie', 'was', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'directed', 'brother', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'said', ""'m"", 'obviously', 'ambivalent', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'reasons', 'everyone', 'sun', 'so', 'will', 'spare', 'reader', 'soliloquy', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'other', 'hand', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'indie', 'flicks', 'did', ""n't"", 'woo', 'say', 'least', 'sat', 'back', 'inkling', 'hint', 'what', 'premise', 'movie', 'consisted', 'let', 'movie', 'speak', 'itself.First', 'foremost', 'had', 'empathy', 'sympathy', 'encouragement', 'really', 'enjoy/support', 'character', 'whatsoever', 'especially', 'Angie', 'Monaghan', 'character', 'Gennaro', 'Why', 'may', 'ask', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'good', 'novel', 'movie-goer', 'reader', 'opportunity', 'know/understand', 'character', 'once', 'established', 'ultimately', 'effects', 'movie-goers', 'emotions', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'movie', 'only', 'up', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'finally', 'sold', 'Kenzie', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'Helene', 'character', 'Aside', 'characters', 'personalities', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'absolute', 'rubbish', 'give', 'props', 'tackling', 'role', 'essence', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand-out', 'evoke', 'uniqueness', 'unfounded', 'acting', 'style', 'face', 'Affleck', 'are', 'Boston', 'therefore', 'Casey', 'more', 'less', 'was', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'Remember', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'People', 'Vs', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'was', 'portrayed', 'crackwhore', 'Hmm', '.did', ""n't"", 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'acting', 'pull', 'role', 'off', 'now', 'did', 'Courtney', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'overboard', 'acting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'was', 'anticipating', 'more', 'emotion', 'more', 'emphasis', 'more', 'bravado', 'yet', 'got', 'was', 'stuttering', 'badass', 'Bostonian', 'How', 'typical.The', 'movie', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'unpredictable', 'left', 'several', 'open', 'questions', 'marks', 'hurriedly', 'pieced', 'together', 'little', 'remaining', 'time', 'film', 'had', 'left', 'audience', 'member', 'was', 'forced', 'put', 'CSI', 'thinking', 'caps', 'piece', 'together', 'order', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'characters', 'more', 'unpredictability', 'CSI', 'detective', 'work', 'was', 'being', 'unfolded', 'feel', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'entire', 'movie', 'hide/protect', 'Amanda', 'was', 'simply', 'top', 'somewhat', 'irrelevant', 'Would', ""n't"", 'Amanda', 'question', 'whereabouts', 'mother', 'being', 'wist', 'away', 'country-side', 'home', 'living', 'roof', 'black', 'man', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'white', 'woman', 'Francine', 'Doyle', 'found', 'very', 'selfish', 'hypocritical', 'Capt', 'Doyle', 'take', 'away', 'child', 'mother', 'what', 'audience', 'need', 'mull', 'question', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'opinion', 'movie', 'lacked', 'missed', 'out', 'something', 'create', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'feel', 'Kenzie', 'shooting', 'pedophile', 'deemed', 'more', 'merit', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'decision-making', 'where', 'Amanda', 'would', 'benefit', 'greatly', 'maturing', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'felt', 'ending', 'was', 'self-evident', 'why', 'should', 'dismiss', 'question', 'morality', 'ethics', 'why', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'people', 'labeling', 'movie', 'controversial', 'surprising', 'open', 'discussion', 'Fast', 'Forward', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'Kenzie', 'Helene', 'house', 'standing', 'hallway', 'chatting', 'Helene', 'getting', 'ready', 'date', 'Helene', 'leaving', 'Amanda', 'alone', 'sitting', 'couch', 'watching', 'television', 'supervision', 'Kenzie', 'Was', 'director', 'yes', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'trying', 'subliminally', 'evoke', 'personal', 'decision-making', 'would', 'impact', 'Amanda', 'were', 'case', 'give', 'credit', 'making', 'good', 'point', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'only', 'point', 'fully', 'impacted', 'viewer']",N/A

1128507,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0010ZR160,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 6]","Ben Affleck capably directs GONE BABY GONE, a morality tale with no easy answers, with younger brother Casey in the lead role.Casey appears as Bostonian Patrick Kenzie that teams with his significant other, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), to form a private investigative duo. After young Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) is abducted from her bedroom, the pair is hired by family members to augment the local police effort headed by Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and his two detectives, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). As Kenzie and Gennaro navigate the murky undercurrents of the case, they discover that all is not what it seems.Affleck's character is engaging but inscrutable; Monaghan's is vulnerable and attractive but superfluous. Freeman's Doyle is, well, Freeman. (Does he ever turn in less than a stellar performance?) Harris's Bressant, as a veteran member of the child protection squad, exhibits the hard-eyed fanaticism of a True Believer similar to that of the actor's FBI agent role in 1993'sThe Firm. The best performance is undoubtedly that of Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, Amanda's foul-mouthed, drug-running mother in need of an attitude adjustment and whom the audience yearns to slap silly.GONE BABY GONE is elevated to above standard fare by the moral choice presented to Kenzie when he ultimately discovers Amanda's abductor. There's no option between Black and White here, only Black and two diametrically opposed shades of Gray. The choice that can't be avoided and must be made imperils Angie's and Patrick's relationship and may cause spirited discussion among viewers after they exit the film. And, as Kenzie realizes by the ending credits, one's conscience will forever be plagued by doubts.My only criticism of this otherwise engrossing film is the lack of background about the Kenzie character. While appearing boyish and usually almost shy, he periodically exhibits the hard-boiled edge of one comfortable with extreme violence and the willingness to dish it out. How and when did he acquire that? Perhaps a prequel is in order.",4,Honorable people founder on competing moral imperatives,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,2092,"['Ben', 'Affleck', 'capably', 'GONE', 'BABY', 'GONE', 'morality', 'tale', 'easy', 'answers', 'younger', 'brother', 'Casey', 'lead', 'role.Casey', 'Bostonian', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'teams', 'significant', 'other', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'form', 'private', 'investigative', 'duo', 'young', 'Amanda', 'McCready', 'Madeline', ""O'Brien"", 'abducted', 'bedroom', 'pair', 'hired', 'family', 'members', 'augment', 'local', 'police', 'effort', 'headed', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'two', 'detectives', 'Remy', 'Bressant', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Nick', 'Poole', 'John', 'Ashton', 'Kenzie', 'Gennaro', 'navigate', 'murky', 'undercurrents', 'case', 'discover', 'not', 'what', 'seems.Affleck', 'character', 'engaging', 'inscrutable', 'Monaghan', 'vulnerable', 'attractive', 'superfluous', 'Freeman', 'Doyle', 'well', 'Freeman', 'ever', 'turn', 'less', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Harris', 'Bressant', 'veteran', 'member', 'child', 'protection', 'squad', 'hard-eyed', 'fanaticism', 'True', 'Believer', 'similar', 'actor', 'FBI', 'agent', 'role', ""1993'sThe"", 'Firm', 'best', 'performance', 'undoubtedly', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Helene', 'McCready', 'Amanda', 'foul-mouthed', 'drug-running', 'mother', 'need', 'attitude', 'adjustment', 'whom', 'audience', 'slap', 'silly.GONE', 'BABY', 'GONE', 'elevated', 'above', 'standard', 'fare', 'moral', 'choice', 'presented', 'Kenzie', 'when', 'ultimately', 'Amanda', 'abductor', 'option', 'Black', 'White', 'here', 'only', 'Black', 'two', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'shades', 'Gray', 'choice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'avoided', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'imperils', 'Angie', 'Patrick', 'relationship', 'may', 'cause', 'spirited', 'discussion', 'viewers', 'exit', 'film', 'Kenzie', 'ending', 'credits', 'one', 'conscience', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'plagued', 'doubts.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'otherwise', 'engrossing', 'film', 'lack', 'background', 'Kenzie', 'character', 'appearing', 'boyish', 'usually', 'almost', 'shy', 'periodically', 'hard-boiled', 'edge', 'one', 'comfortable', 'extreme', 'violence', 'willingness', 'dish', 'out', 'How', 'when', 'did', 'acquire', 'Perhaps', 'prequel', 'order']",N/A

In his directorial debut, he shows he still has the stuff we first saw in his joint work with Matt Damon in their Academy Award winning ""Good Will Hunting.""Now add Casey Affleck to this list of talented guys from Boston, for he shines in this, his brother's loose adaptation of Dennis Lehane's book of the same title.The basic premise: A young girl is taken from her mother, people want to exchange the young girl for money, money gets shuffled around, and only a few really know what's going on. You, viewer, are not the privileged few. You must hang with Casey Affleck's private detective, first-person narrative to learn anything. This performance, although much lower-keyed and diametrically opposite, is as perfectly rendered as the role of serial killer he plays in the recently-releasedThe Killer Inside Me. The two years between roles wrought subtle, yet incredible changes in Affleck's appearance.  In ""Baby"" he had a softer look, a much gentler nature that reeks of sincerity. In ""Killer"" he looks taller, more wired, and, although affable, like a conductor coil about to be fired. The biggest difference, however, is that his ""Baby"" character follows not only the law, but the letter of the law! No moral dilemmas with his mindset. In ""Killer"" Affleck's character does what he wants. He is his own moral law. What the two roles do have in common is the narrative line. However, to hear a killer devoid of a moral compass wax on is quite different from hearing the voice of a person committed to truth, justice, and the American Way. In fact, it's this tight connection to Right that determines the painful and just or unjust ending to ""Baby.""A fine cast of actors fleshes out this convoluted, morally twisted story: Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, Michelle Monaghan, each contributing or part of the dilemma at movie's end.In fact, this movie raises as much controversy in its conclusion as didThe Deep End of the Ocean. What IS the right thing to do?

1128512,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0010ZR160,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 6]","When I first started hearing the praise for this movie shortly before its release to theaters in 2007, I found myself becoming very interested in seeing it. Critics were praising the excellent performances from the entire cast, the gripping storytelling, and most surprising of all, they were praising Ben Affleck, not for his acting ability but for his directorial debut with this supposedly mesmerizing, intense, and all too true-to-life film titled ""Gone Baby Gone"". So, when it arrived to DVD I just had to see for myself if Ben's directing was as good as some of his better acting days in films such as ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Hollywoodland"", or if it was just another artsy-type of movie that generally only critics like but most moviegoers could care less about.""Gone Baby Gone"" begins when a young girl is kidnapped, and two private detectives (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) are brought on board by the victim's family to help solve the crime. As the mystery surrounding the girl's disappearance begins to unfold, the secrets that are unearthed will change the lives of virtually every single person involved with the case. With time working against them, these two detectives must risk everything to do what's right in the midst of a case where they have no idea who to trust and nothing is at all what it seems.Well, let me say that after viewing ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ben Affleck should have no worries about landing any future directing jobs, because he showed that he has a steady-hand when it comes to helming a film, and the subject matter is as serious as it gets both in life and in cinema, yet Ben's focus never seems to waiver one second in the narrative of the picture. Tremendous kudos must go to Ben Affleck for tackling this challenging film, and for showing all the critics that he is truly a talent to be respected in his field.The story for ""Gone Baby Gone"" is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane (author of ""Mystic River""), and was adapted for the screen by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard. The script is incredibly well-written, and is packed full of so many twists and turns that if you lose focus for one minute you'll be lost as to what is exactly going on in the film. That is how fast the playing field seems to change in this movie. Just when you think you've got the movie figured out, and you know exactly what occurred and who was responsible, think again because the rug gets yanked out from beneath you and once more you are left puzzled, but never to the point of confusion or disbelief. Every twist in this story is completely plausible, never once calling upon the audience to suspend their disbelief for even a second. The story is superbly crafted and is a testament to the writers' abilities to include so many shifts in the story, and yet they never lose focus or contradict themselves. Brilliant work on the part of everyone involved in the writing process for this film, from the novel to the screenplay everyone deserves great credit for this piece.The actors were all extremely talented individuals and each rose to the task at hand of presenting such heavy subject matter with the proper respect it deserves. Casey Affleck (""Ocean's Thirteen"") shows that he has the acting talent to handle the leading man role, and also finds himself for the first time in his career being able to step out from his older brother Ben's shadow and establish himself on his own merits. Granted Ben directed Casey in this film, but even the best director's can't get such a gripping performance out of an actor if he or she is not up to the challenge, and clearly Casey is. The supporting cast led by Morgan Freeman (""Se7en""), Ed Harris (""A History of Violence""), and Michelle Monaghan (""Mission: Impossible 3"") are just as superb as their lead actor, and each gave such earnest performances that all should have been Oscar worthy, but unfortunately most of them weren't. The only member of the cast to be nominated for an Oscar was actress Amy Ryan (""Dan in Real Life""), who portrayed the young girl's mother in the film. Amy's performance was so incredibly realistic as a woman whose daughter is kidnapped, yet due to her drug-filled life she can't seem to completely fathom just what has exactly happened at first. However, once she does her heartbreaking realization that her life may have led to this unfortunate circumstance is so overwhelming that you feel so much sympathy for her instantly, regardless of what you'd seen of her earlier in the film, and her vows to clean up seem so earnest and heartfelt that you desperately want to believe in her. Yet in the back of your mind you wonder that if the daughter is brought back to her, the likelihood of her mother actually changing her life, and walking the straight and narrow is slim to none. Even if that is the case, and the mother never changes, you still want the daughter to be returned safely in the end, but you do stop to think that maybe the daughter would be better off with someone else raising her rather than her own mother, who never seemed to care that much about her before. It is quandaries such as this that makes ""Gone Baby Gone"" such an interesting, and sometimes difficult movie to watch.With outstanding performances, gripping drama, and solid directing from first time director Ben Affleck, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is one of the most intense dramas I have watched in awhile. If you are looking for a movie that will keep you interested from start to finish, but will also leave you pondering the various questions it poses long after the credits have finished rolling, then ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a film you must see.""Gone Baby Gone"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,"The Deeper You Go, The Darker The Secrets...",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,5677,"['When',

Very quickly, however, I was drawn into the intense drama on the screen.  This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, and extremely thought provoking.  It is not easy to watch.  But it is very much worth seeing.I like my movies to entertain me, teach me something, or make me think.  GONE BABY GONE definitely falls into that third category.  It is not always easy to define right from wrong, good from bad, black from white.  And when the life of a child is involved, the moral areas get grayer and grayer.  Is it right to commit a crime, if it will improve the life and happiness of a child?  This question is posed in many different ways in this film, and the answer is never clear or easy.Overall, the acting is very good.  Headliners Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Ed Harris give realistic, believable, heartfelt performances.  The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan, Michelle Monaghan, and John Ashton are all very strong and genuine.  In some cases, perhaps the performances were almost too realistic; I had some difficulty in a few places understanding the thick, almost mumbled, South Boston accent.First time director Ben Affleck does an outstanding job.

1128517,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B0010ZR160,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[17, 21]","This isn't an easy film to watch but it is one of the year's stunners and I am shocked that it didn't get more attention when it came to the Oscar nominations. While I loved it for many reasons, not the least of which was a breakout performance by Casey Affleck, I'd have to say one of the most powerful aspects of this movie may be exactly the thing that turns so many viewers off- it takes a long, hard look at the moral complexities of life and the difficulty in doing the ""right"" thing and making the best choice, especially when it comes to children and their rights.Some people think that Casey Affleck, playing a young private investigator, comes across as rigidly moral and ethical, especially towards the end of the film. I think differently. All though the film, you can see him struggling with his anger, which threatens to overwhelm him (and does, at points) and his conscience as well as his religious values. More than once, he brings up what his priest would say about certain situations. Some things don't ""rest easy"" with him. And yet he has trouble figuring out why and how best to address his ambivalence. He can't seem to fathom the deepest ramifications of his decisions, to see clearly the potential for harm even when one is trying to do good.The movie revolves around the kidnapping of a child, her drug-addicted and inattentive mother and some private investigators who work with the police to try and find the child.Affleck's on-screen partner and lover, played by Angela Monaghan, almost steals the show and I think she was an important counterpart to Affleck's role, even though he is clearly meant to be the lead actor.Where he is often rigid in his opinions, she relates to people on a gut level and senses what is truly right and what could lead to more serious consequences. I found her compassion, heart and way of relating to people to be very compelling and moving.There is a key part of the movie where she doesn't hesitate to risk her life, leaving the men around her stunned at her nerve - and leaving me awed as well.The message I got? When one's beliefs are truly integrated with one's heart, then there is no hesitation during even life-threatening moments. Monaghan was willing to put her life on the line to try and save a child. At the end of the film, I believe she still felt that way and had come to a very different conclusion about how to do that than her partner. Watch it and see what you think - and why the lead characters made the choices they did.There are some parts of the film that may confuse and baffle viewers so I'll warn you right now about those:1. THe language and plot. Graphic, often bloody, full of every curse word you could imagine. Not one for the kids to watch. The dirty and seamier side of life is shown, in all its ugliness. People in this one are hard and some are permanently ungrounded.2. The mumbling and often inarticulate accents of the characters. This was not a distraction for me but it was for some of our friends. Those with even minor hearing issues may have a problem.3. The confusing plot line. It was NOT confusing for me to follow but I did watch the film three times. I'd also read the book. There are a lot of twists and turns in this film. Viewers have to stay alert and need to care about hanging in there. The film can drag in some parts.Even with all the potential pitfalls for viewers, I highly recommend Gone, Baby, Gone. It pushes viewers to think about what they'd do in a difficult situation. It raises questions and inspires debate. Finally, it reveals what brings couples together and the types of issues that can separate them irrevocably, based on one decision. The decision, of course, is not a minor one.",5,Forces the viewer to confront the realities of moral and ethical questions - which side are you on?,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,3712,"[""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'year', 'stunners', 'am', 'shocked', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'attention', 'when', 'came', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'loved', 'many', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'breakout', 'performance', 'Casey', 'Affleck', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'aspects', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'exactly', 'thing', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'off-', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'moral', 'complexities', 'life', 'difficulty', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'making', 'best', 'choice', 'especially', 'when', 'children', 'rights.Some', 'people', 'think', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'playing', 'young', 'private', 'investigator', 'rigidly', 'moral', 'ethical', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'think', 'differently', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'struggling', 'anger', 'overwhelm', 'points', 'conscience', 'as', 'well', 'religious', 'values', 'More', 'once', 'up', 'what', 'priest', 'would', 'say', 'certain', 'situations', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'rest', 'easy', 'yet', 'trouble', 'figuring', 'out', 'why', 'how', 'best', 'address', 'ambivalence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fathom', 'deepest', 'ramifications', 'decisions', 'see', 'clearly', 'potential', 'harm', 'even', 'when', 'one', 'trying', 'do', 'good.The', 'movie', 'revolves', 'kidnapping', 'child', 'drug-addicted', 'inattentive', 'mother', 'private', 'investigators', 'who', 'work', 'police', 'try', 'find', 'child.Affleck', 'on-screen', 'partner', 'lover', 'played', 'Angela', 'Monaghan', 'almost', 'show', 'think', 'was', 'important', 'counterpart', 'Affleck', 'role', 'even', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'lead', 'actor.Where', 'often', 'rigid', 'opinions', 'people', 'gut', 'level', 'what', 'truly', 'right', 'what', 'could', 'lead', 'more', 'serious', 'consequences', 'found', 'compassion', 'heart', 'way', 'relating', 'people', 'be', 'very', 'compelling', 'key', 'part', 'movie', 'where', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'risk', 'life', 'leaving', 'men', 'stunned', 'nerve', 'leaving', 'awed', 'well.The', 'message', 'got', 'When', 'one', 'beliefs', 'are', 'truly', 'integrated', 'one', 'heart', 'then', 'hesitation', 'even', 'life-threatening', 'moments', 'Monaghan', 'was', 'willing', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'try', 'save', 'child', 'end', 'film', 'believe', 'still', 'felt', 'way', 'had', 'come', 'very', 'different', 'conclusion', 'how', 'do', 'partner', 'Watch', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'why', 'lead', 'characters', 'made', 'choices', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'confuse', 'baffle', 'viewers', 'so', ""'ll"", 'warn', 'right', 'now', 'those:1', 'THe', 'language', 'plot', 'Graphic', 'often', 'bloody', 'full', 'curse', 'word', 'could', 'imagine', 'Not', 'one', 'kids', 'watch', 'dirty', 'seamier', 'side', 'life', 'shown', 'ugliness', 'People', 'one', 'are', 'hard', 'are', 'permanently', 'ungrounded.2', 'mumbling', 'often', 'inarticulate', 'accents', 'characters', 'was', 'not', 'distraction', 'was', 'friends', 'even', 'minor', 'hearing', 'issues', 'may', 'have', 'problem.3', 'confusing', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'NOT', 'confusing', 'follow', 'did', 'watch', 'film', 'three', 'times', ""'d"", 'also', 'read', 'book', 'are', 'lot', 'twists', 'film', 'Viewers', 'have', 'stay', 'alert', 'need', 'care', 'hanging', 'there', 'film', 'can', 'drag', 'parts.Even', 'potential', 'pitfalls', 'viewers', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'viewers', 'think', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'difficult', 'situation', 'questions', 'inspires', 'debate', 'Finally', 'what', 'together', 'types', 'issues', 'can', 'separate', 'irrevocably', 'based', 'one', 'decision', 'decision', 'course', 'not', 'minor', 'one']",N/A
1128518,A2VZA7NZR75G3T,B0010ZR160,Kevin O'Mahoney,"[9, 19]","I'm from South Boston and I really hoped to like this film.  Unfortunately, that was not possible.  I am mystified by the fawning reviews.  The foundation of the movie is the working relationship between Casey Affleck, as a young, naive, bratty gum shoe, and seasoned, grizzled Boston detectives was unrealistic.  As a criminal defense lawyer, I know Boston police detectives would never permit a private investigator to tag along on their investigations, never mind negotiate a ransom in a high-profile kidnapping case.  Following a ""botched"" exchange of the missing girl for the stolen money, the girl is presumed dead.  No body.  No resolution.  No leads.  Didn't make the slightest bit of sense.  From there, the movie descends into painfully cliche, sanctimonious drivel as Affleck obsesses over the child's death and the white-trash, drug addicted/alcoholic mother grieves her ""dead"" daughter.Just when it appears the movie is over, it abruptly switches gears -- into another child kidnapping.  And by solving this kidnapping, Affleck stumbles upon just enough clues to solve the original kidnapping and unravel a top level conspiracy within the Boston PD.Casey Affleck, who was very good in Good Will Hunting, was not believable as a tough guy, private investigator.  Ed Harris -- who usually gives a solid, credible performance -- overacted.  Morgan Freeman, nearly always flawless playing a distinguished authority figure, was at best mediocre.  With that kind of acting talent available, I can only conclude the less than compelling acting by Harris and Freeman was due to bad directing.  The bad script, of course, did not help matters.Finally, as a life-long Bostonian, I was relieved that Ben Affleck chose real-life Boston based actors to play the supporting roles.  But while the Boston accents were authentic, he must have gone out of his way to find the least attractive Bostonians available.  I mean, most of the cast appeared sub-human, as if Bostonians sprung from some caliginous, recidivist, contaminated cesspool.",1,"Bad Script, Bad Acting, Bad Directing",1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,2036,"[""'m"", 'South', 'Boston', 'really', 'hoped', 'like', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'am', 'mystified', 'fawning', 'reviews', 'foundation', 'movie', 'working', 'relationship', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'young', 'naive', 'bratty', 'gum', 'shoe', 'seasoned', 'grizzled', 'Boston', 'detectives', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'criminal', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'know', 'Boston', 'police', 'detectives', 'would', 'never', 'permit', 'private', 'investigator', 'tag', 'along', 'investigations', 'never', 'mind', 'negotiate', 'ransom', 'high-profile', 'kidnapping', 'case', 'Following', 'botched', 'exchange', 'missing', 'girl', 'stolen', 'money', 'girl', 'presumed', 'dead', 'body', 'resolution', 'leads', 'Did', ""n't"", 'make', 'slightest', 'bit', 'sense', 'there', 'movie', 'painfully', 'cliche', 'sanctimonious', 'drivel', 'Affleck', 'child', 'death', 'white-trash', 'drug', 'addicted/alcoholic', 'mother', 'dead', 'daughter.Just', 'when', 'movie', 'abruptly', 'gears', 'child', 'kidnapping', 'solving', 'kidnapping', 'Affleck', 'upon', 'just', 'enough', 'clues', 'solve', 'original', 'kidnapping', 'unravel', 'top', 'level', 'conspiracy', 'Boston', 'PD.Casey', 'Affleck', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'tough', 'guy', 'private', 'investigator', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'usually', 'solid', 'credible', 'performance', 'overacted', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'nearly', 'always', 'flawless', 'playing', 'distinguished', 'authority', 'figure', 'was', 'best', 'mediocre', 'kind', 'acting', 'talent', 'available', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'less', 'compelling', 'acting', 'Harris', 'Freeman', 'was', 'due', 'bad', 'directing', 'bad', 'script', 'course', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'matters.Finally', 'life-long', 'Bostonian', 'was', 'relieved', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'chose', 'real-life', 'Boston', 'based', 'actors', 'play', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Boston', 'accents', 'were', 'authentic', 'must', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'find', 'least', 'attractive', 'Bostonians', 'available', 'mean', 'most', 'cast', 'appeared', 'sub-human', 'Bostonians', 'sprung', 'caliginous', 'recidivist', 'contaminated', 'cesspool']",N/A

From the previews, it looked like a competent--if familiar--genre picture.  I was galvanized, finally, to see the film based on Amy Ryan's practical sweep of the award season's Best Supporting Actress Prizes.  The Affleck brothers, Ben as Director and Casey as Star, did nothing to alleviate my limited expectations.  But something quite unexpected happened--my opinion completely changed as I was caught up in the twists of this genuinely good sleeper.  Ben Affleck has generated a brisk, tough and uncompromising film and Casey Affleck has turned himself into a bona fide leading man!  And although not a flawless film, I ended up loving ""Gone Baby Gone.""When a child goes missing, the community of Dorchester gets caught in a media frenzy.  With Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris as officials in charge of the investigation, Casey Affleck (as a local detective) is brought in by the family as additional help.  Having been raised in the area, it is felt that these contacts may give him better access to and communication with the tightlipped Boston neighborhood.  Immediately, the story starts to unravel and the sympathetic mother (Amy Ryan) turns out to be not so sympathetic.  The route the film follows takes us to some familiar territory but also to unchartered waters.  The film dares to raise moral and ethical questions and presents a terrific and thoroughly uncompromising ending!  The film's final moments put this head and shoulders above traditional Hollywood product.  And I give Ben Affleck full credit for not bending to a more stereotypical conclusion.""Gone Baby Gone"" is actually the fourth in a series of novels by crime writer Dennis Lehane featuring private detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.  It is, however, the first to be treated to a big screen adaptation.  Those familiar with the novels know that the Kenzie/Gennaro dynamic provides much emotion and conflict.  Their relationship is almost as important as any case that they work.  Fans of this aspect of Lehane's novels, therefore, might be a bit disappointed.  In making this stand-alone film, Gennaro is largely marginalized and the impact of what happens to them as a couple isn't as significant to the story as it is in the book.  That said, film and novels are two different mediums and ""Gone Baby Gone"" as a film still works exceedingly well in its own right.Casey Affleck is not the conventional actor one would picture for this role.  Small in stature, relaxed in delivery--his offbeat presence actually makes ""Gone Baby Gone"" even more intriguing.  As he is not a predictable ""leading man,"" you're never quite sure what he's going to do.  I found this lack of expectation to be quite invigorating and led me to accept and appreciate the twists of the film to a greater degree.  With ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" this was Casey's year to redefine himself.

The police captain (Morgan Freeman) isn't having any luck with the investigation, so the child's aunt hires two private detectives (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) to help.  Their work takes them into a cruel world where life is very cheap.This movie really surprised me.  First off, it was a tense and scary detective story, but then it became a story about Right and Wrong, leaving the audience to judge the actions and the characters.  While it's full of violence, depravity, and bad language, it is a memorable story that deserves to be discussed.  The actors are uniformly superb, especially Morgan Freeman in a very sympathetic role.  Casey Affleck is excellent as the detective with street cred despite his baby face, and Ed Harris does his usual great job playing a police officer.  Boston native Ben Affleck directed the movie on location, giving a sleazy, but apparently accurate look at life in the area.The moral dilemma posed at the end is not easily answered.

1128528,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,B0010ZR160,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[2, 5]","I bought this dvd based on the trailer viewed on another dvd which gave the impression that it was going to be a movie about a heartbroken mother who wanted her child back, a dedicated sleuth who looks for the child, racing against time and maybe a gang of sickos.  It was pretty shocking to discover that the biggest sicko in the movie was the mother herself. I'm not going to go through the plot and actors and so on since so many other reviewers have done that.  I want to talk about something else.I noticed the opening monologue, but didn't realize that this was the big clue to how the movie was going to end until it was a done deal.  At the beginning, Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, says in a voiceover:""I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are. Your city, your neighborhood, your family. People here take pride in these things, like it was something they'd accomplished. The bodies around their souls, the cities wrapped around those. I lived on this block my whole life; most of these people have. When your job is to find people who are missing, it helps to know where they started. I find the people who started in the cracks and then fell through. This city can be hard. When I was young, I asked my priest how you could get to heaven and still protect yourself from all the evil in the world. He told me what God said to His children. ""You are sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.""Unfortunately, he was neither; he was just naive and brainwashed by his religious tendencies and this is what led to the very disturbing ending: the destruction of many lives - including that of the child herself - because one man was so hung up on rules that he could not see that there is good, there is evil, and there is the specific situation that determines which is which.  For Patrick Kenzie - as for George Bush and other authoritarian personalities - things are black and white and this black and white thinking literally destroyed any possibility that he could see his way to make the RIGHT decision.And yes, in my opinion, he made the wrong decision.  That, of course, does not mean that I think that the cops involved in the ""benevolent abduction"" did the right thing either; they clearly did not. But life is never so simple as the Patrick Kenzie's of the world would like to think. Sometimes very hard decisions have to be made in very conflicting situations, and most often, the conflicts are the result of cognitive dissonance created by our programmed belief systems that often do not serve as adequate models of reality.The main problem of Kenzie's choice is that it was a choice based on an artificial construct: morality, rather than on conscience.  Oh, of course, he THOUGHT it was his conscience, but he made it clear in his opening monologue that true conscience had nothing to do with it when he said: ""I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are.""Nobody chooses to be born in Boston as opposed to Beijing.When talking about morality, the idea of good and evil can be very different for different people with different beliefs. That means it is subjective rather than objective. And here I use these terms in the sense that objective means ""the way the Universe with its comprehensive perspective views itself"" as opposed to the way an individual or even a group of individuals may view events in the universe.It could even be said that no one ever does anything deliberately in the interests of evil, for the sake of evil, per se, but rather that everyone acts in the interests of good, _as he understands it_! But everybody understands it in a different way! As a result of these subjective views of evil, human beings inflict all kinds of suffering on others in the interests of what they consider to be good.  That's the dilemma portrayed in this movie, whether accidentally or intentionally.George Bush, killing a million Iraqis in order to ""force democracy"" on them is one example. Israel occupying Palestine based on the claims of their religion, and committing genocide on the Palestinian people is another example.What we see, then, is that there is no morality common to all. One set of moral precepts can - and often does - contradict another set. What is moral in Boston may not be moral in Beijing. What is moral in Helsinki, may not be moral in Ethiopia. What is moral in Judaism, is not necessarily moral in Christianity or Islam.  What is moral to the lowest classes - generally controlled very well by religious beliefs - is not necessarily moral to the educated classes.Morality is more directly related to rules and laws, black and white interpretations of what is good and bad. Two very moral men from different cultures may consider each other very immoral. More than that, the more `moral' a person is, the more `immoral' will he think other moral people from different cultures!In this case, Patrick Kenzie thought of himself as a VERY moral person and he saw the cops, who had taken a child of the lower classes to raise as very immoral.  They weren't, though certainly their methods of going about doing what they did were extremely questionable.  (It's even questionable that anybody would ever actually do something like that - but that is a plot problem that others have addressed.)The problem is that we do not need morality, we need conscience since conscience is the interior connection between all normal humans (those who are not pathological).  The mother, in this movie, was clearly pathological.The idea of conscience is based on a different interpretation of reality, one that does not necessarily include hard and fast rules that apply in every situation such as our culture espouses under the influence of Judao-Christian influences. Conscience is reflected in a much older system that existed among many tribes of Celts before it was overcome and destroyed by the imposition of Judao-Christianity (by force).The destruction of Celtic culture was so complete that we know very little about their religion - we have to infer principles from rags and tatters of evidence. We do know that they celebrated their ""rites"" in forests and by lakes without erecting any covered temples or statues of divinities. Tacitus tells us:""They do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls, or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance. Their holy places are woods and groves and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eyes of reverence.""Plato had doubts about the Greek origins of Homer's work because not only do the physical descriptions in his poems not correspond to the Greek world, but also the Homeric philosophy is very different from the mainstream Greek philosophy we know about today. The latter is based on the dualism of two opposing elements, thesis/antithesis, good/evil, life/death, body/soul, etc. This is also the perspective of the related Judao-Christian system - at least as it has come to be known in our modern world. It could be said that the early Jesus people were more in tune with the ancient Celtic system as is evidenced by their God of Mercy. But that's before the gospel writers came on the scene and created myths. (See Burton Mack's ""A Myth of Innocence"" for detailed analysis.)Since Plato's times, many have sought to derive ""synthesis"" from opposing elements, with little success.According to Homer, the philosophy of the ancient world was that there was a third element that linked the opposing elements. Between the body and the soul, there is the spirit. Between life and death there is the transformation that is possible to the individual, between father and mother there is the child who takes the characteristics of both father and mother, and between good and evil there is the SPECIFIC SITUATION that determines which is which and what ought to be done.In other words, there are three simultaneous determinants in any situation that make it impossible to say that any list of things is ""good"" or ""evil"" intrinsically, and that the true determinant is the situation.In any event, the symbol of this philosophy is the triskele, representing three waves joined together.The simultaneous existence of the third element does not mean that the notion of ""good"" and ""evil"" did not exist or was not reflected in the Celtic law. What was clear was that it was understood that nothing could be ""cut and dried"" in terms of law, that each situation was unique and the circumstances had to be carefully weighed.And so, considering the Third Force, the specific situation, I would suggest that what the cops did was definitely evil; but what Kenzie did afterward, was also evil.  The whole movie was about evil, authoritarian personalities all of whom, in one way or another, were engaged in efforts to use other people for some, even the best of aims (according to the view of the individual initiating the action), without their knowledge and understanding.  Manipulating others, using others, either by producing in them faith or by acting upon them through fear, is evil. It seems to me that depriving people of knowledge, and inducing their compliance or participation to the aims of someone with a subjective morality, under conditions of what can even be called brainwashing, is what is the essence of evil. To deceive naive people and produce in them faith, infatuation, enthusiasm, and even fanaticism for subjective aims - even if the person subjectively thinks those aims are ""good"" - is evil authoritarianism.The authoritarian personality comes in two flavors: the top dogs and the followers, and the two types are motivated differently even if both are under the heading of ""Authoritarian Personality.""  The reason for this is that it takes the followers to support the top dogs and together, they make a social structure that seems to be a part of any society to one extent or another.  It is only when such a structure begins to dominate that society as a whole, that problems follow because the essence of authoritarianism is righteous totalitarianism.The top dogs are a rather small group - a fraction of the total authoritarians - and they are described by social scientists as having ""high dominance needs.""  ""These are people who seize every opportunity to lead, and who enjoy having power over others,"" John Dean, author ofConservatives Without Conscience, and, more than that, they feel no remorse whatsoever about using others and breaking the rules to service their own agendas. This is clearly seen in this movie in the roles played by the cops in the ""benevolent kidnapping"" of the baby.The followers are something else altogether - and they complement the tog dog types completely.  These are people who accept the rules of ""established authorities"" pretty much without question.  We see this aspect of Kenzie in his dogged determination to follow the rules no matter how many people it will destroy, including the child. Such people usually are brainwashed by religion very early and this gives them a deeply rooted conviction that ""higher authorities"" not only know best, but are ""unassailably correct.""Such individuals will also aggressively support their chosen authority.  They do not hesitate to inflict pain, suffering, even destruction, on others they see threatening the ""legitimate authority.""Authoritarian followers also have very conventional, black and white, views of reality. They restrict themselves very closely to the rules that are laid out for them in whatever milieu they are born.  They don't stray from their own kind, their own communities, and believe that they were born in a certain ""place"" and must stay in it. This conformity can be extreme to the point that such individuals become insular with their own kind, feel hostile to outsiders and novel information and ideas, and completely uncritical of the authority in their lives as they were growing up.  They are able to juggle extreme cognitive disparity, accepting bizarre contradictions in thought, and are usually unable to see their own hypocrisy. They also generally feel that they are moral and righteous in all they do.Watching this movie, the various characters and how they interacted, reveals these characteristics and dynamics in blatant display.Now, read again what Patrick Kenzie said at the beginning of the movie and see the inner landscape of the authoritarian follower:""I always believed it was the things you don't choose that makes you who you are. Your city, your neighborhood, your family. People here take pride in these things, like it was something they'd accomplished. The bodies around their souls, the cities wrapped around those. I lived on this block my whole life; most of these people have. When your job is to find people who are missing, it helps to know where they started. I find the people who started in the cracks and then fell through. This city can be hard. When I was young, I asked my priest how you could get to heaven and still protect yourself from all the evil in the world. He told me what God said to His children. ""You are sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, yet innocent as doves.""""In this movie, an authoritarian follower came up against outsider top dogs, and therein lies the tale...A fascinating psychological drama for those who can see these layers, a generally good movie even if you aren't fascinated by such questions.I would have given it five stars if it had not been for the gratuitous profanity.  I noticed that other Bostonians writing reviews have pointed out that this wasn't very realistic. But then, maybe they don't move in those ""circles.""

1128530,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0010ZR160,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 6]","Casey Affleck is having a great year in the movies, what with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and his stellar performance in ""Gone Baby Gone.""  I think Affleck would have been a shoe-in for the Oscar for the former role (it really is the lead part in the film, much more so than Brad Pitt's Jesse James), if he were not up against Javier Bardem's performance in ""No Country for Old Men,"" but arguable what he does in the latter film is of more importance for his career because two points define a line segment.  Casey Affleck can do more than broadly drawn character comedy and here is the proof.It does not take long watching ""Gone Baby Gone"" to be reminded of ""Mystic River,"" another crime thriller set in Boston, which is not surprising since both novels were written by Dennis Lehane.  The key difference is that ""Gone Baby Gone"" is the fourth of (to date) five novels by Lehane about the private investigator team of Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan).  Their area of specialization is tracking down missing people, which is to say deadbeat dads and the like.  So when they are approached by Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel (Titus Welliver), about helping in the investigation regarding their missing niece, Amanda, the two PIs feel they are in over their head.  But a little girl from the neighborhood is missing, and they want to do what they can to help.  After all, Bea thinks a couple of locals can get do a better job of digging around Dorchester for answers.  It does not take long for them to find out this is not going to be an easy case.This is especially true because Amanda's mother, Helene McCready (the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan), turns out to have been a pathetic figure long before her daughter disappeared.  When Kenzie and Gennaro find out what her particular package of problems happens to be, they start looking at the case in a whole new light, trying to make sense of it all in time to save the little girl.  No more need be said about the plot and if this is not enough to persuade you to check out the film then notice that the supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and John Ashton.  Anytime Freeman or Harris make a movie I am inclined to check it out when it is released on DVD, so having both of them in the film is a really good sign that this one might be something special.I really liked this movie (a lot more than last year's Best Picture winner ""The Departed""), although I wonder if I had an advantage during the opening act because I already knew that Casey Affleck act having seen his other big movie of 2008.  If you keep thinking about the bratty kid from ""Good Will Hunting"" and lesser fare then it might take you a while to accept Affleck carrying the heavy load, although Monaghan, his character's ""better half,"" is providing ample support along the way.  Because older brother Ben both directed the film and co-wrote the script with Aaron Stockard, there is a tendency to think that the first-time director is looking out for his little brother.  But to be fair, this movie works because the Afflecks have a high regard for the Boston in which they grew up, and they are just being true to their neighborhood.  You do not need to listen to the commentary track by the director and his co-writer to know this is the case, because there is ample evidence on the screen.  I suppose there is no particular motivations for the Afflecks to do another one of novels in this series for the big screen, but it would be nice given how well they did on this one.",5,The Brothers Affleck successfully bring another Dennis Lehane crime novel to the big screen,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,3633,"['Casey', 'Affleck', 'having', 'great', 'year', 'movies', 'what', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'think', 'Affleck', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-in', 'Oscar', 'former', 'role', 'really', 'lead', 'part', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jesse', 'James', 'were', 'not', 'up', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'performance', 'No', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'arguable', 'what', 'latter', 'film', 'more', 'importance', 'career', 'two', 'points', 'define', 'line', 'segment', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'broadly', 'drawn', 'character', 'comedy', 'here', 'proof.It', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'watching', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'be', 'reminded', 'Mystic', 'River', 'crime', 'thriller', 'set', 'Boston', 'not', 'surprising', 'novels', 'were', 'written', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'key', 'difference', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'fourth', 'date', 'five', 'novels', 'Lehane', 'private', 'investigator', 'team', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Affleck', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'area', 'specialization', 'tracking', 'down', 'missing', 'people', 'say', 'deadbeat', 'dads', 'like', 'So', 'when', 'are', 'approached', 'Bea', 'McCready', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'husband', 'Lionel', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'about', 'helping', 'investigation', 'regarding', 'missing', 'niece', 'Amanda', 'two', 'PIs', 'feel', 'are', 'head', 'little', 'girl', 'neighborhood', 'missing', 'want', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'help', 'Bea', 'couple', 'locals', 'can', 'get', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'digging', 'around', 'Dorchester', 'answers', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'case.This', 'especially', 'true', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'Helene', 'McCready', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'pathetic', 'figure', 'long', 'daughter', 'disappeared', 'When', 'Kenzie', 'Gennaro', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'particular', 'package', 'problems', 'happens', 'be', 'start', 'looking', 'case', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'time', 'save', 'little', 'girl', 'more', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'plot', 'not', 'enough', 'persuade', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'then', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'John', 'Ashton', 'Anytime', 'Freeman', 'Harris', 'make', 'movie', 'am', 'inclined', 'check', 'out', 'when', 'released', 'DVD', 'so', 'having', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'sign', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'special.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'last', 'year', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'Departed', 'wonder', 'had', 'advantage', 'opening', 'act', 'already', 'knew', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'act', 'having', 'seen', 'other', 'big', 'movie', '2008', 'keep', 'thinking', 'bratty', 'kid', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'lesser', 'fare', 'then', 'might', 'take', 'while', 'accept', 'Affleck', 'carrying', 'heavy', 'load', 'Monaghan', 'character', 'better', 'half', 'providing', 'ample', 'support', 'way', 'older', 'brother', 'Ben', 'directed', 'film', 'co-wrote', 'script', 'Aaron', 'Stockard', 'tendency', 'think', 'first-time', 'director', 'looking', 'out', 'little', 'brother', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'Afflecks', 'have', 'high', 'regard', 'Boston', 'grew', 'up', 'are', 'just', 'being', 'true', 'neighborhood', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'listen', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'co-writer', 'know', 'case', 'ample', 'evidence', 'screen', 'suppose', 'particular', 'motivations', 'Afflecks', 'do', 'one', 'novels', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'given', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'one']",N/A

1128534,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B0010ZR160,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[0, 0]","In adapting Boston resident Dennis Lehane's crime novel Gone Baby Gone to the screen, the co-writer/director Ben Affleck chose what could be called a flat style, referring to a rock solid focus on what people really say, the words they really use in the wide range of emotional scenarios they're faced with. It's the antithesis of stylized; it's the first thing you think of when somebody says something to you that you like or you don't like; it's your first gut reaction to whatever was said.This tends to draw the viewer into the film in a kind of inevitable way; you can't help wanting to listen to what's going on. The most flamboyant character is Remy Bressant, a cop played by Ed Harris; in a way, he provides the ""style"" element that's otherwise counterbalanced by the straight-ahead performances of Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, the two young private investigators hired to find a missing little girl. Also counterbalancing Remy's more dramatic presence is Morgan Freeman, a quiet police captain who plays a critical role in the film.The four stars are for a thoughtful, well-crafted film that's not afraid to make substantial use of locals in the Dorchester section of Boston to tell this story of innocence and corruption. It's an involving film that pulls you into it in spite of its 'flatness', in spite of its clearly non-stylized approach.

The story was solid and overall the movie was excellent though complicated.  Gone Baby Gone is set in South Boston, full of ""tough, rough, street-wise"" working class people.  The commentary on the environment they grew up in and lived in set the stage for complicated cop/criminal politics and justice.  Their ""framing"" of what the world offers is examined under the stress of the kidnapping of a four year old girl.  Amy Ryan plays the mother of the abducted girl and her performance as a bad-mouthed, drug-using young mother is amazing.  She conveys her vulnerability and love for the child with deep emotion, and she proclaims she will change if they can just find her baby.  You end up thinking to yourself, ""Yes, but this resolve will last a day.""  She is pathetic, and sadly incompetent.Ed Harris is terrific as a conflicted cop, Casey Affleck plays a private detective and is in the lead role; all the actors are absolutely great.Overall the movie is well done, compelling and complicated, it gives you a sense of Boston's community life,  and the hard life they live.",4,"Compelling, Complicated Kidnap Caper",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,1663,"['Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'attention', 'gripping', 'tale', 'are', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'fine', 'directing', 'debut', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'just', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Affleck', 'brother', 'Casey', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'belongs', 'irresponsible', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mother', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'prejudice', 'bothered', 'child', 'welfare', 'dependable', 'care', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'first', 'script', 'story', 'life', 'imperfect', 'complicated.At', 'rate', 'cast', 'was', 'strong', 'including', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'story', 'was', 'solid', 'overall', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'complicated', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'set', 'South', 'Boston', 'full', 'tough', 'rough', 'street-wise', 'working', 'class', 'people', 'commentary', 'environment', 'grew', 'up', 'lived', 'set', 'stage', 'complicated', 'cop/criminal', 'politics', 'justice', 'framing', 'what', 'world', 'examined', 'stress', 'kidnapping', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'mother', 'abducted', 'girl', 'performance', 'bad-mouthed', 'drug-using', 'young', 'mother', 'amazing', 'conveys', 'vulnerability', 'love', 'child', 'deep', 'emotion', 'will', 'change', 'can', 'just', 'find', 'baby', 'end', 'up', 'thinking', 'yourself', 'Yes', 'resolve', 'will', 'last', 'day', 'pathetic', 'sadly', 'incompetent.Ed', 'Harris', 'terrific', 'conflicted', 'cop', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'private', 'detective', 'lead', 'role', 'actors', 'are', 'absolutely', 'great.Overall', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'compelling', 'complicated', 'sense', 'Boston', 'community', 'life', 'hard', 'life', 'live']",N/A

1128541,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0010ZR160,"Maine Writer ""David""","[4, 9]","It's bad enough to sit through one disappointing movie after another. What's far worse is to see critics fawning all over a mediocre effort like Gone Baby Gone -- something that seems to be happening with greater frequency since Crash (unfortunately) won an Oscar for best picture. Have standards plummeted? Are critics less able to tell a good story from a bad one? Are brownie points being handed out for beating lowered expectations? That may, in part, be the case with Gone, Baby, Gone, since so many reviews express surprise that Ben Affleck (the director here) was involved and the movie isn't a complete disaster. As for it not being a complete disaster, I agree. But it's not far off. The saving grace of the film is Amy Ryan (who plays a thoroughly convincing wreck of a mother), although one good performance does not a movie make.When I disagree with 94% of critics (at least according to Rotten Tomatoes), an explanation is probably in order.First, let me try to make some sense of the story.  (Yes, this means I will be revealing parts of the story.)A white trash, drug-addled mother (Amy Ryan) has a strikingly beautiful daughter who she basically ignores -- so much so that her aunt and uncle become her default parents. As it turns out, the uncle may not appreciate having to babysit the kid, so when he overhears that the mother and her boyfriend may have stolen a bunch of loot from a drug dealer, he leaps into action. (The movie is murky, and later twists around a bit as to the uncle and his motivations for the events that follow. Is it greed alone? Does he want to ""save"" a child from a her wretched mother? One might speculate that if he wanted the best for the child, he might preserve the status quo, given that he and his wife seemingly are surrogate parents anyway, and that the aunt (at least) profoundly loves the child. At various points, the film suggests that the uncle (in addition to wanting the money) sought to have the child taken away from the mother entirely, or somehow believed that the kidnapping and ransom would make the mother realize how much she loved her child and convert her from a criminal and a drug addict into a better parent. The first is rather crazy, the latter is crazed.)Returning to our story, the uncle, learning of the large cache of drug money, calls an old friend on the police force (a hammy Ed Harris) and, together, they apparently concoct the following plot: they're going to kidnap the little girl and, somehow, get the drug dough via blackmail. Somehow, they think this truly awful mother (who has basically abandoned the kid) is going to give up $150,000 for the return of the child she barely knows and can't be bothered with. (This is borne out after the kidnapping, when she barely seems interested in her daughter's fate.) In the meantime, someone beats the boyfriend to death looking for the drug money. (It is very possible, given the murky storytelling, that the uncle and his cop friend may be responsible for the beating. The drug dealer himself, we are told -- we are ""told"" just about everything in this movie -- didn't know about the theft until after the cop and uncle found out about it, and pretty convincingly denies any knowledge of the beating. In fact, he seems surprised to hear about the theft. So, perhaps, beating to death the mother's boyfriend is part of the plan concocted by the uncle and the cop. Given the moralizing of the story, why not? It's okay to kill people vigilante-style, plant evidence, and kidnap children. But I digress.)Our story continues.Apparently, the uncle didn't count on his wife being upset about the kidnapping of a niece she obviously adores. (Try to figure that one out.) And, as a consequence, the entire kidnapping plan gets out of hand as the aunt does what any caring relative would do when a little girl goes missing: she enlists the media and just about everyone else (including our main character and his girlfriend) to find the kid. It appears that this happens even before the uncle and cop even attempt to exchange the kid for the money takes place.At this point, it really is worth asking whether the uncle and his cop friend ever really planned to give the kid back in exchange for money. After all, these two (we later learn -- or do we?) were most concerned about getting the kid away from the mother. Or, as later exposition (yet again) alternatively suggests, were they just trying to put the fear of god into the mother -- so they'd get the dough and turn her into a first-rate mom who would love and cherish her kid? (Give me a break.) At least these two noble idiots managed to brutally torture and then shoot her no good boyfriend, right? Maybe. Who the hell knows?It goes downhill from there (if that's possible), and ends up with dopey reveal that an heroic police captain (Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman) helped to stage the death of the little girl (executing a drug dealer in the process) for the purpose of kidnapping the girl and transplanting her into a better home away from her white trash mother. (Maybe the captain was involved in the plot from the beginning, but things are so jumbled that it's hard to know.) Then, our protagonist faces the deep moral dilemma of turning in the bad cops and returning the kid to her mother (and her aunt, who adores the girl), or not turning in the bad cops, becoming an accessory to kidnapping, and continuing to allow the child's heartbroken aunt to believe the little girl drowned. The protagonist's girlfriend leaves him (maybe) because of his choice (does it really matter what the choice was?), and then he gets to babysit the little girl when her mother goes on a date.The End.Let me summarize.I found Gone, Baby, Gone sloppy and incoherent, not tough. It was filled with silly and incomprehensible ideas and moments, and rather than raising interesting moral issues, it presented them on a silver platter in these long, disjointed chunks of dialogue that felt like lectures in a low-rent philosophy class. The scene where Ed Harris recounts his own planting of evidence was bad acting, pure and simple, and even worse writing. You come away feeling like you've been lectured by a moron, which is hardly a way to draw the audience into a difficult ethical dilemma.Some characters inexplicably disappear (what happened to Ed Harris at the pedophile's house?), others behave incomprehensibly (you really think a seasoned police officer who had his own child abducted would put another family through that?), and the final reveal is more ridiculous than surprising. With the child declared ""dead,"" were they going to create an entirely fake identity for her? I suppose once you've kidnapped a child and left her loved ones devastated (at least some of them), murdered her father, and executed a couple of thugs, why not be an ""angel"" and obtain for her a fraudulent identity? I suppose these cops have enough connections to break into the local town office and plant a fake birth certificate and convince the Social Security Administration that they overlooked someone. Of course, then they have to deal with the fact that they've probably traumatized the kid by binding and blindfolding her, or was that just a fake flashback? And, forever after, they probably have to hide from this kid the true story of her life so as not to cause her even more psychological trauma.The entire mess concludes with this rather glibly ""artsy"" ending reminiscent of the final scene in The Graduate -- with the main character realizing that he's gotten what he asked for, and returned a child to a mother who didn't even know the name of her doll. Droll, at best.I get the sense that Ben Affleck simply couldn't handle the material. It was too complex for him, or perhaps too complex to be shoehorned into movie length. Either way, it's flawed and uninspired, except for the casting of a bunch of inbred yokels as extras.

1128543,A129YBX5BVNW2,B0010ZR160,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","There's a moment about 5 minutes into ""Gone Baby Gone"" when you think you might just have stumbled on a genuine masterpiece...As Casey Affleck ruminates in a weary beaten-up voiceover about good and evil and the life choices we make and how neighbourhoods shape us as people and those choices, the camera pans across the locals he's talking about and their Boston inner city terrain.These are real people in the real world - all manner of faces, colours and creeds - just going about their business - a man sat on the steps of a tenement building having a midday cigarette - kids of 8 and 9 flipping open their mobile phones - murals on walls declaring all sorts - a white father plops his baseball cap on the head of his gorgeous son of one who giggles, while a black father positions his equally gorgeous older son on the baseball circle in the local park with a sense of pride - all of it eventually making its way to a media circus outside a suburban home and a picture of a 9-year old girl on a tree...The opening minutes are full of these beautifully realised vignettes - the use of real Bostonians and their 'tough' suburbs adding a reality and power to Gone Baby Gone that is simply stunning - and that gritty reality continues throughout the film. And when you learn that the director is pretty boy Ben Affleck whom everyone loves to hate - you're more than impressed.But then of course it all goes to mush when the frankly ludicrously cherubic face of Casey Affleck appears with his equally drippy girlfriend Michelle Monaghan (an amazingly dull part for her) in tow beside him - they're the leads? We're expected to believe these dweebs?? While Casey is good in parts, he's out of his depth in others - and worse - a lot of the time you feel he's literally going to burst into a fit of the giggles at any moment. Monaghan is fabulous expressively as an actress, but her character Angie is a bit weedy and therefore difficult to care about - Angie seems almost superfluous to requirements (she was more fleshed out in the book).But then you ask yourself why did top quality actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris get involved in this movie - and the answer is the truly fabulous script adapted by Aaron Stockard from Denis Lehane's book of the same name. This is ""Mystic River"" territory - Lehane has worked in child abuse and abduction cases and knows his monsters and their families so well that his observations of them hurt you - literally. There are many scenes in this excellent film where I found myself tearful - and not always for the grotesque things that Miramax must show you about pervs and their ways - but for the humanity of the other people involved - an emotion that seems all too often missing from other films about this easy-to-exploit subject. Ben Affleck has imbibed his debut with genuine heart even if the story does go off the rails a bit towards the end.Given real meat to work with, the large varied cast is uniformly brilliant right down to even the smallest part - and just when you think you've seen all that Harris and Freeman have to give - they floor you - both of them - adding a gravitas throughout that must have had the older Affleck tingling in his Director's chair. John Ashton is superb too as Ed Harris' sidekick and Titus Welliver as the child's father Lionel who may or may not be a nice guy. But the big surprise is Amy Ryan (Oscar nominated) who plays the devious trailer-trash druggy mum Helen McCready whose daughter Amanda is the girl pictured everywhere and abducted. You hate her and yet empathise with her in equal measure - and you wonder (like Affleck's character does) should a 9-year old girl be back with this train wreck of a person - or does Helen McCready deserve a second chance at life like everyone else?  And who makes that decision?The Blu Ray print is surprisingly bad - speckled and blurry in the indoor and night scenes and hardly revelatory anywhere else. Also 2 of the special features cavalierly give away far too much of the plot and the twists - so don't watch either before you see the movie.  Also of note is David Buckley's tenderly evocative music, which gives many of the down and up scenes a hugely powerful lift.Despite being just a few notches short in places, ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a superb film - a genuine sleeper from 2008 - and Ben Affleck has arrived as a Director - big time.I was moved, confused, hurt and left thinking about difficult decisions.Highly recommended.",4,""" ...I Always Think That Life Is About The Choices You 'Don't' Make...""",1240185600,"04 20, 2009",2009,4464,"['moment', '5', 'minutes', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'when', 'think', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'stumbled', 'genuine', 'masterpiece', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'weary', 'beaten-up', 'voiceover', 'good', 'evil', 'life', 'make', 'how', 'neighbourhoods', 'shape', 'people', 'choices', 'camera', 'locals', 'talking', 'Boston', 'inner', 'city', 'terrain.These', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'manner', 'colours', 'creeds', 'just', 'going', 'business', 'man', 'sat', 'steps', 'tenement', 'building', 'having', 'midday', 'cigarette', 'kids', '8', '9', 'flipping', 'open', 'mobile', 'phones', 'murals', 'walls', 'declaring', 'sorts', 'white', 'father', 'baseball', 'cap', 'head', 'gorgeous', 'son', 'one', 'who', 'black', 'father', 'positions', 'equally', 'gorgeous', 'older', 'son', 'baseball', 'circle', 'local', 'park', 'sense', 'pride', 'eventually', 'making', 'way', 'media', 'circus', 'suburban', 'home', 'picture', '9-year', 'old', 'girl', 'tree', 'opening', 'minutes', 'are', 'full', 'beautifully', 'realised', 'vignettes', 'use', 'real', 'Bostonians', ""'tough"", 'suburbs', 'adding', 'reality', 'power', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'simply', 'stunning', 'gritty', 'reality', 'film', 'when', 'learn', 'director', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'whom', 'everyone', 'hate', ""'re"", 'more', 'impressed.But', 'then', 'course', 'mush', 'when', 'frankly', 'ludicrously', 'cherubic', 'face', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'equally', 'drippy', 'girlfriend', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'amazingly', 'dull', 'part', 'tow', ""'re"", 'leads', ""'re"", 'expected', 'believe', 'dweebs', 'Casey', 'good', 'parts', 'depth', 'others', 'worse', 'lot', 'time', 'feel', 'literally', 'going', 'burst', 'fit', 'giggles', 'moment', 'Monaghan', 'fabulous', 'expressively', 'actress', 'character', 'Angie', 'bit', 'weedy', 'therefore', 'difficult', 'care', 'Angie', 'almost', 'superfluous', 'requirements', 'was', 'more', 'fleshed', 'book', 'then', 'ask', 'why', 'did', 'top', 'quality', 'actors', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'get', 'involved', 'movie', 'answer', 'truly', 'fabulous', 'script', 'adapted', 'Aaron', 'Stockard', 'Denis', 'Lehane', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Mystic', 'River', 'territory', 'Lehane', 'worked', 'child', 'abuse', 'abduction', 'cases', 'monsters', 'families', 'so', 'well', 'observations', 'hurt', 'literally', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'excellent', 'film', 'where', 'found', 'tearful', 'not', 'always', 'grotesque', 'things', 'Miramax', 'must', 'show', 'pervs', 'ways', 'humanity', 'other', 'people', 'involved', 'emotion', 'too', 'often', 'missing', 'other', 'films', 'easy-to-exploit', 'subject', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'imbibed', 'debut', 'genuine', 'heart', 'even', 'story', 'go', 'off', 'rails', 'bit', 'end.Given', 'real', 'meat', 'work', 'large', 'varied', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'brilliant', 'right', 'even', 'smallest', 'part', 'just', 'when', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Harris', 'Freeman', 'have', 'give', 'floor', 'adding', 'gravitas', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'older', 'Affleck', 'tingling', 'Director', 'chair', 'John', 'Ashton', 'superb', 'too', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'sidekick', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'child', 'father', 'Lionel', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'big', 'surprise', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'who', 'devious', 'trailer-trash', 'druggy', 'mum', 'Helen', 'McCready', 'daughter', 'Amanda', 'girl', 'pictured', 'everywhere', 'abducted', 'hate', 'yet', 'empathise', 'equal', 'measure', 'wonder', 'Affleck', 'character', 'should', '9-year', 'old', 'girl', 'be', 'back', 'train', 'wreck', 'person', 'Helen', 'McCready', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'decision', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'print', 'surprisingly', 'bad', 'speckled', 'blurry', 'indoor', 'night', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'revelatory', 'anywhere', 'else', 'Also', '2', 'special', 'features', 'cavalierly', 'give', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'twists', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'either', 'see', 'movie', 'Also', 'note', 'David', 'Buckley', 'tenderly', 'evocative', 'music', 'many', 'down', 'up', 'scenes', 'hugely', 'powerful', 'lift.Despite', 'being', 'just', 'few', 'notches', 'short', 'places', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'superb', 'film', 'genuine', 'sleeper', '2008', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'arrived', 'Director', 'big', 'time.I', 'was', 'moved', 'confused', 'hurt', 'left', 'thinking', 'difficult', 'decisions.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

When Ben Affleck, of all people, did so for his first film as a director, he chose to film the fourth film in the series, Gone Baby Gone. 4-year-old Amanda McCready has disappeared, and her aunt brings in Patrick and Angie, who are from the neighborhood, to help with the case. It seems at first that the duo are successful at developing a lead, but readers of Lehane know that things are never what they seem on the surface in his stories. Ben Affleck does a good job in capturing the atmosphere, the complexity, and the moral ambiguity of Lehane's novel--he has more directing chops than I'd have expected.The cast is pretty good. Casey Affleck does a pretty good job as Patrick Kenzie, although he looks a little too boyish at times. Michelle Monaghan is also solid as Patrick's longtime friend and partner, and sometime lover, although she's limited by the way the script marginalizes Angie a lot of the time (the Angie of the books has a lot more fire in her). The supporting cast is excellent. Amy Ryan was, deservedly, Oscar-nominated as Helene McCready, Amanda's substance-abusing, self-absorbed mother. Also excellent are Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as Boston PD heavyweights involved in the case, Titus Welliver as Lionel, Helene's brother, and rapper Slaine in a cameo as Patrick and Angie's sociopathic friend Bubba Rogowski. I'd love to see him return as Bubba if someone were to ever film any of the other Kenzie/Gennaro novels.There is a reasonable selection of extras on the DVD release: a couple of ""making of"" featurettes, some deleted scenes and an alternate ending, and a commentary from Ben Affleck and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard.",4,A Solid Adaptation of the Lehane Novel,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,1828,"['success', 'Mystic', 'River', ""'d"", 'been', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'bring', 'author', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'working-class', 'PI', 'team', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'screen', 'When', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'people', 'did', 'so', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'chose', 'film', 'fourth', 'film', 'series', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', '4-year-old', 'Amanda', 'McCready', 'disappeared', 'aunt', 'brings', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'who', 'are', 'neighborhood', 'help', 'case', 'first', 'duo', 'are', 'successful', 'developing', 'lead', 'readers', 'Lehane', 'know', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'what', 'seem', 'surface', 'stories', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'atmosphere', 'complexity', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'Lehane', 'novel', 'more', 'directing', 'chops', ""'d"", 'have', 'expected.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'little', 'too', 'boyish', 'times', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'also', 'solid', 'Patrick', 'longtime', 'friend', 'partner', 'sometime', 'lover', 'limited', 'way', 'script', 'Angie', 'lot', 'time', 'Angie', 'books', 'lot', 'more', 'fire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'was', 'deservedly', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Helene', 'McCready', 'Amanda', 'substance-abusing', 'self-absorbed', 'mother', 'Also', 'excellent', 'are', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Boston', 'PD', 'heavyweights', 'involved', 'case', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'Lionel', 'Helene', 'brother', 'rapper', 'Slaine', 'cameo', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'sociopathic', 'friend', 'Bubba', 'Rogowski', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'return', 'Bubba', 'someone', 'were', 'ever', 'film', 'other', 'Kenzie/Gennaro', 'reasonable', 'selection', 'extras', 'DVD', 'release', 'couple', 'making', 'featurettes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'commentary', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'co-screenwriter', 'Aaron', 'Stockard']",N/A

The actors do a great job with the script and this is a strong showing for director Ben Affleck as his first film that made it to the big screen. The cinematography and the special effects enhance this movie all the more.When the action starts, we are in Dorchester, Massachusetts outside Boston. Dorchester is a tough neighborhood filled with drug problems and other types of dangerous crime; nevertheless people live there all their lives and develop relationships that truly matter. When four year old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) goes missing, the police come in fast but they don't have strong leads. The girl's Aunt Bea (Amy Madigan) and her husband Lionel McCready (Titus Welliver) enlist the help of two private detectives, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to help solve the case. Bea and Lionel believe that Amanda's mother Helene (Amy Ryan) is not able to do enough to help find her daughter because of her emotional problems, not the least of which is that Helene scarcely cares what happens to her daughter. Patrick and Angie get some information from people in the neighborhood although even knowing these people for decades still makes getting any information difficult. Patrick and Angie also come up against Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) from the police squad who is not exactly happy to have them around because they're not experienced cops.The story takes many twists and turns which adds to the suspense; and the ending isn't necessarily clear until we see it in the very final moments of this picture. Along the way you can expect a strong performance from Morgan Freeman; and Amy Ryan steals the show as Amanda's mother Helene McCready, an almost hopeless drug addict who also gets involved in dealing drugs herself. Helene has even taken her child Amanda to a drug deal or two because, as she claims, she just doesn't ""have daycare.""I must agree with the reviewers who note that this movie is very much for adults and mature audiences. There is a good deal of profanity and violence. Moreover, guns are whipped around faster than the bullets speeding out of them. Other issues raised include police corruption, child molestation and murder. It's not a Disney movie! However, don't be fooled--this is one strong movie worth owning in your collection.The DVD comes with extras; the deleted scenes are really the best of them.Overall, Gone Baby Gone presents us with a complicated thriller type of mystery that highlights the tragedy of child abduction and how it can affect so many people. The ending is good subject matter for debate; therefore for at least this one reason alone you won't forget this movie anytime soon.",5,strong and gritty--with quite an ending,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",2008,2872,"['Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'plot', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'fast', 'are', 'riveted', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'script', 'strong', 'showing', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'special', 'effects', 'enhance', 'movie', 'more.When', 'action', 'are', 'Dorchester', 'Massachusetts', 'Boston', 'Dorchester', 'tough', 'neighborhood', 'filled', 'drug', 'problems', 'other', 'types', 'dangerous', 'crime', 'nevertheless', 'people', 'live', 'there', 'lives', 'develop', 'relationships', 'truly', 'matter', 'When', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'Amanda', 'McCready', 'Madeline', ""O'Brien"", 'missing', 'police', 'come', 'fast', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'strong', 'leads', 'girl', 'Aunt', 'Bea', 'Amy', 'Madigan', 'husband', 'Lionel', 'McCready', 'Titus', 'Welliver', 'enlist', 'help', 'two', 'private', 'detectives', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'Bea', 'Lionel', 'believe', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'Helene', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'not', 'able', 'do', 'enough', 'help', 'find', 'daughter', 'emotional', 'problems', 'not', 'least', 'Helene', 'scarcely', 'what', 'daughter', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'get', 'information', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'even', 'knowing', 'people', 'decades', 'still', 'getting', 'information', 'difficult', 'Patrick', 'Angie', 'also', 'come', 'up', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'police', 'squad', 'who', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'have', 'around', ""'re"", 'not', 'experienced', 'cops.The', 'story', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'suspense', 'ending', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'clear', 'see', 'very', 'final', 'moments', 'picture', 'way', 'can', 'expect', 'strong', 'performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'show', 'Amanda', 'mother', 'Helene', 'McCready', 'almost', 'hopeless', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'also', 'involved', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'Helene', 'even', 'taken', 'child', 'Amanda', 'drug', 'deal', 'two', 'because', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'daycare', 'must', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'who', 'note', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'adults', 'mature', 'audiences', 'good', 'deal', 'profanity', 'violence', 'Moreover', 'guns', 'are', 'whipped', 'faster', 'bullets', 'speeding', 'Other', 'issues', 'raised', 'include', 'police', 'corruption', 'child', 'molestation', 'murder', 'not', 'Disney', 'movie', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'one', 'strong', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'collection.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'them.Overall', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'complicated', 'thriller', 'type', 'mystery', 'tragedy', 'child', 'abduction', 'how', 'can', 'affect', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'ending', 'good', 'subject', 'matter', 'debate', 'therefore', 'least', 'one', 'reason', 'alone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'movie', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

He regained a bit of his credibilaty as a good actor with last years Hollywoodland. While not a 'great' film, he gave one of his best performences in years and gained back a lot of respect from me. Now, with his directorial debut with Gone Baby Gone, he has fully recovered from his bad run and is once again a power player in Hollywood.This film, based on the fourth book of a series, tells of two private detectives who are called in to further investigate the mysterious dissapearence of a young girl, who's mom seems to be more interested in partying then actually taking care of the kid. Assisted by two other cops, they began to delve into the case that soon becomes obvious that there is more going on then they thought.Now, in essence, the above synopsis is not what the entire film is about. More like, its sort of like the first half of the film, the rest of which I cannot say or risk giving away to much.Both Affleck brothers do superb jobs, with Ben's refined directing and really tight screenplay and Casey giving yet another great performance after The Assasination of Jesse James. Everyone in the film does great in their roles, Amy Ryan being another standout, who makes the most of her limited screen time. And, though I don't come from Boston, I will give it to Ben for being able to capture as much of the essence of the city as possible.By far, the best part in the film is the ending. It really just takes you by surprise, how unexpected the end is. And, not only that, but it is very real, which makes it even more gut wrenching to watch.So either you love or hate Ben Affleck, this is definently a film you have to see.",5,A Very Entertaining Film,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,1750,"['string', 'bad', 'movies', 'Gigli', 'anyone', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'needed', 'something', 'boost', 'faltering', 'career', 'regained', 'bit', 'credibilaty', 'good', 'actor', 'last', 'years', 'Hollywoodland', 'not', ""'great"", 'film', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performences', 'years', 'gained', 'back', 'lot', 'respect', 'Now', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'fully', 'recovered', 'bad', 'run', 'once', 'again', 'power', 'player', 'Hollywood.This', 'film', 'based', 'fourth', 'book', 'series', 'tells', 'two', 'private', 'detectives', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'further', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'dissapearence', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'mom', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'partying', 'then', 'actually', 'taking', 'care', 'kid', 'Assisted', 'two', 'other', 'cops', 'began', 'delve', 'case', 'soon', 'obvious', 'more', 'going', 'then', 'thought.Now', 'essence', 'above', 'synopsis', 'not', 'what', 'entire', 'film', 'about', 'More', 'sort', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'rest', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'risk', 'giving', 'away', 'much.Both', 'Affleck', 'brothers', 'do', 'superb', 'jobs', 'Ben', 'refined', 'directing', 'really', 'tight', 'screenplay', 'Casey', 'giving', 'yet', 'great', 'performance', 'Assasination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Everyone', 'film', 'great', 'roles', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'being', 'standout', 'who', 'most', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'Boston', 'will', 'give', 'Ben', 'being', 'able', 'capture', 'much', 'essence', 'city', 'possible.By', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'ending', 'really', 'just', 'surprise', 'how', 'unexpected', 'end', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'real', 'even', 'more', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'watch.So', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'definently', 'film', 'have', 'see']",N/A
1128550,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B0010ZR160,Mel Odom,"[5, 7]","I've been a fan of Dennis Lehane's private eye novels about Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro for years.  I keep wishing Lehane would write another book about them.  Instead, he's written a couple of stand-alone books that have become a movie (MYSTIC RIVER) and one that will become a movie (SHUTTER ISLAND).GONE, BABY, GONE stands out not only as the first Kenzie/Gennaro book to become a film, but is also Ben Affleck's first turn as a director.  His brother Casey (THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD) stars as Patrick Kenzie.Both the Afflecks grew up in Boston, and the choice to use Lehane's background for the series, Dorchester, was a no-brainer.  Ben Affleck, when drawn to the project, stated that he wanted to make that microcosm of Boston come to life on the screen, and he used several people from the neighborhood in roles.  In my opinion, he succeeds admirably.  The background has a unique feel and rhythm to it that he couldn't have gotten while shooting somewhere else.Another thing that really rings too is the language.  The dialogue is coarse and explosive, the way it tends to be in crowded metropolitan areas.  And no matter where you put them, areas of cities that are in disrepair always stand out and offer their own views of the world.  It doesn't matter if it's a small town or a large town, people tend to be desperate, trapped, and unhappy while living there.  Since they're not strong enough, mobile enough, or brave enough to take on people outside their neighborhood, the bad ones tend to prey on people inside the local environment.I liked the motivation for Patrick and Angie to get involved, the fact that Patrick knew the mother whose child was kidnapped.  They'd gone to high school together, and no one gets out of high school without a history and usually scars to show for it.  Angie is reluctant to get involved with the case because she doesn't want to find a dead kid, which is how things like this normally work out.If you've only watched the movie, you should really read the book as well.  Patrick and Angie's relationship means a lot to the book series, and in particular to this novel.  The movie can't pull in all the history or the emotional angst that is in the pages of the novel.  There's just not enough room.Patrick's investigation immediately puts him in harm's way of the police and the bad guys - which is exactly how a private eye story should operate.  The PI is always the man or woman outside of the world that needs to be investigated.  In this case, Patrick belongs to that world but he's stepped outside certain aspects of it.Although I knew the story and what was going to happen, it was great seeing Ben Affleck's vision of it and Casey Affleck's portrayal of Patrick.  The city seems almost to close in on the viewer, especially during the scenes where Bubba leads Patrick to the house where the kidnapped boy is being held by drug addicts and a child molester.Ed Harris turns in a fantastic performance as Remy Bressard.  I love watching Harris work anyway, but seeing him in this role was a pleasure.  Morgan Freeman, solid as ever, wasn't given too much to do, but he always shines.  Michelle Monaghan plays Angie Gennaro, but the focus is so much on Patrick that she almost gets eclipsed in everything.  She's so strong, though, that she seizes moments and makes them her own.I really enjoyed this film.  I liked the look and the pacing, though some people may find it a little slow in places.  I was just glad to see this world come to life, and I think Ben Affleck did a marvelous job of doing that.

I liked Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Patrick and Angie.  Although I pictured them to be a bit older, I thought the actors did a fine job.  The direction by Ben Affleck is wonderful.  The movie did a very good job in following the book, although it was like reading a Cliff's Notes version.I only have two complaints.  First, Angie's character is almost non-existent.

Moore,"[1, 1]","Following in the bloody footsteps of ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed,"" Ben Affleck's ""Gone Baby Gone,"" yet another gritty crime drama from the mean streets of South Boston, is as briliantly depressing a moral vision as has ever been put on screen. Of the three films mentioned here, ""Gone Baby Gone"" may be the most sobering, and also quite possibly the best (which is saying something in both cases). Co-writing a screenplay based on a novel by ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane, Affleck directs his brother Casey in the role of Patrick Kenzie, a private eye born and bred in Southie who takes on the case of a four-year-old girl missing from the neighborhood. Working with his soft-hearted girlfriend-partner, Angie (Michelle Monaghan), Kenzie in his investigation encounters the girl's pathetic junkie mother (Amy Ryan), whose known criminal associates comprise a rogue's gallery of potential suspects; a detective (Ed Harris) transplanted from New Orleans who has definite opinions on a cop's moral imperatives; and the guilt-ridden chief of the missing children's bureau (Morgan Freeman). With a sharpness and confidence belying his status as a first-time director, Affleck leads us through some of the most harrowing sequences in recent cinematic memory to a final moral dilemma which you won't see coming until it smacks you right in the face. Only one of the choices is truly moral, the screenplay tells us, but choosing it means despair and heartbreak for everyone involved. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is highly unusual for a mainstream movie in its emotional maturity and its dead-serious consideration of basic questions of morality and personal responsibility. Affleck keeps the audience on edge throughout the movie's running time, and the performances he gets from his cast could not be improved in any way. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a film that is certain to be remembered at Oscar time, and in the years to come to make the short list of Everyone's Favorite Depressing Movies.",5,Another punch in the gut from Boston.,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,1979,"['Following', 'bloody', 'footsteps', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Departed', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'yet', 'gritty', 'crime', 'drama', 'mean', 'streets', 'South', 'Boston', 'as', 'briliantly', 'depressing', 'moral', 'vision', 'ever', 'been', 'put', 'screen', 'three', 'films', 'mentioned', 'here', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'sobering', 'also', 'quite', 'possibly', 'best', 'saying', 'something', 'cases', 'Co-writing', 'screenplay', 'based', 'novel', 'Mystic', 'River', 'author', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'Affleck', 'brother', 'Casey', 'role', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'private', 'eye', 'born', 'bred', 'Southie', 'who', 'case', 'four-year-old', 'girl', 'missing', 'neighborhood', 'Working', 'soft-hearted', 'girlfriend-partner', 'Angie', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'Kenzie', 'investigation', 'girl', 'pathetic', 'junkie', 'mother', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'known', 'criminal', 'associates', 'comprise', 'rogue', 'gallery', 'potential', 'suspects', 'detective', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'transplanted', 'New', 'Orleans', 'who', 'definite', 'opinions', 'cop', 'moral', 'imperatives', 'guilt-ridden', 'chief', 'missing', 'children', 'bureau', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'sharpness', 'confidence', 'belying', 'status', 'first-time', 'director', 'Affleck', 'most', 'harrowing', 'sequences', 'recent', 'cinematic', 'memory', 'final', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'right', 'face', 'Only', 'one', 'choices', 'truly', 'moral', 'screenplay', 'choosing', 'despair', 'heartbreak', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'highly', 'unusual', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'dead-serious', 'consideration', 'basic', 'questions', 'morality', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'Affleck', 'audience', 'edge', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'performances', 'cast', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'improved', 'way', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'film', 'certain', 'be', 'remembered', 'Oscar', 'time', 'years', 'come', 'make', 'short', 'list', 'Everyone', 'Favorite', 'Depressing', 'Movies']",N/A

When a young girl disappears from her neglectful mother's Boston home, the girl's concerned aunt and uncle hire Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck), a private investigator, to augment the police's investigation. Police Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) heads a unit specializing in crimes against children. The detectives on the case, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and partner Nick, suspect a child molester of the kidnapping. But Patrick and his partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan) dig up information on the child's mother, Helene MacCready (Amy Ryan), that leads in a different direction.First-time director and Boston native Ben Affleck emphasizes authenticity and the culture of the working-class Dorchester neighborhood where the action unfolds. Realism and sense of place are where this film excels, including Amy Ryan's terrific portrayal of a common trashy mother too caught up in her own whims to care much about her daughter. My limited experience with Dennis Lehane's work has led me to associate the author with self-righteousness and plots that hinge on far-fetched behavior. ""Gone Baby Gone"" is no exception. It's preachy. Characters do ridiculous things that I don't really buy. Even so, there are points at which the film becomes a thoughtful meditation on what constitutes right and wrong. It's an entertaining, occasionally insightful thriller.The DVD (Miramax 2008): There are 6 extended or deleted scenes with optional commentary, 2 featurettes, and a feature commentary. ""Going Home: Behind the Scenes with Ben Affleck"" (7 min) interviews the director, cast, and producer Sean Bailey about Affleck's directing and the film's themes. In ""Capturing Authenticity: Casting Gone Baby Gone"" (9 min), Affleck and the cast talk about the characters and the importance of using locations and people from Dorchester. The feature commentary by director and co-screenwriter Ben Affleck and screenwriter Aaron Stockard provides scene-by-scene comments on adapting the book, sets, dialogue, characters, story, and shooting.

Set in the seedier and grittier parts of Boston, the tale revolves around a missing girl. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play the private detectives who are requested by relatives to help the search, and the beginning of the movie introduces us to a milieu which shows an unforgiving background for bringing up the child. The characters we meet include pimps, hard-assed barmen, mules (drug runners), dubious cops and various other dregs of society.What is remarkable about the movie is how convincing is the air of authenticity of the neighbourhoods and houses. It all feels horribly real. And not least the characters, who all have their flaws as well as their streaks of humanity. Be warned, the language, particularly in the first third of the movie, is full of intense profanity which may put some off, but is certainly in keeping with the locales and personalities.The story is gripping and extremely hard-hitting, this is certainly no Hollywood 'hero to the rescue' type film. It very realistically portrays all the emotions those involved in a case like this must go through, as well as the unpleasant circles they have to enter in order to find answers. The only problem is that this intensity sometimes gets lost in a storyline that seems unnecessarily complex and, at times, confusing. It's the sort of film where you very much have to concentrate or you'll soon lose the story thread, and considering the high emotions the film tackles, adding such a demanding storyline does leave you feeling a little exhausted.Nonetheless the film has some very emotive drama and some very powerful performances.

Casey Affleck is a better actor than his big brother, but I was never really convinced by his performance here.

I will be the first to say I was surprised at the deftness with which he orchestrated the entire cast.I was, however, unable to make out what Casey Affleck, Ben's brother in the lead role of Patrick Kenzie, was saying 80% of the time.  I had to give up and use the subtitles after the first twenty minutes passed.  His massacred vocal intonations sounded like they were coming from underwater--and from an oral cavity stuffed with several dozen ball bearings.Still, despite his inconveniently inarticulate manner of talking, Kenzie's character was well-drawn overall.  One could easily believe this ""old soul"" in a young body was actually committed to behaving honorably and nobly in a plotline jammed with deceitful and dishonest individuals.  However, I am certain that in ""real"" life he would have been stabbed, shot, pushed into a quarry gorge, run over, and/or (at the very least) pistol-whipped by any number of the low-lifes Kenzie encountered in the course of the plot.  But the canny Mr. Kenzie slips past them all with only a brief interlude of actual mano-a-mano action (and of course he strides away from it, utterly unscathed and gloriously vindicated).Michelle Monaghan's Angie Gennaro was banal and insipid.  Whining early on that she ""didn't want to find a dead little girl's body"" struck a particularly incongruous note--she and her boyfriend/business partner were investigating A KIDNAPPING.  It would have been highly unlikely they were going to locate Amanda hosting a covert tea party in a local park with several of her favorite dolls.  And the very end of the film--when Patrick has to make what can only be described as a monstrously difficult moral decision--her words of ""support"" are ""If you do this I will hate you"".Fun.  Her entire presence in this movie was completely unnecessary.  Or perhaps if an actress with more potential had played the role, she wouldn't have come across as so completely unlikeable and bothersome.  And what was up with the feathered Farrah Fawcett hair Angie was sporting?  This wasn't a period piece set in 1982...The REAL breakaway talent of ""Gone"" was Amy Ryan, who took on the role of Helene McCready, mother of the missing girl. Helene is a trashy, self-centered, drug-addled disaster, and Amy plays the role with a brilliant honesty which has the viewer alternately loathing her severe deficiencies as a mother and a human being in general and simply pitying her self-destructive lifestyle.

But Ben Affleck is no Clint Eastwood, and brother Casey is no Sean Penn.There may be roles to which Casey Affleck can bring credibility - I'm not familiar with his work - but this is not one of them.  There wasn't a moment I could take him seriously: the role called for someone I could believe had the toughness and experience to negotiate Boston's mean streets; someone who could hold the stage with Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. But Mr. Affleck comes off as a boy in a man's world. (The voice-overs he is called upon to deliver are especially embarrassing - with a better voice and 20 more years under his belt, he might have pulled them off.) The writers do what they can to give him weight.  At one point, fairy early on, Mr. Affleck meets Ed Harris and his partner in a local dive and drops a tidbit of of information on the two detectives, who clearly have been less than enthused with having to include him in their investigation. Without so much as asking Mr. Affleck the basis of his information, the two detectives are off to follow up on it, leaving one to wonder how exactly, between his entrance and the detectives' exit, Mr. Affleck acquired such credibility.The plot is too clever by half. There were three, perhaps four, points in the film where I thought I was a minute or two from seeing the final credits roll (and, increasingly, was hoping to see them roll).  ""But wait,"" as infomercial hucksters love to say, ""there's more!"" And the film chugged on, propelled by yet another plot twist. The final one is preposterous: Mr. Freeman's character would have understood how impractical, how doomed to fail, how personally foolish is the course of action the writers foist on him.The minor roles are filled with competent character actors, but many are so familiar from other roles that I was always aware, despite their skill, that I was watching a group of actors at work, when I should have been transported to the film's world. Michelle Monaghan, as Mr. Affleck's wife, barely registers. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris are always watchable, but the former - in a role we've seen him play many times before - gets relatively little screen time, and the latter succumbs, literally, to plot contrivance.  (SPOILER ALERT!  Shot twice through the chest - we see on his shirt where the bullets exit - Mr. Harris not only manages to quickly hoof it about a quarter-mile, he manages to make his way to the roof of a building of several stories, there to recline dramatically against a skylight for his final words with Mr. Affleck, which he manages to deliver without either coughing or exhaling blood.  It makes one wonder just what he expired from, given the fact the two bullets that passed through his chest missed, apparently, both his heart and lungs.)I was pleased to see two cast members of the HBO series The Wire (the best series on TV, hands down) at work here.  Michael K. Williams appears in a minuscule role; Amy Ryan, as the missing child's druggie mother, turns in the film's best performance. It's unfortunate this film didn't borrow more from that series than just two of its cast.

Choosing either way will have bad consequences: the chooser is aware of this. He also knows that there is nothing to be gained by shrugging the whole thing off: choosing not to choose is the same as choosing ""A"".This is what is properly known as a ""dilemma"".It is also a moral dilemma such as it is rarely encountered in movies. This film is not only very well made and acted, but it has a moral depth that transcends entertainment. It is a lesson on the equivocal, slippery nature of life.The setting is a rough working-class neighborhood in South Boston. It is a place where, in normal conversation, the ""f"" word and its various derivatives pop up after just about every other word. There are lots of drugs and crime. This is shown mostly in a low-key, but relentless, unflinching way.In younger days, as a poor student renting cheap quarters, I did live in a neighborhood somewhat like that, although there was less crime - at least free-floating, disorganized crime -- and less drugs.

Maybe it was because Ben Affleck directing his brother Casey, thought it would work. It was more annoying and distracting instead of adding to the movie.Michelle Monaghan didn't play a very important or effective part. Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, was perfect as the ""doper"" and irresponsible mother who got her child back. Ed Harris as Detective Remy Bressant, was very convincing as the main cop and co-conspirator of the kidnapping.  Morgan Freeman the mastermind and self-proclaimed ""saviour"" of the child of Helene McCready played a minor part until the very end.I'm glad this didn't turn out to be a movie that I'd need a calculator to rack up the body count. Although there was considerable amount of victims adding up (related and unrelated) after the initial kidnapping.And in the end, when Casey's character Patrick Kenzie has Morgan Freeman and the others arrested for kidnapping because ""it was the right thing to do,"" he himself goes ""Scot-free"" after murdering (read Executing) a child molester and killer that the cops helped coverup since he tried to save the life of a cop shot at the very same crime scene. This self-righteous ending just didn't play into the message he wanted to convey. Sure, no one was going to miss the child molester/killer, but his summary execution was in step with that old saying of ""the lesser of two evils.""

1128580,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B0010ZR160,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[7, 11]","The movie begins with a sappy voice over from the male lead ( Ben Affleck's little brother Casey ), Describing the toughness of the people from his Boston neighborhood, with the same drippy sentiment that Tim Daily describes the life of islanders off the coast of Maine, in The Stephen King mini-series "" The Storm of the Century"". As the camera eventually settles in on the gathering of neighbors, cops, and press, we discover the root of the story, a four year old girl has been abducted. Out of the infinite number of possible directions this film could of gone on from here, the twisted path it eventually chose is not one I would of imagined or concidered. The first monkey wrench tossed into the gears is the introduction to the lead character and his live in girl friend, Private detective Patrick Kenzie ( Affleck ), and Angie Gennaro ( Michelle Monaghan ). For starters, Casey Affleck looks like William Peterson, and John Pankow from ""To Live and Die in L.A."" had a baby. Added to this, his voice sounds like he has a rather stuffy head cold. He does not strike me as leading male material. Then there is the way that his character is drawn out. He is so cock sure of himself, that he can verbally threaten and insult a Haitian drug lord in the drug lord's own home, and stair down the agitated Haitians locked and loaded 9MM without so much as blinking. I have heard that Boston folk can be a tough sort, but the unflinching way in which he handles these life and death situations, and the actual life and death situations themselves stuck as far too macho to be real.I can and will acknowledge that there is some rather fun and thrilling moments to be had in this film. For starters I thought that The Academy of Motion Pictures Sciences were dead right in nominating Amy Ryan for an Oscar for bad parent Helena McCready, but not letting her win. She had some rather racey dialog and solid scenes, and did outshine her costars in this film with her treatment of her collorful material, but I did not think it warrented actually winning the trophy. I also found the shootout between the hero and the elder crack head couple The Trett's and their live in pedophile friend Corwin Earle ( Matthew Maher ), to be pretty nail biting. Unfortunately, it is when this film passes this point that my interest gets put to an endurance test. It is as if someone took two seperate films and tried to stick them together in the middle, and quite frankly, I had plenty of problem with the premise of this film, which is what the second half is all about."" You need a licence to drive a car, you need a licence to catch a fish, but the will let any *bleeping bleepidy bleep* be a parent.""Sorry to have to let the cat out of the bag and spoil the ending, but the whole premise of this film is faulty at best. We are suppose to buy the notion that just because someone is a lousy parent who neglects a really cute child, that it would inspire an uncle, and a group of high level police officers to cook up some elaborite scheme to abduct the child themselves. All so it could be raised by a member of their group who once lost a child, and thus would not take this poorly mothered cutey for granted. To make this scheme even more hair brained, they would attept to hide their envolvement in her abduction by trying to fake the childs death. In order to do so they would also get into a staged gun battle with The Haitian drug lord at night and in the woods, so that the staged witnesses would only sort of see what transpired. More preposterous still, is that they now have to have transcripts and other documents forged, a self firing of the lead abductor and new parent set up, and even go so far as to have a staged armed robbery. When you add in the fact that the press is all over this case, it makes the entire premise to the story completely asinine. Now, the obvious question is, what is Capt. Doyle ( Morgan Freeman ) going to do with this child? He can't enroll her in school. Hell, he can't even take her outside in public because of the off chance that the child would be recognized. So again I ask, What is Morgan Freeman going to do with this abducted child? I can only guess that he has to keep her locked in the basement of his house like the proud parent of a circus freak.Near the end of the film, we have the big show down speech between Casey Affleck and Morgan Freeman, but whatever meaning that was suppose to be involved in this wrap up is now completely lost on me, mainly because my mind is too logical to buy any of it. The film ends with cute little Amanda's mommy once again doing what a good crack-ho does and leaving her tyke for Casey Affleck to watch. He of course looks at little Amanda with the same longing and sadness that Morgan Freeman did signifying that not only does he now understand Morgan's inner pain, but he himself could be capable of abducting this child, just to give it a better life.Being that I am the age I am, and have become realistically dissipated by people and life events, I.E. Jaded, I found myself wanting to shout out at how blatantly stupid I found these child lovers to be. In what way would it possibly help this child to be abducted and kept in hiding for years until her appearance changed and the public forgot? That hardly seems like a vast improvement on her current life situation, and if caught, the consequences for the abductors seem hardly worth the risk. Secondly, sure little Amanda is cute now, but just wait a few years. She is probably destined to become a skank herself, with or without the abduction. Ultimately this is a film you should rent first to see if you like it enough to own, because if you are at all like me, you will be turning your copy in for trade or dropping it off at your local

Of particular note was the first bar scene where Casey's character is interviewing an old class mate about the case and the local hooligan bar patrons decide to start a throw down.  The suspense is immense, especially if like me you view it as the old school yard bully against the little guy with spunk.  I heard myself say ""YES"" as my anti-hero pulls out a Glock...sweet, take that you crap head.  My adrenalin was flowing after that exchange, which came as a surprise to me.  I don't usually get so involved in a film that my physical life sign stats peak.  The story line has the typical twists and turns with no moral right or wrong answer throughout.  Our anti-hero simply has to go with his gut and call it based on his experience growing up in the neighborhood.  No matter what his decision there is always a cost that weighs heavily on his soul.  As Gitano said, Ben Affleck's direction was excellent.  After watching the special features I find out why he did so well.  Ben and Casey grew up in this area of Boston and were quite comfortable acting and directing with the real people of the area.  Ben made sure he used the real folks in the movie.  The street dwellers, the cops, even the bar room hooligans were all locals.  They delivered their lines and acted as naturally as they would every day.

Michelle Monaghan was in the movie just so there was a pretty girl on screen occasionally. The back of the DVD acclaims Morgan Freeman's performance, but it only does so to mention he's in the movie so you'll have another reason to want to see it. His part is minor and he is good as always, but it is too small of a part to base your decision on. But there was some good acting among all this.Amy Ryan was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role as the missing child's uncooperative mother. She was great, and her performance is worth seeing if you like to catch up on the Oscar nods.Maybe my fanboy bias will come through a little here, but I can't help it; I am a big Ed Harris fan. He shares a lot of scenes with Casey, which helped neutralize how ridiculous the young Affleck was at times. He does good work, but Amy Ryan is still your star.The story is almost classic pulp in the way it had some over-the-top dialogue and a quickened pace. It moves along very fluidly and I never had that ""check my watch and see how much is left"" itch.Another thing I should mention - and I wish I had links to support this - is Ben Affleck's directorial debut. I have heard/read many reviews of this movie that say that Ben has shown on which side of the camera he belongs (my apologies for not being able to give credit to the originator of that comment). I'm afraid that is more of a jab at his much maligned career on-screen rather than praise for his successful first-attempt at directing, however. But for whatever little it's worth, I thought he added to the feel of the movie, especially with the shots of the Boston neighborhoods that reminded me of what Spike Lee did for New York inClockers(and pretty much every other movie he's made).Gone Baby Gone was a great story and one that leaves watchers tangled up in the same moral dilemmas the characters faced. I enjoyed the puzzles the plot created and how they were put together. Some performances weren't the best, but Amy Ryan was very deserving of the Oscar nomination she received for this part and maybe you should see it just to judge for yourself if she should have won, if nothing else.",5,"A little over the top, but still very good.",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2810,"['When', 'young', 'girl', 'taken', 'home', 'broad', 'daylight', 'young', 'private', 'detective', 'only', 'defense', 'child-kidnapping', 'statistics', 'get', 'alive', 'must', 'be', 'found', 'almost', 'immediately', 'clock', 'already', 'been', 'ticking', 'detective', 'unlikely', 'toughguy', 'getting', 'little', 'help', 'police', 'help', 'girl', 'mother', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'many', 'physical', 'moral', 'conflicts', 'find', 'her.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'liked', 'story', 'not', 'acting', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'was', 'very', 'unbelievable', 'hard-nosed', 'private', 'detective', 'who', 'pushed', 'limits', 'get', 'answers', 'wanted', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'was', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'there', 'was', 'pretty', 'girl', 'screen', 'occasionally', 'back', 'DVD', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'performance', 'only', 'so', 'mention', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'reason', 'want', 'see', 'part', 'minor', 'good', 'always', 'too', 'small', 'part', 'base', 'decision', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'this.Amy', 'Ryan', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'missing', 'child', 'uncooperative', 'mother', 'was', 'great', 'performance', 'worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'catch', 'up', 'Oscar', 'nods.Maybe', 'fanboy', 'bias', 'will', 'come', 'little', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'am', 'big', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'fan', 'shares', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Casey', 'helped', 'neutralize', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'young', 'Affleck', 'was', 'times', 'good', 'work', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'still', 'star.The', 'story', 'almost', 'classic', 'pulp', 'way', 'had', 'over-the-top', 'dialogue', 'quickened', 'pace', 'along', 'very', 'fluidly', 'never', 'had', 'check', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'left', 'itch.Another', 'thing', 'should', 'mention', 'wish', 'had', 'links', 'support', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'directorial', 'debut', 'have', 'heard/read', 'many', 'reviews', 'movie', 'say', 'Ben', 'shown', 'side', 'camera', 'apologies', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'give', 'credit', 'originator', 'comment', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'more', 'jab', 'much', 'maligned', 'career', 'on-screen', 'rather', 'praise', 'successful', 'first-attempt', 'directing', 'however', 'little', 'worth', 'thought', 'added', 'feel', 'movie', 'especially', 'shots', 'Boston', 'neighborhoods', 'reminded', 'what', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'did', 'New', 'York', 'inClockers', 'pretty', 'much', 'other', 'movie', 'made', '.Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'was', 'great', 'story', 'one', 'watchers', 'tangled', 'up', 'same', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'characters', 'faced', 'enjoyed', 'puzzles', 'plot', 'created', 'how', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'best', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'was', 'very', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'received', 'part', 'maybe', 'should', 'see', 'just', 'judge', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A

Well, I should have listened to my gut. These Southie movies are becoming a genre of their own, and as a person of Irish descent, I can say most of them are none too flattering. 80% of the characters seem to be either alcoholics/addicts, criminals, pedophiles, or some other pitiful degenerate. GBG is certainly no different, in fact it was one of the worst that I have seen in this regard. Is Boston really like this? I don't know, but I'm sure the city of Boston's tourism department is having fits after watching this film. As an Irishman, I was actually embarassed, and at times disgusted, watching this film and I think I now know how the Italians and Blacks must feel. Oh, I almost forgot about the actual plot and the acting. Casey Affleck is a private detective hired to find a missing two year old girl. The girl's mother qualifies for worst mother of the year award, and Affleck has to scour the underbelly of South Boston in his search for the girl. I actually like Casey Affleck as an actor, I thought he should have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Bob Ford inThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Fordbut neither he, nor Ed Harris or Morgan Freeman is enough to save this unholy mess.

He delivers the role of a young detective with amazing conviction. He is shown as a young man named Patrick living in some Boston hood with his girlfriend (who is also his partner as detective). He looks younger than his age and isn't too big physically (so people don't take him seriously at first), but has enough courage, toughness and wisdom that is required by his job. Inspite of living in an environment riddled with problems, hostility, drug abuse etc, he has maintained high moral values. And it is this morality and its ambiguity that the movie focuses on. When a little girl in the neighborhood goes missing, Patrick is asked by the girl's aunt to look for her. What follows next is a great combination of suspense, crime and drama, with quite a few clever twists in the plot. When the movie ends, you are left thinking about the fine line that sometimes separates the right and the wrong.The direction is top-notch and so is the script, and Ben Affleck deserves the credit. When I started watching the movie, I had no idea it will be this good, especially having seen Ben Affleck in some pointless movies. But as it turns out, he is much more talented behind the camera than in front of it. Among the actors, as I mentioned earlier, Casey Affleck is a revelation. Amy Ryan, playing the little girl's irresponsible and drug addict mother, is excellent in her role. However I feel that Morgan Freeman is wasted and didn't have a lot to do in this movie.

When I did find out who had the little girl I was shocked.  It was completely unethical of the cop to do what he did.  But there is a difference between what is ethical or not and what is right or wrong.  Was it ethical that the cop had the little girl?  No it was not ethical, but I thought it was right that he had the little girl.  He was giving her a better life with his family.  The mother was a drug addict, how was she going to give the little girl a normal and healthy life.  It would be nice to see a sequel to see how the little girl ended up and if the mother continued with her drug use.  There is a fine line between ethics and right and wrong.

We are also introduced to Casey Affleck, Ben's younger brother who is making his mark on the big screen.  Story is set to the event of the young child's adbuction.  Child's mother is a shady character, addict who occasionally serves as a mule to a local drug lord.  It seems that their unresolved differences are the main cause for little girl's disappearance.  Film is a great showcase for the underclass of the unfortunates one is familair with not only in Boston area but anywhere else in US.

This being the beginning of his directoral career is what the title of my short review is referring to. Child abduction and abuse is such a dark and depressing subject, and that is captured very well in this film. Casey Affleck was also great. I'm glad his big brother gave him a shot, instead of starring in it himself. Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris and none other than Morgan Freeman top off a superb cast that is more than sufficient to make any film fanatic blush. What drives this film just as much as, if not more than, its gritty dark Boston slum setting is the power of choice that is displayed throughout.

Gennaro doesn't think it will end well--as Kenzie comments in the opening narrative, ""we handle cases for people who live on the edge--and fall through the cracks.""As they dig into the case, they realize Helene McCready, Amanda's mom, isn't precisely Mother of the Year material.  Amanda is considered the mascot at Helene's favorite bar--but she only goes in there in the daytime because it's far too violent after dark.  Helene is a drug user and occasionally acts as a mule for one of the local dealers.  Little Amanda was probably stolen because Helene and her no-account boyfriend ripped off the local drug dealer.Enter Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and his partner, Nick Poole (John Ashton).  They're assigned to help Kenzie and Gennaro by Captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman). When Bressant learns of the drug deal gone bad, he and Kenzie team up to set things right believing that if they paid back the drug dealer that he'd return little Amanda to her family.The switch goes awry and Kenzie and Gennaro realize they've been had.  Now they stand on opposite sides of a moral issue and the question posed to them threatens their future together and their individual peace of mind.Ben Affleck did an amazing job directing this thriller-morality play by Dennis Lehane. For the most part, he was spot on with his timing.  Standouts were younger brother Casey as Kenzie and of course Ed Harris as Bressart (in a reprise of his true believer type role in ""The Rock"") and Morgan Freeman as Doyle.  I genuinely believe at least two of the three of these actors should be nominated for an Academy Award for their performances.""Gone"" was a hard film to watch and it's one that will have you debating the merits of the decision with your family and friends for days to come.

He has proven to be a good screenwriter (he co-wrote this one, as well as the Oscar-winning script to GOOD WILL HUNTING), but has been prett spotty as an actor. Sometimes his choices were poor and sometimes his performances too. He is obviously very intelligent and capable...but that doesn't always come through in his performances.With GONE BABY GONE, filmed in Affleck's beloved and familiar Boston...he has established himself as an outstanding director. There aren't any fancy tricks or special-effects here. Just an understanding of how to set mood and how to give good actors space to operate.The movie (based on the novel by Dennis Lenhane, who also wrote MYSTIC RIVER) tells the story of two low-rent private eyes (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) who are hired by grieving relatives to help the police in their search for a 4 year old missing girl. The belief is that people who won't talk to the police will talk to them. This proves to be an astute assumption, as the two investigators (who are also a loving couple) quickly make headway.Regulations apparently compel the police to cooperate, so two veteran detectives (Ed Harris and John Ralston) assist the couple in their work...and vice versa. I liked the fact that there was tension between the two groups (which we certainly come to expect when we see similar scenarios in movies) but it fairly rapidly is lightened when it becomes clear that the two private eyes are actually making progress and the two cops are actually willing to act on this information and to take some risks themselves.I'm going to leave the plot there...suffice it to say that no one is quite who they appear to be. It is an intersting and surprise-packed story on the surface...and that's almost good enough...just watching the case unfold and the twists get revealed. But what earns this film an extra star is the moral and ethical tale just beneath the surface. These characters grapple with moral choices, and the movie shows over and over that our consciences and religious beliefs may be tightly held and admirably adhered to...but they can nonetheless get us into serious trouble. As viewers, we understand fairly clearly what we think everyone OUGHT to do...but we also feel the pain of internal conflict when they don't. Because we understand their internal battles. And we also feel for them when they live with the consequences of their prideful stubborness. Doing the right thing isn't cut and dried in this film at all.Pretty much everyone in the film does great work. Special mention should go to Casey Affleck, an actor that I've pretty much paid no attention to. Well, he's having a great year (with this film and THE ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES...) and he's an interesting performer. Unconventional looking and seemingly a little slow and sleepy-eyed...his character bursts forth with shocking actions and bravery. He uses bluster to get out of sticky situations...but you can also easily tell that he's probably quivering in his boots at the same time.The film isn't perfect. Michelle Monaghan's character is both underwritten and underplayed. I think this movie stretched her skills just past her breaking point. She isn't awful...but I was distracted by her lack of convincing reactions in many scenes. And a couple of brief flashback scenes go by SO quickly, and they're so important, that I think I may have missed a couple of minor points of plot developments.Quibbles aside...this is a stirring, adult, thought-provoking, well-acted, well-written and SURPRISE, well-directed thriller.

1128598,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0010ZR160,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Gone Baby Gone (Ben Affleck, 2007)My biggest fear with Gone Baby Gone, Ben Affleck's directorial debut, is that he was going to find some way, somehow, to blow the ending. What's truly impressive is that Affleck and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard flirted with the idea of blowing the ending--you can almost see it coming in the final scene--and then pull back from the brink. I have no idea whether the feint was intentional or not, but either way, it puts the finishing touch on an already impressive movie.Plot: Pat Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angela Gennaro (The Bourne Supremacy's Michelle Monaghan) are private detectives in South Boston. When a four-year-old child goes missing, her aunt (Pollock's Amy Madigan, who's been spending way too much of her time on TV these days) hires Kenzie and Gennaro to ""augment the police search"", in Kenzie's words, by talking to people who won't talk to the police. The captain (Morgan Freeman) isn't too thrilled with it, and neither are the two detectives, Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (Instinct's John Ashton), assigned as their police liaison. Everyone finds ways to work together, though the closer they get to the end of the rainbow, the more off the colors look. And it seems like every decision Kenzie makes is contrary to what Gennaro thinks he should do. Trouble cannot be far ahead in paradise.I have to say, though, despite the fact that I really did like this movie, there was one thing about it that really, really annoyed me. It's something most people who read the book probably didn't even notice. During the first meeting with the detectives in the novel, Gennaro asks if Bressant minds if she smokes. Bressant looks at her longingly and says, ""Please?"". It was cut out of the movie, of course, because smoking is eeeeeeeeeeevil and can never, ever be portrayed in a positive light. But the movie does suffer from it; the scene, in a very few words and gestures, shows us something critical that's missing from the movie (and if I tell you what it is, I'll spoil one of the big, big revelations, so I won't. Just trust me). Still, it does well enough without that component. The actors are top-notch, the script tight and fast-paced, and as the ending tells us, Affleck doesn't pull his punches, either the one in front of the camera or the one behind it.

1128602,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0010ZR160,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","Working for the first time on the opposite side of the camera, actor-turned-director Ben Affleck has delivered a solid, if imperfect, crime drama entitled ""Gone Baby Gone,"" based on the novel by Dennis Luhane.  Ben's brother, Casey, and Michelle Monaghan play a pair of missing-persons investigators hired to find a little girl who disappeared from her Boston home three days earlier.  Her mother is a foul-mouthed coke-fiend who is not very particular about the company she keeps and who seems strangely reluctant to cooperate with the authorities working to get her daughter back.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris co-star as cops whose involvement with the case grows ever more complicated as the drama unfolds.Affleck co-wrote the screenplay - his first since 1997`s ""Good Will Hunting"" - with Aaron Stockard, and together they have gone beyond the surface simplicities of the standard whodunit to probe the ethical complexities that are, for good or for ill, an integral part of law enforcement work.  As the central character, Patrick is continually confronted with the moral relativism of his actions, be it in negotiating with child abductors without police authority, shooting down an unarmed pedophile who has just murdered a child, or going after a crooked cop who reveals a legal indiscretion to him in a moment of drunken confidence.  Yet, when all the murky details of the case are finally revealed, Patrick realizes that, when it comes to doing what's ""right,"" even he has a line over which he will not cross - even if, by refusing to do so, he loses the one thing that matters the most to him in his life.  And yet there's still no guarantee that the choice he makes will be the best for all concerned in the end.  As an over-arching theme, the film also points out how difficult it is to raise children in a world in which so many adults are themselves deeply troubled and maladjusted.As director, Affleck has extracted fine performances from every member of his large cast, most notably Casey, Freeman, Harris, Amy Madigan and Amy Ryan, impressive enough to have earned an Oscar nomination for her work here.The multi-layered script occasionally defies credibility and pushes too hard to make its points, but ""Gone Baby Gone"" is at least willing to explore the ethical uncertainties of life and to honor that stance by ending on a note of ambivalence and ambiguity.

I immediately saw it was going to take place on the seamy side of Boston, among druggies and other low-lives. Since I'm more a fan of the drawing room mystery genre, I felt a big chore coming on with this film.Also, it was a challenge understanding some of the heavy Boston accents. Several of the actors here seem to have been coached to assume truly over-the-top dialects, thicker than any I've encountered among real Boston natives. This was probably done to give the movie a strikingly distinctive regional flavor. But I actually had to turn on the DVD's English subtitles for a while - until my ear got better attuned to the speech and until some of the lead actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman came on the scene. Their back-stories provided them with different upbringings and allowed them to speak a more standard Midwestern English.So again, between the unsympathetic characters and the difficult language, I initially resigned myself to watching this film through just to get my money's worth and to avoid being a quitter. But before I knew it, I found myself genuinely engrossed. Even if your usual preferred material is Agatha Christie rather than the Lehane book this is based on, I think you will also be drawn into real involvement with and appreciation of this movie.Then you'll want to go back and listen to Ben Affleck's Director's Commentary. At first sounding a little low-key and sluggish, it also soon winds up into fascinating insight. Like me, I bet you missed that wink between characters signaling unexpected complexities to the plot.""Gone Baby"" would be a good movie to view with friends, because it will probably provoke lively discussion afterwards - with your friends falling into two opposing camps, each with its reasons.

The commentary on children maintaining no value in our culture should be valid enough material to compose a meaningful story.  It is thought-provoking but in theme only.  The plot meanders.  It's twists are not intuitive.  Although the acting is well done the emphasis on integrity of Bostonian accents results in an incredibly slurred performance by most of the main cast.

My profession of choice for many years has been long-term childcare. Ben Affleck's (""Bennifer"" to you pop culture vultures! LOL!) ""Gone Baby Gone"" does involve the abduction of children. Now you may have a clearer understanding of why it affected me the way it did. I have been entrusted with the care of so many children, teens, and preteens over the years that I shudder at the thought of losing one. The lawsuits would surely wreck my finances, probably for the rest of my life.What can I say about this movie? The acting is, in a word, superb. Most of the actor's names speak for themselves - though special note must be made of Casey Affleck, the less talented of the so-called 'Affleck Boys'. He surprised the stink out of my rear with an award-worthy performance in the title role.You probably have some vague idea of the story by now: a husband/wife private investigation team are hired by a single mom to find her missing child.  These PIs are way out of their league and get on the nerves of the police as they bumble their way through clues.  Revealing anymore would truly be unfair.  Many twists and turns ensue and I can safely say it will be difficult for you, dear reader, to predict the outcome.This movie chilled me to my big-boned skeleton - quite a few shady characters turn up and many depressing events occure.

First of all, the film is beautifully shot, and there are enough overviews of Boston on clear days to enable us to savor the texture of the scuzzy lower depths in which the significant action takes place.  These depths are not all on one level either.  There's the working class streets where people try to do well, even as some are failing, and those who fail are connected to the denizens of the even lower depths of the druggies in the boonies, with the crack houses that are coming to have a generic look in American cop movies.  Clearly, there's much attention to detail in the decor and costuming of these scenes.The story opens with a child having been abducted from a working class home, and the girl's aunt, unhappy with the police effort, hires Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), his partner and girlfriend, to supplement the police effort.  Affleck (brother of Ben, who directs the movie) and Monaghan seem too pretty and well groomed to be living where they are living and having the amount of street cred that they seem to have, and the Boston accents and liberal profanity can't quite make them convincing.  The other two big names in the movie, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris as cops, inhabit their roles much more comfortably.  There are a number of plot twists and revelations that seem a bit fortuitous -- for example, an African-American cop whom we see only once, but who, we are to believe , is an old buddy of Kenzie's, provides vital information, and he seems to be in the movie only to do that.  That has to be done to set up a scene of excruciating moral choice between Kenzie  and Doyle, Morgan Freeman's character.  In this scene, it isn't clear what drives Kenzie to take the line he does, and Affleck comes off seeming weightless at his big moment.  Is it his fault, or has the script failed to provide him with adequate gravitas.  Even with a good script, though, Casey Affleck is never going to win a gravitas contest with Morgan Freeman.  However, both have their say, and enough is done to let us understand the moral discomfort we feel at the end.

They have little experience with this kind of case, but armed with local knowledge, serious courage and a dangerously evolved morality, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his partner in work and love, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) accept - and get a lot more than they bargained for. The search for Amanda risks their lives, probes the dark history of the local police department, and threatens to destroy their relationship... The most pleasantly surprising thing about Ben Affleck's directorial debut is how assured it is. It's nicely adapted, slickly shot, cleverly edited, and stokes the requisite tension right from the start. Affleck really knows how to build a tense scene. The performances he extracts from his cast are terrific, especially from kid brother Casey who proves his star turn as Robert Ford last year was no fluke. Michelle Monaghan is engaging as his conflicted partner, and Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are typically superb (despite faintly ludicrous characterizations). The plot topples over into semi-ridiculousness in Act 3, but by that stage it hardly matters: it's no longer about the story, it's about these characters, the choices they've made and must make now.

1128618,A2QR035HCPBSLC,B0010ZR160,"The B ""ahnonamis""","[4, 5]","Gone Baby Gone is the story of private investigators Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan), and Patrick's journey to learn about his own sense of right and wrong on the mean streets of Boston.The directorial debut for Ben Affleck, the film stars his younger brother Casey, as well as Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan, and Ed Harris. (Don't believe the cover--Morgan Freeman plays a limited role.) One day while watching the news in bed, the two PI's/lovers learn of a local girl in Boston being kidnapped, and watch as the mother (Amy Ryan) and her relatives plead for her return.The following day, the missing girl's uncle and aunt come to the pair, asking for their assistance in tracking down what could have happened to their niece, as Patrick has all sorts of street connections the regular police don't have. Despite the protest by Angie (she doesn't want to find a little girl dead in a dumpster), Patrick accepts the task, and the two join detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) in trying to solve the case.From there it's a series of twists and turns, false leads and false solutions, ultimately ending in a way that will completely split friends apart if you choose to discuss the final act.In terms of the actual overall plot, Gone Baby Gone isn't anything too new; it's the little things that add up. Despite the critical success of films such as The Departed and Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone is, in my opinion, the best piece of modern cinema to showcase the tension and issues between cops, criminals, and the neighborhoods they co-exist in.Ben Affleck does a surprising job in directing the film (guess we know where that duo's talent came from), and every scene seems to be filmed with care to the details, but it's never so overblown that it becomes pretentious. It's hard to judge a new director based on one film, but I think it's safe to say that Ben has a promising directorial career ahead of him if he decides he likes staying behind the camera more than standing in front of it.If I have one complaint about the film, it's that at times it becomes too preachy and too over-the-head-with-a-hammer obvious in what it's trying to accomplish. There are parts where a moral dilemna is faced by Patrick or the police with both sides being presented, but the filming and acting makes it very clear who it is we SHOULD be rooting for.My only other complaint is the sticker on the front of the DVD case which was hyping the new eye-opening extended ending. In reality, the extended ending is the theatrical ending with another sentence of dialog spoken by Patrick as the film closes. It does little to create any new realizations, and anyone with common sense can tell that what he says is what he was thinking all along.Still, Gone Baby Gone is a solid first effort by Affleck, and features a great cast of supporting actors you've never heard or seen before amidst film giants such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman. For those who like cop thrillers, Gone Baby Gone is a good movie that will likely be an enjoyable night in. If you didn't like The Departed or those ilk, though, this will do nothing to change that.CONTENT - 3.5/5The movie itself is solid enough, but I just can't help but shake the feeling that I only like it because I'm supposed to. It's enjoyable, really, but it's nothing that will be remembered when I look back months from now at my favorite movies I've watched this year. I can tell you one thing, though: years from now, college students will cite this as one of their favorites along with Donnie Darko.VIDEO - 4/5It's amazing how well they managed to fade colors and make them appear washed-out on a standard DVD disc. The entire film has the look of it like it's filmed on a low budget camera or in the 70s/80s, but it's pulled off so well that it becomes an addition to the narrative, not a deterrent.AUDIO - 3/5There's little use of surround in a film centered around dialog, but when there's background noises on the streets, they're well done. Subtract a point if you could never stand Boston accents.EXTRAS - 3/5There are two main extras: Going Home, and Capturing Authenticity. Going Home is a 20-odd minute set of talking head interviews and anecdotes with the people involved in shooting the film, as well as the author of the book. Decent enough, but for the most part it's pretty boring. Capturing Authenticity deals with the use of authentic city people in the movie, as well as the attempt to make it as authentic as possible. Solid enough, but I can't help but wish for a more fleshed out look. As for the deleted scenes... Well, I already told you my thoughts about the ""thought provoking"" extended ending.REPLAY - 3.5/5If you've seen it once, you'll never fall for the twists and revelations again. It is, however, a good film to watch with friends to spark some conversation. It's also a good way to tell if your friends are pro- or anti-kidnapping. Keep an eye on Kurt.OVERALL - 3.5/5Gone Baby Gone is a very solid debut for Director Ben Affleck, and overall an above average piece of cinema. While I don't agree with the widespread sentiment that it's one of the most thought provoking films of our generation, it is a good movie worth a watch. Possibly not one to purchase, but a rental shouldn't hurt at all.",3,"A good, but forgettable, film",1249689600,"08 8, 2009",2009,5309,"['Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'story', 'private', 'investigators',

Perhaps it is the fact that we are home to the indisputably best baseball, football and basketball teams but there is something else that intrigues the rest of the nation about Boston. Maybe it's the fact that those not from here find the accent intriguing, maybe they yearn for seafood right off of the boat or maybe its that the historic appeal of the city reminds us of our American heritage.But filmmakers now see Boston as an interesting location to highlight in films, as well. One need not think back any further than The Departed to have images of what Boston is all about: a sort of rough and tumble blue collar city with a set of characters that will never be forgotten. One might say that Boston has a way of never being gone.But what if one of Boston's own children goes missing? Does the same rough and gruff blue collar nature not care as much as suburbia? Or does Boston respond the same way as the rest of the country?Written and directed by hometown hero Ben Affleck, Gone Baby Gone, based upon a book by Dennis Lehane, is a rather decent film that focuses on a child gone missing and the resulting search and lengths that go into the case.The film stars Ben's brother Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator hired by the aunt and uncle of a young girl from Dorchester that has gone missing. Though Kenzie typically does not work these kinds of cases, he persuades his partner and love interest Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) to take on this case due to the emotional pull anyone would feel when a child goes missing.Kenzie and Gennaro are quickly brought up to speed about the case by Capt. Jack Doyle of the Boston Police Department and he grants his assurances that the PI's hired by the family to help out on this case will have the full cooperation of the Boston Police Department. The lead detective investigating the case for the BDP is Det. Remy Bressant (Ed Harris).Bressant at first seems hesitant about the entire operation that now has civilian PI's joining him in tracking down the potential kidnapper that has stolen the child. What Kenzie and Gennaro believe to have had happened is that a Haitian drug kingpin of the Boston area may have kidnapped the child due to the fact that the child's mother Helen McCready (Amy Ryan) may have scammed money from the drug dealer in a drug delivery deal gone bad.Though it seems at times that Kenzie and Gennaro are on the right track in terms of tracking down the alleged kidnapper, a series of unforeseen subsequent actions always seems to get in the way of their work.What finally comes about in terms of the resolution of the kidnapping certainly is quite unforeseen and is a well crafted and interesting twist to the rest of the story.Although the film is directed by Boston native Ben Affleck, it is unforunate that the rest of the cast at times seems to have missed the entire Boston accent. There are times when the accent seems spot on and other times in which the accent sounds nothing like what the accent of Boston truly is.The one thing that disappointed me about this film is that there seems to be a misconception that the Boston accent has an inherently built in propensity to throw in random profanities the same way as we might forget to pronounce our ""R's"" correctly. The language in the film seems to be a bit over the top and not overly necessary.Being from the Boston area, it was nice to see that a great deal of the film was in fact filmed on location and did indeed show several recongizable sites around the greater Boston area. The picture quality in this film seemed spot on and highlighted the neighborhoods depicted in the film brilliantly.Amy Ryan, who played the role of the missing girl's mother was a 2008 Nominee for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and rightfully deserved such a nomination. Ryan played the role of the oft strung out junkie mom quite well and seemed to embody the role that she was cast for nicely.Gone Baby Gone certainly is a film that warrants being watched and thanks largely due to the interesting storyline at hand is a rather riveting watch. The movie fits nicely into the premise that no matter what Bostonians might do, they always do it well.",5,Another Win For a Boston Team: The Afflecks,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",2008,4255,"['Boston', 'taken', 'life', 'own', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'are', 'home', 'indisputably', 'best', 'baseball', 'football', 'basketball', 'teams', 'something', 'else', 'rest', 'nation', 'Boston', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'not', 'here', 'find', 'accent', 'intriguing', 'maybe', 'yearn', 'seafood', 'right', 'boat', 'maybe', 'historic', 'appeal', 'city', 'American', 'heritage.But', 'filmmakers', 'now', 'see', 'Boston', 'interesting', 'location', 'highlight', 'films', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'need', 'not', 'think', 'back', 'further', 'Departed', 'have', 'images', 'what', 'Boston', 'sort', 'rough', 'tumble', 'blue', 'collar', 'city', 'set', 'characters', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'Boston', 'way', 'never', 'being', 'gone.But', 'what', 'one', 'Boston', 'own', 'children', 'missing', 'same', 'rough', 'gruff', 'blue', 'collar', 'nature', 'not', 'care', 'as', 'much', 'suburbia', 'Boston', 'respond', 'same', 'way', 'rest', 'country', 'Written', 'directed', 'hometown', 'hero', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'based', 'book', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'rather', 'decent', 'film', 'child', 'gone', 'missing', 'resulting', 'search', 'lengths', 'go', 'case.The', 'film', 'Ben', 'brother', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'private', 'investigator', 'hired', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'young', 'girl', 'Dorchester', 'gone', 'missing', 'Kenzie', 'typically', 'not', 'work', 'kinds', 'cases', 'partner', 'love', 'interest', 'Angie', 'Gennaro', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'take', 'case', 'due', 'emotional', 'pull', 'anyone', 'would', 'feel', 'when', 'child', 'missing.Kenzie', 'Gennaro', 'are', 'quickly', 'brought', 'up', 'speed', 'case', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'Doyle', 'Boston', 'Police', 'Department', 'assurances', 'PI', 'hired', 'family', 'help', 'out', 'case', 'will', 'have', 'full', 'cooperation', 'Boston', 'Police', 'Department', 'lead', 'detective', 'investigating', 'case', 'BDP', 'Det', 'Remy', 'Bressant', 'Ed', 'Harris', '.Bressant', 'first', 'hesitant', 'entire', 'operation', 'now', 'civilian', 'PI', 'joining', 'tracking', 'down', 'potential', 'kidnapper', 'stolen', 'child', 'What', 'Kenzie', 'Gennaro', 'believe', 'have', 'had', 'happened', 'Haitian', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Boston', 'area', 'may', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'due', 'fact', 'child', 'mother', 'Helen', 'McCready', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'may', 'have', 'scammed', 'money', 'drug', 'dealer', 'drug', 'delivery', 'deal', 'gone', 'times', 'Kenzie', 'Gennaro', 'are', 'right', 'track', 'terms', 'tracking', 'down', 'alleged', 'kidnapper', 'series', 'unforeseen', 'subsequent', 'actions', 'always', 'get', 'way', 'finally', 'terms', 'resolution', 'kidnapping', 'certainly', 'quite', 'unforeseen', 'well', 'crafted', 'interesting', 'twist', 'rest', 'story.Although', 'film', 'directed', 'Boston', 'native', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'unforunate', 'rest', 'cast', 'times', 'have', 'missed', 'entire', 'Boston', 'accent', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'accent', 'spot', 'other', 'times', 'accent', 'nothing', 'what', 'accent', 'Boston', 'truly', 'one', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'film', 'be', 'misconception', 'Boston', 'accent', 'inherently', 'built', 'propensity', 'throw', 'random', 'profanities', 'same', 'way', 'might', 'forget', 'pronounce', 'R', 'correctly', 'language', 'film', 'be', 'bit', 'top', 'not', 'overly', 'necessary.Being', 'Boston', 'area', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'filmed', 'location', 'did', 'indeed', 'show', 'several', 'recongizable', 'sites', 'greater', 'Boston', 'area', 'picture', 'quality', 'film', 'seemed', 'spot', 'highlighted', 'neighborhoods', 'depicted', 'film', 'brilliantly.Amy', 'Ryan', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'missing', 'girl', 'mother', 'was', '2008', 'Nominee', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'rightfully', 'deserved', 'such', 'nomination', 'Ryan', 'played', 'role', 'oft', 'strung', 'junkie', 'mom', 'quite', 'well', 'seemed', 'embody', 'role', 'was', 'cast', 'nicely.Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'certainly', 'film', 'warrants', 'being', 'watched', 'thanks', 'largely', 'due', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'hand', 'rather', 'riveting', 'watch', 'movie', 'nicely', 'premise', 'matter', 'what', 'Bostonians', 'might', 'do', 'always', 'do', 'well']",N/A

It was still okay as a movie, so it gets three stars.

What would appear to be a conventional detective drama, at first, quickly turns into a study of morality, decsions and corruption in authority.It has a three pronged story that starts with the search for a little girl that becomes abducted. After the initial investigation is concluded an interesting plot twist develops with our private investigator (Patrick Kenzie) and the police. An instance of confession on the part of an officer leads to a lingering suspicion of foul play. Further digging for the truth finally uncovers the ultimate truth. Our protagonist, played by Casey Affleck, is then left with a moral decision to make. The story unravels unsuspectingly and the surprises are far from predictable.It may first appear that Gone Baby Gone is your average run-of-the-mill detective story but it is actually a well written, thrilling and suspensful drama with a considerable amount of intrigue and plot. Casey Affleck's character is a thrill to watch. His very cool exterior but unpredicatble and even explosive nature makes him a very compelling character on screen. Amy Ryan as the cavalier drug mule mother is also a thrill to watch.

I will have to rewatch, as I didn't quite get all the plot points.Spoilers:The dilema at the end of the movie brings up the issue: Is it better for the child to stay with her neglectful drug addicted Mother in a bad part of town, or to stay with her 'kidnappers', who were trying to rescue her? Without a doubt, she would have been better off with those who actually nurtured and cared for her, and who would provide her with the things she needed. We see at the end, the Mother going off on another date, carelessly leaving the child to watch tv. The poor little girl will no longer recieve the care and love from her uncle, since he is in jail.And who does she have for friends, what is there in her life to stimulate her? I don't picture the Mother sitting down and spending a lot of time working with her so she can learn to read, or just to have fun with her.As someone from an abusive home, I have to say that, of the two options, staying with the family who had her there illegally would have been by far better for her.But the movie somehow presents it as though those were the only choices.Perhaps to highlight the fact that children are left to fend for themselves in neglectful homes, or abusive ones. No one is really looking out for them...I always think that a foster home can be just as bad as any other. I don't know what the percentages are, but looks like this little girl will grow up to be like her Mom, unless she receives some help and intervension along the way.The hero's idea that the Mother might change was pretty unrealistic.

A four year old girl is missing, and her aunt reaches out to novice Detective Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) to find the little girl.  In a meager Boston neighborhood where people don't talk to the cops, Kenzie knows the drug dealers, barflies and other seedier residents of the community that live behind a wall the police can't penetrate.  People talk to him, and the more he learns about the devastated mother, the more complicated the story becomes.Enough about the plot, because it twists and turns to a conclusion about which viewers should know little.  ""Gone Baby Gone"" is a plot-based film, a neo-noir mystery where each answer comes with two new questions.  Several times the film seems ready to close its doors, only to open a darker, uglier room and lead us to it.My greatest praise for first time director Ben Affleck concerns his casting, highlighted by Amy Ryan who seems destined to receive an Oscar nomination for her role as the worst mother seen since Million Dollar Baby.  It's no coincidence that an Eastwood movie gets a mention here, as his recent films ripple throughout ""Gone Baby Gone"".  The texture and sense of community reflect ""Mystic River"" (both novels were penned by Dennis Lehane), while the conflicted dilemma facing Patrick Kenzie plays out like the euthanasia question from Million Dollar Baby.Not since Eastwood's boxing picture has such a morally ambiguous story unfolded on screen, where questions of ""right"" and ""wrong"" are muddied by life, which rarely plays along on ethical issues.  The biggest shock for me in the film is that Ben Affleck (whose reputation is that of a New England liberal) points a finger directly at the drug culture, irresponsible parenting and sexual predators for much of the pain and suffering in this country.  There's no mention of the war or corrupt businesses or climate change; rather, Affleck holds a mirror up to the Jerry Springer underbelly of America...and shows something very ugly.",5,Watch it with a group...and then argue,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,2090,"['not', 'found', 'first', 'day', 'only', 'ten', 'percent', 'missing', 'children', 'stories', 'end', 'happily', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'day', 'three', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'missing', 'aunt', 'out', 'novice', 'Detective', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'Casey', 'Affleck', 'find', 'little', 'girl', 'meager', 'Boston', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'cops', 'Kenzie', 'drug', 'dealers', 'barflies', 'other', 'seedier', 'residents', 'community', 'live', 'wall', 'police', 'ca', ""n't"", 'penetrate', 'People', 'talk', 'more', 'devastated', 'mother', 'more', 'complicated', 'story', 'plot', 'conclusion', 'viewers', 'should', 'know', 'little', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'plot-based', 'film', 'neo-noir', 'mystery', 'where', 'answer', 'two', 'new', 'questions', 'Several', 'times', 'film', 'ready', 'close', 'doors', 'only', 'open', 'darker', 'uglier', 'room', 'lead', 'it.My', 'greatest', 'praise', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'casting', 'highlighted', 'Amy', 'Ryan', 'who', 'destined', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'worst', 'mother', 'seen', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'coincidence', 'Eastwood', 'movie', 'mention', 'here', 'recent', 'films', 'ripple', 'Gone', 'Baby', 'Gone', 'texture', 'sense', 'community', 'reflect', 'Mystic', 'River', 'novels', 'were', 'penned', 'Dennis', 'Lehane', 'conflicted', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'Patrick', 'Kenzie', 'out', 'euthanasia', 'question', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby.Not', 'Eastwood', 'boxing', 'picture', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'story', 'unfolded', 'screen', 'where', 'questions', 'right', 'wrong', 'are', 'muddied', 'life', 'rarely', 'along', 'ethical', 'issues', 'biggest', 'shock', 'film', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'reputation', 'New', 'England', 'liberal', 'finger', 'directly', 'drug', 'culture', 'irresponsible', 'parenting', 'sexual', 'predators', 'much', 'pain', 'suffering', 'country', 'mention', 'war', 'corrupt', 'businesses', 'climate', 'change', 'rather', 'Affleck', 'mirror', 'up', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'underbelly', 'America', 'something', 'very', 'ugly']",N/A

I really do not like Casey Affleck as an actor at all, and with great veteran actors like Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris being given parts that should have been more notable, made me like him even less. It starts out great with compassion and motivation in finding a missing little girl, then turns in to the usual drug laden, fowl mouth, crooked cop sludge we have all seen 1000 times over. Lots of people mentioned not being able to understand what Casey was saying throughout the film i for one surely agree. He mumbles out some so called New York type accent, so its very hard to understand what he's saying let alone the names he pronouncing throughout the film.The story does get quite interesting toward the end and its a question of pure judgment on the part of human respect and dignity. Should children be taken away from abusive or neglectful parents, well that's not for us to decide, that's why they have child services, and laws. So in this movie there is (it seems) more vigilante decisions made for the benefit of the adults, rather than the benefit of the child. The movie really never hits the nail on the head that it intends to, instead it leaves a sort of bitter taste in your mouth and your left asking, what did this all mean? Well as i said its not easily put into words because you'd just have to see it and judge for yourself.I myself thought the performances were very good, (not oscar worthy as many say), but very solid. I will also say that Affleck does have the nack for good directing, even though he's still in his amateur stages. I think The Town looks like it will probably be better than this, and be a little lighter on the subject matter. This movie just leaves to many unanswered questions, both for the movie, and the audience watching it. In other words many plot holes. There is way to much, Cheese(a person), did this, and Lyle did that, and back and forth with 100 names flying all around in a sea of sentences. By the time the movie ends your pretty confused and worn out. So all in all it makes for a good watch, but still is shaky in its stature. The moral of the story is seen but never made clear, thats up to you. Me? I would just let the law handle kidnappings and not involve private investigators. I would want to take matters into my own hands, but i know the consequences of that, which are semi-shown here.

While ""Gone Baby Gone"" certainly doesn't rise to that level, it is a worthy big screen adaptation.  Ben Affleck makes his directorial debut and not surprisingly, given his Boston roots, manages to superbly capture the people and place that is blue-collar Boston in this missing child crime drama.While there are some holes in the plot, it is the litany of stellar acting performances by Casey Affleck, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris and Titus Welliver among other, that stand out in ""Gone Baby Gone"" -- not to mention another gem by Morgan Freeman in limited screen time.  I was originally a bit skeptical about Casey Affleck, but in spite of his early 20s appearance, I thought he was exceptional as a young private eye in above his head in an abducted child case.  When Amy Ryan's daughter disappears, Affleck and his lover/partner Monaghan are hired by Adam's sister-in-law and brother to supplement the police investigation.Ryan is amazing as a drug-addicted and all but worthless mother of the missing girl Amanda.  While you hope for the safety of her daughter, Amanda, it is hard to feel much compassion for Ryan and her pathetic ways.  ""Gone Baby Gone"" is definitely worthy of viewing and will spark some heated dialogue about the right moral and ethical choices.
