I recently revisited it, and it's still funny.  Some of the 80's references are dated, but much of it is still hysterical.  It's far better than Cheech and Chong's Still Smokin' and The Corsican Brothers, a lot better.  Everyone gives pretty good performances, especially C. Thomas Howell (who plays himself, ironically enough.  He's absolutely hysterical), and Reyanldo Rey as a manager who ""employs"" Chong as a roadie.  It has a weird flow to it like most of Chong's directorial work does.  It works really well.  There's also some nice shots of California's rolling mountain ranges, something you don't see too often.  Cheech has a funny cameo, and many of the movie's songs were co-written or written by Chong himself.It ain't a masterpiece, but it's worthwhile and a lot better than its reputation.",4,Pretty damn good...,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,905,"['Critics', 'hated', 'film', 'public', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'either', 'when', 'saw', 'liked', 'lot', 'recently', 'revisited', 'still', 'funny', '80', 'references', 'are', 'dated', 'much', 'still', 'hysterical', 'far', 'better', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'Still', 'Smokin', 'Corsican', 'Brothers', 'lot', 'better', 'Everyone', 'pretty', 'good', 'performances', 'especially', 'C.', 'Thomas', 'Howell', 'who', 'ironically', 'enough', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Reyanldo', 'Rey', 'manager', 'who', 'Chong', 'roadie', 'weird', 'flow', 'most', 'Chong', 'directorial', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'also', 'nice', 'shots', 'California', 'rolling', 'mountain', 'ranges', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'often', 'Cheech', 'funny', 'cameo', 'many', 'movie', 'songs', 'were', 'co-written', 'written', 'Chong', 'himself.It', 'ai', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'worthwhile', 'lot', 'better', 'reputation']",Far Out Man

Hey, this isn't ""War And Peace"" here.I had never heard of this movie at all until I caught it on cable several years ago. It seems they did NO TV advertising or hype for this film at all.I knew nothing about it when I first watched it and I was in hysterics the entire time!I would say this easily is as good-OR BETTER-than ANY of the Cheech And Chong movies. I've seen all of those. To be honest, they're still funny but it is quite easy to tell there was allot of improvisation going on in those films. That's no hit on Cheech at all for I feel his ""Born In East LA"" is a fine film as well.When i'm in the mood for that type of humour now, I always pull out my new DVD copy of ""Far Out Man"".For the price you can't beat it. I just hope it would have received the attention that the Cheech And Chong movies did.To top it off you get to see Tommy's real-life family, another plus for somebody who's been a fan of his since about 1969.Tommy's breakfast cooking scene at the beginning of the film is simply classic Cheech & Chong type humour.I hope Tommy gets to  do another of these!!!",4,Far Out Man,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1186,"['Wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Tommy', 'actually', 'put', '2', 'cents', 'here', 'words', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'Hey', ""n't"", 'War', 'Peace', 'here.I', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'caught', 'cable', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'did', 'NO', 'TV', 'advertising', 'hype', 'film', 'all.I', 'knew', 'nothing', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'was', 'hysterics', 'entire', 'time', 'would', 'say', 'easily', 'good-OR', 'BETTER-than', 'ANY', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'be', 'honest', ""'re"", 'still', 'funny', 'quite', 'easy', 'tell', 'was', 'allot', 'improvisation', 'going', 'films', 'hit', 'Cheech', 'feel', 'Born', 'East', 'LA', 'fine', 'film', 'well.When', 'i', ""'m"", 'mood', 'type', 'humour', 'now', 'always', 'pull', 'out', 'new', 'DVD', 'copy', 'Far', 'Out', 'Man', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'just', 'hope', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'attention', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'movies', 'did.To', 'top', 'off', 'get', 'see', 'Tommy', 'real-life', 'family', 'plus', 'somebody', 'who', 'been', 'fan', '1969.Tommy', 'breakfast', 'cooking', 'scene', 'beginning', 'film', 'simply', 'classic', 'Cheech', 'Chong', 'type', 'humour.I', 'hope', 'Tommy', 'do']",Far Out Man
