The film is interesting because it is an entirely Latino effort. The cast as well as the production crew are all Latin.The film follows the life of Thomas Fuentes who finds himself in love with three women in three different cities. There is CiCi the hot blooded Miami waitress who longs to be a dancer; Lorena the Chicago lawyer who reads poetry and is uncertain of her attractiveness and Patricia the New York debutante trying to break away from her family.The plot develops when all three women show up at Thomas' home. What follows is a slapstick comedy that finds the women learning who they are and what their heritage means to them.As an empowermrnt film the movie falls short on story. The slapstick elements take over and devices like plot are forgotten, As eye candy all three women are spectacular and large parts of the last third of the film turn into a scream and jiggle fest.

The trouble is that they don't know about each other until a latino psychic guru tells them all to go after the one thing that they want.  They all end up at Tomas' home in lingerie he bought for all three of them, and the cat claws come out.  There is a beauty pageant, drug money in a car, an heiress losing her fortune for running away with her cute little pomeranian, and a pro-bono lawyer who had no idea she was beautiful or sexy until the girls need a place to stay with Tomas' overly tranquilized body.  The movie is fun, if nothing original, and I watch it every time it comes on cable.  Boasting a great soundtrack that features Christina Vidal, little sister of Lisa Vidal who plays the coolest cop on the block in this rompfest, you can't miss fun jokes on class distinction or the way three girls start out as rivals and become great friends.  So it's not rocket science.  It's enjoyable to the nth degree, and the soundtrack is to die for.  Eye candy for both sexes is what you're in for, and the idea that three women can better themselves for the mistake of being with a man who is looking for all their qualities in one woman.  It's obvious Tomas needs to keep looking and that these three girls needed him to find themselves.  Fun, witty banter and gorgeous scenery don't hurt anything either.

Or is that too frightening a thought? Either way, it's the plotline of ""Chasing Papi,"" a by-the-numbers but fairly cute comedy.Papi (Eduardo Ver&aacute;stegui) is one of those guys who oozes charm and appeal like sweat -- just walking through an airport makes women lust after him. And as many guys in his place would, he has girlfriends -- three, in fact: Patricia (Jaci Velasquez), Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez) and Cici (Sof&iacute;a Vergara), and claims to adore all three of them equally. Of course, he can't keep comic potential like that hidden.And it doesn't. His bone-headed error comes when he invites all three girls to the same town, and they find out about each other -- they run out of their rooms in matching lingerie to his home, all at the same time. Not surprisingly, when the girls find out, they're not quite as ""open-minded"" as Papi about this little love rectangle. Meanwhile, they somehow get attached to a bag of money and are being trailed by the FBI and a band of thugs.""Chasing Papi"" is such a featherlight, unabashedly cute movie that it's hard to really dislike it -- at least, it was hard for me. I wanted to dislike it, but somehow I didn't. It was cute, that's all; its biggest flaws were probably the thinness of the plot and the sometimes stereotyped characters. But it is very funny much of the time, if you can overlook those. (Plus, you'll want to see Papi's backside kicked by the very high heels that Our Heroines wear)Ver&aacute;stegui doesn't play Papi as a rat, but viewers will want to see him get what he deserves. Velasquez, Sanchez and Vergara are all cute and funny. They did spend a lot of time strutting in sexy clothing, at least they are not doing so in a crude way, but rather a sort of display of feminity. (A lot of movies could use tips from ""Chasing"" on that score)  Lisa Vidal and the two thugs were a bit flatter and less appealing.One problem is a bit of a lesson that is attached to each girl -- I felt it bogged down the plot a little to be presenting us with these. And viewers who like their comedies a bit more complex, or a bit more original, will probably not like it. I did wish that things were a bit harder to predict or figure out, because about ten minutes in I knew what was going to happen.Basically, ""Chasing Papi"" is an entertaining but unsurprising diversion -- it's about as light and floaty as cotton candy.

Thomas is a young Latino hunk who has three different girlfriends in three different cities.  When his paramours finally find out about each other, a round of customary craziness ensues.""Chasing Papi"" is an attempt to revive those old screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, but it fails on virtually every level.  It's almost impossible to believe that it took four writers to come up with a screenplay as lame as the one we have here.  Of course one doesn't expect rocket science in a film of this type, but even in a screwball comedy a fine line needs to be established between the nonsensical and the stupid - and ""Chasing Papi"" crosses over that line with alarming regularity.  It takes a certain rhythm and style to bring off humor in this vein and director Linda Mendoza fails to provide either of those qualities in this production.  She has taken a cast of attractive, undeniably talented actors and actresses and forced them to overact so atrociously that any attempt at real humor is virtually eliminated from the very outset.  ""Chasing Papi"" relies on maniacal behavior, nonstop blithering and corny reaction shots to achieve its laughs, but the laughs don't come because the effort is so transparently forced and obvious.  In fact after about 15 minutes of watching these stereotypical shenanigans, you'll find yourself yearning for some much needed wit and subtlety.

759046,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00009WVQV,Thomas M. Sipos,"[6, 8]","CHASING PAPI has good and bad points.  It puts cartoons and music to effective use, and there's some funny satire.Of course, as others have commented, the big plus is its beautiful ladies.  Men may enjoy discussing which of the three women Papi should have chosen.  Roselyn Sanchez is my personal favorite.But at least for me, this film got boring.  Perhaps because there wasn't much substance to it.  When I felt I was an hour into the film, I checked the timer and saw that only 38 minutes had gone by.  The film is only about 75 minutes long (not including credits) but it felt much longer.The jokes are tame.  Those who prefer MONTY PYTON or SOUTH PARK may not find CHASING PAPI too funny.Worse, this film suffers from what I call ""ethnic sitcom disease.""  You know, when a producer makes a show about a previously unfilmed ethnic group.  We see a (Korean, Latino, black, etc.) family, and their home is full of ethnic posters and artwork related to that ethnicity, and the jokes and wisecraks all revolve around celebrities who share that ethnicity, as though people of that ethnic group spend all their time talking about issues related to their ethnic group.CHASING PAPI feels like an ""official latin film,"" in that the filmmaker felt the need to pass along some messages about latinos.  For instance, Cici is constantly harping on how Patricia is ""ashamed to be a Latina"" because of her ""fake eyes"" (i.e., colored contact lens).  But this makes no sense, because Cici appears to dye her hair blond.  Sure, some latinas have blond hair, but some also have blue eyes.  What's the big deal?For that matter, Cici's latin accent seems overdone.  I know she's latin, but she also speaks English well.  Yet in her role, she occassionally slips into a pronounced latin accent.  And because it's only occassional, it seems unnatural to her character; as an affectation done to remind the viewer that Cici is latin.The dialogue as a whole is obvious and not too funny.

759048,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00009WVQV,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","Though too fluffy and light-weight, 'Chasing Papi' is not as awful as some opinions might suggest.  Produced by none other than 20th Century Fox, one of the major Hollywood studios, it has enough budget to create the colorful looks and joyful soundtracks.  Sadly, the film just doesn't know the right way to use three surprisingly refreshing Latina-American actresses, and that's the real problem.Well, but I think the opening chapters are awfully bumpy.  Think about this.  Thomas is dating three women at the same time; a Chicago laywer wearing glasses, a street-smart Miani cocktail waitress, and a rich, sheltered, spoiled daughter in New York.  Normally, this kind of guy cheating women, well-meaning as he thinks he is, is called Romeo, and I suppose most women would despise him, but because this Romeo, or Thomas, is so irresistible, the three women  cannot stop thinking about the possibility that SHE is the only one meant for him.  I wanna ask whoever gave the green light to this project -- are you living in the 21st century?But to be fair, that is only the introduction, and wait a while.  The real point of the film is the ad-hoc coalition to get over the embarrassing situation (like Thomas fainting and an FBI agent watching it!), which eventually develops to the friendship between them through joining in a beauty pagent or dacing on the stage.The film uses up its tricks pretty early on, and funny moments come very sporadically.  In fact, the characters, stories, and gags are all too familiar today, and look exactly dead art, like pie-throwing.  With short running time of 80 minutes, the film still looks padded out, and I didn't talk about the 'dream' sequences (including that of a chihuahua) that have nothing to do with the story.As I said, the three leading ladies Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara, and Jaci Velasquez do act with gusto, and they did admirable job for their characters always remain likeable.  And I like Roselyn Sanchez, who has curiously attractive charms like Sandra Bullock, and was the only good thing in terrible film 'Boat Trip.'  I just don't understand why Hollywood must keep on wasting them in this awful films again and again.Innocuous, fluffy, but that's not the problem.  The problem is that they could think of only hackneyed ideas to fill the 80 minutes.  And they used as many as four writers.",2,Poorly Written Script with Three Good Leading Ladies,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,2353,"['Though', 'too', 'fluffy', 'light-weight', ""'Chasing"", 'Papi', 'not', 'as', 'awful', 'opinions', 'might', 'suggest', 'Produced', 'none', 'other', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'one', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'enough', 'budget', 'create', 'colorful', 'looks', 'joyful', 'soundtracks', 'Sadly', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'know', 'right', 'way', 'use', 'three', 'surprisingly', 'refreshing', 'Latina-American', 'actresses', 'real', 'problem.Well', 'think', 'opening', 'chapters', 'are', 'awfully', 'bumpy', 'Think', 'Thomas', 'dating', 'three', 'women', 'same', 'time', 'Chicago', 'laywer', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'street-smart', 'Miani', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'rich', 'sheltered', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'New', 'York', 'Normally', 'kind', 'guy', 'cheating', 'women', 'well-meaning', 'called', 'Romeo', 'suppose', 'most', 'women', 'would', 'despise', 'Romeo', 'Thomas', 'so', 'irresistible', 'three', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'thinking', 'possibility', 'SHE', 'only', 'one', 'meant', 'wan', 'na', 'ask', 'gave', 'green', 'light', 'project', 'are', 'living', '21st', 'century', 'be', 'fair', 'only', 'introduction', 'wait', 'while', 'real', 'point', 'film', 'ad-hoc', 'coalition', 'get', 'embarrassing', 'situation', 'Thomas', 'fainting', 'FBI', 'agent', 'watching', 'eventually', 'friendship', 'joining', 'beauty', 'pagent', 'dacing', 'stage.The', 'film', 'up', 'tricks', 'pretty', 'early', 'funny', 'moments', 'come', 'very', 'sporadically', 'fact', 'characters', 'stories', 'gags', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'today', 'look', 'exactly', 'dead', 'art', 'pie-throwing', 'short', 'running', 'time', '80', 'minutes', 'film', 'still', 'padded', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'talk', ""'dream"", 'sequences', 'including', 'chihuahua', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'story.As', 'said', 'three', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'Jaci', 'Velasquez', 'do', 'act', 'gusto', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'characters', 'always', 'remain', 'likeable', 'like', 'Roselyn', 'Sanchez', 'who', 'curiously', 'attractive', 'charms', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'terrible', 'film', 'Trip', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'must', 'keep', 'wasting', 'awful', 'films', 'again', 'again.Innocuous', 'fluffy', 'not', 'problem', 'problem', 'could', 'think', 'only', 'hackneyed', 'ideas', 'fill', '80', 'minutes', 'used', 'as', 'many', 'four', 'writers']",Chasing Papi
