It is reasonably enjoyable but not much more.  There are quite a few story lines going on at once (Buster's mom and her emotional issues at Christmas, Arthur's search for the perfect Christmas present for mom, DW's anxiety over whether or not she'll get what she really wants from Santa, etc) so it isn't really focused enough to command much of an identity.  It's hard to capture much magic with a few too many varied story lines shifting back and forth.  My biggest complaint is the very forced multicultural element - not surprising since this is a PBS program, but it felt too educational & preachy in its covering of all the faith bases.  I'd prefer they make some unique holiday shows about Hanukkah and Kwanza instead of forcing the politically correct gamut at the expense of a more engaging story.I imagine if your kids are fans of Arthur they'll enjoy this one just fine.

558572,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B00004Y7J6,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[15, 15]","If you're familiar with the Arthur program airing on PBS, you already know just how clever this show can be. Created by Marc Brown and based on his books, Arthur Read is an aardvark who shares adventures (and misadventures!) with friends like Buster Baxter (a rabbit), Francine Frensky (a monkey), Binky Barnes (a bulldog), Muffy Crosswire (a very RICH monkey), and others. Arthur is often at odds with his little sister D.W. (Dora Winifred) which makes for much of the shows comedic moments.In Arthur's Perfect Christmas, the scene begins with Arthur sitting at the piano, softly playing Pachebel's Canon. This movie, like the TV show, uses day-dream sequences--and Arthur plunges into a snazzy song called ""Perfect Christmas"". You see, this holiday, Aruthur wants it to be absolutely PERFECT...but things go wrong in the town of Elwood City, for both Arthur AND his friends!For example, Muffy expects Francine to attend her big Christmas party, but Francine has told Muffy REPEATEDLY that her family is having a Hannukah gathering the same night. What happens when Francine doesn't show up for the party to receive her present?Buster Baxter worries about his Mom who seems to obsess over having a perfect Christmas for her son, especially since the divorce. Buster comes up with ""Baxter Day"" which takes the pressure of his Mom and displays the true meaning of the holidays--love and kindness.Arthur searches the mall for presents for his parents, D.W. is desperate for a Tina the Talking Tabby (whose theme song haunts Arthur everywhere he goes!), Uncle Fred makes an unexpected visit on his way to a Floridian Christmas, and Arthur's Dad insists on making an ""authentic"" dinner that was likely served in Bethlehem over 2000 years ago.Holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah are also highlighted making this a fun and informative DVD.I bought the Arthur's Perfect Christmas DVD for my son several years ago and it's STILL his favorite. I just brought out the Christmas DVD's and VHS's and he plays this one several times a day. It's filled with fun songs (24 of them!), witty banter, and clever wordplay. Not only that, there's a great message that expectations often disappoint and that a wonderful experience can arise out of mishaps and situations not going as planned.This 60 minute DVD doesn't have any extras (except for previews of other Arthur DVD's), but this excellent movie is well worth the price in my opinion. My husband and I get a kick out of the cleverness shown in Arthur TV series and this movie is no exception. And as I said, it's my son's favorite holiday movie.Highly recommended for kids and parents alike!",5,Excellent Holiday Movie!,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2631,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'Arthur', 'program', 'airing', 'PBS', 'already', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'clever', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'Created', 'Marc', 'Brown', 'based', 'books', 'Arthur', 'Read', 'aardvark', 'who', 'shares', 'friends', 'Buster', 'Baxter', 'rabbit', 'Francine', 'Frensky', 'monkey', 'Binky', 'Barnes', 'bulldog', 'Muffy', 'Crosswire', 'very', 'RICH', 'monkey', 'others', 'Arthur', 'often', 'odds', 'little', 'sister', 'D.W.', 'Dora', 'Winifred', 'much', 'shows', 'comedic', 'moments.In', 'Arthur', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'scene', 'Arthur', 'sitting', 'piano', 'softly', 'playing', 'Pachebel', 'Canon', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'day-dream', 'sequences', 'Arthur', 'snazzy', 'song', 'called', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'see', 'holiday', 'Aruthur', 'be', 'absolutely', 'PERFECT', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'town', 'Elwood', 'City', 'Arthur', 'friends', 'example', 'Muffy', 'Francine', 'attend', 'big', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Francine', 'told', 'Muffy', 'REPEATEDLY', 'family', 'having', 'Hannukah', 'gathering', 'same', 'night', 'What', 'when', 'Francine', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'party', 'receive', 'present', 'Buster', 'Baxter', 'Mom', 'who', 'obsess', 'over', 'having', 'perfect', 'Christmas', 'son', 'especially', 'divorce', 'Buster', 'up', 'Baxter', 'Day', 'pressure', 'Mom', 'true', 'meaning', 'holidays', 'love', 'kindness.Arthur', 'mall', 'presents', 'parents', 'D.W.', 'desperate', 'Tina', 'Talking', 'Tabby', 'theme', 'song', 'haunts', 'Arthur', 'everywhere', 'Uncle', 'Fred', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'way', 'Floridian', 'Christmas', 'Arthur', 'Dad', 'making', 'authentic', 'dinner', 'was', 'likely', 'served', 'Bethlehem', '2000', 'years', 'such', 'Kwanzaa', 'Hanukkah', 'are', 'also', 'highlighted', 'making', 'fun', 'informative', 'DVD.I', 'bought', 'Arthur', 'Perfect', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'son', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'STILL', 'favorite', 'just', 'brought', 'out', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'one', 'several', 'times', 'day', 'filled', 'fun', 'songs', '24', 'witty', 'banter', 'clever', 'wordplay', 'Not', 'only', 'great', 'message', 'expectations', 'often', 'disappoint', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'can', 'arise', 'mishaps', 'situations', 'not', 'going', 'planned.This', '60', 'minute', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'extras', 'previews', 'other', 'Arthur', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'movie', 'well', 'price', 'opinion', 'husband', 'get', 'kick', 'cleverness', 'shown', 'Arthur', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'exception', 'said', 'son', 'favorite', 'holiday', 'movie.Highly', 'recommended', 'kids', 'parents', 'alike']",N/A

Our cable provider listed out Holiday shows in the Kids Section during the Season and I found it one year so I got the family together and we watched it. I ended up purchasing it on DVD since it wasn't on the following Christmas and I didn't have Prime at that time. Anyway, on to the review ...The show has a couple musical numbers in it which is not a normal feature of the kid's series. They're cute and provide a nice touch. The usual cast of characters are there and we learn a little more about each of them and what they do during their own Holiday celebrations. Every Holiday is covered which has become the norm for many Christmas shows; making sure no one feels left out. As such, you'll learn a little bit about each of those Holidays throughout the vignette of the storyline. Sadly, they keep Christmas focused on the commercial end of it and do not touch upon the sacred core about Christ's birth. But, that isn't distracting or forced, it just is. Arthur's dad does insert a nod to Biblical times when he decides to ditch the usual turkey and taters for first century foods. Neither are the other Holiday celebrations forced into the storyline. They flow naturally and overall the whole show highlights themes such sacrifice, friendship, love, togetherness, etc.Marc Brown's characters are true-to-life in that he does a fine job having them mirror how kids act in the real world. As such, their reactions provide lots of opportunities to talk to your kids about what is happening during the show. At least, that's how we watch shows. : )Final analysis, enjoyable Holiday fare; fun for the whole family.",4,You'll learn some new things about each character and have lots to talk about with your kids,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1683,"['think', 'originally', 'saw', 'TV', 'one', 'Christmas', 'years', 'ago', 'cable', 'provider', 'listed', 'out', 'Holiday', 'shows', 'Kids', 'Section', 'Season', 'found', 'one', 'year', 'so', 'got', 'family', 'together', 'watched', 'ended', 'up', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'following', 'Christmas', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Prime', 'time', 'Anyway', 'review', 'show', 'couple', 'musical', 'numbers', 'not', 'normal', 'feature', 'kid', 'series', ""'re"", 'cute', 'provide', 'nice', 'touch', 'usual', 'cast', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'do', 'own', 'Holiday', 'celebrations', 'Holiday', 'covered', 'become', 'norm', 'many', 'Christmas', 'shows', 'making', 'sure', 'one', 'left', 'out', 'such', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'little', 'bit', 'Holidays', 'vignette', 'storyline', 'Sadly', 'keep', 'Christmas', 'focused', 'commercial', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'touch', 'sacred', 'core', 'Christ', 'birth', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'forced', 'just', 'Arthur', 'dad', 'insert', 'nod', 'Biblical', 'times', 'when', 'ditch', 'usual', 'turkey', 'taters', 'first', 'century', 'foods', 'are', 'other', 'Holiday', 'celebrations', 'forced', 'storyline', 'flow', 'naturally', 'overall', 'whole', 'show', 'highlights', 'themes', 'such', 'sacrifice', 'friendship', 'love', 'togetherness', 'etc.Marc', 'Brown', 'characters', 'are', 'true-to-life', 'fine', 'job', 'having', 'mirror', 'how', 'kids', 'act', 'real', 'world', 'such', 'reactions', 'provide', 'lots', 'opportunities', 'talk', 'kids', 'what', 'happening', 'show', 'least', 'how', 'watch', 'shows', 'Final', 'analysis', 'enjoyable', 'Holiday', 'fare', 'fun', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

Our local PBS station has not been broadcasting it recently, so when I saw it was coming to DVD (and at a great price)I just grabbed it.  This disc is pretty bare-bones, but I wasn't getting it for behind-the-scenes information or a lofty commentary.  I just wanted to see Arthur and his friends.  This does the trick.The special is an hour instead of the series' usual half-hour.  The extra time is nicely used to show the different ways that Arthur's friends celebrate the holidays.
