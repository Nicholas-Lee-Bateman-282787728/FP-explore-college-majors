But overall, it's pretty good because it keeps you wondering and some parts are very creepy and shocking. I saw this movie and got what I expected, an overall descent thriller that was very creepy and entertaining.Dakota Fanning made the movie as good as it is, her acting was great, as well as Robert Deniro's. A lot of folks think that Fanning wasted her time on this, but I think it was a good choice to go ahead and finish this sort of a movie while she is still young. Fanning and Deniro both did fantastic.It's about a father(Deniro) and a daughter (Fanning) who leave their hometown to go to a more quiet area after his wife/her mom kills herself in the bathtub. The daughter starts showing serious signs of having a dangreous imaginary friend who knows something about her mother's death. Her father is annoyed and getting stressed over this ""imaginary friend"". Things get more and more serious as evil things start happening inside of the house. It's obvious that the daughter is responsible for these awful things, but she blames her imaginary friend.The ending is a surprise twist, and the main ending scene is great, though it takes a little thinking to clearly understand it.

900337,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,B00092ZLS0,Allen Bowers,"[1, 3]","Let's see now you've got a seemingly different horror concept with quite a big cast featuring Robert Deniro, Amy Irving(not new to horror remember Carrie & Carrie 2), and two beautiful talented and incredibly sexy actresses  Elisabeth Shue and Famke Janssen(also no stranger to horror remember the Lord of Illusions and Deep Rising),  Robert John Burke(remember him from Thinner?).  So you might think that this movie would be great right?  WRONG!  This movie was so disturbing, anti-social, low budget and just plain horrible!  We start out with Dakota Fanning character Emily who's mother(Irving) has mysteriously died in what brings literal meaning to the expression ""Blood Bath"".  So her and her father(De Niro move somewhere else to forget about the said death and move on.  Well to sum it up there are a few murders going on by which Emily(Fanning) blames on a supposed imaginary friend named Charlie.  Well needless to say it isn't long after that that this movie really becomes dreadful and predictable mostly anyway.  One thing that was never made  clear was the arguing,  physical abuse,  and agenda between Robert John Burke's character and whatever actress played his wife!  Also there's a scene where for some reason Burke's character points a knife at De Niro's character,  they struggle a little then you never see Burke's character again!  What was that about?!  Anyway let me spoil the ending by saying that for some disturbing reason the killer ends up being De Niro!  So needless to say little Emily must run from her father while Famke Janssen comes to save the day.  Another thing that was never made clear was why was her father so crazy?!  It appeared that he had a split personality being Charlie but that wasn't clear at all!  So needless to say instead of Emily's father getting the help he needs they end up having to kill him instead. And after that when Famke takes over custody of Emily for some reason she draws a picture of herself with two heads! HUH?!!

900338,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B00092ZLS0,Allen Chapman,"[1, 1]","I rented ""Hide And Seek"" and just finished watching it. This movie moves SO slow. The plot is simple, wife dies, husband and child move away to start over, kid gets imaginary friend (or is it?). Part of the problem with this movie is that the couple should have been a little younger. Deniro seems too old for the role. Aside from that the first hour of the movie is spent with Deniro putting Dakota Fanning to bed, I lost track but we get something like six scenes of this! Fanning also spends the first hour staring blankly into space. She doesn't speak much and just stares. Apparently she's in shock over her mother's death. The whole thing just drags on and on until the final fifteen minutes when the whole story is revealed, but by then you really don't care who Charlie is, and you've already probably figured it out anyhow. The best part of the movie was the very last frame of the movie. I thought that one shot was very clever.There are a bunch of extras on the DVD, you can choose to see the movie as originally shown or with alternate scenes inserted into it.

From the typical settings to the ridiculous red herrings, Hide and Seek is a film that shouldn't have been made, and it definitely shouldn't have starred Robert DeNiro. I've an idea for a better film with DeNiro, one in which he fires his agent or whoever is helping him select scripts. As for John Polson, can one sink lower than Swimfan? That's a resounding yes. The only thing Polson gets right in this film are the long unnecessary shots of beautiful New York State.When David's wife commits suicide, daughter Emily (who sees her mother's body) is understandably upset. Fortunately for her, dear old Dad, and close (and totally unexplained) family friend Katherine (Famke Jansen) are both psychiatrists, though terrible ones. At one point, Katherine suggests to David that he return Emily to NYC where she can get full time care. David decides to work with her himself for just a bit longer, despite the fact that her pretend friend ""Charlie"" just killed the family cat. Umm... am I the only one not buying this?Once ""Charlie"" starts causing trouble, Polson systematically implicates every single character as the evildoer. The sheriff and the next door neighbor seem overly smitten by young Emily, and the landlord shows up at 3am to slide some keys under the front door. The surprise ending is so clich&eacute; it's a surprise to see it used yet again.

900340,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00092ZLS0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Sometimes a movie tries too hard to be something more than it really is.  `Hide and Seek' is that type of movie.  Sure, there are moments when the movie is a tad on the creepy side, but for the most part it is a bunch of clich&eacute;s strung together in a tired fashion that comes across corny and out of place as apposed to genuinely scary and frightening.  I had truly no desire to see this movie.  Sadly Robert De Niro has fallen away from everything that made him great and so upon seeing the trailer for this movie I immediately made the connection to the debacle known as `Godsend' and figured that this would be the same kind of mess.  In actuality though, I think that this was even worse.  At lease `Godsend' has a somewhat original plot.`Hide and Seek' follows David Callaway and his troubled daughter Emily as they travel to upstate New York shortly after David's wife Alison commits suicide.  The tragedy has had a terrible effect on Emily who is cold and distant and destructive.  Soon after moving Emily makes a new friend, Charlie, and it's shortly after this that things get weird.  Emily's demeanor gets worse and worse and things start happening around the house that suggest something sinister in the works.What irritates me the most about `Hide and Seek' is that it doesn't know when to quit.  It wants so badly to keep one guessing that it veers off on what promises to be eerie subplots only to abandon them with questions left lingering and take us in a completely different direction.  One wonders in the end just what Laura was talking about when she said that she's ""said too much"" or just what Emily said to Sheriff Hafferty or maybe even more so, what in the world Sheriff Hafferty was getting at when he was questioning Emily.  These loose ends and plenty others regarding Charlie especially beg to be answered but the sloppy script leaves them all unanswered.I think it's safe to say that the four main stars in this film are far better than this.  Robert De Niro was at one time our greatest working actor.  Iconic performances like that of Vito Corleone or Travis Bickle will go down in history as some of the best the world has ever seen; so why is he starring in this tripe.  Elisabeth Shue, while not my favorite actress, has proven to be above this, and Famke Janssen (easily the best thing about this movie) needs to further explore the brilliance she brought to the second season of `Nip Tuck'.  Dakota Fanning is decent here, not as stiff or mechanical as De Niro, yet she overdoes it quite a bit.  I prefer her to play the sweet mature child (see `I Am Sam' or `War of the Worlds') to the eerie gothic girl.  She comes off as trying too hard.In the end I would stay far, far away from this film.  It isn't even a decent B-Grade horror film.  The chills are short lived, and in the end when Charlie is revealed you'll be let down at the fact that you guessed it way too soon in the game.",1,"Quick; hide, and stay hidden...",1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,2927,"['Sometimes', 'movie', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'really', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'type', 'movie', 'Sure', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'movie', 'tad', 'creepy', 'side', 'most', 'part', 'bunch', 'clich', 'eacute', 'strung', 'together', 'tired', 'fashion', 'corny', 'place', 'apposed', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'frightening', 'had', 'truly', 'no', 'desire', 'see', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'fallen', 'away', 'everything', 'made', 'great', 'so', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'movie', 'immediately', 'made', 'connection', 'debacle', 'known', 'Godsend', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'kind', 'mess', 'actuality', 'think', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'lease', 'Godsend', 'somewhat', 'original', 'plot.', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'David', 'Callaway', 'troubled', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'travel', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'shortly', 'David', 'wife', 'Alison', 'suicide', 'tragedy', 'had', 'terrible', 'effect', 'Emily', 'who', 'cold', 'distant', 'destructive', 'Soon', 'moving', 'Emily', 'new', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'shortly', 'things', 'get', 'weird', 'Emily', 'demeanor', 'worse', 'worse', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'house', 'suggest', 'something', 'sinister', 'works.What', 'most', 'Hide', 'Seek', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'quit', 'so', 'badly', 'keep', 'one', 'guessing', 'off', 'what', 'be', 'eerie', 'subplots', 'only', 'abandon', 'questions', 'left', 'lingering', 'take', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'One', 'wonders', 'end', 'just', 'what', 'Laura', 'was', 'talking', 'when', 'said', 'said', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'what', 'Emily', 'said', 'Sheriff', 'Hafferty', 'maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'what', 'world', 'Sheriff', 'Hafferty', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'was', 'questioning', 'Emily', 'loose', 'ends', 'plenty', 'others', 'regarding', 'Charlie', 'especially', 'be', 'answered', 'sloppy', 'script', 'unanswered.I', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'four', 'main', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'greatest', 'working', 'actor', 'Iconic', 'performances', 'Vito', 'Corleone', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'history', 'best', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'why', 'starring', 'tripe', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'not', 'favorite', 'actress', 'proven', 'be', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'easily', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'further', 'explore', 'brilliance', 'brought', 'second', 'season', 'Nip', 'Tuck', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'decent', 'here', 'not', 'stiff', 'mechanical', 'De', 'Niro', 'yet', 'quite', 'bit', 'prefer', 'play', 'sweet', 'mature', 'child', 'see', 'Am', 'Sam', 'War', 'Worlds', 'eerie', 'gothic', 'girl', 'off', 'trying', 'too', 'end', 'would', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'decent', 'B-Grade', 'horror', 'film', 'chills', 'are', 'short', 'lived', 'end', 'when', 'Charlie', 'revealed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'let', 'down', 'fact', 'guessed', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'game']",N/A

I won't say exactly what it is, but for those of you curious about it, I will say that nothing in this movie is ever surprising. Occasionally, the film-makers attempt to mislead you, but it fails every time. And it's so painfully slow that by the time the ending does come about, you're blinking through heavy eyelids.This movie's one saving grace was Robby D. Any movie he's in, I'm willing to watch, especially since, late in his career, he's trying new things. He succeeded with his furay into comedy; so why not horror?

900346,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B00092ZLS0,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[1, 1]","It's definitely the music that gives this movie an overall ominous feel. I was genuinly creeped out the entire time. And just when you least expect it, the music suddenly picks up in one giant orchestra boom that will send you flying five feet in the air. Even Dakota Fanning's bright blue eyes are ominous.  That bright, bubbly blonde is not there. She will pierce you through the television screen with those baby blues, which contrast enormously with the dark hair she sports in the film. Freaky.DeNiro plays a psychiatrist named David. In the beginning, his wife kills herself in the bathtub. Needing a fresh start, David thinks it best to uproot his daughter Emily (Fanning) and take her to the country. What could be a Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm-esque move to the country is actually dark and dreary. Apparently there's no sun in the country. And it's damp all the time. I really hate this kind of film trickery-- scary by use of overly forboding environment. David makes a new friend in a young woman played by Elisabeth Shue. Her performance is awkward, as is her character. Emily also makes a new friend named Charlie, whom David assumes is just an imaginary friend. David seeks guidance from a fellow psychiatrist (Famke Jansenn), who tells him that it's perfectly normal for a child to have an imaginary friend in the midst of a tragedy. However, strange and terrible occurances begin to make David realize that either a) his daughter is a complete psycho or b) Charlie isn't imaginary at all.I can't help but admire Dakota Fanning. Look at all she's accomplished at such a young age. People are saying she's the next Drew Barrymore. Perhaps they're right to believe that she'll grow into a successful adult actor the way Barrymore did, but I find Fanning's performances not just weightier, but better than Barrymore's roles as a chlid. In a word, Fanning is STELLAR. And just for that, I highly recommend this movie. Sure, it's a bit slow and drab, but it will keep you guessing and hey, it might just shock you in the end. And that's always fun.

900350,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B00092ZLS0,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[2, 4]","Why do people want to watch scary films?  What is the reason for the popularity of Horror films?  The usual conventional wisdom suggests that it is most often a desire for experiencing heightened evocative sensations in a safe and harm-free environment (the best of both worlds, so to speak).  Others will say that they are interested in some `artistic' facet of the film itself.  As I have often stated, horror film fans have very high expectations and a demanding threshold for everything from gore to special effects to - lacking a better term - scariness.  Those who have been hardcore fans long enough might have already begun to acknowledge the realization that they probably won't be scared by most films out there.  However, there are some trade-offs that can be made: good pacing, solid direction, capable writing, original story premise, and failing these - FEMALE NUDITY - which can sometimes offset a lack of gore and flashy special effects.  Acting is not usually deemed a critical aspect, but is welcomed when it does indeed come through with solid performances.One thing I have a fair certainty about is that people generally DON'T watch horror movies just because Hollywood tosses a couple of big names on the marquis.  The presence of ""A-list"" celebrities (an arbitrary, often temporary, and generally meaningless designation) is no substitute for a good plot and lively pacing, or at least capable special effects.  But what if the cast is really good, filled with talented and even exceptional actors?  As proven by the film HIDE AND SEEK, it still isn't adequate by itself.For those who do not know what this film is about AND are genuinely interested (or at least don't already have a preconceived opinion), it's about a widowed father and his precocious grade-school daughter who move from the big city to start over again in a small town.  Soon, fatalities begin to appear, and the daughter speaks of an invisible playmate named Charlie in connection with the deaths.  I will not list any more details, so as to avoid any spoilers, although it's a fair probablity you have figured out the ""mystery"" by the time you have finished reading this sentence.The cast features Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning in principle roles, with Dylan Baker and Elizabeth Shue and Famke Janssen in supporting roles.  Pretty solid performers all.  However, the story is easily predictable early on and the film never really generates the kind of suspenseful tension that grips the audience.  Although DeNiro is recognized as one of the preeminent actors of his generation, and can play some roles better than anyone else can, his range is more limited than some will admit.  Even his talent can be offset when cast in the wrong role and not given the right direction - as is the case in this film.  Dakota Fanning was terribly directed in the dismal WAR OF THE WORLDS, and although she does a good job in this film, she can't save it from its unoriginal premise and formulaic structure.So as not to seem aloof in my observations, I rented this film because the trailer seemed pretty good, and I too like the challenge of finding a Horror film that will make a positive impression.  Many of you have indicated that our (yours and my) insights and opinions regarding movies are somewhat parallel and occasionally similar.  In this case, you will most likely be unimpressed and somewhat disappointed.

This reviewer certainly felt that as far as ""thrillers"" go, this was one of the better ones that have been unleashed upon the masses in a while.Ahhh... life was all too good for little Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning) until mommy slit her wrists in the bathtub. Now, what was once a happy go lucky little girl has become an extremely introverted little nut case. She has no friends her own age, barely says a word, and can stare you down with one look of her bulgin baby blues.Of course, Daddy (David) Calloway (Robert De Niro) aint doin so hot either. He has lost his wife and he's losing his daughter a little more each day; so he packs up and heads upstate.... hoping that change will help his daughter  ""heal"".However, once they move in to the new house, little Emily starts getting kookier by the moment. She shuns Davids attempts to find her new friends, begins closing herself off even more, and develops a new ""imaginary"" friend named Charlie; who seems to have vengeful  motives of his own. The further Charlie's influence begins to affect little Emily, the stranger and stranger things get for poor David. Of course, it all leads to the climactic showdown--which is done in typical thriller fashion.This reviewer enjoyed ""Hide and Seek"". I have read plenty of reviews that state that this movie was a waste of Deniros and Fannings talent. Thats a real crock of B.S. if you ask me. Deniro and Fanning both turn in subtle then chilling performances. Fanning elicits childlike fear with a cool precision.....and Deniro...well.....Deniro is Deniro and thats good enough for me! They are both very talented and do what they need to make the movie work..Nice supporting roles from Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Gray from X-men) and Elizabeth Shue help flesh out the storyline nicely.The very -very- very- end of the movie is kind of hokey but the other 98% of the film delivers just what a thriller should. The script is sharp, and not as predicatble as previous reviews claim.The film puts a nice little spin on a subject that has been played out before--so while ""Hide and Seek"" is not entirely original, it is without a doubt thoroughly entertaining and watchable.Recommended!",4,Seek it out....,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,2247,"['Hide', 'Seek', 'above', 'averave', 'thriller', 'be', 'seen', 'reviewer', 'certainly', 'felt', 'as', 'far', 'thrillers', 'go', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'have', 'been', 'unleashed', 'masses', 'while.Ahhh', 'life', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'little', 'Emily', 'Callaway', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'mommy', 'slit', 'wrists', 'bathtub', 'Now', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'happy', 'go', 'lucky', 'little', 'girl', 'become', 'extremely', 'introverted', 'little', 'nut', 'case', 'friends', 'own', 'age', 'barely', 'word', 'can', 'stare', 'down', 'one', 'look', 'bulgin', 'baby', 'blues.Of', 'course', 'Daddy', 'David', 'Calloway', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'aint', 'doin', 'so', 'hot', 'either', 'lost', 'wife', 'losing', 'daughter', 'little', 'more', 'day', 'up', 'heads', 'upstate', 'hoping', 'change', 'will', 'help', 'daughter', 'heal', '.However', 'once', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'little', 'Emily', 'getting', 'kookier', 'moment', 'shuns', 'Davids', 'attempts', 'find', 'new', 'friends', 'closing', 'off', 'even', 'more', 'new', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'named', 'Charlie', 'who', 'have', 'vengeful', 'motives', 'own', 'further', 'Charlie', 'influence', 'affect', 'little', 'Emily', 'stranger', 'stranger', 'things', 'get', 'poor', 'David', 'course', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'done', 'typical', 'thriller', 'fashion.This', 'reviewer', 'enjoyed', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'have', 'read', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'state', 'movie', 'was', 'waste', 'Deniros', 'Fannings', 'talent', 'real', 'crock', 'B.S', 'ask', 'Deniro', 'Fanning', 'turn', 'subtle', 'then', 'chilling', 'performances', 'Fanning', 'elicits', 'childlike', 'fear', 'cool', 'precision', '..and', 'Deniro', 'well', '..Deniro', 'Deniro', 'thats', 'good', 'enough', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'do', 'what', 'need', 'make', 'movie', 'work..Nice', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Dr.', 'Jean', 'Gray', 'X-men', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'storyline', 'nicely.The', 'very', '-very-', 'very-', 'end', 'movie', 'kind', 'hokey', 'other', '98', '%', 'film', 'delivers', 'just', 'what', 'thriller', 'should', 'script', 'sharp', 'not', 'as', 'predicatble', 'previous', 'reviews', 'claim.The', 'film', 'nice', 'little', 'spin', 'subject', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'so', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'doubt', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'watchable.Recommended']",N/A

Dakota Fanning is very good as Emily, a psychiatrist's (Robert Deniro) daughter.  The story is initially very engaging, and the atmosphere builds up reasonably well to the turning/revelation point in the movie.  Unfortunately, from that point forward the writer, director and producers got the movie all wrong.  Once it becomes clear what is going on, the movie transforms into a hard-to-watch straight horror flick. Emily suffers hugely during this later section, and we are now strongly empathizing with her.  I felt that my own emotions were being bludgeoned along with Emily's, and really did not enjoy any aspect of this part of the movie.  Some of it was necessary to finalize the story, but it simply went on much too long.The most interesting aspect of this movie/DVD is watching the various alternate endings, and the commentary that goes with them.  Two of those endings are most definitely superior to the ending used in the movie.  The commentary makes it clear that the writer and director knew those endings were better, but they lament that test audiences showed that people just didn't want to see more bad things happen to Emily.  Odd that they couldn't see that it wasn't the ending that was the problem, but rather the prior 25 minutes that needed to be shortened to 5.Oh well.

Earlier in the year, he regurgitated his MEET THE PARENTS role for MEET THE FOCKERS, and last year did some very bad Pacino-esque over-the-topness as a shady doctor in the unquestionably bad GODSEND.  In an attempt to keep the streak alive, we have HIDE AND SEEK, another one  of those recent thrillers that substitutes stylish  cinematography and nice backlighting for actual plot and decent acting.  De Niro again plays a doctor, this time a psychiatrist whose wife is apparently troubled and therefore decides it would be best to no longer live.  This is especially troubling for the couple's typically young-enough-to-be-granddaughter daughter, played here by the eerily precocious Dakota Fanning.  Father and daughter retreat upstate, at which point all the ""fun"" begins.  Throughout, the plot introduces peripheral characters/red herrings that advance the story little.  The acting is very uneven--De Niro seems unengaged, particularly at the climax,  and Elisabeth Shue gives another one of her dependably vacant performances as De Niro's new friend/love interest.

Then there's a point in the film where it could be a creature movie, then a possible stalker movie. Then it becomes something else entirely. Really to blame is the really lackluster script which gives nothing new to the film or even scary.David Callaway and his daughter Emily are just reeling from the suicide of his wife Alison. Wanting to take her out from the house, he moves an hour away upstate. There, he meets some neighbours and everything seems fine. But his daughter Emily is turning rather gothic with vacant expressions, inconsiderate attitudes towards David's new friend Elizabeth and her daughter and starts talking of an imaginary friend named Charlie. At first David dismisses it, until strange things start happening(as usual, right?) and David gets suspicious of this friend ""Charlie"".That imaginary friend part makes you think of a ghost right? Well so did I. It becomes something else entirely and the ""twist"" is straight out of something like Secret Window or Fight Club(did I just spoil it for those who've seen those movies?). Not to mention the movie isn't even creepy or scary.I'm not going to blame the actors. Robert De Niro is in that rare category of actors that can emote so much with just a facial expression. He doesn't need big overracted speeches to convey something, he just shows it. And Dakota Fanning is starting to have an impressive resume, that is if you discount Cat in the Hat.

900374,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00092ZLS0,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 6]","Once again, I find myself completely enamored with a film that many viewers obviously didn't like.  I'm at a loss to explain others' displeasure, as I found Hide and Seek to be an exemplary film with a wonderfully pervasive dark aura, oodles of suspense, a genuinely excellent script, standout performances by both Robert De Niro and young Dakota Fanning, and an ending with plenty of shock value that also manages to play itself out well up through the very end.  It's going to be hard to really explain my take on the excellence of this film, though, because it just won't do to give future viewers more than a rudimentary glimpse at the basic story.  Maybe those who disliked the film knew too much going in; such knowledge would rob Hide and Seek of most of its dramatic power.De Niro is always good; when you sit and watch the guy work, it's hard to call anyone else in Hollywood a real actor - and the character he played had to have such a great actor in order to make this film be all it could be.  It also needed a great child actress, and Dakota Fanning may well be the best up and coming actress out there.  She more than holds her own against De Niro, basically giving an adult performance as Emily, a young girl haunted by the death of her mother.  After finding his wife dead in the bathtub, David Calloway (De Niro) decides to move with his daughter to a quiet country house outside the Big City.  Emily is having a rough time dealing with the trauma of her mother's death, and he thinks she needs a brand new start, free of the bad memories haunting her.  Their new, quiet life proves to be less than ideal - and increasingly downright unhealthy.  The townsfolk they interact with are just plain weird, Emily becomes increasingly withdrawn, and David, despite the fact that he's a well-established psychologist, seems at a loss as to how to help his little girl.  Things take an increasingly dark turn after Emily establishes a friendship with Charley.  She seems to be displacing her own negative feelings through an imaginary friend, but the whole Charley situation eventually gets out of hand - and in a pretty major way.Like a lot of psychological suspense thrillers, the film tends to move fairly slowly early on.  It's important that we get to know these characters as deeply as we can before the dramatic part of the story really heats up.  Fanning really is an experienced adult actress in a child's body, and it's amazing to watch her develop her character (both physically and emotionally) into an increasingly disturbed, haunted child.  The supporting cast is excellent, each one of them contributing greatly to the sense of wrongness that seems to hold the whole community in its dark grip.  All of these things combine to make the film's conclusion pay off big time, at least in my opinion (although there was one little illogical issue that bothered me somewhat).  Hide and Seek, once all is said and done, clearly makes perfect sense, and I for one consider it a most impressive psychological thriller.",5,"A most impressive, intelligent, suspenseful thriller",1135123200,"12 21, 2005",2005,3033,"['Once', 'again', 'find', 'completely', 'enamored', 'film', 'many', 'viewers', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'loss', 'explain', 'others', 'displeasure', 'found', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'be', 'exemplary', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'pervasive', 'dark', 'aura', 'oodles', 'suspense', 'genuinely', 'excellent', 'script', 'standout', 'performances', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'young', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'ending', 'plenty', 'shock', 'value', 'also', 'play', 'out', 'well', 'up', 'very', 'end', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'really', 'explain', 'take', 'excellence', 'film', 'though', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'give', 'future', 'viewers', 'more', 'rudimentary', 'glimpse', 'basic', 'story', 'Maybe', 'who', 'disliked', 'film', 'knew', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'such', 'knowledge', 'would', 'rob', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'most', 'dramatic', 'power.De', 'Niro', 'always', 'good', 'when', 'sit', 'watch', 'guy', 'work', 'hard', 'call', 'anyone', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'actor', 'character', 'played', 'had', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'be', 'could', 'be', 'also', 'needed', 'great', 'child', 'actress', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'up', 'coming', 'actress', 'there', 'more', 'own', 'De', 'Niro', 'basically', 'giving', 'adult', 'performance', 'Emily', 'young', 'girl', 'haunted', 'death', 'mother', 'finding', 'wife', 'dead', 'bathtub', 'David', 'Calloway', 'De', 'Niro', 'move', 'daughter', 'quiet', 'country', 'house', 'Big', 'City', 'Emily', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'dealing', 'trauma', 'mother', 'death', 'brand', 'new', 'start', 'free', 'bad', 'memories', 'haunting', 'new', 'quiet', 'life', 'proves', 'be', 'less', 'ideal', 'increasingly', 'downright', 'unhealthy', 'townsfolk', 'interact', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'Emily', 'increasingly', 'withdrawn', 'David', 'fact', 'well-established', 'psychologist', 'loss', 'how', 'help', 'little', 'girl', 'Things', 'take', 'increasingly', 'dark', 'turn', 'Emily', 'friendship', 'Charley', 'be', 'displacing', 'own', 'negative', 'feelings', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'whole', 'Charley', 'situation', 'eventually', 'hand', 'pretty', 'major', 'lot', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'film', 'move', 'fairly', 'slowly', 'early', 'important', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'as', 'deeply', 'can', 'dramatic', 'part', 'story', 'really', 'up', 'Fanning', 'really', 'experienced', 'adult', 'actress', 'child', 'body', 'amazing', 'watch', 'develop', 'character', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'increasingly', 'disturbed', 'haunted', 'child', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'one', 'contributing', 'greatly', 'sense', 'wrongness', 'hold', 'whole', 'community', 'dark', 'grip', 'things', 'combine', 'make', 'film', 'conclusion', 'pay', 'big', 'time', 'least', 'opinion', 'was', 'one', 'little', 'illogical', 'issue', 'bothered', 'somewhat', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'once', 'said', 'done', 'clearly', 'perfect', 'sense', 'one', 'consider', 'most', 'impressive', 'psychological', 'thriller']",N/A

The director presents this movie to the viewer from early on with dark undertones and cool colors or underexposed warm colors with somber melancholy background music.  The entire film is shot with ""classic"" horror camera angles and tricks taken from countless other horror movies before it.  The ""psychological"" aspects of this psychological thriller are very apparent from the start, and clearly, this is the focus of the film.  Yet the script is clearly more mystery than anything else, since all of the drama is derived from a perceived violent threat which could possible come from several real or imaginary sources.  It doesn't seem like a bad premise to begin with, but it is poorly executed.Most of the time, the atmosphere was creepy, with a haunted supernatural feel, which really didn't fit the plot at all.  Most of the time, you were looking for something to jump out of the bushes, or find Freddy Kruger or Jason sitting on the porch swing, because this is how the movie was filmed.  A ghost could have easily made a cameo role, without having to change the film at all.The tension developed slowly, as the characters really did not change much through the whole picture.  Red Herrings were enough to keep you occupied for most of the film, but were not very satisfying.  Overall, you were just waiting for something to happen, something big to develop, and nothing really happened until the very end, when the whole thing went nuts, and I mean this in the over the top sense of the word.  Clearly, mass murder was beyond the scope of the script, or the character in all reasonable terms, yet it was in there.  And the basic premise of the story, which is kept secret till the end, where the man murders his wife and stages it as a suicide, is totally unbelievable, considering he suffocated her which would have never gotten by the medical examiner who has to perform the required autopsy.Based on the plot description on the back, I was thinking more crime thriller, and this was a weird mix of things which never really gave you anything in the end.  The whole movied was based on something that never could have happened to begin with, which makes the whole move a weak idea.  And, the whole time you are watching it, you are kept on the edge of your seat waiting for something interesting to develop, and nothing ever does!If you ever seen a good horror film in your life, chuck this DVD on the been there done that pile because there is nothing new here.  This was a B horror film with a low body count and a few very very very trite ""gotcha"" scenes.  The pscyhology was lame and the surprise of the antagonist at the end was not good enough to overcome the stupidity of wholesale manslaughter and laughable back story.  Apparently the protagonists ""alter ego"" did not benefit from the intellegence of his counterpart at all, unless perhaps he wanted to stage the deaths of the sheriff and the girlfriend as suicides as well.  Which in the world that this movie depicts, this is totally believable.Don't watch this movie.  Don't subject friends, family, or loved ones to it.

900377,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B00092ZLS0,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 3]","The best horror movies are the psychological mysteries, the ones that keep us wondering if the creepy stuff resides in the characters' heads or if a ghost really does live in the attic.Even if we eventually encounter spirits in these films, there usually is a foundation of psychological truth: It isn't just the bumps and shrieks that unnerve us but also the way we identify with a character's emotions or guilty conscience.Hide and Seek is a psychological horror movie. For the first hour or so it builds inexorably to an excruciating level of dread. It does this so well, we're willing to forgive the small lapses of logic it takes to get us there.As the tension builds, however, so does our concern about how the movie will end. This is something quite apart from suspense. It has to do with our awareness that Hollywood, with few exceptions, seems no longer capable of making decent horror films. Far too many start out interestingly, then disintegrate into clich? and utter illogic.Before The Sixth Sense (1999), we could count on a gratuitous bloodbath and irrational behavior. We still can count on a bloodbath and irrational behavior, but now horror movies that aspire to the appearance of smartness want to make us smack our heads and go, ""Wow!""After the ""surprise ending,"" we're expected to rewind the movie in our minds and gasp at the clues we missed.Rewatching Hide and Seek we'll just feel miffed at being hoodwinked. The film is built on such an outrageous - and now overused - concept it makes us want to discount the effectiveness of the first half. But no. It's well-acted and cannily crafted in the beginning. We can appreciate it for that, even if it ultimately is ludicrous.Robert De Niro, who seems intent on dismantling the reputation he built in the 1970s as the greatest actor of his generation, plays David Callaway, a New York psychologist whose wife (Amy Irving) commits suicide. David's young daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), happens upon the scene as he discovers the body, and it traumatizes her.To get her away from bad memories, David moves with her to a large secluded house in the country. Some of the neighbors seem a bit weird.David must have been an extraordinarily prosperous psychologist, because essentially he makes Emily his only patient. We see him setting up an office and keeping a journal in which he makes notes about her condition.Meanwhile, she explores her new surroundings. Soon she has a new best friend, Charlie, who may not be as imaginary as he first seems.Frequently, at 2:06 in the morning - the time David awoke to find his wife's body - he wakes up in a sweat. Repeatedly, he's drawn to the bathroom where someone has scrawled accusations on the walls or created grisly re-enactments of the death scene. David blames Emily, but she insists it was Charlie.Things grow worse from there. Much worse. It's a horror film, remember?The performances are uniformly fine. Famke Janssen plays a New York colleague who takes special interest in Emily. Elizabeth Shue plays a woman David becomes interested in but whom Emily can't stand. Melissa Leo is a troubled next-door neighbor with a creepy husband. Dylan Baker is the sheriff.Fanning, who played the young kidnap victim in Man on Fire, is particularly effective.De Niro is De Niro. His commitment to the role seems total. He remains a fine actor though his movie choices are unfathomable.",4,Surprisingly good.

The over hyped Dakota Fanning is useless throughout the film and has about as much presence as an ice cube in an igloo. Sure Deniro is showing a slightly better persona here than he did in Godsend, but where Godsend had atmosphere, decent chills and plot development and dread throughout, Hide and seek is a bland mish mash of ideas used throughout the horror film library and it does nothing particularly well. Camera angles are either way off the mark or too much in your face. The pace is so slow during the first half of the movie, I actually got up twice to get snacks and to go to the bathroom, having not paused the DVD, and I missed nothing. Slow pacing is fine if you are telling a story or building up care for the characters onscreen by giving us vital information about their lives, but that is not the case in Hide and Seek. With Hide, it just seems to be a way to waste time until the audience starts to question why they decided to watch the movie in the first place. The third quarter involves a lot of warning signs that horror movie veterans were already savvy enough to have figured out in the first 20 minutes of the film. The last quarter of the movie is of course the inevitable finale that is more predictable than Punxatawny Phil. Here the director threw the kitchen sink of horror hijinx at us as if to apologize for our bad treatment in the first 3/4ths of the film. Yet the director still misses the mark in what appears to be a ripoff of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Deniro does his best work of the film here, and you almost feel bad for him having to take part in such an obvious display of ""me too"" horror play. The film also has 4 alternate endings that I had absolutely no interest in seeing. I was just glad the movie was finally done when the credits started rolling. All in all, Hide and Seek is a borefest of epic proportions that is bested even by the worst direct to DVD horror shlock. Advice for Deniro: When you sign on to act in a horror movie, do it with people who have a track record of giving us real winners, not stinkers.",1,Hide & Seek? No thanx.

900382,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B00092ZLS0,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[2, 5]","""Hide And Seek"" looked like a pretty good movie from the advertisments, but I can now say that the previews do not do it justice. The film, which is a thrill-a-minute scare-fest of psychlogical horror, also has some very god acting. The highlight of the actors is young Dakota Fanning, who is only 8 years old and one of the best actresses in Hollywood at this moment. The other is Robert De Niro, who is so good as Dakota's dad that he actually had me believing some of the things he was saying. That is seriously how believable he was. I went into the film skeptical about how I would recieve it after hearing mixed reviews. I was suprised to discover just 10 minutes in that I was on the edge of my seat and that as hard as I tried I was not able to tear my eyes away from the happenings on the screen. There is one scene towards the beginning, that sets up the plot, when De Niro's wife slashes her wrists in a brutal bathtub suicide. This scene has some of the best acting in a film not nominated for an Academy Award this year, or any year for that matter. I enjoyed the movies subtle references to Hitchcok. The birds fluttering around the house. How the bathtub is made into a grisly crime scene. The many shots of clocks, digital and older. Some of the jump moments in the movie, (and there are not very many, as this is a more psychological thriller), like characters appearing out of nowhere or things falling or jumping from places, are done with precision and skill. More than that given to recent horror films like ""The Grudge"", ""Gothika"", ""Boogeyman"", or  ""Gigli"". I saw the movie on Valentines Day with a crowd of giggling older men and women, but me and the person that I went with both thought that the film was very good. As the film progresses, the horror gets more and more persistent, leading to the exciting climax.Doctor David Callaway (Robert De Niro) is a celebrated New York psychologist. His daughter, Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning) is a seemingly normal little girl. The wife/mother of the clan, Alison Callaway (Amy Irving), is not doing as well as the other two in her semi-functional family. However, one night, Alison slices her wrists with a razor blade in a warm bathtub. David handles the matter by moving the remaining two to the country of New York (as opposed to the city). This is not taken well by Emily's psychiatrist, Katherine (Famke Janssen). She feels as if this move will only make Emily's condition worse. See, after her mothers suicide, Emily becomes very disturbed and shy. So they move, buying a large house by a lake. But this move holds an unexpected secret for David. Emily has started making new friends. One named Amy (Molly Grant Kallins) who is the niece of Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue). As David and Elizabeth start a romance, Emily and Amy are becoming sworn enemies. After Emily mutilates one of Amy's dolls, Amy runs out of the house, and we can assume that she wil not be returning for more. Soon enough, Elizabeth and David start a romance that Emily disapproves of incredibly. This is the drama angle of the film. Director John Polson surrounds his four main characters with strange supporting characters that are perfect murder suspects. They range from two neighbors (Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke) who have just recently lost a little girl that looks just like Emily. They also keep commenting on how beautiful Emily is and seem to take an unhealthy interest in her for a short time. There is a realtor (David Haskins) who likes to delier keys late in the night by sliding them under his buyers doors. There is also a nosy cop, Sheriff Hafferty (Dylan Baker) who goes around to peoples property just to ""see if everything is kosher"".The film is all genius, and the culprit is cleverly disguised until the end. The movie also lines itself with subplots so that people will not easily guess who or what is doing what. The audaciously violent third act is when most of the killing takes place. Up until then, there were only two deaths, one in the first act (the suicide), and one in the second (a person is thrown out of a window). That is fairly restrained for a horror/mystery/suspense movie. The last scenes are shocking and I was left breathless with suprise, as the last frame is sure to send shivers down your spine. Famke Janssen is a wonderfully skilled actress, as is Shue. They both bring a great style and put an innoccent twist on some of the scenes they are in. They seem to be the only not directly affected by the plot. Until the end, that is. Shue, a former Oscar winner, especially shines in a supporting role that shows her dramatic versatility as well as her horror versatility. Amy Irving gives a great performance as Emily's drug addled mother, even though she is only in about three scenes. This is a very good movie and quite effectively frightening. I hope everyone gets out to see this film, because it deserves to be seen by everyone.Movie: ""Hide And Seek""Running Time: 107 MinutesDirector: John PolsonCast: Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke

The plot was actually so predictable that it never occurred to me that the filmmakers would use such a worn-out cliche, so I guess in that sense it did surprise me.  But, in order to sustain the ""surprise,"" the film is obliged to be massively and transparently manipulative.  As a result, the personalities were so poorly realized and inconsistent that the main characters never gelled for me.  Ordinarily I'm crazy about Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning, but there is only so much they could do with this screenplay.  The bloody violence escalated so quickly that two-thirds of the way into the film I was numbed into indifference, which is usually a symptom of a film that substitutes gore for narrative.  At least this is the case for the theatrical release version; after barely sitting through that, I certainly have no interest in seeing all the alternate versions.  One bright spot was the art direction -- I enjoyed the drawings made by the child protagonist; they added a bit of texture to the otherwise lackluster story, and brought a modicum of punch to the final scene.

Beforehand, it does have its chilling moments, despite throwing in a clich&eacute; every now and then (the cat jumping out of a door, etc). And then the last part of the film the plot literally fizzles, and the thriller/horror movie formula is used.  It is then we decide we have seen this ploy done many times in movies before, and we may feel cheated as a moviegoer.How notorious is it for Hollywood to take a movie formula and use it repeatedly? Quite, apparently.Starring Dakota Fanning as Emily, Hide and Seek is about a girl who is traumatized after the apparent suicide of her mother. As Emily continues to be withdrawn after this incident, her father, played by Robert De Niro, decides to take her away from the city and start over away from the house and its memories. From there, Emily becomes obsessed with her imaginary friend ""Charlie"", and bizarre events begin to happen.What irked me most about this film was its logic, or lack thereof. Many of the characters just seem to fall into their convenient little places so the movie's plot will fit just right. For instance, you just know the worst thing the father can do is take Emily out into the country in a creepy old house and even creepier neighbors and sheriff to try to help them recover. (As a psychologist, you think he would know better).There are also inconsistencies and loose ends that are never explained, just left for one to ponder. For instance, what is with the neighbors who continually tell De Niro's character that his daughter is ""beautiful?"" Also, what is up with the man showing up at two o'clock in the morning to drop off a key to the house? The creepy sheriff apparently is just that: a creepy sheriff, and no more.Although this wasn't an awful movie, it is certainly won't be one remembered years down the line. Although this movie was scary at times, there are many other scary movies that will leave one feeling more satisfied.It's my suggestion that you rent this movie first, and judge for yourself, rather than racing out and buying it when it comes to DVD.",3,"Unoriginal, mediocre thriller",1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,2222,"['Unoriginal', 'be', 'predominant', 'word', 'mind', 'when', 'describing', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'cop-out', 'latter', 'part', 'film', 'Beforehand', 'have', 'chilling', 'moments', 'throwing', 'clich', 'eacute', 'now', 'then', 'cat', 'jumping', 'door', 'etc', 'then', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'plot', 'literally', 'thriller/horror', 'movie', 'formula', 'used', 'then', 'decide', 'have', 'seen', 'ploy', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'movies', 'may', 'feel', 'cheated', 'moviegoer.How', 'notorious', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'movie', 'formula', 'use', 'repeatedly', 'Quite', 'apparently.Starring', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Emily', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'girl', 'who', 'traumatized', 'apparent', 'suicide', 'mother', 'Emily', 'be', 'withdrawn', 'incident', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'take', 'away', 'city', 'start', 'away', 'house', 'memories', 'there', 'Emily', 'obsessed', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'bizarre', 'events', 'begin', 'happen.What', 'irked', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'logic', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Many', 'characters', 'just', 'seem', 'fall', 'convenient', 'little', 'places', 'movie', 'plot', 'will', 'fit', 'just', 'right', 'instance', 'just', 'know', 'worst', 'thing', 'father', 'can', 'do', 'take', 'Emily', 'out', 'country', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'even', 'creepier', 'neighbors', 'sheriff', 'try', 'help', 'recover', 'psychologist', 'think', 'would', 'know', 'better', 'are', 'also', 'inconsistencies', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'just', 'left', 'one', 'ponder', 'instance', 'what', 'neighbors', 'who', 'continually', 'tell', 'De', 'Niro', 'character', 'daughter', 'beautiful', 'Also', 'what', 'up', 'man', 'showing', 'up', 'two', ""o'clock"", 'morning', 'drop', 'off', 'key', 'house', 'creepy', 'sheriff', 'apparently', 'just', 'creepy', 'sheriff', 'more.Although', 'was', ""n't"", 'awful', 'movie', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'remembered', 'years', 'down', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'times', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'scary', 'movies', 'will', 'leave', 'one', 'feeling', 'more', 'satisfied.It', 'suggestion', 'rent', 'movie', 'first', 'judge', 'rather', 'racing', 'out', 'buying', 'when', 'DVD']",N/A

First, there was Godsend, now Bobby follows up with another mediocre effort in Hide and Seek. This movie is only partially saved from being complete garbage by Dakota Fanning and one of the alternate endings that you can find on the DVD. In the end, it suffers from the use of what is rapidly becoming the most overused horror film twist of the century.The story is about a single dad (DeNiro) who's struggling to bring up his daughter (Fanning). She's a troubled little girl who has apparently made up an imaginary friend to help her get cope with her lack of a mother figure. The problem is that Dakota's imaginary friend keeps threatening to hurt people if Daddy doesn't start paying more attention to Dakota. The body count starts to rise when Daddy tries to send Dakota to a shrink and get her to play nice with the local Milf's kid. We are led to believe that Dakota has suffered some kind of psychotic break and she is actually doing all the murderous things that her imaginary friend is doing. Throughout, DeNiro plays the patient and exasperated father, trying so hard to understand how his little girl could be so twisted. But this is exactly where the movie goes wrong. I found it really hard to believe that Daddy would be so understanding when his daughter kills the family cat and then shoves the nice blonde hot Milf lady, Elizabeth Shue, out the window. All dad does is send her to her room with no supper.It turns out that Daddy's lack of reaction to the murders is because of the big plot twist. If you intend on watching this movie and you want to be surprised... well, you're out of luck. The twist is telegraphed pretty early on. But if you want to try and figure it out for yourself, you should stop reading this review now because here comes the big reveal:Daddy is actually the imaginary friend.After this weak I'm-the-killer-and-didn't-know-it revelation, we are expected to buy that Daddy was going around killing the cat and shoving Shue out the window and he was completely oblivious to the fact that he was actually the killer. Oh, how I wish that Hollywood would stop using this device. It's so cheap, and it's such a convenient and weak way of resolving the story. You might as well tell me it was all a dream. These movies make me so angry. Just when I was starting to think that the writer was really going to have to be clever to create a solid resolution, it turns into a Twilight Zone episode. When you lead me down the road through this long, taut thriller and then reveal in the end that there really wasn't a bad guy, it's kind of a letdown. It worked in ANGEL HEART, people. That was like twenty years ago. It has not worked in a horror movie since. Well, I take that back. It worked in HAUTE TENSION, but it doesn't work in IDENTITY, SECRET WINDOW, THE MACHINIST and especially not in HIDE AND SEEK.This lame reveal is so clich&eacute; now that I don't even know if you could consider it a twist at all. In fact, I think that this twist might be my new pet peeve, worse even than the Occurrence at Owl Creek I'm-Dead-and-Don't-Know-it reveal. Yes, I think that the I'm-the-killer reveal is just a little bit worse. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, there are several alternate endings that are included on the DVD. There is one ending with Dakota Fanning that almost pulls this movie out of the fire. It still doesn't excuse the use of this tired old twist, but it made me feel less angry.

The plot makes no sense, it's predictable, etc. But, having said that, I really liked it.Negatives:1) Robert DeNiro's talent is wasted in this movie. They could have gotten any generic actor to do that role and nothing would have been lost.2) The 'surprise twists' are painfully obvious. Unless this is the first movie you've ever seen, you'll probably be able to anticipate all the surprises within the first few minutes of the movie.3) It isn't scary.4) There's no real logic to this movie. Once it's over, if you stop and think about what just happened, you'll realize there's no way it makes any sense at all. I can't elaborate without giving away the 'surprise' twists, but trust me on this one.5) This is a somewhat minor point, but in the alternative endings, there's no continuity. Example: A woman opens a door. It's a normal door. Then, when she closes it, it's got a window in it, which is the payoff to another 'surprise twist.' But that window wasn't there 2 minutes ago when she opened the door. They switched doors, in other words. So, that's not really playing fair, is it?Positives:Dakota Fanning.That girl is fun to watch. She's actually pretty hilarious most of the time, though I don't think that was the intention, because she's such a little brat! Example: Her dad has a new ladyfriend over for dinner and Dakota tells her in this morose, monotone, while looking up at her with those big, weary eyes, ""My mommy killed herself. Hope the same thing doesn't happen to you.""Ooh!!! Give that girl a time out!!!Anyway, really, if you have incredibly low expectations, you may enjoy this movie.

900400,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00092ZLS0,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","HIDE AND SEEK is a multileveled film that raises as many questions as it answers. Even the screenwriter Ari Schlossberg and director John Polson seem as though they weren't sure about the mysterious workings of their characters: there are four alternative endings on the DVD, each of which suggests something much different than the final moments of this sleekly drawn suspense thriller. I like that!  This is a story that the audience will feel seduced by the odd behaviors of ALL of the characters: everyone is suspect for the spooky derring-do that fills this film.Psychologist Dr. David Calloway (Robert DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) are decimated by their discovery of the apparent suicide of their wife/mother Alison (Amy Irving) and against the advice of David's fellow psychologist Katherine (Famke Janssen), they move to a spooky old house in the woods of upstate New York.  Emily remains withdrawn, electing to be friends only with 'Charley', a probable fictive ideation.  Neighbors (Melissa Leo and Robert John Burke) extend kindness but at the same time are a bit ominous.  Even the sheriff (Dylan Baker) and the realtor (David Chandler) are weird.  The only bit of light in this disturbed household radiates from Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue) who offers friendship but whom Emily dislikes because she sees her as a threat to her father's memory of the deceased mother.Bizarre and heinous incidents happen with more and more regularity, each time the tragic situations attributed to Emily are blamed on her friend Charley. When everyone outside the house become suspect the story really takes a turn that results in the unsuspected ending.More than just a strange scary movie about the game of hide and seek this is a rather disturbing document on the extremes that mental illness can cause.  The capable roles growth and change between DeNiro and Fanning is superb and while there may be a little too much for the average movie buff to swallow, the points are well presented. Give this little thriller a chance and see if you can diagnose the endings - better than the filmmakers could! Not a great movie, but at least as good as others in this genre, plus it has the bonus of DeNiro and Fanning!

This is one such movie.After the apparant suicide of his wife, David (Robert DeNiro) a phsycologist decides it best to move his daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) out from their familiar New York City home to the country side feeling that the change of scenery will help his daughter adjust to life without her mother.Into a few days, Emily developes a disturbing friendship with the unseen ""Charlie"" who David feels is an imaginary friend thought up by his daughter to place responsibility of his wife's death onto him, but not directly from Emily. Only, when David slides on his music to write in his journal about Emily's trauma, does Charlie and Emily begin to play extremely chilling games.There are a bit too many characters thrown into the story to obviously keep you clueless, which is no surprise that these characters really do not weave with the story, they barely flow which makes their motives for potentially being ""Charlie"" pretty weak.Over all, Dakota Fanning is completely creepy, but that doesn't keep the story from being dreadfully long to the point. I understand it's keeping with such slow paced psychological thrillers like The Shinning and Taxi Driver, but it turns out to be simply... long.Perhaps there are just too many movies out there like this to be original.

Fanning has no friends there and soon a friend named Charlie enters the picture. However she's the only one that sees him. When weird things start to happen in the house Deniro suspects Fanning because she's the only other person there. She puts the blame on her friend Charlie though which makes Deniro think she needs to speak to a shrink for kids. The under-rated  Famke Janssen (X-Men and Nip/Tuck season 2) plays the shrink who wants to help Fanning. Elisabeth Shue (Leaving Las Vegas)  also stars as a women who starts dating Deniro. At dinner Fanning warns Shue that she might wind up like her mother. Fanning pulls off scenes like that great. She's pretty creepy in this movie.The movie is well paced and well acted but the trailer itself never left much for the imagination. I mean it takes the surprise out of Shue's characters fate and what even happens to her. Plus when the sheriff asks Fanning what she's drawing and says ""you dieing"". Well then you know his fate as well. So the trailer doesn't leave many surprises. Plus is disapointing to me that it's not the ""my imaginary friend is the killer"" kind of movie I expected. I mean I can't really think of any movies that had that concept. So it could've been a great idea for a horror movie. Don't get me wrong, that's half way the idea of this movie but it doesn't go all the way with it. It's a shame because Fanning is in top form here and could've really done something with that. If it did this could've been the next Sitxh Sense. The twist still is decent though I guess. if you never saw Secret Window you might even see the twist as original...

900414,A2GAK89B29KSKX,B00092ZLS0,"J. Kruppa ""JKruppa""","[14, 19]","After seeing a film as bad as Hide and Seek, I have to wonder how a script this implausible not only got green-lighted by a studio but also made it all the way through pre-production, rehearsals -  hell, any brush with intelligent life - without someone pointing out flaws so obvious they fairly reach out and smack you in the face.  How does a script like this get filmed?  How did Robert DeNiro and Famke Janssen, both of whom I'm willing to bet are reasonably bright people, read through this script without having violent reactions to its profound awfulness?I've been twisting my brain into ever more painful knots over the past few days trying to answer those questions as well as make sense of the internal logic which the screenwriter brought into being with his dumbfoundingly non-twist of a twist climax, and for my effort I have realized two things.  One: this film HAS no internal logic, and two: you shouldn't apply more thought trying to understand a movie than its author did in writing it.The quick and dirty of the plot:  psychologist David's wife apparently commits suicide by slashing her wrists in the bathtub, but not before tucking in their daughter, Emily, with the foreboding line, ""I want you to know I love you more than anything in the world"" (as I heard this in the film, I remember thinking, ""well that's it, mom's about to off herself"").  David decides that what a traumatized Emily needs is a move to the country, and move he does, to a summer community in upstate New York that's conveniently in the midst of a desolate off-season (ooo creepy). The fact that David picks for the two of them a house big enough for the Brady Bunch is only one of many points that defies understanding.  Ignore the slightly strange neighbors, the sherriff and the custodian, all of whom seem to have knowledge of something disturbing (they don't).  Trouble yourself not all all with that spooky cave where something sinister seems to be lurking (there isn't).  These things simply exist to suggest that the identity of Emily's new ""imaginary"" friend is much more horrifying than it turns out to be, even after said friend starts redecorating David's bathroom in progressively bloody fashion.I will withhold further criticism for screenwriter Ari Schlossberg, the prime architect for this mess, if only to save room for criticism of director John Polson, who clearly exhausted himself avoiding every opportunity to put something interesting onscreen.  Take a load off, Mr Polson.  You've done a stellar job collecting a paycheck for absolutely no reason I can discern by watching the final print of the film.  Even half-conscious filmgoers will very early on get a clue what they're in for when Mr Polson stages the painful horror movie clich&eacute; of a false scare involving (you guessed it) the family cat.  One point of head-scratching absurdity is the regular appearance of Elizabeth Shue's cleavage in an environment where everyone else is bundled up warm in sweaters (apparently Shue's character doesn't let cold weather get in the way of showing off the effects of her miracle bra).Hide and Seek's greatest dishonesty is in leading us to believe it is a horror film for 75% of its length, and then suddenly expecting us to be wowed by the revelation that we've really been watching a psychological thriller.  The by-product of this ineffective gambit is a whole trunkload of infuriating loose ends, nearly all borne of earlier red herrings meant to distract us from the ""true"" meaning of what we've been seeing.  Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy, and just plain incompetent, filmmaking.Dakota Fanning is getting some good reviews for managing to be the most effective thing in the movie (as if that took much effort), but her talent is a complete waste in this director's hands.  Fanning's perplexing, suggestive reaction shots earlier in the film, all loaded with apparent meaning, seem entirely incongruous once the plot twist arrives.  And contrary to what some other reviewers have asserted, a second viewing will not reveal how the twist is foreshadowed, will not show how all the pieces fit together, will not evoke a reaction of, ""ah, now it all makes sense."" Anyone who says otherwise is betraying an inability to think critically and has clearly seen none of the many films that outdo this one in style, suspense and intelligence.Ultimately, Robert DeNiro must be singled out for lowering himself one more rung down the ladder of despair by starring in this film (and being out-acted, not just a little, by a ten year old).  It doesn't take much imagination to realize that DeNiro's performance as Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver is infinitely more frightening than his comatose scenes in the final act of this film.  That, friends, is the real horror story:  how a once-great presence has shrunk to something as dull and stupid as this.",1,Dreadful,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,4853,"['seeing', 'film', 'as', 'bad',

We need to believe that we are in capable hands that will introduce us to characters and situations that make perfect sense, and that events will follow one another with unyielding logic.At first, I felt that a decision made early in the film was a decision that was outside the ""trust"" I described above. Toward the end of the film, I realized that the decision was OK - even though I thought it was a bad idea on the filmmaker's part to make that particular decision. I wish that the screenwriters had worked harder to come up with a different way to get from point A to point B. The problem with the ""real"" decision was that I lost faith in the director/story almost immediately because it appeared - at the time - to be utterly ridiculous.There was a scene where a cat came jumping out of a closet for shock value, and my lord, I can't count the number of times where that tired old trick has been used. Whenever that happens, I immediately think that someone's being lazy and can't come up with a better way to give the audience a quick scare. Besides - it's quite awful to leave a cat locked up in a closet because they tend to start using it as their bathroom, and you just can't get cat pee out of *anything*.As the movie progressed, it began to move in a fairly reasonable logic flow, and I started to gain trust in the director/story again, even though there were some unnecessary characters and scenes.Dakota Fanning (Emily), is an amazing actress whose ability to portray a wide range of emotions that many actors and actresses with years more training and experience would give their left foot for, is the perfect character for the part. We see her happy, we see her completely dead inside, and we see her unbearably terrified. Her tremors and tears are terrors ring true. She is the best actor in the film. (Which is saying quite a bit.)The movie is about a man whose wife dies and he moves to the country to help his daughter cope. This didn't make sense to me, because as a psychologist, the father, David, (DeNiro), should have known that was just plain stupid. We don't see many emotions from DeNiro after his wife dies, and that too disturbed me. Again - I didn't feel in capable hands, so I questioned everything that looked wrong.While in a beautiful house in the country, Emily has what everyone calls an imaginary friend - Charlie. David is frustrated by this, and has a few conversations with a former student of his that is close to Emily.And that's where the story starts to pick up. Charlie is more and more a part of Emily's life, and David feels isolated.In the end, it seemed that the movie was going for a ""Sixth Sense"" feel, and it almost achieved it, but fell short. We're shown the obligatory flashbacks, but they aren't as convincing, shocking, or as immediately understood  as those that occurred in Shyamalan's film. (I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" in the theater in its opening weekend. As I'm hard of hearing, I wear headsets that, thankfully, drown out idiots who like to talk through films. However, those headsets couldn't keep me from hearing the shocked gasps from the audience. It's a shame that Shyamalan has been trying to recreate that same shock in the rest of his films, because he's failed miserably.) If ""Hide and Seek"" wasn't incorporating the elemental template of ""The Sixth Sense"", it would have made for a more interesting film. Or if ""The Sixth Sense"" had never been made, it might have been more interesting. But I don't think it would have been much more interesting, because as I said, the flashbacks and the shocks that those flashbacks were supposed to cause fell short.Case in point: ""The Sixth Sense"" has a rating of 8.2 on imdb.pro, and Hide and Seek has a rating of 5.5. I tend to trust those ratings, because members of imdb.pro are film aficionados, and thousands of people (129,000 for SS and 13,600 for HaS) cast votes. It's a good sample.",2,"Let's play Hide and Seek with the DVD, and pretend we can't find it",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,3998,"['important', 'director', 'immediately', 'establish', 'level', 'trust', 'audience', 'need', 'believe', 'are', 'capable', 'hands', 'will', 'introduce', 'characters', 'situations', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'events', 'will', 'follow', 'one', 'unyielding', 'logic.At', 'first', 'felt', 'decision', 'made', 'early', 'film', 'was', 'decision', 'was', 'trust', 'described', 'above', 'end', 'film', 'realized', 'decision', 'was', 'OK', 'even', 'thought', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'filmmaker', 'part', 'make', 'particular', 'decision', 'wish', 'screenwriters', 'had', 'worked', 'harder', 'come', 'up', 'different', 'way', 'get', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'problem', 'real', 'decision', 'was', 'lost', 'faith', 'director/story', 'almost', 'immediately', 'appeared', 'time', 'be', 'utterly', 'ridiculous.There', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'cat', 'came', 'jumping', 'closet', 'shock', 'value', 'lord', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'number', 'times', 'where', 'tired', 'old', 'trick', 'been', 'used', 'Whenever', 'immediately', 'think', 'someone', 'being', 'lazy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'way', 'give', 'audience', 'quick', 'scare', 'quite', 'awful', 'leave', 'cat', 'locked', 'up', 'closet', 'tend', 'start', 'using', 'bathroom', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'cat', 'pee', '*anything*.As', 'movie', 'progressed', 'began', 'move', 'fairly', 'reasonable', 'logic', 'flow', 'started', 'gain', 'trust', 'director/story', 'again', 'even', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'scenes.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Emily', 'amazing', 'actress', 'ability', 'portray', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'years', 'more', 'training', 'experience', 'would', 'give', 'left', 'foot', 'perfect', 'character', 'part', 'see', 'happy', 'see', 'completely', 'dead', 'inside', 'see', 'unbearably', 'terrified', 'tremors', 'tears', 'are', 'terrors', 'ring', 'true', 'best', 'actor', 'film', 'Which', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'man', 'wife', 'dies', 'country', 'help', 'daughter', 'cope', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'psychologist', 'father', 'David', 'DeNiro', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'emotions', 'DeNiro', 'wife', 'dies', 'too', 'disturbed', 'Again', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'capable', 'hands', 'questioned', 'everything', 'looked', 'wrong.While', 'beautiful', 'house', 'country', 'Emily', 'what', 'everyone', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'David', 'frustrated', 'few', 'conversations', 'former', 'student', 'close', 'Emily.And', 'where', 'story', 'pick', 'up', 'Charlie', 'more', 'more', 'part', 'Emily', 'life', 'David', 'feels', 'isolated.In', 'end', 'seemed', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'feel', 'almost', 'achieved', 'fell', 'short', ""'re"", 'shown', 'obligatory', 'flashbacks', 'are', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'shocking', 'immediately', 'understood', 'occurred', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'saw', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'theater', 'opening', 'weekend', ""'m"", 'hard', 'hearing', 'wear', 'headsets', 'thankfully', 'drown', 'out', 'idiots', 'who', 'like', 'talk', 'films', 'However', 'headsets', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hearing', 'shocked', 'gasps', 'audience', 'shame', 'Shyamalan', 'been', 'trying', 'recreate', 'same', 'shock', 'rest', 'films', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'was', ""n't"", 'incorporating', 'elemental', 'template', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'interesting', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'said', 'flashbacks', 'shocks', 'flashbacks', 'were', 'supposed', 'cause', 'fell', 'short.Case', 'point', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'rating', '8.2', 'imdb.pro', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'rating', '5.5', 'tend', 'trust', 'ratings', 'members', 'imdb.pro', 'are', 'film', 'aficionados', 'thousands', 'people', '129,000', 'SS', '13,600', 'HaS', 'cast', 'votes', 'good', 'sample']",N/A

This is a waste of Robert Deniro's talents and Dakota Fanning's talents, They have worked long and hard and made great movies and they make this crap? Well, I hate this movie with a passion. I thought it was boring, it had no scares, thrills, nudity, or any cussing. It should be G for god sakes, It was not that scary as People are saying it was. I felt that the critics kissed it too much by comparing it to the likes of Pyscho and The Shining(???).The movie stars Robert Deniro as David Callaway, a psychologist, who witnesses with his only daughter, the brutal suicide of his wife. So, He decides to go to some woods and start fresh with his daughter,Emily(Dakota Fanning). Then David starts seeing signs in the bathroom that somebody knows that what he has done and his Daughter all the sudden, has this playmate named Charlie. Then the problems get worse, Emily tries to scare off Elizabeth, who Emily thinks is replacing her mother, with the grusome details of her mom's sucide, and David doesn't condone it and tries to talk to her and see who is making her act this way, she says her imaginary friend Charlie. Charlie isn't your ordinary run of the mill imaginary friend. He is a sick demented fake person that is making all the signs and killing off the family cat and David's girlfriend.by the way, you will be pissed at the ending, I was too, and The trailer(if you have seen it), reveals too much about ending.

His acting is very unbelievable as if he isn't even in the room. It's almost like he isn't even trying. I am used to De Niro doing various roles over the years such as Meet the Parents/Fockers and Analyze This/That but this was one role he should have let go by. As for Dakota Fanning, she was way to young to attempt a role like this. If her manager was trying to expand her resume with this film, they failed. She just couldn't pull it off. She needs to work her way to roles like this. The film had possibilites and I think with different actors and some tweaking of the script it could have been a decent film.

Sure not everybody has to like his films but his acting ability is a diffrent matter completley, in my opinion you cannot fault the man's acting, he does every scene perfectly and you couldn't change it and make it better, especially in this film.

It's better than De Niro's other recent thriller, which involved cloning(the title escapes me right now).  But in the long run, it's just another run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter thrill flick.Dakota Fanning is sufficient as DeNiro's daughter who has become rather silent and stand-offish since walking in on her mother's successful suicide attempt.  DeNiro moves to the country hoping to bring her out of her shell.  Unfortunately for the both of them, Fanning finds a new ""imaginary"" friend who commits some rather ghastly deeds and makes her take the blame.  Famke Janssen plays Fanning's psychiatrist and close friend and former student of DeNiro.  Elizabeth Shue has a small role as a country local who DeNiro has a sweet spot for.The climax of the film is what makes it fail in the end.  It sort of ruins the ""evil"" atmosphere that is set by Fanning's creepy performance.Only recommended to fans of DeNiro and modest thrillers.

I am not just trying to be cruel to this film, I really wanted it to be good, but it was not original, it was not executed very well and in the end you are dissapointed when you find out who the killer is.  This is the problem with these types of films, there is no more suprise.  This is why these films will continue to do horrible at the box office because they are just cheap imitations of original creative moives.  Enough already!  By no means would I suggest that box office sales are an indication of a good movie.

I haven't seen very many of her films, just ""I am Sam"" ""Man on Fire"" and-regrettably- ""Trapped"" & ""Cat in the Hat"" ""Hide and Seek"" seemed like it would be a considerable change of pace for Miss Fanning, and indeed it was. However, she was more than equal to the challenge. It seems like she can do anything if given the chance. For instance, she proved she could play a surprisingly effective kidnap victim in ""Man on Fire"" because the filmmakers gave her more to do than whine for mommy and look cute and helpless as she was forced to do in ""Trapped."" Here, Dakota plays COMPLETELY against type as a seemingly evil child. Her eyes which are normally bright and vibrant are now simultaneously blank and penetrating. Still, ""Hide and Seek"" as a whole is nearly godawful. While it has some inventive ideas (the stabbing scene in the flipbook) it is mostly made up of elements borrowed from much better films. Although I must say, there are sone utterly tense moments, moments in which we anticipate danger that never comes. These scenes are very difficult to manage and are unworthy of the rest of the film. As for the ""jump scenes"" I am no judge, everything startles me. The ""twist"" is predictable, I guessed it as soon as the advertisements warned you about it. Dakota does not belong in such threadbare material, and as much as I hate to say it, if she isn't careful and keeps taking roles where she MUST carry these mediocre films she just might end up like her co-star.

900441,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00092ZLS0,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","Let me cut to the chase. This film did not, at all, meet my expectations. The trailers lead one to believe that it is a film with supernatural overtones, but it turns out to be something else all together. The story line seems simple on its face. Alison Callaway (Amy Irving), a wife and loving mother, unexpectedly decides to slit her wrist in the bathtub one night, killing herself. Her husband, psychologist David Callaway, comes upon her lifeless body, and so does their beloved daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning). Emily goes into shock and comes under the care of a therapist named Katherine (Famke Janssen).Sometime later, when Emily's condition seemingly improves, her father then decides to leave New York City, where they live, and relocate to a small upstate town. No sooner do they move there, they meet the real estate agent and the town's sheriff, both of whom seem a tad peculiar. Moreover, there appears to be something not quite right with the couple next door, especially the husband. When Emily starts talking about an ostensibly imaginary friend named Charlie, the viewer knows that something is afoot. When David develops a new friend of his own, Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue), trouble lies ahead, as Emily exhibits bizarre behavior towards her, as well as towards Elizabeth's young niece who is trying to befriend her.As Charlie appears to be becoming an ever present and ominous entity in their lives, and Emily's odd behavior continues unabated, David remains the most kind, concerned, and understanding of fathers. He contacts Emily's therapist Katherine, who is very concerned about the eccentric behavior Emily is exhibiting. Meanwhile, the male neighbor interjects himself into the picture in a seemingly ominous way. So, David, who is also having flashbacks of events involving his wife, appears to have his hands full on the home front. By the time things start to go totally askew, the viewer can pretty much guess what the final denouement will be.Despite its great cast and excellent performances, the script is weak and leaves a lot to be desired. It cheats the viewer with its subplots that go nowhere and are used merely to create red herrings for the sake of creating them. The film ends up being no more than total nonsense. Ari Schlossberg, the screenwriter, has made the mistake of underestimating the intelligence of the average viewer who would go to see a film starring Robert De Niro. Not even De Niro's otherwise fine performance can elevate this film to more than what it is, which is a far cry from what it promised in its trailers.This is not a film worth adding to one's personal collection.

Perhaps because it IS so mild, the climactic revelations aren't nearly as shocking as director John Polson and screenwriter Ari Schlossberg might have hoped, and the narrative builds to a lacklustre conclusion. DeNiro is miscast as the 'saintly' psychologist who tolerates his daughter's worst excesses, and the glossy production values are wasted. Also starring Famke Janssen as a fellow psychologist, and a virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving as DeNiro's ill-fated wife.

Robert De Niro plays a psychologist whose wife suicided and he was left with a 10y old daughter Emily (great role of Dakota Fanning). The poor kid was totally traumatised by the suicide of her mother and her father didn't find anything better that to quit New York and buy a big, old, creepy house in a very small town, mostly empty, except in the summer (and it is a windy, cold automn when he moves there). That is really smart for a psychologist...But finally I decided to watch it a little bit more and I was rewarded with a second half of the movie which was MUCH much better... in fact, because of a totally unsuspected twist, the first half of the movie immediately appeared in a very different light. And just for once, I started to be really concerned about the little girl safety, and I was right to be concerned... This movie uses some really pretty decoys to confuse us about what exactly is going on in this creepy house... and when the blow lands, I actually gasped with shock. No hints except this one - it is clear, that this movie was made AFTER ""The sixth sense""...Now, I am not saying this is a masterpiece or a great film - but still it is very watchable, and Robert de Niro and Dakota Fanning give a great show.

Much more frightening than a snarling, dripping beast is the sight of the closet itself, slighty ajar, and filled with all possible terrors of which your mind can conceive.After a decade or so of slasher flicks and in-your-face gore, Hitchcockian terror is making a comeback, and ""Hide and Seek"" is a great example of the revival.Not that it's short on fright. On the contrary, it's filled with scenes that will make you come out of your seat as though you'd sat on a hornet. This is a flick that will make you uncomfortable from the start. What you don't see can hurt you and there is plenty of those unseen dangers here.It's not the creature that crawls from under the bed, but the bed itelf. Something MIGHT be there and that lurking possibility with cause your muscles to knot and your fingers to clench tighter around your date's hand. It's not a mutant freak that lives in the basement, but what MIGHT live in the basement that gets you. This is a movie that causes your imagination to betray you and it does  it deftly, with ample darkness and creeking doors and shadows that move just on the edge of vision.There is a scene in the movie where Elisabeth Shue playfully pulls open a closet door in an attempt to endear herself to the child. When she does, it... Man, that scene alone is worth the price of admission.De Niro is as believable as a pained child psychologist as he is as a mafia henchman, a beleaguered boxing champ, or a menacing ex-con. I mean, does he actually get shorter for some roles?Fanning is talented beyond her years, with expressions and inflections of her voice that will make you sad, make you mad or wrap your spine in ice.For outright fright, this one scores high.

The death of her mother has affected Emily, and her father finds her very withdrawn and not herself.  She lashes out at David's female friend Elizabeth (Shue), detailing her mother's suicide in an attempt to scare her off.  The only happiness she finds is from her new imaginary friend, Charlie.  But Charlie is not the nice sort of imaginary friend.  He writes accusations on the bathroom walls for David to find, and kills the family cat.  David refuses to hospitalize Emily for her imaginary friend's actions, hoping that things will get better on their own.  But they don't, and Charlie becomes a force that must be reckoned with.""Hide and Seek"" is a movie that desperately wants to be better than it is, but director John Polson is no master cratsman, and the big reveal, when it comes, is not really a surprise.  In addition, all the goodwill built up in the first 2/3 of the movie evaporates quickly as ""Hide and Seek"" degenerates into standard horror movie cliches.  The time between revelation and end of the movie is too great to maintain the tension, and the second twist leaves you shaking your head.Forget DeNiro, Dakota Fanning is the star of this movie, and the best reason to go see it.  It is hard to believe that so young an actress can carry an entire movie, but carry it she does.  Any faults are the script's and director's.  Fanning is convincing as the girl who is haunted by her mother's death and an unstable imaginary friend.  She deserves more than the final product delivers.",3,Hide and Seek,1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,1650,"['wife', 'kills', 'psychologist', 'David', 'Callaway', 'DeNiro', 'only', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'Fanning', 'move', 'secluded', 'house', 'start', 'fresh', 'death', 'mother', 'affected', 'Emily', 'father', 'very', 'withdrawn', 'not', 'out', 'David', 'female', 'friend', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'detailing', 'mother', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'scare', 'off', 'only', 'happiness', 'new', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'not', 'nice', 'sort', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'accusations', 'bathroom', 'walls', 'David', 'find', 'family', 'cat', 'David', 'hospitalize', 'Emily', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'actions', 'hoping', 'things', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'Charlie', 'force', 'must', 'be', 'reckoned', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'movie', 'desperately', 'be', 'better', 'director', 'John', 'Polson', 'master', 'cratsman', 'big', 'reveal', 'when', 'not', 'really', 'surprise', 'addition', 'goodwill', 'built', 'up', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', 'quickly', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'standard', 'horror', 'movie', 'cliches', 'time', 'revelation', 'end', 'movie', 'too', 'great', 'maintain', 'tension', 'second', 'twist', 'shaking', 'head.Forget', 'DeNiro', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'star', 'movie', 'best', 'reason', 'go', 'see', 'hard', 'believe', 'so', 'young', 'actress', 'can', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'carry', 'Any', 'faults', 'are', 'script', 'director', 'Fanning', 'convincing', 'girl', 'who', 'haunted', 'mother', 'death', 'unstable', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'more', 'final', 'product', 'delivers']",N/A

But you could really see what was going to happen with his character a mile away.  Dakota Fanning did an excellent job with her part, and was really able to convey a range of emotions that someone her age usually could not pull off.  It is in part because of that you could tell what would happen with De Niro's character.  Her reactions to him were perfect.The rest of the film however was pretty formulaic.  From the potential love interest, the creepy next door neighbor, mistrusting sheriff.  I just think that there was not a ton of originality to the script.  A lot of that got saved by the acting, but it could have been better.  It is worth taking a look at.  The DVD gives you the options of seeing the movie with alternate endings.

Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[4, 5]","When you have rented a video, have you ever felt like once you watched the entire product you rented that you never thought you'd watch it again for a long time? Well, HIDE AND SEEK happens to be that kind of a movie. It's premise is very tantalizing, its actors are quite solid in their roles, and the twist is somewhat satisfying, while the last shot of the film leaves chills down your spine. HIDE AND SEEK, while a satisfying, does have some holes from time to time that don't keep it from being a good movie...just not a great one.Robert De Niro plays David, a well-respected psychologist who has a cute little daughter, Emily, played by Dakota Fanning. His wife, it seems, committed suicide due to the recent trials of their marriage, which in turn seems to be unwinding at a steady pace in the beginning. David is horrified one night waking up and discovering his wife in a blood-soaked bathtub, with poor Emily shocked and in a complete state of disbelief from what she has seen.We pick up some time later with Emily in a children's hospital working with a staff member (Famke Jennsen, in fine form here) who's trying to help Emily cope with the loss of her mother, while David tries his best to keep being as good a father as he can be. David decides that he and Emily should move somewhere quieter and more peaceful to start fresh, and they move into a new house by a lake which draws a crowd during summertimes. Things seem to go from weird, to worse, as David and Emily grow further apart. Emily, however, develops a friendship with her new imaginary friend, ""Charlie"", who seems to make her very happy. But ""Charlie"" isn't interested in harmless child's play and things soon go to worse as after David meets the sweet Elizabeth (Elisabeth Shue, once again acing her acting), ""Charlie"" begins making bad things happen because he seems to hate David. The rest of the movie plays like an M. Night Shymalan thriller, leaving you guessing what will happen next. Some parts seem tepid and slow, but the ""twist"" will leave you guessing until it happens. The last shot of the film has Emily and her new friend, the staff member, living together, and while Emily loves to draw, her drawing ultimately leaves the movie open for a sequel, which is yet to appear. I won't give it away but let's just say you'll be left chilled to the bone when you see the ""drawing"".Dakota Fanning is in superb form here, and at first you want to hate her character so much for the way she treats her father, but as the movie goes along, especially later in the second half, you start to wonder if she's the one you should be afraid for. Nevertheless, she's a pro in this movie, bringing one bone-chilling and rock-solid performance to the table here. Great job kid!!So if you're looking to kill 100 minutes on a Saturday night and get some good chills, HIDE AND SEEK might just be right up your alley.

900461,A21G4TR1PBPS7H,B00092ZLS0,Movie_Fan,"[9, 10]","This movie starts off with the death of Emily's (Dakota Fanning) mother.  Wanting to get away from it all, she and her father (De Niro), move to the country.  There she finds friendship in an imaginary friend she calls Charlie.  Strange, creepy things start happening, writing on walls, people dying, dolls defaced, etc...The movie pretends to play out on the psychological effect of grief, which here came from the death of the mother.  I don't want to spoil the movie, so I'll just say that one form we see comes in the shape of Emily's reclusiveness.But unfortunately, it's just that, it pretends...there's no REAL psychological depth to the movie, which is too bad, otherwise it wouldn't have been that bad.The movie plays out fairly predictably, in the sense that you can tell who is going to die and who isn't.  Now I know this is supposed to be scary or something along those lines, but I just thought it failed at that.  I was bored out of my mind during the first half of the movie, and then when things got a little ""juicier"", the answers came along relatively fast and it's a little dissapointing.Without revealing anything, I'll just say that I thought the ending was just bad.  It looked like a bad wannabe version of the Sixth Sense, or worse, The Village.  We're also left with holes with some of the characters, notably the neighbors.However, this movie does have something going for it : Its cast.  Dakota Fanning carries this whole movie, she's great.  While I'm not the biggest fan of DeNiro, he's also good, even more so when you take the whole of the movie into consideration.  The supporting cast (Elisabeth Shue and Famke Janssen) breezes through as well.My only recommendation is that if you want to be scared, you'd be better off walking around your neighborhood at 2 o'clock in the morning than watching this movie, most likely because I found it amusing more than anything else.",1,Traumatically bad,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,1905,"['movie', 'death', 'Emily', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'mother', 'Wanting', 'get', 'away', 'father', 'De', 'Niro', 'move', 'country', 'friendship', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Strange', 'creepy', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'writing', 'walls', 'people', 'dying', 'dolls', 'defaced', 'etc', 'movie', 'play', 'out', 'psychological', 'effect', 'grief', 'here', 'came', 'death', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'one', 'form', 'see', 'shape', 'Emily', 'reclusiveness.But', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'REAL', 'psychological', 'depth', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'bad.The', 'movie', 'out', 'fairly', 'predictably', 'sense', 'can', 'tell', 'who', 'going', 'die', 'who', ""n't"", 'Now', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'scary', 'something', 'lines', 'just', 'thought', 'failed', 'was', 'bored', 'mind', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'then', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'little', 'juicier', 'answers', 'came', 'along', 'relatively', 'fast', 'little', 'dissapointing.Without', 'revealing', 'anything', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'looked', 'bad', 'wannabe', 'version', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'worse', 'Village', ""'re"", 'also', 'left', 'holes', 'characters', 'notably', 'neighbors.However', 'movie', 'have', 'something', 'going', 'cast', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'whole', 'movie', 'great', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'DeNiro', 'also', 'good', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'when', 'take', 'whole', 'movie', 'consideration', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'well.My', 'only', 'recommendation', 'want', 'be', 'scared', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'walking', 'neighborhood', '2', ""o'clock"", 'morning', 'watching', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'found', 'amusing', 'more', 'anything', 'else']",N/A

In Hide and Seek, DeNiro's role choices continue to flounder as he stars in a sub-par horror film.DeNiro plays David, a psychologist whose wife has killed herself in apparent depression.  His daughter Emily (played by Dakota Fanning) sees the body and becomes semi-catatonic.  In a effort to heal, the two move to a new home in a rural community.  Instead of improving, Emily acquires a seemingly invisible friend named Charlie.  Charlie starts out okay, but soon gets increasingly malicious.  The mystery is if Charlie is a real person, a supernatural entity or some dark aspect of Emily's personality.For the first two-thirds of Hide and Seek, we get a strictly by-the-book horror movie, neither particularly good nor bad.  Sadly, everything falls apart at the end as we find out Charlie's true nature.  I won't spoil things by explaining Charlie, but suffice it to say that the explanation involves one of the most tired clich&eacute;s in horror/suspense and also requires deceit and illogic to force a plot twist on the audience.The only plus to this movie is Dakota Fanning, who continues to show that she is the best child actor currently in movies, using actual talent where most kids merely depend on cuteness.  She cannot save this film, however; while at least passable for a while, the conclusion of this movie pushes its overall quality to a weak two stars.

900466,A35TQX4K4RTDA4,B00092ZLS0,"Napoleon Dynamite ""Beef""","[0, 4]","Don't listen to those other reviewers who rate this as a poor, predictable movie.  I think that they're too jaded from seeing lots of movies from this genre and can't appreciate this for the under-praised gem that it is.  Of course there are bits that are common to every horror movie - the cat jumping out of the closet, the manipulative suspense music, and the villain appearing behind the door - but overall ""Hide and Seek"" is well-worth seeing.  There are many twists and creepy moments, and the climax can give you an emotional jolt.  Speaking of which, watch for the last scene.  Some people didn't like it, but it scared me as much as the revelation of Charlie.  Very well done.In case you don't know the plotline, it's pretty simple.  Psychologist David Callahan (Robert Deniro) takes his young daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning) for rehabilitation in the country after her mother is found in their bathtub with her wrists slit.  They settle into a creepy, enormous house in upstate New York, where they are relatively isolated in the woods of a small town.  Though Emily quickly refuses to make friends with other children, she tells her father that she has a new friend named Charlie.  David is a bit concerned about this sudden appearance of an imaginary friend, but takes it in stride with her trauma.  It is only when some strange things begin to happen around the house, all of which that are immediately blamed on Charlie, that David begins to grow suspicious of who or what Charlie really is.Many other reviewers have been comparing this movie and its plot to ""The Shining"" and ""Secret Window"", but I haven't seen either.  The surprise ending that all of these movies seem to have did stay a surprise for me, and it was one that truly scared me.  If you don't want the ending to be given away for you, DO NOT keep reading reviews on this page!  Many, many, many reviewers are spoiling the ending for those who haven't seen it.  If you want to watch this without it being ruined, do not keep reading reviews!  That being said, I thought that the ending worked, and I actually watched the movie twice more to catch all of the clues that were placed throughout.  It makes sense and it certainly gave me a jolt.The acting in this film was well-above average for a movie in the horror or suspense genre.  Directors sometimes get away with poor acting by simply giving viewers pornographic shots of violence and gore, but that isn't the case here.  Deniro was definitely in character and definitely watchable - some of the faces that he made when Emily is blaming everything on Charlie creeped me out.  All of the smaller speaking roles were filled by capable actors - my favorite bit part was actually the town sheriff, though the roles of Elizabeth Young and fellow psychologist Katherine were equally watchable.The real kudos, of course, goes to Dakota Fanning who is rapidly becoming my favorite actress.  Except for ""Cat in the Hat"", which was a clunky script and she the only highlight, she has been in above average movies for her entire short and impressive career.  She doesn't disappoint here and she manages to creep out the audience with her vacant stares, sadistic half-smiles, and panicked fright.  She won the MTV ""Best Frightened Performance"" award for this movie, and it is well-deserved.  Though she was only nine when she made this film, the amount of talent contained in this tiny package is almost palpable.  She is in 95% of this film, and she carries it through every moment.  I highly recommend all of her other films (""War of the Worlds"", ""Man on Fire"", ""I Am Sam"") as well.  Watch this kid - she is going to go far.I don't want to give too much else away, but I don't think that this movie really deserves the ""R"" rating that it got.  They could have scraped a ""PG-13"".  There is only one profanity in the movie and the violence doesn't occur until the last twelve minutes or so.  Don't be turned off by the rating, but I definitely wouldn't show this to kids.",5,A great psychological thriller!,1122595200,"07 29, 2005",2005,3993,"['Do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'rate', 'poor', 'predictable', 'movie', 'think', ""'re"", 'too', 'jaded', 'seeing', 'lots', 'movies', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'under-praised', 'gem', 'course', 'are', 'bits', 'are', 'common', 'horror', 'movie', 'cat', 'jumping', 'closet', 'manipulative', 'suspense', 'music', 'villain', 'appearing', 'door', 'overall', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'well-worth', 'seeing', 'are', 'many', 'twists', 'creepy', 'moments', 'climax', 'can', 'give', 'emotional', 'jolt', 'Speaking', 'watch', 'last', 'scene', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'scared', 'as', 'much', 'revelation', 'Charlie', 'Very', 'well', 'done.In', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'plotline', 'pretty', 'simple', 'Psychologist', 'David', 'Callahan', 'Robert', 'Deniro', 'young', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'rehabilitation', 'country', 'mother', 'found', 'bathtub', 'wrists', 'slit', 'settle', 'creepy', 'enormous', 'house', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'are', 'relatively', 'isolated', 'woods', 'small', 'town', 'Emily', 'quickly', 'make', 'friends', 'other', 'children', 'father', 'new', 'friend', 'named', 'Charlie', 'David', 'bit', 'concerned', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'stride', 'trauma', 'only', 'when', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'house', 'are', 'immediately', 'blamed', 'Charlie', 'David', 'grow', 'suspicious', 'who', 'what', 'Charlie', 'really', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'comparing', 'movie', 'plot', 'Shining', 'Secret', 'Window', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'either', 'surprise', 'ending', 'movies', 'seem', 'have', 'did', 'stay', 'surprise', 'was', 'one', 'truly', 'scared', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ending', 'be', 'given', 'away', 'DO', 'NOT', 'keep', 'reading', 'reviews', 'page', 'Many', 'many', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'spoiling', 'ending', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'want', 'watch', 'being', 'ruined', 'do', 'not', 'keep', 'reading', 'reviews', 'being', 'said', 'thought', 'ending', 'worked', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'twice', 'more', 'catch', 'clues', 'were', 'placed', 'sense', 'certainly', 'gave', 'jolt.The', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'well-above', 'average', 'movie', 'horror', 'suspense', 'genre', 'Directors', 'sometimes', 'get', 'away', 'poor', 'acting', 'simply', 'giving', 'viewers', 'pornographic', 'shots', 'violence', 'gore', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'Deniro', 'was', 'definitely', 'character', 'definitely', 'watchable', 'made', 'when', 'Emily', 'blaming', 'everything', 'Charlie', 'creeped', 'out', 'smaller', 'speaking', 'roles', 'were', 'filled', 'capable', 'actors', 'favorite', 'bit', 'part', 'was', 'actually', 'town', 'sheriff', 'roles', 'Elizabeth', 'Young', 'fellow', 'psychologist', 'Katherine', 'were', 'equally', 'watchable.The', 'real', 'kudos', 'course', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'who', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'favorite', 'actress', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'was', 'clunky', 'script', 'only', 'highlight', 'been', 'above', 'average', 'movies', 'entire', 'short', 'impressive', 'career', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'creep', 'out', 'audience', 'vacant', 'stares', 'sadistic', 'half-smiles', 'panicked', 'fright', 'won', 'MTV', 'Best', 'Frightened', 'Performance', 'award', 'movie', 'well-deserved', 'was', 'only', 'nine', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'amount', 'talent', 'contained', 'tiny', 'package', 'almost', 'palpable', '95', '%', 'film', 'moment', 'highly', 'recommend', 'other', 'films', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Am', 'Sam', 'as', 'well', 'Watch', 'kid', 'going', 'go', 'far.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'else', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'really', 'R', 'rating', 'got', 'could', 'have', 'scraped', 'PG-13', 'only', 'one', 'profanity', 'movie', 'violence', ""n't"", 'occur', 'last', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'so', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'rating', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'kids']",N/A

The basic plot has all the elements of a great thriller.However with Jon Polsen's latest feature film, something happened between page and screen that resulted in a film that falls just short ofthe mark. Robert De Niro is psychiatrist David Callaway who, following the suicide of his wife, moves to the countryside with daughter Emily (Dakota Fanning). Amongst the quiet secrets of this semi-rural community David struggles to protect his daughter whilst searching for an assemblance of life.After inventing a new friend who goes by the name of ""Charlie"", sweet and effected Emily becomes withdrawn and sullen. Strange messages written in blood are found by David along with the occasional corpse turning up in the bathroom. Emily claims Charlie is responsible and David is beside himself as it seems his daughter is not only losing her mind but is perhaps even becoming psychotic.Hide and Seek will have you guessing to the end. The final twist is a rather ingenious resolution to the story and does have its merits, even if a suspension of belief is needed.De Niro is a pack-horse in this production, carrying a great deal of the film on his own. Fanning is endearing and odd enough to make us curious to the end.

She likes creepy flicks far more than I do.  This one wasn't bad, but it didn't grab me either.  If anything, I found it a bit disturbing.I want to be very careful not to give anything away, because this is one of those mind-twister, big ending movies along the lines of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Village"".  Like those other films, this is one where everything seems normal on its face, all the laws of physics are operating normally, yet there appears to be no rational explanation for why these ""paranormal"" events are occurring.  It's only toward the end that a significant truth is revealed that turns all this on its head, and makes all the unusual stuff fit together in a nice neat little package.Overall I would say this story is reasonably suspenseful and has some eerie elements to it that are only semi-predictable and modestly cliche -- for example, the door with eerie light glowing around it.  There are some moderately graphic death scenes which I don't recommend for the kiddies.  Like ""The Village"", I thought the ""big secret"" was given away a little too soon.  From there the story degenerated into a chase sequence more reminiscent of Stephen King's ""The Shining"".  I thought DeNiro did a bang-up job in a wide-ranging role that really carried an otherwise mediocre story.Would I recommend this movie?  &lt;Shrug>  I dunno.

Dakota Fanning and Robert De Niro would put you on the edge on this fast pace, and full of suspense movie.David Callaway (Robert De Niro), a widower, who happens to be a psychologist, takes on the role to help his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), to go through the trauma of the death of her mother, Alison (Amy Irving). He even move them away from the city and into the country in this particular isolated house to heal. Things turn for the worse when Emily starts getting this gothic drained look, with dark circles under her eyes, more withdrawn and it gets creepier when she develops an imaginary friend, name Charlie. Things gets odd with David having weird dreams involving his late wife, and the house seems to have an unknown intruder, making Charlie a bit more real than being just an imaginary friend for Emily. Anything gone wrong in the house Emily keeps on blaming Charlie and there always seems to be something about. The only time Emily seems to be at least normal is when Katherine (Famke Janssen), her shrink is around. Don't miss the twisted plot now.As much as most people hope it's a horror, I'm sorry to say it's more a mystery & thriller sort of movie, so don't complained if you're looking for horror and gets disappointed after watching this movie.

Your expectations grow, it ticles down your spine, you try to figure out every possibility for a completed plot -but what happens? It seems like halfway into the movie the writer and director run out of ideas, and you are served perhaps a surprise ending (because it doesn't make much sence as being interesting as I've mentioned or even a bit believable). And it's a bit sad, because are you a fan of the genre the movie (however ""used"" in script, and far from being revelutionary) I guarantee you that you will not be bored a second. Well, perhaps until you get the plot that is. It went downhills from here. For me.But; It's not the worst movie I've ever seen. No waste of time. ""Hide And Seek"" with its' quality-cast and quality-directing is entertaining from start to finnish. It's just not very interesting. And they should have come up with something far better as an outcome than they did.But I must add that it has ""stolen"" so much from so many similiar thrillers. Spooky child, big house in the woods, disturbing characters ment for distracting the audience from figuring out the plot too soon, all in all -nothing new, no classic.

After watching the movie, I didn't find it as great as I had hoped I would, but nevertheless, I did enjoy watching it.`Hide and Seek' starts off with The Callaway family having fun and leading a normal life. David (Robert De Niro), the husband, Alison (Amy Irving), the wife, and Emily (Dakota Fanning), the daughter, are content with their lives, when one day, Alison is found dead, lying in a pool of her blood in the bathroom. Emily, being closer to her mother than her father, gets traumatized by the event, and secludes herself from others. David gets a little nervous and feels that its best for both of them to leave the house and move to a new place, and start a new life. However, once Emily and David reach there, Emily starts acting stranger, when she makes up an imaginary friend called Charlie. David is not too bothered at first, but when odd things start happening, like the tub being filled with blood, and the cat getting murdered, he feels like his life and Emily's are at stake. He tries to find out who's behind all this. Could it be a) someone from his past who is out to get him? b) Charlie, the imaginary friend of Emily's, but who might not actually be a figment of her imagination? c) The bizarre neighbors, who act weird because they have lost a child themselves?Although the movie has an interesting concept, after watching the whole movie, you feel like it raises more questions than answers. During the movie (I don't want to reveal too much about the movie, therefore I will be brief), we feel like Emily is ill and is therefore creating Charlie, but then we find that Emily is ok, and that someone else is behind it. But in the last scene (the picture), you feel like Emily is not all that well herself, which makes you feel whether she WAS involved in those incidents or not. To add to the confusion, the scene when Laura (the neighbor) cries out to David about Steven, is really unnecessary because in the whole movie, we don't find out what is wrong with Steven, or how he is even related to the movie.Even though the movie has its downside, the actors played their part well, especially Dakota Fanning as Emily. She is just 11 years old, and she acts all her parts really well! I knew that she would be a great child actor when I first saw her in `I am Sam', but she really outdid her role in his movie.

Had I known that before, I'd probably have been a lot more wary of this interesting, if ultimately predictable, Robert DeNiro vehicle.Psychologist David Calloway (DeNiro) and his daughter Emily (Dreamer's Dakota Fanning) relocate from New York City to a small town upstate following the suicide of Calloway's wife (Amy Irving). Things immediately start going somewhat awry-- in addition to some extremely odd townsfolk, Emily finds herself a friend named Charlie. David starts off convinced that Charlie is an imaginary friend into whom Emily is pouring her emotional reactions to her mother's death, but as Charlie's pranks get more and more vicious, David has to face the fact that Charlie really does exist. Things come to a head when David tentatively befriends Elizabeth Young (Mysterious Skin's Elisabeth Shue). Charlie doesn't like that-- no sir, not one bit.The first two-thirds of the movie works like a charm, building up suspense like nobody's business-- we know Charlie's not just a figment of Emily's imagination, but David steadfastly refuses to believe it. Unfortunately, once he starts believing as well, the film goes downhill fast. Polson wanted to pick up the pace, I guess, and lost pretty much any sense of suspense, continuity, or believability he'd bought for us in the first hour.Interestingly, the DVD version gives us four alternate versions of the final scene, all but one of which actually work better than the film's climax (I preferred the fourth, YMMV).

Feeling that a change of venue would be the best thing for him and his traumatized daughter, he moves to a small town in upstate New York, hoping to start life over again in an unfamiliar setting.  Almost immediately, the child begins to turn strange, claiming that she has an ""invisible"" playmate who is none too happy with her dad for letting her mom off herself.  Soon, animals and neighbors start showing up dead, and De Niro realizes he needs to start doing some serious intervention if he`s to prevent his little girl from turning into a miniaturized Norman Bates.""Hide and Seek"" takes a serious issue - the effect a parent's suicide has on a child - and exploits it for cheap commercial purposes.  Rather than dealing intelligently with this sensitive topic, the film uses it as window dressing for a squalid little horror film that feels like a thousand other thrillers that have come before it.  The ""surprise"" twist ending will come as a surprise only to those who have never seen ""Secret Window"" or anything of that ilk, and whole sections of the last half hour feel as if they have been lifted almost verbatim from ""The Shining.""  And what modern suspense film worth its salt would be without that single most hackneyed scene in the horror film canon - the old cat-jumping-out-of-the-closet trick!?

Young Ms. Fanning puts together another solid performance and is times far more creepy than the actual villain of the piece.  Elizabeth Shue and Famke Jansen are poorly served by the script and never really develop believable personalities (aside from Shue being on the rebound in a major way), leaving the full effort of characterization to Deniro and Fanning.For anyone interested in the plot, in brief it is the story of a grieving, recent widower and his disturbed child who move from New York city to a remote upstate New York town to attempt to salvage the child's tenuous sanity (she saw the mother's body).  A series of eerie events occur (it is upstate New York after all) that become increasingly more violent and are associated with the child's new, 'imaginary' friend.Overall the movie is a fairly thinly written psychological thriller than relies far too heavily (in this post Shaymalan world) on a twist that was both obvious and highly spoiled.

While browsing Blockbuster one day to find something new I decided to take a chance. I brought it home and watched it, and actually really, really liked it.People need to understand this ISN'T a horror movie--this is 100% pure suspense, like the first Alien film. Horror would be a movie like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw, Hostel, or Black Christmas. Why? Cause, simply, Hide and Seek isn't scary at all. So hardcore modern-day horror fans aren't going to enjoy it as much.The high point of the film is the acting--sure, Robert DeNiro has seen better days--OK, actually, MUCH better days--but he gives a pretty descent performance in Hide and Seek. But who really steals the show is little Dakota Fanning, who is without question one of today's best in Hollywood. People have told me the best things come in small packages, that's no lie! OK, as I said, it's a suspense film--nothing to really be scared about. It will, however, give you that sense of ""eerieness,"" and it's fun to watch on a big screen in a dark room with surround sound. The surprise ending is sort of predictable, but still surprised me. After you ponder it a little after the movie is over it becomes clearer.Actually, to be honest, I liked Hide and Seek so much the first time around I bought it on DVD on sale for $4.99. A few weeks later I watched it again instead of studying for my history test. Expecting to see the same greatness I saw a few weeks ago, simply, I didn't. Actually, it was horrible the second time around. I kept staring at the screen and asking myself ""Is this the same movie I watched a few weeks ago?"" And so it ended and I didn't think it was good the second time around--at all! Bottom line: rent it. Invite a bunch of friends over and watch it in a dark room on a big screen with surround sound. Enjoy it and like it as I did.

900499,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B00092ZLS0,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 2]","I saw ""Hide And Seek"" knowing very little beyond the basic premise (a little girl, played by Dakota Fanning, loses her mother, after which her father - played by Robert DeNiro - moves them to a quiet country town to try and heal; whereupon the little girl begins having conversations with an imaginary friend.)  I didn't even know Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue were in it, two performers whose movies I seek out.  I knew DeNiro was in it (a drawing point) and I knew Fanning was here (this is the first movie I've seen her in and what a performance!) but that's it.I was quickly very thankful I knew so little going in, because ""Hide And Seek"" moves and grows in original and very unexpected ways, not even letting you know where it plans to settle along the horror/mystery/drama/supernatural thriller arc; keeping all its possibilities wide open.  Despite appearances of elements from classic horror movies like ""The Amityville Horror"" in the first few minutes, it ends up not forging through familiar territory at all, but breaking through innovative ground with shocks and imagination. The whole thing is bolstered by great production and uniformly excellent performances.  DeNiro of course is outstanding (I don't think this guy could turn in a weak or even an average performance if his life dependeded on it)and Shue and Jansen are likewise great, but it's Fanning who arguably gives the best performance.  Anytime you can say that about any actress or actor co-starring with DeNiro that's bloody high praise indeed.A smart, scary, multi-faceted movie; watch with something like ""Dead Again"", ""The Eye"", ""When A Stranger Calls Back"", ""Identity"" or ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" for a night of real suspense, surprises and shocks.",5,DEFINATELY One To See Before Someone Gives The Ending Away,1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,1734,"['saw', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'knowing', 'very', 'little', 'basic', 'premise', 'little', 'girl', 'played', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'mother', 'father', 'played', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'quiet', 'country', 'town', 'try', 'heal', 'little', 'girl', 'having', 'conversations', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Famke', 'Janssen', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'were', 'two', 'performers', 'movies', 'seek', 'out', 'knew', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'drawing', 'point', 'knew', 'Fanning', 'was', 'here', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'performance', 'it.I', 'was', 'quickly', 'very', 'thankful', 'knew', 'so', 'little', 'going', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'moves', 'grows', 'original', 'very', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'not', 'even', 'letting', 'know', 'where', 'settle', 'horror/mystery/drama/supernatural', 'thriller', 'arc', 'keeping', 'possibilities', 'wide', 'open', 'appearances', 'elements', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'up', 'not', 'forging', 'familiar', 'territory', 'breaking', 'innovative', 'ground', 'shocks', 'imagination', 'whole', 'thing', 'bolstered', 'great', 'production', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'performances', 'DeNiro', 'course', 'outstanding', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'guy', 'could', 'turn', 'weak', 'even', 'average', 'performance', 'life', 'dependeded', 'Shue', 'Jansen', 'are', 'likewise', 'great', 'Fanning', 'who', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'actress', 'actor', 'co-starring', 'DeNiro', 'bloody', 'high', 'praise', 'indeed.A', 'smart', 'scary', 'multi-faceted', 'movie', 'watch', 'something', 'Dead', 'Again', 'Eye', 'When', 'Stranger', 'Calls', 'Back', 'Identity', 'Mouth', 'Madness', 'night', 'real', 'suspense', 'surprises', 'shocks']",N/A

This is your warning. :)  This movie reminded me very much of Secret Window in that it had the same twist.  Secret Window wasn't scary and the twist was predictable.  Hide and Seek had it's intense and scary moments, and it too was predictable.  Johnny Depp's performance in Secret Window made that movie interesting for me and I kinda wish he were the actor in Hide and Seek instead of Robert De Niro (not to say De Niro wasn't good, he was).  I guess to sum this movie up for those who have continued reading the spoiler, this movie was a scarier version of Secret Window (but lacking the smart and disturbing ending scene).What makes this movie work is the uneasy feeling of seeing a child go from a bright and cheerful individual to a sullen and genuinely creepy little girl.  The tense relationship between De Niro and Fanning is what made the movie interesting to me.  There were moments that gives you that pit in your stomach feeling.  And, Dakota Fanning does an amazing job in portraying her character; she genuinely gave me the creeps.  So, in that regard, I think the movie was successful.  I wouldn't necessarily call it scary, but it did a good job of giving me the creeps.  Even though I figured out the twist early on, the movie does a good job of making you second guess it, giving you tons of red herrings.I guess the main problem with Hide and Seek and most horror movies out right now is this quest for the ""twist"" ending.  It has been ingrained in us since Six Sense that, to be successful, you have to fool the audience.  So, anymore I think people are expecting and actively hunting for the twist.  And that cheapens the experience.  Hollywood keeps churning out the twists and we keep seeing them and figuring them out.What it boils down to is, if you like horror movies and want to see one right now, I'd recommend this movie.  It's not great, but it might give you the creeps.  The truth is, I can think of many worse scary movies out right now to see.  In a month that has Alone in the Dark and Boogeyman, I would recommend staying far far from them (you can see my review to see what I thought of those if you are so inclined) and give Hide and Seek a try.

Her mom kills herself by slitting her wrists in the tub one night, and deniro the husband finds her and then the daughter walks in, so she's traumatized. It appears she does a little time in an actual clinic, and then he decides to move into the country with her and try and ""start over"". He's a psychologist, so he thinks he can handle her.Well, at first she is pretty withdrawn, but then seems to develop a friendship with an imaginary friend charlie, but then bad things start happening, and there's no one to blame but charlie. So who the hell is charlie? Is it her? She's totally chilling and psycho at times so it's not far-fetched. Many times she said things that just made me so upset I was yelling at the tv ""just punch her in the face"" cause she was acting so psycho...Things just get more and more wierd until the end.I did figure it out a few minutes before they let you know on screen because one of the things quickly blurted by another character all of a sudden kind of explains it. But if you're not paying attention closely, you may miss it.I suppose if you watched a lot of these psycho movies you'd figure it out sooner, but as I don't watch a lot of these often, I may have missed more clues early on.All in all, a pretty good movie. Robert Deniro does a great job of course, and even up to the end when things are going on that he can't quite figure out, and it appears his daughter is turning into a killing monster.

I think that ultimately, that's what a movie should boil down to -- entertainment. ""Hide and Seek"" wasn't too 'deep' or highly thought-provoking, but it was realistic and believable. The movie had a strong opening sequence and kept my interest throughout the rest of the film. For those who say it was mis-advertised, I disagree. With all due respect, sometimes people can tend to make a mountain out of a mole hill. The previews and trailers advertised exactly what the movie was -- a thriller. The movie was never meant to be gory or intensely psychological. Instead, it was a fast-paced thriller that had a strong mystery behind it. Aside from the storyline, the acting was also superb. Dakota Fanning really did do the best out of all of the other actors. She really played her part well and it is just amazing at how such a young actress can pull off such a demanding role.

Hide & seek builds as a pretty good little thriller, and possibly supernatuaral horror until it totally falls apart with it's tired ""Psycho"" and ""Secret Window"" inspired plot twist at the end.DeNiro is David Calloway a psychologist who has moved to upstate NY with his young daughter Emily, after his wife commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtup.  His daughter is devastated and retreats into a shell.  Soon she dumps her favorite doll and tells her father she has a new friend, an imaginary friend named Charlie who really doesn't like her father much, or his father's new girlfriend Elizabeth (Elizabeth Shue).  David wakes up and finds the bathroom lit with candles just as he found his wife and words written on the wall as a warning.  He thinks emily did it but Emily blames Charlie.The acts become more and more violent and David seeks help from Katherine (Famke Janssen) also a psycologist who helped Emily after her mother died.  She wants to take Emily back to the city but David wants to give it a couple of more weeks.  Add to that the neighbors next door are acting strangely as they have recently lost a daughter.  It all culminates in a twist ending that would shock us if we hadn't seen it done so many times already.In reaching it's twist, Hide & Seek leaves too many questions unanswered such as what was the deal with the secret basement door and the bed in the basement?  Why was the woman next door so afraid of her husband, other than the fact the writer and director wanted him to be a red herring?  And what about the spooky cave?  Too much is left open in the end.I also have a hard time buying DeNiro, a man in his 60's playing the father of a girl so young.  I know people are having children at an older age these days but we just saw DeNiro as a grandfather...and looking younger...in Meet the Fockers recently.I liked the buildup and suspense but I think they ended up taking an easy way out.

900512,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00092ZLS0,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","A recently widowed doctor Robert DeNiro leaves the city with his only daughter Dakota Fanning.  They start to live a new life in quiet countryside, a deserted summer place this time, and he comes to realize that his move might be a mistake.  If you find any originality in this story, 'Hide and Seek' is your film.  If I sound a little sarcastic, I say I'm sorry, but so many thrillers seek their background in this kind of land of nowhere that I started to feel like yelling 'Not again.'  Oh, and the title!  This unoriginal title should not be confused with another 'Hide and Seek' made only 6 years ago.  At least they should have done something to that.But DeNiro's 'Hide and Seek' is not without entertainment value.  Though the film's main body is made from parts from other thrillers, it starts mildly interesting.  DeNiro plays Dr. David Callaway, who lost his wife Alison (Amy Irving) in a terrible situation, and their only daughter Lucy (Fanning), witnessing the scene, is traumatized by the shock.  They leave the city, and begin to live quietly in the countryside (which is conviniently only one hour's drive away from the city where Lucy's doctor Famke Jansen lives).But you know, Lucy starts to act weirdly, talking about her imaginary frined named Charlie.  She insists Charlie often comes to their house, and does a wicked thing or two.  The tricks Charlie (or whatever) does on them get worse as the story goes on, and finally Lucy herself is out of control.  Well, it seems so at first.Like M. Night Shyamalan thrillers, 'Hide and Seek' tries to be atomospheric, and at times it succeeds.  See, for example, who plays the local sheriff jingling the bundle of keys, who might be a bit too officious.  It's Dylan Baker, yes, who played the daddy who did a very bad thing to a kid in 'Happiness.'  It's good casting, for Dylan Baker could be very unpredictable, and he is a good actor.But it turns out differently.  For all the participations of ever-reliable Dylan Baker and equally-reliable Elizabeth Shue, the things go on like autopilot.  For all the good (and in a sense, very scary) acting from Dakota Fanning, any fans of thrillers can read the next step of the film.  Here's a doll!  There's a cat!!  The girl is looking at the sinister-looking woods!!!  You can guess what will happen next.Yes, I know, except that part, which the Fox Studio is so eager to protect that to reavel it here would involve you and me into an unwelcome lawsuit, so I won't write it.  You have to see it, and perhaps, just perhaps, you may be impressed with it.  Me?  Well, I admit it was unexpected, but at the same time the twist does not heighten the suspence at all.  Actually, it is an amateur's touch which destroys the professional acting from Fanning, whose Lucy character is the only mysterious part of the film.  In short, Fanning's well-measured performance is wasted to show this big, implausible, and silly surprise.Finally, here is what I want to ask: how many people still remember Robert DeNiro in the 70s or 80s?  Oh, he was such a sensation.  Not exactly a money-making star (which I do not say is a bad thing per se), but the name of DeNiro meant something awe-inspiring.  I enjoyed 'Analyse This' and 'Meet the Parents,' but I didn't expect 'Analyse That' was coming.  Neither his awful self-parody of Travis in 'Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.'

900515,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B00092ZLS0,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[2, 2]","This expert DVD transfer includes a commentary tract and four alternate endings, two of which are actually better than the one director John Polson chose, calling his judgment into question. But he has made so many other wrong choices that the holes in this original script are the least of the picture's  problems. What is absolutely right about it, however, is the remarkable child actress Dakota Fanning in the leading role. She not only carries ""Hide and Seek"" but she steals it easily from top-billed Robert DeNiro.What is one of our finest actors doing in this ho-hum psychological thriller anyway? Not much. DeNiro seems to be channeling the confrontational Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver""  into a widowed New York psychologist who takes his nine-year-old daughter, traumatized by her mother's suicide, to a woodsy hamlet to cure her. Of course, matters get worse (surprise!), more for the audience than any of the characters. Well, they suffer, too, mostly at the hands of the little girl's imaginary friend. Yes, she has one of those, and you also won't be surprised when she sees creepy things go bump in the night.At least she doesn't see dead people, although a ""Sixth Sense"" might have helped this movie, which doesn't play fair (note the scene in which a visiting friend is murdered.) The film is filled with red herrings, plot inconsistencies, loud sound effects, spooky music, and some competent supporting actors, including Dylan Baker as the sheriff and Amy Irving as the mother whose flashbacked story is clumsily edited. You wonder what Brian DePalma might have done with this material.

Red,"[2, 2]","Robert DeNiro and Dakota Fanning (and a distinguished supporting cast of Amy Irving, Elizabeth Shue, and others) do their best with this slight horror film. It is, of course, difficult to explain what feels ""off"" about the plot without giving too much away. DeNiro plays the doting (psychologist) father whose depressed wife has committed suicide; in order to give his young daughter a fresh start, he leaves New York City and heads to a charming gothic country house in upstate New York. The daughter, however, grows more distant as she takes up with an ""imaginary"" friend (""Charlie""), and nothing her father can do can seemingly pry her away from her new obsession as she detaches herself more and more from reality. One death after another, however, feel all too real.It's standard in such a plot to have red herrings -- subplots that seem capable of resolving the main action but turn out to be distractions. There are many of these here. The problem is that none of them, in the end, seems less likely (though they are perhaps a bit more cliched)  than the ""real"" solution. For good reason, the film has been compared unfavorably to ""The Sixth Sense."" In fact, quite a lot of the action developed in the red herring plots makes no sense whatever in view of the ultimate solution of the mystery.I watched the ""alternate"" endings, thinking that they might suggest true alternatives -- genuinely different ways of resolving a complex narrative. No such luck. The alternate endings represent merely various possibilities for the final scene, none of which offers anything like a true fork in the road (I was remembering John Fowles' ""The French Lieutenant's Woman,"" which offered a genuine ""alternate"" ending). These alternate endings were lame -- shoot the scene five different ways and then you don't need to decide which is actually the best conclusion because you can sell them all on the DVD. No imagination there, and in fact the ending chosen was clearly the best one. Don't waste your time watching these special features.In fact, you probably shouldn't waste your time watching this film at all. It was lacking overall in the imagination that was deserved by its fine cast.",3,"One one thousand, two one thousand zzz",1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,2183,"['Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'distinguished', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Amy', 'Irving', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'others', 'do', 'best', 'slight', 'horror', 'film', 'course', 'difficult', 'explain', 'what', 'plot', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'DeNiro', 'doting', 'psychologist', 'father', 'depressed', 'wife', 'committed', 'suicide', 'order', 'give', 'young', 'daughter', 'fresh', 'start', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'heads', 'charming', 'gothic', 'country', 'house', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'daughter', 'however', 'more', 'distant', 'up', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'nothing', 'father', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'seemingly', 'pry', 'away', 'new', 'obsession', 'more', 'more', 'reality', 'One', 'death', 'however', 'feel', 'too', 'real.It', 'standard', 'such', 'plot', 'have', 'red', 'herrings', 'subplots', 'seem', 'capable', 'resolving', 'main', 'action', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'distractions', 'are', 'many', 'here', 'problem', 'none', 'end', 'less', 'likely', 'are', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'cliched', 'real', 'solution', 'good', 'reason', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'unfavorably', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'fact', 'quite', 'lot', 'action', 'developed', 'red', 'herring', 'plots', 'sense', 'whatever', 'view', 'ultimate', 'solution', 'mystery.I', 'watched', 'alternate', 'endings', 'thinking', 'might', 'suggest', 'true', 'alternatives', 'genuinely', 'different', 'ways', 'resolving', 'complex', 'narrative', 'such', 'luck', 'alternate', 'endings', 'represent', 'merely', 'various', 'possibilities', 'final', 'scene', 'none', 'anything', 'true', 'fork', 'road', 'was', 'remembering', 'John', 'Fowles', 'French', 'Lieutenant', 'Woman', 'offered', 'genuine', 'alternate', 'ending', 'alternate', 'endings', 'were', 'lame', 'shoot', 'scene', 'five', 'different', 'ways', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'decide', 'actually', 'best', 'conclusion', 'can', 'sell', 'DVD', 'imagination', 'there', 'fact', 'ending', 'chosen', 'was', 'clearly', 'best', 'one', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'special', 'features.In', 'fact', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'lacking', 'overall', 'imagination', 'was', 'deserved', 'fine', 'cast']",N/A
