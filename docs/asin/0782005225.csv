Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[3, 3]","The first time I saw Rent-A-Kid 5 or 6 years ago I wasn't impressed, probably because I expected edgier humor from Leslie Nielsen (Forbidden Planet, Poseidon Adventure) and Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit).When I watched it again last week, I enjoyed the film much more than I remembered, though Lloyd pretty much plays it straight, and the humor is all suitable for the whole family.  Nielsen is very funny in a different way than usual for him, as an absent minded businessman, always thinking of making a profit (he comes up with the title idea), seeming oblivious of the consequences.  Along with the humor the story gradually becomes more of a heartwarming drama, so I recommend this film for families to watch together - get some laughs if nothing else.",4,Better second time around.,1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,770,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'Rent-A-Kid', '5', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'probably', 'expected', 'edgier', 'humor', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'Poseidon', 'Adventure', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', '.When', 'watched', 'again', 'last', 'week', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'remembered', 'Lloyd', 'pretty', 'much', 'straight', 'humor', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'Nielsen', 'very', 'funny', 'different', 'way', 'usual', 'absent', 'minded', 'businessman', 'always', 'thinking', 'making', 'profit', 'up', 'title', 'idea', 'seeming', 'oblivious', 'consequences', 'humor', 'story', 'gradually', 'more', 'heartwarming', 'drama', 'recommend', 'film', 'families', 'watch', 'together', 'get', 'laughs', 'nothing', 'else']",N/A
