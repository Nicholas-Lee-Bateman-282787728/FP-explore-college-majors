The movie also takes you on the journey of a small town named Kipling and how the shouldn't judge people by their cover and that things aren't always what they seem.I love that this move is filmed in Canada and the town's people are the majority of the actors. It really makes this movie more personal and real. If you watch the special features you can get the ""pride"" (not that they are prideful, just proud) in the town's people's faces, and you just can't help but smile. Also note Lorne Cardinal from ""Corner Gas"", Canada's #1 hit comedy is in this movie.I can not write this review without mentioning a character and the actor who plays him, Lloyd Allen Warner who plays Travis. He reminds me of my cousin Jeff who was born with brain damage. Most people don't understand why he does the things he does but it is always from him heart. Travis took the blame to protect others, and he didn't care what the consequences were to himself as long as the other people were safe. I think from watching the special features that Lloyd is very much like her character, he has many awards from saving other people from danger. I was talking with my husband and I said, ""it's because his brain is wired differently then ours, we think `if I go into that burning building I might get hurt', Lloyd/Travis think, ""If I don't go into the burning building someone might get hurt'."" I could only wish I would think/feel like that. And I think we can all learn a lesson on compassion from this character/man.This is a perfect movie to sit around with your family and watch. There are so many different levels to learn from and teach your kids about. I do however want to say that the special features were the best part for me. After watching the movie and then seeing the people talking in their real life circumstance, you really get a feel for the love and hard work put into the movie.---------------------------------------------*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

He wrote, produced, directed and played in the movie. Majority of the actors/actresses are from Kipling. Though this was a low budget ($250,000)film, it has depth, compassion and an understanding that comes with it. There are maybe and I say maybe three professional actors involved in this film. I like to watch the Special Features of any movie I watch, this one is no exception. Bernson wrote this screenplay for his father. He started writing it before is Dad's death, but had writer's block. Not until after his death did Bernson finish the script. As he basically explained--it just flowed. The movie is one that makes you sit back and really think. It gives the audience the ability to renew faith--whatever that faith may be. There is a great plot line and the ending will blow you away. I wasn't expecting the ending to be so profound. It gave me hope, it gave me believe that all things are possible. Anyone that wants to see a great film--this is the one I recommend.

The movie uses several tools to convey the emotions being displayed, color, subject, and weather in addition to dialog and acting. One of my first impressions was one of being grateful I wasn't in a cold, somber place like the one being shown. The somber coldness was a perfect reflection of the mood of the people when our ""hero"" returned to his home town of Kipling. It was interesting to note at the end of the movie the sun peaked out and Spring was returning as the movie ends.The movie is about a voyage of discovery for a disillusioned minister who is searching for redemption and in the process returns to his home town which has also become disillusioned and is also seeking redemption. No sooner has the minister returned than he is faced with a mystery which he feels compelled to investigate. Something has taken place which just doesn't seem to fit as he sees it. The movie then proceeds to tell the story of the events which result from this dual search and the mystery and results in the redemption of both and the solving of the mystery. The movie was filmed in Kipling, Saskatchewan, Canada.The movie held our attention and although the first part did seem to move slowly, the pace picks up midpoint and moves rapidly toward a satisfactory conclusion. It deals with principles of morality and the challenge mere mortals must face as they attempt to reconcile those principles with the challenges of life.The movie is suitable for all the family and displays the value of applying higher moral standards to life situations.

1370171,AZUBX0AYYNTFF,B003X82CZM,Donald M. Bishop,"[3, 3]","I can hear the highbrow critics now.  ""Lightweight philosophizing.""  ""Didactic plot.""  ""Solve the mystery by following the bread crumbs.""  Let them carp.  This is a fine movie, especially good for discussions between the generations.Pastor Jim (played by Corbin Bernsen), going through a crisis of faith, returns to his home town of ""Kipling"" in the snow swept Midwest forty years after he left for the seminary.  Even after forty years, there are unresolved family tensions caused by his departure.  And a high school friend who was always a little strange (Lloyd Allen Warner) is being held for murder.The ""issues"" in the film are the great questions.  ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""  ""Why doesn't God answer my prayers?""  I'm guessing that a theologian or philosopher, dissecting the script, would not judge that ""Rust"" profoundly answers the questions.  Of course they will never be answered in full.  But in growing to adulthood, every person comes to ask them.  ""Rust,"" grounded in a place and season in our own times, places the discussion in everyday life rather than in a classroom.  The film can provide a  good start for a discussion.Here are a few more thoughts on the film -- one moral, one religious, one secular:First, featured in the film are elderly characters with faces weathered by the elements, by work and worry, and by too much smoking -- Pastor Jim's father (Frank Gall), his sister (Audrey Lynn Tennant), and his old parish pastor (John Hutchinson).  Hollywood typically dwells on youth, beauty, and appearances.  The faces of these characters -- none professional actors -- force you to think not about externals but about the goodness inside people.Second, none of the characters in the film have much in terms of the fame and money our culture worships.  But from they draw from their faith an understanding that the great drama of life and existence -- centered around meaning, goodness, the choice of right over wrong, and God's promises -- plays on any stage, even in the snows.Finally, the constant smoking in the film along with the sense that young people in ""Kipling"" don't see good futures for themselves in the American ""heartland"" of the plains brought to mind a recent column, ""Midwest at Dusk,"" by David Brooks of the New York Times.  He was writing about the ""perplexities and contradictions"" of places like ""Kipling.""  He said, ""people are living with the daily grind of getting by on $40,000 a year, but they're also living with Xboxes and smartphones.  People in these places have traditional bourgeois values, but they live amid a decaying social fabric, with high divorce rates and skyrocketing single parenthood numbers.  Many people in these neighborhoods distrust government but still look to it for help.  They disdain Wall Street but admire capitalism.  They are intensely patriotic but accustomed to globalization.""Brooks' conclusion:  ""If America can figure out how to build a decent future for the working-class people in this region, then the U.S. will remain a predominant power. If it can't, it won't.""-30-",4,Asking the great questions in a place and season in our own times ...,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3075,"['can', 'hear', 'highbrow', 'critics', 'now', 'Lightweight', 'philosophizing', 'Didactic', 'plot', 'Solve', 'mystery', 'following', 'bread', 'crumbs', 'Let', 'carp', 'fine', 'movie', 'especially', 'good', 'discussions', 'generations.Pastor', 'Jim', 'played', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'going', 'crisis', 'faith', 'returns', 'home', 'town', 'Kipling', 'snow', 'Midwest', 'forty', 'years', 'left', 'seminary', 'Even', 'forty', 'years', 'are', 'unresolved', 'family', 'tensions', 'caused', 'departure', 'high', 'school', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'always', 'little', 'strange', 'Lloyd', 'Allen', 'Warner', 'being', 'held', 'murder.The', 'issues', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'questions', 'Why', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people', 'Why', ""n't"", 'God', 'answer', 'prayers', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'theologian', 'philosopher', 'dissecting', 'script', 'would', 'not', 'judge', 'Rust', 'profoundly', 'questions', 'course', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'answered', 'full', 'growing', 'adulthood', 'person', 'ask', 'Rust', 'grounded', 'place', 'season', 'own', 'times', 'discussion', 'everyday', 'life', 'rather', 'classroom', 'film', 'can', 'provide', 'good', 'start', 'discussion.Here', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'thoughts', 'film', 'one', 'moral', 'one', 'religious', 'one', 'secular', 'First', 'featured', 'film', 'are', 'elderly', 'characters', 'weathered', 'elements', 'work', 'worry', 'too', 'much', 'smoking', 'Pastor', 'Jim', 'father', 'Frank', 'Gall', 'sister', 'Audrey', 'Lynn', 'Tennant', 'old', 'parish', 'pastor', 'John', 'Hutchinson', 'Hollywood', 'typically', 'youth', 'beauty', 'appearances', 'characters', 'none', 'professional', 'actors', 'force', 'think', 'not', 'externals', 'goodness', 'people.Second', 'none', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'much', 'terms', 'fame', 'money', 'culture', 'worships', 'draw', 'faith', 'understanding', 'great', 'drama', 'life', 'existence', 'centered', 'meaning', 'goodness', 'choice', 'right', 'wrong', 'God', 'promises', 'plays', 'stage', 'even', 'snows.Finally', 'constant', 'smoking', 'film', 'sense', 'young', 'people', 'Kipling', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'good', 'futures', 'American', 'heartland', 'plains', 'brought', 'mind', 'recent', 'column', 'Midwest', 'Dusk', 'David', 'Brooks', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'was', 'writing', 'perplexities', 'contradictions', 'places', 'Kipling', 'said', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'daily', 'grind', 'getting', '40,000', 'year', ""'re"", 'also', 'living', 'Xboxes', 'smartphones', 'People', 'places', 'have', 'traditional', 'bourgeois', 'values', 'live', 'decaying', 'social', 'fabric', 'high', 'divorce', 'rates', 'skyrocketing', 'single', 'parenthood', 'numbers', 'Many', 'people', 'neighborhoods', 'distrust', 'government', 'still', 'look', 'help', 'disdain', 'Wall', 'Street', 'admire', 'capitalism', 'are', 'intensely', 'patriotic', 'accustomed', 'globalization', 'Brooks', 'conclusion', 'America', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'build', 'decent', 'future', 'working-class', 'people', 'region', 'then', 'U.S.', 'will', 'remain', 'predominant', 'power', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", '-30-']",N/A

One of the appealing things about this is that we are not asked to believe that God always comes to the rescue in miraculous fashion. Sometimes we do stumble and grasp to hold onto the faith that we have. The cast of mostly non-actors does a splendid job which only adds to the films non-Hollywood feel.

I love movies with character growth and flavor which slowly marinates the heart, and considering many of the acting projects he has done in the past, this was really refreshing.  I don't think it will grab audiences in droves as the Kendricks' films (Fireproof, Facing The Giants).  However, this is nevertheless very touching, inspirational, and profound.  Although there is not a huge amount of characters who are involved in the fire mystery, which is the big subplot, you still need to pay close attention to the dialogue which reveals subtle pieces of information along the way.  James Moore (Corbin's character) is of course the center of the whole film, and every scene (either purely scenic or dialogue driven) is an emotional step along his path back to where he should be in his relationship with God.Corbin's real father passing in 2008 inspired him to take on this project, and knowing that piece of information going in makes viewing this even more inspirational.

1370200,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B003X82CZM,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[1, 1]","One of the problems with low budget movies is the fact that usually the director gets his friends to be in the major parts. I am not listening to the commentary track to confirm it, but I'm quite sure that every single actor in this movie beside Corbin Bernsen is someone from the town that he liked. I refuse to believe that the rest of the actors actually auditioned to be in this thing and got their parts over dozens of other actors. Take for example the actor playing the father. At a certain point Corbin Bernstein is confronting him about why he's so angry and why he is always acting so disappointed. The father character tells the Bernstein character that he's ruined his own life. This would be a scene fraught with drama if the actor playing the father could summon up an emotional response that is more energetic than sleepy. The actor playing the troubled friend accused of arson/murder mumbles most of his lines as if he's on a bender (which accidentally fits with the character but still makes for odd choices).However, Corbin Bernsen is still a decent actor and does his job carrying the movie. Even though this is a blatant Christian movie with the requisite references to Jesus and God coming every three minutes on average, it does have the sense of putting most of the dialogue into the mouth of Bernstein whose troubled preacher character is at least more nuanced than your average troubled preacher in these things (while there's never any doubt that he's going to go back to Jesus at the end, he does make the journey interesting).Beyond that, the story is pretty compelling and there a several amazing shots throughout. It's a well filmed movie and I would definitely want to see something else by this director - with a budget and paid actors.Edit - I just looked up this movie online and found that Bernsen directed and produced it as well as starring in it. I assumed that it was a first time director, but I didn't think that it was also the star. The fact that he did the movie primarily to give the town a movie. That's an interesting side note and it does make the movie more admirable.Note that the four star is on the expectations of a low budget Christian movie.

I always watch the special features, because it gives me so much more information about the movie. I love to get to know that actors better and see what all was involved in the making of the movie. The special features on Rust were extra special. I found out all of the actors/actresses were just town people none of them are actors except Corbin Bernsen of course. All of the actors did a superb job, with the exception of one, Audrey Tennent who played Corbin`s sister, Mary. I'm not cutting her down, she's just not an actress and I thought her lines were to stiff. Even through I still love this movie and you will also. I was amazed at the acting ability of Lloyd Warner who plays the part of Travis. Like the movie Lloyd has learning difficulties. Frank Gall played as Corbin's dad and did an excellent job. I also was touched and amazed at the job John Hutchinson did as the Pastor in the movie. He also is a real minister. Great actor.You will be surprised at all of the different twists this movie has. I was astonished at the ending. I never would have guessed it. Such a wonderful, touching inspirational movie that I highly recommend.""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.
