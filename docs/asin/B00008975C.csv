You have no idea how thrilled I was when I saw it on DVD at a BORDERS a while a go.Nathan Lane is the cynical tyrant radio host Sheridan Whiteside. Who has some of the most crudest and hysterical one liners I have ever herd in the world.It's very obvious in the begging that he care for no one but him self. He badgers his hostesses family ` the Stanilys'. To the point were he doesn't allow them in their own kitchen and living room. Let a lone their own library.Even his well beloved secretary Magi Cutler gets her own problems with him.  When she falls in love, with a relatively young, and handsome news paper reporter named Bert Jefferson.The main cast is also sounded with a wonderfully colorful supporting cast as well. Whiteside and Magi's well meaning friend actor and singer Beverly Carrolton comes for a short Christmas visit.Though he is some what conceded. Beverly is charming with his own wit, with a relatively small scene for him self.The true entertainment though is that of Whiteside's friend is Banjo. A rather comical maniac who also comes to see his friend. While he is ""in a lot of pain"". Whitesied foolishly invites Lorraine Sheldon a highly regard actress in the story. Who Whitesied tries to use with manipulation, so that he can keep Magi to himself.However, like with a lot of things his plain backfires.Truly a marvelous cast even though some what small.

735852,AMUTYOX234D90,B00008975C,Bill,"[9, 10]","Very enjoyable staging of Kaufman and Hart play. Nathan Lane and Jean Smart, as you would expect, squeeze every possible laugh from their lines. They're wonderful.One caveat: The play is filled with quick references to personalities of the period (the 1930s), and most of that might go right over some people's heads. But much of the comedy is timeless, so everyone is bound to enjoy it in the end.There is more to this DVD than a previous reviewer would have you believe, but only a bit more. In the intermissions, there are some descriptions of the characters and whom they are based on. And there is an enjoyable segment with Kaufman's daughter and Hart's wife (the eternally graceful and charming Kitty Carlisle). The banter between Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson in these segments is weak, however.

However, I must admit I still like the classic movie version of this with Monty Woolley, Betty Davis, Billie Burke, Jimmy Durante, and many other known actors, a bit more. This stage version seems chopped at the beginning and the over abundence of running around by the actors wore me out. This is not to say the sardonic wit is not appreciated. Lane was perfectly cast as Sheridan Whiteside. I think this would be great to see on stage with him, but on TV I like the original movie.When a witty radio speaker finds himself in a wheelchair at a home where he fell on the ice and broke his hip, he first ridicules, then plots chicanery. Half the fun are the items sent to him by the likes of the circus and other eccentrics. This story whether on stage or screen transfers well and is well worth seeing in either format. The DVD quality is great and it has a good deal of replayability.

A few days ago I checked online to see if it was available and - joy - it was! On the DVD's release date I greedily went to my local (eegads!) video supplier and expecting a great treatment onto DVD paid FULL PRICE ...!!! (Something I almost never do...) I should've been patient and purchased it online with a discount. Don't make my mistake. The Hart/Kaufman farce has always held up and remains a great bit of comedic theater. Nathan Lane & Jean Smart are at top form and their timing is wonderful. The supporting cast is just as good.There are some problems with the transfer of the play to DVD, though. First off, the DVD is bare bones -- no history of the play ( except for the first act intermission break with Liam Neesan and Natasha Richardson), no commentary, not even a cast biography -- a shame. The sound is weak as well 2.0 surround, I believe. The picture quality is fantastic, though, even if it is full screen (yes, I know... it was on television that way and that's it's suppossed original aspect ratio -- 1.33.1).All in all, this is a fantastic, rollicking, ""catty"" rendering of the play and since there are so few of this caliber available to purchase it is a worthy addition to your home DVD collection. Hey, it's cheaper than a theater ticket! Maybe next time we'll get more for our money when it comes to extra features. Are you listening ""Image Entertainment""?

735856,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,B00008975C,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[2, 5]","This was an entertaining presentation of a really enjoyable Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman play.In the second act Nathan Lane settled into his character and realized that even though he was performing his role in a wheelchair, he was not completely immobilized from the waist up. Once Lane relaxed in his chair, he appeared to be able to  concentrate and become more believable in his role.While Lane is much more well-matched to the actual physical size of Alexander Woolcott (on whom his character of Sheridan Whiteside was based), he appeared very diminutive in the wheelchair.  The chair itself was downsized in this production, no doubt to lessen the impact of the size optical illusion.  This only helped a small amount though.  In comparison to the impending presence of Monty Woolley who played Whiteside in the 1942 film offereing of this classic comedy, Lane looks very small.Lewis Stadlen in the role of Banjo, played by Jimmy Durante in the aforementioned film, was a real show-stealer, totally lighting up the stage and the play with his presence.Jean Smart, as actress Lorraine Sheldon, was interesting in her role, but didn't quite pull of the era of the tale in her portrayal.  Sheldon appeared to be more modern than the other characters and the late 30's time of the play itself.The presentation of historical information about the play by Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson between the acts was actually painful to watch.  Neeson appeared to be drugged with perhaps Prozac and Natasha apparently was practicing the art of ventriloquism (or perhaps her lips were paralyzed with the same subtance as Lane's upper body parts during the first act). The Neesons sleepwalked and mumbled during the intermissions and their time can be skipped to retain the pace of the story.Having said all this, this was an overall enjoyable offering and a great way to enjoy a play from the comfort of your home.  I would recommend however, if you enjoy the story, you also watch the Bette Davis film of 1942, but definitely not back-to-back, as this stage play suffers by immediate comparison.",4,An enjoyable presentation of a Classic play,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,2093,"['was', 'entertaining', 'presentation', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'Moss', 'Hart', 'George', 'S.', 'Kaufman', 'play.In', 'second', 'act', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'settled', 'character', 'realized', 'even', 'was', 'performing', 'role', 'wheelchair', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'immobilized', 'waist', 'up', 'Once', 'Lane', 'relaxed', 'chair', 'appeared', 'be', 'able', 'concentrate', 'become', 'more', 'believable', 'role.While', 'Lane', 'much', 'more', 'well-matched', 'actual', 'physical', 'size', 'Alexander', 'Woolcott', 'whom', 'character', 'Sheridan', 'Whiteside', 'was', 'based', 'appeared', 'very', 'diminutive', 'wheelchair', 'chair', 'was', 'downsized', 'production', 'doubt', 'lessen', 'impact', 'size', 'optical', 'illusion', 'only', 'helped', 'small', 'amount', 'comparison', 'impending', 'presence', 'Monty', 'Woolley', 'who', 'played', 'Whiteside', '1942', 'film', 'offereing', 'classic', 'comedy', 'Lane', 'very', 'small.Lewis', 'Stadlen', 'role', 'Banjo', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Durante', 'aforementioned', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'show-stealer', 'totally', 'lighting', 'up', 'stage', 'play', 'presence.Jean', 'Smart', 'actress', 'Lorraine', 'Sheldon', 'was', 'interesting', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pull', 'era', 'tale', 'portrayal', 'Sheldon', 'appeared', 'be', 'more', 'modern', 'other', 'characters', 'late', '30', 'time', 'play', 'itself.The', 'presentation', 'historical', 'information', 'play', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'acts', 'was', 'actually', 'painful', 'watch', 'Neeson', 'appeared', 'be', 'drugged', 'perhaps', 'Prozac', 'Natasha', 'apparently', 'was', 'practicing', 'art', 'ventriloquism', 'perhaps', 'lips', 'were', 'paralyzed', 'same', 'subtance', 'Lane', 'upper', 'body', 'parts', 'first', 'act', 'Neesons', 'sleepwalked', 'mumbled', 'intermissions', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'skipped', 'retain', 'pace', 'story.Having', 'said', 'was', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'offering', 'great', 'way', 'enjoy', 'play', 'comfort', 'home', 'would', 'recommend', 'however', 'enjoy', 'story', 'also', 'watch', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'film', '1942', 'definitely', 'not', 'back-to-back', 'stage', 'play', 'suffers', 'immediate', 'comparison']",N/A

It crackles much more than the movie version, which I found strangely uninvolving.  I liked Nathan Lane much better than Monty Wooley (the film's Sheridan), and the other actors do fine work.There have been some minor changes made along the way in Acts 1 & 2, but changes are much more extensive in Act 3.  The character of Banjo is modeled here on Jimmy Durante, who did it in the movie.  The film's choice of Durante must have been for contractual reasons, as Harpo Marx (the original stage play's model) was very much alive at the time. I found Durante annoying in the role, not the crazed presence Banjo is in the show.In any event, this version of the play goes the Durante route, with a heavy re-writing of Act 3 (where Banjo appears).  There's long stretches of boredom and a downright tedious sequence shortly after his entrance.  Inasmuch as Lewis J. Stadlen is very familiar with the Marx Brothers (he even did a one-man show as Groucho), I don't know why they went this path.  The result is a downward spiral that is only saved by Lane and Jean Smart.  If the rest of the show were like Act 3, it would get just two (weak) stars.  Thankfully, it isn't.This version is better than the film, but it could have been much better had they stayed with the original concept.
