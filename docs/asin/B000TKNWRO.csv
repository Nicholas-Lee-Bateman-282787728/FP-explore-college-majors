1091263,A8S3TKRS42G4G,B000TKNWRO,Deb Dee,"[1, 1]","This routine was easy to follow on my first viewing.  I find that some workouts are so dancey and poorly cued that I have to repeatedly rewind to get the steps; this wasn't one of those.A word of caution - the routine starts with stretches on the floor; no warm up to increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles before stretching them - this approach increases the chances for a pulled muscle.The workout is not heart-thumping or intense, so I enjoy this routine as a post-training cool down.  It consists of graceful dance steps, interspersed with repetitive, fluid arm raises and leg lifts. The movements stretch and elongate the muscles, which feels wonderful after weight training.  The music has a soothing effect and it is a great way to finish up a training session.The instructor's use of a teleprompter is a bit obvious, but this is only a slight distraction from her beautiful, graceful moves.

1091264,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,B000TKNWRO,J. M WILINSKY,"[21, 21]","Deanna McBrearty is very well known in the ballet community, having danced for the New York City Ballet.  What is unusual about her career is that her fame came not so much as a dancer, but as a model!  While she was working as a ballet dancer, she was used by famous fashion designers to do photo and runway work, often doing ballet steps down the fashion runway!  She can also be seen in the New York City Ballet Workout DVD, modeling ballet clothes in catalogs and demonstrating ballet technique in some books, such as Suki Schorer's ""Balanchine Technique"".  She has also been a great inspiration to many because when she was 12 year old, she had a very serious scoliosis and was told that she needed a metal rod implanted in her spine, which would have made a ballet career imposible.  Instead, she worked hard in her ballet studies and became completely free of all scoliosis in only one year!  Deanna is a very dedicated dancer.  So, when I heard that she had developed her own approach to working out, I became very curious to see what it was, being a ballet dancer myself.I found this workout to be very useful and enjoyable(the whole point of being a dancer is to enjoy moving!).  She begins with a warmup and then moves on to a floor barre to stretch, strengthen, and warmup further.  The main body of the workout comes next, and comprises the standing exercises, which involve flowing motions using mostly ballet technique.  These make good use of the entire body, including the arms.  They are done to a variety of tempos: medium, fast, and slow.  Finally, there is a cooldown done on the floor.  In addition to this extensive fifty minute workout, there is a generous amount of extras, including Deanna's biography, suggestions on getting the most out of the workout, reactions from those who have taken her Balocity classes(this is the only place where we hear that two men, one a ballet dancer and the other an actor, have also enjoyed her Balocity workout), and even outtakes.In addition to being a great all-around workout, this is also very helpful for those dance students who are having trouble feeling comfortable with quick routines, since the concept of dancing in a flowing motion is stressed.  This DVD is highly recommended for all those seeking great crossover training, as well as dancers looking for a different type of rhythmic routine.",5,The Best Ballet Style Workout Yet!,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2366,"['Deanna', 'McBrearty', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'ballet', 'community', 'having', 'danced', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'What', 'unusual', 'career', 'fame', 'came', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dancer', 'model', 'was', 'working', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'was', 'used', 'famous', 'fashion', 'designers', 'do', 'photo', 'runway', 'work', 'often', 'doing', 'ballet', 'steps', 'down', 'fashion', 'runway', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet', 'Workout', 'DVD', 'modeling', 'ballet', 'clothes', 'catalogs', 'demonstrating', 'ballet', 'technique', 'books', 'such', 'Suki', 'Schorer', 'Balanchine', 'Technique', 'also', 'been', 'great', 'inspiration', 'many', 'when', 'was', '12', 'year', 'old', 'had', 'very', 'serious', 'scoliosis', 'was', 'told', 'needed', 'metal', 'rod', 'implanted', 'spine', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'ballet', 'career', 'imposible', 'Instead', 'worked', 'hard', 'ballet', 'studies', 'became', 'completely', 'free', 'scoliosis', 'only', 'one', 'year', 'Deanna', 'very', 'dedicated', 'dancer', 'So', 'when', 'heard', 'had', 'developed', 'own', 'approach', 'working', 'out', 'became', 'very', 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'myself.I', 'found', 'workout', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'enjoyable', 'whole', 'point', 'being', 'dancer', 'enjoy', 'moving', 'warmup', 'then', 'moves', 'floor', 'barre', 'stretch', 'strengthen', 'warmup', 'further', 'main', 'body', 'workout', 'next', 'standing', 'exercises', 'involve', 'flowing', 'motions', 'using', 'mostly', 'ballet', 'technique', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'entire', 'body', 'including', 'arms', 'are', 'done', 'variety', 'tempos', 'medium', 'fast', 'slow', 'Finally', 'cooldown', 'done', 'floor', 'addition', 'extensive', 'fifty', 'minute', 'workout', 'generous', 'amount', 'extras', 'including', 'Deanna', 'biography', 'suggestions', 'getting', 'most', 'workout', 'reactions', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'Balocity', 'classes', 'only', 'place', 'where', 'hear', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'other', 'actor', 'have', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Balocity', 'workout', 'even', 'outtakes.In', 'addition', 'being', 'great', 'all-around', 'workout', 'also', 'very', 'helpful', 'dance', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'trouble', 'feeling', 'comfortable', 'quick', 'routines', 'concept', 'dancing', 'flowing', 'motion', 'stressed', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommended', 'seeking', 'great', 'crossover', 'training', 'as', 'well', 'dancers', 'looking', 'different', 'type', 'rhythmic', 'routine']",Balocity: Cardio with a Classic Twist
1091265,A3MFOXV9B1CHAM,B000TKNWRO,latissimusdorsi,"[4, 4]","I found this very enjoyable.  The video is almost an hour long and includes dynamic stretching, ""floor barre,"" low-impact cardio dance movements, and a cool down.  This is definitely a workout for the masses, not just dancers or ballerinas or pilates gurus.  If anything, this disc errs on the side of too much cardio and not enough dance.  The core movements around which the routines are centered are very bouncy and not very balletic.  Also, the hour-long run time hurt more than helped the workout, it could have easily been condensed.",3,Too Much time and not enough sweat,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,539,"['found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'video', 'almost', 'hour', 'long', 'dynamic', 'stretching', 'floor', 'barre', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'dance', 'movements', 'cool', 'down', 'definitely', 'workout', 'masses', 'not', 'just', 'dancers', 'ballerinas', 'pilates', 'gurus', 'anything', 'disc', 'errs', 'side', 'too', 'much', 'cardio', 'not', 'enough', 'dance', 'core', 'movements', 'routines', 'are', 'centered', 'are', 'very', 'bouncy', 'not', 'very', 'balletic', 'Also', 'hour-long', 'run', 'time', 'hurt', 'more', 'helped', 'workout', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'condensed']",Balocity: Cardio with a Classic Twist

However, if you are looking for something that will make you work up a sweat, and simply feel good, this is for you!  I am a huge fan of Ellen Barrett videos, and this had a similar feel.  It also had great music!  Aside from songs from Moby and the Eurythimics, there was also a mix of Theme From Canon in D, which I thought was awesome!  The workout starts with stretching and floor barre work that targets the lower body.  The next section is the dance section.  This ends around the 41 minute mark.  I like this, because sometimes I don't have time for a 50 minute workout.  The last 9 minutes consist of ab work and stretching.  You don't have to be a dancer to do this.  It was well-cued and somehow Deanna McBrearty helps you to move in a way that makes you feel like a graceful, beutifl ballerina!

1091267,A3NUTEF2PQEDN6,B000TKNWRO,"Obama-Mama ""Ballroom Dancer""","[3, 3]","This workout gives to exercisers what the NYC Ballet workouts don't: a solid routine with an extended cardio segment, flanked by warm-up stretches and abdominal strengthening work. Other than the somewhat distracting ""deer-in-the-headlights"" look and tele-prompted diction of Deanna at times (although she is still cute as always), this dvd was tastefully arranged, the set was clean and bright, and her professional backup dancers appeared self-assured, mature, and very competent at demonstrating the routine. Although this certainly isn't a ""balls-to-the-wall"", sweating-blood type of workout, it does lend a sense of grace, coordination, and lightness that other aerobic workouts don't. I have been trying out different dance-conditioning dvds, and although I don't expect them to necessarily make me a much better dancer, I do expect them to give me a good, overall body workout, while throwing in some coordination and conditioning moves that will modestly improve my performance in dance technique. I followed this workout with a few Pilates, yoga, and stretching segments (from Jennifer Galardi's ""Ballet Body"" dvd) to round out the entire workout so I felt that I had accomplished a comprehensive body conditioning workout. This dvd is good for beginners, and though some of the movements do require some upper and lower body coordination, over time things will become much easier with practice. I could imagine myself using just the cardio section on days when I want to mix things up with other dvds, for variety. I would recommend this dvd to those looking for a less pounding and more graceful workout.",4,"Low-impact, solid, professional workout...",1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1615,"['workout', 'exercisers', 'what', 'NYC', 'Ballet', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'solid', 'routine', 'extended', 'cardio', 'segment', 'flanked', 'warm-up', 'stretches', 'abdominal', 'strengthening', 'work', 'Other', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'deer-in-the-headlights', 'look', 'tele-prompted', 'diction', 'Deanna', 'times', 'still', 'cute', 'always', 'dvd', 'was', 'tastefully', 'arranged', 'set', 'was', 'clean', 'bright', 'professional', 'backup', 'dancers', 'appeared', 'self-assured', 'mature', 'very', 'competent', 'demonstrating', 'routine', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'balls-to-the-wall', 'sweating-blood', 'type', 'workout', 'lend', 'sense', 'grace', 'coordination', 'lightness', 'other', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'out', 'different', 'dance-conditioning', 'dvds', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'necessarily', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'dancer', 'do', 'expect', 'give', 'good', 'overall', 'body', 'workout', 'throwing', 'coordination', 'conditioning', 'moves', 'will', 'modestly', 'improve', 'performance', 'dance', 'technique', 'followed', 'workout', 'few', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'stretching', 'segments', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'Ballet', 'Body', 'dvd', 'round', 'out', 'entire', 'workout', 'so', 'felt', 'had', 'accomplished', 'comprehensive', 'body', 'conditioning', 'workout', 'dvd', 'good', 'beginners', 'movements', 'do', 'require', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'coordination', 'time', 'things', 'will', 'become', 'much', 'easier', 'practice', 'could', 'imagine', 'using', 'just', 'cardio', 'section', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'mix', 'things', 'up', 'other', 'dvds', 'variety', 'would', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'looking', 'less', 'pounding', 'more', 'graceful', 'workout']",Balocity: Cardio with a Classic Twist
