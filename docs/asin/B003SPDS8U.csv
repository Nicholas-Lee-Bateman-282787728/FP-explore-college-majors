Only several of the students are really Mercenaries, and one in particular takes his bodyguard role way too seriously. Those are the best moments in the series - his over-reaction to everyday occurrences. It's like putting Conan the Barbarian in charge of Medieval times and telling him to make it real. Way over the top and hilarious. You feel so sorry for Sousuke - but want to see him fail so badly.If you're a FMP fan, I'd watch this series (FUMOFFU - that's a mouth-full) - like light hearted adventure? Ditto.

1361526,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B003SPDS8U,Stephen M. Lerch,"[48, 49]","For those wondering about the show, my review will be quick. Sousuke is a teenage soldier/mercenary for a clandestine secret organization called Mithril. His job? Protect Chidori Kaname at all costs. Chidori is a ""whispered;"" someone with innate knowledge of high tech weaponry and defense tech. Of course, she doesn't actually KNOW she knows.While the original series,Full Metal Panic! The Complete series [Blu-ray] has a small amount of comedy mixed in with the action, suspense and love drama, Fumoffu sheds all but the comedy and love drama from the picture. Fumoffu is light hearted and fun. In terms of series, the original series I would say is the most even in terms of balancing the comedy and action/violence. Fumoffu falls into the comedy side of the balance, meaning there is no balance. Then you have the final series released to date,Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid Box Set [Blu-ray]. Fumoffu and TSR are almost diametrically opposed. If you placed Fumoffu on the comedy end of the balance, you would place TSR squarely in the serious/violent end of the balance.If you're looking for comedy, this is a good series to buy. If you're looking for action/violence, go for the follow up series,Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid Box Set [Blu-ray].Now as for the discs themselves:Video:Wow. Anyone that's seen the ADV release and can compare side by side can attest to the fact that FUNimation has done an amazing job with Fumoffu. You see, when ADV released the series, they used the masters they were provided; composite masters. This means that if you watch Fumoffu from ADV you will see a lot of video issues, from dot crawl to cross coloration. The Blu Ray release? GONE are these video artifacts. Evidently FUNimation went back to the original production house and requested/demanded (I don't know which) component masters, which means proper color separation and an elimination of composite video problems that plagued the original release.Is it perfect? No. The original release was for broadcast TV and it included a 24 fps opening/ending animation sequence so there may be some noticeable skips in the op/ed animation. I, however, DID NOT notice it. Also, with the way it was encoded you sometimes, if you pause the video, can capture a scene that bleeds into another. I'm watching on the PS3 and a 52"" DLP TV and in motion, rather than in pausing and scanning frame by frame, you don't notice anything wrong.While not perfect, it is SO much better than the original DVD release that even if you own the original DVD release it is definitely worth the upgrade. You just have to take into consideration if the video on the DVD is bad enough, for you, to warrant double dipping here. For me, it was a no brainer. Even with minor video issues on the Blu Ray, the video quality is MILES better than the original DVD release and most likely this is the best release we are likely to get in Region A/Region 1Audio:Dolby TruHD for both the Japanese and English mixes. For the English release, ADV dubbed it in 5.1, remixing the original stereo Japanese elements for this mix. As with most of the remixes from stereo to multichannel, the results are spotty to good at best. The mix isn't horrible but the directionality is minimal. Of course, when you consider there really isn't a ton of explosive action in the series, multichannel audio may have/may be over kill. However, it still sounds good. Clear and problem free.The Japanese stereo mix is also Dolby TruHD, however it is only a two channel stereo mix. This is as it was originally aired in Japan and has NOT been remixed even for the Japanese DVD/Blu Ray re-releases. The audio sounds very good and there are no problems with the Japanese mix either.Packaging:Well, I'll miss the series box and all the cover art that was included with the original release. The cover here is nice and in order to include as much cover art as possible, FUNimation has included a cardboard slip cover just as they did with the other two FMP releases. The nice part is that the artwork on the cardboard sleeve is different than that on the Blu Ray case cover, which is actually nice considering the more ""budget"" release audience they are targeting here.The artwork on the discs is pretty nondescript and lame, but in keeping with the FMP feel. It's has a mechanical look to it and the only difference between disc 1 and disc 2 is the label for ""disc 01"" and ""disc 02."" Otherwise they are identical.Extras:Gone are the video character artwork extras from the original DVD release. For some this won't matter and for others, it means that this collection is NOT complete.However, you ARE now receiving the original Japanese TV Spots (commercials) for the series that were absent from the original release.Also included are the clean opening and closing animations, which are also nice. The one thing I wish they would have included is the original Japanese opening/ending with the Japanese text left intact. Such is not the case though.If you are a completionist, you will need to have the DVD and Blu Ray (or DVD re-release from FUNimation) for all of the extras. If you don't mind not having the character artwork video sequences, you'll be OK selling the DVD release and putting the money towards either this Blu Ray set or the FUNimation DVD re-release.Over all this is a quality release for the budget conscious. Packaging is in line with the previous releases so it will fit right in with those sets on your shelf.If you owned the original release and hated the video quality and think it is a series worth double dipping on, buy this release without question.If you didn't notice the poor video quality or don't want uncompressed audio or didn't like the series too much, well, this release won't do much for you on Blu Ray either.",5,"FINALLY, a release (mostly) free from video problems",1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,5788,"['wondering', 'show', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'Sousuke', 'teenage',

I bought it and it sat on my shelf for about 3 months before I decided to watch this. Full Metal Panic is a series I enjoyed but the first and second season's didn't do enough to make me say this series was one of my all time favorites. I bought Fumoffu simply out of being a completionist. After the first episode though I was hooked!The whole romance and comedy premise wasn't interesting to me because I felt the characters were a bit flat in the first and second raid and without interesting characters, romance and comedy just don't work. Without being distracted by war conflicts and action sequences, the creators were able to make the characters much more interesting and it really caught me by surprise. I really fell in love with the characters in Fumoffu and my only disappointment is that it ended.In the end, I feel Fumoffu is the best that Full Metal Panic has to offer and I highly recommend it.I think you do have to watch the first season in order to appreciate and understand the relationship between the two main characters.
