821734,A1M0QL8USJWMQP,B00022FWHC,Do_I_have_to?,"[18, 19]","I'll be honest. I only watched this movie because it has Emily Mortimer in it. The first time, anyway. The second, third, and fourth times were for the very simple reason that I loved the movie. Action lovers be warned: it moves at a VERY slow pace (although, for some reason, it never drags), and its appeal lies almost entirely in the performances of Tim Blake Nelson and Emily Mortimer. Maybe I should explain a bit.The film is about two brothers (shocking, isn't it?) whose late mother spoiled them beyond reason. They are incapable of fending for themselves, even to do laundry. Their home is such a disaster that they cannot even find a maid who is willing to work more than one day. Desperate, they finally reach the obvious (!?) conclusion. Wife! Using the actual international matchmaking agency A Foreign Affair, the older brother, Jake (Nelson) books tickets to Russia, where they hope to find a woman who will keep house in exchange for a green card.Once they reach St. Petersburg, though, the brothers find they are not the only ones interested in Russian brides. A documentary filmmaker (Mortimer) offers to translate for Jake as long as he allows her to follow him around with a camera in his face. Both brothers begin to learn a bit more about themselves, women, and the world at large.The movie was shot in an almost documentary style, including several interviews with real men who had actually gone to St. Petersburg to find wives. Seriously. But if this were a documentary, it would be the most hilarious one I ever watched. The movie is obviously not for everyone. If you like black comedy, this is the way to go, but if your taste runs more towards gags and obvious jokes, avoid it like the plague!",5,Excellent,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,1720,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'first', 'time', 'anyway', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'times', 'were', 'very', 'simple', 'reason', 'loved', 'movie', 'Action', 'lovers', 'be', 'warned', 'VERY', 'slow', 'pace', 'reason', 'never', 'appeal', 'almost', 'entirely', 'performances', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'Nelson', 'Emily', 'Mortimer', 'Maybe', 'should', 'explain', 'bit.The', 'film', 'two', 'brothers', 'shocking', ""n't"", 'late', 'mother', 'spoiled', 'reason', 'are', 'incapable', 'fending', 'even', 'do', 'laundry', 'home', 'such', 'disaster', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'find', 'maid', 'who', 'willing', 'work', 'more', 'one', 'day', 'Desperate', 'finally', 'reach', 'obvious', 'conclusion', 'Wife', 'Using', 'actual', 'international', 'matchmaking', 'agency', 'A', 'Foreign', 'Affair', 'older', 'brother', 'Jake', 'Nelson', 'books', 'tickets', 'Russia', 'where', 'hope', 'find', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'keep', 'house', 'exchange', 'green', 'card.Once', 'reach', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'though', 'brothers', 'find', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'ones', 'interested', 'Russian', 'brides', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'Mortimer', 'translate', 'Jake', 'as', 'long', 'follow', 'around', 'camera', 'face', 'brothers', 'begin', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'women', 'world', 'large.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'almost', 'documentary', 'style', 'including', 'several', 'interviews', 'real', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'actually', 'gone', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'find', 'wives', 'Seriously', 'were', 'documentary', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'hilarious', 'one', 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'like', 'black', 'comedy', 'way', 'go', 'taste', 'more', 'towards', 'gags', 'obvious', 'jokes', 'avoid', 'plague']",2 Brothers and A Bride

821736,A2FEE88JZLDLXZ,B00022FWHC,"H. S. Wedekind ""Mr. Weekend""","[3, 3]","The previous reviews nicely give a synopsis of the plot, so I won't repeat what has been written. Like a couple of other reviewers, I, too, am a fan of the talented British actress Emily Mortimer (DEAR FRANKIE). She brings a natural beauty to the role of the Documentarian that is refreshing in its warmth and sincerity. She obviously loves her job and the spectacular city of Saint Petersburg. I wish I could visit St. Petersurg someday, though there many other cities around the world that I'd like to see first. It truly is  beautiful, even in winter when 2 BROTHERS & A BRIDE was filmed. As far as it being a comedy goes, it is definitely an understated one. The brothers Jake and Josh Adams (Tim Blake Nelson and David Arquette) play it down as two Middle-America yokels in search of a wife to replace their deceased mother. They only want a woman to cook and wash and clean house for them...just for two years until she is eligible to get a Green Card. The story revolves around them finding the right girl as quickly as possible before they run out of time and money (the tour is only for two weeks and they each have $4,000 to spend during that time). While the ending is somewhat predictable, the journey there is entertaining.

821738,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00022FWHC,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[7, 7]","I caught this small picture under the title ""A Foreign Affair"" because I tend to like Emily Mortimer and her film choices.  Well, let me tell you something, the DVD title ""2 Brothers and a Bride"" along with the generic cover picture with a somewhat inappropriately highlighted Mortimer do nothing to represent the real film.  Hoping, I suppose, to cash in on a more commercial and conventional romantic comedy hook, they actually do a disservice to the more unique story that is told here.  So expecting a silly David Arquette comedy, what I got instead was a fairly effective look at familial loyalty, a subtle romance, and a pretty incisive look at the ""mail-order bride"" trade.  While not a great picture, it is far better than I bargained for or than the DVD packaging would have led me to believe.Two brothers, David Arquette and Tim Blake Nelson, are eeking out a meager existence on their family farm.  Having their mother to tend for most of the household chores, things fall into disarray upon her death.  Both are already emotionally and socially stunted from an isolated lifestyle, but become desparate to find someone to help around the house.  Nelson stumbles across an Internet site showcasing potential brides in Russia.  So the two sign up for a trip which will, hopefully, bring a new woman into their life.  Seeking a business arrangement only, they plan a meticulous selection process--but not all goes smoothly.  Arquette, suddenly free and blossoming, starts to experience the joys to be had in the world of women. Meanwhile, Nelson doggedly pursues a practical match while being filmed by a British documentarian, played by Mortimer.The film is actually more serious than one might expect.  While there are definitely laughs to be had, the depiction of the ""marriage business"" is both informative and believable.  It's not a topic that is usually covered in much detail, so this close-up look seemed fresh.  Nelson and Arquette interact well, and each character is developed in detail and evolves in a realistic way.  Mortimer does solid work, as always--but this is mostly about the boys.  Ultimately, things wrap up rather too conveniently for my taste--but I did enjoy the ride.""2 Brothers and a Bride"" showcases nice performances and an interesting setting.  Much smarter than it's title, it was a pleasant surprise.  I'd rate it at about 3 1/2 stars for some unevenness and the tidy and pat ending, but I'm rounding up to encourage people to give this little film a look.

So it's off to St. Petersburg, Russia on a ""Romance Tour"" to find a homemaker in exchange for a Green Card.""Two Brothers and a Bride"" combines a study of the brothers' relationship and romantic realities with self-consciously corny comedy. Tim Blake Nelson and David Arquette are accomplished character actors, whose performances are almost not superficial enough for a romantic comedy. They're joined by the talented Emily Mortimer as a British documentarian who is filming foreign men who have journeyed to Russia in search of wives. ""Two Brothers and a Bride"" has its moments. Jake's methodical quest for a wife/housekeeper is at times very funny. But somehow the corny stuff, irony, and relationship drama don't converge successfully.
